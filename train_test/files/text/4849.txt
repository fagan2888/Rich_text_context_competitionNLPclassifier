Abstract
Objective: To examine the relationship of pulmonary parameters and functional capacity with
quality of life (QoL) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).
Methods: Thirty-six patients with chronic AF were included in this cross-sectional study. QoL was
assessed with the Medical Outcomes Survey 36-item Short Form (SF-36) and Minnesota Living
with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ). Respiratory muscle strength and pulmonary function
were also measured. Functional capacity was assessed with the 6-min walk test (6MWT). The Borg
CR10 Scale was used to determine the resting dyspnea and fatigue levels.
Results: The SF-36 physical component summary score was correlated with the maximum
inspiratory pressure (r ¼ 0.517), maximum expiratory pressure (r ¼ 0.391), 6MWT distance
(r ¼ 0.542), resting Borg dyspnea score (r ¼ À0.692), and resting Borg fatigue score (r ¼ À0.727).
The MLHFQ total score was correlated with the maximum inspiratory pressure (r ¼ À0.542),
maximum expiratory pressure (r ¼ À0.384), 6MWT distance (r ¼ À0.535), resting Borg dyspnea
score (r ¼ 0.641), and resting Borg fatigue score (r ¼ 0.703). The resting Borg fatigue score was the
significant independent predictor of the SF-36 physical component score and the MLHFQ total
score.
Conclusion: Respiratory muscle strength, functional capacity measured with the 6MWT, and
resting symptoms including dyspnea and fatigue may have an impact on QoL in patients with AF.

Introduction
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common
cardiac rhythm disturbance. It affects 1% to
2% of the general population, and its
prevalence increases with advancing age.
The underlying mechanism of AF is multi-
factorial; therefore, its management can be
complex and difficult.1 Although the symp-
toms of AF, including exercise intolerance,
dyspnea, and fatigue, range from nonexis-
tent to severe and differ among patients, the
quality of life (QoL) of affected patients is
usually impaired.2­6
AF also affects the ventilatory function of
the lungs.7,8 Some studies have shown that
the forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced
expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1
) are lower in
patients with AF than in those without
AF.9,10 Additionally, one study showed
respiratory muscle weakness in patients
with AF.8 However, the pulmonary function
of these patients and its contribution to the
disease burden has not been extensively
investigated.
QoL in patients with AF is reportedly
associated with symptom severity scores,6
the physical activity level, the New York
Heart Association (NYHA) functional
class,11 and depression and anxiety symp-
toms.12,13 Because possible pulmonary
impairment has been reported, we believe
that to examine QoL, patients with AF
should be assessed in a comprehensive
manner that includes assessment of both
pulmonary function and respiratory muscle
strength. Therefore, this study was per-
formed to analyze the relationship of QoL
with pulmonary function, respiratory
muscle strength, and functional capacity in
patients with AF.
Patients and methods
Study design and population
A cross-sectional study was designed.
Thirty-six patients with chronic AF were
recruited from the rhythm management
polyclinic in a university hospital according
to the following criteria: continuous chronic
AF of >6 months in duration, a left ven-
tricular ejection fraction of >40%, and a
NYHA functional class of I or II. The
exclusion criteria were the presence of any
chronic lung diseases, recent coronary
bypass surgery, previous heart valve sur-
gery, rheumatic valvular heart disease, acute
myocardial infarction, and the presence of a
pacemaker. This study was approved by the
ethics committee of a university hospital,
and all participants included in the study
provided written informed consent before
data collection.
QoL
QoL was measured with the generic Medical
Outcomes Survey 36-item Short Form (SF-
36) and disease-specific Minnesota Living
with Heart Failure Questionnaire
(MLHFQ). The SF-36 is a valid and reliable
36-item questionnaire that is widely used to
measure QoL in the general population. It
yields an 8-scale profile of functional health
and well-being scores as well as two sum-
mary scores of physical and mental health.
A higher score indicates better QoL.14 The
MLHFQ is a disease-specific questionnaire
comprising 21 items rated on 6-point Likert
scales. It yields a total score as well as
physical (8 items) and emotional (5 items)
dimension scores. A higher score indicates
poorer QoL.15 The MLHFQ was developed
196 Journal of International Medical Research 46(1)
for patients with heart failure but is also
widely used in patients with other cardiac
diseases, including AF.2
Pulmonary function and respiratory
muscle strength
Pulmonary function was measured with a
spirometer (SpiroUSB; CareFusion, San
Diego, CA, USA) according to the criteria
of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and
European Respiratory Society (ERS).16 The
FVC, FEV1
, peak expiratory flow, and
forced expiratory flow at 25% to 75% of
the pulmonary volume were measured and
are expressed as percentages of the predicted
values. Respiratory muscle strength was
measured by the maximum inspiratory pres-
sure (MIP) and maximum expiratory pres-
sure (MEP) using a hand-held respiratory
pressure meter (MicroRPM; CareFusion)
according to the ATS/ERS guideline.17 The
maximum value of three efforts that varied
by <5% was recorded for the MIP
and MEP.
Functional capacity and resting symptoms
Functional capacity was measured with the
6-min walk test (6MWT) according to the
guideline of the ATS.18 The test was
repeated twice with a 30-min recovery
period between the tests, and the higher
6-min walk distance (6MWD) was recorded.
The resting dyspnea and resting fatigue
levels were assessed with the Borg CR10
Scale. The anchors were 0 for no fatigue or
shortness of breath and 10 for maximum
fatigue or shortness of breath.19
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using
the SPSS 20.0 statistical program (IBM
Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Continuous
variables are expressed as mean Æ standard
deviation, ordinal variables are expressed
as median [minimum­maximum], and cat-
egorical variables are expressed as percent-
ages. The data distribution was assessed
with the Kolmogorov­Smirnov test,
Lilliefors test, and Shapiro­Wilk test.
Pearson correlation analysis was used for
normally distributed continuous data, and
Spearman correlation analysis was used for
ordinal or non-normally distributed data to
assess the relationship of QoL scores with
the pulmonary function, functional cap-
acity, and clinical features. A linear regres-
sion model was used to assess which
predictors contributed to the prediction of
the SF-36 physical component summary and
MLHFQ total score. QoL, pulmonary func-
tion, and functional capacity were compared
between patients with a NYHA class of I
and II using the independent-samples t-test
or Mann­Whitney U test depending on the
distribution properties of the data. A p value
of <0.05 was considered statistically signifi-
cant for all analyses.
Results
The patients' demographics, clinical fea-
tures, and test results are shown in Table 1.
Correlations of pulmonary function and
functional capacity with the SF-36 summary
scores and MLHFQ scores are shown in
Table 2.
The SF-36 physical component summary
score was strongly correlated with the rest-
ing Borg fatigue score; moderately corre-
lated with the MIP, 6MWD, and resting
Borg dyspnea score; and weakly correlated
with the MEP (p < 0.05).
The MLHFQ total and physical dimen-
sion scores were strongly correlated with the
resting Borg fatigue score; moderately cor-
related with the MIP, 6MWD, and resting
Borg dyspnea score; and weakly correlated
with the MEP (p < 0.05). The MLHFQ
emotional dimension score was weakly
correlated with the MIP and 6MWD
(p < 0.05).
Demir et al. 197
The patients' spirometric parameters
were >80% of the predicted values; i.e.,
the parameters were normal and were not
correlated with any of the QoL scores.
A linear regression model including the
variables MIP, 6MWD, and resting Borg
fatigue score was the best model for predict-
ing the SF-36 physical component score
and MLHFQ total score, explaining 59%
and 54% of the variance, respectively
(p < 0.001). The resting Borg fatigue score
was the significant independent predictor for
the SF-36 physical component score and
MLHFQ total score. Patients with higher
resting Borg fatigue scores had poorer QoL
(Table 3).
The comparison of QoL between the
patients with a NYHA class of I and II is
shown in Table 4. Compared with patients
with a NYHA class of I, those with a NYHA
class of II had significantly poorer phys-
ical and mental component QoL scores
and all subgroup scores except ``Social
Functioning'' and ``Role Limitations-
emotional'' of the SF-36 as well as signifi-
cantly poorer total, physical, and emotional
dimension scores of the MLHFQ (p < 0.05).
No significant differences in the spirometric

between classes I and II. The 6MWD was
significantly higher in patients with a
NYHA class of I than II (428 m vs. 374 m,
respectively; p < 0.05).
Discussion
In the present study, the respiratory muscle
strength, especially the MIP of patients with
AF, was significantly correlated with the SF-
36 physical component score and MLHFQ
physical and mental dimension scores. The
patients' spirometric values were normal
(>80% of the predicted values) and did
not have an influence on the QoL scores in
either questionnaire. The functional cap-
acity as measured by the 6MWT was
correlated with the SF-36 physical compo-
nent score and MLHFQ physical and
mental dimension scores. An important
finding is that compared with the other
measurements, the resting Borg fatigue
score had the strongest correlation with the

QoL scores. Although the predictive factors
for QoL in patients with AF have been
previously investigated, this was the first
study to investigate how QoL is influenced
by pulmonary function, respiratory muscle
strength, and functional capacity as mea-
sured with the 6MWT.
According to the ATS/ERS guideline,17
MIP values of <80 cmH2
O are abnormal
and indicate inspiratory muscle weakness. In
the present study, the mean MIP value of
patients with AF was 66.31 Æ 17.44 cmH2
O,
indicating inspiratory muscle weakness.
Inspiratory muscle weakness may negatively
influence QoL in patients with AF, as
indicated by the correlation between inspira-
tory muscle strength and the QoL scores.
Thus, we hypothesize that exercise training
focusing on the inspiratory muscles may
improve the QoL of patients with AF. This
hypothesis is consistent with the findings
of Cahalin et al.,20 who reported that
inspiratory muscle training improved QoL
in patients with heart disease and heart
failure. Similar studies are needed for
patients with AF.
We found no relationship between the
spirometric values and QoL in the present
study. Previous studies have reported an
influence of FVC and FEV1
on QoL in
patients with heart failure21 and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.22 The reason
for the lack of such a correlation between
the spirometric values and QoL in the
present study may be that our patients had
normal spirometric values.
Tsounis et al.11 and Arribas et al.23 both
reported that patients with AF with a higher
NYHA functional class had worse scores in
several QoL measures. These findings are
consistent with our results: our patients with
an NYHA class of II had worse scores than
those with an NYHA class of I in almost all
SF-36 subgroups and for all MLHFQ scores
(p < 0.05). Besides the NYHA functional
classification, we also found a significant

correlation of the functional capacity as
measured with the 6MWT with the SF-36
physical component score and MLHFQ
total and physical dimension scores. This is
an important finding because the 6MWT is
frequently used in cardiac rehabilitation
programs.24 The 6MWD of patients with
AF can be improved with aerobic exercise
training,25 Qi Gong training (Traditional
Chinese Medicine),26 and inspiratory muscle
training.8 Considering the relationship
between the 6MWT performance and QoL,
it may be assumed that by improving the
6MWD, the patients' QoL may also improve.
This assumption is supported by the findings
of Osbak et al.25 They reported significant
improvements in the 6MWD and QoL scores
on both the SF-36 and MLHFQ question-
naires with aerobic exercise training.
In the present study, the resting Borg
dyspnea and fatigue scores had the strongest
correlation with QoL. This finding is not
surprising because the literature clearly
shows that in patients with AF, QoL
decreases as symptom severity increases.6,27
Drug trials have shown that patients' QoL
can increase with improvements in AF-
related symptoms.28,29 Additionally, Smith
et al.30 reported that symptom control is a
key factor when determining QoL in
patients with AF. However, the literature
contains no exercise training studies that
focus on improving symptoms to increase
QoL in these patients. Therefore, future
studies are needed.
Patients with AF have poorer QoL than
individuals without AF. The purpose of the
present study was to determine whether
respiratory function contributes to their
QoL. Thus, we measured pulmonary func-
tion within a group of patients with AF and
correlated our measures with the QoL meas-
ures in this patient population. The QoL in a
control group of patients without AF may
or may not be correlated with pulmonary
function, but this would not pertain to the
interaction between pulmonary function
and AF on QoL and could mask our results
because they pertain to improvements in
QoL of patients with AF. The main limita-
tion of this study is that the sample size was
relatively small and the results may not be
representative for all patients with AF.
Nevertheless, the literature shows evidence
of impairments in pulmonary function and
respiratory muscle strength of patients with
AF; therefore, the impact of these impair-
ments on QoL should be investigated in
future studies with larger sample sizes.
Conclusion
Several factors that influence QoL in patients
with AF have been defined in the literature.
In the present study, we found that the
respiratory muscle strength, especially the
strength of the inspiratory muscles, and
the functional capacity of patients with AF
may also be related to QoL. Future studies
should consider the inclusion of respiratory
muscles and functional capacity in their
assessments when examining the QoL in
these patients. The fatigue level of the
patients was also an independent predictor
for the QoL measures in our study, which
emphasizes the importance of symptom con-
trol in the management of QoL in patients
with AF.
