Introduction
Did the financial crisis of 2008 and the economic, political,
and fiscal crisis during 2010 to 2012 lead to a social crisis in
2013/2014? What are the welfare effects of (macro) eco-
nomic policies (austerity measures) at the micro level on sub-
jective well-being? This is especially a pertinent issue among
those EURO-zone countries most hard hit by the crisis, the
so-called PIGS-countries, that is, Portugal, Ireland Greece,
and Spain.1 These are the countries in the Euro zone periph-
ery required to adopt budget retrenchment measures
(Hardiman, 2012). By contrasting the situation in these
PIGS-countries before and after the crisis with that of
Finland, the only Nordic country being part of the EURO-
zone, we may be better able to understand the most important
drivers for health and subjective well-being. Has develop-
ment in subjective health and satisfaction with life on aver-
age worsened among people in these countries, and have
socioeconomic inequalities on these welfare parameters
increased to the same extent in all these four countries?
I am using data from 2004 as a pre-crisis baseline, com-
paring them with the latest available dataset in European
Social Surveys (ESS) from 2014 (seventh round). In addi-
tion, I am also using 2013 EU-SILC (European Union
Statistics on Income and Living Conditions). In contrast to
earlier studies, this study uses a longer time span (10 years),
and aims at incorporating individual data in a country con-
text. Earlier studies have used aggregated data for a huge
number of countries (European Union [EU]/Agreement on
theEuropeanEconomicArea[EEA]countriesorOrganisation
for Economic Co-Operation and Development [OECD]
countries), or individual longitudinal data for one or two
countries, but, as far as I know, have not yet compared the
development in the countries presumably worst hit by the
crisis with that of a non-crisis country.
Individual satisfaction with life (evaluative well-being) is
not only associated with individual factors, but is heavily
influenced by country context such as "good governance"
(Helliwell, Huang, & Wang, 2015). Yet, aggregate data can-
not tell why some individuals have been more hard hit than
others. The aim of this article is thus more precisely to move

Economic, Financial, and Political Crisis
and Well-Being in the PIGS-Countries
Knut Halvorsen1
Abstract
The research question in this article is threefold: To which degree is the financial crisis of 2008 and the subsequent recession
associated with reduced well-being among people in the four hardest affected EURO countries? Are individual factors
associated with reduced well-being the same in these countries? and Are lower socioeconomic groups more severely hit than
the better off?. Data before the crisis are compared with data in 2013/2014 (EU-SILC [European Union Statistics on Income
and Living Conditions] survey 2013) for Greece, Portugal, Ireland, and Spain. Finland is used as a reference category. Before
control of individual characteristics, regressions demonstrate a small and mostly significant fall in average satisfaction with
life in these countries, Portugal being an exception. According to the theory of capability and actual economic and political
development, it was hypothesized that Greece--being the worst case in terms of economic development--may experience
the greatest fall in life satisfaction. This hypothesis is not supported by the data. In fact, the strongest decline was found in
Ireland. In particular, lack of political trust stands in Greece out as having an impact, while poor health is related to Ireland
and unemployment to Portugal and Spain. Greatest socioeconomic inequality in life satisfaction was found in Portugal.

a bit further by identifying such categories, within countries
as well as across countries. To study changes in life satisfac-
tion, inequality has in the literature been less developed
(Owen & Philips, 2015). Which categories are hardest hit by
the recession, and are they similar or dissimilar in the coun-
tries under study? The drivers behind changes in well-being
may not be the same for all these countries, not least because
the causal paths to the crisis differ among these countries
(Therborn, 2013). Previous aggregate studies of well-being
cannot identify which factors in each crisis country play a
role. This study aims at filling these voids.
Theory and Research Questions
I am testing a widespread theory that recessions affect nega-
tively well-being and that their impacts are unequal within as
well as between countries. People's satisfaction with life is
determined not only by macro-level economic development
but also by their actual experiences and living conditions as
well as personality The theoretical point of departure is
Amartya Sen's (1999) capability approach used as an assess-
ment of individual well-being. Capabilities are the freedoms
and rights people have to do or be to fulfill their potential for
well-being. The basic capability is the freedom to choose
(autonomy) a life she or he has reason to value (Sen, 1999).
Capabilities are thus "a person's real freedoms or oppor-
tunities to achieve functionings" (Robeyns, 2016, p. 9).
These freedoms and opportunities are made feasible and
constrained by both internal and external (social and envi-
ronmental) conversion factors (Robeyns, 2005). The coun-
try-level frameworks (space of action) for capabilities can
be measured at the national level, traditionally not only by
gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, unemployment, or
inequality but also, for example, by an aggregate measure of
social justice, corruption or a measure of social expenditures.
Capabilities restrict whether resources can be converted into
functionings as well as choice of functions (Robeyns, 2005,
p. 108; 2016). Functionings (achievements), that is what
people actually are doing within the institutional constraint
of a nation, can be measured by individual characteristics
such as labor market status and household's economic situa-
tion. Together, capabilities and functionings determine sub-
jective well-being (satisfaction with life). Sen's capability
approach has been incorporated in a well-being framework,
where subjective well-being reflects the "total of an individ-
ual's capabilities to achieve subjective well-being" (Binder,
2014, p. 1211).
Well-being is a multidimensional concept. Satisfaction
with life, a sub dimension of well-being--the other being
happiness (the hedonic dimension) and meaning (the eude-
monic dimension)--is regarded as a valid indicator (Deaton
& Stone, 2016). Life satisfaction can be regarded as the most
appropriate as a policy goal (Veenhoven, 2010). This subjec-
tive measure is meant to represent a cognitive and global
appraisal of quality of life as a whole, taking all life
circumstances into consideration (Eurofound, 2012). Thus,
life satisfaction can be regarded as a valid measure of a per-
son's functioning. Both past, present, and to a certain extent
the future is reflected in peoples' response to questions of
satisfaction with life.
Aconsequence of the recession has been austerity policies
in many European countries, not least in the PIGS-countries
(Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Spain), with repercussions on the
capabilities of populations in these countries to achieve sub-
jective well-being. Life satisfaction is not a direct function
of the economy, but has an indirect impact through changes
in peoples' experience of free choice and having control
over their life situation (Helliwell & Wang, 2013). It turns
out that the experience of freedom of choice and control pre-
dicts satisfaction with life to a greater extent than health,
employment, and income, both within and across countries:
"Income expands freedoms of choice by definition" (Verme,
2009, p. 7).
The research question is threefold:
Research Question 1: To which degree is the financial
crisis of 2008 and the subsequent recession associated
with reduced well-being among people in the four hardest
affected EURO-countries?
Research Question 2: Are individual factors associated
with reduced well-being the same in these countries?
Research Question 3: Are lower socioeconomic groups
more severely hit than the better off?
Drivers of Satisfaction With Life:
Recent Findings
Several studies have demonstrated that economic growth
(the natural log of GDP per capita) is important (Deeming &
Jones, 2013; O'Connor, 2014), but improved social policy
(social protection expenditure) has a greater impact on peo-
ple's well-being (Growiec & Growiec, 2014; O'Connor,
2014; Pacek & Radcliff, 2008; Rothstein, 2011).
Finally, economic downturns can have a negative influ-
ence on life satisfaction, because it is more sensitive to eco-
nomic conditions than happiness (Inglehart, Foa, Peterson, &
Welzel, 2009). In general, it turns out that income losses
have a stronger effect on life satisfaction than income gains
(Wolbring, Keuschnigg, & Negele, 2013). Blanchflower and
Oswald (2011) have looked at changes in life satisfaction
over recent years during a recession using data from
Eurobarometer 2007-2010: There has been a decline in the
life satisfaction levels both in Greece and Portugal, measured
both by a decline in their mean scores as well as in the rela-
tive rankings in the regression, but in fact an increase in life
satisfaction levels of the Irish.
The impact of economic crisis on happiness has been stud-
ied in the case of Iceland. This longitudinal study found that
income and unemployment did not predict happiness, but
financial difficulties did.Adecrease (small, but significant) in
Halvorsen 3
happiness (between 2007 and 2009) was detected after the
collapse (Gudmundsdottir, 2013).
Findings do not fully support the assertion that "decreases
in income at the national level, due to recessions for instance,
might with greater certainty cause declines in SWB" (Diener
& Biswas-Diener, 2009, p. 135). In fact, some forms of mor-
tality and morbidity (health indicators presumably associated
with happiness/well-being) could rise during upturns and
decrease during economic downturns (Bacigalupe &
Escolar-Pujolar, 2014; Copeland et al., 2015; Karanikolos
et al., 2013; Kentikelenis et al., 2011; Ruhm, 2005; Stuckler
& Basu, 2013).
Earlier studies have shown that change in the unemploy-
ment rate had significant impact on well-being (Arampatzi,
Burger, & Veenhoven, 2014).
Furthermore, subjective insecurity and the role of institu-
tions seem to have an impact on well-being (Chung & Mau,
2014). There is a positive association between the degree of
democracy and satisfaction with life (Dolan, Peasgood, &
White, 2008). Especially in universal welfare states (such as
Finland), there are high mutual trust and trust in public institu-
tions and democracy and small corruption (Eurofound, 2012;
Rothstein, 2011). Political stability has robustly significant
effects on happiness (Wang & Sunny Wong, 2014). During
crises, politics change as a response, and will in turn impact on
the well-being of those people affected. Good governance is
more strongly associated with satisfaction with life than GDP
per capita (Helliwell & Huang, 2008; Rothstein, 2011).
Country Descriptions
Capability--regarded as set of alternative functionings that
a person can attain, is strongly influenced by the social
structures and institutions in each country (Robeyns, 2005).
The country descriptions aim at presenting possible con-
straints on individual freedoms and opportunities (i.e., indi-
vidual capacity to make autonomous choices and pursue a
fulfilling life, Graham & Nikolova, 2014), by using objective
capability measures.
Recessions, Fall in GDP and Income, Inequality
and Increase of Debts
A recession is defined as a business cycle contraction in two
down consecutive quarters. In Greece, it lasted for 63 months
(Q3.2008 until Q2.2014); In Ireland, it lasted for 30 months
(Q2.2007 until Q3.2007 and Q1.2008 until Q4. 2009); In
Portugal, it lasted for 45 months (Q2.2007 until Q3.2007,
Q1.2008 until Q1.2009, and Q4 2010 until Q1.2013); In
Spain, it lasted for 48 months (Q2.2008 until Q4.2009 and
Q2.2011 until Q2.2013): In Finland, it lasted for 30 months
(Q1.2008 until Q2.2009, Q2.2012 until Q1.2013) (https://
stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=350; Quarterly national
accounts).
Fall in GDP per capita occurred during 2007 to 2009. We
saw a recovery in 2010, but a new fall took place in 2011/2012
and a new small recovery in 2013 (Figure 1).
GDP per capita (Purchasing Power Parity [PPS]) has
thus decreased strongly in the PIGS-countries. Setting EU28
= 100, it has in Greece fallen from 96 in 2004 to 73 in 2014,
in Portugal from 80 to 78, in Ireland from 146 to 134, in
Spain from 100 to 91, while in Finland there was stagnation
(114 to 113) (Eurostat, 2015a). From 2007 to 2011 (2014),
there has been a considerable increase in disposable income
inequality in Spain, but not in any of the other countries
(Eurostat, 2015c; OECD, 2014a).

Unemployment
Unemployment rates have gone up in all these four coun-
tries, in contrast to Finland. The figures have almost tripled
from 2002 to 2013/2014 (Eurostat Yearbook, 2013).
Long-term unemployment (as a share of the active popu-
lation) has quadrupled from 2008 to 2011 in Spain, Greece,
Ireland, while it has increased with 50% in Portugal (World
Health Organization-Europe, 2013). The economic crisis has
only to a limited extent affected the Finnish labor market.
Public Expenditures and Debts
People in all these four PIGS-countries had to pay a heavy
price in the form of reduction in public expenditures such as
stricter targeting criteria for social benefits, cuts in salaries,
cuts in health budgets, pension reform (such as increased
pension age), privatization of public sectors companies, lay-
offs, and higher taxes.
As a consequence of decreased GDP, government deficits
in percentage of GDP have increased and was in 2010: 31.3%
(Ireland), 10.6% (Greece), 9.8% (Portugal), and 9.3%
(Spain), resulting in higher ratio of government debt to GDP
(general gross debt) at the end of 2010. Since 2010, debts
have increased strongly in all these countries. In 2012,
Greece's gross debt was 157% of GDP, followed by Portugal
(124%), Ireland (117%), and Spain (86%), while in Finland,
it was 53%.2 The highest level of general government gross
debt was reached in Greece with 180% of GDP in 2014. The
same was the case for Portugal (130%), Ireland (120% in
20012), and Spain (99%) (European Commission, 2014;
Eurostat, 2015b).
Percentage change in real public expenditures (2007/2008
to 2012/2013) was especially strong in Greece (-17.6%),
while there was an increase in Spain (+17.6%) and Portugal
(+4.3%) (Petmesidou & Guillén, 2014).
Health expenditures in real terms per capita fell annually
in real terms from 2009 to 2013 with 7.2% in Greece, with
3.3% in Portugal, with 4% in Ireland, with 1.6% in Spain,
while there was an 1.3% increase in Finland (OECD,
2015a). Access to health care during the Great Recession
has decreased, and co-payments have gone up, while need
for medication for depression have gone up (Stuckler &
Basu, 2013).
Cuts in cash benefits, and fall in their real values due to
inflation, have had the greatest negative impact in Greece.
Such cuts in Greece, Ireland, and Portugal have been imposed
on them because of the European Union-International
Monetary Fund (EU-IMF) loan program. All the four Pigs-
countries have met strong pressures to reduce their budget
deficit to 3% by 2014, while maximum debt is set at 60% of
GDP in accordance with EU's Stability- and Growth pact.
EU's "Excessive Deficit Procedures" were set in force
toward Ireland, Greece, and Spain as early as in October
2008, immediately reducing their loan capacity. Greece had
to accept a loan program in 2010 (rescue package 110 billion
Euro) and another in February 2012 (rescue package 130 bil-
lion Euro). These rescue packages obliged Greece to accept
comprehensive cuts in expenditures and large tax increases.3
Ireland had to use EU-IMF loan in 2010 (rescue package
67.5 billion Euro), Portugal in 2011 (rescue package 78 bil-
lion Euro), while Spain in 2012 had to accept a rescue loans
for the banks of 100 billion Euro. The stabilization programs
imposed by EU-IMF ended for Ireland in December 2013, in
Portugal in May 2014, while the second stabilization pro-
gram for Greece, which started in 2012, will last for three
more years.4 As a result these countries had to undertake
labor market reforms, resulting in substantial changes: More
or less dismantling of collective bargaining, more insecure,
flexible jobs, and lower minimum wages.
It seems that apart from Greece, the other three countries
Ireland, Spain, and to a certain extent Portugal were more or
less equally hit by the crisis (number of months in recessions,
decrease in GDP per capita, and increase in unemployment
levels). As a consequence, household disposable income fell
from 2007 to 2011 with 21% in Ireland, 13% in Spain, 9% in
Portugal (OECD, 2015b), while in Greece it fell with 25%
from 2008 to 2011 (OECD, 2013a).
Trust
All these countries, with the exception of Finland, have a
population with low trust in government (Eurofound, 2012;
OECD, 2014b). We find reduced trust in police and in the
legal system especially in Greece (Helliwell & Wang,
2013). Changes in social trust (in the police and the legal
system) are found to be the primary contributors to changes
over time in subjective well-being in European countries
(Helliwell, Huang, & Wang, 2014). Distrust breeds distrust,
not least with a perceived increase in corruption (Sachs,
2015): Perception of corruption is negatively and strongly
associated with low evaluation of life (happiness) accord-
ing to regressions on national averages levels (Helliwell
et al., 2015).
It is hard to distinguish between countries that were
equally hard hit by the economic crisis, but where some have
had strong austerity measures and others not, as there is a
high correlation between the severity of the crisis and type of
austerity measures (OECD, 2014b, see also Saltkjel,
Ingelsrud, Dahl, & Halvorsen, in press). On the basis of the
theoretical point of departure and country descriptions, I
nevertheless tentatively hypothesize that the Greek people
have had the most negative development in well-being expe-
riences, followed by the Spaniards and, and to a smaller
extent the Irish and the Portuguese, compared with the refer-
ence country, Finland.
Accompanied with lower satisfaction with life is lower
personal trust (Helliwell & Wang, 2011), which could be seen
as a consequence of political instability due to the recession.
Therefore, fall in personal and political trust can be expected,
being more strongly associated with (low) satisfaction with
life in 2013 than in pre-crisis period, particularly in Greece.

Data and Research Design
I am using cross sectional datasets from ESS mainly from the
period 2002 (Wave 1) to 2014 (Wave 7) in the PIGS-
countries. Especially the South Mediterranean states have
been characterized as "familist" welfare states. The role of
the Catholic Church and non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) has been of great importance in Spain and Portugal,
while the Eastern Orthodox Church has played a less impor-
tant in promoting welfare in Greece (Petmesidou, 2013). The
(traditional) families in these states have been used as "social
shock absorbers" responding to a wide range of risks (Ferrera,
2010). Also in Ireland being a catholic state, its people have
put strong emphasis on the family. Finland, being a secular,
universalistic welfare state with an individualistic culture,
not much hit by the crisis, is used as a benchmark. Although
a EURO-zone country, it is at the same time an example of
the well-performing Nordic countries on most indicators of
welfare and democratic development. In terms of happiness
scores, Finland was ranked sixth among 158 countries in the
World Gallup Poll 2012-2014 scores during that period
(Helliwell et al., 2015). The strong social fabric of the Finnish
society has enabled people to overcome earlier crisis
(Böckerman & Ilmakunnas, 2006).
In both waves (ESS, 2004, 2014) used in the comparison,
the response rates were at acceptable levels, varying between
50% and 78%. Surveys for the ESS Round 7 were in Spain
and Portugal conducted during 2015, which is up to 2 years
later than EU-SILC 2013 (see later).
I have used as recommended by ESS design weights/pop-
ulation weights to compensate for skewed distribution on
central background variables in the samples.
ESS-data are supplemented with EU-SILC 2013 and its
ad hoc well-being module
in order to include the development in Greece, and for the
purpose of a robustness check by comparing data from EU-SILC
2013 with European Social Surveys 2014 (7th round). The
advantage of EU-SILC 2013 is the greater number of
respondents, and as a consequence reduced confidence intervals
of coefficients in the regressions. Besides, it also includes data
from Greece, which were missing in the 2012 and 2014 rounds
of European Social Surveys (www.europeansocialsurveys.org).
EU-SILC 2013 surveys are done partly by personal inter-
views and partly by telephone interviews. I have used
EU-SILC2013 personal weights.
In the comparisons, I am using ordinary least squares
(OLS) hierarchical regression in IBM SPSS statistics 23.
The Dependent Variable: Definition and
Measurement of Subjective Well-Being
I am using an evaluative dimension of subjective well-being,
namely, satisfaction with life--being an overall cognitive
assessment of life. The validity and reliability of satisfaction
with life has been amply documented to be high (see, for
example, Adler & Seligman, 2016; Bok, 2010; Diener,
Inglehart, & Tay, 2013; Durand & Smith, 2013; Layard,
2005; OECD, 2013b). As expected, this overall cognitive
assessment of life is strongly correlated with material condi-
tions, social relationships, and health (Eurostat, 2015d). It
also seems that this indicator is sensitive to change in politi-
cal measures.
Satisfaction with life is proxied by this item (in ESSs):
"All things considered, how satisfied are you with your life
as a whole nowadays. Please answer using this card, where 0
means extremely dissatisfied and 10 means extremely satis-
fied." This 11-point scale is thus running from 0 to 10. In
EU-SILC 2013, satisfaction with life is measured in a similar
way, but where score 0 means not at all satisfied and score 10
means fully satisfied for last 4 weeks. This categorical vari-
able can be regarded as continuous, making it feasible to use
OLS regressions. Both surveys have the same numbers of
response options, but as shown, the wordings are not identi-
cal: "extremely dissatisfied/extremely satisfied" versus "not
at all satisfied/fully satisfied." Besides, ESS refers to "nowa-
days" while EU-SILC refers to "last four weeks."
Independent Individual Variables
Based on earlier findings, I hypothesize that the main explan-
atory individual factors explaining variance are supposed to
be unemployment, subjective health (Suhrke & Stuckler,
2012), material deprivation (Eurofound, 2013), political and
personal trust (Growiec & Growiec, 2014; Helliwell &
Wang, 2013; Helliwell et al., 2015; Mertens & Beblo, 2016;
Owen & Philips, 2015; Veenhoven, 2008), but being moder-
ated by family network and support/help from family
(Mikucka, 2014). Health status is also a good predictor of
subjective well-being (Eurofound, 2013), but is here regarded
as an independent variable.5
Household income levels and national wealth have strong
effects on social well-being, but particularly for low-income
households (Deeming & Jones, 2013; Eurofound, 2012;
Eurostat, 2015d; Pew Research Center, 2014). Because the
attrition of a household income variable is substantial for
several of the countries, I have instead included a variable of
self-perceived household financial difficulties.6 Objective
measures of household income show that self-perceived dif-
ficulties are real (OECD, 2014b). Especially households
with poor savings have difficulties to cope with reduced
household income, unless social support measures can com-
pensate for this income loss (OECD, 2014b). Greater eco-
nomichardshipmayalsoaffectnegativelysocialrelationships
and attitudes toward others (OECD, 2014b).
Mistrust may occur because of bad times and dysfunc-
tional (untrustworthy) government institutions (Rothstein,
2011), and having a negative impact on well-being, mediated
through, for example, the extent of optimism about the future
(Eurofound, 2012). I control for personal trust and social
relationships--being central indicators of social capital
(Sachs, 2015). Social networks can protect people against
6 SAGE Open
negative impact of financial hardship and well-being
(Growiec & Growiec, 2014). Social connectedness (the role
of the family and social connections) has been found to be
central for well-being promotion (Delle Fave, 2014). I have
measured connectedness through a variable based on a ques-
tion whether the respondent had anyone to talk about per-
sonal mattes or not (intimacy). This variable is regarded as a
mediating factor in the regressions.
Financial crisis can harm health or improve health as
mentioned earlier. Health status has been found to be the
most notable predictor for general life satisfaction (Eurostat,
2015d). There seems to be a strong reciprocal relationship
between ill health and employment status, due to both selec-
tive processes and health effects of unemployment (Heggebø
& Dahl, 2015). I have entered self-reported health to repre-
sent the health of the individuals (fair, bad, or very bad is
coded 1; good or very good is coded 0), as well as a variable
about being hampered in daily life due to a chronic long-
standing illness (answered yes = 1, no = 0) as independent
variables.
Control variables are dummies for sex, age (20-29 years
vs. 30 years and older), marital status (being single--living
in a one-person household), and finally educational level
(primary education versus all other educational levels), as an
indicator of socioeconomic status.
Descriptive Statistics
In the following, I am restricting the analyses to age group 20
to 59 years, which is the working age population, most likely
hardest hit by the recession.
Both gender and age are quite similar in all samples that I
am comparing, while there are dissimilarity between ESS
and EU-SILC when it comes to proportion of single persons
and people with low education. The most noteworthy of the
descriptive statistics is the high proportion having low edu-
cation in Portugal (results not presented, but are available by
contacting the author).
As shown in Table 1, until 2004 (Greece7 and Ireland) and
2006 (Spain and Portugal), there was an increase in average sat-
isfaction with life, turning downward in 2008 (Greece, Ireland,
and Spain), with another reversed trend in 2010 (Portugal) or
2012 (Ireland). In Spain, there has a steady fall in satisfaction
with life since 2006. Yet, when using standard deviations as a
measure of inequality, it does not seem that there has been
greater inequality in satisfaction with life in any of these coun-
tries, with Spain and possibly Portugal being exceptions.
Multivariate Analyses
External circumstances are controlled for by entering coun-
try as dummy variables in the OLS regressions,8 using
Finland as a reference category (Model 1, Table 2).Adummy
variable is meant to represent the different characteristics of
the country that we are comparing, but being unobserved. All
country coefficients have changed from 2004 to 2013/2014,
but not all of them are significant (having overlapping confi-
dence intervals). These changes demonstrate mostly worse
satisfaction with life, with the exception of Portugal, where
there has been an improvement, although not significant
when comparing the 2004 and 2014 data (overlapping confi-
dence intervals), albeit with a lower starting level than the
other countries (see Table 1). Yet, the worst development
since 2004 according to these data was unexpectedly found
in Ireland, followed by Spain and Greece. The next step is to
check whether these country differences hold when control-
ling for individual variables.
Table 3 (Model 2) analyzes individual variation in satis-
faction with life, including controls for living in a certain
country. The country differences are smaller, and none of the
coefficient changes from 2004 to 2013/2014 are significant,
again with the exception of Portugal. Explained variance
increased a lot, both on the 2004 and 2013 data. This sug-
gests that the main changes in aggregate satisfaction with life
(Table 1) can be attributed to individual characteristics and
changes in these.

Some of the individual variables are influenced by the cri-
ses, such as own unemployment, household's economic situ-
ation, trust, and possibly health. All these factors are
associated with satisfaction with life both in 2004 and 2013
(Greece is included in both surveys). Yet, personal trust and
political trust are the only independent variables that were of
greater significance in 2013 than in 2004 (not overlapping
confidence intervals), apart from health and being hampered
in daily activities. Keeping in mind that social trust and trust
in governments are causally related (Rothstein, 2011), these
factors tell us about the political crisis in the PIGS-countries.9
Economic hardship explains significantly more of the vari-
ance in 2014 data compared with 2004, but not compared
with 2013 data (EU-SILC). Unemployment does not explain
more of the variance in 2013/2014 than in 2004. As demon-
strated, the higher the unemployment rate, the weaker the
effect of individual unemployment (Heggebø & Dahl, 2015).
This may be due to less stigma and self-blame when the

unemployment rate is high. There are rather different social
compositions of the unemployed in good versus bad times.
The reason why being unemployed does not have greater
impact in 2013/2014 than in 2004 could also be due to the
fact that the reference category includes employed with a
greater proportion with temporary contracts in 2013/2014
than in 2004 (Eurostat, 2014). In many respects, temporary
workers may experience the same uncertainty about the
future as the unemployed.
Yet, changes between 2004 and 2014 in country coeffi-
cients compared with Finland as reference category are
insignificant when individual characteristics are controlled
for, again with the exception of Portugal (significantly to the
better). As is demonstrated, individual coefficients explain
much more of the variance than country coefficients. The
quality of social relations (having someone to talk to about
personal matters with) is associated with higher satisfactions
with life in all regressions, but particularly in EU-SILC 2013.
The importance of quality of social relations is in line with
others studies on satisfaction with life/happiness (see, for
example, Helliwell et al., 2014).
Keeping in mind that ESS 2014 does not include Greece,
in contrast to EU-SILC 2013, coefficients in both surveys
have the same sign (living alone is the only exception), but
the magnitude is dissimilar, for example, the coefficients of
economic hardship and intimacy. Nevertheless, this compari-
son indicates that the findings are robust.
Table 4 presents interaction effects between country and
main explanatory variables (unemployment, financial hard-
ship, health, personal trust, and political trust). These are
selected according to existing literature and theory in this
field (see "Theory and Research Questions" and "Drivers of
Satisfaction With Life: Recent findings" sections) In 2004
(ESS data), due to the small number of respondents, the only
significant (at 5% level) interaction effect was found between
political trust and Portugal, and between health and Greece
(results not presented).
Based on EU-SILC 2013 data, Table 4 (Model 3 with
interaction effects) demonstrates that unemployment is asso-
ciated with lower satisfaction with life in Portugal Spain and
Ireland, but only to a small extent in Greece. On the contrary,
Greece had the most negative impact of political trust on
satisfaction with life compared with the reference category
Finland, followed by Portugal and Spain. Being healthy
seems to be positively associated with satisfaction with life
in Greece, while being of no importance in Spain. Bad sub-
jective health was particularly associated with low satisfac-
tion with life in Ireland.
Finally, Ireland is different with financial hardship being
positively associated with satisfaction with life, while there
was a small negative association in Greece and no in Spain (all
compared to the reference category Finland). Compared to
results presented in Table 3, both ESS 2004 and ESS 2014, one
may suspect that this is due to different wording of the ques-
tion about financial hardship in EU-SILC 2013 (see Note 6).
The association between personal trust and country
is small but significant in all countries compared to
Finland.

The lower satisfaction with life in Greece compared with
the reference category (Finland) is thus as hypothesized to a
great extent associated with lack of political trust, to a certain
extent with households' economic situation, but not with
unemployment or health.
Model 3 (Table 4) with interaction effects improves the
model fit (F test in SPSS) from R2 .483 to .487, which is
significant at .01 level, but only marginally (results not
presented).
Finally, separate regressions were run with interaction
effects between country and socioeconomic status (mea-
sured through education level). These indicate that low
socioeconomic status in 2013 (in contrast to 2004) had the
strongest negative impact on satisfaction with life in
Portugal, followed by Spain and Greece, with lowest impact
in Ireland, again with Finland used as a reference category
(results not presented).
Discussion
I have in this article thrown light on three research questions:
(1) To which degree the financial crisis of 2008 and the sub-
sequent recession was associated with reduced well-being
among people in the four hardest affected EURO-countries?
(2) Are there particular mechanisms at the individual level in
each country that are responsible for the assumed negative
impact of crisis on well-being? and (3) Are lower socioeco-
nomic groups more severely hit than the better off? At coun-
try level, the greatest significant fall in satisfaction with life
from 2004 to 2013 was in Ireland, followed by Spain and
Greece, while there was an improvement in Portugal. These
results are not as hypothesized and not fully in accordance
with, for example, Blanchflower and Oswald (2011), per-
haps due to a different time span. When controlling for indi-
vidual characteristics, satisfaction with life does not differ
significantly among people in Spain, Ireland and Greece,
while the Portuguese, having a low starting point, are signifi-
cantly more satisfied with life in 2013/2014, when compar-
ing with Finland, used as a benchmark. This suggests that
individual's capability and functioning is not only influenced
by the economic and political development (macro-factors),
but by individual factors such as education, household situa-
tion, financial situation, employment status, and health.
Worse subjective health cannot significantly explain
more of the variance of satisfaction with life in 2013/2014
than in 2004, in any of the four countries under study, with
a possible exception for Ireland. On average, subjective
health has improved or been stable. That is also the case for
inequality in health being rather stable (as measured by
standard deviations) in all five countries (results not pre-
sented). Yet, fall in life satisfaction can be regarded as a
leading indicator pointing to later serious health problems
(OECD, 2014b). Most of the associations between individ-
ual characteristics and satisfaction with life are in accor-
dance with previous findings.
The fundamental question is whether these results give
support to a hypothesis about a statistical connection between
the economic crisis in the PIGS-countries and average satis-
faction with life. Such a hypothesis implying that Greece may
experience the greatest fall in satisfaction with life is not sup-
ported by the data. A 25% fall in GDP per capita have resulted
only in a 6% fall in average satisfaction with life. In fact, the
strongest decline was found in Ireland (where the crisis ended
in 2009/2010) and Spain, while there actually was an improve-
ment in Portugal. Because average subjective well-being
within OECD nations also was found to be unaffected by vari-
ous economic and environmental crises (Veenhoven, 2005),
one could perhaps name the development "The Paradox of
Happiness in Hardship" (Austin, 2016).
What about increasing socioeconomic differences?
During the crisis, there has not been an increase in stan-
dard deviations of satisfaction with life (Table 1), but still
there could be increasing socioeconomic differences, with,
for example, persons with lower education more hard hit
by the crisis than others (van der Wel et al., 2016). This
seems to be the case: Low education explains more of the
variance on satisfaction with life in 2013 than in 2004.
This seems to be especially the case in Portugal, where
there was on average an increase in satisfaction with life
during the crisis. Besides, people having no one to talk
intimately with (i.e., being socially isolated) seem to be
hardest hit by the economic downturn.
Adaptive preferences may explain why PIGS-countries
have not experienced a much greater average fall in satisfac-
tion with life: People seem to get used to worse living condi-
tions and reduce their expectations accordingly (Elster,
1983). According to Sen (1985), this adaption can be
regarded as a survival strategy. It is attributed to a necessity
of keeping up self-esteem, control, and optimism (Cummins,
2003). Related is a habituation effect of unemployment as it
becomes more common (Mertens & Beblo, 2016).
Which alternative factors than economic decline and fall
in employment could have an impact on changes in satisfac-
tion with life in these countries? The following aggregate
factors have been highlighted in recent research (apart from
those already mentioned: institutional trust, social justice,
and corruption).
·
· Family resilience: Families, when they can, actively
adapt to adverse circumstances, such as drawing
on savings or reducing non-essential consumption
(OECD, 2014b). Social support (having someone to
count on in case of trouble) is the factor that explains
most of national variation in happiness around the
world (Helliwell et al., 2015). Surveys also show that
a high proportion of respondents in these countries
receive and provide help and support from people
they are close to Eliassen, 2014; Royo, 2014).
Traditionally, the family (and kin) has played a central
role in pooling resources (Petmesidou, 2013) in these
10 SAGE Open
nations. Yet in Greece, the family has had a weaken-
ing position as a welfare clearinghouse (Papadopoulos
& Roumpakis, 2013).
·
· A large informal economy in Greece may also have
had a buffering impact (Petmesidou, 2013), as well as
in Spain: Spain's black economy was by the end of
2012 24.6% of GDP, up from 17.8%, when the crisis
began in 2008 ("Spain's Black Economy," 2014).
Multilevel resilience may thus have helped the population
to resist and adapt to health threats due to the economic crisis
(Karanikolos et al., 2013). Resilience against economic hard-
ship is dealt with through immaterial resources from civil
society, but less so among the most deprived (Reeskens &
Vandecasteele, 2016). Examples are trends toward refamil-
ialization (particularly in Ireland and Spain, cf. OECD,
2014b), emigration in Spain and Portugal, emergence of
local solidarity groups in Greece, and buffers from family
(youth living at home and/or getting some support from par-
ents or grandparents), charities, and some regional efforts in
Spain. Although macro-level factors play a role in reducing
peoples capabilities to achieve subjective well-being, multi-
level resilience, from families, the informal economy and
voluntary organizations may have played a moderating role.
Strengths and Limitations
The strength of this article is the use of ESSs over a 10-year
time span, where the same question about satisfaction with
life has been used in all survey rounds. The dependent vari-
able used is highly recommended and has high reliability and
validity as an indicator of evaluative well-being. Another
advantage is the use of EU-SILC 2013, which gave me the
opportunity to conduct a robustness check of the main data,
as well as being able to include Greece in the analyses.
Because different individuals are interviewed each year
(cross-sections), I cannot address the issue of causality. The
positive association, for example, between subjective health
and satisfaction with life postulates that health impacts on
satisfaction with life, but in reality the causality runs both
ways (Graham & Nikolova, 2014).
Despite what has been said earlier about the reliability
and validity of the dependent variable--satisfaction with
life, there is evidence that respondents tend to downplay
negative circumstances when answering to such questions
in surveys (Ponocny, Weismayer, Stross, & Dressler, 2015).
This does not necessarily affect comparisons over time and
across countries, although giving a too favorable estimate of
the absolute level of satisfaction with life. But there may be
a problem if the tendency to downplay negative circum-
stances differs between various categories of people.
In line with most other comparative studies on changes in
satisfaction with life, this study is based on cross-sectional
data. To develop further changes over time within as well
across countries, panel data (longitudinal data) are much
needed in future research on this topic.
Conclusion
The assumption that economic decline with certainty reduces
satisfaction with life does not find full support in the analy-
ses presented. I have shown that satisfaction with life has
fallen somewhat in the PIGS-countries, Portugal being an
exception. Compared with the reference category, the
changes are small and/or insignificant (overlapping con-
fidence intervals). I hypothesized that Greece who had
the greatest decline in economic activity and a subsequent
increase in unemployment level would have seen the greatest
fall in satisfaction with life. In fact, it was Ireland, where bad
health had a strong negative influence shown by the interac-
tion effects. Furthermore, interaction effects between a
country's unemployment and individual unemployment on
satisfaction with life were strongest in Ireland and Portugal
with lowest level of unemployment, followed by Spain with
high levels of unemployment. As expected, there was a great
interaction effect between political trust and Greece on satis-
faction with life.
Greater socioeconomic inequalities in satisfaction with
life due to the recession from 2004 to 2014 seem to be most
pronounced in Portugal. In addition, I identified socially iso-
lated persons and low educated as being hardest hit by the
crisis. The least satisfied are in the lowest income decile
(Pew Research Center, 2014).
In countries heavily affected by the "Great recession,"
peoples' capabilities have been reduced, resulting in worse
functionings, in particular due to unemployment, lower
incomes, and financial hardship that follow from a reces-
sion and austerity measures. The economic crisis has
resulted in a political crisis and less trust in the political
system/politicians. These factors reduce the freedom to
make life choices, most likely resulting in pessimism about
the future and hopelessness. Surprisingly, I did not found
worse subjective health being a consequence of the reces-
sion. The situation in terms of well-being would have been
worse in these countries if not multilevel resilience had
played a moderating role (by families, NGOs, regions, and
municipalities).
However, lower satisfaction with life can influence nega-
tively on peoples' future health and life chances. Widespread
pessimism about the future may in itself contribute to delay
the reemergence of a healthy economy. The social policy
implications of these findings are apart from the long-term
goal of restoring economic growth and improving employ-
ment possibilities, to strengthen the social protection schemes.
In addition, redistributive income and tax policies would be
helpful for easing the financial burden of poor families.
Fighting corruption and restoring trust in public institutions
will also be necessary, especially in Greece. The very difficult
situation in Spain and Greece in 2013/2014 resulted in a polit-
ical crisis for the traditional political parties, triggering strong
popular support for left-wing parties; Syriza in Greece and
Podemos in Spain--with uncertain political outcomes at the
time of writing.

1. It is an acronym usually referring to the economies of Portugal,
Italy, Greece, and Spain, but due to the European Debt crisis,
Ireland has been associated with the term and replacing Italy
(en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIGS_(economics)).
2. It has to be mentioned that the Finnish economic situation has
worsened since then. The government gross debt has increased
to 63% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015. By some,
Finland is now regarded as the new sick man of Europe with
the worst economy within the EURO-zone (Kahn, 2015).

to be an inherent challenge in that country.

extend the crisis-program after the expiring date February 28,
2015, but had since then yielded to receive new loans.
5. This subjective health variable is strongly associated with the
frequency of self-reported mental problems last week, such as
depression and sadness (European Social Survey [ESS] sev-
enth round 2014).
6. In ESS, financial hardship was measured by this question,
"Feeling about household's income nowadays," with response
alternatives: (a) living comfortably on present income, (b)
coping on present income, (c) difficult on present income, and
(d) Very difficult on present income. In the European Union
Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), it was
asked about "Ability to make ends meet, with response alter-
natives: (a) with great difficulty, (b) with difficulty, (c) with
some difficulty, (d) fairly easy, (e) easily, and (f) very easily.
Those who answered difficult were given code 1, else code 0.
7. Regarded as a watershed: Greece arranged in 2004 the Olympic
Summer Games, and its football team won the European
Championship.

(Ferrer-i-Carbonell & Frijters, 2004).
9. In Spain, the political crisis is still present at the time of writ-
ing: The country has for 6 months been without a permanent
government.
