Congruence of Self-Reported Medications
With Pharmacy Prescription Records in
Low-Income Older Adults
Grace I. L. Caskie, PhD,1 and Sherry L. Willis, PhD1,2
Purpose: This study examined the congruence of self-
reported medications with computerized pharmacy
records. Design and Methods: Pharmacy records
and self-reported medications were obtained for 294
members of a state pharmaceutical assistance pro-
gram who also participated in ACTIVE, a clinical trial
on cognitive training in nondemented elderly per-
sons. The average age of the sample participants was
74.5 years (range ¼ 65­91); 87.8% were fe-
males. Results: Congruence between self-report
and pharmacy data was generally high. Self-reports
omitted drug classes in the pharmacy records less
often than the pharmacy records did not include self-
reported drug classes. The percentage of individuals
with perfect agreement between self-reports and
pharmacy records varied from 49% for major drug
classes to 81% for specific cardiovascular and central
nervous system drugs. Within a drug class, agree-
ment tended to be higher for individuals without
a prescription in that class. Poorer health was
consistently related to poorer self-report of medica-
tions. Implications: Self-reported medications are
most likely to be congruent with pharmacy records
for drugs prescribed for more serious conditions, for
more specific classes of drugs, and for healthier
individuals.
Key Words: Brown bag method, Drug use in elderly
persons, Medication adherence or compliance
Knowing the number and types of medications
that an individual takes can provide information
about the individual's mental and physical health
status and comorbidities (Clark, Von Korff,
Saunders, Baluch, & Simon, 1995) as well as indicate
possible cognitive impairment caused by medication
side effects (Gillin & Byerly, 1990). Obtaining
such information is especially important in studies
of older adults, because of their greater use of
medications and greater likelihood of being treated
for multiple conditions. Medication data are often
collected in research studies by use of a self-report
method known as the ``brown bag'' method (e.g.,
Jobe et al., 2001). With the brown bag method,
participants are asked to collect containers of their
current medications in a brown paper bag and
provide them to research staff. Staff then record the
prescription and nonprescription items. Alternatively,
self-reports of medications have been collected
by means of a written list, a verbal report, or a
medication form (e.g., Gerbert, Stone, Stulbarg,
Gullion, & Greenfield, 1988; Stuart & Grana, 1998).
Regardless of how they are obtained, the utility of
self-reports of current medications depends on the
willingness and ability of the individual to volunteer
such information. A few studies have explored the
validity of patient reports of current medications.
Gurwich (1983) found that self-reported medication
histories were more complete than the physician's
medical chart. In a sample of older adults, Opdycke,
Ascione, Shimp, Boyd, and Malloch (1994) found an
average of 81% agreement for medication name
between self-reported medication histories and the
prescriptions listed in the patients' medical records.
In contrast, Gerbert and colleagues (1988) concluded
that patient reports of medication regimens were

Several influences on the agreement of self-
reported medications with other sources have been
identified. Self-reports tend to be better for medica-
tions taken on a long-term basis or for serious health
conditions (Hulka, Kupper, Cassel, Efird, & Bur-
dette, 1975; Kelly, Rosenberg, Kaufman, & Shapiro,
1990) and for individuals who were younger and had
better functional status (Landry et al., 1988). Hulka,
Cassel, Kupper, and Burdette (1976) also found that
greater scheduling complexity was related to a
greater number of omissions by physicians of medi-
cations in the self-reports.
The comparison of self-reported medications with
more ``objective'' measures warrants the consider-
ation of several methodological issues. Computer-
ized pharmacy records only provide information
about which prescriptions have been filled, not
which medications are actually being taken (Choo
et al., 1999; Christensen et al., 1997). Complex
dosing schedules can also make it difficult to
determine the correct days' supply of a prescription
(Christensen et al., 1997). Finally, many previous
studies on the congruence of ``self'' and ``other''
reports of medications have either used a sample in
which most or all participants were prescribed at
least one medication or have focused on a limited set
of condition-specific medications (e.g., Choo et al.,
1999; Christensen et al., 1997). A study of over 3,000
rural elderly persons (Helling et al., 1987) found that
29% reported taking no prescription drugs, whereas
other individuals were reported up to 13 prescribed
medications. Clearly, the statistical methods used in
prior studies to assess congruence have to be adapted
to accommodate both older adults taking no
medications and those taking a wide variety of
medications. Moreover, when a broader range of
medications is included, decisions must be made
about which classes of drugs should be examined in
greater depth and about the level of therapeutic
classification that should be used.
The present study assessed the congruence be-
tween the brown bag method of obtaining self-
reported medication data and the prescriptions that
had been filled by a sample of older adults, according
to computerized pharmacy records. Self-report
medication data were collected by use of the brown
bag method as part of a multisite clinical trial on
cognitive training, the Advanced Cognitive Training
for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE; Jobe
et al., 2001). Most participants at the Pennsylvania
State University (PSU) site of ACTIVE were recruited
from a state pharmaceutical assistance program, the
Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly
(PACE). As a result, pharmacy claim data were
available for those ACTIVE participants at the PSU
site who were members of PACE. This allowed us to
compare the self-report medication data collected by
means of the brown bag method with prescription
data in the PACE pharmacy records.
This study addressed four research questions in
a sample of low-income older adults who were
prescribed a variety of medications. First, what
proportion of a set of drug classes had congruent
information in the self-reports and pharmacy re-
cords? Second, are discrepancies more likely to be
attributed to omissions by the self-reports or by the
pharmacy records? Third, what individual character-
istics predict congruence (or discrepancies) between
the self-reported medications and the pharmacy
records? Finally, does congruence between self-
reports and the pharmacy data vary by drug class?
These four questions were examined for 10 major
therapeutic drug classes prescribed to this sample of
older adults as well as for specific drug classes within
2 of these major drug classes (i.e., cardiovascular
drugs and central nervous system, or CNS, agents).
Cardiovascular drugs and CNS agents were exam-
ined in greater detail because they are frequently
prescribed to elderly persons and because their
possible cognitive side effects were of particular
interest in a clinical trial on cognitive training.
Methods
Sample
The analysis sample for this study was 294
members of PACE who completed the ACTIVE
group baseline assessment; the included participants
had also been randomized to a treatment group in
either the pilot study or the main study for ACTIVE.
The average age of the sample was 74.5 years (SD ¼
5.7 years; range ¼ 65­91). The sample was pre-
dominantly White (96%) and had a mean income of
$11,335 (SD ¼ $2,817; range ¼ 3,027­19,024).
Women comprised the majority of the sample
(87.8%), and only 17% of the total sample was
currently married. Eighteen participants in the
analysis sample (6%) were enrolled in an extension
of the PACE benefits program that entailed a slightly
higher copayment and a $500 yearly deductible, for
individuals with slightly higher, but still low, in-
comes (less than $17,000 for single persons; less than
$20,200 for married couples).
Medication Data
Two types of medication data were obtained. Self-
reported medication data were collected during the
group baseline testing session for ACTIVE by use of
the brown bag method. Computerized pharmacy
claims for prescription fills and refills were obtained
from PACE for participants for a window of time
that included the date of the brown bag data
collection. Each prescription medication in the PACE
data had a code to indicate its therapeutic purpose;
the American Hospital Formulary Service (AHFS)

codes were used. Each medication had three levels of
AHFS codes, depending on the level of therapeutic
specificity. The first level of the AHFS code indicated
the major therapeutic drug class (e.g., cardiovascular
drugs), and lower levels indicated minor or more
specific therapeutic drug classifications (e.g., beta
blockers). The brown bag medications were coded
with the same AHFS coding system. For both the
PACE pharmacy data and the self-report data,
a participant was given a 0 or 1 for each AHFS
drug class to indicate whether the participant had at
least one medication in that class (i.e., score of 1) or
no medication in that class (i.e., score of 0). Over-
the-counter items (e.g., Tylenol, Aleve, and Mylanta)
were excluded from the brown bag data. Medica-
tions in the PACE pharmacy data whose supply was
estimated to be depleted more than 5 days before the
brown bag assessment were also excluded. Sample
medications may have been included in the brown
bag assessment, but they were not specifically
recorded as samples.
Seven of the 17 major AHFS classes with at least
one prescribed medication were excluded from
further analysis, because the class was prescribed to
or self-reported by less than 5% of the sample. As
shown in Table 1, the percentage of the sample with
at least one medication in a given class was relatively
low for most of the 10 major therapeutic drug classes
examined. The three most prevalent major thera-
peutic drug classes in both data sets were as follows:
(a) cardiovascular drugs (PACE, 59%; self-report,
67%), (b) hormones and synthetic substitutes (PACE,
32%; self-report, 37%), and (c) CNS agents (PACE,
28%; self-report, 34%); these classes have been
found to be among the most commonly prescribed
drugs for elderly persons in prior studies (Johnson &
Moore, 1988; Opdycke et al., 1994). In the self-report
data, the electrolytic, caloric, and water balance class
was reported as frequently as CNS agents.
Cardiovascular drugs and CNS agents were
examined in further detail in this study because of
their possible side effects of cognitive impairment or
confusion, which was of particular interest because
the sample was participating in a study on cognitive
training. The prevalence of the 7 specific classes of
cardiovascular drugs and 3 specific classes of CNS
agents included in this analysis are also presented in
Table 1. The number of major drug classes present
for each individual (in the 10 classes studied) in each
database ranged from 0 to 7 (SD ¼ 1.5 drug classes).
For the 10 major drug classes studied, the pharmacy
records showed that 20% of the sample had no
current prescriptions at the time of the brown bag
data collection, whereas only 10% of the sample self-
reported no current prescriptions.
Measures
Everyday Problems Test.--The Everyday Prob-
lems Test (EPT) assessed problem solving and
reasoning in everyday situations encountered by
older adults. Participants were presented with 14
everyday stimulus materials (e.g., medication labels,
transportation schedules, and a Medicare benefit
chart) and used the information in the materials to
solve two problems per stimulus. The stimulus and
problems represented seven instrumental activities of
daily living (IADL) domains. The test was untimed.
The EPT has been shown in prior research to have
high internal consistency, test­retest reliability, and
structural stability (Willis & Marsiske, 1993). The
score was the number of correct answers (score
range: 0­28).
Mini-Mental State Examination.--Performance
on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE;
Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975) served as an
indicator of general mental status. All ACTIVE
participants scored greater than 22 on the MMSE as
a condition of their inclusion in the study. Thus, all
participants had MMSE scores between 23 and 30.
Short Form-36 General Health Score.--The
Short Form-36 (SF-36) is a self-report instrument of
health and the impact of health on functioning and

quality of life (Ware & Sherbourne, 1992). The
general health subscale score tapped perceptions
about current health and health changes. General
health scores ranged from 15 to 100 in this sample,
with an average of 65.24 (SD ¼ 19.19). Two
participants did not complete this scale.
Visual Acuity.--An in-person visual acuity test
was performed prior to baseline testing (Rubin &
Salive, 1995). Participants who self-reported extreme
difficulty with reading ordinary newspaper print or
with a performance-tested vision score worse than
20/50 were excluded from participation in ACTIVE.
Measures of Congruence
Several measures of congruence between PACE
pharmacy records and the self-report data were
calculated in this study. Each measure addresses
a somewhat different question regarding congruence.
These measures are described in the paragraphs that
follow, and scores for three hypothetical cases are
presented in Table 2. Two measures of congruence
(agreement and omission­commission) provided in-
formation at the level of the individual and thus
permitted examination of predictors of congruence
at the individual level. The remaining two measures
(percent agreement and kappa coefficient) provided
information about congruence at the aggregate level
for a given drug class.
Agreement Score.--This score provided the pro-
portion of information that was identical in the
PACE pharmacy records and the self-report data
(Opdycke et al., 1994). Scores ranged from 0 (no
agreement) to 1 (total agreement) and were calcu-
lated with the following formula:
Agreement score
¼ ðNumber of agreements between PACE and brown
bag dataÞ=Number of drug classes compared:
Because we were interested in the pattern of
congruence for either the absence or the presence of
medications within a defined set of drug classes, the
denominator in this equation (i.e., the number of
drug classes compared) was a constant value for all
individuals. This practice differed from previous
studies in which the denominator varied for each
person, depending on the total number of drug
classes reported in either data source. For example,
for all of the hypothetical cases shown in Table 2,
our study used a denominator of 10 (i.e., the total
number of drug classes compared), as opposed to
denominator values of 6, 5, and 0, respectively,
which would have represented only the (different)
number of drug classes present in the data for that
person. This practice also allowed agreement
scores to be calculated for those with no current
medications (e.g., the third drug pattern shown in
Table 2).
One benefit of the agreement score is that the
same overall measure of the agreement could be used
for each person, despite differences in the medica-
tions being taken by individuals. Another benefit is
that, unlike the percent agreement and the kappa
coefficient described in the paragraphs that follow,
an agreement score was generated for each person
rather than as a sample statistic. However, because
the agreement score does not define one data source
as more accurate (i.e., a ``gold standard''), it does not
indicate which source is the cause of any disagree-
ment between the two databases. Rather, the source
of discrepancies is addressed with an analysis of
omission and commission scores, described next.
Omission and Commission Error Scores.--These
scores provided information about the source of
reporting errors that may be responsible for
disagreements between the self-reports and the
pharmacy records. Scores were calculated on a per
person basis, with values of 0 indicating no error,
that is, none of the drugs in one source were omitted
by the other source, and a value of 1 representing
100% error, that is, all of the drugs in one source
were omitted by the other source (Hulka et al., 1975,
1976; Opdycke et al., 1994). The three types of
matches­mismatches between the two data sources
that are considered in this method are described in
Table 3. Because we were considering congruence in
a set of drug classes that were relevant to this

sample, individuals with no prescription drugs were
given scores of 0 to avoid removing them from the
analysis (e.g., see the third drug pattern in Table 2).
Percent Agreement.--We calculated an overall
percent agreement as the percentage of the total
sample whose self-report data were congruent with
the PACE data. For a particular drug class, this value
included congruence either for the presence or the
absence of a prescription within that drug class. This
type of measure was used in a previous evaluation of
self-reported medications with the PACE population
(Landry et al., 1988). We also computed two
additional, more specific percent agreement values.
First, for cases that had a prescription in a given drug
class in the PACE data, the proportion of individuals
who also reported that drug class in the brown bag
data was calculated as the ``percent agreement for
cases with a prescription.'' Second, for cases that did
not have a prescription in a given drug class in the
PACE data, the proportion of individuals who also
did not report that drug class in the brown bag data
was calculated as the ``percent agreement for cases
without a prescription.''
Kappa Coefficient.--The kappa coefficient is
a measure of agreement between the classifications
made by two independent data sources and takes
into account the agreement expected by chance
(Gerbert et al., 1988; Wickens, 1989). Values range
from 0 to 1; higher values indicate greater agreement.
The classifications examined from the two data
sources were whether or not a drug class had been
reported (yes or no) by that source for a particular
individual.
Results
Four main research questions were investigated in
this study. First, the proportion of a set of drug
classes that were congruent for each individual
between the self-report data and the pharmacy
records was examined; agreement scores were used
for this analysis. Second, the source of any discrep-
ancies between self-reports and pharmacy records
was investigated with an analysis of omission and
commission error scores. Third, predictors of the
agreement and discrepancies between the self-report
data and the pharmacy data were considered.
Finally, the congruence (using percent agreement
and kappa) between the self-report data and the
pharmacy records was explored within each of 10
major drug classes and additionally for 10 specific
drug classes (i.e., 7 specific cardiovascular drug
classes and 3 CNS drug classes).
Congruence Between Self-Report Data and
Pharmacy Records: Across Drug Class
In this section, we examined the proportion of
a set of drug classes with congruent information
between the two databases. We calculated three
agreement scores for each individual, comparing the
following sets of drug classes separately: (a) 10 major
drug classes, (b) 7 specific cardiovascular drug
classes, and (c) 3 specific CNS drug classes.
Major Drug Classes.--An average of 91%
agreement (i.e., 9 of 10 classes) between the self-
report and pharmacy records was found for the 10
major drug classes included (SD ¼ 11.3%). Almost
half (49%) of the sample had perfect (100%)
agreement between their self-report data and the
pharmacy records. Although agreement scores
ranged from 50% to 100%, indicating that only half
of the 10 classes were congruent for some individ-
uals, 91.8% of the sample had congruent informa-
tion for at least 8 of the 10 classes.
Specific Cardiovascular Drug Classes.--An aver-
age of 96.4% agreement (i.e., 6.7 of 7 classes) was
observed for the 7 specific cardiovascular drug
classes (SD ¼ 9.0%). Agreement scores ranged from
43% to 100%, with 81% of the sample having
perfect (100%) agreement between the two data-
bases. Ninety-seven percent of the sample had
congruent information for 6 of the 7 specific cardio-
vascular drug classes.
Specific CNS Drug Classes.--An average of
92.7% agreement (i.e., 2.8 of 3 classes) was found

and 97% had congruent information for at least 2

Source of Discrepancies Between
Self-Reports and Pharmacy Records
To determine the source of the discrepancies
between the self-reported medications and the
pharmacy records, we next calculated an omission
error score, a commission error score, and a com-
bined error score for each individual in three
domains: (a) 10 major drug classes, (b) 7 specific
cardiovascular drug classes, and (c) 3 specific CNS
drug classes.
Major Drug Classes.--On average, study partic-
ipants did not report 7% of the major drug classes
contained in their pharmacy records. The pharmacy
records did not include an average of 24% of the
major drug classes that were self-reported. The
average combined error rate was 28%, with the
majority of the discrepancies resulting when in-
formation about current prescriptions taken from
the pharmacy records did not include drug classes
that the individual had self-reported. However, all
classes found in the pharmacy records were self-
reported by 84% of the sample, and pharmacy
records had information about all classes in the self-
report data for 58% of the sample.
Specific Cardiovascular Drug Classes.--The
average rate of omissions was 1% for self-reports
of medications in the seven specific cardiovascular
drug classes; only 5 individuals did not report all
cardiovascular drug classes present for them in the
pharmacy records. Although an average of 13% of
self-reported specific cardiovascular drug classes was
not included in the pharmacy records, pharmacy
records had information on all self-reported cardio-
vascular drugs (i.e., 0% error rate) for 82% of the
sample. The average combined error rate for
cardiovascular drug classes was 13.5%, with most
discrepancies occurring when the information drawn
from the pharmacy records did not include a cardio-
vascular drug class that had been self-reported.
Specific CNS Drug Classes.--Self-reports of
medications in three specific CNS drug classes
omitted an average of 5% of the specific CNS drug
classes found in the pharmacy records, whereas
pharmacy records reported an average of 13% fewer
CNS classes than the self-report data. However, the
percentages of the sample with no errors of omission
(94%) and with no errors of commission (87%) were
quite high. The average combined error rate for CNS
drug classes was 17%, with the majority of the
discrepancies occurring when the information drawn
from the pharmacy records did not include a class
that had been self-reported.
Predictors of Agreement­Disagreement Between
the Self-Report and Pharmacy Data
Linear regression analyses examined predictors of
three person-level outcomes: (a) agreement score
(i.e., congruence between self-reports and pharmacy
data for a set of drug classes), (b) omission error
score (i.e., self-reports omitted a drug class included
in the pharmacy records), and (c) commission error
score (i.e., pharmacy records omitted a drug class
included in the self-reports). Analyses were per-
formed for these outcome variables in three
domains: (a) 10 major drug classes, (b) 7 specific
cardiovascular drug classes, and (c) 3 specific CNS
drug classes. Predictors included demographic vari-
ables (gender, marital status, age, and income) as
well as measures of cognitive and physical function-
ing. Cognitive variables included the EPT and the
MMSE; physical functioning variables were the
SF-36 General Health subscale and a vision score.
Results of the regression analyses are presented in
Table 4.
Major Drug Classes.--For the 10 major drug
classes, marital status, income, and general health
significantly predicted agreement between the two
medication databases. Participants who were mar-
ried, had lower income, and better general health
were more likely to have self-report data that agreed
with the pharmacy records. Marital status and
general health were also significant predictors of
errors of omission. Participants who were married
and in better health were less likely to omit drug
classes included in the pharmacy records. Marital
status was the only significant predictor of errors of
commission. Married participants were less likely to
report a drug class that was not included in the
pharmacy records.
Cardiovascular Drug Classes.--General health
was the only significant predictor of agreement (p ,
.01) and errors of commission (p , .05) for the seven
specific cardiovascular classes. Individuals with
better health had better agreement between their
self-report data and the PACE pharmacy records for
cardiovascular drug classes and were less likely to
report a drug class that was not found in the
pharmacy records. No significant predictors of errors
of omission were found.
CNS Drug Classes.--Gender (p , .05) and
general health (p , .01) were significant predictors
of the amount of agreement for the three CNS drug
classes. Male participants and those in better health
Vol. 44, No. 2, 2004 181
had higher levels of agreement for CNS drugs. The
EPT was the only significant predictor of errors of
omission for CNS drug classes (p , .001). Individ-
uals with better everyday problem-solving skills were
less likely to omit CNS drug classes included in the
pharmacy records. General health was the only
significant predictor of errors of commission for
CNS drug classes (p , .05). Having poorer general
health was related to a greater proportion of self-
reported drug classes that were not being represented
in information taken from the pharmacy records.
Congruence Between Self-Report Data and
Pharmacy Records: Within Drug Class
In this section of results, we examined congruence
separately within (a) each of the 10 major drug
classes, (b) each of the 7 specific cardiovascular drug
classes, and (c) each of the 3 specific CNS drug
classes. Congruence (i.e., percent agreement) was
investigated in three ways. First, what proportion of
the total sample has congruent information (i.e.,
both PACE and the self-report data were coded 0 or
both were coded 1)? Second, of cases with a pre-
scription in a drug class in the pharmacy records
(i.e., PACE ¼ 1), what proportion also self-report
that drug class? Third, of cases without a prescription
in a drug class in the pharmacy records (i.e., PACE ¼
0), what proportion also did not self-report that drug
class? These results are presented in Table 5.
Major Drug Classes.--As shown in Table 5, the
overall percent agreement (i.e., for the presence or
absence of a particular drug class) was high for all 10
major therapeutic drug classes studied, ranging from
83.0% to 96.6%. For cases in which a prescription
for a drug class was found in the pharmacy records,
the percent agreement was also relatively high (63.6­
99.4%), except for anti-infective agents (29.4%). For
cases in which no prescriptions for a drug class were
found in the pharmacy records, the agreement
between the self-report and pharmacy data was
generally high (80.8­98.2%). The kappa coefficients
for all 10 classes were significant at a 95% level of
confidence, indicating significantly more agreement
between the two databases than would be expected
by chance.
Cardiovascular Drug Classes.--Table 5 shows
that the overall percent agreement values for the
seven specific cardiovascular classes were all high
(95.2­98.3%). The percent agreement was also high
both for cases with a medication in the specific class
and for cases without a medication in that class in
the pharmacy records. As shown in Table 5, all
percent agreement values for cardiovascular classes
were over 93%, and several had 100% agreement.
The kappa coefficients for all of the specific
cardiovascular classes showed significant agreement
(p , .05) between the self-reported medications and
the pharmacy records.
CNS Drug Classes.--Table 5 shows that the
overall percent agreement values for the three
specific CNS drug classes were high (91.8­93.9%).
Agreement was also high for cases without a medi-
cation in the specific class in the pharmacy records
(93.3­96.8%). The percent agreement was lower for
cases with a medication in these classes in the
pharmacy records. For nonsteroidal anti-inflamma-
tory drugs (NSAIDs) and benzodiazepines, the values
were good, at 84.6% and 76.9%, respectively.
However, only 18.2% of those with a prescription
for opiate agonists in the PACE data self-reported
that drug class. It must be noted, however, that the

prevalence of opiate agonists was very low in the
total sample (3.7%, or 11 participants), and thus this
discrepancy actually represented only 9 participants
who did not self-report an opiate agonist but had
a prescription for this type of drug in the pharmacy
data. The kappa coefficients for all specific CNS
classes, except opiate agonists, showed significant
agreement (p , .05) between the self-reported
medications and the pharmacy records.
Discussion
This study investigated the congruence between
self-reports of medications obtained by use of the
brown bag method and information about current
medications taken from pharmacy records (i.e.,
PACE data) for a sample of low-income, rural
elderly persons. This sample was of particular
interest given their high rate of health problems,
limitations in access to health care, and often limited
education. The results indicated generally high levels
of agreement across 10 major drug classes and across
the specific cardiovascular and CNS drug classes
examined. We also found that the brown bag data
omitted drug classes found in the pharmacy records
less often than the pharmacy records did not include
information about drug classes that had been self-
reported. However, it is important to note that the
pharmacy records included all self-reported major
drug classes for more than half the sample and
included all self-reported cardiovascular and CNS
drugs for over 80% of the sample. An analysis of
predictors of agreement and discrepancies between
the self-report and pharmacy data indicated that
general health status was an important factor to
consider. Better health was related to higher levels of
agreement across the 10 major drug classes, across
the 7 specific cardiovascular drug classes, and across
the 3 specific CNS drug classes. Better health also
predicted that fewer major drug classes would be
omitted by the self-report data and that fewer
specific cardiovascular and CNS drug classes would
be self-reported that were not found in the pharmacy
records.
Finally, within each drug class, high congruence
was found for the total sample and for the subsample
of individuals who did not have a prescription filled
for a particular drug class. For individuals with
a prescription medication in a drug class, very high
agreement was found for reporting specific cardio-
vascular drug classes, confirming previous research
findings that drugs for serious conditions are more
likely to be reported (Hulka et al., 1975; Kelly et al.,
1990). Medications taken for less serious conditions
or taken on an intermittent or short-term basis are

less likely to be reported (Kelly et al., 1990). In this
study, the percent agreement for antihistamines,
anti-infective agents, eye, ear, nose, and throat
preparations, and opiate agonists was lower than
the percent agreement found within the other major
and specific CNS drug classes for those who were
prescribed a medication in one of those classes.
The congruence of pharmacy records and self-
reported medication use is an important issue
because self-reports of medications are frequently
used as a proxy for health status or the presence of
chronic diseases as well as to study topics such as
medication compliance, polypharmacy, and drug
interactions. Self-reports of medications are often
used in population-based studies (e.g., the Iowa 65þ
Rural Health Study), where pharmacy records are
lacking or expensive to obtain. Although self-report
measures are widely used, few studies have examined
the congruence of prescription records and self-
report measures, and the samples available for such
studies have often been limited and unique.
One typically validates self-report data by com-
paring them to an objective, gold standard measure.
However, to have a gold standard measure of cur-
rent prescriptions, individuals would need to obtain
all medications through a single source, and all
medications received (including samples) would have
to be included in the database. In the current medical
climate, where individuals are likely to have multiple
sources for prescription coverage and multiple
physicians, obtaining a gold standard measure of
prescription medications is not likely. Thus, our
analysis has emphasized the comparison of two
sources of information about current prescription
medications, rather than the absolute accuracy of
either source. For example, although we utilized
a method termed ``error analysis'' to investigate
differences between the two databases, we discussed
the ``errors'' as discrepancies or disagreements be-
tween two potentially incomplete sources of in-
formation about the same domain.
We believe the current study makes several
contributions to the prior literature with respect to
the measurement of the congruence of self-report
and pharmacy records. First, congruence was exam-
ined both at the level of the individual and at the
aggregate level, across drug categories and within
both major and specific drug categories. Measure-
ment of congruence at the individual level led to
a second contribution of the study--the examination
of person characteristics as predictors of congruence
between self-reports and prescription records. In-
formation on predictors could be useful in studies
that only use self-report measures by indicating
subsamples whose self-report might be expected to
differ from pharmacy records. A final contribution
of the study was the examination of congruence not
only for individuals in the sample who take
medications, but also for the significant proportion
of community-dwelling, young-old elderly who take
no medications. Although prior studies have often
focused on participants who take medications, it is
well known that, in community-dwelling popula-
tions, a proportion of elderly persons take no
medications. In the current study, pharmacy records
indicated that 20% of the sample had no current
prescriptions, whereas the self-report data indicated
10% with no current prescriptions. However,
a comprehensive study of congruence requires
examining congruence not only for participants
who take medications but also for those who do not.
This study had several limitations. First, the
sample was relatively small and of low socioeco-
nomic status and consisted of primarily women.
Second, all participants participated in a prescription
coverage program, which may increase the likeli-
hood that medical conditions would be treated with
prescription medications (Stuart & Grana, 1998).
Third, congruence was examined at the level of the
drug class rather than at the level of the actual
medication. It is possible that some discrepancies
were not detected with our analysis. For example,
multiple medications within a drug class would have
been coded as a ``yes'' for that class, although only
one of these medications may have been self-
reported. Finally, using computerized pharmacy
records as a proxy for current medications can be
problematic (Choo et al., 1999; Christensen et al.,
1997).
Specifically in this study, an individual's current
medications in the PACE pharmacy data were based
on the prescribed days' supply and the date of the
prescription fill or refill. Individuals who did not use
their medications as often as directed by their
physician may account for some of the discrepancies
observed between the self-report data and the
pharmacy records. For example, if elderly persons
take a lower dosage than prescribed and extend their
supply of the drug, medications might be included in
the brown bag beyond their prescribed dosing
window. Such noncompliance may explain why
10% of the sample had no current pharmacy records
for prescription refills but reported taking one or
more current medications. Days' supply can also be
difficult to determine for medications taken on an
``as needed'' basis, such as opiate agonists. The use
of a class-specific window may have improved
congruence for such classes. The elderly individuals
may also be obtaining medications that are not
recorded in the prescription records. A survey of
PACE recipients found that approximately 29% have
other prescription coverage (Pennsylvania Depart-
ment of Aging, 2002). In addition, health care
professionals often provide patients, particularly
low-income patients, with medication samples,
suggesting that they try the medication before
a prescription is written. Or, the elderly persons
may use medications prescribed for friends or family
members (Johnson & Moore, 1988). Medications
not obtained through PACE would not be recorded
184 The Gerontologist
in the pharmacy claims data and could have falsely
inflated the discrepancies between the PACE phar-
macy data and the self-reports.
In summary, the findings of this study have several
implications for the use of the brown bag method to
collect medication information. We believe the
brown bag method provides a reasonable substitute
for pharmacy records as a measure of current
medications. One must consider several factors,
however, when using the brown bag method. First,
congruence of brown bag data and pharmacy
records may vary by the type and prevalence of the
medication being considered. Medications for more
serious conditions or that are taken on a long-term
basis are more likely to be reported than medications
taken on an as needed basis, for a short duration, or
for less serious conditions. Furthermore, medications
taken in forms other than by mouth (e.g., by
transcutaneous patch) may be less likely to be
reported with the brown bag method. Second,
whether a general drug class (e.g., CNS agents),
a more specific drug class (e.g., opiate agonists), or
a set of drug classes is being considered may
influence congruence. Although congruence was
generally high, the best agreement tended to be
found within a specific drug class rather than within
a major drug class or for the overall pattern of all
drug classes for an individual. Third, the congruence
of self-reports for prescribed medications was better
for more prevalent classes (e.g., cardiovascular
drugs). Finally, the investigation of predictors of
agreement between the brown bag data and the
pharmacy data revealed that those individuals with
worse health consistently had poorer congruence.
Future research on the congruence of brown bag
data with pharmacy records should include an
investigation of reasons why drugs are omitted from
both self-reports and pharmacy records as well as an
examination of the congruence and stability of
brown bag data over time.
