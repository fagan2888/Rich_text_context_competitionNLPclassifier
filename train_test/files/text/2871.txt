Non-technical Summary
Do established relationships in the interbank market help banks mitigating liquidity
shortages? Does relationship lending in the interbank market contain banks' costs of liquidity
provision? In this paper we try to shed some light on these questions using data on German
banks' individual bids in the ECB's main refinancing operations that were held until October
8, 2008 as variable rate tenders, i.e. as pay-your-bid auctions. These auctions are the key
source of liquidity for the banking sector in the Euro area as a whole. From an individual
bank's perspective, an alternative source of liquidity is the interbank market. Thus the
willingness to pay for liquidity by an individual bank in the ECB's auctions is a good
indicator for the opportunity cost each bidding bank faces when covering its liquidity needs.
We match the bidding data on the individual bank level with various bank characteristics
measuring, for example, bank health, size and liquidity status. Most importantly, however, we
use data from the German credit register (Millionen-Kredit-Evidenz Statistik) to identify
interbank credit relationships. As measures for the intensity of an existing interbank credit
relationship of a borrowing bank, we use the largest share of financing provided by a single
lender relative to the bank's overall interbank borrowing. To measure the diversification in
interbank borrowing we use the number of banks from which an individual financial
institution received credit in the previous quarter. As an indirect measure, we employ the
interconnectedness of a bank in the money market, where we calculate the centrality of an
individual bank in the network of interbank credit relations. This indicator measures how
intense a bank is linked to other banks that themselves have many interbank connections. We
calculate this measure for both lenders and borrowers. First we assess to what extent an
individual bank is lending to many other banks, in particular to those that are themselves
central lenders to the rest of the banking system. Second we also derive to what extent a bank
is borrowing from many banks that are themselves central borrowers in the interbank market,
i.e. borrowing from many other banks.
We find that banks that are more dependent on a single lender in the interbank market
tend to bid more aggressively, i.e. place higher bids in the auctions, and pay a higher price for
liquidity in the auction. Similarly banks that have a multitude of established banking relations,
i.e. a higher number of interbank lenders, bid less aggressively and pay a lower price for
liquidity in the auctions. Thus, in contrast to the findings in corporate finance, our results
suggest that concentration in interbank lending relationships does not help mitigate
borrowers' costs of overcoming liquidity shortages. Quite the contrary, having a large
portfolio of established lending relationships seems to help banks meeting their liquidity
requirements more efficiently. Interestingly, we also find some evidence that a bank that
predominantly lends to a money center bank in the interbank market, i.e. a bank that is itself
lending to many other banks, bids more aggressively in the auctions and ultimately also pays
a higher price for liquidity in the auctions. Thus banks that have large exposures to the key
lenders in the money market tend to pay a higher price for liquidity, which suggest that they
pay a risk premium because they are more exposed to systemic risk. However, central
borrowers paid a lower price particularly during the recent financial crisis. This is consistent
with the fact that established borrowing relationships with money center banks (that were
likely too big to fail) ensured a better intermediated access to liquidity. The effects of
network position, while statistically significant and generally robust to changes in
specification, are usually very small, whereas the relationship effects of the direct links are
larger and more consistent before and during the crisis.
Nicht-technische Zusammenfassung
Helfen etablierte Kreditbeziehungen am Interbankenmarkt Banken dabei,
Liquiditätsengpässe besser zu bewältigen? Gibt es so etwas wie relationship lending am
Interbankenmarkt, das es Banken erlaubt, ihren Liquiditäsbedarf günstiger zu decken? In
diesem Papier nutzen wir die Gebote deutscher Banken in den Offenmarktoperationen des
ESZB, um diesen Fragen nachzugehen. Bis Oktober 2008 wurden diese Operationen als
Zinstender durchgeführt. D.h., Banken mussten die Zinssätze, die sie im Rahmen der Auktion
für Liquidität boten, auch zahlen. Für den Europäischen Bankensektor insgesamt waren diese
Hauptrefinanzierungs-geschäfte die wesentliche Quelle für Liquidität. Aus
Einzelbankperspektive stellt der Interbankenmarkt eine alternative Möglichkeit der
Liquiditätsbeschaffung dar. Die Zahlungsbereitschaft einer Bank für Liquidität in den
Auktionen ist daher eine gutes Maß für ihre Opportunitätskosten der Liquiditätsbeschaffung
im Interbankenmarkt.
Aus anderen Statistiken ordnen wir den Bietungsdaten der verschiedenen Banken weitere
Bankcharakteristika bspw. bezüglich der Stabilität, Größe und Liquiditätsausstattung zu.
Zudem nutzen wir die Informationen aus der Millionen-Kredit-Evidenz Statistik der
Deutschen Bundesbank, um bilaterale Interbankkreditbeziehungen zu identifizieren und zu
messen. Als Maß für die Intensität einer etablierten Kreditbeziehung am Interbankenmarkt
nutzen wir den Anteil der Kreditvergabe des größten Kreditgebers einer Bank an den
gesamten Interbankverbindlichkeiten der Schuldnerbank. Die Diversifikation der
Interbankenkreditbeschaffung einer Bank messen wir anhand der Zahl ihrer Gläubigerbanken
im vergangen Quartal. Als ein weiteres, indirektes Maß für Interbankenkreditverflechtung
berechnen wir für jede Bank das sog. Zentralitätsmaß. Dieser Indikator misst, wie intensive
eine Bank mit anderen Banken verflochten ist, insbesondere mit solchen, die selbst wiederum
zentral für das Netzwerk der Interbankkreditverflechtung sind. Wir berechnen dieses Maß
sowohl für die Kreditvergabe als auch die Kreditaufnahme am Interbankenmarkt und messen
so einerseits, inwieweit eine Bank Kreditgeber für viele andere Banken ist - gerade für solche,
die selbst zentrale Kreditgeber für den Rest des Bankensektor sind. Anderseits bestimmen
wir, in welchem Maße eine Bank von vielen Banken Kredit aufnimmt, insbesondere von
solchen die selbst wiederum zentrale Kreditnehmer im Interbankennetzwerk sind, d.h. die
selbst wiederum von vielen anderen Banken Kredite aufnehmen.
Unsere Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Banken, die stark von einem Kreditgeber am
Interbankenmarkt abhängig sind, aggressiver in den Ofenmarktoprationen agieren. Sie bieten
einen höheren Zins und zahlen im Durchschnitt damit mehr für Liquidität. Dagegen bieten
Banken, die eine Mehrzahl von Kreditbeziehungen am Interbankenmarkt etabliert haben,
weniger aggressive und können ihren Liquiditätsbedarf damit günstiger in den Auktionen
decken. Entgegen der üblichen Resultate aus der Unternehmensfinanzierung deuten unsere
Ergebnisse somit an, dass durch eine enge Konzentration der Kreditbeziehungen auf einen
Gläubiger die Überbrückung von Liquiditätsengpässen eher teurer wird. Eine Vielzahl von
etablierten Kreditbeziehungen macht es dagegen für Banken einfacher, ihren
Liquiditätsbedarf kostengünstig zu decken. Interessanterweise finden wir darüber hinaus, dass
Banken aggressiver in den Auktionen bieten und letztlich mehr für Liquidität zahlen, wenn sie
insbesondere mit zentralen Intermediären im Interbankenmarkt Kreditbeziehungen
unterhalten, d.h. Liquidität vor allem an Banken verleihen, die selbst wiederum Kreditnehmer
von einer Vielzahl anderer Banken sind. Dies legt die Vermutung nahe, dass solche Banken
eine erhöhte Kreditrisikoprämie aufgrund des systemischen Risikos bezahlen. Dagegen war
die Zahlungsbereitschaft für Liquidität von zentralen Kreditnehmern im Interbankennetzwerk
in den Offenmarktauktionen vor allem zu Beginn der Krisenperiode geringer. Dies deutet
darauf hin, dass sich Banken, die insbesondere ihren Liquiditätsbedarf über Kredit von
zentralen Intermediären am Geldmarkt deckt, günstiger refinanzieren konnten, da sie so auch
verbesserten indirekten Zugang zu Liquidität haben. Insgesamt zeigt sich, dass die
Zentralitätsmaße zwar einen statistisch signifikanten und robusten Einfluss haben, ihr
ökonomischer Effekt aber gering ist. Dagegen ist der Einflüsse direkter etablierter
Kreditbeziehungen auf die Zahlungsbereitschaft für Liquidität auch ökonomisch weit
deutlicher und konsistenter vor und während der Krise.

Abstract
In this paper, we focus on the interconnectedness of banks and the price they pay for liquidity.
We assess how the concentration of credit relationships and the position of a bank in the
network topology of the system influence the bank's ability to meet its liquidity demand. We
use quarterly data of bilateral interbank credit exposures between all German banks from
2000 to 2008 to measure interbank relationships and the network characteristics. We match
these data with the bids placed by the individual banks in the European Central Bank's (ECB)
weekly repo auctions. The bids measure each bank's willingness to pay for liquidity since
they had variable rate tenders with a "pay-your-bid" price. Controlling for bank characteristics
and the daily fulfillment of reserve requirements, we find that banks with a more diversified
borrowing structure in the interbank market bid significantly less aggressively and pay a
lower price for liquidity in the ECB's main refinancing operations. These findings suggest
that incentives to diversify bank liquidity risk dominate the benefits of private information.
When the network position of the bank is taken into account, we find that central lenders in
the money market bid more aggressively in the auctions.

1 Introduction
A key strategy of the G20 for strengthening financial stability is to focus tighter
regulatory requirements on financial institutions considered to be too big or too connected to
fail. The recommended regulatory changes strive to contain the moral hazard resulting from
the implicit insurance for investors. Indicators of the systemic importance of a bank typically
include both claims against the bank and claims that it holds against other financial
institutions.1 The failure of a bank clearly imposes costs on its creditors, but why should its
failure also impose costs on its borrowers?
The key reason that borrowers in the interbank market can suffer from a failure of their
lender lies in the fact that relationships and private information matter. As Rochet and Tirole
(1996) argue, private information and peer monitoring play an important role in interbank
markets. If private information acquired through lending relationships allows an interbank
lender to better assess the credit risk of his counterparty, borrowers of good quality should
receive cheaper funding from their interbank relationship lender than from other banks. The
failure of an interbank relationship lender results in the loss of valuable private information.
The borrower bank might not be able to receive funding in the interbank market from other
sources or might be able to receive it only at a mark-up. This difficulty might ultimately even
lead to the failure of the borrower. Thus if relationship lending prevails in interbank markets,
financial contagion not only affects lenders through credit default, it also endangers the
stability of borrowers through the loss of information about them. Questions on the extent of
private information and relationships in the interbank market are central to assessing the costs
of a systemic bank failure.
On the other hand, a borrower will receive liquidity at favourable rates from his
relationship lender only if the lender has the excess liquidity to lend. Consequently, in order to
1 See, for example, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2011).
1
ensure a higher probability of receiving liquidity from informed lenders, banks might prefer
establishing multiple credit relationships.2 Moreover, a more diversified network of
relationship lenders can mitigate the lock-in that might lead to higher borrowing costs.3
Being connected has implications for a bank that extend beyond simple relationship
structures and access to private information about the banks with which they are immediately
connected. Borrowing from a lender with a well-diversified network of lenders might ensure
that the lender can also provide liquidity even though he has no excess reserves available
himself. He might serve as an intermediary in the interbank market borrowing liquidity to
lend it to other counterparties. But this intermediation in the interbank market also bring about
systemic risk: As Allen and Gale (2000), Furfine (1999 and 2003), and others point out, a
lending relationship exposes a bank not only to its immediate counterparty, but also to those
counterparties that the bank's counterparty is exposed to. While these secondary links are not
subject to the same monitoring that the primary relationship loans are, both types of links will
expose the bank's lenders to systemic risks that should add to the cost of borrowing on the
interbank market.
In this paper, we focus on relationships and connectedness in the interbank market and
the price banks pay for liquidity. We try to assess the extent to which the concentration of a
particular relationship or the multitude of established credit relationships influence banks'
costs of meeting their liquidity demand. Using the structure of the interbank credit network,
we can also identify banks that are central to the interbank market. This allows us to study the
extent to which banks can cover their liquidity needs more cheaply if they rely primarily on
the liquidity provision of money center banks. Furthermore, we use the centrality measures to
estimate whether a bank's exposure to systemic risk increases its borrowing costs.
2 Ashcraft and Duffie (2007) provide evidence for this argument for the U.S. money market.
3 See Petersen and Rajan (1995) for a framework of credit market competition in bank-firm relationships.
2
Our data are particularly well suited to the question of the value of relationships in
interbank lending markets. First, we use credit register data, which show exposures of the
interbank market for long maturities as well as short maturities. These data contrast with
lending data backed out from payments data using the Furfine (1999) approach. We have all
of the loan exposures of the German banks, whereas often the Furfine approach will miss
loans of longer maturities. Moreover, the longer maturities are especially good at indicating a
relationship between a bank and its lenders. Since they expose lenders to greater credit risk,
lenders will be more careful in granting longer-term loans. Furthermore, lenders can monitor
borrowers over the longer course of the loans and get regular information about how the
borrowers meet their obligations in a wide variety of conditions. Thus the information
advantage of lenders increases through longer-term loans. We are aware that the demand
schedule for short-term secured funding may be quite different than the longer term unsecured
funding. When exploring the correlations between changes in borrowed amount at ECB
auctions and the amounts borrowed form peers, we see that they may be complements rather
than substitutes. This might reflect the fact that banks with established credit relationships in
the interbank market have access to sufficiently cheap and long-term liquidity such that they
do not need to demand liquidity from the ECB. Thus the information structure on
relationships that we use as a proxy can be expected to influence the price for short-term
liquidity, and consequently the bidding behavior at ECB auctions.
We match the quarterly data of bilateral interbank credit exposures between all German
banks from 2000/6 to 2008/3, taken from the credit register data of the Deutsche Bundesbank,
to the bids placed by the individual banks in the European Central Bank's (ECB) weekly repo
auctions. Since the main refinancing operations were held during our sample period as
variable rate tenders and "pay-your-bid" auctions, they reveal each individual bank's
willingness to pay for liquidity. Indeed, an important contribution of our study is that our
bidding data give us an insight into the bidding banks' entire demand for short-run liquidity.
3
We can directly observe each individual bank's liquidity demand schedule where other
studies relying solely on bilateral interbank lending have difficulty separating demand and
supply effects when studying the impact of lending relationships..
, We find that banks with more concentrated borrowing in the interbank market bid
significantly more aggressively in the ECB's refinancing operations, controlling for bank
characteristics. This suggests that incentives of diversifying bank liquidity risk play a more
important role than benefits of relationships. When the entire network with all of the
connections are taken into account, banks with a higher centrality in lending, i.e. banks that
lend to many banks that are themselves central to the money market, tend to bid more
aggressively in auctions. This might suggest that due to their higher systemic risk exposure
these banks pay a higher risk premium when facing a liquidity shortage themselves. However,
central borrowers paid a lower price particularly during the recent financial crisis. This is
consistent with the fact that established borrowing relationships with money center banks
(that were likely too big to fail) ensured a better intermediated access to liquidity. Those
banks with close borrowing relationships to money center banks had a reduced the value of
liquidity and bid less aggressively. The effects of network position, while statistically
significant and generally robust to changes in specification, are usually very small, whereas
the relationship effects of the direct links are larger and more consistent before and during the
crisis.
Our paper is related to a number of empirical studies that investigate the importance of
private information and relationship lending in the interbank market. Cocco, Gomes, and
Martins (2009) find evidence for the Portuguese interbank market that weaker banks rely
more on lending relationships and pay lower rates for liquidity than they would otherwise
when borrowing from their relationship lenders. More recently Afonso, Kovner, and Schoar
(2011) study relationship lending in the federal funds market. They find that concentrated
4
borrowers can easily get funds when needed and pay a significantly lower rate to their
relationship lenders than they pay when borrowing from other market participants. Braeuning
and Fecht (2012) find that in the German interbank market, credit availability and interbank
rates increase as the concentration and frequency of lending relations increases. Our analysis
is different from these studies in that we focus on the effect that interbank lending
relationships have on the demand schedules that banks submit to the ECB's liquidity auctions.
In contrast to those studies, we can directly observe banks' liquidity demand schedules and
better identify their determinants. In addition, our interbank credit data comprise loans at all
maturities, while previous studies could only consider short-term interbank loans, where
established relationships are more important factors in the decision to grant a longer-term
loan. Thus our data are better suited to provide comprehensive insights into the importance of
relationship lending in the interbank market.
Theoretical models in a bank-firm context hypothesize that bank monitoring incentives
lead to concentrated corporate borrowing (Holmstrom and Tirole (1997)) or to multiple
banking whenever the benefit of greater diversification dominates the costs of free-riding
(Carletti, Cerasi, and Daltung (2007)). If concentrated borrowing leads to lower interbank
borrowing rates (something we do not observe in our data), then this would be reflected in the
lower rates that banks would be willing to bid for liquidity at the repo auctions held by the
central bank. However, the borrowing structure is also determined by the financial health of
the lender and her access to liquidity, where multiple banking relationships also allow
borrowers to diversify their bank liquidity risk (see Detragiache, Garella, and Guiso (2000)
and Ongena, Tümer-Alkan, and von Westernhagen (2012)). In this respect, diversification
incentives would suggest an inverse (positive) relationship between borrowing concentration
and banks' liquidity needs (as reflected in their willingness to bid). Having established several
interbank credit relationships mitigates the dependency on an individual lender and might
therefore improve access to interbank liquidity.
5
A recent strand of studies examines banks' willingness to pay for liquidity in the
European Central Bank's (ECB) weekly repo auctions (see Craig and Fecht (2007), Fecht,
Nyborg, and Rocholl (2011), Nyborg, Bindseil, and Strebulaev (2009), Linzert, Nautz, and
Bindseil (2007) and Linzert, Nautz, and Breitung (2006)). These papers explain banks'
bidding behaviour by bank characteristics and market-wide factors, mainly focusing on their
observed liquidity positions. We contribute to this literature by investigating the role of
connections in the interbank market in influencing this behaviour. Moreover, we study the
bidding behaviour over a much longer period, which enables us to exploit the time variation
as well as to analyse the behaviour at the beginning of the turmoil.
Finally, our paper is also related to the literature documenting increased systemic risk and
contagion due to interbank linkages. Iyer and Peydro (2009), for instance, show that higher
interbank exposure to a failed bank increases deposit withdrawals. The majority of the studies
model the structure of the market by employing either payment data or balance sheet data to
estimate interbank positions (see Furfine (2003), Bech and Atalay (2010), Upper and Worms
(2004), and Degryse and Nguyen (2007) among others). Craig and von Peter (2010), on the
other hand, develop a core-periphery model using German credit register data on bilateral
interbank exposures. While our analysis does not make any inference on the contagion or
systemic risk, we point to the implications of a bank being `too connected-to-fail' and believe
that it affects its liquidity needs and bidding behaviour. Our findings with the centrality
measures also point to a conclusion where a higher degree of centrality in lending increases
the willingness to bid. However, particularly during the crisis period, central borrowers in the
money market bid less aggressively in the auctions, which might reflect the lower default
probability due to being too-big-to-fail.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we introduce the
institutional background of the German banking system and the European System of Central
6
Banks (ESCB). In section 3, we describe the data, our empirical strategy, and our hypotheses.
We investigate the impact of interbank relationships on bidding behaviour and present our
findings in the fourth section. Section 5 concludes.
2 Institutional Background
The German universal banking system is structured along three pillars: commercial banks,
cooperative banks, and public sector banks. By the end of 2007, German banks account for
more than a quarter of the assets in the euro area-banking sector. There were 2,015 banks in
the country, of which 1,234 were credit cooperatives, 458 public sector banks and 260
commercial banks. However, in terms of market shares, commercial banks account for 30
percent of all bank assets, whereas public sector banks account for 34.5 percent, and credit
cooperatives together with their central institutions constitute only 10 percent.4 While both the
public and cooperative banks form a relatively closed giro system in which liquidity is
reallocated, commercial banks rely to a larger extent on the liquidity provision of the formal
interbank market.
Besides their need for working balances, banks' demand for liquidity in the euro area is
driven be the required reserves that they have to hold as a monthly average with the European
System of Central Banks (ESCB). All banks that are subject to these reserve requirements
also have access to the ECB's standing facilities, i.e., the marginal lending facility as well as
the deposit facility, and are eligible to participate in the ECB's repo auctions. During the
period that we consider, these repo auctions were held as variable rate tenders. Each bank was
allowed to place up to 10 bids in each auction, giving the interest rate the bank would be
willing to pay for a loan of a certain size. The interest rate had to exceed a minimum bid rate,
which was considered the key policy rate. The maturity of those collateralized short-term

HypoVereinsbank), regional banks, and branches of foreign banks.

loans granted by the ECB was two weeks before March 2004 and one week thereafter. The
ECB aggregated the individual demands for liquidity and calculated the marginal rate based
on the market-wide demand and the amount the ECB intended to allocate. Bids at the
marginal rate were served pro rata, bids with rates exceeding the marginal rate receive a full
allotment, and bids lower than the marginal rate are not served. Banks in need of liquidity had
an incentive to place a bid close to but slightly above the marginal bid rate. However, banks
could not perfectly anticipate the marginal rate. Consequently, banks that must cover their
liquidity needs in the auctions (rather than in the interbank market), placed higher bids to
ensure that they received sufficient liquidity.5
At the marginal lending facility banks could borrow any amount overnight from the ECB,
provided that they had sufficient collateral pledged with the ESCB. The deposit facility allows
banks to deposit excess reserves with the ECB. In the period considered, the deposit rate is
100 bp lower than the minimum bid rate, and the marginal lending facility rate was 100 bp
higher.
3 Data and Empirical Approach
3.1 Data Sources
We employ a unique, matched dataset covering the period 2000 to 2008. The data are
obtained by matching four major databases on the bank-date level. The databases are provided
by the Deutsche Bundesbank and contain information on banks' bidding behaviour in the
primary market, interbank relationships, as well as balance sheet items and reserve data to
control for bank characteristics and liquidity needs.
5 Abassi et al. (2013) provide evidence that banks' bidding behavior reflects indeed their willingness to pay for
liquidity rather than their ability to predict the marginal rate. They show that banks' bids are highly correlated
with a banks' subsequent recourse to the marginal lending facility of the ECB (discount window).
8
We measure banks' willingness to pay for liquidity by the bids they placed in the
European Central Bank's (ECB) weekly repo auctions. The data on German banks are
compiled by the Deutsche Bundesbank, as all monetary operations in the Eurosystem are
conducted at the national level. We include the complete set of bids for all main refinancing
operations (MROs) that are variable rate tenders held in our sample period.6 The sample of
auctions consists of 409 main refinancing operations with maturities of seven and fourteen
days.
The Deutsche Bundesbank's credit register is the second data source for our analysis. It
reports for each German bank all large exposures to individual financial and non-financial
firms. Large exposures are defined as exposures of 1.5 million euros (formerly 3 million DM)
and above. German banks are required to report exposures exceeding this threshold to the
Deutsche Bundesbank on a quarterly basis.7 We are able to identify both the borrower and the
lender with a full counter-party breakdown, borrower identity, location, industry, legal form,
and the date of bankruptcy (if applicable). Moreover, we can distinguish short-term exposures
for interbank loans (up to one year) as well as on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items.
Since we are interested in bilateral bank relationships, we include only exposures to banks,
and investigate at each borrower level in order to observe borrowing patterns in the interbank
market. In addition to investigating direct exposures, we include information on financial
networks in order to account for systemic importance in terms of both intermediation and
tiering in the interbank market (see Craig and von Peter, 2010).
We match this dataset of borrower banks and their relationship structure to bank balance
sheet data (BISTA), which include all banks in the German banking system. Finally, we
6 The ECB decided to change its auction procedure to a fixed-rate tender on 8 October 2008.
7 For a more detailed definition, see Section 14 of the Banking Act (Deutsche Bundesbank, 2001). If the sum of
the exposures to firms in a borrower unit exceeds the threshold, the individual exposures in that borrower unit
are reported, even if it is a small exposure. For claims existing during the reporting period but partly or fully
repaid, the remaining exposure is reported even if the amount is zero. This helps us to identify the existing
bilateral relationships.
9
employ reserve data for all German financial institutions in the industry available from 2004
to 2008. The data include each bank's cumulative reserve holdings on a daily basis and the
reserve requirement for each maintenance period.
3.2 The Model
We explore the impact of interbank relationships on pricing by estimating

where Pricing is measured by the bidding behavior (Overbid) and the price paid
(Overpricing), respectively.
A potential problem with the identification strategy is that our Relationship and
Centrality variables are endogenous and may capture banks' unobserved characteristics that
would determine both this interconnectedness and banks' bidding behavior. We take
advantage of information on bids from multiple points in time to use within group variation to
control for individual bank effects. These panel methods help to eliminate the bias related to
the omission of unobserved bank characteristics. We further exploit the differences in bank
ownership, mainly focusing on state-owned banks in our OLS estimations. Due to implicit
government guarantees for state-owned banks omitted variables that reflect the health of a
bank play less of role. With a government guarantee, a change in the perceived riskiness of a
state-owned bank should not impede the banks' access to the interbank market. The increased
riskiness should not force state owned banks to borrow more extensively from the ECB.
10
3.3 Variable Definitions
All variable definitions are displayed in Table 1. We categorize the set of dependent variables
as Pricing; explanatory variables as `Relationship and Centrality', Bank variables
(Accounting and Liquidity needs) and Auction characteristics as presented in our empirical
model.
3.3.1 Pricing measures
Our major interest is to measure the bidding behaviour, particularly its aggressiveness, of
banks in repo auctions. By constructing our variables, we mainly follow the approach by
Fecht, Nyborg, and Rocholl (2011), who explain auction pricing with bank and market
characteristics.
We employ two measures computed using the bidding data. First, we calculate the
Overbid (Overpricing) for each bidder by subtracting the Eonia swap rate from the weighted
average rate bid (paid). The Overbid proxies for the willingness to pay, whereas the
Overpricing is determined by the success of the bidding strategy, as it measures the price paid
by bidders benchmarked by the market rate.
3.3.2 Relationship and Centrality Measures
We start by borrowing measures from the relationship lending literature to identify interbank
relationships. Several proxies are used in empirical work to distinguish between relationship
lenders and transactional lenders. These are the duration of the relationship between the firm
and the bank, various loan categories, the number of creditors, and concentration of
borrowing8 (see Boot (2000) and Petersen and Rajan (1994) among others; and Degryse and
Ongena (2008) and Degryse, Kim, and Ongena (2009) for reviews). Studies on interbank
relationships consider similar measures as in Furfine (2001) and Cocco, Gomes and Martins
8 Elsas (2005) finds evidence of a strong connection between the share of financing and the probability of (self-
assessing) being the relationship lender.
11
(2009). First, we measure banks' concentration of borrowing using the largest share of
financing. We compute the share as the largest amount borrowed by bank i in quarter t
relative to the overall amount borrowed by bank i. This measure gives us the information on
the asymmetry in financing and the intensity of the relationship lending. We have information
on the largest share in "on-and off balance sheet (BS) loans", in "on-BS loans", and "in short-
term loans (up to one year)". We chose to report the results using on-balance sheet exposures,
MaxShare_onBS, as our findings are mainly similar. Our second concentration measure is the
Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) that captures the entire distribution of shares.
Our alternative measure for lending relationships is the number of lenders in the
interbank market. Number is defined as the lagged value of the natural log number of lenders
observed in on-and-off-balance sheet exposures. We also estimate our model using only on-
balance sheet short-term exposures in the first part of the analysis, but we report only the
former for brevity in the rest of our estimations. We take the lag of these measures in order to
deal with the differences in the frequency of data.9
We hypothesize that banks that cannot benefit from relationships in interbank lending
will turn to the primary market for their liquidity needs and bid more aggressively compared
with other banks. If the same mechanism operates as in bank-firm relationships, that is close
ties facilitate monitoring, then the degree of the intensity of relationships, i.e., a lower Number
or higher MaxShare_onBS and HHI, should lead to lower bid rates. On the other hand, if for
example screening costs are prior to invested fixed costs, then all that matters is that there is a
relationship and not its intensity. The Number should have a negative impact on banks
willingness to pay for liquidity in the ECB's auctions.
9 Pricing variables are measured on a weekly basis, whereas balance sheet variables are monthly, and the credit
register consists of quarterly data. We further take the four consecutive lags of the largest share to take the
average on a rolling window. Results remain unchanged.
12
These measures of interbank relationships indicate the degree of direct connectivity of a
bank with other banks. But they do not really capture the connections with the rest of the
system through banking intermediaries. With our information about all of the bilateral
exposures among all German banks, we can construct the entire network of interbank credit
relations, and study not only the impact of direct but also indirect interbank lending
relations.10
To measure the connectivity of an individual bank to the rest of the interbank network,
we calculate for each bank a classic centrality measure first introduced by Bonacich (1987).
This measure adds the number of interbank credit relationships (weighted by the amount of
the bilateral exposures) through which the bank is connected to every other bank in the
system. A bank is more central the more interbank credit chains link it to other banks.
Consequently, a bank is considered as more central if it is linked to other more central banks
(see Appendix A for a more detailed description of the Bonacich centrality measure).
Obviously, the interbank network is a directed network since each credit relationship
involves a borrower and a lender. We can define centrality measures for both borrowing and
lending. A high Bonacich in centrality figure for a particular bank suggests that this bank
borrows from many banks that are also centrally located in the network, i.e., these are lenders
that borrow themselves in the interbank market and borrow mostly from other banks that also
serve as intermediaries in the interbank market. In contrast, a high Bonacich out centrality
measure for a bank indicates that this bank lends heavily to banks that are themselves lending
to those banks that function as intermediaries in the interbank market.
Although the Bonacich in and out measures have distinct concepts, they are both driven
by banks that serve as intermediaries in the interbank market. So it is not surprising that they
have a fairly high correlation coefficient. We use this measure because it has an interpretation
10 See Craig and von Peter (2010) for a detailed explanation on the network structure of German banks.

in terms of intermediation exposure (see Bonacich (1987) for other examples of flows and
connection that the measures illustrate.)
3.3.3 Control variables
We control for bank characteristics using balance sheet variables and reserve data. To control
for potential size effects we use Size, defined as Log of total assets. We include
Interbank_borrowing, defined as overall interbank borrowing to total assets, in order to
capture banks' dependency on funding from the interbank markets. As measures for bank
health we include Equity ratio, which is based on the monthly balance sheet statistic. In
addition, we use the ROA and NPL. However, these variables are only available on an annual
basis. To account for the liquidity position, we make use of the daily fulfillment of reserves
one day before the auction, normalized by the number of days left to the end of the
maintenance period.

where fulfill is measured for bank i, auction j and maintenance period p. We also control for
the liquid assets the bank holds (as a fraction of its Total Assets), denoted as Security
Holdings.
In addition, we control for due, the maturing repo amount of the previous auction divided
by total assets of the bank. Finally, we include announced, defined as the natural logarithm of
the amount that the ECB announced before the MRO to allot in the auction. This should
capture the price and quantity expectations of the participants.
14
3.4 Summary Statistics
The first set of (pooled) summary statistics are displayed in Table 2. We observe certain
distinct features of bidder banks in comparison to the entire sample. They are larger on
average, borrow more in the interbank market and hold a higher fraction of liquid assets. Not
surprisingly, bidder banks have a higher number of interbank relationships and are slightly
more concentrated in borrowing when the largest share is taken into account.
Table 3 presents information on the bidding behavior and relationships over time. Mean
values for bid rates and price paid increase significantly in 2008, while from 2001 to 2007
banks tend to bid below the Eonia swap rate on average. Concerning relationships, the
variation in Number is quite large both over time and cross-section. Concentration measures
do not vary much over time, while slightly increasing in the last two years.
We further explore the banking groups in Table 4. Commercial banks have a higher
number of relationships and are also less concentrated than state-owned banks and
cooperative banks where the latter two groups tend to have concentration measures that are
normally distributed.
4 Results
Table 5 reports the fixed-effects panel estimation results explaining Overbid.11 The first set of
specifications (the first four columns) cover the entire period from 2000 to 2008. The second
set (starting with column 5) covers the period from 2004 to 2008, since these specifications
include two new variables in the model that are only available after 2004: fulfill, daily
fulfilment of reserves, and announced, the announced amount to be allotted before the
auction. We focus our discussion on the second set of results since these two variables are
important determinants of the liquidity needs of banks.
11 We also estimate our model using a pooled panel. The results are unaffected.
15
In the first specifications, we investigate the impact of concentration of borrowing by
employing MaxShare_onBS, (the largest share in on-BS loans), Number (number of lenders
for all relationships) and HHI. The results are not in line with the relationship lending
literature, where close relationships imply a higher credit availability, which would decrease
the willingness to pay/bid for liquidity in this framework. Having a more concentrated
borrowing structure or a lower number of lenders leads to a higher bid rate on average. For
instance, one standard deviation increase in the concentration of borrowing (number of
lenders) increases the bid rate by 0.3 to 0.4 basis points (4.2 basis points) over the swap rate.
This finding suggests that banks may prefer to diversify. Having a larger number of
relationship lenders increases the chances that one of the lenders indeed has excess liquidity
that it could lend. Moreover, increasing the number of credit relationships reduces the lenders'
market power. Since monitoring intensity is expected to be higher with a more concentrated
borrowing structure, the lock-in is more severe and the lender might charge a mark-up,
inducing her to bid also more aggressively in an ECB auctions.
We further take the overall interconnectedness of the nodes into account using the
Bonacich centrality measure. As described above, this measure rates how central a node is
through the number of connections (weighted by the amount of bilateral exposures to other
connected banks). We include Bonacich in and Bonacich out measures as alternative
measures to our relationship variables in the fourth specification. We find that only Bonacich
out, measuring centrality in lending, is significantly positive in explaining Overbid. In other
words, being a well connected lender who lends to borrowers that are themselves central
lenders increases the willingness to bid for a bank. This is what we would expect in terms of
the increased systemic risk faced by banks that are exposed to banks that are themselves
exposed to more borrowers. Because of these central exposures, the lenders must themselves
pay a higher price for liquidity. The estimated coefficient indicates that banks with a
16
substantial exposure to systemic risk must pay a higher risk premium when covering their
own liquidity needs.
In the last three specifications, we examine the interbank position for a given borrowing
structure by including centrality measures together with our relationship variables. 12
Moreover, we would like to account for multiple banking relationships with asymmetric
financing since we believe that the share of financing and the number of bank relationships do
not necessarily capture the same characteristics of a borrowing structure.13 Therefore we
include them together in Specification 9 . We also consider the fact that our alternative
concentration measure HHI is a function of both "shares in financing" and "number of
relationships". Hence we choose the model that includes HHI as our benchmark model in the
rest of the analysis.
Most coefficients are supporting the results in previous specifications. However, the share
of financing is no longer significant while Number remains unaffected in this new
specification. Banks with a higher HHI bid higher rates in an ECB auction. The increase in
the willingness to pay for liquidity in the auctions due to lending to more systemically
relevant banks remains stable when controlling for the positive diversification effect of direct
lending relationships. This confirms our reading that it is indeed the exposure to systemic risk
why the Bonacich out matters for the banks' opportunity costs of obtaining liquidity.
With respect to our bank control variables we find that banks that refinance a larger share
of their balance sheet in the interbank market pay less for liquidity. Seemingly this also
reflects the fact that these banks have a better access to the interbank market and are less
dependent on liquidity obtained from the ECB.14 Banks with a large portfolio of marketable
(and thus in principle liquid) securities have a lower willingness to pay for liquidity. Rather
12 Considering that Bonacich in and out are highly correlated as well, we reestimate the same model with the
share of financing and Bonacich out only. The results remain unaffected.
13 The variables are not highly correlated.
14 While the results are statistically less significant for the bidding behavior, they are more robust for the
overpricing.
17
than borrowing from the ECB or in the unsecured interbank market these banks can obtain
liquidity through asset sales or secured interbank borrowing involving no credit risk premium.
These results are all consistent with what we would expect from our explanation above.
Somewhat surprising is though our finding that better capitalized and larger banks pay more
for liquidity. However, this can be explained in terms of an endogenous capital ratio. Riskier
banks might need a higher equity ratio at the same time that they pay an elevated credit risk
premium in the interbank market. This increases their willingness to pay for liquidity in the
auctions. There remains only one control variable that is difficult to explain. It is still puzzling
that banks with more non-performing loans pay less for liquidity.
The higher the maturing repo amount, the more aggressive the bank will bid in an
auction. Moreover, when short in liquidity to fulfil their reserve requirements, banks place
significantly higher bids. Having a concentrated borrowing structure increases this effect (see
column 9 and 10). We also include the volatility of the Eonia rate, as it potentially influences
the ability of anticipating the final auction outcome. This allows us to control for bid-shading
effects that might distort the information content of a bank's submitted demand schedule
about its borrowing costs in the market. Indeed our results indicate that a higher uncertainty
about the interbank rate is associated with a higher willingness to pay for liquidity in the
auctions. In addition, we control for the effect of the crisis, which includes the period from
July 2007 to the first quarter of 2008.15 Not surprisingly, we document that both higher
volatility and being in the crisis period have a positive impact on the bid rate. We also interact
the HHI with the crisis dummy to investigate the role of borrowing relationships during the
crisis. The result suggests that the impact is much stronger in adverse times. More
concentrated borrowing increased the value of liquidity during the crisis.
15 In July 2007, IKB announced that it had been affected by the subprime mortgage crisis in the U.S. and had to
be bailed out in August 2007. Hence, we take the end of July as the starting point of the turmoil in the German
market.
18
Table 6 presents the results explaining Overpricing, defined as a weighted average rate
paid minus the swap rate. The results are in line with the previous finding, suggesting that
banks end up paying higher interest rates when they rely on concentrated borrowing.
However, the centrality measure does not determine the price paid. We also note that
Overpricing is determined by the bidding strategy and the auction outcome together. In other
words, while it also reflects the bidding behaviour, it is an equilibrium value and is affected
by several factors, including the ECB's policy and other participants' bidding strategies that
are endogenous. Thus, we believe that Overbid is a better and a cleaner measure to identify
the aggressiveness of the bidders related to their liquidity needs.
4.1 Selection Model
In this section, we consider a bank's decision to participate in an auction since it is very likely
that this decision is not random and may be determined by certain bank characteristics
including banking groups. Therefore, we would like to correct for a potential selection bias by
estimating a standard Heckman (1979) selection model. Table 7 presents our findings on both
Overbid and Overpricing.
Starting from this point, we use only the HHI as our relationship measure. In the first
stage, we estimate a probit model for the decision to participate in an auction. In the second
stage, i.e., the selected sample, we explain bidding behaviour using our benchmark model and
include the inverse Mills ratio obtained from the first stage to correct for any selection bias.
We find that HHI and network variables do not have any influence on the decision to
participate. In the second stage, before reporting the fixed effects estimations, we also report
OLS results. The OLS approach permits us to include variables that are not varying over time,
such as bank type. The German banking system consists of three pillars with commercial
19
banks, state-owned banks and cooperative banks.16 Moreover there exist several other
subcategories like regional banks as well. However, we would like to focus on the role of
state ownership due to differences in solvency risk, and include a single dummy, state-owned
banks, equal to one if the bank is a state-owned bank, and zero otherwise.17
In line with previous results, banks with a more concentrated borrowing structure bid
significantly more aggressively, contradicting again the findings of studies on the importance
of relationships in the interbank market. Centrality measures seem to matter only in fixed
effects estimations. Bonacich in inversely affects both pricing measures, while the magnitude
is close to zero. Bonacich out is consistent with previous results.
Larger banks with a higher level of interbank borrowing and security holdings are more
likely to participate in auctions. State-owned banks are less likely to participate and tend to
bid lower rates compared to commercial banks. Liquidity needs also play a role in the
decision to participate, not different than the influence on the bidding behavior. The signs and
statistical significance for most of the parameters in the second stage remain almost
unchanged compared to the previous section. We find that a higher volatility in the market
increases the willingness to participate as well.
4.2 State-owned banks and the crisis
In this section, we explore how the bank type would affect the link between interbank
relationships and the bidding behaviour. We follow the same approach in the previous section
and include a dummy for state-owned banks in the model and interact it with HHI. We do so
in order to assess the relevance of an omitted variable bias. In contrast to other banking
groups, state-owned banks are government guaranteed. Thus changes in their perceived credit
risk should not matter for their availability and pricing of interbank credit. Thus when the
16 See Section 2 for detailed information.
17 In a previous version of this paper, we included more subcategories, such as regional banks, savings banks,
Landesbanken and cooperative banks. We found that main influence on the bidding behavior is determined by
state-owned banks.
20
health of state-owned banks weakens it should not force the bank to rely more on its interbank
relationship borrower while at the same time also borrowing more extensively from the
ECB.18 The results are reported in the first two columns of Table 8. While being a state-
owned bank mitigates the effect of concentrated borrowing on the willingness to pay before
the crisis, state-owned banks bid still more aggressively if they have a concentrated borrowing
structure. Summing up the coefficient of the interaction term and the coefficient of HHI gives
for both estimates an overall positive effect. Thus while possibly contributing to the
magnitude of our previous results an omitted variable bias cannot explain our findings
entirely. This is further confirmed if we look at the split sample (see columns 3 & 4 and 5 &
6, respectively). During the financial crisis when omitted variable problems should have been
most severe the bidding behaviour of state owned bank was not significantly differently
affected by changes in the concentration in the borrowing structure. In addition we find that
concentration of borrowing has a stronger impact on Overbid during the crisis. However it no
longer determines the price paid in the crisis. Bonacich out, measuring centrality in lending, is
significantly positive in explaining Overbid , and this effect seems to be driven by the crisis.
This is in line with our previous findings and consistent with the idea that centrality in lending
measures a bank's exposure to systemic risk, and affects its ability to obtain liquidity. Banks
that are more exposed to systemic risk bid relatively more aggressively during the crisis.
5 Conclusion
During the financial crisis, several developments affected institutional structures in the
interbank market. The increase in counterparty risks led to a substantial rise in secured
interbank lending relative to uncollateralized interbank loans. The ECB temporarily decided
18 A problem with this argument though is that because of state guarantees, relationship specific information
about the borrowers' quality does not play an important role. Thus we might find that relationship variables
matter less for state-owned banks.
21
to reduce the difference in interest rates between the two standing facilities. Moreover, due to
the ECB's massive liquidity injections, the ECB became a major intermediary for the euro
area interbank market. While these developments presumably reduced the risk of domino
effects in the banking sector, their overall welfare implications are far from being fully
understood. As a single example, it is still unclear to what extent these developments
weakened market discipline in the interbank market.
In this paper, we try to contribute to a more profound understanding of these issues. In
particular, we study to what extent relationship lending prevails in the German interbank
market. To our knowledge, only a few papers investigated relationship lending in the
interbank market so far. Cocco, Gomes and Martins (2009), for instance, find that
relationships affect banks' ability to borrow in the interbank market.
We find that having established lending relationships with many lenders in the interbank
markets provides borrowers with a more diversified source for liquidity. In addition, a more
equal distribution of borrowing across lenders also improves borrowers' diversification. Both
foster banks' access to liquidity and lead to lower bid rates of banks that participate in an
ECB's refinancing operations. The observation that established relationships matter for the
price banks pay for liquidity suggests that indeed private information available to relationship
lenders plays an important role in the allocation of liquidity and the price banks pay for
covering their liquidity needs.
When the network structure of the interbank market as a whole is taken into account, we
find that banks that lend not only to many banks but particularly to banks that themselves lend
to many other interbank lenders tend to pay more in the ECB's auctions. This reflects that
systemically important banks pay a premium for liquidity. We also find some evidence that
banks borrowing from lenders who have a broad network of lenders pay less for liquidity,
suggesting also that the indirect access to liquidity through an intermediary in the money
market matters with the availability of liquidity.

Appendix A
The Bonacich centrality measure is a measure that depends on two parameters, a scaling
parameter, , and a measure of the centrality of the closer neighbors to the bank, . The
Bonacich centrality measure is defined as
c(,) =  A * 1 * (I ­ A)-1 (A.1)
where A is the adjacency matrix, 1 is a vector of ones, and I is the identity matrix. The
scaling parameter is chosen to normalize the centrality measures so that their norm is the total
number of nodes in the adjacency matrix for the interbank network, A. For  = 0, then c is
just the weighted out-links centrality measure. For  increasing between 0 and 1/, where 
is the largest eigenvalue of A, the centrality measure can be interpreted as a recursion which
puts greater weight on those nearby links which are more central, themselves. This can be
seen in Bonacich's original definition, which explicitly uses the centrality measure of adjacent
links:
c(,) = ( + j
c
j
)A
ij
j

For  decreasing between 0 and -1/, more central banks are penalized in the centrality
measure. For this paper, we report the extreme values for  = .999/, which measures the
centrality of banks that lend to other central banks. We follow Rodan (2011), in that we
report extreme values, although clearly not the most extreme value at  = 1/, where the
matrix (I ­ A)-1 would be singular.
Although the original measure was designed for symmetric adjacency matrices, in our
case, the exposures are clearly asymmetric. So we define a separate measure of centrality,
where Aij
in the above equations are replaced with Aji
which we call the in-centrality. In this
case, a bank is more central if it is lent to by more central banks.
35
To summarize our centrality measure, we chose a measure that was related to links, but
also incorporated exposures to the systemic, connected banks in the networks, to distinguish it
from the aspects of relationship lending embodied in the link measures.
