Abstract
Nearly one-third of adult Medicaid beneficiaries who receive long-term services and supports (LTSS) consist of older adults and
persons with disabilities who are not eligible for Medicare. Beneficiaries, advocates, and policymakers have all sought to shift LTSS
to home and community settings as an alternative to institutional care. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of Medicaid-
only adults in California with new use of LTSS in 2006-2007 (N = 31 849) to identify unique predictors of entering nursing facilities
versus receiving Medicaid home and community-based services (HCBS). Among new users, 18.3% entered into nursing facilities,
whereas 81.7% initiated HCBS. In addition to chronic conditions, functional and cognitive limitations, substance abuse disorders
(odds ratio [OR] 1.35; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.23, 1.48), and homelessness (OR: 4.35, 9% CI: 3.72, 5.08) were associated
with higher odds of nursing facility entry. For older adults and persons with disabilities covered by Medicaid only, integration with
housing and behavioral health services may be key to enabling beneficiaries to receive LTSS in noninstitutional settings.

Original Research
1. What do we already know about this topic?
Among older adults who are dually eligible for Medicare
and Medicaid coverage, functional and cognitive limita-
tions, chronic disease severity, living alone and white race
are associated with admission to nursing facilities for
long-term services and supports.
2. How does your research contribute to the field?
The research indicates that among adults eligible for
Medicaid coverage only, who are relatively younger and
have fewer chronic conditions and functional limitations,
homelessness and substance use disorders were associ-
ated with nursing facility admission.
3. What are your research's implications toward the-
ory, practice, or policy?
Without additional supports, such as housing, treatment
for substance use disorders, and integration with mental
health services, efforts that shift care away from nursing
facility use may be unrealistic or insufficient for many
Medicaid-only adult beneficiaries.
Introduction
Medicaid is the largest US payer, public or private, of long-
term services and supports (LTSS), spending over $121 billion
in 2014.1 Policymakers have sought to curb Medicaid LTSS
expenditures by rebalancing care toward lower-cost home and
community-based services (HCBS) as an alternative to institu-
tional care.2 Furthermore, rebalancing care toward HCBS
reflects beneficiary preferences to receive LTSS in home and
community settings and in line with the Supreme Court
Olmstead decision.2 For policymakers aiming to support
HCBS use, it is key to understand the characteristics of the
population that continues to enter nursing facilities even when
HCBS is available as a Medicaid benefit.

3 or more activities of daily living (ADL), cognitive impair-
ment, and prior nursing home use were the strongest predic-
tors of admission.3 Older age, white race, male, single (rather
than married), living alone, Medicaid eligible, and disease
condition were also positive predictors. A more recent profile
of nursing home residents admitted from home found similar
characteristics associated with conversion from a short- to
long-term nursing facility stay, as well as depression and
behavioral problems.4 Because these studies addressed the
older adult population at large, they did not examine use of
HCBS as an alternative benefit under Medicaid.
Additional research has examined nursing facility versus
HCBS by beneficiaries who are dually eligible for Medicaid
and Medicare. Those initiating HCBS are on average
younger and more ethnically diverse, with fewer chronic
health conditions and fewer ADL limitations.5 Racial and
ethnic minorities are not only more likely to use HCBS, but
when they are admitted to nursing facilities, they have
greater functional and cognitive limitations.6 As expected,
nursing home case mix is thus higher than HCBS case mix.7
In contrast to the large body of research on the dual-eligi-
ble population, relatively little has addressed the group of
older adults and persons with disabilities who are eligible for
Medicaid only. This population merits greater investigation
as Medicaid-only beneficiaries account for 32% of all LTSS
users covered by Medicaid.8 Adult Medicaid-only beneficia-
ries include older adults with limited work histories, such as
those with infrequent work outside the home, and immi-
grants who arrived past their working years. Persons with
disabilities who have Medicaid but not Medicare coverage
include those with partial or temporary disability that does
not meet Medicare disability requirements, or are awaiting
permanent determination for Medicare eligibility, a process
requiring 2 years.8
Relative to dual-eligible beneficiaries, Medicaid-only
beneficiaries are on average younger, have fewer chronic
conditions, functional and cognitive limitations.9
Medicaid-only beneficiaries have high rates of mental ill-
ness (an estimated 47% of those with disabilities), as well
as central nervous system disorders and substance use dis-
orders.10 They also have a higher poverty rate- nearly half
of those with disabilities receive Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance, ie, food stamps.11 Medicaid-only beneficiaries
may thus have a different set of health and social needs
relative to dual-eligibles, and this may affect their patterns
of LTSS utilization.
When comparing Medicaid-only versus dual-eligible
older adults who use LTSS, Medicaid-only LTSS users are
more often younger, male, minorities, living in urban areas,
and diagnosed with fewer chronic conditions.12 Among all
Medicaid-only beneficiaries who use LTSS (including chil-
dren), 79% use HCBS, 18% use nursing facilities, and 3%
use both.8 In one study of Medicaid-only admissions to nurs-
ing homes, Thomas et al found that local spending on HCBS
was associated with lower rates of admissions among
beneficiaries with disabilities under age 65.13 No research to
date has examined individual predictors of entry to nursing
facility versus HCBS in this population.
In this study, we examined Medicaid-only older adults
and persons with disabilities who are newly entering nursing
facilities or receiving HCBS in California. We focused on
California because the size of the state enables an empirical
examination of a diverse Medicaid-only population, while
holding constant potentially confounding state-level policy
and program factors that vary in multistate studies. This is
particularly salient to the Medicaid-only population, as states
differ in eligibility requirements in both income and disabil-
ity determination, as well as benefits under state plans and
1915(c) waivers.8 Other studies have found state-level
spending on HCBS is associated with likelihood of nursing
facility admission.14,15
This study design focuses on the role of beneficiary char-
acteristics on LTSS use, when all beneficiaries are eligible for
the same set of LTSS benefits. Furthermore, California HCBS
benefits, including consumer-directed personal care assis-
tance, have been available as a state plan benefit for over 25
years, and can thus inform states that have more recently
broadened the scope of Medicaid LTSS. Finally, the diversity
of the California population- across geography, race and eth-
nicity- can provide insights for other states in which diversity,
particularly among the older adult population, is on the rise.
In order to support the use of HCBS among Medicaid-
only adult beneficiaries, it is important to understand what
factors contribute to the new use of nursing facilities.
Therefore, we attempted to identify characteristics associ-
ated with a nursing facility stay. versus use of HCBS,
among Medicaid beneficiaries initiating LTSS. We focused
on factors with greater salience among this population,
including mental illness, central nervous system and sub-
stance use disorders. In consideration of both the high pov-
erty rate in this population, and the necessity of stable
housing in order to receive HCBS, we also examined the
relationship between homelessness and nursing facility
entry. For the purposes of this study we only considered
nursing facility stays which were not for the purpose of
short term rehabilitation but for what was anticipated to be
an extended need.
Methods
Study Population
We selected the study sample from California adults (ages 19
and above) who were eligible for Medicaid in 2006-2007,
excluding: dual-eligibles, those with Medicaid eligibility due
to time-limited circumstances (eg, emergency care, family
benefit), and those with developmental disabilities; the
resulting study population consisted of Medicaid-eligible
adults. From this we identified N= 31 849 beneficiaries with
new LTSS use (as defined below).
Ko et al 3
Data Sources
We used the Medicaid eligibility data files provided by the
California Department of Health Care Services to identify
the Medicaid-only population and obtain information on
beneficiary age, sex, race and ethnicity. We linked eligibility
files to Medicaid claims data to identify both prevalent and
incident HCBS and nursing facility use and diagnosis codes.
We further linked statewide hospital discharge data (Office
of Statewide Planning and Development Patient Discharge
Database) to supplement claims data on diagnosis codes, and
assessment data on housing status.
We obtained functional and cognitive ability measures
and living arrangement data from the state Case Management
Information and Payrolling System (CMIPS) for those
receiving HCBS, the Minimum Data Set (MDS) for those
entering nursing facilities, Outcome and Assessment
Information Set (OASIS) used for those receiving home
health care, and Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Patient
Assessment Instrument (IRF/PAI) for those discharged from
rehabilitation hospitals. Cognitive limitation was defined as
requiring at least verbal assistance, supervision, or cueing
due to limitations in memory, orientation, or judgment items
in the CMIPS and MDS instruments.
Measures
Our primary outcome of interest was whether a beneficiary
entered into a nursing facility for an extended stay, with use
of HCBS as the reference alternative. We defined LTSS use
as either receipt of Medicaid HCBS or an extended nursing
facility stay, at least once during the study period. We defined
HCBS as: home health, personal care assistance, commu-
nity-based adult day health services, targeted case manage-
ment, and Section 1915(c) home and community-based
service waivers. To focus on long-term, rather than acute and
rehabilitative services, we defined extended nursing facility
stays as those lasting 21 or more consecutive days. We iden-
tified new use as extended nursing facility stay or HCBS
with no prior use of that service in the preceding 12-months.
We included age, gender, race and ethnicity, and chronic
disease burden using the Chronic Illness and Disability
Payment System (CDPS) for Medicaid, which consolidates
diagnostic codes: higher scores reflect greater morbidity.16
We used the CDPS-created categories to create indicators for
central nervous system, psychological and substance use dis-
orders (see Supplemental Material Tables A3-A5 for a com-
plete list of diagnoses for each category). We categorized
functional limitation as having 3 or more limitations in ADL,
and we defined cognitive limitation as requiring at least ver-
bal assistance/supervision/cueing due to limitations in mem-
ory, orientation, or judgment. We measured living
arrangement with an indicator for whether a beneficiary
lived alone. We also adjusted for whether a beneficiary was
Medically Needy or categorically eligible for Medicaid.
Beneficiaries who are eligible for Medicaid under the state
Medically Needy program have incomes above categorical
limits, and on average greater health care needs and use of
nursing facilities.17
Analysis
We first described the characteristics of beneficiaries who
are new users of each service. We then performed multivari-
ate logistic regression models to estimate the associations
between individual characteristics and nursing facility entry
rather than HCBS.
Procedures for the privacy protection of recipient identity
and service use were approved by the University of California
Committee on Human Research (#10-02998) and the
California Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects
(#12-06-0416). All analyses were conducted using SAS ver-
sion 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina).
Results
In the period of 2006-2007, 26 031 of the 31 849 (81.7%) of
Medicaid-only adults who used LTSS received HCBS, with
the balance entering nursing facilities. Compared to HCBS
users, a higher percentage of nursing facility entrants were
non-Hispanic White and aged 55 to 64 years (Table 1). Over
65% had 3 or more limitations in ADL and nearly half had
cognitive limitations. Nearly twice the percentage of nursing
facility entrants had central nervous system, psychological,
and substance use conditions.
In multivariate analyses, older age, male gender, non-His-
panic White race and ethnicity, and Medically Needy eligi-
bility were significantly associated with entering into a
nursing facility rather than HCBS (Table 2). A greater burden
of chronic disease, central nervous system and psychological
conditions, and cognitive limitations were also associated
with higher odds of entry into a nursing facility. Substance
abuse and living alone were associated with over 35% higher
odds. Having 3 or more ADL limitations and being homeless
were each associated with over 400% higher odds of nursing
facility entry.
We conducted additional analyses with more specific cat-
egories of central nervous system, psychological and sub-
stance abuse conditions associated with nursing facility
admission (Supplemental Material Tables A3-A5). After
identifying associations among the specific categories, we
estimated models including the corresponding indicators
and aggregating the rest. For example, among central ner-
vous system (CNS) disorders, dementia (odds ratio [OR]
2.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.79, 3.41) and move-
ment disorders (OR 1.39; 95% CI 1.17, 1.64) were associ-
ated with nursing facility admission, whereas autonomic
and inflammatory disorders were not; the dementia and
movement disorders were retained in the full model and
other CNS disorders were aggregated into a single Other
4 INQUIRY
CNS disorder category (Supplemental Material Tables A1,
A2). Schizophrenia and other diagnoses of psychoses (OR
2.53; 95% CI 2.18, 2.94) and personality disorders (OR
1.63; 95% CI 1.24, 2.13) were also associated with nursing
facility admissions, with a weak association for mood disor-
ders (OR 1.12; 95% CI 1.00, 1.26). Within substance abuse,
alcohol use (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.33, 1.66), but not use of
other substances (including opioids, other prescription med-
ications, or other illicit drugs), was associated with nursing
facility admission. Relationships between ADL limitations,
living alone, and being homeless, with nursing facility
admission, remained nearly unchanged after including the
expanded list of conditions.
Discussion
Among the California Medicaid-only adult population using
LTSS, the large majority received HCBS, rather than nurs-
ing facility care. Our findings are similar to national esti-
mates on nonelderly beneficiaries with disabilities.18 In
contrast, approximately 50% of dual-eligible beneficiaries
using LTSS receive nursing facility care.18
As seen in prior studies of dual-eligible beneficiaries,
Medicaid-only adults who entered nursing facilities rather
than used HCBS tended to be older, of non-Hispanic White
race and ethnicity, and have a higher burden of chronic dis-
ease, functional and cognitive limitations, and central ner-
vous system conditions.3,12 Entry into nursing facilities
among those with greater frailty and limitations may reflect
higher care needs that may be more easily met in institutional
settings.
Our finding that racial and ethnic minorities are less likely
to enter nursing facilities, even after accounting for health and
functional conditions, is consistent with prior research on
older adults and dual-eligible beneficiaries suggesting minor-
ities face barriers to care.3,6 Other recent investigations have
found that disparities in nursing facility use are narrowing,19,20
although it is unclear whether this reflects the greater variety
of LTSS options available to non-Hispanic Whites versus a
true narrowing of disparities in access.6 Nursing facility
options are limited for those with only Medicaid coverage,
and the facilities serving a higher percentage of Medicaid
residents have, on average, limited resources and lower qual-
ity of care.21,22 Due to persistent structural inequities and

disproportionate representation within Medicaid, Medicaid-
only minorities may thus have fewer nursing facilities avail-
able to them and receive worse care.20-22
The association of Medically Needy eligibility with nurs-
ing facility admission is consistent with a higher level of
health care expenditures relative to income; this group is
often described as relying upon costly nursing facility care to
"spend down" to gain Medicaid eligibility.17 But we note that
our findings address first entry into LTSS among this popula-
tion. Therefore, the Medically Needy beneficiaries in this
sample do not include those who have become eligible for
Medicaid as a result of a long-term nursing facility stay. The
observed relationship between Medically Needy and nursing
facility admission may more closely reflect the greater levels
of illness and disability within this population.
In addition, those with mental illness, substance use disor-
ders, and those who were homeless were also more likely to
enter nursing facilities, even after adjusting for other factors.
This is consistent with prior evidence that mental illness and
behavioral problems are associated with nursing facility
admissions,4,23 and facilities with a high concentration of
Medicaid residents also have a higher proportion of residents
with psychiatric conditions. We identified a relationship par-
ticularly between alcohol use and nursing facility admission.
Prior studies have found that nursing facility residents with
alcohol use disorders have higher functional abilities but are
more likely to have been homeless, diagnosed with comorbid
mental illness, and lacking in social support24--factors that
may contribute to admission despite low nursing care needs.
We may not have found associations for other substance use
disorders for several reasons, including that the study period
precedes the opioid epidemic, the aging of the Baby Boomer
population that has increased prevalence of nonalcohol sub-
stance use disorders,25 and lower rates of substance use
detection among older adults.26 It is possible that given the
ongoing challenges with access to treatment, we would iden-
tify nursing facility admissions associated with substance
use disorders with a more contemporary sample.
Implications
It is not surprising that Medicaid beneficiaries with chronic
conditions and functional limitations are more likely to enter
nursing facilities. However, it is debatable whether skilled
nursing facilities are optimal for beneficiaries with complex
behavioral and social needs.
For those with mental illness, prior research has also
shown that nursing facility residents receive lower quality
mental health care.27 Nearly one quarter of adults below age
65 with severe mental illness have low care status upon
admission, again suggesting that nursing facilities are not
necessarily appropriate fit for these residents.23 Although
states are required to implement a process for screening of
Medicaid beneficiaries for serious mental illness prior to
admission, and determination of appropriate placement, past
research has found that legislation is weakly enforced.28
Identifying alternative care settings has historically been
hampered by the loss of inpatient psychiatric facilities over
time and the exclusion of Medicaid reimbursement for resi-
dential care facilities.23 The Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services has recently indicated that the restriction
on Medicaid reimbursement for treatment in residential care
will be waived,29 potentially improving access to appropriate
mental health services rather than nursing facility use.
Medicaid beneficiaries (and those who evaluate their care
needs) also face the limited availability of community men-
tal health services and tailored LTSS for those with mental
illness.23 Low-income and minority communities, ie, those
with a higher proportion of Medicaid beneficiaries, have
fewer community mental health centers that accept
Medicaid.30 Furthermore, management of an individual with
mental illness in home and community settings without sup-
port in these areas can impose considerable burden on care-
giving families. This obviates HCBS options that do not

include 8 or more hours of supervision daily. In short, poli-
cies should aim for expansion of HCBS benefits in addition
to preentry treatment for mental illness.
For those with substance use disorders, most nursing
facilities are not equipped to treat these conditions.31
Alternative treatment options for Medicaid beneficiaries are
limited, with particular gaps in rural areas and those with a
high percentage of black residents.32 The supply of publicly
funded outpatient substance use treatment centers has been
declining, with a countertrend in growth of for-profit centers
that do not accept Medicaid.33 Several state Medicaid pro-
grams are testing programs to foster integration of health
care with behavioral health services, but these programs
have primarily addressed acute, rather than long-term,
care.34-36
Treatment options for those with comorbid mental illness
and substance use disorders are even more scarce. Evidence
from Money Follows the Person demonstrations suggest that
with appropriate program supports, those with dual diagno-
ses can successfully transition from nursing facilities to com-
munity settings.37 Our findings support targeting of those
with mental illness and substance use disorder needs before
nursing facility admission occurs. Two states (Washington
and Vermont) have begun programs to serve "pre-Medicaid"
beneficiaries--those at risk for Medicaid nursing facility
use, to prevent or delay admission.37
For Medicaid beneficiaries who are homeless, the lack of
housing stability would make receiving HCBS difficult and
admission to a nursing facility a preferable option. To reduce
acute care costs from emergency department visits and hos-
pital admissions, policymakers have shown greater interest
in supportive housing programs, which have a more robust
evidence basis for improving outcomes of homeless Medicaid
beneficiaries.38 Our findings suggest that potential benefits
from reduced nursing facility use should also be factored into
these considerations. Similarly, state demonstrations to facil-
itate transitions from nursing homes have highlighted the
benefits of Medicaid program coordination with housing
authorities to foster development of affordable housing, pro-
vide transition counselors, housing searches, assistance with
rental security deposits, and home modifications;37 these
approaches can also be supported to reduce nursing facility
admissions among Medicaid-only beneficiaries. Additional
research should explore the potential cost and quality bene-
fits of including housing subsidies as a Medicaid benefit, to
foster use of HCBS than nursing facilities.
Finally, states have increasingly moved toward enroll-
ment of older adults and persons with disabilities into
Medicaid managed care plans for acute care services.
Transition to managed care for these populations was per-
ceived favorably by those who selected plans and negatively
by those who were assigned.39 Demonstration initiatives in
19 states, including California, have turned to managed care
plans to guide LTSS utilization as well, and in some cases,
required reporting on rebalancing care from nursing facilities
to HCBS.40 Early evidence on the California managed LTSS
transition has found dual-eligible beneficiaries have mixed
experiences, with some reporting improved and others wors-
ened access to care;41 for those with LTSS, beneficiaries in
managed and nonmanaged LTSS counties continue to report
unmet needs.42 Other states have also reported mixed out-
comes from transitioning to managed LTSS; however, all
remain early in implementation and evaluation is ongoing.37
One challenge is that care coordination--particularly
between acute care, LTSS, and behavioral health services--
remains poorly defined and thus appropriate skill sets and
quality of care are difficult to measure.43 Our findings sup-
port the argument that managed care benefits must expand
beyond acute and LTSS health care services, and tailored for
Medicaid beneficiaries with complex social and behavioral
needs. Policymakers should examine whether managed care
plans are equipped or properly reimbursed to manage a more
complex array of services in addition to LTSS for Medicaid-
only beneficiaries.
Limitations
First, we were unable to obtain data on other characteris-
tics, such as family and social support, that are known to
influence the use of community versus institutional care.
We used living arrangement as a proxy for available social
support. Second, we were also unable to account for
length of disability, which can impact individual experi-
ence with disability severity of disability and likelihood
of functional needs and comorbidities. We have restricted
our sample to those with no prior LTSS use in the preced-
ing year, to partly reduce heterogeneity in underlying dis-
ability severity. Third, our data reflect patterns from
2006-2007: Other factors may influence current LTSS uti-
lization, including differing health and functional needs of
those newly eligible for Medicaid, and implementation of
managed acute and long-term care services in select
California counties. As described in the Introduction,
prior description of the Medicaid-only population using
LTSS is sparse, and this study provides a baseline for
future evaluation. We note that many of the findings are
consistent with the larger body of literature on LTSS use
among dual-eligibles, and we have no theoretical reason
to expect that the associations between the individual
characteristics examined in this study would change over
time. Last, this study is limited to individuals in California
and may be limited in generalizability to other states.
However, by focusing on one state, our study emphasizes
the importance of individual characteristics in LTSS out-
comes when other policy and programmatic factors are
held constant. Furthermore, certain benefits (particularly
consumer-direction in personal care assistance) were
available to California Medicaid beneficiaries in this ear-
lier time period, and thus relevant to states that have more
recently adopted these policies.

Conclusion
In recent years, the Medicaid-only population of older adults
and persons with disabilities has been growing at a faster rate
than the dual-eligible population. Relative to dual-eligibles,
Medicaid-only adults with disabilities are less likely to receive
LTSS in nursing facilities, but when they do, their annual per-
person costs are higher.18 Nursing facility options are limited
for those with only Medicaid coverage, and the facilities serv-
ing a greater percentage of Medicaid residents have, on aver-
age, limited resources and lower quality of care. Recent
evidence suggests nursing facility quality is improving and
disparities narrowing, but overall deficiency rates remain
high.44 Our findings reinforce the importance of policies such
as higher Medicaid payment rates and staffing standards that
support improved quality of care for a high need popula-
tion.45,46 Providers, advocates, and policymakers continue to
debate on how best to determine when beneficiaries may use
HCBS as an alternative to nursing facility care. Our findings
suggest that without additional supports, such as housing,
treatment for substance use disorders, and integration with
mental health services, rebalancing efforts may be unrealistic
or insufficient for many Medicaid-only adult beneficiaries.
