Abstract
Background: Social network characteristics have long been associated with mental health, but their longitudinal impact on
depression is less known. We determined whether quality of social relationships and social isolation predicts the
development of depression.
Methods: The sample consisted of a cohort of 4,642 American adults age 25­75 who completed surveys at baseline in
1995­1996 and at ten-year follow-up. Quality of relationships was assessed with non-overlapping scales of social support
and social strain and a summary measure of relationship quality. Social isolation was measured by presence of a partner and
reported frequency of social contact. The primary outcome was past year major depressive episode at ten-year follow-up.
Multivariable logistic regression was conducted, adjusting for the presence of potential confounders.
Results: Risk of depression was significantly greater among those with baseline social strain (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.47­2.70),
lack of social support (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.37­2.35), and poor overall relationship quality (OR 2.60; 95% CI, 1.84­3.69). Those
with the lowest overall quality of social relationships had more than double the risk of depression (14.0%; 95% CI, 12.0­16.0;
p,.001) than those with the highest quality (6.7%; 95% CI, 5.3­8.1; p,.001). Poor quality of relationship with spouse/
partner and family each independently increased risk of depression. Social isolation did not predict future depression, nor
did it moderate the effect of relationship quality.
Conclusions: Quality of social relationships is a major risk factor for major depression. Depression interventions should
consider targeting individuals with low quality of social relationships.

Introduction
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is an illness of major clinical
and public health significance. Lifetime prevalence of MDD in the
United States is estimated at 16%, and the vast majority of
episodes are characterized by at least moderate clinical severity
and role impairment. [1] Also common in those with medical
illnesses, depression increases risk for and worsens outcomes
among those with coronary artery disease, [2] stroke, [3] and
cancer. [4] Worldwide, major depressive disorder is a leading
source of morbidity, and by 2030 it is projected to be the number
one contributor to the global burden of disease. [5].
The association between mental health and social relationships
has long been of interest. On a conceptual level, social
relationships may influence mental health outcomes through
multiple mechanisms including influence on health-related
behaviors, engagement in social activities, transfer and exchange
of social support, and access to material resources. [6,7] On an
empirical level, social isolation and negative social interactions are
associated with depression [8,9] and suicide. [10] Prospective
community studies have found perceived marital dissatisfaction
and negative marital quality at baseline are risk factors for an
incident major depressive episode. [11,12] Meta-analyses have
shown that interventions addressing social relationships, including
couples therapy and peer support may be effective in reducing
depressive symptoms. [13,14].
Still, the state of research on social relationships and mental
health leaves a number of crucial issues unresolved. Most studies
use cross-sectional data, [8,9,15] leaving investigators unable to
determine the direction of causality between social relationships
and mental health. Of the available longitudinal studies, many
have focused on clinical populations [16] or been geographically
restricted with modest sample sizes, [17] limiting generalization to
the broader community. Finally, differing dimensions of social
relationships are often not examined within the same study,
including questions regarding with whom, how often, and in what
way do people interact with others. This prevents direct
comparisons of the relative importance of specific features of
social relationships on depression.
This study assessed evidence for association of social relation-
ships with depression in a prospective cohort. Our primary goal
was to assess in a community population the role of both

qualitative and quantitative aspects of social relationships in the
subsequent development of major depression. We hypothesized
that both poor quality of social relationships and social isolation
would increase the risk of major depression ten years later. We also
conducted secondary analyses to explore: 1) the relative impact of
negative versus positive aspects of social relationships (strain versus
support); 2) the relative impact of the quality of relationships with
spouse, family, and friends; and 3) interactions between relation-
ship quality and social isolation on the subsequent development of
major depression.
Methods
Sample
Participants were from the Midlife in the United States
(MIDUS) survey, a national longitudinal cohort study focused on
the role of behavioral, psychological, and social factors in
understanding physical and mental health. The sample was
comprised of individuals selected by random digit dialing
(RDD), with several geographical oversamples, siblings of individ-
uals from the RDD sample, and a national RDD sample of twins.
All eligible participants were non-institutionalized, English-speak-
ing adults age 25­75 at baseline. The baseline assessment, Wave 1,
occurred in 1995­1996, and a follow-up assessment, Wave 2, was
conducted in 2004­2006. The full survey included a telephone
interview, administered by trained lay interviewers, and a written
questionnaire.
For our analyses, we included individuals who participated in
both waves. After adjusting for mortality, the overall response rate
of those in Wave 2 (n = 4,954) was 75%. [18] Those who
continued study participation into Wave 2 tended to endorse more
positive health-related variables, [18] a common phenomenon in
longitudinal surveys. We further restricted our sample to those
who had a valid response to the primary outcome variable (past-
year major depressive episode at Wave 2) and were not missing all
items that composed the primary predictor variable of relationship
quality (n = 4,642). Primary analyses were conducted with those
participants who had a spouse or partner at baseline (n = 3,500)
with additional analyses additionally including the unpartnered
(n = 4,642). Sample sizes for particular analyses vary due to
differences in the number of evaluable responses. Detailed
information on the MIDUS sample and study methods are
available online (http://www.midus.wisc.edu/) and in print. [19].
Measures
Past year major depression. Past-year major depressive
episode, assessed at ten-year follow-up, was the primary outcome
variable in this study. The diagnosis of major depressive episode
was based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview
Short Form (CIDI-SF). For major depressive episodes, the CIDI-
SF has a sensitivity of 89.6%, specificity of 93.9%, and overall
agreement of 93.2% when compared to the full CIDI in a sample
similar to this study. [20] Epidemiological studies employing the
full CIDI have yielded prevalence rates of major depression similar
to those in studies using clinical interviews such as the Structured
Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R. [21] Numerous trials have
documented good test-retest reliability and clinical validity of the
CIDI-SF. [22,23].
Quality of social relationships. In our primary analyses,
we assessed the overall baseline quality of social relationships,
including items measuring social support and strain. In secondary
analyses, we used measures of the negative aspects of relationships
(social strain) and the positive aspects of relationships (social
support) separately. In additional secondary analyses, we assessed
overall relationship quality for three different types of social
relationships: spouse or partner, family members (excluding
spouse/partner), and friends.
Positive, or supportive, aspects of social relations were based on
a four-item scale about participants' spouse or partner (Cronbach's
a = .86), family (Cronbach's a = .83), and friends (Cronbach's
a = .88). [9,24] Scale items were: ``How much does your spouse or
partner really care about you?''; ``How much does he or she
understand the way you feel about things?''; ``How much can you
rely on him or her for help if you have a serious problem?''; and
``How much can you open up to him or her if you need to talk
about your worries?'' ``To measure the combined effects of these
three types of social relationships­spouse/partner, family, and
friends­we constructed a composite scale of all items on social
support (Cronbach's a = .84). Four response options were avail-
able: 1 = ''a lot,'' 2 = ''some'' 3 = ''a little,'' and 4 = ''not at all.''
The scale score was the mean of individual items. The score range
was from one to four, with a higher score indicating less social
support.
Negative, or straining, aspects to social relations also consisted
of four items about participants' spouse or partner (Cronbach's
a = .80), family (Cronbach's a = .78), and friends (Cronbach's
a = .79). [9,24] Scale items were: ``How often does your spouse or
partner make too many demands on you?''; ``How often does he or
she criticize you?''; ``How often does he or she let you down when
you are counting on him or her?''; and ``How often does he or she
get on your nerves?'' To measure the combined effects of
relationships with spouse/partner, family, and friends, we
constructed a composite scale of all items on social strain
(Cronbach's a = .83). Response options and score range paralleled
that of the positive interactions scale. Responses were reverse-
coded, with a higher score indicating more social strain.
To measure overall relationship quality for the three different
types of social relationships (spouse or partner, family members,
and friends), we constructed composite, eight-item scales that
combined the positive and negative dimensions of social relation-
ships. Reliability was again good (Cronbach's a for spouse or
partner = .87; friend = .77; family = .82). Lastly, we constructed a
composite scale of overall quality for all three types of social
relationships­spouse/partner, family, and friends (Cronbach's
a = .87). On these four-point scales, a higher score indicates lower
overall quality. Scale scores were the mean of all items.
Social isolation. Social isolation was assessed by determining
at baseline whether someone lived with a marital or romantic
partner and the frequency of their contact with non-cohabitating
family, friends, and neighbors. Participants were asked, ``Are you
currently living with someone in a steady, marriage-like relation-
ship?'' They were also asked: 1) ``How often are you in contact
with any members of your family, that is, any of your brothers,
sisters, parents, or children who do not live with you, including
visits, phone calls, letters, or electronic mail messages?''; 2) ``How
often are you in contact with any of your friends ­ including visits,
phone calls, letters, or electronic mail messages?''; and 3) ``How
often do you have a real conversation or get together socially with
any of your neighbors?'' For the first two items, eight response
options were available, ranging from 1 = ``several times a day'' to
8 = ``never or hardly ever.'' For the item about contact with
neighbors, the six response options varied from 1 = ``almost every
day'' to 6 = ``never or hardly ever.'' In all cases, a higher score
indicates more social isolation.
Covariates. Covariates were selected for inclusion based on
their known association with depression or social relationships and
all variables were assessed at baseline. Similar to recent studies,
[17] we included sex, age, ethnicity, education level, household

income, physical and mental health, major depressive disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, and alcohol misuse. Physical health
was assessed using the single item, ``In general, would you say your
physical health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?''
Mental and emotional health was assessed similarly. Major
depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder diagnoses
were based on the CIDI-SF scales, which determined past 12-
month prevalence. Alcohol misuse was assessed with a five-item
alcohol screening test (e.g., ``Did you ever, during the past 12
months, have such a strong desire or urge to use alcohol that you
could not resist it or could not think of anything else?''), and if they
answered ``yes'' to one or more items they were classified as having
alcohol misuse. Variables were dichotomized when distribution of
the data precluded analysis as continuous variables. All covariates
were analyzed at baseline.
Data Analyses
In our primary analyses, multivariable logistic regression was
used to examine the association between the overall quality of
social relationships, social isolation, and subsequent depression. A
dichotomous measure of major depression was used because of
sample skewness and the potential increase in clinical relevance
(diagnosis rather than symptoms). Results are presented as odds
ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The regression
models were adjusted for the effects of the covariates described
above. We provide predicted probabilities of depression given
differing levels of quality in relationships by evaluating at
individual level risk values. Because our sample included a
subpopulation of siblings and twins, we obtained robust standard
errors by clustering error structure at the household level. We also
conducted analyses with only the population-based (i.e., RDD)
sample and found effect sizes similar to those reported herein.
However, due to substantially reduced power, many of the results
did not reach statistical significance in this reduced sample.
Specification checks suggested the logit function was a linear
combination of the predictors. Regression diagnostics indicated
good discrimination and calibration of our model. We conducted
an a priori power estimate, assuming a total sample size of 4,900
and 450 participants with social isolation or poor quality social
relationships. With these parameters, we estimated a power of
78% to detect a 50% increase in depression (from 8% to 12%) and
over 99% power to detect a doubling (from 8% to 16%).
Sample data were weighted using Current Population Survey
(CPS) data derived from the Census Bureau to ensure that the
sample was nationally representative in terms of age and gender
distributions in 2005. As no sampling was conducted for Wave 2,
only population-based adjustments were used. Details on the
construction of the post-stratification weights are available in the
supporting information (Text S1 and Tables S1, S2, S3). All
analyses reported herein are based on the weighted data. In
addition to reflecting true household clusters, standardized errors
also reflect variance in weights. [25].
We also conducted four sensitivity analyses. First, to account for
missing responses, we employed multiple imputation using
switching regression, an iterative multivariable regression tech-
nique. We used internal imputation for missing responses in
individual items in the scales of social relationship quality (,3%
missing) and covariates (,5% missing). There were no notable
differences between results from the imputed and non-imputed
datasets, and here we report results from the latter. Second, for
analyses on participants with a spouse or partner, we added an
additional covariate for change in partnership status to the
multivariable models, which produced very similar effect sizes and
no significant differences. Third, we repeated all analyses using
unweighted data, with no significant differences in results detected.
Fourth, we conducted analyses on the subsample of participants
without major depression at baseline and report relevant results
below.
Significance level for all tests was set at p,.05 (95% CI
excluding one) and tests were two-tailed. Data were analyzed using
Stata version 12 (Stata Corp.).
Results
Characteristic of Participants
Table 1 provides baseline characteristics of the 4,642 study
participants. Women comprised just slightly more than half of the
sample and 92% were white. Five hundred fifty-nine participants
(12.3%) had a major depressive episode at baseline. The mean
score on the overall quality of social relationships was 1.82.
Participants more commonly reported strain rather than lack of
support in their social relationships. The majority did not have
markers of social isolation.
Relationship between Quality of Social Relationships and
Depression
We first examined whether the overall of quality of social
relationships at baseline predicted occurrence of major depressive
episodes at follow-up. Across all types of social relationships, poor
quality in core relationships was associated with a significantly
higher risk of depression (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.65; 95%
CI, 1.86­3.76), even after accounting for the predictive power of
baseline major depression and other covariates. In secondary
analyses including all types of social relationships, both strain
(AOR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.49­2.76) and lack of support (AOR, 1.79;
95% CI, 1.36­2.36) were also associated with increased risk of
depression (Table 2). In sensitivity analysis among partnered
participants who did not have a major depressive episode at
baseline (n = 3,154), results were still highly significant (for overall
poor quality: AOR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.71­3.76; for social strain:
AOR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.64­3.29; for lack of social support: AOR,
1.57; 95% CI, 1.14­2.16).
In secondary analyses, we assessed relationships only with family
and friends, including all participants, even those without a
partner. Again we found that overall poor quality in relationships
was a significant predictor of depression. Additionally, sensitivity
analysis among participants who did not have a major depressive
episode at baseline (n = 4,083) also showed significant results.
Relationship between Quality of Different Types of Social
Relationships and Depression
The type of social relationship also affected depression risk
(Table 3). In this secondary analysis, poor overall quality of
relationship with one's spouse/partner (AOR, 1.47; 95% CI,
1.16­1.87) and family members (AOR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.10­1.90)
significantly and independently increased risk of depression. In
contrast, the overall quality of relationships with friends did not
independently predict subsequent depression (AOR, 1.21; 95%
CI,.84­1.72).
Similarly, in sensitivity analysis where participants without a
spouse or partner were included, poor quality of relationships with
family members but not friends significantly increased risk of
depression. In the subset of participants without major depression
at baseline (n = 3,133), poor quality of relationship with one's
spouse/partner (AOR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.10­1.93) significantly and
independently increased risk of depression, but results were not
significant for family members (AOR, 1.27; 95% CI,.90­1.79) or
friends (AOR, 1.43; 95% CI,.95­2.16).

Predicted Probability of Depression Depending on
Quality of Social Relationships
Using our multivariable logistic regression model from our
primary analyses, we estimated the composite effect of the overall
quality of participants' social relationships with family, friends, and
spouse/partner at baseline on likelihood of developing depression
ten years later. Those with the highest quality social relationships
(top decile) had just a 6.7% chance of major depression (95% CI,
5.3­8.1; p,.001), whereas those with the lowest quality (bottom
decile) had a 14.0% chance (95% CI, 12.0­16.0; p,.001).
Figure 1 presents the estimated risk of depression, illustrating a
``dose-dependent'' effect of impairment in quality of social
relationship on risk for major depression.
Relationship between Social Isolation and Depression
Data on frequency of social contact were available for
relationships with family, friends, and neighbors. In the model,
lack of contact with each type of social relationship at baseline was
included as a separate predictor variable. Results indicated that
lack of social contact, whether with family (AOR, 1.02; 95%
CI,.95­1.09), friends (AOR, 1.00; 95% CI,.94­1.06), or neighbors
(AOR, 1.03; 95% CI,.96­1.11), did not predict risk of depression.
Furthermore, being married (AOR, 1.12; 95% CI,.88­1.44) or
having a romantic partner (AOR, 1.10; 95% CI,.85­1.42) at
baseline was not associated with future depression.
Interactive Effects of Social Isolation and Quality of Social
Relationships
We were interested in whether frequency of social contact acted
as a moderator on the impact of overall quality of social
relationships on depression. In the case of both family (AOR,
2.72; 95% CI,.67­11.1) and friends (AOR,.89; 95% CI,.42­1.90),
lack of contact did not significantly interact with quality of
relationship. We also examined whether there was an interaction

Discussion
Importance of Considering of Social Relationships in
Mental Health
This observational study of a large nationally representative
community cohort demonstrates that the quality of social
relationships­even after accounting for baseline depression and
other important potential confounders­predicts future depression.
Results were similar when analyses were restricted to those
participants without major depression at baseline, which suggests
that the predictive power of social relationship quality is not
explained by depression's influence on self-report of one's social
relationships. Remarkably, this effect appears to be very durable,
predicting development of clinically significant depression ten
years later. This long-term effect extends earlier studies that have
demonstrated that negative social interactions predict negative
affect three months later [26] and that perceived social support
predicts depression outcome up to three years later. [16].
Both the negative and positive qualities of the relationship were
independently predictive of depression, with the effect of negative
aspects being modestly stronger. Prior cross-sectional studies have
pointed out the detrimental effect of negative social interactions,
[9,27] though the bulk of the literature focuses on the positive
aspects of social support. We reinforce here the importance of
social strain­not just support­when considering mental health. In
addition, our data suggest the value of evaluating overall quality of
social relationships as a risk factor for depression.
When assessing the quality of social relationships, it also appears
worthwhile to consider which type of social relationship has strain
or lacks support. Specifically, our data suggests that having
problems especially with one's spouse and less so with other family
members­but not friends­each exert an independent effect on
depression risk. This extends and corroborates earlier cross-
sectional research that showed not getting along with one's spouse
was related to more psychiatric disorders than not getting along
with relatives or friends. [15] Health care providers should
remember that patients' relationships with their loved ones likely
play a central role in their medical care, [28] whereas weaker
social ties tend to impact other aspects of life. [29].
We did not find support for our hypothesis, that frequency of
social contact would impact the likelihood of future depression.
Moreover, our analyses on interactions indicated that even if
participants had little contact with their family or friends, this
social isolation did not moderate the effect of quality of social
relationships on subsequent depression risk. Though objective
social isolation­social network characteristics such as few or
infrequently contacted social relationships­has been associated
with mental illness, the association appears to be weak. [8] Our
results thus support the argument that subjective components of
social relationships are more critical to one's health than objective
characteristics of one's social network. This is a robust finding that
has been observed not only for mental health outcomes [17,30]
but also for cardiovascular disease, [31], disability, [32] and
mortality. [33].
We estimate that one in seven adults who have social
relationships in the bottom decile of relationship quality will
develop major depression years later, whereas, just one in fifteen of
those with the highest quality of social relationships will develop
depression, suggesting substantial benefits at the population-level if
people can learn how to improve the quality of their social
relationships. This sort of effect size is clinically meaningful and
can be illustrated by comparing it to other research on risk factors
for major health outcomes. Specifically, data from the famous
Framingham study indicate the following: to achieve a similar
reduction in ten-year risk of a myocardial infarction from 15% to
7%, a 60-year-old non-smoker with a systolic blood pressure of
120 mm not on pharmacotherapy for hypertension would have to
have his total cholesterol decrease from 300 mg/dL to 200 mg/dL
and HDL cholesterol increase from 40 mg/dL to 60 mg/dL. [34].
Implications for Interventions
Social relationships may be a critical target for public health
officials and clinicians alike: the magnitude of effect is sizable, the
prevalence of poor quality social relationships is high, and the
population-level morbidity of major depressive disorder is among
the highest of any condition. Asking patients about their subjective
perceptions of their social relationships should be a priority.
Including questions in the clinical encounter about, for instance,
how much others care and understand the patient, as well as how
much others' criticize and let the patient down should be
considered evidence-based, much like inquiring about past
depressive episodes.
Furthermore, treatments that focus on ameliorating one's social
relationships may be a particularly helpful for depression. One
treatment strategy is via individual psychotherapy that modifies
patients' emotional or cognitive perceptions about their interper-
sonal relationships. Two time-limited, evidence-based psychother-
apies, cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy, are
effective treatments for depression and can be used to directly
target problems with social relationships. Indeed, a large meta-
analysis found cognitive therapy approaches to be the most
efficacious for lonely subjects. [35] Interpersonal psychotherapy­
which can focus on areas such as conflicts in one's social
relationships­is efficacious as both acute and maintenance
treatment for depression, [36] though dissemination remains
low. [37] Public health officials and policy makers should consider
supporting broader investigation and uptake of these treatments.
Given our results showing the strength of spouse/partner
relationship quality as a predictor for depression, the broader
use of couples therapy might also be considered. Couples therapy­
in which both partners attend sessions led by a therapist with the
aim of promoting supportive aspects of their relationship and
reducing patterns of negative interaction­has been shown to be
effective for mild to moderate depression. [14] It may also be
worthwhile investigating its potential as a preventive treatment for
major depression.
Limitations
Several limitations of this study deserve mention. First,
confounding by unmeasured variables is a threat in any
observational study, perhaps even more so in studies like this that
examines social determinants of health. However, we have utilized
advanced statistical methods to address potential confounding and
offer conservative estimates of confidence intervals. Third, though
this study was longitudinal it only contains two timepoints for
analysis. As a consequence, it is possible that in the long interim
interval participants' quality of social relationships varied.
However, prior research has indicated that negative social
interactions, at least in older adults, is quite stable over years.
[38] Fourth, these analyses lack the granularity in data to
distinguish between incident and recurrent major depression,
though given the age of participants and the known epidemiology
of depression, it is likely that many cases were recurrent.
Therefore, we are unable to report whether social relationship

quality is more or less of a predictor for first-episode or recurrent
depression. Finally, several measures relied on participants' recall
of over the prior year, a lengthy period of time.
Conclusion
In summary, this study suggests that social relationships may be
an important area to target among adults at risk for clinical
depression. The mantra that quality is more important than
quantity appears true in the effect of social relationships on
depression. The magnitude of effect of social relationship quality
on risk for depression is comparable with the effect of well-
established biological risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
Interventions for individuals with low quality of social relation-
ships, and therefore high risk for future major depressive episodes,
merit more investigation and dissemination.
