Abstract. We study the effect of stylistic differences on the nature of pictorial spaces as they appear
to an observer when looking into a picture. Four pictures chosen from diverse styles of depiction
were studied by 2 different methods. Each method addresses pictorial depth but draws on a different
bouquet of depth cues. We find that the depth structures are very similar for 8 observers, apart from
an idiosyncratic depth scaling (up to a factor of 3). The differences between observers generalize
over (very different) pictures and (very different) methods. They are apparently characteristic of the
person. The differences between depths as sampled by the 2 methods depend upon the style of the
picture. This is the case for all observers except one.
Keywords: depth perception, picture perception, art perception, pictorial space, artistic style, natural perspective.
1Introduction
Representational pictorial material is very diverse. This is not just because of the subject matter, which
by no means has to be "realistic" in the sense of depicting some actual or historical event in the wid-
est sense. More importantly for this paper, pictorial material need not be in a photographic mode
(Gombrich, 1960). Here "photographic mode" applies equally well to imaginary scenes (say, illustra-
tions to a science fiction story) as to depictions of actual scenes. Although a watertight definition is
not possible, the photographic mode involves a commitment of the artist to at least natural perspective
and emulation of generic materials in reasonable light fields. In a more restricted definition, this would
imply linear perspective (e.g., use of a computer graphics package) and physical shading (e.g., use of
a ray tracing algorithm).
"Natural perspective" roughly coincides with Euclid's optics and concerns such issues as the
decrease of apparent size with distance, occlusions, height in the visual field, and so forth, whereas
"linear perspective" pertains to a formal projection of directions from a fixed point on a given plane.
A formal projection permits one to draw quantitative inferences from a picture. Given some additional
prior information, it may yield a veridical scale of range or distance differences up to some unknown
ambiguity. Examples of formal projections are common in architectural renderings, but very rare in the
visual arts. In this paper, we intentionally avoid such cases.
A certain form of "realism" was aimed at by the classical Western art academies (e.g., the Paris
Académie des Beaux-Arts). They offered courses that trained artists to do manually what nowadays a
computer graphics system might achieve. Realism is generally aimed for by modern computer graph-
ics. In the case of the visual arts, even in the best cases, this merely technical part was then used as a
framework for an artistic achievement. It is seen full blown in the French "Art pompiers" (artists such
as Jean-Léon Gerôme, William-Adolphe Bougereau, ...), to mention a familiar example (Harding,
Interaction of depth probes and style of depiction
529 van Doorn et al.
1979). This is specific to a minor corner of Western art though. "Photorealism" is used mainly as a
gimmick in the arts, and even soon after the introduction of linear perspective in the Renaissance,
painters intentionally deviated from it. In generic works of arts there is no such a thing as "veridical
depth".
In this paper, we consider also art from other cultures and periods, cases where not even the
natural perspective constraint necessarily applies. Yet, such art may be perfectly "representational"
(Gombrich, 1960). Think of the Altamira or Lascaux animal, for instance.
When one considers an art work, one may either look at the work or into the work. The distinc-
tion is categorical (Koenderink, van Doorn, & Wagemans, 2011). In looking at the work, one is aware
of a planar surface (we restrict ourselves here to canvasses, panels, paper, and so forth) covered with
pigments in a certain arrangement. In looking into the work, one is aware of a pictorial world, not
only two-fold extended, but also articulated in depth. It is this latter mode we are interested in here. Of
course, this does not imply that not both aspects are of importance in the aesthetic evaluation of the
work. They almost invariably are.
When looking into a work, one becomes aware of a pictorial world. Its spatial ("simultaneous
presence") aspect is "pictorial space". Pictorial space may be variously articulated. In highly articulate
instances, one has a feeling of "depth" at nearly every location in the picture plane. This depth is a sca-
lar variable. Since the eye is generally not itself in pictorial space, there is no natural origin. Only depth
differences are significant. Neither is there a natural unit of depth. Thus, the depth dimension is at best
an affine line. In many cases, the depth dimension might be even less structured. (see Koenderink
et al., 2011 for an elaboration of these notions.) "Pictorial depth" is to a large extent idiosyncratic. In
the absence of a ground truth, it can only be operationally defined. Depending on the particular opera-
tionalization, observer, viewing mode, and so forth, one is bound to find different results.
We have developed a number of methods (van Doorn, Wagemans, de Ridder, & Koenderink,
2011; van Doorn, Koenderink, & Wagemans, 2011; Wagemans, van Doorn, & Koenderink, 2011a, b)
that allow one to determine depth differences between locations in pictorial space that correspond to
points in the picture plane. These values depend both on the picture and on the observer. They are to
be considered formal elements of a first person account. The depth differences are only operationally
defined, that is to say, they are created in the course of the measurement. Their values are to be consid-
ered indeterminate in the absence of an actual measurement. This distinction is key in understanding
the difference between physical measurements and measurements of phenomenological experiences.
All of these methods exploit the observer's sensitivities to certain classes of depth cues (Berkeley,
1709; Gibson, 1971; Palmer, 1999; von Helmholtz, 1856). Thus, the methods are mutually distinct,
and there is no reason to expect that different methods would yield similar values. The results depend
(among other things) on the mix of depth cues intentionally introduced by the artist so as to evoke
a certain awareness in prospective observers. They also depend upon the abilities of the observer to
"read" the artist's intentions. In this study, we use only persons of generic Western cultural background
as observers, whereas we vary the "style" of the works, that is to say, the bouquet of cues intention-
ally used by the artists. This is partly due to obvious constraints. For instance, we cannot hope to be
able to use eighteenth century Japanese connoisseurs as observers in the experiment, whereas modern
Japanese are intimately familiar with linear perspective through the medium of photography.
So, here are the hypotheses that we put to the test in this study. Because the various methods ex-
ploit different depth cues, it is to be expected that they will give rise to different results for instances of
depiction that exploit or ignore specific depth cues. Specifically, in cases where the relative size cue is
ignored, as in the case of many depictions from the non-Western cultures, we predict that depth probes
based on the relative size cue will be preferentially affected. In this paper, we select methods of depth
probing and styles of depiction that will likely show up such effects. Specifically, we consider styles
that do or do not respect the immediate consequences of natural perspective. In doing this, we contrast
paintings that lean somewhat towards photographic realism with depictions that have (at least partly)
different objectives.
2 Design of the experiment
2.1 Picture material
We selected two paintings from French nineteenth century art, though not from the mainstream aca-
demic tradition, but from the contemporary avant garde. One is a painting by Caillebotte, another a
painting by Pisarro (Figure 1, top row). Both are easel paintings of considerable size. Both respect
Depth probes and style of depiction 530
natural perspective or even a trace of linear perspective (Alberti, 1972; Gombrich, 1960; Pirenne,
1970). One consequence of this is that the size of depiction of familiar objects (say humans) depends
strongly upon their intended distance from the viewer. (Just measure the size of the depicted persons in
picture coordinates.) Apart from such "familiar size" cues, there are numerous additional cues to depth
that are used expertly by both painters. We refer to these pictures as Picture I [`La Récolte des Foins,
Eragny' by Camille Pisarro (1830­1903); Figure 1, top left] and Picture II [`Portraits à la Campagne'
by Gustave Caillebotte (1848­1994); Figure 1 top right]. Notice that the Pisarro painting can hardly be
said to implement formal linear perspective, whereas the Caillebotte painting has the facade in fairly
precise linear perspective rendering. Even in the latter case, one hardly obtains anything like a "ground
truth" without many additional assumptions. Both paintings evidently respect natural perspective.
We also selected an example from eighteenth century Japan by Koryusai, and a miniature painting
by Davron (Figure 1, bottom row). Both are rather smallish pictures, printed or painted on paper in wa-
ter media. In both cases, the artists to some extent ignore natural perspective, in that farther objects are
not depicted noticeably smaller than closer objects of the same type. (Again, the pictures contain nu-
merous humans.) Occlusion and height in the visual field are respected, though there is no implied eye
height. The artists expertly use a number of other cues. In the case of the Japanese picture, there exists
an approximate framework that is different from linear perspective but likewise offers similar formal
methods of construction and measurement. The picture is constructed in an informal isometric projec-
tion and contains numerous global straight lines and nominally right angles. We refer to these pictures
as Picture III [the miniature by contemporary Davron Toshev (Bukhara, Uzbekistan); Figure 1, bottom
left] and Picture IV [`The tea ceremony' by Isoda Koryusai (1735­1790); Figure 1, bottom right].
The pictures have been selected in such a way that Pictures I (Pisarro) and III (Toshev) are com-
paratively "open" (both are landscapes with a far view), whereas Pictures II (Caillebotte) and IV
(Koryusai) are comparatively "closed" (each a group of people engaged in some social gathering, one
a garden terrace and the other a room interior). Moreover, the number and general spatial distribution
of persons, vegetation, walls, furniture, and so forth, are pairwise comparable.

531 van Doorn et al.
The pictures are presented on a computer screen [DELL U2410f monitor, 1,920 × 1,200 pixels
liquid crystal display (LCD) screen], each picture filling the screen as much as possible. Thus, they are
seen in similar sizes, quite unlike their actual dimensions. The widths of the pictures on the screen are
42 cm (Picture I), 38.5 cm (Picture II), 42 cm (Picture III) and 51.8 cm (Picture IV). In viewing the
pictures, the observers are positioned at a fixed distance (78 cm), centered with respect to the screen.
They view the screen monocularly with their dominant eye, the other eye being patched. Apart from
the screen, the room was in darkness.
2.2Participants
Eight observers participated in the experiment. Four of these observers were paid to participate and
were naïve regarding the aims of the project (BC, EL, MN, RL). The remaining four were the authors
(AD, JK, JW, ML).
2.3Methods
We selected two methods that each sampled the depth difference between a pair of points in the pic-
ture. The methods are very different. One method uses probes that directly exploit the relative size
cue (Wagemans et al., 2011b), whereas the other method (Wagemans et al., 2011a) does not. Thus,
we expect the different styles to interact with the methods, as explained in the introduction. We refer
to the methods as Method A (also referred to as "pointing") and B (also referred to as "relative size").
In Method A (pointing; see Appendix), the observer points from one point to another in pictorial
space (Wagemans et al., 2011a). This involves superimposing a pointer and a target on the picture.
The method does not depend explicitly on the relative size cue. We have extensive experience with
this method.
In Method B (relative size; see Appendix), the observer adjusts the relative size of a pair of marks,
so as to experience them as equally large in pictorial space (Wagemans et al., 2011b). Thus, this meth-
od depends crucially on the relative size cue. We also have extensive experience with this method.
In Method A (pointing), the obtained depth differences are proportional to the size of the image, in
Method B (relative size) they are not. In order to render the values from the two methods comparable,
we normalize the depths from Method A (pointing) by the diagonal of each image. This scaling is ir-
relevant for the final results.
Both methods are succinctly described in the Appendix. More extensive discussions of the meth-
ods are available elsewhere (Wagemans et al., 2011a, 2011b).
3Experiment
3.1 Method A (pointing)
We defined five fiducial points in each picture (the red colored dots in Figure 1). These points have
been chosen so as to cover the depth range. They are located so that they easily "attach" to objects in
pictorial space. This latter requirement is crucial. If one puts a mark on the picture plane, it appears
either as a mark on the picture plane (say, a fly speck in the sky area of a photograph) or it immerses in
pictorial space and moves into depth until it attaches to the nearest (in depth) pictorial object. This hap-
pens quite naturally, as is evident from the mustaches and black teeth one often sees in poster boards
depicting politicians. It is closely related to the art of painting itself, for every brush stroke (with the
possible exception of the painter's signature) behaves in precisely the same way. Painting would not
exist were it not for this peculiar effect, for which no scientific explanation is readily available.
Using Method A (pointing), we determine the point configuration for these five fiducial points in
pictorial space. For any given picture, it turns out to be at least qualitatively similar for all observers.
Each observer repeats the measurements, doing three sessions in total. From these repeated meas-
urements, we obtain an estimate of the significance of each observer's data. This allows us to compare
observers. For any given picture, we find that although the depths for all observers correlate highly,
there exist very significant differences in the overall depth ranges. There also exist very significant
differences in the overall depth ranges for different pictures.
The median depth over all sessions of all observers yields a convenient overview of the results
(see Figure 2). In this figure, we have plotted "ground plans" of the point configurations in depth, thus
the horizontal axis is the horizontal location in the picture, whereas the vertical axis plots the depth val-
ues. We have normalized all ground plans to the same aspect ratio. A comparison of the ground plans
with the locations indicated in Figure 1 will most likely agree with the intuitions of the reader. All
Depth probes and style of depiction 532
observers agreed closely on the shape (but not necessarily the magnitude) of the configuration. This
is evident from the correlations of the median depth over the sessions of an observer with the overall
grand median depth. The lowest coefficient of determination (R2) over all pictures is .94, whereas
typical values are .99. This indicates that all observers are aware of very similar pictorial spaces as
measured by Method A (pointing).
Although the shapes of the depth configurations are indeed very similar for all observers, their
depth ranges are quite different (see Figure 3). This is also evident from the slopes of the regression
lines of the median depth over the sessions of an observer with the grand median depths. We find that
the ratios of the largest to the smallest slopes are between 2.08 and 2.76, depending upon the picture.
Whether these differences are typical of an observer may be judged by considering the profile of
slope values for a given picture. When we correlate these profiles for different pairs of pictures, we
find coefficients of determination (R2) between .24 and .81 (see Table 1). Thus, observers are rather
consistent over (very) different pictures. The slopes are not random, but characteristic of an observer.
For a given style [Pictures I-II (Pisarro and Caillebotte) or Pictures III-IV (Toshev and Koryusai)], the
correlations are quite high, whereas this is perhaps less evident when different styles are compared.
For a given style, the profiles are very significantly correlated, which means that the differences are
observer-specific. This holds true even when different styles are compared, although to a lesser extent.
3.2 Method B (relative size)
We defined ten fiducial points in each picture. Five of these are identical to the fiducial points used
with Method A (pointing; the red colored ones in Figure 1). The additional points are shown as yellow
dots in Figure 1.
The reason for the different number of fiducial points is that Method B (relative size) yields results
much quicker than Method A (pointing). We do not want sessions in excess of an hour (we typically

(I 5 Pisarro, II 5 Caillebotte, III 5 Toshev, IV 5 Koryushai). The points correspond to the red points in Figure 1.
The horizontal axis is the horizontal location in the picture, whereas the vertical axis plots the median depth values
over all sessions of all observers. Thus, the thin lines indicate pure depth variation. (Aspect ratios have been
equalized for easy reference.)

533 van Doorn et al.
aim at half an hour), nor do we want to distribute a task over more than a single session. From earlier
experience, we have reasons to believe that the characteristics of a single observer may change over
longer time spans. These are important constraints that largely determine our choices.
Using Method B (relative size), we determine the point configuration for these ten fiducial points
in pictorial space. For any given picture, it turns out to be at least qualitatively similar for all observ-
ers. Each observer repeats the measurements, performing three sessions in total. From these repeated
measurements, we obtain an estimate of the significance of each observer's data. This again allows us
to compare observers. First conclusions are much like in the previous task. For any given picture, we
find that although the depths for all observers correlate highly, there exist very significant differences
in the overall depth ranges. There also exist very significant differences in the overall depth ranges for
different pictures.
The median depths over all sessions of all observers are shown in Figure 4. They are plotted in the
same format as Figure 2 (see legend of this figure). Again, a comparison of the ground plans with the
locations indicated in Figure 1 will most likely agree with the intuitions of the reader. All observers
agreed closely on the shape (but not necessarily the depth range) of the configuration. This is evident
from the correlations of the median depth over the sessions of an observer with the overall grand me-
dian depth. The lowest coefficient of determination (R2) over all pictures is .81, whereas typical values
exceed .95. This indicates that all observers are aware of very similar pictorial spaces as measured with
Method B (relative size).
Although the shapes of the depth configurations are indeed very similar for all observers, their
depth ranges are again quite different (see Figure 5). This is evident from the slopes of the regression
lines of the median depth over the sessions of an observer with the grand median depths. We find that
the ratios of the largest to the smallest slopes are between 1.70 and 3.48, depending upon the picture.
Whether these differences are typical of an observer may be judged by considering the profile of slope
values for a given picture. When we correlate these profiles for different pairs of pictures, we find coef-
ficients of determination (R2) that all vary between .01 and .73 (see Table 2). For a given style [Pictures

I-II (Pisarro and Caillebotte) or Pictures III-IV (Toshev and Koryushai)], the correlations are quite
high, whereas this is not the case when different styles are compared. For a given style, the profiles
are very significantly correlated, which means that the differences are observer-specific for that case.
3.3Analysis
An important question is whether the depth configurations obtained through the two mutually very dif-
ferent methods are similar. This can be approached directly through a correlation of the grand median
depths obtained through the two methods. Of course, we can only correlate the five points used in
both Methods A (pointing) and B (relative size). We find coefficients of determination (R2) of .91 for
Picture I (Pisarro), .86 for Picture II (Caillebotte), .99 for Picture III (Toshev), and .98 for Picture IV
(Koryushai). We conclude that the results of the two methods agree very well.
Another important question is whether the profiles of slopes over observers for a given picture
are similar for the two methods. This can be approached through a correlation of the profiles obtained
through the two methods. We find coefficients of determination (R2) of .08 for Picture I (Pisarro), .01
for Picture II (Caillebotte), .12 for Picture III (Toshev), and .16 for Picture IV (Koryushai). We con-
clude that the idiosyncrasies found in either method agree hardly at all. Apparently, the differences
between observers do not generalize both over pictures and over methods.
Stylistic differences might be expected when comparing Methods A (pointing) and B (relative
size) for Pictures I-II (Pisarro and Caillebotte) versus Pictures III-IV (Toshev and Koryushai). This is
borne out by the results. For instance, in Figure 6, we show a comparison for Pictures I (Pisarro) and
III (Toshev) for observer JW. It is evident that the slopes of the regression lines both exceed one [thus,
the depth range from Method B (relative size) exceeds that from Method A (pointing)] and that the
slope of the regression line for Picture I (Pisarro) exceeds that for Picture III (Toshev). The fact that
both slopes exceed one is in itself not remarkable (after all, the methods are quite different), but the
fact that the slopes are different for the two pictures is relevant. The ratio of the slopes is a measure of
the ratio of depth ranges obtained via the two methods.
The trend for observer JW (Figure 6) can be found in the results of all observers but one (JK). In
Figure 7 we give whisker box plots over all observers. The ratios for Pictures I (Pisarro) and II (Cail-
lebotte) exceed these for Pictures III (Toshev) and IV (Koryushai).

Thus, there is a distinction to be made for pictures that largely commit to the consequences of
natural perspective [especially the dependence of apparent size on depth, Pictures I (Pisarro) and II
(Caillebotte)] and those who largely ignore the issue of the dependence of apparent size on depth [Pic-
tures III (Toshev) and IV (Koryushai)]. This was expected, as explained in the Introduction.
4Discussion
One major result of the experiment is clear-cut: We could differentiate certain styles on the basis of the
measurement of pictorial depth differences. This result is interesting in its own right, since typically
the differentiation of style is left to "expert opinion" (Gombrich, 1960). It is not at all that easy to make
the distinction on the basis of image characteristics. Most "obvious" measures that one might suggest
actually depend upon implicit assumptions of the "expert opinion" type.
That the methods and the pictures we selected yield this result is--of course--not entirely un-
expected, since we expressly selected them for this. When the interest is in a different set of stylistic
elements, one would evidently select a different set of methods. Thus, we regard the present study as
opening up a new realm of endeavor.
What this result vividly illustrates is the fact that "pictorial depth" is not something that is deter-
mined by the picture itself, in the sense that there would be a principled way to decide on the basis
of the picture whether a set of depth assignments would be "correct". Pictorial depth as measured
(otherwise it is a mere qualitative attribute someone ascribes to a picture) is necessarily operationally
defined. Any method has to address a certain bouquet of "depth cues", either very generally, or rather
specifically.
A most useful consequence is that methods can be focused on certain aspects of picture construc-
tion. This is the notion that we attempted to exploit in this study. We believe this concept to have
numerous different applications.
We find that observers are mutually very consistent over very different pictures and very different
methods in their awareness of the shape of depth configurations (Figures 2 and 4). This is encouraging

of depth range ratios over all observers. The whisker box plots show the medians, interquartile ranges and the
extreme values. The variation is dominated by a single outlier (observer JK).

to those who are interested in exploiting the "one picture is worth more than a thousand words" prov-
erb. Pictures do convey largely unambiguous impressions, even when the style of depiction is not the
preferred one in a person's cultural environment. Apparently, the visual awarenesses of our observers
when looking into the pictures were very similar. Moreover, the depth configurations did hardly de-
pend upon the method to measure them.
We found the depth ranges to be very idiosyncratic though. Apparently, observers experience the
same pictorial space modulo some idiosyncratic depth scaling that evades our understanding. We sim-
ply have to accept that observers are different, we cannot account for it. This is essentially the message
of the sculptor Hildebrand in his 1893 book Das Problem der Form ("On the problem of form"). Al-
though very basic and important, this is rarely recognized in the modern literature (Hildebrand, 1893).
In summary, this type of comparative study yields very rich information about how different styles
of depiction yield different types of "pictorial space" as a function of different types of measurements.
There are numerous problems that might be immediately attacked by a similar approach.

Appendix
A1 Method A (pointing)
In this method (Wagemans et al., 2011a), we superimpose the pictures of a pointer and of a target on
the picture (see Figure A1). The superimposed pictures are fairly small. They tend to be perceived in
pictorial space, apparently moving into depth until stopped by the nearest pictorial object. The picture
of the pointer is the rendering of a three-dimensional (3D) arrow. It is parameterized by slant and tilt
angles. In the experiment, the observer adjusts these angles such that the pointer appears to point at
the target in pictorial space.
The tilt angle is the component of the direction of the pointer in the picture plane. As expected,
observers adjust the tilt such that the pointer points at the target in the picture plane. This is only to
be expected, thus the tilt angle is not informative with respect to the depth structure. One finds minor
systematic deviations; we have reported on such effects elsewhere. It is further ignored.
The slant angle is the component of the direction of the pointer in depth. It runs from minus 90°
(pointer looks as pointing towards the viewer) to plus 90° (pointer looks like pointing purely in depth).
When pointer and target are separated by a stretch L in the picture plane (say), and the slant angle is A,
then we define the depth difference between pointer and target to be L Tan A, that is, the stretch times
the tangent of the slant. We find slight differences between pointing from P to Q and pointing from
Q to P. These differences are minor and idiosyncratic, though significant. We have reported on them
elsewhere (Wagemans et al., 2011a). Here, we simply take the average depth difference.
After finding the depth differences between a number of points (N points say), we attempt to
find the point configuration in pictorial space. Notice that there are N (N21) ordered point pairs,
N (N21)/2 independent values after averaging two-way pointings, as explained above. We attempt to
account for these observed values in terms of N depth values. Because absolute depth remained inde-
terminate, we simply constrain the average depth to zero. This leaves us with N21 degrees of freedom
to account for N (N21)/2 observed values. The problem is overdetermined for N > 2, severely so if
N >> 2, thus we find a best solution in the least-squares sense and check consistency. We find that the
observations can always be explained with an N-point configuration in pictorial space. This is crucial,
the method would not be valid otherwise.
We end up with N depth values, their average being constrained to zero.As a final step, we normal-
ize the depth values for the size of the picture. Thus, any depth difference is specified as such and so
a fraction of the picture size.
A2 Method B (relative size)
In this method (Wagemans et al., 2011b), we superimpose a pair of discs on the picture (see FigureA2).
The ratio of the diameters of the disks is a parameter, whereas the product of their diameters is held
fixed. The disks (like the pointer and target in Method A) attach themselves to points in pictorial space.
They are seen as planar disks or sometimes spheres. Observers adjust the parameter in such a way that
it looks to them as if the objects were of the same size in pictorial space, the apparent size difference
being ascribed to a depth difference. We take log R (the natural logarithm of the size ratio) as the depth
difference. (This relation derives from very simple first principles; we have derived it in Wagemans
et al., 2011b.)
Again, after finding the depth differences between a number of points (N points say), we at-
tempt to find the point configuration in pictorial space. We attempt to account for the observed depth
Figure A1. A "pointer" (arrow at right) and "target" (polyhedron at left) as used in the experiment. Pointer and
target are superimposed over the picture. The observer may change the apparent spatial attitude of the pointer
in such a way that it appears to "point to the target" [the broken yellow line in this figure indicates the pointing
direction, it is (of course) not present in the actual experiment]. The spatial attitude of the pointer is defined via the
3D computer graphics; its parameters (tilt and slant angles) are used as the observer's response.

differences for N (N21)/2 point pairs in terms of N depth values. We again constrain the average
depth to zero, leaving us with N21 degrees of freedom. We find that the observations can always be
explained with an N-point configuration in pictorial space. This is crucial, the method would not be
valid otherwise. We end up with N depth values, their average being constrained to zero.
This method has been described in detail elsewhere (Wagemans et al., 2011b).
A3 Heuristic on depth range ratios
In this paper, we compare ratios of depth ranges. It is indeed necessary to do so, because depth ranges
per se are irrelevant. It is not possible to predict the depth range ratio from first principles. In this ap-
pendix, we present a heuristic. It has the additional advantage that it illustrates a number of potential
misunderstandings.
That there is no principled method to predict the depth range ratio is clear from the following ob-
servations. In the pointing method, the depth differences (and thus the depth ranges) are proportional
to the size of the picture. In the relative size method, the differences (and thus the depth ranges) are
independent of the size of the picture. Ergo, the ratio of depth ranges is dependent on the size of the
picture, it is not some fixed number. One way to "correct" for this is to scale the depth differences from
the pointing method by the size of the picture. This is what we do in the paper. It is essentially arbitrary.
However, in the context of the paper, this is not problematic at all because (in the final instance) we
only compare depth range ratios.
It remains an interesting issue what a typical depth range ratio might be (of course, taking picture
size into account). One possible heuristic is to consider a result we published a short time ago (Pont
et al., 2012). Observers view a rendering of a cube in "one point perspective" and are given the task to
adjust the perspective so as to look "like a cube". They are placed at diverse distances from the screen,
and the picture comes in many sizes. From an understanding of perspective, one expects the observers
to adjust the perspective in a predictable manner. Perhaps surprisingly, they don't. Human observers
prefer a standard "template" view over the "veridical" one. Deviations from the template look not
cubical, but like long corridors or thin slabs.
Figure A2. The relative size probe. The two disks are superposed over the picture. The geometrically mean size
is held constant, the ratio of diameters being controlled by the observer. We used fairly small disks that were
partially transparent. The task is to make the disks appear of equal size in pictorial space. In this figure, the disk
at left would be closer than the one at right.
Figure A3. A cube seen in "one-point perspective" (implying that there is only a single finite vanishing point, it is
the centre of each subfigure). At left, the viewing distance is very short, thus this is a wide-angle picture. (Notice
the perspective distortions of the spheres that mark the corners.) As measured in the picture plane, the back pane
is much smaller than the front pane. In reality they are equally large, though this is hard to "see". This looks more
like a deep corridor than like a cube. At right, the viewing distance is very large, thus this is a telephoto picture.
Front and back panes are almost equally large in the picture plane. This looks more like a flattish slab than like a
cube. At the centre is a view that most observers accept as a typical "picture of a cube". It looks like a cube from
any viewing distance.
539 van Doorn et al.
In the one-point perspective (Figure A3), we may easily construct a pointer with target and a pair
of relative size probes (Figure A4). This takes nothing but the conventional perspective constructions,
using vantage and distance points. From these synthetic probes, we may find the depth difference be-
tween pointer and target (divided by the edge length) and the depth difference from the relative sizes.
We simply apply the same calculations as used in the assessment of settings using Method A (pointing)
or B (relative size). Thus, we obtain a ratio of depth ranges. It is 0.183 for the preferred perspective.
For the long corridor (an extreme perspective), it is 5.76, and for the thin slab 0.029.
The ratio is higher when the perspective is stretched into depth, as when using a wide angle lens
on a camera, whereas it is lower when the perspective is squashed, as when using a telephoto lens on a
camera. Thus, the heuristic leads one to predict that the ratio of depth ranges will be higher for Pictures
I (Pisarro) and II (Caillebotte) than for Pictures III (Toshev) and IV (Koryusai), which we indeed find
to be the case.
Figure A4. Here the one points cube perspectives have been augmented with depth probes. At the left side of each
subfigure, a small cube acting as "pointer" in front and a "target" at the back. Pointer and target implement Method
A. The pointing is "correct" by construction. At the right side of each subfigure, two disks, one in front and the
other at the back. The two disks implement Method B. The relative size ratio is "correct" by construction. These
constructions are a standard application of linear perspective as conventionally taught to artists and technical
draftsmen.
