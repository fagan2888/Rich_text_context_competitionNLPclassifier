It has been widely acknowledged that qualitative researchers
who explore sensitive topics may expose themselves to emo-
tional distress (Bloor, Fincham, & Sampson, 2007; Dickson-
Swift, James, & Kippen, 2005; Dickson-Swift, James,
Kippen, & Liamputtong, 2006, 2008; Johnson & Clarke,
2003; Lee-Treweek & Linkogle, 2000). Hence, qualitative
researchers are often faced with the challenge of maintaining
emotional equilibrium during the research process (Coles &
Mudaly, 2010; Woodby, Williams, Wittich, & Burgio, 2011).
Nevertheless, discussion on the management of difficult
emotions has occupied a peripheral place within experiential
accounts of qualitative research practice (Holland, 2007).
There are, however, some notable contributions to our under-
standing of the emotional lives of qualitative researchers and
the strategies researchers use to manage emotional states.
For instance, Kleinman and Copp's (1993) Emotions and
Fieldwork is a seminal text on these issues. However, with
rare exceptions, the focus of published accounts is concen-
trated upon the analysis of emotional phenomena that emerge
during the collection of primary research data. Such accounts
are focused upon the emotional challenges of research
encounters that require interaction with research participants.
By comparison, there is an absence of an academic dialogue
around the emotional dimensions of working with secondary
data sources (Fincham, Scourfield, & Langer, 2008). This
may reflect an assumption that secondary analysis lacks the
interpersonal context within which emotional distress can
arise (Fincham et al., 2008), the possibility that secondary
analysis is considered to be less emotionally demanding
(Woodby et al., 2011), and the lack of a research culture in
the secondary analysis of qualitative data more generally
(Corti & Thompson, 2004).
Given the absence of interaction with participants, it is not
difficult to understand why there has been a neglect of the
emotional dimensions of secondary analysis or why second-
ary analysts, unlike fieldworkers, have not been presented as

Researching Distressing Topics: Emotional
Reflexivity and Emotional Labor in the
Secondary Analysis of Children and Young
People's Narratives of Abuse

Abstract
Qualitative researchers who explore sensitive topics may expose themselves to emotional distress. Consequently, researchers
are often faced with the challenge of maintaining emotional equilibrium during the research process. However, discussion
on the management of difficult emotions has occupied a peripheral place within accounts of research practice. With rare
exceptions, the focus of published accounts is concentrated on the analysis of the emotional phenomena that emerge
during the collection of primary research data. Hence, there is a comparative absence of a dialogue around the emotional
dimensions of working with secondary data sources. This article highlights some of the complex ways in which emotions
enter the research process during secondary analysis, and the ways in which we engaged with and managed emotional states
such as anger, sadness, and horror. The concepts of emotional labor and emotional reflexivity are used to consider the ways
in which we "worked with" and "worked on" emotion. In doing so, we draw on our collective experiences of working on
two collaborative projects with ChildLine Scotland in which a secondary analysis was conducted on children's narratives of
distress, worry, abuse, and neglect.

research accounts. This article highlights some of the com-
plex ways in which emotions enter the research process dur-
ing secondary data analysis. In doing so, we draw upon our
collective experiences of working on two projects in which
secondary analysis was conducted on both quantitative and
qualitative data extracted from the call records of ChildLine
Scotland1 (CLS), a confidential telephone counseling service
for children/young people aged 18 and younger in Scotland,
wherein children/young people's narratives of distress,
worry, abuse, and neglect are represented. Our experiences
of working with the qualitative data are the primary focus of
this article.
The first project examined children/young people's con-
cerns about the health and well-being of their parents and
significant others, and the second investigated children/
young people's concerns about their sexual health and well-
being. Both projects involved us reading and analyzing chil-
dren/young people's accounts of physical and sexual abuse.
The analysis of narrative accounts in which children/young
people disclosed these experiences were particularly chal-
lenging, and it is with the emotional challenges of analyzing
these that we reflect upon in this article.
During the course of the two projects and beyond, we dis-
cussed, wrote, and reflected upon our experiences of work-
ing with CLS data, and we draw upon these in this article. We
approach this article as both novice and experienced research-
ers. Kathryn was the principal investigator on both projects
and had extensive prior experience and expertise in qualita-
tive research in the area of children and families. Sharon was
employed as the research fellow on the first project, and then
as the research fellow and coinvestigator on the second proj-
ect. Elinor joined the research team during the second project
as a research fellow when Sharon left her post to take up a
permanent post in another institution. Sharon remained
involved in the second project as a coinvestigator. Sharon
was responsible for the data collection and analysis task in
the first project and the data collection task during the second
project. Elinor had primary responsibility for the data analy-
sis task during the second project. Kathryn was involved in
many of the analytical discussions that characterized our
"analytical meetings," and was involved in reading and
working with extracts of the data. For both Sharon and
Elinor, these projects represented their first academic
positions.
Before moving on to describe and reflect on our experi-
ences of working with the research data, this article will
connect with key strands of thought in relation to emotions
and qualitative research that have influenced our analysis.
We begin by locating emotion as a dimension of reflexivity.
We do so because the research process that we undertook
required an active engagement with emotional reflexivity,
and an acknowledgment that the research process was dis-
rupted by the emergence of distressing emotional states and
the requirement to manage these. We follow this by
considering Arlie Hochschild's conceptual thinking on
emotional labor, which has provided us with the "analytic
tools" (Kleinman, 2002, p. 381) to conceptualize our
experiences.
Emotional Reflexivity
Finlay (2002) reminds us,
As qualitative researchers, we understand that the researcher is a
central figure who influences the collection, selection and
interpretation of data. Our behaviour will always affect
participants' responses, thereby influencing the direction of
findings. Meanings are seen to be negotiated between researcher
and researched within a particular social context so that another
researcher in a different relationship will unfold a different story.
Research is thus regarded as a joint product of the participants,
the researcher, and their relationship: It is co-constituted. (p. 531)
The importance of accounting for the multiple ways in
which we as qualitative researchers influence our research is
considered fundamental to achieving and preserving integ-
rity and trustworthiness in qualitative research (Finlay,
2002). Consequently, qualitative researchers are required to
invoke a visible reflexive analysis that both evidences and
articulates their positionalities in relation to their epistemo-
logical and ontological positions, and their consequent
methodological and theoretical frameworks (Malacrida,
2007). More than this however, qualitative researchers are
also required to think about and explicitly acknowledge the
various ways in which their own unique biographies enter
into the research process. Thus, their lived experiences,
understandings, and perspectives, and their social position-
ing in relation to factors such as class, gender, race, and so
forth should also form part of their reflexive endeavors
(Finlay, 2002).
This process of reflexive analysis is considered to involve
"personal exposures" (Davis, 1998, p. 331) by the researcher
that facilitate the recognition of the role of the self in the
research process (Ely & Anzul, 1991; Strauss & Corbin,
1998). Reflexivity, however, goes beyond a simple account-
ing for dimensions of the self. Reflexive research practice
also requires that researchers both acknowledge and criti-
cally analyze how these dimensions of the self enter into and
influence their encounters with participants and the data that
are produced. This aspect of reflexivity is connected to social
constructionist understandings that consider the products of
qualitative research to be co-constructed through the inter-
subjective dynamics of the researcher­researched relation-
ship (Finlay, 2002). Hence, researchers are required to
consider not only how the self can influence and shape the
process and outcomes of their interactions with participants
but also how their participants contribute to this shaping.
It has become increasingly common for qualitative
research accounts to contain reflexive narratives that
Jackson et al. 3
incorporate "personal exposures" (Finlay, 2002). However,
despite the increasing trend toward "personalizing" research
accounts in such ways, Blackman (2007) contends that the
acceptance of emotion as a dimension of reflexivity has been
slow. As a consequence, the emotional self is rarely attended
to in research accounts (Coffey, 1999). Our own review of
the literature reveals that while the last two decades have
seen a peppering of articles that have sought to address emo-
tions and fieldwork, reflections upon the multiple ways in
which emotion is experienced and encountered remains most
firmly at the margins of scholarship. Thus, issues of emo-
tionality are only tangentially understood (Coffey, 1999),
and research accounts remain largely cleansed of such detail.
Despite the neglect of emotions as a dimension of reflex-
ivity, it has become increasingly acknowledged that reflexive
engagement with the emotional dimensions of research pro-
duction should be incorporated into our reflexive activities.
This is considered particularly crucial where researchers
engage in the examination of topics that can potentially dis-
rupt the emotional equilibrium of researchers (Woodby et al.,
2011). Central to this call for emotional reflexivity are con-
cerns about the extent to which researcher emotion influ-
ences the production of knowledge (Malacrida, 2007). Here,
as in other reflexive modes, there is a danger that the activity
of emotional reflexivity may become reduced to a confes-
sional act that involves the telling of emotional tales with a
view that this in itself constitutes reflexivity (and results in
the reduction of subjectivity). There is a danger that such
narratives can reduce reflexive endeavors to apologies that
situate emotion as antithetical to the achievement of objec-
tive knowledge. An unintended consequence of this is to
position knowledge generated through interpretivist ways of
knowing as less reliable than that which is positivistically
produced.
Emotional reflexivity, however, is about more than just
simply acknowledging phenomenon that may impede the
production of an "objective" knowledge (or at least a less
subjective one). It is also about more than the retrospective
"telling" of fieldwork tales to others or the sharing of what
may more properly be labeled as "reflections." Emotional
reflexivity in qualitative research is an active process that
requires researchers to invoke a reflexive agency throughout
the research process. Quite often, in their narratives of emo-
tions and fieldwork, researchers implicitly discuss active
reflexive processes that occur throughout the research pro-
cess. That is, researchers frequently discuss how they "work
on" and manage (or sometimes fail to manage) emotion in
the field through reflexive processes.
In his discussion of reflexivity and emotions, Rosenberg
(1990) makes the point that reflexivity fundamentally "refers
to the process of an entity acting back upon itself" and that
emotional reflexivity is epitomized by the harnessing of emo-
tions and/or emotional experiences as "objects of one's own
reflection and control" (p. 3). Consequently, Rosenberg
argues that the "work" that is done on emotions is achieved
through reflexive processes or reflexive work. Thus, he pos-
tulates that it is via reflexive processes that the internal
arousal states through which emotions are experienced (for
instance, physiological or bodily sensations) come to be
"worked over" (Rosenberg, 1990, p. 3). This "working over"
of emotion through reflexivity is considered to happen in
three ways: first, through interpretive processes wherein the
identification of emotion occurs; second, through the display
of emotion that may involve elements of work on the self to
produce intended effects on others; and third, through the
invocation of emotional experiences perhaps to induce pre-
ferred emotional states (for instance, this may happen when
the emotion being experienced produces a state of discom-
fort or distress).
Emotional Labor
Despite the marginalization of emotion as a dimension of
reflexivity, some accounts that attend to these issues derive
analyticalinsightfromArlieHochschild's(1983)Goffmanian
informed cultural analysis of emotions. While many accounts
do not explicitly situate Hochschild's thinking as a device
through which emotional reflexivity can be understood and
theorized, Hochschild provides a rich conceptual toolbox
through which this can be achieved. Moreover, she provides
a framework that resonates with Rosenberg's thinking on
emotional reflexivity.
At the heart of her work has been a focus upon how pro-
fessionals control the expression of their emotions in their
attempts to conform to cultural or emotion ideologies around
emotional responses to social phenomena and the expression
of these responses in various social contexts. She argues that
the acquisition of these emotion ideologies is achieved
through the socialization processes that characterize the dif-
ferent spheres of activity in which individuals interact.
Hochschild (1979) theorizes that within any given society,
the totalizing effect of multiple emotion ideologies is the
presence of an emotion culture at the macro level (Turner &
Stets, 2005).
Drawing upon the dramaturgical sociology of Erving
Goffman, Hochschild (1979, 1990) argues that within any
specific context, two sets of norms frame the different ideo-
logical spaces individuals inhabit. These norms are also con-
sidered to reflect the wider emotion culture of a society. The
first of these norms she labels as feeling rules, which govern
the kinds of emotions that are considered appropriate for
individuals to feel and experience in particular situations.
The second norm she refers to as display rules, which govern
the parameters for the appropriate expression or performance
of emotion in particular situations. These feeling rules are
integral to what Hochschild (1983) refers to as display rules.
Here, the display of appropriate emotion by an individual is
considered to be crucial for meaningful or successful social
interaction. The central issue in Hochschild's (1979, 1983)
thesis, therefore, is anchored in her observation that the
4 SAGE Open
management of emotion to conform to socially prescribed
norms or emotion ideologies requires work that she describes
as emotion work or emotion management.
To invoke an analytical framework for the analysis of how
individuals accomplish their feeling performances, Hochschild
(1983) presents the concepts of surface acting and deep act-
ing. In surface acting, an individual engages in the regulation
of their public expression of emotion, whereas deep acting
refers to the process whereby individuals consciously attempt
to alter internal states (feelings) to achieve the appropriate out-
ward expression of emotion.
The central focus of Hochschild's body of work has been
the management of emotion in organizational/commercial life,
and it is this locus that has given Hochschild's work its endur-
ing potency. Developed out of her ethnographic study of flight
attendants, Hochschild (1983) eloquently outlined the pro-
cesses whereby the management of emotion by flight atten-
dants was intimately connected to and determined by the
emotional ideology of the organization (airline). Here, the
management of emotion was conceptualized as a vehicle
through which airline employees invoked expressive devices
to achieve organizational goals such as customer satisfaction.
The management of emotion for organizational or com-
mercial gain was described by Hochschild (1983) as emo-
tional labor. For Hochschild, however, the process of
emotional labor is conceptualized as ultimately producing
states of alienation within employees. She proposes that the
consistent effort required by individuals to control their emo-
tions results in burnout and stress particularly where indi-
viduals experience continued emotive dissonance
(Hochschild, 1983) between their internal feeling states and
private emotion systems, and the [organizational] emotion
ideologies that dictate the performance of altered public
expressions of emotion (Hochschild, 1983).
The concept of emotional labor has enjoyed widespread
currency within discussions of emotions and research. It has
entered the reflexive narratives of qualitative researchers
seeking to theorize their experiences with emotion. Within
such accounts, the concept of emotional labor has primarily
been invoked as a conceptual device to explore the emotional
dimensions of fieldwork experiences. As a consequence, it
has become somewhat commonplace to conceptualize the
labor of qualitative researchers as emotional labor.
The central focus of much of this work is centered upon
the analysis of the emotional work that underpins encounters
with participants and in particular the extent to which
researchers are required to offer emotional performances
within these encounters. For instance, Malcolm (2012) in her
recent account of the emotional labor of the contract research
fellow researching adult learning discussed how she found
that
emotional labour was performed in the detailed activity of
co-constructing a life, of asking, listening to, and reflecting back
the emotions of the interviewee. (p. 8)
Malcolm (2012) goes on to describe how, during her
fieldwork experience, the empathy she was required to dis-
play required her to engage in a considerable level of deep
acting to perform as "good" researcher. She describes how
she had to suppress feelings of sadness and enthusiasm when
interviewing a participant and how deeply conflicted she felt
when her own ethics of care were placed in a tense and con-
tradictory relationship with the requirements of data collec-
tion and the performance this required. In doing so, Malcolm
(2012) discusses how she experienced the requirement for a
complicit emphatic performance to elicit data as emotionally
challenging.
Secondary Analysis
and Emotional Labor
Commentary of the kind Malcolm (2012) offers are com-
monplace within accounts of emotion and fieldwork in quali-
tative research, and the concept of emotional labor is widely
drawn upon to provide analytical power. Moreover, where
the concept is not invoked, similar experiential phenomena
are frequently described.
However, not only has emotion been marginalized and
neglected as a dimension of secondary analysis, but to our
knowledge, the concept of emotional labor has also not been
applied to understand the emotional work of secondary ana-
lysts. This may be because the conditions in which emotional
labor is considered to be performed appear to exclude a con-
sideration of the labor of the secondary analyst as emotional
labor. In her definition of emotional labor, Hochschild
(1983) describes emotional labor as work that
1.
Requires face-to-face or voice-to-voice contact with the
public
2.
Requires a worker to produce an emotional state in another
person
3.
Allows the employer, through training and supervision, to
exercise a degree of control over the emotional activities of
employees. (p. 147)
The first two of these three dimensions immediately situ-
ates secondary analysis as out with the analytical reach of
emotional labor for quite obvious reasons--the absence of
interpersonal encounters with research participants. In most
instances, secondary analysts interact with documents or
other nonhuman artifacts and not research participants. This
would suggest, therefore, that there is no requirement for
secondary analysts to produce emotional performances and
thus no requirement for them to invoke such devices as deep
or surface acting.
It is our contention, and it has been our experience, that
the research procedures that characterize secondary analysis
can create the conditions in which an intimate and deeply felt
Jackson et al. 5
interpersonal connectedness with participants arises. Here,
we would argue that the narrative or text as the object of
analysis should not be considered as a passive artifact. We
experienced the narratives that we analyzed as possessing an
affective agency wherein the "narrated participant" (the child
or young person) was communicated, was emergent, and was
brought into an interactional and dynamic relationship with
ourselves. In this sense, analytically and conceptually, the
narratives we worked with could be understood as mediating
devices through which the relationships between ourselves
as researchers and our participants was co-constructed. Thus,
it was through analytical interaction with each individual
narrative that we were brought into a relationship with the
child/young person the narrative (re)presented. It is through
these narratives that our participants spoke and shared with
us their most acutely felt distress and worries.
In these conditions, the management of emotion emerges
primarily as a private experience within the analytical and
interpretive task of making sense of these narratives. As
affective artifacts, these narratives act upon the secondary
analyst inducing emotional states that require private emo-
tional performances "backstage." These emotional perfor-
mances require both deep and surface acting in order that the
analyst can perform as a researcher and accomplish the ana-
lytical and interpretive tasks necessary to produce the
research outputs required through their emotional labor.
It is our argument, then, that secondary analysis of the
narratives we worked with required us to invoke an emo-
tional reflexivity. We turn now to our discussion of these pro-
cesses across the two projects to illustrate our experiences of
doing so.
Working With CLS Data
Many of the records we analyzed across the two studies
revealed details about the different forms of abuse that chil-
dren/young people were suffering at the hands of their par-
ents and others who held a duty of care toward them. The
nature of the sometimes multiple abuses they described was
overwhelming in terms of the severity of the abuse and its
frequency. The accounts given by many of these children/
young people can only be described as harrowing. The data
analysis task involved us reading record after record after
record that represented, often in the child/young person's
own words, lives that were shattered by incomprehensible
acts of cruelty, violence, and neglect. The detail given was
often graphic, containing explicit and vivid descriptions of
what children/young people were experiencing, and the often
dire circumstances in which they lived. A typical example is
given below:
Dad tries to put his hands down my trousers when mum goes to
bed. He told me not to tell anyone. He hits me, slaps me and
punches me. I have bruises on my face and two black eyes.
(Female child, 11 years)
The data that were analyzed were unique in being unme-
diated by researcher interests insofar as they represented
children/young people's self-identified concerns. Research
that has investigated the experiences of people who have
been abused is usually "survivalist" in the sense that the
abuse experienced can be viewed as historical. As such, the
data gathered usually represents the retrospective accounts
of adult survivors. The records we were analyzing were col-
lected from children/young people who were often experi-
encing abuse at the time that they placed the call to CLS.
The records tended therefore to be written in the present
tense reflecting the immediacy of the child/young person's
circumstances. The impact of this cannot be understated. In
reading these accounts, there was a sense that you were
bearing witness to the child or young person's trauma--as it
was happening. The team's emotional experiences of work-
ing with this data resonates strongly with Moran-Ellis's
(1996) reflections on reading accounts of child sexual abuse
and her observation that she felt "much pain by proxy" (p.
181).
It is extremely unusual for researchers to access the
accounts of children/young people who are currently experi-
encing abuse or who have recently experienced such abuse.
Children are not empowered to speak about such things
either in a research context or in the wider sociocultural con-
text in which they live. There are also innumerable ethical
reasons why many researchers would not pursue or would be
prevented from collecting primary data on these issues from
children and young people.
Over the course of the two projects, we analyzed thou-
sands of records. Coming to terms with the numbers of chil-
dren/young people describing abuse in their lives was
challenging. The scale of the suffering was enormously dif-
ficult to comprehend. Both research fellows were exposed to
this data for prolonged periods of time and had to work with
the data intensively to deliver the research findings within
the project time frames. The emotional impact of intensively
analyzing a substantial number of narratives of this nature
was cumulative. Elinor wrote that after reading hundreds of
accounts of sexual abuse, she felt horror, anger, and a deep
sadness that mere statistical accounting cannot convey.
Deep Acting
Managing the sadness, the horror, the anger, and the realiza-
tion that children and young people were reporting their
experiences in their thousands was incredibly difficult and
felt lonesome. While we were able to enter into a dialogue
with each other about the emotional demands of the data
analysis task during formal team meetings, for the most part,
the emotional labor we each performed was a deeply private
actively. For reasons of confidentiality, we were required to
work with the data primarily within CLS premises. We were
therefore disconnected from each other during the substan-
tive part of the data analysis task. Managing these emotions
6 SAGE Open
while working with the data in isolation required both Sharon
and Elinor to engage in an ongoing process of emotional
reflexivity. This involved us engaging in a process of deep
acting to perform the analytical task. Here, we had to actively
alter the internal emotional states we were experiencing so
we could carry out the cognitive work required for data
analysis.
Invoking altered emotional states was not an easy task
and required a considerable level of what Rosenberg (1990)
labels as "mental self-manipulation" (p. 11). On an almost
daily basis, we found ourselves attempting to try to over-
come and control difficult emotions in an effort to rid our-
selves of them or to at least mute their intensity. Sharon
recalls the enormous cognitive effort this internal work
required to regulate, control, reduce, and/or displace feelings
of immense sadness and bewilderment, and to quite often
fight back tears. Sometimes, this involved active attempts to
replace these kinds of emotions with other more pleasant
sensations. To do so often required breaking from the data
analysis task to provide temporary relief.
Attempting to alter emotional states is considered by
Rosenberg (1990) to be a clear manifestation of emotional
reflexivity. However, the act of trying to feel something dif-
ferent or to feel less can produce an ethical uneasiness. On
one hand, there is an impetus to perform the task, to be as
Malcolm (2012) states, "a good researcher" (p. 11). This
connects to concerns that the analysis may be impeded or
distorted by meanings produced in distressful conditions.
Moreover, for Sharon and Elinor who were novice research-
ers, there was a strong desire to perform as "a good
researcher" to other members of the research team.
Demonstrating analytical progress and dumbing down per-
sonal struggles is one of the ways through which this was
sometimes achieved. On the other hand, there is a personal
desire to numb unpleasant feelings as an act of self-care--
something that Dickson-Swift et al. (2008) suggest research-
ers working on sensitive topics should be proactive about.
As necessitous as self-care strategies and deep acting
might seem, there were times when Sharon considered that
in trying to feel less, she was minimizing the pain that was
being expressed by the children and young people. There
were also concerns that a failure to engage emotionally--to
empathize fully--with the voices of these children/young
people could in itself produce a distorted analysis.
This confusion over exactly how one should work on
emotion to perform the analytic task and function on a per-
sonal and professional level was salient throughout the
research process. Despite phases of intense emotional dis-
ruption, there were also periods when we felt disconnected
from the data. Far from being viewed as problematic, these
instances of disaffection brought some much-needed relief,
allowing us to "get the job done." However, at times we wor-
ried that this emotional disconnection from the data would
influence the interpretations we were reaching. We had con-
cerns that we had become inured to the pain of these
children/young people and worried about the implications of
this.
For both research fellows, their involvements in the proj-
ects represented not only their first academic research posts
but also their first experiences of working with child abuse
data. Fincham, Scourfield, and Langer (2008) in discussing
how researchers experience their first encounters with dis-
turbing secondary data highlight that unless a researcher has
previous experience in working with similar kinds of data,
their response to being exposed to such data may be similar
to that of a lay person. That is, the emotional impact can be
profound. Drawing on the commentary of Cohen (2001),
they argue that while researchers may have been exposed to
the particular topic of analysis (in their study suicide and in
ours child abuse) on an almost daily basis through, for
example, media images, we cultivate a denial of the human
suffering involved. In the case of suicide, for instance, they
argue,
We might observe that there are particular social processes
associated with the routine denial of mental or emotional
suffering that is in our midst. We are not thinking here of far-
away trauma such as famine and war, but personal suffering that
is in a sense near at hand. (Fincham et al., 2010, p. 860)
None of us were unaware that child abuse represents a
serious social problem for children/young people. However,
and as we found, there is a vast difference between a social
awareness of these issues and having to confront the abuse of
children/young people through being exposed to their trauma
in the ways that we were.
Embodied Experiences
Sharon and Elinor both experienced challenging visual and
auditory sensations. They found that at the time of reading
the accounts and latterly reflecting upon them, there was an
alternation between imagining or picturing the events
described in the narrative and hearing the voices of children/
young people. It is incredibly difficult to describe or explain
these sensations in the written word. The visual sensations
were akin to commonly experienced ways in which we con-
jure up imagery when reading a book. In many ways, there-
fore, we were "imagining the text." In reading the accounts,
Sharon and Elinor found themselves "seeing" the abuse hap-
pening. For Elinor, these visual disturbances were so pro-
foundly invasive and distressing that it had a temporary
impact upon her capacity to continue with data analysis--
She described this as "hitting the wall."
The auditory sensations were experienced as hearing the
voices of children/young people narrating their experiences.
Although we never directly heard the voices of the children/
young people whose accounts we read, we felt as if we heard
them speak to us through these auditory experiences. We
ascribed each of them with a unique voice. Where these
Jackson et al. 7
voices came from we do not know. For Sharon, these voices
can still be heard. She can still hear children/young people
"talking." There are certain narratives that remain embedded
within memory that can be accessed or played back, or which
invade the consciousness whenever this research is remem-
bered. There is one voice in particular that has never left--
the words of a young girl contained in a record that detailed
her sexual abuse and that ended with the capturing of these
words:
Where can I go, who can help me?
Sharon recalls that when she read these words, she was
left feeling utterly impotent, and it is our experience that
engaging with this kind of research never leaves you--The
stories of the participants remain and the emotional impact of
witnessing their trauma leaves its traces.
Embodied experiences such as these are identified by
Rosenberg (1990) as being central in relation to the phe-
nomena of emotional identification. Emotional reflexivity,
he proposes, requires an active interpretation of identified
signifiers, and the regulation of such embodied states
requires emotion work. When people experience such states
of emotional arousal without engagement in interpretive
process, these are considered to be nonreflexive states. We
found that we actively attempted to regulate these emo-
tional states through a process of emotional labor, and
through the strategies of deep and surface acting to induce
preferred states.
Being Disempowered
Feelings of "impotency" were a marked feature of the analy-
sis stage. This perhaps signifies where secondary analysis of
this kind differs from research that involves direct communi-
cation with participants. Often, in reading children/young
people's accounts, we were left with a sense of utter power-
lessness. We felt that there was nothing we could do to help
or make a difference to these children/young people's lives.
We were party to their disclosures and their acts of help-
seeking, yet we could not act, and we could not help. We
were not as CLS counselors were or indeed as any other
"trauma worker" who encounters children/young people in
difficulty in a position to act. Working with this kind of data
strips you of agency. It positions you as helpless.
As an adult, your primary moral response to a child/young
person (or any other person in distress) drives you to act. The
impotency Sharon felt in relation to her inability to act--to
either offer comfort or counsel (as CLS counselors were able
to do) resulted in her experiencing a very acute emotive dis-
sonance between her personal moral and ethical ideology,
and the professional demands upon her to engage in the ana-
lytical and interpretive task of a qualitative researcher. The
ability to "sit with" these tensions required considerable
resolve. At the same time, she felt angry about her perception
that society had failed these children/young people and pow-
erless in her ability to do anything about it.
Dissemination and Surface Acting
Throughout the analysis stage, we had to engage in deep act-
ing to manage our emotional states. However, the dissemina-
tion phase required us to invoke surface acting as a strategy
to reduce the expression of difficult emotions during public
events. However, for Sharon speaking publicly about the
experiences of these children/young people required her to
manage her personal emotional states in front of an audience
"on stage." Both projects had a planned dissemination phase
that aimed to bring the voices of these children/young people
to policy makers, practitioners, and others we identified as
important stakeholders in the lives of children/young people
who experience such difficulties. In the first project, we held
a media launch of the key findings to invited persons from
relevant agencies, governmental departments, and members
of the print and television media.
At such events, professional competence is under intense
public scrutiny, and one wishes to perform well. We all to a
greater or lesser extent had experience of presenting research
findings to various audiences; however, neither Sharon nor
Elinor had previously presented research findings that spoke
to the abuse experiences of children/young people. Presenting
the findings was not considered problematic to the team.
Previous presentations had taken place with a select audience
of policy makers and had passed unremarkably as these
things often do. However, in this instance, Sharon found it
extremely difficult to control visible signs of emotional dis-
tress and regulate her emotional display when she was (re)
presenting the experiences of these children/young people
The findings are hard hitting and harrowing when orally
presented. We have noted how the presentation of the data
from both projects affects audiences--It perhaps disrupts
their own routine denial. When the presenter speaks, the real-
ity of these children/young people's lives arouses a stunned
and somber silence that leaves the air heavy. It is almost
impossible to be unmoved by what is heard. The presentation
for this media launch required Sharon to read aloud the fol-
lowing extract from a young boy's account of the abuse he
was suffering and what was happening in his family life:
Always hitting him, when gets in dad usually drunk. Also takes
drugs--hash, acid, ecstasy. Has bruises often. Also battering
mum. Mum told him not to tell social worker about what's
happening. He would like to move out or run away. It's been
happening for months. Mum told him not to tell anyone out of
the family. (Male child, 14 years)
The research fellow struggled to read this extract without
breaking down in tears. In this instance, Sharon was unable
to "work on" her emotional expressional--Her attempt to
engage in surface acting failed, and she worried that her
8 SAGE Open
professional performance had exposed her as incompetent in
this academic task. She has never read an extract out loud
again. She is unable to, preferring instead to invite the audi-
ence to take a moment to read the extract presented. Each
time it is encountered, it is experienced as distressing. Sharon
has reflected upon the reasons she cannot read this or any
other extract aloud without emotional display but is unable to
provide an explanation. Perhaps it is because the act of
speaking on behalf of these children/young people--giving
voice to their distresses--transforms these narratives from
text to reality. Perhaps it is because the individual narrative
of each child is a representation of the pain of thousands of
others. We did, however, feel that dissemination gave us
back an effective agency. It allowed us to feel that in some
small way, we were able to render visible the struggles of
these children/young people and make a difference.
The Importance of Emotional Support
It is important, however, to recognize that a significant part
of our task also allowed us to access some of the most inspir-
ing and humbling examples of human resilience, courage,
and compassion that we have had the privilege to bear wit-
ness too. Many of the children/young people's accounts we
read contained rich detail on the strategies they used to get by
in difficult circumstances, of the actions they took to help or
protect parents, siblings, friends, and other significant per-
sons in their lives. It also revealed to us the depth of their
own emphatic understanding of the difficulties that even
abusive parents faced in their daily lives.
Much of what we encountered here challenges percep-
tions of children/young people as lacking in agency or as
entirely helpless in the face of adversity. That is not to dis-
miss the very real difficulties that many of these children/
young people faced nor is there any intention here to suggest
that any of these children/young people were not in need of
adequate levels of care and protection--Rather, it is a testa-
ment to the strength of character that many of these children/
young people appeared to have.
Support from others--particularly supervisors--is con-
sidered to be extremely important in militating against the
negative effects of witnessing the trauma of others (Conrad
& Keller-Guenther, 2006). Here, there is considerable
research to support the hypothesis that individuals are less
susceptible to both the shorter and longer term consequences
of exposure to trauma if they have an adequate opportunity
to discharge the emotional distresses they experience
(DePanfilis, 2006). In academia, support structures for
researchers who work on emotive topics and who encounter
emotional challenges in the course of their professional work
are all but absent despite the efforts of others who have high-
lighted this as an area of concern (see, for example, Dickson-
Swift et al., 2008). There is however little recognition that
secondary analysts can also be emotionally affected by the
work they undertake, and we would suggest that a dialogue
on these issues is overdue. Sharon and Elinor were privi-
leged in being able to access support when working with the
data within CLS premises through the mechanism of formal
debriefing sessions available to all CLS staff, and we were
also able, as a team, to disclose and discuss the nature of this
data, and our experiences with it among ourselves. Many
researchers are perhaps unable to do so.
It is also important to recognize that children's emotional
distress can also be considerably alleviated where there is a
receptive context (Focht-Birketts & Beardslee, 2000). To
some extent, each child presented to us in the narratives we
analyzed had found a receptive context--ChildLine. We are
in little doubt that the service has made a considerable con-
tribution to the lives of hundreds of thousands of children
who otherwise would have had no one to share their own
emotional burdens with. Moreover, when we experienced
such phenomena as emotive dissonance and we felt impotent
to act, we were able to remind ourselves that these children/
young people had sought and received help. This assisted us
in moving forward with our task and muting the distance
between the emotions we encountered and our professional
objectives.
Emotional Reflexivity
and (Re)presentation
Thus far, we have considered the kinds of ways in which
emotions entered the research process and the strategies that
we used to manage our emotional states at different stages in
the process. In doing so, we have commented on our con-
cerns that various emotion states may have led to a distorted
analysis. However, while our reflexive dialogue has commu-
nicated an acknowledgment and understanding that emotions
affect researchers and require management, our analysis of
how emotions affect the products of research requires further
consideration.
Reflexivity is routinely used in qualitative accounts to
address questions of representation--that is, to illuminate
upon the ways in which the subjective elements of the
researcher are implicated in the process of knowledge pro-
duction and the representations of the participant worlds our
analytical endeavors create. For the most part, accounts that
attend to this rarely move beyond acknowledgment. Hence,
the concept of reflexivity that is invoked is necessarily
impoverished and rarely extends beyond considerations of
the co-construction of data in participant­researcher inter-
changes. Much less attention is given to the examination of
reflexivity as it appertains to the interpretive process of (re)
presentation that characterizes data analysis, and here, the
ways in which reflexivity is operationalized--how it is prac-
ticed--appear elusive (Mauthner & Doucet, 2003; Pillow,
2010). Therefore, while we may acknowledge emotional
contaminants, and speak to and describe their identification
through reflexive interpretive processes, and the manage-
ment of these emotions during analytical processes, we are
Jackson et al. 9
much less likely to extend our treatment of reflexivity to con-
sider how emotions act upon the analysis of our data and the
creative enterprise of representation. Failure to attend to this
reduces emotional reflexivity to a dimension of emotional
labor--that is, as a vehicle through which emotions are
interpreted, isolated, and dealt with through management
strategies. At the very best, this places limits on reflexivity as
something peculiar and separate from data analysis and, at
worst, suggests that once worked on through emotional
labor, they are somehow "hoovered out." Moreover, there is
a danger in this version of emotional reflexivity that research-
ers can somehow "free" data from emotion.
This brings to the forefront the question of how emotional
reflexivity in data analysis is practiced and incorporated into
analytical procedures, and how it may come to shape (re)
presentation. Here, there is little to guide the researcher on
how emotional reflexivity (or any other version of reflexiv-
ity) is carried out that goes beyond acknowledging the (emo-
tional) context in which knowledge is produced through
analysis. A notable exception to this is to be found in
Mauthner and Doucet's (2003) account of reflexivity in qual-
itative data analysis. Here, they describe a method of data
analysis that they consider facilitates the operationalization
of reflexivity during data analysis that draws upon Brown
and Gilligan's (1992) "voice-centred relational method of
data analysis." This method of data analysis is grounded in
feminist methodology. Based on the work of Gilligan (1982),
this approach to analysis facilities the acknowledgment and
analysis of both the participant's story and the researcher's
role in relation to the interpretation of that story. This recog-
nizes that (re)presentations of participant worlds are co-con-
structed during data analysis and brings into the analysis the
voice of both participant and the researcher bringing to the
fore the relational positioning of the researcher to the text
(Paliadelis & Cruickshank, 2008).
This method requires three separate but related readings
of the text. The first involves "reader response," wherein the
analyst "reads for himself/herself" in the text identifying his
or her positionalities in relation to it. This requires a reflexive
analytical consideration of how he or she is responding emo-
tionally and academically to the text and how he or she is
interpreting the data in light of this. This reflexive analysis
requires the researchers to isolate how their personal biogra-
phies, social and cultural assumptions, academic knowledge,
and emotional responses as sources of knowledge connect
with their interpretation of the data at the time that analysis is
performed. This is considered to reveal the act of interpreta-
tion as multilayered and informed by these different and
interacting sets of knowledge.
The second reading of the text is focused upon the partici-
pant narrative. It places as central the voices of participants,
their thoughts and feelings, their perceptions of themselves,
and their life worlds. This cycle of analysis is focused on
allowing the participant to speak "before we the researchers
speak of them" (Paliadelis & Cruickshank, 2008, p. 1449).
The third reading of the text focuses on the relationships of
participants, and the fourth on the contexts surrounding their
relationships (Brown & Gilligan, 1992). These third and
fourth readings provide the researcher with understanding
how participants locate themselves in relation to others and
the wider sociocultural contexts of their lives (Paliadelis &
Cruickshank, 1998).
In adopting this method of analysis, the role of the
research is rendered more explicit as their values, beliefs,
and emotions are situated as a central part of the analytical
process and are reflexively considered in relation to the other
three interpretive readings of the text (Brown & Gilligan,
1992; Hewitt, 2007; Mauthner & Doucet, 1998). This
approach to data analysis has been successfully used in a
number of studies to operationalize reflexivity during the
analysis cycle (see, for example, Mauthner, 2002; Mauthner
& Doucet, 2003).
In our studies, we did not use a structured method of anal-
ysis such as the voice-centered relation method; however, the
processes we went through in invoking emotional reflexivity
in our analytical endeavors resonates strongly with the pro-
cesses involved in the first cycle of the method. Our first
readings of the narratives of children/young people were
very much centered on our emotional reactions to the texts.
The voices of the children/young people were latterly heard.
We were able to consider during the process of analysis how
our emotions and biographies as both women and academics
were inextricably woven into the fabric of our interpretations
and how in light of our internal and shared reflexive dia-
logues around this, our interpretations could shift and change.
A very good example of this was our exploration around
perpetrators of abuse. In our study, the vast majority of per-
petrators were identified as known to the child, and many of
these were parents. Our horror at the level of abuse being
reported and our abhorrence in relation to the extent of intra-
familial abuse clouded how we considered parents in relation
to this. As a parent, Sharon struggled in comprehending the
level of parent perpetrated physical and sexual abuse. As a
parent herself, understanding how a parent could harm his or
her child in such ways restricted the extent to which she
could conceptualize the circumstances that can predispose
parents to abuse. In particular, as a mother, female-perpe-
trated abuse was experienced as particularly problematic to
grasp. Through reflexive analysis, Sharon was able to iden-
tify that her interpretations of the data related to sexual abuse
perpetrators was limited, first, by her absorption of a cultural
discourse around the "perpetrator as stranger"; second, by a
cultural discourse that portrays a stereotype of perpetrators
of sexual abuse as sadistic pedophiles; and third, by a con-
ceptualization of motherhood that emphasizes gendered
norms of care and romanticizes motherhood and femininity.
Hence, her sensibilities around whom sexual abuse perpetra-
tors are were considerably disrupted, and her interpretive
abilities to analyze the context in which abuse may occur
were constrained.
10 SAGE Open
The research questions and our ontological positioning of
children also obscured our analytical gaze in relation to per-
petrators. In the first instance, our analytical focus guided by
the research questions was to understand how children/
young people's perspectives and how the adversities they
experienced affected their lives. Thus, we were attempting to
place their voices as central. In doing so, we were focused on
their struggles and therefore narratives of the "self." Our
gaze therefore was not initially extended to a consideration
of perpetrator struggles. In exploring the assumptions that
underpinned her reactions to the data around perpetrators,
Sharon was able to shift her perspective from one that ini-
tially predisposed her to considering perpetrators as abomi-
nable beings and dislocate their being from their acts of
abuse to reconsider how parents become perpetrators and
more thoroughly examine the contexts in which abuse arises.
Within the context of both projects, this shift emerged as
being vitally important in revealing that most parental perpe-
trators did not fit the stereotype of the sadistic abuse or the
pedophile "out there," but resituated many of them as per-
sons whose capacity to love and care for their children had
been diminished through circumstances of adversity that
grew a context for abuse to occur. Sharon found that the nar-
ratives of children/young people provided rich, detailed, and
often empathetic insights into parental troubles. Contained
within these were accounts of once loving parents whom in a
context of adversity had lost their capacity to act toward their
children in loving and responsive ways. For instance, it
emerged that parent's struggling with grief, divorce, depres-
sion, relationship problems, and other health and well-being
issues were often set on a trajectory that ultimately led to
abuse. In many instances, such as grief or divorce, this had
led to depression sometimes in combination with increasing
reliance on alcohol, and this domino effect rendered the child
vulnerable as a consequence of diminished parental capacity.
Inappropriate sexual relations with children revealed them-
selves to occur in some instances in the context of comfort
seeking from a child that led to the development of an unac-
ceptable level of intimacy with the child and ultimately a
sexually abusive relationship dynamic.
While such interpretive insights did not lead Sharon to
view abusive acts as less reprehensible, they did allow for the
development of an analysis of the context in which abuse
occurs that raised the need for parental support at times of
parental vulnerability. Moreover, it brought to the surface
that children/young people themselves had the cognitive and
emotional capacity to enter into a critical reflection of their
parents' struggles in their attempts to construct a coherent
narrative of how they came to be abused.
This example illustrates how engagement in (emotional)
reflexivity during data analysis can profoundly shift our inter-
pretive endeavors and, as a consequence, our (re)presenta-
tions. Whether this results in a "better" analysis is perhaps
more difficult to identify.At best, we suggest that it can lead to
a more informed, nuanced, and often different analysis than
that which might occur if emotion and other sources of knowl-
edge are not reflexively engaged. Either way, it reveals that
analysis is messy and that findings can be "thoroughly con-
taminated" through the interweaving of the researcher with the
knowledge that is produced (Ellingson, 1998, p. 494).
Reflexive Writing, Ethics,
Emotion, and Secondary Analysis
The research process that characterized both of the studies
discussed in this article required the research team to bear
witness to some of the worst elements of human destructive-
ness. It is unsurprising, therefore, that we were emotionally
affected by our engagement with the data. Yet, we remain
perplexed by the absence of academic engagement on the
emotional impact of working with secondary data sources of
this kind and the lack of published experiential accounts
from researchers that describe and analyze how they manage
challenging emotions during the research process. Presently,
the restrictive focus upon the analysis of emotional phenom-
ena that emerge during the collection of primary research
data with participants in fieldwork settings denies the com-
plex ways in which emotions enter the research process dur-
ing secondary analysis. Secondary analysts who work with
distressing data can be emotionally affected by such data in
many of the same ways as fieldworkers, and are similarly
required to engage in an active emotional reflexivity and the
invocation of emotion management strategies to maintain
emotional equilibrium during the research process.
It has been our argument throughout this article--and one
that we hope we have illustrated--that secondary analysis
has its own emotional demands. These emotional demands
are, however, not restricted to those who engage in research
that explores child abuse and other forms of distress chil-
dren/young people encounter. This much has been well doc-
umented elsewhere (see, for example, Dickson-Swift, James,
Kippen, & Liamputtong, 2007). There are many accounts of
researcher emotion in other areas of sensitive research where
either the topic of investigation or dynamics experienced in
the field are encountered as emotionally challenging or dis-
tressing. Consequently, the issues raised within this article
have wider currency that extends quite considerably beyond
the context of the projects we have explored.
Such a consideration, therefore, brings to the fore how
researcher distress is addressed in the ethical processes that
underpin research studies. While we were able to access sup-
port through each other and through formal debriefing ses-
sions, many researchers may not benefit from informal or
formal support structures that buttress the emotional impact
of working with distress. This inevitably positions research-
ers as vulnerable. Yet, there is little consideration of this in
ethical procedures that tend to be focused on ensuring that
harm to participants does not occur or that appropriate proto-
cols are developed for participants who experience emo-
tional distress as a consequence of their involvement in our
Jackson et al. 11
studies. Many academics have raised concerns about this and
have highlighted the role that ethics committees could per-
form in extending ethical considerations around risk and
harm to researchers where there is a likelihood that research
may result in risk and/or harm (Dickson-Swift et al., 2007).
We would concur with such observations, and suggest that
such issues are formally integrated into the ethical underpin-
nings of studies and that mechanisms are put in place to
monitor the well-being of researchers, to facilitate supportive
spaces within research teams and institutions, and to ensure
that where needed, formal support can be provided and/or
accessed.
The writing of this account necessarily leaves one with a
sense of vulnerability insofar that the construction of this
account has involved "personal exposures" of the kind that
we are ill at ease with professionally. Reflexive writing of
this kind is unfamiliar territory for academics used to the
conventions of academic writing that tend to prescribe the
rendering of "objective" accounts somewhat divorced from
issues of the self that can be comfortably glossed over,
diluted, or more often dismissed. The dominant ideology of
academia that privileges rationality and objectivity requires
us to "extract out" emotion (Author, 2001, p. 135). There is a
sense, therefore, that in speaking about these issues, one is
revealing something deeply personal about the self for a pub-
lic audience. Poignantly, it reminds us that the children/
young people who called ChildLine and whose accounts we
worked with each went through the process of disclosing the
profoundly personal to others. It allows us to recognize to
some extent the courage it took them to do so.
