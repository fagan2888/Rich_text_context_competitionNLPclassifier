Among US Youth
Tonja R. Nansel, PhD; Mary D. Overpeck, DrPH; Denise L. Haynie, PhD; W. June Ruan, MA; Peter C. Scheidt, MD, MPH
Objective: To determine the extent to which bullying
and being bullied, both in and away from school, is
associated with involvement in violent behavior.
Design, Setting, and Participants: A US represen-
tative cross-sectional sample of 15686 students in grades
6 through 10 in public and private schools completed the
World Health Organization's Health Behaviour in School-
aged Children survey in 1998.
Main Outcome Measures: Self-report of weapon car-
rying, weapon carrying in school, physical fighting, and
being injured in a physical fight.
Results: Involvement in each of the violence-related
behaviors ranged from 13% to 23% of boys and 4% to
11% of girls. Bullying others and being bullied were con-
sistently related to each violence-related behavior for both
boys and girls. Greater odds of involvement occurred with
bullying others than being bullied, and greater odds of
involvement occurred with bullying that took place away
from school than that occurring in school. For example,
the adjusted odds ratio for weapon carrying associated
with being bullied in school weekly was 1.5, for bully-
ing others in school 2.6, for being bullied away from school
4.1, and for bullying others away from school 5.9.
Conclusion: Bullying should not be considered a nor-
mative aspect of youth development, but rather a marker
for more serious violent behaviors, including weapon car-
rying, frequent fighting, and fighting-related injury.

VIOLENCE AMONG US youth
is of national concern.
While encouraging de-
clines in violent crimes
have been observed over
the last decade, rates of aggravated as-
sault and self-reports of nonlethal
violence remain high.1
The US government and national or-
ganizations, such as the American Medi-
cal Association, have recently sponsored
research and programmatic efforts to-
ward violence prevention.1,2-5 Successful
policies and programs to reduce violence
may need to target an overall reduction in
aggressive behavior. One form of aggres-
sion that merits concern is bullying. Al-
most 30% of youth grades 6 through 10
report being involved in bullying--as
bully, target, or both.6 By definition, an act
of bullying involves an intention-to-
harm and a power differential between the
bully and target. This power differential
separates bullying from reciprocal aggres-
sive acts.7 The abusive nature of bully-
ing, indicating a lack of regard for others,
may be an important risk factor for the per-
petration of more serious violent behav-
ior. Little research has addressed this is-
sue. Youth who bullied were found in one
study to be more likely to bring weapons
to school,8 and in a study of incarcerated
persons, to be more likely to be current
or former gang members.9 Being bullied
by others or being perceived as vulner-
able has been found to be associated with
weapon carrying and violent behav-
ior.10-15 For example, in an investigation
of school-associated violent deaths,16 re-
searchers found that homicide perpetra-
tors were more than twice as likely as ho-
micide victims to have been bullied by
peers.
Prevalence estimates from the 1999
Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance sur-
vey17 indicate that 28.6% of male sub-
jects grades 9 through 12 and 6.0% of fe-
male subjects grades 9 through 12 reported
carrying a weapon in the past 30 days. In
addition, 44.0% of male subjects and 27.3%
of female subjects had been in 1 or more
physical fight in the past year, and 5.3%
of male subjects and 2.8% of female sub-
jects had been injured in a physical fight

in the past year. While some fighting among adolescent
youth is normative, frequent fighting is associated with
more adverse outcomes,18-21 and injury from a fight may
represent fighting to a more violent degree. Weapon car-
rying is particularly concerning, as it may indicate a will-
ingness or intention-to-harm another or a fear for one's
own safety.
This study determined the extent to which bully-
ing and being bullied are associated with violence-
related behavior. The following 4 violence-related be-
haviors were selected for inclusion in this study: weapon
carrying, weapon carrying at school, frequent fighting,
and being injured in a fight. These behaviors are be-
lieved to be important indicators of violence because of
their potential for physical harm.
METHODS
STUDY POPULATION
The National Institute of Child Health and Human Develop-
ment supported a nationally representative survey of youth in
grades 6 through 10 in US schools during the spring of 1998.
The survey, titled Health Behaviour of School-aged Children
(HBSC), was part of a collaborative, cross-national research
project involving 30 countries in coordination with the World
Health Organization.22 This analysis uses the US sample only.
The HBSC protocol required that countries ask identical ques-
tions with the same response options based on measures that
had been validated in prior research protocols, pretests, or both
in multiple countries. The United States added questions such
as race or ethnicity, as required for federal surveys, or to ex-
pand on required topical questions, such as bullying. Most ques-
tions provided precoded response options with some limited
written descriptions that were later coded according to HBSC
protocols. Survey instruments were anonymous self-admin-
istered questionnaires completed by students during 1 class pe-
riod. The US survey was approved by the National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development institutional review
board and was carried out by Macro International Inc, Calver-
ton, Md. Active parental and student consent was solicited.
The sampling universe consisted of a comprehensive list
of US public, catholic, and other private school students in grades
6 through 10 or their equivalent, excluding schools with en-
rollment of fewer than 14 students. Primary sampling units were
determined to produce nationally representative estimates for
each grade, with schools selected according to predetermined
school size requirements. Classes were then selected, using
simple random sampling, from a suitable frame of classes that
represented the target grade in a selected school. All students
in a selected class were asked to participate in the study. Be-
cause of documented hesitance of schools to participate in sur-
veys taking student class time, expected rejections to requests
for participation, and sampling requirements that no replace-
ment schools be used for those rejecting participation, far more
schools were drawn into the sampling frame than needed to
obtain the precision required for a nationally representative
weighted sample to produce 95% confidence estimates of plus
or minus 3% for students at each grade. Schools with minority
students were oversampled to provide reliable estimates for
African Americans and Hispanics, with weighting adjusted to
national estimates of the US school enrollment.
Seventeen thousand students responded, resulting in a par-
ticipation rate of 83% of enrolled students. If records were miss-
ing for key variables (eg, age or sex) or had more than 75% of
question responses missing, the records were excluded accord-
ing to HBSC protocol requirements (n=835). The school-
based sample design, using 1 class period for completion of
the questionnaire, precluded the ability to compare respon-
dent characteristics with nonparticipants. Responding stu-
dents in sampled classes were excluded if they were out of the
target range for grade or their age was outside of the 99th per-
centile for grade (n=440 students), or if either grade or age
were unknown (n=39 students) and national weights ad-
justed accordingly. The resulting analytic sample was 15686
students in grades 6 through 10.
MEASURES
Measures for this study were obtained from the HBSC self-
report questionnaire containing 102 questions about health be-
havior, demographics, and other relevant variables. Items were
based on both theoretical hypotheses related to the social con-
text of adolescents and measurements that had been validated
in other studies or previous World Health Organization HBSC
surveys.22 All measures were pretested.
Bullying
Questions about bullying were preceded with the following ex-
planation.7,23
Here are some questions about bullying. We say a student is
BEING BULLIED when another student, or a group of stu-
dents, say or do nasty and unpleasant things to him or her. It
is also bullying when a student is teased repeatedly in a way
he or she doesn't like. But it is NOT BULLYING when 2 stu-
dents of about the same strength quarrel or fight.22(p9)
Participation in bullying was assessed by 2 parallel
questions that asked respondents to report the fre-
quency with which they have bullied others in school and
away from school during the current term. Similarly, being
bullied was assessed by 2 parallel questions asking re-
spondents to report the frequency with which they have
been bullied in school and away from school during the
current term. Response categories were "I haven't . . . ,"
"once or twice," "sometimes," "about once a week," and
"several times a week." After examining the response dis-
tribution, subjects reporting once a week and those re-
porting several times a week were collapsed into 1 cat-
egory representing once a week or more.
Weapon Carrying
Participants were asked on how many days they had carried a
weapon, such as a gun, knife, or club, for self-defense in the
last 30 days. They also reported how many days they had car-
ried a weapon for self-defense on school property in the last
30 days. Responses for each item were dichotomized to indi-
cate no weapon carrying vs having carried a weapon in the last
30 days.
Frequent Fighting
Participants were asked to report the number of physical fights
they had been involved in during the past year. A cutoff point
of 4 or more fights was defined as frequent fighting.
Fighting Injuries
Participants were also asked to report the frequency with which
they were injured in a physical fight and had to be treated by a

physician or nurse in the past year. Responses were dichoto-
mized to indicate no injury from fighting vs 1 or more injuries
from fighting in the past year.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Statistical sample weights were developed to adjust for the mi-
nority oversampling and to obtain student totals by grade com-
parable to population grade estimates from the US National Cen-
ter for Education Statistics. Weighted data analyses were
conducted using SUDAAN software to adjust variance esti-
mates to account for the sample design and clustering.24
Descriptive analyses were conducted to obtain the per-
cent distributions by sex for each violence-related behavior (ie,
weapon carrying, weapon carrying at school, frequent fight-
ing, and being injured in a fight) by involvement in bullying
behaviors. Logistic regression analyses were used to estimate
odds ratios for each violence-related behavior. Separate mod-
els were run for each bullying behavior with sex. However, the
same students may be involved in more than 1 of 4 bullying
behaviors assessed--for example, bullying others both in and
away from school, or being both a bully and a target. To assess
the independent effect of each type of bullying behavior as well
as the additive effect of involvement in multiple bullying be-
haviors, multivariate logistic regressions were run with the 4
bullying measures and sex as independent variables.
RESULTS
As given in Table 1, involvement in each of the violence-
related behaviors was more common in boys than in girls,
ranging from 13% to 23% of boys and 4% to 11% of girls.
These numbers provide national prevalence estimates of
more than 2.7 million students who have carried a weapon
in the last 30 days; more than 1.8 million students who
have carried a weapon to school in the last 30 days; more
than 1.7 million students who have been in 4 or more
physical fights in the past year; and more than 2.9 mil-
lion students who have been injured in a physical fight
in the past year. Being bullied in school was reported by
significantly more students then being bullied away from
school. Being bullied in school either sometimes or weekly
was reported by 16% of boys and 11% of girls, while being
bullied away from school to this degree was reported by
9% of boys and 5% of girls. Bullying others in school was
reported by significantly more students than bullying oth-
ers away from school. Moderate (sometimes) or fre-
quent (weekly) bullying of others in school was re-
ported by 23% of boys and 11% of girls, and away from
school by 14% of boys and 7% of girls.
Bullying or being bullied, whether in or away from
school, was consistently related to each of the 4
violence-related behaviors (Table 2). The highest risk
for weapon carrying was associated with bullying others
in or away from school and being bullied away from
school, with about 70% of boys and 30% to 40% of girls
involved in bullying away from school weekly reporting
carrying a weapon in the past month. About 50% of
boys and 30% of girls who had bullied others in school
weekly reported weapon carrying compared with 36%
of boys and 15% of girls who had been bullied in school
weekly. Sex differences were observed for the fighting
indicators. For boys, frequent fighting and being injured
in a fight were most strongly associated with bullying
others (both in and away from school) and being bullied
away from school; for girls, they were most strongly
associated with bullying others (both in school and
away from school).
Results from the logistic regression analyses indi-
cate consistent patterns of results across the violence-
related behaviors (Table 3). Involvement in bullying,
both for bullies and targets, was associated with greater
odds of weapon carrying, fighting, and injury from fight-
ing. These relationships were strongest for weapon car-
rying but were notable for fighting and fighting injuries
as well. Weapon carrying and injury from a fight were
most strongly associated with involvement in bullying
that occurred away from school, whether as bully or tar-
get. Bullying others, regardless of location, was most as-
sociated with frequent fighting. In the multivariate
model, the relationships between bullying behaviors and
violence-related behaviors remained consistent, al-
though the magnitude of the odds ratios decreased ow-
ing to correlation among bullying behaviors. By multi-
plying the odds ratios for given behaviors, it is possible to
determine the association of each violence-related be-
havior with multiple bullying behaviors.25 For example,
youth who are bullied both in and away from school
sometimes would have 2.7 times greater odds of carrying
a weapon while youth who are bullied sometimes in and
away from school and who also bully others away from
school weekly would have 15.9 times greater odds of car-
rying a weapon.

COMMENT
In this study, a strong and consistent relationship be-
tween bullying and involvement in violent behaviors was
observed. This suggests that bullying is likely to occur
concurrently with more serious aggressive behavior, and
while prevalent, should not be considered a normative
aspect of youth development.
Several highly publicized incidents in which youth
who were bullied later committed violent acts have raised
the question as to what extent being bullied is associ-
ated with violent behavior. Findings from this study in-
dicate that there are consistent relations between bully-
ing and violent behavior. However, the association is
strongest not for the targets for bullying, but rather for
the bullies themselves. In addition, the magnitude of the
association is related to the context in which the bully-
ing occurs, with stronger associations for bullying that
occurs away from school. Bullying that occurs away from
school, where there is less adult supervision and less pro-
tection for youth, may be more likely to escalate into more
severe violent behavior. This pattern was also observed
for weapon carrying that occurred in school. That is, bul-
lying that occurred away from school was more highly
associated with weapon carrying in school than bully-
ing that occurred in school. As such, efforts to reduce
violence in the school may need to address aggression
and violence in the youth's larger community context.
Findings from this study suggest that programs de-
signed to reduce violent behaviors should address less
severe forms of aggressive behavior, particularly bully-
ing. Bullying, as a behavior that is by definition inflicted
with the desire to harm another, seems to be an impor-
tant marker for violence-related behaviors. Moreover, vio-

lence prevention programs should not only focus on spe-
cific aggressive behaviors but also on fostering positive
and health-promoting family and school environ-
ments.23,26 Finally, considering the relationship of bul-
lying that occurs away from school to in-school vio-
lence, programs should address the problems of safety
in the larger community context.
Several limitations of the study should be noted.
The HBSC is a broadly focused survey regarding the
health behaviors of middle and high schoolÂ­aged
youth. As such, more in-depth information on bullying
or violent behaviors is unavailable. Data are cross-sec-
tional, and so findings can only provide information
about associations among variables rather than indicat-
ing causal pathways. Another limitation of this study is
the reliance on self-report for measurement of bullying
and violent behaviors. However, self-report is a com-
mon and accepted method of measuring these behav-
iors, and estimates of the prevalence of violent behav-
iors, such as weapon carrying, are similar to that
obtained in other national surveys.17 Other sources for
national estimates of bullying behavior are unavailable
for comparison. Understanding that individual's per-
ceptions of bullying may vary, students were provided
with a detailed definition of bullying along with ex-
amples. Finally, as is typical of school-based self-report
measures (eg, Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance sur-
vey17 or Monitoring the Future27), only those students
in attendance at school in mainstream classes were
measured, and because students may choose not to an-

swer individual questions, findings may be affected by
nonresponse bias.
This study provides an important addition to the cur-
rent body of literature on violence among youth. To date,
we are unaware of another study specifically addressing
the relationship of bullying to violence-related behav-
iors. Results from this study indicate that both bullying
and being bullied are associated with higher rates of
weapon carrying, fighting, and fighting injuries. Based
on estimates from this study, approximately 2.7 million
students have carried a weapon in the last 30 days, with
more than 1.8 million carrying a weapon to school. More
than 1.7 million students are frequent fighters, and more
than 2.9 million have been injured in a fight in the past
year. Most youth are concurrently involved in moderate
or frequent bullying, as bully and/or target, and the rates
of violence consistently increase with increased fre-
quency of bullying. These findings provide a basis for fu-
ture research and violence prevention efforts.

What This Study Adds
Violence among youth is of national concern. Bullying
is known to be a common behavior among school-aged
youth and is associated with poorer psychosocial adjust-
ment. However, it is not known to what extent bullying
and being bullied is associated with violence-related be-
haviors. This study provides evidence that bullying is as-
sociated with key violence-related behaviors including
weapon carrying and fighting injuries. These associa-
tions were stronger for bullies than targets, and stron-
ger for bullying that occurred away from school. Bully-
ing should be considered an important marker for
violence-related behaviors.
