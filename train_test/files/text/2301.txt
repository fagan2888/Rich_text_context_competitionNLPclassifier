Abstract
Children of depressed mothers have impaired cognitive, behavioral, and health outcomes from infancy through adulthood,
and are especially at risk when maternal depression persists over multiple years. But there are several important limitations
to our current descriptive knowledge about maternal depression, especially depression among unmarried mothers. Data
from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a recent cohort of children born in urban areas to mostly unmarried
parents (N = 4,366), was used to examine the prevalence and correlates of maternal depression when children were about 1,
3, 5, and 9 years old. Results show that, at any given survey wave, between 16% and 21% of mothers reported depression.
Nearly two-fifths (38%) of mothers reported depression at least once during the eight-year period, and 7% reported
persistent depression (depression at three or four of the four survey waves). Employment status, relationship status, and
fathers' depression were among the sociodemographic characteristics most robustly associated with both stability and
change in maternal depression. Given the important social consequences of maternal depression, not least of which is
impaired wellbeing among children of depressed mothers, prevention and treatment of maternal depression should be an
imperative for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers alike.

Introduction
Mental health problems are an important public health
concern. Major depressive disorder is one of the most common,
chronic, and debilitating mental health disorders, affecting more
than 13 million individuals annually in the United States [1]. The
social consequences of depression are far-reaching, and the World
Health Organization (WHO) lists depression as one of the most
burdensome diseases in the world [2]. Virtually all depressed
individuals experience some impairment in their ability to
undertake normal activities and, because of this, depression is
a leading cause of disability [1,3].
Depression among mothers may be of particular concern,
both because of the considerable consequences for mothers
themselves, but also because of the spillover effects that
maternal depression may have on children. Children of
depressed mothers have impaired cognitive, behavioral, and
health outcomes from infancy through adulthood, and are
especially at risk when maternal depression persists [4­10].
Depressed mothers often exhibit hostile, negative, or withdrawn
behaviors when interacting with their children [6,11]. De-
pression may create a stressful living environment, disrupt
family routines, or limit mothers' abilities to parent effectively
[11]. It is especially important to understand the prevalence and
correlates of depression among mothers of young children, as
young children are dependent on their mothers [12]. Un-
derstanding depression among unmarried mothers is also
important, as this is an increasing demographic group, these
mothers may be especially vulnerable, and we know little about
the prevalence or correlates of depression for this group
[7,13,14].
But our descriptive knowledge about maternal depression,
especially maternal depression among unmarried mothers, has
several limitations. First, much research uses small, nonrepresen-
tative, and homogeneous samples of mothers, resulting in
prevalence estimates ranging from 14% to 49% [15­21]. Most
studies of representative samples of mothers use data that are more
than 20 years old [22,23]. Additionally, studies often focus on the
postpartum period and ignore depression when children are in
early and middle childhood [22,24]. Finally, little is known about
stability and change in maternal depression, despite research
suggesting chronic maternal depression is most detrimental to
children [10,15,22,23]. The results of this manuscript, then, make
several contributions to our understanding of stability and change
in maternal depression, and the findings help inform the
development of programs and interventions to diagnose and treat
maternal depression.

Materials and Methods
Sample
Analyses use data from the Fragile Families and Child
Wellbeing Study, a longitudinal survey of nearly 5,000 new and
mostly unmarried parents in 20 U.S. cities [25]. Mothers
completed a 30- to 40-minute in-person interview at the
hospital after the birth of the focal child, between February
1998 and September 2000, and fathers were interviewed as
soon as possible after the child's birth. Mothers and fathers
were then interviewed by telephone when their children were
approximately 1, 3, 5, and 9 years old. Baseline response rates
were 82% for married mothers and 87% for unmarried
mothers. Of the 4,898 mothers who participated in the baseline
survey, 89%, 86%, 85%, and 74% participated in the 1-, 3-, 5-,
and 9-year surveys, respectively [26]. Because unmarried
mothers were oversampled, the sample over-represents minority
and economically disadvantaged families.
The analytic sample included observations in which the mother
completedatleasttwoconsecutivesurveys(notincludingthebaseline
survey, since depression was not measured at baseline) (N = 4,366).
Having participated in two consecutive surveys is especially
important for the random- and fixed-effects models (described
below).Giventhemajorityofmothersparticipatedintwoconsecutive
surveys, there were few differences between the full and analytic
samples.Comparedtothefullsample,mothersintheanalyticsample
were less likely to be foreign-born. About 15% of mothers in the
analytic sample were born outside the United States, compared to
17% of mothers in the full sample (p,0.05). Importantly, depression
was not associated with attrition, as mothers depressed at the 1-year
survey were equally likely as their non-depressed counterparts to
participate in each of the following surveys.
Measures
Maternaldepressionwasassessedwhenchildrenwere1,3,5,and9
years old (but not at baseline, as mothers had just given birth). The
measure of major depressive episode (MDE) came from mothers'
responses to the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-
Short Form (CIDI-SF) Version 1.0 [27]. Mothers were asked if, at
some time during the past year, they had feelings of dysphoria or
anhedonia. Mothers who experienced dysphoria and/or anhedonia
foratwo-weekperiodmostoftheday,everydaywereaskedadditional
questions (about losing interest in things, feeling tired, experiencing
a change in weight of at least 10 pounds, having trouble sleeping,
having trouble concentrating, feeling worthless, or thinking about
death). Those who answered affirmatively to at least one stem
question and at least three additional questions were considered
depressed. Although limitations to the CIDI-SF exist, it is commonly
used in large-scale community surveys to measure depression [28].
Analysesconsidertheprevalenceofdepressionwhenchildrenwere1,
3, 5, and 9 years old. Analyses also consider a categorical measure of
depression chronicity: no depression (mother reported depression at
zero survey waves), intermittent depression (mother reported de-
pression at one or two survey waves), and persistent depression
(mother reported depression at three or four survey waves).
The multivariate analyses included a host of control variables.
Mother's race was represented by a series of dummy variables: non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic
otherrace.Adummyvariableindicatedthemotherwasforeign-born.
Additional controls include mother's age (younger than 25 years, 25
to34years,35yearsandolder), education(lessthanhighschool,high
school diploma or GED, post-secondary education), employment in
the past week, household income (log), relationship status (married,
cohabiting, non-residential romantic relationship, no relationship),
and number of children in the household. Finally, analyses adjusted
for depression in the child's father (no depression, intermittent
depression, persistent depression), based on fathers' self-reported
responses to the CIDI-SF administered at the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 9-year
surveys. In the multinomial logistic regression models, all socio-
demographiccorrelatesweremeasuredatthebaselinesurvey(except
for employment, which was measured at the 1-year survey). In the
random- and fixed-effects logistic regression models, all variables
except for race and immigrant status were included as time-varying
characteristics (measured at the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 9-year surveys).
Analysis
The analysis proceeded in three stages. The first stage calculated
the prevalence of maternal depression at each of the four survey
waves and the prevalence of maternal depression chronicity.
Descriptive statistics show sociodemographic correlates, by the
prevalence of depression chronicity (no depression, intermittent
depression, persistent depression). Mean differences across groups
were tested with chi-square tests (for categorical variables) and
ANOVA tests (for continuous variables).
The second stage used multinomial logistic regression models to
estimate intermittent and persistent depression, both compared to
no depression. Model 1 adjusted for the sociodemographic
controls and Model 2 included a series of interaction terms
between fathers' depression and mothers' relationship status with
the father (intermittent depression 6 cohabiting, intermittent
depression 6 non-residential romantic relationship, intermittent
depression 6 no relationship, persistent depression 6 cohabiting,
persistent depression 6 non-residential romantic relationship,
persistent depression 6 no relationship).
The third and final stage used random- and fixed-effects models
to estimate change in depression as a function of change in the
covariates. For these models, the data were structured in a parent-
wave format where each mother was observed up to four points in
time (when children are 1, 3, 5, and 9 years old). The random-
effects model captured between- and within-individual variation
over time, compared to the more conservative fixed-effects model
that captured only within-individual variation. These fixed-effects
model allowed for an examination of how changes in socio-
demographic characteristics between waves were linked to changes
in depression, net of time-invariant characteristics and time-
varying observed characteristics.
Few observations were missing data on covariates, and these
observations were preserved using multiple imputation [29]. Both
dependent and independent variables were used to impute missing
independent variables, but missing dependent variables were not
imputed [30]. Findings were robust to listwise deletion. Because
observations were drawn from 20 cities, city fixed-effects and
clustered standard errors were included in all models. Survey
weights were not available for the 9-year survey, but analyses
adjusted for all variables used in creating the weights at prior
survey waves (race/ethnicity, education, relationship status, and
age) [31]. All analyses were performed in Stata/MP 12.1 [32].
Results
Prevalence of Depression
Table 1 presents unadjusted descriptive statistics of maternal
depression and all demographic characteristics for the analytic
sample. Importantly, depression was a common mental health
problem among this sample of mostly unmarried mothers. About
16% of mothers were depressed when their children were 1 year
old. About 21% were depressed at the 3-year survey, 17% at the 5-
year survey, and 17% at the 9-year survey. There was moderate

stability in depression at any two consecutive waves, with 52% of
mothers depressed at the 1-year survey also depressed at the 3-year
survey, 43% of mothers depressed at the 3-year survey also
depressed at the 5-year survey, and 44% of mothers depressed at
the 5-year survey also depressed at the 9-year survey (descriptives
not shown). Importantly, 38% of mothers reported depression at
some point during their child's first nine years. About 31%
reported intermittent depression (e.g., depression at one or two
survey waves) and 7% reported persistent depression (e.g.,
depression at three or four survey waves).
In terms of demographic characteristics, the majority of the
sample was racial/ethnic minorities. Nearly half of mothers (48%)
were non-Hispanic black and more than one-fourth (26%) were
Hispanic. About 15% of mothers were born outside the United
States, and more than half (54%) were younger than 25 years old
when they gave birth to the focal child. Most mothers did not have
education beyond high school at baseline, with 34% reporting less
than a high school degree and 31% reporting a high school
diploma or GED. At baseline, more than three- fifths (61%) of
mothers were in a co-residential relationship with the child's
father, and 13% were not in a relationship with the child's father.
More than one-quarter (27%) of children's fathers reported
depression in at least one survey.
Bivariate Correlates of Maternal Depression Chronicity
Table 2 presents unadjusted sociodemographic characteristics,
by maternal depression chronicity (no depression, intermittent
depression, persistent depression). To begin with, the descriptive
statistics showed statistically significant race/ethnic differences in
maternal depression chronicity. Non-Hispanic white and non-
Hispanic black mothers were less likely to report no depression or
intermittent depression, compared to persistent depression.
Hispanic and other race mothers were less likely to report
persistent depression, compared to no depression or intermittent
depression (p = 0.002). About 8% of mothers who reported
persistent depression were foreign-born, compared to 13% of
mothers who reported intermittent depression and 19% of
mothers who reported no depression (p = 0.000). Mothers who
reported intermittent or persistent depression, compared to those
who reported no depression, had lower educational attainment at
baseline (p = 0.001). They were also less likely to be employed at
the 1-year survey (p = 0.000) and had lower household incomes
(p = 0.000). Relationship status at baseline was also correlated with
depression. For example, 27% of mothers who reported no
depression were married at baseline, compared to 19% with
intermittent depression and 19% with persistent depression.
Similarly, 12% of mothers who reported no depression were no
longer in a relationship with the child's father at baseline,
compared to 14% with intermittent depression and 18% with
persistent depression (p = 0.000). Mothers with intermittent and
persistent depression had more children, on average, than their
counterparts with no depression (p = 0.045). There was also an
association between mothers' and fathers' depression. More than
three-quarters (77%) of mothers with no depression shared
children with fathers who reported no depression, compared to
70% of mothers with intermittent depression and 59% of mothers
with persistent depression (p = 0.000).
Multinomial Logistic Regression Models Estimating
Intermittent and Persistent Depression
Table 3 presents results from multinomial logistic regression
models estimating depression chronicity. The first two models
estimated the probability of mothers reporting intermittent
depression. The reference group was mothers reporting no
depression. In Model 1, which adjusted for all control variables,
there were no race/ethnic differences, suggesting mothers of all
race/ethnic groups were equally likely to report intermittent
depression compared to no depression. Similarly, both native- and
foreign-born mothers were equally likely to report intermittent

depression compared to no depression. Socioeconomic character-
istics were, however, related to maternal depression. Mothers with
a high school diploma or GED, compared to mothers who did not
graduate high school, were less likely to report intermittent
depression than no depression (OR = 0.85, CI = 0.74, 0.99).
Employed mothers were less likely to report intermittent de-
pression than no depression (OR = 0.80, CI = 0.72, 0.90), and
household income was inversely associated with intermittent
depression (OR = 0.96, CI = 0.92, 1.00). Baseline relationship
status was also associated with a greater likelihood of reporting
intermittent depression compared to no depression. Compared to
mothers married at baseline, mothers cohabiting at baseline had
1.39 times the odds of reporting intermittent depression
(CI = 1.11, 1.74), mothers in nonresidential romantic relationships
had 1.36 times the odds of reporting intermittent depression
(CI = 1.06, 1.76), and mothers not in a relationship had 1.43 times
the odds of reporting intermittent depression (CI = 1.09, 1.87).
Finally, Model 1 documented an association between fathers' and
mothers' depression chronicity. Mothers who shared children with
men reporting intermittent depression, compared to no de-
pression, were more likely to report intermittent depression
themselves (OR = 1.25, CI = 1.06, 2.12). Persistent depression
among fathers was also positively associated with intermittent
depression among mothers, though this coefficient did not reach
statistical significance, likely because of the few number of fathers
who fell into this category.
Interaction terms between fathers' depression and mothers'
relationship status with the father were added to Model 2. These
interaction terms suggest that fathers' intermittent depression was
less strongly associated with mothers' intermittent depression,
compared to no depression, when mothers and fathers were in
a nonresidential romantic relationship (OR = 0.60, CI = 0.33,
1.08) or no relationship (OR = 0.62, CI = 0.38, 1.02) compared to
being married. The pattern of results is perhaps more striking ­
and certainly easier to interpret ­ by considering coefficients (not
presented) instead of odds ratios. For example, the coefficient for

between fathers' persistent depression and relationship status did

The final two models in Table 3 estimate the probability of
mothers reporting persistent depression. Again, the reference
group was mothers reporting no depression and Model 1 included
all control variables. Importantly, the factors associated with
intermittent depression were not necessarily the same factors
associated with persistent depression. For one, though not
associated with intermittent depression, race/ethnicity and immi-
grant status were associated with persistent depression. Hispanic
mothers, compared to their non-Hispanic White counterparts,
were less likely to report persistent depression than no depression
(OR = 0.61, CI = 0.39, 0.98). Foreign-born mothers were also less
likely to report persistent depression, compared to no depression,
than their native-born counterparts, though this coefficient was
only marginally significant (OR = 0.57, CI = 0.31, 1.04). House-
hold income was associated with persistent depression, as mothers
with higher household incomes were less likely to report persistent
depression than no depression (OR = 0.88, CI = 0.82, 0.95).
Additionally, mothers not in a relationship at baseline, compared
to those married at baseline, had a greater likelihood of reporting
persistent depression than no depression (OR = 1.64, CI = 0.92,
2.91). Similar to estimates predicting intermittent depression,
mothers who shared children with depressed men ­ especially
intermittently depressed men ­ were more likely to report
persistent depression than no depression (OR = 1.92, 1.55, 2.36).
Model 2 includes interaction terms between fathers' depression
and mothers' relationship status with the father. Interaction terms
between relationship status and fathers' depression, showed that
the relationship between fathers' intermittent depression and
mothers' persistent depression was weaker when mothers and
fathers were in a nonresidential romantic relationship (OR = 0.41,
CI = 0.19, 0.90) or not in a relationship at baseline (OR = 0.41,
CI = 0.17, 0.99) compared to being married. Again, the pattern of
results is easier to interpret when considering coefficients (not
presented). In estimating persistent maternal depression, the
coefficient for fathers' intermittent depression (1.28) was nearly
wiped out by the coefficients for the intermittent depression 6
non-residential romantic relationship interaction (20.89) and for
the intermittent depression 6 no relationship interaction (20.88).
Interactions between fathers' persistent depression and relation-
ship status did not reach statistical significance, likely due to the
small number of fathers who fell into this category and the large
confidence intervals, but the point estimates were in the expected
direction.
Importantly, there was only one statistically significant differ-
ence in the correlates of intermittent and persistent depression
(coefficients not shown). Fathers' intermittent depression, com-
pared to no depression, was associated less with mothers'
intermittent depression than persistent depression (OR = 0.65,
CI = 0.51, 0.83).
Random- and Fixed-Effects Logistic Regression Models
Estimating Change in Depression
In Table 4, the random- and fixed-effects logistic regression
models took into account all sociodemographic characteristics
included in the previous multivariate models, but included time-
varying characteristics whenever possible (e.g., age, education,
employment, household income, relationship status, number of
children in household, fathers' depression). Turning to the first
column, which presents the random-effects model, the correlates
of change in maternal depression were similar to the correlates of
maternal depression chronicity. Hispanic mothers, compared to
white mothers, were less likely to report depression (OR = 0.71,
CI = 0.53, 0.91), and foreign-born mothers were less likely than
native-born mothers to report depression (OR = 0.68, CI = 0.53,
0.89). Additionally, employed mothers reported less depression
than mothers not working (OR = 0.67, CI = 0.59, 0.75), and
household income was negatively associated with depression
(OR = 0.93, CI = 0.89, 0.97). Mothers in a nonresidential roman-
tic relationship or no relationship with their child's father,
compared to married mothers, had a greater odds of depression
(OR = 1.49, CI = 1.23, 1.81; OR = 1.84, CI = 1.55, 2.18). Fathers'
depression was associated with a greater odds of depression among
mothers (OR = 1.37, CI = 1.14, 1.64). The association between
changes in relationship status and changes in maternal depression
did not vary by changes in fathers' depression (not presented).
The fixed-effect model, presented in the second column, shows
only employment, relationship status, and depression in the child's
father were statistically significant independent predictors of
change in maternal depression. Becoming employed between
survey waves was associated with a lower likelihood of becoming
depressed between survey waves (OR = 0.81, CI = 0.71, 0.94).
Additionally, mothers who moved into no relationship between
survey waves had 1.58 times the odds of becoming depressed
between survey waves (CI = 1.28, 1.96). Further, changes in
fathers' depression was positively associated with changes in
depression (OR = 1.22, CI = 0.99, 1.49). Changes in other time-
varying characteristics were not associated with changes in
depression, suggesting that pre-existing, stable characteristics
may be partly responsible for the statistically significant associa-
tions shown in the random-effects models.
Discussion
This manuscript uses recent, longitudinal data from the Fragile
Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a sample of mostly un-
married parents, to estimate the prevalence and correlates of
maternal depression. Results show that, at any given survey wave,
between 16% and 21% of mothers reported depression. Nearly
two-fifths (38%) reported depression at least once during the eight-
year period. About 31% reported intermittent depression (e.g.,
depression at one or two survey waves) and 7% reported persistent
depression (e.g., depression at three or four survey waves). These
prevalence estimates are higher than estimates of the general
population and lower than estimates found in samples of
disadvantaged mothers [1,16­18]. They are consistent with other
research on representative samples of mothers, though it is difficult
to make comparisons because most representative studies use the
Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) to
measure depression (instead of the CIDI-SF) [22­23,33].
A second goal of this paper was to estimate the correlates of
maternal depression. Consistent with previous research, employ-
ment and relationship status are among the sociodemographic
characteristics most robustly associated with both stability and
change maternal depression [1,24,33­37]. The association between
relationship status and maternal depression is complicated, though,
as depression in the child's father was also robustly associated with
both stability and change in maternal depression if the parents were
living together. This is consistent with other research on assortative
mating by mental health [38] and suggests that simply being in
a marital relationship may not be enough to ameliorate depression
among mothers (and, instead, that partner characteristics are
important). Other demographic characteristics ­ including educa-
tion and employment ­ were associated with intermittent depression
but not persistent depression, which is consistent with research
suggesting differential causes of depression onset and depression
persistence [23,37].
Taken together, these findings make several contributions to the
existing literature on maternal depression. First, the estimates
Prevalence and Correlates of Maternal Depression
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 September 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 9 | e45709
presented use data from a recent, large, longitudinal and
heterogeneous sample of a group most at risk of maternal
depression. This is in contrast to much existing research that relies
on outdated or non-representative samples. Second, the estimates
consider depression among mothers over an eight-year time period
that spans both early and middle childhood. Third, by examining
both stability and change in maternal depression over this eight-
year period, as well as using rigorous fixed-effects models that
examine within-person changes in maternal depression, these
findings add to a literature on the correlates of maternal
depression that is often limited to considering depression at one
point in time.
Though these analyses provide a comprehensive portrait of the
prevalence and correlates of maternal depression, several limita-
tions exist. First, because unmarried mothers were oversampled,
the sample is over-representative of minority and economically
disadvantaged mothers. Though these results cannot be general-
ized to all mothers, they provide a comprehensive understanding
of an increasing, vulnerable demographic group [7,13]. Un-
married mothers and their children have been the focus of
increasing research and policy initiatives and, indeed, some suggest
that such family arrangements lead to increasing inequality and
the reproduction of poverty [39,40].
Additional limitations exist. The dichotomous measure of
depression makes it impossible to consider mothers who exhibited
some symptoms of depression but did not fit the diagnostic
criterion for depression [41]. Similarly, for mothers classified as
depressed, the dichotomous measure did not allow for an
examination of heterogeneity in depression severity, despite the
fact that children may suffer most when mothers are severely
depressed [42]. Additionally, despite the fact the data span an
eight-year time period, yearly measures of depression were only
assessed four times. For example, a mother who experienced
a short-lived bout of depression between the 1- and 3-year surveys
would only fit the diagnostic criterion for yearly depression if that
depression occurred in the year prior to the 3-year survey. Given
this, it is likely the true prevalence of maternal depression is
underreported. Finally, the analyses cannot demonstrate a causal
relationship between the sociodemographic characteristics and
maternal depression. Certainly, socioeconomic status, relationship

status, and fathers' depression are likely both causes and
consequences of maternal depression, and these analyses simply
lay the groundwork for future research to understand these
complicated, likely bi-directional relationships.
Despite these limitations, the findings have important implica-
tions for public health professionals. To begin with, they suggest
a large number of mothers suffer from depression when their
children are in early and middle childhood. But depressed
mothers ­ at least the mostly unmarried mothers in this sample
­ are not necessarily receiving treatment for their condition. In
fact, supplemental analyses (not presented) show that 80% of
mothers depressed at the 3-year survey do not receive counseling
or therapy for depression and 86% are not taking anti-depressants.
Screening procedures by primary care physicians and pediatri-
cians may help identify and treat depressed mothers. Similarly, this
group of mostly unmarried mothers may face particular barriers
that prevent them from seeking and receiving treatment (e.g.,
impediments to finding child care, difficulty affording co-payments
or prescriptions) [43]. Researchers and practitioners should work
to identify and eliminate these barriers.
Additionally, these findings attest to the salience of socioeco-
nomic status as a correlate of maternal depression. Understanding
this and other risk factors associated with depression may help
physicians identify mothers who may especially benefit from
treatment. Given that socioeconomic status is amenable to policy
interventions such as anti-poverty programs that promote
economic self-sufficiency, effective prevention and treatment
strategies may include targeting such correlates of depression
[44]. Improving economic self-sufficiency may also increase the
probability of marriage [45], an additional correlate of maternal
depression. However, given that fathers' depression plays an
important role in maternal depression, these results suggest that
policymakers concerned with marriage promotion among eco-
nomically disadvantaged couples must consider parents' mental
health [24]. Given the large social consequences of maternal
depression, not least of which is impaired wellbeing among
children of depressed mothers, prevention and treatment of
maternal depression should be an imperative for public health
professionals [10].
