Abstract
Background: The objective was to evaluate the association of albuminuria with cancer mortalities in adults
ages 50 and older.
Methods: A total of 6,112 adults ages 50 years and above without a history of cancer at baseline in the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988-1994) were included in the
analysis. Albuminuria was measured with urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) in mg/mmol. Cancer
mortality was obtained from the NHANES III­linked follow-up database (up to December 31, 2006).
Cox-regression models were used to examine the associations of interest.
Results: Albuminuria was present in 705 men (17.5%) and 592 women (14.3%). During an average follow-
up of 149 months, 613 subjects died of cancers including 184 lung cancers, 65 colorectal cancers, 55 prostate
cancers, and 309 other cancers. There was an increased mortality risk associated with logarithmically
transformed UACR for all-cancer [relative risk (RR), 1.20; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06-1.36], lung cancer
(RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.05-1.43), and prostate cancer mortality (RR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.01-1.95) in men. No
associations between UACR and cancer were apparent in women.
Conclusions: The analysis shows that albuminuria is associated with an increased risk of cancer death,
specifically for all-cause, lung, and prostate cancers in men ages 50 and above.
Impact: Further studies are needed to explore the relationship between albuminuria and specific cancers.
Understanding the biological link between albuminuria and cancer will be critical for determining whether
albuminuria represents an early marker or a potential therapeutic target. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev;

Introduction
Albuminuria is an important and independent risk
marker for cardiovascular disease in the general popula-
tion and, more specifically, in patients with hypertension
and diabetes mellitus (1-3). Whether albuminuria is a con-
tributory factor in atherothrombosis or merely a marker
remains unclear. However, evidence suggests that com-
mon pathophysiologic processes such as endothelial
dysfunction, chronic low-grade inflammation, and trans-
vascular leakage of macromolecules may underlie the as-
sociation between microalbuminuria and cardiovascular
disease (4). Microalbuminuria is also considered an early
sign of intrarenal vascular dysfunction and a potent
marker for the subsequent development of progressive
kidney disease (5-7).
Albuminuria is associated with increases in all-cause
and cardiovascular mortality in uncomplicated hyperten-
sives and type 2 diabetics (8, 9). When combined as indi-
cators of renal dysfunction, decreased glomerular
filtration rate and albuminuria predict both all-cause
and cardiovascular mortality (10). In the Prevention of
Renal and Vascular End Stage Disease study conducted
in the Netherlands, a 2-fold increase of albuminuria
was associated with a relative risk (RR) of 1.29 and 1.12
for cardiovascular and noncardiovascular mortality,
respectively (1).
The Prevention of Renal and Vascular End Stage
Disease study proposed that albuminuria-associated
noncardiovascular deaths might represent greater fatali-
ties due to malignant neoplasms, although specific etiol-
ogies were not analyzed. Little is known regarding the
association of albuminuria with cancer mortality. Because
cancer is currently second only to cardiovascular disease

as a leading cause of death in the United States, the
hypothesis was formulated that albumin in the urine
would be associated with an increased risk of cancer
mortality. The objective of this study was to test the
hypothesis by evaluating the relationship between albu-
minuria and cancer mortality using the large-scale
nationally representative sample from the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III,
1988-1994) and its follow up in the NHANES III­linked
mortality data set (through December 31, 2006; refs. 11, 12).
Materials and Methods
Study design and population
NHANES III was conducted by the National Center for
Health Statistics from 1988 to 1994 using a stratified,
multistage, and cluster sampling design to obtain a rep-
resentative sample of the non-institutionalized civilian
U.S. population. Detailed survey operations manuals,
consent documents, and brochures of the NHANES are
available on the NHANES web site (11). The NHANES
III was reviewed and approved by the National Center
for Health Statistics Institutional Review Board. Of
7,593 adults 50 years of age that completed the
NHANES III interview and examination between 1988
and 1994, the current analysis was limited to non-
Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, and Mexican
Americans by excluding 266 participants identified as
other race. Participants with previous history of malig-
nancy (n = 547), missing data for follow-up information
(n = 19), and other covariates (e.g., urinary albumin mea-
surement, n = 664) were also excluded from the cohort.
The remaining 6,112 subjects (2,996 men and 3,116
women) in the analyses represent an estimated U.S.
non-institutional population of 49,914,220 persons ages
50 and older after adjusting for sample weights.
Baseline demographics
In NHANES III, data were collected at all study sites
by trained personnel according to standardized pro-
cedures. Information on age, sex, and smoking status
was self-reported. Subjects with serum cotinine values
>14 ng/mL were classified as current smokers, otherwise
as nonsmokers (13). Subjects were classified as diabetic
based on a self-reported diagnosis, prescribed medication
for diabetes (insulin or oral agents), or a fasting plasma
glucose of 126 mg/dL (14, 15). A diagnosis of hyper-
tension was assigned if the subjects reported taking
prescribed medication for hypertension, a physician di-
agnosis of hypertension, or if the systolic blood pressure
was 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure was
90 mm Hg. Three to four blood pressure (BP) determi-
nations were made using a mercury sphygmomanometer
from the right arm by a physician. Averaged systolic and
diastolic blood pressure determinations were obtained.
Body mass index (BMI) was defined as body weight
(kg) divided by the square of the body height (m2). Blood
was sampled, processed locally, stored, and then shipped
to central laboratories for analysis (12).
Definition of albuminuria
A spot urine sample was collected to determine uri-
nary albumin using a solid phase fluorescent immunoas-
say, capable of measuring values below the limit of
detection by the dipstick method (16). Urine creatinine
was analyzed using the Jaffé reaction. The urinary albu-
min-to-creatinine ratio (UACR in mg/mmol) was calcu-
lated by dividing the urinary albumin value by the
urinary creatinine concentration for each subject. The
presence of albuminuria was defined as UACR >2.5
mg/mmol in men and >3.5 mg/mmol in women (17).
Serum creatinine was measured by means of the mod-
ified kinetic Jaffé reaction, and standardized serum creat-
inine values were calibrated by using an enzymatic
creatinine assay traceable to a gold standard reference
method (18). The glomerular filtration rate was calculat-
ed from the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD)
Study equation: MDRD estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR; mL/min/1.73 m2) = 175 × (serum creatinine,
mg/dL)-1.154 × (age)-0.203 × (0.742 if female) × (1.212 if
African American; ref. 19). The presence of chronic
kidney disease was defined as MDRD eGFR <60 mL/
min/1.73 m2 (20).
Cancer mortality follow-up
Several of the most common cancers were selected for
analysis. Lung, colorectal and prostate were examined in
the current study based on cause of death codes from the
International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision
(ICD-10). Cancer mortality was analyzed for all-cause
cancer (ICD codes: C00-C95), lung cancer (ICD codes:
C33-34), colorectal cancer (ICD codes: C18-21), and pros-
tate cancer (ICD codes: C61). Cancers other than lung
cancer, colorectal cancer, or prostate cancer (in men) were
defined as other types of cancer. Follow-up for each
participant was calculated as the difference between the
NHANES III examination date and the end of follow-up
(date of death or December 31, 2006, whichever occurred
first). Those found alive were right-censored at the last
date known alive or at the end of the follow-up. For
cancer-specific analysis, those who died from other
cancers were also right-censored at the time of death.
Statistical methods
Continuous variables were reported as median (inter-
quartile range) and categorical data in percentages. For
outcome measurements, the Cox proportional hazard
model with the Efron method was used to calculate the
RR, also known as hazard ratio (HR). RRs were deter-
mined for mortality risk associated with albuminuria
for all-cause and cause-specific cancer (lung, prostate, co-
lorectal, and other types of cancer). Possible confounding
factors, such as age, race/ethnicity, smoking, BMI, hyper-
tension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease were added
to adjust the association of albuminuria with cancer

mortality. Except for age and BMI, all variables were fit
as categorical terms, which were coded as indicator
(dummy) variables. For instance, two indicator variables
were created to code for three race/ethnicity categories:
non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, and Mexican
Americans. Statistical analyses were conducted using
SUDAAN 10.01 (Research Triangle Institute, 2009) with
the Taylor series linearization and were adjusted for
sampling weights to obtain unbiased national estimates
in all analyses. Two-tailed P < 0.05 values were accepted
as statistically significant.
Results
The baseline demographics of study subjects (2,996
men and 3,116 women) are presented in Table 1. Ex-
cept smoking (both men and women) and BMI (men
only), all demographic and clinical variables were sta-
tistically different between those with and those with-
out albuminuria (P < 0.05) for both sexes. In general,
albuminuria tended to be more prevalent among the
elderly and subjects with chronic kidney disease, hy-
pertension, or diabetes. Albuminuria was also associat-
ed with race/ethnicity such that albuminuria was more
common in non-Hispanic blacks. Although statistically
different and suggestive of a marginal reduction in re-
nal function, it is unclear whether the higher serum cre-
atinine and lower MDRD eGFR are biologically
significant differences.
Between 1988 and 2006, a total of 613 subjects (8.8%)
died of cancer (all-cause) in an average follow-up of
149 months (range, 1-217 mo). This included 184 lung
cancers (123 men and 61 women), 65 colorectal cancers
(48 men and 17 women), 55 prostate cancers, and 309
other cancer deaths (152 men and 157 women). This cor-
responds to age-adjusted mortality rates (year 2000 U.S.
standard population) of 3.2 for lung, 0.94 for colorectal,
1.1 for prostate, and 3.7 for other cancers for men and
1.7 for lung, 0.44 for colorectal, and 4.4 for other cancers
for women per 1,000 person-years, respectively (data not
shown). As shown in both Kaplan-Meier survival curves
(Figs. 1 and 2 for men and women, respectively) and uni-
variate Cox proportional hazard regression (Table 2),
subjects with albuminuria are at increased mortality risk
from all all-cause cancer, prostate cancer (men only),
and the collected cancers other than lung, prostate, and
colorectal cancers, as compared with those without albu-
minuria for both sexes. For instance, the RR of all-cause
cancer deaths were 83% higher among men with albuminuria
than those without it [RR, 1.83; 95% confidence interval

(CI), 1.36-2.47; P < 0.001]. Despite a numerically increased
mortality risk for both lung and colorectal cancer deaths in
men (RR, 1.39 and 1.99, respectively), these results failed to
reach statistical significance. In comparison, there is not
even a suggestion of an association of albuminuria with
lung and colorectal cancer mortality in women.
Similar results were obtained by applying the multi-
variate model which included adjustments for age,
race/ethnicity, smoking, BMI, and hypertension, dia-
betes, and chronic kidney disease status. However, the
resulting RRs were generally reduced by approximately
20% to 40%, and none of the associations reached statis-
tical significance. For instance, the risk for all-cause
cancer mortality associated with albuminuria decreased
from RR, 1.83 (95% CI, 1.36-2.47; P  0.001) to 1.38 (95%
CI, 0.99-1.91; P = 0.06), and became marginally signifi-
cant in men (Table 2). Indeed, age and smoking are two
of the most important factors in cancer deaths. In this
cohort, age was significantly associated with increased
cancer mortality for all-cause and cause-specific cancers
regardless of sex except lung cancer in women (P = 0.10;
data not shown). On the other hand, smoking is a sig-
nificant risk factor for all-cause and lung cancer for both
sexes, and other types of cancer deaths for men. Of
note, neither albuminuria nor smoking were related to
colorectal cancer death for men or women. Likewise,
no association was found between smoking and pros-
tate cancer death (RR, 1.44; 95% CI, 0.66-3.14; P =
0.35; data not shown).
Comparable RRs were generated from the multivari-
ate-adjusted analyses using log-transformed UACR
as predictor. Logarithmically transformed UACR was

significantly correlated with all of the outcomes of inter-
est except colorectal cancer in men, suggesting a dose-
response relationship between albuminuria and cancer
mortality (Table 3). Of note, there is a positive association
between log-transformed UACR and prostate cancer in
men (RR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.01-1.95; P = 0.04). Despite the
consistent positive associations between log-transformed
UACR and cancer deaths observed in women, none of
the results are significant (Table 3).
Discussion
The results of the present study showed that albuminuria
was associatedwith increased risk of cancer deaths from all-
cause, lung, and prostate cancers in men from the United
States ages 50 and older. The association was not significant
for any type of cancer in women of the same age group.
One prior report from the Tromsø Study showed that
UACR at baseline was correlated with subsequent cancer
incidence. A total 590 out of 5,425 participants without
diabetes or previous cancer had the first diagnosis of
cancer in 10.3 years of follow-up. Each SD-higher rise
in the log-transformed UACR was associated with a RR
of 1.17 for cancer (P < 0.001). Participants with UACR in
the highest quintile were 8.3- and 2.4-fold more likely to
receive a diagnosis of bladder and lung cancer, respec-
tively (6). Our study again examined the relationship
between UACR and a variety of cancer mortalities, with
similar results.
Despite the growing regard for albuminuria as a para-
neoplastic and inflammatory phenomenon, the underly-
ing mechanisms for the association between albuminuria
and cancer incidence/mortalities are largely unknown
(21-24). Chronic inflammation triggers endothelial dys-
function leading to albuminuria (25) and may provide a
common link because inflammation is associated with
both increased cancer (26) and cardiovascular risk (4).
The renin-angiotensin system may participate in generat-
ing the increased cancer risk associated with albuminuria.
Angiotensin II has been implicated in the development or
invasion of several kinds of cancer (27). Angiotensin could
exert mitogenic activity through angiotensin II type I
(ATII-I) receptors and ATII-I receptor expression is higher
in cancerous prostate (28).
The current data analysis showed a positive associa-
tion between albuminuria and all-cancer mortality in

men, mainly attributed to death from lung and prostate
cancer. There was a dose-responsive relationship be-
tween albuminuria and prostate cancer death in men.
The RR of prostate cancer deaths increased by 1.40-fold
when the log-scale of albuminuria increased by 1. In
stark contrast with male counterparts, there was no
significant association between albuminuria with both
all-cause and cause-specific cancer deaths in women.
The moderating influence of sex could be attributed to
prostate cancer in men and the differential risks of lung
cancer between men and women. Although the preva-
lence of lung cancer in men has been decreasing, it has
been increasing in women. The biology of lung cancer
differs between the sexes, attributed in part to differences
in growth factor receptors, endocrine influences, enzy-
matic clearance of toxins, the susceptibility to DNA dam-
age, and the capacity for DNA repair, all of which may
contribute to the observed differences in treatment out-
comes (29). The finding in the current study of an associ-
ation between albuminuria and lung cancer mortalities in
men, but not in women, further shows a sex difference in
the development and prognosis of lung cancer.
Albuminuria is a marker of many underlying diseases,
including cardiovascular disease. In the study group, the
estimated prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular dis-
ease (positive response to the questions: "Doctor ever
told you had a heart attack" or "Doctor told: congestive
heart failure") was 10.2% (12.8% for men and 8.0% for
women). After further adjustment for cardiovascular dis-
ease, the associations between albuminuria and cancer
deaths were generally reduced 5% to 10% and there
was no positive association between pre-existing car-
diovascular disease with cancer mortalities. Similarly,
although serum cholesterol has been found to be posi-
tively associated with albuminuria (30), baseline choles-
terol was not associated with cancer mortalities.
One of the major limitations of this study is that de-
spite biological plausibility, the current evidence sup-
ports only an association, and not causation, between
albuminuria and cancer mortality. In addition, the use
of single albumin measurements may not adequately
assess normal within-person variations and may bias
our findings toward the null (31). The small sample size
for many cancer case subpopulations limits the ability to
determine whether the association between albuminuria
and cancer is a general oncogenic effect or is attributed to
one or more specific cancers. Thus, it is also difficult to
develop a predictive model based on albuminuria unless
other markers (e.g., prostate-specific antigen and serum
calcium levels) are also incorporated (32).
In conclusion, the presence of albuminuria increases
the risk of cancer death, especially all-cause, lung, and
prostate cancer in men over 50 years of age. The associ-
ation was independent of other conventional risk factors,
such as smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic
kidney disease. The association was not apparent in
women and the sex specificity of the observation clearly
needs to be resolved. Further study is also needed to ex-
plore whether albuminuria contributes to prostate cancer
or is merely a predictive marker of its subsequent inci-
dence and/or progression. Understanding the underly-
ing biological mechanisms in this regard will determine
the prospect of using renal interventions in the manage-
ment of prostate cancer.
