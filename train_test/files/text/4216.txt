Introduction
Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the
female population in the United States, accounting for
approximately 5% of all cancers diagnosed among women.1-
4 The conventional course of therapy is maximal surgical
debulking of the tumor mass followed by a combination of
taxane and platinum-based chemotherapy.5 Despite 70% of
patients initially responding well to treatment, the emer-
gence of drug resistance and side effects has rendered a
wide variety of the currently available chemotherapeutic
agents ineffective,6 and the 5-year survival rate remains less
than 40%.1-3,5,7,8 Hence, there is a compelling need to
explore novel therapeutic interventions for this disease.
The present studies were aimed at identification of alter-
native therapeutic approaches to enhance the efficacy of
current chemotherapeutic regimes using nontoxic nutraceu-
ticals that have health benefits beyond their normal nutri-
tional properties.9 Bitter melon (Momordica charantia),

Abstract
Objective. Acquired chemoresistance is a major obstacle in the clinical management of ovarian cancer. Therefore, searching
for alternative therapeutic modalities is urgently needed. Bitter melon (Momordica charantia) is a traditional dietary fruit,
but its extract also shows potential medicinal values in human diabetes and cancers. Here, we sought to investigate
the extract of bitter melon (BME) in antitumorigenic and cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in ovarian cancer cells. Methods.
Three varieties of bitter melon were used to prepare the BME. Ovarian cancer cell lines, human immortalized epithelial
ovarian cells (HOSEs), and nude mice were used to evaluate the cell cytotoxicity, cisplatin resistance, and tumor inhibitory
effect of BME. The molecular mechanism of BME was examined by Western blotting. Results. Cotreatment with BME
and cisplatin markedly attenuated tumor growth in vitro and in vivo in a mouse xenograft model, whereas there was no
observable toxicity in HOSEs or in nude mice in vivo. Interestingly, the antitumorigenic effects of BME varied with different
varieties of bitter melon, suggesting that the amount of antitumorigenic substances may vary. Studies of the molecular
mechanism demonstrated that BME activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in an AMP-independent but CaMKK
(Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase)-dependent manner, exerting anticancer effects through activation of AMPK
and suppression of the mTOR/p70S6K and/or the AKT/ERK/FOXM1 (Forkhead Box M1) signaling cascade. Conclusion. BME
functions as a natural AMPK activator in the inhibition of ovarian cancer cell growth and might be useful as a supplement
to improve the efficacy of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in ovarian cancer.

which is a popular herb in ancient folk medicines in China,
India, Southeast Asia, and Central America, has received
much global recognition not only because of its remarkable
hypoglycemic effects, but also because of its recently rec-
ognized anticancer effects. The findings that bitter melon
exhibits anticancer properties is reminiscent of metformin, a
derivative of a natural plant product, originally developed as
an insulin-sensitizing and antihyperglycemic drug used in
the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus.10 Recently, it has
been suggested that the anticancer effects of metformin11,12
might be a result of its capability to stimulateAMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK).13 AMPK is a cellular energy sensor
that plays an important role in the maintenance of energy
homeostasis in response to external stresses.14,15 Recent
studies have suggested that AMPK reprograms cancer cell
metabolism and inhibits cell proliferation in various human
cancers.16,17 Our previous investigations have demonstrated
that growth of cervical cancer cells is significantly sup-
pressed by a number of pharmacological activators of
AMPK, such as metformin, AICAR, and A23187, by reduc-
ing the Wnt/-catenin18 and AKT/FOXO3a/Forkhead Box
M1 (FOXM1)19 signaling cascades. However, because of
the toxic side effects of conventional AMPK activators such
as metformin, which can cause lactic acidosis and gastroin-
testinal side effects,20,21 the use of nontoxic, natural AMPK
activators may be preferable to combat the development of
ovarian cancer and chemoresistance.
Recent studies have suggested that extract of bitter
melon (BME) contains triterpenoids and possesses the abil-
ity to activate AMPK and induce GLUT4 translocation9,22;
however, its antitumor effects and the underlying molecular
mechanisms are not totally clear. BME has potent antitumor
activity against different cancer cells, probably because of
the presence of some of its active components, including
triterpenoids such as cucurbitacin B (cucB) and kuguacin J.
Triterpenoids from a wide range of botanicals have already
been confirmed to possess antiproliferative23-25 and anti-
invasive26,27 features. More than 50 triterpenoids indeed
have been extracted from bitter melon; however, their bio-
logical functions have yet to be investigated in detail.
Recently, it had been reported that cucB, a triterpenoid from
Cucurbitaceae vegetables, existed in the seeds of bitter
melon as well and had induced cell cycle arrest and apopto-
sis in human colon adenocarcinoma cancer cells.25 Another
triterpenoid, kuguacin J, which accounts for only around
1.6% of bitter melon leaf extract, had been shown to signifi-
cantly inhibit cancer and/or carcinogenesis by causing cell
cycle arrest at the G1 phase and inducing apoptosis in pre-
initiated or initiated tumor cells. In more advanced tumors,
kuguacin J not only had the ability to sensitize chemoresis-
tant cancer cells to anticancer drug­induced cell death, but
also to successfully block tumor progression and metasta-
sis, implying that natural compounds from BME might be
useful in the development of chemopreventive as well as
chemotherapeutic agents.
In this study, we examined the anticancer effects of BME
and compared the tumor-suppressive properties of different
varieties of bitter melon. Studies of the molecular mechanism
revealed that BME acts as a naturalAMPK activator, increas-
ing AMPK through Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein
kinase- (CaMKK) signaling in an AMP-independent
manner, which in turn represses both mTOR/p70S6K and
AKT/ERK/FOXM1 signals. It is important to note that based
on the nontoxic nature of BME, we explored the possibility
of using BME as a potential supplement to improve the effi-
cacy of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in ovarian cancer.

(provided by Professor B. K.Tsang, Department of Obstetrics
and Gynecology, University of Ottawa, Canada; authentica-
tion of cell lines carried out by in-house STR DNA profiling
analysis), SKOV3, OVCA433, ES2 (American Type Culture
Collection, Rockville, MD), and 2 human immortalized epi-
thelial ovarian cells (HOSEs), HOSE17-1 and HOSE 96-9-
18 (provided by Professor G. S. W. Tsao, Department of
Anatomy, The University of Hong Kong), were used in this
study. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's
Medium (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) sup-
plemented with 10% (volume/volume [v/v]) fetal bovine
serum (Invitrogen, Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD, USA ) and 100
U/mL penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA) in an incubator at 37°C with humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO
2
and 95% air. Three varieties of
young bitter melon (not yet ripe) such as Thailand, Chinese,
and Taiwanese were purchased from the supermarket
(Supplementary Figure S1, available at http://ict.sagepub.
com/supplemental). After being washed and deseeded, bitter
melon extract (BME) of each variety was extracted according
to the method described in previous publications.28,29 Briefly,
BME was extracted by a household blender and centrifuged
at 500g at 4°C for half an hour (Supplementary Figure S1).
The supernatant was filtered using a 0.22 µm syringe filter
and stored in aliquots at -80°C for future use. As needed,
0.25% to 10% (v/v in medium) of pure BME was used for in
vitro and in vivo studies. The BME samples were stored at the
Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of
Hong Kong. AMPK activators AICAR, A23187, and metfor-
min and the CaMKK inhibitor STO-609 were obtained
from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK).
HEK-293 Cells Expressing Tetracycline-Inducible
AMPK-2 (Wild Type or Mutant) and RNAi-
Mediated AMPK1 Knockdown
DNA encoding full-length human AMPK-2 was amplified
with primers designed to encode a 5-BamHI site and a
378 Integrative Cancer Therapies 15(3)
C-terminal FLAG tag followed by an XhoI site. The result-
ing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product was cloned
into the pcDNA5/FRT (Flp recombinase target)/TO plasmid
(Invitrogen) to create the plasmid pcDND5/FRT/TO/2. The
R531G mutation was created in this plasmid using the
QuikChangeSite-DirectedMutagenesissystem(Stratagene).
T-RexHEK293cellscontainingasingleFRTsite(Invitrogen)
were transfected with Fugene6 (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA) using the plasmids POG44 encoding Flp recombinase
(Invitrogen) and pcDND5/FRT/TO/2 at a ratio of 9:1. After
48 hours, the cells were detached using trysin and replated in
medium containing hygromycin B (200 µg/mL) and blastici-
din (15 µg/mL). The medium was replaced every 3 days
until cell foci could be identified, and individual foci were
then selected and expanded. The expression of FLAG-
tagged AMPK-2 was checked using Western blotting with
anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO).
Expression of AMPK-2 (wild-type, AMP-sensitive [WT]
or AMP/ADP-insensitive R531G mutant [RG]) was induced
with tetracycline (1 µg/mL) for 48 hours. To knockdown
human AMPK1, the TriFECTa RNAi Kit, which contains 3
siRNAs specifically targeting human AMPK1, was pur-
chased from IDT (Integrated DNATechnologies, Inc, Iowa).
Cell transfection was carried out using LipofectAMINETM
2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruc-
tions. The universal negative control siRNA (IDT) was used
as scrambled control, and Western blotting was used to
verify the expression of AMPK1.
RNA Extraction and Real-Time Quantitative
Reverse Transcription PCR (qPCR)
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Complementary
DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using a reverse transcription
reagent kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City). The expression
level of FOXM1 was evaluated by qPCR in an ABI PRISM
7500 system (Applied Biosystems) using Taqman gene
expression assays: human FOXM1 (Assay ID: Hs00153543_
m1). Human 18S rRNA (Assay ID: Hs99999901_m1) was
used as an internal control.
Western Blot Analysis
Proteins in cell lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE
and transferred to polyvinylidene-difluoride membranes.
The membranes were blotted with 5% skimmed milk and
subsequently probed overnight at 4°C with primary antibod-
ies specific for anti-p-AMPK, anti-AMPK1, anti-AMPK,
anti-p-AKT, anti-AKT, anti-p-p70S6K, anti-p-mTOR, anti-
mTOR (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), anti-p-ERK, anti-ERK,
anti-FOXM1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, Santa Cruz, CA),
and anti--actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) and then incu-
bated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat antirabbit
or antimouse secondary antibody (Amersham, Uppsala,
Sweden). Immunodetection was performed with enhanced
chemiluminescence reagent solution (Amersham ECL) and
visualized by medical X-ray film.
Cell Proliferation and Focus Formation Assays
An XTT cell proliferation kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)
was used to measure cell viability according to the manu-
facturer's protocol. Three independent experiments were
performed in triplicate. For focus formation assay, approxi-
mately 1000 to 3000 cells were cultured in each well of a
6-well plate and treated with different drugs. After incuba-
tion at 37°C in an incubator for 2 weeks, colonies were
stained with crystal violet and counted.
Wound Healing and Matrigel Cell Migration and
Invasion Assays
For wound healing assays, an equal amount of cells was
grown as a monolayer to 90% confluence in a 6-well plate.
The cells were pretreated with 10 µg/mL mitomycin C for 2
hours, and a wound was then scratched with a sterile 200 µL
pipette tip in each well. After washing each well with phos-
phate buffered saline (PBS), cells were treated with drugs
and incubated at 37°C in a humidified, 5% CO
2
atmosphere.
The width of each wound was monitored at specific time
intervals, with the relative velocity of cell migration being
calculated by dividing the width over time.
For Matrigel cell migration and invasion assays
(Millipore), 300 µL of cell suspension containing 1 × 106
cells/mL in serum-free medium was added to each insert.
The medium (500 µL) containing 10% fetal bovine serum
was added to the lower chamber as a chemoattractant. After
1 to 2 days, the migrated cells were stained and counted by
microscopy.
Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting
Cell cycle analysis was carried out to elucidate cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis induced by AMPK activator or BME
by means of propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry.
Ovarian cancer cells were initially suspended in serum-free
medium and subsequently seeded into 6-well plates at a
density of 0.5 × 106 viable cells per well. The cells were
incubated overnight at 37°C in an incubator with a humidi-
fied atmosphere of 5% CO
2
and 95% air. The full medium
together with either AMPK activator or BME was applied
to the cells on the next day, and the plates were incubated
overnight as before. Cell pellets were collected by centrifu-
gation at 1500g for 5 minutes and fixed in cold 70% etha-
nol. The cells were analyzed by a flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences), and the number of cells in each phase of the
cell cycle was quantified by Modfit software.

In Vivo Tumorigenicity Assay
To study the in vivo consequences of BME on tumor devel-
opment, 1 × 106 ovarian cancer cells ES2 were implanted
subcutaneously into the right flank of 5-week old BALB/
cAnN-nu female nude mice in groups of 5. Intraperitoneal
administration of BME was, therefore, started to pretreat
the mice for 2 days, and afterward cisplatin treatment was
initiated every other day for a total of 6 injections. Treatment
with BME was continued during cisplatin treatment. For
the control group, PBS was injected intraperitoneally at the
same times. The sizes of tumors were determined at the
time of each injection utilizing a digital slide caliper and
were evaluated using the following formula: Volume =
[(Width + Length) ÷ 2]3 × /6. All experimental procedures
described in this report were submitted to and approved by
The Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching and
Research (CULATR number: 2560-11) of the University of
Hong Kong.
Data Analysis
The Student t test was used to analyze parametric data,
whereas the Mann-Whitney test was used for nonparamet-
ric data. A P value .05 was considered significant.
Results
BME Specifically Inhibits Ovarian Cancer Cell
Growth
Given that a known AMPK activator such as metformin
mediated growth inhibitory effects on human ovarian can-
cer cells (Supplementary Figure S2A, available at http://ict.
sagepub.com/supplemental), we examined whether a poten-
tial natural AMPK activator, BME, could mediate the same
effect. Several human ovarian cancer cell lines were treated
with different dilutions (0%, 0.25%, 0.5, and 1%, v/v) of
Chinese BME, so that the majority of the cells could main-
tain appropriate viability and their respective proliferation
rates could be measured by XTT cell proliferation assay for
5 days. After BME treatment, growth of A2780cp (P  .05),
A2780s (P  .05), C13* (P < .05), and OV2008 (P  .05)
cells was significantly inhibited from 20% to 87% com-
pared with controls, but there was no significant effect on
the proliferation of immortalized human ovarian surface
epithelial (HOSE 17-1) cells (Figure 1A). In addition, focus
formation assays showed that the number of colonies was
markedly reduced by 30% and 70% in A2780cp and C13*
cells, respectively, whereas there was no effect using
HOSE17-1 cells (Figure 1B). These results show that BME
functions similarly to a known pharmacological activator of
AMPK in attenuating cell growth of human ovarian cancer
cells while having no cytotoxic effects on normal ovarian
epithelial cells.
BME Induces Cell Growth Arrest and Apoptosis
in Ovarian Cancer Cells
Because long-term inhibitory effects of BME on cell viabil-
ity of human ovarian carcinoma cells were observed, we
examined whether it modulates cell cycle progression and
induces apoptotic cell death in a manner similar to known
pharmacological activators of AMPK (Supplementary
Figure S2B). Similar to metformin, treatment for 24 hours
with 10% (v/v) Chinese BME of the ovarian cancer cell line
A2780cp yielded a small but significant increase in cells
arrested in the G1 phase and a decrease in cells in the S
phase compared with untreated controls (Figure 1C). On the
other hand, apoptotic cell death ofA2780cp cells after BME
treatment was also elevated, as indicated by the 40%
increase in the sub-G1 cell content compared with untreated
controls (Figure 1C). Furthermore, Western blot analysis
demonstrated that treatment with 5% or 10% (v/v) Chinese
BME increased cleavage of PARP and caspase 3, both
markers of apoptosis, in both C13* and OV2008 cells
(Figure 1D). Additionally, 5% or 10% (v/v) Chinese BME
enhanced the phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK, c-Jun, p38,
MAPKAPK-2, and HSP27 in C13* and OV2008 cells, sug-
gesting that BME induced apoptosis in human ovarian can-
cer cells via intrinsic apoptotic mechanisms.
BME Inhibits Migration and Invasion of Ovarian
Cancer Cells
Previous studies have reported that activation of AMPK by
AICAR or metformin not only inhibits cell proliferation but
also retards cell migration,30,31 which might further enhance
its capacity for tumor suppression. Thus, it was of interest
to determine whether BME impaired migration and inva-
sion of human ovarian cancer cells. In this study, the ovar-
ian cancer cell line SKOV3, a higher migratory cell line,
was subjected to BME treatment. Wound healing assays
showed that the wound closure rate of SKOV3 cells was
significantly slowed by BME in a concentration-dependent
manner, yielding 40% to 50% reduction of cell migration on
treatment with 5% and 10% (v/v) Chinese BME (Figure 2A).
In addition, transwell cell migration assays showed that
around 50% reduction in cell migration of SKOV3 cells was
caused by 5% or 10% (v/v) Chinese BME treatment, com-
pared with untreated controls (Figure 2B). Moreover, tran-
swell invasion assays showed that the number of cells that
invaded through the matrigel was reduced by ~60% in
SKOV3 cells treated with 10% BME (Figure 2C).
BME Inhibits Tumor Growth of Ovarian Cancer
Cells In Vivo
We next determined whether BME could impair tumor
growth in a mouse xenograft tumor model. An interesting
380 Integrative Cancer Therapies 15(3)
finding from a recent study was that Thai bitter ground
fruits contained monofunctional phase II enzyme inducers
that stimulated phase II enzymes and inhibited mono-oxy-
genase in rat liver, whereas a Chinese variety only contained
bioactive compounds capable of affecting mono-oxygenase
in rats.32 Given the diverse effects exerted by different vari-
eties of bitter melon, different varieties of BME may also
have differing efficacies in inhibiting ovarian tumor growth.
In this study, a highly metastatic ovarian cancer cell line,
ES2, was inoculated subcutaneously into female nude mice,
and when a palpable tumor was formed, 10% (v/v) BME
from bitter melon of Taiwanese or Chinese varieties was
administered intraperitoneally every 2 days, with a total of 6
injections. As shown in Figure 3A, Taiwanese and Chinese
BME significantly suppressed tumor growth by 1.4- to
2-fold, respectively, compared with the PBS-treated con-
trols. The tumor weights displayed 40% to 70% reductions
on day 12 in the Taiwanese and Chinese BME-treated groups
(Figures 3B and 3C). These findings are consistent with our
in vitro tumor growth results and further support our notion
that different varieties of BME have strong suppressive
capacity in ovarian cancer tumor growth in vivo.
Different Varieties of Bitter Melon Have
Different Capacities to Sensitize Ovarian Cancer
Cells to Cisplatin/Taxol-Induced Cell Cytotoxicity
Despite the efficacy of platinum-based drugs such as cispla-
tin in killing cancer cells, development of cellular resistance
to these drugs causes obstacles in the clinical management
of the disease.33,34 Recent evidence has indicated that phar-
macological activators of AMPK such as metformin could
enhance cisplatin-induced cell cytotoxicity.35 Considering
the speculation that BME acts as a potential natural AMPK
activator that inhibits ovarian cancer cell growth, it was of
interest to explore whether BME could enhance cisplatin-
mediated cell cytotoxicity. In this study, two cisplatin-resis-
tant cell lines, A2780cp and C13*, were treated with
Chinese BME and cisplatin. Treatment with either 0.5% to

inhibition of cell proliferation in A2780cp (P  .05), A2780s (P  .05), C13* (P < .05), and OV2008 (P  .05) cells treated with
Chinese BME for 5 days was seen using XTT assays, whereas no inhibition was observed in HOSE cells. (B) Focus formation assay

hours, and Western blot analysis was performed to examine the effects on cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP, and phosphorylation of
SAPK/JNK, c-Jun, p38, MAPKAPK-2, and HSP27. Representative cropped blots are presented.

1% (v/v) BME was equivalent to a high dose of cisplatin (3
µg/mL) in suppressing the cell proliferation of A2780cp and
C13* cells, whereas cotreatment with BME and cisplatin
further enhanced cisplatin-mediated cell cytotoxicity by
~2-fold (Figure 4A). Next, the effect of BMEs from 2 other
varieties--that is, Taiwanese and Thai--on chemoresistance

that there was a marked retardation in wound closure rate of SKOV3 cells treated with 5% and 10% (v/v) Chinese BME compared
with untreated controls over a time course of 12 hours (*P  .001). The width of the wound is indicated by arrows in the
photographs; 3 independent experiments were performed. (B) Transwell migration assay showed that SKOV3 cells with Chinese BME
treatment (5% and 10%) exhibited a significant reduction in the number of cells penetrating through the membrane as compared with
untreated controls (*P  .001). (C) SKOV3 cells treated with Chinese BME (10%) showed less invaded cells through the matrigel as
compared with the control (*P = .0006). The numbers of migrated or invaded cells in 3 randomly chosen fields were counted for 3
independent experiments, and the normalized numerical data were presented in bar charts with error bars.
Figure 3. Bitter melon extract (BME) from different varieties of bitter melon displays significant antitumor effects in an ES2 xenograft
mouse tumor model. (A) ES2 cells were subcutaneously injected into the right flank of female nude mice. On the seventh day after
tumor cell injection, treatments with 10% (v/v) Taiwanese (TW) and Chinese BME (100 µL) were initiated and carried on every
other day, with a total of 6 injections. Treatment with 10% (v/v) TW (*P = .01) and Chinese BME (**P = .0007) in PBS resulted in a
slower rate of tumor growth as compared with PBS-treated controls. The tumor volume of each group was measured for 12 days
and expressed as the mean ± SEM from 5 mice. (B) Chinese and Taiwanese BME markedly diminished (28%-71%) tumor weight, when
compared with controls, on day 12. (C) Photographs illustrate that excised tumors from nude mice subcutaneously injected with
ovarian cancer cell lines ES2 exhibited tumor stasis after BME injection, as evidenced by the smaller tumor sizes.

was examined. Treated with a lower concentration of cispl-
atin (1.5 µg/mL), there was only a slight inhibition of cell
growth in both A2780cp and C13* (Figure 4B). However,
the cell growth of both cell lines was reduced by 18% to
30% on treatment with 1% (v/v) Taiwanese or Thai BME
(Figure 4B). Cotreatment with either Taiwanese or Thai
BME and cisplatin (1.5 µg/mL) further enhanced inhibition
of cell growth by 40% to 50% compared with cisplatin
alone, in both cell lines (Figure 4B). Interestingly, cotreat-
ment with 1% (v/v) Chinese BME and taxol (1 ng/mL) also
significantly inhibited A2780cp cell growth by 50%, com-
pared with either treatment alone (Figure 4C).
To further investigate whether BME enhanced cisplatin-
induced cell cytotoxicity against ovarian cancer cells in an
in vivo tumor model, ES2 tumor-bearing nude mice were
intraperitoneally injected with Chinese BME (2.5% and
10%, v/v) and cisplatin (3 µg/kg) every alternate day for 12
days. Consistent with the in vitro data, BME further reduced,
in a dose-dependent manner, cisplatin-mediated tumor
growth retardation by 25% to 50% compared with cisplatin
alone (Figure 4D).
BME Activates AMPK and Suppresses mTOR in
an AMP-Independent Manner via the CaMKK
Pathway
Many AMPK activators are secondary metabolites of plants
that act as inhibitors of mitochondrial function, in which
case AMPK activation is induced by increased cellular
ratios of AMP to ATP or ADP to ATP and is accompanied by
decreases in cellular oxygen uptake.36 We studied the mech-
anism of activation of AMPK by BME using isogenic
HEK293 cell lines expressing AMPK complexes contain-
ing either WT cells or RG cells. These were similar to cell
lines constructed previously,36 except that expression of the
Figure 4. BME synergistically enhanced cisplatin-mediated cell cytotoxicity of chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells. (A) XTT cell
proliferation assay demonstrated that the growth rates of A2780cp and C13* cells were significantly reduced after treatment with
BME. The growth inhibitory effect was more obvious when cells were treated with BME plus cisplatin, rather than cisplatin or BME
alone. (B) Different varieties of bitter melon--Taiwanese (TW) and Thailand (Thai)--when administered with cisplatin (1.5 µg/mL),
exerted similar synergistic growth inhibitory effects on the viability of the chemoresistant ovarian cancer cell lines, A2780cp and C13*.
(C) BME could synergistically enhance cell cytotoxicity of taxol (1 ng/mL) in chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells. (D) BME displayed
antitumor growth of an ES2 mouse xenograft tumor model. ES2 cells were inoculated subcutaneously in the right flank of female nude
mice. On the seventh day of tumor cell injection, BME and cisplatin (3 mg/kg body weight) were intraperitoneally injected into the
nude mice on alternate days for a total of 6 injections each. BME administration not only significantly reduced tumor growth but also
enhanced cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity, as evidenced by a smaller tumor size.
Yung et al 383
AMPK-2 was tetracycline inducible because we have
found that cells stably expressing the RG mutant are unsta-
ble and lose the mutant protein on repeated passaging
(Supplementary Figure S3, available at http://ict.sagepub.
com/supplemental). BME was similar to A23187 and
increased Thr172 phosphorylation on AMPK in both WT
and RG cells in a concentration- and time-dependent man-
ner (Figures 5A and 5B), indicating that BME activates
AMPK via an AMP-independent mechanism rather than by
increasing cellular AMP or ADP (Supplementary Figure S3).
AMPK can also be phosphorylated and activated in an Ca2+-
dependent and AMP-independent manner by CaMKK,37 so
we examined whether CaMKK is involved in BME-
mediated AMPK activation. Consistent with this, the cell-
permeable CaMKK inhibitor STO-609 completely blocked
Thr172 phosphorylation in response to the calcium ionophore
A23187 (positive control) as well as BME in both WT and RG
cells (Figure 5C). On the other hand, it is known that LKB1/
AMPK signaling is one of the most well-known upstream reg-
ulators of mTOR signaling.38 Previous findings from our labo-
ratory have shown that activation of AMPK by agents such as
metformin could inhibit ovarian cancer cell growth by repress-
ing the mTOR signaling pathway.35 As expected, Western blot-
ting revealed that treatment of the ovarian cancer cell lines

A2780cp, C13*, and OV2008 with 5% or 10% (v/v) Chinese
BME for 24 hours yielded a marked reduction in phosphory-
lation of both mTOR (Ser2448) and its downstream target
p70S6K (Ser371; Figure 5D). Collectively, these findings
demonstrate that BME induces AMPK activation via the
CaMKK pathway in anAMP-independent manner, whereas
the activated AMPK then impairs cell growth and ovarian
cancer cell metabolism, at least in part, via inhibition of
mTOR signaling.
BME Also Suppresses the AKT/ERK/FOXM1
Signaling Cascade
Our previous studies have shown that pharmacological
AMPK activators such as A23187, AICAR, and metformin
cause inhibition of human cervical cancer cell growth by
repressing AKT/FOXO3a/FOXM1 signaling.19 Similarly,
these AMPK activators, as well as hypoxia, not only acti-
vated AMPK but also inhibited expression of FOXM1 in
ovarian cancer cells (Supplementary Figure S4, available at
http://ict.sagepub.com/supplemental). To test whether BME
could mediate similar effects in human ovarian cancer cell
lines, A2780cp and C13* cells were treated with different
concentrations and varieties of BME. After treatment with
Chinese BME (1%, 5%, and 10%, v/v), the expression level
of FOXM1 and phosphorylation of AKT (Ser473) and ERK
decreased, whereas phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr172
was concomitantly elevated (Figure 6A). Similar effects
were observed in SKOV3 and OV2008 cells treated with
Thailand BME (2.5% and 5%, v/v; Figure 6B) or Taiwanese
BME (10%, v/v; Figure 6C). Additionally, qPCR analysis
demonstrated that the mRNA expression level of FOXM1 in
A2780cp, C13*, and OV2008 cells was markedly reduced
after treatment with BME (5%, v/v) for 10 hours (Figure
6D). To exclude off-target effects of AMPK activators, the
AMPK inhibitor compound C was applied. After treatment
with compound C (10 µM), the expression of p-AMPK
(Thr172) was significantly attenuated, whereas the expres-
sion of FOXM1 and phosphorylation of AKT (Ser473) and
ERK were moderately increased in A2780cp cells as com-
pared with the control (Figure 6E). Thus, AMPK activation
reduced the expression of FOXM1 at both the protein and
mRNA levels via the AKT/ERK signaling cascade. To fur-
ther demonstrate that BME causes growth inhibition of
ovarian cancer cells through activation of the AMPK sig-
naling pathway, the AMPK activity was specifically sup-
pressed by siRNA-mediated knockdown of AMPK. As
expected, knockdown of AMPK1 (dominant isoform;
Figure 6F) could significantly reduce the suppressive effect
of Chinese BME (1%, v/v) on ovarian cancer cell growth
(Figure 6G). It is important to note that the enhanced cancer
cell growth mediated by cotreatment of Chinese BME (1%,
v/v) and cisplatin (2 µg/mL) was remarkably reduced in
AMPK1 knockdown cells as compared with the scrambled
control in a cisplatin-resistant cell line, A2780cp (Figure
6G). Indeed, Western blot analysis confirmed that there was
no reduction in the expression of FOXM1 and phosphoryla-
tion of AKT (Ser473) and ERK in A2780cp cells with
AMPK1 knockdown cells after treatment with 10% (v/v)
Chinese BME for 24 hours, as compared with the vector
control (Figure 6H). These findings support our notion that
activation of AMPK by natural AMPK activator BME sup-
presses the cell growth of ovarian cancer through suppress-
ing the AKT/ERK/FOXM1 signaling cascade.
Discussion
Bitter melon has been utilized as a hypoglycemic and anti-
diabetic agent in Chinese and Indian Ayurvedic traditional
medicine for hundreds of years.39 Emerging evidence has
suggested that many other dietary phytochemicals, such as
resveratrol and curcumin have anticancer effects by target-
ing cancer cell metabolism,29,40 and the antitumor activity
of bitter melon has recently begun to attract attention.41 For
instance, the crude extract from the fruits of bitter melon
induced cell cycle arrest and promoted apoptosis in adre-
nocortical cancer cells NCI H295R42 and breast cancer
cells MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231.29 Additionally, leaf
BMEs had been documented to impede the proliferation of
rat prostate cancer cells PLS10.43 These results suggest that
BME not only has the ability to reduce cancer progression,
but also has the potential to prevent ovarian cancer devel-
opment. In this study, we confirmed the capacity of BME
to suppress proliferation, migration, and invasion of ovar-
ian cancer cells. Notably, BME showed no obvious toxicity
in normal ovarian epithelial cells (HOSEs) or nude mice
but enhanced the cytotoxicity of cisplatin in ovarian cancer
cells, both in vitro and in vivo. It is important to note that
our mechanistic studies are the first to show that BME dif-
fers from other xenobiotic AMPK activators, in that it acti-
vates AMPK in an AMP-independent manner through
CaMKK signaling. Such BME-mediated AMPK activa-
tion significantly inhibits ovarian cancer cell growth by
repressing both mTOR/P70S6K and AKT/ERK/FOXM1
cascades.
We and others have previously reported that pharmaco-
logical AMPK activators such as metformin impair cell pro-
liferation of various human cancers.18,19,44 In this study, we
demonstrated that BME functions as a natural AMPK acti-
vator and executes both cytostatic and cytotoxic effects on
ovarian cancer cells while not being toxic in normal immor-
talized ovarian epithelial cells (HOSEs) or nude mice (data
not shown). Similar to metformin, BME induces cell cycle
arrest and promotes apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells, caus-
ing arrest at the G0/G1 phase and increasing the sub-G1
population of apoptotic cells. Induction of apoptosis was
also revealed by elevated expression of other apoptotic
markers, such as cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP.

Tumor metastasis and invasiveness are two very chal-
lenging issues for ovarian cancer patients. To address the
functional role of BME in ovarian cancer metastasis, we
examined its effect on ovarian cancer cell motility. Our find-
ings clearly demonstrate that BME markedly suppresses cell
migration and the invasive properties of ovarian cancer cells,
suggesting that BME may possess not only antitumor but
also antimetastatic function in ovarian cancer.
The differing abilities among the varieties of BME in
suppressing ovarian cancer cell tumorigenicity and chemo-
resistance are another interesting finding in this study.
Kusamran et al32 have recently reported that Thai bitter
melon contains more bioactive substances than the Chinese
variety that inhibit some mono-oxygenases, displaying che-
mopreventive potential, indicating that the presence of anti-
tumorigenic substances in BME may vary among different
varieties. Indeed, numerous reports have documented that
bitter melon contains many bioactive substances, nutrients,
and phytochemicals, such as crude protein, minerals, and
flavonoids, in leaves from different varieties and at different
stages of maturity.45 Hence, its ability to activate AMPK as
well its antitumor activity may vary. Thus, cucurbitane-type
triterpenoids,46 kuguaglycoside C,47 MAP30,41 and kugua-
cin J48 from bitter melon have all been shown to exhibit
antitumor effects on various human cancer cells. It is impor-
tant to note that recent studies have documented that triter-
penoids (BMTs) such as BMT1 and BMT17 derived from
BME possess the capacity for activation of AMPK.9,49 An
aglycone form of cucurbitane triterpenoid, cucurbitacin E,
has been reported to induce autophagy in human cancer
cells through upregulating AMPK activity.50 Moreover,
other triterpenoids such as momordicine I, momordicine II,
kuguaglycoside G, and cucurbitacin I in bitter melon juice
have also showed antitumorigenic effects on pancreatic car-
cinoma through activation of the AMPK pathway.51 These
studies suggest that there are potential bioactive substances
in BME used as AMPK activators in antitumor application.
Many conventional AMPK activators such as metfor-
min, berberine, resveratrol, and rosiglitazone are secondary
plant metabolites or xenobiotics activating AMPK by sup-
pressing mitochondrial function and thus increasing cellular
AMP to ADP and ADP to ATP ratios.52,53 In contrast, we are
the first to demonstrate that BME activates AMPK in an
AMP-independent manner because it triggered Thr172
phosphorylation equally in HEK293 cells stably, overex-
pressing either WT cells or RG cells.52 Interestingly, fre-
quent mutations and deletions of LKB1 are found in human
cancers,54-56 and our previous study demonstrated that loss
of LKB1 reduced the efficacy of AMP- and LKB1-
dependent activators such as AICAR in inhibiting tumor cell
growth.57 However, CaMKK provides an alternative pathway
to activate AMPK in an LKB1-independent manner.58 Using
the WT and RG HEK293 cells, we provide convincing evi-
dence that BME activates AMPK via CaMKK-dependent
signaling only; this has not been reported thus far. Recent
evidence has shown that CaMKK is highly expressed and
maybe used as a promising target for human cancers.59-61
This may provide an advantage, in that BME will activate
AMPK and suppress the mTOR signaling cascade even in
tumor cells lacking LKB1. Furthermore, CaMKK is
known to be expressed in host cells important in ovarian
cancer, such as adipocytes.62 Adipocytes in close proximity
to ovarian cancer cells are thought to provide the latter with
fatty acids, supporting the growth of the tumors.63,64 It is
possible that BME also activates AMPK in adipocytes,
which is known to inhibit lipolysis,65,66 and may, therefore,
deprive the tumor cells of nutrients derived from these
neighboring cells.
Accumulating evidence has shown that the upregulation
of FOXM1 is involved in the development of various
human cancers.67-71 It is known that the aberrant activation
of AKT and the increased expression of FOXM1 are
remarkably associated with chemoresistance of human can-
cers.72,73 Coincidently, we have recently reported that phar-
macological activators of AMPK are able to repress the cell
growth of cervical cancer by targeting FOXM1 in an AKT/
FOXO3a/FOXM1 signaling cascade.19 In this study, BME
has been shown to sensitize two cisplatin-resistant ovarian
cancer cell lines, A2780cp and C13*, to cisplatin-induced
cytotoxicity. In our previous study74 and the present one, we
clearly demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of cisplatin
resistance of ovarian cancer cells by BME is through the
AKT/FOXM1 signaling cascade. Moreover, our results
showed that activation of AMPK either by pharmacological
activators, by hypoxic stress, or by BME all not only reduce
mTOR expression but also FOXM1 expression by sup-
pressing the AKT/ERK signaling pathway, thereby impair-
ing growth and chemoresistance of ovarian cancer cells. It
is hoped that this targeted therapy may be able to overcome
the problem of chemoresistance in ovarian cancer.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that BME not only functions as a
potentialAMPK activator to prevent ovarian cancer progres-
sion and metastasis but could also be used as a supplement
to enhance the efficacy of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in
ovarian carcinoma. It is important to note that BME acts
through a mechanism different from that of other pharmaco-
logical activators of AMPK and appears to be nontoxic; it
may thus avoid side effects such as the lactic acidosis exhib-
ited by AMPK activators that act by inhibiting mitochon-
drial function, such as metformin and phenformin.
