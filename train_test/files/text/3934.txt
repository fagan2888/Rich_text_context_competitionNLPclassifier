Article
Modern computing has undergone several notable transitions
since its birth in the 1960s, with progress from mainframe
computing to minicomputers and then to client-server-driven
personal computing (PC). The PC era led the information
technology (IT) world to internet computing. Mobile com-
puting has supplanted internet computing because of the pro-
liferation of cloud-based applications and mobile devices
(such as smartphones, laptops, palmtops, and tablets). People
are able to experience high-quality computing at their palms
through cloud-based applications and mobile devices.
Workers bring their personal mobile devices to their work-
places. Mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets com-
bine portability and voice and data services to open up a wide
variety of potential mobile applications, "anytime and any-
where" (Disterer & Kleiner, 2013). People have started to
bring their mobile devices to their workplaces and connect to
their company networks to perform their jobs and connect to
various social network platforms such as Facebook and
BlackBerry Messenger (BBM).
Using personal mobile devices for work has given rise to
a trend called "Bring Your Own Devices" or BYOD
(Gheorghe & Neuhaus, 2013; Leavitt, 2013; Scarfo, 2012).
BYOD programs and policies empower people to choose the
best device to get their work done, including personally
owned consumer smartphones, tablets, and laptops (Citrix®,
2013). BYOD is an enterprise IT policy that encourages
employees to use their own devices to access sensitive cor-
porate data at work through the enterprise IT infrastructure
(Li, Peng, Huang, & Zou, 2013). Deloitte (2013) defined
BYOD as the use of employee-owned devices to access
enterprise content and the enterprise network. A BYOD pol-
icy not only allows employees access to enterprise data when
at the workplace but also allows them to access enterprise
data outside the enterprise environment.
In the next sections, we discuss BYOD prevalence, bene-
fits, challenges, and possible security attacks. We then review
existing work on BYOD by academic researchers. Our review
searches for peer-reviewed academic research publications,
white paper/survey publications, and publications by infor-
mation security experts by using The Universiti Putra
Malaysia online databases published in English language

A Review of Bring Your Own Device on
Security Issues

and Azizol Abdullah2
Abstract
Mobile computing has supplanted internet computing because of the proliferation of cloud-based applications and mobile
devices (such as smartphones, palmtops, and tablets). As a result of this, workers bring their mobile devices to the workplace
and use them for enterprise work. The policy of allowing the employees to work with their own personal mobile devices is
called Bring Your Own Devices (BYOD). In this article, we discuss BYOD's background, prevalence, benefits, challenges, and
possible security attacks. We then review contributions of academic researchers on BYOD. The Universiti Putra Malaysia
online databases (such as IEEE Xplore digital library, Elsevier, Springer, ACM digital library) were used to search for peer-
reviewed academic publications and other relevant publications on BYOD. The Google Scholar search engine was also used.
Our thorough review shows that security issues comprise the most significant challenge confronting BYOD policy and that
very little has been done to tackle this security challenge. It is our hope that this review will provide a theoretical background
for future research and enable researchers to identify researchable areas of BYOD.

search engine was also used.
Prevalence of BYOD
Although BYOD began to surface in 2003, it really took off
in 2011 (Leavitt, 2013). Growing pressure to enable and sup-
port the use of smartphones, tablets, and other personal
devices in the workplace means that ignoring the need to put
in place some form of BYOD policy is no longer an option
for today's businesses (Millard, 2013). According to a Cisco
(2012) survey, BYOD is a global phenomenon. Cisco carried
out this survey across eight countries in three regions (Latin
America, Asia, and Europe) including both enterprises
(1,000 or more employees) and midsize companies (500-999
employees). This survey was an expansion of an earlier con-
ducted survey in the United States that included 600 IT lead-
ers from 18 industries. Ovum's (2012) survey of 3,796
consumers in 17 countries in both emerging economies and
developed economies (Figure 1) revealed that 75% of users
in countries with emerging high-growth economies such as
Malaysia, Singapore, Brazil, India, and Russia use their own
mobile devices at work, whereas 44% of workers in coun-
tries with developed economies such as the United States,
United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, and Japan use their own
mobile devices at work. Gartner (2014) predicted that by
2018, 70% of mobile users will conduct all their work on
personal smart devices. These reports show that BYOD has
become prevalent in both emerging economies and devel-
oped countries.
Benefits and Challenges of BYOD
When employees have the flexibility to choose the best device
for their office work, they become more mobile and produc-
tive. The business benefits by having access to its employees
anytime, anyplace, blurring the work­leisure divide, and it may
save costs by having employees purchase their preferred device
rather than providing devices out of the corporate budget
(Mahesh & Hooter, 2013). AirWatch (2012) and Deloitte
(2013) identified some valuable benefits of BYOD. These ben-
efits are management flexibility, cost saving, maximized
employee contentment, and simplified IT infrastructure.
BYOD also provides a high level of convenience to employees.
There are published white papers about BYOD from corporate
organizations and information security experts that discuss the
benefits of BYOD. More details about the benefits of BYOD
can be found in Citrix® (2012, 2013), Deloitte (2013), Disterer
and Kleiner (2013), Edwards (2013), EY(2013), Hayes (2012),
Kerravala (2012), Miller, Voas, and Hurlburt (2012), and
Morrow (2012). However, if both the organizations and their
employees are to reap the benefits of BYOD, then they must
also worry about the challenges of BYOD policy.
Although businesses are mainly concerned with maintain-
ing security, employees are worried about preserving the con-
venience they need to work from their mobile devices, as well
as the privacy they expect regarding the personal information
on the device (AirWatch, 2012). One of the biggest challenges
for organizations is that corporate data are being delivered to
devices that are not managed by the IT department. This has
security implications for data leakage, data theft, and

regulatory compliance (Morrow, 2012). Thielens (2013) noted
that the real BYOD challenge is security and that the real secu-
rity challenge is not actually about the devices, it is about con-
trolling access from the devices to the corporate data. The
security challenges associated with BYOD are a point of con-
cern for the captains and information security officers of enter-
prises. This challenge has also attracted the attention of
academic researchers. Alharthy and Shawkat (2013) claimed
that loss or theft of mobile devices is the biggest risk that a
business could face by implementing BYOD because it leads
to loss of data to an unknown user. Thielens (2013) argued that
a secure and scalable BYOD strategy is required to manage the
risks introduced by employee-owned devices as a result of loss
of a mobile device, theft, or employee termination. A Forrester
(2012) survey of 202 respondents (Figure 2) with an under-
standing of the impact of the BYOD program on their business
unit or organization revealed that security concerns are among
the top challenges to implementing BYOD programs.
BYOD and Mobile Devices
Management (MDM) Applications
MDM applications are developed to address some of the
challenges associated with mobile devices (such as policy
management, software distribution, and inventory manage-
ment) that are not related to BYOD security. MDM function-
ality is similar to that of PC configuration life-cycle
management (PCCLM) tools; however, mobile-platform-
specific requirements are often also included in MDM suites.
More details on how MDM works can be found in MTI
Technology (2014). Many enterprises view most of the
MDM applications as a solution to the security challenges of
BYOD. However, MDM does not completely address the
security challenges of BYOD. MDM does not prevent a
hacker from attacking an employee's device or a thief from
stealing it and accessing sensitive data (Leavitt, 2013).
Gartner (2014) predicted that by 2016, 20% of enterprise
BYOD programs will fail due to deployment of highly
restrictive MDM measures.
Possible Threats of BYOD
A survey carried out by security vendor Trustwave revealed
that 90% of vulnerabilities common in desktop computers
were also present in mobile devices, regardless of the operat-
ing system (Leavitt, 2013). Literature shows that data leakage,
distributed denial of service (DDoS), and malware are the
most challenging security threats to BYOD (Morrow, 2012).

Data Leakage
Data leakage occurs as a result of access to enterprise data
anywhere and anytime by employees. An enterprise has little
or no control over corporate data because corporate data are
now stored and accessed by personal mobile devices of
employees. If an employee losses the device, the enterprise
data on the device will be available to any person who finds
the device. If the data available in the lost personal device are
confidential enterprise data, they can be made available pub-
licly by the person in the possession of the device.
DDoSs
A DDoS attack is a coordinated attack on the availability of
services of a given target system or network that is launched
indirectly through many compromised computing systems.
DDoS can deny regular employees from running machines
on computer networks or their own personal devices. Any
enterprise that is subjected to a DDoS attack will negatively
feel the impact on its server, and this will ultimately deny the
availability of the system to legitimate users.
Malware
Malware refers to malicious applications that can affect both
mobile devices and corporate applications. Mobile malware
include applications with code embedded within them that
compromise the security of a mobile device or related data.
When a device is compromised by malware, corporate confi-
dential data can be lost and corporate identities can be imper-
sonated by the attacker. In addition to compromising
individual devices, malware can also affect corporate appli-
cations, thereby rendering them unusable or non-functional.
Malicious applications normally take the form of normal
corporate applications that have been injected with malicious
code. In addition, malicious applications can be encountered
when a user visits a compromised site. More details on how
malware affects BYOD can be found in MTI Technology
(2014). Table 1 summarizes causes and implications of com-
mon threats described above.
Researchers' Contributions on BYOD
Although BYOD began to surface in 2003, it really took off
in 2011 (Leavitt, 2013), and most of the studies on BYOD
were executed by consulting firms that mostly offered
descriptions of the phenomenon and normative advice for
executives (Björn et al., 2012). There are white papers pro-
viding frameworks under which BYOD can be deployed.
Some of these white papers identified the risk associated
with BYOD and provided non-technical (policy-based
solutions) solutions. EY (2013) presented a white paper
that divides the BYOD risk landscape into three areas.
These areas are securing mobile devices, addressing appli-
cation risk, and managing mobile environment. The paper
offered non-technical solutions to these risks and concluded
by presenting eight steps to secure and improve BYOD pro-
grams. The Deloitte (2013) research report comprises an
effort to formulate an evidence-based commentary on the
state of BYOD in the United Kingdom. The report attempts
to cut through confusion and offer pragmatic advice incor-
porating a broad range of management perspectives from
IT to risk management, tax, and talent. Another survey of

more than 500 IT professionals aimed to understand and
address risk-associated BYOD was carried out by Johnson
(2012). The intent of this non-scientific survey was to
determine the type of mobile device usage allowed for
enterprise applications and what level of policies and con-
trols enterprises have around this type of usage. Denman
(2012), Mansfield-Devine (2012), Miller et al. (2012),
Morrow (2012), Potts (2012), Thomson (2012), Edwards
(2013), Leavitt (2013), Thielens (2013), and Tokuyoshi
(2013) presented their expert opinions on BYOD security
issues and advice on how organizations can handle this
security challenge administratively. They identify data
security, malware, and BYOD network security as the main
security challenges.
However, the literature shows that security issues in
BYOD are a major concern for academic researchers.
Niehaves, Koffer, Ortbatch, and Katschewitz (2012) claimed
that from an information system research perspective, a rig-
orous application of methods and theory to help practitioners
understand the phenomenon of IT consumerization in gen-
eral, and its implications for employee performance in par-
ticular, remain lacking. However, tremendous efforts were
made in terms of research on mobile device security, though
prior to workers owning mobile devices as tools for the
workplace. Different platforms call for different security
measures. Moreover, most vendors do not design smart-
phones primarily for businesses but rather for consumers
who will use their phones as personal devices (Grover, 2013).
The security mechanisms offered by most popular mobile
operating systems offer only limited protection to the threats
posed by malicious applications that may be inadvertently
installed by the users, and therefore, they do not meet the
security standards required in corporate environments
(Armando, Costa, & Merlo, 2013). Polla, Martinelli, and
Sgandurra (2013) presented a survey on security for mobile
devices.
Gheorghe and Neuhaus (2013) aimed to design and evalu-
ate concrete privacy mechanisms called Privacy-Preserving
Accountability for personal Devices (PriPARD, pronounced
"prepared") for mobile devices used in a corporate environ-
ment. The aim was to protect user privacy within the corpo-
rate network and non-disclosure outside this network, and
the vision was to gather practical experience with trade-offs
between monitoring and privacy need, to help both mobile
device users and managers of corporate networks. PriPARD
does not examine the overall privacy of existing approaches
as perceived by the user of the device, but will look for ways
to allow employees to check what private information is
emitted and gathered when they work (Gheorghe & Neuhaus,
2013). Werthmann, Hund, and Davi (2013) addressed the
open problem of preventing (not only detecting) privacy
leaks and simultaneously strengthening security against run-
time attacks on iOS. They present the design and implemen-
tation of PSiOS, a tool that features a novel policy
enforcement framework for iOS.
Li et al. (2013) identified a number of issues using a
straightforward approach of checking BYOD smartphones
periodically to prevent security breaches. These issues
include the following: running constantly scanning anti-
malware software on smartphones is power consuming and
checking all the smartphones is inconvenient for both the
employees and the employer. They propose a carefully
planned but otherwise random sampling approach called
strategic sampling to address these problems. The contribu-
tions of their work are three-fold. They identify threats to
enterprise network security based on the unique characteris-
tics of smartphones, introduce a method to measure smart-
phone security representative in an enterprise network based
on the owner's interests and the co-location logs, and pro-
pose to use strategic sampling (probability of use derived
from a lottery tree that reflects the smartphones' representa-
tiveness) to address the BYOD smartphone security prob-
lem, which balances security responsiveness and cost
effectiveness. The work of Jaramillo, Newhook, and Smart
(2013) is also related to mobile device security in BYOD.
Their work discusses a framework that unifies numerous het-
erogeneous devices and their software ecosystems into a
single flexible platform for enterprise device management
and message dissemination. This framework provides a
foundation that considers the myriad security, connectivity,
and energy implications that are far different from those in a
classical enterprise system.
Titze, Stephanow, and Schutte (2013) presented an exten-
sible framework that allows companies to run automated
security checks tailored to their specific security require-
ments independent of application markets. Their framework
orchestrates different plug-in security services for checking
mobile devices for malware, misbehaving applications, and
configurations. In contrast to existing approaches, security
services with the framework are exchangeable and can be
configured according to user-specific security requirements
(Titze et al., 2013). Armando et al. (2013) described a secu-
rity framework for mobile devices that ensures that only
applications that comply with the organization security pol-
icy are installed on the registered devices. Their framework
consists of a security policy manager that mediates access to
the application store and an installer application that tells the
user which applications can be safely installed. This is done
by inferring behavioral models from applications and by
validating them against a security policy. Zhao and Osorio
(2012) presented a new mechanism to prevent the use of
smartphones for information leaking in corporate networks
through the use of static analysis taint tracking. This mecha-
nism is called "TrustDroidTM." TrustDroidTM is a static ana-
lyzer based on taint tracking that can be used to prevent
leakage of sensitive information by an un-trusted Android
smartphone. TrustDroidTM will perform static analysis to
determine if there is leakage of sensitive information, and if
the possibility of leakage exists, a warning of information
leakage is delivered to the user of the device. Kodeswaran,

Chakraborty, Sharma, Mukherjea, and Joshi (2013) described
a system that leverages sensors available on the phone as
well as on the enterprise infrastructure to identify business
data resident on the phone for further secure handling. They
proposed a distributed architecture that leverages the context
of the user for speculatively distinguishing enterprise data
from personal data. The goal is to understand whether a user
is engaged in enterprise or personal work by inferring her
context from a combination of phone and infrastructure
sensors.
Kim, Gong, Park, and Park (2013) in their work selected
major domestic and external websites that provide cloud,
VoIP, messenger, and email services and examined whether
data are encrypted or not for constructing a safe smart work
infrastructure. Wire shark was used as the inspection tool in
both wired/wireless environment, and they verified that both
wired and wireless environments had a very high encryption
rate of identity or passwords (average encryption rate =
85.5%), but that the encryption rate of data was relatively
low (average encryption rate = 27.8%). To mitigate the prob-
lem of security in the BYOD environment, Chung, Chung,
Escrig, Bai, and Endicott-Popovsky (2012) proposed a novel
distributed access control architecture called 2-Tier Access
Control (2TAC), which uses a double-layer access control
along with device security profiles, anti-virus or malware
scanners, and social networking. 2TAC architecture consists
of two individual and contained layers of security. A device
control tier is located on the device, and a cloud control tier
is located in the cloud. Peng, Li, Han, Zou, and Wu (2013)
believed that many existing BYOD security practices are
costly to implement and intrusive to employees, which to
some degree negates BYOD's perceived benefits. To address
this problem, they proposed prioritized defense deployment.
A concept and a distributed algorithm both named
T-dominance were proposed to capture the temporal-spatial
pattern in an enterprise environment. They identified a few
desirable properties of prioritized defense deployment and
analytically showed that T-dominance satisfied such
properties.
Kerravala (2012) claimed that BYOD requires new net-
work strategies. In this article, technical reasons why new
network strategies should be the way forward for BYOD
were identified. The challenges with current network archi-
tecture were mentioned vis-à-vis proposed changes to net-
work architecture. Scarfo (2012) presented a brief survey
about the emerging methods and models to approach the
BYOD phenomenon from the security point of view. The
security models around BYOD summarized in the brief sur-
vey come from two opposite approaches: hand-off devices
versus hand-on devices (Scarfo, 2012). Copeland and Crespi
(2012) proposed a method of translating enterprise business
objectives into service delivery policy rules in mobile broad-
band networks. This proposition enables the enterprise to
control their own session policies for BYOD user and apply
selective funding with prioritized service delivery. The
proposed Enterprise Business Context (eBC) policy process
uses internal corporate data to define session context attri-
butes, which are evaluated against business policies to pro-
duce an eBC profile.
The appendix presents the summary of contributions in
research, research area addressed, and author(s) of the
research. It is important to note that this summary is a result
of our search for only BYOD-related publications using dif-
ferent academic and professional journals such as the IEEE
Xplore digital library, Elsevier, Springer,ACM digital library
databases, and Google Scholar index journals.
Review Analysis and Discussion
With the prevalence of BYOD in both the developed and
emerging economics, there is no denying that BYOD is here
to stay. Gartner Inc. predicts that half of employers world-
wide will stop providing devices by 2017 and require
employees to bring their own (Leavitt, 2013). However, as
both the employees and employers enjoy the benefits of
BYOD, they must also worry about the security challenges
of BYOD policy. To address this challenge, there is a need
for both academic researchers and information security pro-
fessional to have a better understanding of both the theoreti-
cal and security challenges facing BYOD. This article
however presents theoretical background on and security
challenges of BYOD by reviewing different publications
from different domains of literature.
However, in searching for publications related to BYOD,
we used BYOD, BringYour Own Device, BYOD Challenges,
BYOD threats, BYOD challenges, and BYOD security
threats as keywords and phrases for our search. After thor-
ough searching with these keywords and phrases, we were
able to gather 51 publications related to BYOD. Figure 3
presents the percentage of publications obtained from differ-
ent domains of literature including ACM digital library,
Elsevier, IEEE Xplore digital library, Springer, white paper/
Olalere et al. 7
surveys from different IT vendors, and other Google Scholar
index journals.
Meanwhile, for the purpose of analysis, we divided all
papers into three categories. The first category is publications
from academic researchers, the second category is publica-
tions from information security experts, and the third cate-
gory is white papers/surveys publications from different IT
industries. It is important to note that in all three categories,
security has been identified as the most significant challenge
facing BYOD, as seen in Figure 4. Meanwhile, not much has
been done by academic researchers to address this security
challenge. Out of 15 publications that address security issues,
9 publications address the data leakage problem, 3 publica-
tions address security policy, 3 address malware, and none
address DDoSs. Considering the benefits and prevalence of
BYOD in both the developed and emerging economies, it is
expected that many academic researchers will be interested in
providing solutions to the security challenge.
Conclusion
We present a broad view of BYOD policy by providing a theo-
retical foundation, deployment level, benefits, challenges,
possible security attacks, and work done by researchers on
BYOD. We conduct an exhaustive review of the literature to
identify publications and their methodological approaches and
to identify topic areas of BYOD research. Our review shows
that security-related challenges are the most significant chal-
lenges facing BYOD. We believe this state-of-the-art review
on BYOD contributes to practice and research by providing
researchers with theoretical foundations and open issues in
BYOD research. Our future work will focus on the design of a
BYOD network access control system. We aim to design a
two-layer access control system. The first layer will use a two-
factor authentication technique to address the problem of
unauthorized access to enterprise resources. This layer will
serve as the authentication layer for mobile devices in BYOD
environment. The proposed two-factor authentication tech-
nique will use knowledge-based and biometrics-based authen-
tication techniques. The second layer will serve as a monitor
for mobile devices when connected to enterprise resources.
This layer will monitor behavior of mobile devices while con-
nected to the enterprise network. The layer will be based on a
trust model and Fuzzy logic concepts. Our overall future net-
work access control system will enable enterprise network
administrators to remotely control and monitor mobile devices
before and after connection to the enterprise network.

detecting) privacy leaks and simultaneously strengthening security
against runtime attacks on iOS. Design and implementation of PSiOS,
a tool that features a novel policy enforcement framework for iOS,
was presented.
16 Yang, Vlas, Yang, and
Vlas (2013)
Deployment issues Their study proposed the Risk Management Quintet as a model for
understanding the BYOD practice. The relationships between the
components of the Quintet, that is, technology adoption, control,
liabilities, user perception, and user behavior, were also examined in
the context of control mechanisms.

No. Author(s) Research area addressed Contribution to knowledge
17 Björn et al. (2012) Theoretical framework Their work presented a well-grounded theoretical perspective and also
answers the following research questions: What areas of information
systems are specifically affected by IT consumerization? What are
the advantages and disadvantages of IT consumerization from both
employee and organization perspectives? Which theories in the IS
context can increase our understanding of the relationship between
IT consumerization and employee (work) performance?

Bai, and Endicott-
Popovsky (2012)
Access control A novel architecture called 2TAC that uses double-layer access
control along with device security profile, anti-virus or malware
scanners, and social networking was proposed.
19 Copeland and Crespi
(2012)
Policy control They proposed a method of translating enterprise business objectives
into a service delivery policy rule in a mobile broadband network.
The proposed method enables enterprises to control their own
session policies for BYOD users and apply selective funding with
prioritized service delivery.
20 Kerravala (2012) BYOD network This work explained why BYOD requires new network strategies. The
author recommended the following for next-generation Wireless
Local Area Network (WLAN) strategy: IT leaders need to have a
laser focus on user experience, embrace consumer technologies and
BYOD, and be willing to accept change and develop new strategic
relationships.
21 Scarfo' (2012) Security The work presented a brief survey about the emerging methods and
models to approach the BYOD phenomenon from the security point
of view.
22 Singh (2012) Survey on deployment
level
The study involved a survey that determined the level of deployment
of BYOD in different sectors and industries. The study also depicted
the different threats that affected BYOD policy. The survey showed
that the application of BYOD policy would be lucrative for different
types of organizations.
23 Zhao and Osorio (2012) Security The paper presented a mechanism called "TrustDroidTM," which is
a static analyzer that utilizes taint tracking to prevent leakage of
sensitive information by an un-trusted Android Smartphone.
Note. BYOD = Bring Your Own Devices; 2TAC = 2-Tier Access Control; IT = information technology.
