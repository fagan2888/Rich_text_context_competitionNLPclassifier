Special Issue-Student Diversity
Introduction
Teaching of learners with diverse needs can be a challenge to
most of the teachers. However, inclusive education (IE) pol-
icy in South Africa requires all the teachers to be able to cater
for diversity in their respective classes. Of all the professions
that focus on the development of learners, teaching is
regarded as one of the most complex. It is not a "simple,
straightforward enterprise" (Snowman, McCowan, &
Biehler, 2009); therefore, when policies are changed,
demands on teachers are increased. In the light of this, the
various changes that have taken place in South Africa since
1994 can be seen as having added an unreasonable amount of
stress to teachers. One significant educational reform in the
21st century has been the movement toward IE. The White
Paper 6 policy, building an IE and training system
(Department of Education [DoE], 2001), requires that all
learners, irrespective of race, gender, language, class, reli-
gion, disability, HIV/AIDS status, and culture, have a right to
access education, and acknowledges that all children can
learn with support. However, many teachers in service have
not had the benefit of being trained to teach learners with
diverse needs and so often find it difficult (Phasha, Mahlo, &
Maseko, 2013). The aim of this article was to find out how
teachers cater for diversity in their respective classes when
they are required to implement IE. The study on which it is
based sought to investigate how teachers perceived their
roles on the inclusion of learners with diverse needs in the
Foundation Phase. The researcher argues that while some
teachers in service were not initially trained in IE, they
should still take their responsibility seriously and have a
more reasonable expectation as teachers.
Responsibilities of Teachers in the
Foundation Phase
The term Foundation Phase refers to Grades R to 3 and
includes learners from 6 to 9 years of age (DoE, 1997; White
Paper 5, Document Grades R-3). This is a 4-year phase, start-
ing with the reception year and running important learning
programs, notably Numeracy, Literacy, and Life Skills.
Davis (1994) affirms that during this phase, a learner devel-
ops in totality, that is, as a physical being who develops con-
trol over his or her gross and fine motor coordination, as a
psychosocial being who is able to control his or her emo-
tions, and as a cognitive being who is able to comprehend the
surrounding world. This is the phase in which the foundation

Teaching Learners With Diverse Needs
in the Foundation Phase in Gauteng
Province, South Africa
Dikeledi Mahlo1
Abstract
This qualitative study draws from Bronfenbrenner's ecological theory, which emphasizes interaction between the systems of
education. The study argues that if teachers are able to cater for diversity in their classes, the vision of inclusive education
will be realized. Inclusive education requires all learners with the diverse needs to be able to access education and succeed
in their schooling careers. Ten teachers who are teaching in the Foundation Phase were purposively selected to form part of
the study; data were collected through interviews, observations, and document analysis. Teachers indicated that large classes,
lack of parental support, training for teachers, and social problems of the learners were making the teaching of learners with
diverse needs challenging. This article focussed on the factors that are considered by teachers in the study as barriers to
catering of learners with diverse needs, concluding that if teachers are provided with support, more learners will be able to
sail through the system of education.

of learning is laid effectively, a critical time for promoting
interest in education and positive attitudes toward school
when self-concepts are developed. Joshua (2006) maintains
that if a child fails at this stage, he or she will be adversely
affected and may even drop out of the schooling system
before having had an opportunity to explore his or her learn-
ing potential. Gargiulo and Kilgo (2011) point out that early
childhood inclusion embodies the values, policies, and prac-
tices that support the right of every child to participate in a
broad range of activities.
Although IE is a priority in SouthAfrican schools, there are
factors in the system that affect the implementation as con-
ceived by the policy. It is against this background that the
researcher considers challenges at the different levels of the
education system when catering for learners with diverse
needs. Socioeconomic factors contribute to large classes, lack
of parental support, and other social problems. Learners are
faced with challenges that put them at risk of psychological,
social, and academic difficulties, and that cannot be dealt with
in isolation because they interact in a dynamic way. Therefore,
this article examines some of the factors at macro and meso
levels which affect the teachers and learners, as the school at
micro level is responsible for the policy implementation. With
the increasing extent of change in the educational reforms has
come greater inclusion of learners with diverse learning needs.
The teachers should identify learners experiencing barriers to
learning as early as possible within their phase and give neces-
sary support, observing them carefully in all the learning areas
so that necessary adaptations can be made.
One strategy in the development of a single IE system is
the Policy on Screening, Identification, Assessment and
Support (SIAS; DoE, 2014), which targets all learners in
urban and rural settings who need support, not only those
with disabilities, specifically those from the poorest commu-
nities in townships, informal settlements, or rural areas, as
they have previously suffered from the unavailability of and
lack of access to services (DoE, 2005). The policy provides
guidelines and information on the procedures in supporting
learners who experience barriers to learning, outlining the
role of teachers, especially in the Foundation Phase; parents;
managers; and support staff within a framework of a new
vision of how support should be organized. According to the
DoE (2005), teachers should identify learners who are in
need of enriched and support programs; require diagnostic
help in specific aspects of a learning program; have a learn-
ing barrier; are overaged; have a mismatch between home
language and the language of teaching, learning and assess-
ment; have physical disabilities, such as with vision, speech,
general health, hunger, and emotional stability due to harass-
ment or violence; do not attend school regularly; and/or
show signs of abuse or neglect.
The SIAS policy is thus clear on which learners could be
in need of support. It is affirmed that previously the respon-
sibility of assisting learners with barriers to learning lay with
specially qualified persons employed either by educational
support services or special schools. This implied that teach-
ers and schools did not view the assistance of learners expe-
riencing barriers to learning as their responsibility, but rather
their duty was only to identify and refer them to more spe-
cialized people.
It is evident that the teaching of learners with diverse
needs requires teachers with specific knowledge and skills to
enable them to identify and help learners, thus cultivating a
positive attitude and willingness to accept them in class and
assist them. It is evident that the teachers do not conceptual-
ize their roles clearly as the IE policy requires them to per-
form some duties to which they were not accustomed.
The White Paper 6 states that classroom teachers now
have a responsibility toward learners with diverse needs as
they are being educated in the ordinary classes.As Giangreco,
Carter, Doyle, and Suter (2010) acknowledge, support pro-
vided to classroom teachers is essential, and although class-
room teachers are not expected to have all the answers or
undertake the task of IE alone, they must realize that while
the foundational principles of teaching and learning do not
change, those principles may need to be applied differently
or used more systematically.
Singal (2010) maintains that even when children with dis-
abilities do attend the mainstream classrooms, the teachers
do not always regard them as their primary responsibility.
This is contrary to the guiding principle underpinning inclu-
sion, that regular schools should accommodate all learners
regardless of their physical, intellectual, sensory, emotional,
or other special needs (Forlin, 2008). They should, therefore,
have appropriate skills, and as such, the expectations on
teachers are greater, which then affects attitudes toward IE.
Teachers need to be reflective, critical thinkers if IE is to
be successful (Naicker, 2005) as they are the ones imple-
menting IE in the classrooms and without their support the
vision would not be a reality. It is important for teachers to
evaluate their level of professionalism and how they define
themselves as teachers. Korthagen (2004) identifies essential
questions that are important in developing a professional
identity, and the teachers need to answer questions such as
follows: Who am I? How do I see my role as a teacher? What
kind of a teacher do I want to be? By engaging in such dia-
logues, they may realize why they chose teaching as a pro-
fession among all the available ones, and do justice to the
learners. It is frustrating being in employment that one does
not like, and one, therefore, does not put maximum effort or
energy into it. Teachers need to be proud to be teachers, be
competent and be willing to make an extra effort. The inter-
action of the different levels in the education system has an
impact on the successful implementation of the policy, which
particularly requires teachers to cater for diversity.
Theoretical Framework
This articles draws on the ecological systems theory of Urie
Bronfenbrenner (1979), in which there is interaction between
Mahlo 3
an individual's development and systems within the general
social context. Regarded by Haihambo (2010) as an example
of a multidimensional model of human development, it pos-
its that there are layers or levels of interacting systems result-
ing in change, growth, and development, namely physical,
biological, psychological, social, and cultural. What happens
in one system affects and is affected by other systems (Swart
& Pettipher, 2005); thus, human behavior, experiences, and
actions cannot be understood if the contexts in which they
occur are not considered.
An individual is seen as part of the subsystems of society,
which are also interrelated. Bronfenbrenner identifies five
structures or environmental systems in which human beings
develop, and they are macro, exo, meso, micro, and chrono
systems. What happens in one system affects and is affected
by other systems (Swart & Pettipher, 2005), which implies
that human behavior, experiences, and actions cannot be
understood if the contexts in which they occur are not con-
sidered. This article focuses on the micro level, in this case
the school, on which the implementation of IE takes place
and teachers are required to cater for learners' diverse needs.
It encompasses the immediate environments in which an
individual develops, characterized by events closest to his or
her life, and involves continual face-to-face contact, with
each person reciprocally influencing the other (Swart &
Pettipher, 2005). In the new education system, the school is
supposed to become a caring environment in which learners
are accepted and treated equally with respect, regardless of
their different needs. Donald, Lazarus, and Lolwana (2009)
define the micro system as one in which learners are closely
involved in proximal interactions with other familiar people,
such as the family and school, and it involves daily activities
that shape many aspects of cognitive, social, emotional,
moral, and spiritual development. As teachers at school level
are responsible for the implementation of IE policy, their atti-
tudes toward learners experiencing different barriers to
learning affect learners' academic careers. They need to
work together with stakeholders, such as parents, social
workers, and counselors, so that the effective implementa-
tion of IE can take place.
Teachers' Attitudes Toward IE
One of the most difficult challenges in preparing teachers to
work in diverse classrooms is that of ensuring that they have
a positive attitude toward learners with different backgrounds
and special educational needs (SEN), and that they are will-
ing participants in the inclusion movement (Forlin, 2010).
This suggests that if they do not have an understanding of
diversity, a positive attitude, and belief in inclusion, they
cannot be expected to embrace such a philosophy. Florian
and Rouse (2010) maintain that most mainstream teachers do
not believe that they have the skills or knowledge to teach
learners with learning barriers because they have not taken a
specialist course. They believe there are experts "out there"
to teach those learners on a one-to-one basis, and therefore,
teaching them is not their responsibility. This type of think-
ing becomes a barrier to IE, as developing effective inclusive
practices is not only about extending teachers' knowledge
but also about encouraging them to do things differently and
getting them to reconsider their attitudes and beliefs about
children with barriers and schooling. According to Phasha
et al. (2013), teachers need to change their attitude toward
learners who experience barriers to learning.
Many attitude problems occur through human interaction
in the school community, which includes relations between
teachers, principal and teachers, teachers and learners, teach-
ers and parents, and between learners themselves. The rela-
tions between teachers are important not only in the context
of developing a healthy working environment but also as a
model for learners themselves (Engelbrecht & Green, 2001).
One of the challenges facing the implementation of IE is
"attitude," and that of the teacher is crucial to the promotion
of IE through catering for diversity. The challenge facing
many South African teachers is that they have not been
trained to cope with diversity of learners now entering
schools. It can be seen that teachers need reorientation, assis-
tance, and support as well as fundamental shifts in their con-
sciousness and attitudes (Phasha et al., 2013). Gordon Porter
maintains that teachers need to be helped to achieve positive
changes in attitudes toward new teaching methods and cir-
cumstances to achieve effective inclusion in schools (United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
[UNESCO], 2000).
The task of implementing education policies, including
White Paper 6, is performed at the provincial level, then fil-
ters down to the districts or regions, and finally to schools.
This provides an opportunity for the provincial staff to design
the implementation program and strategies in context.
Teachers are the main role-players in the school and are
expected to provide quality education for all learners, irre-
spective of religion, HIV/AIDS status, disability, language,
race, culture, gender, and belief. Unianu (2012) finds that the
teachers' attitudes toward IE could be formed and developed
in the context of an educational system that can provide some
specific conditions to have a good practice in this field.
However, in a study conducted by Nel et al. (2011), they con-
cluded that teachers have negative attitudes toward IE poli-
cies both in South Africa and Sweden.
It is then critical to recognize that inclusivity is complex, to
be seen not only as an issue of placing learners with diverse
needs and barriers into regular classes, but also as a model of
holistic development of modifying and adapting community
and teachers' attitude to enable all learners to fully engage
with the curriculum. Teachers have their own attitudes, ideas,
and beliefs about what they consider to be right when it comes
to inclusive practices, but they need to be accredited and con-
sidered important because if they are not well addressed, it is
not possible to have an inclusive society that incorporates
diversity in schools. Of particular significance are the attitudes
4 SAGE Open
and beliefs of teachers regarding inclusive educational prac-
tices as they are considered the most influential aspects of
determining the success of inclusion. As teachers, it is critical
that opportunities are provided for reflection of their attitudes,
personal beliefs, values, and expectations, while developing
the desire to become inclusive to seek out the skills. If teachers
have the good will and positive attitudes, they will seek the
skills to embrace diversity.
In a study in Australia of community attitudes towards IE,
according to Gilmore, Campbell, and Cuskelly (2003)
respondents stated that people felt uncomfortable when
interacting with individuals with disabilities, problematic
emotional behavior, and communication disorders. It was
believed that this was mainly due to their lack of knowledge
and understanding of diverse needs of individuals, and only
17% of the sample reported that they knew many of the
diverse types of disabilities or other learning challenges,
while 20% said they knew very little or had no knowledge at
all. This affirms the findings of the study by Gilmore et al.
(2003) on the general education teachers in the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) and their acceptance of the inclusion of stu-
dents with disabilities. The study revealed that teachers in
general in the UAE had less than encouraging attitudes
toward the inclusion of students with disabilities, which
allows and encourages the establishment of policies that
guarantee a student's right to be educated in regular class-
rooms. The above scholars affirm that if a country is aiming
to change its education system and push for inclusion, the
teachers'attitudes need to change. Gilmore et al. suggest that
accurate knowledge and positive but realistic expectations
are important for enhancing the acceptance of individuals
within schools and communities.
The practical implementation of IE in developing coun-
tries such as Uganda and Zambia is hampered by insufficient
teacher training, inadequate human and material resources,
large class sizes, and negative attitudes (Silupya, 2003).
Meanwhile, South African teachers are currently being
expected to make major changes in the way they understand
teaching and learning, especially in diverse classrooms.
Teachers may need support to focus on the positive rather
than the negative aspects of change (Engelbrecht, 1999), and
should be sensitive to their own attitudes and feelings about
inclusion.
In a number of studies in South Africa, the attitudes of
teachers toward educating learners with diverse challenges
to learning have been put through as a decisive factor in mak-
ing schools more inclusive. Engelbrecht, Swart, and Eloff
(2001) focused on the coping skills of educators who had
learners with Down's syndrome in inclusive classrooms,
finding that teachers experienced stress due to lack of sup-
port and inappropriate training for inclusive programs.
Bothma, Gravett, and Swart (2000) maintain that attitudes of
primary school teachers toward South African IE policy
were largely negative and could become a critical barrier to
successful implementation. Naicker (2003) asserts that
although inclusion seems to be well researched and estab-
lished in the developed world, it should not be regarded as
problem-free. Notably, children in the West who are in spe-
cial education classes are there because of poverty, language,
and inappropriate education practices.
Belknap, Roberts, and Nyewe (1997) discuss what could
be interpreted as samples of inclusive environments. They
acknowledge that students with disabilities are likely to place
higher demands on the teacher. Attitudes play an important
role, therefore, and when necessary, those transmitting edu-
cation should change from targeting a selected few to sup-
porting all students. It is evident that attitudes and support
cannot be separated, because if one has a negative attitude
toward learners with barriers, one cannot provide that sup-
port to the learners. In a similar vein, if one's attitude toward
IE is negative whatever effort is made to make IE a reality
will be shut down. If IE practices are promoted in schools,
negative attitudes and perceptions will fade, perhaps much
sooner than expected.
Method
A qualitative approach was used, and data were collected
through semistructured interviews; this allowed the
researcher to gain in-depth understanding of social realities
and derive a comprehensive portrait of a range human
endeavors, interactions, situations, and perceptions (Zollers,
Ramanathan, & Yu, 1999). A phenomenological design was
undertaken, as it is based on the theoretical point of view that
advocates the study of direct experiences taken at face value.
The researcher wished to hear the participants' point of view
about teaching learners with diverse needs in the Foundation
Phase. Following a purposive sampling method, a total of 10
Foundation Phase teachers were selected, an important crite-
rion being experience in their current position for at least 5
years, that is, since 2010, when their schools began imple-
menting IE. They should have thus accumulated relevant
experience about the topic studied. The researcher included
only those who were prepared to participate in research and
willing to share the information (Morse & Richards, 2002).
Data were collected by means of semistructured inter-
views, observations, and document analysis. Semistructured
interviews were used because they provided firsthand infor-
mation from the Foundation Phase teachers. According to
Denzin and Lincoln (2000), they provide the researcher with
an opportunity to ask individually tailored questions and do
not limit the field of enquiry. The researcher began with a
predetermined set of questions but allowed some latitude in
breadth of relevance. One-to-one interviews were conducted
after working hours, not exceeding 1 hr. Data were audio-
taped and independently transcribed.
The following questions were asked:
·
· What are your opinions about teaching learners with
diverse needs in the Foundation Phase?
Mahlo 5
·
· How do you experience the implementation of IE in
the Foundation Phase?
·
· Which factors are affecting the implementation of IE
in the Foundation Phase?
·
· What strategies are followed to cater for learner's
diverse needs in the Foundation Phase?
Observations of Foundation Phase teachers offering a les-
son to learners with diverse needs were made and field notes
taken. Observations were included because the researcher
wished to gather data from natural settings, that is, the
Foundation Phase classrooms. This entailed a systematic
noting and recording of events, behavior, and objects in a
social setting of the chosen study. The study necessitated a
nonparticipant observation wherein the researcher was an
observer but not interfering with the proceedings.
Documents analysis entails scrutiny of relevant docu-
ments, which can be a valuable source of information
(Henning, Van Rensburg, & Smit 2004) and gave the
researcher an idea of the current processes and strategies fol-
lowed to assist learners with diverse needs and experiencing
barriers to learning. Documents are also valuable sources for
supporting the findings made through other research meth-
ods such as interviews and observations (Best & Kahn,
2006). Document analysis included intervention programs
and registers of learners experiencing barriers.
Content analysis (Maree, 2013) was used, because the
researcher analyzed qualitative responses to interviews and
summarized the messages from documents to identify the
units of meaning relating to the topic. Audio-taped data were
listened to several times to gather emerging categories and
themes, and all the data were read, with large bodies of text
broken down into smaller meaningful units in the form of
sentences or individual words. It was perused several times
to get a sense of what it contained, and in the process, the
researcher wrote in the margins possible categories or inter-
pretation. Identification of themes was based on the assump-
tion that at that point it was easy to get a sense of what the
data meant. Finally, data were integrated and summarized.
Audio-taped data were listened to several times to gather
emerging categories. The following themes emerged from
the data.
Lack of Parental or Caregiver's Support
Teaching learners with diverse needs in inclusive settings
will be successful if there is a partnership between the home,
school, and the learner but due to socioeconomic status and
unemployment, most parents in South Africa leave the chil-
dren in the care of siblings or grandparents. Sometimes, it is
difficult for grandparents to take care of the well-being of the
children, especially when they are illiterate and cannot assist
with schoolwork. The majority of teachers felt that lack of
parental or caregiver support affects the implementation of
IE negatively, especially on catering for learners with diverse
needs. When teachers identify the needs of learners, they
sometimes need a parent to be part of the process. It becomes
a problem because even if they are called to the school, they
do not attend. If parents and caregivers are not involved in
activities of learners at school, learners' performance and
confidence in the classroom can suffer, causing a learner to
experience more barriers to learning, as affirmed by responses
on the following questions:
"What are your opinions about teaching learners with
diverse needs in the Foundation Phase?" Classroom teachers
mentioned parental support as the greatest challenge. As the
primary educators of their children and responsible for them
throughout life, parents have the most important and endur-
ing influence on their children's development (Winkler,
Modise, & Dawber, 2004, p. 25). However, classroom teach-
ers felt that parents were neglecting their responsibilities as
primary educators, leaving the responsibility to the class-
room teachers. This was clear from one teacher who said,
"Parents need to be taught how to parent their kids; you can-
not bring a child in this world and then ignore their responsi-
bility of taking care of that child." This was reiterated by
another classroom teacher: "If you call the parent to come
and discuss the problem of the learner with you, the parent
does not come, because they think you are going to tell them
that their child is going to fail." Echoing the sentiments was
another teacher, who said,
Parents are not supportive; they don't even come when you call
them to the school, there are some problems which you cannot
solve without the parents' consent, so the issue of inclusion
becomes irrelevant when we look at real practical issues.
Parents should be supportive of classroom teachers, espe-
cially in solving problems of learners who are experiencing
barriers to learning. If parents take the responsibility for their
children, the classroom teachers will also be encouraged to
support the learners because they know they also have the
parents' support.
Schools have to take responsibility for making parents
feel that they are accepted as partners in the education of
their children. As such, the learners' confidence and perfor-
mance in the classroom will improve because they realize
that even their parents and caregivers are interested in their
well-being. This was evident also during the documents
analysis, as the registers containing invitation letters to the
parents revealed that parents who were invited to the school
because their children were experiencing barriers to learning
did not attend. Teachers had several letters as evidence.
The above incidences and reports of teachers show that
parents were not supportive, and therefore, teachers felt help-
less and frustrated. During one observation session, when
checking the learners' books, the section which the parents
should sign after helping the children with homework was
not signed, regardless of the teacher's effort to indicate that
the parent should sign. Parents' and caregivers' involvement
6 SAGE Open
in school activities is regarded as the most important factor
in the education of learners, because when parents know
what is happening at the school they are able to support and
motivate learners to learn.
Large Classes
Regarding the classroom teachers' opinions on implementa-
tion of IE in the Foundation Phase, all indicated that large
class sizes were making it difficult, as evident in the follow-
ing statements: "I have too many learners in my class, when
do I find time to concentrate only on one learner who has a
problem?" The sentiments were echoed by this teacher:
It is not easy to implement this inclusion thing and cater for the
diverse needs of all learners, because, you can see how many
learners I am dealing with. This individual attention is not
possible with so many learners. We are trying to accommodate
the learners who are struggling, but there are too many learners
in class, so you end up doing only what you can.
The frustration of this teacher can be heard in the following
words: "We have too many learners in classes; I don't know
how they expect us to perform miracles with such big
classes." The statements above indicate that the classroom
teachers were frustrated by the large number of learners in
the classes and, therefore, found it difficult to attend to learn-
ers with diverse needs individually. Teaching and learning
will not take place as planned if there are too many learners
in the classroom.
The researcher observed that in most classes the teacher
was supposed to teach as many as 40 learners, and to affirm
this, the documents analyzed revealed that there were more
learners in the register for learners who had been identified
as experiencing barriers than the few not in the register. This
is a serious problem in most of the Foundation Phase classes
as it prevents the effective implementation of IE in the
Foundation Phase and therefore the diverse needs of learners
in class are not catered for.
Social Problems of Learners
Classroom teachers also indicated that they need help to deal
with different social problems of learners. Those who find
themselves in situations in which they are supposed to inter-
vene in social problems, such as abuse and/or violence, are
sometimes unable to assist because they do not know what to
do. As such, they are helpless and frustrated by the situation,
as made clear by one teacher: "Most of our learners experi-
ence different problems whereby parents always fight, and
the learner is always thinking about what was happening in
the house so they do not even hear what you are teaching in
class." The problem is intensified when classroom teachers
are not sure how to intervene, as clear in the words of this
teacher:
Yes, in some cases you find that the learner is bullying others,
you need to refer that learner to the counsellor. Learners who are
naughty stealing others possessions, then you will find that those
learners may not get love from home, so social worker or the
counsellor helps us there, because we don't know what to do in
such cases, actually we are clueless in catering for this learners.
From the statements above, one can conclude that the coun-
selors and social workers are mostly required to resolve
social problems that the classroom teachers are unable to
handle. During the observation session, the researcher real-
ized that the learners were mostly asleep during the lesson
and many did not have the proper school uniform or lunch
boxes. Most depended on the feeding scheme, which some-
times was not operating so they went hungry. To affirm this,
the registers of learners experiencing barriers to learning also
revealed that more experienced social problems than aca-
demic problems, and if not attended to it would be difficult to
help them succeed academically.
Training for Classroom Teachers
In responding to the question, "What strategies are followed
to cater for learners diverse needs in the Foundation Phase?"
most teachers indicated that they needed to be well trained in
how to deal with learners experiencing barriers to learning.
Literature reveals that, in inclusive classrooms, teachers
require diverse knowledge and skills (Borman & Rose,
2010). Most of those interviewed indicated that they needed
intensive training in IE so that they would be able to support
and cater for the diverse needs of learners in the classes.
They were frustrated by situations they were unable to han-
dle, such as abuse, and different cultures, languages, and
races. They reported that they wished to help them but they
not know how, as was evident in the following statement:
"Sometimes you find that you suspect a learner in your class
has been abused, how do you then talk to that learner?
Seriously you need skills to do that without offending the
learner." In addition, the classroom teacher mentioned only
having been trained once in IE and catering for learners with
diverse needs: "We went for training only once; we need
more training on this inclusive education so that we can
implement it correctly, for now what we are doing is just trial
and error." The statements above affirm that classroom
teachers do not have appropriate skills and knowledge to
implement IE or cater for learners with diverse needs. There
is a desperate need for more intensive training so that the
classroom teachers can be confident in supporting learners
with diverse needs in their classes. During observation les-
sons, it was clear that the teachers did not know how to inter-
vene when a learner was experiencing a problem. For
instance, if learners did not spell the word correctly, the
teachers asked them to repeat the correct word 20 times in
the book, but did not establish why the word was spelled
incorrectly the first time, whether there was something
Mahlo 7
wrong with the way learners were taught or how to pro-
nounce the word. This was also affirmed by the record in the
registers, as six teachers recorded that the learners had prob-
lems with spelling yet there was no evidence of how they
were dealing with that particular issue. When asked what
they did in such cases, they said they had not been taught
how to teach spelling or phonics so just let the learners repeat
the word that was wrongly spelled several times. There is an
urgent need for teachers to be trained in the areas mentioned
above if IE is to be implemented effectively, and assistance
provided to learners with diverse needs.
Discussion
It was noted that although Foundation Phase teachers are
having learners with different needs in their classes, there are
other factors that make catering for them problematic. All
teachers agreed that IE is an educational strategy that could
contribute to a democratic society because it embraces the
democratic values of equality, human rights, and recognition
of diversity. However, Foundation Phase teachers who
formed part of the study had their reservations regarding the
implementation thereof, believing it to be good on paper but
difficult to implement without adequate support. They fur-
ther mentioned that parents and caregivers could play an
important role in ensuring that they support the IE policy so
that learners with diverse needs can be catered for. Foundation
Phase teachers alluded to a number of opinions on imple-
menting IE but in particular indicated more support for
teachers so that they could help learners experiencing barri-
ers to learning and development. Conversely, as the
researcher argues, it is not beneficial to be educated in a
school in which there is little or no support. Findings from
this study revealed that lack of support has a significant
impact on the implementation of IE and catering for diverse
learners in the schools. IE requires schools to respond to the
diversity of learners and provide equal opportunities for all.
Many schools in South Africa are affected by overcrowd-
ing, and findings from this study revealed that teachers still
had around 40 learners in one classroom, rendering effective
learning and teaching difficult and implementation of a new
policy such as IE highly impractical. Teachers thus develop
negative attitudes toward the learner who experience barriers
to learning, and the large classes make it difficult for them to
identify learners who experience barriers to learning and pro-
vide them with the appropriate attention. The diversity of
learners in class makes the task of the teacher difficult to
achieve. The study further identified gaps that interfere with
the implementation of IE in the Foundation Phase as the
teachers do not know how to intervene when faced with
problems, as such learners who experience barriers to learn-
ing are not included in the teaching and learning and some
teachers do not know how to help them. Teachers indicated
that without support, the vision of IE would not be realized.
The findings reinforce Bronfenbrenner's theory that
underpins the study as the school is at the micro level of the
system of education, where the policies are practically imple-
mented and if careful consideration is not made at that level
regarding the implementation, it will affect all levels.
Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory explains the
direct and indirect influences on a child's life by referring to
the many levels of environment or contexts that influence a
person's development. A major challenge of the education
system is to understand the complexity of the influences,
interactions, and interrelationships between the individual
learner and multiple or other systems that are connected to
the learner (Swart & Pettipher, 2005). The learner does not
exist in isolation, and all the systems determine whether he
or she will be successful in an academic career, including the
system of education, teachers, the parents, and the school. If
all systems work together, all learners in schools, even those
experiencing barriers, will benefit.
Recommendations
The researcher recommends that integrating school activities
with community activities in catering for learners with
diverse needs is of the utmost importance. Traditionally,
leaders in the community are respected, and whatever they
say is listened to, irrespective of whether they are educated
or not. Foundation Phase teachers can form partnerships with
the community leaders who usually invite parents and guard-
ians to community meetings. There are also ministers, priests
in churches, and burial society chairpersons, who as leaders
can allocate a slot in their gatherings to talk about the impor-
tance of supporting school activities so that the teachers can
be supported in catering for learners with diverse needs.
It is, therefore, recommended that to minimize class sizes,
most activities should take place outside the classroom.
Learners in the Foundation Phase learn by playing, which
could be enhanced by employing assistant teachers to give
extended classroom support, especially to those experiencing
barriers to learning. Teachers could also group learners for
activities so that they also learn from each other. Regarding the
social problems experienced by learners, the researcher recom-
mends that the practice and use of available resources in the
community should be encouraged, such as home-based organi-
zations and those that offer voluntary counseling to vulnerable
children in the form of guidance as well as help in schoolwork
and general health. The DoE could also employ social workers
and counselors on a better salary package, as in the private sec-
tor, so that they can be attracted to work in schools and assist
learners who experience barriers to learning. More campaigns
on awareness of social problems that can affect the learners in
class are recommended because if the parents or the caregivers
know that the problem could affect the learner in future, they
should respond appropriately. Intensive training for Foundation
Phase teachers on the intervention strategies to cater for diverse
learners in their classes is recommended as most of the teachers
indicated that while they could identify the problems of the
8 SAGE Open
learner, they did not know how to intervene. The interaction of
all the stakeholders above affirms Bronfenbrenner's ecological
systems theory, which emphasizes the interaction between an
individual's development and the systems within the general
social context.
Conclusion
In this article, the researcher discussed Foundation Phase
teachers' roles and responsibilities in an inclusive classroom
and the factors that may be causing the barriers to the imple-
mentation of IE, thus making it difficult for them to cater for
diversity. Teachers feel overwhelmed by the responsibility
placed on them to teach and cater for diversity. While the
researcher acknowledged that South Africa has well-written
policies in place, such as on IE, their practical implementa-
tion will remain problematic if the factors highlighted in this
article are not considered. The researcher is particularly con-
cerned about the extent to which these factors are addressed
because that will determine whether the vision of imple-
menting IE will be realized.
