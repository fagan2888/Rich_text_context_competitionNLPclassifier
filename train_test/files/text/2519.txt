ABSTRACT
Background: This study aimed to investigate the additive effects of socioeconomic factors,
number of psychiatric disorders, and religiosity on suicidal ideation among Blacks, based on the
intersection of ethnicity and gender.
Methods: With a crosssectional design, data came from the National Survey of American
Life, 2001­2003, which included 3570 AfricanAmerican and 1621 Caribbean Black adults.
Sociodemographics, perceived religiosity, number of lifetime psychiatric disorders and lifetime suicidal
ideation were measured. Logistic regressions were fitted specific to groups based on the intersection
of gender and ethnicity, while socioeconomics, number of life time psychiatric disorders, and subjective
religiositywereindependentvariables,andlifetimeserioussuicidalideationwasthedependentvariable.
Results: Irrespective of ethnicity and gender, number of lifetime psychiatric disorders was a risk
factor for lifetime suicidal ideation (odds ratio [OR] ranging from 2.4 for Caribbean Black women
to 6.0 for Caribbean Black men). Only among AfricanAmerican men (OR = 0.8, 95% confidence
interval = 0.7­0.9), perceived religiosity had a residual protective effect against suicidal ideation
above and beyond number of lifetime psychiatric disorders. The direction of the effect of education
on suicidal ideating also varied based on the group.
Conclusions: Residual protective effect of subjective religiosity in the presence of psychiatric
disorders on suicidal ideation among Blacks depends on ethnicity and gender. AfricanAmerican
men with multiple psychiatric disorders and low religiosity are at very high risk for suicidal ideation.

INTRODUCTION
Demographic and socioeconomic factors,[13] psychiatric
disorders,[47] and low religiosity[812] all have separate
effects on suicidal ideation and behaviors. Low
socioeconomic status indicated by poverty, low education
level, single status, and unemployment increases the risk
of suicide.[13] The presence of psychiatric disorders also

increases the risk of suicidal ideation and behaviors.[47]
Individuals with low religious involvement are also at
high risk for suicide.[812]
Suicidal ideation and behaviors vary across ethnic
groups.[1316] Braun et al. argued that suicide variation
among ethnic groups may have roots in multiple
factors such as culture, life values, and sociohistorical
experiences.[17] Although racial and ethnic difference in
the epidemiology of suicide is known,[18] less is known
about ethnic differences in the effects of risk and
protective factors on suicide.[19,20] Thus, there is a need
to study racial and ethnic variations in vulnerability and
resilience to the effect of risk and protective factors such
as socio-economics, psychiatric disorders, and religiosity.
Possibly because of lower rates of suicide compared to
Whites, few studies have focused on risk and protective
factors of suicidality among Blacks.[21,22] Among Blacks
in the United States, number of lifetime psychiatric
disorders lowers the age of suicidal ideation while
subjective religiosity delays the initiation of suicidal
thoughts. Interestingly, the effect of psychiatric
disorders on the age of onset of suicidal ideation is
dose dependent, and the effect of multiple psychiatric
disorders on suicidal ideation is most pronounced
among those with low religiosity.[23] Among Blacks, low
education, residing in the Midwest, and having one or
more psychiatric disorders contribute to increase in risk
of suicidal attempts.[24]
Among Blacks, ethnicity changes the distribution of
suicidal behaviors, as AfricanAmericans may attempt
suicide more than Caribbean Blacks.[25] In 2011,
Taylor et al. studied differences in the association
between certain measures of religiosity and suicidality
among AfricanAmericans versus Caribbean Blacks.
For instance, among Caribbean Blacks, subjective
religiosity, looking to God for strength, and comfort and
guidance were protective against suicidal attempts and
ideation. These associations could not be found among
AfricanAmericans.[18]
This study aimed to investigate if the additive effects of
socioeconomic factors, number of psychiatric disorders,
and subjective religiosity on lifetime serious suicidal
ideation among Blacks vary based on the intersection of
ethnicity and gender.
METHODS
Study design and participants
Data came from the National Survey of American
Life (NSAL), which was conducted as a part of the
Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys, 2003.
The NSAL included 3570 AfricanAmerican and 1621
Caribbean Black adults. The study was funded by
National Institute of Mental Health.
AfricanAmericans were composed of individuals that
selfidentified as Black, but did not report Caribbean
ancestry. Individuals that selfidentified as Black were
considered Caribbean Blacks, if they met at least one
of the following criteria: (a) Being of West Indian or
Caribbean descent, (b) being from a Caribbean country,
or (c) having parents or grandparents that were born in a
Caribbean country.[26]
AfricanAmerican samples, being the largest portion
of NSAL, were selected from 48 neighboring states
and included households that contained at least one
Black adult. The Caribbean Black sample included
265 samples that were collected from households within
the core sample. The remaining samples were collected
from households within geographic areas that had a high
Caribbean population.[27] Caribbean Blacks were sampled
from residential areas that reflect the distribution of
the AfricanAmerican population and from additional
metropolitan areas where Caribbean Blacks composed
more than 10% of the population.[26]
Study instruments and variables assessment
Age, education level (less than high school, high school
graduate, some college, college graduate), marital status
(married, previously married, never married), and region
(Northeast, Midwest, South, and West Census regions)
were measured as controls. Ethnicity (AfricanAmerican
and Caribbean Black) and gender were moderators.
Subjective religiosity
Subjective religiosity is one of the dimensions of religious
involvement and is defined as the subjective perception
of and attitude toward religion.[28] It can be measured
by questions regarding the perceived importance of
religion, the role of religious beliefs in one's life, and
one's perception of being religious.[29] This dimension
is nonbehavioral, as opposed to organizational and
nonorganizational religiosity.[30,31] Measures of subjective
religiosity have been validated using structural equation
modeling procedures among Blacks.[30]
In this study, subjective religiosity was measured using two
items: (1) How religious are you? and (2) How spiritual
are you? Responses to the first question included: Not
religious at all, not too religious, fairly religious, and very
religious. Responses to the second question included:
Not spiritual at all, not too spiritual, fairly spiritual, and
very spiritual. The total score varied from 0 to 6 with a
higher score indicating higher subjective religiosity.

lifetime psychiatric disorders based on the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), Fourth
Edition. Psychiatric disorders were classified as: Mood
disorders (i.e., major depressive disorder, dysthymia,
bipolar I and II disorders); anxiety disorders (i.e., panic
disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, generalized anxiety
disorder, obsessivecompulsive disorder, posttraumatic
stress disorder); substance use disorders (i.e. alcohol
abuse, alcohol dependence, drug abuse, drug
dependence); disorders usually diagnosed in childhood
(i.e. separation anxiety disorder, oppositional defiant
disorder, conduct disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity
disorder), and eating disorders (i.e., anorexia nervosa,
bulimia nervosa, bingeeating disorder).[26]
Main outcome
Lifetime serious suicidal ideation was measured using the
following single item: Have you ever seriously thought
about suicide? Other questions related to suicide were
also asked but were not included in this analysis.[1820,24,25]
Statistical analysis
To handle the complex sampling design of the NSAL,
Stata 12.0 (StataCorp, TX, USA) was used for data
analysis. We estimated standard errors based on the Taylor
series linearization to account for the clustered nature of
the data. Subpopulation survey logistic regression was
used for all inferences. Multicollinearity between the
independent variables was ruled out.[32] Odds ratios (OR)
with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. ORs
larger than one indicated a positive association between
exposure and outcome. P < 0.05 were considered
significant. Missing data were not imputed.
RESULTS
Among Blacks, about 44.4% of the participants were
male with a mean age of 42.2 (SE = 0.49) years. From
all Blacks, 69.3% (95% CI = 67.2­71.3) did not meet
criteria for any lifetime psychiatric disorders, 21.8% (95%
CI = 20.2­23.4) met criteria for one psychiatric disorder
and 8.9% (95% CI = 7.6­10.1) met criteria for at least
two psychiatric disorders. 11.7% (95% CI = 10.1­13.4) of
all participants had seriously thought about suicide since
the mean age of 28.5 years (95% CI = 27.3­29.7).
Among AfricanAmerican men, perceived religiosity and
number of psychiatric disorders were associated with
lifetime suicidal ideation. In this group, age, education,
and country region were not associated with suicidal
ideation [Table 1].
Among AfricanAmerican women, age, education, and
number of psychiatric disorders were associated with
lifetime suicidal ideation. In this group, perceived
religiosity and country region were not associated with
lifetime suicidal ideation [Table 2].
Among Caribbean Black men, education, and number of
psychiatric disorders were associated with lifetime suicidal
ideation. In this group, age, perceived religiosity, and
country region were not associated with lifetime suicidal
ideation [Table 3].
Among Caribbean Black women, age, education, and
number of psychiatric disorders were associated with
lifetime suicidal ideation. In this group, perceived
religiosity and country region were not associated with
lifetime suicidal ideation [Table 4].
DISCUSSION
Our study showed that after adjustment for the effect
of socioeconomic status and number of lifetime
psychiatric disorders, subjective religiosity protected
AfricanAmerican men against serious suicidal thoughts.
Such an effect was not found among Caribbean Black
men or women or AfricanAmerican women.
After controlling the effect of type of psychiatric
disorders, Taylor et al. (2011) showed major differences
between AfricanAmericans and Caribbean Blacks for
the association between various domains of religiosity
and suicidal behaviors. Their study showed that some
indicators of religiosity were negatively associated with
suicidal ideation and attempt; however, there were also
positive associations between some aspects of religiosity
and suicidality among Caribbean Blacks. Authors
argued that there is a need for further qualitative and
quantitative research to understand reasons for the
differences in these associations across ethnic groups.[31]
In another study, AfricanAmericans and Caribbean
Blacks were shown to be very different in additive
effects of five psychiatric disorders on suicidal ideation.
Among AfricanAmericans, major depressive disorder,
posttraumatic stress disorder and alcohol abuse disorder
were associated with higher odds of suicidal thoughts,
while among Caribbean Blacks, major depressive disorder
and drug abuse disorder were associated with higher odds
of suicidal ideation.[33]
Based on the current study and also previous
studies,[1820,34] the additive effects of risk and protective
factors of suicidality of Blacks depend on their ethnicity.
Our study showed that religiosity is a protective factor
with differential effects that depend on the intersection
of ethnicity and gender. Although multiple psychiatric
disorders are always a risk factor, different types of
psychiatric disorders may contribute to the suicide of
AfricanAmericans and Caribbean Blacks. This finding
is beyond the previous knowledge on the main effects of
ethnicity on suicidal ideation among Blacks.[25]
Findings of the current study shed more light on
the complex link between race and ethnicity, gender,

socioeconomic status, psychiatric disorders, religiosity,
and suicidal behaviors. Assari had previously shown
that the effect of psychiatric disorders among Blacks
may be more pronounced among those who report low
subjective religiosity. Based on that study, number of
psychiatric disorders has a dosedependent effect on
suicidal ideation, with the highest number of comorbid
psychiatric disorders having a very strong cumulative
effect on suicidal ideation.[23]
Among Blacks, the effect of psychiatric disorders on the
age of suicidal ideation may be a doseresponse relation.[23]
Other studies have also confirmed the doseresponse in
the effect of number of psychiatric disorders and suicidal
behaviors.[3537] In a study by Kessler et al., number
of psychiatric disorders was the strongest predictor of
suicidal attempt in the population.[38] According to our
study, the effect of each additional psychiatric disorder
on suicidal ideation is highest for Caribbean Black men
(OR = 6.0) and lowest for Caribbean Black women
(OR = 2.4).
Although not all,[39] most studies[23,4042] have shown a
higher prevalence of suicidal ideation among women.[23]
Gender differences in suicidal thought have been partially
attributed to social norms and gender expectations.[43]
Compared to men, women report more suicidal thoughts
but do not act on thoughts (low suicidal attempt).[44]
Most studies, however, have focused on the main effects
of gender on suicidality,[4547] and our knowledge is very
limited on the moderating effect of intersection of gender
and ethnicity on factors that contribute to suicide.[48]
Gender differences in suicidality have not been explained
by differential exposure to the risk factors.[49] To test the
differential vulnerability hypothesis based on gender, a
Danish study compared 811 suicide cases with 79,871
controls and showed that unemployment, retirement,
being single and sickness absence from work were risk
factors for men, while having a young child was protective
for women. History of hospitalization due to psychiatric
disorder was the most strong suicide risk factor among
both genders. The magnitude of the association between
suicide and psychiatric admission status also differed
between genders.[49]
Based on our results, programs on screening, diagnosis,
prevention or treatment of suicidal ideation among
Blacks may benefit from tailoring based on ethnicity
and gender.[50] Although screening and treatment of
psychiatric disorders among Blacks seem crucial across
all gender and ethnic groups, AfricanAmerican men
may need additional evaluation if less religious. Suicidal
prevention programs may need to reach AfricanAmerican
men with multiple psychiatric disorders and low religiosity.
Universal diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric disorders
is, however, essential for all gender and ethnic groups of
Blacks.
In this study, groups based on the intersection of
ethnicity and gender were very different in additive
effects of known determinants of suicidal ideation. The
moderating effect of race, ethnicity, gender, social class,
and other contextual factors on the associations between
risk and protective factors and outcomes has been shown
for other risk factors and outcomes.[5162] We, however,
still do not know how contextual factors such as gender
and ethnicity modify the additive effects of a risk and
protective factor, even when separate effects of the same
risk and protective factors are constant.[34,51,52,57,58,63-65]
This study had a few limitations. Due to the
crosssectional design, causative associations are not
plausible. In addition, as this study relied on selfreports,
underreporting of suicidal ideation cannot be ruled out.
Moreover, ethnic and gender differences in the validity
of the measures of suicidality and religiosity are not
known. In addition, statistical power was not identical

in different groups of this study. Furthermore, we also
did not include any measure of behavioral religiosity.
Finally, Caribbean Blacks in this study were composed of
a heterogenic group based on nativity and time lived in
the USA.
CONCLUSIONS
Based on our findings, while the effect of number
of psychiatric disorders is constant across ethnic and
gender groups of Blacks, subjective religiosity may only
protect AfricanAmerican men against suicidal ideation.
Subjective religiosity may not have a protective effect
above and beyond number of psychiatric disorders
among AfricanAmerican women, or Caribbean Black
men or women. The direction of the association between
education level and suicidal ideation also vary based on
the intersection of ethnicity and gender.
