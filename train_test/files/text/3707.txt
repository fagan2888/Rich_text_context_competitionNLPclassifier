Abstract
Objective: To compare Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha Appendicitis (RIPASA) and Alvarado
scores with multislice computed tomography (MSCT) for diagnosing acute appendicitis (AA).
Methods: This retrospective study included patients with abdominal pain who had undergone
MSCT, and whose medical notes included RIPASA and Alvarado score parameters. MSCT was
compared with RIPASA and Alvarado scores for diagnosing AA.
Results: Of 297 patients included, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for diagnosing AA were
95.2%, 73.6% and 87.2% for RIPASA score (cutoff value 7.5) and 63.1%, 80.9% and 69.7% for
Alvarado score (cutoff value 7). Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of MSCT for diagnosing AA
were 98.9%, 96.4% and 98.0%, respectively. In terms of accuracy, statistically significant differences
were observed between RIPASA and Alvarado scores, and between MSCTand RIPASA scores. The
mean RIPASA score was significantly different in the simple AA group (9.7 Æ 2.2) compared with
other AA groups (10.5 Æ 1.7). No statistically significant difference was observed in RIPASA score
between nonperforated and perforated AA. MSCT sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for
diagnosing simple AA were 94.1%, 96.4% and 95.8%, respectively; for differentiating perforated and
nonperforated AA, scores were 90.2%, 95.2% and 94.1%, respectively.
Conclusion: MSCT is the optimum diagnostic tool for AA, followed by RIPASA score and
Alvarado score, particularly in diagnosing simple and perforated AA.

Introduction
Acute appendicitis (AA) is the most
common surgical abdominal emergency,
occurring in 7­12% of the general popula-
tion;1 its diagnosis is usually based on
clinical manifestations and laboratory tests.

An atypical type of AA accounts for
approximately 30% of cases,2,3 however,
and some other diseases resemble its clinical
manifestations.4­8 Thus, the correct ­ and
differential ­ diagnosis of AA is of great
importance in informing the choice of clin-
ical treatment.
The Alvarado scoring system, which is
based on specific findings observed in AA,
was developed to aid AA diagnosis and has
been shown to have good diagnostic valid-
ity.9­11 The Alvarado score is widely used in
the diagnosis of AA due to its convenience,
economy and avoidance of radiation expos-
ure, although studies have reported poor
diagnostic accuracy for AA when used in
women, children and the elderly.12,13
A new scoring system was therefore devel-
oped, the Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak
Saleha Appendicitis (RIPASA) score,14,15
which produced higher sensitivity and
specificity than the Alvarado score. The
value of RIPASA for discriminating differ-
ent stages of AA, however, has not been
investigated. Computed tomography (CT),
particularly multislice (MS)CT, is widely
performed and important in the diag-
nosis and differential diagnosis of AA
because of its higher accuracy than
ultrasonography.16,17
In the present retrospective cohort study,
medical records from patients with abdom-
inal pain were retrieved and MSCT scan
results, and RIPASA and Alvarado scores
were analysed to compare their value in
diagnosing AA.
Patients and methods
Study population and clinical data
This retrospective cohort study included
patients treated for abdominal pain between
June 2009 and June 2012 at Jinshan
Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai,
China.
The inclusion criteria comprised patients
with complete medical records (including
MSCT examination) and all parameters
required to calculate RIPASA and
Alvarado scores. The exclusion criteria
comprised children (<18 years old), preg-
nant female patients and patients who were
allergic to iodinated contrast material. Cases
of AA with appendectomy performed >24 h
following MSCT examination were also
excluded, to reduce the bias of AA stages.
For the diagnosis of AA, MSCT images, and
RIPASA and Alvarado scores, were evalu-
ated retrospectively from complete medical
notes.
The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board affiliated to
Jinshan Hospital, Fudan University,
Shanghai, China (approval No. 2008-34).
Since this was a retrospective cohort study,
informed consent was not required.
MSCT scan and image interpretation
Abdominal scans were performed using a
64-slice Somatom Sensation 64 MSCT scan-
ner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Lower
abdomen scans extended from the superior
border of the third lumbar to the pubic
symphysis, and whole abdomen scans
extended from the diaphragmatic dome to
the pubic symphysis. Unenhanced scans and
contrast-enhanced scans were performed,
and CT scanning parameters were as fol-
lows: tube voltage, 120 kV; tube current,
200 mA; collimation, 0.6 mm; reconstruc-
tion slice thickness, 1.0 mm; reconstruction
interval, 0.5 mm; pitch, 1. Patients suspected
of colonic tumour, or ureteral or pelvic
lesions, received 1500 ml of water (as nega-
tive contrast material), orally at 0.5, 1 and
1.5 h prior to scanning, to improve the
quality of image acquisition. Patients sus-
pected of requiring urgent surgery did not
receive oral contrast material, to avoid
delaying treatment. Patients who underwent
enhanced CT were administered 1­1.5 ml/kg
UltravistÕ 370 (370 mgIodine/ml, Bayer
Schering Pharma, Guangzhou, China),
342 Journal of International Medical Research 43(3)
intravenously (i.v.) at a rate of 3 ml/s.
Scanning commenced 60 s following the
initiation of i.v. injection.
The appendix was reconstructed using
multiplanar reformation and curved planar
reformation techniques. CT findings were
evaluated as follows: maximum appendiceal
diameter; maximum appendiceal wall thick-
ness; maximum depth of the intraluminal
appendiceal fluid; defect in enhancing
appendiceal wall; periappendiceal inflam-
mation; phlegmon or abscess; extraluminal
air; intraluminal and/or extraluminal
appendicolith.
Simple AA was diagnosed when max-
imum depth of the intraluminal appendiceal
fluid was >2.6 mm.18,19 Phlegmonous AA
was diagnosed when appendiceal diameter
was >6 mm with associated periappendiceal
inflammation.1,20,21 Perforated AA was
diagnosed when appendiceal diameter was
>6 mm with at least one of five specific CT
signs: defect in enhancing appendiceal wall,
phlegmon or abscess, extraluminal air,
extraluminal appendicolith.22,23 Images
were evaluated separately by two radiolo-
gists (J.W.Q., W.L.) with > 8 years' experi-
ence, who were blinded to the clinical score
results during the image evaluation period,
and who reached consensus following dis-
cussion when disagreement occurred. Mean
values were calculated for the two sets of
measurement data obtained by the two
radiologists.
Alvarado and RIPASA score
For all cases, Alvarado and RIPASA scores
were derived and calculated from complete
medical notes separately by two surgeons
(R.X.S., Y.Z.), each with >10 years' experi-
ence, based on criteria listed in Tables 1
and 2. 9,14,15 The two surgeons were blinded
to the CT diagnostic results during the score
evaluation period, and in the case of dis-
agreement, consensus was reached following
discussion.

Statistical analyses
Data are presented as mean Æ SD, n inci-
dence or %. Statistical analyses were per-
formed using StataÕ statistical software,
release 7.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station,
TX, USA). Based on cutoff values of 7.5 for
RIPASA and 7.0 for Alvarado scores,9,14,15
the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were
calculated for diagnosing AA. Differences in
the accuracy of RIPASA compared with
Alvarado scores in diagnosing AA were
assessed using 2-test. Differences in the
accuracy of RIPASA score for diagnosing
simple AA versus other types of AA, simple
AA versus phlegmonous AA, and perfo-
rated AA versus nonperforated AA were
analysed using Student's t-test. Sensitivity,
specificity and accuracy of MSCT for diag-
nosing simple AA and differentiating perfo-
rated from nonperforated AA were
calculated. Differences in accuracy,
sensitivity and specificity between MSCT
and RIPASA scores for diagnosing AA were
analysed using 2-test. A P value < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant. Cohen's
 coefficient was used to test inter-rater
agreement and a -value > 0.75 was con-
sidered good.
Results
A total of 297 patients with abdominal pain
were enrolled in this retrospective cohort
study (male, 158 cases; female, 139 cases; age
range, 19­87 years; mean age, 47.9 Æ 17.6
years). All cases were confirmed by path-
ology results and/or surgery. A total of 187
cases were confirmed as appendicitis, and
the range of diseases represented by this
patient cohort are shown in Table 3. All
patients included in this study underwent
MSCT scan prior to surgery.

Lower abdomen MSCT scans were per-
formed in 194 cases and whole abdomen
MSCT scans were performed in 103 cases.
Unenhanced scans were performed in 90
cases of phlegmonous appendicitis, and
unenhanced and contrast-enhanced scans
were performed in the remaining 207 cases.
Interobserver agreement between the two
radiologists who evaluated CT images was
very strong, with a -value, 0.96.
Interobserver agreement between the two

Discussion
In the current study of adults with abdom-
inal pain, cutoff values of 7.5 for the
RIPASA score and 7 for the Alvarado
score yielded sensitivity, specificity and
accuracy of 95.2%, 73.6% and 87.2%
(RIPASA), and 63.1%, 80.9% and 69.7%
(Alvarado), respectively, for diagnosing AA.
The RIPASA score had a significantly
higher diagnostic accuracy compared with
Alvarado score in the current study, and
concurred with the results of previous
reports,14,15 in which the diagnostic value
of RIPASA score was higher than that for
the Alvarado score for diagnosing AA. The
RIPASA score contains parameters such as
age and sex, which could increase the accur-
acy compared with Alvarado score, and the
RIPASA score also contains more param-
eters that could aid with the differential
diagnosis of AA. All 14 parameters of the
RIPASA score are easily obtained from
good clinical histories, examinations and
investigations, and RIPASA score is easy
to implement without additional costs.

Compared with the Alvarado score, there-
fore, the RIPASA score may be more
appropriate for the diagnosis of AA.
Computed tomography is thought to be
important in the diagnosis and differential
diagnosis of AA,3,16,17 however, no studies to
date directly compare the RIPASA score
with CT in the diagnosis of AA. In the
current study, the sensitivity, specificity and
accuracy of MSCT were significantly higher
than those of the RIPASA score for diagnos-
ing AA. There were statistically significant
differences in diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity
and specificity between MSCT and RIPASA
score, indicating that MSCT is an important
supplement to RIPASA score. This may be
because the RIPASA score lacks highly
specific parameters, and in many other dis-
eases (including inflammation of the caecum
and/or ascending colon, gastrointestinal per-
foration, and right ureter calculus), a few
abnormal parameters that are included in the
RIPASA score often develop.
The diagnostic value of the RIPASA
score has been documented as being higher
than the Alvarado score for AA,14,15 how-
ever no study has reported the diagnostic
value of the RIPASA score for different
types of AA. In the current study, the
RIPASA score for the simple AA group
was significantly lower than for other types
of AA grouped together, indicating that the
diagnostic value of this score for simple AA
was lower than for other types of AA
grouped together, based on the guidelines
for management according to RIPASA total
score. This may be explained by the fact that
simple AA had more atypical presentations
than other types of AA grouped together in
the current study and, therefore, RIPASA
score could not effectively address the prob-
lem of differentially diagnosing simple AA.
Comparable with published reports,18,19
the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of
MSCT for diagnosing simple AA were
94.1%, 96.4% and 95.8%, respectively,
indicating that MSCT is an important pro-
cedure for the diagnosis of simple AA.
Clinical management options for perfo-
rated AA are reported to be different from
those for nonperforated AA.22­24 The rou-
tine treatment of choice for perforated AA is
administration of antibiotics and/or drain-
age, with or without appendectomy 6­12
weeks following antibiotic treatment. In
patients with nonperforated AA, prompt
appendectomy is recommended to reduce
the risk of complications. Thus, differentiat-
ing perforated from nonperforated AA can
be critically important in order to select the
correct therapeutic approach. To date, no
study has reported the value of the RIPASA
score for differentiating perforated from
nonperforated AA, however. In the current
Figure 4. Representative multislice computed
tomography (MSCT) scan image showing perforated

score was 7 and Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha

study, there was no statistically significant
difference in the RIPASA score between the
nonperforated and perforated AA groups.
However, use of MSCT for differentiating
perforated from nonperforated AA revealed
a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of
90.2%, 95.2% and 94.1% respectively,
which were similar values to those reported
previously.22,23 These results indicate that
MSCT is superior compared with the
RIPASA score in the differential diagnosis
of perforated versus nonperforated AA.
The current study is limited by the fact
that it is a retrospective cohort study, how-
ever, sample cases with complete medical
notes are presented, which improves the
accuracy of the results, and provides evi-
dence that may guide the choice of clinical
pathway in the diagnosis of abdominal pain.
Cases of AA with appendectomy performed
>24 h following MSCT examination were
excluded, which may have biased the MSCT
results, however, this was done to avoid
inaccurate reporting of the stages of AA,
since some nonperforated AA may rapidly
progress to perforated AA after 24 h.23
In conclusion, the current study suggests
that MSCT is the optimum diagnostic tool
for AA compared with RIPASA and
Alvarado scores, particularly in cases of
simple and perforated AA. The study also
showed that the RIPASA score may be a
superior diagnostic scoring system com-
pared with the Alvarado score for AA,
which is important in hospitals where
MSCT scans are not readily available. A
prospective study of MSCT versus the
RIPASA score should be conducted, to
further confirm the superiority of MSCT
over RIPASA in terms of sensitivity, speci-
ficity and accuracy in the diagnosis and
differential diagnosis of AA.
