Early Menarche is Associated With
Preference for Masculine Male Faces
and Younger Preferred Age to Have
a First Child
Carlota Batres1 and David I. Perrett1
Abstract
One developmental factor that is associated with variation in reproductive strategy is pubertal timing. For instance, women who
experience earlier menarche have their first pregnancy earlier and prefer more masculinized male voices. Early menarche may also
lead to preferences for masculine faces, but no study has shown such a link. We therefore investigated the relationships between
pubertal timing, reproductive plans, sexual attitudes and behaviors, and masculinity preferences in nulliparous women aged 18­30
from the United Kingdom (N ¼ 10,793). We found that women who experienced earlier menarche reported a younger preferred
age to have a first child and showed stronger masculinity preferences. This provides evidence that women experiencing early
menarche not only have children earlier but notably plan to have children earlier. Additionally, our findings provide evidence that
age of menarche influences partner selection, which is instrumental for the implementation of reproductive strategies.

Introduction
Life history theory proposes that individuals face a trade-off
between effort spent on survival and effort spent on reproduc-
tion (Chisholm et al., 1993; Stearns, 1992). Moreover, within
reproductive effort, individuals must also balance mating and
parenting effort (Chisholm et al., 1993). Much research on life
history theory has focused on understanding how different
reproductive strategies influence an individual's reproductive
success. For example, some individuals may pursue a quanti-
tative reproductive strategy of having a greater number of chil-
dren with a relatively low level of investment in each, while
other individuals may pursue a qualitative reproductive strat-
egy of having fewer children with a relatively high level of
investment in each (Chisholm et al., 1993; Hoier, 2003). In
addition to quantity versus quality, speed is also a factor in
reproductive strategy. For instance, individuals who choose
to have children can exercise a ``fast and early'' or a ``slow
and late'' reproductive strategy (Draper & Harpending, 1982).
According to life history theory, reproductive strategies
depend on both developmental and environmental factors and
can be adaptive (Belsky, Steinberg, & Draper, 1991; Hoier,
2003). One developmental factor that has been identified as
influential in life history trajectory is pubertal timing (Belsky
et al., 1991; Hoier, 2003). In women, early pubertal timing is
associated with early onset of ovulatory cycles (Vihko & Apter,
1984). Even after menarche, women who experienced early
pubertal timing have been found to have higher estradiol levels
as adolescents (Vihko & Apter, 1984) and up until early adult-
hood (Apter, Reinila
¨, & Vihko, 1989; Bernstein, Pike, Ross, &
Henderson, 1991).
Research proposes that there is a complex relationship
between exposure to adversity and psychosocial stress early
in life and biological reactivity (Boyce & Ellis, 2005; Ellis,
2004). For instance, girls with high psychosocial stress arising
from father absence tend to experience earlier menarche than
girls whose fathers were present in their home (Doughty &

Rodgers, 2000; Ellis, McFadyen-Ketchum, Dodge, Pettit, &
Bates, 1999). Boyce and Ellis (2005) suggest that girls with
early father absence develop in a manner that speeds pubertal
maturation and accelerates onset of sexual activity, since they
are exposed to an environment where male parental investment
is unreliable. Indeed, research has shown that girls who expe-
rience early menarche have romantic relationships at an earlier
age, engage in sexual intercourse at an earlier age, and have
their first pregnancies earlier (Hoier, 2003; Udry, 1979). It is
unknown, however, whether women who experience menarche
at an earlier age plan to have children earlier or whether they
have their first pregnancy earlier as a by-product of having
romantic relationships and sexual intercourse at an earlier age.
We therefore aimed to investigate whether, in addition to their
actual reproductive outcomes, age of menarche also influences
women's reproductive plans. We predicted that women who
reported an earlier age of menarche would also report a
younger preferred age to have a first child.
It has also been argued that speed of sexual development
influences mate preferences because partner selection is instru-
mental for the implementation of reproductive strategies
(Cornwell et al., 2006). One preference that has been suggested
to influence reproductive strategies is that for masculinity.
There is some evidence that masculinity is a cue to health as
indicated by findings that males with higher levels of facial
masculinity are perceived to be healthier (Rhodes, Chan, Zeb-
rowitz, & Simmons, 2003). More importantly, although the
evidence is still debated (Rantala et al., 2013; Roberts, Bucha-
nan, & Evans, 2004), men with masculine faces might actually
be healthier as measured by health histories and medical exam-
inations (Rhodes et al., 2003).
Masculinity is also a cue to dominance (Batres, Re, &
Perrett, 2015) and intrasexual competitiveness (Puts, 2010;
Scott, Clark, Boothroyd, & Penton-Voak, 2013), since it sig-
nals physical strength and fighting ability. For instance, when
individuals are asked to vote for someone to run their country
in times of war, they select candidates with masculine faces
(Little, Burriss, Jones, & Roberts, 2007). Masculine men may
be healthier or more dominant, enabling them to win in intra-
sexual competitions, and as a result of successful competitions,
they may have greater access to resources, enabling them to
maintain a healthier physique and high status.
Along with the benefits associated with masculinity, there is
evidence of certain costs associated with this trait. For instance,
increasing facial masculinity results in decreasing perceptions
of warmth, cooperation, emotionality, honesty, and perceived
quality as a parent (Perrett et al., 1998). Additionally, there is
evidence for a link between masculinity and aggression, since
masculine faces are considered more threatening, coercive, vola-
tile, and controlling (Johnston, Hagel, Franklin, Fink, & Gram-
mer, 2001). Such evidence supports the idea that women face a
trade-off, with preferences depending on the costs and the ben-
efits of choosing a masculine partner. For example, masculinity
preferences are higher when women are considering engaging in
short-term relationships (Little, Burt, Penton-Voak, & Perrett,
2001; Little, Connely, Feinberg, Jones, & Roberts, 2011).
Masculinity preferences are also influenced by individual
differences. For instance, research has found a positive correla-
tion between a woman's age, within fertile years, and prefer-
ences for masculinity in male faces (e.g., Little et al., 2001).
Another individual difference that has been suggested to influ-
ence masculinity preferences is age of puberty. Cornwell et al.
(2006) predicted that women who mature earlier would have
learned to associate masculine characteristics with potential
mates and would therefore prefer faces with higher levels of
masculinity. More specifically, girls who experience earlier
menarche are more likely to draw the attention of boys who
are older and more physically mature (Gowen, Feldman, Diaz,
& Yisrael, 2004; Magnusson, Stattin, & Allen, 1985). This
early attention from boys with more sexually mature charac-
teristics may then result in early maturing girls preferring more
masculine partners (Cornwell et al., 2006).
Hoier (2003) did indeed find that women who experienced
earlier menarche gave higher overall attractiveness ratings to
male faces when compared to women who experienced later
menarche. Cornwell et al. (2006), however, found no effect of
menarche age on facial masculinity preferences but did find
that women who had intercourse at an earlier age preferred
more masculine faces. The link between pubertal timing and
partner preferences might not have been found in Cornwell
et al.'s (2006) study, since their sample consisted of only
46 women. Furthermore, age of menarche varies depending
on country of origin (Pathak & Whittemore, 1992), a variable
that was not controlled for in Cornwell et al.'s (2006) study.
Physical stress in the environment, such as economic hardship
and malnutrition, leads to a delay in puberty, since it is neces-
sary for the individual to channel energy toward growth and
survival rather than reproduction (Ellis & Garber, 2000; Sur-
bey, 1998). Given that physical stress in the environment varies
greatly across countries, it is helpful to hold country of origin
constant when examining age of menarche. Indeed, some stud-
ies have found that average age of menarche does not even
overlap between some countries (Bernstein et al., 1991). For
example, one study classified participants from the United
States as having menarche ``before age 12,'' ``at age 12,'' or
``at age 13 and older,'' whereas participants from China were
classified as having menarche ``before age 15,'' ``at age 15,'' or
``at age 16 and older'' (Bernstein et al., 1991). Such differences
suggest that country of origin should be held constant in order to
better examine the influences of pubertal timing.
Although Cornwell et al. (2006) did not find a link between
age of menarche and facial masculinity preferences, Jones,
Boothroyd, Feinberg, and DeBruine (2010) did find that
women who experience earlier menarche prefer more mascu-
linized male voices. Moreover, research has found that
women's preferences for men's facial and vocal masculinity
are positively correlated (Feinberg, DeBruine, Jones, & Little,
2008). We therefore aimed to investigate whether age of
menarche influences facial masculinity preferences in a large
sample of women from the United Kingdom and predicted that
women who reported early menarche would prefer more mas-
culine male faces.
2 Evolutionary Psychology
Age of menarche has also been linked with the number
of partners wanted, with earlier puberty leading to a higher
number of partners desired (Hoier, 2003). In addition, Smith
et al. (2009) found that women who prefer short-term rela-
tionships have stronger preferences for masculine men.
These studies (Hoier, 2003; Smith et al., 2009) likely indi-
cate that women who undergo menarche at a younger age
may be more interested in short-term sexual relationships.
Surprisingly, Hoier (2003) did not find a link between age
of menarche and sociosexuality (i.e., willingness to engage
in uncommitted sexual relationships). We therefore aimed to
further investigate the relationship between age of menarche
and women's sociosexual attitudes in a large sample of
women. We predicted that women who reported an earlier
age of menarche would report both a stronger sex drive and
a higher willingness to engage in uncommitted sexual
relationships.
Methods
Materials
Male and female university students aged 18­22 were photo-
graphed facing forward, under constant camera and lighting
conditions, with neutral expressions, no adornments, and
closed mouths. These images were delineated with 189 points
using Psychomorph, a custom face-processing software
(Tiddeman, Perrett, & Burt, 2001), and aligned to a standard
interpupillary distance (Rowland & Perrett, 1995). Seven
male composite images were created (each averaging three
original male faces together). Masculinity prototypes were
then generated by separately averaging the female faces and
the male faces (for details, see Batres & Perrett, 2014). The
seven composites were then transformed to create pairs
using +50% of the shape difference between the male and
the female prototypes while holding texture and color con-
stant. This resulted in a total of seven pairs of male faces,
where each pair was made up of a 50% feminized and a
50% masculinized face shape.
A questionnaire asked for the participant's sex, age, ethni-
city, sexual orientation, whether they already had children
(``How many children do you have?''), their preferred age
to have a first child (``What age would you like to have [or
have had] your first child?''), the age at which they had their
first sexual intercourse (``About what age were you when you
first had sexual intercourse?''), their age of menarche (``How
old were you when you started puberty [when you started your
first period]?''), their sex drive (on a scale from 1 ¼ strongly
disagree to 7 ¼ strongly agree, ``I have a strong sex drive''),
and the three attitude questions from the revised sociosexual
orientation inventory (Penke & Asendorpf, 2008; the average
score for these three questions was used in the analyses). The
attitude questions were utilized since of the three facets of
sociosexuality (i.e., behavior, attitude, and desire) attitude
toward sexual relationships is the best predictor of women's
preferences in potential partners (Quist et al., 2012).
Participants and Procedures
A total of 10,793 Caucasian nulliparous heterosexual women
aged 18­30 (mean years + SD ¼ 23.70 + 3.52) from the
United Kingdom completed all questions of the study online
(see Reimers, 2007 for details). Ethical criteria from the British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) editorial policy and guide-
lines were followed. Participants were first presented with the
questionnaire and instructed to skip any question that did not
apply to them (e.g., if they had not had sexual intercourse, then
they should skip the question regarding their age at first sexual
intercourse) or any question to which they did not recall the
answer (e.g., if they did not remember the age at which they
started their first period, then they should skip that question). It
must be noted that only participants who completed all ques-
tions of the study were included in the data analyses, meaning
that the sample was restricted to women who were sexually
active and wanted to have children at some point. After the
questionnaire, participants were then presented with the seven
pairs of faces varying in masculinity, where one pair appeared
at a time. The order of the pairs and which face was on the left/
right were both randomized. Participants were instructed to
select which face they considered to be the most attractive.
Results
Given that less than 5% of the sample reported age of menarche
at 10 years or younger and 16 years or older, we winsorized
those responses into two categories. Using those categories,
4.9% of women reported their age of menarche as 10 years
or younger, 16.8% reported age 11, 25.4% reported age 12,
29.9% reported age 13, 15.2% reported age 14, 5.5% reported
age 15, and 2.3% reported age 16 or older. For all the analyses,
masculinity preferences were calculated by taking the propor-
tion of masculine faces selected across the seven pairs. Partial
correlations controlling for current age were conducted (see
Table 1). There were significant positive correlations between
age of menarche and both age of first sexual intercourse,
r(10,790) ¼ .081, p < .001, and preferred age to have a first
child, r(10,790) ¼ .029, p ¼ .003 (see Figure 1). There were
significant negative correlations between age of menarche and
both masculinity preferences, r(10,790) ¼ À.024, p ¼ .014 (see
Figure 1) and sex drive, r(10,790) ¼ À.037, p < .001. There
was no significant correlation between age of menarche and
sociosexual attitude, r(10,790) ¼ .007, p ¼ .437.
The data were further analyzed using a two-step hierarchical
regression analysis (dependent variable: masculinity prefer-
ence; first-step independent variable: current age; second-step
independent variables: age of menarche, preferred age to have a
first child, age of first sexual intercourse, sex drive, and socio-
sexual attitude). Variance inflation factors (all 1.450) and
tolerance values (all ! 0.690) indicated that multicollinearity
was not an issue. Current age (b ¼ .010, p ¼ .319) was not a
significant predictor of masculinity preferences in the first
model, R2 change < .001, F(1, 10,792) ¼ 0.992, p ¼ .319. In
the second model, current age (b ¼ .008, p ¼ .517) and
Batres and Perrett 3
preferred age to have a first child (b ¼ .003, p ¼ .791) were not
significant predictors of masculinity preferences, but age of
first sexual intercourse (b ¼ .027, p ¼ .006), sex drive
(b ¼ .032, p ¼ .001), sociosexual attitude (b ¼ .023,
p ¼ .023), and menarche age (b ¼ À0.025, p ¼ .010) did
significantly predict masculinity preferences, R2 change ¼
.003, F(6, 10,792) ¼ 5.140, p < .001. A second identical
two-step hierarchical regression analysis was conducted with
the addition of interaction terms (Age of Menarche Â Preferred
Age to Have a First Child, Age of Menarche Â Age of First
Sexual Intercourse, Age of Menarche Â Sex Drive, and Age of
Menarche Â Sociosexual Attitude). None of the interaction
terms significantly predicted masculinity preferences
(b ¼ .184, p ¼ .159; b ¼ .192, p ¼ .063; b ¼ À.042,
p ¼ .654; b ¼ .059, p ¼ .537).
Given that sociosexuality is not related to age of menarche
but appears to be significantly related to masculinity prefer-
ences, we also ran a two-step hierarchical regression model that
controlled for sociosexual attitude (dependent variable: mascu-
linity preference; first-step independent variables: current age
and sociosexual attitude; second-step independent variables:
age of menarche, preferred age to have a first child, age of first
sexual intercourse, and sex drive). Variance inflation factors
(all 1.450) and tolerance values (all ! 0.690) indicated that
multicollinearity was not an issue. Current age (b ¼ .008,
p ¼ .412) was not a significant predictor of masculinity pre-
ferences, but sociosexual attitude (b ¼ .023, p ¼ .018) was a
significant predictor of masculinity preferences in the first
model, R2 change ¼ .001, F(2, 10,792) ¼ 3.273, p ¼ .038. In
the second model, current age (b ¼ .008, p ¼ .517) and pre-
ferred age to have a first child (b ¼ .003, p ¼ .791) were not
significant predictors of masculinity preferences, but sociosex-
ual attitude (b ¼ .023, p ¼ .023), age of first sexual intercourse
(b ¼ .027, p ¼ .006), sex drive (b ¼ .032, p ¼ .001), and
menarche age (b ¼ À.025, p ¼ .010) did significantly predict
masculinity preferences, R2 change ¼ .002, F(6, 10,792) ¼
5.140, p < .001.
To analyze whether the significant relationship between
age of menarche and masculinity preferences was being
driven by a specific age group, partial correlations control-
ling for current age were rerun excluding each menarche
age category. The relationship between age of menarche and
masculinity preferences remained significant when exclud-
ing every menarche category except for that of age 11.
When excluding participants who reported menarche as age
11, there was no significant correlation between age of

Discussion
The results from this study replicate the finding that women
who experience menarche at an earlier age have sexual inter-
course earlier (Hoier, 2003). This study also replicates the
finding that there is no link between age of menarche and
sociosexuality (Hoier, 2003). Along with previous literature
(Provost, Kormos, Kosakoski, & Quinsey, 2006), this study
shows that sociosexuality is related to masculinity preferences,
and since we found that early menarche is also related to mas-
culinity preferences, we expected for earlier menarche to be
related to a less restricted sociosexual attitude. Our study, how-
ever, did not find this link, and, with such a large sample, it
provides strong evidence that there is no relationship between
age of menarche and sociosexual attitudes. One possible expla-
nation for this finding is that age of menarche may not relate to
sociosexual attitudes but may relate to one or both of the two
other dimensions of sociosexuality (i.e., behavior and desire).
As mentioned earlier, girls who experience earlier menarche
draw more attention from boys (Gowen et al., 2004; Magnus-
son et al., 1985). Such increased levels of attention could mean
that women who experience menarche earlier may have similar
sociosexual attitudes to women who experience menarche
later, but those with earlier menarche may simply engage in
more sociosexual behaviors as a consequence of having more
opportunities to do so. This study only examined sociosexual
attitudes, and therefore, future research would be needed in
order to investigate the relationships between sociosexual
behaviors and desires with pubertal timing.
Our results showed that even after controlling for other
factors known to influence masculinity preferences (e.g., socio-
sexual attitude), women who experience earlier menarche
prefer more masculine male faces. This suggests that develop-
mental factors influence not only reproductive strategies but
also partner selection, which is instrumental for the
implementation of such strategies. Our findings support one
explanation proposed by Cornwell et al. (2006) in which girls
who experience early menarche may consider themselves to be
of higher quality, given their social success through puberty,
and therefore, these earlier maturing girls may in turn prefer
higher quality mates (i.e., more masculine). Alternatively, our
findings could also support a further explanation proposed by
Cornwell et al. (2006) and Jones et al. (2010) in which early
maturing girls might have learned to associate masculinity with
desirable mates, since girls who experience earlier menarche
are more likely to draw the attention from boys who are older
and more physically mature (Gowen et al., 2004; Magnusson
et al., 1985). Additionally, girls who experience early
menarche are more likely to have engaged in sexual and roman-
tic activity with older males and also receive more attention
and positive feedback from older males (Prokopc
akova, 1998).
These early positive interactions with older males could lead
early maturing girls to develop a preference for masculine-
looking partners later on in life, since older males look more
masculine (Batres et al., 2015). Indeed, research has found that
facial attractiveness judgments in adulthood reflect the effects
of visual exposure during critical periods of development
(Perrett et al., 2002; Saxton, Little, DeBruine, Jones, &
Roberts, 2009).
Upon further inspection, the significant relationship
between age of menarche and masculinity preferences seems
to be driven by women who experienced menarche at age 11.
As evidenced by Figure 1, masculinity preferences peak for
those women who reported age of menarche as 11. These find-
ings suggest that there might be something special about
experiencing menarche at that age. Indeed, at age 11, most girls
in the United Kingdom transition from primary school, where
they are surrounded by younger boys, to secondary school,
where they are surrounded by older boys. Thus, it appears that,
in the United Kingdom, age 11 is a critical period during devel-
opment that has long-lasting influences on partner preferences.
It would be interesting to examine the relationship between age
of menarche and masculinity preferences in countries where
the transition between primary and secondary school falls at a
different age in order to further test the influence of being
exposed to older boys during sexual maturation.
Our results also provide new evidence that women who
experience menarche at an earlier age have a younger preferred
age to have a first child than women who experience menarche
at a later age. This relationship persisted even after controlling
for other factors. This suggests that women who experience
early pubertal timing not only have children earlier (Udry,
1979) but notably plan to have children earlier. This distinction
is important, as it provides evidence that women experiencing
earlier menarche are planning to reproduce earlier, not simply
having earlier pregnancies as a by-product of having romantic
relationships and sexual intercourse at an earlier age. Addition-
ally, it is important to note that, although statistically signifi-
cant, several effect sizes in our regression analyses, including
the effect size of menarche age on preferred age to have a first
child, were statistically quite small. That said, our findings are
Batres and Perrett 5
of theoretical importance since they provide evidence that even
after many years, age of menarche still relates to our variables
of interest (e.g., preferred age to have a first child).
One possible explanation for our findings is that levels of
female reproductive hormones may underlie all of our variables
of interest (i.e., age of menarche, preferred age to have a first
child, and masculinity preferences). Women who experience
earlier menarche have higher estradiol levels as adolescents
(Vihko & Apter, 1984) and even up until early adulthood
(Apter et al., 1989; Bernstein et al., 1991). Reproductive hor-
mones have been found to influence feminine appearance
(Jasien
´ska, Ellison, & Thune, 2004), partner preferences (Fein-
berg et al., 2012), and ideal number of children (Law-Smith
et al., 2012). For instance, women with higher levels of estro-
gen are more likely to have feminine body shapes (Jasien
´ska
et al., 2004) and faces (Smith et al., 2006). Feminine women
are rated as more attractive (Rhodes et al., 2003), and conse-
quently, they may be able to choose masculine partners and
enforce demands of paternal investment more successfully than
less feminine women (Feinberg et al., 2012). Indeed, research
has found that women who rate themselves as more attractive
are more attracted to masculinity (Feinberg et al., 2012; Little
et al., 2001). Estrogen levels have also been found to correlate
positively with maternal tendencies (Law-Smith et al., 2012).
Given such findings, it is possible that levels of reproductive
hormones may explain the links between early menarche and
both desire to have children at a younger age and preferences
for more masculine partners.
It would be beneficial for future studies to examine whether
the links between early menarche, preferred age to have a first
child, and masculinity preferences are also present in other
countries. As mentioned earlier, physical stress in the environ-
ment, such as economic hardship and malnutrition, leads to a
delay in puberty, since it is necessary for the individual to
channel energy toward growth and survival rather than repro-
duction (Ellis & Garber, 2000; Surbey, 1998). The United
Kingdom is a developed country with high gross national
income per capita and high life expectancy (United Nations
Development Programme, 2014); hence, it would be interesting
to compare the influence of age of menarche in a country that
has low gross national income per capita and low life expec-
tancy. Additionally, women from the United Kingdom have
access to free public health care and contraception, both of
which may influence their reproductive strategies. It would
therefore be interesting to examine how age of menarche influ-
ences reproductive plans as well as sexual attitudes and beha-
viors in countries where women do not have access to such
services. Lastly, even within the same country, women's envir-
onments will vary, and therefore, future research would benefit
from delving further into how physical stress in the environ-
ment (e.g., socioeconomic status) influences reproductive stra-
tegies and mate preferences through pubertal timing.
