Maternal Smoking and Birth Weight
Interaction With Parity
and Mother's Own In Utero Exposure to Smoking
Dawn P. Misra,* Nan Astone, and Courtney D. Lynch
Background: Few studies have reported interactions between ma-
ternal smoking and other maternal characteristics and exposures. We
examined maternal smoking in a cohort study for which data from 3
generations were available to examine maternal characteristics and
exposures from a life-course perspective.
Methods: We had data from 3 generations: women enrolled in the
U.S. Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP) between 1959 and 1965
at the Baltimore site (G1); daughters (G2) of those G1 mothers who
were followed to ages 27­33 years in the Pathways to Adulthood
study; and children (G3) born to the G2 women who provided
pregnancy and birth information during the Pathways study. These
data allowed examination of exposures that occurred to the mother
during her childhood and in utero.
Results: We found evidence of a 3-way interaction effect on birth
weight for maternal smoking in pregnancy, maternal exposure to
smoking in utero (grandmaternal smoking), and maternal parity.
Maternal smoking reduced birth weight in 3 of the subgroups, with
the size of the effect on birth weight moderated by parity and the
mother's own in utero exposure to smoking.
Conclusions: A mother's prenatal exposure to smoke may affect the
birth weight of her offspring. This effect would be consistent with both
the accumulation-of-risk and the fetal-programming hypotheses.

Maternal smoking is associated with reduced birth
weight across a wide range of populations,1­10 often
with a dose­response trend.1,4,7,11­15 A few studies have
reported interactions between maternal smoking and other
maternal characteristics and exposures. Cnattingius and col-
leagues have reported a stronger association of smoking with
the risks of small-for-gestational age among older moth-
ers9,16,17 and low birth weight among multiparous mothers.18
We examined maternal smoking in a cohort for which we
had data from 3 generations: women enrolled in the U.S.
Collaborative Perinatal Project study between 1959 and 1965 at
the Baltimore site (G1); daughters (G2) born to those G1
mothers and followed to ages 27­33 years in the Pathways to
Adulthood study; and children (G3) born to G2 women who
provided pregnancy and birth information during the CPP Path-
ways study. These data allow us to examine exposures that
occurred to the mother during her childhood and even in utero.
We present here the results of analyses examining the effect of
maternal smoking on birth weight, with exploration of interac-
tions with other maternal factors including in utero exposures to
the mother.
METHODS
Data from 2 large longitudinal cohort studies were
combined to create the intergenerational dataset for the
present study. The Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board
approved our use of these data. The Collaborative Perinatal
Project was a multicenter prospective study designed to
identify risk factors for adverse perinatal and pediatric out-
comes. Pregnant women were enrolled from 1959 to 1964,
and their offspring were followed to 8 years of age.19 From
1992 to 1994, investigators at Johns Hopkins Hospital
launched a follow-up study of the original Baltimore-based
study participants and their children. Johns Hopkins had
enrolled 4025 women in the original study from 1959 to
1964. Among those women, 187 had children who died
during the follow-up and 404 did not participate in follow-up
of the children at age 7 to 8 years. We also excluded 427 who
had delivered in 1959 (before the original study protocol had

families were excluded randomly to cut costs. These exclu-
sion criteria left 2694 (67%) of the G1­G2 pairs eligible for
follow-up. Among these families, 1482 (55%) had provided
complete G1 and G2 interviews.
We then necessarily excluded G2 women with no
children (n  218). We also excluded G2 men (n  674). To
ensure that the information obtained regarding G2's birth and
childhood was as accurate as possible, we excluded those
families whose G1 interview was completed by someone
other than the biologic mother (n  29). G2s who were twins
and G2s of "other" races were also excluded. After our
exclusions, 554 G2s remained for study.
A total of 1131 G3 children were reported by these 554
G2 women at their interview at age 27 to 33 years. We excluded
60 children with abnormalities at birth, 34 children with missing
birth weights, 1 child whose birth weight was reported to have
been less than 500 g, and 10 sets of twins. This left 1016 G3
children for analysis. Some G1 women had more than 1 preg-
nancy in the original study, and some G2 women had more than
1 child at the time of their interview. This resulted in noninde-
pendent observations on 2 levels: G2s with the same mother and
G3s with the same mother or grandmother. Dealing with this
multiple clustering is not entirely straightforward using standard
software. Therefore, we selected only the eldest female G2 in
each sibship and used Generalized Estimating Equations applied
to ordinary least squares regression to deal with G3 offspring
born to the same G2 mother.20,21
Finally, we excluded 18 infants whose G2 mothers re-
ported having diabetes. Diabetes is associated with higher birth
weights but not necessarily healthy perinatal outcomes. The final
study sample size was 989 G3 infants born to 500 G2 mothers.
Variable Definition and Construction
Birth weight of the G3 infant was reported in pounds
and ounces by the mother (G2) at the time of the interview.
Although the length of the recall period varied, studies have
shown that mother's recall of infant birth weight is reason-
ably accurate.22,23 Mothers were not asked to provide gesta-
tional age for the G3s, precluding the study of intrauterine
growth restriction and preterm birth.
G2 variables for the index pregnancy included mother's
race (black, white), adult height (inches), age at G3 birth (years),
education at G3 birth (some college vs. not), parity before G3
birth (nulliparous, parous), and smoking during G3 pregnancy
(yes, no). Age was modeled as a linear and quadratic term. A
complete smoking history was obtained, including information
on the dates when women began and ended periods of smoking.
The unit of time was quarters of a year (eg, January through
March). We noted the smoking status of G2 participants during
the quarter-years during which the mother was pregnant with
G3, and categorized the mothers into those who had never
smoked, those who quit before the G3 index pregnancy, those
who smoked during part of the index pregnancy, and those who
smoked during the entire index pregnancy. Preliminary analysis
indicated that the relevant categories were those who smoked at
all during the pregnancy and those who did not. The smokers
were therefore combined for final analysis. An advantage of our
data was the ability to link data on the childhood and prenatal (in
utero) exposures of the mother. We included G2's own birth
weight and whether or not the G2 mother had been small for her
gestational age (intrauterine growth restriction IUGR). These
data were available from medical records abstracted for the
original study. IUGR was categorized as a dichotomous variable
based on a 10th percentile cut-off of birth weight for gesta-
tional age using a U.S. standard growth chart.24 Childhood
exposures include the receipt of welfare in G2's household at
birth or age 7 years and whether G2 was ever hospitalized
between birth and age 8 years. Several variables were avail-
able for G1 (the mother of G2 and the grandmother of G3):
height (inches), prepregnancy body mass index (BMI, kg/
m2), education at G2's birth (at least high school diploma
versus not), poverty ratio at G2's birth (a ratio of household
needs to income, with values below 1 indicating poverty and
unmet needs), history of sexually transmitted diseases (yes or
no), and smoking during G2 pregnancy (yes or no). The
correlation in the original study of self-reported smoking
status with biomarkers has been well documented.25
Statistical Methods
We assessed differences in birth weight (grams) by
computing the difference in mean birth weight and the ac-
companying t test statistics. To adjust for G3s who were
related, we applied GEE to ordinary least squares regression
and adjusted the variance estimates for clustering by comput-
ing robust standard errors.20,21 To determine the significance
of the interaction terms, we relied on 2 tests of model fit,
rather than t test statistics for the coefficients, since the
standard errors of the latter are subject to substantial col-
linearity when all possible interactions involving some vari-
ables are added to the model.
RESULTS
The mean birth weight for the G3 children in our
sample was 3175 gm. Table 1 presents the frequency of the
various descriptive characteristics of G1, G2, and G3 indi-
viduals for the entire G3 sample and for G3s exposed to
maternal smoking compared with those who were not. As
expected, the mean birth weight for G3s born to smoking
mothers was 132 g lower than for those born to nonsmoking
mothers (3251 gm vs. 3119 gm). Adjustment for the other
variables included in Table 1 made only a small difference.
We were interested a priori in 3 potential effect modifiers:
maternal age at G3 birth, parity at G3 birth, and G1 smoking
in G2 pregnancy (in utero exposure of the index child's
mother). We found no evidence of interaction with maternal

age. We did, however, find a significant interaction of parity
(Table 2); among nulliparous women the G3 infants born to
smoking mothers were just 38 g lighter than their nonsmok-
ing counterparts while the G3s born to multiparous smoking
mothers were 250 gm lighter. We also found interaction of
grandmother's (G1's) smoking. Maternal smoking had little
effect (21 gm) if the mother had been unexposed in utero (ie,
if G1 did not smoke while pregnant with G2), but a large
effect (284g) if G1 had smoked during G2's gestation.
We then looked for a possible 3-way interaction among
maternal smoking, parity, and grandmaternal smoking. On
the basis of 2 analyses, including the 3-way interaction
improved the fit of the model (P  0.05 for addition of the
3-way interaction to the model with the main effects and both
2-way interactions).
Table 2 presents the crude and adjusted models with the
effect of maternal smoking on G3 birth weight stratified into
4 groups: nulliparous G2 mothers where G1 did not smoke;
parous G2 mothers where G1 did not smoke; nulliparous G2
mothers where G1 smoked; parous G2 mothers where G1
smoked. As indicated in the table footnotes, results were
adjusted for several covariates, including G2's own birth
weight. Because there was little difference between adjust-
ment for G2 birth weight and G2 IUGR, we chose to include
G2 birth weight (which probably has less measurement er-
ror). Maternal smoking had essentially no effect on birth
weight for infants born to G2 women who were nulliparous
and were unexposed to smoking in utero. However, maternal
smoking had a negative effect on the other 3 groups, with the
size of the birth weight effect moderated by parity and
grandmother's smoking. The strongest effect was in the
group of parous women exposed to smoking in utero, for
whom the G3 birth weight was reduced by more than 400 gm.
DISCUSSION
Maternal smoking during pregnancy is strongly linked to
reduced birth weight and impaired fetal growth.1­10 However,
only a small number of studies have examined the possibility
that the effects of maternal smoking depend on the underlying
characteristics of the population. The adverse effect of maternal
smoking on birth weight and fetal growth appears to be stronger
among older mothers.9,10,16­18,26 In a follow-up report examin-
ing outcomes for nearly half a million births, Cnattingius and
colleagues18 reported that the effect of smoking on the risk of
low birth weight increased with both age and parity. Our results
are consistent with the parity interaction observed by Cnattin-

gius, although we did not find an interaction with maternal age.
However, our sample size is much smaller and in particular had
few older mothers.
There is a growing body of research on the effect of
prenatal environment on adult chronic disease.27,28 Much of
this research has focused on birth weight and small-for-
gestational-age, which are assumed to be proxies for the fetal
"programming" that has occurred during critical fetal periods.
The exposures that may produce "programming" are unclear.
Most studies on outcomes in adulthood have relied on cohorts
of men and women with only the most rudimentary informa-
tion on their gestational history (ie, birth certificates). We had
data on the mother's in utero exposure as well as her birth
weight and IUGR status. We included maternal birth weight
(Table 2) in our final models and also maternal IUGR (results
not shown) but these variables failed to account for the effects
of G2's in utero exposure to smoking. We also adjusted for
other variables (mother's adult height, childhood hospitaliza-
tions) that might capture ways in which this very early
exposure to smoking might have adversely affected the
mother and thus explain the effects on her offspring, but the
effects persisted. In utero smoking exposure appears to have
an effect on a woman's offspring that is independent of its
effect on her own health in infancy and childhood, thereby
supporting the notion of "fetal programming."
Effects of exposures across the life course have also
been proposed to influence later outcomes through an "accu-
mulation of risk."27,29 In utero smoking exposure may add to
the cumulative effect of smoking exposure the mother expe-
riences before and during pregnancy. Although these 2 path-
ways are not mutually exclusive, one pathway may predom-
inate with regard to a particular exposure or outcome. Both
the "accumulation of risk" and "fetal programming" models
are consistent with our finding of larger effects of maternal
smoking on birth weight among women who were themselves
exposed in utero to smoking.
The finding of increased birth weight in offspring of
nonsmoking mothers who were themselves prenatally ex-
posed to smoke is more puzzling. There may be residual
confounding. For example, although smoking in present-day
cohorts is associated with decreased socioeconomic status,
smoking by women in the 1960s may have been associated
with higher socioeconomic status. Therefore, G1s who
smoked may have been better off in unmeasured ways than
G1s who did not smoke, and thus transferred these advan-
tages to their G2 offspring. Such a difference could poten-
tially explain the apparently beneficial effects of G1 smoking
on G3 birth weight among the nonsmoking G2s.
Finally, our findings of no adverse effect of maternal
smoking for the subgroup of nulliparas unexposed in utero
must be addressed. With the exception of recent work by
Cnattingius and a few others discussed above, little has been
done to identify subgroups who may experience differential
vulnerability to the effect of smoking. Furthermore, few
studies have data on the mother's in utero exposure to
smoking. Our findings must therefore be interpreted cau-
tiously. Selection bias due to attrition and exclusions may
contribute to the results, although some of the attrition was
random. The exclusions were primarily related to G2 sex and
birth order, factors that are unlikely to be associated with
effects of smoking and parity on G3 birth weight.
