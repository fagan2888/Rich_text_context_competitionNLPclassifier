Fathers' Investments of Money and Time Across
Residential Contexts
Fathers' roles in family life have changed dra-
matically over the past 50 years. In addition to
ongoing breadwinning responsibilities, many
fathers are now involved in direct caregiving
and engagement with children. Yet there is
considerable variation in what fathers do, espe-
cially depending on whether they live with
or away from their child. In this article, the
authors use data from the Fragile Families and
Child Wellbeing Study (N = 3,869) to describe
how fathers' economic capacities (money) and
direct involvement with children (time) are
associated over child ages 1 to 9 for resident
versus nonresident fathers, net of confounding
factors. They found suggestive evidence that
money and time investments operate differently
across residential contexts: Resident fathers
experience a trade-off between market work
and time involved with children. In contrast,
nonresident fathers' higher economic capacities

are associated with more time involvement,
underscoring the greater challenge for such
fathers to remain actively involved.
Over the past half-century, major demographic
changes have fundamentally altered fathers'
roles in family life. In particular, union dis-
solution has increased, owing to high divorce
rates and the growing proportion of births that
occur outside of marriage (which are less often
followed by long-term union stability than are
marital births). Because children are more likely
to live with their mother when their parents'
union ends (Amato, 2000), fathers today are
more likely to be living away from their bio-
logical children than are mothers--and than
their mid-20th-century counterparts. Overall, a
striking aggregate decline in the proportion of
U.S. men living with their own biological chil-
dren has been observed between the mid-1960s
and the mid-1990s (Eggebeen, 2002) and likely
beyond. From the perspective of children,
according to recent census data, 27% of all
children under age 18 were living away from
their biological father in 2014 (U.S. Census
Bureau, 2014).
In addition to changing demographic pat-
terns, fathers' involvement in family life has also
changed substantially over the past half-century,
reflecting shifts in family gender roles and the
division of household labor and market work.
Although providing economic support remains

important, fathering today also often includes
nurturing and providing direct care; engaging in
cognitive stimulation and play activities; taking
responsibility for coordinating children's care
and activities; and connecting the child to his
or her extended family, community members,
and other resources (Cabrera, Tamis-LeMonda,
Bradley, Hofferth, & Lamb, 2000; Marsiglio,
Amato, Day, & Lamb, 2000; Palkovitz, 2002).
At the intersection of changes in family
demography and the nature of fathering is the
fact that there is, today, great heterogeneity
in how men enact the father role. Although a
significant body of research has explored the
"new fatherhood" and its consequences for
children (Cabrera & Tamis-LeMonda, 2012;
Lamb, 2010), less well understood is how the
various dimensions of contemporary fathers'
involvement may be interrelated, particularly
across residential contexts. In this article we
provide descriptive evidence about how fathers'
economic capacities and contributions are
linked to fathers' time involvement (across
several measures), comparing resident versus
nonresident fathers over Years 1­9 after a focal
child's birth. This is an important question
because this interrelationship may affect the
total amount of investment that children "get,"
which is linked with children's well-being and
development (Bornstein, 2006; Lamb, 2010).
Also, this work highlights the challenges for
nonresident fathers to remain actively involved
with children, as they cannot benefit from the
joint allocation of parenting tasks that occurs
among coresident couples and as they must nav-
igate greater complexity when new partners (of
fathers or mothers) get involved (Tach, Mincy,
& Edin, 2010).
Conceptual Framing and Prior Empirical
Research
Family scholars often point to two key domains
of parental investments in children--economic
resources and parenting behaviors--or, collo-
quially, money and time (Thomson & McLana-
han, 2012). Economic resources enable parents
to provide the food, clothing, and shelter req-
uisite for daily living as well as the material
goods and experiences that promote positive
child development (Duncan & Brooks-Gunn,
1997; Magnuson & Votruba-Drzal, 2009). Par-
enting time encompasses the wide range of
interactions, behaviors, and activities that allow
parents to provide the appropriate warmth, sup-
port, control, and monitoring that are intrin-
sic to high-quality (or so-called "authoritative")
parenting, which has been shown to be posi-
tively related to children's well-being (Amato &
Fowler, 2002; Baumrind, 1986).
Although early research on parenting empha-
sized the importance of mothers for children,
the past few decades have produced a large
literature more specifically focused on father-
hood, exploring variation in its content, context,
and implications (Furstenberg, 1988; Lamb,
2010; Marsiglio et al., 2000). As noted above,
the father role has broadened from the heyday
of the breadwinner­homemaker family model
in the mid-20th century (Cherlin, 2009), yet
providing economic support remains a key
element of fathering and fathers' identity today
(Christiansen & Palkovitz, 2001). Economic
contributions and capacities are reflected in
the work hours that fathers expend in the labor
market, their earnings (which result both from
work hours and reflect characteristics such
as age and education), and--for nonresident
fathers--the actual amount that they pay toward
children's expenses in the form of child support.
With respect to fathers'(noneconomic) involve-
ment with children, one of the first and most
enduring typologies of father involvement iden-
tified three key components: (a) accessibility,
(b) engagement, and (c) responsibility (Lamb,
2010; Lamb, Pleck, Charnov, & Levine, 1985).
Accessibility refers to time fathers are available
to children (even if not directly interacting),
engagement refers to fathers' time with children
doing activities together, and responsibility
refers to fathers' helping to arrange resources
and activities for children (Lamb, 1986). We
explore each of these here.
Links Between Fathers' Money and Time
Investments, by Residential Status
For cohabiting and, especially, married men,
paternal investments of money and time occur
conjointly within what some scholars have
called the "package deal" (Furstenberg & Cher-
lin, 1991; Townsend, 2002). Becker's (1965)
classic theory of household production posits
that households "combine time and market
goods to produce more basic commodities that
directly enter their utility functions" (p. 495).
As Weiss and Willis (1985) argued, children are
a collective good, and parents living together
12 Journal of Marriage and Family
(especially with the insurance value of marriage)
can jointly allocate their investments of time in
market work and time with children to achieve
an efficient outcome (Steinberg, 2001). Because
time is finite, time spent in the labor market
is by definition time not spent with children,
so we would expect a negative relationship
between employment and parental involvement
generally, but especially for fathers, who have
historically spent more time in breadwinning
(Coltrane, 1996; Knoester & Eggebeen, 2006).
By contrast, nonresident fathers face both
barriers and disincentives to their involvement
with children, and providing economic support
may in fact facilitate fathers being involved in
other ways. When fathers live apart from their
children, they have less incentive to invest in
them because they cannot be certain how any
contributions will be spent (Weiss & Willis,
1985). When combined with the lost economies
of scale (two households vs. one), child-rearing
investments by nonresident fathers are likely
to be inefficiently low without policy interven-
tion (Willis, 2000). Also, mothers may serve
as "gatekeepers" to children after separation
(Allen & Hawkins, 1999), and financial con-
tributions help mothers to perceive fathers as
more competent (Fagan & Barnett, 2003). In
particular, fathers' greater work effort, higher
earnings--and, even more so, their actual finan-
cial contributions--may give them (and the
mother) a greater sense of being a "good" father
and hence encourage their involvement in other
ways (Johnson, Levine, & Doolittle, 1999;
Lerman & Sorenson, 2000). Recent studies
have found a positive link between paternal
employment of unmarried, nonresident fathers
and father­child contact (Cabrera, Fagan, &
Farrie, 2008; Ryan, Kalil, & Ziol-Guest, 2008)
as well as between fathers' child support (espe-
cially informal support) and fathers' time with
children (Amato, Meyers, & Emery, 2009;
Garasky, Stewart, Gundersen, & Lohman, 2010;
Huang, 2009; Nepomnyaschy, 2007). There-
fore, although, as for resident fathers, time at
work cannot be time spent with children, we
would expect a positive relationship between
nonresident fathers' economic capacities and
time involvement.
Confounding Factors
Selection may play a role in how fathers'
economic characteristics are associated with
fathers' time involvement with children. Dis-
advantaged fathers (who are often young,
racial/ethnic minorities, had a nonmarital birth,
have been incarcerated, had children with more
than one partner, and experienced a nontradi-
tional family structure in youth) generally have
weaker connections to the formal economy
and lower levels of father involvement than
their more advantaged counterparts (Berger
& Langton, 2011; Cheadle, Amato, & King,
2010). Additional factors that may influence
father involvement include health (Coley &
Hernandez, 2006), religiosity (King, 2003),
and fathering attitudes and context (Carlson &
Berger, 2013; Waller, 2012). The gender of the
child can influence fathers' work effort and time
involvement (Lundberg, McLanahan, & Rose,
2007), and a grandmother living in the home
provides another set of hands to help with child
rearing but may also alter fathers' duties and
responsibilities (Dunifon, Ziol-Guest, & Kopko,
2014).
The Present Study
In this article we provide new information about
fathers' involvement with children over Years
1­9 after a focal child's birth, using data from
the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study
(http://www.fragilefamilies.princeton.edu).
We examine how fathers' economic capaci-
ties and characteristics (money) are related to
their direct involvement (time) with children,
exploring differences between resident and
nonresident fathers. This research sheds light
on the nature of contemporary fatherhood and
what children "get" from parents and highlights
the challenges for nonresident fathers to stay
involved.
Method
Data
We use data from the Fragile Families and
Child Wellbeing Study, a longitudinal study of
urban births (with an oversample of nonmari-
tal births) that occurred between 1998 and 2000.
The study includes 4,897 births (3,710 unmar-
ried and 1,187 married), and the weighted sam-
ple is representative of births in U.S. cities with
populations over 200,000. Baseline interviews
with mothers and fathers took place in 75 hos-
pitals in 20 cities (in 15 states) just after the
Fathers' Money and Time 13
baby's birth, and follow-up interviews were con-
ducted about 1, 3, 5, and 9 years after the birth.
Overall, 4,331 fathers were interviewed at least
once from birth through Year 9. At the 1-, 3-, 5-,
and 9-year follow-up surveys, the proportions of
eligible unmarried (at birth) fathers interviewed
were 71%, 69%, 67%, and 56% and of married
(at birth) fathers were 82%, 82%, 78%, and 69%,
respectively.
Analytic Sample
We limited our sample to fathers who were
interviewed at least once over the 1-, 3-, 5-,
and 9-year survey waves (N = 4,092). We then
dropped fathers who were interviewed in jail
(because incarceration hinders fathers' ability
to contribute both time and money; n = 102,
2.5%) and cases in which the focal child did
not reside with the biological mother at least
half-time (n = 29, 0.7%). Also, 92 observations
(2.2%) were dropped because of missing data
on the main variables of interest (father's eco-
nomic capacities or time involvement). The full
analytic sample for this article consists of 3,869
fathers. We pooled interviewed cases across the
four survey waves, yielding 11,055 person-year
observations, with a mean number of 2.9 sur-
vey waves for each father. Fathers' residence
status relative to the focal child is reported
at each survey wave and can change across
waves (if the father moves in or out); resident
fathers contributed 7,167 person-year observa-
tions, and nonresident fathers contributed 3,888
person-year observations.
Observations with missing data on covariates
were multiply imputed with chained equations
using the mi commands in Stata 14. All vari-
ables were included in the imputation equations,
and 10 imputed data sets were created. The frac-
tion missing was 11% or less for every vari-
able except earnings, with 30% of person-years
missing primarily because of missing data at
the 1-year survey (we imputed this information
as noted later). Only observations with com-
plete information on the outcome variables were
used for analyses (White, Royston, & Wood,
2011). The sample varies slightly across the esti-
mated models, as the number of cases with com-
plete information on each father involvement
measure fluctuates. It is important to keep the
analytic sample in mind when interpreting the
findings; fathers lost to attrition by the 9-year
survey were more disadvantaged than those who
remained.
Fathers' Economic Characteristics (Money)
We used several measures of fathers' economic
characteristics in order to capture different
aspects of fathers' work effort and capacity
as providers. Across the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 9-year
surveys fathers reported on their employment
and earnings during the previous year. For
our employment measure, we combined hours
worked per week and weeks worked per year
to create a measure of average weekly hours
worked. For our earnings measure, we used
information based on fathers' reports about
earnings from all jobs in the past year to get a
measure of annual earnings (converted to 2008
dollars--the approximate year of the last survey
wave). Fathers who said they "didn't know"
their exact earnings were given a range of val-
ues, which we then converted to median values
within categories. In addition, a direct question
about total earnings from all jobs was not asked
of all respondents at the 1-year survey, so we
imputed the missing observations with a series of
predictors: currently employed, weeks worked
per year, relationship status, race, education,
immigrant status, and ever incarcerated.
For nonresident fathers, in addition to work
hours and earnings, we also include the total
annual amount of child support paid, reported by
mothers. At each survey wave, mothers indicated
the amount of formal child support received in
the past year (or since a formal order began
or changed) as well as the amount of informal
support received. We summed these amounts
and converted the total into an annualized metric.
Nonresident fathers without a formal order and
no informal agreement with the mother were
coded as 0. Fathers' child support payments are
inflation-adjusted and reported in 2008 dollars.
Fathers' Direct Involvement (Time)
We measured fathers' direct involvement with
children with multiple variables that correspond
to the key domains of paternal involvement:
accessibility (time), engagement, and responsi-
bility. We relied on mothers' reports of fathers'
involvement in order to avoid inflated associa-
tions due to shared method variance, whereby
the same individual reports on both the indepen-
dent and dependent variables (Marsiglio et al.,
2000). Fathers' accessibility to (or time with)
the child reflects how often the father spent
one or more hours a day with the child in
the past month, ranging from 1 (never) to 5
14 Journal of Marriage and Family
(every day). We measured paternal engagement
in father­child activities at Years 1, 3, and 5 as
the mean number of days (0­7) that the father did
each of four activities with the child in the past
week: singing, reading stories, telling stories,
and playing with toys (s = .91, .90, .91, respec-
tively). At Year 9, engagement included different
activities reflecting children's older age: playing
sports or outdoor activities, reading with or talk-
ing about books, talking with the child about his
or her day, and helping with homework. Also,
the response scale was changed to reflect activ-
ities in the past month, ranging from 1 (never)
to 5 (every day); we assigned the 1­5 scores to
0­7 days to yield a range of variation similar
to those at prior waves ( = .85). To examine
fathers' shared responsibility for child-related
tasks, we relied on mothers' reports about how
often the father (a) "Looks after [child] when
you need to do things," (b) "Runs errands like
picking things up from the store," and (c) "Takes
[child] places (he/she) needs to go, such as to
day care or the doctor." Response choices ranged
from never (1) to often (4), with higher average
scores indicating greater shared responsibility
( = .89­.95 across waves). An additional mea-
sure of fathers' time with children was available
for nonresident fathers: Mothers reported the
number of days fathers saw the child in the past
month (range: 0­30). We also created a com-
posite involvement measure that used all items
from the time, engagement, and responsibility
measures common to nonresident and resident
fathers; each item was standardized with a mean
of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 ( = .76­.77
for resident fathers and .91­.94 for nonresident
fathers across waves).
Covariates
We included a number of time-constant and
time-varying covariates that may be associated
with both fathers' economic capacities and
time involvement. All time-constant measures
were reported by fathers at the baseline survey
unless otherwise noted. We include whether
the parents were married when the focal child
was born (reported by mothers). Fathers' age
at birth was self-reported in years. Fathers'
race/ethnicity was specified as non-Hispanic
White (reference), non-Hispanic Black, His-
panic, and non-Hispanic other race. Fathers'
education was measured with categories of less
than high school (reference), high school degree,
some college, and bachelor's degree or higher.
Immigrant status indicated that the father was
born outside the United States. Fathers' family
background reflected whether he lived with both
biological parents at age 15. We also included
fathers' attitudes toward fathering, based on
whether they responded strongly disagree (1) to
strongly agree (4) with the following statements:
(a) "Being a father and raising children is one of
the most fulfilling experiences a man can have,"
(b) "I want people to know that I have a new
child," and (c) "Not being a part of my child's
life would be one the worst things that could
happen to me." Responses were averaged, and
higher scores indicated more positive attitudes
( = .73). We also indicated whether the child
was a boy.
Time-varying covariates were measured at
each wave and were reported by fathers unless
noted otherwise. Fathers' self-reported health
status ranged from poor (1) to excellent (5). Reli-
gious service attendance ranged from never (1)
to more than once a week (5). Fathers with a
major depressive episode were classified accord-
ing to the Composite International Diagnos-
tic Interview--Short Form (Kessler, Andrews,
Mroczek, Ustun, & Wittchen, 1998). Mothers'
and fathers' combined reports indicated whether
the father had ever been incarcerated by each
follow-up wave. The father reported the total
number of biological children he had had with
the focal child's mother and with other women
(multipartnered fertility).
We also included time-varying covariates that
captured mothers' and fathers' relationship sta-
tus. For coresident fathers, we included a vari-
able indicating that they were legally married
to the child's mother (vs. cohabiting). For non-
resident fathers, we included a dummy variable
indicating they were in a dating relationship with
the mother (vs. not romantically involved), and
we included separate variables indicating that
the father--or the mother--was involved in a
romantic relationship with a new partner. Last,
we included whether the child's grandmother
was living with the mother and child and the
number of hours that the mother worked per
week, both reported by mothers.

aSignificantly different than resident fathers at p < .05. bTime-varying covariates. Sample statistics measured at the Year 1
survey.
Overall, resident fathers were more advantaged
than nonresident fathers. Resident fathers were
more likely to have been married to the child's
mother, to have higher levels of education,
to have lived with both biological parents at
age 15, and to have more positive fathering
attitudes. Nonresident fathers were much more
likely to be of minority race/ethnicity, to have
been incarcerated, and to have had a child with
another partner.
As shown in Table 2, the composition of resi-
dent and nonresident fathers changed over time,
as an increasing number of coresident couples
broke up. As a result, changes in mean levels
of father involvement across waves reflect both
changes in the parenting behavior of fathers who
remained in a given status as well as changes in
the sample composition as fathers moved from
resident to nonresident status (and a small num-
ber moved from nonresident to resident status).
At 1 year, 71% of resident fathers were mar-
ried to the focal child's mother. By 9 years, this
fraction had increased to 88%, reflecting mar-
riage among some cohabiting couples and that
a greater share of cohabiting than married par-
ents broke up over time. For nonresident fathers,
18% were dating the focal child's mother at 1
year, compared to 10% by 9 years. At 1 year,
32% of nonresident fathers were involved with
a new partner, which then increased over time.

status at each wave. Then we use two multi-
variate analytic techniques (with pooled data
across the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 9-year surveys) to
examine how fathers' economic resources were
associated with fathers' direct involvement
(time, engagement, and shared responsibility).
Because we have repeated measures about the
same men over time, we used models designed
for panel data. Random effects models use vari-
ation both between and within fathers, including
time-constant and time-varying variables, and
fixed effects models use variation only within
fathers over time to examine how changes in
economic characteristics are associated with
changes in direct involvement, controlling for
time-varying variables (time-constant variables
are automatically dropped). The latter reduces
bias by controlling for unobserved individual,
time-invariant characteristics that may be asso-
ciated with fathers' economic resources and
involvement (Greene, 2003; Snijders, 2005).
For example, some fathers may have personal
values (e.g., conscientiousness) that predict both
their hard work in the labor market and their
active involvement with children. The Hausman
test (at p < .05) indicated that random effects
models were more efficient for resident fathers
but that fixed effects models should be used for
nonresident fathers (in other words, the error
term is correlated with the predictor variables).
Because we are conceptually interested in
between-father as well as within-father varia-
tion, we present both random and fixed effects
results for both resident and nonresident fathers.
We estimated separate models for resident and
nonresident fathers, pooling across waves based
on residence status at each wave. (Note that
43% of ever-nonresident fathers and 27% of
ever-resident fathers were observed only once
in their respective residence statuses so do not
contribute to the fixed effects estimates.) Given
high correlations among our measures of eco-
nomic resources and involvement (all pairwise
correlations are over .6), we estimated sepa-
rate models for each economic characteristic
predicting each involvement measure.
Results
We first describe patterns of fathers' economic
capacities and direct involvement with children
by residence status at 1, 3, 5, and 9 years fol-
lowing the birth of the focal child (see Table 2).
As expected, we found that resident fathers
had much higher economic capacities and were
much more involved than nonresident fathers;
in other words, children who lived with their
fathers received greater paternal investments
of both money and time. Levels of resident
paternal involvement appeared to be quite stable
over time. By contrast, nonresident fathers'
average earnings and child support payments
increased across waves, partly because formerly
resident fathers entered this group after union
dissolution, whereas paternal time involvement
tended to decrease across waves. Because, as
noted above, the sample of nonresident fathers
becomes more positively selected over time, the
decline we observe is likely underestimated.
We now turn to our multivariate results about
how fathers' economic characteristics and time
involvement are linked. Table 3 shows random
effects and fixed effects results for resident and
nonresident fathers. We remind readers that for
each father-involvement measure (listed down
the left column as Panels A­E) a separate regres-
sion was estimated for each economic variable
and is presented in an individual cell.
Annual earnings are negatively associated
(but not statistically significantly so) with the
resident father spending one or more hours with
the child. (Because the vast majority of resident
fathers spend one or more hours with the child
every day, we reran this analysis using a logit
model with a dichotomous variable; we found
that higher earnings were negatively associated
[p < .05] with the father spending time with the
child every day.) Average weekly hours worked
are significantly and negatively associated with
spending time with the child. For each additional
10 hours worked per week, a father spent 0.0149
fewer units of time with the child--a differ-
ence that is significant but modest (about 3% of
a standard deviation). For paternal engagement
in activities (see Panel B of Table 3), resident
fathers with higher levels of economic invest-
ment are significantly less likely to engage in
activities with the focal child, although the mag-
nitude of the relationships remains modest. Each
additional $10,000 of annual earnings is linked
with a lower score (-0.0316) on the 0-to-7
measure of engagement in father­child activi-
ties (2% of a mean standard deviation). Average
weekly hours worked is associated with lower
engagement (-0.0648, about 4% of a mean stan-
dard deviation). Furthermore, the relationship
between resident fathers' economic capacities
and the 1-to-4 measure of shared responsibility

(Panel C of Table 3) is negative and signifi-
cant across both economic indicators, although
the magnitudes of the associations are also very
small (1%­3% of a standard deviation). Sim-
ilarly, the composite involvement measure (in
standard deviation units) that combines all the
father involvement measures (time, engagement,
and responsibility) into a single measure is con-
sistently, negatively related to both economic
measures. Taken together, these results suggest
that for resident fathers, greater investment in
the labor market is associated with significantly
lower--though very modest in size--levels of
paternal involvement; thus, for resident fathers,
investments in breadwinning and in more direct
involvement with the child appear to operate as
substitutes.
For nonresident fathers, the pattern of results
differs in two ways: father's economic capacities
are mostly positively related with involvement,
and the strength of the association varies by the
particular economic characteristic and type of
involvement being considered. Higher levels of
earnings (0.0364) and child support payments
(0.0055) are significantly and positively associ-
ated with the father being more likely to spend
one or more hours with the child in the past
week--although again of very modest size (2%
or less of a mean standard deviation). For each
additional $100 that the father paid in total child
support in a year, he engaged 0.004 more days in
father­child activities. Nonresident fathers who
paid more in child support also had higher lev-
els of shared responsibility for child rearing and
higher scores on the composite measure of father
involvement. With respect to the number of days
nonresident fathers saw their child in the past
month, both annual earnings and child support
payments are both positively and significantly
related. All associations were miniscule to mod-
est in size.
We also tested whether the estimates for res-
ident versus nonresident fathers were signifi-
cantly different from one another. For all eight
possible comparisons (two independent vari-
ables × four dependent variables) in the random
effects models, we found that all estimates sig-
nificantly differ between resident and nonresi-
dent fathers (p < .05). Because all estimates for
resident fathers are in a negative direction and
all statistically significant estimates for nonresi-
dent fathers are in a positive direction, the signif-
icant difference points to the fact that economic
capacities play a fundamentally different role
in facilitating the time involvement of fathers
depending on whether they live with or away
from their children.
Fixed effects estimates of the relationship
between father's economic characteristics and
involvement--which rely only on within-father
change and hence are more conservative with
respect to causal inference--are also presented
in Table 3. However, this approach eliminates
the between-father comparison that is of overall
interest in this research. For resident fathers, the
results for all measures remained negative and
significant, as with the random effects (though
again, the magnitudes were very small), except
that earnings as linked to responsibility is no
longer statistically significant. These results pro-
vide greater evidence that fathers' investments
of money and time appear to operate as substi-
tutes when fathers live with their child(ren): As
the same resident fathers increase their earnings
and time in the labor market over time, they also
decrease their engagement and overall involve-
ment with the focal child.
For nonresident fathers, some--but not
all--of the fixed effects estimates are also
statistically significant, suggesting that the
random effects results were not entirely due to
differences in characteristics between fathers.
Increases in the amount of child support paid
by nonresident fathers are positively linked with
greater involvement across all five measures.
On average, nonresident fathers who increased
their earnings also increased the number of days
they had seen the child in the past month. These
results suggest that as nonresident fathers'
financial contributions to children increase, their
involvement also increases over time. The sin-
gle exception to this pattern is the link between
average weekly hours worked per week; there
is a significant negative relationship between
increasing hours worked and father­child
engagement.
Again, evaluating whether these point esti-
mates significantly differed between resident
and nonresident fathers, we found that four of
the eight possible comparisons were statisti-
cally significant at p < .05 or below; these all
occurred where the direction of the point esti-
mate was negative for resident fathers but posi-
tive for nonresident fathers. It is not surprising
that there are fewer differences once we ana-
lyze only within-father change, yet where we
did find persisting differences they support our
contention that economic resources may play a
20 Journal of Marriage and Family
different role as linked to direct involvement for
resident versus nonresident fathers.
As a sensitivity analysis, we repeated our
main analyses using fathers' reports of involve-
ment (where available, results not shown); we
found no major differences in the overall rela-
tionship between fathers' economic characteris-
tics and time involvement, and the coefficient
magnitudes were similar. Furthermore, to deter-
mine the extent to which our results are driven
by fathers changing residence categories over
time (mostly as coresident couples broke up),
we conducted a second set of analyses (not
shown) limited to fathers who were stably res-
ident or stably nonresident, that is, those who
lived with the focal child over all of Years 1­9
versus those who never lived with the child.
The results were remarkably similar to our main
results, suggesting that the substantive conclu-
sions are not driven by the changing composition
of the groups, as fathers (primarily) move out
of the child's household. Finally, we also con-
ducted a cluster analysis to evaluate whether our
small but differing correlations of money and
time for resident versus nonresident fathers were
driven by within-group heterogeneity. Using all
five money and time variables, cluster analy-
ses yielded three groups of fathers: nonresi-
dent fathers, higher-earning resident fathers and
lower-earning resident fathers. We then repli-
cated our random and fixed effects analyses sep-
arately by cluster, and the results were very
similar to our main results (and the results for
the two groups of resident fathers did not differ).
Discussion
In this article we have presented new descrip-
tive information about the levels and interre-
lationships of fathers' economic capacities and
time involvement with children among a con-
temporary cohort of urban fathers over child
ages 1­9. As with prior research, we found
that resident fathers had much higher economic
capacities--and displayed much higher levels
of spending time with children, engaging in
father­child activities, and sharing responsibility
for coordinating children's care--than nonresi-
dent fathers (Amato, 1998; Carlson & Berger,
2013). Taken together, our results suggest that
economic capacities and contributions (money)
operate quite differently as related to direct
involvement (time) for resident versus nonresi-
dent fathers. For resident fathers, there appears
to be a trade-off between investments in mar-
ket work and time spent in more direct aspects
of involvement and care: They operate as sub-
stitutes. At higher levels of work effort and
earnings, resident fathers displayed significantly
lower levels of time spent with children, engage-
ment in activities, and shared responsibility. As
such, fathers' investments in financial provision
appear to "count" as investments in children as
collective goods, consistent with the notion of
the "package deal" whereby marriage, father-
ing, and employment go together (Furstenberg
& Cherlin, 1991; Townsend, 2002).
For nonresident fathers, across all the pair-
wise combinations of economic resource mea-
sures and direct involvement measures, there
was only one statistically significant estimate
suggesting that financial investment and time
involvement appeared to operate as substitutes
(hours worked and father­child engagement in
the fixed effects models)--even though greater
time in the labor market necessarily means that
fathers have less available time for other activi-
ties, including parenting. Other than this single
exception, our statistically significant regres-
sion estimates all suggested that greater eco-
nomic capacity and contributions by nonresident
fathers instead "go together" with being involved
in other ways with their children (spending time,
engaging in activities, and sharing responsibil-
ity). Therefore, these two domains of involve-
ment (money and time) appear to operate as
complements for nonresident fathers as such
men do "double duty" to remain involved with
their children.
Taken together, these findings extend our
understanding about how fathers contribute
to children's lives and how their investments
vary--in both level and implications--as a
function of whether they are living with or
living away from their children (and the mothers
of their children). It is important to note that we
cannot identify the direction of this association
here, although prior research that has explicitly
considered the directionality of money and time
investments for nonresident fathers suggests
that child support payments enhance father
contact more than contact enhances payments
(Nepomnyaschy, 2007). Thus, our research
further suggests that, for nonresident fathers,
higher levels of economic resources may be
an important prerequisite for fathers to also
have direct involvement with their children.
Also, we have not considered differences in the
Fathers' Money and Time 21
association as children age--a useful topic for
future research.
From a broader perspective, our results
suggest that differences across fathers in what
they invest in children can contribute to grow-
ing inequalities in the next generation. Men
who share parental investments with biological
mothers in the same household not only have
higher levels of both economic resources and
parental time involvement but also benefit from
the economies of scale that enhance parents'
ability to jointly (and efficiently) allocate the
market work and household investments they
make in their children as a collective good. As
such, men living with children and mothers
have greater flexibility in how they enact the
father role, and they also have more support in
doing so. By contrast, nonresident fathers--who
have lower levels of economic resources--face
higher transaction costs in order to spend time
and engage with their children at the same time
that they have less flexibility in how they invest
as parents.
Although we believe our research provides
a useful extension to the literature, we also
acknowledge several limitations. First, our
results are relevant only to families of children
born in cities of population 200,000 or more.
Second, fathers are typically underrepresented
in national surveys (Nelson, 2004), and the
Fragile Families study also did not interview
some fathers and lost some fathers to attrition
(typically the more disadvantaged fathers); our
results thus cannot estimate the associations of
interest for the missing group of nonresident
fathers. Third, we recognize that fathers may
be involved in other ways that we are not mea-
suring here (e.g., telephone calls, cards/letters,
or e-mail). Fourth, we used mothers' reports
in our main analyses to avoid using the same
reporter for both the independent and dependent
variables, but mothers may not have accurate
information about fathers' involvement, espe-
cially for nonresident fathers (Coley & Morris,
2002). Our mostly similar findings when using
measures based on fathers' reports were thus
reassuring. Fifth, although our methods partially
accounted for unobserved heterogeneity, our
results could still be biased by time-varying
unobserved differences.
In sum, this article has provided new descrip-
tive information about fathers' involvement in
children's lives across residential contexts. We
found important differences in how the father
role is enacted for resident versus nonresident
fathers. Although resident fathers appear to
experience a trade-off between their time in the
labor market and their time directly involved
with children, nonresident fathers' contributions
appear to "go together" such that financial capa-
bilities and contributions serve to increase other
aspects of involvement. Given the low economic
resources of many nonresident fathers, this
circumstance may create challenges for fathers
to remain actively involved in their children's
lives with respect to both money and time, with
long-term implications for children.
