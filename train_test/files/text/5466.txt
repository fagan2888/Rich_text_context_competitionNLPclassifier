Abstract
Objectives: To assess clinical and laboratory parameters associated with metabolic syndrome in
Turkish patients with moderate or severe plaque-type psoriasis and nonpsoriatic controls.
Methods: Patients with moderate or severe plaque psoriasis (patient group) or with nonpsoriatic
dermatological disease (controls) were included. Waist circumference, weight, height and arterial
blood pressure were measured, together with fasting blood glucose, triglyceride, high density
lipoprotein (HDL), fibrinogen, homocysteine and adiponectin levels. Metabolic syndrome was
diagnosed using National Cholesterol Education Program­Adult Treatment Panel III criteria.
Results: Out of 90 patients (50 with psoriasis; 40 controls), metabolic syndrome was more
frequent in the patient group than in controls. In terms of metabolic syndrome parameters, only
hypertension was more frequent in patients with psoriasis compared with controls. There was no
statistically significant difference between the patient and control groups for obesity, hypertrigly-
ceridaemia, HDL levels or hyperglycaemia. Fibrinogen levels were increased and adiponectin levels
were decreased in the psoriasis group. No between-group difference in homocysteine levels was
found.
Conclusion: In this small study, metabolic syndrome was found to be more frequently identified in
Turkish patients with psoriasis than in controls; metabolic syndrome could lead to increased
cardiovascular disease risk in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.

Introduction
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory dis-
ease affecting $0.4­4.7% of the global
population,1 with an aetiopathogenesis that
involves attacks mediated by T-helper 1
immune cells. The immune system is
known to play a major role in the develop-
ment and pathogenesis of psoriasis; how-
ever, despite numerous studies focused on
this disease, the detailed aetiology remains
unknown. It is possible that many condi-
tions involving immune and metabolic dis-
orders underlie psoriasis.
The incidence of cardiovascular disease is
increased in patients with psoriasis2 and the
risk of developing cardiovascular disease is
predominant in young people with psoria-
sis.3 Metabolic syndrome (defined according
to the unified criteria of the International
Diabetes Federation, American Heart
Association, National Heart, Lung and
Blood Institute)4 is characterized by compo-
nents such as dyslipidaemia, obesity, hyper-
tension and insulin resistance. Metabolic
syndrome is a good predictor of cardiovas-
cular disease,4 and the increasing prevalence
of metabolic syndrome constitutes a major
health problem in terms of coronary heart
disease, due to the components involved.
The objectives of the present study were
to assess clinical and laboratory parameters
associated with metabolic syndrome, com-
paring levels between Turkish patients with
moderate or severe plaque-type psoriasis; in
addition, levels of these parameters between
patients with psoriasis and those with non-
psoriatic dermatological disease were also
studied.
Patients and methods
Study population
This cross-sectional study included
Caucasian Turkish patients with moderate
or severe plaque-type psoriasis and patients
with nonpsoriatic dermatological conditions
(controls), who presented at the Dermatol-
ogy Clinic of Gaziantep University, Gazi-
antep, Turkey between January 2010 and
November 2010. Patients !18 years of age
were sequentially enrolled. Specific inclusion
criteria for the patient group were patients
with psoriasis who had a psoriasis area and
severity index (PASI) score !10, and who
had not received any systemic treatment
(including acidretin, cyclosporine, metho-
trexate, phototherapy or biological agents)
within the previous 3 months.5 Specific
inclusion criteria for the control group
were patients diagnosed with verruca vul-
garis, tinea pedis, acne vulgaris, contact
dermatitis, lichen planus, neurodermatitis
or atopic dermatitis. All study participants
provided written informed consent and the
study was approved by the local clinical and
drug investment ethics committee of Gazi-
antep University Faculty of Medicine
(approval No. 09-2008/170).
Study protocol
Psoriasis area and severity index scores were
determined by dividing the body into four
sections: head, H (10% of a person's skin);
arms, A (20%); trunk, T (30%); legs, L
(40%). For each section, the percentage area
of skin involved is estimated then trans-
formed into a grade between 0 and 6: grade
0, 0% of involved area; grade 1, <10% of
involved area; grade 2, 10­29% of involved
area; grade 3, 30­49% of involved area;
grade 4, 50­69% of involved area; grade 5,
70­89% of involved area; grade 6, 90­100%
of involved area. Within each area, psoriasis
severity was estimated by three clinical signs:
erythema (redness), induration (thickness)
and desquamation (scaling). Severity par-
ameters were measured on a scale of 0­4,
where 0 denoted no psoriasis and 4 denoted
maximum severity. The sum of all three
severity parameters was then calculated for
each section of skin, multiplied by the area
score for that area and then multiplied by
Akcali et al. 387
the weight of the respective section (0.1 for
H, 0.2 for A, 0.3 for T and 0.4 for L). Each
area was scored individually, then the four
scores were combined to determine the final
PASI score.
Blood pressure, waist circumference,
body weight and height were measured for
each patient. Serum samples were obtained
for assessment of fasting blood glucose,
triglycerides, high density lipoprotein
(HDL), fibrinogen, homocysteine and adi-
ponectin levels. Blood pressure measure-
ments were performed using an ERKA
meterÕ 3000 mercury sphygmomanometer
(ERKA, Bad To
¨ lz, Germany) with the
patient in a seated position, following
!20 min of rest and no smoking or intake
of caffeine for 24 h prior to the measure-
ment. At 08.00 h, following an overnight
fast, 10-ml venous blood samples were col-
lected from each study participant into
vacutainers without additives. To obtain
serum, blood samples were immediately
processed by allowing blood to clot at
room temperature for 30 min followed by
centrifugation at 3000 g for 5 min at 25C.
Serum samples were analysed immediately
or stored at 4­6C prior to analysis. Serum
levels of homocysteine were assessed using a
high performance liquid chromatography-
based commercial kit (45000 Homocysteine,
Reagent kit for HPLC analysis; Chromsys-
tems Instruments and Chemicals GmbH,
Munich, Germany) according to the manu-
facturer's instructions. Fibrinogen levels
were measured by the Clauss clotting
method6 with Fibri-prestÕ test kits (Diag-
nostica Stago, Asnieres sur Seine, France)
using a Stago STA Compact Coagulation
Analyzer (Diagnostica Stago). Fasting
blood glucose, triglyceride and HDL levels
were measured with commercial test kits
(Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany)
according to the manufacturer's instruc-
tions, using an autoanalyser (Roche/Hitachi
Modular DP Systems, Mannheim,
Germany). Adiponectin levels were assessed
using enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay commercial kits (Zen-Bio, Research
Triangle Park, NC, USA) according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
Patients were required to wear light
clothes for waist circumference measure-
ments, during which the abdomen was
measured at the superior border of the iliac
crest. The measurement was performed fol-
lowing normal exhalation with the patient
free of any compression. Body mass index
(BMI) was calculated by dividing body
weight in kg by height in m. Metabolic
syndrome was diagnosed according to the
National Cholesterol Education Program­
Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP­ATP) III
criteria7 (Table 1).
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses of parameters were per-
formed using the SPSSÕ software package,
version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)

descriptive statistics (mean, SD, SE) in
addition to independent t-test for paired-
group comparisons, 2-test and Fisher's
exact test for comparison of qualitative
data. Results were considered statistically
significant at P < 0.05.
Results
A total of 90 patients were enrolled: 50 with
moderate or severe plaque-type psoriasis
(patient group) and 40 with nonpsoriatic
dermatological conditions (control group).
The patient group comprised 26 male (52%)
and 24 female (48%) patients; the control
group comprised 20 male (50%) and 20
female (50%) patients. In the control group,
15 patients were diagnosed with verruca
vulgaris, seven with tinea pedis, five
with acne vulgaris, five with contact derma-
titis, three with lichen planus, three with
neurodermatitis and two with atopic
dermatitis.
Sex and age distribution patterns were
similar between the two groups. Statistical
analyses of systolic blood pressure, trigly-
cerides, HDL, fasting blood glucose, waist
circumference, BMI, homocysteine, adipo-
nectin and fibrinogen parameters between
both groups showed that systolic blood
pressure (P ¼ 0.01) and fibrinogen
(P < 0.001) levels were higher, and adipo-
nectin levels were lower (P < 0.001), in the
patient group than in the control group.
There were no between-group statistically
significant differences in the other param-
eters measured (Table 2).
Between-group comparisons revealed
a significantly higher prevalence of metabolic
syndrome in the patient group compared
with the control group (25 patients [50%]
with psoriasis versus 10 control group
patients [25%]; P ¼ 0.01, 2 ¼ 5.84; Figure 1).
No statistically significant difference was
found in the prevalence of metabolic syn-
drome between male and female patients
within the patient and control groups.

psoriasis revealed no statistically significant
differences in abdominal obesity, hypertri-
glyceridaemia, HDL, hyperglycaemia or
hypertension levels (Table 3).
Discussion
Patients diagnosed with psoriasis constitute
0.7­1.3% of polyclinic visits in dermatology
departments.8,9 Psoriasis may be associated
with many underlying conditions
involving immune and metabolic disorders.
Population-based studies have shown a
higher risk for mortality in younger patients
with severe psoriasis,10 mainly due to an
increased risk of heart attack associated with
arterial and venous thrombosis.11 The pre-
sent study aimed to compare patients with
moderate or severe plaque-type psoriasis, to
determine the frequency of metabolic syn-
drome parameters, which are known to be
good predictors of cardiovascular disorders.
The study involved a small number of
patients, which led to a large variance in
the data obtained. Indeed, although the
odds ratios (OR) showed positive associ-
ations (e.g. abdominal obesity [OR 1.43]
hypertriglyceridaemia [OR 1.35] and hyper-
tension [OR 1.18]), such differences were not
statistically significant: this may have been
due to the small sample size, which resulted
in wide variations in confidence intervals.
The prevalence of metabolic syndrome
was 33.9% in a Turkish population-based
study and differed significantly between
male (28%) and female (39.6%) partici-
pants.12 The present study revealed no sig-
nificant difference in the presence of
metabolic syndrome between patients
of different sexes. However, the prevalence

nonpsoriatic dermatological conditions. In a total of 25 psoriasis patients and 10 control-group patients (25%)

of metabolic syndrome was higher in the
psoriasis group and lower in the nonpsor-
iasis group, compared with overall preva-
lence of metabolic syndrome reported in the
Turkish study.12 The authors acknowledge
that the choice of control group may have
affected (and could have biased) the present
results. The chosen control group consisted
of other patients receiving dermatology
care, many of whom were also likely to
have low-grade, chronic inflammation that
could have led to metoabolic syndrome.
This means that the present findings may
underestimate the results, because people
with other dermatological conditions may
not be representative of the general popula-
tion. For example, acne is known to be
associated with a heightened prevalencee of
metabolic syndrome.13
To the authors' knowledge, there are no
population-based data relating metabolic
syndrome and psoriasis in the Turkish
population. The existence and magnitude
of an association between metabolic syn-
drome and psoriasis in the general Turkish
population, therefore, remains unknown.
In a US population-based study that also
used NCEP­ATP III criteria, the prevalence
of metabolic syndrome in patients with
psoriasis was 40%, which was similar to
the prevalence found in the present study.14
In addition, the prevalence of metabolic
syndrome in individuals without psoriasis
was approximately half of that found in the
patient group.14
A study in Germany, which compared
541 patients with moderate and severe
plaque-type psoriasis with a control group
of 1 044 subjects,15 the prevalence of meta-
bolic syndrome was 25% in patients
with psoriasis and 11% in the controls.
Prevalence rates for hyperlipidaemia, arter-
ial hypertension, coronary artery disease
and type 2 diabetes were higher in patients
with psoriasis compared with the control
group. Obesity was significantly higher in
male compared with female patients.15 As
with the present study, no difference was
found between male and female patients
with psoriasis, in terms of body weight and
incidence of diabetes and coronary artery
disease. Another study16 compared patients
with moderate (n ¼ 127 706) and severe
(n ¼ 3 854) plaque-type psoriasis with a con-
trol group, and included parameters such as
hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia,
obesity and smoking (all of which are risk
factors for coronary artery disease). In
patients with moderate psoriasis, levels of
diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia,
obesity and smoking were higher compared
with levels observed in the control group.

In patients with severe psoriasis, levels of
diabetes, obesity and smoking were higher
than those observed in the control group.
Furthermore, diabetes and obesity were
more frequently found in patients with
severe compared with moderate psoriasis.
The severity of psoriasis may be associated
with obesity,17,18 although it remains
unclear whether obesity is a cause or an
outcome of psoriasis. In the present study,
the authors did not routinely collect infor-
mation on other possible confounding fac-
tors, such as smoking status.
Unlike other published studies, the pre-
sent study found no difference in BMI and
waist circumference measurements between
the psoriasis and control groups. In accord-
ance with other studies,3,11,12 comparison of
metabolic syndrome parameters between the
moderate and severe psoriasis groups
revealed no differences. However, this may
be due to the relatively small number of
patients in each group, in the present study.
In addition, there was no difference in
HDL and triglyceride levels in patients with
psoriasis compared with controls, in the
present study. Absence of factors such as
obesity and diabetes, which have an impact
on hyperlipidaemia, may account for the
lack of difference in hyperlipidaemia rates
between the groups. In a population-based
comparative study in the UK, no significant
relationship was found between psoriasis
and hyperlipidaemia when factors affecting
lipid levels (such as obesity and diabetes)
were improved in>130 000 patients with
psoriasis.19
Hypertension is reported to be higher in
patients with psoriasis compared with con-
trols.16­20 Echocardiograph and left ven-
tricular abnormalities were also found to
be more frequent in patients with psoria-
sis.20 Similarly, the present study found
systolic and diastolic blood pressure to be
higher in the psoriasis group compared with
in controls. It is likely that hypertension and
psoriasis may share common risk factors.
For example, angiotensin II ­ a product of
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) ­ is
known to regulate vascular tone and stimu-
late the release of proinflammatory cyto-
kines. Increased levels of serum ACE, in
addition to increased serum renin activity,
have been reported in patients with
psoriasis.21,22
In the present study, no differences in
obesity or hyperglycaemia rates were found
between the psoriasis and control groups.
However, serum adiponectin levels were
lower in patients with psoriasis compared
with controls. Adiponectin is a protein-
based hormone, produced naturally by the
body, that reduces blood vessel tissue
inflammation;23 adiponectin levels are
abnormally low in obese patients.24 Lower
serum levels of adiponectin without any
difference in obesity may suggest that the
increased prevalence of cardiovascular dis-
ease in patients with psoriasis is related to
inflammation in the blood vessels. In the
present study, the reduced adiponectin levels
observed in patients in the psoriasis group,
compared with controls, were inversely
correlated with the prevalence of metabolic
syndrome, which was higher in the psoriasis
group, with no difference between male and
female patients. Metabolic syndrome is
known to be more prevalent in male
patients, although the results of the present
study contradict this understanding. This
may be due to an unknown mechanism ­
leading to the development of metabolic
syndrome in patients with psoriasis ­ that
affects both sexes.
Increased levels of plasma fibrinogen and
homocysteine are risk factors for coronary
artery disease.25 An association between
increased plasma levels of fibrinogen and
metabolic syndrome-related factors such as
hyperglycaemia, hypertension and hypertri-
glyceridaemia has been shown in numerous
studies.26­28 The present study found
elevated serum fibrinogen levels in patients
with psoriasis, but no difference in
392 Journal of International Medical Research 42(2)
homocysteine levels. Due to the limited
number of studies, further investigations
into the association between psoriasis and
prothrombotic and proinflammatory cyto-
kines (such as fibrinogen, homocysteine and
adiponectin) are required.
For investigating the possible connec-
tions between psoriasis, cardiovascular dis-
ease and associated risk factors, Miller
et al.29 conducted a meta-analysis of obser-
vational studies using random-effects statis-
tics. Of 835 references obbtained in the
original search, Miller's group identified 75
relevant articles that included 503 686
cases and 29 686 694 controls. They
found that psoriasis was associated
with ischaemic heart disease and cardiovas-
cular risk factors, with the strongest
associations being seen in hospital-based
studies. Population-based studies did not
show significant associations, except for
dyslipidaemia.29
In conclusion, the higher prevalence of
metabolic syndrome observed in patients
with psoriasis in the present study indi-
cates that psoriasis may lead to an
increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
The finding of reduced adiponectin levels
without the presence of obesity may be
important, in relation to the tendency of
patients with psoriasis to develop cardio-
vascular disease. The authors believe that
improvement of modifiable metabolic syn-
drome parameters in patients with psoria-
sis may contribute to a reduction in the
risk of cardiovascular disease. Thus, the
authors suggest that patients with psoria-
sis should be evaluated for systemic par-
ameters in addition to skin lesions, and
consultations with specialists other than
dermatologists should be sought when
appropriate.
