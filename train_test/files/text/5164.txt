Introduction
The prevalence of diabetes worldwide was estimated at
131 million in 2000 and is forecast to increase to 366 mil-
lion by 2030.1 In the UK, 2.8 million people were regis-
tered as having diabetes in 2010.2 Patients with diabetes
are at increased risk of developing neuropathy, periph-
eral arterial disease and infections and are therefore at
high risk of developing foot pathologies including ulcer-
ation. The results of cross-sectional community surveys
in the UK showed that 7.4% of patients with diabetes had
a history of active or previous foot ulcers.3 They have up
to 25% lifetime risk of developing foot ulcers,4 which
have a high risk of deteriorating and ultimately leading
to major lower limb amputation. DFUs precede 84% of
amputations, and nearly one in six patients with DFUs
eventually require an amputation.5,6 The incidence of
major lower limb amputation in people with diabetes is
between 0.5 and 5.0 per 1,000 people and survival after a
major lower limb amputation is poor, with a periopera-
tive mortality of 10­15% in the UK.3
Evaluation of DFUs includes vascular and neurologi-
cal examinations as well as accurate wound assessment.
Successful management of DFUs consists of offloading
with appropriate devices, management of infection,
wound care including debridement and revascularisa-
tion when indicated. DFUs are usually associated with
infection and inflammation which lead to oedema of
the foot. Currently, most appliances use function only
to alleviate mechanical load on ulcers and do not
actively address the associated oedema, which can
potentially be detrimental to ulcer healing. The objec-
tive of this article is to review the association of foot
oedema and DFUs, including the role of appliances
which reduce oedema.

Abstract
Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are common and disabling, giving rise to significant morbidity and mortality as well as
worldwide socioeconomic problems. Despite treatment, DFUs readily become chronic wounds and may lead to major
lower limb amputations. The pathogenesis of DFUs is complex and the main aetiologies are peripheral neuropathy,
ischaemia from peripheral arterial disease and biomechanical abnormalities. Microvascular disease is also a significant
problem for people with diabetes and contributes to foot ulceration. Successful management of DFUs consists of
debridement, infection control, the use of offloading appliances and revascularisation where necessary. Foot ulcers are
usually associated with infection and inflammation which lead to surrounding oedema of the foot. Standard offloading
devices such as total contact casts and removable cast walkers do not actively reduce foot oedema.There is promising
evidence that active oedema reduction by intermittent pneumatic compression in the diabetic foot improves ulcer
healing.The objective of this article is to review the association of foot oedema and DFUs,including the role of appliances
which reduce oedema.The information presented is vital to those involved in the management of DFUs.

diabetic foot ulceration are peripheral neuropathy, isch-
aemia, foot deformity and infections7 caused by the pro-
duction of advanced glycation end products secondary
to hyperglycaemia. The incidence of neuroischaemic
ulcers is 52.3%, neuropathic ulcers 36% and ischaemic
ulcers 11.7%.8 Neuropathy includes sensory, motor and
autonomic components. Deficient protective sensation
leads to ulceration on high pressure areas; motor neu-
ropathy results in biomechanical abnormalities and
autonomic neuropathy causes decreased sweating and
dry skin which is more prone to hyperkeratosis and
ulceration. Ischaemia is caused by peripheral arterial dis-
ease, resulting in decreased blood supply and tissue per-
fusion, which significantly compromise ulcer healing.
Peripheral arterial disease in patients with diabetes
tends to be multifocal and commonly affects the infra-
popliteal vessels. Furthermore, disease progression is
usually accelerated,9 and together with microvascular dis-
ease, results in poor outcomes. Endothelial dysfunction
appears to be the main cause of both the macrovascular
and microvascular disease and mechanisms which
contribute to this include persistent hyperglycaemia,
increased advanced glycation end-products, oxidative
stress, endothelial inflammation and reduced nitric oxide
activity.10,11 In addition, an increase in thromboxane A2, a
vasoconstrictor and platelet aggregation agonist, has been
associated with hyperglycaemia in diabetes, leading to an
increased risk of plasma hypercoagulability.12
Impaired wound healing has also been implicated in
patients with diabetes. The normal wound healing pro-
cess entails a complex interplay between connective tis-
sue formation, cellular activity, and growth factor
activation. All three of these physiologic processes are
altered in the diabetic state and contribute to the poor
healing of DFUs.13 Instead of progressing through the
normal stages of wound healing, it is now clear that dia-
betic ulcers remain in the inflammatory phase of the
wound healing process. During this delay, there is a ces-
sation of epidermal growth and migration over the
wound surface.14,15
Analysis of fluid from these chronic wounds has dem-
onstrated elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinases
directly resulting in increased proteolytic activity and
inactivation of the growth factors that are necessary for
proper wound healing. Additionally, these chronic
wounds have been found to exhibit deficiencies in growth
factors and cytokines along with elevated levels of inhib-
itory proteases.13 Therefore, impaired wound healing is
manifested in aberrant protein synthesis, cellular activity
and growth factor secretion.
Classification systems have been developed to grade
the severity of diabetic foot ulcers, provide prognosis on
healing and aid in the formulation of treatment plans.
The widely used Wagner classification for diabetic foot
ulcers (table 1) assesses ulcer depth and the presence of
osteomyelitis or gangrene.16 The University of Texas sys-
tem assesses ulcer depth, the presence of wound infec-
tion, and the presence of clinical signs of lower-extremity
ischaemia.17 This system uses a matrix of grade on the
horizontal axis and stage on the vertical axis (table 2). A
prospective study of 194 patients comparing the two dia-
betic foot ulcer classifications concluded that the
University of Texas classification is a better predictor of
outcome.18 Increasing stage, regardless of grade, is asso-
ciated with increased risk of amputation and prolonged
ulcer healing time. Recently, the Kobe classification has
been proposed which focuses on the main aetiology of
ulcers and proposes appropriate treatment (table 3)19.
These classification systems illustrate the complexity
and multi-aetiological nature of diabetic foot ulcers.
Table 1.Wagner classification for diabetic foot ulcers
Grade Description of ulcer
0 intact skin in patients who are at risk
I superficial ulcers with exposed subcutaneous tissue
II exposed tendon and deep structures
III ulcers extend to the deep tissue and have either
associated soft tissue abscess or osteomyelitis
IV ulcers include feet with partial gangrene
V feet ulcers with more extensive gangrenous tissue
Table 2.The University of Texas system
Grade Description of ulcer
0 an epithelialised wound
1 superficial ulcers not involving tendon, capsule, or bone
2 ulcers penetrate to tendon or capsule
3 ulcers penetrate to bone or joint
Within each wound grade there are four stages: stage A are clean
wounds which are not infected and non-ischaemic; stage B ulcers are
infected but not ischaemic; stage C ulcers are ischaemic but not infected;
and stage D ulcers are both infected and ischaemic. Increasing stage,
regardless of grade, is associated with increased risk of amputation and
prolonged ulcer healing time.
Table 3. Kobe classification
Type Aetiology and treatment of ulcer
1 ulcers are mainly caused by peripheral neuropathy and
are treated by pressure relief
2 ulcers mainly result from peripheral arterial disease
and the main treatment is revascularisation
3 ulcers have infection as the main aetiology and require
early debridement
4 ulcers are caused by a combination of all three factors,
i.e. peripheral neuropathy, peripheral arterial disease
and infection, and are treated by revascularisation and
debridement on a case-by-case basis
Ho et al. 47
However, none of the many grading systems take into
account any associated oedema of the foot, illustrating
that this remains a poorly understood aspect of DFUs.
Diabetic foot ulcers and oedema
The involvement of the microcirculation in diabetic
microangiopathy contributes to foot ulceration. In addi-
tion, diabetic microangiopathy, characterised by an
increase in skin flux at rest, decreased veno-arteriolar
response, and increased capillary permeability results in
oedema, reduced skin partial oxygen tension and
increased carbon dioxide tension.20 In this condition,
capillary exchange is altered and nutritional alterations
eventually lead to skin lesions and ulcers.
The postural regulation of blood flow is impaired in
patients with diabetic neuropathy. This disturbance is
compatible with a loss of sympathetic vascular tone and
arteriovenous shunting.21,22 In particular, the capability
of effective precapillary vasoconstriction on standing is
reduced. This exposes the capillary bed to a high hydro-
static load, resulting in hyperperfusion and increased
shear force in the microcirculation on dependency which
in turn leads to thickening of the capillary basement
membrane and oedema of the feet and lower legs.23
In a prospective study of 314 patients with DFUs, the
presence of oedema indicated a poorer prognosis24:
peripheral oedema was more common in patients who
required amputation (58%) or died (55%) than in patients
with primary healing (26%, p<0.001). A tentative predis-
posing factor was identified in 95% of the patients, the
most common factors being neuropathy, congestive heart
failure, and previous deep venous thrombosis.
The principles of management of DFUs include
proper assessment and treatment of different lesions of
the foot, including infection control, debridement,
wound management, revascularisation, other surgery,
metabolic control and off-loading. Compression therapy
may be used to reduce lower limb oedema to aid ulcer
healing.Layeredcompressiontherapyand,morerecently,
diabetic socks with mild compression have been found
to be safe and effective in diabetic patients with adequate
or mildly reduced arterial blood supply.25,26 The follow-
ing sections further discuss the two methods associated
with oedema reduction, offloading and compression
therapy, in the management of DFUs.
Offloading devices in the
management of DFUs
Appropriate offloading is a key component in the man-
agement of diabetic foot disease. The use of TCCs has
been reported to result in excellent ulcer healing rates
and associated with faster healing compared to other
removable devices in a randomised controlled trial.27
The TCC is considered to be the gold standard offload-
ing device for plantar neuropathic ulcers, yet it is still not
widely used in clinical practice.28 It works by transmit-
ting load from the forefoot to the heel and directly to the
leg via the cast walls.29 Its main disadvantage is that its
application is time-consuming and often associated with
a learning curve. Most centres do not have a physician or
cast technician available with adequate training or expe-
rience to safely apply TCCs. Moreover, TCCs do not
allow assessment of the foot or wound on a daily basis
and are therefore often contraindicated in cases of soft
tissue infections or osteomyelitis.
Iatrogenic ulceration where ulceration occurs whilst
within the cast due to pressure or friction from cast
materials is a concern, but the risks are reduced by proper
casting techniques.30,31 Other patient complaints include
impaired activities of daily living, such as difficulty sleep-
ing comfortably, and bathing difficulties while trying to
avoid getting the cast wet, which reduce patient concord-
ance. Certain designs of TCCs may also exacerbate pos-
tural instability.32
Removable cast walkers are cast-like devices that are
removable to allow inspection of the wound and applica-
tion of topical therapies. Further, removable cast walkers
can be easily converted into instant total contact casts by
wrapping the removable cast walker with cohesive band-
age or plaster of Paris.33 Wound healing efficacy of
instant TCCs has been demonstrated to be comparable
to TCCs in several randomized controlled trials.34,35
Although these standard offloading devices are
believed to reduce oedema by enabling patients to remain
relatively mobile, there has been no objective published
data confirming this. Instead, immobilisation of the
ankle with reduced function of the calf muscles which
act as a venous pump, can theoretically impair venous
return and potentially result in increased foot oedema.
Reducing oedema in the
management of DFUs
In managing DFUs, foot elevation has generally been
recommended to reduce oedema and prevent other
sequential problems. However, foot elevation may
decrease tissue oxygenation of the foot relative to the
dependent position, which allows an increase in blood
flow within the arterial system. The transcutaneous par-
tial oxygen tension has been shown to be reduced on foot
elevation of patients with DFUs.36
In diabetic patients with lower limb oedema, mild
compression therapy (18­25 mmHg) applied via socks
or hosiery during the day was found to decrease calf and
foot swelling by reducing oedema, without compromis-
ing vascularity in a study of 18 patients who have normal

arterial circulation.26 In the treatment of DFUs, compres-
sion therapy has been used effectively and safely to
reduce oedema in a diabetic population with adequate
arterial circulation whilst reduced compression was ben-
eficial in patients with arterial compromise in a prospec-
tive clinical case review involving 44 patients.25 Patients
with adequate arterial circulation were treated with a
four-layer compression bandage system while the highly
elastic third layer was excluded in the patients who had
compromised peripheral arterial circulation. Healing
occurred in 81% of patients with adequate peripheral
arterial circulation and 67% of patients with compro-
mised peripheral arterial circulation. There was no acute
progression of lower limb ischaemia in the study.
However, patients with diabetes have a high risk of devel-
oping peripheral arterial disease and many clinicians
may be reluctant to use compression therapy.
The use of intermittent pneumatic compression by
the A-V Impulse System has been shown to be safe and
effective in other clinical areas such as the reduction of
posttraumatic swelling and postoperative swelling fol-
lowing ankle and femoral neck fractures where the rate
of proximal deep vein thrombosis was also reduced.37-39
The A-V Impulse System was developed to mimic the
natural physiological processes which maintain blood
flow and has been shown to improve venous return and
arterial blood flow in the extremities.40,41
The proposed mechanism of action is that intermit-
tent pneumatic compression leads to improved emptying
of the lower extremity veins and lowered venous pressure
which in turn results in an increase in arterio-venous
pressure gradient and an increase in lower extremity
arterial blood flow.42-44 In a cohort study of 40 lower
limbs of 30 subjects, the application of intermittent
pneumatic compression to calf and foot greatly enhanced
popliteal artery blood flow. It was suggested that the flow
increase is due to a dramatic drop in the peripheral vas-
cular resistance as the peak systolic and end diastolic
flow velocities increase and the reverse-flow component
diminishes.45 A direct reduction in peripheral resistance
has also been postulated with intermittent pneumatic
compression via release of nitric oxide, secondary to
shear stress increase in the venous radicles. The action of
diffused nitric oxide on adjacent arteriolar resistance
vessels causes them to dilate transiently with concurrent
flow enhancement.46
As discussed previously, there is evidence that in
patients with diabetes, peripheral arterial disease is more
aggressive, difficult to manage and associated with poorer
outcomes.47 A systematic review demonstrated that
an intermittent pneumatic compression programme
appeared promising and may be used in patients
with severe peripheral arterial disease who were not can
didates for surgical or endovascular revascularization.
Claudication distance, rest pain, and rates of limb salvage
were improved across the spectrum of trials performed,
associated with increased arterial blood flow, peak systolic
velocity, end diastolic velocity and pulse volume.48 A small
randomized study with 12 months follow-up (n=30) in
patients with stable intermittent claudication concluded
that walking distance improved in these patients.49 In
addition to improved walking distance in stable claudi-
cants, a prospective randomised controlled study with 1
year follow-up found an improvement in the ankle bra-
chial pressure index, which is a measurement of periph-
eral haemodynamics, and improvement in quality of life.50
A more recent study in patients with chronic lower
limb ischaemia found a significant improvement in
wound healing and limb salvage rates in the treated
group. The intermittent pneumatic compression was
delivered at an inflation pressure of 85­95mmHg, applied
for 2 seconds with rapid rise (0.2 seconds), three cycles
per minute, for three 2-hourly sessions per day.51
In DFUs, a double blind randomised controlled trial
with 12 weeks follow-up also showed that oedema reduc-
tion by a pneumatic foot compression system increased
the proportion of wound healing.52 Fifty-nine patients
with diabetes were allocated to receive a functioning pul-
satile pneumatic foot compression system achieved by
way of a pump and wrap system following debridement
of infected foot ulcers. The system included a bladder
containing a foot wrap and a pump that intermittently
fired bursts of air through tubing to the wrap, thereby
emptying the foot veins. This group was compared
against a placebo group of 56 patients who received a
non-functioning device. Patients were asked to use the
device 8 hours a day, in addition to weekly standard
wound care that included wound debridement and off-
loading. Patients treated with active foot compression
had a 75% healing rate compared with 51% in the pla-
cebo group (p<0.02; odds ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence
interval, 1.2­6.8) and a greater degree of oedema reduc-
tion as shown by mean foot circumference measure-
ments (23.8 vs. 25.7 cm, p<0.001) than those in the
placebo group. However, a substantial number of patients
in both groups found that it was inconvenient to have the
device on and elevate their legs for 8 hours a day.
It would therefore appear that an intermittent pneu-
matic compression device with offloading property will
have a potential combined effect of oedema reduction
and offloading of high pressure areas, both of which are
likely to improve diabetic foot ulcer healing. Randomised
clinical trials, looking at a range of DFUs, are warranted
to assess these effects on ulcer healing.
Conclusion
Treatment of oedema may further improve the outcomes
of DFUs, over and above standard therapy. A device
which is comfortable to increase concordance, able to
Ho et al. 49
provide intermittent pneumatic compression to actively
reduce oedema, and allow offloading can be useful for
this purpose but further investigation will be required to
provide a strong level of evidence.
