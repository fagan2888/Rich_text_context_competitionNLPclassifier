Abstract
Background: Smoking has been associated with a range of mental disorders including
schizophrenia, anxiety disorders and depression. People with mental illness have high rates of
morbidity and mortality from smoking related illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory
diseases and cancer. As many people who meet diagnostic criteria for mental disorders do not seek
treatment for these conditions, we sought to investigate the relationship between mental illness
and smoking in recent population-wide surveys.
Methods: Survey data from the US National Comorbidity Survey-Replication conducted in 2001­
2003, the 2007 Australian Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing, and the 2007 US National Health
Interview Survey were used to investigate the relationship between current smoking, ICD-10
mental disorders and non-specific psychological distress. Population weighted estimates of smoking
rates by disorder, and mental disorder rates by smoking status were calculated.
Results: In both the US and Australia, adults who met ICD-10 criteria for mental disorders in the
12 months prior to the survey smoked at almost twice the rate of adults without mental disorders.
While approximately 20% of the adult population had 12-month mental disorders, among adult
smokers approximately one-third had a 12-month mental disorder ­ 31.7% in the US (95% CI:
29.5%­33.8%) and 32.4% in Australia (95% CI: 29.5%­35.3%). Female smokers had higher rates of
mental disorders than male smokers, and younger smokers had considerably higher rates than
older smokers. The majority of mentally ill smokers were not in contact with mental health
services, but their rate of smoking was not different from that of mentally ill smokers who had
accessed services for their mental health problem. Smokers with high levels of psychological
distress smoked a higher average number of cigarettes per day.
Conclusion: Mental illness is associated with both higher rates of smoking and higher levels of
smoking among smokers. Further, a significant proportion of smokers have mental illness.
Strategies that address smoking in mental illness, and mental illness among smokers would seem to
be important directions for tobacco control. As the majority of smokers with mental illness are not
in contact with mental health services for their condition, strategies to address mental illness
should be included as part of population health-based mental health and tobacco control efforts.

Background
Smoking remains one of the leading causes of preventable
disease and death both in Australia and the United States
[1,2]. Efforts to reduce the prevalence of smoking con-
tinue to be of public health significance. The association
between smoking and mental illness has been known and
studied for many years, but the focus of much of the work
in this field has been on people with severe mental illness,
such as schizophrenia, or people being treated by psychi-
atric services [3-8]. For instance, a recent meta-analysis by
de Leon and Diaz of 42 individual studies reported that
people with schizophrenia had odds of smoking 5.3 (95%
CI: 4.9­5.7) times higher than the general population [9].
Glassman et al reported an association between smoking
and major depression from the St Louis Epidemiological
Catchment Area Survey [10]. Lasser et al reported the first
major population study in the US showing the substantial
proportion of smokers who met DSM-III-R criteria for
mental disorders, many of whom were not in contact with
mental health services [11,12]. They reported that people
with DSM-III-R mental illnesses in the month prior to the
survey had a smoking rate twice as high as people with no
mental illness, and consumed an estimated 44% of ciga-
rettes smoked by adults in the United States.
The excess mortality among people with mental illness
due to common conditions for which smoking is a known
risk factor, such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory dis-
ease and cancers, has been extensively described, from
both service-based and community-based samples, and
there is evidence of a growing disparity in mortality rates
between those with and without mental illness [13-17].
For example, in Western Australia, cardiovascular mortal-
ity fell significantly in the general population between
1980­1998, but there was no decline among people with
mental disorders [18]. One possible explanation for this
phenomenon may be that the public health interventions
that have helped to reduce cardiovascular mortality in the
general community, such as the efforts that have reduced
the prevalence of smoking in both Australia and the US,
may have been less effective among people who have
mental illness.
It has been hypothesised that one reason for the strong
association between mental illness and current smoking is
that mental illness is a factor in smoking initiation.
Depression and anxiety in teenagers have been found to
be strong predictors of smoking experimentation and the
transition to daily smoking [19-21]. However, smoking
has also been associated with the onset of psychiatric
symptoms in teenagers [21,22]. This has suggested that
smoking and depressive and/or anxiety symptoms may
have onset around the same time, possibly associated
with common prior causes [23-25]. However, controlling
for common causal factors does not completely remove
the predictive ability of smoking on mental illness, partic-
ularly depression and anxiety and vice versa. This suggests
the possibility that separate causal mechanisms may oper-
ate in both directions, in addition to the predictive ability
of common causal factors [21,26-28].
The large overlap between mental illness and smoking is
not entirely surprising considering the known effects of
nicotine on the brain. Nicotine is a psychostimulant that
effects several neuroregulators that influence behaviour
and mood [29,30]. In some circumstances, nicotine can
relieve symptoms of both depression and anxiety [31,32].
Nicotine cessation can also precipitate depressive symp-
toms, particularly in people with a history of major
depression [33,34]. However, it has been questioned
whether these are independent depressive symptoms or
unpleasant withdrawal symptoms [35,36]. The onset of
depressive symptoms following smoking cessation has
been linked with lower quit rates, and most commonly
occurs in people with depression [37-39]. These factors
have lead to the self-medication hypothesis ­ that smok-
ers with mental illness choose to smoke because it is the
easiest, most readily accessible way to control symptoms
of mental illness, especially for those who are not receiv-
ing any prescribed form of treatment for their mental
health condition [40].
While the self-medication theory implies there is a thera-
peutic benefit to smoking which people with depressive
or anxiety symptoms find helpful, research suggests that
smoking provides temporary relief from immediate symp-
toms, while overall creating a greater level of anxiety and
stress [31,35,41]. Thus the alleviation of stress and anxiety
by smoking may be part of the withdrawal feedback
mechanism. It has been suggested that the self-medication
hypothesis has too often been used as a justification for
not acting to curb cigarette smoking in this population
despite the fact that nicotine is not regarded as the most
appropriate therapy for any mental health problem, and
that even if it were, cigarettes would not be an appropriate
form of administering it [37].
The study of Lasser et al was based on data from the US
National Comorbidity Survey which was collected in
1992. Smoking rates have been in decline in the US since
that time [42]. More current data are now available with
the release of the public use file from the US National
Comorbidity Study-Replication which was conducted
between 2001 and 2003, and data from the 2007 Austral-
ian Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing. We hypothe-
sised that despite the decline in overall smoking rates in
both the US and Australia since 1992, people with mental

illness would continue to represent a disproportionally
high number of smokers.
We used data from two recent nationally representative
surveys that employed the WHO Composite International
Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) to estimate prevalence of
mental health disorders among smokers­the National
Comorbidity Study-Replication in the US and the 2007
Australian Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing. We
also examined data from the annual US National Health
Interview Survey, which has used a short measure of psy-
chological distress as a proxy of severe mental illness, to
examine whether it would be feasible to monitor the rela-
tionship between mental illness and smoking as part of
routine surveillance systems.
Methods
Data sources
Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (SMHWB)
The Australian SMHWB was conducted by the Australian
Bureau of Statistics (ABS) between August and December
2007 [43]. It comprised a nationally representative sam-
ple of 8,841 adults aged 16­85 years living in private
dwellings, drawn using a stratified multistage area-based
sample design. The survey was conducted by personal
interview. The survey measured the prevalence of three
major groups of disorders ­ anxiety disorders, affective
disorders and substance use disorders ­ using Version 3 of
the CIDI [44]. Full details of the survey methodology have
been published elsewhere [45].
National Comorbidity Study Replication (NCS-R)
The US NCS-R was a nationally representative probability
sample of 9,282 individuals conducted by means of per-
sonal interviews by the Institute for Social Research at the
University of Michigan [46]. The survey measured the
prevalence of most DSM-IV and ICD-10 mental disorders
using Version 3 of the CIDI. The NCS-R employed a strat-
ified multistage area-based sampling design. A long-form/
short-form approach was used with all 9,282 respondents
completing part one of the questionnaire covering the
core CIDI disorders, while a sub-sample completed part
two (n = 5,692), which covered risk factors, consequences,
service use and disorders of secondary importance or
those that were time-consuming to administer. Of the dis-
orders used in this study, all the affective disorders and all
of the anxiety disorders except for post-traumatic stress
disorder were included in the part one questionnaire,
while the substance use disorders and post-traumatic
stress disorder have been estimated using the part two
sample. Due to a problem with questionnaire sequencing
the diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder could not
be extracted from the NCS-R data. Full details of the sur-
vey methodology and procedures have been published
previously [47,48].
National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)
The US NHIS is an annual survey conducted by means of
personal interview by the National Center for Health Sta-
tistics [49]. The NHIS uses a multistage area-based proba-
bility sampling design. The survey has three basic
components, the family component, the sample child and
the sample adult. The family component collects informa-
tion on household composition, demographic character-
istics and basic health indicators. For each selected family,
one child and one adult are selected to complete more
detailed questionnaires. For this study, data was taken
from the 2007 sample adult component which includes
measures of smoking status and level of psychological dis-
tress. There were 23,393 sample adults in the 2007 NHIS.
As the study consisted of analysis of publicly available
confidentialised files, no institutional ethics approval was
required.
Measures
Mental illness
Mental disorders were assessed in the NCS-R and SMHWB
using Version 3 of the CIDI [44]. The CIDI is a fully struc-
tured interview questionnaire which was administered in
both surveys by lay interviewers using computer assisted
interviewing software. The CIDI is designed to cover the
diagnostic criteria for mental disorders in both the Inter-
national Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-
10), and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) [50,51]. The CIDI
includes an initial screener for major symptoms of mental
disorders followed by detailed questions on each disor-
der. The average interview time in the SMHWB was 90
minutes with the majority of the time taken up by the
administration of the CIDI. For this paper we have used
the ICD-10 diagnoses rather than the DSM-IV diagnoses
as results from the Australian SMHWB have only been
released on the ICD-10 basis to date.
In the NHIS, specific mental disorders are not assessed.
Instead the NHIS employs a short measure of non-specific
psychological distress, the Kessler 6 scale [52,53]. This
scale was specifically designed to be sensitive to the upper
90th-99th percentile range of population distribution of
mental disorders. Within this range it has high discrimina-
tion.
Tobacco use
In the NCS-R, current smokers were identified from
responses to the question "are you a current smoker, ex-
smoker, or have you never smoked?" In the SMHWB,
respondents were asked "do you currently smoke every
day, at least weekly, less than weekly, or not at all?" In the
NHIS, the sample adult was asked "do you now smoke
cigarettes every day, some days or not at all?" For consist-
BMC Public Health 2009, 9:285 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/9/285

(page number not for citation purposes)
ency with the NCS-R, current smokers were taken as those
who smoked daily or less than daily.
Service use
In the SMHWB, respondents were given the definition
"The next few questions are about problems with your
mental health. This includes but is not restricted to such
things as stress, anxiety, depression or dependence on
alcohol or drugs." Respondents were then asked how
often they accessed the following health services for prob-
lems with their mental health in the 12 months prior to
the survey: general practitioner, psychiatrist, psychologist,
mental health nurse or other professional providing spe-
cialist mental health services, or other health professional
including medical specialist, other professional providing
general services or complementary and alternative thera-
pist.
Weighted estimates and standard errors
Survey weights were applied to calculate estimates of
totals and proportions. These weights have been calcu-
lated to adjust for potential non-response. For the NCS-R,
the supplied weights had been normalised to sum to the
sample size, whereas the weights supplied with the
SMHWB sum to the population size. We re-weighted the
NCS-R data by multiplying the normalised weights by a
constant factor so that the weights summed to the popu-
lation size. This adjustment to the weights has no effect on
estimates or standard errors for proportions. Standard
errors and confidence intervals for the NCS-R and the
NHIS were calculated adjusting for the complex nature of
the sample design using expansion in Taylor series [54].
Standard errors and confidence intervals for the SMHWB
were calculated using the jack-knife method of replicate
weighting [54].
Modelling the relationship between smoking and
psychological distress
The NHIS assessed the level of non-specific psychological
distress using the K6 scale, which generates a score
between 0 and 24. We used logistic regression modelling
to assess the relationship between psychological distress
score, and probability of being a smoker. As logistic
regression models the log of the odds ratio, we did not
enter the K6 score as a linear variable in the model as that
would imply an exponential relationship between K6
score and probability of smoking. With no theoretical
basis to assume a particular shape for the relationship, we
used the generalised additive models (GAM) framework
to fit a non-parametric spline curve to describe the rela-
tionship [55]. Similarly we used GAMs when using regres-
sion to model the average number of cigarettes smoked
per day by level of psychological distress. All of the statis-
tical analyses were undertaken using SAS software, Ver-
sion 9.1 [56].
Results
Mental illness and smoking in Australian adults
From the 2007 SMHWB, the ABS estimated that 20% of
the adult population had a mental illness in the 12
months prior to the survey (95% CI: 18.9%­21.1%). Of
those adults with a mental illness, 1 156 600 were current
smokers ­ a smoking prevalence of 36.2% (95% CI:
32.9%­39.6%), almost double the 18.8% smoking prev-
alence among adults with no mental illness (95% CI:
17.2%­20.4%). In total, 3 566 800 adults were current
smokers in 2007, and people with mental illness repre-
sented 32.4% (95% CI: 29.5%­35.3%) of current smok-
ers. In contrast, only 15.6% (95% CI: 29.5%­35.3%) of
people who have never smoked had a mental illness in the
12 months prior to the survey.
Mental illness and smoking in non-institutionalised adults
in the US
Basing mental illness diagnosis on ICD-10, and using as
similar as possible definitions of disorders as was applied
in the Australian study, we estimated that 19.7% of the US
adult civilian non-institutionalised population had a
mental illness in the 12 months prior to the survey, con-
ducted in 2001­2003 (95% CI: 18.9%­20.6%). Among
those adults with a mental illness, 40.1% were current
smokers (95% CI: 37.6%­42.7%) which was almost dou-
ble the 21.3% smoking prevalence in adults with no 12-
month mental illness (95% CI: 20.1%­22.5%). People
with mental illness represented 31.7% of current smokers
(95% CI: 29.5%­33.8%), or 16.1 million people out of
an estimated total 51.0 million adult smokers in the US.
In contrast, only 15.1% of people who had never smoked
had a mental illness in the 12 months prior to the survey
(95% CI: 13.8%­16.4%).
In both the US and Australia, smoking rates were highest
among those with substance use disorders, where around
two-thirds of sufferers were current smokers (Tables 1 and
2). In the US, 45.1% of adults with affective disorders
smoked (95% CI: 41.1%­49.2%), and 37.6 of adults with
anxiety disorders smoked (95% CI: 34.6%­40.7%), com-
pared with 21.3% of adults with no 12-month mental dis-
order (95% CI: 20.1%­22.5%).
Age, mental illness and smoking
In both the US and Australia, smokers aged 16­24 years,
who are likely to have started smoking most recently, had
the highest rates of mental illness (Figures 1 and 2). In
Australia, 37.2% of male smokers aged 16­24 years (95%
CI: 28.0%­46.4%) and 58.7% of female smokers in this
BMC Public Health 2009, 9:285 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/9/285

(page number not for citation purposes)
age group (95% CI: 48.7%­68.5%) had a 12-month men-
tal disorder.
Age, mental illness, comorbid substance use and smoking
The mental disorders shown in Tables 1, 2 &3 are not
mutually exclusive categories. An individual may have
more than one disorder. As smoking rates were so high
among those with alcohol or drug disorders, we investi-
gated the extent to which comorbid substance use was
associated with the rates of smoking for people with anx-
iety and affective disorders. Table 4 presents the propor-
tions of the Australian population in each age and sex
category who have anxiety or affective disorders with and
without comorbid substance use. The smoking rate within
each group is also shown. Among those with comorbid
substance use disorders, the smoking rate is consistently
high across age and sex group, except for males aged 55
years and over. However, only a minority of those with
either anxiety or affective disorders also have comorbid
substance use disorders. Although confidence intervals
are wide for some groups, smoking rates remain elevated
in those without comorbid substance use disorders.
Comorbid substance use disorders were most common in
younger adults, particularly males.
Use of services
Of the 1 156 600 Australian smokers who had a 12-month
mental disorder, as estimated in the SMHWB, 740 000 did
not access any health services for their mental health
problems in the 12 months prior to the survey (64.0%,
95% CI: 55.4%­72.0%). The smoking rate was not sub-
stantively different between those people with 12-month
mental disorder who did or did not access services. Of
people with 12-month mental disorder who did not use
any services, 35.4% were current smokers (95% CI:
31.2%­39.6%), while 37.7% of those with 12-month
mental disorder who did use one or more services in the
past 12 months were current smokers (95% CI: 32.9%­
42.5%). Thus people with 12-month mental disorder who
did not have contact with services in the past 12 months
represent 20.7% of all current smokers in Australia (95%
CI: 18.2%­23.3%).
Non-specific psychological distress and smoking
Figure 3 shows the relationship between level of psycho-
logical distress (measured using the Kessler 6 scale) and
smoking rates in the US adult population. Although males
have a higher rate of current smoking than females, the
shape of the association is the same for both sexes. For

both sexes, both the linear and non-linear components of
the fitted curves were statistically significant (p < 0.01)
indicating both that the increase in smoking rate with
increasing level of non-specific psychological distress is
significantly greater than zero, and that the deviation of
the curve from the linear fit for scores above 13 is statisti-
cally significant. On the Kessler 6 scale, scores above 13
are generally considered to represent serious psychologi-
cal distress likely to require intervention from mental
health services.
By age group, large increases in smoking rates with
increasing level of non-specific psychological distress are
seen for younger people, with the proportion of smokers
increasing from 18% to 50% among people aged 18­44
years, and increasing from 17% to 42% for adults aged
45­64 years. Smaller changes were observed in adults
aged 65 and over with the smoking rate peaking at 14%
(Figure 4). For all three age groups both the linear and
non-linear components of the regression curves were sta-
tistically significant (p < 0.01).
The average number of cigarettes smoked per day by cur-
rent smokers increased with level of psychological dis-
tress, from 12 per day among smokers with no
psychological distress, to 19 per day among smokers with
serious psychological distress (Figure 5). Both the linear
and non-linear components of the regression curve were
statistically significant (p < 0.01) indicating that the
increase in number of cigarettes smoked by level of psy-
chological distress is unlikely to be attributable to chance
alone.
Discussion
The figures shown here from the latest population surveys
in the United States and Australia are consistent with pre-
vious reports showing high rates of smoking among
adults with mental illness. In the 1997 Australian Survey
of Mental Health and Wellbeing, 41% of adults with a 12-
month mental disorder were current smokers compared
with 21% of adults without a mental disorder, and adults
with a 12 month disorder represented 30% of all smokers
[57,58]. Changes in the design of the CIDI between 1997

and 2007 mean these figures are not directly comparable
with those from the 2007 survey, but the similarity in
smoking rates is notable. The 1992 US National Comor-
bidity Survey found that 41% of adults with a mental ill-
ness in the past month were current smokers compared
with 22.5% of adults with no lifetime mental illness [11].
In New Zealand, the 2003­04 New Zealand Mental
Health Survey reported 33% of adults with a mental dis-
order were smokers compared with 21% of adults with no
mental disorder [59]. In the UK, the 1996 National Psy-
chiatric Comorbidity Survey found 47% of adults with
psychiatric morbidity were smokers compared with 29%
of those with no psychiatric morbidity [60,61]. Unlike the
other surveys, the UK survey used the Clinical Interview
Schedule ­ Revised [62] rather than the CIDI.
Our findings of increasing level of smoking with increas-
ing level of psychological distress are also consistent with
previous reports. In the 1992 US National Comorbidity
Survey, smokers with a mental illness in the past month
smoked a mean 26.2 cigarettes per day compared with
22.6 per day for smokers with no mental illness [11]. In
the 2006­07 New Zealand Health Survey, smokers in the
top quintile of K10 scores, measuring non-specific psy-

chological distress, smoked 1.21 times as many cigarettes
per day as smokers in the lowest quintile [59]. In the 1996
German National Health Interview Survey, smokers with
a mental disorder were more likely to meet DSM-IV crite-
ria for nicotine dependence, and more likely to smoke
heavily [63].
Although smoking rates have been declining in the US
and Australia, our findings demonstrate the continued
large proportion of smokers who also suffer from com-
mon mental disorders, consistent with our hypothesis.
The proportion of people with mental illness who smoke
was highest among young adults. As these smokers are
likely to have commenced smoking most recently, this
suggests the possibility that the proportion of smokers
who have a mental illness may rise as these cohorts age.
People with substance use disorders have the highest rates
of smoking, and those with anxiety and depressive disor-
ders who have a comorbid substance use disorder also
have very high smoking rates. Although this group repre-
sents the minority of those with mental illness who
smoke, they present particular challenges for tobacco con-
trol. Especially among young people, smoking initiation
needs to be seen in the context of overall risk-taking
behaviour. If a reduction in smoking is offset by an
increase in the use of another substance, the benefit of
smoking reduction will be reduced.
People with mental illness who are also smokers suffer
from the negative health effects of smoking. Mental illness
is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality
due to cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases and
cancers [13-17,64,65]. The higher average consumption
of cigarettes by smokers with mental illness suggests that
mentally ill people who smoke may be even more likely
to suffer adverse health consequences than smokers with-
out mental illness. Indeed, the relative success of anti-
smoking efforts among the non-mentally ill has been sug-
gested as one reason for the growing disparity in morbid-

ity, mortality and life expectancy outcomes between those

Implications for tobacco control
The main focus in responding to the high prevalence of
mental illness among current smokers has been on inter-
ventions aimed at mental health treatment settings, par-
ticularly hospital and clinic based settings [66,67]. There
is no doubt that the high rate of smoking among patients
of mental health services contributes to the excess physical
morbidity and mortality consistently observed in these
patients, and it is likely that smoking complicates or exac-
erbates mental illness and its treatment. Efforts to reduce
smoking in patients of mental health services are clearly
important. However, service-based smoking cessation
programmes will be ineffective for the large proportion of
smokers with common mental disorders who are not in
contact with these services.
Approaches to smoking cessation outside the clinical set-
ting have largely ignored the issue of mental illness. For
example, the 2000 US Surgeon General report on reduc-
ing tobacco use does not mention this group [68], while
the recent Australian National Preventative Health Task-
force report on tobacco control only mentions mental ill-
ness outside of mental health services to suggest that
people with common mental illnesses are as likely as any-
one else to benefit from general population-based smok-
ing cessation strategies [69]. The principal components of
population health-based smoking cessation efforts, such
as reducing availability, restricting all forms of promo-
tion, increasing price, advertising health consequences
and educating young people about them, and restricting
use in public places, have generally not been tailored for
people with mental illness, and may be less relevant or
less effective for people dealing with mental illness. For
instance, increases in price may be less successful in moti-
vating quit attempts in people with mental illness. Some
of the heaviest smokers have the least ability to pay for
their tobacco use [70]. The principle of increasing price to
reduce smoking rates is predicated on smokers being
rational agents able to maximise utility of available funds.
Mental disorders, particularly depression and anxiety dis-
orders can affect people's decision making. It is possible
that continuing to increase the price of cigarettes may
have a negative effect on mentally ill smokers, penalising
both them and their families [37]. Similarly, it has been
suggested that bans on smoking in public places may
increase the level of social isolation felt by people with
mental illness who smoke [38]. Denormalising smoking
may be less influential on people who already feel mar-
ginalised from mainstream society for other reasons.
Without programmes that ensure people with mental ill-
ness have as much chance of successfully quitting smok-
ing as anyone else, the success of these types of public
policies may further the level of inequality between peo-
ple with and without mental illness.
Similarly, health promotional messages have concen-
trated on communicating the longer term negative health
consequences of smoking. While this knowledge has
prompted some people to quit smoking and prevented
others from starting smoking, these messages may have
less impact on people suffering mental illness or dealing
with stressful and difficult life circumstances. Mental ill-
nesses such as depression or anxiety disorders are associ-
ated with increased risk-behaviour, possibly motivated by
the lower value placed on a long life by people whose
sense of fulfilment in life is compromised [38,71,72]. The
ability to focus on longer-term goals and consequences
can be affected by the pressures of more immediate and
challenging circumstances. There is little evidence in the
literature of attempts to develop smoking cessation mes-
sages to target issues that are more relevant to people with
mental illness.
Population health-based smoking cessation promotional
activities have tended to focus on messages for the whole
population or segmenting the population by demo-
graphic characteristics, such as age and sex. It has been
suggested that this focus may reflect the way surveillance
data are collected [73], but it is in contrast to the way that
cigarettes historically have been marketed in the US and
Australia, and the way they continue to be marketed in
countries with less restrictions on cigarette marketing and
promotion. Analysis of tobacco industry marketing
research and market segmentation studies suggests the
tobacco industry, in addition to developing products and
campaigns targeting youth or women, for example, also
targeted market segments defined by psychosocial charac-
teristics, such as personality type. Products and campaigns
were developed to address concerns such as reducing anx-
iety, stress or nervousness, improving mood, increasing
social confidence, reducing irritability, or increasing con-
centration [11,73-76]. Academic studies investigating
motivations for taking up and for continuing smoking
have also commonly found that psychological factors are
important. Coping with stress, and controlling emotions
are two factors commonly extracted from these types of
studies [77-79]. Smokers are also more likely to deal with
problems themselves rather than seek help [77]. As these
psychosocial factors cut across demographic groups,
demographically targeted smoking cessation campaigns
may miss opportunities to develop more effective targeted
strategies.
Tobacco control groups have tended to focus on treating
smoking as a single issue, arguing that not only are sub-
groups such as people with mental illness equally likely to
benefit from population-based access control and promo-
BMC Public Health 2009, 9:285 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/9/285

tion of long-term health consequences, but that develop-
ing targeted campaigns would weaken the effectiveness of
the overall campaign [80]. Few would argue with the gains
that the universal targeting of smoking cessation has
made in the past decades in achieving reductions in the
prevalence of smoking. And yet, the evidence here also
suggests that substantial inequalities in benefit are accru-
ing in the sub-population of individuals with mental ill-
ness and that strategies in addition to universal
approaches are needed to address these vulnerable popu-
lations.
The universal approach may also miss the context in
which young people initiate smoking or partake in some
other risk-taking behaviour. A decline in smoking rates
would be less meaningful if it is achieved through young
people substituting some other harmful substance or
behaviour to cope with their difficulties. Perhaps when
population health goals are formulated, such as the
Healthy People 2010 objectives [81], a broader context
should be considered, such as reducing smoking related
harm without increasing harm through other risk behav-
iours. As mentally ill smokers may be more susceptible to
addictions in general [82], focussing narrowly on the
smoking behaviour only without considering other risk
behaviours may compromise the overall goal of smoking
cessation ­ improved health outcomes.
Monitoring smoking in people with mental disorders in
routine surveillance systems
The CIDI, which was used for assessing mental health
conditions in both the NCS-R and the SMHWB, is time
consuming to administer and impractical to incorporate
in omnibus surveys of the type that are routinely used for
monitoring smoking rates. The K6 measure of non-spe-
cific psychological distress has been included in the US
National Health Interview Survey since 1997 [52], and
has more recently been incorporated into the US Behavio-
ral Risk Factor Surveillance System [83] and the Australian
National Health Survey [84]. Although it is far less com-
prehensive than the CIDI, the strong association between
smoking rates and level of psychological distress suggest it
could be used to track progress in reducing smoking rates
among the mentally ill. As the measure is already incorpo-
rated in monitoring surveys, we hope that it can be incor-
porated into routine surveillance of smoking rates. While
some collections have employed a binary categorisation
of psychological distress, the significant gradient in smok-
ing rates and numbers of cigarettes consumed across low,
mild, moderate, and severe levels of psychological distress
suggest at least four or five categories should be employed
to adequately monitor this relationship. The K6 scale is
most closely correlated with anxiety and affective disor-
ders and less relevant to measuring impulse control or
substance use disorders. Its use in routine surveillance
should be supplemented by other measures in these areas.
Currently there is no long-term time series on smoking
rates in people with and without mental illness. Although
the NCS and the SMHWB have both been run twice, the
changes in instrumentation and the shift from ICD-9/
DSM-III-R to ICD-10/DSM-IV limit the comparability of
these figures over time. It is hoped that the inclusion of
short mental health measures such as the K6 in routine
health surveillance programmes will lead to the accumu-
lation of time series data in this area.
Study limitations
All three surveys are based on self-report for both mental
health status and smoking status. Diagnosis via the CIDI
correlates well with diagnosis via structured clinical inter-
view administered by a psychiatrist, but is not the same
thing as a validated psychiatric interview. The NCS-R and
SMHWB were both voluntary surveys, and response rates
may be an issue. It is possible that people with mental ill-
ness were under-represented in the surveys due to non-
response problems. The surveys targeted the non-institu-
tionalised population, and will thus not include the high
rates of mental health problems within institutional set-
tings such as hospitals, hostels, and prisons.
Conclusion
Data from two major population-based surveys of mental
health, in the US and Australia, not only confirm the high
rate of smoking among people with mental illness, but
also the significant proportion of smokers who have a
mental illness. Data from the US NHIS also show that
people with higher levels of psychosocial stress on average
consume higher numbers of cigarettes.
There may be opportunities to further reduce smoking
rates, reduce morbidity and mortality associated with
mental illness, and reduce inequality in health outcomes,
by specifically targeting some tobacco control efforts at
this population of smokers. While mental health services
in developed countries have changed considerably in
recent years with moves towards more integrated models
of care, it seems that providers of some physical health
services are more reluctant to see mental illness as an
important part of their target group. Groups interested in
reducing morbidity and mortality due to heart disease or
cancer have traditionally been strong supporters of
tobacco control. Despite the disproportionate rate of peo-
ple with mental illness in morbidity and mortality statis-
tics for these conditions, addressing mental health
concerns has not been a high priority for these groups. On
the basis of figures reported in major national surveys it
would be expected that mental illness would be a key area
of concern for groups interested in tobacco control.
It is possible that reducing the incidence of common men-
tal health problems might also reduce the incidence of
smoking. Moreover, it is possible that helping people with
BMC Public Health 2009, 9:285 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/9/285

depression and anxiety problems to find alternative ways
of coping, and to understand the consequences of nico-
tine withdrawal for their symptoms, may be helpful strat-
egies for reducing smoking rates. Teaching young people
about mental illness, skills for dealing with emotional dif-
ficulties, anxiety and stress, and about the relationship
between mental illness, smoking and other risk behav-
iours in schools and other settings may also help reduce
the incidence of smoking. Population-based methods are
required as the majority of smokers with mental illness
are not in contact with mental health services.
Some people with mental illness may find that quitting
smoking may not only improve their physical health, but
improve their mental health as well. Market segmentation
studies and the development of brands and campaigns for
tailored market segments is a common tool of marketing,
not just in the tobacco industry. This type of approach
may yield gains in the efforts to combat smoking-related
harm.
