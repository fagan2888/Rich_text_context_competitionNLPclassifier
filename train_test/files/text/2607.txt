Adverse Events From Cough and Cold Medications After
a Market Withdrawal of Products Labeled for Infants
WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: A voluntary market
withdrawal of orally administered, over-the-counter cough and
cold medications (CCMs) labeled for infants was announced in
October 2007 because of concerns regarding limited evidence of
efficacy and potential harmful effects of these products among
young children.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study assessed changes in CCM-
related harm, as measured with national estimates of emergency
department visits for CCM-related adverse events, among
children after announcement of the withdrawal of orally
administered, over-the-counter, infant CCMs.
abstract
OBJECTIVE: A voluntary market withdrawal of orally administered,
over-the-counter, infant cough and cold medications (CCMs) was an-
nounced in October 2007. The goal of this study was to assess CCM-
related adverse events (AEs) among children after the withdrawal.
METHODS: Emergency department (ED) visits for CCM-related AEs
among children 12 years of age were identified from a nationally
representative, stratified, probability sample of 63 US EDs, for the 14
months before and after announcement of withdrawal.
RESULTS: After withdrawal, the number and proportion of estimated
ED visits for CCM-related AEs involving children 2 years of age were
less than one-half of those in the prewithdrawal period (1248 visits
[13.3%] vs 2790 visits [28.7%]; difference: 15.4% [95% confidence
interval [CI]: 25.9% to 5.0%]), whereas the overall number of esti-
mated ED visits for CCM-related AEs for children 12 years of age
remained unchanged (9408 visits [95% CI: 6874­11 941 visits] vs 9727
visits [95% CI: 6649­12 805 visits]). During both periods, two-thirds of
estimated ED visits involved unsupervised ingestions (ie, children find-
ing and ingesting medications).
CONCLUSIONS: ED visits for CCM-related AEs among children 2 years
of age were substantially reduced after withdrawal of over-the-counter
infant CCMs. Further reductions likely will require packaging improve-
ments to reduce harm from unsupervised ingestions and continued
education about avoiding CCM use for young children. Monitoring of
CCM-related harm should continue because recommendations were
updated in October 2008 to avoid the use of CCMs for children 4 years
of age. Pediatrics 2010;126:1100­1107

The use of cough and cold medications
(CCMs) for children recently garnered
increased attention because of con-
cerns regarding the potential harmful
effects of these medications when
used inappropriately and limited evi-
dence for their efficacy, particularly
for infants and young children.1­9 On
October 11, 2007, on behalf of the lead-
ing makers of over-the-counter (OTC)
CCMs, the Consumer Healthcare Prod-
ucts Association announced a volun-
tary market withdrawal of orally ad-
ministered CCMs labeled or intended
for infants.10 This was followed by a US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
recommendation on January 17, 2008,
to avoid use of these products to treat
infants and children 2 years of age,
"because serious and potentially life-
threatening side effects can occur."11
Here, we use nationally representative
public health surveillance data to as-
sess potential changes in the number
of emergency department (ED) visits
because of CCM-related adverse
events (AEs) after announcement of
the withdrawal of OTC products for
infants.
METHODS
National estimates of ED visits for AEs
were based on surveillance cases
from the National Electronic Injury Sur-
veillance System-Cooperative Adverse
Drug Event Surveillance (NIESS-CADES)
project, which involves a nationally
stratified, probability sample of 63
hospitals in the United States and its
territories with a minimum of 6 beds
and a 24-hour ED.12 All hospitals treat
pediatric patients, and 5 are pediatric
specialty hospitals. The NEISS-CADES
project is a collaboration of the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Preven-
tion (CDC), the FDA, and the US Con-
sumer Product Safety Commission and
was described previously.12,13 In brief,
trained coders at each hospital review
clinical records of ED visits to identify
physician-diagnosed AEs, report up to
2 medications implicated in the AE, and
record narrative descriptions of the in-
cidents. Narrative descriptions are
coded by using the Medical Dictionary
for Regulatory Activities, an interna-
tional terminology system used to an-
alyze AE reports.
Surveillance cases included any inci-
dent ED visit by a patient 12 years of
age because of a condition that was
attributed to a medication (any pre-
scription or OTC drug product, includ-
ing vitamins, herbal remedies/dietary
supplements, and vaccines) in the ED
medical record and that occurred in
the 14-month period before announce-
ment of the market withdrawal of
orally administered, OTC, infant CCMs
(July 22, 2006, to October 11, 2007; re-
ferred to here as the prewithdrawal
period) or in the 14-month period after
announcement of the withdrawal (Oc-
tober 12, 2007, to December 31, 2008;
referred to here as the postwith-
drawal period). These periods were
chosen because, at the time of this
evaluation, weighted data enabling na-
tional estimates were available only
through the end of 2008. CCMs were
defined as orally administered pre-
scription or OTC products containing
decongestants, antitussive agents/ex-
pectorants, or decongestant, antihis-
tamine, antitussive agent, and/or ex-
pectorant combinations.
ED visits were classified as attribut-
able to "unsupervised ingestions"
when cases involved children access-
ing medications without adult permis-
sion or oversight and as "supervised
administrations" when medications
were given to children by caregivers.
Medication errors were defined as any
errors made during the prescribing,
dispensing, or administration of the
medication, as documented in the ED
medical record. ED visits were ex-
cluded if they were attributed to drug
abuse or harmful intent or if the AE
occurred during the ED visit.
Each selected NEISS-CADES case was
accompanied by a sample weight
based on the inverse probability of se-
lection, with adjustment for nonre-
sponse rate and poststratification to
adjust for the number of annual hospi-
tal ED visits. National estimates of ED
visits and corresponding 95% confi-
dence intervals (CIs) were calculated
by using the Surveymeans procedure
in SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) to
account for weighting and complex
sample design. National estimates
based on 20 cases were considered
statistically unstable and are not
shown; therefore, some analyses are
descriptive and are based on the num-
ber of surveillance cases rather than
on national estimates. Estimates with
a coefficient of variation of 30% are
indicated in the tables.
To compare patterns of ED visits for
AEs between the prewithdrawal and
postwithdrawal periods, we used the
Surveymeans procedure to estimate
selected proportions (eg, the propor-
tions of CCM-related ED visits involving
children 2 years of age) for the 2 pe-
riods. The estimated proportions (and
variances) were then used to estimate
before/after differences and accompa-
nying 95% CIs.14 Because the prewith-
drawal and postwithdrawal periods
did not overlap, estimated proportions
for the respective periods were
treated as statistically independent.
RESULTS
National Estimates
In the 14-month period after announce-
ment of the withdrawal of orally ad-
ministered, OTC CCMs for infants, the
number and proportion of estimated
ED visits for CCM-related AEs involving
children 2 years of age were less
than one-half of those in the prewith-
drawal period (1248 visits [13.3%]
vs 2790 visits [28.7%]; difference:
15.4% [95% CI: 25.9% to 5.0%]),
whereas the overall number of esti-

mated ED visits for CCM-related AEs for
children 12 years of age remained
unchanged (9408 visits [95% CI: 6874­
11 941 visits] vs 9727 visits [95% CI:
6649­12 805 visits]) (Table 1). During
both time periods, most ED visits for
CCM-related AEs involved children 2 to
5 years of age, and boys accounted for
a nominally greater number of ED
visits.
Overall, the type of ingestions most
commonly involved in ED visits for
CCM-related AEs remained unchanged
postwithdrawal (Table 1). Unsuper-
vised ingestions caused approximately
two-thirds of estimated ED visits pre-
and postwithdrawal with supervised
administrations accounting for the re-
maining one-third in each period. For
most ED visits involving supervised ad-
ministrations, no medication error
was documented in the ED record
(prewithdrawal: 86.0% [95% CI: 75.9%­
96.0%]; postwithdrawal: 71.3% [95% CI:
55.4%­87.3%]).
In the prewithdrawal and postwith-
drawal periods, AE-related symptoms
were documented in the ED record for
37.1% (95% CI: 28.5%­45.8%) and
35.7% (95% CI: 26.4%­45.1%), respec-
tively, of estimated ED visits for CCM-
related AEs. Among ED visits in which
symptoms were documented, symp-
toms were most commonly described
as allergic in nature (eg, rash or urti-
caria) (prewithdrawal: 57.6% [95% CI:
39.7%­75.4%]; postwithdrawal: 52.8%
[95% CI: 35.3%­70.4%]) or as neuro-
logic or behavioral manifestations
(eg, somnolence, unsteady gait, irrita-
bility, or psychomotor hyperactivity)
(prewithdrawal: 42.3% [95% CI: 29.0%­
55.6%]; postwithdrawal: 39.8% [95% CI:
22.5%­57.2%]). The prewithdrawal
and postwithdrawal periods were sim-
ilar in the proportions of children who
underwent gastric decontamination
(eg, receipt of activated charcoal) in
the ED (22.4% vs 17.3%; difference:
5.2% [95% CI: 16.5% to 6.2%]) and
in the proportions of children who
were treated and released from the ED
(90.0% vs 91.5%; difference: 1.5% [95%
CI: 10.0% to 13.0%]).
For most ED visits for CCM-related AEs
in both the prewithdrawal and post-
withdrawal periods, no other medica-
tion class was implicated concomi-
tantly in the AEs (prewithdrawal: 93.5%
[95% CI: 88.9%­98.1%]; postwith-
drawal: 94.6% [95% CI: 90.7%­98.4%]).
For visits involving only CCMs, a single
CCM was nearly always implicated
(prewithdrawal: 99.0% [95% CI: 97.1%­
100.0%]; postwithdrawal: 99.7% [95%
CI: 99.1%­100.0%]). The specific prod-
uct characteristics of the CCMs impli-
cated in the ED visit were not identifi-
able for all surveillance cases. Dosage
form information was available for
77.5% and 85.6% of all CCM products
implicated in the prewithdrawal and
postwithdrawal periods, respectively;
of those, 78.9% (95% CI: 67.4%­90.4%)
and 83.9% (95% CI: 75.6%­92.2%), re-
spectively, were liquids (compared
with tablets/capsules or other formu-
lations). Prescription status was iden-
tifiable for 89.3% and 92.8% of all CCM
products implicated in the prewith-
drawal and postwithdrawal periods,

respectively; of those, 87.3% (95% CI:
78.6%­95.9%) and 84.7% (95% CI:
76.8%­92.6%), respectively, were iden-
tified as OTC products. Only 1 surveil-
lance case in each of the prewith-
drawal and postwithdrawal periods
referred to the implicated CCM as an
infant product; both cases involved un-
supervised ingestions.
When results were examined accord-
ing to age group, the types of CCM in-
gestions leading to ED visits for AEs
also remained relatively unchanged in
the prewithdrawal and postwith-
drawal periods (Table 2). Among chil-
dren 2 years of age, unsupervised
ingestions caused 59.5% (95% CI:
38.9%­80.1%) and 52.2% (27.9%­
76.5%) of estimated visits in the pre-
withdrawal and postwithdrawal peri-
ods, respectively. Among children 2 to
5 years of age, unsupervised inges-
tions caused most ED visits for CCM-
related AEs in both time periods, that
is, an estimated 4924 ED visits, 83.1%
(95% CI: 73.2%­92.9%) of the ED vis-
its in this age group, in the prewith-
drawal period and an estimated 5490
ED visits, 76.7% (95% CI: 67.7%­
85.7%) of the ED visits in this age
group, in the postwithdrawal period.
Among children 6 to 11 years of age,
nearly all cases were after super-
vised administrations.
Among children 2 years of age, we
examined ED visits for AEs resulting
from supervised administrations of
other medications that might have
been influenced by the withdrawal of
OTC infant CCMs (ie, medications that
might have been used by caregivers in
place of infant CCMs). For children in
this age group, the proportions of ED
visits for AEs resultingfromorallyadmin-
istered nonopioid analgesics (includ-
ing single-ingredient acetaminophen,
other acetaminophen-containing anal-
gesics, and salicylate-containing anal-
gesics), orally administered, single-
ingredient antihistamines, orally
administered, nonselective, nonsteroi-
dal antiinflammatory drugs, nasal de-
congestants, ophthalmic deconges-
tants, or topical analgesics were
similar in the prewithdrawal and post-
withdrawal periods (5.2% vs 4.7%; dif-
ference: 0.5% [95% CI: 3.7% to
2.7%]). The proportions of ED visits for
antibiotic-related AEs after supervised
administrations in this age group also
were similar in the prewithdrawal and
postwithdrawal periods (53.2% vs
55.4%; difference: 2.2% [95% CI: 8.0%
to 12.4%]).
The contribution of CCMs to the ED visit
burden for all medication-related AEs
was reduced significantly for children
2 years of age (difference: 2.1%
[95% CI: 3.8% to 0.4%]) in the post-
withdrawal period, relative to the pre-
withdrawal period, but remained sta-
tistically unchanged for children 2 to
11 years of age (difference: 1.1% [95%
CI: 1.4% to 3.6%]) (Table 3). Overall,
among children 12 years of age,
CCMs accounted for 5.5% (95% CI:
4.1%­6.8%) and 5.3% (95% CI: 4.1%­
6.5%) of estimated ED visits for all
medication-related AEs in the prewith-
drawal and postwithdrawal periods,
respectively.
Case-Based Medication Error
Analysis
Among surveillance cases in which
medication errors were documented
in the ED record, more than three-
fourths of CCM-related cases (26 of 33
cases) involved excess dosing (eg, ad-
ministration of 1.5 teaspoons instead
of 0.5 teaspoon) by caregivers (9 of 14
cases prewithdrawal and 17 of 19
cases postwithdrawal). The remaining
documented medication errors (7 of
33 cases) included inadvertent admin-
istration of a CCM or administration of
another patient's CCM (eg, one belong-
ing to a parent or sibling). Children 2
years of age accounted for approxi-
mately one-third of all cases involving
CCM errors in the prewithdrawal pe-
riod (5 of 14 cases) and approximately
one-fifth of these cases in the postwith-
drawal period (4 of 19 cases). The med-
ication errors documented in cases in-
volving children 2 years of age all
involved excess dosing of a CCM. Chil-
dren 2 to 5 years of age accounted for
approximately two-fifths of all cases
involving CCM errors in the prewith-
drawal period (6 of 14 cases) and

Case counts and estimates were from the 2006­2008 NEISS-CADES project, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CCMs refer to orally administered prescription or OTC drug products

more than one-half of such cases in the
postwithdrawal period (11 of 19
cases). During both the prewithdrawal
and postwithdrawal periods, among
cases involving medication errors for
which the product was identified ade-
quately, implicated CCMs were exclu-
sively liquid (13 of 13 cases in the pre-
withdrawal period and 19 of 19 cases
in the postwithdrawal period) and OTC
products were involved 45% (5 of 11
cases) and 72% (13 of 18 cases) of the
time, respectively.
DISCUSSION
The use of CCMs for children remains
an important concern in the medical
and public health communities. In the
14-month period after announcement
of the withdrawal, the numbers and
proportions of estimated ED visits for
CCM-related AEs involving children 2
years of age were reduced by more
than one-half, compared with the 14-
month period before the announce-
ment. Because of the relatively large
numbers of unsupervised ingestions
of CCMs among children 2 to 5 years of
age, however, the overall numbers of
ED visits for CCM-related AEs and the
contribution of CCMs to the total
medication-related ED visit burden re-
mained unchanged for children 12
years of age. A recent study docu-
mented a significant reduction in the
mean annual rate of calls reported to
US poison control centers that in-
volved therapeutic errors with OTC
CCMs among children 2 years of age
in the 15 months after withdrawal, rel-
ative to a 27-month prewithdrawal pe-
riod. Because calls to poison control
centers are voluntary, however, an im-
pact of reporting bias on the findings
could not be excluded and the inci-
dence of national exposures could not
be calculated.15 To our knowledge,
ours is the first report that, on the ba-
sis of active surveillance, assessed
the changes in the national burden
and scope among children of CCM-
related AEs and AEs related to medi-
cations potentially substituted for in-
fant CCMs since the announcement
of the withdrawal of orally adminis-
tered OTC products marketed for in-
fants. Although these safety data
cannot be used in isolation to dictate
clinical or regulatory actions, our
findings have important implications
for continued efforts to reduce the
burden of harm resulting from these
medications.
First, the finding of a substantial re-
duction in estimated ED visits for CCM-
related AEs among children 2 years
of age after announcement of the mar-
ket withdrawal is especially important
because, after the withdrawal, some
caregivers might have maintained be-
lief in the overall safety and efficacy of
these products or might have been un-
aware of or misinterpreted warnings
and either administered infant prod-
ucts still present in the home or sub-
stituted products labeled for older
children and adults.16­20 A related con-
cern regarding the withdrawal of in-
fant CCMs was that caregivers might
have sought other treatments to re-
lieve cough and cold symptoms, which
might have resulted in inappropriate
use of some medications (eg, antibiot-
ics) or increased the burden of harm
from others (eg, analgesics). In a sur-
vey of 1265 parents conducted be-
tween March and May 2008 at 20 pedi-
atric offices, 27% of parents with
children 2 years of age stated that
they were more likely to request an an-
tibiotic from the doctor after market
withdrawal of infant CCMs.19 Although
we could not account directly for
changes in patterns of medication use,
we did not identify any significant
changes in the estimated numbers or
proportions of ED visits for AEs result-
ing from supervised administrations
of antibiotics or other medications
that might have been substituted for
cough and cold relief for children 2
years of age. Overall, the finding of a
reduction in ED visits for children 2
years of age is encouraging, but con-
tinued education of clinicians and
caregivers and further monitoring
likely will be needed to ensure that the
burden of CCM-related harm continues
to decrease for young children, espe-

Estimates were from the 2006­2008 NEISS-CADES project, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CCMs refer to orally administered prescription or OTC drug products that contain
decongestant, antihistamine, antitussive, and/or expectorant combinations, as well as single-ingredient decongestants and antitussive agents/expectorants. All medications refer to
prescription or OTC medications including vitamins, herbal preparations/dietary supplements, and vaccines. Voluntary market withdrawal of OTC CCMs labeled for infants was announced
on October 11, 2007. The period before withdrawal refers to the 14-month period beginning July 22, 2006, and ending October 11, 2007; the period after withdrawal refers to the 14-month
period beginning October 12, 2007, and ending December 31, 2008.

cially given recent recommendations
to avoid CCMs for children 4 years of
age.21,22
Second, although medication errors
contributed to few ED visits overall,
the errors that did occur were al-
most exclusively the result of care-
givers overdosing liquid formula-
tions of CCMs. This finding is
important, because administration-
related medication errors constitute
a large proportion of drug-related
AEs that are considered to be readily
preventable in pediatric outpatient
settings.23,24 For liquid medications
intended for children, it has been
suggested that administration-
related medication errors stem from
caregiver misunderstanding of la-
beling instructions, failure to distin-
guish between certain volumetric
measures (eg, "tsp" versus "tbsp"),
or confusion resulting from incon-
sistency of dosing device markings
with the labeled dosage directions25
and that these types of errors can be
prevented through the use of more-
accurate dosing instruments (eg,
droppers, dosing spoons, and sy-
ringes versus dosing cups).25­28
One recent development that may pre-
vent these types of medication errors
in the future is a shift toward improved
industry standards for displaying volu-
metric measures on liquid medication
labels and dosing devices.29,30 In collab-
oration with the "CDC", the FDA, and
other stakeholders, Consumer Health-
care Products Association manufac-
turers recently adopted voluntary
guidance to simplify and to standard-
ize volumetric measures used in the
labeling of children's OTC, orally ad-
ministered, liquid medications and
their respective dosing devices.29 The
FDA recently released similar draft
guidance for industry, aimed at im-
proving the clarity and consistency of
dosage delivery devices packaged with
newly approved OTC, orally adminis-
tered, liquid medications.30 Future
studies will be required to assess the
impact of these new guidelines on
harm resulting from CCMs and other
liquid medications.
Third, unsupervised ingestions re-
mained the primary cause of harm
resulting from CCMs for children
12 years of age, and preschool-
aged children (2­5 years) continued
to account for most CCM-related AEs.
These findings point to the need for
continued interventions targeted at
reducing the potential for harm
when children find and ingest medi-
cations. To that end, we previously
suggested engineering innovations,
including packaging improvements
designed to minimize unsupervised
ingestions of liquid medications.31
Examples of such innovations in-
clude incorporation of adaptors on
liquid medication bottles, so that the
medication could be accessed only
with a needleless syringe, or the use
of bottle-neck flow restrictors that
would limit the amount of liquid that
could be ingested if an unsupervised
child gained access to the medication.
Our findings are subject to a few im-
portant limitations. First, surveillance
through the NEISS-CADES project likely
underestimates the total burden of AEs
resulting from CCMs because it does
not identify AEs resulting in calls to poi-
son control centers, visits to outpa-
tient physician offices, or deaths; how-
ever, the ED is probably the best single
setting to identify serious AEs, because
it is the location where children with
serious symptoms most likely would
be brought for treatment. Second, the
NEISS-CADES project relies on assess-
ment and documentation by ED physi-
cians; therefore, it is more likely to
identify well-recognized AEs (eg, unsu-
pervised ingestions) and is less likely
to identify AEs that are rare, previously
unreported, or difficult to diagnose in
the ED setting.12,13 Third, information
on the specific CCM formulation (ie, in-
fant versus pediatric versus adult) im-
plicated in the AE was not available in
some cases, which limited our ability
to draw conclusions about specific
products. Fourth, we cannot comment
on whether changes in the number of
ED visits differed according to race/
ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or
caregiver health literacy, because in-
formation about these variables is lim-
ited or unavailable through the NEISS-
CADES project. Fifth, although our
findings suggest that removal of infant
products from the market likely con-
tributed to the reduction of CCM-
related morbidity among children 2
years of age, other factors, including
widespread attention in the media to
the issue of the safety and efficacy of
CCMs, changes in provider attitudes
and recommendations, and warn-
ings issued by the FDA, also might
have affected use of these medica-
tions and ED visits for CCM-related
AEs in this age group. Lastly, there
may be a seasonality component to
CCM use, with less use of these prod-
ucts in the summer months and sub-
sequently fewer ED visits for CCM-
related AEs. Therefore, the selection
of 14-month periods before and after
the announcement of market with-
drawal in October 2007 might have
favored higher estimates of the num-
ber of ED visits for the postwith-
drawal period, relative to the pre-
withdrawal period of the same
duration, however, this further
strengthens the finding that ED visits
among children 2 years of age
were reduced.
Future work will be needed to assess
the impact of more-recent labeling
changes to avoid the use of CCMs for
children 4 years of age21,22 and to
evaluate whether, as attention to the
issue of the safety and efficacy of CCM
wanes, caregivers will return to ad-
ministering CCMs labeled for older

children and adults to infants. Al-
though CCMs constitute a small pro-
portion of all ED visits for AEs among
children 12 years of age, the safety
concerns they have raised demon-
strate how public-private collaborative
efforts and a combination of educa-
tion, engineering, and enforcement
strategies can be used to improve
medication safety in the outpatient
setting.

Snakes, Eels, and the Mongoose: Whenever I go hiking in northern California,
I am very careful not to put my hands or feet where I can't see them. That is
because I have a very healthy respect for the rattlesnake and have no desire to
suffer the myriad severe complications of a venomous bite. How is it then that
some ground squirrels scamper about unfazed and seemingly immune to the ill
effects of rattlesnake bites? According to an article in The New York Times
(Carroll S, October 25, 2010), many of the squirrels in northern California sur-
vive rattlesnake bites because they have developed serum proteins that neu-
tralize rattlesnake venom. Squirrels, not living in close proximity to rattle-
snakes, eg Alaskan squirrels, have not developed these proteins and are
extremely susceptible to the toxic effects of rattlesnake venom. This idea--that
in order to survive, the prey of venomous animals must develop defense mech-
anisms--is not unique to squirrels. Eels in the western Pacific, the favorite food
of some venomous sea snakes, have developed resistance to the neurotoxin of
the snake. Eels in the Caribbean, where there are no venomous sea snakes
remain highly susceptible. A good defense can be turned into a good offence.
The kingsnake has developed a serum protein that neutralizes rattlesnake
venom and so protected preys fearlessly on rattlesnakes. The King Cobra preys
on venomous snakes and may itself be bitten. The King Cobra survives because
it has developed mutated acetylcholine receptors to which neurotoxins in
venom cannot bind. So, a bite from a venomous snake causes no significant
problem for the King Cobra. The problem for the King Cobra is the mongoose. In
addition to extremely quick reflexes and powerful jaws, the mongoose too may
have developed mutated acetylcholine receptors making it less susceptible to
the venom of the Cobra. Evolution is amazing.
