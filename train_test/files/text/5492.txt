Abstract
Objective: To evaluate salivary interleukin (IL)-1b levels in patients with psoriasis, before and after
treatment with tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a inhibitors.
Methods: In this pilot study, salivary secretions were collected from patients with psoriasis and
untreated healthy control subjects at baseline, and from patients after 12 weeks' treatment with
TNF-a inhibitors. IL-1b levels were determined in saliva samples via enzyme-linked immunosorb-
ent assays, undertaken before and after TNF-a inhibitor treatment. Psoriasis-specific analysis of
disease severity and activity were also undertaken.
Results: At baseline, patients (n ¼ 25) had significantly higher salivary IL1b levels than controls
(n ¼ 20). In patients with psoriasis, TNF-a inhibitor treatment resulted in significantly reduced IL1b
levels compared with baseline, but IL1b levels remained significantly higher than in control subjects
even after treatment. There was a positive correlation between IL-1b levels, psoriasis activity and
disease index score after TNF-a inhibitor treatment.
Conclusion: Saliva is a valid noninvasive tool for monitoring inflammation in psoriasis. TNF-a
inhibitor treatments appear to interfere with the oral inflammatory process in patients with
psoriasis.

Introduction
Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated
inflammatory disease with an estimated
prevalence of up to 3% in the general
population.1 The proinflammatory milieu
plays a crucial role in the immunopathogen-
esis of psoriasis and links this disease to
other inflammatory conditions, including
metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease,
periodontitis and inflammatory bowel
disease.2­5
Saliva, a biological fluid containing
important biological markers, is easily col-
lected and stored. Salivary biomarkers have
been identified in systemic pathologies
including cardiovascular disease, renal fail-
ure and malignancy.6,7 We have profiled the
inflammatory cytokines present in salivary
secretions from patients with psoriasis.8
The aim of this pilot study was to evalu-
ate the change in salivary interleukin (IL)-1b
concentration in patients with psoriasis after
treatment with tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-a inhibitors.
Patients and methods
Study population
This pilot study recruited consecutive patients
with stable chronic plaque psoriasis who
were attending the Dermatology Clinic,
Polytechnic University of Marche Region,
Ancona, Italy, between January 2014 and
March 2014. Inclusion criteria were no peri-
odontal involvement and no previous bio-
logical therapy. Age, sex and periodontal
status-matched control subjects were recruited
from patients with nonpsoriatic dermato-
logical conditions who were attending the
same clinic. A trained oral pathologist (A.S.)
evaluated the oral cavity of each participant.
Patients with psoriasis then began standard
regimens of TNF-a inhibitor treatment.
The study was conducted in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinski,9 and all
study participants provided oral informed
consent prior to enrolment.
Sample collection and analysis
Salivary secretion samples were collected at
baseline (in patients and controls), and after
12 weeks of TNF-a inhibitor treatment (in
the patient group). Samples were collected
between 09:00 h and 11:00 h to control for
circadian modification of salivary bio-
markers, using a standardized collection
method (SalivetteÕ; Sarstedt, Nu
¨ mbrecht,
Germany), and stored at ­80C until use.
IL-1b levels were evaluated via an enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay kit (Quiagen,
Venlo, Netherlands) and expressed as
absorbance units. Psoriasis Area and
Severity Index (PASI) scores10 were deter-
mined for each patient at baseline and at 12
weeks. Patients were stratified according to
baseline psoriasis severity: mild (PASI 10);
moderate (PASI > 10­ 20); or severe
(PASI > 20).
Statistical analysis
Data were presented as mean Æ SD. For
continuous variables, normality of distribu-
tion was verified using Kolmogorov­
Smirnov test and between-group compari-
sons were made using Kruskal­Wallis test.
Linear regression analysis was used to model
the relationship between tested variables.
Patients were stratified according to baseline
psoriasis severity: mild (PASI 10); moder-
ate (PASI > 10­ 20); severe (PASI > 20).
All data were analyzed using GraphPad
PrismÕ version 5.0 and QuickCalcsÕ (both
GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA,
USA). P-values < 0.05 were considered stat-
istically significant.
Results
The study included 25 patients with psoriasis
(15 male/10 female; mean age 50.2 Æ 16.5
years; age range 34­66 years) and 20 control
subjects (12 male/eight female; mean age
50.4 Æ 15.5 years; age range 35­66 years). A
total of 15 patients were treated with
Ganzetti et al. 11
adalimumab (40 mg/every other week for
12 weeks); ten received etanercept 50 mg/
bi-weekly for 12 weeks).
At baseline, seven patients had mild
symptoms, 13 had moderate symptoms,
and five had severe symptoms of psoriasis.
TNF-a inhibitor treatment significantly
reduced the PASI score compared with
baseline in each patient group (P < 0.05 for
each comparison; Table 1).
At baseline, patients had significantly
higher salivary IL1b levels than controls
(2.12 Æ 1.16 vs 0.49 Æ 0.17; P < 0.0001).
TNF-a inhibitor treatment resulted in sig-
nificantly reduced IL1b levels compared
with baseline (1.15 Æ 0.78 vs 2.12 Æ 1.16;
P < 0.0001), but IL1b levels remained sig-
nificantly higher in patients with psoriasis
than in healthy controls (1.15 Æ 0.78 vs
0.49 Æ 0.17; P ¼ 0.0002) (Figure 1).
There was no correlation between PASI
score and IL-1b level at baseline. There was
a significant positive correlation between
PASI score and IL-1b level after TNF-a
inhibitor treatment. (R2 0.21, P ¼ 0.0028).
Discussion
Psoriasis is a multifactorial disease charac-
terized by a chronic inflammatory process
involving innate and adaptive immunity,
leading to persistent activation of the
immune response in epithelial surfaces and
dysregulation of the host inflammatory
response.5,11­13
Interleukin-1b is a key inflammatory mol-
ecule implicated in the immunopathogenesis
of many inflammatory diseases, acting on
epithelial cells, macrophages and fibroblasts.
In psoriasis, IL-1b regulates chemokine
expression and contributes to T-cell extrava-
sation,14 and has been directly implicated in

matory diseases such as periodontitis.15
The efficacy of TNF-a inhibitors in psor-
iasis is well documented, although evidence
of their action on periodontal disease is
scarce.16­19 Patients with psoriasis demon-
strated higher levels of salivary IL-1b than
healthy subjects in the present study, sug-
gesting an increase in IL-1b production in
this patient population. Interestingly, TNF-
a inhibitor treatment reduced salivary IL-1b
levels in our patients. This may attenuate the
oral inflammatory process that could be a
psoriasis trigger and/or perpetuate the per-
sistent inflammatory process of psoriasis
itself. Our study found that, despite being
reduced by TNF-a inhibitor treatment, sal-
ivary IL-1b levels in patients remained
higher than in control subjects. Taken
together, these data suggest that salivary
IL-1b may serve as a biomarker of disease
activity in patients with psoriasis.
The main limitations of this study
were the small sample size, and the com-
parative analysis with nonbiological agents.
Although larger cohort studies are needed to
validate our results, TNF-a agents appear to
interfere with the oral inflammatory process
in patients with psoriasis. In conclusion,
saliva is a valid noninvasive tool for moni-
toring inflammation in psoriasis.
