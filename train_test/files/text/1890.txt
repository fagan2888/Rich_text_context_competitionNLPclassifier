OBJECTIVE -- Homeostatic glucose control may play an important role in the development
of peripheral arterial disease among individuals without diabetes. We sought to evaluate the
association of HbA1c
(A1C) with peripheral arterial disease in a representative sample of the U.S.
population with and without diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- A cross-sectional study was conducted
among 4,526 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999­2002 participants 40
years of age. Peripheral arterial disease was defined as an ankle-brachial index 0.9 (n  327).
RESULTS -- Among nondiabetic subjects, the age-standardized prevalence of peripheral ar-
terial disease was 3.1, 4.8, 4.7, and 6.4% for participants with an A1C 5.3, 5.3­5.4, 5.5­5.6,
and 5.7­6.0%, respectively (P trend 0.001). The prevalence of peripheral arterial disease was
7.5 and 8.8% for diabetic participants with A1C 7 and 7%, respectively. After multivariable
adjustment and compared with nondiabetic participants with A1C 5.3%, the odds ratio (95%
CI) of peripheral arterial disease for nondiabetic participants with an A1C of 5.3­5.4, 5.5­5.6,
and 5.7­6.0% was 1.41 (0.85­2.32), 1.39 (0.70­2.75), and 1.57 (1.02­2.47), respectively, and
it was 2.33 (1.15­4.70) and 2.74 (1.25­6.02) for diabetic participants with A1C 7 and 7%,
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS -- An association exists between higher levels of A1C and peripheral arte-
rial disease, even among patients without diabetes. Individuals with A1C levels 5.3% should be
targeted for aggressive risk factor reduction, which may reduce the burden of subclinical car-
diovascular disease even among those without diabetes.

The risk for clinical cardiovascular
disease among individuals with dia-
betes is two to four times higher
compared with their counterparts with-
out diabetes (1­4). Higher rates of sub-
clinical cardiovascular disease among
patients with diabetes have also been re-
ported (5­7). Among the population of
patients with diabetes, homeostatic glyce-
mic control may be an important mediat-
ing factor in preventing cardiovascular
disease (8).
More recently, some studies have
noted elevated levels of glycemia to be as-
sociated with cardiovascular disease
among the general population without di-
abetes (9­13). For example, after exclud-
ing individuals with diabetes (i.e., self-
report of a previous diagnosis and/or
fasting plasma glucose 140 mg/dl
and/or a 2-h postchallenge plasma glu-
cose 200 mg/dl), the multivariable ad-
justed relative hazard of cardiovascular
disease mortality for women in the high-
est quintile (6.7%) versus the lowest
four quintiles (6.7%) of HbA1c
(A1C)
was 2.61 (95% CI 1.40­4.88) in the Ran-
cho Bernardo Study (12). However, no
association was present between A1C and
cardiovascular morality among men in
this study.
Given the strong association between
glycemic control and the development of
clinical and subclinical cardiovascular
disease among diabetic patients and
mounting evidence that mild abnormali-
ties of glucose metabolism may be associ-
ated with cardiovascular disease in
nondiabetic individuals, we hypothesized
that a strong association may exist be-
tween homeostatic glycemia and subclin-
ical cardiovascular disease among
patients without diabetes. Therefore, we
examined the association between A1C
and peripheral arterial disease among a
nationally representative sample of U.S.
adults participating in the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) 1999­2002.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- NHANES 1999­2002
was a cross-sectional survey of the civilian
noninstitutionalized population of the
U.S. The procedures involved in
NHANES 1999­2002 have been pub-
lished in detail and are available online
(14). In brief, this study included a strat-
ified multistage probability sample based
on selection of counties, blocks, house-
holds, and individuals within households.
Overall, 5,874 adults 40 years of
age participated in the interview and ex-
amination components of NHANES
1999­2002. Of these participants, ankle-
brachial index (ABI) was available for
4,930 participants (84%). After excluding
10 participants with an ABI 1.5, values
usually related to noncompressible ves-
sels in the legs, and 392 participants with
missing covariable data (e.g., total choles-
terol), 4,528 participants were included
for all analyses.
NHANES consisted of an in-home in-

terview followed by a medical evaluation
and blood sample collection at a mobile
examination center. Of relevance to the
current analysis, variables collected dur-
ing the in-home interview were age, race/
ethnicity, sex, cigarette smoking, alcohol
consumption, physical activity, and a his-
tory of diabetes. For the current analysis,
race/ethnicity was defined as non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
Mexican American, and other. Partici-
pants who reported having smoked 100
cigarettes during their lifetime were clas-
sified as current or former smokers if they
answered affirmatively or negatively, re-
spectively, to the question "Do you smoke
cigarettes now?" Individuals were consid-
ered to be physically active if they re-
ported participating in any moderate,
vigorous, or muscle strengthening activi-
ties in the preceding 30 days. Alcohol
consumption was defined as drinking, on
average, one or more beverages contain-
ing alcohol each week over the previous
year.
The NHANES 1999­2002 examina-
tion procedures included measurements
of waist circumference, blood pressure,
and ABI. After asking the participant to lift
up their shirt, waist circumference was
measured at the iliac crest to the nearest
0.1 cm. Up to three blood pressure mea-
surements were taken by a physician using
thestandardprotocoloftheAmericanHeart
Association during a single examination
visit. Blood pressure was measured with the
participant in a seated position after 5 min
of quiet rest. Systolic blood pressure was
calculated based on the average of all avail-
able blood pressure measurements.
For individuals with at least one arm
and weighing 400 lb, systolic blood
pressure for the ABI was measured via
blood pressure cuffs on the right brachial
artery and both posterior tibial arteries.
For individuals aged 40­59 years, two
measures were taken and averaged at each
site, whereas for individuals aged 60
years, one measure was taken at each site.
For individuals with conditions preclud-
ing measurement of the right arm, left
brachial artery systolic blood pressure
was taken. ABI was calculated for each
ankle as the ratio of the average ankle sys-
tolic blood pressure to arm systolic blood
pressure. The smaller of the two measure-
ments was considered the ABI for this
study. Individuals with ABI 1.5 may
have severe arterial rigidity and were
therefore excluded from all analyses (n 
10) (15). Peripheral arterial disease was
defined as ABI 0.9 (16,17).
Detailed descriptions about blood
collection and processing are provided in
the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Tech-
nologists Procedures Manual. C-reactive
protein was measured using latex-
enhanced nephelometry, and total cho-
lesterol was measured enzymatically.
Serum creatinine was measured using the
modified Jaffe reaction with glomerular
filtration rate estimated by the abbrevi-
ated formula from the Modification of
Diet in Renal Disease study after creati-
nine calibration (18,19). Chronic kidney
disease was defined as an estimated glo-
merular filtration rate 60 ml  min1 
1.73 m1 (2). Serum glucose was mea-
sured at the University of Missouri Diabe-
tes Diagnostic Laboratory using a
modified hexokinase enzymatic method.
A1C was also measured at the University
of Missouri using a boronate affinity high-
performance liquid chromatography sys-
tem. Diabetes was defined as a serum
glucose 126 mg/dl after fasting for a
minimum of 8 h, a serum glucose 200
mg/dl for those who fasted 8 h before
their NHANES visit, A1C 6.1%, and/or
self-reported current use of antidiabetes
medication.
Statistical analysis
The population was divided into six mu-
tually exclusive groups based on diabetes
status and A1C level. Individuals without
diabetes were categorized into quartile of
A1C (5.3, 5.3­5.4, 5.5­5.6, and 5.7­
6.0%), and individuals with diabetes
were categorized as having well-
controlled diabetes or not (A1C 7 or
7%, respectively). The age-standard-
ized characteristics of the study popula-
tion were calculated for each of these six
categories, with trends across all six cate-
gories, and across quartile of A1C among
nondiabetic subjects, determined using
maximum likelihood estimation. For
trend analyses, diabetes and A1C groups
were ordered from lowest to highest as
follows: no diabetes and lowest to highest
quartile of A1C, diabetes and A1C 7%,
and diabetes and A1C 7%.
The age-standardized prevalence of
peripheral arterial disease was calculated
for each A1C category for individuals
with and without diabetes. The odds ratio
(OR) of peripheral arterial disease was cal-
culated for each A1C level, with the low-
est quartile of A1C among individuals
without diabetes as the reference, using
multivariable logistic regression models.
Initially, ORs were adjusted for age, and
then they were adjusted for age, race/
ethnicity, and sex, and finally they were
adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, sex, sys-
tolic blood pressure, current and former
cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption,
being physical active, waist circumfer-
ence, chronic kidney disease, total choles-
terol, and C-reactive protein. Trends in
the OR of peripheral arterial disease
across A1C category were determined for
the full population and limited to nondi-
abetic participants modeling A1C cate-
gory as a continuous variable, using
logistic regression.
The age-adjusted; age-, race/ethnicity-,
and sex-adjusted; and multivariable-
adjusted OR of peripheral arterial disease
associated with 1­percentage point­
higher A1C was calculated, using logistic
regression models. These ORs were calcu-
lated for the full study population; indi-
viduals with A1C 7 and 6.1%,
separately; and, finally, for individuals
without diabetes. The consistency of the
association between 1­percentage point­
higher A1C and peripheral arterial disease
across important subgroups was deter-
mined by logistic regression models strat-
ified by race/ethnicity, sex, and cigarette
smoking status.
Sample weights that account for the
unequal probabilities of selection, over-
sampling, and nonresponse were applied
for all analyses using SUDAAN (version
8.0; Research Triangle Institute, Research
Triangle Park, NC). SEs were estimated
using the Taylor series linearization
method.
RESULTS -- After age standardiza-
tion, individuals with higher levels of A1C
were, on average, older, less likely to be
female, and more likely to be non-
Hispanic black or Mexican American, ver-
sus non-Hispanic white (Table 1).
Additionally, after age standardization,
those with higher levels of A1C were more
likely to be current smokers and had higher
systolicbloodpressure,largerwaistcircum-
ference, and higher C-reactive protein.
Additionally, age-standardized ABI was
lower among individuals with higher lev-
els of A1C.
Overall, 327 study participants
(5.1%) in NHANES 1999­2002 had pe-
ripheral arterial disease. After age stan-
dardization, the prevalence of peripheral
A1C and peripheral arterial disease
1982 DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 28, NUMBER 8, AUGUST 2005
arterial disease was 3.1, 4.8, 4.7, and 6.4%
among individuals without diabetes and
with an A1C 5.3 (lowest quartile), 5.3­
5.4, 5.5­5.6, and 5.7­6.0% (highest quar-
tile), respectively (P trend 0.001) (Fig. 1).
Additionally, the age-standardized preva-
lence of peripheral arterial disease was 7.5
and 8.8% among individuals with diabetes
and an A1C 7 and 7%, respectively.
After age adjustment, a graded asso-
ciation was present between higher A1C
levels and an increased OR of peripheral
arterial disease (P trend 0.001) (Table
2). A graded association remained present
after adjustment for age, race/ethnicity,
and sex and in a multivariable model that
included adjustment for age, race/
ethnicity, sex, current and former ciga-
rette smoking, alcohol consumption,
being physically active, systolic blood
pressure, waist circumference, total cho-
lesterol, C-reactive protein, and chronic
kidney disease (P  0.001 and P  0.008,
respectively). A graded association of
higher prevalence of peripheral arterial
disease at higher quartile of A1C was also
present when limiting the analysis to par-
ticipants without diabetes (multivariable-
adjusted P trend  0.041).
One­percentage point­higher A1C
was associated with a multivariable-
adjusted OR of peripheral arterial disease
of 1.24 (95% CI 1.05­1.47) (Table 3).
When limiting the analysis to the popula-
tion with A1C 7 and 6.1%, sepa-
rately, 1­percentage point­higher A1C
was associated with a multivariable-
adjusted OR of peripheral arterial disease
of 1.65 (1.07­2.55) and 1.87 (1.02­
3.43), respectively. Finally, the multivari-
able-adjusted OR for 1­percentage
point­higher A1C among nondiabetic
subjects was 1.77 (0.97­3.21). Results
were consistent across subgroups defined
by race/ethnicity; sex; and current,
former, and never smoking (each P inter-
action 0.10) (data not shown).
CONCLUSIONS -- In the current
study, higher A1C, across the entire range
of concentrations, was a significant pre-
dictor of peripheral arterial disease. This
association was present within the normal
range and even after multivariable adjust-
ment. For example, the OR of peripheral
arterial disease associated with an A1C of
5.7­6.0%, compared with 5.3%, was
1.57 (95% CI 1.02­2.47) after adjust-
ment for potential confounders and inter-
mediate factors including total

cholesterol, C-reactive protein, and
chronic kidney disease. The definition of
diabetes used in the current study reflects
cut points from evidence-based guide-
lines (20). However, as noted in these
guidelines, the risk of microvascular dis-
ease and target organ damage extends be-
low these cut points (20). The results of
the current study add to previously pub-
lished evidence and suggest substantial
benefits of tight glycemic control, even
among patients without diabetes.
A meta-analysis of observational
studies has documented an increased risk
of cardiovascular disease associated with
higher levels of A1C among patients with
diabetes (7). Specifically, the pooled rela-
tive risk (RR) of cardiovascular disease for
each 1­percentage point­higher A1C was
1.18 (95% CI 1.10­1.26) from 10 studies
that included 7,435 patients with type 2
diabetes. Additionally, this study also in-
vestigated the impact of A1C on periph-
eral arterial disease among patients with
type 2 diabetes. Three studies of A1C and
peripheral arterial disease among type 2
diabetic patients were identified (21­23).
Each of the identified studies reported
A1C to be associated with a significant
increased RR of peripheral arterial dis-
ease. After pooling together the results
from the three studies, the RR of periph-
eral arterial disease associated with 1­per-
centage point­ higher A1C was 1.28
(1.18­1.39) among patients with type 2
diabetes (7). Our study extends these
findings to a large nationally representa-
tive population sample of nondiabetic pa-
tients. Among nondiabetic patients in the
current study, each 1­percentage point­
higher A1C was associated with an age-,
race/ethnicity-, and sex-adjusted OR of
2.00 (1.13­3.54) and a multivariable-
adjusted OR of 1.77 (0.97­3.21) for pe-
ripheral arterial disease.
Despite consistent results among dia-
betic patients, studies of glucose metabo-
lism abnormalities and cardiovascular
disease among nondiabetic patients have
provided inconsistent results (10,
12,24,25). In men without diagnosed di-
abetes participating in the European
Prospective Investigation of Cancer and
Nutrition (EPIC-Norfolk) study, the RR of
all-cause mortality associated with A1C of
5.0­5.4, 5.5­6.9, and 7%, compared
with their counterparts with A1C 5%,
was 1.41, 2.07, and 2.64, respectively (P
trend 0.001) (10). Additionally, in a
nested case-control study of the Women's
Health Study, the crude RR of cardiovas-
cular disease among participants in the
highest versus lowest quartile of A1C was
2.25 (95% CI 1.59­3.18) (24). However,
after adjustment for additional factors, in-
cluding blood pressure and C-reactive
protein, this association was no longer
present (RR 1.00). Among women in the
Rancho Bernardo study, higher A1C was
not associated with a significant increase
in all-cause mortality, but it was associ-
ated with a significant increased relative
hazard of cardiovascular disease and isch-
emic heart disease mortality (12). How-

ever, no association was present between
A1C and all-cause or cause-specific mor-
tality among men.
Studies of A1C with subclinical car-
diovascular disease have produced con-
flicting evidence (26­29). In a nested
case-control study within the Atheroscle-
rosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study,
the mean A1C level was 5.18 and 5.07%,
respectively (P  0.004), among case
subjects (carotid artery far-wall thickness
2.5 mm or bilateral thickening exceed-
ing the 90th percentile of the cohort dis-
tribution) and control subjects matched
for age, race, sex, and Atherosclerosis Risk
in Communities field center (far- and
near-wall thickness lower than the 75th
percentile of intima-media thickness on
all carotid artery segments) (28). How-
ever, no association between A1C and in-
tima media thickness was present after
multivariable adjustment. Additionally,
among 582 individuals at risk for diabe-
tes, a significant age- and sex-adjusted as-
sociation between A1C and intima-media
thickness was no longer significant, with
an OR of 1.24 (95% CI 0.82­1.89), after
multivariable adjustment (35). Among
older Caucasian adults without known
diabetes in the Hoorn study population,
each 1­percentage point­higher A1C was
associated with a multivariable-adjusted
OR of peripheral arterial disease of 1.35
(1.10­1.65) (26). Other studies have also
found associations of higher rates of sub-
clinical cardiovascular disease at higher
levels of glycemia (29). These latter stud-
ies are consistent with the results from the
current analysis; the multivariable-
adjusted OR of peripheral arterial disease
associated with an A1C of 5.7­6.0%,
compared with an A1C 5.3%, was 1.57
(1.02­2.47). Additionally, previously
published data from the Diabetes Control
and Complications Trial have shown that
the risk of retinopathy progression, mi-
croalbuminuria, and neuropathy in-
creased continuously with higher levels of
A1C over its entire range.
Peripheral arterial disease is a partic-
ularly strong prognostic indicator of fu-
ture clinical cardiovascular disease
events, and the importance of its recogni-
tion has been highlighted in several
guidelines (30­33). Furthermore, it is
easily diagnosed in clinical practice at
minimal cost. It should be recognized that
in the late stages of diabetes, calcification
and increased arterial wall stiffness may
lead to false elevations in ankle blood
pressure. It is not clear whether such
changes occur early in the disease pro-
cess, but, if so, our findings may be more
robust than indicated by the data.
Despite the potential benefits of low-
ering A1C noted in the current study, to
our knowledge there is no clinical trial
data showing that the risk of cardiovascu-
lar and peripheral arterial diseases is re-
duced by the continued reduction of A1C
below 6.1%. However, one of the primary
aims of the Action to Control Cardiovas-
cular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial is
to assess whether a therapeutic strategy
targeting an A1C of 6.0% will reduce
the rate of cardiovascular disease events
compared with a target of 7.0­7.9% (34).
Recruitment for Action to Control Car-
diovascular Risk in Diabetes began in
2003, with follow-up expected to last
through 2009, and study results are an-
ticipated to be available in 2010.
The results presented for the current
study need to be interpreted in the con-
text of the study's limitations. Most nota-
bly, the cross-sectional nature of the
present study limits assessment of the
causal nature of the association between
A1C and peripheral arterial disease. Ad-
ditionally, although the sample size was
large, the power to detect associations and
effect modification was limited because of
the low prevalence of peripheral arterial
disease. For example, although elevated
ORs of peripheral arterial disease were
present when comparing nondiabetic pa-
tients with an A1C of 5.3­5.4 and 5.5­
5.6% vs. 5.3%, the 95% CIs were wide
and included the null. Given the graded
nature of the association detected, with a
larger sample size, these ORs most likely
would have been statistically significant.
Additionally, although we analyzed pa-
tients with diabetes separately, NHANES
1999­2002 procedures did not include
the oral glucose tolerance test. Therefore,
some patients classified as not having di-
abetes in the current study, based on se-
rum glucose 126 mg/dl (200 for those
not fasting for 8 h) and A1C 6.1%,
may have impaired glucose tolerance.
Previous studies indicate the association
with subclinical cardiovascular disease
may be stronger for elevated postchal-
lenge glucose levels and spikes, compared
with higher A1C (35). An additional lim-
itation is that because of time constraints
during the NHANES visit, ABI was mea-
sured only in the posterior tibial artery,
and the dorsalis pedis artery pressure was
not measured. Finally, only a subsample
of NHANES 1999 ­2002 participants
were asked to fast overnight before their
study visit. An association between higher
fasting serum glucose and peripheral ar-
terial disease appeared to be present (data
not shown). However, the CIs were wide
because of the limited number of cases in
the fasting NHANES subsample.
Despite these limitations, there are
several strengths involved in the current
study. This study involved a nationally
representative sample of the U.S. popula-
tion 40 years of age. Additionally, all
data were collected following rigorous
methodology, including a study protocol
with quality control checks.
In conclusion, higher levels of A1C
among nondiabetic patients may be an in-
dicator of increased risk of subclinical
cardiovascular disease. A significant in-
creased risk of peripheral arterial disease
was noted at A1C levels between 5.7 and
6.0% among nondiabetic patients. Fur-
thermore, nonsignificant increased risks
of peripheral arterial disease were noted at
A1C levels of 5.3­5.4 and 5.5­5.6%.

Measurement of A1C or other indicators
of mild glucose abnormalities in clinical
practice may be valuable in identifying
patients with an increased risk of subclin-
ical cardiovascular disease.
