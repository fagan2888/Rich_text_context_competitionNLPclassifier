Technology in the classroom has come a long way since the
1980s. Today its usage extends well beyond graphing calcu-
lators, interactive whiteboards, I-clickers, laptop computers,
and iPods. Prensky (2001) first coined the term "digital
natives" to represent those younger generations that grew up
with technology integrated into their everyday lifestyles.
Since then, research has focused solely on digital natives as
students (Lei, 2009; Stearns, 2006; Wood, 2006). Educators
have noted that digital natives use technology differently
from their parents and teachers, especially those who are
members of nondigital native generations (Powell, 2007;
Prensky, 2006). An abundance of research focuses on these
digital natives in the K-12 classroom, but many digital
natives have actually entered the workforce (Rainie, 2006)
and have chosen the field of education--often as teachers or
preservice teachers (Dutt-Doner, Allen, & Corcoran, 2005).
Lei (2009) noted that the current research trend is to focus on
digital natives as professionals pursuing careers in educa-
tion. This trend includes research aimed at understanding
these teachers in the classrooms, their perceptions, their use
of technology, and their perceptions of the benefits for stu-
dents who use technology in the classroom. This then takes
an additional step as teachers must find ways to teach using
technology, which provide complex cognitive engagement
that in turn allows students to invest themselves in the learn-
ing process (Warschauer, 2007). Central to these ideas is the
concept of the teacher as a professional in the classroom
comparable with a lawyer in a law firm or a doctor in a hos-
pital. From there, one is able to value the perceptions and
judgments of the teacher on technology use in the classroom
and learning.
Teachers as Professionals
In the modern United States, the role of the teacher as a pro-
fessional has become ambiguous. Professionalism is often
discussed in terms of standards and performance (Rodd,
2006). Osgood (2006) described the neoliberal construc-
tions of professionalism as valuing male attributes, includ-
ing rationalism, competitiveness, and individualism. These
same attributes from the consumer-centric mentality were

Teacher's Perceptions ofTechnology
Use in the Schools
Marie-Anne Mundy1, Lori Kupczynski1, and Rick Kee2
Abstract
Although many schools are equipped with the latest instructional technologies, multiple studies have indicated that more
than half of the teachers equipped with computers only use them for administrative functions, and only half of their students
report using technology more than once a week. Many faculty members lack the technological proficiency needed to take
advantage of these new technologies, making them unable to bring these technologies into the classroom and leading to
many standing unused in the classroom.This study analyzes teachers' perceptions of technology use in the classroom by
surveying those who participated in the TeachUp! technology empowerment program created and developed by Digital
Opportunity Trust USA, Inc. (DOT USA).The results show that teachers who were part of DOT USA's TeachUp! program
perceived a significant increase in the areas of student engagement, student excitement, student acceleration of learning, and
student proficiency with computer technology.The analysis has indicated that faculty members need not only to learn how
to use technology at a basic level but also to learn how to integrate that technology into their curricula. In addition, newer
teachers from digital native generations must be taught how their acquired skills can be used to integrate technology into the
classroom curriculum to provide complex cognitive engagement for their students. It is essential that the role of the teacher
as a professional in the classroom not be discounted when evaluating classroom curriculum development and strategy,
including those that would integrate various technologies.

also found to be similar to the perceptions of parents about
teachers. Thus, this marginalization reduced teachers to the
role of a service provider, rather than a professional.
In the United States, notions of professionalism are cen-
tered on accountability, whereas a popular Italian concept--
the Reggio Emilia context--of professionalism in early
childhood education describes professionalism in terms of
trust. In the Reggio Emilia approach, the guiding principal
is that programs should reflect the beliefs and values of the
community. Therefore, various programs would differ based
on the diverse communities practicing Reggio Emilia. In
this approach, the understanding of the teacher as a profes-
sional, by the community and parents, allows the teacher to
freely make autonomous and trustworthy decisions, as well
as continue his or her professional development, which
stems from observation, conversation, debate, and reflec-
tion on his or her personal work. Terzi and Cantarelli (2001)
stressed that this reflection enriches the educator's knowl-
edge and contributes to trustworthiness.
The professionalism of a teacher can also be compared
with professionalism in other sectors such as law or medicine.
As with professionals in these sectors, teachers work in an
environment where their obligations are understood by tradi-
tion rather than specifically outlined in a job description
(Scriven, 1988). Scriven (1988) acknowledged that the same
models of evaluation used in other sectors should be applied
to teaching because teaching is "best conceived of as a profes-
sion, whatever the proportion of teachers that rise to or reject
that conception" (p. 3). Griffin (1990) offered four proposi-
tions to make teaching as attractive as other careers. These
include perceiving teaching as intellectual, understanding
that teachers are central to decision making in schools, under-
standing that the work of the teacher is determined and
rewarded based on school needs and expectations as well as
individual professional choices, and, finally, understanding
that teachers engage in professional development to ensure
that they maintain their understanding of their profession.
Finland has become a country with one of the world's
highest performing educational systems due to education
reforms seen in the last decade (Hargreaves & Shirley,
2008). Hansen (1998) stressed that Finland's success is a
clear reflection of the overall acknowledgment of teachers
as independent professionals. The new guidelines shifted
power in schools to the local level and allowed teachers the
authority to develop and define content based on prescribed
guidelines (Hansen, 1998).
Arne Duncan, the U.S. Secretary of Education, hosted the
first International Summit on the Teaching Profession in
early 2011. Representatives from 16 countries met to discuss
the current situation of education on the global scale. With
the understanding that the quality of the teacher is the "single
biggest in-school influence on student achievement," teacher-
centric issues such as recruitment, preparation, support,
retirement, compensation, and evaluation were discussed
(Stewart, 2011, p. 93). Finland was again cited as attributing
its success to the highly respected role of the teacher in the
classroom (Stewart, 2011). While the education system in
the United States may be more focused on student achieve-
ment as measured through standardized exams, it is essential
that the role of the teacher as a professional in the classroom
not be discounted when evaluating classroom curriculum
development and strategy, including those that would inte-
grate various technologies.
Teachers' Perceptions
ofTechnology Use
Computers have changed the way that many teachers
approach teaching. Teachers are now able to use computers
to demonstrate dynamic processes in real time such as pro-
viding students with simulations of how gases behave at
different temperatures in science classes (Hurwitz, 1999) or
showing videos and movie clips of significant historical
events, all of which allow the teacher to provoke deeper
thought processes. Several older digital natives who have
used computers, both in and out of the classroom, over the
past two decades would recognize, as well as welcome, the
necessity for an informal and critical approach to the use of
computers in education (Loveless, 1999). Despite the enor-
mous headway that computer technology has made, there is
still a common misconception that computers and the
Internet are the only useful technologies for the field of edu-
cation (Lyle, 2009). However, education technology is actu-
ally spread throughout a broad spectrum of different
technologies including, but not limited to, those used in
"design, making, problem-solving, technological systems,
resources and materials, criteria and constraints, processes,
controls, optimization and trade-offs, invention, and many
other aspects dealing with human innovation" (Lyle, 2009,
p. 35).
There is a lot of research on the views of teacher's about
technology use in the classroom. According to Cope and
Ward (2002), experienced teachers who had little or no pro-
fessional development in the use of technology in the class-
room were less likely to use it in the classroom and were less
likely to see the benefit of technology usage in the class-
room. Royer (2002) found that the more teachers were
involved in actually setting up classroom technology the
more likely they were to use that technology for instruction
(Royer, 2002). This is why it is important for teachers to
receive technology skill training. This is not to say that the
advancement of technology use in the classroom changes the
role of the teacher. Wang (2002) found that teachers saw their
roles as being more teacher centered and less student centered
in classrooms that did not have computers. However, teachers
did not think that they would teach differently or that their
roles would be different in a classroom with computers.
Savery (2002) noticed that faculty felt comfortable using
technology such as email, overhead projectors, and videos.
However, faculty felt that they used email more often for
Mundy et al. 3
instruction rather than for the students demonstrating a dif-
ference in the perceptions of the use of email (Savery, 2002).
Wilson, Notar, and Yunker (2003) found that on the average,
teachers used the computers 1.9 hr per week mainly to enter
grades in elementary schools. Students spent even less time
on the computers--only 1.5 hr per week. A study in Taiwan
demonstrated a strong relationship between teacher training
and the integration of technology into the curriculum. Hsu
(2010) discovered that the better trained the teacher was in
the use of technology, the more likely he or she was to suc-
cessfully integrate it into classroom instruction. In a study of
teacher perception of the values that are needed to be an
"exemplary" user of technology in the classroom, it was
found that teachers believe that a person has to be confident
in his or her ability to use technology and committed to its
use (Ertmer, Ottenbreit-Leftwich, & York, 2007).
In addition, Warschauer (2007) found that schools with a
higher socioeconomic status integrated technology much
more readily because teachers are confident that students
have better access to computers and/or technology at home
and therefore can complete homework in which technology
is necessary for the completion. Schools with a lower socio-
economic status can compensate somewhat for this differ-
ence by providing laptops for home use, keeping the
computer lab open after school, or using mobile labs more
efficiently. Warschauer also stated that boys appear to use
computers for gaming whereas girls tend to use it for network-
ing and communication. Schools need to develop better strate-
gies for incorporating technology into classroom instruction
by using this information.
When middle school and secondary school teachers used
web-based learning tools as part of their lessons, they per-
ceived that their students were more successful as it appeared
to significantly engage the students (Kay, Knaack, & Petrarca,
2009). Furthermore, the students also scored higher on tests.
This study also found that teachers felt the web-based learn-
ing tools were easy for the students to use. The use of technol-
ogy in the classroom allows students to engage in a more
active way of thinking, literally a hands-on learning experi-
ence in which they are able to practice executing skills that
would be impossible with a traditional book lesson.
Method
There has been an increase in the availability of new com-
puter technologies, in terms of hardware and software, with
the potential to engage K-12 students and increase their
learning success. According to the International Society of
Technology in Education's (ISTE) June 2008 Policy Brief,
studies have shown statistically significant positive effects
of education technology on student reading, literacy, and
mathematical achievements. However, many teachers in
schools with a high level of need, "high need" schools, lack
the proficiency needed to take advantage of these new
technologies and bring them into the daily classroom learn-
ing experience.
Digital Opportunity Trust USA, Inc (DOT USA), a
Mississippi-based nonprofit, has created and implemented a
technology empowerment program, TeachUp!, for teachers
of "high need" students at 250 K-12 public schools in
Mississippi and New Orleans over the last 4 years. The
TeachUp! project focuses on providing teachers in high need
schools with one-on-one coaching and training through an
intern system to accelerate teacher proficiency in the use of
education technology in the classroom to boost student engage-
ment, success, and retention. At the same time, TeachUp! pre-
pares the interns who provide the training for the professional
world of education. Most interns during the time of this study
would fall into the category of digital natives, those who have
grown up with accessibility to technology.
The TeachUp! Program was started shortly after the
Katrina hurricane to assist the Gulf Coast schools, which
were in great disarray and need. In the years following this
event, other areas such as the Delta were included. Various
granting bodies provided the necessary funds for the
program and required reports based on evaluations. This
archived data included the Teacher Pulse Survey (TPS)
that was initially created by the measurement and evalua-
tion specialist to provide the information required by the
granting bodies. As the program is continually evolving, in
2010, the TPS was reviewed, and the survey was sent to all
the field experts to ensure that the questions were still
appropriate. Additional questions were added to the May
2011 version of the survey because of a change in granting
bodies and the accompanying addition of goals and objec-
tives, but these questions were not analyzed in this
article.
Teachers were given the upgraded TPS in November of
2010 and May of 2011, approximately at the beginning and
end of one school year. The responses to specific questions
by the districts studied were compared between the
November 2010 administration and the May 2011 adminis-
tration of the survey. Each of the rating questions used a
5-point Likert-type scale. The responses to the following
questions were analyzed:
· Rate your DOT Intern on availability when you
have a technology question or problem;
· Rate your DOT Intern's ability to solve technology
questions;
· Rate the overall quality of support you receive from
your DOT Intern;
· Rate your growth in technology proficiency since
collaboration with interns;
· Rate your growth in morale since collaboration
with interns;
· Rate your students on the following factors, since
infusion of technology in your school;
4 SAGE Open
· Student engagement;
· Student excitement;
· Acceleration of learning;
· Proficiency with computer technology;
· How familiar are you with instructional technology;
· How useful is technology in your teaching;
· Would you recommend technology usage for
instructional purposes to other teachers?
Respondents were teachers from 44 school districts.
Individual teacher responses were not recorded or marked. It
was impossible to create matched pairs between the November
and May administrations. The school district was used as the
unit of measure in lieu of the individual respondent. To
accomplish this, the individual ratings for each school dis-
trict were summed and averaged. A total of 21 out of 44
school districts completed the survey in November 2010 and
May 2011. The scores were then compared between the
November and the May administrations using paired sample
t tests. Further statistical analysis to examine the effect size
of significant changes was also conducted.
Results
In November of 2010, 1,088 teachers responded to the TPS.
In May of 2011, 1,037 teachers responded. Respondents
were teachers from various school districts. Because indi-
vidual teacher responses were not recorded, it was not pos-
sible to match individual pairs between the November and
May administrations of the survey instrument. As such, the
school district was used in lieu of the individual respondent.
To accomplish this, the individual ratings for each school
district were summed and averaged. A total of 21 out of 44
school districts completed the survey in November 2010 and
May 2011. The averaged scores of the November 2010 and
the May 2011 administrations were then compared using
paired sample t tests. The mean and standard deviation for
each question are listed in Table 1.
There were no statistically significant differences between the
November and May survey responses for the following questions:
· Rate your DOT Intern on availability when you
have a technology question or problem.
· Rate your DOT Intern's ability to solve technology
questions.
· Rate the overall quality of support you receive from
your DOT Intern.
· Rate your growth in technology proficiency since
collaboration with interns
· Rate your growth in morale since collaboration
with interns
However, there was a slight decrease in ratings on the
May 2011 survey responses.
There were no statistically significant differences between
the November and May responses to the survey for the fol-
lowing questions:
· How familiar are you with instructional technology?
· How useful is technology in your teaching?
· Would you recommend technology usage for
instructional purposes to other teachers?
However, there was a slight increase in the ratings on the
May 2011 survey responses.
There were significant differences between the November
and May responses on the following questions with signifi-
cant increases in the May ratings. The median, standard
deviation, and effect size for each significant difference is
listed on Table 2.
On the question, "Rate your students on student engage-
ment, since infusion of technology in your school," the May
2011 response (M = 3.9625, SD = .41377) was significantly
greater than the November 2010 response (M = 3.6599, SD =
.46363), t(1,20) = -2.79, p = .01. The partial eta squared of
.28 is considered a large effect size, and 28% of the variance
was explained by the technology infusion through the intern
presence.
On the question, "Rate your students on student excite-
ment, since infusion of technology in your school," the May
2011 response (M = 4.0527, SD = .44280) was significantly
greater than the November 2010 response (M = 3.7489, SD =
.48936), t(1,20) = -2.12, p = .05. The partial eta squared of
.18 is considered a large effect size, and 18% of the variance
was explained by the technology infusion through the intern
presence.
On the question, "Rate your students on acceleration of
learning, since infusion of technology in your school," the
May 2011 response (M = 3.8794, SD = .35378) was signifi-
cantly greater than the November 2010 response (M =
3.5598, SD = .57923), t(1,20) = -2.32, p = .03. The partial
eta squared of .21 is considered a large effect size, and 21%
of the variance was explained by the technology infusion
through the intern presence.
On the question, "Rate your students on proficiency with
computer technology, since infusion of technology in your
school," the May 2011 response (M = 3.9165, SD = .34026)
was significantly greater than the November 2010 response
(M = 3.6109, SD = .41576), t(1,20) = -2.87, p = .01. The
partial eta squared of .29 is considered a large effect size, and
29% of the variance was explained by the technology infu-
sion through the intern presence.
Discussion
Use of technology in the classroom by trained faculty
leads to increased student achievement, closes achieve-
ment gaps, and decreases dropout rates (ISTE, 2008).
However, although many schools are equipped with the
Mundy et al. 5
latest instructional technologies, multiple studies have
indicated that more than half of the teachers equipped
with computers only use them for administrative func-
tions, and only half of their students report using technol-
ogy more than once a week (Abbott, 2003; National
Teacher Survey, 2005). One reason that faculty are not
using technology resources is lack of knowledge (Adams
& Bonk, 1995). In addition, a lack of confidence in one's
ability to use technology and a corresponding lack of com-
mitment to using it can add to a teacher's reluctance to
integrate technology into the classroom experience
(Ertmer et al., 2007). Many faculty members lack the
technological proficiency needed to take advantage of
these new technologies, making them unable to bring
these technologies into the classroom and leading to many
standing unused in the classroom.

The "effective professional development of teachers in
the integration of technology into instruction" is the number
one factor for success (ISTE, 2008, p. 7). Faculty members
need not only to learn how to use technology at a basic level
but also to learn how to integrate that technology into their
curricula (Baylor & Ritchie, 2002; Becker, 2001; Redish,
1997; Reynolds & Morgan, 2001; Roberts, 2003; VanFossen,
2001; Wenglinsky, 1998). Faculty training is the most sig-
nificant factor that could improve attitudes toward the inte-
gration of technology in the classroom learning experience
(Berson, 1996; The United States Department of Education,
2005; Reynolds & Morgan, 2001; Yildirim, 2000; Yildirim
& Kiraz, 1999).
Teachers that were part of DOT USA's TeachUp! program
perceived a significant increase in the areas of student engage-
ment, student excitement, student acceleration of learning,
and student proficiency with computer technology after the
completion of the program in which they received training,
coaching, and assistance in increasing the use of technology
in the classroom to make their lessons more engaging and
provide successful learning experiences from a program
intern. With the understanding that teachers in the United
States are professionals in the classroom, we give value to
teacher perceptions of technology use in education and as
such are able to determine that the integration of technology
in the classroom is beneficial to the student.
Recommendations
DOT USA's TeachUp! program has addressed the need for
teacher technology training by recruiting, training, and
placing tech-savvy young professionals, typically digital
natives, in "high need" public schools. These interns spend
a year or more training, coaching, and assisting teachers in
increasing their use of technology to make the classroom
more engaging and provide a successful learning experi-
ence. This ongoing one-on-one mentoring and follow-up
support is available to address teachers' daily challenges,
alleviating the fear of the unknown while increasing knowl-
edge, proficiency, and efficacy. The increase in the use of
technology in the classrooms has resulted in growth in stu-
dent engagement, excitement, acceleration of learning, and
proficiency with computer technology over the year, as
perceived by teaching professionals. Technology infusion
through the DOT USA TeachUp! Program has had a sig-
nificant effect on the students, and it is recommended that
this type of professional development be tried in more
school districts.
Faculty members need to learn not only how to use tech-
nology at a basic level but also how to integrate that technol-
ogy into their curricula (Baylor & Ritchie, 2002; Becker,
2001; Redish, 1997; Reynolds & Morgan, 2001; Roberts,
2003; VanFossen, 2001; Wenglinsky, 1998). As well, further
research needs to look specifically at the integration of tech-
nology into the curriculum at all levels of education.
Finally, there should be a clear focus on these digital natives
who have entered the workforce as educators. Although the
digital natives can be assumed to have some expertise in com-
munication (females) and gaming (males), they do not neces-
sarily have the expertise to use these technologies to facilitate
and improve classroom learning. Digital natives must be
taught how their acquired skills can be used to integrate tech-
nology into the classroom curriculum to provide complex cog-
nitive engagement for their students (Warschauer, 2007). DOT
USA's TeachUp! program allows for this specific type of
learning to occur as the interns can work with their teacher
counterparts at their own level of comfort. In the future,
research should be conducted to discover the type of approach
that works best with digital native teachers.
