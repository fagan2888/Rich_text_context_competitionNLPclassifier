Race and self assessed health status: the role of
socioeconomic factors in the USA
Xinhua Steve Ren, Benjamin C Amick III
Abstract
Study objective - To estimate relative odds
ratios and to ascertain the relative con-
tribution of each socioeconomic covariate
in explaining racial disparities in self as-
sessed health status (for example, global
health perceptions and functional lim-
itations of daily activities).
Design- Nationalrepresentative datafrom
the 1987-88 national survey offamilies and
households, a multistage, stratified prob-
ability sample of non-institutionalised
American adults age 19 and older, were
used. Logistic regression models enabled
a multistage building strategy to be used
in the analyses.
Participants and setting - The study in-
cluded three racial groups: whites (n=
9419), blacks (n = 2391), and Hispanics (n =
1004). While face to face interviews were
carried out with each respondent, some
portions of the interview were self ad-
ministered to collect sensitive in-
formation.
Main results - Compared with whites,
blacks and Hispanics were more likely to
assess health as poor and report having
functional limitations of daily activities.
Socioeconomic factors tended to play a
different role in explaining racial dis-
parities in self assessed health status. In
global health, education tended to play a
significant role in accounting for health
disparities between whites and Hispanics.
In functional limitations, none of the co-
variates explained racial differences for
blacks, whereas for Hispanics, education
and marital status explained racial differ-
ences.
Conclusions - The debate over whether
race is a proxy for socioeconomic con-
ditions or race influences health in-
dependent of socioeconomic factors
depends on the measure ofhealth and ra-
cial group included in the study. Future
studies should examine separately the
differential impacts of various socio-
economic factors on varying domains of
health.
(Jr Epidemiol Community Health 1996;50:269-273)
Despite consistent evidence describing dis-
parities in self assessed health status among
racial groups, little consensus has been reached
on how to explain these disparities.1-3 One
perspective considers race as a proxy for social
class (as measured by income or education)
and views the relationship between race and
health as "spurious." Based on the finding
that the influences of race on health tend to
disappear after adjusting for income or edu-
cation, the proponents of this perspective sug-
gest that the gap in health outcomes among
racial groups would simply close significantly
after reducing class inequality.4 An alternative
perspective considers race as representing more
than social class. The fact that the relationship
between race and health is pervasive even after
adjusting for socioeconomic status has led to
the conclusion that racial disparities are robust
indicators of a wide range of social conditions
including not only socioeconomic status, but
also living arrangements and racism."7
However, in assessing the importance ofrace
in explaining racial disparities in health, most
studies tend to control for, instead ofanalysing,
socioeconomic status. In these analyses, the
dynamics ofthe effects ofsocioeconomic status
in explaining racial disparities in health have
often been overlooked. A few studies have ex-
amined the interaction between race and socio-
economic status on health using a stratification
approach, that is, dividing the sample into racial
groups to estimate the effects ofsocioeconomic
status separately for whites, blacks, and His-
panics."9 These studies are necessary, but they
are insufficient to identify critical features of
socioeconomic status or to disentangle the sep-
arate effects of socioeconomic status on health
across racial groups. Extending our earlier ex-
ploration ofthe subject,3 we adopted a different
statistical approach (that is, a multistage model
building strategy) in this study to further ex-
plore the role of various socioeconomic con-
ditions in accounting for racial disparities in
self assessed health status (as measured by
general health perceptions and functional lim-
itations of daily activities).
Methods
Data for this study were obtained from the
1987-88 national survey offamilies and house-
holds (NSFH). The NSFH, a national rep-
resentative survey, was a multistage, stratified
probability sample of non-institutionalised
American adults age 19 and older.'0 The survey
randomly selected one adult from each house-
hold to be the primary respondent. The NSFH
adopted a face to face interview procedure,
but some portions of the interview in which
sensitive information was required were self
administered.

The interview was conducted in either Eng-
lish or Spanish. The initial translation of all
questionnaires into Spanish was pretested
amnong Puerto Ricans in New York and also
reviewed by people familiar with^ Mexican
American usage. After revision, another pretest
was conducted in a Puerto Rican area of New
York and in a Mexican American area of Los
Angeles. Bilingual interviewers were hired to
work in areas where there was a significant
concentration of Spanish speaking people. The
interviewee was given the option of taking the
interview in Spanish or English. A total of 259
interviews were conducted in Spanish (2% of
the total sample). The average interview lasted
1
hour and 40 minutes. In the NSFH no
attempt was made to obtain interviews with
people who did not speak either Spanish or
English. A total of 198 respondents were not
interviewed because of their inability to be
interviewed in English or Spanish.
The NSFH contained a main sample of9643
respondents and an over sample of 3374 mi-
norities and households containing single par-
ent families, step families, and recently married
and cohabiting couples. The overall response
rate was 75.5% for the main sample and 76.8%
for the over sample. Following the NSFH,
sampling weights were used to adjust for the
unequal representation of the over sampled
populations. 'Â°
The NSFH gathered information on four
racial groups: whites, blacks, Hispanics, and
"others" from the survey question, "Which of
the groups on this card best describe you?"
Due to small sample size, we excluded 168
respondents who reported "others" and 35
respondents who were missing on this selfiden-
tified race category. Hence, the study included
a total of 12 814 respondents: 9419 whites
(81%), 2391 blacks (I 1 %), and 1004 Hispanics
(7%) (see table 1). Among the Hispanic re-
spondents, 630 (60%) were Mexican, 191
(16%) Puerto Rican, 44 (6%) Cuban, and 139
(18%) other Hispanics.
Two self assessed health measures were ana-
lysed in the study: (1) global health assessment
and (2) functional limitations of daily activities.
Global health assessment was measured by
asking, "Compared with other people your age,
how would you describe your health?" Func-
tional limitations was measured by asking, "Do
you have health conditions that limit your abil-
ity to care for personal needs such as dressing,
eating, or going to the bathroom; move about
inside the house; work for pay; do day to day
household tasks; climb a flight of stairs; walk
six blocks?"
Although a number of studies have found
that global health perception is a powerful pre-
dictor of morbidity and mortality, recent evi-
dence has raised concerns about the utility of
using global health assessment measures for
racial comparisons." This new qualitative re-
search indicates that different racial groups
have different interpretations ofquestion mean-
ing and response categories.'2 We used global
health perception along with a measure offunc-
tional limitations of daily activities, a more
objective measure of health status, comparing
findings with both measures.
As would be expected in the general adult
population, the distributions of the two meas-
ures of health in the study are quite skewed
toward the healthy end of the scale. Because
of the small numbers of persons in the less
healthy categories, a dichotomous measure was
created for each of the two health domains.'3
The original five response categories of global
health perception were collapsed to two rep-
resenting "good health" (including responses
of "very good" and "good") and "not good
health" (including responses of "fair", "poor",
and "very poor"), whereas functional lim-
itations of daily activities were recoded to
represent "yes" or "no" answers ofhaving func-
tional limitations. The use of dichotomous
measures was supported by our preliminary
analyses,3 in which we used SAS logistic re-
gression for an ordinal response (or polytomous
logistic regression) to analyse global health as-
sessment and functional limitations of daily
activities.'4 In these preliminary analyses, we
tested the assumption of proportionality for
the ordinal responses. The x2 tests were all
significant, indicating that logistic regression
models for an ordinal response were not ap-
propriate for the data.
The study also included three socioeconomic
covariates that have been previously hy-
pothesised to influence health: marital status
(married, separated/divorced/widowed, and
never married), years of schooling (< 11, 12,
and . 13), and income ($0-4999, $5000-9999,
$10 000-19 999, $20 000-29 999, and $30 000
or more). Age and sex, often linked to health
outcomes, were also included in the study as
two controlling variables.
Descriptive characteristics ofthe study popu-
lation are contained in table 1. Compared with
whites, blacks and Hispanics were younger, less
educated, less likely to be married, and had

Therefore, in presenting the statistical results,
we opted to use a visual technique (presenting
the odds ratios for race only) instead of a
conventional table format so as to describe
patterns of influences of race on health out-

characteristics.
