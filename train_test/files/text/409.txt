Trends and Cardiovascular Mortality Effects of State-Level
Blood Pressure and Uncontrolled Hypertension
in the United States
Majid Ezzati, PhD; Shefali Oza, SB; Goodarz Danaei, MD; Christopher J.L. Murray, MD, DPhil
Background--Blood pressure is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality and has lifestyle and
healthcare determinants that vary across states. Only self-reported hypertension status is measured at the state level in
the United States. Our aim was to estimate levels and trends in state-level mean systolic blood pressure (SBP), the
prevalence of uncontrolled systolic hypertension, and cardiovascular mortality attributable to all levels of higher-than-
optimal SBP.
Methods and Results--We estimated the relationship between actual SBP/uncontrolled hypertension and self-reported
hypertension, use of blood pressure medication, and a set of health system and sociodemographic variables in the
nationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We applied this relationship to identical
variables from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to estimate state-specific mean SBP and uncontrolled
hypertension. We used the comparative risk assessment methods to estimate cardiovascular mortality attributable to
higher-than-optimal SBP. In 2001­2003, age-standardized uncontrolled hypertension prevalence was highest in the
District of Columbia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Texas, Georgia, and South Carolina (18% to 21% for men and
24% to 26% for women) and lowest in Vermont, Minnesota, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Iowa, and Colorado (15%
to 16% for men and 21% for women). Women had a higher prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension than men in every
state by 4 (Arizona) to 7 (Kansas) percentage points. In the 1990s, uncontrolled hypertension in women increased the
most in Idaho and Oregon (by 6 percentage points) and the least in the District of Columbia and Mississippi (by 3
percentage points). For men, the worst-performing states were New Mexico and Louisiana (decrease of 0.6 and 1.3
percentage points), and the best-performing states were Vermont and Indiana (decrease of 4 and 3 percentage points).
Age-standardized cardiovascular mortality attributable to higher-than-optimal SBP ranged from 200 to 220 per 100 000
(Minnesota and Massachusetts) to 360 to 370 per 100 000 (District of Columbia and Mississippi) for women and from
210 per 100 000 (Colorado and Utah) to 370 per 100 000 (Mississippi) and 410 per 100 000 (District of Columbia) for men.
Conclusions--Lifestyle and pharmacological interventions for lowering blood pressure are particularly needed in the South
and Appalachia, and with emphasis on control among women. Self-reported data on hypertension diagnosis from the
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System can be used to obtain unbiased state-level estimates of blood pressure and
uncontrolled hypertension as benchmarks for priority setting and for designing and evaluating intervention programs.

High blood pressure is an important risk factor for cardio-
vascular disease and mortality, accounting for an estimated
14% of cardiovascular deaths worldwide and 18% in high-
income countries.1 Although in some clinical applications spe-
cific thresholds are used to define hypertension (eg, 140 mm Hg
for systolic blood pressure [SBP]),2 epidemiological studies
have established that cardiovascular disease and mortality risks
increase continuously with blood pressure from levels well
below the conventional thresholds used in the definition of
hypertension.3,4 Therefore, in addition to hypertension diagnosis

and control, shifting the whole distribution of blood pressure is
important for reducing cardiovascular disease mortality. In the
United States, age-standardized mean blood pressure declined
for both men and women between the 1970s and early 1990s as
measured in the first 3 rounds of the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), possibly as a result
of a combination of lifestyle and pharmacological interven-
tions.5,6 Since the early 1990s, however, these declines appear to
have stagnated or reversed, possibly because of the rise in risk
factors associated with blood pressure (eg, overweight and
obesity) and the fact that hypertension remains underdiagnosed
and only partially controlled.7­9
Editorial p 860
Clinical Perspective p 914
State-specific data on levels and trends of blood pressure
and hypertension are essential inputs for priority setting; for
the design, delivery, and evaluation of interventions; and for
understanding disparities in hypertension levels, diagnosis,
and treatment.10­13 In the United States, NHANES III pro-
vided information on blood pressure in broad regions of the
country,14­16 but estimates in NHANES III were based on data
from only 81 of the 3141 US counties in 26 states. At the state
level, only self-reported hypertension status is measured in the
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).17­20
BRFSS estimates cannot be directly used to assess cardiovascu-
lar risk and to evaluate interventions for a number of reasons (see
also earlier assessments of BRFSS).21­23 First, some people may
be unaware of their hypertension status because they have not
had contact with a health professional or have not been diag-
nosed during such a contact. Second, some people who were
diagnosed with hypertension may have effectively controlled
and lowered their actual blood pressure through lifestyle and/or
pharmacological interventions. Because the risk of cardiovascu-
lar diseases is determined by actual blood pressure and not by
whether this level is maintained through interventions,24 such
people are no longer a part of the "high­cardiovascular-risk"
group. Finally, self-reported questions allow analysis of only the
high-risk (hypertension) status, not the underlying continuous
exposure.
We used 2 national health and health examination surveys,
NHANES and BRFSS, to characterize the relationship be-
tween actual SBP and self-reported hypertension status, use
of blood pressure medication, and a set of health system and
sociodemographic variables. We then used this relationship to
estimate for the first time mean SBP and uncontrolled
hypertension prevalence at the state level by sex and age
group for 2 time periods, 1988­1992 and 2001­2003. We
then calculated cardiovascular mortality attributable to all
levels of higher-than-optimal SBP at the state level.
Methods
Data Sources
NHANES, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, is part of a cross-sectional survey series conducted in the
United States since 1959. This nationally representative survey uses
a complex, multistage, stratified, clustered probability sample design
to determine health and nutrition characteristics of the civilian,
noninstitutionalized population 2 months of age. NHANES in-
cludes an in-person interview and a subsequent physical examination
and measurement component in a mobile examination clinic (MEC);
those unable to visit the MEC are offered a limited examination at
home. NHANES III was conducted from 1988 to 1994. Beginning in
1999, NHANES became a continuous survey with data released in
2-year increments. We used NHANES 1999­2002 because complete
data files for 2003­2004 were not yet released at the time of analysis.
The response rate for the household interview was 86%, 82%, and
84% for NHANES III, NHANES 1999­2000, and NHANES 2001­
2002, respectively. The corresponding response rates for the medical
examination after completing the household interview were 92%,
93%, and 95% (The overall response rate for medical examination is
therefore the product of the 2 separate response rates). Additional
information on survey design and methods, including blood pressure
measurement, is available elsewhere25,26 and online
(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm).
BRFSS, overseen by the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion, is an annual cross-sectional telephone survey that started in
1984. Currently, the survey is conducted by health departments in all
50 states and the District of Columbia using a random-digit dialing
method to obtain a state-representative sample of the civilian,
noninstitutionalized population 18 years of age. The state samples
can be combined to form a nationally representative sample. In 2002,
the response rate among calls that were answered ranged from 62%
to 99% by state, with a median rate of 77%. Additional information
on the full survey design is available elsewhere20,27 and online
(http://www.cdc.gov/brfss).
We included adults 30 years of age in NHANES and BRFSS
who answered this self-reported hypertension question: Have you
ever been told by a health professional that you have high blood
pressure?
Statistical Analysis
We used measured and self-reported data from NHANES, which are
representative at the national but not state level, to characterize the
relationship between measured SBP and self-reported hypertension
status, blood pressure medication, and a set of health system and
sociodemographic variables listed in Table 1. This relationship was
estimated in a series of linear regressions in which the dependent
variable was the individual's SBP measurements and the indepen-
dent variables were the health system and sociodemographic covari-
ates (Figure 1). We conducted the analysis based on SBP because it
has been found to be a better predictor of cardiovascular risk than
diastolic blood pressure.2­4
We estimated the regression model separately for 6 subgroups of
the NHANES data. Men and women were divided into 3 groups
each. Group A comprised those who answered no to the question,
"Have you ever been told by a health professional that you have high
blood pressure?" Group B included those who answered yes to that
question and no to "Are you currently taking medicine for your high
blood pressure?" Group C included those who answered yes to both
questions. We used these divisions because the effects of health
system and sociodemographic factors (eg, age or insurance status) on
blood pressure may vary across these groups, as confirmed by our
regression coefficients.
We used a random-effects linear regression model to estimate SBP.28
When 1 measurement of the dependent variable (ie, SBP) is available
for each subject, the random-effects model can be used to separate the
regression error term (ie, unexplained variation) into stochastic (within-
person) and systematic (between-person) components. The second term
can be used to obtain unbiased estimates of the SD of the blood pressure
distribution in the population. In this regression, the dependent variable
was each subject's SBP measurements, excluding the first measurement.
We also used a standard logistic regression to estimate the proportion of
the population with uncontrolled hypertension, defined as the average of
MEC-based SBP measurements, excluding the first measurement,
140 mm Hg (Table 1).2
We applied the regression coefficients to identical questions in
BRFSS, which is state representative, to estimate SBP for each
BRFSS observation in the years corresponding to each NHANES
round (Table 1 and Figure 1). The BRFSS sample was stratified into
the same 6 groups as those used for the above regressions. The

individual BRFSS observations were then pooled using appropriate
sample weights to obtain estimates of mean SBP and prevalence of
uncontrolled hypertension by age, sex, and state. We present the
results in 2 broad age groups (30 to 59 years of age and 60 years
of age), age standardized to the 2000 US population to account for
differences in age distributions across states and/or over time.
We estimated cardiovascular mortality attributable to higher-than-
optimal SBP using the methods of the comparative risk assessment
project, which is described in detail elsewhere.29,30 On the basis of
the evidence from observational and intervention studies, attributable
mortality was estimated by calculating proportional reduction in
cause-specific cardiovascular mortality if the current SBP distribu-
tion was reduced to the optimal level of 115 mm Hg (SD,
6 mm Hg).3 Relative risks for cause-specific mortality for each
10-mm Hg SBP increment were from the meta-analyses of the
Prospective Studies Collaboration.4

*For each observation, NHANES 1988­1994 contains up to 3 MEC-based SBP measurements and NHANES 1999­2002 contains up to 4
measurements. We excluded the first measurement, as is also recommended by NHANES documentation, because it was significantly higher than
subsequent ones. We dropped observations that did not have at least 1 MEC-based blood pressure measurement.
Average MEC-based SBP for each individual was calculated, excluding the first measurement.
For consistency, race in BRFSS and NHANES 1999­2002 was analyzed in the same categories as NHANES III, which had fewer race categories.
§This variable was defined as a composite of multiple questions about physician contact for specific conditions in BRFSS.
Insurance status was not included in the 1988­1992 period (NHANES III) because the insurance question is asked only from 1991 in BRFSS.
Regression results for 1999­2002 including and excluding insurance status were similar. The difference in regression coefficients for 1999­2002
including and excluding insurance status was not statistically significant; therefore, insurance was retained in the analysis for this period.
¶Body mass index was corrected for bias in self-reported height and weight in telephone interviews using methods reported elsewhere.31
#The years 1994, 2000, and 2002 were not included in the analysis because BRFSS in most states did not ask about self-reported hypertension.
The years 1993, 1994, and 1999 were not included in the analysis because the blood pressure medication question was not asked in BRFSS. In 1991
and 1992, BRFSS asked only if medication has been prescribed. A comparison of this question with the medication use question during 1988­1990
showed that almost all individuals (97.5%) who reported being prescribed medication also reported using medication. Therefore, we used these
variables as equivalent. To have a sufficient number of years for NHANES 1999­2002 period, we included the 2003 BRFSS, assuming that 2003 data
are not systematically different from those between 1999 and 2002. Wyoming was excluded from the 1988­1992 analysis because self-reported
hypertension status was not asked in BRFSS in this state.

140 mm Hg increased by 4.3 percentage points; for Amer-
ican men, it declined by 2 percentage points (Table 2). Both
men and women had minor increases in self-reported hyper-
tension over this period (0.5 and 2.2 percentage points,
respectively). Measured prevalence of uncontrolled hyperten-
sive status (including both those who are aware of their
hypertension and those who are not) is 10 percentage points
lower than self-reported hypertension in NHANES for both
time periods, indicating that many of those diagnosed with
hypertension have controlled their blood pressure. Between
the early 1990s and early 2000s, the largest change in SBP
occurred in women 60 years of age, whose mean SBP
increased by 4.5 mm Hg and uncontrolled hypertension
prevalence increased by 9 percentage points, compared with
a decrease of 0.4 mm Hg and 2.2 percentage points in older
men (Table 2). Below 60 years of age, men had higher mean
SBP than women in both 1988­1994 and 1999­2002, al-
though the sex difference declined over time, reflecting the
unfavorable differential trends among women. Proportion-
ally, fewer individuals who knew their hypertension status
remained unmedicated in 1999­2002 compared with 1988­
1992 (Table I of the online-only Data Supplement). Of those
using medication, a larger proportion achieved SBP below the
140-mm Hg threshold in 2001­2003 than 1988­1992 (see
also Hajjar and Kotchen8).
Previous analyses have shown that self-reported weight
and height differ between in-person interviews with subse-
quent measurement (NHANES) and telephone surveys
(BRFSS).31 Testing whether self-reported hypertension is
affected by the same phenomenon shows that although age-
and sex-specific self-reported hypertension prevalence dif-
fered slightly between NHANES and BRFSS, particularly in
those 50 years of age, no consistent pattern is apparent to
indicate systematic bias as a result of telephone survey versus
in-person interview (Figure I of the online-only Data
Supplement).
Regression Results
Regression coefficients are provided in the online-only Data
Supplement. A common result in all 24 regressions (6
regressions for each time period for both the random-effects
linear and logistic models) was that SBP and uncontrolled
hypertension status increased with age, consistent with the
vast available evidence on age association of blood pres-
sure.3,9 However, the age gradient was attenuated for those
using medication (ie, group C), especially in 1999­2002, and
strongest in those diagnosed with hypertension but not using
medication (group B). This result possibly indicates the
effectiveness of blood pressure control, which also may have
improved over time.

higher SBP in those not diagnosed with hypertension (group

mass index was present in group B, but the coefficients were
nonsignificant; an almost universally nonsignificant negative
relationship was present in group C. These findings may
illustrate stricter blood pressure control among those who are
overweight or obese once they are diagnosed (see also Gregg
et al6). Not having seen a doctor in the past year had a
significant and positive effect on SBP, except for those
currently managing their hypertension, for whom the coeffi-
cient for physician visit was no longer significant. After
controlling for all other factors, including stratification by
awareness and medication status, blacks had consistently
higher SBP than whites.
To validate that levels of variables included in the model
were similar between the 2 surveys, we applied the estimated
regression coefficients to data from both NHANES itself and
BRFSS to compare estimated national mean SBP and uncon-
trolled hypertension. The largest differences in age- and
sex-specific national estimates were 1.1 mm Hg and 2 per-
centage points, respectively. Similar validation checks by
race and region gave results within 0.6 mm Hg and 1.4
percentage points, respectively.
State-Level Uncontrolled Hypertension Status and
Self-Reported Hypertension
In 2001­2003, age-standardized uncontrolled hypertension
prevalence was highest in the District of Columbia and
primarily southern states, including Mississippi, Louisiana,
Alabama, Texas, Georgia, and South Carolina (18% to 21%
for men and 24% to 26% for women); it was lowest in the
Midwest and the Northeast, including Vermont, Minnesota,
Connecticut, New Hampshire, Iowa, and Colorado (15% to
16% for men and 21% for women) (Figure 2).
Prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension increased among
women and decreased among men in every state, but signif-
icant variations were present in state-level trends. For men,
the smallest decrease was predominantly in the South,
whereas female trends had no clear geographical pattern. For
women, age-standardized uncontrolled hypertension preva-
lence increased the most in Idaho and Oregon (6 percentage
points) and the least in the District of Columbia and Missis-
sippi (3 percentage points); for men, the largest decreases
were in Vermont and Indiana (3 to 4 percentage points), and
the smallest were in New Mexico and Louisiana (0.6 to 1.3
percentage points). Correlation coefficients between preva-
lence in 1988­1994 and change in prevalence during the
1990s were 0.12 for men and 0.43 for women.
In 2001­2003, women had higher uncontrolled hyperten-
sion than men in every state by 4 (Arizona) to 7 (Kansas)
percentage points. The female-male difference in 1988­1992
was on average 1.4 percentage points across states and as low
as 0.2 in Arkansas and Louisiana. No relationship existed
between change in female and male hypertension prevalence
between the early 1990s and early 2000s (correlation coeffi-
cient for sex-specific hypertension change, 0.07). For exam-
ple, the largest and smallest declines in male prevalence were
in Vermont (3.8 percentage points) and New Mexico (0.6
percentage points), but both states had about an average
increase in female prevalence (4.2 and 5.0 percentage points,
respectively). Similarly, the smallest increase in female prev-
alence was in the District of Columbia (2.8 percentage
points), and the largest increases were in Idaho and Oregon
(6.1 and 5.9 percentage points); these states had relatively
similar decreases in male prevalence (1.6, 1.5, and 2.5
percentage points in the District of Columbia, Idaho, and
Oregon, respectively).
In 2001­2003, self-reported hypertension was higher than
measured high-risk status for both men and women in every
state, but the difference was larger for men (Figure 3 and
Figure II and Table XI of the online-only Data Supplement).
Although women had higher measured hypertension preva-
lence than men in all states, they had lower self-reported
prevalence in all but 6 states (Alabama, Alaska, District of
Columbia, Georgia, Louisiana, and North Carolina). Further-
more, self-reported hypertension and measured uncontrolled
hypertension had lower correlation across states for men than
for women (Figure 3). For example, men in Washington and
the District of Columbia had self-reported hypertension
prevalence of 30% to 31%, but actual prevalence of those
with blood pressure 140 mm Hg was 16% in the former and
21% in the latter. Similarly, West Virginia and New Mexico
had actual prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension of 17%,
but self-reported hypertension prevalence was 39% in the
former and 25% in the latter.

of age) had higher mean SBP (by 5.8 to 12.6 mm Hg) and
uncontrolled hypertension (by 14 to 20 percentage points)
than men in every state in 2001­2003. Iowa, New Jersey,
Wyoming, and South Dakota had the smallest male-female
disparities; Nevada, Alaska, and Colorado had the largest.
Younger and middle-aged (30 to 59 years of age) women had
lower SBP and uncontrolled hypertension than men of the
same ages in all states except in Arizona, Hawaii, Nevada,
Rhode Island, and Wyoming, where women had slightly
higher prevalence.
Among women, mean SBP and uncontrolled hypertension
increased in both age groups and every state in the 1990s. The
state trends for males were less homogeneous, For older men,
uncontrolled hypertension declined by 1 to 7 percentage

points in every state, and mean blood pressure declined in
most states except for a few that had a negligible
(0.5 mm Hg) increase. Mean SBP and uncontrolled hyper-
tension of younger and middle-aged men had a mixed
performance, including decline (eg, Iowa), stagnation, or
slight increase (eg, Alabama, Illinois, and New Mexico).
Cardiovascular Mortality Attributable to
Higher-Than-Optimal SBP by State
Age-standardized cardiovascular mortality attributable to
higher-than-optimal SBP ranged from 200 to 220 per 100 000
(Minnesota and Massachusetts) to 360 to 370 per 100 000
(District of Columbia and Mississippi) for women and from
210 (Colorado and Utah) to 370 (Mississippi) and 410 per
100 000 (District of Columbia) for men; the national averages
were 260 and 290 per 100 000 for women and men, respec-
tively (Figure 5). Of the states with the highest SBP-
attributable cardiovascular mortality rate, all but Arkansas
and Wyoming for women and South Dakota and North
Dakota for men were also those with the highest mean SBP.
In this latter group of states, even moderate SBP levels led to
relatively high attributable mortality because background
cardiovascular mortality risk is high. The cross-state correla-
tion between age-standardized mean SBP and age-
standardized cardiovascular mortality rate attributable to SBP
was 0.59 for men and 0.64 for women.
Discussion
Our results illustrate important geographic patterns and trends
in sex- and age-specific SBP and its cardiovascular mortality
impacts that were masked by the shortcomings of self-
reported data. The state-level estimates show that the District
of Columbia, the South, and the Appalachia had the highest
SBP and uncontrolled hypertension, consistent with regional
results from NHANES III14­16 and from the Coronary Artery
Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study,11
with Mississippi and the District of Columbia faring the
worst. The Northern Plains, the Northeast, and the Midwest
had the lowest levels of SBP and uncontrolled hypertension.
In the District of Columbia, Alabama, and Mississippi, the
effects of high SBP were further magnified by high back-
ground cardiovascular mortality risk, leading to a very large
absolute cardiovascular mortality rate attributable to this risk
factor.
SBP and uncontrolled hypertension increased among
women in the 1990s, particularly in older ages, in all US
states, but considerable cross-state variation was present in
levels and trends. Using the relative risks from the Prospec-
tive Studies Collaboration,4 we can attribute 2% of coronary
heart disease deaths and 2% of stroke deaths (400 annual
deaths) to the average 3.1-mm Hg rise in mean SBP in young
and middle-aged (30 to 59 years of age) women between the
2 NHANES rounds; the proportion of deaths attributable to
the 4.6-mm Hg rise in blood pressure in women 60 years of
age was 3% for coronary heart disease and 4% for stroke
(12 000 deaths annually). Male SBP declined in older ages
in all states, with more heterogeneous trends in the young and
middle-aged. As a result of differential trends by sex, the
male-female disparities in SBP and uncontrolled hyperten-
sion in older ages have increased in every state since
1988­1992; the female advantage in younger and middle-
aged adults has shrunk or reversed.
An important finding of our analysis was that little corre-
lation existed between changes in SBP of men and women
across states. This indicates that state-level programs may not
have systematically and uniformly benefited all demographic
groups. Self-reported hypertension was higher than measured
high-risk status in every state and for both sexes, broadly
indicating benefits from hypertension diagnosis and manage-
ment, especially among men. Definitive conclusions about
diagnosis coverage and subsequent management among those
diagnosed with hypertension and how they may vary by sex
require further investigation, especially in longitudinal stud-
ies such as the CARDIA study.11

lifestyle, and health system determinants of blood pressure
and hypertension diagnosis, other factors affect these such as
diet and quality of care.14,32 For instance, we were unable to
include salt intake, an important dietary determinant of blood
pressure, in the model because this question is not asked in
BRFSS. The effects of some of these factors may be captured
by the variables in our model (eg, self-reported hypertension,
body mass index, insurance status, and visit to a doctor). If
the unexplained effects vary systematically across states, the
model might underestimate cross-state variation in blood
pressure. To consider the role of regional variation in blood
pressure above and beyond the variables in our model, we
repeated the analysis for 1988­1994 (NHANES III) and
included region as a variable in the model. (Region is not
included in the 1999­2002 data.) The resulting estimates of
uncontrolled hypertension ranged between 16.2% and 23.7%
for men and between 16.0% and 22.6% for women compared
with the current range of 17.6% to 22.3% for men and 16.4%
to 23.1% for women. The correlation of estimated uncon-
trolled hypertension across states with and without inclusion
of region was 0.74 for men and 0.85 for women. Second,
although BRFSS provides state-level data for the variables
included in the model, some instruments have changed over
time or have been implemented in some years only (Table 1).
As a result, the analysis could use BRFSS data for some years
only. Third, we conducted our analysis using SBP because of
its stronger relationship with cardiovascular disease out-
comes. Some of the people self-reporting hypertension may
have been diagnosed on the basis of their diastolic blood
pressure, which may cause error in our estimates (see Table I
in the online-only Data Supplement for details). The single
best way to reduce uncertainty in our analysis would be to add
a validation component to BRFSS that includes measured
blood pressure for a random subset of interviewees.
Despite the uncertainties, these first estimates of SBP and
uncontrolled hypertension and their effects on cardiovascular
mortality provide important guides and benchmarks for pri-
ority setting and for designing and evaluating cardiovascular
prevention programs at the state level. Increasing the effec-
tive coverage of lifestyle (eg, reduced salt intake) and
pharmacological interventions should be a policy priority in
states with high levels of uncontrolled hypertension, with
specific emphasis on improving diagnosis and control among
women. Furthermore, in states where the absolute cardiovas-
cular risk associated with higher-than-optimal blood pressure
is high because SBP level is high and/or background cardio-
vascular risk is high, blood pressure control should be
accompanied by management of other cardiovascular risks on
the basis of similar analysis of other risk factors such as body
mass index,31 blood glucose, and cholesterol. Regular report-
ing of risk factor levels and trends also can help us evaluate
the performance of programs in individual states and learn
from states with successful programs.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
High blood pressure is one the most important risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Information on blood pressure and
uncontrolled hypertension is needed for priority setting and for interventions. In the United States, national data on blood
pressure are obtained by measurement, but at the state level, the data are limited to self-reported hypertension diagnosis.
Such self-reported data may be biased for several reasons, including undiagnosed hypertension among people who may not
have had health system contact and reduced risk among those with diagnosis who have effectively controlled their
hypertension status. This analysis uses self-reported hypertension diagnosis and a number of other indicators such as
insurance status, history of contact with a doctor, body mass index, age, and other sociodemographic factors to estimate
true blood pressure and hypertension status. The results show that uncontrolled hypertension was highest in the District of
Columbia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Texas, Georgia, and South Carolina (18% to 21% of men and 24% to 26%
of women in these states had uncontrolled hypertension after accounting for differences in age in these states). Uncontrolled
hypertension was lowest in Vermont, Minnesota, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Iowa, and Colorado, ranging from 15% to
16% for men and 21% for women. In the 1990s, uncontrolled hypertension increased among women, especially those
60 years of age, in every state. As a result, early in the 2000s, women had a higher prevalence of uncontrolled
hypertension than men in every state by 4 to 7 percentage points. Lifestyle and pharmacological interventions for lowering
blood pressure are particularly needed in the South and Appalachia, with emphasis on control among women.
