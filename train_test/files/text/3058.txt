LEAD EXPOSURE IS AN IMPORTANT
public health problem.1 Be-
cause millions of American
children are believed to have el-
evated blood lead levels, screening pro-
grams for childhood lead exposure have
been established by the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (CDC).1 In
1984, as many as 3 to 4 million chil-
dren were estimated to have blood lead
levels greater than 0.72 µmol/L (15 µg/
dL),2 and even lower levels of lead ex-
posure have been associated with ad-
verseneuropsychologicaldevelopment.3
Among adults, work-related lead expo-
sure has been targeted as an area of con-
cern by the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration.1

One animal study that compared the ef-
fectiveness of EDTA with ascorbic acid
in treating the toxic effects of lead re-
ported that orally administered ascor-
bic acid had chelating properties simi-
lar to those of parenterally administered
EDTA.4 Anecdotalreportsfrom1939and
1940 suggested that ascorbic acid may

exposure.5,6 However, subsequent small
trials among humans have yielded in-
conclusive results.7-11 To our knowl-
edge, there have been no population-
basedstudiesexaminingtherelationship
of ascorbic acid to lead toxicity.
To ascertain whether ascorbic acid
levels are associated with prevalence of
elevated blood lead levels, we ana-
lyzed data collected from the Third Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES III) that included
data about serum ascorbic acid levels
and blood lead levels in more than
19 000 Americans.
METHODS
Subjects
NHANES III was a national probability
survey of Americans conducted be-
tween 1988 and 1994 that used a strati-
fied, cluster sampling design to overs-
ample populations of special interest.12
Participantsaged2monthsorolderwere
enrolled, interviewed, and examined by
study personnel.12 Participants older
than 90 years were recorded as being 90
years old. For these analyses, partici-
pants were excluded if there were miss-
ing data on variables judged to be po-
tentialpredictorsofbloodleadlevels.We

Context Some animal studies suggest that orally administered ascorbic acid may che-
late lead and decrease the risk of the toxic effects of lead. However, results from sev-
eral small studies in humans have yielded inconclusive evidence of a beneficial effect
of ascorbic acid on lead toxicity.
Objective To examine the relationship between serum ascorbic acid levels and preva-
lence of elevated blood lead levels.
Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional analysis of a probability sample
of the US population enrolled in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey, 1988-1994 (4213 youths aged 6-16 years and 15 365 adults aged 17 years)
without a history of lead poisoning.
Main Outcome Measures Elevated and log blood lead levels by serum ascorbic
acid level.
Results A total of 22 youths (0.5%) and 57 adults (0.4%) had elevated blood lead
levels (defined as 0.72 µmol/L [15 µg/dL]) and 0.97 µmol/L [20 µg/dL], respec-
tively). After controlling for the effects of age, race, sex, income level, and dietary en-
ergy, fat, calcium, iron, and zinc intake, youths in the highest serum ascorbic acid ter-
tile had an 89% decreased prevalence of elevated blood lead levels compared with
youths in the lowest serum ascorbic acid tertile (odds ratio, 0.11; 95% confidence in-
terval, 0.04-0.35; P for trend = .002). Adults in the highest 2 serum ascorbic acid ter-
tiles had a 65% to 68% decreased prevalence of elevated blood lead levels compared
with adults in the lowest serum ascorbic acid tertile (P for trend = .03). As a continu-
ous predictor, serum ascorbic acid level was independently associated with decreased
log blood lead levels among adults (P.001), but not among youths (P = .14).
Conclusions Our data suggest that high serum levels of ascorbic acid are indepen-
dently associated with a decreased prevalence of elevated blood lead levels. If these
associations are related causally, ascorbic acid intake may have public health implica-
tions for control of lead toxicity.

did not analyze data from children aged
1 to 5 years because serum ascorbic acid
levels were not measured in these par-
ticipants. We excluded 28 youths (de-
fined as participants between the ages
of 6 and 16 years) who reported a his-
tory of lead poisoning and hence were
likelytohavereceivedtreatmenttolower
their blood lead levels; we excluded an
additional 36 adult and youth partici-
pants with serum ascorbic acid concen-
trations of questionable validity (ie,
170 µmol/L).13 After these exclu-
sions, complete data were available from
19 578 participants between the ages of
6 and 90 years for our analyses.
Measurements
NHANES III questionnaire data in-
cluded self-reported age, race, sex,
household income, history of smok-
ing, and intake of dietary energy, fat,
calcium, iron, zinc, and ascorbic acid.12
Quantitative nutrition data were col-
lected using a 24-hour dietary recall.
The questionnaires, dietary methods,
and examination procedures used in
NHANES III have been described else-
where.12 Questions addressing history
of cigarette smoking were not avail-
able for the youths.
Bloodleadlevelsweremeasuredatthe
CDC by atomic absorption spectrom-
etry.14 Blood lead levels of 0.72 µmol/L
(15 µg/dL) or higher in youths and 0.97
µmol/L (20 µg/dL) or higher in adults
were considered to be elevated based on
the NHANES III cut points for the re-
porting of abnormal laboratory val-
ues.12 Serum ascorbic acid levels were
measured at the CDC by high-perfor-
mance liquid chromatography15 and
ranged from 0 to 170 µmol/L.
Statistical Methods
We examined the distribution of ascor-
bic acid levels and other variables of in-
terest using sample weights. Because
study participants did not have an equal
probability of selection, sample weights
were required to incorporate these dif-
ferential probabilities, thereby permit-
ting the results to be generalizable to
the US population. We used logistic re-
gression to examine the relationship of
serum ascorbic acid, categorized into
tertiles, to elevated blood lead levels.
Multivariate models controlled for the
effects of age, race (white vs other), sex,
annual household income ($20 000
vs $20 000 per year), cigarette smok-
ing (never, past, current), and dietary
intake of energy, fat, calcium, iron, and
zinc.Weusedthedichotomousincome
variableinNHANESIIItomaximizethe
number of participants available for
analysis. A logarithmic transforma-
tion was performed to improve the sym-
metry of the distribution of blood lead
levels. We then performed linear re-
gression analyses, examining the rela-
tionship of serum ascorbic acid level to
log blood lead level.
Analyses were performed using Stata
software that included commands for
the analysis of complex survey data.16
We calculated odds ratios and 95% con-
fidence intervals to estimate the rela-
tive prevalence of elevated blood lead
levels. We considered 2-tailed P.05
to be statistically significant.
FIGURE 1 illustrates the indepen-
dent association between serum ascor-
bic acid level and elevated blood lead
level, plotting the prevalence of el-
evated blood lead level as a function of
serum ascorbic acid. The probability of
each individual having an elevated
blood lead level was predicted using the
multivariate logistic model. We then de-
termined the predicted proportion of
participants with an elevated blood
lead level within each 0.6-µmol/L (0.01-
mg/dL) increment of serum ascorbic
acid. Therefore, each point represents
the estimated proportion of partici-
pants within a given increment of se-
rum ascorbic acid with an elevated
blood lead level. FIGURE 2 shows the

acid. Each participant's log blood lead

RESULTS
The baseline characteristics of 15 365
adults and 4213 youths, aged 6 to 16
years,enrolledinNHANESIII,withcom-
pletedataavailablefortheseanalyses,are
listed in TABLE 1. A total of 57 adults
(0.4%) and 22 youths (0.5%) had
elevatedbloodleadlevels(0.97µmol/L
[20µg/dL]foradultsand0.72µmol/L
[15 µg/dL] for youths). Blood lead lev-
elsrangedfrom0.02µmol/L(0.5µg/dL)
to2.70µmol/L(56µg/dL)amongadults
andfrom0.02µmol/L(0.5µg/dL)to2.36
µmol/L (48.9 µg/dL) among youths.
Demographic characteristics, such as
race,sex,andlevelofhouseholdincome
and dietary data, were similar for adults
andyouths.Onaverage,serumascorbic
acid levels were consistent with normal
levels of this micronutrient.13
Among youths, unadjusted, age-
adjusted, and multivariate models re-
vealed that serum ascorbic acid levels
were inversely associated with preva-
lence of elevated blood lead levels
(TABLE 2). Youths in the highest se-
rum ascorbic acid tertile were 89%
less likely (95% confidence interval,
65%-96%) to have elevated blood lead
levels compared with youths in the
lowest serum ascorbic acid tertile (mul-
tivariate P for trend = .002). Among
adults, serum ascorbic acid level was
also associated with prevalence of el-
evated blood lead levels; all models re-
vealed that serum ascorbic acid levels
were inversely associated with preva-
lence of elevated blood lead levels

lowestserumascorbicacidtertile,adults
in the upper 2 tertiles were approxi-
mately 65% to 68% less likely to have
elevated blood lead levels (multivari-
ate P for trend = .03). Based on the mul-
tivariate models reported in Table 2, we
also examined the relationship of se-
rum ascorbic acid to prevalence of el-
evated blood lead level graphically by
plotting elevated blood lead level as a
function of serum ascorbic acid level
(Figure 1). This figure reveals a curvi-
linear relationship between serum
ascorbic acid and elevated blood lead
levels. Approximately 4% of youths and
2% of adults with the lowest serum
ascorbic acid levels had elevated blood
lead levels.

Bivariate correlation coefficients were

We substituted dietary ascorbic acid
intake for serum ascorbic acid, and re-
examined the relationship between
ascorbic acid and prevalence of el-
evated blood lead level. In multivariate
models, each 10-mg increment in di-
etary ascorbic acid intake among youths
was associated with a nonsignificant 1%
decrease in prevalence of elevated blood
lead level (P = .88). However, in multi-
variatemodelsthatsubstitutedserumfer-
ritin level for dietary iron, we detected
a trend toward lower prevalence of el-
evated blood lead levels among adults;
each 10-mg increment in dietary ascor-
bicacidintakewasassociatedwitha3.5%
decrease in the prevalence of elevated
blood lead level (P = .10).
COMMENT
Our principal finding was that serum
ascorbic acid level was inversely re-
lated to blood lead level among adults
and youths enrolled in NHANES III. We
observed no significant relationship,
however, between dietary ascorbic acid
intake and blood lead levels, suggest-
ing either that dietary estimates de-
rived from NHANES III were too im-
precise to permit the detection of the
association or that elevated blood lead
levels may increase the turnover of
ascorbic acid, thereby lowering serum
ascorbic acid levels. Although we can-
not exclude the latter possibility, there
is prior evidence consistent with the hy-
pothesis that ascorbic acid may lower
blood lead levels.
Several animal studies have exam-
ined the effect of ascorbic acid on lead
toxicity. In rats fed a lead-containing
diet, combined dietary supplementa-
tion with iron and ascorbic acid low-
ered detectable lead levels in liver, kid-
ney, and bone and prevented growth
depression and anemia.21 These benefi-
cial effects, however, were transient.22
Comparing the chelating effects of oral
ascorbic acid and parenterally adminis-
teredEDTAinlead-poisonedrats,Goyer
and Cherian4 reported that ascorbic acid
and EDTA had equivalent chelating
properties. Studies in humans have
yielded inconclusive results. Two case
series reported significant clinical im-
provement among 337 workers with oc-
cupational lead exposure after daily ad-
ministration of 100 mg of ascorbic
acid.5,6 In an uncontrolled trial, the com-
bined administration of zinc and ascor-
bic acid was reported to reduce blood
lead levels among 1000 psychiatric out-
patients,7 and in a small clinical trial,
daily supplementation of 1000 mg of
ascorbic acid resulted in marked reduc-
tions in blood lead levels (P.001).11 In
another study of 85 subjects who vol-
unteered to consume a lead-containing
drink, ascorbic acid supplementation
produced small reductions in lead re-
tention.8 Two other small clinical tri-
als, however, concluded that ascorbic
acid supplementation did not lower
blood lead levels.9,10 In 1 of these stud-
ies, 52 subjects were assigned to re-
ceive either ascorbic acid supplementa-
tion or placebo.9 Although reported to

have no effect, 8 weeks of ascorbic acid
supplementation resulted in (nonsig-
nificant) improvement. Compared with
subjects in the placebo group, subjects
treated with ascorbic acid were more
likely to have a decrease of at least 0.24
µmol/L (5 µg/dL) in blood lead level
(relative risk, 0.64; 95% confidence in-
terval, 0.36-1.11; P = .10). In the sec-
ond study, 45 men received 3 months
of ascorbic acid treatment, resulting in
11% to 23% (nonsignificant) lower
blood lead levels compared with the pla-
cebo-treated group.10 It is possible that
these 2 studies might have yielded sta-
tistically significant results had larger
numbers of participants been enrolled.
Our study has a number of strengths
and limitations. Because NHANES III
surveyed a large probability sample of
Americans, our findings should be gen-
eralizabletotheUSpopulation.Further-
more, the measurement of serum ascor-
bic acid levels in a large sample of the
populationallowsamorereliableassess-
ment of ascorbic acid status as a corre-
late of blood lead levels than do studies
that use dietary intake estimations only.
Plasma ascorbic acid levels are strongly
correlated with leukocyte ascorbic acid
levels(r=0.92),anindicatoroftissuelev-
els,23,24 and reflect at least the previous
several months of dietary intake, even
during periods of seasonal variation.25
The correlation between dietary esti-
mates and measured blood levels of
ascorbic acid, however, is modest
(r = 0.43).26 Although it is biologically
plausible that ascorbic acid may affect
lead absorption and excretion, it is pos-
sible that blood lead may lower serum
ascorbicacidlevels.Itisalsopossiblethat
higher ascorbic acid levels may repre-
sent healthier lifestyles or greater socio-
economic status. Hence, we cannot be
certain that differences in serum ascor-
bic acid levels preceded elevated blood
leadlevels,andinferencesregardingcau-
sality should be made cautiously.
In conclusion, serum ascorbic acid
level is an important independent cor-
relate of blood lead level among Ameri-
cans. To our knowledge, this report is
the first population-based study to es-
tablish such an association. If a causal
relationship is confirmed, higher in-
takes of ascorbic acid may have public
health implications for the prevention
of lead toxicity.
