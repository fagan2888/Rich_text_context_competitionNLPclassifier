IN 1998, APPROXIMATELY 44 MILLION
Americans younger than 65 years--
nearly one fifth of the nonelderly
population--lacked health insur-
ance, including 33 million adults aged
18 to 64 years.1 Prior studies have docu-
mented that lacking health insurance is
associated with important clinical con-
sequences.2-4 Uninsured adults gener-
ally encounter greater barriers to pre-
ventiveservicesandtreatmentofchronic
illnesses than to acute care.5 They are
more likely than insured adults to re-
port poor health status,6-8 delay seeking
medical care,9 and forgo necessary care
for potentially serious symptoms.10 Un-
insured adults receive fewer screening
services for cancer and cardiovascular
risk factors,11-14 present with later-stage
diagnoses of cancer,15,16 and experience
more avoidable hospitalizations.17 They
also face an increased risk of death,18
particularly when hospitalized19 or
diagnosed as having breast cancer.15
Although these studies provide com-
pelling evidence of the adverse clini-
cal consequences of being uninsured,
most of them examined patterns of care
and outcomes prior to 1990, before the
rapid growth of managed care. Increas-
ing competitive pressures in the US
health care system over the past de-
cade may be eroding access to care for
the uninsured by reducing charity care
provided by physicians20 and under-
mining traditional safety-net provid-
ers such as community health centers
and public hospitals.21-24 Several stud-
ies have looked at the duration of pe-
riods without health insurance25-28 or
the effect of losing health insur-
ance,29-31 but these studies have not dis-
tinguished the clinical impact of short-
term and long-term periods without
insurance. In addition, few studies have
assessed the unmet needs of unin-
sured adults with specific chronic con-
ditions, such as diabetes32,33 or hyper-
tension.34

Context In 1998, 33 million US adults aged 18 to 64 years lacked health insurance.
Determining the unmet health needs of this population may aid efforts to improve
access to care.
Objective To compare nationally representative estimates of the unmet health needs
of uninsured and insured adults, particularly among persons with major health risks.
Design and Setting Random household telephone survey conducted in all 50 states
and the District of Columbia through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.
Participants A total of 105764 adults aged 18 to 64 years in 1997 and 117364 in
1998, classified as long-term (1 year) uninsured (9.7%), short-term (1 year) un-
insured (4.3%), or insured (86.0%).
Main Outcome Measures Adjusted proportions of participants who could not see
a physician when needed due to cost in the past year, had not had a routine checkup
within 2 years, and had not received clinically indicated preventive services, com-
pared by insurance status.
Results Long-term­ and short-term­uninsured adults were more likely than insured
adults to report that they could not see a physician when needed due to cost (26.8%,
21.7%, and 8.2%, respectively), especially among those in poor health (69.1%, 51.9%,
and 21.8%) or fair health (48.8%, 42.4%, and 15.7%) (P.001). Long-term­
uninsured adults in general were much more likely than short-term­uninsured and in-
sured adults not to have had a routine checkup in the last 2 years (42.8%, 22.3%,
and 17.8%, respectively) and among smokers, obese individuals, binge drinkers, and
people with hypertension, elevated cholesterol, diabetes, or human immunodefi-
ciency virus risk factors (P.001). Deficits in cancer screening, cardiovascular risk re-
duction, and diabetes care were most pronounced among long-term­uninsured adults.
Conclusions In our study, long-term­uninsured adults reported much greater un-
met health needs than insured adults. Providing insurance to improve access to care
for long-term­uninsured adults, particularly those with major health risks, could have
substantial clinical benefits.

could help to overcome such views and
bolster federal and state efforts to im-
prove access to care.
Weusednationallyrepresentativesur-
vey data from the Behavioral Risk Fac-

than 100000 adults in 1997 and 1998 to
compare uninsured and insured adults'
access to physicians, especially among
adultsatincreasedriskforadversehealth
outcomes. We also examined rates of
clinically indicated preventive services,
including cancer screening, cardiovas-
cular risk reduction, and diabetes man-
agement. To assess the effect of longer
and shorter periods without health in-
surance, we differentiated adults unin-
sured 1 year or longer from those unin-
sured less than 1 year.
METHODS
Data Source
The BRFSS is a federally funded sur-
vey designed by the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (CDC) in
collaboration with state health depart-
ments to monitor health-related behav-
iors and risk factors in the US popula-
tion.39 Beginning with 15 states in 1984,
the BRFSS has collected data annually
through telephone interviews of adults
aged 18 years or older residing in house-
holds. Since 1994, all 50 states and the
District of Columbia have adminis-
tered the BRFSS survey and submitted
survey data to the CDC.
The BRFSS survey instrument has 2
standardized components. First, a core

set of questions is asked in all states an-
nually (including health status, health
insurance, presence of diabetes, smok-
ing, breast and cervical cancer screen-
ing, and human immunodeficiency vi-
rus [HIV] risks) or biennially (eg,
screening for hypertension, elevated
cholesterol, and colorectal cancer, and
influenza and pneumococcal vaccina-
tions in 1997; weight control in 1998).
Second, individual states may choose
each year to include optional modules
on topics such as diabetes manage-
ment or preventive health counseling.
The survey instruments and proce-
dures are designed to produce repre-
sentative samples and ensure consis-
tency of data across states and years.
Many questions are derived from other
national surveys, including the Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey and the National Health In-
terview Survey. English and Spanish
versions of the 2 standardized compo-
nents were provided by the CDC to
eachstate.Additionalinformationabout
BRFSS survey instruments and proce-
dures is available from the CDC.40
Study Population
The BRFSS used random-digit dialing
within blocks of telephone numbers to
identify a probability sample of all
households with telephones in each
state. In eligible households, 1 adult
aged 18 years or older was randomly
selected and interviewed about his/
her health and medical care. Adults re-
siding in hospitals, nursing homes, mili-
tary bases, college dormitories, or
prisons were not eligible. In 1997, the
number of completed interviews per
state ranged from 1505 to 4923 with a
median estimated response rate of
62.5%. In 1998, completed interviews
ranged from 1452 to 6005, with a me-
dian response rate of 59.2%.40
Our cohort included adults aged 18 to
64 years from all 50 states and the Dis-
trict of Columbia who completed the
1997 or 1998 BRFSS survey, including
105 764 respondents in 1997 and
117364 in 1998. We defined uninsured
adults as those who reported having no
health insurance coverage at the time
they were surveyed. We divided this
group into the long-term uninsured
(those who had been uninsured for 1
year) and the short-term uninsured
(those who had been uninsured for 1
year), consistent with other research us-
ing BRFSS data.28 Respondents who re-
portedhavinghealthinsurancefromany
privateorpublicsource(includingMedi-
care, Medicaid, and military or veter-
ans' coverage) were classified as in-
sured.Weexcludedadultsolderthanage
64 years because almost all are eligible
for Medicare insurance. We also ex-
cluded people who did not report their
age (0.5% in each year) or insurance
coverage (0.3%).
Study Variables
We categorized the sample by numer-
ous demographic variables, including
age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, educa-
tion, employment, and self-reported
health status (TABLE 1). To focus on
adults at increased risk for future health
problems and early mortality,41,42 we
identifiedrespondentswhoreportedcur-
rent smoking, obesity (body mass in-
dex [BMI] 30 kg/m2), hypertension
(diagnosed by a health professional on
at least 2 occasions), diabetes mellitus
(diagnosed by a health professional, not
including gestational diabetes), el-
evatedcholesterol(diagnosedbyahealth
professional), binge drinking (5 alco-
holic drinks on at least 1 occasion in the
past month), or self-perceived risk (me-
dium or high) for HIV infection. Smok-
ing, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and HIV
risk were determined from the 1998
BRFSS survey. Hypertension, elevated
cholesterol, and binge drinking were as-
sessed in 1997 but not 1998. In Califor-
nia, HIV risk was assessed only for
people younger than age 45 years, so we
limitedanalysesofthisvariabletopeople
aged 18 to 44 years.
We studied 2 types of unmet health
needs. The first type, inadequate ac-
cess to physicians' care, was defined as
reporting "a time during the last 12
months when you needed to see a doc-
tor, but could not because of the cost"
and not having "visited a doctor for a
routine checkup" during the prior 2
years. For the latter measure, we fo-
cused on people with clinical risk fac-
tors or chronic conditions who would
most likely benefit from regular check-
ups. The second type of unmet health
need was failing to receive clinically in-
dicated preventive services, defined as
adequate, rather than optimal, care
based on the recommended age range

senting about 70% of the US adult popu-
lation. Questions about smoking cessa-

Data Analysis
Ouranalysishad3mainobjectives.First,
in demographic and clinical strata we
compared the proportions of respon-
dents who were uninsured 1 year or
longer, uninsured less than 1 year, and
insured. Second, we compared the pro-
portionsofthese3groupsthatlackedac-
cesstocarebyaphysician.Third,wecal-
culatedtheproportionofeachinsurance
group that had not received clinically in-
dicated preventive services.
To assess the independent effect of
lacking health insurance on access to
physicians and preventive services, we
used multiple logistic regression to con-
trol for age, sex, race/ethnicity, census
region, employment, education, and in-
come. For all of these variables except
income, data were missing for less than
0.5% of respondents, so we excluded
these individuals from adjusted analy-
ses. However, income data were miss-
ing for 11.7% of the weighted sample in
1997 and 12.8% in 1998. To avoid po-
tential biases due to mishandling of in-
completeincomedata(eg,deletingcases
or using indicator variables for missing
data) and to make full use of the ob-
served data,57-59 we used NORM statis-
tical software to obtain multiple im-
puted income values for respondents
with missing data.60
These imputed data sets were ana-
lyzed using conventional complete data
techniques. We obtained adjusted rates
of access measures for each category of
insurance status (long-term uninsured,
short-term uninsured, and insured) by
direct standardization to the demo-
graphic characteristics of the full study
cohort using the logistic regression
model.61,62 TheBRFSSsamplingandpost-
stratification weights were used in fit-
ting the models and calculating ad-
justed proportions. To derive accurate
SEs and tests of statistical significance
from these weighted data, we used
SUDAAN statistical software63,64 and re-
port 2-tailed tests of significance using
standard procedures to calculate valid
tests with multiply imputed data.65
RESULTS
Characteristics Related
to Insurance Status
The study population was representa-
tive of more than 163 million US adults
aged 18 to 64 years residing in house-
holds during 1998 and approximately
161 million comparable adults in 1997.
In 1998, 9.7% of this population had
been uninsured for at least 1 year, in-
cluding 1.8% for 1 to 2 years, 2.1% for
2 to 5 years, 3.4% for more than 5 years,
2.1% who were never insured, and 0.3%
who could not recall when they were
last insured. An additional 4.3% of the
population was uninsured for less than
1 year, including 2.5% for less than 6
months and 1.8% for 6 to 12 months.
In 1997, 9.8% of the cohort had been
uninsured for at least 1 year and 4.2%
for less than 1 year.
The unadjusted proportion of adults
in 1998 who were uninsured for 1 year
or longer, uninsured less than a year, or
insured are portrayed in Table 1, strati-
fied by demographic and clinical char-
acteristics. Compared with other adults
in the cohort, the proportions of unin-
sured individuals were higher among
younger adults, men, blacks, Hispan-
ics, residents of the South and West,
those with less education and lower in-
comes, and those who were self-
employed, unemployed, or not in the la-
bor force. Adults whose self-reported
healthstatuswasgood,fair,orpoorwere
2 to 3 times more likely to have been un-
insured for 1 year or longer than those
who reported excellent or very good
health. Smokers, obese individuals, and
binge drinkers were more often unin-
sured than adults without these risk fac-
tors. In contrast, people with self-
reportedhypertension,diabetesmellitus,
and elevated cholesterol were less likely
to be uninsured than adults without
these conditions.
Access to Physicians
TABLE 2 presents the unadjusted pro-
portion of adults in each insurance cat-
egory who could not see a physician
when needed in the past year due to
cost, stratified by demographic fac-
tors. Nearly two fifths of long-term­
uninsured adults and one third of the
short-term­uninsured adults re-
ported this problem, compared with
only about 1 in 14 insured adults.
Among long-term­uninsured adults,
cost barriers to seeing a physician were
greatest for women, blacks, the unem-
ployed, and those with low incomes.

shown in TABLE 3. In each of these risk
groups, long-term­ and short-term­
uninsuredadultsweresignificantlymore

rienced cost barriers to needed care in
the past year, reflecting the impact of
even short-term periods without health
insurance. As depicted in the FIGURE,
69.1% of long-term­uninsured adults in
poor health and 48.8% of those in fair

of short-term­uninsured adults and
21.8% and 15.7% of insured adults, re-
spectively.
TABLE 4 presents the adjusted pro-
portionsofuninsuredandinsuredadults
who did not have a routine checkup by
a physician during the prior 2 years. In
all clinical risk groups, long-term­
uninsuredadultsweresignificantlymore
likely than insured adults to have lacked
a routine checkup. For short-term­
uninsured adults, the differences rela-
tive to insured adults were smaller and
significant only among smokers, obese
individuals, and binge drinkers, but not
among those with hypertension, diabe-
tes, elevated cholesterol, or HIV risk.
Access to Clinically Indicated
Preventive Services
TABLE 5 shows the adjusted propor-
tions of adults who did not receive ap-
propriate preventive services. Long-
term­uninsuredadultsweresignificantly
more likely than insured adults to have
unmet needs for each of these services,
exceptforglycosylatedhemoglobinmea-
surements and pneumococcal vaccina-
tions among adults with diabetes and
HIV screening among those with self-
perceived risk. For clinical services such
as breast cancer or hypertension screen-
ing, long-term­uninsured adults were 3
to 4 times more likely not to have re-
ceived these services. Short-term­
uninsured adults had intermediate rates
of unmet needs for preventive services
that were statistically higher than the
rates of insured adults for mammogra-
phy, Papanicolaou tests, and hyperten-
sion and cholesterol screening.
COMMENT
Our study provides recent, nationally
representativeestimatesofunmethealth
needs experienced by uninsured
adults--two thirds of whom had been
uninsured for 1 year or longer. Nearly
half of uninsured adults with annual in-
comes below $15000 reported they
could not see a physician when needed
in the past year due to the cost of care.
Uninsured adults with clinically im-
portant chronic conditions and health
risks were much more likely than in-
sured adults to report this problem,
even after adjusting for income and
other potential confounders. Alarm-

ingly high proportions of long-term­
uninsured adults in poor or fair health
reported forgoing needed care, includ-
ing about two thirds of those in poor
health and half of those in fair health.
Another national survey has provided
examples of the troubling personal nar-
ratives embodied in these statistics.66
These findings challenge the views of
a growing proportion of Americans--
from 43% in 1993 to 57% in 1999--
who believe that uninsured people are
able to get the care they need from phy-
sicians and hospitals.37,38
Distinctive features of our study in-
cludedafocusontheunmethealthneeds
of long-term­uninsured adults, particu-
larly those with impaired health or ma-
jor chronic conditions such as diabetes
mellitus,hypertension,andelevatedcho-
lesterol. Long-term­uninsured adults
with these conditions and other clinical
risk factors were much less likely than
insured adults to have received routine
checkupsduringwhichtheirhealthrisks
might have been addressed. In addi-
tion, long-term­uninsured adults were
lesslikelytoreportthattheyreceivedba-
sic preventive services related to cancer
screening and cardiovascularrisk reduc-
tion, but not HIV screening. The mag-
nitude of these differences was greatest
for services such as mammography and
cholesterol screening that are often or-
dered by primary care physicians dur-
ingroutinecheckups.Forroutinecheck-
ups and most preventive services,
individualswhohadbeenuninsuredless
than 1 year did not differ substantially
from people who were insured, possi-
bly because the short-term uninsured
continuedtohaveregularsourcesofcare
or had received checkups while they
were insured. In contrast, the short-
term uninsured were similar to the long-
term uninsured in the likelihood they
had not seen a physician when needed
in the past year due to cost, suggesting
that even short-term periods without in-
surance may cause sizeable numbers of
people to forgo needed care.
Our study provides population-
based rates of specific clinical services
reported by uninsured and insured
adults with diabetes mellitus, build-
ing on 2 other national studies that ex-
amined some of the same clinical ser-
vices but did not distinguish the short-
term and long-term uninsured.32,33
Although uninsured adults with dia-
betes did not differ significantly from
insured adults with diabetes in re-
ported rates of glycosylated hemoglo-
bin measurements or pneumococcal
vaccinations, long-term­uninsured
adults with diabetes were less likely
than insured adults with diabetes to
have received other basic services, such
as eye and foot examinations, choles-
terol screening, and influenza vaccina-
tions. These results are particularly con-
cerning because adults with diabetes
mellitus face an increased risk of nu-
merous complications, including seri-
ous infections, cardiovascular disease,
renal failure, and retinopathy, that can
be prevented or deferred with effec-
tive medical care.54 Therefore, improv-
ing access to care for uninsured adults
with diabetes may help prevent avoid-
able complications of this serious
chronic disease.
Our results are generally consistent
with earlier reports that assessed the im-
pact of insurance status on a narrower
range of preventive services. Rates of
breast and cervical cancer screening
have increased substantially among un-
insured women over the past 2 de-
cades,11,12 perhaps in part because the
National Breast and Cervical Cancer
Early Detection Program has funded
and promoted free screening services
for uninsured, low-income women in
all 50 states since 1991.67 However, the
absolute differences in screening rates
between uninsured and insured women

have remained remarkably consistent
when our findings are compared with
earlier studies.11,12 Furthermore, an-
other report based on BRFSS data found
that age-adjusted mammography rates
increased by about 6% for both in-
sured and uninsured women between
1991-1992 and 1996-1997, but the ab-
solute difference between these groups
remained approximately 25%.68 Lower
rates of cancer screening among unin-
sured adults may be the principal rea-
son why they are diagnosed at later, less
curable stages of breast and colorectal
cancer than insured adults.15,16
Althoughpatchworkprogramscanfill
gaps in specific services such as cancer
screening for uninsured adults, na-
tional health goals represented in the
Healthy People 2010 objectives are un-
likely to be met without more vigorous
efforts to extend affordable health in-
surance to the uninsured for a wide
range of basic medical services.69 Four-
teen states have taken steps to expand
health insurance coverage for low-
income adults.70 Evidence from 3 states
(Minnesota, Oregon, and Tennessee)
suggests these programs have helped re-
duce both the prevalence and duration
of periods without insurance for low-
income adults.71 Comparable efforts to
improve access by other states and the
federal government could target long-
term­uninsured adults with low in-
comes or chronic health conditions and
the approximately 2 million uninsured
adults aged 55 to 64 years who are ap-
proachingeligibilityforMedicare,asoth-
ers have suggested.37,72-75 Our findings
suggest that the health benefits of ex-
tending insurance to these groups could
besubstantial,butthecostsbornebyun-
insured people must be low enough to
encourage broad participation, espe-
cially for those who are poor or near
poor.76
Our study had some limitations. Al-
though we focused on clinically impor-
tant access measures that would be ex-
pected to yield better health outcomes
and are supported by national guide-
lines, we did not analyze clinical out-
comes or the effectiveness of specific
treatments. Our study was a cross-

sectional analysis, so we could not di-
rectly examine the effects on the unin-
sured of the growth of managed care or
other temporal changes in the health
care system. In addition, the cross-
sectional nature of BRFSS data did not
allow us to link the timing of preven-
tive services to specific periods in which
individuals were uninsured. Our mea-
sures were based on self-reported data
that were not independently verified.
Thereliabilityofsuchself-reportsisvery
good or excellent for most variables in-
cluded in our study.77-80 Studies of the
validityofself-reporteddataindicatethat
telephone surveys closely approximate
the prevalence of diabetes and smok-
ing obtained from clinical testing, but
may underestimate rates of obesity, hy-
pertension, and elevated cholesterol,81
and overestimate rates of mammogra-
phy.82
We have no reason to expect sub-
stantial differences in the accuracy of
health data reported by uninsured and
insured adults, particularly after we
controlled for numerous demo-
graphic confounders and used rigor-
ous multiple-imputation methods to
minimize potential bias related to miss-
ing income data. However, our study
may underestimate the unmet health
needs of uninsured adults if they are less
likely to be aware of important health
conditions due to inadequate screen-
ing. Even when uninsured adults with
low incomes obtain care, they report
that the quality and continuity of care
is substantially worse than reported by
insured low-income adults.31,74 The
study cohort also did not include adults
living in households without tele-
phones, who represent about 5% of the
US population and are more likely to
be poor, black, Hispanic, and resi-
dents of the South.39 Because these
groups are more often uninsured than
other groups of adults, our estimates of
uninsured adults with deficits in basic
care probably would increase if people
without telephones had been in-
cluded.
The federal and state governments
have begun to extend affordable health
insurance to uninsured children in the
United States by expanding Medicaid
and launching the Children's Health In-
surance Program.3,83 In contrast, the un-
met health needs of 33 million unin-
sured adults continue to fester in the
health care system without a cohesive
political response by the federal gov-
ernment or most states. Concerted and
collaborative action by policymakers
and health care professionals will be re-
quired to address these persistent needs.
