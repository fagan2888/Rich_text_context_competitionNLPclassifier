Abstract
Background
The low transcriptionally efficient short-allele of the 5HTTLPR serotonin transporter poly-
morphism has been implicated to moderate the relationship between the experience of
stressful life events (SLEs) and depression. Despite numerous attempts at replicating this
observation, results remain inconclusive.
Methods
We examined this relationship in young-adult Non-Hispanic white males and females between
the ages of 22 and 26 (n = 4724) participating in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
to Adult Health (Add Health) with follow-up information every six years since 1995.
Results
Linear and logistic regression models, corrected for multiple testing, indicated that carriers
of one or more of the S-alleles were more sensitive to stress than those with two L-alleles
and at a higher risk for depression. This relationship behaved in a dose-response manner
such that the risk for depression was greatest among those who reported experiencing
higher numbers of SLEs. In post-hoc analyses we were not able to replicate an interaction

5HTTLPR on suicide ideation differed for males and females. There were no effects of child-
hood maltreatment.
Discussion
Our results provide partial support for the original hypothesis that 5-HTTLPR genotype inter-
acts with the experience of stressful life events in the etiology of depression during young
adulthood. However, even with this large sample, and a carefully constructed a priori analy-
sis plan, the results were still not definitive. For the purposes of replication, characterizing
the 5HTTLPR in other large data sets with extensive environmental and depression mea-
sures is needed.
Introduction
By the year 2030, depressive disorders are projected to rank first among disorders contributing
to the global disease burden [1]. Major depression is a complex and heterogeneous disorder
with a highly variable course. Lifetime prevalence rates vary significantly by age and sex, with
young adults and females having higher rates of depression than males and older adults [2­4].
Stressful life events (SLE) are one of the most consistently documented exposures among
those with depression [5­8]. Stressful events can include, but are not limited to, unemploy-
ment, acute or significant health problems, unexpected or persistent financial hardship, and
relationship problems. While these are common experiences, not everyone who experiences
them becomes depressed. Although the nature, kind, and timing of stressful life events have
been implicated as sources of variability in the relationship between depression and SLEs, so
too have biological factors such as serotonergic functioning [9, 10].
The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) is synthesized in the brain by a small number of
neuronal fibers with profuse projections throughout the brain, spinal cord and nervous system
[10]. Because of this wide distribution, it has been implicated in a variety of mental and physi-
cal disorders [11­13]. Through removal of the 5-HT molecule at the synapse, the serotonin
transporter (5-HTT) plays an important role in determining the extent and duration of seroto-
nergic signaling. An insertion/deletion polymorphism (5HTTLPR) in the promoter region of
the 5-HTT gene has been implicated as a source of variation in 5-HTT gene transcription rates
such that the short (S) allele is less transcriptionally efficient than the long (L) allele [14, 15]. In
2003, Caspi et al [16] examined the role that 5HTTLPR polymorphism has in the relationship
between SLEs and depression finding that carriers of one or more S-alleles were more likely to
develop depression in the context of more SLE's than those with two L-alleles.
Since that landmark study [16], there have been numerous replication attempts and three
meta-analyses [17­24]. Differences in the conceptualization of stressful life events, depression,
and their quantification have likely contributed to a literature that has not provided any defini-
tive evidence for or against the original hypothesis. Small sample sizes, low statistical power,
and an inconsistent preferred mode of examining the hypothesized interaction have also con-
tributed to mixed findings [25], leaving some to contend that there have been few direct repli-
cation attempts of the original hypothesis [20, 21]. Here, we report findings from a study of the
5HTTLPR, stressful life events, and depression using an approach as close to an a priori direct
replication as we could achieve in a large prospective nationally representative sample. Our
first test examined the hypothesis that carriers of one or more S-alleles would be more sensitive

to stress than individuals carrying no S-alleles. In a post-hoc manner and similar to Caspi et al
[16], we examined the role of the 5HTTLPR in moderating the impact of stressful life events on
suicide ideation and moderating the impact of childhood maltreatment on self-reported diag-
nosed depression. Based on prior published findings since Caspi et al [16] showing that the
stress-moderating effects of the 5HTTLPR may differ between males and females [21, 26­31],
we also examined sex as a moderator of stressful life events x 5HTTLPR effects on depression
and suicidal ideation in post-hoc analyses.
Methods
Subjects
Add Health is a nationally representative, probability-based survey of adolescents in the United
States, who were aged 12­19 years in the 1994­1995 school year, when the study began. A
detailed description of the study design and the sampling strategy utilized in Add Health is
available elsewhere [32,33]. At Wave III, 52.8% of the sample was male and the mean age was
22.0 (± 1.77, range 18­26) years old. The majority (67.1%) self-reported White race, 23%
reported Black, and 9.9% either Asian or Native American. The participation rate was 77%
[32]. Our analysis sample for the current study included only White males and females between
22 and 26 years of age participating in Wave III (2001­2002) and for whom we had genotype
data to replicate Caspi et al [16] and avoid population stratification (n = 4724). Written
informed consent was obtained at Wave III and protocols approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The Institutional Review Board at
the University of Colorado Boulder approved the current study.
Assessment
Stressful life events. Life events captured five domains of experiences: health, housing,
employment, finance and relationships. Health-related events included hospitalization, violent
injuries, frequency of emergency room visits, and being diagnosed with cancer. Housing-
related events included residency changes (local, national), homelessness, shelter use, and
whether the respondent had been evicted. Employment-related events included being unem-
ployed, seeking job assistance, or receiving supplemental income. Finance-related events
included being unable to pay for utilities, rent or mortgage; needing medical or dental help but
being unable to pay for it, or having utility service cutoff. Relationship-related events included
having experienced a violent relationship, divorce, or the breakup of a cohabitation living
arrangement. A total of 21 items was used to create our stressful life events scale (SLE). For
these five domains, 22.2% of the analysis sample reported having health related problems and
39.3% reported having employment related problems. A total of 34.4% reported having finan-
cial difficulties, 35.3% reported having housing problems, and 35.4% reported having problems
in a significant relationship. S1 Table provides a comparison of the measured stressful life
events in the current study and those by Caspi et al [16].
Following the original report by Caspi et al [16], if any item was endorsed within a domain,
the respondent was given a score of 1 for that domain. Scores were then summed across all
domains to produce a total number of stressful life events. Scores on this summed scale could
range from 0 to 4.
Depression, suicide ideation, and childhood maltreatment. For our primary analysis,
depression was assessed using responses from two questions. First, respondents were asked if
they "have been diagnosed with depression." Second, whether they "have taken prescription
medication for depression or stress." Responses were coded as yes or no (1/0) and yielded a cate-
gorical measure of depression. We felt this measure came closer to the clinical indicator of

depression Caspi and colleagues [16] used. However, we also created a depressive symptom
scale for post-hoc analysis using past-seven day depression symptoms, as assessed on the nine-
item revised Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) [34]. Symptom
endorsements were summed into a quantitative scale and ranged between 0 and 27.
Suicide ideation was assessed using two questions. First, "during the past 12 months, had
you ever seriously thought about committing suicide" and "during the past 12 months, how
many times have you actually attempted suicide." Among respondents, 259 [5.5%] reported
they had thought about committing suicide during the past year and 20.8% (n = 66) of those
reported having attempted suicide. Rates of suicide ideation did not differ between males and
females (2 (1) = 0.14, p = 0.71).
Maltreatment prior to the age of 12 was assessed using six questions. During the Wave III
interview, participants were asked "how often had your parents or other adult-caregivers left
you home alone", "how often had your parents or other adult care-givers not taken care of your
basic needs", "how often had your parent or other adult care-givers slapped, hit, or kicked you",
"how often had one of your parents or other adult care-givers touched you in a sexual way, forced
you to touch him or her in a sexual way", "how often had Social Services investigated how you
were taken care of or tried to take you out of your living situation". Affirmative responses were
coded as `1' and `0' otherwise. Responses were summed across all items and resulted in a scale
that ranged from 0 to 6. Similar to Caspi et al (16) scores of 2 or more were collapsed and indi-
cated `severe maltreatment.'
Genotyping. The 43 base-pair insertion/deletion polymorphism (5HTTLPR) in the 5' reg-
ulatory region of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4; 5HTT) and the A/G single nucleo-
tide polymorphism (SNP) rs25331 in the long repeat unit of the 5HTTLPR was characterized
from genomic DNA collected and isolated using the Oragene system (DNAgenotek, Kanata,
Ontario, Canada) at Wave IV (2008­2009) in Add Health [35, 36]. Assay, allele and genotype
information is provided in S1 Text.
Statistical analysis. Logistic regression models predicting depression and suicidality were
as follows: depression = b0 + b1(sex) + b2(5HTTLPR) + b3(SLE) + b4(5HTTLPRxSLE), where b0
is the intercept, b1 is the regression coefficient associated with the effect of sex (coded as
0 = male, 1 = female), b2 is the regression coefficient associated with the influence of serotonin
transporter genotype status (coded as 0 = s/s, 1 = s/l, 2 = l/l in order to reflect the number of
"long" alleles), b3 is the regression coefficient associated with the influence of stressful life events
(SLE; coded as 0 = no SLEs, 1 = 1 SLE, 2 = 2 SLEs, 3 = 3 SLEs, 4 = 4+ SLEs), b4 is the coefficient
associated with the interaction effect and is the product of 5HTTLPR genotype status and SLE.
A p-value of 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance for b4 in our primary analysis.
Analyses were run for two genotype classifications: 5HTTLPR and 5HTTLPR + rs25531.
Because the study results did not differ between the two genotype classifications, we present
findings from the analyses using the 5HTTLPR + rs25531 SNP classification (designated as:
5HTTLPR'). All analyses were conducted using the survey command in STATA (Version 12)
and took into account the sampling design of Add Health. The independent (stressful life
events, childhood maltreatment, 5HTTLPR genotype) and dependent (depression, suicide ide-
ation) variables were developed independently, and the analyses were planned and reviewed by
a panel of six investigators prior to testing in order to eliminate the possibility of `fishing expe-
ditions' in the data. For quantitative outcomes (CES-D depression symptomology scale), we
used linear regression. Because our study was designed to test the gene-environment interac-
tion hypothesis by Caspi et al [16], we corrected the statistical significance of all interaction
analyses following our primary test using the conservative Bonferroni method. This resulted in
a significance value for post-hoc tests of p = 0.005.

Results
We examined the gene-environment hypothesis in a sample of white young adult males and
females, ages 22­26, who participated in Wave III (2001­2002) of Add Health (n = 4724). In
our analysis sample, 23.6% (n = 1117) had two copies of the short allele (s/s genotype), 48.8%
(n = 2303) had one copy of the short allele (s/l genotype), and 27.6% (n = 1304) had no copies
of the short allele (l/l genotype). The three-genotype groups were in Hardy-Weinberg equilib-
rium (2 = 2.597, df = 1, p = 0.11) and there were no significant differences in genotype fre-
quencies between males and females (2 = 0.32, p = 0.85).
Stressful life events were assessed using 21 separate events including health, housing,
employment, financial, and relationship experiences. Seventy-nine percent of our sample
reported experiencing at least 1 stressful life event and of those, 23.3% reported 2 events, 12.7%
reported 3 events, and 7.2% experienced 4 or more. There were no significant differences in
SLE scores (F(2,4723) = 0.41, p = 0.66) as a function of genotype status and indicated that the
5HTTLPR polymorphism was not associated with exposure to stressful life events.
Thirteen percent (n = 626) of our analysis sample self-reported being diagnosed with depres-
sion between 22 and 26 years of age. Females were more likely than males to report having a
diagnosis of depression (odd ratio = 2.17; 95% confidence interval, (CI): 1.85 to 2.55) and report
having taken medication for depression (odds ratio = 3.4, 95% CI: 2.36 to 3.91). Males and
females were equally likely to report having spent time in a hospital for mental illness in the pre-
vious five years (odds ratio = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.74 to 1.63) and to have attempted or seriously
thought about committing suicide in the past year (odds ratio = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.48 to 1.02).
We began our logistic regression analyses by examining whether the risk for depression
increased as a function of 5HTTLPR genotype and the number of stressful life events experi-
enced. Sample sizes for our primary and post-hoc analyses are provided in S2 Table. For both
males and females, as the number of life events increased the risk for depression also increased.
Prevalence estimates for depression were similar across 5HTTLPR genotype status, though
depression risk appeared to increase more steeply for males who have one or more of the short
alleles (Fig 1a and 1b, S3 Table). We interpreted this pattern of results as providing preliminary
support for the originally hypothesized gene-environment interaction [16]. Formal tests of this
possibility, accounting for the sampling design of Add Health, revealed a main effect for SLEs
[b = 0.67, t = 8.75, p < 0.01 95% CI: 0.52 to 0.83], a main effect of the 5HTTLPR genotype
[b = 0.40, t = -2.66, p < 0.01, 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.69], and for a statistically significant interaction
[b = -0.16, t = 0.07, p = 0.02, 95% CI: -0.29 to -0.02] (Table 1). Post-hoc analyses of this replica-
tion finding revealed that while stressful life events were a risk factor for depression for both
sexes, the role of the 5HTTLPR and its interaction with stressful life events approached signifi-
cance (p = 0.007, 95% CI: -0.54 to -0.09) only for males [Fig 1a and 1b, Table 1]. A formal test
of whether the interaction terms differed between the sexes revealed a non-significant sex-
5HTTLPR-stressful life events interaction [b = 0.25, t = -1.82, p = 0.07, 95% CI: -0.02 to 0.53].
Post-hoc analyses
Following on the primary hypothesis that the 5HTTLPR moderated the relationship between
stressful life events and depression, Caspi et al [16] investigated similar interaction hypotheses
for depression related dependent and independent variables (suicide ideation and childhood
maltreatment, respectively). In our sample of males and females, prevalence rates of suicidal
ideation were highest among those who had experienced greater numbers of stressful life events
(S4 Table) regardless of sex. Across 5HTTLPR genotype, however, the effect of stressful life
events differed as a function of sex. For females carrying one or more of the S-alleles, preva-
lence of suicide ideation increased with an increasing number of stressful life events whereas

for males, the prevalence rates increased for carriers of one or more L-alleles (S4 Table). For
both sexes, neither 5HTTLPR genotype, nor its interaction with stressful life events was signifi-
cantly associated with suicidal ideation (Table 1, Fig 1c and 1d), although this relationship
approached significance for females (S5 Table). A formal test of whether the interaction terms
differed between the sexes revealed a non-significant sex-5HTTLPR-stressful life events inter-
action [b = -0.33, t = 2.33, p = 0.02, 95% CI: -0.63 to -0.05] after multiple test correction. Simi-
larly, a test of the differential effect of the 5HTTLPR as a function of sex that also controlled for
depression status [b = -0.39, t = 2.78, p = 0.007, 95% CI: -0.67 to -0.11] was not significant after
correcting for multiple testing. For childhood maltreatment, neither the 5HTTLPR genotype
nor its interaction with maltreatment significantly predicted depression in this young adult
sample (Table 1, Fig 1e and 1f, S6 Table).
Finally, we examined a quantitative depression score based on CES-D symptom counts (z-
scored). Although stressful life events predicted CES-D depression symptoms [b = 0.18,
SE = 0.05, t = 3.53, p = 0.001, 95% CI: 008 to 0.28], neither 5HTTLPR genotype [b = -0.01,
SE = 0.06, t = 0.22, p = 0.82, 95% CI: -0.12 to 0.10] nor its interaction with SLEs [b = 0.03,
SE = 0.05, t = 0.08, p = 0.94, 95% CI: -0.84 to 0.09] was significant.
Discussion
In the current report we examined the hypothesis that 5HTTLPR genotype moderated the rela-
tionship between experiences of stressful life events and depression during young adulthood.
We sought to test this hypothesis by adopting a direct replication strategy that included an

analytic approach and a stressful life events measure similar to those employed previously [16].
Importantly, as a group we specified the exact tests that would be conducted prior to undertak-
ing our analyses to limit the number of tests conducted and preserve the integrity of interpreta-
tion for those that were conducted. Results supported the hypothesis that the 5HTTLPR plays
a role in moderating the impact of SLEs on depression status, though at a statistically signifi-
cant level only in males and using a self-reported `ever' diagnosis of depression. We did not
find support for a similar role of the 5HTTLPR in the relationship between stressful life events
and suicide ideation; however, post-hoc analyses were suggestive of a stress-moderating effect
of the 5HTTLPR on suicide ideation that differed between males and females. Further, while
having experienced maltreatment as a child was a significant risk for depression, we did not
detect a significant maltreatment-5HTTLPR interaction in these data as had been reported pre-
viously [16]. Post-hoc considerations revealed, that in the context of increasing numbers of
stressful life events, common variation in 5HTTLPR genotype could contribute to differences
in mental health problems between the sexes.
In the absence of stressful life events, we found rates of depression that were similar across
genotype status. This indicated that at low levels of stress, 5HTTLPR genotype was not related
to the risk for depression. As the number of stressful life events increased, the prevalence of
depression also increased among those carrying one or more copies of the short allele. This
relationship between stressful life events and depression was most evident at the extremes of
the distribution where sample sizes were smaller, though still larger than the original study
[16]. Moreover, the higher prevalence of depression among those with many stressful life
events was significant only for males. Finally, as new genetic variation in the 5HTTLPR had
been identified since the original study [16] we included SNP rs25531 in our analyses. Doing
so negligibly changed the observed relationships as compared with results including just the
5HTTLPR. This is consistent for a SNP with a low minor allele frequency (MAF) among Cau-
casians [> 5%; 35] such that the number of participants reclassified on the basis of functional
binning of the 5HTTLPR was limited. This, however, would not be the expectation in geneti-
cally diverse samples with greater MAFs.
Gene-environment interaction studies offer an opportunity to understand biological mecha-
nisms important for predicting risk and evaluating changes in modifiable environments [37­
39]. Further, these kinds of studies can help to identify environmental effects that act primarily
in genetically susceptible individuals. There have been many attempts at replicating the obser-
vation that the 5HTTLPR S-allele moderates the relationship between depression and stressful
life events [16­20, 25], often with conflicting results. Similarly, findings from meta-analyses
[20­22] have also been inconclusive, with some reporting no effect and others full support for
the original hypothesis. Against this literature, our results agree with the notion that the inter-
action effect of 5HTTLPR genotype and stressful life events on depression is marginal and that
the effect size is smaller than that originally reported. Further, similar to one prior study [19],
our results suggest that it is important to capture the specific forms of life stress originally set
forth in Caspi and colleagues [16] original report [40, 41].
Suicide ideation is often reported among patients with depression and those experiencing
acute stress [42]. Because of the magnitude of impact suicide has on society there is a great
interest in understanding its biological and social causes. To this end, our results suggest the
possibility that in the presence of an increasing number of stressful life events different
5HTTLPR alleles may confer a susceptibility to suicide ideation that differs between males and
females. If true, this finding would extend Caspi et al [16] and support previous studies show-
ing sex moderation of the 5HTTLPR effects on depression [28, 30, 31] and negative affect [43],
and may offer one explanation for the heterogeneity in association tests of the 5HTTLPR and
suicide behaviors that implicate both the L-allele and S-allele [44, 45]. If replicated, these results

would aid efforts to better identify those at risk for suicide and implicate environments and
social experiences that may be modified to reduce such risk.
Similar to other replication attempts, our study is not without limitations. First, we were
unable to establish a temporal relationship between the experience of a stressful life event and
the onset or occurrence of depression. As such, some of the measured stressful life events may
have occurred after the onset of depression, which may have the effect of biasing our interac-
tion parameter [46]. Similarly, stressful life events examined here were retrospectively reported
as having occurred sometime within the preceding five-years while depression diagnosis could
have occurred at any point before the Wave III interview. Stressors most salient to depression
are those which are acute, major, occurred within the previous six-months, and are participant
focused [40, 41]. Although our stressful life events measure was very similar to that specified by
Caspi and colleagues (16), we were not able to include each of its aspects. Second, our coding of
SLEs, though exactly the same as Caspi et al [16], limits the potential importance of experienc-
ing multiple types of SLE's within one domain or multiple occurrences of the same event within
a domain. This has, for example, the consequence of scoring someone who has experienced
multiple forms of violence over years in an intimate relationship but no other SLE the same as
a person who moved states for a job and no other SLE's. Said differently, scoring SLE domains
as we have limits the impact of the severity of an experience. A coding scheme that accounts
for this by possibly weighting subsequent experiences may provide a better allocation of sub-
jects to SLE groups and reduce sample heterogeneity among those experiencing fewer SLE's.
Third, though we were able to detect a significant interaction between the 5HTTLPR and
stressful life events in a much larger sample than examined by Caspi and colleagues [16], the
effect size was less robust. One potential reason for this could be differences between interview
and self-reported adversity. Previous meta-analyses [45] and systematic reviews [39] have sug-
gested that the use of interviews and/or multiple informants may afford better sensitivity for
the detection of gene-environment (GxE) interactions. Fourth, reports of childhood maltreat-
ment were retrospective and therefore may have been influenced by distorted memories or
recall bias [47­50]. Lastly, for replication purposes [16] we restricted our sample to include
only Caucasians and as such are unable to establish the extent to which findings would be simi-
lar in other race/ethnic populations. Given race differences in the prevalence of depression [4,
50] and allele frequencies of the functional SNP rs25531 [51, 52], examining this hypothesis in
diverse ethnic samples should be a priority for future research.
In conclusion, by committee, we set out to examine the hypothesis that SLEs moderated the
impact of the 5HTTLPR S-allele on depression among young adults. To do so, we attempted to
approximate as closely as possible the measures originally examined by Caspi et al [16] in a
large well-characterized sample followed longitudinally since adolescence. Towards this end, a
notable advantage of the Add Health sample is the extensive environmental measures com-
bined with the unique availability of simple sequence data [34]; in particular rs25531 and the
5HTTLPR. Although these types of samples provide strong statistical power for hypothesis
testing, they may not always assess each phenotype of interest in as an extensive of a manner as
smaller samples designed to test circumscribed hypotheses. As noted above, we could not
approximate every phenotype as originally [16] put forward. Despite this, our results utilizing a
highly similar measure of SLEs, a clinically orientated depression measure, a more transcrip-
tionally accurate genotype classification, and the same analytic approach, we obtained evi-
dence, albeit not unequivocal, that supported the original finding reported by Caspi et al [16].
Specially, young adults with lower 5HTT transcription and greater numbers of SLEs reported
higher rates of depression as compared with those carrying the L-allele and experiencing fewer
SLEs. Although larger sample sizes are desirable to further explore the questions asked here, it
is important to do so in samples with extensive environmental characterization using

alternative methodologies and strategies that elucidate the connections between sequence vari-
ation, gene regulation, and depression related neural pathophysiology. In this way we can real-
ize the identification of environmental effects that act in susceptible individuals.
