Introduction: Individualism and
Collectivism
The West is the hemisphere that produced Lockean liberal-
ism, which exalts individual freedom and autonomy, fiercely
protecting these valued rights from majority will and govern-
mental interference (J. Locke, 1690/1988). The West cele-
brates the image of the self-made man, deifying Lincoln for
transforming himself from backwoods frontier rail splitter to
the President of the United States of America (Howe, 2009).
Horace Greeley says "go west" to the young man; Thoreau
retreats to his cabin; Emerson advises, "insist on yourself,
never imitate." Similarly, Orestes Brownson (1865/2005)
finds the American reliant on "individual energies and per-
sonal resources." Most strikingly, Tocqueville bears testa-
ment to the spirit of individualism:
. . . I see an innumerable multitude of men, alike and equal,
constantly circling around in pursuit of the petty and banal
pleasures with which they glut their souls. Each of them
withdrawn into himself, is almost unaware of the fate of the rest.
Mankind, for him, consists in his children and his personal
friends. As for the rest of his fellow citizens, they are near
enough, but he does not notice them. He touches them but feels
nothing. He exists in and for himself, and though he still may
have a family, one can at least say that he has not got a fatherland.
(Lawler & Schaefer, 2005, p. 184)
These individualistic Anglo-American values are repre-
sentative, not only of England and the United States, but of
the West more generally.
Alternatively, collectivism, associated with the East, most
specifically the Asian cultures of China and Japan, "favours
maintenance of social harmony over assertion of individual-
ity" (Chiao & Blizinsky, 2010). Collectivism stresses com-
munion and interconnectedness above competition and
independence, as expressed in sport (Reid, 2010), economics
(Dowdle, Gillespie, & Maher, 2013), management (Brew &
David, 2004; Tinsley & Brett, 2001), job satisfaction (Hui,
Yee, & Eastman, 1995), philosophical writings (Markus &
Kitayama, 1991; Nisbett, Peng, Choi, & Norenzayan, 2001;
Triandis, 1995), political organization (E. A. Locke, 2011),
moral judgment (Fu et al., 2010), historical narratives
(Imada, 2012), phenomenological apperception (Gudykunst,
Matsumoto, Ting-Toomey, & Nishida, 1996; Lee, Beckert, &
Goodrich, 2010), self-expression (Carducci, 2012), conflict
resolution (Ohbuchi, Sato, & Tedeschi, 1999; P. B. Smith,

Toward a Biology of Collectivism:
Reducing the East West Divide to Its
Physical and Physiological Substrates
Steven C. Hertler1
Abstract
The signs of mating competition are written into the physiology of the human male, but they are not written equally into the
physiology of all racial groupings of human males. It seems that Asian males are different, different in that they are more fully
dissimilar from the gorilla than are other races, showing less sexual dimorphism, muscularity, and less marked secondary
sexual characteristics, and different in that they are more fully dissimilar from the chimpanzee than are other races, showing
less sexual drive and activity as well as smaller testicles and lower sperm counts. It is presently argued that such anatomical
differences are a testament to a more peaceably monogamous mating history. In turn, it is then argued that such physiological
markers are directly associated with the collectivist ethos that has been historically, anthropologically, and sociologically
observed among the Asian people.

Dugan, Peterson, & Leung, 1998), vocation (L. Q. Yang
et al., 2012), education (Azuma, 1998), and, of course, social
organization (Ho & Chiu, 1994; Wagner, 1995). In fact, the
dichotomy between individualistic and collectivistic cultures
is so thoroughly discussed as to be assumed a hackneyed
heuristic or an antiquated artifact of social science texts.
Truly, however, it is neither one nor the other. In spite of
general critiques (Takano & Osaka, 1999) and allegations of
binary simplicity (Briley & Wyer, 2001; Mateo, Cabanis,
Stenmanns, & Krach, 2013; Oyserman, Coon, &
Kemmelmeier, 2002), the individualism/collectivism dichot-
omy is a well-supported division between Western and
Eastern styles of thinking, living, socializing, and being,
seriously considered and actively generating research
(Fijneman, Willemsen, & Poortinga, 1996; Rhee, Uleman, &
Lee, 1996; Triandis et al., 1993); it is, in fact, the most gen-
erative research topic in cross-cultural psychology (Conway,
Houck, & Gornick, 2014). Although widely documented,
this dichotomy is not well explained. As Chiao and Blizinsky
(2010, p. 530) stated, "a parsimonious explanation of the ori-
gin of individualistic and collectivistic cultural values has
largely remained elusive."
Culture: Autonomous Force or Biological
Outgrowth?
Collectivist culture, like culture generally, has historically
defied explanation because it is most often treated as a fully
autonomous force with no identifiable antecedent.
Representative of this view is renowned anthropologist and
author of Primitive Society (Lowie, 1920) and Social
Organization (Lowie, 1948), Robert Lowie, who, in a 1917
lecture on Culture and Ethnology, asserted that "culture is a
thing sui generis which can be explained only in terms of
itself" (Kuper, 2009, p. 62; Lowie, 1917). In contrast to this
still prevalent view, now embodied in the Durkheim and Boaz
tradition (Alves, 1999; Gat, 2006), Wilson (1975/2000, 2004)
advanced the idea that culture is on the leash of the gene. In
other words, cultural diversity is chained to evolved biology.
Wilson's quip is generally invoked to illustrate the functional
similarities behind seemingly irreconcilable cultural practices.
In this way, the contemporary American male buying, driving,
and polishing an expensive car is akin to a 19th-century
Argentinian Hussar twisting his mustachios and pruning his
epaulettes, which is, in turn, akin to an 18th-century English
aristocrat donning a powdered wig, stockings, and silver shoe
buckles. In all cases, these trappings and actions function as
display, advertising status to rival males and potential mates.
Even though the surface features of these behaviors vary
greatly, their underlying motivation is the same. From this per-
spective then, biology constrains cultural practices, such that
every culture has religion and religious institutions, law and
systems of justice, and marriage with associated rituals, all of
which vary cross-culturally more in form than function.Yet, if,
as Wilson states, evolved similarities give rise to cultural
similarities, then shouldn't evolved dissimilarities give rise to
cultural dissimilarities? If we encounter biological variation
across races,1 should we not question whether these gave rise
to cultural dissimilarities?
Purpose of the Present Article
We find such racial dissimilarities across anatomical and
behavioral characteristics of the Asian peoples, especially
the Chinese2 and Japanese. As differentiated from Caucasian
and Africans, for example, Asians differ dramatically in sec-
ondary sexual characteristics, such as aggression, and sexual
dimorphism, and they seem also to differ in testes weight,
sexual activity, and sexual drive. It is the purpose of the pres-
ent article to review these intraspecific biological differences
across racial groupings, as they relate to interspecific bio-
logical differences across primates species. After extrapolat-
ing from animal models, the present work thereafter argues
that Asian biology minimizes mating competition, promot-
ing a more peaceable monogamous mating style, which, in
turn, provided a biological substrate out of which collectiv-
ism could grow.
Overt and Covert Signatures of Mating
Competition
All competition is resource competition. There are two
classes of resources: those which perpetuate the life of the
organism and those which perpetuate the lineage of the
organism. Clearly, animals compete for survival alone, as
many clonal species vie vigorously for space and food
(Jackson & Coates, 1986). However, recombinatory repro-
duction augments competition, adding sexual selection to
natural selection and buffeting organisms between the two.
As Butovskaya and Kozintsev (1999) stated, "while females
compete for resources, they themselves are the main resource
and the main object of competition for males" (p. 262).
Through the mechanism of sexual selection, mating competi-
tion leaves a marked signature (Darwin, 1871/1998; Jenions
& Kokko, 2010), generating some of the most conspicuous
phenomena in nature: the exhausting and unending croak of
the frog (Dyson, Reichert, & Halliday, 2013; Ryan, 1985),
the bioluminescent flash of the firefly3 (Lewis & Cratsley,
2008), the antlers of the stag (Kokko & Brooks, 2003), the
recurved horns of the ibex, the elongated canine of the boar
(Jennings & Gammell, 2013), the major cheliped claw of the
fiddler crab (Briffa, 2013), as well as the horns and mandi-
bles of beetles (Snell-Rood & Moczek, 2013).4 Likewise, the
marks of competition between males for females resulted in
the evolution of the dewlap of the lizard indicating bite force
(Earley & Hsu, 2013), the comb of the rooster, honestly sig-
naling physical condition and testosterone levels (Pryke,
2013), the lekking parade and plumage display of the sage-
grouse, advertising high genetic quality and low parasite
load (Harrell, 2008), and the bellowing of the buck during
Hertler 3
the annual rut, simultaneously indicating dominance to rivals
and fitness to females (Jennings & Gammell, 2013). These
are the subjects of nature documentaries, the sources of
inspiration to aspiring biologists, and the spur to research
studies and conservation efforts.
However, there is another world of competition between
the seminal discharges of males in the vaginal tracts of
females: copulatory plugs, tandem sperm, capacitated sperm,
horn-like structures to reposition rival sperm, penile flagella
to displace rival sperm, parasperm used to cheaply fill repro-
ductive tracts, and accessory gland proteins that manipulate
females into laying more eggs and avoid remating (Arnqvist
& Rowe, 2005; Davies, Krebs, & West, 2012). Moreover,
males of some species are equipped with antiaphrodisiac gas
(Price, 1999), enlarged testes, and short and muscular vas
deferens (A. F. Dixson, 2009), among other emblems of fur-
tive competition. So there is overt competition and covert
competition, sometimes, respectively, referred to as somatic
and genital selection (Suonr, 1979). These forms of selec-
tion, of course, act on primate species to varying degrees:
Overt competition, exemplified among apes by the gorilla,
marks a polygamous mating style; whereas covert competi-
tion, exemplified among apes by the chimpanzee, marks a
promiscuous mating style. Armed with this dichotomy and
these primate models, it is instructive to view humans and
human racial variation.
Gorilla gorilla: The Signature of
Polygamy
The gorilla is the primate exemplar of polygamy, carrying
many markers of overt, somatic mating competition. With
groups of around eight (Parnell, 2002) often containing a
single breeding male (Margulis, Whitham, & Ogorzalek,
2003), reproductive success pivots on the ability to obtain
and maintain a harem (Breuer et al., 2010). Massive heads
with prominent fatty ridges and resonating air pockets that
undergird the oft-beat chest may be unique markers of polyg-
amy among gorillas (Breuer, Robbins, & Boesch, 2007);
although, in addition to such stylized symbols, gorillas pos-
sess the sexually dimorphic pelage variation, which signals
intra-male polygamous conflict (Plavcan, 2001). In fact, the
gorilla is the most dichromatic of all the primates, with the
females possessing muted colors and the males possessing a
pronounced sagittal crest of silver gray (Breuer et al., 2007).
Above all else, the gorilla's high male mass is the most con-
spicuous signature of polygamy. Heavily muscled and
aggressively territorial, the gorilla is not only the largest of
extant primates, it is the most sexually dimorphic (Taylor,
1997). By way of distinction, the enlargement of the male
above and beyond the female is not a feature of those pri-
mates considered paradigms of monogamy: Indri, Aotus,
Callicebus, Callithrix, Saguinus, Hylobates (A. F. Dixson,
2012). More systematically, when looking across 21 monog-
amous primate species, males collectively weigh 662.7 kg,
whereas their female counterparts collectively weigh
636.6 kg. Alternatively, 18 primarily polygamous male pri-
mates weighed 521.5 kg, whereas their female counterparts
weighedonly310.9kg.Thedisparityisblatant.Quantification
yields a body weight ratio of 1.04 across monogamous pri-
mates and a body weight ratio of 1.68 across polygamous
primates (A. F. Dixson, 2012; Table 3.2).5 Such cross-species
comparisons show that monogamous primate species contain
males and females that are essentially the same weight,
whereas polygamous primate species contain males that are
often more than 50% heavier than females. From such data
comes the zoological dictum, holding that "the more females
per male in the breeding group, the larger the male is in rela-
tion to the female" (Davies et al., 2012, p. 35). Similarly,
Wilson (2004) stated that, "the average number of females
consorting with successful males closely corresponds to the
size gap between males and females when many species are
considered together" (p. 20).
With these correlates in mind, it is instructive to view human
data. Based on a cross-racial estimate of A. F. Dixson's (2012),
Homo sapiens have a male­female body weight ratio of 1.21.
Judging from this sex-based weight disparity, polygamy
appears to play both a moderate historical and contemporary
role in human mating--an assumption corroborated by anthro-
pological data, such as Ford and Beach's classic 1951 study
suggesting that more than 80% of cultures sanction polygamy
(A. F. Dixson, 2012). So humans, by this standard, and when
taken as an undifferentiated population, seem to be far from the
polygamous gorilla, but still about a third of the way in that
direction. Now to address pertinent racial particularities: It is
clear that, when collapsing across both sexes, Asian popula-
tions are smaller and lighter than, for example, Caucasian and
African populations (Deurenberg-Yap, Schmidt, van Staveren,
& Deurenberg, 2000). Moreover, Asians appear to show a
somewhat less pronounced size dimorphism: For example,
Deurenberg-Yap (2000) reported a mean of 54 kg for females
and a mean of 64.6 kg for males within a Chinese sample, cre-
ating a ratio of 1.19, somewhat below the cross-racial average
of 1.21 reported by A. F. Dixson. This size dimorphism dispar-
ity, however, becomes more pronounced when looking at body
composition specifically, as opposed to body weight generally.
By most measures and in most studies, Asian samples,
when compared with Caucasian samples, have more fat and
less muscle (Deurenberg, Deurenberg-Yap, & Guricci,
2002). Again, compared with Caucasians, Asians have
greater bicep, abdomen, superilliac, and subscapular skin
fold thickness (J. Wang et al., 1994).Alternatively, Caucasian
men show higher ratios of fat-free mass on the arms, thighs,
and trunk, than Asian men. Furthermore, on these same mea-
sures, Asian men are separated from Asian women less
widely than Caucasian men are separated from Caucasian
women (J. Wang et al., 1994). What is perhaps of most acute
interest is that Asian men have body mass indexes (BMIs)
that remain essentially the same across the adult life span.
Gallagher et al. (2000) reported that Asian male BMI was an
4 SAGE Open
average of 21.3, 22, and 22.3 across the age ranges of 20 to
39, 40 to 59, and 60 to 79 (Heymsfield, 2005). This implies
that there is little difference between young men in their peak
reproductive years and aged men in their post-reproductive
years. In contrast, Caucasian BMI follows a different devel-
opmental trend being 18.3, 21, and 23 between the same age
ranges. One interpretation of these data is that Asians show a
high BMI throughout development, but Caucasians, being
more pressured by mating competition, show a lower BMI
that only approaches Asian levels in the post-reproductive
years when mating competition has waned.
While gross measurement of weight is instructive, direct
measurement of muscle mass is more so (A. F. Dixson,
2009). As compared with weight ratios of approximately
1.21, muscle ratios have been estimated at 1.53. This is
because human females are singular among primates in their
high degree of adipose tissue storage; consequently, the
extent of human sexual dimorphism becomes evident only
after controlling for this by looking specifically at ratios of
male to female muscle mass (Puts, 2010). Moreover, male/
female differences in muscle mass come principally from
males possessing more fast-twitch muscle, which is the type
of muscle that adds visible bulk and anaerobically enables
short-lived explosions of speed and power. The effect of this
is to endow the average man with 90% more upper body
strength than the average woman (Puts, 2010). But fast-
twitch muscle fiber is metabolically costly, exacting great
amounts of nutrition in both its production and maintenance.
Ever thrifty, the evolution of such a costly trait will not pro-
ceed without need. Females serve as the single most viable
benchmark of how much fast-twitch fiber a species needs for
survival. Even male/female division of labor, such as the
common hunting versus gathering dichotomy, should not be
expected to drive males far beyond females in terms of fast-
twitch muscle fiber mass. This is especially true because, in
hunting, humans do not regularly use fast-twitch muscle to
overwhelm their prey with superior strength, or outstrip them
with superior speed; rather, humans rely much more on intel-
ligence, collective action, and weapons technologies, trap-
ping and ambush (Bunn & Pickering, 2010). In fact, to the
degree that muscle was necessary for successful hunting,
slow-twitch muscle might have been more important than
fast-twitch muscle fiber. This conclusion comes from studies
of modern hunter-gathers, such as the bushmen of the
Kalahari desert, who often employ persistence hunting,
which entails tailing prey for extremely long distances until
it becomes exhausted (Liebenberg, 2006). In contrast to fast-
twitch muscle, slow-twitch muscle, enabling protracted
repetitive motion, does not effectively separate men from
women, such that female ultra-endurance swimmers
(Eichenberger et al., 2012) and female ultra-endurance run-
ners (Hoffman, 2008; Speechly, Taylor, & Rogers, 1979)
often perform nearly as well as their male counterparts. In
counterpoint, as Darwin (1871/1998) understood, differ-
ences in musculature are not a product of male­female
division of labor, but of male­male contest competition
(Muller & Thompson, 2012; Plavcan, 2001, 2004; Puts,
2010). In this light, it is of utmost relevance that "sex differ-
ence in upper-body muscle mass in humans is similar to the
sex difference in fat-free mass in gorillas," which suggest an
evolutionary history of male rivalry for female access (Puts,
2010, p. 161).
Having established the extent and significance of muscle,
especially of the fast-twitch variety, it is instructive to exam-
ine racial variation. This most sensitive marker of polygamy
highlights the extent of extant racial differences. Just as
decreased emphasis on the explosiveness of fast-twitch mus-
cle greatly diminishes the performance gap between males
and females, so it lessens the performance gap between Asian
and non-Asian males. Chinese runners, for example, rarely if
ever win gold medals except in endurance competitions
(Baker, 1975; Harpalani, 1996), which predominantly require
slow-twitch muscle. It seems that Asian populations have less
fat-free mass (Hull et al., 2011) and significantly less fast-
twitch skeletal muscle fiber (Rushton, 2000; Silva et al.,
2010). Furthermore, not only do Asian men have less visible
bulk, butAsian women may prefer less visible bulk.As a gen-
eral rule, females prefer males of the muscular mesomorphic
type. However, the ectomorphic male, one who is skinny and
less muscled, obtained proportionally higher ratings among
Chinese samples (A. F. Dixson, 2009). Chinese women pre-
ferred average physiques to mesomorphic physiques, whereas
British women, for instance, preferred mesomorphic phy-
siques to average physiques. Therefore, the mesomorphic
physique might be largely a product of sexual selection, gen-
erated and perpetuated through the mechanisms of male com-
petition and female choice (A. F. Dixson, 2009; B. J. Dixson,
Dixson, Li, & Anderson, 2007). Furthermore, data on Asian
muscle mass are complemented by genetics studies:
Improving sprint performance, showing correlations with
muscle mass (Berman & North, 2010), conferring speed and
velocity (N.Yang et al., 2003), and being commonly described
as a gene for speed (Berman & North, 2010; MacArthur &
North, 2004), ACTN3 is specifically expressed in fast-twitch
skeletal muscles (Lachance & Tishkoff, 2013; Norman et al.,
2009; North, 2008). Instructively,Asian populations show the
highest rates of -actinin-3-deficient genotype (577XX), as
compared with Caucasian and African samples (N. Yang
et al., 2003).
Finally, there are two more corroborating points of evi-
dence. First, as compared with Caucasian and African males,
Asian males have longer life spans, and, according to A. F.
Dixson (2009), shortened male life span is possibly a product
of the taxing nature of male­male competition in the matrix
of polygamous mating systems. Second, body hair is an
important and prominent secondary sexual characteristic of
which Asians have less (Ewing & Rouse, 1978; Montagna &
Parakkal, 1974; Rook, Wilkinson, & Ebling, 1972). Not only
do Asian men have less body hair (Ewing & Rouse, 1978),
but Asian women, judging from a Chinese sample, seem to
Hertler 5
prefer less body hair (A. F. Dixson, 2009). Importantly, the
beard is not excepted; Asian men have appreciably less facial
hair (Santner et al., 1998; Wu, Konduru, & Deng, 2012).
Beards, described by B. J. Dixson and Vasey (2012) as "strik-
ingly sexually dimorphic androgen-dependent secondary
sexual trait in humans," seem to signal status, dominance, and
aggressiveness (Addison, 1989; A. F. Dixson, Dixson, &
Anderson, 2005), and in fact evolved "primarily via intrasex-
ual selection between males" (B. J. Dixson & Vasey, 2012).
Pan troglodytes: The Signature of
Promiscuity
The chimpanzee is the primate exemplar of promiscuity, car-
rying many markers of covert mating competition. Certainly,
there are attempts by males to impede matings by other
males, both by harassment and active interruption of coitus
before insemination (A. F. Dixson, 2012), but there are no
proprietary rights to females, no pair bonding, and no harem
formation. The promiscuity of chimpanzees, who live in
multi-male/multi-female troops, is well documented. Similar
to Papio ursinus and Brachyteles arachnoides, chimpanzee
females are mounted and mated by several males, sometimes
more than 10, during the peak of their 36- to 48-hr cycles.
Multiple matings with multiple males over a discreet period
creates the conditions for sperm competition (A. F. Dixson &
Anderson, 2004), such that a contest is carried out by proxy
through sperm within the reproductive apparatus of the
female chimpanzee. In consequence, male chimpanzees bear
the marks of sperm competition, principally by virtue of their
large testes, which, in combination, rival the mass and vol-
ume of the brain. Compared with the polygamous gorilla,
chimpanzee testes are 4 times heavier in absolute terms, and
16 times heavier relative to body weight (A. F. Dixson,
2012).Along with large testes, chimpanzees have high sperm
volume and high sperm counts. These are widely acknowl-
edged to be physiological markers of promiscuity.
As humans do not show the prodigious sexual dimorphism
of the gorilla, so they do not show the prodigious virility of
the chimpanzee. Still, as before, humans appear to be part of
the way in the same direction, though perhaps not progressed
nearly so far along in that direction. Certainly though, human
testes are outsized for the requirements of monogamous mat-
ing (Cachel, 2006; Harcourt, 1995; Simmons, Firman,
Rhodes, & Peters, 2004). Some think this enlargement is ves-
tigial and of little consequence (Brown, Shumaker, &
Downhower, 1995;A. F. Dixson, 2009, 2012), whereas others
think this enlargement is active and exceedingly relevant
(Shackelford & Pound, 2010; R. L. Smith, 1984). It very well
might be, as A. F. Dixson reasons from comparative analyses
of human sperm activity, sperm mitochondrial density, sperm
mid-piece volume, relatively low sperm recovery rates, and
the lack of a baculum, that reports of sperm competition are
greatly exaggerated; nonetheless, reports of strategic sperm
allocation (Ball & Parker, 2007; Goetz & Shackelford, 2009;
Klusmann, 2006; Pham & Shackelford, 2013; Shackelford &
Goetz, 2007) via the Coolidge effect (A. F. Dixson, 2012;
Shackelford, Goetz, McKibbin, & Starratt, 2007; White,
1986), as well as prolonged intromission and the relatively
large human penis, both of which are correlated with promis-
cuity and sperm competition, remain as support, unexplained
except with the recognition of human sperm competition.
Also, as Simmons and colleagues (2004) noted, evidence for
modest sperm competition comes from approximately 1 in
400 double paternity dizygotic twins.
Without descending into the minutia of this argument, and
assuming a modest, but relevant, role for human sperm com-
petition, it is important to examine existing interracial differ-
ences (Brown et al., 1995; Harcourt, 1997). A. F. Dixson
compiled data on testes weight from multiple studies show-
ing that, collapsing across most racial groupings and includ-
ing inhabitants from countries as geographically disparate as
Australia and Finland, combined testes weight fluctuates
between 30 and 50 g. All measured countries fall within this
range save China, which, according to one sample of 109
individuals, showed a mean combined testes weight of 16.55
g (Short, 1984), and another sample of 100 individuals,
which showed a mean combined testes weight of 19.01 g (K.
S. F. Chang, Hsu, Chan, & Chan, 1960). This is a striking
difference. A. F. Dixson remarked that "Nigerian men have
testes more than twice as large as those of Hong Kong
Chinese subjects of similar height" (A. F. Dixson, 2009, p.
31). Although this is an extreme example, general American
samples indicate testicle weight almost twice that of Chinese
samples. Furthermore, even though most of the aforemen-
tioned statistics do not control for body weight, they cannot
be explained by it (A. F. Dixson, 2009).
Asian populations not only have less combined testicular
mass but a relative reduction in the number and function of
Sertoli cells (Johnson et al., 1998), which reside in the semi-
niferous tubules and secrete several hormones integral to
spermatogenesis (Griswold, 1998). Although spermatogene-
sis is anatomically dependent on Sertoli cells, it is physiolog-
ically dependent on testosterone (Sharpe, 1987; Weinbauer
& Nieschlag, 1990). Although there are no reliably recorded
absolute differences in blood-circulating testosterone (Ewing
& Rouse, 1978), when compared with Caucasian samples,
Asian men, but notAsian women, have significantly less pre-
cursor androgens, such as dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate
and androstenedione (Lookingbill et al., 1991). Furthermore,
Asian males have less endogenous androgen receptors for
testosterone (Zitzmann & Nieschlag, 2001) and possibly also
less of a particular enzyme requisite for converting testoster-
one into an active form (Greaves, 2001). Therefore, it is not
surprising that, following these anatomical and physiological
differences, sperm counts are correspondingly low among
Asian populations (Iwamoto, Nozawa, & Yoshiike, 2007;
von Eckardstein et al., 2001) and sperm production can be

Reduced sperm production among Asian males has a genetic
derivative, specifically found in racial variation in the num-
ber of cytosine, adenine, guanine (CAG) repeats (Bennett
et al., 2002; Sartor, Zheng, & Eastham, 1999). Asatiani,
Eckardstein, Simoni, Gromoll, and Nieschlag (2003, p. 255)
noted that "a slight increase in the number of CAG repeat
sequences in exon 1 of the androgen receptor gene causes
idiopathic oligozoospermia." Both this condition and its
cause have been implicated in Asian male infertility prob-
lems (Komori et al., 1999). Finally, racial differences might
extend beyond spermatogenesis to encompass lower seminal
fluid volume more generally. Among Asian males, the pros-
tate, for example, appears to be less active, as judged by
extremely low rates of prostate cancer (Rushton, 2000;
Santner et al., 1998). This is significant because prostate can-
cer and productivity are positively correlated, such that the
more metabolically active prostate will at once make its car-
rier more fecund and prone to cancer (Greaves, 2001). In this
way, a less active prostate might be a sign of relaxed mating
competition.
These anatomical and physiological differences are cou-
pled with behavioral differences. Asian persons appear to be
less sexually active than either European or African persons
as judged by pornography usage (Lo, So, & Zhang, 2010),
reports of sexual fantasy, age of first intercourse, and via per-
centage and frequency of pre-marital sexual encounters
(Rushton, 2000). Furthermore, these racial differences in
pre-marital intercourse are present in post-marital inter-
course, with Asian couples engaging in coitus approximately
half as much as European and African American persons.
Sexual attitudes are also less permissive and feelings of guilt
are more frequent. Even among Americans, and when con-
trolling for the independent effects of socio-economic status,
Asian Americans have lower rates of divorce, less extramari-
tal affairs, and fewer out of wedlock births than the national
average (Rushton, 1988). Finally, these racially based sexual
differences correlate with extremely low rates of chlamydia,
syphilis, HIV, and other sexually transmitted diseases among
Asians, which can be taken as a crude proxy of sexual behav-
ior6 (Rushton, 2000).
Discussion
It is very fortunate that humans are as dissimilar from the
gorilla and chimpanzee as they are. The polygamous mating
system of the gorilla renders dominant harem-holders preoc-
cupied with defense and subordinate juveniles preoccupied
with conquest. This breeds vigilance and anticipation on one
side, and opportunism and aggression on the other. The young,
roving male, unencumbered by children and insecure of his
genetic future, is a destabilizing force in any society, ape or
human. Alternately, the promiscuous mating system of the
chimpanzee is distractingly sexual. It encourages physiologi-
cally taxing and time-consuming mating bouts as well as
vigilance for, and following of, females in estrous. At the same
time, it creates paternal uncertainty and discourages joint
parental care. Although under recent evolution humans have
very likely become less sexually dimorphic and polygamous
(Butovskaya & Kozintsev, 1999; Darwin, 1968/1859), as well
as less sexually virile and promiscuous (Gavrilets, 2012), one
might lament that we are not even further away from both the
gorilla and the chimpanzee so as to be strictly monogamous.7
For, in the absence of strict monogamy, not only is there always
some degree of male­male competition but also male­female
antagonism, known as sexual conflict, of which infanticide
(Arnqvist & Rowe, 2005), maternal effect lethals (Perrimon,
Engstrom, & Mahowald, 1989; Shearn, Hersperger, &
Hersperger, 1978), and parental zygotic conflict (Werren &
Beukeboom, 1998) are examples.
All such competition, antagonism, and sexual conflict are
divisive--it is a spur to violence, if not its principal source.
As Gat (2006) said, sexual competition is "that other princi-
pal source of human competition" (p. 415). It is not only in
myth that a Helen can bring war. Among the much studied
Yanomamo peoples of the Amazonian forest, for example,
within-village violence was most often precipitated by adul-
tery and women-related quarrels. "Some incidents were
caused by suitors' competition, some by women's abduction
and forced sex, some by broken promises of marriage, and
most, perhaps, by jealous husbands over suspicion of wives'
infidelity" (Gat, 2006, p. 69). In fact, it seems that the first
instance of conflict between the New World and the Old
stemmed from male­male conflict over access to native
females (Landes, 1998). Likewise, "women-related feuds
were the main cause of homicide" among the !Kung (Gat,
2006, p. 71). Transcending the anthropological anecdote, a
cross-cultural study (Otterbein, 1994) has found polygyny to
be one of the most distinctive correlates of "feuding and
internal warfare" (Gat, 2006, p. 74). When elite elders
monopolize fertile females, young males are disposed toward
"abduction of women, elopement, and violence" (Gat, 2006,
p. 181). By way of distinction, monogamy minimizes con-
flict (Gat, 2006; Tucker, 1993) creating ". . . affiliative bonds
with females [that] circumvent the need for continual contest
competition among males" (Alberts, 2012, p. 423 circum-
vent . . . "]). Not surprisingly, monogamy is encouraged in
society, by governmental and within religious organizations,
all of which provide incentives to enter into the marriage
bond, and rituals to solidify that bond.
Although cross-national crime rate comparisons evince
methodological problems (Maxfield & Babbie, 2014;
Neapolitan, 1996; Skogan, 1975), and though rates may vary
as a function of the international database selected, it is sug-
gestive that a study referencing INTERPOL, the International
Criminal Police Organization, reports that Asian populations
display the lowest rates of violent crime, including rape,8
murder, and assault: Across the years 1984, 1990, and 1996,
per 100,000 individuals, Asian countries show rates of 49, 32,
and 35, as compared with combined averages for European
Hertler 7
and African nations of 102, 157.5, and 95.5 (Rushton, 2000).
These international trends are recapitulated in the multiracial
United States, as documented by United States Department of
Justice Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal Justice
Information Services Division arrest rates from 2012, Table
43,9 wherein rape, murder, and assault statistics fall out,
respectively as follows: (a) rape rate of 1.2% Asian/Pacific
Islander versus a combined 97.5% for White/Black, (b) mur-
der rates of 1.2% Asian/Pacific Islander versus a combined
97.6% for White/Black, and (c) aggravated assault rates of
1.6% Asian/Pacific Islander versus a combined 96.9% for
White/Black. Importantly, although Asian/Pacific Islanders
constitute only an average of 1.33 arrests for rape, murder,
and assault in the United States, they comprise 5% of the U.S.
population as per the 2010 U.S. Census.10
In addition, restricted local violence engenders restricted
national violence. It is suggestive that China was seemingly
first to transcend the bounds of kinship, band, and tribe, to
establish empire (Fukuyama, 2011; Gat, 2006), which it did
without the facilitative ecological caging effects available,
for example, to Egyptian civilizations isolated on a fertile
ribbon amidst a sea of sand (Mann, 2012). Restricted mating
competition will not necessarily result in less war between
groups, but it should reduce small-scale violence among
them. The point is most stunningly demonstrated by China, a
land more or less constantly dominated by established dynas-
ties since 221 BC, each capable of imposing stable, central-
ized rule across approximately the same million square
kilometers. By comparison, the West unified less than half
this territory for less than half this time under the Roman
Empire, and thereafter dissolved into fiefdoms, duchies,
principalities, and municipalities, some of which only
matured into comparatively small states in the 18th and 19th
centuries (L. Chang et al., 2011). Concomitantly, Asia has
collectively engaged in less warfare, with only 26 recorded
major wars within the modern era, specifically between 1648
and 1989, as compared with Europe's 97. Moreover, most
Asian military offensives come after 1945 and were waged
against European powers, as insularity, starting with
Commodore M. C. Perry's coerced opening of Japan in 1854,
continued to erode (L. Chang et al., 2011).
Low incidence of violent crime and reduced levels of
intra-population warfare is found amid a culture that stresses
communion, with individual competition being subordinate
to collective action. In this way, Asian cultures seem to better
solve what Allport called the master problem, namely, the
relatively more pronounced subordination of individual
interests to societal needs (E. A. Locke, 2011). When one
juxtaposes such criminal and military statistics, and the lit-
erature describing collectivism, with the evidence of
decreased somatic and genital competition reviewed in this
article, there is a correlation suggestive of causation. These
biological corollaries of collectivism stand in contradiction
to the traditions set forth by Lowie, Boaz, Durkheim, and
Meade that create "a sharp divide between biological and
cultural evolution, denying that the former had any but the
most trivial significance in human affairs" (Alves, 1999;
Elsworthy, 1999; Gat, 2006, p. 150; Slurink, 1999).
Convinced that culture arises sui generis, those ethnogra-
phers in the tradition of Lowie, might, for instance, explain
collectivism by way of Confucianism. In contradiction, the
biological perspective herein maintained would consider the
Confucian ethics of loyalty as a correlate, rather than as a
cause of collectivist communion. Prehistorically evolved
biological differences in mating physiology predisposed
Asian populations to be receptive to both Confucian values
specifically and collectivism generally. In sum, basic traits
and characteristics that are largely biologically shaped pre-
dispose one to attach value to, adopt, espouse, hold, and
champion particular views--views that themselves are erro-
neously held to be principal causal agents. In consequence, it
may be that the evolutionary biologist, comparative psychol-
ogist, and behavioral ecologist have as much to contribute to
the understanding of cultural variation as do the anthropolo-
gist, historian, and sociologist.
To be clear, however, biology does not cause collectiv-
ism--at least not in the simple way that the impact of a reflex
hammer causes a reflex. The relationship between biology
and collectivism could never be so straightforwardly causal
because biology and culture combine dynamically, and very
likely emergently, in a way that tempers the power of reduc-
tionistic explanation. That being said, in the face of these
co-occurring biological and cultural differences, it is hard to
evade the possibility that collectivist culture is on the leash
of the gene. As more and more researchers are now recogniz-
ing, greater understanding comes from viewing evolution
and culture as reciprocal, together dynamically creating civi-
lization (Lieberman & Gangestad, 2010). In the years since
Wilson's dictum, culture­gene coevolution, otherwise called
dual inheritance theory (Alberts, 2012), "has emerged as an
influential theory to explain how human behaviour is a prod-
uct of two complementary and interacting evolutionary pro-
cesses: genetic and cultural evolution" (Chiao & Blizinsky,
2010, p. 529; Cavalli-Sforza & Feldman, 1981; Lumsden,
Wilson, Packing, & Rare, 1981). Moreover, the Wilsonian
approach, of which gene-culture coevolution is a sort of gen-
eral derivative, has more recently been extended specifically
to collectivism, with some exploring the genomics of col-
lectivism (Eisenberg & Hayes, 2011; Kim et al., 2011; Way
& Lieberman, 2010), while others explore the ecology of
collectivism (Van de Vliert, Yang, Wang, & Ren, 2013). Still
more research groups are looking to the prevalence and
nature of host­parasite interactions (Fincher & Thornhill,
2012; Fincher, Thornhill, Murray, & Schaller, 2008), patho-
gen prevalence (Fincher & Thornhill, 2008; Murray &
Schaller, 2014), neuron­culture interaction (Bender & Ng,
2009; Ng, Han, Mao, & Lai, 2010), and to neutrally based
racial differences to explain the origins of collectivism
(Chiao, Cheon, Pornpattananangkul, Mrazek, & Blizinsky,
2013; Kim & Sasaki, 2014; Mateo et al., 2013). Many of
8 SAGE Open
these new and innovative explanations have intuitive appeal
and might serve the end of finding an ultimate biological pre-
cursor of collectivist values. Recognizing that some of these
explanations are not mutually exclusive, Van de Vliert and
colleagues have attempted to weave several together. It
seems that the set of biological differences herein described
should take its place among these models as science contin-
ues on its newly assumed path toward the construction of a
biology of collectivism.
Although compiling and contextualizing data, the present
review has been neither exhaustive nor systematic. Before
integrating the present model with those described above,
more studies should be surveyed, and perhaps undertaken, in
search of corroborating or disconfirming evidence for the
present thesis. Female behavior and anatomy, only twice or
thrice broached herein, should be further explored. Genetic
analysis should prove edifying, with special attention given
to sexually antagonistic genetic regions (Rice, 1984; Saifl &
Chandra, 1999; Stearns & Koella, 2007). Also, forthcoming
studies should investigate the significance of extreme 2D:4D
digit ratios (Manning, Stewart, Bundred, & Trivers, 2004)
and extreme male-biased sex ratios (Garenne, 2002; Lazarus,
2002; Ruder, 1986) among Asian populations. Finally, in
addition to simply strengthening the physical and physiolog-
ical data as advised above, research efforts should be directed
toward fundamentally explaining the cause of such data.
Though the present model succeeds in chaining cultural
diversity to evolved biology, it does not explain the origins of
this evolved biology. In this way, the most fruitful line of
future research will search for an ultimate evolutionary
explanation of the proximate biological differences pre-
sented herein. Doing so will entail the (a) review of prehis-
torical migration patterns, gene flow, inter-cultural conflict,
and warring; (b) evolutionary history including founder
effects, drift, and history; (c) ecological variables such as
rainfall, temperature, soil, and climate; and (d) conducting of
a comparative examination of indigenous flora and fauna,
most especially parasites and predators.
Notes
1. Although the present article employs the term race, it does
so, and should be read with the express knowledge that intra-
specific variation observed across human populations falls far
short of the formal biological use of the term: ". . . a geneti-
cally distinct lineage within a species" (Lenski, 2014, p. 730).
Templeton (2014) decisively and unambiguously stated that
races do not exist within the human population, noting by
way of proof, rates of gene flow, and admixture. "There are,"
Templeton asserted, "no biological races in humans; indeed,
despite our global distribution, we are one of the most geneti-
cally homogeneous species on this planet" (Templeton, 2014,
p. 807). However, Templeton went on to state that
this finding does not mean that all human populations are
genetically identical. Isolation by distance ensures that
human populations are genetically differentiated from
one another, and local adaptation ensures that some of
these differences reflect adaptive evolution to the
environmental heterogeneity that our globally distributed
species experiences.
It is in reference to this subtle ecologically induced variation
that race is presently used.
 2. As there is much similarity across racial groupings, so there is
much difference within them. Broad categories such as Asian
and Caucasian collapse across much genetic, ethnic, and lin-
guistic diversity, falling somewhere between a useful heu-
ristic and an objective division. Problems persist even when
descending from super-national to national divisions. Fully
one fifth of the human species is Chinese, for example, and
within the Chinese people are contained 56 nationally recog-
nized ethnic groupings (Cavalli-Sforza, 1998). Therefore, to
say anything about Chinese persons collectively, much less
Asian persons collectively, is to collapse across significant
diversity, a point which should be duly acknowledged and
minded while interpreting this and other racially based reports.
3. Signaling among fireflies is not exclusively used in mating;
females, for instance, have been observed to co-opt these bio-
luminescent signals to attract, and then ingest, males of sepa-
rate species (Lewis & Cratsley, 2008).
4. Being one of the most diverse orders of life (Farrell, 1998),
beetles consequently afford a laboratory for studying the overt
and covert forms of mating conflict presently discussed. It
seems that species that invest more in overt competition, invest
less in covert competition, and the other way around: "the spe-
cies which had evolved relatively longer horns," Snell-Rood
and Moczek (2013) wrote, "had also evolved relatively shorter
copulatory organs, and vice versa" (p. 192).
 5. These ratios, and the cross-species means from which they are
derived, are calculations presently made from data presented
in Table 3.2 of Dixon's Primate Sexuality.
 6. It is important to note that rates of sexually transmitted disease
(STD) may provide a proxy for rates of sexual behavior, as
implied herein; however, intervening factors, such as medi-
cal treatments and prophylactic devices, could alternatively
account for reported differences in STD prevalence.
 7. However, the relaxation of sexual selection that comes of strict
monogamy, while it may impart social order and facilitate
social harmony, might equally diminish personality variability,
innovation, and genius.
 8. Rape may be a particularly hard crime to measure.As compared
with, for instance, homicide, there are more definitional differ-
ences as to what constitutes rape. Also, unlike assault victims,
for instance, rape victims are more apt to experience shame and
fear stigma, which can function to inhibit reporting, and the
sense of shame and stigma may vary by culture, and therefore
by nation. In addition, there are sundry other methodological
problems that suggest caution in interpreting cross-national
rape statistics (Fisher, 2009; Koss, 1996; Lynch, 1996).
 9. Federal Bureau of Investigation data were broken down by race,
separately reporting on four categories: (a) White, (b) Black, (c)
American Indian/Alaska Native, and (d) Asian/Pacific Islander.
The reported combined numbers for White/Black crime was cal-
culated by the current researcher by adding, and then dividing,
White/Black percentages. These data were retrieved on April 9,
2015, at the following website: http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/

White, (b) Black or African American, (c) American Indian or

the addition, by the present researcher, of 4.8% Asian and
0.2% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander. This information,
