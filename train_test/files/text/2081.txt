OBJECTIVE -- Evidence has shown that Mexican Americans have a higher prevalence of
diabetes and a greater risk for diabetes-related complications than non-Hispanic whites. How-
ever, no studies have described the changes in prevalence among older Mexican Americans. The
purpose of this study was to expand on the current literature by examining the trends in diabetes
prevalence and diabetes-related complications in Mexican Americans aged 75 years from
1993­1994 to 2004­2005.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- The prevalences of self-reported diabetes
and diabetes-related complications were estimated in the original cohort (1993­1994) and the
new cohort (2004­2005) of the Hispanic Established Population for the Epidemiologic Study of
the Elderly (Hispanic EPESE) and were compared across the two surveys.
RESULTS -- The prevalence of diabetes among Mexican Americans aged 75 years has
nearly doubled between 1993­1994 and 2004­2005 from 20.3 to 37.2%, respectively (P 
0.001). The increase in the prevalence of diabetes was similar across all sociodemographic
factors. Diabetes complications did not change significantly between the two cohorts. However,
the prevalence of having any lower-extremity function disability did increase between the two
cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS -- The prevalence of diabetes in older Mexican Americans has increased
dramatically. At the same time, there has been no improvement in diabetes-related complications
as has been found in the general older population. These findings heighten the urgency for more
effective public health interventions targeted to this population. As diabetes and obesity become
more prevalent in older adults, physicians should encourage appropriate management in older
patients, including early detection and glycemic control.
Diabetes Care 32:2212­2217, 2009
Diabetes is the seventh leading cause
of death in the U.S., affecting 16.8
million Americans in 2006 (1). The
prevalence of diabetes among individuals
aged 75 years is projected to increase
336% by 2050 (2). This upward trend is
attributed mainly to the aging of the pop-
ulation, an increase in obesity, and life-
style changes (3­5). Simultaneously,
there has been a decrease in the preva-
lence of several diabetes-related compli-
cations as a result of advancements in
diabetes management (6).
Older Hispanics are a rapidly growing
segment of the U.S. population (7). Dur-
ing 1999 and 2002, diabetes was diag-
nosed in 24.9% of older Mexican
Americans (aged 65 years) compared
with only 14.3% of non-Hispanic white
adults of the same age (8). Mexican Amer-
icans also have an increased risk and prev-
alence of diabetes-related complications
and a higher disability rate compared
with non-Hispanic whites (9,10). As
overall life expectancy has increased,
many Mexican Americans are living
longer with more comorbidities including
diabetes (9). Although several studies
have examined the national trends of di-
abetes over the previous decades, no stud-
ies have examined the trends in diabetes
prevalence and diabetes-related compli-
cations among older Mexican Americans.
Hence, the purpose of this study was to
expand on the current literature by exam-
ining the trends in diabetes prevalence
and diabetes-related complications over
the period 1993­1994 to 2004­2005,
comparing two separate representative
samples from the Hispanic Established
Population for the Epidemiologic Study
of the Elderly (Hispanic EPESE), a com-
munity-based study of older Mexican
Americans (aged 65 years) residing in
five southwestern states. This analysis
builds on earlier work with the baseline
data from this study, which showed high
rates of diabetes and diabetes complica-
tions in older Mexican Americans in
1993­1994 (11­14).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- Data from the original
cohort surveyed in 1993­1994 and the
new cohort surveyed in 2004­2005 of
the Hispanic EPESE, a community-based
study of older noninstitutionalized Mexi-
can Americans residing in five southwest-
ern states (Texas, California, Arizona,
Colorado, and New Mexico) were com-
pared. The original cohort of the Hispanic
EPESE included a total of 3,050 Mexican
Americans aged 65 years. This cohort
was selected through multistage area
probability sampling of selected counties,
blocks, and households, ensuring that
the results could be generalizable to
500,000 older Mexican Americans.
Specific sampling procedures describing
the Hispanic EPESE are available else-
where (15). The response rate in 1993­
1994 was 83%. Of that sample, a total of
1,132 subjects were aged 75 years. In

new sample of 902 respondents aged
75 years was added, using sampling
procedures similar to those used in 1993­
1994. Interviews were conducted in En-
glish and Spanish, depending on the
subjects' preference. Our study included
subjects both from the original cohort in
1993­1994 and from the new cohort in
2004­2005 who were aged 75 years.
This process resulted in two independent
samples of Mexican Americans aged 75
years for analyses.
Measurement of diabetes
Respondents were coded as having diabe-
tes in 1993­1994 and 2004­2005 if they
reported that they had been told by a doc-
tor that they had diabetes, sugar in their
urine, or high blood glucose or if they
were found to be taking hypoglycemic
drugs in an inspection of the medications
they had taken in the 2 weeks before the
interview.
Diabetes-related complications
Diabetes-related complications examined
were microvascular complications, in-
cluding kidney disease and visual impair-
ment, and macrovascular complications,
including circulatory disease and periph-
eral circulatory problems. Functional dis-
ability was also assessed. Kidney disease
was determined by the following ques-
tion: "As a result of your diabetes, have
you ever had any problems with your kid-
neys?" Visual impairment was deter-
mined by the following question: "As a
result of your diabetes, have you ever had
any problems with your eyes?" Peripheral
circulatory disease was determined by the
following question: "As a result of your
diabetes, have you ever had any problems
with the circulation in your legs or arms?"
Subjects were determined to have cardio-
vascular disease if they reported ever hav-
ing a heart attack or a stroke.
Functional disability was ascertained
through several self-reported variables.
Lower-extremity function was measured
by walking in a small room, walking a
half-mile, walking up and down stairs,
and transferring from bed to a chair.
These items were examined separately
and also summed to form a dichotomous
variable indicating any lower-body dis-
ability. Also available was a measure of
activities of daily living (ADL), which as-
sessed disability by asking the subjects if
they needed assistance with one or more
of the following tasks: bathing, grooming,
dressing, eating, transferring, or toileting.
Instrumental activities of daily living
(IADL) disability was assessed by asking
the respondents if they needed assistance
with one or more of the following tasks:
using a telephone, driving, shopping, pre-
paring meals, doing light housework, tak-
ing medicine, or handling money. Both
ADL and IADL disability were dichoto-
mized, indicating any ADL and IADL dis-
ability separately.
Demographic and health-related
characteristics
Other covariates included in the analyses
were age, years of education, sex, obesity,
hypertension, and number of physicians'
visits in the past year. Age was dichoto-
mized as 75­79 years and 80 years.
Self-reported hypertension was measured
by asking whether a physician had ever
told the respondents that they had high
blood pressure. BMI was calculated from
the respondent's measured height and
weight. BMI was categorized as 24, 25­
29, and 30 kg/m2. Number of physician
visits in the year before the interview was
assessed by standard questions.
Statistical methods
Descriptive analyses of the sample were
conducted using means and 95% CIs for
continuous variables and proportions for
categorical variables. Comparisons were
made using the Rao-Scott 2 test for cat-
egorical variables and t test statistics for
continuous variables. Diabetes preva-
lence and the prevalence of diabetes-
related complications and functional
disability were estimated in both cohorts
and compared using the Rao-Scott 2 test.
We used SAS (version 9.2) survey proce-
dures software to perform all analyses to
account for design effects and sample
weights.

Table 1 presents the descriptive charac-
teristics of the full sample of Mexican
Americans aged 75 years in both 1993­
1994 and 2004­2005. The average educa-
tional attainment increased significantly
between the two samples from 4.3 years in
the original cohort to 5.3 years in the new
cohort (P  0.003). There was a signifi-
cant increase in the number of individuals
with Medicare and private insurance from
17.0 to 25.4% (P  0.049). Obesity rates
also increased between 1993­1994 and
2004­2005 from 20.3 to 28.9% (P 
0.001). Moreover, self-reported hyper-
tension increased significantly between
the two cohorts from 36.6 to 56.7%, re-
spectively (P  0.001). Characteristics
such as age, sex, and physicians' visits did
not change significantly between the two
time periods.

Prevalence of diabetes
Table 2 presents the prevalence rate of
diabetes at each time period as well as the
prevalence of diabetes within the covari-
ate strata. The overall prevalence of dia-
betes increased from 20.3% in 1993­
1994 to 37.2% in 2004 ­2005 (P 
0.001). Moreover, the prevalence of dia-
betes has uniformly increased across all
demographic characteristics, which in-
clude sex, age, and education subgroups.
For example, the increase in diabetes
prevalence was statistically significant for
each age category. An 18.9 (95% CI 11.1­
26.7) percentage point increase was ob-
served in subjects aged 75­79 years and a
15.2 (8.2­22.2) percentage point in-
crease was observed for subjects aged
80 years between these periods.
The prevalence of diabetes increased
since 1993­1994 regardless of health care
usage represented by physicians' visits,
health insurance, BMI, and self-reported
hypertension. Specifically, the prevalence
of diabetes increased across all categories
of physicians' visits, with the largest in-
crease occurring in the five or more visits
category from 26.2% (95% CI 20.7­31.7)
in 1993­1994 to 47.5% (41.0­54.1) in
2004­2005 (P  0.001). Similarly, the
prevalence of diabetes increased across all
types of insurance with the largest in-
crease in prevalence of diabetes among
those with Medicare and Medicaid or
Medicaid only (P  0.001). The preva-
lence of diabetes among overweight (BMI
25­29 kg/m2) Mexican Americans more
than doubled from 16.9% in 1993­1994
to 40.3% in 2004­2005 (P  0.001). The
prevalence of diabetes among obese (BMI
30 kg/m2) Mexican Americans almost
doubled from 27.3% in 1993­1994 to
46.9% in 2004­2005 (P  0.001).
In addition, Table 2 shows prevalence
rates within each covariate strata and
sample year. In both cohorts significant
differences in the prevalence of diabetes
were shown for obesity and self-reported
hypertension. In 1993­1994 the preva-
lence of diabetes was higher among obese
compared with nonobese subjects (27.3
and 17.8%, respectively). A similar pat-
tern was also present in 2004­2005. In
addition, in the 1993­1994 cohort the
prevalence of diabetes among those who
reported hypertension was higher com-
pared with that for those who did not re-
port hypertension (25.3 and 16.4%,
respectively). This pattern was echoed in
2004­2005.
Prevalence of diabetes-related
complications and disability
Table 3 indicates the prevalence of diabe-
tes-related complications and functional
disability among Mexican Americans in
both cohorts. The mean age of the 1993­
1994 cohort was 80.4 (95% CI 79.9­
81.0) and in the 2004­2005 cohort the
mean age was 80.5 (80.0­80.9). No sta-
tistically significant differences were
found between the two cohorts; therefore,
the estimates of diabetes-related compli-
cations were not age adjusted. None of the
microvascular or macrovascular compli-
cations significantly increased between
the two time periods. On the other hand,
having any lower-extremity functional

disability (P  0.031), transferring from
bed (P  0.005), and ADL disability in-
creased among individuals with diabetes
(P  0.047).
CONCLUSIONS -- This is the first
study that examined trends of diabetes
and diabetes-related complications
among Mexican Americans aged 75
years. The prevalence of diabetes in this
sample increased from 20.3% in 1993­
1994 to 37.2% in 2004­2005. The prev-
alence of both microvascular and
macrovascular diabetes complications
and IADL disability did not change signif-
icantly between the two cohorts. How-
ever, the prevalence of having any lower-
extremity disability did increase between
the two cohorts. In addition, self-reported
ADL disability also significantly increased
among individuals with diabetes between
the two time periods.
Our findings are consistent with pre-
vious reports showing a national contin-
uous upward trend in diabetes prevalence
over the previous decade. Reports from
the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention have shown that the prevalence of
diabetes among the general population
aged 75 years increased from 10.4% in
1993 to 16.4% in 2005 (1). Using the Na-
tional Health Interview Survey (NHIS),
the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention estimated the prevalence of dia-
betes among Mexican Americans aged
75 years in 2005 to be 28.5% (SEM
3.6), which was somewhat lower than our
estimate of 37% for 2004­2005 (2.2) (1).
Our data show no significant changes
in diabetes-related visual impairment
among individuals with diabetes over the
period from 1993­1994 to 2004­2005.
This is consistent with national findings
from the NHIS indicating a nonsignificant
change in visual impairment rates among
individuals with diabetes aged 75 years
from 32.4% (SEM 2.0) in 1997 to 27.1%
(1.4) in 2007 (1). Studies report a de-
crease in diabetes-related visual problems
between the 1980s and the beginning of
the 21st century resulting from improve-
ments in screening and glycemic control
(6). This improvement may not be appar-
ent in our study because of differences in
study periods compared with other stud-
ies, the advanced age of our sample, and
measures used.
Although no prevalence data for dia-
betes-related kidney problems have been
reported, findings from the U.S. Renal
Data System showed that incidence rate of
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) among in-
dividuals with diabetes aged 75 years
has increased significantly over the period
from 1997 to 2002, whereas it decreased
among those aged 65 years (16). It is
important to consider that our estimates
measure any kidney disease related to di-
abetes, not ESRD specifically. The in-
crease shown in ESRD presented in
previous reports among those aged 75
years is again probably due to the in-
creased survival of individuals with dia-
betes. Moreover, it could also reflect a
concomitant increase in referral, admis-
sion rates, and intervention rather than an
actual increase in ESRD incidence (6).
Similar to the trends in microvascular
complications, we did not find significant
changes in the prevalence of macrovascu-
lar complications including cardiovascu-
lar disease and peripheral circulatory
problems. These findings are similar to
reports from the NHIS showing no signif-
icant changes in the prevalence of any car-
diovascular disease among the general
population aged 75 years over the pe-
riod from 1997 to 2003 (1). Because ma-
crovascular conditions are not strongly
related to hyperglycemia, improvement
in diabetes management might not mod-
ify the prevalence of these conditions
among individuals with diabetes (17).
The higher prevalence of diabetes re-
ported in this study might be partly due to
changes in the diagnostic criteria. The
cutoff point in glycemia for a diagnosis of
diabetes was decreased from 140 to
126 mg/dl in 1997 (18). This reduction
may have had a substantial influence on
the recent prevalence estimates for diabe-
tes. The new diagnostic criteria are prob-
ably capturing individuals with diabetes
at an earlier point in the disease. Reports
have suggested that widespread use of the
new criteria are capturing many individ-
uals with undiagnosed diabetes, which

may result in even higher prevalence esti-
mates (18).
Another explanation for the upward
trend in diabetes is the concurrent in-
crease in obesity in older Mexican Amer-
icans. As we have shown above, the
prevalence of obesity has increased dra-
matically in this older population since
the baseline interview in 1993­1994.
Obesity is reported to be one of the most
significant factors contributing to the de-
velopment of diabetes and is highly prev-
alent in Hispanic populations (19).
Mexican Americans are living longer
but are living with more chronic condi-
tions and more disability (9). Older adults
with diabetes are more likely to have
functional disabilities and are more likely
to use mobility aids compared with indi-
viduals without diabetes (20). Conse-
quently, more functional disability
among individuals with diabetes could
also lead to an overall reduction in active
life expectancy.
Active life expectancy is an important
consideration because the prevalence of
diabetes has dramatically increased
among Mexican Americans aged 75
years. It has been found that individuals
with diabetes aged 75 years in the U.K.
have experienced a significant reduction
in active life expectancy in recent years,
where individuals without diabetes had
an extra 2 years of life without disability
compared with individuals with diabetes
in 1999 (21). Similarly, a study consisting
of older adults aged 65 years showed
that those who do not have diabetes gain
between 4 and 5 disability-free years of
life (22). Both diabetes and obesity con-
tribute to a reduction in functional ability.
Older adults who are obese are more
likely to become disabled and, generally
speaking, older adults are also less likely
to recover compared with younger obese
individuals (23). As Mexican Americans
age, specific attention to the pathways
leading to this increase in obesity such as
the reduction of adipose tissue in the ab-
dominal area and dietary modifications
could reduce functional disability and in-
crease future active life expectancy.
There are several limitations to this
study. The determination of a diabetes di-
agnosis was based on a self-reported mea-
sure and was not based on any clinical
measure of fasting plasma glucose. In ad-
dition, the presence of diabetes-related
complications was also based on self-
report. However, these types of self-
reported measures have been found to
be a valid and reliable method of deter-
mining the presence of disease (24).
Nevertheless, underreporting may have
occurred by not including those in whom
diabetes has not yet been diagnosed, but
who actually have the disease. In the U.S.,
it is estimated that there are 2.4 million
individuals with undiagnosed diabetes.
Moreover, many diagnoses are incidental
and only occur when related complica-
tions emerge. New onset of diabetes in
older individuals is not very common,
meaning that oftentimes diabetes goes
undiagnosed while other complications
arise (25).
In summary, in light of the high preva-
lence of diabetes in this group, no improve-
ment in diabetes-related complications
heightens the urgency for public health
interventions. As diabetes is projected to
become more prevalent in older adults in
the future (2), physicians need to be
trained in early detection of diabetes
among older adults and should encourage
appropriate management in patients aged
75 years, including glycemic control
and healthier lifestyles and adequate
pharmacological treatment when indi-
cated. Moreover, common clinical and
physiological pathways between obesity
and diabetes may allow the development
of interventions that might improve dia-
betes-related complications and func-
tional disability in this population.
