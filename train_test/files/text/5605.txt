Introduction
In the study of well-being, two main theoretical frameworks
have been proposed: the hedonic approach and the eudai-
monic approach (Ryan & Deci, 2001). Hedonic well-being
corresponds to the subjective well-being (SWB) construct,
defined as the presence of life satisfaction and positive affect,
and the absence of negative affect. Eudaimonic well-being
refers to the dimensions that describe the optimal psycho-
logical functioning of the individuals (e.g., meaning in life,
positive relationships, and self-acceptance). Although these
two perspectives have been developed independently of each
other, recently it has been proposed that they should be inte-
grated (Huppert & So, 2013) because of the substantial over-
lap between the two constructs (e.g., Disabato, Goodman,
Kashdan, Short, & Jarden, 2016; Huta & Ryan, 2010;
Kashdan, Biswas-Diener, & King, 2008). Here, we provide
evidence contrary to this proposal by showing that hedonia
and eudaimonia are distinguishable, and that flourishing
relates to the cognitive component of SWB more than
hedonic affect. Moreover, factor analyses of our data support
a bipartite model of SWB over a one-factor model. The
results of the present study, thus, suggest the usefulness of
separate measures for these two components of well-being.
Different Types of Well-Being?
It may be simpler to consider well-being to be a unidimen-
sional construct, as hypothesized, for example, by the Oxford
Happiness Questionnaire (Hills & Argyle, 2002) or by the
single-item measures proposed in several contexts (e.g.,
Fordyce, 1977). Some researchers, however, have noted that

Validation of the Italian Versions of the
Flourishing Scale and of the Scale of
Positive and Negative Experience

and Corrado Caudek2
Abstract
Researchers are divided between those who consider well-being as a single global construct and those who maintain the
need to keep the hedonic and eudaimonic components of well-being separate. Diener et al. proposed two separate scales for
measuring well-being: the Flourishing Scale (FS) for eudaimonic well-being and the Scale of Positive and Negative Experience
(SPANE) for hedonic well-being. The aim of this article is to validate the Italian versions of the FS and SPANE, and to
provide support for the usefulness of distinct measures of well-being components. In Study 1, we examined an Italian
undergraduate student sample (n = 684), whereas in Study 2 we considered two samples of unemployed (n = 282) and
healthy control individuals (n = 426). Through multigroup confirmatory factor analysis, we demonstrated that the Italian
FS and SPANE obtained strict measurement invariance across administration methods (paper-and-pencil and Internet) and
strong measurement invariance across different groups (unemployed individuals seeking work and a healthy control group).
In our data, we found a superior fit for a two-factor model over a one-factor model of well-being, which suggests the utility of
separate measures of well-being components. Concurrent validity was verified with other well-being, depression, and anxiety
measures. Furthermore, we showed that flourishing is more strongly related to the cognitive component of subjective well-
being than hedonic affect. In summary, the Italian FS and SPANE are reliable and valid instruments, and may be beneficial in
their applications in future Italian studies on well-being.

different components of mental health are affected differ-
ently by life events, thus advocating the need of keeping the
different components of well-being separate, at both the the-
oretical and operational levels (Huta & Ryan, 2010). In fact,
it has been shown that, when constructing self-evaluations,
respondents rely on multiple sources of information and
social standards. Hedonic affect measures encourage respon-
dents to base their evaluations on feelings of pure emotional
pleasantness/unpleasantness; judgments of life satisfaction
(SWB cognitive component), instead, tend to elicit higher
order conscious processes. Likewise, eudaimonic measures
involve cognitive processes beyond affective experience in
evaluating one's positive functioning (Kashdan et al., 2008).
For example, meaning and purpose in life can be influenced
by thoughts about the future (Waytz, Hershfield, & Tamir,
2015). Consistent with these previous findings, the present
study provides evidence that hedonic and eudaimonic well-
being are related but distinct constructs.
Measuring Hedonic Affect
The affect dimensions of SWB are often measured with the
Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson,
Clark, & Tellegen, 1988). Diener et al. (2010), however,
have pointed out that the PANAS has some important limita-
tions, such as the inclusion of adjectives that do not represent
real feelings (e.g., "strong," "alert," "determined," "active")
or that are infrequent (e.g., "inspired"). Moreover, the
PANAS omits some basic feelings ("sad," "depressed"),
whereas others are overrepresented (e.g., "jittery," "ner-
vous," "scared," and "afraid" are all feelings that represent
anxiety). Overall, the PANAS tends to overrepresent states
of high arousal, namely anxiety, for the negative affect, and
enthusiasm for the positive affect; the negative (depression)
and the positive (peace and serenity) counterparts character-
ized by low arousal are absent. This characterization of
hedonic affect can be problematic, especially when applied
to other cultures. In fact, if for North Americans and
Europeans the emotional states characterized by high posi-
tive arousal are desirable, for East Asians low-arousal feel-
ings such as "calm" and "relaxed" are more appreciated
(Tsai, Knutson, & Fung, 2006).
Contrary to the PANAS, the Scale of Positive and Negative
Experience (SPANE) is able to assess the full set of feelings
felt by the respondent, both general and specific (Diener
et al., 2009). Using adjectives with a broad and general sig-
nificance, such as "good," "positive," and "pleasant," the
SPANE includes a wide range of desirable feelings.
Correspondingly, Diener et al. (2010) included general
descriptors with a negative valence such as "bad," "negative,"
and "unpleasant." Specific feelings, both positive ("happy,"
"joyful," "contented") and negative ("sad," "afraid," "angry"),
complete the full range of emotional states. The PANAS asks
respondents to rate each feeling in terms of its intensity,
although the temporal frame seems more strongly related to
well-being than the feeling's intensity (Diener, Colvin, Pavot,
& Allman, 1991). For this reason, the SPANE asks respon-
dents to quantify the amount of time they passed in a particu-
lar feeling in the previous month. Recently, Jovanovi (2015)
showed that the SPANE subscales explain more variance than
the PANAS in life satisfaction, depression, and general
well-being.
Measuring Eudaimonic Well-Being
The eudaimonic theoretical framework is scarcely integrated
because it encompasses the contributions by many authors,
such as the self-determination theory by Ryan and Deci
(2000), the concept of flow by Csikszentmihalyi (1990), and
the concept of psychological well-being by Ryff (1989). In
the eudaimonic tradition, well-being is identified with the
construct of flourishing, which refers to the optimal psycho-
logical functioning of the individual (Keyes, 2002).
After noting the limitations of the existing measurement
instruments, several authors studying flourishing have tried
to identify its underlying dimensions (Diener et al., 2010;
Huppert & So, 2013; Keyes, 2002; Seligman, 2011). For
example, the factorial validity of the Psychological Well-
Being Scales (PWBS; Ryff, 1989) has been questioned
(Springer, Hauser, & Freese, 2006), and some of its items
have been deemed inappropriate descriptors of eudaimonic
well-being (Huta & Ryan, 2010). The conceptualizations
proposed by Seligman (2011) and by Huppert and So (2013),
in fact, spuriously include in the flourishing construct "posi-
tive emotions" dimension that should be measured separately
(Keyes, Shmotkin, & Ryff, 2002).
The Flourishing Scale (FS) developed by Diener et al.
(2010) was aimed at supplementing the existing instruments,
which are too long (e.g., PWBS) or too narrow in scope (e.g.,
Basic Needs Satisfaction Scale [BNSS]; Ryan & Deci, 2000).
The FS provides a brief and comprehensive measure of
flourishing that summarizes the existing dimensions pro-
posed by other authors: meaning and purpose of life (Ryff,
1989; Seligman, 2002), quality of relationships with others
(Deci & Ryan, 2000; Ryff, 1989), engagement with daily
activities (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990), perception of the per-
sonal contribution to the well-being of others (Putnam,
2000), perception of personal competence (Deci & Ryan,
2000; Ryff, 1989), self-acceptance (Ryff, 1989), optimism
(Scheier & Carver, 2003), and being respected (Brown,
Nesse, Vinokur, & Smith, 2003). The FS does not evaluate
each of these single dimensions separately but provides a
general overview of the individual's perception of his or her
own positive functioning.
Purpose of the Study
The present study had two aims: (a) to validate the FS and the
SPANE in an Italian sample, and (b) to test the usefulness of
separate measures of the hedonic and eudaimonic well-being
Giuntoli et al. 3
components. The first aim was addressed by evaluating the
psychometric properties of the Italian FS and SPANE (Study
1). The main reason for conducting this study is the growing
interest in well-being research in Italy (Speroni, 2010) and a
consequent increased need for appropriate measures of well-
being. The second aim was addressed by examining the con-
current validity of hedonic affect and eudaimonic well-being,
and by comparing one-dimensional and two-dimensional
models of well-being. Specifically, we measured the strength
of association between hedonia and eudaimonia (measured
by the SPANE and the FS), on one side, and other measures
of the cognitive component of SWB (Study 1) and two mea-
sures of psychological distress (Beck Anxiety Inventory
[BAI], Beck, Epstein, Brown, & Steer, 1988; Beck Depression
Inventory­II [BDI-II], Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996), on the
other, within a sample of unemployed individuals and within
a control group (Study 2).
Study 1
We evaluated the internal consistency and the factorial valid-
ity of the Italian FS and SPANE. We also examined the fac-
tor-measurement invariance of the two instruments across
paper-and-pencil and Internet data collection methods by
means of multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (MG-CFA)
techniques. In both the paper-and-pencil and Internet sam-
ples, we expected to find a one-factor structure for the Italian
FS and a two-factor structure for the Italian SPANE (Diener
et al., 2010). Once the invariance across the Internet and
paper-and-pencil groups was established, convergent valid-
ity was explored in the combined sample by considering the
correlations between the Italian FS, the Italian SPANE, and
other measures of well-being, such as the Subjective
Happiness Scale (SHS; Lyubomirsky & Lepper, 1999), the
PANAS (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988), the Satisfaction
With Life Scale (SWLS; Diener, Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin,
1985), the Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI; International
Wellbeing Group, 2006), and the Single Global Item (SGI;
International Wellbeing Group, 2006). We expected to find a
strong association between the SPANE-P and the PANAS-P,
and between the SPANE-N and the PANAS-N, because they
all measure positive or negative affect. Furthermore, we
expected a stronger association of the FS compared with the
SPANE scores with measures of the cognitive component of
SWB (SWLS, PWI, SGI), given that eudaimonic well-being
involves cognitive processes beyond affective experience.
Participants
We recruited 466 participants (age 18-40 years, M age = 23.2
years) from introductory undergraduate psychology classes
at the University of Florence, Italy (68.4% females). Average
age was 23.5 years (SD = 3.1) for females and 23.3 years (SD
= 3.6) for males. This sample completed the paper-and-pen-
cil versions of the Italian FS and SPANE. Additional 218
participants completed the Internet-based administrations of
the same tests (169 females). Average age was 23.8 years
(SD = 2.8) for females and 22.9 years (SD = 3.8) for males.
Participation in the study was voluntary, anonymous, and in
compliance with institutional ethical guidelines. All partici-
pants were informed through written instructions about the
anonymity and confidentiality of their data.
Measures
To evaluate the convergent validity of the Italian FS and of
the SPANE, we administered the following instruments.
FS. The FS (Diener et al., 2010) is an eight-item scale mea-
sured on a 7-point Likert-type scale response format, which
focuses on the eudaimonic aspects of well-being (e.g., "I
lead a purposeful and meaningful life," "My social relation-
ships are supportive and rewarding," "I am engaged and
interested in my daily activities"). The total score is calcu-
lated by the sum of the item scores and can range from 8 to
56, with higher scores meaning that the respondent rates
himself or herself as a very positive functioning individual.
SPANE. The SPANE (Diener et al., 2010) is a 12-item self-
report measure made up of two subscales: six items for posi-
tive affect (SPANE-P) and six items for negative affect
(SPANE-N). Positive and negative affect is evaluated over
the past 4 weeks. Respondents rate how often they had expe-
rienced the feelings indicated by each item by means of a
Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (very rarely or never) to 5
(very often or always). Scores of the SPANE-P and SPANE-
N are calculated separately because of the putative indepen-
dence between these two kinds of feelings (Diener et al.,
2010). For each scale, scores can vary from 6 to 30. An over-
all score (SPANE-B), ranging from -24 to 24, is computed
by subtracting the SPANE-N score from the SPANE-P score.
PANAS (trait). The PANAS (Terracciano, McCrae, & Costa,
2003; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) is a 20-item inven-
tory assessing the two primary mood dimensions: positive
affect (PANAS-P) and negative affect (PANAS-N). Both
affective dimensions can be measured either as a state (i.e.,
"How do you feel right now?") or as a trait (i.e., "How do
you generally feel?"). In the present administration, partici-
pants were instructed to assess their feelings "in general." An
affect balance score (PANAS-B) is computed by subtracting
the PANAS-N scores from the PANAS-P scores. The 10
items of the PANAS-N assess unpleasant engagement and
subjective distress (e.g., "afraid," "upset"), whereas the 10
items of the PANAS-P assess positive affect (e.g., "enthusi-
astic," "proud"). Participants rate to what extent they have
generally experienced each emotion on a 5-point scale rang-
ing from 1 (very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely). Total
scores on each subscale range from 10 to 50, with higher
scores indicating high levels of positive or negative affect.
4 SAGE Open
SHS.The SHS (Iani, Lauriola, Layous, & Sirigatti, 2014;
Lyubomirsky & Lepper, 1999) is a four-item scale rated on a
7-point Likert-type scale designed to assess global subjective
happiness. Two items ask respondents to characterize them-
selves based on absolute ratings and ratings relative to peers,
whereas the other two items ask to what extent participants
identify themselves with descriptions of happy and unhappy
individuals. A global score is computed by averaging the
scores for the four items.
SWLS. The SWLS (Diener et al., 1985) is a five-item instru-
ment created to measure the cognitive component of SWB.
Participants respond to each item by indicating on a 7-point
Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7
(strongly agree), their general satisfaction with life accord-
ing to their own criteria. Total scores range from 5 to 25, with
higher scores reflecting greater life satisfaction.
PWI.The PWI (International Wellbeing Group, 2006)
consists of eight items that assess the personal satisfaction
in eight specific life domains: standard of living, health,
achievement in life, personal relationship, personal safety,
community connectedness, future security, and spiritual-
ity religion. Respondents are asked to rate their level of
satisfaction within each domain by a numerical rating
ranging from 0 (extremely dissatisfied) to 10 (extremely
satisfied).
SGI.This item (International Wellbeing Group, 2006) asks
about participants' overall life satisfaction ("Thinking about
your own life and personal circumstances, how satisfied are
you with your life as a whole?"), and it is often administered
with the PWI. Participants respond on a 11-point scale, rang-
ing from 0 (completely dissatisfied) to 10 (completely
satisfied).
Procedure
The authors independently translated the original FS and the
SPANE into Italian and made a synthesis of the four transla-
tions. Next, two native English speakers with a BS degree in
psychology from a U.S. University back-translated the
Italian version into English. This back-translation was then
checked for consistency of meaning with the original English
version. This process was repeated until the back-translation
was found to correspond to the original. Moreover, the Italian
FS and SPANE were judged by other two bilingual transla-
tors to verify the linguistic equivalence with their English
versions. For the FS, the interrater agreement was Kappa =
.72 (p < .05), 95% confidence interval (CI) = [0.191, 1.238],
and for the SPANE, Kappa = .75 (p < .05), 95% CI = [0.281,
1.219]. This last step showed that further item refinement
was unnecessary. The Italian FS and SPANE are reported in
Supplementary Material Appendixes D and E.
Data Analysis
All the analyses were conducted with the software R (R Core
Team, 2016). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was per-
formed with the R-package lavaan (Rosseel, 2012). To deter-
mine the fit of the CFA models, we considered the 2 test
statistic, the comparative fit index (CFI), the Tucker­Lewis
index (TLI), the root mean square error of approximation
(RMSEA), and the standardized root mean square residual
(SRMR). Generally, CFI and TLI values larger than .90 are
taken to indicate acceptable fit, although values greater than
.95 are desirable (Hox, 2010). RMSEA values lower than .05
indicate close fit, values between .05 and .08 indicate accept-
able fit, values between .08 and .10 indicate mediocre fit, and
values greater than .10 indicate poor fit (Browne & Cudeck,
1992). SRMR values range from 0 to 1.0, with well-fitting
models obtaining values smaller than .05 (Byrne, 1998);
however, values as high as .08 are deemed acceptable (Hu &
Bentler, 1999).
We tested measurement invariance using MG-CFA across
administration methods (paper-and-pencil and Internet).
Factorial invariance was tested by comparing a series of
increasingly restrictive models using the R-package sem-
Tools (semTools Contributors, 2015) with progressively
more restrictive hypotheses about equality across groups
(Wu, Li, & Zumbo, 2007).
Configural invariance is the most basic level of measure-
ment invariance, and only requires the same number of fac-
tors and the same overall factor pattern across groups. Weak
invariance adds to the requirements of configural invariance
the constraint of the equality of the factor loadings across
groups. Strong invariance (also referred to as scalar invari-
ance) requires both the factor loadings and the item inter-
cepts to be invariant across groups. Strict invariance adds to
the previous constraints the equality across residuals. These
four levels of increasingly restrictive constraints are defined
by the relationship between the items and the factors (mea-
surement model), and their equality across groups is a neces-
sary condition for measurement invariance.
The 2 test is typically used to compare the fit of two
nested models, with the less parameterized model being
favored when the 2 difference is not statistically significant.
Like the 2 model fit test statistic, however, the 2 test is
sensitive to sample size. Therefore, we followed the practice
of using the CFI criterion, with CFI < .01 being consid-
ered evidence supporting the less parameterized model
(Cheung & Rensvold, 2002).
Results
Descriptive analysis.Descriptive statistics for the FS and
SPANE are shown in Table 1. The assumption of normal
distribution was validated graphically by normal quantile­
quantile (QQ) plots of test scores. Skewness and kurtosis
were within the expected range (Lei & Lomax, 2005).
Giuntoli et al. 5
Internal consistency. Cronbach's alpha was larger than .80 for
all scales, suggesting good internal consistency (Nunnally &
Bernstein, 1994)--see Table 1. Item-total correlations were
similar for all items (FS: .57-.73 range; SPANE-P: .66-.79
range; SPANE-N: .51-.74 range). The deletion of any single
item did not appreciably decrease Cronbach's alpha (FS: .85-
.87 range; SPANE-P: .88-.90 range; SPANE-N: .82-.86
range) (Supplementary Material Appendix A, Table S1).
CFAs for FS and SPANE scores. In the Italian sample, we repli-
cated the factor solutions reported by Diener et al. (2010).
The one-factor solution for the FS provides an adequate fit in
both samples according to the 2/df, CFI, TLI, SRMR, and
RMSEA criteria (Table 2). All items loaded on the latent fac-
tor in high degree from .60 to .80 for the paper-and-pencil
administration, and from .64 to .81 for the Internet adminis-
tration. Also, the two-factor solution for the SPANE had an
acceptable fit in both samples. All the factor loadings were
statistically significant (p < .001), ranging from .55 to .86 for
the paper-and-pencil administration, and from .54 to .85 for
the Internet administration. Correlations between the two
latent dimensions were high in both the paper-and-pencil (r
= -.71) and Internet (r = -.77) administrations.
Measurement invariance. Configural, weak, strong, and strict
invariance models produced acceptable fit indices (CFI =
.936-.942, RMSEA = .082-.099). In terms of the CFI < .01
criterion, we found no deterioration of fit with the constraints
of configural, weak, strong, and strict invariance models
(Table 3). Therefore, we conclude that the Italian FS and
SPANE obtained strict invariance across the paper-and-pen-
cil and Internet administration methods.
Combined sample. Aone-way MANOVAassessed the admin-
istration method differences for the FS, SPANE-P, and
SPANE-N scores. The combined dependent variables were
not significantly affected by the method of administration,
Pillai's trace = 0.0005, F(3, 680) = 0.12, p = .9480. No differ-
ences between the administration methods were observed
when separate t tests were performed on the FS, SPANE-P,
and SPANE-N scores. Therefore, in the following analyses,
the two samples were combined. For the total sample, the
average FS score was 38.7 (with average item scores ranging
from 4.19 to 5.44). The average SPANE-P score was 19.68
(with average item scores ranging from 2.96 to 3.54). The
average SPANE-N score was 15.27 (with average item scores
ranging from 2.27 to 2.79).
Comparison of one- and two-factor models of well-being. To test
the usefulness of separate measures for hedonic and eudai-
monic well-being, we compared two confirmatory factor
models of well-being by considering the correlations between
the items of the SPANE and the FS. The two-factor model

2 difference test, the two-factor model fared better than the
one-factor model, 2(1) = 681.31, p < .001 (Supplementary
Material Appendix B, Table S2).
Concurrent validity. Concurrent validity was tested by examin-
ing the correlations between the FS and SPANE scores, on
one side (Table 4), and the scores of the scales reported in
Table 5, on the other. The correlations between the FS and the
SPANE-Pscores (r = .69) and between the FS and the SPANE-
N scores (r = -.48) were medium­high. On average, the cor-
relations between the FS and the SPANE scores, on one side,
and the SHS, the PANAS, the SWLS, the PWI, and the SGI
scores, on the other, were high, thus suggesting a high concur-
rent validity. A series of Steiger's (1980) z tests (Steiger's
modification of Dunn & Clark's, 1969) were performed to
test for differences in the magnitude of the correlations
between the FS and the SPANE-P, and the measures of cogni-
tive components of SWB (SWLS, PWI, SGI). The correlation
between the SWLS and the FS was significantly stronger than
the correlation between the SWLS and the SPANE-P, z =
4.70, p < .0001. The correlation between the PWI and the FS
was significantly stronger than the correlation between the
PWI and the SPANE-P, z = 4.15, p < .0001. The correlation
between the SGI and the FS was not significantly stronger
than the correlation between the SGI and the SPANE-P, z =
1.41, p = .1581. In summary, the FS shows a stronger associa-
tion than the SPANE-P with the cognitive components of
well-being (SWLS, PWI, SGI).
Discussion
The Italian FS and SPANE showed good reliability and valid-
ity. Internal consistency and factor analysis indicated a unidi-
mensional structure for the Italian FS and a two-factor
structure for the Italian SPANE. The Italian FS and the
SPANE exhibited medium­high positive correlations with
other SWB measures and with measures of related constructs,

thus displaying good convergent validity. The stronger cor-
relation was between SPANE-N and PANAS-N. However,
contrary to our expectations, the SPANE-P was more strongly
associated with the SWLS, the SHS, and the SGI, compared
with the PANAS-P. This finding could be explained by the
different conceptualization of the positive affect adopted by
the SPANE-P and the PANAS-P, as indicated in the
"Measuring Hedonic Affect" section. Both the FS and the
SPANE were strongly associated with life satisfaction.
However, the FS showed a stronger association with the cog-
nitive components of SWB than with the SPANE-P, thus sug-
gesting that eudaimonic well-being involves affective
information on a less explicit level compared with the SPANE.
Psychological research data collection has recently moved
into the realm of the Internet, and self-report survey-based
data collection is increasingly carried out using the Internet,
as opposed to the traditional paper-and-pencil method. It is
therefore important to determine the adequacy of the Internet-
based data collection for the measurement instruments under
examination. Our results provide evidence of strict measure-
ment invariance across paper-and-pencil and Internet data
collection procedures. We thus conclude that the Italian FS
and SPANE can be administered through the Internet with
good (i.e., equivalent to paper-and-pencil) results.
Study 2
Study 2 assessed the discriminant and nomological validity
of the hedonia and eudaimonia constructs. After controlling
for the effect of the unemployed participants' age, we exam-
ined a sample of unemployed individuals and a healthy con-
trol group. We performed CFAs for both the groups, and we
tested metric invariance (i.e., invariance across individual
factor loadings). Furthermore, the one-dimensional and the
two-dimensional models of well-being were tested. Finally,
we analyzed the discriminant validity of the FS and the
SPANE by considering the BDI-II and the BAI scales.
Work is not only a means of economic sustenance, but it
also contributes to the definition of the self-image and to the
constructionofmeaninginone'slife(Iacovides,Fountoulakis,
Kaprinis, & Kaprinis, 2003). These latter two dimensions are
important in the flourishing conceptualization and, therefore,
we expected lower FS scores in the unemployed group than
in the control group. Moreover, as unemployment has nega-
tive effects on well-being (e.g., A. E. Clark, Layard, & Senik,
2012), and because it increases the risk of hopelessness
(Haatainen et al., 2003) and depression (Wanberg, 2012), we
expected the mean SPANE-P, SPANE-N, BDI-II, and BAI
scores to differ markedly between the unemployed partici-
pants and the control group. We also expected the BAI and
BDI-II scores to be negatively associated with the FS and
SPANE-P scores, because they represent the opposite poles
of the mental health continuum, and to be positively associ-
ated with the SPANE-N scores, because their emotional neg-
ative content is in part overlapping (e.g., the "sad" and
"afraid" items of the SPANE-N). In line with previous stud-
ies (Tellegen, 1985; Watson, Clark, & Carey, 1988), we
expected a weaker association between the BAI scores and
well-being than between the BDI-II scores and well-being.
Participants
The unemployed sample consisted of 282 participants (183
females), unemployed for at least 6 months and actively
seeking work.
The unemployed sample was divided into two subgroups:
young unemployed adults (age  35) and older unemployed
adults (age > 35). The threshold of 35 years was suggested
by the Italian Institute of Statistics (ISTAT; Istituto Nazionale
di Statistica) classification of unemployment ages. This
unusually high threshold is justified by the particular Italian
situation, in which 62.3% of individuals aged between 18
and 34 years still live with their family of origin, given an
unemployment rate of 17.1% for this age group in 2011
(ISTAT, 2012). The young unemployed adults sample con-
sisted of 222 participants (141 females) aged between 19 and
34 years (M = 26.34, SD = 3.73). The older unemployed
adults sample consisted of 60 participants (43 females) aged
between 35 and 59 years (M = 42.67, SD = 6.62). The control
group consisted of 426 participants (331 females) with dif-
ferent working conditions: employees (50.7%), students
(39.9%), retired (1.9%), people not seeking a job (1.9%), and
unspecified condition (5.6%). Average age was 31.2 years
(SD = 11.4) for females and 32.2 years (SD = 12.4) for males.
Participants were recruited online via social networking
websites and through email requests. All participants were
informed through written instructions about the anonymity
and confidentiality of their data.
Measures
To evaluate the divergent validity of the Italian FS and
SPANE, we administered the following instruments.
BDI-II. The BDI-II (Beck et al., 1996; Sica & Ghisi, 2007) is
a 21-item, self-rated scale that evaluates key symptoms of
depression, including cognitive, emotional, and somatic
aspects. Individual scale items are scored on a 4-point con-
tinuum (0 = least, 3 = most), with a total summed score range
of 0 to 63. Higher scores indicate greater depressive severity.
Suggested guidelines for cutoff scores are less than 14 for no
or minimal depression, 14 to 19 for mild to moderate depres-
sion, 20 to 28 for moderate depression, and 29 or higher for
severe depression.
BAI. The BAI (Beck et al., 1988; Sica & Ghisi, 2007) con-
tains 21 items, each describing a symptom of anxiety.
Respondents rate on a 4-point scale how much they have
been bothered by the symptoms. Total score ranges between
0 and 63. Higher total score reflects increased symptoms of

Results
Descriptive analysis.Descriptive statistics for the Italian FS
and SPANE in the two unemployed samples and in the con-
trol group are shown in Table 6. Skewness and kurtosis were
within the expected range (Lei & Lomax, 2005).
Evaluating group differences.A series of one-way ANOVAs
assessed the group (young unemployed adults, older unem-
ployed adults, control group) differences for the FS, the
SPANE-P, and the SPANE-N scores. There was a signifi-
cant effect of group on the FS scores, F(2, 705) = 38.60, p
< .0001 (2 = .10). Post hoc Tukey's honestly significant
difference (HSD) tests (p < .05) indicated lower FS mean
score for both the young unemployed adults (M = 33.50, SD
= 10.70) and the older unemployed adults (M = 32.55, SD =
10.88), as compared with the control group (M = 40.14, SD
= 9.79). The young and older unemployed groups did not
differ significantly on their FS scores. The three groups dif-
fered on their SPANE-P mean scores, F(2, 705) = 60.32, p
< .0001 (2 = .15): The mean SPANE-P scores for the young
unemployed adults (M = 15.98, SD = 5.58) and for the older
unemployed adults (M = 15.32, SD = 4.67) were signifi-
cantly lower than those for the control group (M = 20.27,
SD = 5.17), but the young and older unemployed adult
groups did not differ significantly from each other. A simi-
lar result was found for the SPANE-N scores, F(2, 705) =
48.53, p < .0001 (2 = .21). The mean scores for the young
unemployed adults (M = 19.82, SD = 5.10) and for the older
unemployed adults (M = 20.22, SD = 4.60) were signifi-
cantly lower than those for the control group (M = 15.02,
SD = 4.48), but the young and older unemployed adult
groups did not differ significantly from each other. Given
that we found no differences between young and older
unemployed adults, the subsequent analyses were per-
formed without distinguishing between them.
CFAs for FS and SPANE scores. The one-factor solution for the
FS had acceptable fit indices (Table 7). All items loaded on
the latent factor (p < .001), and loadings ranged from .68

to .89. The two-factor solution for the SPANE also had
acceptable fit indices. The standardized factor loadings were
all statistically significant (p < .001) and ranged from .462 to
.906. Correlations between the two latent dimensions were
medium­high: r = -.66 (unemployed sample) and r = -.60
(control group).
Measurement invariance. Configural, weak, strong, and strict
invariance models produced acceptable fit indices (CFI =
.951-.970, RMSEA = .085-.094). In terms of the CFI < .01
criterion, we found no deterioration of fit with the constraints
of configural, weak, and strong invariance models (Table 8).
Therefore, we conclude that the Italian FS and SPANE obtain
strong invariance across the unemployed (n = 282) and the
control (n = 426) groups.
Comparison of one- and two-factor models of well-being.We
replicated the model comparison analysis of Study 1 across
the unemployed and control groups (Supplementary Material
Appendix C, Table S3). Despite the overall poor fit of both
the one-factor (CFI = .664, TLI = .602, RMSEA = .167,
SRMR = .126) and the two-factor models (CFI = .844, TLI =
.825, RMSEA = .110, SRMR = .090), the latter demonstrated
a far superior fit, 2(2) = 1,883.5, p < .001.
Discriminant validity. Table 9 shows the correlation between
the FS, the SPANE-P, the SPANE-N, the BAI, and the BDI-
II scores calculated on the full sample of unemployed and
control groups (n = 708). Differences in the magnitude of
the correlations between the well-being measures (FS and
SPANE) and the anxiety and depression measures (BAI and
BDI-II) were evaluated by Steiger's z tests. The correlation
between the FS and the BDI-II was significantly stronger
than the correlation between the FS and the BAI, z = -9.06,
p < .0001. The correlation between the SPANE-P and
the BDI-II was significantly stronger than the correlation
between the SPANE-P and the BAI, z = -9.14, p < .0001.
The correlation between the SPANE-N and the BDI-II was
significantly stronger than the correlation between the
SPANE-N and the BAI, z = 4.94, p < .0001.
Discussion
In study 2, we considered a group of unemployed individuals
and a control group comprised (for the most part) of employ-
ees and students. Because we found no statistically signifi-
cant differences between the young unemployed adults and
the older unemployed adult groups, here we only present the
comparisons between the full sample of unemployed indi-
viduals and the control group. The unemployed participants
showed lower scores than the control group on the FS (2 =
.10), the SPANE-P (2 = .15), and the SPANE-N (2 = .21).
For both the unemployed sample and the control group, the
Italian FS and the SPANE obtained strong measurement
invariance in terms of the CFI < .01 criterion. This result
provides further evidence of the FS and the SPANE validity,
establishing that they measure the same constructs in differ-
ent populations.

The association between the SPANE-N and the BAI was
significantly lower than the association between the
SPANE-N and the BDI-II. The same pattern of correlations
was observed for the SPANE-P, which was more strongly
associated with BDI-II than with BAI scores. A similar result
was also found by Sumi (2014) in the Japanese validation of
the SPANE and by other studies comparing the associations
among BAI, BDI-II, and PANAS (Ahrens & Haaga, 1993;
Watson & Kendall, 1989).
The FS was more strongly (negatively) associated with
the BDI-II than with the BAI scores. A possible interpreta-
tion of this result can be provided by the different cognitive
contents of anxiety and depression (D. A. Clark, Beck, &
Stewart, 1990). Anxious cognitive content is focused on
physical or psychological threats, whereas depressive cog-
nitive content refers to thoughts related to negative self-
evaluation, hopelessness, and pessimistic view of the world.
The cognitive content of depression (more than the cogni-
tive content of anxiety) may thus be considered to be the
negative counterpart of flourishing, which is based on posi-
tive self-evaluation, optimistic view on the future, and gen-
eral positive view of the life.
General Discussion
It has recently been proposed that the experience of posi-
tive emotional states (hedonia) and the meaning and devel-
opment of one's potentials (eudaimonia) represent a single
well-being construct, rather than two related dimensions
(Disabato et al., 2016). However, our results do not support
this conclusion. CFAs revealed two correlated factors rather
than a single well-being construct. Moreover, the FS
showed stronger correlations with measures of the cogni-
tive components of SWB compared with the SPANE-P.
These results also suggest the distinct placement of the con-
structs of hedonia and eudaimonia in a nomological net-
work of related constructs (Cronbach & Meehl, 1955) and
support their concurrent validity.
The previous considerations highlight the importance of
validating the translations of the FS and SPANE in differ-
ent national languages. In this respect, our results indicate
that the Italian FS and the Italian SPANE have adequate
psychometric properties. The FS showed a unidimensional
factor structure, whereas the SPANE showed a two-factor
structure. Both scales revealed good levels of internal con-
sistency, homogeneity, and validity. Convergent validity of
the Italian FS and SPANE was also well supported. This is
the first study, to our knowledge, that has examined the
problem of measurement invariance for the FS and for the
SPANE. MG-CFA indicated that the Italian FS and SPANE
obtained strict measurement invariance across administra-
tion methods (paper-and-pencil and Internet) and strong
measurement invariance across groups (unemployed indi-
viduals seeking work and control group). Such evidence of
measurement invariance thus supports the possibility of
valid inferences concerning the FS and SPANE scores
across different administration methods and heterogeneous
social groups.
We acknowledge some limitations of the current study.
First, test­retest reliabilities of the Italian FS and SPANE
have not been assessed. Second, in the assessment of con-
current validity of Study 1 we did not consider the eudai-
monic dimensions of well-being. The association between
the Italian FS and SPANE with other dimensions of well-
being thus remains a task for future research. Third, mea-
surement invariance for the paper-and-pencil and Internet
administration methods of the Italian FS and SPANE might
be inflated by the fact that most of the participants were
college students or young adults used to interact with the
Internet. Fourth, in Study 2 the cognitive component of
hedonic well-being was not assessed, given that we were
only interested in measuring FS and SPANE scores among
unemployed individuals to evaluate the discriminant valid-
ity with the BAI and BDI-II scores. From this point of
view, our results corroborate the outcomes of previous
studies (e.g., Ahrens & Haaga, 1993; Watson & Kendall,
1989). Fifth, the Italian translations of the PWI and the
SGI were only validated as part of a more comprehensive
study on the role of cognitive variables in psychological
disorders (Sica, Caudek, Chiri, Ghisi, & Marchetti, 2012).
Sixth, although we found a superior fit for the two-factor
model over the one-factor model of well-being, we
acknowledge that even the two-factor model does not fit
the data well. Therefore, more research on the factor struc-
tures of the FS and SPANE is required. However, we
believe that the present work provides a valuable starting
point for an improved assessment of well-being in the
Italian language. Finally, in Study 2 we were not able to
collect potentially useful information, such as the length of
time of unemployment or the distinction between individu-
als who were unemployed because they were looking for
their first job and individuals who were unemployed
because they lost their job or were laid off.
In conclusion, hedonic and eudaimonic motives are both
important for the individual well-being. Whereas eudai-
monic motives favor individual growth and meaning con-
struction, hedonic motives foster emotional regulation
(Huta & Ryan, 2010). An assessment of personal well-being
in all its scope thus requires the consideration of both these
dimensions.
