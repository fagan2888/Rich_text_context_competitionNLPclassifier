Introduction
Theory development should be the overall purpose when
conducting qualitative nursing research (Bunkers, 2012).
Eriksson (2010b) points to the paradigmatic shift in the
1970s, toward the development of nursing knowledge and
caring science based on a human science way of thinking.
The humanistic-oriented thinking gave caring science a new
significance in the search for the core of caring, and fostered
the development of fundamental concepts and theory to
bring to light knowledge that may help the patients in an
increasingly complex world (Eriksson, 2002, 2010a).
Concepts are essential elements of theories that describe a
part of the reality (Eriksson, 2010a). Through concepts, the
theoretical structures of nursing may become visible, and
this knowledge may as well guide observations and nursing
actions in practice (King, 1988).
According to Meleis (1992), nursing theory development
is important and may contribute with knowledge that is rel-
evant for many health care professions. Within caring sci-
ence, knowledge development is of significance to all
personnel involved in caring for the patients and their next of
kin. However, nursing theory development should be elabo-
rated within the structure of an explicit framework (Cody,
1999). The theoretical basis for our research is the humanis-
tic tradition of caring science and the caritative caring theory
of Eriksson (Lindström, Lindholm, & Zetterlund, 2010). In
caring science, the human being is viewed as an indivisible
entity of body, mind, and spirit (Eriksson, 2002). It is essen-
tial in caring to include the spiritual dimension so that the
patient may feel whole as a human being, and this may be
viewed as a premise for dignity and health (Eriksson, 2002;
Lindström et al., 2010). The basic motive for caring is cari-
tas, and caring implies alleviation of suffering in charity,
love, faith, and hope (Lindström et al., 2010). As stated by
Råholm and Lindholm (1999), caritative caring ethics means
being there and confirming the patients' dignity, which is
seen as a manifestation of the love that "just exists."
This study focuses on spirituality, and there is compelling
evidence supporting spiritual care as a force in health and
well-being (Becker, 2009; Pesut & Sawatzky, 2006).
Although the concept of spirituality and the provision of
spiritual care are recognized as fundamental aspects of nurs-
ing care, it is however challenging to incorporate spiritual
care into clinical practice (Carr, 2010; Cone & Giske, 2013;
McSherry & Jamieson, 2013; Pesut, 2012). We suggest that
the perspective from which spirituality is investigated is of
importance (Florczak, 2010). Earlier research in light of car-
ing science found Love in connectedness to be a core cate-
gory in spirituality (Rykkje, Eriksson, & Råholm, 2011).
Love in connectedness concerns the presence of a
transcendent or universal love, which can be viewed as a

Love in Connectedness: A Theoretical
Study
Linda Rykkje1,2, Katie Eriksson1, and Maj-Britt Råholm3
Abstract
Spirituality is important when caring for the whole human being. Earlier research found Love in connectedness to be a core
category in spirituality. The study aim is to deepen our understanding of Love in connectedness, and contribute to the theoretical
knowledge development of the concept of spirituality from a caring science perspective. The method was a review of 20
research articles concerning connectedness and love, which were interpreted through a Gadamerian-based hermeneutical
approach. Emerging themes were three forms of connectedness, compassion, and the risk of losing love in caring for the
patient. In addition, we reflected on love and ethics, based on the writings of Tillich. According to Tillich, love is a drive
toward unity of the separated. This drive can be seen in both connectedness with others, in connectedness with something larger
than oneself, and may indirectly apply to connectedness with oneself. We find that both connectedness and love are key concepts
in caring for the patient.

power and a potential health resource. Love is a motivator
and the "glue" that enables human beings to form durable
connections with their inner space, others, community,
Higher Powers, and nature. Love in connectedness motivates
spiritual thoughts and actions, and provides inner strength.
Universal love is present in caring relationships and concrete
caring acts, presented by phenomena of both receiving and
giving love. Inherent in love is compassion, concern, being
seen, and being confirmed (Rykkje et al., 2011).
The study aim is to deepen our understanding of Love in
connectedness, and thereby to contribute to the theoretical
knowledge development of the concept of spirituality from a
caring science perspective.
Method
There are different ways to contribute to theory develop-
ment, and the development of qualitatively derived concepts
and theories is challenging (Morse, Hupcey, Penrod, &
Mitcham, 2002). We chose to perform a review of research
articles pertaining to care, and to explore connectedness and
love separately. Reviews may be the basis of theory develop-
ment because of the potential to integrate research findings
into broader theoretical accounts of the investigated topic
(Kirkevold, 1997). To deepen the understanding of Love in
connectedness, we chose also to reflect on some philosophi-
cal issues regarding love and ethics, based on the writings of
the theologian and philosopher Tillich.
Selecting Literature
Searches in CINAHL and Medline were conducted during
March­September 2013, and some articles were found by
exploring cited references. Inclusion criteria were as follows:
(a) Connectedness or love was found in the abstract or was
central in the article, and (b) the theoretical perspective of the
article was relevant to caring science, and our research aim.
After reading the abstracts, 17 and 23 articles about connect-
edness and love, respectively, were selected for further read-
ing. Nine articles about connectedness and 11 articles about
love were found to be the most relevant, and thus included in
the final analysis. Table 1 presents an overview of the
articles.
Interpretation
With the purpose of gaining a deeper insight into the meaning
of connectedness and love in relation to caring science, the
articles were interpreted through a Gadamerian-based herme-
neutical approach. According to Gadamer (2004), under-
standing is always interpretation, and involves applying the
text to be understood to the interpreter's present situation.
Thus, to support the trustworthiness of the analysis, it was
important to clarify the study's horizon of understanding and
the theoretical framework from the start. The hermeneutical
reading was a search for meaning through the dialectic
movement of interpretation and understanding of the parts in
relation to the whole, and the chosen theoretical framework
(Eriksson & Lindström, 2007). Then, the essential features
of the text were placed into preliminary themes. In this pro-
cess, the first author drafted the preliminary findings, and the
interpretation was then commented on by the co-authors in
several rounds of dialogues. The major themes that emerged
were three basic forms of connectedness, compassion, and
the risk of losing love in caring for the patient.
We find, in agreement with Gadamer, that there cannot be
an understanding free of all prejudice. Hermeneutical read-
ing and interpretation involve application, "so that a person
reading a text is himself part of the meaning he apprehends"
(Gadamer, 2004, p. 335). Therefore, it was important for us
to reflect the main findings against the study's theoretical
horizon.
Findings and Reflections
First, we portray findings regarding connectedness and love
through reflective summaries, and then we reflect on the
findings in light of Tillich's view of love. In addition, we
reflect on how Love in connectedness may deepen our under-
standing of human spirituality, in relation to patient care.
Connectedness
The selected articles portray connectedness as a concept of
great significance inherent in human spirituality. Burkhardt
(1994) describes spirituality as a unifying force permeating
all of life, a force expressed in one's being, in one's knowing,
and in one's doing, and manifested through one's becoming
and connecting. Register and Herman (2010) portray being
spiritually connected as one major category of connected-
ness, whereas Pesut (2008) claims that connectedness is an
important aspect of spirituality. Bellingham, Cohen, Jones,
and Spaniol (1989) point out that connectedness and spiritual
health are vitally and integrally related.
Connectedness is described by Register and Herman
(2010) as an ultimate expression of human existence that
comes from within and determines how people engage in the
world. Furthermore, connectedness concerns the growth
through and toward relationships, both inside and beyond
oneself, and may be understood as the extent to which a
human being experiences shared and meaningful relation-
ship, and engage life in meaningful, positive, and purposeful
ways (Bellingham et al., 1989; Burkhardt, 1994; Register &
Scharer, 2010). Connectedness is also a central feature in the
concept of self-transcendence, as found in human develop-
ment or maturity based on enhanced awareness of the world
around us, and an orientation toward broader perspectives
about life. Teixera (2008) views the essence of self-transcen-
dence as the capacity to connect with self, others, the uni-
verse, and beyond. Self-transcendence may foster peace,

finding purpose and meaning in life, and a sense of being
healed.
We found three basic forms of connectedness: connected-
ness with oneself, connectedness with others, and connected-
ness to something larger than oneself.
Connectedness with oneself.Connectedness is being at one
with self (Younger, 1995). It is both a reflection and inner
strength, and a sense of connection with oneself, which
include the essence of one's being, one's knowing, and one's
doing (Burkhardt, 1994). On the concrete level, it might also
apply to being connected biologically to ones'physical body,
and perception of health and well-being (Register & Her-
man, 2010). Being connected with oneself means living a life
that fits with or is in congruence with one's feelings and val-
ues (Bellingham et al., 1989). Losing connectedness with

oneself may result in self-alienation, which is linked to cul-
tural norms of "going it alone" that may lead to increased
isolation. One example is from the American society: The
more persons fulfill their commitment to individualism,
competition, and independence, the more they become dis-
connected, bored, and lonely (Bellingham et al., 1989). We
reflect on the importance of being in balance and in touch
with one's inner space as human beings, and if not, the self-
alienation can be experienced as spiritual suffering.
Younger's (1995) starting point is that suffering affects an
individual's sense of community and connectedness with
others. Transcendence is considered the most powerful way
in which human beings are restored to connectedness and
wholeness after an injury. Suffering may bring closer a
transpersonal source of meaning, which locates the human
being in a far larger landscape (Younger, 1995). Our reflec-
tion is that suffering may be the result of losing connected-
ness with oneself; however, there are many forms of
suffering. Other research support that suffering may trigger
spiritual awakening or a search for the greater answers in
life, which may lead to peacefulness (Råholm & Eriksson,
2001; Sivonen, 2000).
The reestablishing of connectedness may include soli-
tude. Furthermore, Younger (1995) refers to Tillich, stating
that estrangement is part of life and the step immediately pre-
ceding connectedness is solitude. Solitude is being alone but
not lonely, sensing the eternal presence that includes every-
body and everything from which we are separated. Just being
with oneself gives opportunities of thoughtfulness, creativ-
ity, and rest. Sources of solitude can be nature, poetry, music,
or pictures (Younger, 1995). Solitude can easily become
loneliness if it obscures connectedness. However, solitude or
disconnectedness does not equate loneliness, because loneli-
ness implies a longing or anxious, painful yearning for some-
one or something (Bellingham et al., 1989). We reflect on
that the process of finding meaning is somewhat a lonely
journey, meaning that the person's inner search requires
"quiet moments" in solitude (Råholm & Eriksson, 2001).
Solitude as a means for spiritual search should not be mis-
taken as loneliness.
Connectedness with others.Connectedness with others may
include loved ones, particularly family, friends, or acquain-
tances, as well as the society or culture (Bellingham et al.,
1989; Burkhardt, 1994; Predeger & Mumma, 2004; Register
& Herman, 2010; Register & Scharer, 2010). Connectedness
is a sense of membership and belonging in the human com-
munity, of recognizing unity between self and others, that is,
a sense of being part of a group, a country, or even the world
(Younger, 1995). Being connected with others necessitates
creating a space that people can visit and a willingness to
come out of that space to visit others (Bellingham et al.,
1989).
Phillips-Salimi, Haase, and Kooken (2012) aimed to clar-
ify the concept of connectedness in social relationships.
Attributes of connectedness are caring, being affectionate
toward others, experiencing warmth from others, and dis-
playing concern for the well-being of others. Respect, feeling
valued, and/or displaying value for others are also important
attributes. Connectedness also implies reciprocity, mutual
affection, and interest that people have in one another. Based
on these attributes, connectedness is the degree to which a
person perceives that he or she has a close, intimate, mean-
ingful, and significant relationship with another person or
group of people. This perception is characterized by positive
expressions that are both received and reciprocated, either by
the person or between people, through affective and consis-
tent social interactions (Phillips-Salimi et al., 2012). Our
reflection is that connectedness with others is expressed
through caring acts of both receiving and giving, and such
connectedness can contribute to confirm the individuals'
worth (Råholm & Eriksson, 2001).
Connectedness with something larger than oneself.Connected-
ness is being at one with timelessness and a sense of being in
touch with the eternal, of being a part of something that is
greater than oneself (Younger, 1995). It can be connected-
ness with the environment (Register & Herman, 2010; Teix-
era, 2008), the nature (Burkhardt, 1994; Pesut, 2008;
Predeger & Mumma, 2004), or the universe (Teixera, 2008).
It can also be connectedness with a larger meaning or pur-
pose, that is, an Ultimate Other--God or Higher Power/
Being (Bellingham et al., 1989; Burkhardt, 1994; Teixera,
2008) or with a power or divine being that does not need to
be limited to God, or a universal consciousness (Pesut, 2008;
Register & Herman, 2010). Being connected to something
larger than oneself or one's surroundings is perceived as a
basic human need and necessitates having a profound pur-
pose in life. Purpose can be equated to meaning, direction,
mission, or duty; it is a person's larger goal (Bellingham et
al., 1989).
Bellingham et al. (1989) believe that emptiness and mean-
inglessness may result in anxiety. These authors refer to
Tillich who relates anxiety to the loss of an ultimate concern,
of a meaning, which gives meaning to all meanings. This
anxiety is aroused by the loss of a spiritual center, and of
answers to the question of the meaning of existence. Being
connected to something larger requires being an active par-
ticipant in the creative aspects of life. Losing connectedness
with one's guiding principles may bring feelings of perva-
sive dread or boredom (Bellingham et al., 1989). Thus, we
reflect on that loosing connectedness with a larger meaning
may result in spiritual suffering.
Love
During the hermeneutical interpretation of the articles, we
found love as a key concept in caring for the patient.
However, there are many forms of love and different under-
standings of this concept. In the English language, love is
Rykkje et al. 7
often misunderstood as sexual desire, whereas the classical
Greek language distinguishes between the love that is Eros
and that of Agape. Moreover, the word charity, which
describes both the state of and the manifestation of love
through caring for another, is often reduced in contemporary
notions to organizational activities (Stickley & Freshwater,
2002). In this article, we focus on Eriksson's notion of cari-
tas, which means human love, compassion, and charity, man-
ifested through caring for others (Lindström et al., 2010).
Based on the emerging themes from the selected articles, we
center our reflections on compassion and the risk of losing
love in caring for the patient. In addition, we reflect on love
and ethics based on the writings of Tillich.
Compassion. Love in the form of compassion for the suffer-
ing human being is an idea that has shaped caring for hun-
dreds of years (Thorkildsen, Eriksson, & Råholm, 2013).
Von Dietze and Orb (2000) claim that the English word com-
passion has been used since the 14th century, and is derived
from the Latin com (together with) and pati (to suffer), liter-
ary to suffer with. They find that although compassion may
contain or require emotion, it also holds the notion of delib-
erate altruistic participation in another person's suffering.
Hence, our reflection is that compassionate care is quite rel-
evant in relation to connectedness with others.
Compassion embraces more than emotions, and concerns
the ways we relate to other people and demands that we act
(Von Dietze & Orb, 2000). The nature of compassion sug-
gests that caregivers are able to provide attentiveness, listen-
ing, confronting, involvement, helping, presence, and
understanding in relations with patients (van der Cingel,
2011). Von Dietze and Orb point out that empathy can put a
distance between the nurse and the patient, whereas compas-
sion implies that there is a deeper level of participation in the
suffering of the other. Compassion deliberately seeks to
avoid paternalistic care and is not to be misunderstood as
pity (Von Dietze & Orb, 2000). Although both pity and com-
passion are used to refer to an emotion that indicates a feel-
ing of being sorry, feeling sorry in pity victimizes a patient
and evokes powerlessness (van der Cingel, 2011). Von Dietze
and Orb (2000) states that compassionate care is not "sim-
plistically about taking away another person's pain or suffer-
ing, but is about entering into that person's experience so as
to share their burden in solidarity with them and hence
enabling them to retain their independence and dignity" (p.
169). Compassion may represent an internalized motivation
for doing good, which impels and empowers people to not
only acknowledge but also act toward alleviating another
human being's suffering or pain (Schantz, 2007). Love is an
ethical act, and compassion is a mutual experience given two
or more people who act together for its realization
(Thorkildsen et al., 2013). We assume that compassion is a
prerequisite for experiencing connectedness with others, not
only in caring relations but also in all meaningful relation-
ships between human beings.
The risk of losing love. Several authors are concerned about
how love seemingly has lean times in patient care. The arti-
cles point to how love or compassion in some contexts may
sound threatening and unprofessional, and that to care with
love has been considered subservient and of inferior value in
caring for the patient, a weakness, or even a taboo subject
(Arman & Rehnsfeldt, 2006; Stickley & Freshwater, 2002;
Von Dietze & Orb, 2000; Wahlin, Wieslander, & Fridlund,
1995). Western-style health care systems are critiqued for
limiting professional caring and loving possibilities, leaving
caregivers who love in the practice of caring to go beyond
the role definition of the duty of care (Fitzgerald & van
Hooft, 2000). Consequently, the lack of love is causing the
intuitive and natural part of life to get lost. Altruistically
motivated caregivers are said to take responsibility and being
supportive because they feel love, concern, and responsibil-
ity for the other person (Sand, Olsson, & Strang, 2010).
However, the innocent altruism and desire to genuinely care
for people in need are challenged by the attitudes of perhaps
more cynical colleagues and governments requesting patient
involvement without providing adequate resources. Love is
discrete and modest, appreciated in the silence of a genuinely
caring relationship. This means that rewards of loving are
invisible, and nurses may even fear reprisals for demonstra-
tion of love (Stickley & Freshwater, 2002).
Straughair (2012) claims that today, in the profession of
nursing, some of the ethos of the compassionate nursing
character is seemingly lost in favor of technical skills based
too heavily on evidence-based practice. The religious origin
of compassion, since Nightingale formed her ideals for the
professional nurse, has been challenged in contemporary
health care. This is supported by evidence suggesting that
nurses have a decreased affinity with the ethos of altruism
and reports from patients who experience lack of compas-
sionate nursing care. According to Straughair (2012), there
are forces to reendorse the concept of compassion as a core
and fundamental nursing value, and restore the image of the
nurse who responds to patients with humanity and kindness
through high-quality compassionate care.
Wahlin et al. (1995) observe that the primary cause for
pain and distress is a lack of love, and that the path of coming
to wholeness and healing is the ability to accept and give
unconditional love. Where caregivers are genuinely con-
cerned for the whole person, love is evident and the prospect
for healing increases (Stickley & Freshwater, 2002). Arman
and Rehnsfeldt (2006) argue that the offering of unselfish
loving care to someone explicates the core of the character of
human beings. The ability to care originates in man's natural
behavior and encompasses the appreciation of both the giv-
ing and the receiving of loving care. The mediating force of
love has an ability to make connections, heal, and make
whole (Arman & Rehnsfeldt, 2006). Love as fundamental
for a being brings human beings in touch with themselves
and enables binding to other people (Thorkildsen et al.,
2013). Hence, our reflection is that love must be a fundament
8 SAGE Open
in connectedness with oneself as well as in connectedness
with others. Furthermore, movement and change are crucial
qualities of love, and love has the capacity to move beyond
the limitations of an individual standpoint and surrender to a
greater reality. The experience of love can therefore bring
about a sense of moving toward greater harmony and unity
(Kenny, 2011). Thus, it seems that love also is a fundament
in connectedness with something greater than oneself.
Tillich's view of love.It is highly relevant to be concerned
about the lack of love in caring for the patients (Straughair,
2012). Arman and Rehnsfeldt (2006) think that caring risks
losing love as an important ethical and ontological value, and
find that it is necessary to search for love's ontological basis.
We have chosen to reflect on Tillich's writings about love as
an ontological concept. In our opinion, Tillich provides a
meaning of love that is consistent with the understanding that
love and connectedness are interrelated. In the book Love,
Power, and Justice, Tillich (1954) elaborates on these three
basic concepts and their interrelated relationships. His con-
cern is that none of these concepts can be understood in a
broad sense without an ontological analysis of their root
meaning. This means that one must ask about how these con-
cepts are rooted in the nature of being as such. Bringing the
full potential of Tillich's text is not possible in this article,
and we base our reflections on the ontological or root mean-
ing of the concept of love. Tillich reminds us that no human
relations exist in a void; there are contextual structures
behind all encounters. Perhaps what is most interesting in
Tillich's text is how he brings the ontological root meaning
of the concepts together with the concepts of concrete and
contextual meaning in personal encounters.
Tillich (1954) believes love is a driving force and a con-
stitutive element of life, as being in actuality. This is the
ontological nature of love. He states that love is "the drive
towards the unity of the separated" (p. 39). Tillich argues that
the central core in being is love as a driving force toward
unity of that which originally have been units, but that have
been separated. There is no question of uniting the strange,
but a reunion of the estranged. Alienation presupposes origi-
nal unity, and love's greatest power is where it overcomes the
separation that makes us independent individuals. Our reflec-
tion is that this can be understood from a perspective in
which human beings are part of the infinite universe, and that
all people are "one." It can be viewed as an experience of
unity with something universal that we all belong to, and this
is consistent with connectedness with something greater than
ourselves.
Love, according to Tillich (1954), is a constitutional ele-
ment in life itself, and the individual is separated and at the
same time carries the most powerful love. This is reminiscent
of Watson (2003) who points out that our human existence is
grounded in love for each other. Love overcomes the separa-
tion between people, although without separation, neither
love nor life itself can exist (Tillich, 1954). This is, however,
a necessary contrast whereby the individual is preserved as a
self-centered self in person-to-person relationships, and at
the same time, the reunion with others in love is actualized.
Our reflection is that love reunites individual persons, and as
such, love must be part of connectedness with others.
Tillich (1954) points out that love involves passion and
emotion. Love as an emotion may ontologically be viewed as
the expectation about reunion that takes place in every rela-
tion based on love. Although love involves more than just
emotions, there is no love without the emotional element. He
explains that the human movement against the other
expresses itself in emotional ways. A prerequisite for love's
emotions is the separation of the self-centered self, which is
seen in the human ability to relate oneself as an "I" to a
"thou." Thus, the human being can be preserved as both a
subject and an object of love. At the same time, Tillich points
out that people also have an innate propensity to continue to
exist and enhance themselves, an intrinsic motivation toward
a fulfillment of oneself through union with others. Thus,
there is an element of passion and desire in man, in the sense
of self-fulfillment of one's own potential. Tillich claims that
love as a desire can be understood from its ontological basis.
He is opposed to desire only for pleasure, but points out that
all living beings strive for fulfillment of their desires. This
process in life is wrongly understood if it means that life
essentially consists of fleeing from pain and striving for plea-
sure. However, desire, according to Tillich, is a normal drive
toward vital self-fulfillment, and desire is a true quality in
any love relation. Both the intimate and romantic love called
eros and the love of family and friends called philia are
united with the desire of love in the meaning of vital self-
fulfillment (not pleasure). Furthermore, Tillich views self-
love as a metaphor that in itself cannot bring meaning if love
is the drive toward reunion of the separated. He finds that
self-love could be replaced by three different and contradic-
tory senses: in the sense of natural self-affirmation, in the
sense of selfishness, and in the sense of self-acceptance,
according to the given context. Our reflection according to
this is that love also is a fundament in connectedness with
oneself.
Tillich (1954) believes that the concept of love also has a
strong ethical character, and states that it is love that shows
what is just in the concrete situation. The relationship
between justice and love in personal encounters is described
by three functions for creative justice: listening, giving, and
forgiveness. No human relationship is possible without
mutual listening. The other calls on us and urges us to listen,
and understanding the other's intrinsic claims and justice of
being can only be given through the love that listens.
Listening love is the first step toward justice in person-to-
person encounters. Giving as an expression of creative jus-
tice serves the purpose of reuniting love, and it belongs to the
right of anyone we encounter to demand something from us,
at least the minimum of acknowledging the other as a person.
Forgiving is a paradoxical form in which justice is united
Rykkje et al. 9
with love. To forgive unjust actions is a fulfillment of justice
because it is the only way to reunite those who are estranged
by guilt. Without reconciliation, there can be no reunion
(Tillich, 1954). We reflect on love's ethical character as an
important basis for compassionate patient care, and this we
will elaborate further in the next section.
Reflections of Love in Connectedness
This article attempts to explore how Love in connectedness
may deepen our understanding of human spirituality. In this
section, we elaborate further on how love and connectedness
may be interrelated and work together as a life-giving force
(Råholm & Eriksson, 2001; Sivonen, 2000) in patient care.
Spirituality is considered an inner strength and a potential
health resource (Becker, 2009; Lindström et al., 2010), and
we believe that Love in connectedness is a powerful resource
inherent in human spirituality. In light of Tillich (1954), one
can describe love as the moving power of life. In this article,
we have tried to portray love as a vital part in spirituality and
connectedness. Mok, Wong, and Wong (2010) found in their
study about spirituality that receiving and giving love in rela-
tionships and connectedness are part of finding meaning in
life. Thus, we suggest that love may be a force that can alle-
viate spiritual suffering caused by meaninglessness and emp-
tiness, as described by Bellingham et al. (1989). According
to Kenny (2011), there is a quality of spontaneity within love
that creates the conditions for mind and body to become
more integrated. Love as a life-giving force comprises move-
ment and a restoring power (Råholm & Eriksson, 2001). It
can seem that love is a vital force both in connectedness with
others and in feeling like a whole human being.
Arman and Rehnsfeldt (2006) claim that if love is seen as
the ontological basis for caring and ethical acts, then caregiv-
ers' practices and expressions of love can enhance the
patient's understanding of life as well as give relief to their
suffering. In this regard, Tillich's reflections about the onto-
logical meaning of love may provide insights into how love
can be a creative force in caring for the patient. Love is
viewed as the drive toward unity of the separated, and we
find that this drive can be seen in both connectedness with
others, and in connectedness with something larger than
oneself. It might not straightforwardly apply to connected-
ness with oneself, although Tillich (1954) points out that love
of oneself may be described by self-affirmation and
self-acceptance.
Perhaps the most intriguing about Tillich's (1954) point of
view is the ethical function of love in personal encounters.
Somehow, love is both a force in creating relations between
the caregiver and the patient, and the ethical guide to caring
actions through creative listening, giving, and forgiving. We
believe love is present in caring relationships and concrete
caring acts (Rykkje et al., 2011). The literature on love is,
however, concerned about a lack of compassionate care for
the patient. Von Dietze and Orb (2000) claim that compas-
sion involves moral choices, and that it requires shared
experiences and actions. We find this to be in line with the
notion of connectedness with others, meaning that the care-
giver may touch the patient through genuine concern and
compassionate care. According to Schantz (2007), the power
of compassion in promoting healing lies in the health person-
nel's development of a relationship of confidence and trust
with the patient. Our reflection is that love as a reuniting
force (Tillich, 1954) should be present in all caring
relationships.
The Relevance for Clinical Practice
We would like to highlight how the power of love can pro-
vide a confirmation of the individuals' worth in clinical
practice; however, love should include both giving and
receiving. Family members supporting patients in palliative
care reported about deepened relationships and increased
awareness about life values (Sand et al., 2010). Acts of
goodness and compassion may provide a sense of dignity,
growth, and an inner feeling of joy or pleasure because one
feels like a "better" human being (Arman & Rehnsfeldt,
2006). Spirituality may manifest itself and grow when the
patients experience both receiving and giving love, as found
in fulfillment of duties and in service to others or a God
(Råholm & Eriksson, 2001). To maintain human dignity,
one important duty in life is to be able to serve or to be there
for another human being (Eriksson, 2001). Compassionate
care is in the light of our own research, rooted in dignity in
terms of being "valuable" meaning that the patient experi-
ence being of importance for others, and that others show
that the patient does mean something for them. Thus, we
suggest that Love in connectedness in caring for the patient
is about relationships built on mutual love. This is part of the
very foundation of loving care, that there is a reciprocity in
the relationship between the patient and the caregiver
(Rykkje et al., 2011). Staff must be involved so that love
reunites by enabling the patient to both give and receive
compassionate care. Hence, the caregiver must make room
so that the patient can also give others loving care, and not
just be a care recipient.
According to Eriksson (1997), professional caregivers
should be able to recognize and meet the individual patient's
spiritual needs. Therefore, health professionals must have
knowledge about spirituality and awareness for the spiritual
dimension in life. Caring for the whole human being presup-
poses that we understand and confirm the patient's spiritual-
ity (Lindström et al., 2010). To care for the patient's spirit is
important to maintain human dignity, and therefore, it may
be viewed as an ethical obligation. We would like to portray
spiritual care as to listening to the patient in caring relation-
ships of true presence, and trying to understand the situation
from the patients' point of view. Compassionate care, just
being there, and confirming the patients' dignity (Råholm &
Lindholm, 1999) may foster the patients' spiritual develop-
ment and enable them to feel whole as human beings
(Lindström et al., 2010).

Closing Reflections
Tillich puts forward that love is unity, and as such, it is the
moving power of life. We find that both connectedness and
love are key concepts in caring for the patient. Connectedness
is found to be central in spirituality, and the literature sup-
ports that love understood as compassion is relational and
thus fundamental in connectedness. Bringing these concepts
together in the category Love in connectedness has provided
a deeper understanding of how love is a life-giving force in
spirituality. We also view Love in connectedness as a resource
in the patients'becoming in health, and in the maintenance of
human dignity.
