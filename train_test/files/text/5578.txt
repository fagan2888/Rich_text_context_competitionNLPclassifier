Abstract
Objective: To investigate the basal amino acid metabolism and impact of growth hormone (GH)
therapy in short-stature children born small for gestational age (short SGA children).
Methods: In this age-matched case-control study, the basal blood levels of amino acids,
asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), and nitrite/nitrate (NOx) were compared between 24
short SGA children and 25 age-matched normal children. Changes in these parameters were
assessed for 12 months in 12 short SGA children initiating GH therapy (Group A) and 12 age-
matched short SGA children without GH therapy (Group B).
Results: The arginine levels were significantly lower in the short SGA than in normal children. The
ADMA levels were significantly higher and NOx levels were significantly lower in the short SGA
than normal children. In Group A, the ADMA level was significantly lower and NOx level was

to increase, but the NOx level remained the same. Group B showed no significant changes.
Conclusions: This study is the first to show that ADMA is promoted and nitric oxide is
suppressed in short SGA children and that GH therapy affects the production of ADMA and nitric
oxide.

Introduction
Growth hormone (GH) has been widely
accepted as a treatment for primary and
secondary GH deficiency.1­4 In addition to
increased height in childhood, GH therapy
is associated with a reduced risk of cardio-
vascular events later in life.1,4 GH therapy
has also been administered to small-for-
gestational age (SGA) children presenting
with a short stature (short SGA children),
and its impact on height catch-up has been
demonstrated.5­7
Short SGA children are inclined to pre-
sent with metabolic abnormalities predis-
posing to cardiovascular diseases such as
hypercholesterolemia later in life as a con-
sequence of relative GH deficiency.5,6
However, limited evidence regarding other
metabolic risk factors is available. To date,
no details regarding the amino acid metab-
olism in short SGA children with and with-
out GH therapy have been reported.
The production of nitric oxide (NO) and
asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is
strongly linked to amino acids such as
arginine and citrulline (Figure 1). NO has
many biological functions, including the
maintenance of vascular tone, neurotrans-
mitter function, and mediation of cellular
defense.8 ADMA competes with arginine for
NO synthase and inhibits NO production; it
also promotes superoxide production and
enhances oxidative stress.9 ADMA was
recently employed as a surrogate risk
marker for cardiovascular disease, renal
disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
and other conditions in both adults and
children.10­12
In the present study, we investigated the
blood levels of amino acids, ADMA, and
NOx13,14 and the impact of GH therapy for
12 months in short SGA children.
Patients and Methods
Study design and patients
This age-matched case-control study was
approved by the institutional review boards
of Takarazuka City Hospital (reference
number: 198), Osaka City General
Hospital (reference number: 1611073), and
Kobe University Graduate School of
Medicine (reference number: 160089).
Written informed consent was obtained
from the parents of the children prior to
study enrollment.
Twenty-four short SGA children aged 3
to 6 years who visited Takarazuka City
Hospital and Osaka City General Hospital
from 2010 to 2016 were enrolled. The birth
weight and height standard deviation (SD)
scores were determined using the standard
curve according to gestational age for the
Japanese population.15
At 3 to 6 years of age, the patients had
visited hospitals in the vicinity of their
homes because of parental concern
762 Journal of International Medical Research 46(2)
regarding the child's short stature. They
were then referred to our hospital for
thorough examinations. All patients
showed normal peak plasma GH concentra-
tions (>6 ng/mL on arginine, clonidine, and
insulin tests). None of the enrolled patients
had experienced serious episodes of condi-
tions such as asphyxia, respiratory distress,
or severe infection during the newborn or
infancy period with the exception of two
patients who had developed mild hypogly-
cemia that was resolved by intravenous
glucose administration a few days after
birth. The patients showed normal intellec-
tual development with the exception of one
patient who had been diagnosed with a mild
learning disability.
After receiving a detailed explanation of
GH therapy, the parents of 12 children
requested to initiate GH therapy as soon
as possible (Group A), and parents of the
remaining 12 children requested to initiate
GH therapy a few years later (Group B).
Children in Group A received a subcutane-
ous injection of GH once daily at a dose of
0.23 to 0.25 mg/kg for the first 6 months and
0.34 to 0.36 mg/kg for the following 6
months. For both groups, the following
data were monitored for 12 months:
height, weight, and various biochemical
parameters (amino acid profiles, the
ADMA and NOx concentrations, and par-
ameters linked to citrulline­arginine recy-
cling, such as arginine) (Figure 1). Blood
insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was
also monitored. Additionally, to evaluate
the oxidative stress status that influences NO
and ADMA production, the plasma con-
centrations of the antioxidants b-carotene
and a-tocophenol were examined.8,9
A group of 25 age-matched healthy vol-
unteer children (13 boys and 12 girls aged 3­
6 years) was enrolled at the Kobe Children's
Primary Emergency Medical Center to

Determination of IGF-1 and antioxidant
concentrations
The serum IGF-1 concentration was
determined via an immunoradiometric
assay using a somatomedin C-II kit
(Mitsubishi Chemicals Co., Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan). The IGF-1 SD scores were deter-
mined based on the age- and sex-specific
standard values for the Japanese popula-
tion.16 The plasma b-carotene and a-toco-
phenol concentrations were measured using
high-performance liquid chromatography.
Determination of serum ADMA, NOx, and
amino acid concentrations
The serum ADMA concentration was deter-
mined using an enzyme-linked immunosorb-
ent assay kit (DLD Diagnostika GmbH,
Hamburg, Germany).17,18 The serum con-
centration of NOx was assessed using the
Griess method with an NOx colorimetric
assay kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor,
MI, USA). The plasma concentrations of
amino acids involved in citrulline­arginine
recycling (Figure 1)13,14 were determined
using routine ion-exchange chromatography
with an autoanalyzer (L822; Hitachi High-
Technologies Corp., Tokyo, Japan).
Statistical analyses
Data distributions were assessed for
normality using a one-sample
Kolmogorov­Smirnov test. Data are pre-
sented as mean Æ SD. Differences between
the controls and patient groups with and
without GH treatment were examined using
an unpaired Student's two-tailed t-test or
nonparametric Mann­Whitney U test. Pre-
and post-treatment comparisons were
performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank
test. Correlations between variables were
estimated using Pearson's correlation tests.
A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistic-
ally significant.
Results
Basal anthropometric and amino acid
profiles in short SGA and normal children
The height and body weight SD scores of the
short SGA children were significantly lower
than those of the non-obese and non-short
stature normal children (p < 0.001 vs. con-
trols). The amino acid profile together with
the total protein and albumin blood con-
centrations were not different between these
two groups. However, the NOx and arginine
concentrations were significantly lower
(p < 0.05) and the ADMA levels were sig-
nificantly higher (p < 0.01) in the short SGA
children than in the normal children
(Table 1). The NOx concentration exhibited
a significantly positive correlation with the
ADMA concentration in controls but a
significantly negative correlation in the
short SGA children (normal children,
R2 ¼ 0.76, p < 0.001; short SGA children,
R2 ¼ 0.45, p < 0.01) (Figure 2).
Changes in height and body weight
SD scores
Consistent with SGA, the birth height and/
or weight SD scores of the patients were less
than À2 SD (Table 2).5,6 The height and
weight SD scores in infancy were determined
based on the age- and sex-specific standard
values for the Japanese population.19
Consistent with the indications for GH
therapy, the height SD score of the patients
was less than À2.5 SD at the age of !3 years
(Tables 1 and 2).5,6 At 0 months, the height
and body weight SD scores were not signifi-
cantly different between Groups A and B. At
6 months, the height SD score in Group A
had increased significantly from that at 0
months (p < 0.05 vs. basal SD score). At 12

months, the height SD score had continued
to increase in Group A (p < 0.001 vs. basal
SD score), and the body weight SD score
had also significantly increased from that at
0 months (p < 0.05 vs. basal SD score). In
contrast, the height and weight SD scores in
Group B did not significantly change during
the 12-month study period (Table 2).
Changes in ADMA, NOx, and amino acid
concentrations
At 0 months, the ADMA concentrations in
Groups A and B were not significantly
different from each other, but they were
significantly higher than those in the control
group (p < 0.001). In Group A, the ADMA

concentration at 6 months was significantly
lower than that at 0 months (p < 0.01) and
comparable with that in the control group.
At 12 months, the ADMA concentration
was higher than that at 6 months but
significantly higher than that at 0 months
(p < 0.05). In contrast, Group B exhibited
no significant changes in the ADMA con-
centration during the 12-month study period
(Table 3).
The basal NOx concentrations in Groups
A and B were comparable with each other
and significantly lower than those in the
control group (p < 0.01). Thereafter, in
Group A, the NOx concentration signifi-
cantly increased compared with basal levels
(p < 0.01), with the NOx concentrations at 6
and 12 months comparable with those in the
control group. In Group B, the NOx con-
centration remained at the basal level
throughout the study period (Table 3).
The basal arginine concentrations in
Groups A and B were significantly lower
than those in the control group (p < 0.05).
After the initiation of GH therapy, the
arginine level significantly increased in
Group A (p < 0.05 at 6 months and p < 0.01
at 12 months), demonstrating a concentration
that was almost comparable with that in the
control group. In contrast, the arginine con-
centration remained unchanged in Group B
(Table 3). Among the many remaining amino
acids examined, only the glutamine concen-
tration in Group A was significantly lower at
6 and 12 months compared with basal levels
(p < 0.05) (Table 3).
Changes in IGF-1 and antioxidant
concentrations
The basal IGF-1 concentrations in Groups
A and B were not significantly different and
were within the normal range (105 vs.
120 ng/mL) (Table 4). The SD score of the
basal IGF-1 concentration in Groups A and
B was less than À0.5. In Group A, the IGF-1
concentration significantly increased to
more than the 0.5 SD score (154 ng/mL,
p < 0.001) at 6 months and to more than the
1.0 SD score (190 ng/mL, p < 0.001) at 12
months. However, no dramatic increases
were seen in Group B (120 ng/mL at

129 ng/mL at 12 months). The basal b-
carotene and a-tocophenol concentrations
in the short SGA children were lower than
those in the age-matched controls. These
levels were significantly higher at 6 and 12
months compared with the basal levels in
Group A but not in Group B (Table 4).
Correlations between NOx and ADMA

At 0 months, the NOx concentration
demonstrated a significant negative
correlation with the ADMA concentration
in Groups A and B (p < 0.05) (Figure 3).
Group B continued to exhibit this significant
negative correlation, but no significant cor-
relations were found at 6 and 12 months in
Group A.
Discussion
GH has been widely administered to
patients with GH deficiency, particularly to
young children with idiopathic GH insuffi-
ciency.1­4 For the last 10 years, GH has also
been increasingly administered to short

pharmacological and much higher than
those used for treatment of physiological
GH deficiency.5,6 This is consistent with the
higher IGF-1 concentrations in short SGA
children undergoing treatment with GH as
shown in Table 4. The strong effect of GH in
increasing height has been shown in many
patients. In addition, the metabolic effects of
GH on lipids and carbohydrates have been
previously reported.1,4­6 Specifically, GH
lowers the low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol concentration, and a higher dose of
GH decreases insulin sensitivity, predispos-
ing patients to diabetes mellitus.1,4­6
Nevertheless, the impact of GH on amino
acid metabolism has been scarcely exam-
ined.20­25 Furthermore, few data exist on
amino acid metabolism in short SGA
children.
The results of the present study also
suggest that basal ADMA production is
promoted in short SGA children and that in
contrast to ADMA, NO production is sup-
pressed. Almost all cells and tissues produce
ADMA as a product of protein degradation.
ADMA is formed from arginine residues in
proteins and competes with arginine for
each of the three isoforms of NO synthase
(NOS) (Figure 1).9 ADMA is mainly meta-
bolized into citrulline and dimethylamine by
the liver, kidney, and endothelium via
dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydro-
lase.9,26,27 In the present study, the serum
NOx concentration showed a significant
negative correlation with the serum
ADMA concentration in short SGA chil-
dren without GH treatment in contrast to
normal children, who exhibited a significant
positive correlation. Accordingly, increased
ADMA production is likely to suppress NO
production in short SGA children. The
mechanistic explanation for the increase in
ADMA remains unknown. Oxidative
stress stimulates ADMA production by
suppressing dimethylarginine dimethylami-
nohydrolase activity and promoting protein
arginine methyltransferase (Figure 1).28­30
The oxidative stress status in short SGA
children was not fully evaluated in the
present study. However, the blood concen-
tration of the antioxidants b-carotene and a-
tocophenol were decreased in the short SGA
children and restored by GH treatment
(Table 4). These results suggest that
enhanced oxidative stress contributes to
suppression of NO production in short
SGA children.
The influence of GH on the NOS-ADMA
pathway has been rarely studied. Only a few
reports have described ADMA and NO
production during GH treatment.20­25
According to these earlier reports,20­23 GH
is thought to exhibit generally favorable
effects on the NOS-ADMA pathway in
GH deficiency, possibly leading to reduced
risk of cardiovascular events. Most reports
have described decreased blood ADMA
concentrations in GH-deficient adults and
increased basal ADMA concentrations in
prepubertal to pubertal children undergoing
GH therapy.20­24 O
¨ nder et al.25 reported
decreased ADMA in prepubertal to pubertal
GH-deficient children, whose basal ADMA
concentrations were comparable with those
of the age-matched controls, by GH therapy.
The effect of GH on ADMA production may
differ according to age. The results of the
present study suggest that suppressed NO
production in short SGA children is, at least
in part, restored by GH therapy because the
serum NOx concentration (reflecting NO
production) was increased at dosages of
0.23 to 0.25 and 0.34 to 0.36 mg/kg/week.
In contrast, the serum ADMA concentra-
tion decreased under the former dosage but
increased under the latter dosage. In general,
our results are largely consistent with those
described in earlier reports.20­24
The results of the present study also
showed that the concentrations of the
amino acids involved in the urea cycle and
citrulline­arginine recycling changed with
GH treatment.13,14 Specifically, the basal
serum arginine concentration in the short

the initiation of GH treatment; the arginine-
to-ornithine ratio significantly increased by
GH therapy, and in contrast to arginine,
increased levels of glutamine (a major source
of ammonia) decreased with GH therapy.
Based on these data, we speculate that urea
cyclefunctionispromotedbyGHtreatmentto
some degree, resulting in increased arginine
production (Figure 1). Considering that argin-
ine is a substrate for NO, the increase of
arginine may contribute to the increased NO
production, at least in part.
IGF-1 increases NOS activity by inter-
acting with a tyrosine kinase membrane
receptor linked to insulin receptor sub-
strate.31,32 This receptor complex activates
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which acti-
vates the serine/threonine kinase Akt signal-
ing pathway, promoting NOS activity and
NO production.29,30 From this context, we
infer that the considerably increased IGF-1
concentration by GH is attributable to the
restoration of NO production.
Short SGA children exhibit a decrease in
muscle volume and an increase in visceral fat
mass volume.33­35 The accumulation of vis-
ceral fat is sometimes considerable in
affected patients.33,34 GH treatment has
been shown to substantially increase
muscle mass and decrease adipose
tissue.1,2,4 Furthermore, a recent study
demonstrated that GH therapy also reduces
the liver fat content in adults with GH
deficiency.36 Such changes in body compos-
ition by GH therapy may also contribute to
the favorable changes in the NOS-ADMA
pathway as well as endothelial and liver
function, including urea cycle function.
ADMA not only inhibits NOx activity
but may also enhance oxidative stress,
predisposing to insulin resistance and car-
diovascular disease.9,37 In contrast, NO
exerts multifarious biological functions
such as vasodilation, anti-inflammation,
apoptosis, and regulation of neurological
systems.8 In this context, more attention
should be paid to ADMA and NO produc-
tion before and after GH therapy.
The main limitations of this study are that
the number of enrolled short SGA children
was relatively small, the production of intra-
cellular ADMA and NO was not examined,
and we were unable to determine the daily
intake of arginine, glutamine, and other
amino acids that might have influenced the
results. Throughout this study, however, we
evaluated the patients' appetite and dietary
pattern by interviewing their mothers, and
these parameters seemed almost unchanged.
Despite these limitations, the present study
provides evidence that GH treatment influ-
ences ADMA and NO production as well as
relevant amino acid concentrations in short
SGA children. Recent meta-analyses have
revealed that the onset of cardiovascular
disease and stroke are associated with high
ADMA concentrations, suggesting that
ADMA is an independent risk factor for
such diseases.38,39 More extensive and long-
standing studies are required to gain better
knowledge regarding the metabolic effects
and resultant clinical benefits of GH treat-
ment in short SGA children.
