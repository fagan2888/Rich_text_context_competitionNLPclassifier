Risk Factors for Hypertension in
a National Cohort Study
Earl S. Ford and Richard S. Cooper
Hypertension continues to be a major public health problem in the United States. We used data
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic Followup Study
(1971-1984) to examine predictors of hypertension for the 7,073 participants free from
hypertension at the baseline examination. The follow-up period averaged 10 years. Body mass
index was positively related to the probability of hypertension developing among white men
(n=2,370), white women (n=3,949), black men (n=231), and black women (n=523). Education
was inversely associated with the probability of hypertension developing among white women
and was of borderline significance among white men and black women. In a subanalysis of
white men (n = l,790) and white women (n=3,063) who completed the 24-hour recall dietary
questionnaire, dietary consumption of sodium, calcium, and potassium did not predict the
development of hypertension. The failure of our study to support findings relating intake of
dietary cations to the development of hypertension may be attributable to imprecision in the
measurement of dietary data and misclassification of hypertension status. These data reinforce
the importance of weight control in the primary prevention of hypertension. (Hypertension
1991;18:598-606)
Hypertension is a major public health problem
in the United States, with 57,100,000
Americans estimated to have the disease.1
Despite extensive research into the etiology and
contributing causes of essential hypertension, the
pathogenesis of the condition is still not explained.
Nonpharmacological approaches to the treatment of
hypertension have included a reduction of salt intake
and increases in dietary potassium and calcium con-
sumption, weight loss, and increased physical activity.
Although the small reductions in blood pressure
from these nonpharmacological measures could the-
oretically have important beneficial public health
consequences,2 it has not been shown that these
approaches can serve as primary measures to retard
or prevent the onset of hypertension in the general
population.
Most of the available data have come from cross-
sectional and experimental studies. However, determi-
nants of blood pressure have been examined in few
prospective studies. We studied the relations of several
sociodemographic, behavioral, and biochemical param-
eters on the incidence of hypertension among a group

of participants followed from the first National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I),
which was conducted from 1971 through 1975.
Methods
Between 1971 and 1975, 20,729 Americans aged
25-74 years participated in the NHANES I study.
The plans and operations for the NHANES I and
NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Study have
been published previously.3-6 Of the 14,407 partici-
pants who were 25-74 years old at baseline and
underwent a medical examination, 13,380 (92.9%)
were successfully traced between 1982 and 1984.7
Among the participants, a more detailed examination
was performed on 6,913 persons. These included
3,059 participants in a 1975 augmentation survey plus
a random sample of participants examined from 1971
through 1974. Survivors and proxy respondents for
deceased participants and participants incapable of
responding were interviewed, and blood pressure
measurements were obtained from survivors. Mean
follow-up time was 10 years for traced participants
still alive, with a range of 5-12 years. The study and
the confidentiality of the data from the study were
thoroughly discussed with the participants. By agree-
ing to participate in the study, participants gave
implied consent.
By design, various subgroups of the final sample
completed different study components and question-
naires. A detailed medical examination was per-

formed on 6,913 persons. This included the 3,059
persons from the augmentation survey that was con-
ducted from July 1974 through September 1975 as
well as 3,854 randomly sampled persons from partic-
ipants between 1971 and 1974.8 Consequently, not all
information is available for each respondent. For
example, dietary data were available only for 11,348
participants, serum calcium data for 6,913 partici-
pants, and serum potassium and sodium data for
3,059 participants, whereas serum magnesium data
were available for all participants.
At the baseline examination, a single blood pres-
sure measurement was obtained in accordance with
American Heart Association criteria.9 We defined
hypertension at baseline as a systolic blood pressure
(SBP) of greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg, a
diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of greater than or
equal to 95 mm Hg, or using antihypertensive medi-
cation. The latter factor was determined at the
baseline examination, when all participants between
the ages of 12 and 74 years were asked, "During the
past 6 months, have you used any medicine, drugs, or
pills for high blood pressure?" Participants who
responded that they regularly or occasionally used
antihypertensive medications were eliminated from
the analysis, as were participants with missing infor-
mation that precluded the establishment of hyperten-
sive status. For participants receiving the more de-
tailed examination, the wording of the follow-up
questionnaire differed from the original question-
naire. First, respondents were asked if they had ever
been told by a doctor that they had hypertension or
high blood pressure. Those who responded affirma-
tively were then asked, "Has a doctor ever prescribed
medicine for your (high blood pressure/hyperten-
sion)?" Those who responded affirmatively to this
question and replied to a subsequent question that
they used antihypertensive medication all the time,
often, or once in a while, were classified as hyperten-
sive and excluded from the analysis.
At the follow-up examination between 1980 and
1982, three blood pressure measurements were ob-
tained from each living participant where this was
possible. The average SBP and DBP data from the
last two readings were used to determine hyperten-
sive status. The same definition (SBP ^160 mm Hg,
DBP s95 mm Hg, or the use of antihypertensive
medications) classified participants as hypertensive.
Independent variables were age, income, educa-
tion, leisure-time physical activity, non-leisure-time
physical activity, body mass index, blood cholesterol
level, resting pulse rate, alcohol use, and serum
magnesium level. For the dietary subanalysis, dietary
intakes of sodium, potassium, and calcium and total
number of calories were examined. The continuous
variables of age, income, education, body mass index,
and alcohol use were divided into discrete categories,
as shown in Table 1. Body mass index was divided
into three categories. Normal weight was defined as
less than 27.8 kg/m2 for men and less than 27.3 kg/m2
for women. Obesity was defined as 27.8 to less than

31.1 kg/m2 for men and 27.3 to less than 32.3 kg/m2
for women. Severe obesity was defined as 31.1 kg/m2
or greater for men and 32.3 kg/m2 or greater for
women.10 Alcohol use was calculated as the number
of drinks of alcohol consumed per day. This variable
was categorized as less than 1 drink/day, 1-2 drinks/
day, and 3 or more drinks/day. Dietary calcium,
potassium, and sodium data were divided into quar-
tiles based on the distribution of the entire sample,
and the quartile with the lowest consumption was
used as the reference category. Similarly, serum
levels of calcium, potassium, and sodium were di-
vided into quartiles based on the distribution of the
entire sample, with the lowest serum values used as
the reference category.
To describe differences in categorical baseline
variables among the four race and sex groups, we
used log-linear modeling. To test for differences in
continuous variables among the four race and sex
groups, we used analysis of variance. The relation-
ship of the study variables to the development of
hypertension was examined in several ways. For each
race and sex group, we determined the incidence of
hypertension for each level of each study variable.
Duferences in hypertension incidence were exam-
ined with x1 tests. Furthermore, we used logistic
regression analysis to examine the relation between
each individual study variable and hypertension sta-
tus. To examine the independent association be-
tween the study variables and hypertension status,
multiple logistic regression analysis was used.
The NHANES I study was designed as a multistage,
stratified probability survey. Oversampling of certain
groups (women of childbearing age, the elderly, and
persons living in low-income areas) was performed.
Rather than producing national prevalence estimates,
we wished to examine relations between risk factors
and mortality in a large community sample and, there-
fore, we did not use sample weights.

Results
Out of the 14,407 cohort members of this study,
7,073 participants (231 black men, 2,370 white men,
523 black women, and 3,949 white women) were
available for analysis not involving serum or dietary
data after exclusions (Figure 1). Because of the
relatively small number of black participants in-
volved, some of the results, especially for black men,
are based on small numbers; therefore, the findings
should be interpreted with caution.
The distribution of categorical variables and means
with standard errors of continuous variables at base-
line for the four race and sex groups are presented in
Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The four groups are
characterized by differences in race or sex or both
race and sex distributions of all study variables.
The 10-year incidence of hypertension increased
with age and body mass index in all four groups and
decreased with increasing education in all groups
except black men (Table 3). Except among white
women, the incidence of hypertension was higher
among the least active group during leisure time than
among more active participants. The incidence of
hypertension varied little across serum magnesium
and alcohol consumption levels.
Mean systolic blood pressure was 123.0 mm Hg at
baseline and 125.1 mm Hg at follow-up. The change
in systolic blood pressure ranged from a decrease of
65 mm Hg to an increase of 91 mm Hg. Mean dia-
stolic blood pressure was 78.5 mm Hg at baseline and
76.0 mm Hg at follow-up. The change in diastolic
blood pressure ranged from a decrease of 61 mm Hg
to an increase of 68 mm Hg.
The univariate relations were examined simultane-
ously by multiple logistic regression analysis (Table
4). Increasing body mass index was the only variable
that was consistently associated with the develop-
ment of hypertension in all groups. In models where
we categorized body mass index, the odds ratios for
men with a body mass index of 27.3 or greater and
women with a body mass index of 27.8 kg/nr or
greater compared with those who had a smaller body
mass index were 2.78 for black men (p=0.0032), 1.64

for white men (p<0.0001), 1.84 for black women
0=0.0020), and 2.16 for white women (/><0.0001)
(data not shown). Education was inversely related to
the probability of hypertension developing among
white women and was of borderline significance
among white men and black women. Serum magne-
sium levels were inversely related to the incidence of
hypertension. White men who consumed 3 or more
drinks/day were at increased risk for hypertension
developing compared with white men who drank 1-2
drinks/day (odds ratio 1.55, 95% confidence limits
1.04-2.32). The regression coefficients for alcohol
use among black men suggested a similar association
but were not statistically significant. This is in con-
trast to white women, who had a lower risk of
hypertension if they consumed less than 1 drink/day.
Physical activity did not predict the development of
hypertension.
For the dietary analysis, 4,772 white subjects free
from hypertension at baseline and with complete
data for the dependent and independent variables
were available for analysis (Table 5). Because of
small numbers, the analyses were restricted to white
participants. Among white men (n = 1,709), no signif-
icantfindingswere observed in statistical models that
adjusted for age or age and caloric intake. Among
white women (n=3,063), calcium, potassium, and
sodium intake were all inversely related to hyperten-
sion in statistical models that adjusted for age only.
However, in models that adjusted for age and caloric
intake, no significant results were found. Body mass
index appears to confound the relation between
calcium and potassium intake and hypertension but
not that of sodium intake.
There was no evidence that baseline serum levels
of calcium, potassium, or sodium were predictive of
the future risk of hypertension in either univariate or
multivariate analysis (Table 6).
Discussion
Relatively few epidemiological investigations have
prospectively examined potential causes of hyperten-
sion. We examined the relation of a number of
variables to hypertension development after a mean
follow-up period of 10 years. Education and body
mass index were the two variables that most consis-
tently predicted the incidence of hypertension across
all four race and sex groups.
A hypertension threshold of 160 mm Hg or more
for SBP or 95 mm Hg or more for DBP was chosen
for two reasons. First, during the period of this study,
the prevailing definition of hypertension was based
on this threshold. Only in 1984 was the definition
changed to a SBP of 140 mm Hg or more or a DBP of
90 mm Hg or more.1 Second, only one blood pressure
measurement was obtained at baseline. Conse-
quently, the possibility of misclassifying a participant
as hypertensive is greater at the lower threshold of
hypertension.
Various anthropometric measures have been asso-
ciated with blood pressure.11 Our study demonstrates
that, independent of age, body mass index was a risk
factor for hypertension. Data from the NHANES II
study showed that the prevalence of obesity (com-
bined overweight and severe overweight categories)
was 32.2% among white men, 35.9% among black
men, 34.9% among white women, and 63.1% among
black women.10 If the odds ratios for obesity previ-
ously calculated are assumed to be approximations of
the relative risk, then the population attributable risk
is 12.6% for white men, 23.0% for black men, 18.7%
for white women, and 28.8% for black women. These
data underscore the importance of weight control in
the prevention of hypertension, especially among
black men and women.
Several studies have shown that socioeconomic
status is inversely related to blood pressure.12-13 Our
results also show that participants with more ad-

vanced education were less likely to become hyper-
tensive than were participants with fewer years of
education. Income was not a particularly good pre-
dictor of hypertension.
Two studies have demonstrated an inverse associ-
ation between the incidence of hypertension and
physical activity orfitness.14-15Among 6,039 men and
women aged 20-65 years, those with low levels of
fitness had a relative risk of 1.52 for developing
hypertension (defined either as ever being told by a
physician that they had hypertension or as the use of
antihypertensive medications).14 A lack of strenuous
exercise was a risk factor for physician-diagnosed
hypertension developing among 14,998 male Harvard
alumni.15 Our present findings could not confirm the
results of these studies.
The relation between sodium use and blood pressure
has been much studied and continues to remain con-
troversial.16.17 The INTERSALT study, a large cross-
sectional study, has shown that a reduction in sodium
intake of 100 mmol/day would lead to a mean reduction
of 2.2 mm Hg in SBP and 0.1 mm Hg in DBP.18 Our
analysis of data from the NHANES I Epidemiologic
Followup Study shows no evidence that sodium con-
sumption was related to the incidence of hypertension
in a large sample of the US population. In this regard,
our study joins other within-population studies that
have failed to confirm a positive relation between
sodium consumption and blood pressure.
Also, the data from this study did not show a
reduction in the risk of the incidence of hypertension
with increased use of dietary potassium at baseline.

Although we did note an inverse relation between
the two variables among white women in univariate
analysis, this relation no longer persisted in multi-
variate analysis. Previous NHANES I study analyses
demonstrated a cross-sectional association between
dietary potassium intake and blood pressure.19'20
Other cross-sectional and experimental studies have
also shown an inverse relation.18-21
The association between dietary calcium intake
and blood pressure and the potential benefit of
treating hypertension with increased dietary intake
of calcium remain controversial.162223 Previous
analyses of the NHANES I and II data have yielded
conflicting findings regarding the influence of vari-
ous dietary variables on blood pressure, particularly
calcium.192024-25 Other cross-sectional studies have
shown relations between dietary calcium intake and
blood pressure.2026"35 Data from the Western Elec-
tric Heart Study36 showed that calcium intake was
inversely related to the incidence of elevated DBP
(95 mm Hg or greater) but not of elevated SBP (160
mm Hg or greater). A recent report of a large
cohort study of women showed that dietary calcium
intake was inversely related to hypertension among
women.37
Although alcohol use was shown to be related to
blood pressure in previous cross-sectional analyses of
NHANES I data,20-24 we found conflicting evidence
regarding the role of alcohol consumption in the inci-
dence of hypertension. Among white men, and perhaps

among black men as well, the risk of hypertension
developing was highest among those who drank an
average of 3 or more drinks/day compared with those
who drank 1-2 drinks each day. However, among white
women, a lower risk of hypertension was found among
those who did not drink at all (odds ratio 0.70, 95%
confidence limits 0.52-0.95) or who drank less than 1
drink/day compared to women who had 1-2 drinks/day.
This agrees with findings from a large cohort study of
women.38 However, unlike that study, we could not
demonstrate a relation between an increased risk of
hypertension and increased alcohol consumption.
Several study limitations must be considered in the
interpretation of our findings. First, blood pressure was
determined by a single measurement taken at the
baseline examination. In most studies, three measure-

ments are taken on one or more occasions, with the
average of the last two measurements used to provide
greater stability of the data. Also, the questions asked
of the augmented sample used to classify participants
as hypertensive differed somewhat. This difference may
have resulted in some people (but probably not very
many) being misclassified as normotensive.
The measurement of several of the independent
variables poses greater concerns. Dietary data were
collected at a single 24-hour recall. With this method,
the intraindividual variability exceeds the interindi-
vidual variability and therefore, it may not be suffi-
ciently accurate to classify persons correctly. The
impact of measurement error using this technique on
potential associations has been discussed previous-
ly.3940 We tried to minimize misclassification by
performing a quartile analysis, but the results from
this analysis did not give strong support for any effect
of intake of dietary cations (Table 5).
The classification of physical activity levels in this
data set is unsophisticated and probably resulted in
significant misclassification. Participants were simply
asked to classify themselves, without a frame of
reference, in one of three activity categories. There-
fore, each participant's belief of what constituted
being active or sedentary dictated an answer. The
reliability of these answers has not been tested, and
the indirect validity of these data in the NHANES I
study is limited.41 The usefulness and limitations of
simplified physical activity questionnaires have been
discussed elsewhere.42-43
Finally, the relatively small numbers of black men
and women reduced the power of the study to detect
associations in these groups.
In conclusion, body mass index and education were
generally the most consistent predictors for the de-
velopment of hypertension after an average of 10
years of follow-up among the four race and sex
groups. These data confirm the importance of weight
control in the prevention of hypertension and pro-
vide a clear target for intervention by both the
physician in his or her daily practice and by persons
in the public health sector. No strong evidence for an
effect of dietary sodium, potassium, or calcium intake
on the incidence of hypertension was observed. How-
ever, the failure of our study to support findings
relating intake of dietary cations to the development
of hypertension may be attributable to imprecision in
the measurement of dietary data and misclassifica-
tion of hypertension status. Future longitudinal stud-
ies using better quantification of dietary variables
should address the importance of dietary intake of
cations on hypertension in the general population.
