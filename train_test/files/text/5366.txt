Introduction
Although several nonsteroid hormone options for
treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
have emerged in the last decades, glucocorticoids
(GCs) are still commonly used as a first-line
therapy and in flare-ups of the disease.1­3 A
recent study in France showed that more than
70% of patients with IBD received a course of
oral GC at least once within the first 5 years
after diagnosis.3 GC treatment is limited by
side effects, leading to body changes similar to
endogenous hypercortisolism (i.e. Cushing's
syndrome) and hypothalamic­pituitary­adrenal
(HPA) axis suppression.4,5
The clinical course after glucocorticoid
treatment in patients with inflammatory
bowel disease is linked to suppression of
the hypothalamic­pituitary­adrenal axis: a
retrospective observational study

Abstract
Background: Adrenal insufficiency (AI) secondary to treatment with glucocorticoids (GCs)
is common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but little is known about the
relationship between AI and the clinical course in IBD. The aim of the study was to compare
the clinical course in IBD patients with normal adrenal function versus patients with
subnormal adrenal function.
Methods: A retrospective observational study on 63 patients with IBD who had performed a
low-dose short Synacthen test (LDSST) (1 g) immediately (1­7 days) after a standard course
of GCs. A subnormal LDSST was defined as serum cortisol <550 nmol/L. Outcomes were time
to next flare and fecal calprotectin levels.
Results: Sixty-three percent (n = 40) of the IBD patients had a subnormal LDSST. Patients
who were steroid-free (n = 41) after the LDSST were observed for 3 years. Patients with a
peak serum cortisol <400 nmol/L immediately after GC treatment had significantly longer
time until the next flare-up of their IBD and tended to use a lower cumulative prednisolone
dose during the study period in comparison to the other subgroups. Fecal calprotectin levels
were significantly lower in patients with a peak s-cortisol <550 nmol/L versus patients with
peak s-cortisol 550 nmol/L (median 336 µg/g (IQR 521) versus 955 µg/g (IQR 1867);
p = 0.012).
Conclusions: GC-induced AI is common in patients with IBD and is associated with
lower disease activity. This suggests a link between responsiveness to GC treatment and
suppression of the hypothalamic­pituitary­adrenal axis in IBD.

GC treatment for IBD is given in standardized
schedules beginning with a high dose (predniso-
lone 0.5­1 mg/kg/day), which is tapered off dur-
ing a period of 10­12 weeks with the purpose of
allowing recovery of HPA axis function.1,2,6­9
However, in up to 65% of the patients with IBD,
HPA axis suppression persists after withdrawal of
GC treatment.6 We found no reports in the litera-
ture on the relationship between GC-induced
adrenal insufficiency (AI) in patients with IBD
and the response to GC treatment.
Our hypothesis is that there is an association
between the clinical response to GC and con-
comitant side effects, manifested as a suppres-
sion of the HPA axis. As a consequence, patients
who demonstrate AI after a course of GCs
respond better to GC treatment. We performed
a retrospective study to estimate disease activity
during a 3-year period after a course of GC treat-
ment for active IBD, and investigated the rela-
tionship between disease activity and the
outcome of a low-dose short Synacthen test
(LDSST) performed within 1 week of finalizing
GC treatment.
Methods
Study design
A retrospective observational study.
Study population
From the hospital data records, we identified all
patients with international classification of dis-
eases (ICD) for ulcerative colitis (UC) and
Crohn's disease (CD), who had performed an
LDSST (n = 93) between the years 2005 and
2012 at the Department of Medicine, Umeå
University Hospital, Sweden. Due to the reports
of a high prevalence of GC-induced AI in patients
with IBD,6 there was a low threshold for testing
with LDSST after a course of GCs at our clinic
during this time period.
Umeå University Hospital is a primary catchment
area of 150,000 citizens. During the time period,
approximately 800 patients with IBD were treated
at our clinic. The inclusion criterion for this retro-
spective observational study was an established
IBD disease that had been treated with GCs and
had undergone an LDSST to evaluate the HPA
axis 1­7 days after a standard course of GC.
Low-dose short Synacthen test
An LDSST (1 g) was used to test adrenal func-
tion. This test has shown excellent correlation with
the insulin tolerance test10 and is the standard test
for investigation for AI in our department.11 The
patients were informed not to use oral or inhaled
steroids 24 h before the test. An intravenous cath-
eter was inserted into the forearm and a blood
sample was drawn at baseline, and then at 30 and
40 min after 1 g of Synacthen was administered
intravenously. Plasma cortisol was analyzed by
Cobas Cortisol (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz,
Switzerland), Modular E170/Cobas e601/e602.12
The LDSST was considered normal if the peak
cortisol level was at least 550 nmol/L; a peak corti-
sol level below 550 nmol/L was defined as AI.
Furthermore, if the peak cortisol level was 400­
549 nmol/L the test was judged as mild AI, whereas
if the peak cortisol level was below 400 nmol/L it
was judged as severe AI. In addition to the first
LDSST, all additional LDSSTs were registered to
estimate the time when HPA function was restored.
Medical records
Medical, surgical and laboratory records for the
included patients were thoroughly reviewed for
data concerning the time before and the 3 years
after the first LDSST was performed. Before the
first LDSST, data on estimated lifetime pre-
cumulative doses of prednisolone and budeson-
ide, IBD type, disease duration, previous
treatment (surgery and medical) and the use of
other GC formulas (enemas, inhalers, topical)
were collected. The estimated lifetime pre-cumu-
lative dose of GCs was defined as the sum of all
oral prednisolone doses prescribed to the patient
before the first LDSST. The duration of the GC
course used before the first LDSST was esti-
mated. Most patients received a standardized
prednisolone treatment schedule, which started
with 40 mg prednisolone daily for 1 week, fol-
lowed by 30 mg prednisolone daily for 1 week,
and then slowly tapered down during the addi-
tional 10 weeks. Patients who prolonged their
treatment (>3 months) due to `steroid depend-
ency' were registered. The standardized schedule
for budesonide (only used by CD patients) was
9 mg per day for 3 months followed by 6 mg per
day for 3 months. The major focus of the present
study was on disease activity within 3 years after
the LDSST. The time until post-GC treatment
flare-up was obtained from the medical records.
A flare-up was defined if the doctor, due to active
A Ibrahim, P Dahlqvist et al.

disease, intensified the therapy by increasing the
5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) dose, restarted GC
treatment (local or oral), initiated/intensified
immunomodulators, biologics or if surgery was
performed. Escalation of therapy was defined as if
the patients during the observation period had
started immunomodulators, biologics or had
needed surgery due to IBD. At our clinic, all
patients with IBD are encouraged to report by tel-
ephone as soon as they suspect a flare-up of the
disease. In addition, they visit the clinic for at
least annual check-ups. If the patient was in
remission during the whole 3-year period, the
time for the next flare-up was set to 3 years. We
also registered whether the patient was treated
with GC replacement therapy due to a subnormal
LDSST. Standard replacement therapy used at
our clinic is hydrocortisone 10 mg twice daily.
Fecal calprotectin
Fecal calprotectin (FC) level was used as an
objective biomarker of gut inflammation. The
samples for FC were analyzed at the Department
of Laboratory Medicine, Umeå University
Hospital, by the CALPRO® Calprotectin ELISA
Test according to the manufacturer (Calpro AS,
Lysaker, Norway) instructions. Bilevel material
supplied by the manufacturer was used for quality
control. The detection limit for FC is <20 µg/g.
As a marker of gut inflammation, we used the first
FC after the LDSST and the median value of all
FC tests analyzed during the observation period.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS
Statistics version 23. Non-parametric tests were
used for comparing ordinal scales and continuous
variables (Mann­Whitney U test) and for correla-
tions (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient).
The Chi-square test was used for crosstabs analy-
ses, and Fisher's exact test was used if there were
fewer than 10 cases. Student's t test was used for
parametric comparison. A two-sided p-value less
than 0.05 was regarded as significant. Means and
standard deviations were used for continuous var-
iables and medians and interquartile range (IQR)
were used for ordinal variables. Due to the explor-
atory purpose of the study we did not correct for
multiple testing.
Results
Basal characteristics
Sixty-three patients (27 UC, 36 CD) fulfilled the
inclusion criteria and were included in the analy-
sis. Forty patients (63%) had a subnormal
LDSST after GC treatment and 14 patients
(22%) had a peak cortisol below 400 nmol/L
(Figure 1). Among the patients with AI the
mean peak stimulated serum cortisol was 385 ±
115 nmol/L; the distribution of peak serum corti-
sol value for the patients is shown in Figure 1.
There were no differences in age, gender, IBD
type, disease duration, the use of inhalation ster-
oids, topical steroids, the pre-cumulative lifetime
doses of prednisolone and budesonide or dura-
tion of the steroid course between patients with a
subnormal versus a normal LDSST (Table 1).
Male gender and a history of previous IBD sur-
gery (five patients for CD and two patients for
UC) was significantly more common in the sub-
jects with a peak cortisol <400 nmol/L. Subjects
with intermediate subnormal peak cortisol levels
(400­549 nmol/L) had a significantly shorter
time since diagnosis than the other subgroups.
Disease activity
After the LDSST, nine patients remained on a
low dose of prednisolone and 12 patients
remained on oral budesonide treatment for IBD.
These patients and the patients with UC who had
been colectomized prior to the LDSST were not
included in the observational analysis of esti-
mated disease activity. The remaining 41 patients
(20 UC, 21 CD) who were steroid-free after the
LDSST were retrospectively observed for 3 years
(Table 2). The patients with a peak cortisol
<400 nmol/L had significantly longer time until

the next flare-up of their IBD and there was a
trend for smaller cumulative prednisolone dose
during the study period in comparison to the
other subgroups (Table 2). Seven out of eight of
the patients with peak cortisol <400 nmol/L
received replacement therapy with hydrocorti-
sone. There was a non-significant negative corre-
lation between peak cortisol levels and time to
next flare-up (rs ­0.289; p = 0.066). The first FC
test after the LDSST was significantly lower in
patients with peak s-cortisol <550 nmol/L (n =
21) than in patients with peak s-cortisol 550
nmol/L (n = 11) (median 336 µg/g (IQR 521)
versus 955 µg/g (IQR 1867); p = 0.012). The
median of all of a patient's FC tests during the
observational period was also significantly lower
in the patients with peak s-cortisol <550 nmol/L
in comparison to patients with peak s-cortisol
550 nmol/L (median 422 µg/g (IQR 412) versus
820 µg/g (IQR 1955); p = 0.031).
Patients who received replacement therapy
with hydrocortisone
Eleven of 41 patients received replacement ther-
apy with hydrocortisone. These patients had

significantly longer time to next flare-up than
patients without hydrocortisone (median 23
months (IQR 32) versus 8 months (IQR 10);
p = 0.050) but there were no differences in cumu-
lative prednisolone dose or FC test levels between
the patients with and without hydrocortisone
treatment.
Restoration of HPA function
Ten out of 14 patients (71%) with GC-induced
AI (peak cortisol <550 nmol/L) still showed sub-
normal HPA function when retested (3­15
months after first LDSST). Seven out of these 10
patients had received replacement therapy in
physiological doses but none of the patients had
received courses of GCs due to flare-ups. These
10 patients remained insufficient in their cortisol
production until at least 3.1 ± 2.5 years (mean ±
SD) after the first LDSST.
Discussion
We could verify a high incidence of GC-induced
AI in patients with IBD, in line with earlier stud-
ies.6 This study suggests an association between
GC-induced AI and lower disease activity in
patients with IBD after GC treatment. This is a
novel finding and requires verification in prospec-
tive studies. The association was most obvious in
patients with more severe AI. In line with this,
patients with AI defined by a peak serum cortisol
<550 nmol/L had significantly lower FC values
after GC treatment compared to patients with
normal adrenal function.
The subjects in our study showed a large variabil-
ity in peak cortisol after LDSST (Figure 1). A
plausible explanation for the variability in post-
GC-exposure AI is the wide inter-individual vari-
ability in GC sensitivity.13 Such variability could
also explain the finding that patients with AI after

GC exposure had less inflammatory activity in the
gut as estimated by time to next flare-up and FC,
which may thus imply a stronger anti-inflamma-
tory response to the given standard GC treat-
ment. It is well known that if inflammation
resolves in the gut mucosa it predicts a favorable
clinical outcome in patients with IBD.14 A patient
with a higher GC sensitivity thus has better odds
to achieve mucosal healing.
A recent review thoroughly presents putative
genetic mechanisms for GC resistance in patients
with IBD.15 A decreased response to GCs ­ that is
`GC resistance' ­ is common in inflammatory dis-
eases. For example, 30% of patients with rheuma-
toid arthritis16 and 16­20% of patients with IBD
were reported to be resistant to GC.17,18 Factors
responsible for individual GC sensitivity are ster-
oid bioavailability in the affected organ, GC recep-
tor expression and affinity and GC receptor
signaling.13 Polymorphisms in the GC receptor
gene (NR3C1) may influence the formation of the
GC receptor (GR) and the GR­GC complex and
change the expression of target genes. Several
alterations in the NR3C1 gene have been
described, notably the BclI polymorphism, and
associated to GC response.19 An increased sensi-
tivity to GCs via this polymorphism has been sug-
gested to predict GC treatment response in
children with IBD, but this has not been con-
firmed in other studies.15 Other genes that may
play a role in GC sensitivity are the ARCB1/
MDR1 gene and the IP013 gene, involved in cyto-
plasmic GC transport.15 Furthermore, a gene pol-
ymorphism in the GC-induced transcript 1
(GLCCI1) gene has been related to variable dis-
ease activity and therapeutic response to GC in
asthma and rheumatoid arthritis.13,20 This gene
polymorphism in the GR has not been studied in
patients with IBD.
Despite the established term `steroid-dependent',
which is used to classify patients with IBD in clini-
cal trials,21­23 GC has failed to be effective overall
in patients with CD as a maintenance treatment,24
but this does not rule out the possibility that a sub-
set of patients (who are sensitive to GC) may ben-
efit from such treatment. Perhaps also small doses
(physiological doses) could benefit `glucocorticoid
sensitive' patients in analogy to what we observed
in the patients with GC-induced AI in our study,
where the majority of patients in the group with
more severe AI were on long-term hydrocortisone
treatment. One can also hypothesize that some
patients who are classified as `steroid-dependent'
have GC-induced AI and therefore have difficul-
ties terminating steroid treatment. However, long-
term treatment with GC is also restricted by side
effects such as osteoporosis and infections.25 The
identification of a marker that could determine
whether a patient is sensitive or resistant to GC
treatment early in the course of IBD might improve
tailoring of the treatment for patients with IBD. A
patient with decreased sensitivity to GC treatment
could receive an alternative treatment (immu-
nomodulators or biologics) earlier instead of
repeated courses of GCs; a patient who is sensitive
to GCs could perhaps receive a lower treatment
dose. Interestingly, a pilot study found an associa-
tion between in-vitro measurement of T lympho-
cyte GC sensitivity and clinical response to GCs in
subjects with UC.26 Whether a LDSST or basal
serum cortisol before steroid treatment can predict
GC responsiveness is not known. In contrast, there
was no difference in HPA axis suppressibility
measured by a dexamethasone suppression test,
between GC resistant and sensitive asthma
patients.27 Similar studies are therefore of interest
in subjects with different types of IBD, as there is a
lack of useful predictors for development of AI
after GC therapy.4
The present study confirms the high incidence of
GC-induced AI in patients with IBD seen in other
studies.6,28­31 The present study and others4 also
show that in a substantial number of patients with
induced AI, the subnormal adrenal function per-
sists sometimes for years after the withdrawal of
GC treatment. Desramé and colleagues found a
mean recovery time of adrenal function of 7.2
months (range 1­18 months) using a 250 g
Synacthen test.6 In the present study, using an
LDSST, we found an even longer time to normali-
zation of adrenal function (mean 3.1 years). The
consequence for patients with IBD living with a
dysfunctionalHPAaxiswasstudiedbyMinderhoud
and colleagues.32 The authors found no association
between fatigue in quiescent IBD and AI, but
unfortunately all patients who had taken steroids
within 12 months before the study were excluded,
and only a few patients were assessed by an LDSST.
In some clinical settings, an LDSST for every
patient with IBD treated with GCs may be
impractical; instead, an annual test of baseline
serum cortisol, as has been suggested for
patients with asthma taking inhaled corticoster-
oids, could be feasible. A baseline serum cortisol
A Ibrahim, P Dahlqvist et al.
journals.sagepub.com/home/tag 835
<100 nmol/L strongly suggests the need for oral
hydrocortisone treatment, and a serum cortisol
between 100­348 nmol/L suggests further inves-
tigation with an LDSST.11,33
Limitations
This is a retrospective observational study, and
the decision to test for HPA axis function was
made by clinical judgment and not in a standard-
ized study protocol, which makes it difficult to
control for possible confounders and selection
bias. For example, the patients with replacement
therapy tended to be older and may therefore pre-
sent with a more quiescent disease than younger
patients. As this is a retrospective study, the infor-
mation that stated why the physician had ordered
an LDSST was in most cases lacking and the pre-
cumulative GC doses varied significantly.
The LDSST has a high sensitivity for AI, con-
structed to detect subtle HPA axis insufficiency.11
Therefore, the subtle HPA axis insufficiency
detected in a large proportion of our patients may
have limited clinical implications.
In conclusion, our study verifies that AI after
standard GC treatment for IBD is common.
Importantly, suppression of the HPA axis is asso-
ciated with lower inflammatory activity in the gut.
We suggest that a low threshold to test for AI after
a course of GCs for IBD is informative about the
clinical course, including the possible need for
GC replacement treatment. Prospective studies
are needed to define the clinical consequences of
GC-induced AI in patients with IBD.
