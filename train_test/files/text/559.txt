Although young women now obtain higher course grades in math than boys and are just
as likely to be enrolled in advanced math courses in high school, females continue to be
underrepresented in some Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
occupations. This study drew on expectancy-value theory to assess (1) which intellectual
and motivational factors in high school predict gender differences in career choices and (2)
whether students' motivational beliefs mediated the pathway of gender on STEM career
via math achievement by using a national longitudinal sample in the United States. We
found that math achievement in 12th grade mediated the association between gender and
attainment of a STEM career by the early to mid-thirties. However, math achievement was
not the only factor distinguishing gender differences in STEM occupations. Even though
math achievement explained career differences between men and women, math task value
partially explained the gender differences in STEM career attainment that were attributed to
math achievement. The identification of potential factors of women's underrepresentation
in STEM will enhance our ability to design intervention programs that are optimally tailored
to female needs to impact STEM achievement and occupational choices.

INTRODUCTION
Although girls now obtain higher course grades in math than
boys and are just as likely to be enrolled in advanced math
courses in high school, females continue to be underrepresented in
some Science,Technology,Engineering,and Mathematics (STEM)
occupations (National Science Foundation, 2011). For example,
in 2010 among employed individuals whose highest degree was
a Bachelor's, females comprised around 42% of the workforce
in mathematics, 11% of the workforce in engineering, 23% of
the workforce in computer and information sciences, and 34% of
the workforce in physical sciences (National Science Foundation,
2014).
Career aspirations based on individual competencies, values,
and perceived compatibility of competencies and values, are for-
mulated in adolescence and shape the academic pathways that lead
to the STEM pipeline (Tai et al., 2006). It is very difficult to initiate
a STEM trajectory after beginning college, due to the very con-
strained and prescribed curricula in STEM fields (Tyson, 2011).
Therefore, in order to prevent many talented and capable young
women from opting out of the STEM pipeline, it is important to
identify the intellectual and psychological factors that surface in
the elementary and secondary school years and predict later career
choice (Maltese and Tai,2011; Ceci et al.,2014). In turn, our ability
todesigninterventionprogramstoimpactSTEMachievementand
occupational choices through these factors will be more optimally
tailored to females.
Despite many researchers dedicating themselves to studying
the gender gap in STEM fields, the extant literature is limited in
several ways. Current reform efforts primarily focus on improving
students' exposure to and performance in advanced-level math
courses in high school as a way to address the gender gap in
STEM. While encouraging math achievement and enrollment in
advanced courses is an important step in setting the foundation
for the successful attainment of STEM careers, it alone does not
account for the complex motivational factors that influence STEM
career choice (Eccles, 2009). In fact, neither mathematical apti-
tude, nor advanced math course enrollment are strongly predictive
of student enjoyment in math-related activities or career choice
(Wang and Degol, 2013). Instead, students' motivational beliefs
(e.g., competence beliefs, attitudes, values, interest) about math
learning are more critical determinants of future educational and
career choices (Maltese and Tai, 2010, 2011). While the impor-
tance of motivational beliefs has been widely recognized, most
studies are limited to STEM performance or college major as the
outcome and very few longitudinal studies have addressed the
underlying factors in the high school years that motivate girls to
pursue actual STEM careers in adulthood (Lubinski and Benbow,
2006).
Although ability self-concept (feeling competent to succeed)
has been shown to be an important predictor of academic per-
formance (Guiso et al., 2008; Hill et al., 2010), personal interest
and perceived task value play highly important roles in shap-
ing individual achievement and career choices, and can be
more influential than academic self-concept (Eccles, 2009). For
example, studies show that in early adolescence, girls and boys
tend to endorse different work preferences and lifestyle values
www.frontiersin.org February 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 36 | 1
Wang et al. Gender and STEM
(Ferriman et al., 2009). These personal interests and task values
can rest outside of students' perceptions of their own intellectual
abilities, and may contribute to the gender gaps in STEM perfor-
mance and career choices. However, it is unclear whether students'
motivational beliefs (subjective task values in particular) medi-
ate the relation between gender and STEM career through math
achievement.
In this study, we draw on Eccles' (2009) expectancy-value the-
ory to assess which intellectual competencies and motivational
beliefs move individuals toward or away from STEM careers.
Expectancy-value theory posits that achievement-related choices,
such as occupation selection, are most directly influenced by intel-
lectual competencies, ability self-concepts, and the subjective task
value attached to the various options. Subjective task value is com-
prised of interest value (liking or enjoyment), utility value (the
instrumental value of the task for helping to fulfill personal goals),
attainment value (the link between the task and one's sense of self,
identity, and core personal values), and cost (what may be given up
by making a specific choice). Career choices are ultimately made
after a number of options, and their various components (e.g.,
money, authority, social connection) are evaluated and identified
as either fitting personal goals or not. Gender differences in career
choices reflect gendered differences in relative intellectual compe-
tencies, ability self-concepts, and the relative subjective task value
of each option under consideration.
INTELLECTUAL COMPETENCIES
There are small average gender differences between boys and girls
on some indicators of intellectual competencies: girls outperform
boys in some tests on verbal skills (Park et al., 2008); and girls earn
slightly higher grades in all school subjects, including high school
math and science (Hyde et al., 2008). Furthermore, differences in
the proportion of males and females scoring in the extreme right
tail of high stakes math and reading standardized tests have been
consistently detected. Males outnumber females in the top 0.01%
of the distribution in the SAT and ACT math subtests by 4:1 and
3:1,respectively,whilefemaleshaveaslightadvantageontheverbal
subtests (Wai et al., 2012). These findings lead to the conclusion
that intellectual aptitude, at least by itself, is not the dominant
factor in the underrepresentation of women in STEM fields (Ceci
and Williams, 2010).
ABILITY SELF-CONCEPTS
Expectations for success, confidence in one's abilities to succeed,
and personal efficacy have emerged as important predictors of
academic achievement and activity involvement (Wigfield et al.,
2006). Both boys and girls who rate their math competence highly
are more likely to enroll in advanced math courses and receive
higher grades in math (Pajares, 2005). Additionally, high school
girls tend to rate their math competence lower than boys with sim-
ilar math grades (Correll, 2001); a finding of particular interest
given that poor math self-concept or perceived competence may
play a role in female underperformance in mathematics (Durik
et al., 2006). Yet intellectual competencies or competence beliefs
are a necessary--but not sufficient--predictor of career choices
(Joyce and Farenga, 2000). As suggested by expectancy-value the-
ory, career choices depend not only on confidence in one's abilities
to succeed, but also on subjective task values--the value one
attaches to relevant subject domains and the goals associated with
these domains.
SUBJECTIVE TASK VALUES
Research on subjective task values shows a number of poten-
tially interrelating effects and gender variations. For instance,
despite similarities in math performance, girls' `liking' of math
decreases on average as they move through adolescence to a greater
extent than boys' (Koller et al., 2001). Girls also are more likely to
express greater interest in English than math when compared to
boys (Jacobs et al., 2002). These findings, in combination with
research showing that even females with high math-aptitude tend
to express less interest in math-intensive careers (Lubinski and
Benbow, 2006), suggest that differential interest and task value
in math may contribute to the underrepresentation of women in
STEM fields.
Gender differences in occupational and lifestyle values (forms
of utility and attainment values) are also potentially impor-
tant contributing factors to women's underrepresentation in
STEM fields (Lubinski et al., 2001; Ferriman et al., 2009). For
example, females are typically more interested in socially ori-
ented careers, while males are more interested in working
with objects (Su et al., 2009; Diekman et al., 2011). Mean-
while, women are more likely to value the development of
altruistic, reciprocal relationships more than men (Schwartz
and Rubel, 2005). This phenomena is illustrated by the fact
that women tend to put more value on jobs that allow
them to help others and make meaningful contributions to
society (communion/affiliative orientation; Abele and Spurk,
2011) and math-intensive careers are usually viewed as being
object-oriented (Webb et al., 2002) and less social (Hill et al.,
2010).
Finally, research on how priorities beyond career fulfillment
help shape females'decisions to refrain from entering STEM fields,
indicate that life values and `sense of fit' are important factors.
Per Hakim (2006), women tend to prefer more home-centered
lifestyles, whereas men tend to prefer more work-committed
lifestyles, and math-related careers are not perceived by females
as accommodating to their desired work-family balance. Because
work-familybalanceishighlyrelevanttocareer-agedwomen,most
studies have been conducted with adult females; however, this
gap in the literature makes it unclear whether family work bal-
ance is an important predictor of career choices for high school
students.
The current study investigates (1) which intellectual and moti-
vational factors in high school predict gender differences in career
choices and (2) whether students' motivational beliefs mediated
the pathway of gender on STEM career through math achieve-
ment. Two sets of analyses were conducted to this end. In the
first set of analyses, we used hierarchical logistic regression to test
whether math ability self-concept and subjective task values (i.e.,
math interest, social and family values, and desired job character-
istics) at 12th grade predicted gender differences in the selection
of STEM vs. non-STEM careers, while holding math and reading
ability, and family socioeconomic status constant. In the second
set of analyses, we tested the role of subjective task values and

math achievement as potential mediators for predicting gender
differences in selecting STEM and non-STEM careers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
PARTICIPANTS
We used data from the Longitudinal Study of American Youth,
a large-scale national study initiated in 1987 that followed two
cohorts of students through middle school, high school, and at
various stages beyond high school, focusing predominantly on
student, family, and school characteristics that influence student
achievement, interest, and occupational proclivities toward math
and science. The base-year sample consisted of 3,116 students in
the 7th grade (mean age = 12 years, cohort II) and 2,829 10th
graders (mean age = 15 years, cohort I) from 50 public school sys-
tems across the country. Schools were classified as urban (25%),
suburban (42%), and rural (33%). Selected schools are considered
representative of secondary schools across the country. Each year
participants were given standardized tests of math achievement in
addition to completing questionnaires about their experiences and
attitudesonSTEM-relatedlearning. Readingachievementwasalso
assessed for both cohorts in 12th grade. In 2007, when the original
study participants were between 33 and 37 years of age, a sample
of 3,689 original participants (76% response rate) completed the
telephone interview surveys, updating their educational and occu-
pationalhistoryfromposthighschoolintotheirmid-thirties. Data
used in this study were mainly from two waves: 12th grade and the
2007 follow-up, 14 or 17 years postsecondary school, depending
on the cohort. At 12th grade, 75% were White, and 49% were
female adolescents.
To determine whether the students who participated in 12th
grade differed from those who dropped out between the ages of
33­37, a series of independent samples contingency table anal-
yses and t-tests were conducted with all independent, outcome,
and demographic variables at 12th grade. Results revealed that
those who dropped out of the study did not differ from those who
participated in the study at 12th grade. We used full information
maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation in Mplus 7.3 to account
for missing data in all analysis, as FIML was recommended as the
most appropriate approach to handle missing data when data are
missing at least at random (Allison, 2012).
MEASURES
STEM occupation
Participants' occupations at ages 33­37 were self-reported in a
telephone interview conducted in 2007. We operationalized occu-
pations into two categories: (1) non-STEM, consisting of careers
in the fine arts, literature, business, education, and social sciences,
and (2) STEM jobs, consisting of occupations in mathematics,
engineering, computer science, life science, medical science, and
physical science.
Math and reading achievement
Standardized math scores were used from tests taken by stu-
dents in the spring of 12th grade. The test was developed by the
(National Assessment of Educational Progress [NAEP], 1986) to
measure students' knowledge of math, the application and utiliza-
tion of math knowledge, and integration of math knowledge. A
standardized test of reading developed by the Educational Test-
ing Service was used to measure students' reading comprehension
in the spring of 12th grade. Multiple-group item-response theory
(IRT) methods were used to scale scores on a metric with a mean
of 50 and a SD of 10 (Miller and Kimmel, 2010).
Math ability self-concept
Students completed a survey in the fall of 12th grade indicating
their math ability self-concept. The math ability self-concept scale
(Bleeker and Jacobs, 2004) included three items that measured
students' perceived abilities and expectancy for success in math
(e.g., "I am good at math," "I usually understand math"). The
academic self-concept scale was rated from 1 (strongly disagree) to
5 (strongly agree) with higher scores reflecting higher math ability
self-concept ( = 0.80).
Subjective task values
In the fall of 12th grade, we measured students' interest values,
utility values, and attainment values (Eccles et al., 1997):
Math task value. The math task value scale included five items
that measured students' interest, enjoyment, and the value they
attach to math (e.g., "I enjoy math," "Math is useful in everyday
problems"). The math task value scale was rated from 1 (strongly
disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) with higher scores reflecting higher
task values in math ( = 0.75).
Altruism, family values, and monetary values. Students rated the
relative importance (1 = not important; 2 = somewhat important;
3 = very important) of a variety of future economic, social, and
familial goals. Three separate constructs were generated indicat-
ing the extent to which youth exemplified altruistic values, family
values, and monetary values. A total of four items were used to
indicate the importance students attributed to having an active
role in helping others in their communities, including changing
social/economic wrongs,staying current on social issues,and help-
ing others within the community ( = 0.77). Family values were
constructed using two items that reflected the importance students
attributedtohavingchildrenandprioritizingtheirfamilylifeinthe
future ( = 0.69). Finally, monetary values measured the extent
to which students valued making lots of money in the future.
Higher scores indicate placing greater importance on altruism,
family values, or monetary values.
Work preferences. Students completed a survey indicating quali-
ties of a future career they would find preferable. Students checked
a box to indicate whether they preferred a job with the character-
istics listed (1 = yes; 0 = no). In order to examine the extent to
which youth preferred to work with people or objects, two items
were examined for the absence or presence of a checkmark: prefers
a job that allows work with other people in teams, and prefers a
job that allows work with numbers and formulas. Working with
teams, therefore, represents a people-oriented job focus and work-
ing with numbers and formulas represents an object-oriented job
focus.
Covariates
We controlled for several potential confounds related to individual
career choices in STEM fields, including child gender (0 = female;
www.frontiersin.org February 2015 | Volume 6 | Article 36 | 3
Wang et al. Gender and STEM
1 = male), child race/ethnicity (0 = White; 1 = others), parent
education (0 = some college/HS or less; 1 = BA/BS or higher),
and parent STEM employment (0 = parents do not work in STEM
or technical field; 1 = at least one parent is employed in a STEM
or technical profession). Parental education and employment were
collected from parent reports.
RESULTS
We compared males and females on career choice, covariates, and
independent variables. Chi-square tests were used for dichoto-
mous variables, and independent sample t-tests for continuous
variables (see Table 1). More males chose STEM careers than
females, and preferred to work with numbers. Moreover, males
had higher math achievement, math ability self-concept, math
task value, and a greater preference for high-paying careers. In
contrast, females had higher reading achievement, altruism, and
family values.
We conducted hierarchical logistic regression to examine which
intellectual and motivational factors were predictive of STEM
careers and contributed to gender disparities in selection of STEM
occupations, controlling for child gender and race, parent educa-
tion, and parent STEM employment (see Table 2). All continuous
predictors, including math achievement, reading achievement,
altruism, family values, math ability self-concept, and math task
value, were standardized to have mean of zero and SD of one. All
dichotomous predictors were indicator coded. Variance Inflation
Factor (VIF) was calculated for all predictors and there was no
concern with multicollinearity (VIFs < 2.3).
In the first set of hierarchical logistic regression models,
we included gender as the only predictor to show the gen-
der disparity in STEM occupation. Males were 1.38 times
(p = 0.005) as likely as females to choose STEM careers.
Second, we added student race/ethnicity, parent education,
and parent STEM occupation, which all significantly predicted
STEM occupation (ps < 0.02). The gender effect was still sig-
nificant, but the odds ratio decreased to 1.36 (p = 0.009).
Third, we added math and reading achievement, and found
that only math achievement was significantly related to STEM
occupation. Importantly, the gender effect was reduced to non-
significance. Fourth, we added math ability self-concept and
math task value, in which only math task value was positively
associated with STEM occupation. Fifth, we added altruism,
family values, and monetary importance, with only altruism
negatively predicting STEM occupation. Finally, we added stu-
dent's work preferences (e.g., either working with people or
objects), both of which failed to significantly differentiate career
choices.
In order to test the mediation effect of math task value and
math achievement on gender differences in career choice, we
adopted the outlined procedure in Baron and Kenny (1986). We
first assessed the total direct effect of gender on STEM occupa-
tion with a logistic regression model while partialling out the
effects of such covariates as race, parent education, parent occu-
pation, and reading achievement from STEM occupation. Then
we conducted two path models to tease out the mediation effects
of math achievement, math task values, and altruism on gen-
der difference in STEM occupation, while partialling out the
effects of the covariates from all mediators and STEM occupa-
tion. In the first mediation model (Figure 1A), we tested only
the mediation effect of math achievement. In the second media-
tion model (Figure 1B), we added math task values and altruism
as additional mediators given that the hierarchical logistic regres-
sion results suggested that altruism and math task values were
the only significant motivational predictors of STEM occupa-
tion. A direct relationship was modeled from math task value and
altruismtomathachievement. Thentheindirecteffectsweretested

using bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap confidence
interval (BCI).
The total direct effect of gender on STEM occupation was sig-
nificant, B = 0.36, p = 0.002, odds ratio = 1.43. With math
achievement as the only mediator in the model (Figure 1A), the
direct effect from gender to STEM occupation became not sig-
nificant, B = 0.15, p = 0.21, odds ratio = 1.17. When math
task value and altruism were added as mediators in addition
to math achievement (Figure 1B), the direct effect was further
reduced to B = 0.10, p = 0.41, odds ratio = 1.11. The relative
indirect effect (Huang et al., 2004), loosely interpreted as the pro-
portion of the total effect that is mediated, was calculated to be
1-0.15/0.36 = 0.58 with math achievement as the mediator, and
1-0.10/0.36 = 0.72 with math achievement, math task value, and
altruism as the mediators.
Table 3 presents indirect effects (unstandardized path coef-
ficients) and their BCa BCI. In the first path model, math
achievement significantly mediated the gender difference in STEM
occupation, with the indirect effect estimated to be 0.17 (95%
BCI: 0.11-0.24), indicating that, indirectly via math achieve-
ment, the odds of males choosing STEM occupations increased
by 1.19 times that of females. In the second path model, males
had higher math achievement and math task value, but lower
altruism. Math task value was significantly associated with math
achievement, while altruism was not. Both math task value and
altruism were directly and significantly associated with STEM
occupation, positively for math task value, and negatively for
altruism. We found four significant indirect paths, including:
(1) Gender  Math Task Value  STEM occupation, (2) Gen-
der  Altruism  STEM occupation, (3) Gender  Math Task
Value  Math Achievement  STEM occupation, and (4) Gen-
der  Math Achievement  STEM occupation. The relative
indirect effect indexes were 0.17, 0.06, 0.06, and 0.36 for these
four significant indirect effects. It is noteworthy that math task
value not only mediated the gender difference in STEM occu-
pation, but its positive relationship with math achievement also
accounted partially for the mediating effect of math achievement
onthegendereffect. Byincludingmathtaskvalueandaltruism,the
indirect effect of Gender  Math Achievement  STEM Occu-
pation was reduced from 0.17 to 0.13, with the corresponding
relative indirect effect index reduced from 0.58 to 0.36. How-
ever, the magnitude of the Gender  Math Task Value  Math
Achievement  STEM occupation effect has a small value of 0.02.
This is not surprising given that the effects of race, parent educa-
tion, parent occupation, and reading achievement were controlled
for with all mediators. Results showed that math achievement
was significantly related with gender (B = 0.19, p < 0.001),
race (B = -0.43, p < 0.001), parent education (B = 0.23,
p < 0.001), parent occupation (B = 0.13, p = 0.001), and read-
ing achievement (B = 0.54, p < 0.001). Math task value was
significantly related with gender (B = 0.13, p < 0.001), race
(B = 0.25, p < 0.001), and reading achievement (B = 0.15,
p < 0.001).

ined which factors predicted gender differences in the selection
of STEM occupations, and whether math task values and altru-
ism mediated the pathway of the gender effect on STEM career
choice through math achievement. Identifying potential barriers
that keep women from fulfilling their potential in STEM fields will
help inform intervention efforts targeting the removal of these
barriers.
We found that math achievement in 12th grade mediated the
association between gender and attainment of a STEM career
by the early to mid-thirties. Women were less likely than men
to pursue a career in STEM, but this relation was explained
by gender differences in math achievement in high school. Our
results show that women, on average, had lower math stan-
dardized scores than men, and unsurprisingly, individuals with
higher math achievement were more likely to attain a career
in STEM. However, math achievement was not the only factor
distinguishing gender differences in STEM occupations. Math
task value partially mediated the pathways among gender, math
achievement, and STEM careers. Women had lower math task
values than men, and lower math task value was associated with
lower math achievement and lower likelihood of pursuing STEM
careers. Essentially, despite math achievement explaining career

differences between men and women, math task value also con-
tributed to the gender differences in STEM career attainment
that were attributed to math achievement. These findings shed
some light onto the complex ways that ability self-concept and
subjective task values operate in promoting STEM career selec-
tion. Expectancy-value theory posits that individuals consider
multiple factors when selecting potential careers, including prior
achievement, perceived competencies, and task values. In line
with this theory, math task value and altruism (a form of util-
ity value) predicted STEM career, but math ability self-concept
did not. Previous research has found that ability self-concept is
predictive of academic achievement, but, unlike subjective task
values, it is not consistently linked to educational or career choices
(Durik et al., 2006). In other words, believing that you are good
at a task may further enhance your performance in the task, but
it does not mean that you enjoy the task and will continue to
pursue it.
How do these findings relate to factors associated with females'
underrepresentation in STEM fields? Increasing math achieve-
mentisimportantforincreasingwomen'srepresentationinSTEM,
but achievement alone may not be sufficient. We know that
achievement matters for STEM enrollment; many of the most
mathematically talented individuals eventually achieve prestigious
careers in STEM fields (Wai et al., 2010). Historically, women's
underperformance in quantitative reasoning skills relative to men's
has been considered one of the main factors in women's deci-
sions to opt out of STEM fields (Halpern, 2007). In response,
public focus and political initiatives have centered on increasing
female math performance and advanced math course enrollment.
However, converging evidence from the current study and other
research has demonstrated that increasing quantitative skills alone
will not effectively lead to greater female participation in STEM
(Ceci and Williams, 2011; Maltese and Tai, 2011; Riegle-Crumb
et al., 2012). While gender differences in attainment of STEM
careers was explained by lower female performance on standard-
ized math tests in our first model, the second model demonstrated
that this pathway (gender to achievement to STEM career) was
partially attributed to gender differences in math task values.
Girls consistently express less interest in math (Jacobs et al.,
2002) and view math and STEM careers as less aligned with their
personal career interests and goals (Su et al., 2009). Studies have
shown that greater interest and greater perceived importance and
utility value of math may lead to greater investment in and per-
sistence in math activities, which ultimately lead to higher math
achievement (Wigfield and Eccles, 2002; Wang, 2012). Therefore,
aside from promoting greater math achievement, current policy
initiatives also need to target the development of math task values:
encouraging interest in math and its utility value. When women
see STEM fields as useful, widely applicable, and viable career
options they will be more likely to opt into them.
Given that math interest and task values are linked to aca-
demic performance, the benefits derived from enhancing math
task value may be twofold. If math task values impact math
achievement and selection of STEM occupations, then intervening
to promote subjective task values in math should not only increase
STEM persistence in the long run, but also enhance math achieve-
ment. Since math achievement positively predicted long term
decisions in STEM career, the developmental impacts of interven-
tions that seek to increase math task value could be exponential
compared to programs that target math skills alone. Further-
more, targeting math task values may not only lead to increases in
math achievement, but improved math performance may actually
further enhance math task value, given that the two are recipro-
cally linked over time. Exclusively focusing on math achievement
as a path to STEM persistence is a unimodal answer, while
increasing math task values in addition to achievement is a multi-
modal solution that could activate multiple pathways to a STEM
career.
Furthermore, since our study shows that math task values begin
to predict students' STEM attainment as early as high school,
early intervention is vital. Recent studies have shown that interest
and career aspirations in STEM emerge prior to entry into high
school, and that by 12th grade the decision to major in a STEM vs.
non-STEM career is largely solidified for many students (Maltese
and Tai, 2011). While there are an increasing number of pro-
grams that target student interest, enjoyment, and engagement in
STEM (e.g., Detroit Area Pre-College Engineering Program, Great
Explorations in Math and Science, Project Lead the Way), these
crucial motivating factors should become a greater focus of all k-
12 interventions. Particularly, given that increases in STEM course
taking and achievement among females have not led to compa-
rable increases in STEM workforce participation, programs need
to strengthen teacher training and redesign curriculum to include
targeted strategies for dispelling gender stereotypes and increasing
female interest in STEM.
Our findings suggest that enhancing women's math task value
may be instrumental in inspiring larger numbers of women to
seriously consider STEM fields as viable career options. But
how would this look in practice? We know that students are
more engaged in classrooms that incorporate hands-on learn-
ing, creative thinking, and challenging real-world applications
of problems and concepts (Marks, 2000). For girls and women
in particular, it may be helpful to take a proactive approach
that utilizes their unique strengths. For instance, a recent study
showed that girls are more likely than boys to have both high
verbal and math skills (Wang et al., 2013). Therefore, incor-
porating storytelling into math may not only capitalize on the
strengths of girls' verbal skills but also increase female interest
in math and science by making these subjects appear hands-
on and practical. Additionally, specific teaching strategies such
as focusing on women's historical contributions to these fields,
and increasing girls' exposure and access to female scientists
and engineers as career role models (Steinke et al., 2007), may
help combat the pervasive math-gender stereotypes that affect
girls' math identities as young as 6 years of age (Cvencek et al.,
2011).
Altruism can also be emphasized. Women view helping people
and contributing to the greater good as highly important career
goals (Su et al., 2009; Abele and Spurk, 2011), which are not per-
ceived to be in line with STEM careers. Indeed, our study suggests
that altruism mediated the gender effect on STEM occupations.
Since it is plainly not the goal to make women less altruistic, STEM
educators should place greater emphasis on demonstrating how
female scientists can develop technologies and make discoveries

that greatly benefit people's lives. This is in line with the National
Academy of Engineering [NAE]'s (2013) recent efforts to alter
public perceptions by communicating that engineering is a help-
ing profession that works on solving problems of human health
and safety throughout the world.
Interestingly, differences in family and monetary values, and
preferences for working with people or numbers did not explain
gender differences in STEM careers. The lack of findings for fam-
ily values was not unexpected; previous research has demonstrated
that gender differences in work/family balance preferences do not
typically emerge until the mid-30 s or adulthood, when women
are more likely to be raising children and building their fami-
lies (Ferriman et al., 2009). Since family values were assessed in
12th grade, we can expect that work/family lifestyle preferences
will not yet factor prominently in determining male/female dif-
ferences in STEM choice. Similarly, monetary values may not
have predicted gender differences in career choices at this age,
because much like family values, concern over earned income is
a distal issue that will be experienced more fully in adulthood.
More immediate concerns over money, such as tuition costs and
student loan debt, may have greater bearing in adolescence. Pref-
erences for working with people or numbers, which typically
differ along gender lines, also failed to explain gender differences
in STEM careers. Most occupations allow for the opportunity
to work with people, numbers, and objects to varying degrees.
The key difference is in how prominently these aspects are fea-
tured in a career (e.g., interacting directly with people, such as
teaching vs. interacting directly with numbers, such as engineer-
ing). However, enjoyment of working with numbers does not
necessarily indicate a lack of enjoyment in working with people
and vice versa, and both may be large components of the same
career (e.g., teaching engineering students). For this reason, it is
likely that these preferences may not explain gender differences in
STEM career selection to the same degree as math task value and
altruism.
CONCLUSION
Despite women's advances in the U.S. workforce, their entrance
into lucrative STEM careers has been less successful, and these
professions continue to be heavily male-dominated. The prestige
and innovation surrounding math and science, along with their
accompanying economic benefits, are not extended to women
when they are non-participatory in these fields. Our study builds
on well-established literature by identifying the intellectual and
motivational factors contributing to women's underrepresenta-
tion in STEM. However, it is important to reiterate that generating
greater female interest in STEM should not be equated with
forcing unwanted career choices on them. We do not want to
coerce women into STEM fields if they have no interest in them,
and we do not want to undermine the importance and value
of non-STEM careers. Instead, we seek to alter instructional
approaches to math and science education to demonstrate how
STEM careers can benefit society and provide opportunities for
helping and interacting with others, thereby, merging women's
personal task values and career aspirations. Furthermore, many
adolescents may not truly understand what it means to obtain a
degree in STEM (Fralick et al., 2009). Introducing youth to the
different majors they can pursue in STEM and the careers that
these degrees will prepare them for can provide adolescents with
a better understanding of the nature of these occupations. Ensur-
ing that females are well informed of the full diversity of options
available in STEM will enable math-competent females to better
evaluate the utility and cost of different STEM careers. Our main
goals are to present all of the STEM career opportunities avail-
able to women, remove misconceptions that operate as barriers
to STEM enrollment, and empower women to make career deci-
sions that best meet their needs for personal and occupational
fulfillment.
