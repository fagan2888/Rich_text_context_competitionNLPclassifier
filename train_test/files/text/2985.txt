MANY, BUT NOT ALL, EPIDE-
miological studies have
suggested that serum uric
acidisariskfactorforcar-
diovascular disease.1-9 Increased serum
uricacidlevelsarelinkedtoobesity,dys-
lipidemia, and hypertension (insulin re-
sistanceorsyndromeX),allofwhichare
also associated with increased risk for
cardiovascular disease.3 However, the
specific role of serum uric acid in this
constellation remains uncertain.10
An earlier report, based on the First
National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey (NHANES I) Epidemio-
logic Follow-up Study (NHEFS), 1971-
1987,8 indicated that baseline serum
uric acid level was an independent pre-
dictor of mortality and, particularly, of
ischemic heart disease death but only
for women. Recently, a study gener-
ated from Framingham Heart Study
data reported that by controlling for
other risk factors, the apparent rela-
tionship of uric acid to cardiovascular
or all-cause mortality was not sus-
tained.9 The authors concluded that use
of diuretics was the covariate most re-
sponsible for reducing the statistical sig-
nificance of serum uric acid to cardio-
vascular outcome.9
To further explore the now unre-
solved relationship of serum uric acid
to cardiovascular disease, we report on
an extension of the NHEFS from 1987
to 1992. The additional 5 years of fol-
low-up has nearly doubled the num-
ber of deaths (892 to 1593) available
for analysis.8 This updated report ex-
tends the earlier study of the associa-
tion of serum uric acid levels with car-
diovascular mortality and ischemic
heart disease mortality in men and
women and, for the first time, exam-
ines this relationship separately for
blacks and whites, accounting for di-
uretic use, cardiovascular risk profile,
and menopausal status among women.
METHODS
Study Design
The NHANES I, sponsored by the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics, was
conducted from 1971 to 1975 on a na-
tionwide probability sample of the US
civilian noninstitutionalized popula-
tion. The survey included a standard-
ized medical examination and question-

Context Although many epidemiological studies have suggested that increased se-
rum uric acid levels are a risk factor for cardiovascular mortality, this relationship re-
mains uncertain.
Objective To determine the association of serum uric acid levels with cardiovascu-
lar mortality.
Design and Setting Cross-sectional population-based study of epidemiological fol-
low-up data from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES
I) from 1971-1975 (baseline) and data from NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study
(NHEFS).
Participants A total of 5926 subjects who were aged 25 to 74 years and had serum
uric acid level measurements at baseline.
Main Outcome Measures Ischemic heart disease mortality, total cardiovascular
mortality, and all-cause mortality, compared by quartiles of serum uric acid level.
Results In an average of 16.4 years of follow-up, 1593 deaths occurred, of which 731
(45.9%) were ascribed to cardiovascular disease. Increased serum uric acid levels had a
positive relationship to cardiovascular mortality in men and women and in black and white
persons. Deaths due to ischemic heart disease in both men and women increased when
serum uric acid levels were in the highest quartile compared with the lowest quartile (men,
416 vs 321 µmol/L; risk ratio, 1.77 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.08-3.98]; women,
333 vs 238 µmol/L; risk ratio, 3.00 [95% CI, 1.45-6.28]). Cox regression analysis
showed that for each 59.48-µmol/L increase in uric acid level, cardiovascular mortality
and ischemic heart disease mortality increased. Hazard ratios for men were 1.09 (95%
CI, 1.02-1.18) and 1.17 (95% CI, 1.06-1.28), and for women were 1.26 (95% CI, 1.16-
1.36) and 1.30 (95% CI, 1.17-1.45), respectively, after adjustment for age, race, body
mass index, smoking status, alcohol consumption, cholesterol level, history of hyperten-
sion and diabetes, and diuretic use. Further analysis, stratifying by cardiovascular risk sta-
tus, diuretic use, and menopausal status, confirmed a significant association of uric acid
and cardiovascular mortality in all subgroups except among men using diuretics (n=79)
and men with 1 or more cardiovascular risk factors (n=1140).
Conclusion Our data suggest that increased serum uric acid levels are indepen-
dently and significantly associated with risk of cardiovascular mortality.

naires that addressed a variety of health-
related topics. Low-income persons, the
elderly, and women of childbearing age
were oversampled. The total NHANES
I sample included 20729 persons aged
25 to 74 years, of whom 14407 (70%)
were medically examined. A sub-
sample of 6913, the "detailed sample,"
were examined in greater depth, which
rendered additional data including se-
rum uric acid levels.11
NHEFS is a longitudinal follow-up of
participantsinNHANESIwhowereaged
25 to 74 years at the time of survey. The
personal interviews and physical and
laboratory examinations of NHANES I
provided the baseline data for NHEFS.
Among 6913 subjects in the de-
tailed sample, information on serum
uric acid was available in 6651. Of these,
subjects were excluded if they re-
ported myocardial infarction, stroke,
and gout or were pregnant at baseline
(439); if their racial or ethnic back-
ground was other than non-Hispanic
white or non-Hispanic black (63); and
if their vital status was missing in the
1992 follow-up (223). The remaining
5926 are the subjects of this analysis.
Baseline Measurements
Blood samples were obtained from non-
fasting persons, and frozen serum was
sent to the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention for analysis. Se-
rum uric acid was measured using an
automated colorimetric phosphotung-
stic acid procedure, which had been
validated against a uricase assay, on a
Technicon SMA 12-60 (Technicon In-
struments, Tarrytown, NY). The base-
line medical history questionnaire pro-
vided information about history of
selected conditions, eg, diabetes, heart
disease, hypertension, and gout, as well
as history of using any medicine. At the
beginning of the baseline physical ex-
amination, blood pressure was mea-
sured by a physician once while the ex-
aminee was seated. Smoking status and
the number of cigarettes smoked for
current smokers were obtained at base-
line for 50% of the detailed subsample
of 6913. For the remaining persons,
smoking status at baseline was deter-
mined by questionnaire in the 1982 to
1984 follow-up interview on lifetime
smoking history, which applied to both
subject and surrogate interview. The va-
lidity of this approach has been docu-
mented.12,13 The smoking status infor-
mation used in this analysis therefore
combines the 2 interviews, which in-
creased the available information on
smoking to more than 95% of the study
population. Current smoking was de-
fined as answering yes to both ques-
tions, "Did you ever smoke at least 100
cigarettes or more in your lifetime?"
and, "Do you smoke cigarettes now?"
For women, pregnancy and menstrual
cycle status also were obtained from the
medical history. Menopause was de-
fined by the answer "yes" for the ques-
tion,"Havethecyclesentirelystopped?"
Of note is the missing data for some im-
portant baseline characteristics. For ex-
ample, serum creatinine concentra-
tion was absent in about 60% of records,
and menopause status information was
missing for about 60% of women.
Outcome Measures
Follow-up data, based on interviews,
health care facility medical records, and
death certificates, were collected in 4
waves of follow-up: 1982 to 1984, 1986,
1987, and 1992.14 Death was ascer-
tained by either death certificate, a
proxy interview, or both. In the former
case, the underlying cause of death was
coded according to the International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revi-
sion (ICD-9). Deaths were analyzed for
all causes, total cardiovascular disease
(ICD-9 codes 390-459), and ischemic
heart disease (ICD-9 codes 410-414).
Years of follow-up for each individual
were calculated from baseline to the
date of death for decedents and to the
date of follow-up for those still alive.
Statistical Analysis
Subjects were then stratified into quar-
tiles of baseline serum uric acid level
by sex. The baseline characteristics of
continuous variables were measured by
quartiles of serum uric acid level, and
the differences across quartiles were
tested with analysis of variance for men
and women separately. For dichoto-
mous variables, such as history of dis-
ease, diuretic use, and substance abuse,
the mean levels of uric acid were mea-
sured for each group ("yes" vs "no").
Statistical significance was tested us-
ing the t test, specifying by sex and race.
Age- and race-adjusted ischemicheart
disease mortality rates, expressed as per
1000 person-years, were calculated for
each quartile of serum uric acid for both
sexes, using the direct method of stan-
dardization with the total sample serv-
ingasthestandardpopulation.Themor-
tality ratio, using the lowest quartile as
reference for each other quartile of se-
rum uric acid, was calculated with Man-
tel-Haenszel method. Cox propor-
tional hazard regression models were
used separately to examine the relation-
ship of serum uric acid levels to all-
cause, total cardiovascular, and ische-
micheartdiseasemortality,adjustingfor
baseline characteristics. Separate mod-
els for sex- and race-specific analysis
werealsoproduced.Theseanalyseswere
adjusted for age, race, body mass in-
dex, cholesterol level, smoking status,
alcohol consumption, and history of hy-
pertension and diabetes. The adjusted
hazard ratios were for each 59.48-
µmol/L difference in serum uric acid
level. The interaction term of uric acid
level and diuretic use was tested in the
Cox regression models.
The association of mortality to se-
rum uric acid level was also estimated
after stratifying by age into 3 groups
(45, 45-54, and 55 years), as well as
by cardiovascular risk status (those with
any 1 of the risk factors: hypertension
[with history of hypertension, blood
pressure 160/95 mm Hg, or taking
antihypertensive medication], choles-
terol level 6.35 mmol/L [245
mg/dL]; with history of diabetes; and
those with any 2 of these conditions; as
well as those without any of these
conditions).Theinteractiontermofuric

tially increased uric acid level after
menopause,4,8 were stratified into 2
groups by menopausal status for those
(n=1092) in whom menopausal infor-
mation was available. Cox regression
models were used to determine the re-
lationship of serum uric acid levels to
cardiovascular mortality in each strati-
fiedgroup.Othercardiovascularriskfac-
tors adjusted for in these models were
age, race, body mass index,smokingsta-
tus, and alcohol consumption.
RESULTS
Serum Uric Acid Levels
The mean age of the study population
was 48.1 years. The mean (SD) serum
uric acid level was 327 (86) µmol/L
(range, 42-744 µmol/L). Men had sig-
nificantly higher uric acid levels than
women (370 vs 291 µmol/L, P.001),
and black persons had significantly
higher levels than white persons (340
vs 325 µmol/L, P.001). The mean lev-
els of serum uric acid increased with
age, from 316 µmol/L among those
younger than 45 years to 340 µmol/L
among those older than 65 years
(P.001).
In general, among both men and
women, the higher quartiles of serum
uric acid levels were associated with in-
creasing blood pressure, cholesterol lev-
els, and body mass index (TABLE 1). Of
particular note is the different age dis-
tribution by quartile for men and
women. For men, age was similar
throughout the quartiles, but for
women, age increased from the lower
to higher quartiles. Serum creatinine
levels, which were measured in 2267
of the total of 5926 subjects, were as-
sociated with serum uric acid. Creati-
nine levels by uric acid quartile were
95.5 (1.08), 97.2 (1.10), 97.2 (1.10),
and 104.3 µmol/L (1.18 mg/dL) for men
(P.001), and 79.6 (0.90), 83.1 (0.94),
84.9 (0.96), 96.4 µmol/L (1.09 mg/dL)
for women (P.001).
Serum uric acid levels were substan-
tially higher among persons reporting
diuretic use within the past 30 days, or
alcohol use (at least twice a week) for
the 4 race and sex groups (TABLE 2).

Subjects with a history of hyperten-
sion had a significantly higher serum
uric acid level than those who did not,
except for black women (P = .21),
among whom this difference did not
reach statistical significance. Women
with diabetes, but not men, had higher
serum uric acid levels than those with-
out it (307 vs 288 µmol/L, white wom-
en; 343 vs 309 µmol/L for black
women). Neither those currently smok-
ing nor those who ever smoked more
than 100 cigarettes were associated with
increased serum uric acid levels. His-
tory of kidney disease was not associ-
ated with serum uric acid level.
Mortality
During an average of 16.4 years of fol-
low-up(18.5years,survivors;10.9years,
decedents),1593persons(26.9%)inthe
study group died. Of the total deaths,
731 (45.9%) were ascribed to cardio-
vascular disease (ischemic heart dis-
ease, 421; stroke, 111; and other car-
diovasculardeaths,199),and429deaths
(26.9%) were cancer related.
Overall, crude all-cause and cardio-
vascular mortality rates were 16.4
(1593/97288) and 7.5 (731/97288) per
1000 person-years, respectively. Black
persons had substantially higher crude
mortality rates than did white persons
(25.6 [282/11009] vs 15.2 [1311/
86279], all-cause; and 11.5 [127/
11009] vs 7.0 [604/86279], cardiovas-
cular mortality, respectively).
Compared with the lowest quartile of
uric acid level, age- and race-adjusted
death rates for ischemic heart disease
weresignificantlyhigherinquartile4for
both men and women. In fact, the is-
chemic heart disease mortality rate in-
creased 77% for men (from 4.59 to 8.14
per 1000 person-years, P=.01), and
3-fold for women (from 2.02 to 6.05,
P.001) for serum uric acid level from
quartile 1 to quartile 4 (TABLE 3). Al-
though the mortality rate increased by
50% among women in quartile 3, it did
notreachstatisticalsignificance(P=.35).
Age-adjusted cause-specific death
rates for all races, as well as between
races separately, revealed that total car-
diovascular mortality was highest in the
highest serum uric acid level quartile
for all subjects, with the steepest rise
in rates for black women (FIGURE 1).
This was also true for ischemic heart
disease (data not provided).
In separate multivariate Cox regres-
sion analyses, the association of se-
rum uric acid level and all-cause, total
cardiovascular, and ischemic heart dis-
ease mortality rates were estimated,
controlling for age, race, body mass in-
dex, cholesterol level, smoking status,
alcohol consumption, history of hyper-
tension and diabetes, and diuretic use.
For example, with each 59.48-µmol/L
increase in serum uric acid level, the
hazard ratio of cardiovascular disease
and ischemic heart disease mortality
were 1.09 (95% confidence interval
[CI], 1.02-1.18) and 1.17 (95% CI,
1.06-1.28) for men, and 1.26 (95% CI,
1.16-1.36) and 1.30 (95% CI, 1.17-
1.45) for women, respectively
(FIGURE 2). This association was also
found for all-cause mortality. Further
stratification of subjects by race showed
the above associations were observed
for both white and black persons. For
each 59.48-µmol/L increase in serum
uric acid, hazard ratios and 95% CIs of

black men and women were 1.19 (95%
CI, 1.00-1.42) and 1.38 (95% CI, 1.14-
1.68) and for white men and women
were 1.10 (95% CI, 1.02-1.18) and 1.26
(95% CI, 1.16-1.38), respectively.
Cox regression models were also con-
structed for those 2267 subjects with
serum creatinine levels available (car-
diovascular disease deaths, n=192).
Controlling for risk factors cited above,
plus serum creatinine, the hazard ra-
tio for cardiovascular disease mortal-
ity for each 59.48- µmol/L increasing
level in serum uric acid was 1.21 (95%
CI, 1.11-1.34).
Stratification by age (45, 45-54, and
55 years) influenced the predictive
value of serum uric acid level for car-
diovascular mortality (FIGURE 3). In
multivariate analysis, increased serum
uric acid levels were not associated with
cardiovascular mortality in men and
women younger than 45 years. How-
ever, for those aged 45 years and older,
increased serum uric acid levels were re-
lated to higher cardiovascular mortal-
ity. For both men and women, the risk
of increased serum uric acid levels for
cardiovascular mortality was highest for
those aged 45 to 54 years. For ex-
ample, among that age group, an in-
creaseof59.48µmol/Linserumuricacid
level predicted an increase in cardiovas-
cular mortality rate of 28% (95% CI,
1.08-1.52) in men and 43% (95% CI,
1.16-1.77) in women. For those aged 55
years and older, the predictive value of
increasing serum uric acid level fell to
11% (95% CI, 1.02-1.20) for men and
26% (95% CI, 1.16-1.37) for women.
Among women aged 45 years and older
whose menopausal status was avail-
able, adjusting with menopausal status
did not change the predictive value of
serum uric acid level (Figure 3).
The interaction of uric acid levels and
diuretic use was not significantly asso-
ciated with cardiovascular mortality.
Nevertheless, the study population
was further stratified by cardiovascular
risk profile, by diuretic use, and by
women with known menopausal sta-
tus (TABLE 4). For women, in all sub-
groups, uric acid was a significant pre-
dictor of total cardiovascular mortality.
Of note is that among women using di-
uretics, the risk of cardiovascular mor-
tality for a 59.48-µmol/L increase in se-
rum uric acid levels was higher than for
those not using diuretics (1.47 vs 1.30).
The risk of a high uric acid level for car-
diovascular mortality was substan-
tially higher among menstruating
women than postmenopausal women
(hazard ratio, 1.51 vs 1.29). For men,
hazard ratios were lower than for
women in all subgroups. In addition,
among men with increasing cardiovas-
cular risk (2 and more risk factors,
n=384; 1 risk factor, n=756), as well
as those small number of persons us-
ing diuretics (n=79), there was no as-
sociation between serum uric acid level
and cardiovascular mortality.
COMMENT
In this representative general popula-
tion, serum uric acid level bore a con-
tinuous, independent, specific, and
significant positive relationship to car-
diovascular mortality. This association
was true for men and women and for
blacks and whites. The impact of se-
rum uric acid level on cardiovascular
mortality in different age groups varied
bysex.Inneithermennorwomen,how-
ever,wastheassociationmanifestinper-
sonsyoungerthan45yearsold.Forboth
men and women, the highest risk of an
increased serum uric acid level was be-
tween the ages of 45 and 54 years.
Among women, this association was
more robust than in men and persisted
through all levels of cardiovascular risk,
regardless of diuretic use or meno-
pausal status. Among men at high car-
diovascular risk and the rather small
group taking diuretics, there was no as-
sociation of serum uric acid to cardio-
vascular mortality.
These results are consistent with and
extend an earlier, shorter follow-up of
the NHANES I population. That study,
based on 1987 NHANES I Epidemio-
logicFollow-upStudydata,showed that
an increased serum uric acid level was
an independent predictor of all-cause
and ischemic heart disease mortality for
women only.8 The ischemic heart dis-
ease mortality rate among women with
a serum uric acid level of 416 µmol/L
or more was almost 5-fold greater than
for those with a level less than 238
µmol/L. This study, using the same
baseline cohort, with nearly twice the

number of events (1593 vs 892) over a
longer follow-up period (18.5 years vs
13.5 years for survivors), shows that the
association of increased serum uric acid
levels and cardiovascular mortality ex-
ists in most men as well. These data are
consistent with a variety of other stud-
ies suggesting that an elevated serum
uric acid level is an independent risk
factorforcardiovascular mortality in the
general population.1,2,4,8
Thesedatahavealsoprovidedthefirst
opportunity to explore the relation-
ship between serum uric acid level and
cardiovasculardiseaseseparatelyinblack
and white populations. The 729 black
subjects (12.3%) had serum uric acid
levelsthatwerehigherthaninwhitesub-
jects, and the relative risk of an el-
evated serum uric acid level was greater
in black persons than in white persons.
After controlling for potential risk
factors, the association of serum uric
acid levels with cardiovascular mortal-
ity persisted. Even among subjects with
low cardiovascular risk (ie, those with-
out an increased cholesterol level, hy-
pertension, or diabetes), we found that
increased serum uric acid levels were
a predictor of cardiovascular mortal-
ity. This association is unlikely to be
confounded by other factors in these
low-risk subjects.
Recently, Culleton et al,9 using
FraminghamHeartStudydata,reported
that an elevated serum uric acid level at
baseline was not independently associ-
ated with increased risk of cardiovascu-
lar mortality. They concluded that the
apparent association of serum uric acid
to cardiovascular events was probably
due to confounding by other cardiovas-
cularriskfactors,particularlybydiuretic
use. In our study, however, both after
stratification and multivariate analysis,
diuretic use only affected the associa-
tion of serum uric acid level with mor-
tality in the 84 men taking diuretics.
The different results seen in these 2
studies may be due to differences in the
populations studied. The homoge-
neous Framingham population is al-
most exclusively white, while NHANES
is a vastly more heterogeneous repre-
sentation of the US population; 12.3%
of the study subjects were black. Al-
though follow-up was similar (17.3 vs
16.4 years), the mortality rates be-
tween the 2 studies differed. Most no-
tably, NHANES participants had a sub-
stantially higher all-cause mortality rate
(16.4 vs 12.4 per 1000 person-years),
and they had a higher cardiovascular
mortality rate (7.5 vs 3.7 per 1000 per-
son-years) than did Framingham resi-
dents. Even among whites only, the
NHANES population had substan-
tially higher crude all-cause mortality
rate (15.2 vs 12.4 per 1000 person-
years), as well as a crude cardiovascu-
lar disease mortality rate (7.0 vs 3.7 per
1000 person-years) than did Framing-
ham residents. That cardiovascular
mortality was twice as frequent in the
NHANES population than in the
Framingham study provides strong evi-
dence that the 2 populations are not the
same. These population differences may
have substantially influenced the dif-
ferent results observed. Besides differ-
ences in survival rates, the 2 groups dif-
fered in mean age, with NHANES
participants being slightly older than
Framingham residents (48.3 vs 47
years), and age influenced the relation-
ship of uric acid levels to cardiovascu-
lar disease mortality.
The question then is how to inter-
pret these conflicting results. Both stud-
ies have strong internal validity. Thereal
issue therefore may be which of the 2
studies has greater general applicabil-
ity. We would argue that NHANES,
which represents the total US popula-
tion, may have broaderrelevance. Inany
event, no single observational study can,
by itself, finally settle the issue. How-
ever, the findings in this large national
sample, together with that of other stud-
ies with similar findings,1-8,10 suggests
that perhaps failure to identify an asso-
ciation in Framingham may be an ex-
ception, rather than the rule.
Uric acid is the major product of pu-
rine metabolism and is formed from
xanthine by the action of xanthine oxi-
dase. The normal limits of serum uric
acid are between 387 and 416 µmol/L
in men and lower than 327 µmol/L in
women.15 Hyperuricemia is usually de-
fined as a serum uric acid level of 416
µmol/L or higher in men, and 357
µmol/L or higher in women.16,17 After
menopause, values for women in-
crease. In adults, serum uric acid lev-
els vary with height, body weight, blood
pressure, renal function, and alcohol in-

take.18 Serum uric acid concentration
is influenced by the rate of production
on the one hand,19 and the rate of elimi-
nation on the other.20 The changing
level of serum uric acid concentration
in women at menopause suggests an in-
teraction with sex hormones.4
Besidesgout,hyperuricemiaisrelated
to a variety of other conditions includ-
ingincreasedalcoholconsumption,obe-
sity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hyper-
tension, renal disease, ischemic heart
disease, and diuretic use.3,18-26 More
recently,ithasbeennotedthatthemain
associates of hyperuricemia are identi-
cal to the components of insulin resis-
tancesyndrome.Perhapstheincreasein
serumuricacidlevelsmaybeanexpres-
sion of an insulin-resistant state.23 This
is supported by evidence that increased
serum uric acid levels correlate with
decreased insulin-stimulated glucose
uptake and increased plasma insulin
response to oral glucose loading.27-29
Among women, we found a strong
association between increased uric acid
levels and cardiovascular mortality,
even after stratifying by diuretic use and
menopausal status. The mechanism of
higher risk of increasing uric acid level
among menstruating women com-
pared with postmenopausal women
cannot be explained by the available
data. Perhaps increasing uric acid level
after menopause influences outcome.
The vital question is whether in-
creased serum uric acid is a causal fac-
tor for cardiovascular disease. Obser-
vational data alone cannot answer that
question. However, serum uric acid may
be involved in platelet adhesiveness, ag-
gregation, or inflammation30-32 and may
be implicated in the genesis of hyper-
tension.33
The limitations of this study in-
cluded loss to follow-up, missing base-
line data, and the lack of information
on potentially important characteris-
tics such as fasting plasma glucose and
insulin concentration. It is also likely
that there have been errors in measure-
ment of baseline variables and misclas-
sification of mortality due to inaccu-
racy of diagnoses coded on death
certificates. The study is strengthened
by carefully standardized methods, long
follow-up, a large number of events, and
mortality as end point.
Insummary,webelievethatthesedata
add to the large body of literature sup-
portingastrong,significant,specific,and
independent association of serum uric
acid to cardiovascular mortality. This
association is stronger among women
thanmenandamongblacksthanwhites,
anditisindependentofdiureticuse,car-
diovascular risk status, or menopausal
status.Themechanismsbywhichhyper-
uricemia might be linked to heart dis-
ease are unknown. Nevertheless, we
believe the available data, when consid-
ered in total, favor the view that serum
uric acid is a useful contributor to the
determination of cardiovascular risk.
