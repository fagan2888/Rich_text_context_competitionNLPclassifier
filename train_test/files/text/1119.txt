BACKGROUND: It is widely known that more boys are born during and immediately after wars, but there has not
been any ultimate (evolutionary) explanation for this `returning soldier effect'. Here, I suggest that the higher sex
ratios during and immediately after wars might be a byproduct of the fact that taller soldiers are more likely to
survive battle and that taller parents are more likely to have sons. METHODS: I analyze a large sample of British
Army service records during World War I. RESULTS: Surviving soldiers were on average more than one inch
(3.33 cm) taller than fallen soldiers. CONCLUSIONS: Conservative estimates suggest that the one-inch height advan-
tage alone is more than twice as sufficient to account for all the excess boys born in the UK during and after World
War I. While it remains unclear why taller soldiers are more likely to survive battle, I predict that the returning
soldier effect will not happen in more recent and future wars.

The puzzle: the `returning soldier effect'
It has been widely observed that more boys than usual are born
during and immediately after the World Wars in most of the
belligerent nations (James, 1987, pp. 733­734). Cartwright
(2000, p. 121) dubs this phenomenon as the `returning
soldier effect'.
MacMahon and Pugh (1954) were among the first to observe
the effect. They demonstrate that the sex ratio among whites in
the USA rose during World War II, but not during World War I.
Others have since documented the phenomenon repeatedly
(Lowe and McKeown, 1951; van der Broek, 1997; Ellis and
Bonin, 2004). In one of the most comprehensive demon-
strations, Graffelman and Hoekstra (2000) conclusively show
that the secondary sex ratio (sex ratio of live births) increased
during and immediately after World Wars in all belligerent
nations (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the
Netherlands, USA and UK), except for Italy and Spain. In
the succinct words of the scientist who has studied sex ratios
(of both humans and other animals) more than anybody else,
`there can be no reasonable doubt that sex ratios (proportions
male at birth) have risen during and just after major wars'
(James, 2003, p. 1133).
While there may be no reasonable doubt that the pheno-
menon exists, there are no satisfactory explanations for it.
In particular, to the best of my knowledge, few have proposed
an ultimate (evolutionary) explanation for the increased
number of boys born during and immediately after wars. One
attempt at an ultimate explanation is the view that sons have
greater expected reproductive success than daughters during
and immediately after wars in which many men die (Trivers,
1985, pp. 286­288; Bisioli, 2004). It is impossible for
parents to know how long the war (or any other situation of
greater male mortality) will last. If the war lasts longer than,
say, 15 years, long enough for the newborn boys to reach
sexual maturity, then parents who have more sons may on
average achieve greater inclusive fitness than parents who
have more daughters.
Some offer proximate explanations of the returning soldier
effect. Grant's (1998, 2003) `maternal dominance hypothesis'
contends, first, that the mother, not the father, determines the
sex of the offspring and, second, that dominant, `tough'
women high in testosterone are more likely to have sons.
With respect to the returning soldier effect, Grant (1998,
pp. 156­163) argues that women become `tougher' during
wars because they have to take over some of the traditionally
male roles in society in the absence of men, and they as a
result have more boys presumably because their testosterone
levels increase during wars. However, there is very little

human evidence for the maternal dominance hypothesis in
general, and as an explanation for the returning soldier effect
in particular. It also cannot explain why the secondary sex
ratio remains high for a few years after the end of the war.
James (2003) offers an alternative proximate mechanism.
During wars, couples are reunited only during short leaves
from the armed services. They are expected to have frequent
intercourse during such short leaves and, as a result, more
likely to conceive during the early phase of the cycle, when
the estrogen/gonadotrophin ratio in women is high. Mamma-
lian (including human) sex ratio is higher when the maternal
estrogen level is higher at the time of conception (James,
1996). Hence, couples who have high frequencies of intercourse
(such as briefly reunited soldiers on short leaves and their wives)
are more likely to conceive sons. While very plausible on the
surface, James' (2003) proximate explanation currently lacks
empirical support, including rigorous quantitative evidence
for the crucial assumption that coital frequency is higher
during wartime and remains high for a few years afterwards
[although James (1981, 1983) provides indirect evidence].
Thus the puzzle remains: Why (as opposed to how) are
more boys born during and immediately after wars? What
ultimate mechanism can account for it?
Before going further, it is important to point out that, while
there is indeed no reasonable doubt that more boys are born
during and immediately after wars, and the absolute number
of excess boys is large in large populations, the relative increase
in the secondary sex ratio is very small. For example,
MacMahon and Pugh (1954) report that the sex ratio among
whites in the USA increased from the baseline of 51.406 to
51.481 during 1942­1946. In other words, during World War
II, the sex ratio increased by three-quarters of a 10th of a boy
per 100 births.
Graffelman and Hoekstra's (2000) more recent and compre-
hensive analysis of all belligerent nations in both World Wars
produces the same results. For example, in the UK, the baseline
sex ratio during peacetime is 51.2 (Graffelman and Hoekstra,
2000, p. 439, Table 1). This increases to 51.365 during
wartime (1914­1920, 1939­1948). In terms of odds ratio,
this translates into an increase in odds of having a boy by
only 0.7% (the odds of having a boy during peacetime:
0.512/0.488 ¼ 1.049; the odds of having a boy during
wartime: 0.51365/0.48635 ¼ 1.056; the wartime increase in
odds: 1.056/1.049 ¼ 1.007).
Generalized Trivers­Willard hypothesis (gTWH)
In their classic paper, Trivers and Willard (1973) suggest that
parents might under some circumstances be able to vary the
sex ratio of their offspring in order to maximize their reproduc-
tive success. The Trivers­Willard hypothesis (TWH) proposes
that, for all species for which male fitness variance exceeds
female fitness variance, male offspring of parents in better
material condition are expected to have greater reproductive
success than their female siblings, because their greater size
allows them to outcompete their intrasexual rivals and mono-
polize available reproductive opportunities. The converse is
true of offspring of parents in poorer material and nutritional
condition, because smaller males, who are not intrasexually
competitive, are excluded from mating opportunities. Parental
condition affects the reproductive prospects of female off-
spring to a much lesser extent. Almost all females get to repro-
duce some offspring, even though no female can produce a
large number due to their greater obligatory investment into
each offspring (Trivers, 1972).
While the TWH in its original formulation has specifically to
do with material (and, for humans, economic) condition of
parents and their ability to vary the sex ratio of their offspring
in response to such condition, the basic insight behind it may be
more general. The fundamental assumption underlying the
TWH is that if males are expected to attain greater reproductive
success than females, for whatever reason, then parents may
have more sons than daughters. If, in contrast, females are
expected to attain greater reproductive success than males,
for whatever reason, then parents may have more daughters
than sons. While female fitness variance is much smaller
than male fitness variance among mammalian species, there
is still variance among females, and some women do better
than others, in terms of the quality, if not quantity, of their
offspring.
Kanazawa (2005) thus proposes the gTWH:
gTWH: parents who possess any heritable trait which
increases male reproductive success at a greater rate (or
decreases male reproductive success at a smaller rate) than
female reproductive success in a given environment will have
a higher-than-expected offspring sex ratio (more males).
Parents who possess any heritable trait which increases
female reproductive success at a greater rate (or decreases
female reproductive success at a smaller rate) than male repro-
ductive success in a given environment will have a
lower-than-expected offspring sex ratio (more females).
Unlike Grant's (1998, 2003) maternal dominance hypo-
thesis, the gTWH is completely mute on which parent deter-
mines or influences the sex of the offspring. There has been
emerging evidence for the gTWH with respect to a variety of
heritable traits which increase the reproductive success of off-
spring of one sex or the other (see Kanazawa, 2007, for review).
One of these heritable traits which has been shown to affect
secondary sex ratios is body size: big and tall parents are more
likely to have sons (Kanazawa, 2005). Taller men have greater
reproductive success than shorter men (Pawlowski et al., 2000;
Nettle, 2002a), but shorter women have greater reproductive
success than taller women (Nettle, 2002b). And body size
(height and weight) is substantially heritable (Chambers
et al., 2001; Silventoinen et al., 2001). The gTWH would there-
fore predict that taller and heavier parents will have a
higher-than-expected number of sons, and shorter and lighter
parents will have a lower-than-expected number of sons (or a
higher-than-expected number of daughters).
If this finding is generalizable, then it can potentially
provide an ultimate explanation for biased sex ratios, including
society-wide patterns like the returning soldier effect. If the
population distribution of any of the relevant traits (any herita-
ble trait that has a sexually dimorphic effect on the reproduc-
tive success of the offspring) shifts slightly during and
immediately after wars, then the gTWH can possibly explain
Returning soldier effect
3003
why there are more boys born then. If, for example, taller and
bigger soldiers are more likely to survive wars, to be reunited
with their wives after demobilization, while shorter and
smaller soldiers are more likely to die, never to get an(other)
opportunity to reproduce, then the gTWH would predict that
more boys will be born during and immediately after wars.
The returning soldier effect would then be a byproduct of the
gTWH, where soldiers who would have produced daughters
were more likely to be killed during the war and did not get
an opportunity to do so. Such a byproduct of the gTWH is
expected to be temporary, as younger generations of men
who were unaffected by the combat experience (and thus pre-
serve the normal distribution of height) become of reproductive
age and start having children, and as the surge of baby boom
created by postwar reunion of soldiers with their wives gra-
dually wanes.
The question then is: is it possible that there was a significant
difference in body size between the soldiers who survived the
battle and those who were killed?
Surviving and fallen British soldiers during
World War I
Data
In order to examine whether soldiers who survive wars are
different in body size than soldiers who do not, I examine the
service records of British soldiers in World War I. The
record series `WO (War Office) 363' in the National Archives
in Kew Gardens outside London contains service records of
every single man who enlisted for the British armed forces
between 1914 and 1920 (Spencer, 2001, pp. 23­34). Each sol-
dier's record typically begins with the attestation form, which
lists the soldier's name, address, age, marital status and next
of kin, among other demographic information at the time of
enlistment. Then each enlistee undergoes a thorough medical
examination, where their height, chest girth and (less freq-
uently) weight, and vision are measured and recorded. The
record also contains the details of each soldier's service for
its entire duration, where and how long he was posted at a parti-
cular domestic or foreign location, when he was granted leaves,
if he received any medal of honor for his service, and his ulti-
mate fate. It records whether he was discharged after a given
length of service, demobilized at the end of the conflict or
killed in action or died of wounds or diseases acquired
during service. WO363 contains the records of enlisted men
and non-commissioned officers only; it excludes the records
of commissioned officers.
The original records for 6.5 millions soldiers were kept in
the War Office Record Store on Arnside Street in London after
World War I (http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/
DisplayCatalogueDetails.asp?CATID=13422&CATLN¼3&
FullDetails¼True). On 8 September 1940, incendiary bombs
dropped during an air raid campaign by the German Luftwaffe
caused fire at the War Office Record Store, and destroyed
approximately two-thirds of the records (WO363 is thus known
as the `burnt documents'). The surviving records, many of
which were charred and water damaged, were subsequently
stored on 23 608 reels of microfilm, in alphabetical order of the
soldier's last name. All 23 608 reels are currently kept at the
National Archives in Kew Gardens for free public access for
anyone who visits the National Archives in person, but they are
not online or accessible from a remote site.
The sample
Because WO363 records exist only as the original handwritten
forms photographed on microfilm, and because the information
is not coded or digitized in any way, it is impossible to draw a
representative sample of the soldiers. I have therefore decided
to code each soldier's record into a computer file, starting with
the first record on the first reel (A1), in strict alphabetical order
by the last name, without skipping any record. I have thus tran-
scribed the first 1000 records. The last names range in alpha-
betical order from Ababreltom to Ablett.
This is obviously not a representative sample of men who
enlisted for British military service during the 1914­1920
period. For example, to the extent that many Irish last names
begin with M or O, my sample probably underrepresents sol-
diers from Ireland (which was part of the UK until 1921).
However, I do not expect Irish nationality to be correlated
with either the independent variables of interest (height and
weight) or the dependent variable (survival).
Nor do I have any reason to believe that the alphabetical
order of the soldier's last name or the probability of the soldier's
record's survival of the fire on 8 September 1940, in London,
to be correlated with the soldier's body size or his ultimate
fate in the war. I therefore believe that, while my sample is
not a representative sample in the technical sense, it is nonethe-
less an unbiased sample with respect to the current purpose of
determining whether British soldiers who survived World War I
were significantly taller than those who did not.
In order to ascertain whether my particular decision to code
the first 1000 cases has any effect on my conclusions, I have
drawn alternative samples of first n cases which includes 100
dead soldiers with usable (non-missing) values on height
(n ¼ 1053), the first 1100 cases (n ¼ 1100) and the first n
cases which includes 1000 usable values on height (n ¼
1122). None of my substantive conclusions below change as
a result of using any of these alternative samples.
Dependent variable
The dependent variable of interest here is whether the soldier
survived the war (0 if he survived the war, 1 if he was
killed). I did not make a distinction among the causes of
death. Sometimes the soldier's fate is recorded as `killed in
action' and other times as `died of wounds'. A few soldiers
died of an accident while on duty. If the soldier died of any
cause during his military service, I record him as being
killed. In a few instances where the soldier's survival status
was not apparent in the handwritten records in WO363, I con-
sulted the (purportedly comprehensive) list of fallen British
soldiers at the web site of the Commonwealth War Graves
Commission (http://www.cwgc.org/).
Similarly, there are many ways a British soldier could
survive World War I. Most were `discharged' from service
after a contracted period of service. These soldiers usually
filled out a discharge form, which recorded the date of
Kanazawa
3004
discharge and a forwarding civilian address. In some cases, the
soldier was `demobilized' after the end of the conflict in World
War I. In a surprising number of cases, the soldier deserted
the unit. Once again, regardless of the reason for survival,
I recorded the soldier as having survived if he was not killed
during his service.
Independent variables
My main independent variables of interest are the soldier's
height and weight at the time of enlistment. These were
taken during the routine medical examination at the beginning
of his service. For some reason, weight was not measured
nearly as frequently as height and `chest girth' (the chest
measurement when fully expanded). Some of the forms used
for medical examination had spaces for height and chest
girth, but not for weight. Other forms had spaces for height,
weight, chest girth, vision for left and right eye, as well as
other medical measurements. In addition to height, weight
and chest girth, I recorded the soldier's age at enlistment and
marital status (1 if currently married, 0 otherwise).
Results
In my sample of 1000, 102 soldiers are recorded as killed and
898 as survived. All subsequent comparisons, however, use
somewhat smaller numbers due to missing data on the indepen-
dent variables.
The surviving soldiers in my sample have a significantly
higher mean height than fallen soldiers (in cm): 168.63
versus 166.26, t(896)
¼ 3.526, P , 0.001, 95% confidence
interval of the mean difference ¼ 2.37+ 1.32. The surviving
soldiers are also significantly heavier (in kg): 60.46 versus
56.84, t(393)
¼ 2.852, P , 0.01, 95% confidence interval ¼
3.62 + 2.49) and significantly older (26.2 versus 23.9 years,
t(955)
¼ 2.894, P , 0.01, 95% confidence interval ¼ 2.3 +
1.6). The two groups are not different in chest girth (91.29
versus 89.79, t(902)
¼ 1.220, ns) or marital status (0.41 versus
0.24, t(917)
¼ 1.301, ns). While the mean difference in height
between the surviving and fallen soldiers is 2.37 cm, the
median difference is greater at 3.33 cm (168.43 versus
165.10, x2 ¼ 13.46, asymptotic P , 0.001).
In a binary logistic regression with the survival of the soldier
as the dependent variable and height, weight, and age as the
independent variables, height is the only variable which
marginally significantly predicts the soldier's survival inde-
pendently (b ¼ 20.059, SE ¼ 0.031, eb ¼ 0.943, P , 0.06).
Neither weight nor age independently predicts survival
once height is controlled (weight: b ¼ 20.016, SE ¼ 0.026,
eb ¼ 0.984, ns; age: b ¼ 20.037, SE ¼ 0.025, eb ¼ .964, ns).
The odds ratio of 0.943 for height means that every centimeter
on a soldier's height decreases the odds of being killed by 6%
or increases the odds of survival by 6% (1/0.943 ¼ 1.060).
While the mean and median differences in height between
surviving and fallen soldiers are both significant at P ,
0.001, the median difference (3.33 cm) is larger than the
mean difference (2.37 cm). In order to provide a statistically
conservative estimate of what potential consequences in off-
spring sex ratio this height difference might have, I will
focus on the mean difference in the subsequent analysis.
The reader should keep in mind that my choice of the mean
difference deliberately underestimates the potential conse-
quences for offspring sex ratio.
Figure 1 shows the distribution of soldiers' height by their
survival status. The top panel shows the distribution of height
among soldiers who survived World War I, and the bottom
panel shows the distribution of height among soldiers who
were killed. The vertical line that runs through both panels indi-
cates the mean height of the surviving soldiers (168.63 cm). It
is evident that the distribution of height among the fallen sol-
diers in the bottom panel has a lower mean than the distribution
of height among the surviving soldiers.
What difference does a one-inch difference make?
It thus appears that British soldiers who survived World War I
were slightly but significantly taller than those who were killed.

The mean height difference is nearly one inch (2.37 cm).
But what difference can such a small height difference
make in offspring sex ratio? Is it really sufficient to account
for all the excess boys born during and after World War I in
the UK?
Unfortunately, this question cannot be answered with his-
torical data from the UK from the same period. There are no
datasets that contain both the height of the general population
of the UK during 1914­1920 and the sex of their offspring. In
order to estimate the effect of height on the offspring sex ratio,
I use the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
(Add Health) from the USA. To my knowledge, Add Health
is the only data set with a large, nationally representative
sample of a population, in which researchers measure respon-
dents' height rather than relying on their self-reports. Given
that most men want to be taller than they are (Calden et al.,
1959), it is important not to rely on self-reports of height in
estimating its effect on offspring sex ratio.
The use of Add Health in the following analysis, however,
crucially assumes that the effect of height on offspring sex
ratio remains roughly comparable both across time (from
early 20th to early 21st century) and across the Atlantic (in
the UK and in the USA). Both TWH and gTWH are purported
to describe not only species-typical phenomena applicable to
all human societies at all times, but also a fundamental bio-
logical process hypothesized to operate among all species
with sexually dimorphic fitness variance.
Among male respondents who have had at least one child by
the third (last available) wave of Add Health in 2001­2002
(n ¼ 696), controlling for education and income (as measures
of social class predicted to influence offspring sex ratio by
the original TWH) and weight, height has a significantly posi-
tive effect on the probability of having a son as the first child
(b ¼ 0.0535, eb ¼ 1.0550, P , 0.05).
The odds ratio (eb) of 1.0550 for one-inch increment in
height translates into 1.0513 for a height difference of 0.9345
inches (2.37 cm) (b ¼ 0.0535 Â 0.9345 ¼ 0.0500, e0.0500 ¼
1.0513). It means that an increase in height of 2.37 cm
increases the odds of having a son by 5.13%. Notice that,
according to Graffelman and Hoekstra's (2000) analysis, this
is more than seven times the actual increase in the odds of
having a son during and immediately after World War I in
the UK (0.7%). It therefore follows that, if at least one-seventh
of British male population experienced combat duties in World
War I, then the one-inch height difference between the sur-
viving and fallen soldiers can account for all the excess boys
born during and immediately after the war.
As it turns out, nearly one-third (32.39%) of young British
men between the ages of 15 and 40 were mobilized during
World War I. In 1911, in the last British Census conducted
before the outbreak of World War I, the number of men
between the ages of 15 and 40 in England and Wales was
15 081 844 (Census of England and Wales, 1915, pp. 90­91,
Table 29). Unfortunately, the exact number of adult males in
Scotland and Ireland in 1911 is not available. However, in
1911, England and Wales accounted for 85.76% of the total
population of the UK (36 316/42 138 ¼ 0.8576) (Hickes and
Allen, 1999, p. 6). Assuming that the population age structure
in Scotland and Ireland in 1911 was roughly comparable to that
in England and Wales in the same year, it means that the total
number of adult males between 15 and 40 in the UK was 17.6
million (15 081 844/0.8576 ¼ 17 586 105). More than 5.7
million British men were mobilized during World War I
(Spencer, 2001, p. xi). Thus the proportion of adult males
who served in the British military during World War I is
5.7/17.6 ¼ 0.3239.
It, therefore, appears that the very slight (2.37 cm) height
advantage of surviving soldiers compared to their fallen com-
rades is more than twice as sufficient to account for the return-
ing soldier effect observed in the UK during and immediately
after World War I. This conclusion assumes that surviving
and returning soldiers were no more or no less likely to
father a child during and immediately after World War I than
the rest of the (unmobilized) male population. If, as some
(James, 1981,1983) suggest, returning soldiers after many
years of separation from their wives are more likely to
father a child, then it would have required an even smaller
proportion of the British male population to have been
mobilized to produce the observed increase in the number
of boys. Further, recall that the use of the median height
difference (3.33 cm) would also have required a similarly
smaller proportion of the British male population to have
been mobilized.
Why do taller soldiers have better chance
of survival in war?
If the height advantage of surviving soldiers over fallen sol-
diers in the British armed forces during World War I genera-
lizes to the soldiers of other belligerent nations in both
World Wars, then the phenomenon, combined with the ten-
dency of taller parents to have more sons, can potentially
explain the returning soldier effect, where more boys are
born during and immediately after wars. More empirical
research is necessary, both to replicate the findings above in
the UK and to extend it to other western nations found to
have experienced the returning soldier effect during and after
World Wars (Graffelman and Hoekstra, 2000).
It remains unclear why taller soldiers are more likely to
survive battle than shorter soldiers. I can offer three specu-
lations. First, taller and heavier soldiers, especially during the
less prosperous times of the early 20th century, may have
been physically stronger and more fit, as well possibly as
genetically and developmentally healthier. They might, there-
fore, have been better able to resist diseases and even
wounds sustained during combat, which might have killed
their shorter and lighter counterparts.
Second, height is known to be correlated with intelligence
(Schreider, 1964; Tanner, 1969; Porter, 1892; Jensen and
Sinha, 1993). Some (Miller, in press) suggest that both height
and intelligence are indicator of underlying genetic health,
while others (Kanazawa and Reyniers, 2007) contend that the
extrinsic correlation stems from assortative mating of intelli-
gent men and beautiful women, on the one hand, and that of
tall men and beautiful women, on the other. The correlation
between height and IQ among men in the Add Health data is
Kanazawa
3006
r ¼ 0.0943, n ¼ 6642, P , 0.001. The positive correlation
between height and intelligence has two possible con-
sequences. While the WO363 records that I use in my analysis
include only enlisted men and non-commissioned officers, and
excludes commissioned officers, it is possible that taller and
thus more intelligent men were able to climb the ranks of
non-commissioned officers to such ranks as lance corporal
and sergeant, and were able to avoid the most dangerous
combat situations because of their relative seniority (I thank
William H. James and Dominic D. P. Johnson for indepen-
dently suggesting this possibility to me).
Alternatively, modern warfare, even in the Great War
nearly a century ago, is evolutionarily novel in that it
involves weapons, machines, tactics and situations that did
not exist in the ancestral environment. Soldiers may therefore
have needed general intelligence to fight successfully and
survive an evolutionarily novel situation of modern warfare
(Kanazawa, 2004). Given that a non-trivial number of British
soldiers survived World War I by deserting, they may have
needed general intelligence to desert and avoid court-martial
successfully. Whalley and Deary (2001) show, however, that
less, not more, intelligent British soldiers were more likely to
survive World War II.
Dominic D. P. Johnson (personal communication) suggests
another interesting hypothesis. If vital organs in the body do
not increase in size linearly with the body size (height and
weight), then it means that taller and heavier soldiers, while
they may be more likely to be shot because of their larger
body size, have nonetheless more room in their body where
they can be `safely' shot and still survive the injury.
Regardless of the exact reason why taller soldiers are more
likely to survive battle, if my explanation for the returning
soldier effect is correct, the phenomenon is not likely to be
observed and repeated in more recent and future wars. This
is because, for my suggested mechanism to work, a substantial
proportion of the male population has to be deployed in the
war. With the advances in military technologies, however,
which allow the modern military to fight wars, not by mano a
mano combat of large infantries, but with laser-guided missiles
on a computer screen and supersonic fighter jets, military
forces of advanced western nations do not require as many
soldiers to fight the war successfully as they used to. This
transition to smaller military forces is reflected in the discon-
tinuation of conscription in most western nations.
With much smaller proportions of the male population
mobilized in wars, the returning soldier effect is not likely to
be repeated, even if tall soldiers are still more likely to
survive battle and even if tall parents are more likely to have
sons. The higher sex ratios among the surviving (and returning)
soldiers will not significantly shift the secondary sex ratio in the
whole society. There is some evidence that more boys were not
born during more recent wars, such as the Iran­Iraq wars in
1980­1988 (Ansari-Lari and Saadat, 2002) and the 10-day
war in Slovenia in 1991 (Zorn et al., 2002). The lower rate
of mobilization might also explain why the returning soldier
effect was not observed in the US during World War I, when
it was during World War II (MacMahon and Pugh, 1954;
Graffelman and Hoekstra, 2000).
