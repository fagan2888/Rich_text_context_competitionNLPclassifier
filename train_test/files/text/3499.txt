Introduction
Concerns raised by children's listening difficulties or under-
performance at school prompt a range of referrals for special
education, psychological, medical, and allied health evalua-
tions. Less frequently, deficits in central auditory processing
(CAP) are directly raised as a possible etiological basis for
these difficulties, especially when hearing loss has been
excluded as a possible cause. Yet, central auditory processing
disorder (CAPD) is a diagnostic category associated with an
array of difficulties in a variety of academic and life domains
(American Academy of Audiology, 2010). This retrospective
study investigates educators as a referral source for CAP
evaluation and also presents a compilation of the other most
common referrers and concerns that precipitate children's
referrals to an audiology clinic for CAP evaluation, resulting
in an eventual diagnosis of CAPD.
Interest in CAPD is topical and has received significant
attention from a variety of research and clinical perspectives.
Although a universally accepted definition and set of diag-
nostic criteria are still lacking, audiologists primarily con-
ceptualize CAPD as a perceptual disorder related to
dysfunction of central auditory structures in the central ner-
vous system (CNS; Stach, 2003). In this article, theAmerican
Speech-Language Hearing Association (ASHA) definitions
of CAP and CAPD are adopted. CAP is
the auditory mechanisms that underlie the following abilities or
skills: sound localization and lateralization; auditory
discrimination; auditory pattern recognition; temporal aspects of
audition,includingtemporalintegration,temporaldiscrimination
(e.g., temporal gap detection), temporal ordering, and temporal
masking; auditory performance in competing acoustic signals
(including dichotic listening); and auditory performance with
degraded acoustic signals. (ASHA, 2005, p. 2)
CAPD refers to "difficulties in the perceptual processing of
auditory information in the CNS as demonstrated by poor
performance in one or more of the above skills," despite nor-
mal peripheral hearing thresholds (Chermak, 2002, p. 2).
Debate about the definition, nature, and symptomatology
of CAPD has undergone a fluctuating trajectory historically
with a resurgence (particularly in the audiology literature) of
CAPD as a distinct diagnostic entity. The heterogeneous
nature of the extensive list of associated behavioral features

Educators as Referrers for Central
Auditory Processing Assessments: Who
Else Refers and Why?
Chyrisse Heine1, Michelle Slone2, and Wayne J. Wilson3
Abstract
This study aimed to investigate the referrers (including educators) and reasons children were referred to an audiology
clinic for central auditory processing (CAP) evaluation, to identify a referral pathway for listening problems and professional
development needs. A case file audit was used to examine the intake questionnaire completed by 150 parents whose child
was diagnosed with central auditory processing disorder (CAPD). School staff were the most common referrers, followed
by medical/allied health professionals, and family members. The most common concerns leading to referral were literacy,
speech, language, and academic underperformance, followed by hearing, listening, and processing difficulties and emotional-
behavioral issues. Significant correlations were observed between the referral sources and concerns. Results suggest that
CAPD is primarily conceptualized as part of a more general educational concern. Continuing education and informational
counseling is required to ensure that CAP referrals continue to be appropriately made.

has evoked criticism since CAPD defies definition and spec-
ification on the basis of a unique cluster of diagnostic signs
reflecting some underlying mechanism (DeBonis &
Moncrieff, 2008). For example, Ferguson, Hall, Riley, and
Moore (2011) compared the communication, listening, and
behavior of normally developing children to two groups of
children, one group with specific language impairment (SLI)
and one with CAPD. These authors concluded that the groups
of children with SLI and CAPD displayed similar behavioral
and parental report profiles, thereby suggesting that differen-
tial diagnosis based on their referral route rather than diag-
nostic outcome is impossible. Furthermore, high levels of
comorbidity with other language, literacy, cognitive and
behavioral disorders further confound attempts at delineating
the boundaries of the impairment based on behaviors and
symptomatology (Hamaguchi & Tazeau, 2007).
CAPD is a controversial label and, although it is a pre-
ferred diagnostic label to other labels such as language and
phonological disorders (Kamhi, 2004), it has attracted debate
and criticism among professionals. Foremost among these
controversies is whether CAPD is primarily an auditory defi-
cit or attributed to or comorbid with other deficits such as
language processing (Medwetsky & Musiek, 2011) or atten-
tion (Moore, Ferguson, Edmondson-Jones, Ratib, & Riley,
2010) deficits. Burkhard (2009) acknowledges that there is
diversity in the field of CAPD since there is a lack of consen-
sus regarding its definition, the battery of tests used for its
diagnosis and the rehabilitation measures used for its man-
agement. Notwithstanding the controversies surrounding the
label, CAPD is considered a complex multifaceted auditory
deficit usually diagnosed by an audiologist using specific
audiological tests designed to assess CAP skills (such as
defined in the ASHA, 2005, definition), although its implica-
tions converge with domains addressed by numerous medi-
cal and allied health professionals (M/AHP), including
medical specialists (such as otolaryngologists or neurolo-
gists), speech-language pathologists (SLPs), occupational
therapists, psychologists, and educators.
Behavioral characteristics associated with the impairment
are descriptive and exhaustively described, and include dif-
ficulty comprehending speech in competing or reverberant
environments, requests for repetition of information often
using nonspecific clarification requests, misunderstanding
messages, inconsistent or inappropriate responses, delays in
responding to oral communication, difficulty following com-
plex auditory directions, difficulty with sound localization,
inattentiveness, distractibility, and literacy difficulties
(Hamaguchi & Tazeau, 2007). A point of confusion for pro-
fessionals (specifically those working in a school environ-
ment) is the issue of exclusivity, since many of the above
behavioral manifestations may also be evident in children
with other disorders such as those with language difficulties,
memory or attention deficits among many other disorders.
Ehren (2009) suggests that in many instances, the curriculum
demands facing school aged children are fundamentally
based on language knowledge and skills, and may contribute
to a child's listening and auditory processing difficulties
leading to difficulty with separating out the symptomatology
"supposedly" specific to CAPD. Moreover, comorbidity of
CAPD with other disorders such as language-learning diffi-
culties may result in difficulty with differential diagnosis and
needs to be accounted for in the assessment of children sus-
pected of having CAPD so that appropriate diagnoses can be
made and management can be sought (Geffner & Ross-
Swain, 2007).
CAPD as a modality specific perceptual dysfunction as
questioned by Cacace and McFarland (2005) has been widely
challenged (Katz & Tillery, 2005; Musiek, Bellis, &
Chermak, 2005; Rosen, 2005). The diversity of functional
deficits that make up CAPD and associated deficits across
life domains necessitate a holistic approach to identify rea-
sons for referral for CAP evaluation. Interacting language,
literacy, and auditory processing systems contribute to the
complexity of identifying specific behaviors leading to a
CAPD diagnosis. Numerous scenarios are therefore possible.
It is possible that children who will eventually be diagnosed
with CAPD have poor listening skills and poor skills in other
domains such as language, in which case, it is difficult to
separate CAPD symptomatology from symptoms arising
from other difficulties. CAPD thus may be present but over-
looked. It is also possible that children's good language or
literacy competency may mask potential CAP symptomatol-
ogy and deficits (Heine & Slone, 2008). The interacting sys-
tems of language, literacy, memory, and attention stress the
need for further investigation in regard to the referral con-
cern and the referral sources best positioned to detect signs
and symptoms that warrant further investigation.
It is anticipated that a wide variety of people in the educa-
tional system and community (including family) would refer
a child to an audiologist and possibly other M/AHP for CAP
evaluation. Listening or hearing difficulties (Johnson, Benson,
& Seaton, 1997), difficulty with the acquisition of literacy as
in reading and/or spelling, learning difficulties including
suspected dyslexia, slow academic progress, or language
difficulty may alert educators about the need for further
investigation of CAP skills. Although teachers are potentially
excellent referral initiators for CAP testing as they observe
children's listening and academic skills and behaviors in a
variety of listening environments, they may not have the
knowledge to pinpoint CAPD as a possible feature of chil-
dren's language-learning and literacy-based problems, which
could lead to under referral for CAPD evaluation.
Allied health professionals such as SLPs may also con-
ceptualize CAPD as another disorder such as receptive lan-
guage disorder or be unable to differentiate CAPD from
another disorder (Heine, Joffe, & Greaves, 2003). Hence,
they may not be referring children with potential CAPD to an
audiology clinic for CAP evaluation. Furthermore, comor-
bidity with other deficits such as attention deficit hyperactiv-
ity disorders, Asperger's Syndrome, or sensory integration
Heine et al. 3
disorder (Medwetsky & Musiek, 2011) may misguide pro-
fessionals in referring a child for audiological CAP evalua-
tion. For families, usually a child's listening difficulties or
behavior evident in the home and social environment may
necessitate referral. For example, difficulty following
instructions or communicating effectively with others as dis-
played by frequent requests for repetition (Heine, 2003).
Although a universally accepted definition and set of
diagnostic criteria for CAPD is still lacking, the general pub-
lic is becoming increasingly more aware of the concept of
CAPD and referrals for CAP assessment continue to increase
(Bellis, 2011). Most research has concentrated on debates
around definitions and criteria, terminology and constructing
assessment instruments. While it is reported that certain
behaviors in children warrant referral for a CAP assessment
(e.g., listening difficulties; Bellis, 2011), no research has
been conducted on who is referring for CAP assessments and
why they are referring. The determination of the referral con-
cern most frequently leading to referral for CAP evaluation
and resulting in a CAPD diagnosis will assist and alert future
referrers in regard to the behaviors that could necessitate
referral to an audiologist for CAP evaluation. In addition, the
identification of referral sources would highlight the referral
concern specific to the referral initiator and determine which
if any referral initiators are in need of further informational
counseling so that children with CAPD can be identified and
managed. Information regarding referral concerns and refer-
ral sources will also provide insight into the decision-making
process that professionals and families consider when refer-
ring a child for audiological evaluation.
The aims of this case file audit were to identify the refer-
ral sources and concerns that necessitate a child's referral to
an audiological clinic for CAP evaluation, whether educators
are the primary referrers of children for a CAP evaluation,
and examine the relationship between referral sources and
concerns.
Materials and Method
Participants
Data were collected over a 6-month period (beginning in
July 2015) from the files of 150 children diagnosed with
CAPD since January 2013. These children had completed a
full battery of hearing and CAP tests at an audiology clinic
that specifically specializes in CAP evaluation.At the time of
the assessment, the parents/guardians of these children com-
pleted a short generic questionnaire that was routinely used
in this clinic. The questionnaire (adapted from Northern &
Downs, 2002) enquired about each child's demographics,
referral information, schooling, prior professional consulta-
tions, medical history, family history, and developmental his-
tory. The referred group of children comprised 94 boys
(62%) and 56 girls (37.3%), aged 7 to 11.1 years (M age =
8.19, SD = 2.55). Participants were of mixed demographic
backgrounds (Australian or an immigrant group, such as
from the United Kingdom, New Zealand, or South Africa)
and socioeconomic class (attending both state and private
schools) and derived from urban or rural population groups
(living in Metropolitan Melbourne or surrounding areas in
Victoria Australia).
Participants were excluded from this study if the parent
did not fully complete the demographic or referral question
parts of the case history questionnaire; if they did not sign
informed consent for the use of their child's information for
research purposes; if the child's home language was any lan-
guage other than English, because English as a second lan-
guage can influence the results of CAP testing, and if they
were not diagnosed with CAPD after completing the audio-
logical testing.
Instruments
Hearing and CAP evaluation. The hearing evaluation consisted
of otoscopic examination, pure-tone air-conduction threshold
audiometry, speech audiometry, and acoustic immittance
testing. The measures used to assess CAP were selected
according to ASHA (2005) guidelines and included evalua-
tion of monaural low-redundancy speech, dichotic listening,
and auditory temporal processing (see Table 1). The children
in this study were diagnosed as having CAPD if they received
a score of 2 standard deviations below the mean on two or
more tests (as recommended by ASHA, 2005).
Case history questionnaire. Parents completed a case history
questionnaire (see the appendix) in which the following
information was provided: demographic data (including
child's date of birth and age, gender, home address, language
spoken at home), referral information (the referral source ini-
tiating the referral for this evaluation and the reason for the
referral), schooling (school attended and year level), medical
history (general medical and ear specific history), and family
history and developmental history (pregnancy, birth history,
and developmental milestones).
Referral sources and referral concerns questions.The parents
completed the referral sources and concerns section of the
questionnaire by responding to questions that aimed at iden-
tifying the presenting concern necessitating the CAP evalua-
tion and the referral source initiating the CAP evaluation.
The following questions were asked (see the appendix): Did
anyone refer you to this clinic (Yes/No)? If yes, who referred
you? If no, how did you hear about this clinic? Please
describe the concern/s that led you to contact this clinic.
On observation of item analysis, it was noted that referral
sources could be delineated into three broad categories. One cat-
egory was comprised of educators (the principal, assistant princi-
pal or vice principal, teachers, and special education personnel).
The second category worked in the M/AHP (including doctors,
otolaryngologists, pediatricians, neurologists, psychologists,
4 SAGE Open
occupational therapists, SLPs, and other professional personal).
The final category comprised family members (which included
family and friends as the referrer). In this way, referral sources
were categorized as "school staff," "M/AHP," and "family."
There were no instances of more than one referrer.
A range of referral concerns was also reported. These were
clearly delineated into concerns describing "hearing, listen-
ing, and processing" problems, such as "difficulties listening
in noise" or "slow processing speed." The second category
was comprised of concerns describing literacy, speech, lan-
guage, and academic problems, such as "difficulty with read-
ing or spelling" or "receptive language difficulties." The third
category constituted items describing emotional-behavioral
symptoms (including attention and concentration problems),
such as "difficulty concentrating on tasks" or "difficulty sus-
taining attention." For each child, the primary (first) reported
concern as well as any further (secondary) concerns was cat-
egorized into one of the three categories. Following this allo-
cation, the total number of reports per category was tallied,
producing a total score in the categories "hearing, listening,
and processing" problems; "literacy, speech, language, and
academic" problems; and "emotional-behavioral" problems.
There were 45 instances of children referred for two concerns
and seven instances of three concerns per child.
Procedure
The same procedure was adopted for all children attending the
clinic. Parents and their children attended the CAP clinic at a
pre-arranged appointment date and time. They completed the
case history questionnaire and informed consent form which
takes approximately 5 min. Children's hearing and CAP skills
were then evaluated by a qualified audiologist in a sound-
proof clinic room adjacent to the waiting room. The peripheral
hearing evaluation was conducted using a Heine Otoscope,
Earscan Immittance Meter, and Itera diagnostic audiometer
with TDH-39 headphones. Peripheral hearing testing was fol-
lowed by the CAP test battery evaluating, in order of test pre-
sentation, monaural low-redundancy speech testing, dichotic
listening, and temporal processing (see Table 1).
Following this evaluation, a case discussion took place
between the audiologist and the parents.
Data Analysis
The data were analyzed descriptively and statistically using
2 tests at the p = .05 level of significance.
Results
Descriptive Statistics
As an initial step in data analysis, descriptive analyses were
conducted. School staff was the primary referral source
(61.0%), followed by M/AHPs (30.0 %) that included mainly
SLPs, and finally by family members (9.0%). See Figure 1.
Analysis of the percentage of referral concerns revealed
that more than half the children (55.2%) were referred for

literacy, speech, language, and academic concerns, and there
were similar frequencies of referral for the categories hear-
ing, listening, and processing difficulties (23.3%) and emo-
tional-behavioral issues (21.4%; see Figure 2).
Statistical Analyses
To examine the relationship between the categorical vari-
ables (referral sources and referral concerns), between-group
comparisons were conducted using 2 tests at the p = .05
level of significance. The overall 2 Fisher's Exact test
assessing the relation between the referral sources and the
referral concerns was significant, 2(4) = 11.068, p = .023.
The analysis for proportion of referral source (school, M/
AHP, and family) by referral concern (hearing, listening, and
processing difficulties; literacy, speech, language, and aca-
demic underperformance; and emotional-behavioral issues)
is presented in Table 2.
Results of the 2 test showed that both referral sources of
school and M/AHPs referred clients for a CAP assessment
primarily on the basis of literacy, speech, language, and aca-
demic underperformance (35.2% for school staff and 15.2%
for M/AHP) and similarly for hearing, listening, and pro-
cessing difficulties (12.4% for school staff and 6.7% for M/
AHP) and emotional-behavioral issues (13.3% for school
staff and 8.1% for M/AHP). However, in the category of
family, referrals were equally made on the basis of the hear-
ing, listening, and processing difficulties (18.4%), followed
by literacy, speech, language, and academic underperfor-
mance (4.3% and 4.8%). There were no referrals made by
family on the basis of emotional-behavioral issues.
To determine which categories of variables were major
contributors to the statistically significant 2 values, 2 pair
comparisons were examined. The result of 2 indicated that
there was a significant relationship between the referral
sources of M/AHP and family for emotional-behavioral
issues and hearing, listening and processing difficulties (2 =
8.583, p < .005). A significant relationship was also found
between school staff and family for emotional-behavioral
issues and hearing, listening, and processing difficulties (2 =
8.4, p < .005). Finally, a significant relationship was found
between the M/AHP and family for emotional-behavioral
issues and literacy, speech, language, and academic difficul-
ties (2 = 4.874, p < .05).
Discussion
Findings of the descriptive statistics showed that the cate-
gory of literacy, speech, language, and academic problems
was the most salient area prompting referral for a CAP evalu-
ation by all sources. Literature is available describing the
close association between CAPD and literacy and academic
problems and CAPD and speech and language disorders
(Bamiou, Musiek, & Luxon, 2001; Banai & Kraus, 2007;
Dawes & Bishop, 2009; Dawes et al., 2009; Domitz &
Schow, 2000). Numerous theories have been hypothesized

6 SAGE Open
(although not yet proven) to explain the link between CAP,
language and learning difficulties. Tallal and Piercy (1973)
used an auditory repetition task (ART) to investigate the tem-
poral processing of children with SLI compared with normal
developing children. These authors concluded that children
with SLI had more difficulty on this task than their normal
developing counterparts when the interstimulus interval was
short. In a follow-up study, Tallal, Miller, Jenkins, and
Merzenich (1997) attributed oral and written childhood lan-
guage disorders to a nonverbal processing deficit which
occurs when auditory information is presented rapidly. Tallal
(1980) found similar findings in a study with reading-
impaired children. In contrast, however, Nittrouer (1999)
found that good and poor readers did not differ in their ART
performance or ability to identify brief formant transitions.
Language, learning, and SLI are common deficits associated
with literacy and academic underperformance. Diagnosis of
language and learning difficulties may in fact overshadow
the referral for CAPD evaluation as CAP deficits are less
known as a clinical entity.
The second most frequent category of concerns on which
referral was based, was hearing, listening, and processing
problems. Referral to an audiologist on this basis would be
highly insightful as the audiologist is the professional com-
petent in evaluating the audiological system using audio-
metric instruments, and thus should have been the most
obvious place to refer a child for these specific concerns.
However, overall, these referral criteria were used by only
23.3% of cases. School staff and M/AHPs underutilized this
criterion as a prompt for referral. A possible reason for lack
of recognition of deficits in the auditory system as an under-
lying explanation for the child's functional deficits could be
that referral sources are not familiar with the audiological
evaluation of CAPD. Potential referral sources are possibly
also unable to distinguish auditory processing deficits from
general academic, literacy, speech, and language disorders
and may in their professional view believe that CAPD is a
language or learning disorder. It is also possible that they
refer children with these problems to other professionals
such as the SLP or psychologist even if there are only listen-
ing, hearing, or processing symptomatologies (e.g., diffi-
culty experienced only in complex listening situations such
as when there is excessive background noise). The referral
to other allied health professionals (other than the audiolo-
gist) may also be explained on the basis of comorbidity or
the possibility that hearing, listening, or processing symp-
tomatology may also be associated with other deficits (e.g.,
, a child with a language disorder may display hearing, lis-
tening or processing difficulties).
A large proportion of families also used these criteria
appropriately as a stimulus for referral to an audiologist. A
tentative explanation accounting for the prevalence of this
referral category among family referrers is their ability to
detect the child's difficulty in attending to auditory informa-
tion in an everyday home environment. Families may thus be
in the best position to identify the child's auditory discrimi-
nation difficulties, misidentification of auditory-presented
instructions, confusion of sounds and words, inability to fol-
low instructions, or communication, particularly in com-
promised listening environments. Because these difficulties

Heine et al. 7
occur in routine home environments, parents may not be
confused with listening and processing difficulties as
opposed to difficulties in other academic areas such as liter-
acy or academic underperformance.
The third category of presenting problems was emotional-
behavioral problems that prompted referral in only 21.4% of
cases. It is most probable that the audiologist is not the pri-
mary person associated with this referral concern and the
possibility of an audiological associated problem is enter-
tained only after exhausting other alternative diagnoses.
School staff and M/AHPs used emotional-behavioral
problems as a basis of referral. In contrast, the family did not
use this concern at all as a referral criterion possibly as this
symptomatology is more obscure and is probably attributed
by them to psychological disorder.
School staff play a central role in referring children for
CAP evaluation. They have broad knowledge and training in
a variety of educational and associated content and issues,
thereby positioning them to identify CAPD as a possible eti-
ology for children's listening difficulties. They also have
access to large populations of children and carry the respon-
sibility for delivering the curriculum to children, as well as
for evaluating and monitoring children's performance and
referring children to a specialist when appropriate. This
highlights the importance of continued appraisal of school
staff in relation to CAPD, its symptomatology and audiologi-
cal diagnosis to assist with identifying appropriate children
for referral. A recent review of the literature evaluated
whether reexamining the current CAPD protocols for school-
age children is required, and concluded that the focus should
rather be redirected to evaluating overall listening needs
(DeBonis, 2015). Thus, for school staff, describing and dif-
ferentiating children's listening performance in a variety of
listening contexts would be useful to inform the referral for
CAP evaluation. These include differentiating performance
in quiet environments as opposed to environments with
excessive background noise or high reverberation, one-on-
one situations as opposed to group situations where dichotic
listening (multi-task listening) is required, and single-task
auditory contexts as opposed to multiple task auditory con-
texts where the ability to divert auditory attention to various
simultaneously presented auditory stimuli is required. It is
important to note, however, that although these observations
may be useful for educators to consider the necessity for
CAP referral, these listening behaviors are not implicitly
suggestive of CAPD.

Similarly M/AHPs encounter broad populations of children
who potentially require CAPD assessment, yet the referral rate
was lower than school staff. The relatively lower referral rate
by M/AHPs for CAP assessment may be due to several rea-
sons. It is possible that many personnel in this category con-
ceptualize CAPD in a different way to the audiologist; they are
not fully knowledgeable of strongly indicative referral criteria,
the complexity of this diagnostic category, types of audiologi-
cal assessments that can inform a diagnosis, and knowledge of
the audiologist's expertise in CAP evaluation.
In this study, the family did not make as many referrals for
CAP evaluation compared to school staff and M/AHPs. It is
likely that families (and possibly many other nonhealth pro-
fessionals) are unaware of this diagnostic category and of
symptoms that would prompt referral for CAP assessment,
particularly as CAPD is a complex disorder that frequently
defies specificity. In addition, families often become
immersed in their child's difficulties thereby limiting their
objectivity when considering the source of problems.
Families did not make any referrals for CAP evaluation
based on emotional-behavioral symptoms, suggesting that
they are unaware of this association, or this concern is not
apparent in a home environment, or they consult specialists
other than the audiologist in this regard. Notwithstanding the
importance of parental referrals for CAP assessment, it
would be a difficult task to apprise parents with the appropri-
ate knowledge on a widespread basis. This fortifies the rele-
vance of school staff and M/AHPs in detecting criteria for
audiological CAPD referral.
Limitations
This sample was conducted on clients attending a private
audiological clinic, and the origin of the sample may possibly
be limited in generalizability, although no state-funded ser-
vices for CAP testing are available in this state. In addition,
participants in this study were collapsed into one sample
from the age range 7 to 11 years. It would be interesting to
increase the sample size and examine possible developmen-
tal differences that might alter the referral source and
concerns.
Conclusion
The findings of this study suggested that school staff were
the primary referral sources, while literacy, speech, language,
and academic underperformance were the primary concern
necessitating referral for an audiological CAP assessment.
This suggests that for educators, CAPD is connected to gen-
eral concerns about children's underperformance at school.
School staff are at the forefront of contact with children's
listening and learning difficulties and are therefore in one of
the best positions to identify children that require an audio-
logical CAP assessment. In addition, their training in educa-
tion positions them to be alert to behaviors and symptoms
that could suggest the need for referral. Dialogue between
school staff and audiologists should be cultivated to further
define the referral criteria for CAPD evaluation.
Human Subjects Approval Statement
At the time of the assessment, all parents/guardians signed
and dated an informed consent form for their case records to
be used in any current or future research projects. They were
provided with a copy of the informed consent form which
also assured them that they could withdraw their participa-
tion and inclusion in research studies conducted by this clinic
at any time, which none did.
