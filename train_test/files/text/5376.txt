Introduction
Analysis of public expenditure constitutes a central issue in
public sector economics and public finance literature.
Looking at the public expenditure in the form of publicly
supplied goods and services, and other public spending, a
series of issues has been addressed. According to Bergstrom
and Goodman (1973), the costs of providing these goods and
services are borne by the community and the demand for
them is decided collectively. Many developing countries are
currently undergoing substantial macroeconomic and struc-
tural adjustment. Whether or not such programs are affecting
government expenditure and hence longer term economic
growth and poverty reduction is still not clear. Fiscal opera-
tions of governments, especially of developing countries, are
crucial because public expenditures provide channels for
their growth.
The link between public expenditure and economic
growth has attracted considerable interest on the part of eco-
nomic researchers both at the theoretical and empirical lev-
els. Roughly speaking, one may distinguish between two
opposing views: On one hand, there is the Keynesian
approach according to which government spending is an
important policy tool to be used to ensure a reasonable level
of economic activity, correct short-term cyclical fluctuations
in aggregate expenditure (Singh & Sahni, 1984), and secure
an increase in productive investment, thus providing a
socially optimal direction for growth and development (Ram,
1986). The opposite view is that excessive state intervention
in economic life affects growth performance in a negative
way for two reasons: First, because government operations
are often conducted less efficiently, they reduce the overall
productivity of the economic system; second, because exces-
sive government expenditure (usually accompanied by high
taxation levels) distorts economic incentives and results in
sub-optimal economic decisions (Barro, 1990; King &
Rebelo, 1990).

Determinants of the Size of
Public Expenditure in Nigeria
Ezebuilo Romanus Ukwueze1
Abstract
Analysis of public expenditure constitutes a central issue in public sector economics and public finance literature. Understanding
the reasons for government spending growth has been a central concern of public sector economists. This is due to the fact
that most economies of the world have consistently had increased government expenditures. Nigeria is not an exception.
There is need to ascertain the determinants of size of government expenditure in Nigeria. Short-Run Error Correction
Model and long-run static equation were used for comparing the influence of those variables on the size of government
spending. The long-run static equation served as a test to compare short-run dynamics with the long-run relationships.
Ordinary least squares (OLS estimation technique was used. The stationarity tests showed that none of the variables was
stationary at level form, but only after their first difference. The results of this study show that the size of revenue and
growth rate of national income (output) and private investment significantly influence the size of public expenditure both in
the short run and long run. External and domestic debts significantly influence the size of government expenditure only in
the short run. It is recommended that the revenue base should be expanded; conducive environment should be created for
private investment to thrive, and debt accumulation should be reduced and used for stabilization only in the short run. The
conclusion to draw from this study is that revenue, private investment, and income boost public spending while public debts
might be counterproductive.

economists going back at least as far as Wagner (1893) and
beginning in more recent times with Downs (1957). An
"excessive" size of government is often alleged to be the
cause of many economic ills in both developed and devel-
oping countries, including slow economic growth, large
government deficits, internal imbalances, and external
imbalances. Studies have given many factors that necessi-
tate the rise in government expenditure as foreign aid
(Heller, 1975; Njeru, 2003; Quattara, 2006; Remmer,
2004; Swaroop, Shikha, & Rajkumar, 2000), external debt
servicing burden (Mahdavi, 2004; Shonchoy, 2010), rising
populations and urbanization (Shelton, 2007), political
regimes and institutions (Milesi-Ferretti, Perotti, &
Rostagno, 2002; Persson & Tabellini, 1999; Shelton, 2007;
Shonchoy, 2010), income (Akpan, 2011; Aregbeyen, 2006;
Henrekson, 1993; Hong, 2015; Hong & Nadler, 2015;
Sideris, 2007), and so on.
Nigeria has consistently had deficit spending over the
years without equivalent rate of economic growth. Data
show that output of Nigeria has been fluctuating for some
years and the sources of these shocks may not be clear. In
2010, the aggregate expenditure of general government
increased by 15.3% from the level in 2009. As a proportion
of GDP, it represented 28.4% as compared with 28.8% in
2009, while the growth rate of GDP was 7.9%, which
exceeded the 7.0% recorded in 2009 and the average annual
growth rate of 6.7% but lower than the target growth rate of
10% for the year (Central Bank of Nigeria [CBN], 2010). In
2014, Edame studied the determinants of public infrastruc-
ture spending in Nigeria, using error correction mechanism
(ECM). He found that rate of urbanization, government
revenue, population density, external reserves, and type of
government jointly or individually influence public expen-
diture on infrastructure in Nigeria. Adebayo, Adebusuyi,
and Ishola (2014) investigated the impact of public expen-
diture on industrial growth of Nigeria and found that gov-
ernment expenditure on administration, economic services,
and transfers maintained a negative long-run relationship
with industrial growth in Nigeria while government expen-
diture on social services maintained a positive long-run
relationship. They concluded therefore that there is no
crowding-out effect.
It is then necessary to investigate the determinants of the
size of public expenditure in Nigeria. This article is poised to
investigate the determinants of the rising tide in public
expenditure in Nigeria. The section "Literature Review" is a
review of relevant literature, the section "Data and Method
of Analysis" dwells on data and discussion of findings, while
the section "Conclusion" concludes the article.
Literature Review
The earliest theory of public expenditure could be traced
to Adolph Wagner (one of the leading German economists
of his time) who in 1883 propounded an interesting
development thesis, which loosely held that as a nation
develops its public sector and consequently public spend-
ing will grow in importance.
The theory of public expenditure is the theory of the costs
of providing goods and services through the public sector
budget and/or the theory regulations and laws introduced that
will result in private sector expenditure. There are two
approaches to the question of growth of public sector, namely,
the growth in absolute size of public expenditure and the
growth in public sector in relation to economic magnitudes.
According to Brown and Jackson (1994), public expenditures
are represented in two broad categories, namely, exhaustive
public expenditures and transfer public expenditures.
Exhaustive public expenditures are government's purchases
of labor, consumables, and capital goods and services. For
them, exhaustive public expenditures are purchases of inputs
by the public sector and are calculated by multiplying the vol-
ume of inputs by the input prices. Economists have argued
that the larger the size of exhaustive public expenditure, the
higher the size of the opportunity cost--crowding-out
effect--of private sector investment.
Following Wagner's Law, as the national income rises,
the public expenditure also rises to meet the demands of
the people. As the economy grows and income rises, the
demand for goods, including public goods will rise, which
as a consequence pushes the public expenditure up. With
rise in per capita income, public provision of consumer
goods also rises.
Relative rise in prices of goods and services, inflation, is
another factor responsible for increase in public expenditure.
Public services will become more costly, but it does not fol-
low that the share of public expenditure for Gross National
Product (GNP) must rise. Population change may also be a
major determinant of the public expenditure share. Changes
in the rate of population growth generate changes in age dis-
tribution, and this trend is reflected in expenditures for edu-
cation as well as care for the aged. Changes in the general
population might affect some services, such as defense,
police protection, or fire protection, whereas, in other cases,
it is a specific section of the population that is of importance
for the provision of the service, for example, the school-age
population in the case of education.
Peden and Bradley (1989) examined the effect of the size
of government on economic output and productivity using
U.S. data for 1949 to 1985. They concluded that the "level of
government activity in the economy has a negative effect on
both the economic base (GDP) and the economic growth rate
(GDP growth)" (p. 239). Peden and Bradley concluded that
the size of government, "beyond the optimal point" (p. 243),
resulted in lower GDP, lower rates of GDP growth, and sig-
nificant deterioration in productivity.
Fölster and Henrekson (2001) examined the growth
effects of government spending and taxation in "rich" coun-
tries. Fölster and Henrekson limit their study to rich coun-
tries due to differences in the composition of government
Ukwueze 3
spending between rich and poor countries. Covering the
period from 1970 to 1995, Fölster and Henrekson find a
robust negative relationship between government expendi-
ture and economic growth. Dar and AmirKhalkhali (2002)
studied the impact of government size on productivity in
19 Organisation for Economic Co-oOperation and
Development (OECD) countries between 1971 and 1999.
They found that total factor productivity growth and the pro-
ductivity of capital are weaker in countries where the size of
government is larger. They also found that those countries
with smaller governments enjoyed efficiencies resulting
from fewer policy-induced distortions (e.g., burden of taxa-
tion), greater market discipline, which fosters more efficient
use of resources, and the absence of crowding-out effects
that weaken incentives for capital investment.
Public debt impacts on the allocation of the public budget
to the extent that it favors government spending in some sec-
tors and not others. As suggested by Alesina and Tabellini
(1990), debt accumulation is very instrumental in the alloca-
tion of the public budget. This is supported in the literature
by Mahdavi (2004), who found that external debt has an
important role to play in the allocation of the public budget.
He found that external debt impacts the structure of the pub-
lic budget by increasing some shares of the public budget
while starving other sectors. This relationship, as argued in
the literature (Mahdavi, 2004), reflects a greater role for the
government as the economy becomes more complex and the
demand for public goods and social programs rises. On this
basis therefore, we may infer certain changes in the composi-
tion of public spending as the role of the public sector
changes in the process of development. At the early stages of
a nation's development, the government gets involved in
almost everything in the economy. But as the economy
begins to develop and private sector expands, the govern-
ment usually divests from some sectors and concentrates on
the provision of pure public goods.
The demographics of the population are important in the
internal allocation of the public budget. For example, a popu-
lation structure with a high proportion of 0 to 14 years sug-
gests that the government will be compelled to channel more
budget allocation to education to provide the necessary edu-
cational resources and health spending to provide for the pri-
mary health care. However, a high proportion of the
population above 65 years will occasion a shift of the budget
to the social services to provide for old age pension and
grants. Other aspects such as the population size and density
and urban population are also important in the internal distri-
bution of the budget. Because government spending, espe-
cially health care and social security, tends to be related with
the demographic structure of any economy, we need to take
into account the variations of dependency ratio of the popu-
lation (Remmer, 2004; Sanz & Velzquez, 2002).
Size of government as proxied by the ratio of government
expenditure to GDP to measure the burden of government on
the economy is also found to influence the direction of public
expenditures (Nyamongo & Schoeman, 2007). As observed
by Mahdavi (2004), the relative size of government serves to
capture the effects of more cyclical factors, such as changes
in the tax base and government non-tax revenues. It is also
argued that the size of government is also associated with
factors that may impact the composition of total spending.
These may include the level of corruption, exposure to exter-
nal risks such as trade shocks, and internal risks such as
political instability and social conflicts.
Advocates of aid argue that aid helps developing coun-
tries to release binding revenue constraints, strengthen
domestic institutions, pay better salaries to public employ-
ees, help in poverty-reducing spending, and improve the effi-
ciency and effectiveness of governance (Brautigam & Knack,
2004). On the contrary, higher aid inflows could promote
rent-seeking behavior by domestic vested interests that seek
tax exemptions or to avoid paying taxes, which lead to reve-
nue decline (Clements, Gupta, Pivovarsky, & Tiongson,
2004). Also, critics argued that aid could lead to increased
public and private consumption rather than investment, and
could have contributed less to growth (Papanek, 1973;
Please, 1967; Weisskopf, 1972).
The relationship between public capital spending and pri-
vate investment has become an important topic of discussion
and study in economic literature. Several researches on this
topic have produced ambivalent and controversial results:
Some support the idea that public capital spending crowds in
private investment, while others support the crowding-out
theory. Studies have shown that public investment spending
and private investment are complementary rather than sub-
stitutable (Lynde & Richmond, 1992). According to them,
the categories of public capital spending, which include
expenditure on research, roads and transport, water and
power projects, education and health, increase productivity
of the private sector and automatically spur the growth and
development of an economy. A study carried out by Foye
(2014) investigating the determinants of public capital
spending in Nigeria, using Error Correction Model, found
that real GDP, government debt, trade openness, private
investment, and foreign direct investment are among the
macroeconomic determinants of public capital spending. It is
necessary to note that public expenditure on education and
health improves the productivity of labor and hence of the
economy. Therefore, rising private investment is a signal to
policy makers to increase in public expenditure on public
development (capital) expenditure.
In similar way, employing data on manufacturing firms
over the period 1970 to 1978, Deno (1988) finds evidence
of a complementary relationship between public and pri-
vate capital. While Jenkins (1998) concludes that in the
long run, aggregate public investment has either an ambiv-
alent role or plays no role at all in determining private
investment expenditure, Ndovorwi (1997), however, con-
cludes that public infrastructural investment is positively
related to private investment in the long run. However,
4 SAGE Open
Ndovorwi (1997) used quarterly data, which he interpo-
lated, but Jenkins (1998) used annual data and both studies
were for Zimbabwe. Muyambiri, Chiwira, Batuo, and
Chiranga (2010) investigated the relationship between
public and private investment spending for Zimbabwe,
using the Accelerator model and tested Pairwise Granger
causality, and found that private investment granger causes
public investment.
It has been noted in literature that the political environ-
ment rather than the economic alone affects the public
spending among countries. For example, a study by Nadler
and Hong (2011) on how political and institutional factors
have affected the U.S. fiscal variables, using standard mul-
tiple regression analysis, found that controlling for a range
of economic variables, high public sector union member-
ship, strong collective bargaining rights, and a strong dem-
ocratic orientation in the state legislature were associated
with increased yields, reflecting higher default risk. They
find that, all things being equal, states with weaker unions,
weaker collective bargaining rights, and fewer left-leaning
state legislators pay less in borrowing costs at similar levels
of debt and similar levels of unexpected budget deficits
than do states with stronger unions and more left-leaning
legislators.
In 2015, Hong and Nadller carried out a study to deter-
mine whether political and institutional factors are ger-
mane in determining how the U.S. fiscal variables are
affected. One of their findings is that a strong democratic
orientation in the state legislature is significantly associ-
ated with an increase in the perceived risk of the state. The
results further suggest that, controlling for a range of eco-
nomic variables, high public sector union membership,
the absence of right to work laws, and strong collective
bargaining rights are significantly associated with an
increase in the perceived risk of the state and that the right
to strike did not have any meaningful association with
state bond yields.
Furthermore, Hong (2015) sought in his study to deter-
mine the impact of budget rules on the U.S. fiscal policy
outcome and whether the impact depends on political and
economic environments. He found that balanced budget
rule is an important factor for fiscal policy outcome. He
also suggests that the impact of budget rules depends
greatly on political environments, especially on the party
identity of the executive power, that budget rules are much
more binding when the governor is a Republican, but the
identity of the party controlling the state legislature did not
have a significant impact. He further enunciated that the
impact of budget rules also depends on whether the gov-
ernment is divided. Budget rules were less binding in
divided branch government, in which one party controls
the governorship and another controls the legislature,
while the impact of the rules was largely unaffected under
divided legislatures, in which different parties control each
legislative chamber.
Okafor and Eiya (2011) studied the determinants of
growth of government expenditure in Nigeria using ordi-
nary least squares (OLS) and found that population, public
debt, total government revenue, and inflation were all sta-
tistically significant at 5% level, while inflation was not.
Edame (2014) studied the determinants of public infra-
structure spending in Nigeria, using ECM. He found that
rate of urbanization, government revenue, population den-
sity, external reserves, and type of government jointly or
individually influence public expenditure on infrastructure
in Nigeria. Aregbeyen and Akpan (2013) studied the long-
term determinants of government expenditure in Nigeria,
using a disaggregated analysis. In their analysis, they
found that foreign aid is significantly and positively affect-
ing recurrent expenditure at the expense of capital expen-
diture; that revenue is also positively affecting government
expenditure; that trade openness is negatively influencing
government expenditure; that debt service obligation
reduces all components of government expenditures in the
long run; that the higher the size of the urban population,
the higher would be government recurrent expenditure on
economic services; strong evidence that Federal govern-
ment expenditure is biased toward recurrent expenditure,
which increases significantly during an election period
than would otherwise be the case. Similarly, Adebayo et al.
(2014) investigated the impact of public expenditure on
industrial growth of Nigeria via co-integration and causal-
ity and found that government expenditure on administra-
tion, economic services, and transfers maintained a
negative long-run relationship with industrial growth in
Nigeria while government expenditure on social services
maintained a positive long-run relationship. They con-
cluded therefore that there is no crowding-out effect. From
these studies reviewed, there is evidence that all the stud-
ies combined economic, social, and political determinants
of government expenditure in Nigeria.
Data and Method of Analysis
The data for this study were collected from the CBN publica-
tions, namely, Statistical Bulletin for 2008 and 2012, and
Annual Reports for 2010 and 2012 (Central Bank of Nigeria,
2008, 2012). The data spanned from 1961 to 2012 and the
software used was STATA Version 10. The size of revenue
was derived by taking the ratio of total government revenue
to GDP, while size of the public sector was derived also by
taking the ratio of public expenditure to GDP. To capture the
determinants of the size of public sector, short-run Error
Correction Model and long-run static equation were used for
comparing the influence of those variables on the size of
government spending. The choice of the model is based on
the necessity to understand the link between the size of pub-
lic expenditure and its determinants in the short run and how
this relationship is transmitted into the long run. However,
the long-run static equation served as a test to compare the
Ukwueze 5
short-run dynamics with that of the long-run relationships.
The estimation technique used is the OLS due to its features
of best linear unbiased estimates (BLUE).
Time Series Characteristics
The variables used for the determinants of public expendi-
ture size were tested for stationarity. The Augmented
Dickey­Fuller test and Phillips­Peron test were used for all
the variables used as determinants of public expenditure, one
complementing (confirming) the other. Table 1 shows the
stationarity of all the variables.
From Table 1, it could be seen that output growth is not
stationary at the level form but became stationary after the
first difference. The calculated value for the output growth
at first difference is 5.648 in absolute value, and is greater
than the absolute values of the critical values for 1%
(3.580), 5% (2.930), and 10% (2.600) levels of signifi-
cance, respectively. The Phillips­Perron test also con-
firmed that the growth rate of output is not stationary at
the level form.
The stationarity test for the external debt (by Augmented
Dickey­Fuller) shows that it is not stationary at the level
form, while with Phillips­Perron test it is also non-stationary
at all level of significance.
A closer look at Table 1 for the domestic debt clearly
indicates that the absolute values of the critical values for
the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels of significance are all greater
than that of the calculated value, which implies that
domestic debt is non-stationary at the level form. The
Phillips­Perron test also confirms the Augmented Dickey­
Fuller test.
The size of the public revenue is stationary at level form for
all levels of significance. The Phillips­Perron test also con-
firms this result at the same levels of significance. The p value
for the tests show their respective values of .0001 and .0001
for the Augmented Dickey­Fuller test and Phillips­Perron
test, respectively. Finally, investment is stationary at first dif-
ference forAugmented Dickey­Fuller test and Phillips­Perron
test at all levels of significance.
Results of the Determinants of the Size of the
Public Sector
The results of the determinants of public expenditure are
stated in Table 2. The results of the Error Correction analy-
sis for the determinants of the size of the public sector
show that some variables are significant in the short run
while others are significant in the long run. All the vari-
ables were non-stationary at level form but became sta-
tionary at the first difference; therefore, they entered the
model in their first difference (their order of integration).
Different models were estimated for this, but the discus-
sion is based on the robust estimation. This is because it
produced better and more robust results. The size of reve-
nue (government revenue/GDP ratio) is statistically sig-
nificant at 5% level of significance and thus shows that a
percentage change in the size of revenue will produce a
large percentage change in the size of the public sector.
This implies that the size of government revenue is posi-
tively and contemporaneously affecting the size of the
public sector. The nature of the relationship between gross
private domestic investment and the public expenditure
size is positive in the short run and is statistically signifi-
cant at 5% level of significance. In similar way, the growth
rate of output is positively related with the size of the pub-
lic sector and is statistically significant at 1% level, imply-
ing that increase in national output (income) will
automatically raise the size of the public sector in Nigeria.
Domestic borrowing (debts) helps the size of government
to expand. This is deciphered from Table 2, which shows that
as the domestic debts increase, the size of the public sector
also rises. The variable (domestic debts) is statistically sig-
nificant at 1%.

External borrowing is also another factor that gives rise to
increase in the size of the public sector, because it has a positive
link with the latter and is statistically significant at 5% level.
The speed of adjustment of the model from the short run to the
long run is statistically significant at 1% level and takes about
112% to adjust from the short run to the long period (equilib-
rium). This error correction term is statistically significant.
However, the long-run analysis shows that the size of the
revenue also affects the public sector. From Table 3, we see
that the size of revenue is positively related to the size of the
government and is statistically significant at 5% level.
Similarly, private investment is also positively related with
the size of public sector and is significantly different from
zero at 1% level.
The results from Table 3 also show that growth rate of
output is a determinant of the size of public sector in Nigeria.
It shows that a percentage change in output growth will lead
to 13.7 percentage rise in government expenditure, and is
also statistically significant at 5% level.
Public debts do not determine the size of the public sector
as could be seen in Table 3. It is observed that domestic and
external debts are, respectively, negatively and insignifi-
cantly affecting the size of public sector. From this, it could
be inferred that in the short run, public debts can be growth
enhancing by positively influencing the government spend-
ing, whereas in the longer periods, public debts undermine
economic progress by negatively affecting the public sector.
Conclusion
Because government revenue is a key factor in determin-
ing the size of the public sector, the revenue base should be
expanded beyond oil sector to include other unexploited
solid minerals, agricultural exports, and other avenues that
could increase the revenue base. This would boost and/or
strengthen the size of revenue and thus public sector
expenditure. Private investment and growth rate of output
are also determinants of the size of the public sector.

Investment climate should be made favorable for private
investment to thrive as it would speed up growth of the
economy. It could also be seen that this study supports
Wagner's Law that growth of national income raises the
size of the public sector.
It is advisable that the governments at all levels be very
cautious in the manner they accumulate debts. In the short
run, both the external and domestic debts are contempora-
neously affecting the size of the public expenditure but
have both negative and insignificant links with the size of
the public spending. This looks somewhat realistic because
in the short run, the government makes these borrowings
to offset some imbalances in its expenditure programs and
for stabilization policies, but they (debts) become counter-
productive as government would be tied to some debt obli-
gations--interest payments, debt servicing, repayments,
rescheduling, and so on.
Finally, this study has been able to unravel the puzzle of
what determines the size of the public sector in Nigeria as the
size of revenue, growth of national income (output growth),
private investment, but public debts (external and domestic)
negatively affect the government spending signifying that
they (debts) can only be used to offset imbalances in the
expenditure programs and for short-run stabilization policies
and that they become counterproductive later.
