Riots of the Other: An
analysis of societal reactions
to contemporary riots in
disadvantaged neighbourhoods
in the Netherlands

Abstract
In this article I argue that there has been a change in the dynamics of riots in the Netherlands
from the escalated political protests of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s to public disturbances in
disadvantaged neighbourhoods that lack a clearly articulated political component in the last two
decades. This article examines the societal reactions such recent `riots' evoke and the means
by which the demarcated autonomous and exogenous groups are designated as `the rioters'
through a process of `Othering'. It examines the 2007 `Slotervaart riot' as an exemplary case of
such recent `riots' in the Netherlands. It concludes that placing the focus on demarcated groups
of Others during recent `riots' in the Netherlands allowed broader social problems to be placed
outside the `normal' or `pure' societal body.

Introduction
All societies appear to be subject, every now and then, to collective disturbances of pub-
lic order that are labelled as `riots'.1 Such socially complex phenomena always leave us
with many unanswered questions, such as: what exactly happened, who were the
participants, how did `society' react, and what is the historical specificity of such an
outbreak? This article addresses these questions and aims to contribute to the public and

social scientific debates on the nature and importance of these urban events that have
been reignited in the past decade. This will be done by an analysis of riots in the
Netherlands in the last five decades and of one exemplary case of a recent riot known as
the `Slotervaart riots' of 2007. The focus of this article is thus on collective disturbances
of public order in a Dutch context ­ with a special light on the societal reactions such
riots evoke ­ that highlight the struggle between dominant and subordinate classes and/
or cultures, as well as the labelling processes involved.
Analytical approach
The data used in this article are derived from a review of secondary material on riots in
the Netherlands in the last five decades and from an ongoing study into societal reactions
to Moroccan Dutch youngsters in the Netherlands, consisting of a critical analysis of two
riots in which these ethnic youngsters played a prominent role, namely the 2007
`Slotervaart riots' and 2010 `Culemborg riots', and of a riot in which these youngsters
did not play any role,2 namely the 2007 `Ondiep riots'. These three riots, and the societal
reactions they evoked, have been examined using Cohen's (2002) classic moral panic
theory, which offers a number of sensitizing concepts (Blumer, 1954) for understanding
societal reactions to social deviance, including both `folk devils' (Cohen, 2002) and the
process of `Othering' (Young, 2007). Following Altheide's method of qualitative docu-
ment analysis (Altheide and Schneider, 2013), these sensitizing concepts have been
translated into protocol questions and are used as a focus in the analysis of the media
discourse. This protocol is a way to ask questions of the documents, in order to capture
`definitions, meanings, processes and types'in the media discourses following these riots
(Altheide and Schneider, 2013: 44­5). The answers to these protocol questions found in
the media discourse were then coded in Atlas.ti, using codes comprising a prefix (an
abbreviated precode) referring to the sensitizing concept (the question) and an `open
code' derived from the quotation (the answer). Thereafter, the coded data were com-
pared, categorized and conceptualized (Hennink et al., 2011) in Network Views. The
media discourse is chosen because it is one of the most important arenas of public dis-
course and is a window on societal reactions in a society. It consists of newspaper articles
in Dutch newspapers Telegraaf (TG), De Volkskrant (VK) and Metro (ME), and televi-
sion news programmes NOVA (NO), EenVandaag (EV) and Pauw & Witteman (PW),
published and broadcast in the three months following the triggering event.3
This article is divided into two parts. First, a change in the dynamics of riots in the
Netherlands in the last five decades is delineated, and, second, the 2007 Slotervaart
riot is discussed as an exemplary case of a recent riot in which these changes are
reflected best.
From `political' riots to `social' riots of the Other
A recent history of riots in the Netherlands
During the secularization and cultural and sexual revolutions of the 1960s, social move-
ments, action groups and countercultures, mainly consisting of students, squatters and
716 European Journal of Criminology 13(6)
left radicals, flourished in the Netherlands. Their resistance manifested itself in protests,
provocations and confrontations in public spaces directed at the established order
(Bouabid et al., 2010: 23­5; COT, 2002: 14­20). Some of these politically motivated
demonstrations escalated into riots against the police. On 10 March 1966, a protest by a
left radical anti-authoritarian social movement called Provo, against the engagement of
Princess Beatrix to `ex-Wehrmacht soldier' Claus von Amsberg, escalated into riots
against the police. Three months later, a protest by unorganized construction workers
against vacation salary cuts, supported by Provo and other left radical movements, esca-
lated into riots against the police and a newspaper headquarters (COT, 2002: 17­19;
Duivenvoorden, 2005: 20­4; Fijnaut, 2007: 150­2). Three years later, students' protests
against the Board of the University of Amsterdam, demanding democratization and con-
sisting of demonstrations and the occupation of a part of the university, ended with a
significant confrontation between students and the police (Bervoets, 2011: 343­6).
These escalated protests of the turbulent 1960s proved to be the prelude to more politi-
cal riots in the two following decades, mainly involving squatters and members of envi-
ronmental and anti-nuclear movements. The squatters'movement, which originated in the
1960s and gained more and more influence in the 1970s and 1980s (Van Gemert et al.,
2009: 17­22), was mainly involved in riots that broke out during evictions, such as in the
1974­5 `Nieuwmarkt riots' in Amsterdam (Bervoets, 2011), the 1981 `Pierson riots' in
Nijmegen and the 1990 `WNC riots' in Groningen (Van der Varst, 2011). But the climax
of these `squatters' riots' was during the coronation of Princess Beatrix in 1980. In these
latter, so-called `coronation riots', squatters clashed with the police in several places in the
Amsterdam city centre under the motto `no houses, no coronation' (Duivenvoorden,
2005). The other major riots in the 1970­90 era, mainly involving the environmental and
anti-nuclear movements, were preceded by protests against or blockades of nuclear power
plants, such as in Almelo (1978), in Borssele (1980 and 1987) and in Dodewaard (1981),
or against nuclear weapons, such as the blockades of ammunition trains in 1982 and the
Woensdrecht military airbase in 1986 (Bezuyen et al., 1999).
From the 1990s onwards, the readiness to take action appeared to decline among
Dutch people (Bezuyen et al., 1999: 373­4; Bouabid et al., 2010: 26­7), and the remain-
ing protest movements and other left activists resorted more and more to legal resistance,
or were progressively absorbed into the political system (COT, 2002: 26­33).
Concurrently, the dynamics of riots changed from escalated politically or ideologically
motivated protests, evictions, blockades and other forms of resistance to increasingly
`apolitical' and isolated incidents triggering riots lacking such clearly articulated politi-
cal components (COT, 2002: 33­4). These `social' riots of the last two decades largely
took place in urban neighbourhoods, in contrast to the symbolic places where the earlier
political protests were held, such as the universities, squats and power plants. In addition,
they tended to be triggered by isolated incidents, for example a police shooting of a resi-
dent (see the Graafsewijk 2000, Ondiep 2007 and Slotervaart 2007 riots) or common
New Year's Eve disturbances (see the Oosterparkwijk 1998 and Terweijde 2010 riots).
The urban neighbourhoods that served as stages for these riots are largely disadvantaged
neighbourhoods that harbour an accumulation of social problems (for example, poverty,
unemployment, poor education and housing, nuisance and crime), a general feeling of
injustice and marginalization among the residents, tensions with the police and other
Bouabid 717
public authorities, and a neighbourhood stigma (COT, 1998, 2000; De Haan et al., 1998;
Terpstra and Easton, 2013: 13­16; Van Dam, 2011; Van den Brink and Bruinsma, 2010;
Van Stokkom et al., 2011: 8­11).
Othering the rioters
With this lack of clearly articulated motives in these contemporary social riots, it is more
difficult for the authorities, the politicians, the media, scientists and the general public to
determine who these rioters are and what their motives are. Simultaneously, despite this
lack of clarity or precisely because of this obscurity, `folk devils' (often the usual sus-
pects) are yet simplistically designated in the societal reactions as the rioters, who are
then demarcated as exogenous groups and often differentiated from the neighbourhood
residents as autonomous groups. For example, whereas in the Oosterparkwijk, Slotervaart
(2007) and Terweijde riots, the rioters were claimed to be groups of `criminal youngsters'
who it was suggested had been terrorizing `the neighbourhood residents' long before the
riots, in the Graafsewijk (2000 and 2005) and Ondiep riots, thrill-seeking `football hoo-
ligans' and so-called `riot tourists' flocking from all parts of the city and country for a
`moral holiday' were held responsible for the neighbourhood disturbances. In the
Slotervaart (1998 and 2007) and Culemborg riots, an ethnic Other was constructed,
because Moroccan Dutch youngsters were designated as the folk devils.4 This designa-
tion of simplistic demarcated groups of Others as the culprits (Othering) is explained by
Young (2007) as a natural reaction or solution of a society to increasing ontological and
economic insecurity and increasing pluralism in late modernity. This solution consists of
distancing ­ the blaming of `factors or groups which are seen as unrelated to the normal
functioning social order' (Young, 2007: 142) ­ and of an inversion of the society-and-
crime relation in which riots are seen as an autonomous problem `for' society instead of
`arising from' the problems of society (Young, 2007: 142). Thus, it has tended to be
claimed that the underlying `problems of society' that are strongly reflected in disadvan-
taged neighbourhoods (such as poverty, social exclusion and class differences) have not,
or at least not primarily, caused the disturbances. Rather, the demarcated groups and their
conduct are pushed forward as an autonomous problem for society. For instance, the
analysis of societal reactions to the three-day Ondiep riots revealed a focus on the so-
called `football hooligans'and `riot tourists'as the main culprits, whereas the neighbour-
hood itself and its residents, including their ongoing anger and discontent about the
actions and reactions of the police, their own socioeconomic status, the gentrification
process instigated by local authorities, and ongoing problems with loiterers, were more
usually discussed as the setting for the riots than as the roots of the riots (see also Van
Hulst and Siesling, 2010).
A similar observation is made by Schinkel (2007) in a broader Dutch context, where
he describes a similar urge of the Dutch dominant cultural majority to place social prob-
lems outside of the normal, pure and healthy societal body, by linking them (more spe-
cifically) to migrant cultures and thus enabling assimilation into the `flawless' Dutch
culture and society to be brought forward as `the' solution. This linking of social prob-
lems to ethnic groups, and those of Moroccan ethnicity in particular, can be seen in two
of the most recent riots that took place in the Netherlands, in the disadvantaged
718 European Journal of Criminology 13(6)
neighbourhoods of Slotervaart (2007) and Terweijde (2010). The first of these two riots,
the 2007 Slotervaart riot, will be presented in the remainder of this article, because,
despite being one of the least serious social outbursts of the last two decades, it excel-
lently illustrates the nature of these recent `social' riots in the Netherlands and the
Othering processes they put in motion. Being one of the least serious riots, one could ask
whether these public disturbances can qualify as a riot when compared internationally?
In practice, these disturbances are riots from a Dutch perspective, in which small-scale
and/or one-day riots are more regular than large-scale and/or multi-day riots (Adang
et al., 2010; COT, 2010: 51­2).
Slotervaart 2007: Riots of `the Moroccan Other'
The prelude: The social construction of `the Moroccans drama'
Since the arrival of Moroccan `guest workers' in the 1960s and 1970s, and then their
wives and children during the 1970s and 1980s, the social situation of some of this immi-
grant group has improved, with increasing numbers of Moroccan Dutch succeeding in
education, the labour market and the housing market, and a Moroccan Dutch middle
class emerging as a consequence (Dagevos et al., 2006; SCP, 2009). However, despite
these positive developments, this community, complex and fragmented as it is, is also
subject to a number of negative images and representations, which focus in particular on
some Moroccan Dutch male youngsters who `stand out'in social problems, such as crim-
inality, nuisance, unemployment, high school dropout rates (CBS, 2014) and Islamic
radicalization (AIVD, 2007; Buijs et al., 2006) when compared with other ethnic groups
in the Netherlands. These social problems have gained a prominent role in Dutch public
discourse, especially around high-profile events such as the earlier riots in Slotervaart
(1998), the murder of cinematographer Theo van Gogh (2004), the activities of the
(alleged) Islamic terrorist group known as the `Hofstadgroep'(2004­5), the nuisance and
crime in the Gouda neighbourhood of Oosterwei (2008­9), the travelling of Moroccan
Dutch fighters to Syria and Iraq since 2011, the rise of a `Moroccan mafia' and related
gangland killings since 2012, and the failed jewellery robbery in Deurne (2014). As a
consequence of these events and societal reactions, Moroccan Dutch youngsters have
become the prime symbol of nuisance, crime and Islamic radicalization in cities such as
Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Utrecht, but also in smaller towns such as Gouda, Veenendaal
and Ede. These social problems and debates in the media, political and scientific dis-
course of the last decade, are now being referred to as `the Moroccans problem', `the
Moroccans debate' and `the Moroccans drama' (De Jong, 2007). The 2007 riot in
Slotervaart is constructed as just another episode in this long litany of trouble.
The drama: The police shooting of Bilal B
Slotervaart, a disadvantaged neighbourhood in the Dutch capital of Amsterdam, is known
for its relatively large Moroccan Dutch community, comprising 20 percent overall
(Gemeente Amsterdam, 2015a; 16 percent during the riots in 2007, see Stadsdeel
Slotervaart, 2007) and is often linked to many social problems, including poverty,
Bouabid 719
overcrowded housing, dysfunctional parenting, unemployment, high welfare dependency,
high school dropout levels, language delay, nuisance, crime and Islamic radicalization
(for example, in municipal reports: Gemeente Amsterdam, 2007, 2015b; in the media:
TG, 19 October 2007: 5; PW, 17 December 2007). In 2007, it was also one of the so-called
`Vogelaar neighbourhoods', the 40 most problematic neighbourhoods in the Netherlands
that were part of a national programme for urban improvement led by Secretary Ella
Vogelaar of Housing, Neighbourhoods and Integration (VROM, 2007). On Sunday 14
October 2007, neighbourhood resident Bilal B., a 22-year-old schizophrenic Moroccan
Dutchman on leave from a mental hospital, was shot dead by the police after walking into
the neighbourhood's police station and stabbing two officers. Out of fear of a recurrence
of the 1998 Slotervaart riots, where Moroccan Dutch residents clashed with the police
after a young Moroccan Dutch resident was arrested, the local authorities quickly con-
tacted several influential people and representatives from the neighbourhood in an attempt
to eliminate rumours and speculation about the shooting (Adang et al., 2010: 136­41).
The next day, the identity of Bilal and his Moroccan ethnicity were revealed in an
afternoon press conference, and in the neighbourhood the media had an increasingly high
profile, which caused some tensions with residents and resulted in a television camera
crew being threatened, assaulted and chased away by some residents (for example, NO,
15 October 2007). Yet the local authorities and neighbourhood residents and representa-
tives still managed to maintain calm throughout the day, until around 11 o'clock in the
evening, when residents gathered on the August Allebé Square in front of the police sta-
tion, some out of curiosity and others demanding answers about the police shooting.
From within the crowd, dozens of youngsters began to vandalize public and private
property, damaging cars and setting one on fire, and throwing stones at the police station,
smashing some windows. It took until midnight before the police, who were surprised by
the outbreak, were able to take control of the situation, though even then they were not
able to make any arrests. From that point on, extra police, including riot police, were
deployed to guard the August Allebé Square and to keep the calm. Nevertheless, 19 cars
were set on fire in and around the neighbourhood during the rest of the week, and only
eight people were arrested on suspicion of trying to set cars on fire, none of whom was
subsequently convicted. This collective and spontaneous disturbance of public order on
Monday evening 15 October in Slotervaart and the 19 car fires that disturbed the nights
that followed in the rest of the week have been defined as `the riots of Slotervaart' in
public discourse by different actors (local authorities, politicians, media, etc.), and have
eventually been stored as such in the collective memory.5
The audience: Othering the rioters
It never became clear to the law enforcement agencies, however, who (exactly or even
roughly) the dozens of rioters at the August Allebé Square on Monday were, who contin-
ued setting cars on fire in the ensuing nights, let alone what their (political or ideological)
aims and motives might have been, assuming they had any. Information about those
arrested does not provide an answer, for there were only about 17 in all (and no one was
arrested during the riot on the Monday), the vast majority of whom were quickly released
and never convicted because of a lack of evidence and/or just cause (Police Chief Bernard
720 European Journal of Criminology 13(6)
Welten in PW, 17 December 2007; Mayor Job Cohen in NO, 19 October 2007). Despite
this lack of a clear view, the rioters were nevertheless defined as an autonomous and
exogenous group of `Moroccan youngsters' in societal reactions. Police Chief Welten
(for example, ME, 19 October 2007: 2), Mayor Cohen (for example, ME, 18 October
2007: 1), District Chairman Ahmed Marcouch (TG, 19 October 2007: 5) and other state
officials and politicians (for example, NO, 19 October 2007) explicitly pointed to the
usual suspects: a group of Moroccan Dutch criminal youngsters who it was claimed had
been terrorizing Slotervaart for years. Different estimates were roughly given, with this
group claimed to vary from 20 (TG, 17 October 2007: 3) to 60 youngsters (EV, 27
October 2007), or even sometimes suggested to be surrounded by 150 to 1500 `aspiring
criminals' in the whole Amsterdam-West borough (for example, Mayor Cohen in: TG, 1
November 2007: 37). In the more general social reactions to the violence, Bilal and the
rioters were broadened from a small number of problem youngsters in Slotervaart to all
`Moroccan problem youngsters' in Amsterdam, and at the same time, as we will see
subsequently, were implicitly and explicitly linked to Moroccan ethnicity and culture,
and then linked to the more general so-called `Moroccans problem' in the Netherlands.
Distancing the rioters. This symbolization of the Slotervaart riots as just another episode of
`the Moroccans problem' and `Moroccan youngsters' as the folk devils in societal reac-
tions, comprises the distancing of Bilal and the rioters as `Moroccans'. The first distanc-
ing, concerning Bilal, symbolized him as a typical `Moroccan folk devil', beginning with
the use of his Moroccan ethnicity as a signifier (ethnicization). This started after the press
conference on the day after his death, where the Chief Public Prosecutor of Amsterdam,
Leo de Wit, said of the incident: `It concerns the 22-year-old from Amsterdam of Moroc-
can descent, Bilal B.'(NO, 15 October 2007). What followed was a great many references
in public discourse to the `Moroccan' (VK, 1 November 2007: 3), the `Moroccan young-
ster' (VK, 23 October 2007: 12), the `22 year old Moroccan' (TG, 16 October 2007: 1)
and the `Moroccan from Amsterdam' (ME, 17 October 2007: 3).
The second distancing contained a discussion of three strongly intertwined themes in
public discourse. The first, in which Bilal was presented as `a psychiatric patient', com-
prised an elaboration of his psychiatric history (for example, VK, 16 October 2007: 3)
and a public debate on the treatment of mental illness in the Netherlands in general (for
example, EV, 17 October 2007). The next theme was one in which Bilal was spoken of
as `a hardened criminal', and involved an elaboration of what was taken to be Bilal's
criminal and violent history, despite his not having any police contact in the previous two
years (for example, TG, 16 October 2007: 1 and 3). The final theme involved suggestions
that Bilal was `a terrorist', and claims were made about alleged ties between him and
Mohamed B., the Moroccan Dutch murderer of cinematographer Theo van Gogh in
2004, Samir A., a Moroccan Dutch youngster convicted of planning terrorist attacks in
the Netherlands, and the `Hofstadgroep', an alleged Dutch terrorist network (for exam-
ple, NO, 15 October 2007). Using these three themes (psychiatric patient, hardened
criminal and terrorist), Bilal was linked in the public discourse to wider anxieties that
were part of a perceived `Moroccans problem', namely the relatively high number of
Moroccan Dutch youngsters with mental health issues and criminal records, and the
problem of the radicalization of Moroccan Dutch youngsters in the Netherlands.
Bouabid 721
In a process paralleling the presentation of Bilal, the rioters were also symbolized as
typical `Moroccan folk devils', again through ethnicization and by linking them to the
perceived general `Moroccans problem'. First, through ethnicization, the rioters were
linked to the Moroccan ethnicity with frequent references to `Moroccan youngsters'
(PW, 13 November 2007), `Moroccan criminals' (TG, 21 November 2007: 33),
`Moroccan rioters' (for example, VK, 17 October 2007: 7), `rioting Moroccan young-
sters' (ME, 30 October 2007: 8), `Moroccan ringleaders' (TG, 19 October 2007: 6) and
`riot mocros'6 (ME, 24 October 2007: 16). Second, this symbolization as typical
`Moroccan folk devils' also consisted of the linking of the rioters in public discourse to
a number of other social problems usually linked to `Moroccans', including crime, nui-
sance, unemployment and school dropout. Anti-social and criminal behaviour in particu-
lar were most commonly attributed to the rioters and `Moroccan youngsters' in general.
They were spoken of as `nuisance makers' (for example, PW, 15 October 2007), who
were claimed to be `terrorizing the streets' (VK, 27 October 2007: 15), `loitering' (for
example, PW, 16 October 2007), `aggressive' (for example, VK, 23 October 2007: 12),
`troublemakers'(for example, ME, 19 October 2007: 18), `using profanity'(for example,
EV, 16 October 2007) and `intimidating' (for example, TG, 19 October 2007: 5), and to
be `criminals'(for example, ME, 18 October 2007: 1), associated for example with `theft'
(for example, EV, 16 October 2007), `criminal threatening'(for example, PW, 17 October
2007), `vandalism' (for example, ME, 19 October 2007: 18), `burglary' (TG, 21 October
2007: 3), `arson' (for example, VK, 27 October 2007: 7) and `recidivism' (VK, 3
November 2007: 22­3). Furthermore, the rioters were linked to the general social prob-
lem of `problem neighbourhoods' (for example, VK, 20 October 2007: 22­3; TG, 27
October 2007: 5) and to other riots in which `Moroccans' played a prominent role, such
as the 1998 Slotervaart riots (for example, EV, 27 October 2007) and the 2005 French
riots (for example, NO, 18 October 2007).
Inverting the cause. The roots of this deviant and immoral behaviour by these constructed
`Moroccan' folk devils were mainly sought within two intertwined explanatory frame-
works: culture and structure. The cultural framework locates the overall problem in
`Moroccan culture', mainly by referring to a lack of `integration' into Dutch society or
culture (for example, TG, 17 October 2007: 3) or too much `segregation' from the Dutch
(for example, VK, 20 October 2007: 22­3). Criminologist Hans Werdmölder (VK, 26
October 2007: 11) and journalist Fleur Jurgens (TG, 19 October 2007: 5), for instance,
claim that the deviant culture and morality of `the Moroccans' is the cause for the many
social problems Moroccan Dutch youngsters experience, and they were supported in this
view by several columnists (for example, VK, 27 October 2007: 15; VK, 2 November
2007: 11; TG, 19 December 2007: 3). According to Schinkel (2007), this linking of
social problems and fears to cultures is a result of what he calls culturism (a contraction
of `culture'and `ism'), an equivalent of racism that has risen in the Netherlands since the
1990s, in which social problems are linked not to race but to cultures, and the social
exclusion or stigmatization of peoples is based not on racial but on cultural characteris-
tics (Schinkel, 2007).
The structural framework focuses on the disadvantages of an `underclass' (for exam-
ple, VK, 17 October 2007: 13), including, for example, poverty (for example, VK, 24
722 European Journal of Criminology 13(6)
October 2007: 11), unemployment (for example, PW, 17 December 2007) and poor edu-
cation (for example, ME, 24 October 2007: 16). Yet it is the combination of these two
frameworks that became the most common explanation, with structural disadvantages
being linked to the Moroccan ethnicity, not least by referring to the relatively high num-
ber of Moroccan Dutch suffering from these disadvantages, thus placing these problems
under the umbrella of `the Moroccans problem'(for example, VK, 1 November 2007: 3).
Hence, instead of speaking of general alienated poor suffering from socioeconomic dis-
advantages, the public discourse focused on the ethnic and cultural background of these
designated culprits. An example of the structural cultural link is the association of the
Moroccan ethnicity with dysfunctional families living in disadvantaged neighbourhoods.
These `dysfunctional Moroccan families' are herein linked to `poverty' (TG, 19 October
2007: 5), `large families in small houses' (TG, 21 December 2007: 6), `dysfunctional
parenting' (for example, NO, 19 October 2007), `domestic violence', harmful `imports',
`forced', `cousin' (VK, 17 October 2007: 13) and `inbred marriages' (VK, 10 November
2007: 5), `divorce' (for example, VK, 24 October 2007: 11), and `not knowing how to
discipline children without beating' (PW, 17 December 2007).
These two most prominent explanatory frameworks, and their intertwining, are both
classic examples of liberal Othering, where the Other is problematized and seen as lack-
ing the morality of the dominant cultural majority caused by `cultural circumstances or
material deprivation' (Young, 2007: 5­7). This linking of riots, nuisance, crime, terror-
ism, mental illness, unemployment and school dropout with the Moroccan ethnicity, and
the focus on the `other' Moroccan culture in the search for the roots of the riots, places
these social problems `outside' the Dutch social order and constructs them as imported
`into' society. In other words, it is a `Moroccan' problem, not a `Dutch' problem.
Discourse of Othering. This process of Othering in societal reactions is facilitated by
what Schinkel (2008) calls multiculturealism (a contraction of `multiculturalism' and
`realism'), a discourse that emerged in the public discussion of the immigrant Other
in the Netherlands from the 1990s onwards. In the 1980s and 1990s, multiculturalism
was the dominant discourse in debates on the immigrant Other, in which political cor-
rectness was the norm and a taboo was placed on the linking of social problems to
ethnicities and cultures. From the 1990s onwards, this discourse became increasingly
criticized as being dysfunctional and too `idealistic' and became more and more
replaced by `multiculturealism', consisting of a populist, chauvinistic and `realist'
style of political incorrectness, and a reversed taboo, namely a taboo on the denial of
the link between social problems and ethnicity and culture (Schinkel, 2008; see also
Van Swaaningen, 2005). This relatively new discourse of `multiculturealism' has
been hegemonic in the last two decades in the Netherlands, and has opened the door
for the blaming of ethnic groups (distancing), the search for exogenous roots of social
problems (inversion) and the explicit Othering of ethnic people, because this is no
longer obstructed in the public discourse by the former ambiance of taboos and politi-
cal correctness.
In societal reactions to the Slotervaart riots, this dominant discourse of `multiculture-
alism', plays an important facilitating role and manifests itself in three types of claims in
the public discourse on Moroccan Dutch: denial, neutralization and pampering.
Bouabid 723
First, there are claims of denial in which it is claimed that the problems of `Moroccans'
are being denied and that there has been too little naming of the Moroccan ethnicity and
labelling of `Moroccans'. For instance, Henk Kamp, MP of the Dutch Liberal-
Conservative party VVD, and Mayor Cohen both emphasize that these problems with
`Moroccan' youngsters should not be `denied' this time (PW, 17 December 2007).
Another example is to be found in letters to the editors, where the government is often
accused of `sticking their heads in the sand' for problems relating to `Moroccans' (for
example, TG, 21 October 2007: 6; TG, 4 January 2008: 6).
Second, if `the Moroccans problem' is acknowledged, claims of neutralization are
made, in which it is claimed that these problems are still being nuanced or played down
too much, as when Ella Vogelaar, the Secretary of Integration, was vilified on live televi-
sion by journalist Jort Kelder and author Heleen van Royen for too much nuancing and
playing down of the problems of `Moroccan youngsters' (PW, 13 November 2007).
Third, through claims of pampering, claims-makers complain that the government,
state officials and politicians are being too `soft' on `Moroccans', for example by refer-
ring to the (former) patronizing Dutch governments (for example, TG, 19 December
2007, p. 3), or, more in line with culturism, by accusing them of `drinking too much tea'
with `Moroccans' (for example, EV, 16 October 2007), referring to the Moroccan tea
culture, instead of clamping down on these folk devils.
In conclusion
The 1960­90 era was the heyday for social movements, action groups and countercul-
tures in the Netherlands. Their resistance during these decades often manifested itself in
street protests, which sometimes escalated into `political'riots. From the 1990s onwards,
the readiness to take action declined and the remaining protest movements and other left
activists increasingly resorted to legal resistance or were absorbed into the political sys-
tem. As a consequence, the earlier political riots were replaced by `social' riots lacking
such clearly articulated political components, and which tended to be triggered by `apo-
litical' and isolated incidents in disadvantaged neighbourhoods.
Because of this lack of clearly articulated motives in such recent social riots, it is
increasingly the case that any precise identification of who rioters were initially remains
somewhat obscure for the law enforcement agencies. Yet, in public discourse, the pattern
is for fingers to be quickly pointed at demarcated groups of folk devils, such as the `foot-
ball hooligans' and `riot tourists' coming from `other' cities as the culprits in the
Graafsewijk and Ondiep riots. With this focus on simplistic demarcated exogenous
groups of Others during riots, it has tended to be claimed that the underlying `problems
of society', which are strongly reflected in disadvantaged neighbourhoods, have not
been, or at least not primarily, among the causes of the disturbances. Rather, the demar-
cated groups (for example, `football hooligans') and their conduct (`rioting') are pushed
forward as autonomous problems for society.
The 2007 Slotervaart riot, an exemplary case of such recent riots in the Netherlands,
illustrates how a riot without a clearly articulated political component occurred in a dis-
advantaged neighbourhood of Amsterdam and evoked negative societal reactions that
were primarily and quickly directed at the demarcated ethnic group of Moroccan Dutch
724 European Journal of Criminology 13(6)
youngsters, designating them as folk devils. Within this societal reaction, the riots were
linked to Moroccan ethnicity and to other social problems and fears, such as crime, nui-
sance and radicalization, which are usually linked to this `migrant' group, reproducing
and enforcing the so-called `Moroccans problem'in the Netherlands. With the placing of
this riot under the umbrella of `the Moroccans problem', facilitated by the rise of `cultur-
ism' and the dominant discourse of `multiculturealism', this social problem and its roots
are placed outside of the normal, pure and `flawless' Dutch societal body.
These societal reactions to these recent social riots, in which clear boundaries are
sought and placed between the normal Self and the deviant Other, can be seen as natural
reactions or solutions of societies to increasing ontological and economic insecurity and
increasing pluralism in late modernity (Young, 2007). A consequence of such societal
reactions is that attention in the public discourse is too much focused on these designated
autonomous and exogenous groups of Others (distancing) and on exogenous causes that
are unrelated to the normal functioning social order (inversion), while the underlying
`problems of society' (such as poverty, social exclusion and class differences), which are
strongly reflected in the disadvantaged neighbourhoods where these riots take place, are
pushed to the periphery of attention.

1. `Riots'are social constructs and are therefore placed in quotation marks. For the sake of read-
ability they do not routinely appear in quotation marks in the remainder of the article.
2. The Ondiep riots of 2007 are used as a comparison case to the first two riots to uncover the
unique aspects of societal reactions to the Moroccan Dutch in particular.
