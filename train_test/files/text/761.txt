Effect of Childhood Family Structure on the First Union Formation
and its Cohort Variations: An Analysis of U.S. Family Change using NSFH Data
Akihiko Kato
Abstract
The association between childhood family structure and first union formation has been
explained by two hypotheses. A socialization hypothesis maintains that those who lived in
no-father families in early childhood delay marriage because of insufficient internalization of
traditional sex roles and norms. A stress hypothesis argues that the transition to one-parent
family and/or stepfamily force children and adolescents out of their families into a premature
assumption of adult roles. This study examines these hypotheses using data from National
Survey of Families and Households and Cox regression models. Overall, my findings support
both hypotheses. Due to interaction effects between family structure variables and birth
cohorts, however, the validity of these hypotheses depends on the cohort of sample to be
analyzed. The socialization hypothesis accounts for the marital timing of baby boom cohort
and cohabitation timing of baby bust cohort. On the other hand, the stress hypothesis
accounts for the marital timing of baby boom cohort, and cohabitaton timing of both baby
boom and baby bust cohorts. The sources of these interaction effects can be found in the
relationships between family structure variables and macro variables such as cohort size and
divorce rate.
Key words: marital timing, effect of childhood family structure, event history analysis
