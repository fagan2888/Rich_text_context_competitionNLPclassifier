The micro-dynamics of
power and performance in
focus groups: an example
from discussions on national
identity with the South
Sudanese diaspora in the UK

Abstract
In recent years there has been an increasing recognition that both the content of focus group
discussions and the interaction that takes place form indivisible facets of focus group data.
Interaction, however, is not a neutral activity but one that is infused with the dynamics of power
in wider society and in the immediate context of the discussion. I use Bourdieu's notion of fields
of power to analyse focus group discussions on national identity with South Sudanese diaspora in
the UK. I argue that the micro-dynamics of power in focus group discussions have relevance to the
relations of power in the population group from which participants are purposively sampled and,
consequently, their observation enriches research findings. Further, I observe that the guidance
literature on the conduct of focus group discussions encourages power-reduction strategies, and
requires updating to allow space for the power-infused character of social interaction to manifest
itself.

Introduction
For focus group practitioners, interaction between participants is a defining characteris-
tic of the method: many consider it to be analytically indivisible from the `content' of
focus group data. The opportunity to directly observe participants' interaction is now
recognised as key to its usefulness. Crucial as this development is, it does not go far

enough. Interaction is not neutral; rather, it is shaped by and revealing of the power rela-
tions that exist between group members. Insofar as the characteristics that define the
selection of participants are meaningful categories, the micro-dynamics of power that
play out in a focus group discussion are revealing of those that operate in the wider popu-
lation. The ability to observe these power relations is a significant affordance of the
method, and a major factor that would indicate its selection. However, focus group litera-
ture to date lacks a sufficient account of power. There is little theoretical grounding for
or guidance on the analysis of power in focus group data. Further, literature on the con-
duct of focus groups encourages strategies that serve to minimise power, and thus hide it
from view.
In this article, I exemplify an approach to analysing focus group data, with implica-
tions for the conduct of discussions, drawing on Bourdieu's notion of fields of power.
Participants, I argue, are implicated in positional relations of power which shape their
interactions with each other and, in turn, how knowledge is discursively produced. I
draw on data from a study that used focus group discussions to explore national identity
with the South Sudanese diaspora in the UK. I identify three mechanisms which have
implications for the guidance on conducting focus group discussions: the selection of
participants, the style of facilitation, and the positionality of the researcher/facilitator.
Interaction and power in focus group discussions
Focus groups, broadly defined as `facilitated group activity'(Kamberelis and Dimitriadis,
2013: 6), provide an arena for `performances in which the participants jointly produce
accounts about topics in a socially organised situation' (Smithson, 2000: 105; Smithson,
2008). They are semi-informal spaces where participants, knowingly observed by the
facilitator and (usually) inscribed by a recording device, rehearse social relations. These
performative interactions are mediated versions of the everyday interactions that may
take place without the intervention of the researcher. As a group-based method, interac-
tion between participants is essential to the generation of data. However, there are mark-
edly differing understandings of the epistemological function of this interaction.
A substantial school of focus group research treats interaction as a means of eliciting
more in-depth content. From this perspective, focus group discussions are viewed as means
of `obtaining'participants'pre-existing, personal ideas and opinions, and thus form a `win-
dow' on participants' lives (Wilkinson, 1998; Wilkinson, 2004: 194; CPRC, n.d.). Group
interaction, proponents suggest, serves an instrumental role in data production by bringing
about a `synergy'that elicits `rich details'(Carey and Asbury, 2012: 28). This stimulates `a
more complete picture of attitudes' through provoking agreement and disagreement
(Greenbaum, 1998: 143), and drawing out more sensitive data from participants (Morrison-
Beedy et al., 2001). While interaction is key to the collection of good quality data, it has
done its work, for better or worse, from the moment the voice recorder stops.
This content-driven approach to focus group data has been criticised by researchers
who accord interaction a more wide-ranging role. Following Jenny Kitzinger's (1994)
landmark article, a competing school has emerged giving a more nuanced explanation of
the collective dimension of sense-making that participants engage in. By this account,
focus group discussions themselves constitute a social context, and interactive processes
Ayrton 3
are therefore open to direct observation (Wilkinson, 1998; Wilkinson, 2004; Madriz,
2000; Duggleby, 2005; Halkier, 2010). Interaction is thus treated as an intrinsic aspect of
data, and the content of the data indivisible from the social process that produces it.
The beginnings of an approach that allows space for power are evident in Kitzinger's
early article. She writes:
Interactions can make groups seem unruly . . . but such `undisciplined' outbursts are not
irrelevant or simply obstructive to the collection of data . . . Everyday forms of communication
. . . may tell us as much, if not more, about what people `know'. (Kitzinger, 1994: 109)
Although power is not centralised, an integrative approach to content and interaction
implies allowing sufficient space for it to be expressed. However, guidance on the con-
duct of focus groups remains rooted in the content-driven perspective. Although there is
little explicit treatment of power, it crops up incidentally around two fields of claim: the
relationship between participants, and the relationship between participants and the
researcher/facilitator.
The mainstream guidance literature describes power differentials between focus
group participants as a `plague' resulting in what is constructed as `problem behaviour'
among participants (Krueger, 1998: 57ff; Krueger and Casey, 2015). Power is positioned
as a procedural problem that sabotages interaction and therefore limits data quality - for
example, through preventing the establishment of group rapport, creating reticence to
share or self-censoring, encouraging conformity and silencing (Stewart and Shamdasani,
1990; Greenbaum, 1998; Bloor et al., 2001; Carey and Asbury, 2012). Two strategies
serve to minimise the dynamics of power in focus group discussions. Firstly, the skilled
facilitator may exercise covert and explicit control strategies: for example, through room
layout, body language, seating positions, selective eye contact, interruption, direct chal-
lenge and expulsion (Greenbaum, 1998; Krueger, 1998; Krueger and Casey, 2015; Carey
and Asbury, 2012). Secondly, the selection of `homogenous' participants, who are likely
to share more because they perceive each other as similar (Carey and Asbury, 2012;
Greenbaum, 1998). Taken to the extreme, these measures would produce a heavily sani-
tised discussion which leaves little space for the observation of everyday interaction,
much less any insight into power dynamics within the group.
The relation of the participants to the researcher/facilitator makes an important con-
tribution to the creation of a `permissive environment' which encourages free-flowing
conversation among participants (Krueger and Casey, 2015: 2, 4; CPRC, n.d.). Focus
group discussions are often described as relatively egalitarian, due to participants'
numerical advantage and their collective power through shared knowledge of the subject
matter (Wilkinson, 1998; Wilkinson, 1999; Smithson, 2000). Nevertheless, participants'
perceptions of the researcher/facilitator's authority position and personal attributes
endow them with a disproportionate influence over the discussion (Stewart and
Shamdasani, 1990; Krueger, 1998). However skilled the facilitation, some sources of
power asymmetry are innate and self-evident. In some studies, particularly with tradi-
tionally marginalised groups, researchers have found that authentic sharing is encour-
aged where the facilitator shares a significant aspect of culture or experience with the
group members (Rodriguez et al., 2011; Fallon and Brown, 2002; Caretta and Vacchelli,
4 Qualitative Research 00(0)
2015). Others have found that techniques to de-centre the researcher have served to miti-
gate issues of positionality and power differential (Jakobsen, 2012). In either case, the
position of the researcher/facilitator as an implicitly powerful out-group member is pre-
sented as a problem to be overcome.
Without an explicit theoretical foundation for the micro-dynamics of power in focus
group discussions, recommended practice tends towards the reduction of power between
participants and between participants and the researcher. This serves to manipulate par-
ticipants' performances away from `everyday forms of communication,' and censors an
important aspect of social relations out of the data.
The study
South Sudan seceded from Sudan on 9 July 2011, granting international recognition and
legitimacy for the collectivity that had long been imagined by Southerners (LeRiche and
Arnold, 2012). At independence South Sudan inherited a `fledgling national identity'
based on the `common struggle for recognition, dignity, and equal rights' (Awolich,
2015: 1, 6). It was also clear that a process of nation-building was urgently needed (Jok,
2012; LeRiche and Arnold, 2012; Zambakari, 2013; Zambakari, 2015). On 15 December
2013 fighting broke out between troops in Juba1, sparking a civil war that has been tragi-
cally characterised by the deliberate targeting of civilians and forced exodus of over two
million refugees, with a further 1.9m people internally displaced (figures from November
2017; see HRW, 2014; UNMISS, 2015; UNOCHA, 2018).
The new crisis of national identity that South Sudanese citizens now face is particu-
larly problematic for groups geographically dislocated from the homeland that confers
their political rights and who, as such, are subject to further discrimination and margin-
alisation (Zambakari, 2015). This study explored how a specific group of South Sudanese
citizens ­ the diaspora in the UK ­ jointly articulated their national identity after five
years of independence, and against the troubling historical-social-political backdrop I
have briefly described.
The work of identity negotiation and sense-making in light of present conditions was
something that I believed to be going on amongst the South Sudanese diaspora, but as a
white British woman I did not have natural access to these conversations. Focus group
discussions provided a means of inviting members of the diaspora to model their think-
ing-in-process for an external audience. Directly, this audience comprised a research
assistant, who was also white British and who took notes to aid transcription, and myself;
indirectly, it included the possible academic and non-academic audiences of my research,
of whom participants were aware. Although I was the sole facilitator at times, as I will
examine below, participants spontaneously supported my facilitation efforts by asking
questions of each other, praising and encouraging constructive contributions and chastis-
ing behavior they perceived to be inappropriate to the setting.
The impetus behind the study came from a set of recent-historic photographic images
depicting visual-verbal displays of national identity, such as banners, posters, t-shirts and
placards photographed in South Sudan during the three months prior to the referendum.
These photographs formed a focal point in the discussions through elicitation activities I
instigated and acting as spontaneous points of reference for participants. I facilitated two
Ayrton 5
focus groups, one with men (4 members) and one with women (8 members), all of whom
are adult South Sudanese citizens (including those with dual citizenship) and usually
reside in the UK. They were recruited through the networks of a cultural community
association. Discussions took place in either a community building familiar to partici-
pants, or one of the participants' homes, in June 2016. They were audio recorded and
later transcribed, with some minor abridgement to protect the identity of participants.
The South Sudanese diaspora is a relatively small and highly connected network in
the UK. As a consequence, and particularly in light of the mode of recruitment, partici-
pants were embedded in existing relationships to each other. Where focus groups involve
pre-existing groups, this can provide greater access to everyday conversations, tapping
into group life that exists independently of the research (Bloor et al., 2001; Kitzinger,
1994; Byrne and Doyle, 2004; Carey and Asbury, 2012). Nevertheless, the focus group
context is innately artificial by virtue of the researcher-facilitator's initiation, presence,
tasking, and prerogative to intervene, and is rightly conceived as `somewhere between a
meeting and a conversation' (Agar and MacDonald, 1995: 80; Caretta and Vacchelli,
2015; Morgan, 1998). The use of English, under the advice of gatekeepers, as the lan-
guage of discussions further distinguished them from everyday interactions within the
community.
Power and performance in focus group discussions: a
Bourdieusian approach
In both focus group discussions, individual and communal power was contested as par-
ticipants attempted to position themselves in response to both my questions and contri-
butions by others, asserting, relinquishing and conferring influence, and problematizing
the basis for their corporate empowerment or disempowerment. I have found Bourdieu's
theory of fields of power provides a useful vocabulary for understanding the social prac-
tices that were in play in these discussions.
For Bourdieu, inequality is a fundamental aspect of how social space is organised, as:
an ensemble of invisible relations . . . which constitute a space of positions external to each
other and defined by their proximity to, neighbourhood with, or distance from each other, and
also by their relative position, above or below or yet in between. (Bourdieu, 1989: 16)
He uses the notion of `field' as his overarching metaphor to theorise how power struc-
tures the objective positions of agents (individuals, groups and institutions). Fields are
multi-level, `nested' sites of struggle (Wacquant, 2013: 276) which operate semi-inde-
pendently at four levels: the field of power, the general field under examination, the
specific field, and the agents within that field constituting a field in themselves (Thomson,
2012). The criteria by which focus group participants are selected projects the existence
of fields at these levels. In this study, since the focus was national identity and belonging,
participants are located in national-community fields at the macro level of the general
field. At the meso level of the specific field, the South Sudanese diaspora in the UK
forms a semi-autonomous field with its own internal dynamics and admission criteria. At
the micro level, by virtue of being drawn from a shared field with a specific focus, a
6 Qualitative Research 00(0)
particular resource at stake (knowledge) and with relatively stable boundaries (set by
who is invited and the limited time available), participants in a focus group discussion
form a field in themselves.
Although distinct from one another, Bourdieu suggested that fields are homologous,
which he defined as bearing a `resemblance within a difference'(Bourdieu and Wacquant,
1992: 106): they share similarly patterned and predictable practices and similar kinds of
agents dominate in each social field (Thomson, 2012). Attention, therefore, to the mic-
ropolitical, routinized exercise of power in group discussions has the potential to reveal
global regularities of power within the population from which participants are purpo-
sively sampled. If these micro-dynamics of power are observed and allowed to play out,
analysis may reveal how these dynamics are implicated in the topic under discussion
(Morley, 1999; Blase, 1991). This is only possible if the groups are conducted in a way
that allows sufficient space for power.
In the following analysis, I use aspects of Bourdieu's theory of fields to illustrate how
power operated in these focus group discussions, and what implications this has for the
guidance literature. Participants' names have been changed to pseudonyms of their
choosing.
Defending, contesting and relinquishing the rules of the game
Bourdieu uses the analogy of a game to describe the operation of relations within a field. The
specific logic of practice within a particular field is governed by rules or, better, `regularities'
which are embraced by players who, by the very act of playing, `accord . . . that its stakes are
important . . . and worth pursuing' (Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1992: 116). Agents may resist
through attempts to change the `tacit rules'of the game (Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1992: 99).
However, more frequently they will use strategies to transform the field and their position
within it within the `rules of the game,' although doing so inadvertently serves to reinforce
existing power relations (Bourdieu, 1998 [1996]: 40-41; Bourdieu, 1989).
In the context of a focus group, for a discussion to be successful the researcher/facili-
tator hopes that participants will be `taken in by the game' of knowledge co-production
and will `collude' in its construction (Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1992: 98). Some of the
`rules' that apply are inferred from the semi-informality of the setting ­ in this case, con-
ventional practices familiar to meetings in the UK, such as speaking in turn, submitting
to the chair's direction and staying for the duration. Others are explicitly stated in the
verbal invitation to participate, the written participant information sheet and the verbal
briefing/introduction to the discussion. By these means, the researcher/facilitator makes
clear their expectation that participants will engage in discussion with others about the
imposed topic and that everyone will have equal chance to speak. An unintended conse-
quence of consent processes is that participants `sign up' to play according to the stated
rules of the game. At different times, participants in the diaspora focus groups defended,
contested and relinquished the `rules of the game.'
Defending the `rules of the game' included participants explicitly clarifying what was
expected of them, challenging each other when another member deviated from respond-
ing to a question that had been asked or spoke in a language other than English, advocat-
ing on someone else's behalf when they were interrupted so that they could finish what
Ayrton 7
they were saying, or affirming my role as `chair,' encouraging others to respond to my
interventions.
The following excerpt took place about mid-way through the men's discussion, and
exemplifies both contestation and defence of the `rules of the game.' Other participants
had previously challenged Bel Pen about the length of his contributions, which they
considered to be inequitable given the parameters of time. We were mid-way through an
activity where each member of the group chose a photograph that particularly struck
them. Bel Pen had chosen a picture but instead of describing it he had offered a reinter-
pretation of a personal account another participant had given, sparking some debate. This
exchange follows my intervention to return to the activity and ensure other members also
had the opportunity to choose a picture:
Bel Pen: I haven't finished. You want me to finish, or that is okay?
Rachel:
Oh, yeah, if you want to say something [particularly about that
image . . .
Bel Pen: [Because I was never allowed to finish . . . My contribution
Rachel: I'm sorry ­ it's because we have a limited time, you know?
Bel Pen: (laughs)
Paul:
When you hear the record here (gestures to voice recorder) you are
the one, [your voice is . . .
Bel Pen:
[It's not about the time you are talking, it is about how much can you
give as a good contribution to this research . . . for example. And if
you cannot definitely when you talk more it means you have more
information. And if you talk less it means you are satisfied with the
few information that you give. So here . . .
John: That's an interesting way of looking at it Bel Pen.
(laughter)
John: But carry on.
Rachel: We can maybe debate that one later ­ tell us about that picture.
Bel Pen:
Really, these little girls here [Amos: Yeah; Rachel: Yeah] had the
feeling like me that this means peace, it means there will be no
bombing, no fighting, nothing at all [. . .] And she was right, and she
was right. Whatever happened after that, whatever war you guys had
done after that, that was not in, in, in her mind, completely. She was
free, she was free like me, on that day.
Amos: Good point.
John: Mmhmmm.
At this and various points in the discussion, it seemed that Bel Pen was working to a dif-
ferent set of regulations which caused ongoing conflict within the group. He valued
speaking at length without interruption and often made comments on a range of issues on
his way to reaching his main point. For Bel Pen, the capacity to make what he perceived
to be a more informative contribution to the topic was of greater importance than allow-
ing even contributions between participants, and so he contests their attempts to defend
the `rules of the game' as they saw them. However, he proceeds to complete the task of
8 Qualitative Research 00(0)
describing his chosen photograph, and this adherence to the `rule'of answering questions
is endorsed and encouraged by Amos and John, as well as myself.
Although silence is a normal feature of social interaction (Smithson, 2000), prolonged
or deliberate silence can be a means of relinquishing the `rules of the game' through
asserting the power to not speak. In the women's discussion, one participant made only
one contribution, which was in response to my direct request for her to describe the pho-
tograph she had chosen:
Achol:
Why when people talk about Sudan I keep quiet, because it makes
my body, my head, my bottom, my heart (gestures), because I am
very happy when er, we got er, referendum I though we going,
because the people died in Sudan not me. A lot people lose their
people. A lot people. Any qabayla.
Nyanpath: Any tribe.
Achol: Innit. But me, what, what, what.
Nyanpath:
When you say `what' like that, her close relatives, were killed one
day.
With the support of her peers, Achol eloquently describes the physical manifestation of
her emotional suffering as a result of the post-2013 internal conflict in South Sudan in
which her family members have been killed. Although she did go on to comment on the
picture she had chosen, she maintained her silence for the remainder of the discussion.
Silence can be a culture-bound and context-bound coping strategy which it is important
to recognise, understand and respect (Tankink and Richters, 2007; Brun, 2013) ­ even if
this means contributions between participants will be uneven.
If we treat the performance of power relations as a useful aspect of data, this poses
interesting questions for the approach to facilitation. When participants contest or relin-
quish the stated or implied `rules of the game', should the facilitator enforce them, make
exceptions to them, adapt them, or abandon them? In order to allow space for power, the
researcher/facilitator will generally prefer to be as unobtrusive as possible, which sug-
gests a minimum of control. However, where participants have different understandings
of the `rules of the game'this can generate conflict. The skill of facilitation, then, becomes
to leave as much space for a variety of forms of interaction as possible, whilst maintain-
ing ethical parameters (Kitzinger, 1994; Wilkinson, 1998).
In searching for this balance, the examples described above yield some insights.
Firstly, rather than dismissing some participants' behaviour as `problematic,' `domi-
nant' or `unruly,' it is more informative to attend to the different sources of `rules' that
participants follow and to acknowledge these as worthy of interest in their own right.
Secondly, facilitators can be responsive to the group's self-moderation. This allows
participants to determine what practices are acceptable and unacceptable and the
researcher/facilitator can observe this process of negotiation. Finally, focus group
practitioners need to have a clear awareness of the parameters that we take for granted
and those that we impose, implicitly and explicitly. By questioning these, it becomes
possible to apply them flexibly, and to open as many `rules' as possible to negotiation
with participants.

Negotiating a game of shifting stakes
Fields are arenas of struggle for valued resources, or `capitals,' the relative values of
which differ between fields, and it is this process of valuing that differentiates between
fields and between agents within fields (Grenfell and Hardy, 2007). Those forms of capi-
tal that are recognised as at stake in a particular field hold `ace card' status (Bourdieu,
1989: 17). These are transformed into symbolic capital, the monopoly of which confers
symbolic power: the `legitimate mode of perception' that yields the capacity to name, to
categorise, and to impose recognition, thus consolidating existing social arrangements
and the patterns of dominance therein (Bourdieu, 1985: 730; Bourdieu, 1989; Bourdieu
and Wacquant, 2003; Swartz, 1997; Bourdieu and Thompson, 1991).
Within focus group discussions, the resource at stake is knowledge relating to the topic
at hand. The right to speak, and the authority with which one's contributions should be
weighted, are a space of contestation. Participants draw on other resources which confer, or
diminish, either their own or others' authority to speak. Due to the homologous relation
between multi-level, nested fields, the resources that are mobilised within a focus group
discussion are related to those that carry weight in the specific field and the general field.
Conversely, participants occasionally make explicit statements about power hierarchies,
and the resources that underpin them, in the general/specific fields. These shed light on the
categories that influence participants' performances of power in focus group interaction.
Attention to both overt statements and the bases on which participants valorise or down-
play contributions within the discussion shed light on relationally valued capitals.
In the men's group, an explicit discussion arose around the position of the specific
field ­ the South Sudanese diaspora ­ in the general field of South Sudanese society.
Following a question posed by John exploring the relative influence of the Western dias-
pora, Amos outlines the basis for their shared marginalisation within the general field of
South Sudanese society. He argues that `a complete class system has already developed',
with (ex-)soldiers who fought in the SPLA2 at the top, followed by those civilians who
remained in South Sudan during the war, then the East African diaspora, and finally `the
last people at the bottom' are the Western diaspora:
Amos:
Cause they say, `You ran away, neither did you join the war front, nor
did you stay under the bombs, when we were being shelled,' or
starved, or whatever.
Amos' discourse identifies the efficacy of certain resources in gaining recognition, influ-
ence and position in South Sudanese society. These relate to direct participation in the
freedom struggle, physical presence within or proximity to the homeland, and participa-
tion in suffering. Within the discussion, criteria emerging from this structure were refer-
ence points by which participants evaluated the authority of contributions to the discussion.
None had been soldiers; however, those who had spent a significant amount of time living
in South Sudan referred to this as a basis for their superior knowledge. Those who had
spent relatively little of their adult life in South Sudan worked hard to demonstrate how
physical absence did not prevent them from being deeply connected to the land and the
people ­ for example, through regular visits, frequent contact with wide networks in their
home community, use of Sudanese Arabic and through up-to-date knowledge about what
10 Qualitative Research 00(0)
is happening in the country through personal contacts and monitoring blogs, national tel-
evision and other news media. At different times, participants appealed to their connec-
tions with family and wider community networks in South Sudan:
John: I wasn't around in Kokora3 days, all I know is everything I hear, okay?
Similarly, Paul commented:
Paul:
There are so many history that South Sudanese people don't know ­ it
is unwritten. I tell what I also hear from others.
By identification with their home communities, participants could share in the legitimised
knowledge-base of those networks. Participants in discussions referred to other categories
which conferred (or diminished) either their own or others'authority to speak: deference to
age, valuing of education, and historical-political literacy. This exchange follows from a
discussion of the likelihood of external intervention providing a successful solution to the
conflict, in particular by ensuring there is justice for human rights violations:
Liz:
This er, joint monitoring and evaluation [¹commission ­ they are not
doing it because (Public figure A) [²is threatening them.
Shola:
[¹Ah they are not doing anything
Cynthia: [²They are not doing anything
Shola: (Public figure A) is threatening them.
Liz: They are threatening them.
Nyanpath: Eh!
Liz: They are doing nothing.
Shola: (Public figure A), (Public figure B), er . . . and that, that other one.
Nyanpath: (Public figure C)
Lamba:
Mama mama you are really clever, you know all of them! Me I
don't know anybody!
Liz, Shola, Cynthia and Nyanpath share knowledge of current political initiatives and the
barriers to their success, including the interventions of key political figures. When Lamba
interjects, she singles out Nyanpath, an elder in the group, and after respectfully address-
ing her as such she praises her for her political knowledge and, through juxtaposition,
devalues her own ability to contribute. Traditional aspects of culture remain important;
nevertheless, the rapid emergence of South Sudan as a modern state since 2005 has cre-
ated a state of flux. This uncertainty as to the `stakes of the game' has opened opportuni-
ties for agents to creatively mobilise new categories. During an early monologue about
how she was happy to be separated from the North due to the inequalities South Sudanese
experienced, Oliba makes this argument:
Oliba:
But now, we are alone, we're still suffering, I don't know until when .
. . because I am non-educated, I am non-politician, I'm talking as a
primitive woman. But, without primitive, who can vote you to come as
Ayrton 11
a President? Those people without an education is the one, they use it.
And then brought them up.
Although Oliba classifies herself in relation to her lack of education and position, she turns
this negative assessment on its head through identifying with the power of those lacking in
education, through democratic processes, to elect the President, and conversely his depend-
ence on their votes to be `brought up' to his position. The sense of agency and dignity that
she expresses as a voting citizen directly challenges her self-appraisal as a `primitive
woman' that would traditionally have marginalised her right to speak.
Comparative attention to the expressed bases of power in the general/specific field and
the categories to which participants give credence in assessing the relevance of contribu-
tions is a useful analytic device. It enables insight into processes of valuing capitals that
structure power relations in the field of the focus group, as well as in the specific and gen-
eral fields which form the substantive interest of the study. This is only possible through
engaging participants who are different in key respects. However, as I have discussed,
guidance recommends that participants are `homogenous,'in order to reduce any `interfer-
ence'by power differences. True homogeneity between participants, of course, never really
exists (Kitzinger, 1994). In this study, for example, I held separate groups with men and
women to accommodate gendered patterns of social interaction. I could have made further
sub-divisions - for example, by age, level of education, duration of residence outside South
Sudan or to separate out the narratives of different ethnic communities. However, this
would have reduced the potential for power to be observable. By allowing the heterogene-
ity that exists in the specific field to be reflected in the composition of groups, the resources
that effectively conferred power became evident. This enabled participants to negotiate
over the relative value of these resources and discursively reconcile differences. A better
principle of focus group sampling is commonality, rather than homogeneity. This shifts the
priority from eliminating power to creating a sub-field that captures some of the diversity
of the wider field of interest from which participants are drawn. Indeed, through allowing
heterogeneity within commonality, participants themselves can theorise about why diver-
sity, expressed through dissent, exists, and how this affects them.
Mobilising the boundaries of the field
Fields are conceived as relatively stable, where the specific logic of the field and those
capitals legitimised in it provide clear boundaries by which agents are recognised or
excluded from participation. Nevertheless, Bourdieu suggests that there are relationships
of exchange between fields, and the boundaries of the field themselves are sites of contesta-
tion (Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1992). In a focus group discussion, I have suggested that the
sampling criteria postulate shared characteristics between participants which are commen-
surate with their positioning within a specific field, of which the focus group is a sub-field.
Who is present and the time that is allotted make the boundaries of the space fairly stable;
however, depending on their own positionality in relation to the research focus, the
researcher-facilitator may be positioned within, at the margins of, or outside this field.
Within this discussion, my positionality was an anomaly as I was not part of the field
from which participants were drawn ­ the South Sudanese diaspora in the UK. Therefore,
12 Qualitative Research 00(0)
although I clearly had a role in the sub-field of the focus group discussion, my position in
it could not follow the same logic as participants' positions in relation to each other.
Participants frequently made great efforts, without prompting, to include me through
explaining cultural references, filling in historical background, and translating when oth-
ers made use of Arabic. These useful interventions included me in their community of
understanding, whilst highlighting my distinctness from it. They also emphasised our
commonality as citizens/residents of the UK, with a shared understanding of the political
freedoms and processes we enjoy. In an early monologue, for example, Bel Pen used our
shared understanding of the rights held by UK citizens/residents to humorously relay his
discovery of these privileges when he arrived in the UK, implicitly drawing a contrast
with the unfamiliarity of such freedoms for South Sudanese citizens who have not expe-
rienced transnational migration:
Bel Pen:
And then when I came here I found that there were like . . . oh equal
rights for blacks, and women, and different religions, they are all
displayed here. And I asked myself, `Can I be free in this country?
Can I be equal to anybody? Oh!' When I got the British passport, `Is
my passport, this passport, the same that is the same passport the
Queen has? Is this true?! I cannot believe it! . . . Oh! I am a human
being! Oh! I cannot believe it!' You can never find this in, in the
Sudan.
Participants were also aware that I had been to Juba, and generously assumed a certain
amount of knowledge on my part ­ for example, while relaying how a demonstration in
Wau4 had been violently quelled Cynthia inserted, `I'm sure you heard about the incident
that happened recently'. Through these measures, participants actively diluted the
boundaries of the field to include me within the sub-field of the discussion that they were
constructing.
Nevertheless, participants were able to mobilise the boundaries of the field through
using my outsider presence to strengthen a rhetorical purpose. This forms part of a
response by Cynthia to my question about what connects members of the group person-
ally to each other:
Cynthia:
Aaahhhh, I have to start! (general laughter) Oh I have to start! I
think it means identity. It means home. We don't go home often [. .
.] So, this is to to me the South Sudanese community here is like, er,
er, a glimpse of home. You know? And um they, I, I run to them for
support, just to talk the language. And, and, and I don't have to
make up myself. Like if I'm, I'm going to speak to a white lady for
you for example, oh God, I have to push all these things in a cup-
board in my head, so I do not have to express myself. But with them,
I just feel at home.
Nyanpath: <click>
Cynthia:
You understand? So, yeah, it's everything. It's what keeps me going.
You haven't been in a foreign land, it's tough. Different culture.
Ayrton 13
Different faith. Even all this freedom, sometimes too much freedom
is, is (laughing) even scary.
Liz: Is a problem.
Cynthia, with supportive interjections from Nyanpath and Liz, builds a compelling pic-
ture of shared identity within the diasporic community, which is enriched through the
contrast between their experiences and my position as an indigenous British woman.
Through naming the racial-cultural and migratory boundaries of the field, Cynthia is able
to persuasively elucidate the basis of their solidarity by drawing attention to my privilege
outside of the conditions of self-censorship and marginalisation that they tolerate. Thus
a flexible and shifting orientation to the boundaries of the field is a useful device which
participants can enlist to perform ideological work.
Although with some communities and in relation to some topics it may be prefera-
ble for the focus group facilitator to be a relative in-group member, it is clear that the
same person occupies multiple real and perceived positionalities. The fact of the facili-
tator's distinctive role in the group and the implications this has in terms of their cre-
dentials necessarily distinguish them from other participants. Where there is a
particularly steep power gradient between participants and the facilitator, such as
across majority/minority world difference, this can override the researcher/facilitator's
attempts to reposition herself (Jakobsen, 2012). In this case, as a clear outsider, partici-
pants had the opportunity to cast me in a variety of roles: as a chair, a safe third party
(Kelman, 2005), a witness, an ally, a conduit to a wider audience, and a student in need
of instruction. Further, they mobilised the porous and dynamic boundaries of the field
to include and exclude me at different points in the discussion. From a field perspec-
tive, `insider' and `outsider' are negotiable categories. Participants can use their indis-
putable position within the field to foreground aspects of the researcher/facilitator's
identity that enable them to accomplish rhetorical tasks. The apparent status of the
researcher/facilitator is not as important as the way that boundaries are creatively
extended and contracted by participants, and to what end.
Conclusion
Power is an inevitable facet of social life and the fields of power from which focus
group participants are purposively drawn. It is therefore not only inevitable that power
will be manifest in focus group discussions ­ it is desirable. I have argued that power
is under-theorised in focus group methodology, and undervalued as a rationale for
selecting the method. There lacks a conceptual framework to enable the analysis of
power in focus group data, and the guidelines on focus group conduct treat power as
a procedural problem to be minimised and mitigated. This serves to conceal an impor-
tant aspect of social relations, and distorts the interaction that the researcher/facilita-
tor seeks to observe.
Nevertheless, approaches that take seriously the importance of interaction in focus
group discussions lay crucial groundwork for making the most of focus groups'
capacity for revealing power. Pierre Bourdieu's notion of fields of power provides a
flexible `thinking tool' to open up this opportunity. The homologous relationship
14 Qualitative Research 00(0)
between multiple, nested fields suggests that the micro-dynamics of power that are
performed in focus group discussions are revealing of those that pertain in the wider
population from which participants are drawn. To the extent that the field theorised
through sampling characteristics is meaningful, field mechanisms are likely to be
present in focus group discussions. Therefore, mechanisms such as the `rules of the
game', the valuing of capitals, and the boundaries of the field provide useful analyti-
cal tools to understand the dynamics of power within focus groups. During the course
of focus group discussions, participants lay claim to power, surrender it, confer it on
others, negotiate its bases, harness its dynamics to strengthen a rhetorical purpose,
and reinforce or question its corporate experience. The way that these processes play
out is not only important for understanding the kind of data that focus groups pro-
duce: it provides valuable insights into the relational significance of the substantive
topic that is the focus of discussions.
An approach which centralises power requires some rethinking of the standard guid-
ance for the conduct of focus group discussions. Received wisdom on approaches to
facilitation, sampling and the position of the researcher/facilitator is geared towards pro-
ducing content rather than co-privileging interaction. The observation of power requires
sufficient space for its performance by participants in a social situation that is semi-
informal ­ both structured and familiar. This can be achieved through flexible facilitation
that enables negotiation of the `rules'that researchers impose; through recruitment based
on commonality; and through attention to the multiple, flexible positionalities of facilita-
tors and how these are mobilised. Such measures shift the conduct of focus groups away
from control towards the managed cultivation of field conditions. There are very few
areas of social scientific study where the social implications of power are not of interest.
The reorientation of focus group methods towards allowing space for the micro-dynam-
ics of power to be observed is the next key area for literature concerning both the conduct
and analysis of focus groups to explore.
