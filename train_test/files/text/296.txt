Abstract
Objective: To estimate the impact of foetal nutritional status on cardiovascular risk
among children with the Foetal Nutritional Status Index (FNSI), calculated by dividing
the child's birth weight (BW, kg) by the mother's height (m2).
Design: Cross-sectional survey analysis.
Setting: A sample of children from the US Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey.
Subjects: A total of 3109 children who were 5­11 years of age and had data on BWand
mother's height. Non-fasting blood samples were included.
Results: Overall, the FNSI was positively associated with BWand negatively associated
with mother's height (P , 0.0001). Within sex-specific quintiles of FNSI (third quintile
as reference) adjusted for potential confounding variables, cardiovascular risk factors
tended to be `higher' in the lower quintiles for males while the opposite was true for
females. Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that the odds for males in
quintile 1 was 2.4 for having a low level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(P , 0.01) and 2.1 for having a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors (P ¼ 0.01); for
females, the odds of having a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors was approximately
two times higher for those in the first and fifth quintiles, who also had a significantly
higher prevalence of central obesity.
Conclusions: The FNSI may be a potential proxy indicator of foetal nutritional status
and it may be used to test specific hypotheses of whether foetal nutrition restriction or
overnutrition programmes future cardiovascular risk.

Metabolic syndrome
A group of risk factors, including high levels of blood
pressure, triglycerides (TG) and glucose, along with low
levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and
central obesity, are highly associated with insulin
resistance and they are often clustered among individuals
with chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease
(CHD)1, type 2 diabetes2 and certain type of cancers in
adults3. Results from recent research suggest that
environmental factors in utero or early life may have a
profound influence on the initiation of insulin resistance4.
It has been observed that individuals with low birth weight
(BW) are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD),
type 2 diabetes and some other chronic diseases5­9. These
epidemiological observations plus evidence from exper-
imental studies has led to the developmental plasticity
hypothesis that the risk of developing some chronic non-
communicable diseases in adulthood is influenced not
only by genetic and adult lifestyle factors but also by
environmental factors acting in early life; metabolic
changes among those individuals with low BW may be
the result of foetal adaptations to inadequate intrauterine
nutrition; and individuals developmentally adapted to one
environment may be at risk when exposed to another
when they are older10,11.
Although BW is the most commonly used index of foetal
growth, it may not be the most biologically pertinent
outcome in reflecting foetal nutritional status and its
impact on human health12,13. In contrast to the link
between low BW and a group of chronic diseases, a
positive association has also been persistently observed
between BW and attained body mass index (BMI), a
measurement of body fat distribution4,14, and persons who
are overweight or obese, measured as high value of BMI,
are at increased risk for CVD and type 2 diabetes1.
The nutrition available to the foetus represents a
balance between the interests of the mother and of the
foetus15; foetal nutritional status is determined by both
pregnancy needs (foetal growth and maternal metab-
olism) and nutritional supply16. In general, food or
nutritional supply is not a major concern in the developed
countries. Therefore, BW can usually be simplified as a
result of a balance between foetal growth and maternal

maintenance metabolism during pregnancy. Hence, it
would be expected that taller mothers, generally, are more
likely to have relatively large babies compared with
shorter mothers; however, it may mean that tall mothers
and their babies are at a relatively higher risk of
undernutrition as well, because they need more food
supply for foetal growth and the maintenance of normal
maternal metabolism. On another hand, it would also
suggest that short mothers and their babies are at relatively
higher risk of overnutrition because they demand less
food to supply their needs. To describe this phenomenon,
we propose the Foetal Nutritional Status Index (FNSI),
calculated by dividing the child's BW (kg) by the mother's
height (m2). We hypothesise that both foetal over- and
undernutrition may be associated with a poorer cardio-
vascular risk profile among children; this may help explain
the growing prevalence of insulin resistance in modern
society.
We tested our hypothesis using data from the US Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) and applied the FNSI to examine its
relationship with cardiovascular risk factors among the
NHANES III children aged 5­11 years who had the
necessary information needed for this analysis.
Methods
Study population
Data for this analysis were obtained from the NHANES III
conducted between 1988 and 1994 on a nationwide multi-
stage probability sample of about 40 000 persons including
11 728 children, 2 months to 11 years age, from the civilian,
non-institutionalised population of the USA excluding
reservation lands of American Indians. Of these, 3109
children (1576 males and 1533 females) aged 5­11 years
old had information on BW and mother's height collected
during household interview as well as a non-fasting blood
sample collected at a mobile examination centre (MEC).
Among these 3109 children, 985 children aged 5 and 6
years had birth certificate information, which contains the
official record of BW, gestational age and other birth-
related information. Details of the planning, sampling,
operation, informed consent procedures and measures
taken to maintain confidentiality of information have been
given previously17.
Measures
Birth weight and mother's height
The information on BW and mother's height was obtained
from the questions asked in a household interview of the
parents or guardians of children aged 2 months to 11
years: `How much did the child weigh at birth?' and `How
tall is the child's mother/are you?' For children aged 2
months to 6 years, their parents or guardians were asked
for permission to obtain copies of the children's birth
certificates from the natal dataset prepared by the Division
of Vital Statistics, National Center for Health Statistics; it
provides accurate information on BW, gestational age and
birth order. Other interview variables are described
elsewhere17.
Blood lipids
Non-fasting blood samples were obtained at the MEC for
children aged 5­11 years. Serum total cholesterol values
were determined at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention using a modified ferric chloride technique
(GFAA/Perkin­Elmer Model 3030 and 5100)17. HDL-C was
measured in serum following the precipitation of other
lipoproteins with a polyanion/divalent action mixture and
triglycerides (TG) were measured enzymatically using a
Hitachi 704 autoanalyser (Boehringer-Mannheim Diag-
nostics).
Anthropometric measurements
A standardised protocol was used for all anthropometric
measurements and all examiners were trained in the
standard procedures for obtaining measurements18.
During the physical examination, participants wore only
under-shorts and disposable paper shirts, pants and foam
slippers. Body weight was measured with an electronic
load cell scale to the nearest 0.01 kg. Standing height was
measured without shoes in the Frankort horizontal plane to
the nearest 0.1 cm using a fixed stadiometer. BMI (kg/m2)
was derived from weight and height. Waist circumference,
buttocks circumference, hip circumference and thigh
circumference were measured by trained technicians.
Waist-to-hip ratio was calculated as waist circumference
over hip circumference. Skinfolds were measured using
Holtain skinfold callipers to the nearest 0.1 mm at four
different anatomic body sites (supraspinal, subscapular,
triceps and biceps). Independent measures were taken at
each body site by two technicians, resulting in a minimum
of two skinfold observations for each site when the
difference between the two measurements at a given site
was within a pre-specified tolerance limit. The subscap-
ular-to-triceps skinfold ratio was calculated as subscapular
skinfold over triceps skinfold.
Blood pressure
Blood pressure (BP) was measured three times during the
household interview (trained technologists) and three
more times during the MEC examination (physicians)
using mercury sphygmomanometers and a standard
protocol19. The available measurements (six or fewer) of
the first Korotkoff sound were used to calculate the
average of systolic BP (SBP)17.
Criterion of metabolic syndrome
The metabolic syndrome (MS) in children is evolving and
there is no general agreement about the overall
assessment of this syndrome. However, research indicates

that adulthood insulin resistance is initiated at
childhood20. For instance, childhood BP is a predictor of
adulthood BP21; those who had higher SBP levels
in childhood were more likely to have arterial stiffness in
adulthood22; and the patterning of the risk clustering seen
in adults is present in healthy adolescents and obesity is
the predominant correlate of cumulative risk23. Therefore,
in this study, we used a cluster of cardiovascular risk
factors that are associated with insulin resistance to define
MS. Abnormal levels of cardiovascular risk factors were
defined using the sex-specific third quartile of SBP,
TG, subscapular-to-triceps skinfold ratio (an indicator of
central obesity), and the first quartile of HDL-C (Table 1).
The MS was defined as the presence of two or more
positive components.
Confounding variables
Other variables in the analysis included the child's age at
interview (years), race (1 ¼ white, 0 ¼ non-white),
mother's age at the child's birth (years), mother's smoking
status during the pregnancy (1 ¼ yes, 0 ¼ no) and sex
(when necessary).
Statistical analyses
All analyses were conducted using Stata/SE 8.2 for
Windows (StataCorp). All analyses incorporated the
sampling weights to calculate means, percentages and
regression coefficients and the complex survey design to
calculate standard errors. To examine if the reported BW is
reliable, we used the sub-sample of 985 children who were
5­6 years old and had BW information from both birth
certificate and house interview to compare the differences
in BW between the two sources. Using Cronbach's a24, we
found that the reported BW (mean ¼ 3341.4 g) and the
recorded BW (mean ¼ 3339.2 g) were highly consistent
with one another (Cronbach's a ¼ 0.99). Therefore, we
developed the FNSI using the reported BW (kg) over
mother's height (m2) for the entire sample and the recorded
BW (kg) over mother's height (m2) for the sub-sample. The
association between the FNSI and BW and mother's height
was examined by sex in two ways. First, the three variables
were treated as continuous variables and Pearson
correlation coefficients were calculated. Then the Pearson
x 2 statistic was computed between the FNSI (in quintiles)
and mother's height (inquartiles) and BW (inquintiles); this
statistic was corrected for the survey design using the
second-order correction of Rao and Scott and converted
into an F statistic25.
The means of cardiovascular risk-related variables were
compared and the trends of the means of cardiovascular
risk-related variables were tested by sex among children
within different quintiles of the FNSI after adjustment for
the child's age, mother's age at the child's birth, maternal
smoking status and race. Multiple logistic regression
models were used to assess the association between these
cardiovascular risk factors and the FNSI after adjustment
for the confounding variables listed above. The cardio-
vascular risk factors, including central obesity (1 ¼ third
quartile of subscapular-to-triceps skinfold ratio, 0 ¼ else),
high BP (1 ¼ third quartile of SBP, 0 ¼ else), high TG
(1 ¼ third quartile of TG, 0 ¼ else) and low HDL-C
(1 ¼ first quartile of HDL-C, 0 ¼ else), and MS (1 ¼ any
two or more of the cardiovascular risk factors, 0 ¼ else)
were regressed on four indicator variables created to
represent the FNSI quintiles (with the third quintile as the
reference group). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were computed. Logistic regression
analyses were also repeated on examining the association
of these cardiovascular risk factors and BW in quintiles
(the third quintile as the reference group).
Since the sub-sample of 985 children (486 males, 499
females) aged 5­6 years had additional information from
the birth certificate including measured BW, gestational
age and birth order, we also conducted a similar analysis to
assess the ORs for these cardiovascular risk factors and MS
among this sub-sample with adjustment for gestational age
and birth order with sex combined, as there were not
enough children in this age group to conduct analyses by
sex. In addition, an interaction term between sex and
foetal nutritional status was created and its relationship
with cardiovascular risk factors examined.
Results
The FNSI was highly and positively associated with BW
(Pearson correlation coefficients in the entire sample: 0.89
in males vs. 0.87 in females, P , 0.0001; in the sub-sample:
0.89 in males vs. 0.85 in females, P , 0.0001) and
negatively associated with mother's height (in the entire
sample: 20.34 in males vs. 20.33 in females, P , 0.0001;

in the sub-sample: 20.42 in males vs. 20.40 in females,
P , 0.0001). The distributions of BW in quintiles and of
mother's height in quartiles according to the FNSI in
quintiles are shown in Figs 1 and 2, respectively. The
Pearson x 2 statistics suggest these variables are not
independent from each other (P , 0.001). It is clear that
the majority within the first quintile of the FNSI are those
babies with a relatively smaller BW (67.7% of males and
66.6% of females with BW ,2.9 kg) and with a relatively
taller mother (70.5% of males and 67.5% of females with
mother's height .1.63 m); while within the fifth quintile of
the FNSI, most subjects are those babies with a relatively
larger BW (72.4% of males with BW .3.8 kg and 75.9% of
females with BW .3.7 kg) and with a relatively shorter
mother (72.4% of males and 81.2% of females with mother's
height ,1.63 m). The means (ranges in parentheses) of the
FNSI, BWand mother's height, and means or percentages of
the confounding variables, by quintiles of the index for the
entire sample are shown in Table 2. Compared with those in
the higher quintiles, those in the lower quintiles have a
lower proportion of white mothers, younger average
mother's age at birth and higher proportion of reported
maternal smoking (P-values for trends ,0.05). There are
similar results for the sub-sample (data not shown).
Table 3 summarises the adjusted means for two groups
of cardiovascular risk factors, the variables related to
body fat distribution and the variables related to lipids
and blood pressure. For males, except for the mean level
of HDL-C in the first quintile, there were no statistical
differences in variables related to body fat distribution or
lipids and blood pressure. For females, the mean levels of
most measurements related to body fat distribution
increased with increasing value of the FNSI (P-values for
trends ,0.05). Those in the fifth quintile had the highest
levels of the anthropometric measurements, highest
levels of TG and the lowest levels of HDL-C. However,
in comparison to the reference group, the mean levels of
subscapular-to-triceps skinfold ratio were higher in those
within the first (P , 0.05) and second quintiles
(P ¼ 0.07).
The prevalence and adjusted OR of the cardiovascular
risk factors are shown in Table 4. In males, the odds for
those in the first FNSI quintile was 2.4 times higher in
the low HDL-C category (P , 0.01) and 2.1 times higher
in the MS category (P ¼ 0.01) in comparison to those in
the reference group. In females, approximately 24% of
those in the first and fifth quintiles of the FNSI had central
obesity (OR (95% CI): 2.1 (1.2­4.0) for the first quintile, 2.7
(1.5­4.8) for the fifth quintile). In addition, over one-third
of those in the fifth quintile of the index had higher TG
(OR (95% CI): 2.0 (1.1­3.7)) and lower HDL-C (OR (95%
CI): 2.0 (1.1­3.5)). Overall, the odds of having MS was
approximately two times higher for those in the first and
fifth quintiles compared with those in the reference group
(P , 0.05). When the analyses were conducted using BW
in quintiles (Table 5), the results from males were almost
identical to those using the FNSI. In females, however, no
associations between the cardiovascular risk factors and
BW were observed.
To examine the impact of gestational age and birth
order on the relationship between foetal nutritional status
and cardiovascular risk factors, we repeated the logistic
regression analyses among the sub-sample with additional
adjustment for gestational age and birth order (Table 6).
The results are very similar to those of the entire sample
except for low HDL-C level. There were no interactions
between sex and cardiovascular risk factors (data not
shown) except for the lower level of HDL-C; it indicates
that females in the fifth quintile were more likely to have
lower HDL-C level (OR (95% CI): 2.9 (1.2­7.3)).

Discussion
To overcome the limitation of using BW alone to reflect
foetal nutritional status, we propose using the child's BW
and mother's height ­ two easily obtained and relatively
accurate measurements ­ to create the Foetal Nutrition
Status Index (FNSI): an index reflecting the relationship
between maternal maintenance needs (mother's height)
and foetal growth (birth weight). We argue that although
many factors may affect foetal growth, maternal mainten-
ance needs will have a tremendous modifying effect on
foetal growth when other factors are relatively stable. It is
already noticed that the neonatal phenotype is highly
associated with maternal size and body composition26. For
instance, maternal height is often used as a predictor of
birth outcome27 as well as a rational proxy of maternal
nutritional needs16. It is expected to have relatively larger
babies from taller mothers and to have relatively smaller
babies from shorter mothers; this means that the taller
mothers need relatively more food supply and shorter
mothers need relatively less. As observed from Figs 1 and
2, the subjects within the lowest quintile of the FNSI are
more likely to be lighter babies with taller mothers; in
contrast, the subjects within the highest quintile of the
FNSI are more likely to be heavier babies with shorter
mothers. These results suggest that babies from taller
mothers are relatively more susceptible to undernutrition
compared with those from shorter mothers; while foetal
growth among these shorter mothers is relatively more
susceptible to overnutrition compared with that among
taller mothers.
We reasoned that if both foetal nutritional insufficiency
and foetal overnutrition elevate cardiovascular risk, there
should be evidence that these circumstances are related to
the components of MS. We hypothesised that both foetal
nutritional insufficiency and foetal overnutrition may be
associated with elevated cardiovascular risk among
children. In comparison with the reference group, the
results from the entire sample suggested that the FNSI has
a similar cardiovascular risk pattern as BW in males; the
subjects in the lowest quintile of either the FNSI or BW
have higher risk of MS and abnormal HDL-C. In females,
BW was not associated with MS and cardiovascular risk
factors; however, those within the highest quintile of the
FNSI have higher risk of abnormal cardiovascular risk
factors and MS. These results indicate that foetal nutritional
status has an impact on cardiovascular risk profiles among
children and that BW may not be a good indicator of foetal
nutritional status, at least among female children.
Our analyses suggest that those children who were
subjected to a nutritionally insufficient or an overly
nutritious environment in the foetal stage may have higher
cardiovascular risk factors levels, although the impact may
be slightly different between the sexes. In general, among
full-term singletons, male infants weigh approximately
125­135 g more than female ones28,29. Because male
infants are expected genetically to be heavier than their
female counterparts, mothers bearing males consumed
more energy during pregnancy than mothers bearing
females30; consequently, taller mothers with male infants
are relatively more easily affected by foetal nutritional
insufficiency. Thus, if the metabolic pattern is pro-
grammed during foetal life as suggested by the develop-
mental plasticity hypothesis10,11, then males would be
expected to have a higher level of risk for an abnormal
metabolism pattern among those subjected to a nutrition-
ally insufficient environment in the foetal period than
females similarly exposed. On the other hand, if
overnutrition also affects the metabolic pattern in later
life then females would be more likely to have a higher

level of risk for an abnormal metabolic pattern among
those shorter mothers with heavier babies than would
their male counterparts. Our findings support the
hypothesis that both foetal under- and overnutrition may
contribute the development of insulin resistance, which
may help to explain the epidemic of obesity and its related
chronic diseases.
Several studies have noted the impact of maternal
factors on cardiovascular risk profiles in later life. In a
study of the relationship between BW and cardiovascular
risk factors in 477 Indian children aged 8 years, it was
found that the most insulin-resistant individuals were from
those whose parents were short, but who had grown the
tallest by 8 years of age31. A follow-up study on young
adults who were born during a longitudinal nutritional
supplementation trial in Guatemala was conducted to
examine the relationship between fasting glucose level
and maternal nutritional status, and an inverse association
was found with birth size among women born to fatter
mothers and men born to short mothers32. Results from the
Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey also
indicated that males born small to tall mothers who were
relatively poorly nourished during pregnancy tended to
have the highest low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels
in adolescence16. In addition, an inverse relationship
between maternal height and childhood BP was observed
among UK adolescents33. However, using the FNSI to
reflect foetal nutritional status and examine its cardiovas-
cular risk association is novel. Although our findings
support the hypothesis that both foetal under- and
overnutrition may be associated with abnormal cardio-
vascular risk factors, it is important that additional studies
be performed to confirm these results and determine the
impact of using the FNSI to examine foetal nutritional
status on cardiovascular risk factors among children.
There are several specific limitations in our study that
need to be addressed. First, the mother's height used for
deriving the FNSI was self-reported height from household
interview. However, mothers from the current analyses
were relatively young and the average age of mothers at
the child's birth was approximately 25 years; the results
from studies of the NHANES III suggest that the self-
reported heights are reliable among younger adults34,
especially among younger female adults35. Second, the
measurement of TG level was from a non-fasting blood
sample because of the participants' young age. This may
affect the relationship between foetal nutritional status and
cardiovascular risk factors in the analyses; however, results
from some studies indicated that non-fasting TG levels
were positively associated with central obesity among pre-
school children36 and were a good predictor of CHD risk
among adults37. Third, there were not enough samples to
examine the ethnic differences observed among the
different quintiles of the FNSI.
Notwithstanding these limitations, the strength of this
study is that it is based on the NHANES III sample design

with the rigorously standardised medical examination
including the measurement of anthropometric character-
istics. In summary, our study indicates that the FNSI
derived from birth weight (kg) divided by mother's height
(m2) may be a useful proxy indicator of foetal nutritional
status that can be used to test specific hypotheses of
whether foetal nutritional restriction or overnutrition
programmes CVD risk in adulthood.
