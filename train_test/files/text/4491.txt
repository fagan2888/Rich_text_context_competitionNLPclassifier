Abstract
This article investigates the claims and complexities involved in the platform-based economics of health and fitness apps.
We examine a double-edged logic inscribed in these platforms, promising to offer personal solutions to medical problems
while also contributing to the public good. On the one hand, online platforms serve as personalized data-driven services
to their customers. On the other hand, they allegedly serve public interests, such as medical research or health edu-
cation. In doing so, many apps employ a diffuse discourse, hinging on terms like ``sharing,'' ``open,'' and ``reuse'' when they
talk about data extraction and distribution. The analytical approach we adopt in this article is situated at the nexus of
science and technology studies, political economy, and the sociology of health and illness. The analysis concentrates on
two aspects: datafication (the use and reuse of data) and commodification (a platform's deployment of governance and
business models). We apply these analytical categories to three specific platforms: 23andMe, PatientsLikeMe, and
Parkinson mPower. The last section will connect these individual examples to the wider implications of health apps'
data flows, governance policies, and business models. Regulatory bodies commonly focus on the (medical) safety and
security of apps, but pay scarce attention to health apps' techno-economic governance. Who owns user-generated health
data and who gets to benefit? We argue that it is important to reflect on the societal implications of health data markets.
Governments have the duty to provide conceptual clarity in the grand narrative of transforming health care and health
research.

Introduction
Over the past five years, a burgeoning field of online
health platforms has emerged; in 2014, there were over
100,000 health apps listed in the Google Play Store and
Apple's App Store, and the number of fitness apps has
since been growing explosively (Burke, 2013; Lupton,
2014a). So-called mobile health (mHealth) apps have
drawn much attention from researchers who are inter-
ested in their applicability in clinical or research prac-
tices; as such, they are understandably concerned about
these apps' claims with regard to medical truthfulness,
validity, or accuracy. Much less attention has been paid
to mHealth platforms as techno-economic construc-
tions in the context of a global online infrastructure.
As media scholars, we are interested in establishing a
framework for understanding the claims and complex-
ities involved in the online dynamics in which health
platforms are entangled. Such approach requires a con-
structivist view that examines online dynamics at the
intersection of technology and society.
We will concentrate on a double-edged logic
inscribed in these platforms, promising to offer personal
solutions to medical problems while also contributing
to the public good. On the one hand, online platforms
serve as personalized data-driven services to their cus-
tomers. On the other hand, they allegedly serve public
interests, such as medical research or health education.
In doing so, many apps employ a diffuse discourse,

hinging on terms like ``sharing,'' ``open,'' and ``reuse''
when they talk about data extraction and distribution
(Fiore-Gartland and Neff, 2015). Equally confusing is
how platforms deploy terms like ``communities'' and
``partners'' when they refer to customers or (corporate)
associates in data handling. So how do privatized pre-
rogatives tally with claims that they serve the public
good?
To set up an analytical framework, we will first define
what we mean by ``platforms'' as a technical, economic,
and sociocultural framework for managing online traffic.
Second, we will argue how their dynamics are inscribed
not just in individual platforms but also more generally in
the ecosystem of connective media (Van Dijck, 2013). The
analysis concentrates on two aspects: datafication (the use
and reuse of data), and commodification (a platform's
deployment of governance and business models). We
apply these analytical categories to three specific plat-
forms: 23andMe, PatientsLikeMe (PLM), and
Parkinson mPower (PmP). Each of these platforms
employs the logic of private gain versus public good,
but their claims are different as they operate from differ-
ent organizational premises.
The last section will connect these individual exam-
ples to the wider implications of health apps' data
flows, governance policies, and business models.
Regulatory bodies commonly focus on the (medical)
safety and security of apps, but pay scarce attention
to health apps' techno-economic governance. Who
owns user-generated health data and who gets to bene-
fit? We argue that it is important to reflect on the soci-
etal implications of health data markets. Governments
have the duty to provide conceptual clarity instead of
adding to confusing propositions in the grand narrative
of transforming health care and health research.
The promises and premises of online
health platforms
Over the past 10 years, researchers, patients, and doctors
have discovered major social network sites (Twitter,
Facebook, Googleþ) as platforms for health communi-
cation and research (Fox, 2011; King et al., 2013;
Santillana et al., 2014). Recently, there has been a spec-
tacular growth in the development of specific health and
fitness apps: online services that promise to advance the
health, fitness, and physical or mental well-being of
users. mHealth platforms actively distribute apps and
mobile devices that solicit all kinds of health data--clin-
ical data, performance data, experiential data--that deli-
ver personal information to patients, doctors, and
researchers (Adibi, 2015). Data generated from individ-
uals--the healthy and the sick, the fit and the frail--is
automatically aggregated, analyzed, and processed in
order to inform a variety of services.
We are using the term ``platform'' here to refer to
online sites that facilitate and organize data streams,
economic interactions, and social exchanges between
users. Platforms, in this sense, are neither mere tech-
nical constructs, nor does the term refer to all things
digital (Bogost and Montfort, 2009). Platforms are sim-
ultaneously technological, economic, and sociocultural
configurations (Gillespie, 2010). Their owners and a
wide variety of other societal actors assemble them;
these actors include users, but also companies that
rely on online infrastructures and data. Platforms are
made available through websites and apps.1
All online platforms are mutually connected through a
shared technological infrastructure, which is fueled by
data, directed by algorithms, and structured by govern-
ance protocols and business models. This ecosystem of
connective platforms, which is crucial for each app's
widespread distribution and global reach, is not a level
playing field: some major platform operators in this eco-
system (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and
Microsoft) are more powerful than others. When we
speak of a platform infrastructure for online services,
we refer to the complex interaction between users, prac-
tices, technologies, and business models--a combination
of human and nonhuman actors. Health platforms and
the apps they produce form a rapidly growing field within
this ecosystem; other sectors, for instance the transporta-
tion or hospitality sectors, are confronting a similar devel-
opment, in which many platforms compete for users and
attention, with Uber and Airbnb in the lead.
Online health platforms constitute a wide-ranging
category (Coiera, 2013; Lupton and Jutel, 2015). On
one end of the spectrum, there are fitness apps that
are mostly used for tracking a person's physical per-
formance and condition; examples include Fitbit,
Strava, and Runkeeper. On the other end, we identify
medical apps that are meant for (self-) diagnosis of
symptoms or conditions (e.g., 23andMe, Doctor
Diagnose, WebMD, Virtual Doctor). In between
those two ends are various categories. Patient experi-
ence exchange platforms serve simultaneously as
patients' social networks and data exchanges; examples
include PLM, CureTogether, Health Unlocked, and
Alliance Health (Lupton, 2014b). Health monitoring
platforms help individuals monitor vital signs or symp-
toms of disease; examples include apps for weight loss
(Lose It), sexual activity (SexPositive), sleep cycles
(Sleep Diary), pregnancy (What to Expect), glucose
levels for diabetics (Glucosio, Glucose Buddy), or
symptoms of Parkinson disease (PmP). This typology
is neither exclusive nor exhaustive, but it serves to illus-
trate the broad range of platforms that are currently
being developed.
The growth of health apps is being driven by a power-
ful set of arguments that can be regarded as a ``discursive
2 Big Data & Society
regime'' informing a commons sense logic (Kitchin,2014:
113). Health apps often promise to offer personal solu-
tions to medical and lifestyle challenges--a healthier life-
style, a quick diagnosis, a proper monitoring device, a
speedy update, a form of peer support, etc.--while also
contributing to the public good--for instance, improving
public health, educating a general audience, or contribut-
ing to medical research. Articulating this double-edged
logic, it often remains unclear whom gets served by
data-based platforms: individuals, communities, private
industries, researchers, or society as such. The dual claims
are often articulated in a diffuse rhetoric, where terms
such as ``sharing,'' ``open,'' ``transparency,'' and
``reuse'' seem to be ambiguous, thus propelling different
agendas. As Rob Kitchin (2014) argues, the discursive
regime of Big Data is ``to offer a radically new way of
understanding and managing all aspects of human life''
(p. 114). In this article, we will examine how the ``big
promise'' of public good and private gain is taking
shape as part of a wider struggle over how a data-
driven platform society should be organized.
Digital platforms are also driven by a powerful set of
mechanisms, two of which we would like to highlight
here: datafication and commodification.2 Datafication
is the most fundamental underpinning principle of
health platforms: it means that every aspect of one's
physical or mental well-being is translated into data--
vital signs, objective measurements, subjective experi-
ences, medicine intake, personal information, test
results, etc.--and subsequently can be transformed
into new kinds of value (Mayer-Schoenberger and
Cukier, 2013). Data can be private and personal (e.g.,
recorded symptoms, experiences) or they can be public
and collective (e.g., clinical research data, health demo-
graphics, statistics); data can be user-generated and
reported automatically through devices, such as elec-
tronic heartbeat apps, or users themselves can contrib-
ute data consciously, for instance through deploying
pedometers. The question at stake here is what kinds
of (user) data do platforms collect, how do they collect
them, and how do they process and reuse those data?
Commodification refers to the way in which datafied
information is transformed into (monetary) value. In
most cases, this means we will look at business
models of online platforms, which act as strategic medi-
ators in the process of turning personal data into valu-
able goods. Some platforms sell health information
products to customers sometimes in combination with
advertisements; other apps are free to users in exchange
for their personal data, which may be shared with
paying industrial partners or copatients. Looking at
the governance and ownership of health platforms, we
have to conclude that mHealth platforms are
overwhelmingly for profit. Virtually all platforms col-
laborate with partners, mostly high-tech firms and
pharmaceutical or medical equipment companies;
some also partner with universities, government ser-
vices, or a combination thereof, mixing for profit and
nonprofit. A minority of health platforms is operated
via government or nonprofit organizations, intent on
pursuing public values and yielding public goods.
The question here is which business model is used for
what purposes, who owns and operates the platform,
and who gets to benefit from its products?
In the sections below, we will examine the ambigu-
ous claims by analyzing three digital health plat-
forms: 23andMe, PLM, and PmP. 23andMe was
launched as a medical app that is marketed for
profit. PLM is a patient experience exchange platform
that is ``not-just-for-profit.'' And PmP is a health
monitoring app, which is nonprofit and intent on pro-
viding data to researchers. In the next three sections,
we will analyze how the rationality of personal solu-
tions and public good becomes manifest through the
lens of its underpinning mechanisms--datafication
and commodification. To what extent does it matter
that the three online services operate on the basis of
different economic and organizational premises? Is it
possible, in this ecosystem of online platforms, to
develop noncommercial platforms based on key
public values? To address these questions and find
information about each site's operation and intention,
we have examined their explicit platform policies as
well as interviews with owners or operators in general
information sources and trade journals.
23andMe
The platform 23andMe started as a personal genome
service in 2006, offering customers worldwide a record
of their DNA profile. Data is collected both offline and
online. The offline method is for customers to send in a
bit of saliva through a special kit; after paying a fee,
they receive a complete overview of their genetic
makeup, including a risk report stating their personal
chances for genetic disease and conditions. Besides the
commercial offline transaction of genetic data, the com-
pany approaches customers online to submit phenotype
data through ``fun'' questionnaires that pop up on your
screen. The additional data allegedly help to compile an
even more accurate profile of one's personal state of
health. On the website we can read:
Part of 23andMe's mission is to give people access to
their DNA, and this is just another way to put that
information at people's fingertips. Over time we hope
to improve the app as we get more feedback from cus-
tomers. Along with giving customers access to their
DNA, 23andMe wants to educate people about the sci-
ence around genetics. (23andMe, 2015)
Dijck and Poell 3
Data is collected from customers on two different
grounds: the promise of receiving a validated genetic
profile as well as the promise of donating their genotype
and phenotype data to help genetic research in general
(Harris et al., 2013).
The first promise turned out to be a dubious prop-
osition. In 2013, the American Food and Drugs
Administration (FDA) banned the test kits because
they were giving customers inaccurate information
based on misleading predictive algorithms. As a result
of this setback, the platform dropped the medical com-
ponent and shifted its focus from diagnosis to ancestry
identification. 23andMe currently features a ``genome
compass app'' in the Google Play store and urges its
customers to find out ``what your DNA says about you
and your family.'' However, the platform's website still
hints at its underlying aim to deliver personalized pre-
dictive medicine. In 2014, after slightly changing its
rhetoric, the company sought approval from the
British Health Authority (MHRA) who then argued
that the kit was no longer marketed as a diagnostic
test but as an ``information product.'' As a result,
23andMe can ship the test kit to customers residing in
the UK and 50 other countries all over the world
(23andMe Customer Care, 2015). Since there is no
global guidance for standards reviewing a product's
claims, each company can look for a regional or
national market whose regulatory policies allow it to
be marketed as a medical app (Yetisen et al., 2014: 838).
The second promise that users' genetic information
will be used towards the public interest is part of the
same claim. As Harris et al. (2013: 250) point out,
23andMe's rhetoric slips smoothly from notions of per-
sonalized health care to a celebration of ``consumers''
research participation as a form of ``gift exchange.''
According to the website, the gift of saliva enables med-
ical researchers to find genetic patterns and treatments
for a number of diseases. 23andMe also appeals to
users' need for solidarity in pursuing health-related
goals. The site instills in its customers the noble goal
of giving away their DNA--a sense of collectivity that
emerges independent from the idea of forming a com-
munity. According to the site, donating personal health
details allows researchers, in the long run, to detect
patterns of genetic aberrations and develop algorithms
to predict and prevent disease at the individual level.
Even after the FDA's mandated discontinuation of
23andMe's medical diagnostic prerogatives, the
grander research-oriented goal still echoes on the web-
site now promoting its ``health and ancestry'' app:
We are building a powerful, diverse, and ever-growing
resource for research that combines advances in genetic
analysis with the power of the Internet.. . . So when you
send in that DNA sample, you're not only learning
about yourself, you're joining a community of motivated
individuals who can collectively impact research and
basic human understanding. (23andMe Core Values,
2015, emphases added)
However, the altruistic motives for participating in
genomic sequencing efforts, solicited by appealing to
the customer's inclination to ``collectively impact
research'' are misleading. ``Collective community''
implies there is a kind of active patient group involved
in this effort, which sharply contrasts 23andMe's pro-
prietary claims on these data. In May 2012, the com-
pany was granted a patent for ``polymorphisms
associated with Parkinson's disease,'' sparking a con-
troversy among its clients who felt misled (Sterckx
et al., 2013: 382). To what extent were patients
``tricked'' into donating their data to a company that
subsequently monetized their data gifts? The same can
be said of another acquisition. In 2012, 23andMe
acquired CureTogether--a patient experience exchange
site much like PLM--incorporating the data from com-
munities reporting on some 600 medical conditions.
While 23andMe appears to be part of a gift exchange
where users participate in research, they are in fact part
of a data exchange where individual data is turned into
economic value: data is gathered not with the prime
intention to make them public goods but to privatize
their yields (Harris et al., 2013).
This brings us to 23andMe's business model, which
clearly hinges on two principles. First, it sells ``genetic
profile service kits'' to customers, whom are charged
between $99 and $199. Second, by sending their saliva
samples, customers sign away the right to sell their
information to third parties; in other words, 23andMe
has a right to sell and repurpose its users' data for
financial gain (Sterckx et al., 2013). When the FDA's
ban on the company's medical claims substantially hurt
its revenue stream based on the first model, 23andMe
shifted its marketing strategy to commoditize its lucra-
tive by-product: raw genetic data which can be mone-
tized by giving drug companies access to its resources.
In January 2015, pharmaceutical company Genentech
paid $60 million to 23andMe for accessing its 3000
DNA profiles of patients with Parkinson's disease
(Regalado, 2015).
23andMe's multisided business model is fully
attuned to the larger ecosystem of connective plat-
forms, by distributing its apps through the Google
Play Store. The strategy to find the most profitable
revenue model for a single health app very much
depends on its integration in the app ecosystem of plat-
forms (Ragaglia and Roma, 2014). The choice for
Google is not coincidental; Google was one of
23andMe's first financial investors. Moreover, the plat-
form's owner, Anne Wojcicki, is also the (ex-)wife of
4 Big Data & Society
Sergey Brin, Google's cofounder and executive. Major
pharmaceutical companies and medical product
developers have since invested substantially in
23andMe. Investors envision a future where combin-
ations of health databases are the prime resources for
patentable drugs and treatments. In May 2015,
23andMe announced it would go into drug discovery
and development. The business model thus evolved
from consumer testing service to drug developer,
based on the premise of turning user-generated individ-
ual data into corporately owned private goods. Hence,
the appeal to users to donate their personal data to
researchers for the benefit of the ``public good'' is a
rather dubious claim, as the donation goes straight
into a proprietary platform that monetizes its data
resources for corporate (rather than public) gain.
PLM
The double ambition to serve personalized health
schemes while enhancing the public good also surfaces
in patient experience exchange site PLM
(PatientsLikeMe.com, 2015). PLM encourages patients
to keep track of their personal conditions by uploading
facts about their symptoms, vital signs, and medicine
intake, and also to report more subjective information,
such as experienced pain levels, mood fluctuation, emo-
tional impact, or side effects. Through the website,
users can keep detailed reports, replete with graphs
and charts, and take them to doctors' visits. PLM is
not just used for compiling personalized health reports,
but also for exchanging information and advice, and
for soliciting support from fellow sufferers. The site pri-
marily focuses on creating so-called communities of
patients: individuals suffering from the same disease
can make sense of their data by comparing symptoms,
course of their condition, and effectiveness of treatment
relative to other patients. They can call on each other
for help and support in disease-centered patient assem-
blages. So besides taking the form of structured infor-
mation, datafication of patients' personal illness also
takes place through narrative accounts.
How does PLM gather their data from patients? Most
data collected on this site are solicited from individual
users through various interface prompts and incentives.
Indeed, analyzing self-reported data may be useful for
examining patients' perceived side effects; the online pro-
cess of self-reporting data enables the accumulation of
individual scores. The site deploys so-called patient-
reported outcome measures (or PROMs) to quantify
the patient experience. Such self-reported data on symp-
toms, vitals, treatment, and effects serve to find perso-
nalized remedies, for instance to systematically screen
for signs of depression, to help patients ``capture pain
trends between doctor visits'' or to help people ``choose
between surgical options'' (PatientsLikeMe, 2015). PLM
rewards members who frequently update their informa-
tion with ``stars''; obtaining three stars means you
receive a free t-shirt with the PLM logo.
PLM also collects data by invoking a sense of soli-
darity between patients to entice them into data shar-
ing; the interface organizes its users around disease
categories, ranging from diabetes to cancer and from
ALS to depression. When PLM talks about ``commu-
nities'' it is referring to its patient-support function
where patients can exchange information about their
disease to get peer support in return. It is important
to note that, while PLM may provide individual
empowerment to patients suffering from the same dis-
ease, they do not in principle provide collective
empowerment in the way that activist patient groups
pursue (Wentzera and Bygholm, 2013). As Deborah
Lupton (2014a) found in her research, many health
platforms claim to serve communities:
While some apps may feature the opportunity to people
to engage with a community of like-minded individuals
who are attempting to achieve the same ends, very few
are directed at broader social change or activist politics
in the spirit of the new public health. (p. 615)
It is important to distinguish the ``community'' appeal
to ``share'' personal experiences and private data from
the potential of pursuing collective aims or contributing
to the public good.
The site's contribution to health as a public good
comes in the form of the claim that PLM data inform
a new research paradigm. All personal data generated
through the platform, combined with known medical
data on specific conditions, form the input for
aggregate data sets that researchers may use to find
cures and effective treatments for any ailment.
According to its home page, ``PatientsLikeMe aggre-
gates patient-reported data from over 300,000 members
on 2,300 diseases, analyzes them, and shares the results
with health care and life science companies to accelerate
research and develop more effective treatments''
(PatientsLikeMe, 2015). PLM's philosophy of ``open-
ness'' starts from the idea that sharing ``patient-
reported outcome measures'' with companies and
researchers leads to potential treatments and cures.
Self-reported data constructs the foundation for ``evi-
dence-based medicine'' resulting in personalized health
care and treatment. Data is not just collected from labs,
university halls, or doctors' offices, but from the every-
day lives of patients who diligently report their scores
and fill out the standardized forms provided by PLM.
PLM claims that the site helps patients select and
report health data not just to seek personalized
information and treatment, but also for the greater
Dijck and Poell 5
good: to provide researchers with relevant testing mater-
ial (PatientsLikeMe Data for Good, 2015). The idea of
patient-driven health research, using patients' self-
reported data for clinical testing, has gained traction
over the years. In 2010, PLM used its patient networks
to test a scientific hypothesis propelled by Italian
researchers who suggested that lithium carbonate
might slow down the symptoms of ALS. About 160
user patients obtained the drug and started to self-
track their progress through PLM-validated rating
scales. In less than nine months, this patient-led effort
led to a refutation of the claim originally made by the
Italian scientists--a refutation that was confirmed much
later by three conventional clinical trials. The results
were published in an open access academic paper, com-
plete with data sets and statistical analysis (Wicks et al.,
2011). Patient-led efforts to generate experiential data,
according to PLM executive Paul Wicks, prove that
this new type of ``citizen science'' can complement
large-scale, longitudinal clinical research by conducting
observational research ``on the fly.''
Not unexpectedly, medical researchers have
responded critically to PLM's validity claim: how
valid are the results put forward by this new scientific
paradigm propelled by a health platform and by user
data? Detractors argue that sites like PLM fundamen-
tally breach the protocols of medical research by allow-
ing a group of self-selected patients self-administering
drugs or treatment to self-report results without
proper protocols that guarantee double-blind testing
or control groups (Gorski, 2012). Whereas proponents
like Wicks laud the qualities of speed and direct
involvement of patients, criticasters like Gorski warn
that such patient-driven trials, relying on massive quan-
tities of subjective data, are unscientific experimenta-
tions that benefit neither science nor patients. The
belief in the objectification of self-reported data
should not distract from solid scientific paradigms
such as double-blind testing, he argues. A side effect
of this paradigm shift towards user-generated,
demand-driven data-based health research might be
that it puts the onus of scientific evidence in the
hands of patients, according to Gorski.
The discursive logic of PLM equates user-generated
data with user engagement and parallels patient commu-
nities with ``citizen scientists'' for the benefit of medical
research. How does this relate to PLM's commodifica-
tion strategy, its business model, and governance?
According to its homepage PLM is a ``for-profit com-
pany (with a not-just-for-profit attitude).'' The platform
presents itself in its promo-video as a patient-centered
site; obviously, it has no products to sell like 23andMe's
personal genome service kit, so it positions itself as a
patient experience site--patients helping each other
and themselves with information and tracking. PLM
does not allow advertising on its site; however, it does
sell ``research services'' which means they sell aggre-
gated, anonymized data to third parties.
In contrast to 23andMe, PLM is very explicit about
its intention to sell its users' health data to partners
supporting the platform, which are all listed on their
website (PatientsLikeMe Partners, 2015). These part-
ners include the world's leading pharmaceutical compa-
nies, medical device makers, and research institutions.
How PLM goes about selling data and contracting part-
ners is not described in detail. In all fairness, the website
explicitly warns their users about potential exploitation
of submitted personal data, about example by ``medical
and life insurance companies who have clauses that
exclude pre-existing conditions or employers may not
want to employ someone with a high-cost or high-risk
disease.'' Most PLM users will not read these details;
but unlike many other sites, PLM does not hide this
information in small print user-license agree-
ments--agreements that no one ever reads and which
can be changed without a user's consent.
In line with its ``not-just-for-profit attitude,'' PLM
has to walk a fine line between patient's trust and its
monetizing intentions (Sillence et al., 2013). The site's
invitation to ``donate your data for good'' and to ``make
healthcare better through sharing, support and
research'' reveals an ambiguous claim towards opening
up private health data to benefit the public good. On the
one hand, PLM presents itself as a proponent of open
data; the platform developed an online tool called the
Open Research Exchange--a tool that allows for the
prototyping, testing, and validation of patient-reported
outcome measures, questionnaires that measure symp-
toms and impact (PatientsLikeMe Open Research
Exchange, 2015). However, ``open data'' in the context
of PLM does not mean that anyone can use them; you
have to become a ``partner'' in order to reprocess data
donated by patients--to turn data into validated know-
ledge or as input for new drugs or devices.
Compared to 23andMe, the ``not-just-for-profit''
platform PLM explicates its commercial goal to turn
data into economic value; the qualifier ``not-just''
before ``for-profit'' refers to its function as a patient
experience forum and its support for health research.
Unlike the genome service, PLM defines communities
as patient groups exchanging information about dis-
eases, even if they do not rally around collective inter-
ests. In terms of donating data to the public good, PLM
promotes active participation of users in research. In
other words, users are addressed as consumers,
patients, citizen-scientists, and partners, all at the
same time. The fusion of the platform as an experience
exchange, a data exchange, and a research exchange is
cemented in a dual nonprofit and for-profit business
model. The term ``research exchange'' is equally
6 Big Data & Society
ambiguous, as it turns out to mean that only (listed)
research partners who pay for the privilege can use the
data. Before we turn to the implications of this
ambiguity, let us first look at a site that makes similar
promises from different organizational premises.
PmP
The third platform in our sample analysis solicits patient
data through a health-monitoring app called PmP. Part
of a broader research program, PmP is a ``patient-cen-
tered iPhone app-based study of symptom variation in
Parkinson's disease'' that helps monitor actual patients'
signs in real time (Parkinson mPower, 2015). Such signs
include assessing or measuring tremor, balance,
memory, and gait before and after taking medication.
Using Apple's ResearchKit, researchers gather data
from participants through easy-to-complete surveys via
their iPhones. The study collects additional data
reported by patients themselves, including automated
physical measurements from wearable devices and
assessments through online surveys or designated tasks.
Unlike PLM, PmP uses no reward motivators for indi-
vidual patients, such as gamification elements or t-shirts
(Lister et al., 2014). PmP requests full names, e-mail
addresses, and identity, to make sure they are dealing
with real persons, and it uses the digital equivalent of a
consent form. The site subsequently anonymizes a user's
identity from its data; even though they warn for poten-
tial data breaches, they guarantee users' privacy.
Clearly, the app's prime focus is explicitly on gather-
ing research data that will ultimately help all patients
suffering from this disease. As the website claims:
By participating in this study you will help us learn the
range of PD [Parkinson's disease] symptoms and find
out whether mobile devices can help measure PD pro-
gression and manage these symptoms better. In this
unique study you will be a partner in the research pro-
cess. (Parkinson mPower, 2015, emphasis added)
According to its principal investigator, the reason to
run these studies is ``to see whether we can turn anec-
dotes into signals, and by generating signals find win-
dows for intervention'' (Business Wire, 2015). Scientists
are in great need of precise real-time information about
the various Parkinson's signals to better their under-
standing of disease phenotypes. Research data in PmP
is gathered in a structured fashion as part of a medical
research framework, even if the researchers do not pre-
sume to know exactly beforehand what data to collect
on the basis of a prespecified thesis, ``but instead to
work with patients to learn about the disease, with
the app serving as an intermediary'' (Business Wire,
2015). Patient users are primarily addressed as
``research partners'' in this online clinical study.
There is no explicit promise of helping individual
patients or providing a platform for support and inter-
action; what is learned from user-generated data is later
reported back in the form of a ``dashboard'' that allows
patients to track their personal disease progress.
Data collection through mobile devices such as an
iPhone will likely change the practice of clinical trials. It
is becoming increasingly normal to automatically track
one's vital signs, and PmP smoothly fits the larger trend
to constantly wear monitoring apps to datafy every
movement of an individual--as part of the emerging
``sensor society'' (Andrejevic and Burdon, 2015). As
one of the leading researchers points out, having
20,000 participants in an app-based study can generate
more specific information than most clinical trials that
have at most 500 participants (Business Wire, 2015).
And instead of collecting data from patients every
couple of months, iPhones can collect data every few
days or even hours. Data collection on PmP differs
from PLM because its researchers predefine the param-
eters of standardized tests. Researchers would stand to
benefit most from patients' massive ``gift'' of personal
data; the only promise patients get in return is that
eventually, in the long run, their data might contribute
to (personalized) treatment or cure.
How does PmP's prime aim of contributing data to
the public good of Parkinson's research tally with its
business model and data governance? The platform is
part of a consortium, including medical researchers
from Rochester University, UC San Francisco and
headed by Sage Bionetworks, which is a ``nonprofit
biomedical research organization, founded in 2009,
with a vision to promote innovations in personalized
medicine by enabling a community-based approach to
scientific inquiries and discoveries'' (Business Wire,
2015, emphases added). The organization is funded
by foundational grants, and there is no identifiable
business model, neither to monetize data nor to capit-
alize on research results--confirming its status as a
nonprofit. Sage Bionetworks' grander claim is to ``acti-
vate patients and to incentivize scientists, funders and
researchers to work in fundamentally new ways in
order to shape research, accelerate access to knowledge
and transform human health'' (Business Wire, 2015,
emphasis added). In other words, the platform can be
squarely positioned in the nonprofit health sector,
which means that data will only be used for research
purposes. This does not mean, however, that PmP sub-
scribes to the ``open data'' philosophy, meaning that
anyone (researchers and companies) can freely access
and reuse. We will return to this point shortly.
An interesting additional aspect of its nonprofit gov-
ernance and business model is the fact that PmP uses
Apple ResearchKit for the distribution of its app.
Dijck and Poell 7
Apple ResearchKit is a recently developed hub for
researchers poised to function as data broker; intro-
duced by Apple as an open source software framework,
it allows researchers to create apps for medical
research. ResearchKit works seamlessly with Apple's
HealthKit--a service to store one's personal health
data in a secure location where the user can decide
which data can be shared. Through HealthKit,
researchers can access more relevant physical data for
their studies, such as calorie use, heart rates, step
counts, etc. Integration in the Apple ecosystem of
apps implies both an opportunity and a limitation.
An opportunity because researchers can connect its
research data to ``vital signs'' collected through
HealthKit. A limitation because users of iPhones are
by definition coming from restricted demographic,
age, and gender backgrounds. Moreover, integrating
PmP with the wider ecosystem of major private plat-
forms means data principally become owned and repur-
posed by Apple. As gatekeepers of all kinds of data, not
just health and fitness, these large data exchanges allow
for endless opportunities to combine and reuse stored
databases. Apple's HealthKit, like Google Fit, auto-
matically collects all types of health data from sensors
built into their respective smartphones and other
devices. In the future, it is not unthinkable that tech
companies may operate central storing and processing
locations for health data in the cloud.3 It is thus impos-
sible for individual platforms such as PmP to operate
independent from the general ecosystem's mechanisms
of datafication and commodification; they are
``entangled'' in this larger apparatus, an ``assemblage
of technological innovations, and the social uptakes
of new media technologies'' (Banning, 2016: 497).
Both PmP and ResearchKit are nonprofit organiza-
tions that allegedly serve the public good, but what
exactly do they mean by using the ``partner'' in relation
to their patient contributors, and the term ``open'' with
regards to their data? Of course, the very word ``part-
ner'' is misleading in this context: patients donating
their data are not participating on equal terms with
researchers. They are data subjects and research sub-
jects at the same time. Moreover, the word ``partner-
ship'' is confusing because often times it refers to
companies or research organizations that are indeed
collaborators in a trial. The same ambiguity applies
to ``open.'' Neither Sage Bionetworks nor Apple
ResearchKit (despite its use of open source software)
subscribes to the open data principle, which is a prin-
ciple and standard that is increasingly promoted by
governments and institutions in the public sector.
Open data means that data is not proprietary, but
can be reused by any (app) developer or researcher.
In the larger ecosystem of connective platform, it is
very difficult to define who ``owns'' data or even who
gets access to them and in what form. How data are
used and which analytics are applied remains opaque to
consumers and citizens. According to Nosowitz (2015),
most apps claim to contribute to the world of open data
and to serve the greater good, but they cannot or do not
want to explain to users what happens with their data
in the Big Data universe.
Health platforms as a field
of contestation
The double-edged logic inscribed in mHealth plat-
forms--to offer personal solutions to medical problems
while also contributing to the public good--is part of a
wider struggle over how a data-driven platform-based
society is and should be organized (Rich and Miah,
2014). As we have argued in the previous sections, the
rhetorical strategies deployed by health platforms are
strikingly similar, in spite of their different aims or mis-
sions. All platforms use terms like ``open,'' ``sharing,''
``communities,'' and ``partners'' to convince patients to
volunteer their precious personal data. They are
seduced by promises of personalized health advice,
lured by communal forms of information and experi-
ence exchange, and simultaneously called upon to per-
form their civic duty to donate their data. Evidently,
23andMe, PLM, and PmP operate from distinctly dif-
ferent organizational premises (for profit, not-just-for-
profit, and nonprofit), but their promises are conspicu-
ously similar: they want to transform medicine into
personalized health care with the intention to serve
the public good. When looking at mHealth platforms,
what are the wider socioeconomic implications
involved in this grand narrative?
For one thing, the notion of health care as a public
good for private gain is nothing new: US hospitals and
the health care industry have profited from the appro-
priation and reuse of patients' data for decades. What is
new in this era is the automated collection of large data
flows and the potential to combine health information
with many other data types. Individual platforms
have mounting power to collect and trade voluminous
data sets, and the emergence of dominant data bro-
kers makes all individual platforms prisoners of the
larger connective ecosystem. A score of online broker
platforms such as Validic, Fitabase, Open mHealth--
besides Google's Fit and Apple's HealthKit--serve as
connectors between databases and algorithms. Each of
these brokers aims to make data streams interoperable,
and while some are depending on open source software,
very few of them, including the ones that operate on a
nonprofit basis, aim at sharing all data with all individ-
ual users. There is a growing divide between those who
have access to, and control of, data flows and those
who have not. The ``big data divide'' as Andrejevic
8 Big Data & Society
(2014) argues, aggravates ``the asymmetric relationship
between those who collect, store, and mine large quan-
tities of data, and those whom data collection targets''
(p. 1673).
The power of corporate data brokers is growing at
the expense of collectives and publics, despite the rhet-
oric of individuals as ``partners'' in research.
Governments and public institutions are running
behind in defining what counts as public good in a
databased and algorithmically driven ecosystem.4
Local and national legislators are currently sorting
out important issues involved in the proliferation of
mHealth platforms. Understandably, regulatory
bodies primarily focus on the medical safety and secur-
ity of health apps (Hamel et al., 2014; Treacy et al.,
2015; Yetisen et al., 2014). Privacy is also one of the
important concerns tackled by regulators on both sides
of the Atlantic. Some critics argue that regulatory agen-
cies focusing on safety, security, and privacy are miss-
ing out on the larger implications of the proliferating
mHealth sector as they are ill equipped to address fun-
damental issues such as open versus proprietary data or
collective resources vis-a
` -vis privatized benefits (Seife,
2013; Lupton, 2012; Karanasiou and Kang, 2016).
Indeed, it takes a broader socioeconomic and eth-
ical­legal approach to address such issues and anchor
crucial definitions into society's governance. The ques-
tion of who ``owns'' data, after all, is a complex and
convoluted one because it pertains to a bundle of rights:
the rights of individuals to control one's own data; the
rights of companies to collect, aggregate, and mine
them; the right to trace data back to the data subject,
to name a few. Such profound reflections on the ``own-
ership'' of health data are important when weighing
societal values against economic values in a quickly
emerging global market of Big Data flows. In recent
years, the ``platformization'' of the health sector pro-
pelled by mechanisms such as datafication and com-
modification has triggered responses from both civic
groups and governments to regain control in a ``big
data knowledge economy'' (Ruppert et al., 2015;
Volkmer, 2014). Civic groups such as the Open
Knowledge Foundation have called for ``open data''
defined as data that ``can be freely used, modified,
and shared by anyone for any purpose'' (Open
Knowledge International, 2015).
Governments have also called for ``open data''; how-
ever, their use of the phrase ``open'' is again different
from the meanings we have identified above.
According to the US government, ``open data'' basically
means the freedom to create economic value out of data
collections; in the United Kingdom, open data is con-
sidered instrumental in procuring citizens' access to
affordable services, such as health care or education.
American and European governments have both started
their own ``open data'' initiatives. The American gov-
ernment, through its Health Data Initiative, aims to
make large numbers of public data sets available to sci-
entific institutions and industry innovators.5 They
encourage private companies to monetize open health
data, developing new patentable products. The British
government started Genomics England in 2013, a com-
pany that is fully owned and operated by public institu-
tions, hospitals, and researchers all coordinated by the
NHS (Genomics England, 2015). Genomics England
aims to compile 100,000 genomes in order to stimulate
a UK genomics industry and start a personalized med-
ical service. Both the American and British initiatives
somehow confound ``open'' with ``public'' data, which
is not the same: public is more restricted than ``open.''
Conceptual clarity is often the enemy of popular
rhetorical persuasion. As we have noticed in all three
sampled platforms, frequently used normative concepts
are loaded with ambiguity: ``communities,'' ``partners,''
``public good,'' ``open,'' ``sharing,'' ``exchange,'' etc.
The paradox of private benefit and public good in rela-
tion to health care platforms thrives on the fuzziness of
these terms. The problem is that most concepts are still
cemented in a predigital system of institutional govern-
ance in which corporate, private, government, and non-
governmental sectors were clearly separated--an ideal
that has never actually existed and which has further
disintegrated over the past decades. The three mHealth
platforms analyzed in this article are symptomatic of a
discursive regime that seeks to persuade people into
accepting not only the promise of transformative
health care, but also the societal premises on which
this logic is erected. It is important to expose such fuzzi-
ness in the promotional discourse of the mHealth
sector. Many word pairs--open data and public data,
patient communities and research partners, personal gain
and public good--are used as interchangeable terms,
but they do not pertain to the same set of normative
values and ideals. Governments have the obligation to
stipulate conceptual clarity instead of adding to confus-
ing propositions in the grand narrative of transforming
health care and health research. Citizens need alterna-
tive models of trust for app reviews that are sustainable
and free of conflicts of interest (Powell et al., 2014).
If we regard the emerging sector of online health
platforms as a field of contestation that is still under
construction, it is important to look beyond the utili-
tarian regulatory scope that most governments are cur-
rently envisioning and understand the technical and
social dynamics underpinning the ecosystem. We also
need to develop a more comprehensive view of the pol-
itical consequences of a global platform society that
goes beyond deconstructing digital newspeak. The
ontological distinction between open data and propri-
etary data, the normative division between public and
Dijck and Poell 9
private, and the legal difference between nonprofit and
for profit are the implicit premises on which the double
logic is built. But these diffuse premises do not warrant
the promises of a revolution in mHealth care. Whereas
legislators are commonly called upon to redefine such
ontological and normative standards, their power
seems weakened in the face of an emerging global eco-
system of online platforms whose techno-economic
dynamics appear to operate autonomously. It takes
the concerted efforts of citizens, governments, respon-
sible scientists, and entrepreneurs to secure the checks
and balances in the organization of health care in a
future platform society.
Notes
1. The term ``app'' is used as shorthand for ``application.''
An app is a more specific term than the term ``platform.''
An application causes a computer to perform tasks for
users in order to interact with a data system on a device
(e.g., a mobile phone or a laptop). One platform can thus
issue a number of apps, for different devices or for various
types of users (e.g., data professionals, patients, health
professionals, etc.). Please note: in this article, we some-
times use ``health apps'' as shorthand for their platforms.
2. These two mechanisms are extensively described as part of
an analytical framework in Van Dijck and Poell (2013).
3. In that respect, Amazon also counts as an important cen-
tral hub in the ecosystem. Amazon Cloud Service, like
Google Genomics, offers to store and analyze large gen-
omic data sets.
4. The European Commission is still working on the legisla-
tion of mHealth apps; the European Medicines Agency,
and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory
Agency are expected to introduce guidelines regulating
mobile medical apps similar to the FDA (Green Paper
on mobile Health, 2014).
5. The Health Data Initiative's goal is to make more and
more data from HHS vaults (from CMS, CDC, FDA,
and NIH, to name a few sources) easily available and
accessible to the public and to innovators across the coun-
try. This information includes clinical care provider quality
information, nationwide health service provider direc-
tories, databases of the latest medical and scientific know-
ledge, consumer product data, community health
performance information, government spending data,
and much more.
