Introduction
Since sodium sensitivity (SS) was first reported,1 numer-
ous definitions and methods to depict SS have been devel-
oped and applied in various studies. The common
consensus about SS is that there is the tendency in some
individuals for blood pressure (BP) to decrease during salt
restriction and increase during salt repletion.2 Despite the
difficulties comparing different studies, the prevalence of
SS is approximately 20% in non-hypertensives and about
50% in hypertensives.1-4 In Koreans, SS is found in 18% of
non-hypertensive and 52% of hypertensive subjects.5
Although there is great interest in SS, the underlying
mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Among the vari-
ous risk factors such as genetic factors, ethnicity, age, body
mass index, or disease status, including insulin resistance,
diabetes mellitus, hypertension and chronic kidney dis-
ease,6,7 the renin­angiotensin­aldosterone system (RAAS)
is a key player in the development of SS.
This dietary interventional study was designed to dem-
onstrate the specific responses and roles of renin and
aldosterone, and reveal the relationship between these hor-
monal changes and the amount of sodium intake in normo-
tensive and hypertensive SS and sodium-resistant (SR)
subjects.

Abstract
Introduction: Sodium sensitivity (SS) is a phenomenon in which significant changes in blood pressure (BP) are
observed based on sodium intake. The renin­angiotensin­aldosterone system plays a critical role in sodium handling and
hypertension. We identified the specific responses of renin and aldosterone based on dietary sodium intake and revealed
the relationship between these hormonal changes and dietary sodium intake in patients with SS.
Materials and methods: In total, 61 subjects were available to analyze full data including plasma renin activity (PRA)
and aldosterone. Participants were given a low-sodium DASH diet (LSD) for 7 days and a high-sodium DASH diet (HSD)
for the following 7 days.
Results: SS was found in five (14.71%) in normotensives, and 14 (51.85%) in hypertensives. In sodium-resistant (SR)
subjects, both PRA and aldosterone decreased significantly after consuming HSD. Moreover, a significant correlation was
observed between PRA and aldosterone in SR subjects. In contrast, only hypertensive subjects showed a marked fall in
PRA after consuming HSD (1.299 ± 0.904 vs. 0.593 ± 0.479) among SS subjects.
Conclusions: This study demonstrated the different responses of renin and aldosterone in SS and SR subjects based on
dietary sodium intake whether or not they had hypertension.

Materials and methods
Details of the study methodology have been described pre-
viously.5 Briefly, this study enrolled only normotensive
and stage I hypertensive participants. Hypertension was
defined as follows: 1) a previous diagnosis of hypertension
with or without the current use of antihypertensive medi-
cations; or 2) a systolic blood pressure (SBP) 140 mmHg,
or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 90 mmHg.8
Individuals were excluded if they were taking medications
that affect BP and urinary electrolyte excretion during the
study period. Pregnant or breastfeeding women were also
excluded.
Study design
All participants maintained their usual dietary pattern and
physical activity for 2 weeks before they were hospitalized
for the dietary intervention. During the 2 weeks of dietary
intervention, they were confined to the hospital and per-
mitted to eat only the food provided by trained dieticians.
On the first day of hospitalization, the usual diet without
control of sodium content was given for baseline measure-
ments. During the next 7 days, participants were placed on
a low-sodium dietary approaches to stop hypertension
(LSD DASH) diet (100 mM NaCl/day) and a high-sodium
DASH diet (HSD; 300 mM NaCl/day) for the following
7 days. The amount of sodium in the diets was calcu-
lated based on food composition tables compiled by a
government-related organization.9 Fourteen different diet
types of 2300 kcal/day meals were offered to the subjects.
A 24-h urine specimen was collected to measure the
amount of excreted creatinine, sodium, and potassium dur-
ing the first day of hospitalization and the last day of each
diet period. Fasting blood samples were obtained prior to
the study period, and on the last day of the LSD and HSD
diet periods. A complete blood cell count, total protein,
albumin, calcium, phosphorus, bilirubin, glucose, blood
urea nitrogen, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, tri-
glycerides, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, low-
density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and total cholesterol levels
were measured. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldoster-
one were checked at the same time in the supine position.
PRA was measured by an immunoradiometric assay,10
whereas aldosterone was determined by radioimmu-
noassay.11 Twenty-four hour ambulatory BP monitoring
(24 h ABPM) was measured during the first day of hospi-
talization and on the last day of each diet period using an
automated, non-invasive oscillometric device (P6
Pressurometer; Del Mar Reynolds, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA)
with 30-min intervals for 24 h. SS was defined as an
increase in the MAP of >4 mmHg (p < 0.05) in response to
the HSD, with reference to previous studies.7,12 The mean
arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated according to the
following equation: MAP = (2DBP + SBP)/3.
Statistical analysis
All statistical tests were two-sided, and the level of signifi-
cance was 0.05. Continuous variables are expressed as
mean ± SD, and categorical variables are described by
numbers with percents in parentheses. Demographic and
clinical characteristics are expressed by descriptive statis-
tics for the 101 subjects. The summary statistics are pre-
sented by the SS and SR groups and also stratified
according to all, hypertensive, and normotensive subjects.
We performed an independent two-sample t-test to test the
mean differences between the SS and SR groups. All cat-
egorical data were analyzed using Pearson's chi-square
test. The paired t-test was used to analyze the effect of the
LSD and HSD on the SS and SR subjects. Pearson's cor-
relation test was used for the correlation analysis. All sta-
tistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 18
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Results
Baseline demographic and clinical
characteristics of the participants
A total of 61 participants enrolled in this subanalysis study
(Table 1). Among them, 34 (55.7%) were normotensive,
and 27 (44.3%) had stage 1 hypertension. Abnormal labo-
ratory findings were not observed for fasting glucose,
serum creatinine, serum Na, serum K, total cholesterol,
urinary Na, or urinary K. Among normotensives, there
were five SS participants (14.71%) and 29 SR participants
(85.29%) (p < 0.0001). SS participants were relatively
older than that of SR subjects (60.2 ± 4.3 vs. 47.24 ± 15.40,
p = 0.001). The 24 hr urinary excretion of Na and K was
not different between the SS and SR groups (24 h urine Na,
160.38 ± 47.721 vs. 209.14 ± 69.698, p = 0.1447; 24 h
urine K, 46.08 ± 11.683 vs. 55.555 ± 17.563, p = 0.2255).
There were no significant differences of 24hr SBP, DBP,
and MAP between the SS group and the SR group. Other
variables were not different between these two groups.
Contrary to normotensives, no significant differences were
observed in hypertensive SS and SR subjects for the base-
line characteristics such as enrolled number, age, gender,
body mass index, laboratory data, and 24 h BPs.
24 h BP response based on dietary salt intake
The 24 h BP monitoring such as SBP, DBP, and MAP
changed significantly in response to salt intake in all SS
Shin et al. 119
subjects, whether they had hypertension or not (Table 2).
The BPs of those who consumed the LSD compared with
HSD were: SS normotensives, 24 h SBP, 110.144 ±
11.483 mm Hg vs. 115.076 ± 11.532 mmHg (p < 0.0032);
24 hr DBP, 67.843 ± 5.862 mmHg vs. 73.752 ± 6.365
mmHg (p < 0.0002); 24 h MAP, 81.943 ± 7.488 mmHg

contrast, no significant differences in BP were observed

irrespective of hypertension.
Renin and aldosterone response based on
dietary salt intake
Next, we evaluated the effect of dietary salt intervention
on PRA and aldosterone in hypertensive, normotensive,
SS, and SR subjects (Table 3). In normotensives, the level
of PRA and aldosterone decreased markedly only in SR
after consuming the HSD compared with the level in those
who consumed the LSD (PRA, 2.868 ± 2.311 vs. 1.358 ±
1.342, p < 0.0001; aldosterone, 18.914 ± 10.203 vs. 9.841
± 6.105, p < 0.0001). In SR hypertensives, significant
decreases in PRA and aldosterone were also observed
(PRA, 2.665 ± 1.635 vs. 1.184 ± 0.83, p = 0.0016; aldos-
terone, 21.762 ± 7.365 vs. 10.554 ± 4.398, p = 0.0003), but
only PRA decreased meaningfully in SS hypertensives
based on salt intake (PRA, 1.299 ± 0.904 vs. 0.593 ± 0.479,
p = 0.0193). Statistical significance was not found in
aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR) between SS and SR group
whether they had HSD or LSD diet.

Correlation analysis between PRA and
aldosterone in response to dietary intervention
Correlation analyses for PRA and aldosterone in response
to dietary salt ingested was performed in each group (Table
4). The PRA analyses demonstrated a significant correla-
tion between SR normotensives (correlation coefficient =
0.73173, p < 0.0001) and SR hypertensives (correlation
coefficient = 0.59705, p = 0.0312). Aldosterone was also
correlated significantly with the change in dietary salt
intake in SR normotensives, (correlation coefficient =
0.71268, p < 0.0001). However, no significant correlations
were shown in SS normotensive and hypertensive
participants.
Discussion
Among various studies investigating the effect of dietary
salt on BP, almost all were conducted to determine SS
prevalence or to reveal the different BP responses in hyper-
tensive and normotensive individuals based on dietary salt
intake. Despite great interest in SS, the underlying mecha-
nisms of this condition have not been completely identi-
fied.13 Although the RAAS regulates BP and controls
sodium balance, the critical role of PRA and aldosterone in
SS or SR hypertensive and normotensive subjects has been
very rarely revealed. We revealed the role of PRA and
aldosterone systematically in various states of participants
as a whole; SS with normotension or hypertension, and SR
with normotension or hypertension.
According to the results of our study, SR subjects
showed a significant decrease in PRA and aldosterone
regardless of hypertension but based on salt intake. In con-
trast, the response of PRA and aldosterone was not signifi-
cant in SS normotensives. However, only renin, not
aldosterone, decreased markedly in SS hypertensives after
consuming the HSD compared with the LSD. Besides that,
ARR was not affected significantly by the amount of die-
tary sodium between SS and SR group whether they had
hypertension or not. Although ARR has been used to eval-
uate hypertension and primary aldosteronism,14 the value
of ARR is somewhat controversial and is not thoroughly
evaluated in SS with hypertension or normotension.15
Similar results have been reported in other studies. Gerdts
et al. designed a study in which salt was restricted for 6
days with a single dose of 80 mg furosemide perorally, and
then salt was repleted with 9 g of sodium chloride per day
for 6 days.16 At baseline, the mean casual BP of the 30
enrolled Caucasian males was 156/102 mmHg, and the 24
h ABPM was 149/86 mmHg. Significant changes in PRA
and aldosterone were observed between SS and SR hyper-
tensive subjects at different levels of sodium intake. Egan
et al. studied cardiovascular, neurohumoral, and metabolic
effects of 7-day periods of 20 vs. 200 mEq/day salt diet in
27 men with normotension or stage 1 hypertension.17 PRA
decreased markedly after eating the HSD compared with
the LSD in both SS and SR participants. However, the
effect of hypertension was not analyzed. The PRA and
aldosterone response has not always been consistent in
other studies. Fujita et al. studied 18 patients with idio-
pathic hypertension with a range of BPs from 150 to 180
mmHg systolic and from 90 to 115 mmHg diastolic.4 The
results showed that SS hypertensives and SR subjects had
a significant decrease in both PRA and aldosterone during
sodium loading (244 mEq/day). Comparing the absolute
level of PRA and aldosterone during sodium intervention,
Sullivan and Ratts reported that during SR, PRA and
aldosterone are significantly lower in SS than that in SR
groups.3 This inconstancy could be explained by differ-
ences in the definition of SS, the amounts of dietary salt,
intervention periods, and ethnicity or baseline characteris-
tics of participants, particularly whether they had hyper-
tension or not.
The clinical meanings of these specific responses to
renin and aldosterone have been reported. He et al. dem-
onstrated that from an HSD of 350 mmol/d for 5 days to
an LSD of 10 to 20 mmol/d for 5 days, patients with
hypertension have a greater fall in BP with a smaller
increase in PRA and aldosterone.18 They suggested that
the greater fall in BP in patients with hypertension under
a SR was due to decreased responsiveness of the RAAS
in hypertensives. Krekels et al. reported that the degree of
BP change was not determined by sodium status, but
rather renin after 1 week of sodium restriction (55 mmol/

day) in untreated essential hypertensives with SS.19 This
could be explained by the importance of a relative unre-
sponsiveness of the renin system during the early phase
of sodium loss.20 An interesting finding in our results was
that aldosterone changed significantly only in SR sub-
jects, but not in SS participants, irrespective of hyperten-
sion. Aldosterone plays multiple roles in salt and water
homeostasis, left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with
arterial hypertension, disturbances in the vascular matrix,
and endothelial dysfunction.21 Aldosterone also contrib-
utes not only to the development of SS hypertension, but
also in cardio-renal injury caused by metabolic syn-
drome.22 Considering the high mortality of SS in normal
and hypertensive humans,23 the unresponsiveness of
aldosterone to the LSD vs. the HSD might be a reason for
the unfavorable and detrimental prognosis, particularly
in SS subjects. Moreover, this complex phenomenon of
renin and aldosterone in SS or SR will go far toward
identifying subjects who will be more susceptible to
RAAS-blocking agents.24
There are several limitations of this study. First, the
PRA and aldosterone data were limited. Hormonal
changes were only checked on the last day of each diet
period and were not measured at the beginning of diet
intervention as a baseline. Second, the study period was 2
weeks, consisting of a 1-week LSD period and a 1-week
HSD period. Thus the PRA and aldosterone changes in
this study cannot predict long-term responses. Third, the
results cannot be extrapolated to subjects with severe
hypertension and other medical problems such as diabe-
tes mellitus,25 because this study enrolled only partici-
pants with normotension and stage 1 hypertension
without other health problems. Fourth, the small sample
size should borne in mind and the results interpreted
appropriately. This was, however, unavoidable to some
degree considering the limitation of research funding and
a difficult study design in which all participants were
admitted to the hospital and permitted to eat only the spe-
cial study food for 2 weeks.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated the important role
and different responses of renin and aldosterone in SS and
SR subjects based on dietary salt intake. RAAS can be
inhibited or blocked by several pharmaceutical agents, so
if the exact role of renin and aldosterone could be identi-
fied in SS or SR subjects, whether normotensive or hyper-
tensive, more individualized therapy could be applied for
those who would receive more benefits by specific thera-
peutic approaches including a low-salt DASH diet.
