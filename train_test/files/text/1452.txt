ABSTRACT
The new US National Osteoporosis Foundation's (NOF's) Clinician's Guide to Prevention and Treatment of Osteoporosis includes criteria for
recommending pharmacologic treatment based on history of hip or vertebral fracture, femoral neck or spine bone mineral density (BMD)
T-scores of À2.5 or less, and presence of low bone mass at the femoral neck or spine plus a 10-year risk of hip fracture of 3% or greater or
of major osteoporotic fracture of 20% or greater. The proportion of men who would be recommended for treatment by these guidelines
is not known. We applied the NOF criteria for treatment to men participating in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS). To
determine how the MrOS population differs from the general US population of Caucasian men aged 65 years and older, we compared
men in MrOS with men who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III on criteria included in the
NOF treatment guidelines that were common to both cohorts. Compared with NHANES III, men in MrOS had higher femoral neck BMD
values. Application of NOF guidelines to MrOS data estimated that at least 34% of US white men aged 65 years and older and 49% of
those aged 75 years and older would be recommended for drug treatment. Application of the new NOF guidelines would result in
recommending a very large proportion of white men in the United States for pharmacologic treatment of osteoporosis, for many of
whom the efficacy of treatment is unknown. ß 2010 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Introduction
The US National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) recently
released new guidelines, Clinician's Guide to Prevention
and Treatment of Osteoporosis, that include comprehensive
information about how to prevent fractures and mitigate their
consequences.(1) The guidelines include recommendations
about pharmacologic treatment to prevent fractures
(Table 1). They recommend treatment based on history
of hip or vertebral fracture, hip and spine bone mineral
density (BMD) T-scores, and--among those with low
bone mass--an elevated 10-year risk of fracture estimated
from the World Health Organization (WHO) risk index
(FRAX).(2)

Two approaches to treatment may be considered: one based
on BMD alone and the other based on absolute risk of fracture.
Although BMD is a strong predictor of hip and nonvertebral
fractures in men,(3) over three-quarters of all fractures occur in
men without WHO BMD-defined osteoporosis.(4) Thus treatment
that is initiated based on BMD alone will not treat a large pro-
portion of men who eventually go on to fracture. In general,
compared with treatment based on BMD alone, the emphasis on
treating based on absolute risk of fracture will decrease the
proportion of 50- to 60-year-old men who are treated with drugs
because they have a low risk of fractures. On the other hand,
this approach may result in treating a large proportion of older
people, particularly older white men who have a higher absolute
risk of fracture. The proportions of various age groups that would
be treated under the new NOF guidelines are not known. We
previously estimated the proportion of older white women who
participated in the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures that would be
treated under the new NOF guidelines,(5) and we aim to extend
these findings to men. Therefore, we used data from the Osteo-
porotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS) and applied the new
NOF treatment guidelines to estimate the proportion of white
men aged 65 years and older who would be recommended for
pharmacologic treatment. MrOS is a community-based sample of
men from six communities. To confirm how well MrOS represents
the US white male population aged 65 years and older, we
compared the MrOS population with white males aged 65 years
and older who participated in the third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) on treatment criteria
listed in the NOF guidelines (including FRAX) common to both
cohorts. This was done to gauge the similarities of the two
cohorts on treatment criteria and to assess the generalizability of
the proportion that would be recommended for treatment in the
US white male population compared with MrOS. Since NHANES
III was missing several components required to calculate FRAX, it
was not possible to directly compare the proportion recom-
mended for treatment between the NHANES III cohort and the
MrOS cohort.
Methods
We used data from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study
(MrOS), a prospective study of community-dwelling men aged
65 years and older recruited from six communities in the United
States: Birmingham, Alabama, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Palo Alto,
California, Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, Portland, Oregon, and San
Diego, California.(6,7) Participants were recruited from popula-
tion-based listings and mass mailings between 2000 and 2002.
Men were not recruited on the basis of any risk factors for
osteoporosis. All participants provided informed consent. This
study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at each of
the participating sites.
Demographic, anthropometric, lifestyle, and medical
history
Baseline examinations took place from 2000 to 2002 (n ¼ 5995).
Men provided information regarding fracture history, smoking
status, alcohol consumption, parental hip fracture history, rheu-
matoid arthritis, and corticosteroid use. All prescription medica-
tions recorded by the clinics were stored in an electronic
medications inventory database (San Francisco Coordinating
Center, San Francisco, CA, USA). Each medication was matched to
its ingredient(s) based on the Iowa Drug Information Service
(IDIS) Drug Vocabulary (College of Pharmacy, University of Iowa,
Iowa City, IA, USA).
Height was measured with a wall-mounted Harpenden
stadiometer (Holtain, Ltd., DyFed, United Kingdom). Weight
was measured with a balance-beam scale, except for one of the
clinical centers that used a digital scale (Portland). Body mass
index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared.
Bone mineral density
Bone mineral density (BMD) was obtained at the proximal femur
and lumbar spine by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)
using QDR 4500 densitometers (Hologic, Inc., Bedford, MA, USA). T-
scores for the femoral neck (FN) and total hip were calculated
based on the means and standard deviations for men obtained
from the NHANES III.(8) T-scores for the spine were calculated using
the reference value provided by the manufacturer.
WHO 10-year absolute fracture risk
The WHO 10-year absolute risk of both hip fracture and major
osteoporotic fracture (ie, hip, clinical spine, forearm, or shoulder)
was calculated by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Metabolic
Bone Disease in February 2009. Calculation of absolute risk was
done following the FRAX algorithm.(2,9) FRAX is described in
detail elsewhere. Briefly, the calculation of the 10-year pro-
babilities is based on nine risk factors (ie, age, sex, BMI, previous
history of fracture, parental history of hip fracture, current
smoking, use of corticosteroids in past 3 months, presence of
rheumatoid arthritis, and three or more alcoholic beverages
per day). The 10-year probabilities for both hip and major
Table 1. Criteria for Recommending Pharmacologic Treatment from the US NOF Guidelines
In women and men aged 50 years and older, pharmacologic therapy should be recommended for those with any one of the following:
 A history of hip fracture or clinical or radiographic spine fracture
 T-score of À2.5 or less at femoral neck or spinea
 Low bone mass (osteopenia), T-scores of À1.0 to À2.5 at the femoral neck or lumbar spine and any of the following:
 !3% 10-year probability of hip fracture or
 !20% 10-year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture based on the WHO model for the United States
aAfter excluding secondary causes.

osteoporotic fracture can be calculated with or without FN BMD.
The NOF treatment guidelines use the 10-year absolute risks (of
hip and major osteoporotic fractures) calculated using FN BMD.
NHANES III
NHANES is a program of studies designed to assess the health
and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States.
The survey uses a stratified complex sampling strategy to identify
and examine a nationally representative sample of approxi-
mately 5000 persons each year. We used data from white men
aged 65 years and older who participated in NHANES III. A direct
estimation of the proportion of white men aged 65 years and
older who would be recommended for treatment under the
NOF guidelines cannot be performed using NHANES III because
lumbar spine BMD, paternal history of fracture, and personal
history of fracture at skeletal sites other than the hip, spine,
and wrist were not assessed in NHANES III. For those factors in
FRAX and/or the NOF guidelines that were measured in both
MrOS and NHANES III, we reported the mean values for conti-
nuous variables (ie, age, BMI, and BMD) and proportions for
dichotomous variables (ie, personal history of fracture, maternal
history of fracture, rheumatoid arthritis, current smoking, and
consumption of three or more alcoholic drinks per day). NHANES
III data were obtained from the publicly available data release
(www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm). Means and proportions were
adjusted for the NHANES III sampling strategy, as recommended
in the NHANES analysis guidelines, using the SURVEYMEANS
and SURVEYFREQ procedures in SAS (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC,
USA).
Analysis
Men in MrOS were excluded from the analysis if they were
nonwhite. Although MrOS and NHANES III enrolled nonwhite
men and FRAX probabilities can be calculated for several
different ethnicities, the analysis was limited to white men
because there were too few nonwhite men in the MrOS cohort to
provide an accurate ethnicity-stratified analysis. Men also were
excluded if they had missing data for any of the factors required
to apply the NOF guidelines, including those required to cal-
culate FRAX. We applied the NOF guidelines as given in Table 1 to
determine the proportion of men who would be recommended
for treatment.
Radiographic vertebral fracture status was not available in
MrOS. However, this information is not collected routinely in the
usual care setting, and therefore, in order to conservatively apply
the guidelines, we did not include information about radio-
graphic vertebral fractures in determining whether a man should
be treated.
In the primary analysis, the criterion ``past history of hip fracture
or clinical or radiographic vertebral fracture'' was conservatively
limited to past history of hip fracture. We also estimated the
proportion of men who would be recommended for treatment if a
history of clinical vertebral fractures was included. In other
secondary analyses, we applied the criterion ``T-score of À2.5 or
less at femoral neck or spine'' and ``osteopenia and 10-year risk of
hip fracture of 3% ot greater or osteopenia and major osteoporotic
fracture risk of 20% or greater'' alone. Finally, to determine if the
proportion of men who would be recommended for treatment
differed by age, we analyzed men 65 years of age and older and 75
years of age and older.
Results
A total of 5995 men participated in the baseline examination. Of
these, 5362 self-identified as white. There were 3913 men who
had complete data for the nine clinical risk factors in FRAX and
femoral neck BMD. The two most common reasons for missing
data were parental history of hip fracture and glucocorticoid use
(n ¼ 1438). An additional 11 men were missing one or more of
the other FRAX variables. Finally, 26 men were missing spine
BMD (an element of the NOF guidelines). Thus 3887 men were
included in the analysis. Men who were missing at least one FRAX
or NOF criteria had similar age, BMI, and femoral neck BMD to
those included in the analysis.
Men in MrOS were slightly older (73.6 versus 72.2 years) and
had slightly higher BMD values at the femoral neck than men
65 years of age and older who participated in NHANES III.
Therefore, men in MrOS had a lower prevalence of T-scores
below À2.5 and a higher number with T-scores above À1.0.
Similar proportions of men in MrOS and NHANES reported a
previous hip fracture compared with the men in NHANES (1.3%).
A smaller proportion of men in MrOS reported consuming of
three or more alcoholic beverages per day, and current smoking
compared with that in NHANES (Table 2). The prevalence of
bisphosphonate use among men in MrOS was 1.8%.
Overall, applying the modified NOF guidelines to men aged
65 years and older in MrOS, 33.4% would be recommended for
treatment (Table 3). When history of clinical vertebral fracture is
included, 34.0% of men would be recommended for treatment.
When the guidelines are applied to men aged 75 years and older,
49.1% would be recommended for treatment.
Applying only the NOF guideline criterion of ``T-score of À2.5 or
less at the femoral neck or spine,'' 7.0% of men would be
recommended for drug treatment (Table 3). However, if T-score of
À2.5 or less is limited to only the femoral neck, 5.0% would be
recommended for treatment (Table 3). Applying only theNOF
guideline criterion ``low bone mass and 10-year risk of hip fracture of
3% or greater or major osteoporotic fracture risk of 20% or greater,''
29.2% of men would be recommended for drug treatment.
Discussion
We estimate that application of the new NOF guidelines
would result in recommending that pharmacologic treatment to
prevent fractures should be initiated for about one-third of the
participants in the MrOS study and approximately half the men
over age 75. These figures may underestimate the proportions
that would be recommended for treatment in the US population
because the men in MrOS had somewhat higher BMD values
than the men in the US population-based NHANES III survey.
Furthermore, we did not include some criteria for treatment,
such as a history or presence of a radiographic vertebral fracture,
inclusion of which would further increase the number recom-
mended for treatment.

Our estimates are consistent with results from the Canadian
Multicenter Osteoporosis Study (CaMOS). In our study, we found
that approximately 8% of men would be eligible for treatment
using only the 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture
of 20% or greater criterion. A similar analysis in the CaMOS cohort
found that over 10% of white men aged 65 years or older would
have a 10-year probability of fracture of 20% or greater based on
BMD and the risk factors used in the WHO model.(10) Although
the NOF cost-effectiveness analysis did not report the proportion
of men who would be treated under the NOF guidelines, they do
conclude that pharmacologic treatment would be cost-effective
for the average 73-year-old white man.(11) Thus, given that the
median age of men who participated in MrOS was 73 years, it is
consistent that we estimated that a high proportion (34%) of
men would be recommended for drug treatment.
Our analysis suggests that approximately one-third of the
older white men recommended for pharmacologic treatment
under the new guidelines would be included because they have
low bone mass (osteopenia) at one of the two skeletal sites and a
10-year estimated probability of hip fracture of 3% or greater or a
10-year estimated probability of major osteoporotic fracture of
20% or greater. The FRAX probability of hip fracture risk (!3%)
was the criterion that would lead to the greatest number of men
being treated (29% of total group). When so many people and
such a large proportion of older men are recommended for drug
treatment, it is important that the assumptions underlying the

recommendations be based on robust data. In particular, it is
important that there be strong evidence of substantial benefit
from treatment among those with low bone mass and additional
risk factors. To date, there have been no randomized, controlled
trials testing the efficacy of antifracture drug treatment in this
population.
We found that about 5% of men in MrOS had osteoporosis,
defined as a femoral neck BMD T-score of À2.5 or less. A recent
systematic review indicated that there were limited data to indicate
that treatment was effective in reducing fractures in men.(12)
Specifically, there have been two trials testing the efficacy of
alendronate,(13,14) two of risedronate,(15,16) and two of parathyroid
hormone(17,18) in men with osteoporosis. All studies demonstrated a
significant increase in lumbar spine BMD, the primary endpoint, and
three studies demonstrated a significant reduction in incident
vertebral fractures(13­15) on active drug compared with placebo.
However, the efficacy of these drugs to prevent both vertebral and,
in particular, nonvertebral fractures remains unclear.
Our estimates have several limitations. First, MrOS is a cohort
of community-dwelling volunteers and not a population-based
sample. However, characteristics of the MrOS participants are
similar to, or healthier than, those of the population-based
NHANES III, and therefore may underestimate the proportion
of men who would be recommended for treatment. Secondly,
FRAX may underestimate the 10-year probability of major
osteoporotic fracture among those who have a radiographic
vertebral fracture. We conservatively excluded radiographic
vertebral fractures when the FRAX 10-year probabilities were
calculated by the WHO (i.e., radiographic vertebral fractures
were not included as a ``history of previous fracture'' in the
FRAX calculations). Finally, as this analysis from MrOS includes
only white men age 65 or older this study is not able to estimate
the proportion of younger men or men of other racial groups
who would be recommended for pharmacologic treatment.
Presumably, the proportion of people in these groups recom-
mended for treated will be substantially less than the estimates
from MrOS because they have a lower risk of fracture and lower
prevalence of osteoporosis.
We conclude that the new NOF guidelines for pharmacologic
treatment for osteoporosis would recommend drug therapy to at
least one-third of white men aged 65 years and older and 50% of
those older than 75 years of age. When such a large proportion of
older men is recommended to receive drug treatment for
osteoporosis, it is important that the assumptions that underlie
that analysis be based on robust evidence. This would require a
trial of bisphosphonate therapy and/or other pharmaceutical
agents in women and men with just ``low bone mass.''
