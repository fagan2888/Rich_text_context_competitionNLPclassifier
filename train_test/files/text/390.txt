BISPHENOL A (BPA) IS ONE OF
the world's highest produc-
tion­volume chemicals, with
more than 2 million metric
tons produced worldwide in 2003 and
annual increase in demand of 6% to
10% annually.1 Bisphenol A is used ex-
tensively in epoxy resins lining food and
beverage containers and as a mono-
mer in polycarbonate plastics in many
consumer products. Widespread and
continuous exposure to BPA, primar-
ily through food but also through drink-
ing water, dental sealants, dermal ex-
posure, and inhalation of household
dusts, is evident from the presence of
detectable levels of BPA in more than
90% of the US population.2-4
Most studies of the health effects of
BPA have focused on well-documented
estrogenic activity,5 but reports have
highlighted additional modes of ac-
tion,6 including liver damage,7-11 dis-
rupted pancreatic -cell function,12
thyroid hormone disruption,13 and obe-
sity-promotingeffects.14 Thepotentialfor
low-dose effects15 has added to the con-
troversy about possible hazards and
whether currently recommended expo-
sure thresholds require revision.16-19

Context Bisphenol A (BPA) is widely used in epoxy resins lining food and beverage
containers. Evidence of effects in animals has generated concern over low-level chronic
exposures in humans.
Objective To examine associations between urinary BPA concentrations and adult
health status.
Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional analysis of BPA concentra-
tions and health status in the general adult population of the United States, using data
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2004. Participants
were 1455 adults aged 18 through 74 years with measured urinary BPA and urine
creatinine concentrations. Regression models were adjusted for age, sex, race/
ethnicity, education, income, smoking, body mass index, waist circumference, and uri-
nary creatinine concentration. The sample provided 80% power to detect unadjusted
odds ratios (ORs) of 1.4 for diagnoses of 5% prevalence per 1-SD change in BPA con-
centration, or standardized regression coefficients of 0.075 for liver enzyme concen-
trations, at a significance level of P.05.
Main Outcome Measures Chronic disease diagnoses plus blood markers of liver
function, glucose homeostasis, inflammation, and lipid changes.
Results Higher urinary BPA concentrations were associated with cardiovascular diag-
noses in age-, sex-, and fully adjusted models (OR per 1-SD increase in BPA concentra-
tion, 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-1.63; P=.001 with full adjustment). Higher
BPA concentrations were also associated with diabetes (OR per 1-SD increase in BPA con-
centration, 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-1.60; P.001) but not with other
studied common diseases. In addition, higher BPA concentrations were associated with
clinically abnormal concentrations of the liver enzymes -glutamyltransferase (OR per
1-SD increase in BPA concentration, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.14-1.46; P.001) and alkaline phos-
phatase (OR per 1-SD increase in BPA concentration, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.18-1.85; P=.002).
Conclusion HigherBPAexposure,reflectedinhigherurinaryconcentrationsofBPA,may
be associated with avoidable morbidity in the community-dwelling adult population.

2004 recently released the only large-
scale data on urinary BPA concentra-
tions.20 BecauseorallyadministeredBPA
israpidlyandcompletelyexcreted,urine
isconsideredthebodyfluidmostappro-
priateforassessmentofBPAexposure.21
The highly water-soluble major BPA
metabolite, BPA-monoglucuronide, is
formed in the gut wall and liver and is
rapidly removed from the blood by the
kidneys, withterminal half-lives of less
than6hoursafteroraladministration.21
Given the previous animal evidence,
wehypothesizedthathigherurinaryBPA
concentrationswouldbeassociatedwith
adverse health effects, especially in the
liverandinrelationtoinsulin,type2dia-
betes, and obesity in humans. Because of
the paucity of direct human evidence,
however, we undertook analyses of all
8ofthereportedmajordiagnosticgroup-
ings available in the NHANES 2003-
2004 data (including cardiovascular and
respiratory conditions for which 3 ques-
tions each are available on subdiagno-
ses). We also examined a preselected list
of 8 blood-based clinical measures re-
flecting liver function, glucose homeo-
stasis, inflammation, and lipid changes.
METHODS
Data were from NHANES 2003-2004.22
NHANES surveys assess the health and
dietofthenoninstitutionalizedUSpopu-
lation and are administered by the
National Center for Health Statistics.
NHANES was approved by the Na-
tional Centers for Health Statistics insti-
tutional review board, and all partici-
pants provide written informed consent.
Assessment of BPA Concentrations
NHANESincludesbiomonitoringforex-
posure to a range of environmental tox-
ins.23 A one-third random subset of
NHANES 2003-2004 participants sup-
plied urine samples that were then ana-
lyzed for BPA concentration. A spot
urine sample was collected from each
participant. Total (free and conju-
gated) urinary concentrations of BPA
were measured at the Division of Envi-
ronmental Health Laboratory Sciences
(National Center for Environmental
Health, Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention) using online solid-phase
extraction coupled with high-perfor-
mance liquid chromatography­ isotope-
dilutiontandemmassspectrometrywith
peak focusing. A comprehensive qual-
ity control system, including reagent
blanks, was used to ensure that samples
were not contaminated during han-
dling, storage, and analysis.24 For
BPA concentrations below the level of
detection (116/1455 [8%]), a value of
0.3ng/mLwasassignedbyNHANES;we
used this value in our analyses.
Health Outcomes
Participantsaged20yearsandolderwere
asked"Hasadoctororotherhealthpro-
fessionalevertoldyouthatyouhave . . . ."
for angina, arthritis, asthma, cancer,
chronic bronchitis, coronary heart dis-
ease,emphysema,heartattack,liverdis-
ease (any kind), stroke, or thyroid dis-
ease.Participants18yearsandolderwere

combinedwithchronicbronchitis.Simi-
larly, we combined diagnosed and bor-
derlinediabetesandgroupedthecardio-
vascular conditions (reported angina,
coronaryheartdisease,andheartattack).
We included all available common con-
ditions (ie, those with 40 cases) in the
analyses, covering 8 major disease cat-
egories after grouping.
We analyzed concentrations of the
following 8 blood serum analytes: C-
reactive protein, quantified usinglatex-
enhanced nephelometry; -glutamyl-
transferase (GGT), using an enzymatic
ratemethod;lactatedehydrogenase,using
anenzymaticratemethod;alkalinephos-
phatase, using a 2-amino-2-methyl-1-
propanolbuffer;triglycerides,measured

surement of reduced nicotinamide ad-
enine dinucleotide concentration; and
fasting insulin, using a 2-site immuno-
enzymometric assay. Details of analyte

using the HOMA2 model.
Statistical Analysis
NHANES 2003-2004 used a complex
clustersampledesign,withsomedemo-
graphic groups (including Mexican
Americans and groups in low socioeco-
nomicpositions)oversampledtoensure
adequaterepresentation.Toaccountfor
this complex sampling, weighted esti-
mates of population parameters were
computed,followingtheNHANESAna-
lyticandReportingGuidelines(Septem-
ber 2006). For most analyses, popula-
tion weights for the BPA measurement
sample (subsample C of the medical
examination)wereused.Samplingerrors
wereestimatedbytheTaylorseries(lin-
earization)methodtoaccountforstrati-
fication and clustering using the pro-
vided"maskedvariancepseudo-psu"and
"pseudo-stratum" variables. This pro-
cedure produced the same geometric
mean and variance estimates as those
published by the National Center for
Environmental Health3 (ie, geometric
meanBPAconcentrationsforagegroup
20 to 59 years, 2.6 µg/L; 95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 2.3 to 2.9). Data on
levels of LDL-C, glucose, and insulin
were available in a random subsample
assignedtofast(n=653);fortheseanaly-
ses, a specific fasting specimen weight
wasusedasdirected.Analyseswerecon-
ducted by 3 authors (I.A.L., W.E.H.,
D.M.) using Stata SE version 9.2 (Stata-
Corp, College Station, Texas); P.05
was considered statistically significant.
Using the sample weights in a classi-
cal design-based analysis of survey data
provides asymptotically unbiased esti-
mates of population parameters but can
lead to inefficiency (ie, inflation of stan-
dard errors).26 An overall inefficiency

To assess the sensitivity of our findings
to the weighting method, we repeated
all analyses using a partial weighting
approach in which the unweighted
regression model was augmented with
exogenous design variables.26 There
were no substantive changes in the
model inferences (see eSupplement at
http://www.jama.com).
Becausethediseasesofinterestarerare
in children, we restricted our analyses to
respondentsaged18through74years(of
those randomly selected by NHANES
2003-2004formeasurementofBPAcon-
centration) to focus on health effects in
adults. The upper age cutoff was cho-
sen to minimize problems of comorbid-
ity and nonrepresentation of seniors in
institutions. We excluded 1 respondent
because of a missing urinary creatinine
concentration, resulting in an included
sample of 1455 respondents.
We used logistic regression to esti-
mate odds ratios (ORs) of physician-
diagnosed diseases (as the dependent
variable) per 1-SD increase in BPA con-
centrations and used linear regression
to estimate associations between logged
levels of blood analytes and standard-
ized BPA concentrations.
Regression models were adjusted for
a broad range of potential confounders,
including socioeconomic factors that
Calafat et al3 have shown to be associ-
ated with BPA and urinary creatinine
concentrations.27 Variablesincludedwere
race/ethnicity(fromself-descriptionand
categorized into Mexican American,
other Hispanic, non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic black, and other race [in-
cluding multiracial]); education (cat-
egorized as high school, high school
diploma [including General Educa-
tionalDevelopment],andhighschool);
annualhouseholdincome(in3approxi-
matelyequal-sizedcategories[$25000,
$25 000-$55 000, and $55 000], plus
a fourth category for missing values
[n=92]); smoking (from self-reported
status and categorized as never smoked,
formersmoker,smokingsomedays,and
smoking every day, plus unknown, be-
cause the questions were asked of those
aged20years[n=177]);bodymassin-
dex (BMI) (calculated as weight in kilo-
grams divided by height in meters
squared and categorized as under-
weight [18.5], recommended weight
[18.5-24.9], overweight [25.0-29.9],
obese I [30.0-34.9], or obese II [35.0],
withafinalcategoryforparticipantswith
missing values [n=25]); waist circum-
ference (in quintiles, with n=60 in a
group with missing values); and uri-
nary creatinine concentration in mg/dL.
We carried out 5 sets of sensitivity
analyses,whichwereidentifiedposthoc
to test the robustness of our findings.
First, to assess whether increased levels
of liver enzymes reflect normal induc-
tion of enzymes or a clinically relevant
abnormality, we used NHANES refer-
ence ranges, established from wellness
participants with an age mix similar to
that of NHANES participants. Ranges
were 36 to 113 U/L for alkaline phos-
phatase, 93 to 198 U/L for lactate dehy-
drogenase, and 10 to 65 U/L for GGT in
men and 8 to 36 U/L in women (to con-
vert values for all 3 analytes to µkat/L,
multiply by 0.0167).28 Second, to inves-
tigate whether the presence of the dis-
eases found to be associated with BPA
concentrations might have been associ-
ated with altered BPA exposure (per-
haps through greater consumption of
sugar-free foods or drinks from plastic
containersbyindividualstryingtoman-
age their obesity or diabetes), we exam-
ined associations of BPA with increased
levelsofliverenzymesinrespondentsin
2subgroups:thosereportingneithercar-
diovascular disease nor diabetes, and
those with BMI less than 25. Third,
because alcohol intake might confound
associations of BPA concentration with
increasedlevelsofliverenzymes,wecon-
ductedouranalysesagainincludingdata
onself-reporteddailyalcoholconsump-
tion.Fourth,wetestedwhethertheasso-
ciationbetweenBPAconcentrationsand
cardiovascular disease was robust to
adjustment for the effects of lipid levels
(LDL-C and triglycerides). Fifth, to
explore the possibility that our findings
were due to higher exposure to a wider
setofxenoestrogeniccompoundsandnot
specific to BPA concentrations, we
repeated our models including other
known xenoestrogenic compounds.
We also have explored a range of al-
ternative approaches to accounting for
the sampling design, the skewed dis-
tributionofBPAconcentrations,andthe
correction of urinary creatinine con-
centrations (see eSupplement at http:
//www.jama.com).
Power Calculations
Power calculations for presence of di-
agnoses were conducted using the ap-
proach proposed by Hsieh et al29 for
simple logistic regression models. For
continuous outcomes, the power cal-
culations were performed using the PS
power and sample size program.30,31 The
sample provided 80% power to detect
unadjusted ORs of 1.4 for diagnoses of
5% prevalence per 1-SD change in BPA
concentration (or, for 10% preva-
lence, unadjusted ORs of 1.3). For liver
enzymes and insulin, the detectable
effect sizes for 80% power are given by
standardized regression coefficients of
0.075 and 0.11, respectively.
RESULTS
Thestudysampleincluded694menand
761women(TABLE 1).Weightedbutun-
adjusted mean urinary BPA concentra-
tions were similar by sex, but for some
variables ranges were wider. For ex-
ample, mean BPA concentrations in par-
ticipants at recommended weight (BMI
18.5-24.9) were 3.91 ng/mL (95% CI,
3.34to4.48),comparedwith6.93ng/mL
(95% CI, 4.39 to 9.47) in those in the
obese II category (BMI 35).
Weighted mean BPA concentrations
adjusted for age and sex (FIGURE) ap-
peared higher in those who reported di-
agnoses of cardiovascular diseases (in-
cluding coronary heart disease, heart
attack, and angina) and diabetes. To ex-
plore this further, we estimated the ORs
of reporting a diagnosis of these con-
ditions by z scores of BPA concentra-
tion, using adjusted logistic regres-
sion models including age, sex, and
urinary creatinine concentrations and
fully adjusted models including these
covariates plus race/ethnicity, educa-
tion, income, smoking, BMI, and waist
circumference (TABLE 2). Overall, pat-
terns of linear association in all mod-

els were similar to those in the Figure.
A 1-SD increase in BPA concentration
was associated with increased ORs of
reporting cardiovascular disease (an-
gina, coronary heart disease, or heart
attack combined) (OR, 1.39; 95% CI,
1.18 to 1.63; P=.001 with full adjust-
ment) and diabetes (OR, 1.39; 95% CI,
1.21 to 1.60; P.001). Associations
with the individual cardiovascular di-
agnoses were all significant. No asso-
ciations with the other diagnoses were
observed.
When using an alternative exposure
metric of dividing BPA concentrations
into quartiles in the fully adjusted mod-
els, participants in the highest BPA con-
centration quartile had an OR of 2.89
(95% CI, 1.07 to 7.78; P=.04) for car-
diovasculardiseasecomparedwiththose
in the lowest quartile. Similarly, those in
the highest BPA concentration quartile
had an OR of 2.43 (95% CI, 1.35 to 4.38;
P=.006) for diabetes compared with
those in the lowest quartile.
TABLE 3 presents results of adjusted
regression models of logged levels of
blood analytes by z scores of BPA con-
centration. In fully adjusted models,
associations were observed between
BPA concentrations and logged levels
of alkaline phosphatase (P=.01), lac-
tate dehydrogenase (P=.04), and GGT
(P=.001). Initial associations (ad-
justed for age, sex, and urinary creati-
nine level) with levels of C-reactive pro-
tein disappeared on further adjustment.
Levels of fasting glucose and insulin
were associated with BPA concentra-
tion in models adjusted for age, sex, and
urinarycreatinineconcentrationbutnot
in models with full adjustment. No as-
sociations with levels of LDL-C or tri-
glycerides were observed.
Sensitivity Analyses
We first reran our models to assess the
ORs for having clinically above-normal
concentrations of each of the liver en-
zymes.Inadjustedmodels,wefoundthat
a1-SDincreaseinBPAconcentrationwas
associated with clinically above-normal
concentrations of GGT (n=129 above
normal; weighted 8.8% prevalence; OR,
1.29; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.46; P.001), al-
kaline phosphatase (n=58 above nor-
mal;weighted2.6%prevalence;OR,1.48;
95% CI, 1.18 to 1.85; P=.002), and lac-
tate dehydrogenase (n=20 above nor-
mal; 1% prevalence; OR, 1.40; 95% CI,
0.96 to 1.72; P=.08).
In participants reporting neither car-
diovasculardiseasenordiabetes(exclud-
ing n=190), BPA concentration re-
mained associated with clinically
abnormal concentrations of lactate de-
hydrogenase (OR per 1-SD increase in
BPA concentration, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.06
to 1.62; P=.01) and GGT (OR per 1-SD
increaseinBPAconcentration,1.22;95%
CI, 1.02 to 1.45; P=.03). In those with
BMI less than 25 (n=501), BPA concen-
tration was associated with increased
concentrationsofGGT(=0.09;95%CI,
0.01 to 0.18; P=.03).

number of participants (n=1029) be-
cause of item nonresponse and because
those younger than 20 years were not

diabetes(OR,1.38;95%CI,1.20to1.58;

although the trend was similar (n=546;

tionsofthe3liverenzymes;eg,forGGT,
the  coefficient for 4-tert-octyl phenol
per1-SDchangewas0.00(95%CI,-0.03

BPA concentration remained associ-
ated with logged levels of GGT (=.06;
95% CI, 0.03 to 0.10; P=.002).
COMMENT
In this study we aimed to assess whether
increased urinary BPA concentrations
were associated with adverse health ef-
fects in the general US adult popula-
tion. This analysis made use of the first
large-scale and high-quality population-
representative data set to become avail-
able. After adjusting for potential con-
founders, we found that higher BPA
concentrations were associated with di-
agnoses of cardiovascular disease and
diabetes. We also found associations be-
tween higher BPA concentrations and
clinically abnormal concentrations of
the 3 liver enzymes examined, namely
GGT, alkaline phosphatase, and lac-
tate dehydrogenase. Importantly, we
observed no associations with the other
common conditions examined, sug-
gesting specificity of the associations.
A series of sensitivity analyses pro-
vided further support for the specific-
ity of the associations found.
Controversy has surrounded the risk
that BPA poses to humans, because esti-
mates extrapolated from animal stud-
ies32 have demonstrated significant
species-specific differences in both
metabolism and toxicity32 and also
because of the multiple potential routes
of human exposure. Ingestion of oral
doses of BPA in rats and humans leads
to first-pass metabolism in the intestine
and liver to yield the major metabolite,
BPA-monoglucuronide.33 Transdermal
exposureandinhalationofairbornedust
will largely avoid first-pass metabolism,

rization.Thistemporalvariabilityinuri-
naryBPAconcentrationsislikelytohave
resulted in underestimation of the true
strengths of association with the out-
comes in our analyses.
BPA has long been thought to act via
relatively loose binding to the estrogen
receptor,andthismodeofactionhasbeen
incorporated in pharmacokinetic mod-
els; however, recent evidence suggests
thatBPAalsobindsstronglytotheestro-
gen-related receptor , the function of
whichisunknown.6 Althoughthemajor
metaboliteBPA-monoglucuronidelacks
estrogenic activity, the generation of
estrogenicallyactivemetabolitesfollow-
ing oxidative cleavage of BPA has been
reported in vitro in rat liver microsomal
fractions,39 although the in vivo signifi-
cance of this pathway is not yet clear.
Bindhumoletal7 foundBPA-inducedoxi-
dative stress in rat hepatocytes with oral
intake over a 30-day period, and hepa-
tocyte damage has been reported in a
number of other experimental con-
texts.8-11 Lipid accumulation has been
shown in adipocyte and hepatoma cell
linesexposedtoBPA.40 Avarietyofother
effects of BPA have been noted, includ-
ing disrupted pancreatic -cell func-
tion, which produces insulin resistance
in mice exposed to oral BPA doses well
belowthelowestobservedadverseeffect
level currently considered by the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency.12 Four
daysoflow-doseBPAinjectionsalsopro-
duced insulin resistance in mice.41
Other studies have identified associa-
tions between environmental toxins,
body weight, and diabetes,42,43 and it has
beenproposedthatexposuretosomeen-
vironmentalpollutantsmayinitiateorex-
acerbatethedevelopmentofobesity14 and
associated health problems.44 We found
an apparently wide range of BPA con-
centrations across BMI categories, with
weightedbutunadjustedmeanBPAcon-
centrations of 3.91 ng/mL (95% CI, 3.34
to 4.48) in participants with BMI of 18.5
to24.9comparedwith6.93ng/mL(95%
CI 4.39 to 9.47) in those with BMI of 35
or more (Table 1). However, formal
testing of logged BPAconcentrations ad-
justed for age, sex, and urinary creati-
nine concentrations showed no signifi-
cant differences between the categories
(data available from the authors on re-
quest). Although a possible explana-
tion for our findings is that the in-
creased dietary intakes associated with
obesity also result in higher intakes of
BPA and consequent morbidity, the ob-
served disease and liver enzyme changes
werepresentafteradjustingforbothBMI
and waist circumference. Crucially, the
association with GGT was present after
excluding overweight and obese partici-
pants. An association of BPA concentra-
tion with GGT concentration also was
present in those without cardiovascular
disease or diabetes, suggesting that "re-
verse causation" (in which the pres-
ence of these diseases might have led to
greater exposure or to some form of al-
tered BPA excretion) is also unlikely.
Exposure to BPA also might be an in-
dicator of exposure to multiple xenobi-
otics, including other endocrine disrup-
tors--but, as presented, adjustment for
otherenvironmentalphenolsandknown
xenoestrogensincluding4-tert-octylphe-
nol and triclosan made no difference to
theobservedoutcomes,suggestingaspe-
cific effect mediated by BPA. We also
have explored a range of alternative ap-
proaches to accounting for the sam-
plingdesign,thedistributionofBPAcon-
centrations,andthecorrectionofurinary
creatinine concentrations (see eSupple-
ment at http://www.jama.com), all of
which point to our results being robust.
The main limitation of our analyses is
their cross-sectional nature: longitudi-
nal data demonstrating that high BPA
concentrationspredictlateronsetsofbio-
chemical change or diagnoses would
strengthen the evidence. A further limi-
tation is that we have examined a broad
hypothesis of associations between
higher BPA concentrations and adverse
effects on health status, including tests
of association with 8 major diagnostic
groupings (with 3 questions each about
cardiovascular and respiratory condi-
tions) and 8 blood-based assays. Our ap-
proach, justified by this being the first
large-scale study, may have resulted in
false-positive associations. Although
false-positive inverse associations be-
tween BPA concentrations and out-
comes were theoretically as likely, none
were found.
Independent replication is now
needed to confirm the associations re-
ported. Because our analyses are based
onurinaryconcentrationsofBPA,which
reflect recent exposure, studies based on
repeat measurements over weeks,
months,orevenyearswouldimprovethe
assessment of longer-term exposure.
Given the many routes of exposure to
BPA, direct measures of dermal contact
or of contact with contaminated foods,
beverages, and dusts would be very dif-
ficulttoundertake.Afurtherissueisthat
although the previous animal-model lit-
erature provides evidence of the mecha-
nisms underlying effects on liver cells
(and therefore liver enzymes) and insu-
lin signaling (and therefore diabetes, as
previously discussed), the mechanisms
underlying the effect on prevalence of
cardiovascular disease are not obvious.
If the associations reported here are con-
firmed in independent studies, more
work will be needed to identify the
mechanisms of action linking long-
term, low-dose BPA exposure to ad-
verse outcomes in humans. Given the
substantial negative effects on adult
health that may be associated with in-
creased BPA concentrations and also
given the potential for reducing human
exposure, our findings deserve scien-
tific follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS
UsingdatarepresentativeoftheadultUS
population, we found that higher uri-
nary concentrations of BPA were asso-
ciated with an increased prevalence of
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and
liver-enzymeabnormalities.Thesefind-
ings add to the evidence suggesting
adverse effects of low-dose BPA in ani-
mals. Independent replication and fol-
low-up studies are needed to confirm
these findings and to provide evidence
on whether the associations are causal.
