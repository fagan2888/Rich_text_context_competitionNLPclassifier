Abstract
Objectives: To the best of the authors' knowledge, gender differences in nonmedical opioid
presentations to the emergency department (ED) have not been studied. The objective was to explore
gender differences in ED visits related to nonmedical prescription opioid use in a nationally
representative sample.
Methods: Data from the 2011 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Services Administration's Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) were analyzed to
compare visit characteristics between women and men. Logistic regression models were developed to
examine the association between gender and specific drug presentations and clinical outcomes.
Results: There were an estimated 426,010 DAWN-defined visits involving prescription opioid use in 2011.
The prevalence of drugs in opioid-involved visits was similar between women and men. Ingestion of
another drug along with opioids was associated with increased odds of hospital admission for both
women and men, and types of opioids ingested were similar between women and men. However, gender
differences were noted in clinical outcomes, depending on the specific drug combination.
Conclusions: Gender differences exist in ED presentations related to prescription opioids. Further
research is needed to understand these differences and any implications for gender-specific emergency
care and brief interventions.

Over the past decade, there has been a marked
increase in prescription opioid misuse and
abuse. In 2004, it was estimated that the num-
ber of emergency department (ED) visits involving the
nonmedical use of prescription opioids was 144,644; in
2008 this number increased to 305,885.1 Nationally,
there were an estimated 14,800 prescription opioid
overdose deaths in 2008, representing an increase of
greater than 370% from 1999.2
Various explanations have been proposed for the
upswing, including changes in prescribing practices
and lack of public awareness about the potential of opi-
oids to cause addiction and death. The existing litera-
ture demonstrates great heterogeneity in all aspects of
opioid use: motives for opioid use, medical needs of the
user, the source of the drug, concurrent other drug use,
and comorbidities.
Gender has emerged as a distinguishing factor in the
epidemiology of prescription opioid abuse.3­7 For exam-
ple, although men still make up the majority of nonmed-
ical users of prescription opioids, the rate of rise in fatal
prescription opioids overdoses in women has been
higher: deaths among women have increased by 400%
since 1999, compared to 265% among men.8 This statis-
tic--only partially understood--highlights the impor-
tance of further investigations into the phenomenon of
prescription opioid use and how and why outcomes
may be affected by gender.
Studies have demonstrated gender differences influ-
encing initiation and ongoing nonmedical use of pre-
scription opioids, including high-risk times of
consumption, routes of administration, and particularly
motives for using prescription opioids.9 Men have been
described as using opioids more often for pleasurable

aspects or to enhance amusement, similar to the posi-
tive expectancies noted in male alcohol misuse. In con-
trast, women may engage in nonmedical use of opioids
more often to deal with negative emotions and address
interpersonal problems.3,4,6,10,11 Women are also more
likely than men to use additional medications such as
sedatives to enhance the therapeutic effects of prescrip-
tion opioids12; co-ingestion is a known risk factor for
mortality from prescription opioids. In addition, women
are more likely than men to be prescribed prescription
pain medications, are given higher doses, and use them
for longer time periods than men.8
If gender is indeed a significant factor in opioid use
and misuse, it may affect how and why women and
men present to the ED, as well as the treatments and
services they need once they engage with ED care pro-
viders. To date, gender patterns in ED presentation for
nonmedical use of prescription opioids have not been
described. Using the Drug Abuse Warning Network
(DAWN) of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Administration (SAMHSA), a nationally representative
sample of drug-related ED visits, we sought to examine
gender differences in prevalence of visits for nonmedi-
cal use of prescription opioids; drugs used in combina-
tion with opioids as a proxy for gender-based
difference in use patterns; and outcomes of opioid-
related ED visits, including disposition and mortality.
METHODS
Study Design
This was a retrospective cohort study using SAMHSA's
DAWN database. As this study used only existing, pub-
lically available, deidentified data, it was exempt from
institutional review board review.
Study Setting and Population
DAWN collects data from a nationally representative
sample of hospitals throughout the United States,
including Alaska and Hawaii.13 Nonfederal, short-stay,
general surgical and medical hospitals with a 24-hour
ED are eligible for inclusion. This analysis used the 2011
data set, the last year DAWN was funded to collect ED
visit data.
Study Protocol
For 2011, data were collected from 233 participating
hospitals, and a total of 229,211 drug-related ED visits
were identified; by applying poststratified weights to
the data received from the participating sampled hospi-
tals, the submitted cases were extrapolated to an esti-
mate of 5,067,374 drug-related ED visits out of an
estimated 126 million total ED visits. Of these drug-
related visits, 2,462,948 were considered to involve drug
misuse or abuse, with the balance involving adverse
reactions and accidental ingestions. DAWN does not
capture any other data on individual visits, including
admission diagnoses, measures of illness severity, pro-
cedures needed, length of stay, or service of admission,
except for psychiatric admissions.
For this analysis, we selected out visits involving adults
(18 years of age) and nonmedical use of pharmaceuti-
cals and excluded those related to adverse reactions,
accidental ingestions, or only involving illicit and/or
alcohol use. The 3,300 individual drugs captured by
DAWN in 2011 were reviewed by the study team to
identify those falling into categories of prescription opi-
oids, illicit drugs, antidepressants, or anxiolytics. Both
single and combination prescription opioids were
included in the first category. All drug names were
reviewed by two authors (EKC and CD), and any unrec-
ognized drugs were confirmed against a toxicology
database. Alcohol was a predefined variable in the
DAWN data set. We created individual variables to indi-
cate if the prescription opioids involved in the visits
were taken alone or in combination with other sub-
stances (primary outcomes). Other variables of interest
extracted for this study included gender, age, race, and
clinical disposition, including hospital admission or
transfer, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, referral to
outpatient detoxification, admission for inpatient detoxi-
fication or psychiatric care, and death.
Data Analysis
We calculated proportions and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) for demographic and drug use variables and com-
pared differences between women and men using uni-
variate (chi-square) analysis, defining as significant
nonoverlapping 95% CIs. We identified the top three
most frequently used drugs for women and men in each
drug/drug combination category; however, in present-
ing this list, we did not include the nonspecific category
"Narcotic analgesics NOS," which was at or near the
top for all subgroups, and reported rankings of specifi-
cally named opiates only.
We then developed logistic regression models to
examine the associations between gender and specific
drug presentations and clinical outcomes, adjusting for
age and race. These were selected a priori, rather than
through sequential or stepwise processes, based on evi-
dence in the literature. Model variables were examined
for evidence of collinearity. Model fit was evaluated
using Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit testing for
sample survey data. We also examined interactions
between gender and race; however, these did not have
significant effects in any model. Adjusted odds ratios
(aORs) for which the 95% CI did not cross the null value
of 1 were considered statistically significant. For all
analyses, we used "svy" commands in Stata to account
for weights and clustering and obtain accurate point
estimates, standard errors, CIs, and tests of hypothesis.
RESULTS
Out of an estimation sample of 1,096,741 visits, DAWN
captured 426,010 related to opioid misuse, indicating
that 23.9% (95% CI = 21.3% to 26.5%) of drug-involved
ED visits were for nonmedical use of prescription
drugs, and 38.8% (95% CI = 34.4% to 43.2%) involved
opioids. There were no significant differences between
women and men with opioid use in the proportions of
patients represented across age or race categories
(Table 1). Visits by women and by men were equally
likely to involve illicit drug use, including subsets of
cocaine and heroin use and anxiolytics; however,
women were more likely to present with antidepressant

use, while men were more likely to present with alcohol
co-ingestion (Table 1).
There were no significant overall differences between
women and men in clinical outcomes examined, includ-
ing proportions referred to outpatient detoxification or
admitted for detoxification or psychiatric reasons, hos-
pital admission or transfer, ICU admission, or death
(Table 1). More than 30% of both women and men
required hospital admission, and of those, more than
20% required ICU admission. Death was a rare outcome
for both genders.
While "narcotic analgesic NOS" was one of the most
frequently coded prescription opioids, when the agent
was identifiable, the most commonly listed individual
opioids were acetaminophen/hydrocodone (Vicodin),
single-entity oxycodone, and acetaminophen/oxycodone
(Percocet). The three most commonly reported specific
opioids, by drug/drug combination category and gen-
der, are shown in Table 2.
In the gender-stratified multivariable analyses
(Table 3), women who presented with prescription opioid
misuse with either concurrent illicit drug use or antide-
pressant use were more likely to require general hospi-
tal admission. Among men, presentations for opioids
with alcohol and with heroin increased the odds for
general hospital admission. Opioids in combination with
antidepressants were associated with ICU admission in
both women and men, although for men, wide CIs for
this outcome reflect the small numbers of male patients
with this combination. Opioids in combination with
anxiolytics were also associated with ICU admission. No
studied drug combination was associated with increa-
sed odds of death.
In both women and men, using opioids alone, rather
than in combination with alcohol or other drugs or
medications, was associated with decreased odds of
general hospital admission. Of note, several models
evaluating association with ICU admission and death
demonstrated poor fit, likely due to the small sample
sizes for these outcomes (Table 3 and Data Supplements
S1 and S2, available as supporting information in the
online version of this paper).
DISCUSSION
Previous literature has demonstrated a tremendous het-
erogeneity among opioid users in terms of patterns of
use and the interactions between types of use and sub-
groups of gender, race/ethnicity, familial substance
abuse, routes of administration, concurrent drug use,
and comorbid psychiatric and medical disorders.10,14­17
With the premise that understanding the needs of spe-
cific subgroups of users may help develop more effec-
tive screening and treatment approaches, we examined
a gender-stratified, nationally representative population
of opioid users seeking ED care.
Opioid use in the study population was high, and men
and women were equally represented among opioids
users. Although men and women used similar types of
prescription opioids in combination with alcohol, illicit
drugs, and antidepressants, there were differences
between them in clinical outcomes within drug combina-
tion categories. This may be due to patterns or amounts
of drugs taken, polysubstance use, or different thresh-
olds for seeking health care. The difference may also be
biological: observed sex differences include greater
susceptibility to adverse effects of drugs, which may also
contribute to gender differences in hospital admission
and ICU care involving these drug combinations.
For both men and women, opioids taken alone posed
similarly lower risks for need for hospitalization com-
pared to when taken in combination with other sub-
stances, an intuitive finding that confirms the higher
risk of co-ingestion observed in previous studies.18,19
Further, the lower risk of single agent was similar
between genders, even though the specific agent
involved differed between men and women who pre-
sented with opioids alone.
Among the drug combinations studied, ICU admis-
sion was associated with opioids and antidepressants
for both women and men and with opioids and anxio-
lytics only for men. Although this study did not examine
the characteristics of the nonopioid drugs involved in
the ED visits, it may be that the long-acting formula-
tions available for these drug categories played a role in
the need for ICU-level care. There may be additional
factors underlying the gender differences observed for
opioids and anxiolytics, such as the quantities or formu-
lations of anxiolytics taken by men who presented to
the ED with this drug combination.
Women in the DAWN data set were more likely to
have opioid ingestions in combination with antidepres-
sants and men more likely to use opioids with alcohol,
consistent with previous literature that described

gender-specific reasons for opioid use.20 We also found
that these particular combinations were clinically severe
(i.e., were associated with elevated odds of hospitaliza-
tion) for each gender. Further study is needed to under-
stand the explanation for this; it may be that social
expectations or biases on the part of medical/behavioral
health care providers make women more likely to have
opioids and antidepressants prescribed together, pre-
scribed in a way or used or metabolized by women in a
way that creates higher risk for presentation to the ED
and hospitalization. Similarly, alcohol and opioids may
be a particularly dangerous combination in men,
whether because of gender-determined differences in
the way opioids and alcohol are taken together or less
caution in screening for alcohol problems or prescrib-
ing opioids to men with histories of high-risk alcohol
use.
With ED visits for prescription opioid misuse still on
the rise, our study adds to the literature supporting an
important role for the ED in examining and preventing
medication safety errors, improving safer prescribing of
opioids, and educating patients about combinations and
drug­drug interactions.21,22 Our study underscores the
importance of considering the patient's history of sub-
stance abuse and mental health conditions and current
medication lists--such as referencing a prescription

monitoring program--when making prescribing deci-
sions, and of advising patients, particularly those treated
with other medications, of the serious potential for addic-
tion or death.23
Prior studies have characterized gender differences in
prescription opioid misuse based on self-report. This
study provides more objective data on opioid misuse
among a subset of men and women who experienced
clinically significant consequences of drug use and asso-
ciated co-ingestions. While these data cannot elucidate
the root cause of these differences, they provide impe-
tus for a deeper, gender-specific understanding of the
complex factors that may lead to serious morbidity from
prescription opioids.
LIMITATIONS
The DAWN data were collected through retrospective
chart review, and thus the determination of eligibility
for an individual case was dependent on the quality and
accuracy of clinical information captured in the patient
chart. It is possible that biases on the part of clinicians
could lead to overrepresentation of drug misuse for one
gender or the other. Clinical information captured in
DAWN is limited. Although we could observe drugs
and drug combinations implicated in visits, we are not
able to correlate these with clinical diagnoses, pain-
related complaints, co-occurring medical or psychiatric
issues, or other specific information that would enable
us to more thoroughly evaluate potential confounders of
the relationship between opioid use and gender. The
data were confined to individuals 18 years and older;
thus, findings may not generalize to younger popula-
tions presenting to the ED. Finally, in this exploratory
analysis, we did not achieve good fit for some of the
models examining drug combinations and the rarer out-
comes of ICU admission and death. These associations
merit further exploration in a larger dataset powered to
examine these serious outcomes more closely.
CONCLUSIONS
Emergency department visits related to prescription opi-
oid misuse are numerous and often involve combinations
with other substances. We found gender differences in
these visits, especially in patterns of co-ingestions of
other substances and associations between specific drug
combinations and hospital admission. A better under-
standing of the gender factors involved in the initiation,
misuse, treatment needs, and clinical outcomes may
inform the development of gender-specific interventions
and preventive measures.
