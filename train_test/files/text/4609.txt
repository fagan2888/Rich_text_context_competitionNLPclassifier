Introduction
Autophagy plays a critical role in growth and develop-
ment, and its physiological function is to be involved in the
normal growth and development process of cells and in
maintaining metabolic balance; to promote the production
of amino acids by self-degradation when nutritional defi-
ciencies occur1­3 and under certain pressure conditions,
such as in the presence of injury or nutritional deficiencies,
to remove unwanted or injured cells in organs. Autophagy
is a type of programmed cell death. It has been suggested
to be essential for cellular homeostasis. It can determine
cellular survival, together with apoptosis and necrosis.4,5
Autophagy activity levels are very low in physiological
conditions, and it is upregulated in many pathophysiologi-
cal processes.6,7 Because cardiomyocytes are terminally-
differentiated cells that cannot divide again, suitable
autophagy is essential for the maintenance of cardiomyo-
cyte homeostasis. So autophagocytic deficiencies or
excesses are associated with many cardiac pathologies,
such as ischemia and heart failure. 8­10 It seems that mod-
est levels of autophagy appear to be protective, while high
levels of autophagy may cause self-digestion and promote
cell death.11
Autophagy is regulated by many autophagy-related
genes (Atgs), which are involved in autophagosome forma-
tion.12,13 Beclin-1 is an important marker of autophagy.14 It
is possible to control the process of autophagy by up-regu-
lating or down-regulating microtubule-associated protein
light chain3 (LC3): The molecular mechanism for this
effect has yet to be elucidated. As we know, it has been
demonstrated that microRNAs, which negatively regulate
protein expression in diverse biological and pathological
processes, play an important role in myocardial injury.15­17

Abstract
Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate whether MiR-30a regulates autophagy by regulating the Beclin-1
protein, which is the marker for autophagosomes during myocardial injury, when induced by angiotensin II (Ang II).
Methods: We randomly assigned 20 rats into two equal groups: Control group and Ang II group. We detected the
expression of MiR-30a by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and we employed western blotting
to detect the protein expression of Beclin-1.
Results: In this study, we found that Ang II induced cardiomyocyte autophagy, together with down-regulation of MiR-
30a and upregulation of the Beclin-1 protein. We also found that the Beclin-1 protein is regulated by MiR-30a, by
transferring a MiR-30a mimic or AMO-204 into the cardiomyocytes.
Conclusion: These studies provided evidence that MiR-30a plays an important role in regulating autophagy through the
Beclin-1 protein, during myocardial injury induced by Ang II.

It was observed that many microRNAs regulate cell apop-
tosis18­21; however, it is well known that when apoptosis is
blocked, the cells that preferentially die by apoptosis, may
die by autophagy.22 So it is beneficial for cell survival if
autophagy becomes inhibited, together with apoptosis. We
found that MiR-30a, which has an anti-apoptotic effect,
may also regulate Beclin-1 expression through the nine
complementary bases, according to the bioinformatics of
Targetscan. Thus, the present study was undertaken to see
whether MiR-30a was dysregulated by angiotensin II (Ang
II), and if it may inhibit autophagy during hypoxia-reoxy-
genation, by regulating Beclin-1.
Materials and methods
Animal care
All animal experiments were approved by the Animal
Research Ethics Committee of Guangzhou Medical
University, Guangzhou, China. The investigation con-
formed to the guide for the care and use of laboratory ani-
mals published by the US National Institutes of Health
(NIH). We randomly assigned 20 rats into two equal groups:
Control group (Con group) and Ang II group (n = 10 each).
LDH assay
We collected serum from blood after 180 min of reperfusion,
for determination of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels.
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR of MiR-30a
Total RNA of cells was isolated by using TRIzol reagent, and
thenreversetranscribedaccordingtothemanufacturer'sinstruc-
tions (Fermentas, Shanghai, China). The annealing temperature
of miRNA-204 was set at 60°C. The comparative threshold
cycle (Ct) method with the arithmetic formula (Equation (1))
below was used to determine relative quantitation of gene
expression of both target and housekeeping genes (-actin):
2-Ct (1)
The MiR-30a primers used in the study are shown in Table 1.
Western blot
We determined protein concentrations with the BCA pro-
tein assay kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ,
USA), according the manufacturer's protocol. Equal
amounts of protein (60 µg) from the cardiomyocytes were
subjected to Western blot analysis, to evaluate Beclin-1
expression with an ECL detection kit (Amersham
Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Beclin-1 immunoreactivity
was detected using a rabbit antiserum specific for rat
Beclin-1 protein (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) as primary
antibodies. Detection of antigen-antibody complex forma-
tion was performed with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-
conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. The
Beclin-1 concentrations were normalized with the values
for -actin concentration.
Statistical analysis
Quantitative data are presented as mean ± standard error
(SE). Statistical significance was determined using the T
test or 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA); p < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
Myocardium injury was induced by Ang II
The extent of myocardial infarction was evaluated after
injury. Representative photographs of midventricular
cross-sections of Evans blue and Triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC)-stained hearts were taken from the Control
and Ang II groups. Infarct area (INF)/ area at risk (AAR)
and LDH are shown in Figure 1.
Ang II decreased the expression of MiR-30a
To demonstrate the effect of Ang II on MiR-30a, we com-
pared the MiR-30a between the Con group and Ang II
group (n = 10 each). Using RT-PCR, we found that Ang II
significantly decreased MiR-30a (Figure 2).
Ang II up-regulated the protein level of Beclin-1
As a marker of autophagosomes, the protein level of
Beclin-1 represents the amount of autophagosomes pre-
sent; thus, we compared the ratio of Beclin-1/-actin
between the control group and IR group. It has been
reported that autophagy contributes to cell death when
apoptosis is inhibited, and sometimes the early stages of
autophagy were required for apoptosis. Beclin-1 was the
marker of autophagosomes, so the ratio of Beclin-1/-actin

could stand for the level of autophagy. In our study, we
found that Ang II up-regulated the protein expression of
Beclin-1, together with increasing the ratio of the Ang II
group (n = 10); and we found that Beclin-1 was enhanced
by Ang II (Figure 3).
Discussion
Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent degradation pathway
widely existent within eukaryotic cells as a self-protection
mechanism in response to harmful stimulation; and the
functions of autophagy are not only to be involved in sur-
rounding and isolating damaged organelles, but more
importantly, in transporting the surrounded materials to
lysosomes for degradation, and thus to produce amino
acids, ATP and other substances in order to maintain the
energy metabolism cycle of the body.
Autophagy has attracted great interest because it is
involved in many physiological processes. If autophagy
destroys the cytosol and organelles beyond a certain

threshold, autophagic cell death will occur. Autophagy
was detrimental during reperfusion, although it protected
the cardiomyocytes during ischemia, as demonstrated by
Matsui et al.23 and his autophagy cell. Thus, it would be
beneficial for revascularized hearts to find a method of
regulating Beclin-1 expression. Non-coding RNAs regu-
late gene expression in a sequence-dependent manner:
They are endogenous regulators of gene expression, dem-
onstrated to be involved in cardiac injury.
According to the bioinformatics of Targetscan, MiR-
30a, which has an anti-apoptosis effect, may regulate the
expression of Beclin-1. In our study, we found that Ang II
could down-regulate MiR-30a, together with up-regulat-
ing Beclin-1 protein. When a MiR-30a mimic was trans-
ferred into cardiomyocytes, Beclin-1 protein was
attenuated; while Beclin-1 protein was up-regulated by
AMO-204, which was concentration-dependent. But
LC3-I was not regulated by MiR-30a, as was seen in the
previous study. These results demonstrated that MiR-30a
may regulate cardiomyocyte autophagy through Beclin-1,
during injury induced by Ang II.23,24
Our rat study results demonstrated that MiR-30a plays
an important role by regulating the Beclin-1 protein during
Ang II damage, so it became possible to control the
autophagy under a beneficial threshold by regulating
MiR-30a expression, to protect cardiomyocytes against
injury induced by Ang II.
