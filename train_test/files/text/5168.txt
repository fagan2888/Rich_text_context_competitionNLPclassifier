Introduction
The past two decades have seen rise to momentous develop-
ments in Internet capabilities and complexities, and the surge
of usage has changed the face of the world that we live in. In
response to such expansive developments of the Internet,
researchers are now beginning to make use of the valuable
new data forms that to date have been under-exploited. Yet,
it can be argued that the ethical approaches and guidelines
have not been adequately discussed or updated in response to
this (Stainton, 2016). Ethical challenges arise in all designs
and approaches and at all stages of research projects and the
expanding regulatory structure of ethics bureaucracy within
academia has been described as `colonising new groups,
practices, and institutions, while at the same time intensify-
ing the regulation of practices deemed to fall within its offi-
cial ambit' (Haggerty, 2004: 394).
Despite many ethical issues being difficult to define
(Seale, 2012), it is therefore imperative that researchers do
their upmost to identify any potential ethical implications
that could occur and to overcome these in order to meet the
regulatory demands of the institution with which they are
working. Social researchers have discussed research ethics
for specific methodologies for years, and there are clear
guidelines to adopt for those undertaking traditional methods
of data collection such as surveys and interviews. However,
when undertaking data collection methods of a more innova-
tive nature, such as travel blog analysis, researchers are given
little direction.
This reflective article stems from ethical discussions and
an arduous ethical approval process experienced while
undertaking PhD research (Stainton, 2017). During this
time, it was found to be the case that for research involving

Abstract
Social researchers have been required to consider the potential ethical implications of their research since research began.
Recently however, the importance placed upon research ethics has undoubtedly increased, evident through the formation of
additional ethic committees, the production of various ethical guidelines and the increased number of publications addressing
the concept. However, with the emergence of new and diverse research approaches, it can be suggested that there should
also be the development of new and diverse ethical approaches. In this article, we consider the ethical stance taken when
undertaking travel blog analysis and argue that due to the diverse and continuously evolving nature of travel blogs, the blanket
approach that is so frequently adopted by researchers is not sufficient. We reflect on the ethics of utilising travel blog content
as a method of data collection by considering the importance of whether the blogger is viewed as a human subject, whether
data collected from blogs are public or private, the need for informed consent and whether the blogger should be viewed
as an author or a respondent. We then proceed to contribute to the body of existing ethical research by proposing a set of
broad ethical principles that can be applied for those undertaking travel blog analysis.

analysing blogs as a data source, there were no specific
guidelines or suggested ethical approaches from which we
could work from. Rather, we were required to succumb to
generic ethical procedures. These generic approaches, how-
ever, failed to take into account the complexities of the
human world combined with the Internet sphere, which is a
relatively new realm within academia. Research addressing
online research methodologies remains to be in its infancy
and thus the ethical implications associated are substantially
under-researched. There were certain characteristics of blog
analysis, as we proceed to discuss throughout this article,
that posed new dilemmas for our research. This article there-
fore is designed to bring awareness to social researchers
working in the field of online methodologies while providing
guidance to the future travel blog researcher.
Netnography in the `blogosphere'
In recent years, the Internet and online social networking
have become an integral part of society. As a result of the
importance and reliance placed upon online presence,
researchers have begun to turn to Internet sources, such as
blogs, as a valuable means of data collection (e.g. Carson and
Schmallegger, 2008; Hookway, 2008; Punch, 2014).
Research such as this can be described as netnography ­ a
form of ethnographic data collection undertaken via the
Internet, unique in that it is neither observational of a life
lived nor told in a research situation, but instead posted by
tourists (Blicheldt and Marabese, 2014; Meged et al., 2014).
Netnography can be undertaken through analysis of a
number of online means, including Facebook updates,
tweets, recommendations on Trip Advisor, discussions on
specialised online forums and blogs (Meged et al., 2014).
These online means fall within the realms of what is collec-
tively known as Web 2.0. This is seen as the second stage of
Internet development, whereby generators have stepped
away from traditional statically designed web pages, towards
user-generated content (UGC) and peer-to-peer applications
(Carson, 2008). Of these online means, blogs are considered
to be `the next evolution of the web-based experience'(Kahn
and Kellner, 2004: 91) and have demonstrated rapid growth
(Hookway, 2008; Mack et al., 2008; Pan et al., 2007).
The forms and appearances of blogs are manifold and
coveravastarrayofsubjectmatter(CarsonandSchmallegger,
2008; Gaille, 2013; Technorati, 2013), including travel and
tourism. These sources can be data-rich, containing valuable
information that may otherwise be unavailable to researchers
(Banyai and Glover, 2012; Stainton, 2016). Travel blogs are
frequently the equivalent of personal online diaries, made up
from one or more individual entries strung together by a
common theme. They are commonly written by tourists to
report back to friends and families about their activities and
experiences during trips (Puhringer and Taylor, 2008: 179).
Blogs are frequently updated and displayed in reverse chron-
ological and they tend to be interactive in nature, allowing
readers to post comments (Carson and Schmallegger, 2008).
In tourism studies, travel blogs have thus far been defined
as online diaries containing individual entries related to the
author's travel experience (Banyai and Glover, 2012;
Puhringer and Taylor, 2008). There is a growing body of
research (e.g. Carson, 2008; Litvin, et al., 2008; Pan et al.,
2007; Wenger, 2008) suggesting that such blogs contain rich
data regarding travellers' behaviour, expectations and
demands, and success or failure of destination marketing
campaigns, the analysis of which could prove more benefi-
cial than the use of traditional marketing tools (Akehurst,
2009). It can be argued, however, that the nature of travel
blogs extends beyond the notion of simply documenting
experiences, with many travel bloggers now running their
websites as a career option, where the aim is to enhance read-
ership and to facilitate opportunities to make money through
aspects such as advertising, as opposed to simply document-
ing their personal experiences. This is an area not currently
addressed within the existing body of literature that is worthy
of consideration.
Travel bloggers are free to upload a range of content of
their choice, making this data source unique in that it is not
in any way influenced by the researcher. Furthermore, data
from blogs derive from naturally occurring, communal,
cross-consumer interaction that is not found in alternative
research methods (Meged et al., 2014; Banyai and
Glover, 2012). In 2013, there were over 152 million blogs
accounted for on the Internet (Gaille, 2013). According to
Technorati's (2013) Digital Influence Report, blogs rank
among the top five `most trustworthy' sources for informa-
tion on the Internet with consumers and in 2009, 20% of all
the blogs were tagged as travel blogs (Technorati, 2009).
However, despite such popularity of blogs as a method of
research outside of academia, this has not to date been ech-
oed within scholarly practice (Snee, 2010) and research on
travel blogs is still in its infancy (Banyai and Glover,
2012). Therefore, it can be noted that there is potentially
valuable information in the form of travel blogs that is yet
to be explored by academics.
Ethical dilemmas for travel blog
researchers
Research has recently begun to emerge addressing the ethical
considerations of online research (e.g.Association of Internet
Researchers (AoIR), 2012; Boellstorff et al., 2012; Economic
and Social Research Council (ESRC), 2015; Snee, 2013);
however, available protocols and guidelines are scarce and at
large generically applied, despite recent calls for an ongoing
debate and dialogue of ethical conduct of online research
(Flicker et al., 2004; Stainton, 2017; Whitehead, 2007 and
Holmes, 2009). TheAoIR (2012), for example, has attempted
to address the issue of ethics within Internet research.
However, rather than provide explicit guidelines, they sug-
gest that traditional ethical principles are followed where
possible and that an individual assessment is undertaken on
each study involving Internet research. In doing so, they
Stainton and Iordanova 3
suggest that researchers make ethical considerations with
regard to how the context is assessed; who is involved in the
study; what is the primary object of study; how data are
stored, managed and represented; how texts, persons or data
are being studied; how findings are presented; any harms or
risks associated with the study; the potential benefits of the
study; and any issues that may arise involving vulnerable
people. While the adaptation of traditional ethical principles
may be appropriate in some instances, it can be argued that
with the scope of opportunities for the development of online
methodologies now available to researchers, these principles
may not always suffice. ESRC (2015) Framework for
Research ethics has recognised some of the new or unfamil-
iar ethics questions and dilemmas associated with online
research, but fails to provide clear guidelines beyond the
requirement that a full ethics review should take place prior
to the data collection process. Although this may give
researchers a little more direction, it can be argued that this
approach of utilising standardised rules and principles is not
sufficient when research involves the use of methodologies
that are of a unique or under-researched nature, such as travel
blog analysis.
Kitchin (2007) distinguishes between online research and
web-based research (which is split into non-intrusive and
engaged research) and argues that each type of Internet-
based research faces different ethical dilemmas and practices
depending on the level of engagement of researchers and the
role they play in the research context, where an increased
level of interaction between researchers and participants
leads to more complex ethical issues and challenges. Non-
intrusive web-based research is considered to be when there
is no interaction between the participants and the research-
ers, and the research relies entirely on the analysis of existing
data. During engaged web-based research, on the other hand,
there is interaction between the researchers and the partici-
pants to clarify the existing data or to ensure understanding.
On the other side of the continuum is online research where
researchers are not only observers, but also active partici-
pants in the research context (Kitchin, 2007). This echoes
Buchanan's (2011: 92) observation that `a continuum of
online research is emerging'; whereas on one extreme the
research is seen as not subject-based at all, on the other end,
there is an increased concern regarding potential risks for the
research participants. This emphasises the blurred dynamics
of online research and its associated ethical considerations,
further indicating the need for the development of a set of
guidelines specific to the particular methodology employed.
Is travel blog research human subject research or
not?
Some of the ethical dilemmas and challenges in Internet
research originate from the lack of clarity about `whether
people in the online world are the subjects of research ... or
authors of works ... which they have knowingly put into the
public domain for information and comment' (Oates, 2006:
65). Various studies (Canadian Institute of Health Research
(CIHR) et al., 2010; Walter, 2002) also indicate that research
of non-intrusive nature where cyber-material such as docu-
ments, records, performances and online archival materials
publicly available and analysed without any interaction
between the researcher and the participants differs from the
traditionally so-called human subject research.
Although it is by no means clear-cut, it can be, therefore,
argued that despite travel blogs being written by human par-
ticipants, this material is in the public domain and is thus not
human data (ESRC, 2012). Moreover, the lack of interaction
between the human participants and the researchers suggests
that ethical guidelines applicable to human participants are
less valid within travel blog analysis (CIHR et al., 2010).
However, it can also be argued whether blog content neatly
fits into either segment and that the content is neither an
author nor a subject. In fact, the Internet complicates the
realities of personhood, and it can be suggested that rather
than fitting into either of the above categories, a blog can be
seen as a digital extension of the self (Markham and
Buchanan, 2012). Snee (2013), for example, viewed blog-
gers as the authors within her study of the narratives of young
people taking a gap year, but the blog content as the author's
public documents.
Travel blogs are written for a number of different pur-
poses and as such should be ethically examined individually.
Take the traditional association that blogs have with diaries,
for example. While this may provide rich and valuable data,
it can be argued that the very nature of a diary is that it con-
sists of private and personal entries written by the owner. It
would be unethical to utilise somebody's diary for research
purposes without seeking permission should this be tangible,
even if the diary was left in a public space, yet these ethical
views are not generally applied to travel blogs that effec-
tively act as `online diaries'. This highlights not only the dif-
ferences between ethical approaches to online and offline
data sources, despite the often-similar nature that they may
have, but also the different blog types. As such, while the
presented ethical guidelines in this article may be better
suited to online as opposed to offline research, it is important
to note that due to the diverse nature of blogs, these guide-
lines are intended to be flexible in correspondence with the
data type.
Private or public space?
It is argued by some researchers (Thurlow et al., 2004) that
privacy issues represent the most important ethical hurdle for
online researchers. The simplicity of the division between
public and private Internet data complicates the issue even
further, as research perceived as non-intrusive conducted in
public spaces does not require to be scrutinised for ethical
issues in the same way as research conducted in private
spaces (CIHR et al., 2010). Furthermore, in some instances,
it might avoid the ethical review process altogether (Madge,
2007).
4 Methodological Innovations
This debate is problematic, however, as there is no clear
definition of what is `private' on the Internet, and it can be
suggested that there is a lack of awareness about who can
access online communications and who cannot (Hudson and
Bruckman, 2005), meaning that some people may post con-
tent in the public domain without the intentions of it being
publicly accessible. In many instances, for example, non-
intrusive research is compared to research conducted in pub-
lic spaces such as parks, town squares and shopping centres
where it cannot be expected from people around the partak-
ing parties not to pay attention to the conversation when they
are close enough to listen in (Kitchin, 2007).
In the context of travel blogging, however, this should
not, at large, be an issue as the very nature of blogging is to
publicly publish content, and it can be assumed that most
travel bloggers are aware of this when they create and man-
age their websites. What may not be as clear, however, is
whether the information is `psychologically private'. Frankel
and Siang (1999) proposed that there are two distinct types
of privacy within Internet research: technological and psy-
chological. If a travel blog post is technologically private, a
reader would require a password or a unique link to access it.
As the majority of travel bloggers manage their websites
themselves, it can be assumed that they will be aware of any
technological privacy, and this therefore is not deemed a sig-
nificant issue within travel blog analysis. There are, how-
ever, several considerations to be made by researchers
regarding psychological privacy.
Psychological privacy suggests that the travel bloggers
may post content that is viewed as personal or private, and
although they may be aware that it has been posted within the
public domain, they have no intentions of their personal
information to be viewed by the many and potentially used
for research purposes, despite the argument by Hewson et al.
(2003) that data that have been made deliberately and volun-
tarily available in the public Internet domain could be used
for research purposes under the condition that participants'
identity is protected (Madge, 2007).
An example of psychological privacy can be when a
travel blogger chooses to hide their identity; they may not
want to be affiliated with the blog content, and thus, their
association remains private. Furthermore, the concept of per-
ceived privacy is worthy of discussion. Online contributors
often have unrealistic expectations of privacy and confiden-
tiality that are unlikely to reflect the reality (Warrell and
Jacobsen, 2014). What one person may perceive as being
private, another may not, for instance, the backpacker may
produce their blog with the intentions of only their family
viewing it, thus perceiving it as private, and although pub-
licly available, they do not consider the possibility that peo-
ple they do not know may also view the content. Another
travel blogger, however, such as the person running their
blog for monetary value, may be very aware of the potential
publicity of what they publish because the content is situated
in the public domain.
Often it is a judgement call of the travel blog researcher
and/or the research ethics approval panel as to what consti-
tutes public and what constitutes private online space, but in
making this decision, Warrell and Jacobsen's (2014) set of
questions could be considered: (1) what type of information
is being shared (simple facts and everyday conversations, or
personal and intimate) and (2) is the online space password
protected or not. In essence, the argument is not necessarily
about whether the blog content is public or private, rather it
is about making sensible and ethical decisions based upon
the content being reviewed.
Informed consent
One of the most frequent references to ethics within social
research refers to the importance of gaining informed consent
(e.g. Huberman and Miles, 1994; Punch, 2014; Seale, 2012),
whereby questions such as when is informed consent required,
how can it be obtained, and how can it be validated (Frankel
and Siang, 1999: 7) arise. Informed consent is based upon the
principle that individuals are given the opportunity to decide
whether they wish to participate in the research or not. In order
for consent to be `informed', the reason for the study, the
requirements of the participants and any potential harm or
risks must be explained (Seale, 2012). Human subject research
norms such as informed consent, however, do not apply to
public, published material, and as such, consent is not required
when analysing traditional texts such as newspapers and liter-
ature (Bradley and Carter, 2012; Snee, 2013). Moreover, it
could prove impossible to obtain informed consent for already
existing information in online settings due to intentional or
unintentional lack of traces of the author (Punch, 2014; Warrell
and Jacobsen, 2014). Whereas there are clear boundaries when
reviewing texts such as a newspaper article, as demonstrated
in the previous paragraph, these boundaries are blurred when
it comes to blog analysis. One could view a blog as secondary
data source, where the material has been published in line with
a newspaper article or a magazine, for example. If this view is
taken, this does not require travel blog researchers to obtain
informed consent as this is perceived as non-intrusive based
research (Kitchin, 2007).
Finally, it can be questioned whether contacting travel
bloggers in order to gain consent to use their blog content for
research purposes is appropriate. Many bloggers choose to
provide little or no detail of who they are and how they can
be contacted. This indicates that they may not wish to be
disturbed. Furthermore, blogs are available in the public
domain; therefore, a blogger may feel that it is unnecessary
for a researcher to contact them to ask permission to use their
content as they are aware that the content is available pub-
licly. Sending permission requests to bloggers may also be
viewed as spam, as being intrusive or as an invasion of the
bloggers' privacy (Hewson et al., 2003) and consequently
influence participants behaviour should they wish not to be
subjects of a research study (Warrell and Jacobsen, 2014).
Stainton and Iordanova 5
Anonymity and authorship
It is widely accepted that participants in offline research
retain ownership over their words originating from the notion
that they have the right to have their contribution withdrawn
from a piece of research prior to publishing it. This denotes
that if online research is seen in the same way as offline
research, travel bloggers should have the same `ownership'
rights and receive credits for their work. If, however, travel
blog research is seen as `textual analysis' of data with no-
restrictive access, the obligation towards the author(s) should
not be of concern (Bradley and Carter, 2012; Warrell and
Jacobsen, 2014). However, the latter perspective is chal-
lenged by some as the existence of any `text' understandably
suggests the existence of a human author towards whom
researchers have certain obligations and responsibilities
(Harre, 1992; Warrell and Jacobsen, 2014). In contrast, there
may be some cases, such as those writing personal diary-
based blogs, for example, where authors might have the
desire to stay anonymous (Liu, 2010). This resonances
Bruckman's (2002) argument that Internet users should be
perceived as `amateur artists' who should receive credit for
the work they do should they wish so.
Based on the above viewpoints, the decision as to whether
to reveal participants' identity and give them credit for their
work or to keep them anonymous is a complex one, where
context along with researchers' ethical and philosophical
position and recommendations from ethical committees are
crucial (Madge, 2007; Warrell and Jacobsen, 2014). As such,
it is recommended that each blog type is analysed in corre-
spondence with suggested ethical guidelines while paying
specific consideration to nature of the blogs being examined
in order to justify the most suitable approach.
Proposed ethical guidelines for travel
blog research
Overall, it can be seen that while there are broad ethical dis-
cussions that have taken place, none provide the travel blog
researcher with clear guidelines from which to work. In an
attempt, therefore, to contribute to the debate and to provide
a basis from which travel blog researchers can ground their
ethical principles, a set of six guidelines have been produced
encompassing the arguments presented in this article while
allowing for the flexibility and adaptation that is needed for
different blog types and different types of research.
1. Informed consent
This should be considered on an individual basis and will
vary depending on the nature of research. As a general guide,
informed consent is not necessary for those who have know-
ingly published the content to be researched in the public
domain. However, content that is of a particularly private or
personal nature should be considered individually and
assessed as `psychologically private' if deemed necessary by
the researcher.
2. Author or subject
The researcher should decide whether the content used for
research purposes acts as a primary data source (i.e. the
travel blog content is the `subject') or from a secondary data
source (i.e. the travel blog content acts as the author). This
will be dependent upon the research design and outcomes
and will affect whether the travel blogger is anonymous or
whether credit is attributed to them. This should be clearly
explained and justified by the researcher.
3. Online and offline principles
If the travel blog examined can be seen as the same as an
offline data source, for instance, a diary, then the ethical prin-
ciples should be no different whether the content is located
online or offline.
4. Duty of care
Travel blog researchers should be conscious of the potential
authors or contributors of the blog, and if it is suspected that
they may be a member of a vulnerable community or indi-
cates that the blog was not intended for public or research
purposes, the researcher should apply a traditional ethical
approach.
5. Data protection
In large, this is not applicable to travel blogs, whereby the
content is publicly available on the Internet although indi-
vidual consideration should be made depending on the nature
of the blogs. Data interrogation and analysis should be stored
in a safe, secure and private place.
6. Accuracy of data obtained
If there is a risk that data may not be entirely accurate or are
not verifiable, this should be noted as a limitation by the
researcher.
The above guidelines have been produced to enable travel
blog researchers with some sense of direction, as opposed to
dichotomous obligation. Following the recommendations of
theAoIR (2012), it is recommended within travel blog research
that the core ethical principles should be applied, but that these
are then tailored to the specific needs of the research context.
While these proposed guidelines, however, can operationally
act as a useful basis from which the ethical blog researcher can
work, it is important to note that they are not without their
limitations. Most notably, this is the subjective interpretation
of the blogs, their intended audience and the authorship. It is
also important to note that while these proposed guidelines
6 Methodological Innovations
may be a useful starting point for the researcher, it is important
that the ethical approach is adapted to suit the needs of the
specific blog types under examination in relation to the aims
of the research at hand. Ethical judgement in Internet, and sub-
sequently blog research, inevitably relies on inductive, contex-
tual assessment of the specific case in question, and it is
important to highlight that different ethical choices may be
equally as legitimate and sound (Lomborg, 2013).
Conclusion
As demonstrated throughout this article, utilising blogs as a
method of data collection, in our experience, required
thoughtful and reflective analysis in order to address any
potential ethical implications. Our experiences raised an
abundance of questions that we have subsequently addressed
in the preceding paragraphs. We have concluded that
although to take an individual approach to ethically analys-
ing blogs is evidently the most suitable, it is beneficial if
researchers have a foundation from which to base their deci-
sions. Therefore, this article contributes to the existing body
of literature by proposing a set of guidelines for social
researchers, choosing to adopt travel blog analysis as their
chosen research method to work from.
While debates on the suitability of the current regulatory
structure of ethics bureaucracy within academia continue, for
now researchers must work within the framework that they
are provided and succumb to the processes necessary in
order to achieve the correct permissions to undertake their
work. In light of this, this article has outlined the key con-
cerns for researchers choosing to analyse travel blogs. As
outlined in this article, there are a range of methodological
research approaches utilising the Internet as a means of data
collection that are emerging in parallel with the increased use
of the Internet in society. While these data may yield valua-
ble data that previously may have been unavailable to the
researcher, however, it is clear that the current ethical bound-
aries are unclear. This article therefore contributes to the lim-
ited body of methodological literature addressing blog
analysis as a method of data collection, addressing some of
the current ambiguities surrounding ethical online research
and subsequently providing a set of flexible, yet informed
guidelines for researchers to work from. This can be argued
essential in a world of increasing scrutiny in research ethics.
