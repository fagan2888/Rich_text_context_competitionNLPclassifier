Introduction
Against the wake of No Child Left Behind (NCLB) declining
graduation rates, and gaps in academic achievement because
of standardized testing, multicultural and critical scholarship
and research has been advocating action of "true change and
equity" that merges race with gender, class, and language
(Banks, 2004; Pinar, 2004; Gay, 2011; Jupp & Slattery, 2010;
Ladson-Billings, 2011; Landsman & Lewis, 2011). Aside
from the negative impact on students, teachers continue to
leave their classrooms no longer able to serve the student
even in the name of academic equity and racial harmony.
There has also been little qualitative inquiry into increased
teacher mental wellness research, preservice teacher mental
health training, and interventions to help treat teachers mar-
ginalized and stigmatized by society as psychotic, insane, or
out of touch with reality, despite high rates of pedagogical
depression. Increased mental wellness research becomes
particularly important when depression usually lies quietly
boxed in the closets of critical theory and multicultural edu-
cation research, as illness, disability, and sometimes "other"
(Banks & Banks, 2001; Jupp & Slattery, 2010; Sleeter &
Grant, 1999).
In the very practice of avoiding a "vacuum of the self," Tim
Wise (2004) claims the notion of lens-forming called on by
qualitative researchers seemingly is deemed complete once
the researcher's identity of race, gender, class, and sometimes
language is revealed to the reader. These simplistic concep-
tions further problematize the importance of individual White
male hegemonic voices who may have genetic and biological
links to mental illness not necessarily caused alone by envi-
ronmental and sociocultural factors, yet who are enacting
equity and antiracist curriculum needed in predominantly
White classrooms. This call beckons classroom research that
Henry Giroux (1992) says transcends borders, and in what
Geneva Gay (2011) calls "affective, humanistic, and transfor-
mative" ways (p. 39), by helping teachers and students explore
new landscapes of learning, and making individual choices
and relativity within the global community (Greene, 1978).

The Lost Carpetbagger: Complicating
Geographical and Psychological "Place"
in the South for a Northern-Born
White Teacher
David L. Humpal1
Abstract
The following discussion highlights the impact depression and anxiety can have on perceptions of psychological and geographical
"place" for a Southern, White male teacher studying racism and prejudice in the predominantly White rural high school
community he lives and works. The teacher-researcher utilizes autoethnographical and psychoanalytical techniques of critical
reflection and self-applied transportation theory, and arts-based research to unravel these perceptions and to enhance his
autobiographical findings of both geographical and psychological place. One intent of the nonnative teacher-researcher was
to uncover one predominantly White Texas high school community's actions and thoughts of racism and prejudice through
his own eyes while at times suffering from a relapse of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and anxiety. Another intent was to
give the teacher-researcher further perspectives into his biography, his own attitudes of racism, prejudice, and inequality, and
further understandings into the underlying causes of depression that bound his experiences in geographical and psychological
place. Findings suggest that this teacher-researcher's use of psychological techniques while suffering from a relapse of MDD
and anxiety can negatively impact his ability to locate physical and psychological aspects of place.

The following discussion of place has been bracketed
from my autoethnographic study titled "Challenging Ghosts
in the Hegemonic Closet: An Autoethnography," which
highlights the perceptions of a Southern, White male teacher,
at times experiencing bouts of Major Depressive Disorder
(MDD) and anxiety in the predominantly White rural high
school community of Big Falls, Texas (mythical in name).
As the researcher-teacher I utilize critical reflection, self-
imposed transportation theory, and arts-based research to
unravel these perceptions and to enhance his autobiographi-
cal findings.
While one intent of this study was to give a White male
further perspectives into his biography and his attitudes of
racism, prejudice, and inequality, and further understanding
into the underlying causes of depression that bound his expe-
riences in one place, another intent was to uncover one pre-
dominantly White Southern high school community's actions
and thoughts through the eyes of someone not born and
established in the community. The study reveals that critical
reflection and self-imposed transportation theory, while at
times dangerous for the teacher-researcher experiencing
depression or anxiety, nonetheless, are effective tools for
unleashing possible ties that bind both depression and anxi-
ety to original perceptions made within the community and
establishment of physical and psychological space.
Place
To say all research is a first-person narrative is not to say that
all research is about the heart. The heart pushes the self for-
ward to places it doesn't belong. I don't want to go to places
where the heart is not welcome. Such places frighten me.
"Are you frightened by the truth?" would come the rejoinder.
"No, I'm frightened by what poses as the truth" (Pelias,
2004, p. 8).
For a good part of my adult life, I have been navigating
through my world, mentally struggling at times to find my
emotional place of comfort. I struggle with life, fearfully
navigating through what others justify as truths about mental
illness and psychological spaces. I understand the need to eat
healthy and stay physically fit. I also understand the need to
stay mentally fit. What I would give to be mentally healthy is
in the subjective negotiation of "passages through social sys-
tems and structures" (Greene, 1978, p. 48), the crossing of
borders (Freire, 1984) in a hegemonic wilderness whereby
traditional empirical research of class and gender tends to
ignore such discussions that intersect historically with male
teacher illness narratives. Peggy McIntosh (1990) tells us
that race and sex are not the only advantaged systems at
work. "We need similarly to examine the daily experience of
having age advantage, or ethnic advantage, or physical abil-
ity, or advantage related to nationality, religion, or sexual
orientation" (para. 15).
For place to inform the act of inquiry it must be turned
inside out; in other words, its essence must be uncovered
and understood. The raw material of place must be brack-
eted in such a way that grants insight into the human con-
dition, historical movement, and/or anthropological
expression. Joe L. Kincheloe and William Pinar (1991)
extend Eudora Welty's insight by noting that the meaning-
making process sets into motion a "synergism" whereby
"rhythms of time and fleeting glimpses of the unconscious
are integrated with a knowledge and place to reveal hid-
den designs" where "not only place itself is exposed but
also the elusive conversation between place and curricu-
lum theory is audible" (p. 8).
Other writers and artists have also provided explanations
and renderings of the significance of place in research, the
demand for autobiography, and "working through" place as a
symptom of culture. Brian Casemore (2008) notes the under-
standings of art critic Lucy Lippard (1997), French historian
Pierre Nora (1989), and Professor Edward Casey (1993)
demonstrate severing lived and embodied relationships to
the past can make it difficult to find meaning in the present.
But as Lippard argues in Casemore, "The lure of the local
connects us to the past we have forgotten." What we are left
with then is the question of how one navigates through "the
aspects of ourselves and our relations to others that have
been obscured in our experience of place" (as stated in
Casemore, 2008, p. 9).
Mary Jacobus (1999) argues in "Psychoanalysis and the
Scene of Reading" that what readers do not see in fictional
landscapes can give them an "unconscious sense of relating
to an inner world" (p. 54, as stated in Casemore, 2008, p. 9).
Yet, she adds that these very same landscapes can provide a
medium in which the reader can work through personal and
historical trauma (Casemore, 2008, p. 9). Furthermore,
Mitchell (2002) sees place in terms of Jacque Lacan's theory
that "defines subjectivity as a place in language" that has no
"no real physical dimensions, but is the representation of a
place as mimeticized in the mind" (Zizek, 1989, p. 155, as
cited in Casemore, 2008, p. 10). Mitchell's psychological
framework is applied to place in the South through Lacan's
use of space, by relating his idea of space, place, and land-
scape to Lacan's idea of "The Symbolic, the Imaginary, and
the Real" (Mitchell, 2002, p. x). It is in the Lacanian idea of
"The Real" signifying a traumatic or historical event that
Mitchell argues is interwoven with the imaginary landscape,
and helps to expose our transference," in the psychological
sense of place.
Complications
It does not take a catastrophic event to lose oneself in a fic-
tional world. The symptoms of MDD and the application of
such psychoanalytical tools as critical reflection and self-
applied transportation theory complicated my awareness of
not only who I was, but also an awareness of where I was at
mentally and physically. Heller (2002) tells us of critical
reflection that,
Humpal 3
We can understand journaling as the self-in-the-moment
speaking of and to a past self, but with a future self in mind . . .
The self simultaneously contains the experiences of the past
along with the possibilities of the future sees this as the value of
going inward to find the proper direction. (as cited in Rossiter &
Clark, 2007, pp. 149-150)
Furthermore, self-applied transportation theory is a tool
for travel through song, film, television sitcom, art, medical
records, school records, and life history memorabilia, includ-
ing photos, art, texts, for symbolic interactions between the
object and self, then return to the present reality, whereby
one can be entertained or informed, or seek clarification
(Green, Brock, and Kaufman, 2004).
While geographically I have traveled hundreds of miles
from Iowa to Texas, to Colorado, and back to Texas, my use
of psychoanalytical tools in themselves did not hamper my
awareness of my "inner" place. The very symptoms of MDD
and the search for identity also threw off my compass. A few
of the most common symptoms of MDD are deep feelings of
sadness, marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities,
insomnia, increased fatigue, restlessness, feelings of worth-
lessness or inappropriate guilt, and difficulty thinking, con-
centrating, or making decisions. Neither thoughts of death
nor suicide entered my mind during the Major Depressive
Episode (MDE) I suffered during my study. In other words,
MDD can "color" or "inform" your perception of reality.
Quite often when I was not suffering from these symp-
toms, I asked myself, "Am I a middle-aged White male high
school English teacher stuck in a predominantly White rural
school district in Central Texas, culturally and psychologi-
cally isolated, yet historically connected to the people I was
studying?" During the study, I discovered instances of rac-
ism and prejudice that reminded me of my racist and verbally
abusive stepfather. One morning after the 2008 election of
Barack Obama, I found a tattered American flag lying in the
street outside of my home. It was my stepfather's death on
my birthday in 1998 that triggered my initial episode of
MDD and brought forth unanswered questions from my past,
and now in the current context of racism, I found compelled
to have answered in an eerily familiar landscape.
The following findings from my study show the difficul-
ties and lessons I experienced locating my place.
I love peacefulness of the mind generated by the absence of
human sound. That's why I would explore a 200 acre wood near
our house by myself many times. It didn't matter the season. In
fall, after raking the fallen burnt orange brown maple leaves into
a pile at the bottom of a hill and then jumping into it, or after a
strong mid-January snowstorm smelling air you swear God
created just for you while skating down your small frozen ravine
. . . Later I would come to find out that is ozone . . . Or spring
watching the different colored finches, and squirrels . . . And
there I was. So when we would take a long trip to our cabin in
Northern Minnesota through Bemidji (Paul Bunyon country) to
Woman Lake, all I did was absorb my surroundings . . . wasn't
sure why, maybe the virgin images were calming. (Author,
personal correspondence, November 5, 2011)
Every time I hear Pearl Jam's "Small Town," as it is nicknamed,
I am reminded of why I dislike living in such communities. It
reminds me of my faded days growing up in a small Northwestern
Iowa town that mammoths the rural speck I now live in by a
12-fold population. But it is not so much its size, or population
that is reminiscent. It is who the population consists of . . .
mostly White, mostly church-going, mostly blue collar, spare
the stench from meat-packing plants filling the air. I didn't want
to be stuck in my childhood town working construction the rest
of my life only to be visited years later by old friends. I wanted
to get the hell out. Only now I am in nearly the same spot I was
back when I graduated from college in 1984. I never looked
back when I left in a December snowstorm in my orange 1968
VW Beetle with an Iranian American student via Colorado
Springs before heading to my television reporting job in South
Texas. Now it is 2012, PhD in sight, job hunting in sight, and
now another possible escape from a small town in White
America where everyone knows my name, but who does not
want to say hello because I am not from here. (Author, personal
correspondence, April 9, 2011)
Big Falls is the type of community that is prejudice against
outsiders more than the color of your skin. If your family was a
part of the community you were granted more access to than
someone that moved into the community. There were times
prejudice was reflected due to the color of your skin. African
Americans that grew up in Big Falls knew their place. As long as
(African Americans) were participating and doing well in
athletics, things were fine. Our parents only came to the school
if there was a problem or maybe to see us play. They did not
"rock" the boat and neither did their parents. (Author, personal
raw data, June 2012)
Big Falls reminds me of my Iowa heritage. I am a
52-year-old male of German, Bohemian, and French decent.
Whites alone account for about 93% of the population,
while Hispanic or Latino accounts for about 4% and African
Americans about 3%. People of German ancestry represent
the largest portion of the Iowa population. My grandfather's
great grandfather left the far southern village of Mettenburg,
Germany, around 1840 and moved to a small Irish settle-
ment in Minnesota. Grandma's great grandparents were
from France. Both families were strong Catholics and had
little wealth.
In Texas, the Czechs apparently brought with them the
ancient friction between Protestants and Catholics, which
deterred efforts for Czech national unity. Czechs were not
only Catholic, some were Protestant, Presbyterian, Moravian,
yet shared similar interests in agriculture and celebrated
Czech customs, but they did not share "a common goal for
building a unified Czech community" (Apperson, 1969,
p. 43). It was Presbyterians and Moravians who were more
inclined to associate with the American Protestants than the
Czech Catholics with American Catholics. Furthermore,
4 SAGE Open
Presbyterians with Calvinistic Reform theology were more
inclined to communicate with mainstream American reli-
gious groups than did the pietistic Moravians. Thus, it was
the Czech Presbyterians who served as leaders toAmericanize
the Czechs.
Czechs and Germans apparently displayed common cour-
tesies between each other, although the immigrant-majority
Catholics "were admonished to stay away from Protestants"
(Karlik, 1972, p. 60).
Struggle between, Czech, German, and Anglo-American
cultures increased markedly in the 1920s and erupted into
manifestations against each other. "Name calling, fights, and
prohibitive use of languages other than English in schools
was common" (p. 62). The discord between the two ethnic
groups was said to have contributed to the appearance of the
Ku Klux Klan in Texas and a local Klan group was formed in
Big Falls. It was Protestant in sympathy and "professed a
program against crime and corrupt officials" (Karlik, 1972,
p. 84).
A group of over 200 Klansmen were allowed, despite requests
against it, a short parade through the business district in January
1923. Apperson, Karlik, and the town paper claimed, based on
"informed sources," that most of the Klansmen were not from
Big Falls. These three sources reported that most of the
Klansmen were from outside of the community and the number
was far less than expected. But today one can find the remains of
the local Klan's old meeting place next to a bird sanctuary about
two miles from the Knights of Columbus Hall. After the parade,
an anti-Catholic movement was fought with almost equal
passion by a small group of Czech Catholics. The resulting
friction between the two cultures destroyed much of the unity
established during the war. Catholic Czechs began to feel
unaccepted because they were of foreign birth or parentage. The
conflict helped to renew their isolation. (Karlik, 1972, p. 84)
Depression's Impact on Perception
As the historical pattern of racism and prejudice began to
emerge, my agnosticism and my increasing sense of isolation
magnified my anxiety and depression. The following emails
were hastily sent to my superintendent, assistant superinten-
dent, principal, and assistant principal during what seemed a
euphoric sense of what turned out to be a false sense of real-
ity. The emails note further conflicts with issues of trust.
During this time, I was in a sense reaching out to even people
in the hegemonic circle, needing to talk. However, my
depression and anxiety may have colored my view of reality,
on one hand distorting the public view of depression in a way
that people would accept it, particularly my bosses, and on
the other, masking the confidentiality of my research of this
very community that they were vaguely aware of.
Teachers face anxieties and fears every day in the classroom . . .
society does not care, administration does not care, kids do not
care . . . I have learned how to manage major depression
throughout my life . . . look where I am at . . . I was ranked 150th
out of 220 in my class . . . yet today, I am a successful teacher
and role model . . . I propose a short motivational performance
presentation for teachers who suffer the same fears in the school
community and high school I do.
Thanks so much for the advice, especially about keeping it
simple. I am just going to focus on my life as an English teacher
here. Throwing in too many expectations beyond what I can
reasonably handle while I am still teaching. The classroom and
the kids are still my responsibility, and my responsibilities will
not change wherever I go. (Author, personal correspondence,
June 18, 2011)
While struggling with distrust, isolation, and loneliness,
welcoming and creative realizations were emerging from my
perceptions that would soon assure my return, the realization
that dominant cultures perpetuate prejudice, and the realiza-
tion of inner healing transpires through such journeys:
The story, "A Lesson Before Dying" mentioned divorce, but in
Earnest Gaines's sense it was a separating of our physical selves.
If we do divorce (separate) you take your role and responsibilities
with you. But while you are with these kids, you show them how
to form their own view of the world and frame themselves. A
person's time is short on this earth, at least physically. It is
teacher's mission, my mission to serve as a facilitator of method
and tools of knowledge building so they can construct their own
lens. I have to remember that, hate begets hate, even if I don't
agree, we need to talk about ways of bridging gaps together
through knowledge we call experience. (P. Slattery, personal
correspondence, June 10, 2011)
One bitter, but again, healing realization about society and
myself was that of hypocrisy, both of a private and public
nature. The following journal entries further support the
hypocrisy of Big Falls desire for self-sufficiency and isola-
tion and my conflicting desire for peace and belongingness
while criticizing their desire as negative:
This struggle is one of my realities . . . not being able to show my
empathy, or gratitude to others at times of depression. So, if I am
a role model as a teacher, a person who has impact, and I do not
do anything about my lack of assertiveness to enact change on
their behalf, I feel like a coward. (Author, personal
correspondence, June 11, 2011)
It's hard to find a spot without humans . . . and that seems to be
my story. I like being alone. Not all the time. Just during My
time. People see me and ask, "Is everything all right?" I say,
"Yes." But really it's not. I am melancholy. It seems I always
have been. I used to smile a lot. Not anymore. (Author personal
correspondence, June 11, 2011)
The ability to realize how depression and anxiety can both
color and inform one's current struggle for meaning-making
came down to one question: If I could run through the
Humpal 5
predawn streets of Big Falls at 5 a.m. without incident, where
is the danger? The euphoria I felt from a 24-min, 2-mile run
through the streets of Big Falls began seeping through my
soul . . . So I ran the next day, and the next day, until by sum-
mer's end I was running four early-morning jaunts through
what was once scary territory. I began to feel safer, and to a
large degree at peace with what I was experiencing. Some
people would say I lived an existential experience, others
might say it was just runner's high. Yet all I remember is that
"feeling" you get when you feel this was not your doing . . .
something or someone was at work in the greater scope of
things.
In my psychological space, my depression revealed per-
sonal prejudices, current and past, of race and religion. My
perceptions during this time also reveal my hypocritical
nature, criticizing people of religious faith while speaking of
religious tolerance. This impacts how I have viewed the sub-
jects of this community. However, this also gives me greater
understanding of how religion has played out through history
in terms of the negative consequences of prejudice such as
isolation.
Considering the amount of research I conducted about
MDD and anxiety through numerous sources, I am not sur-
prised that my journal entries and personal correspondence
written during my relapse revealed I was fighting against
hegemony. I was fighting against hegemony in terms of treat-
ment of my mental illness through medications against local
community powerbrokers, school district officials, princi-
pals, and parents of students with power who I could have
actually have benefitted from. But this sensitivity informed
me to be wary and critical of small, rural high school com-
munity members. It also reaffirmed my desire to move on to
a place I felt was home.
Value for Others
This morning, I cut the remains of a 15-foot branch from a
100-year-old pecan tree now lying before me. The drought of
2011 sucked it dry, cutting off a constant source of life . . .
and as the pecans formed and matured, the weight of the nuts
plus a windstorm was all it took to down it atop the hard
concrete patio. Someone told me one time that divorce is
worse than death. I am not sure I necessarily agree, because
I have experienced divorce twice, and the deaths of my
mother, father, stepfather, and others, as well as my own
death experience. The tree that had provided my family with
a healthy nut in the late fall and a protective shade in the hot
Texas summer was beginning to realize its once metaphori-
cal winter. Death, divorce . . . they do share one thing in
common, and that is the overriding sense of physical loss of
the living. I could extend those losses to include experiences
that keep us at least psychologically connected to physical
beings by memory.
I noticed other pecan trees heading for their downfall as
well. The trees in my neighbor's yard, the Catholic church's
community center across the street, the trees planted at the
former high school built in the early 1900s, and some of the
hundreds of trees scattered in the more than 100 square miles
of the Big Falls Independent School District. I paused and
thought of the great pines of Northern Minnesota and blazing
ashes of the Rocky Mountains near my parent's tombstone,
and the very fallen branches my mom would climb while
motorcycling through the sparse Iowa woods.
The trees served as my mother's messenger, and my pro-
tector of most things I have come to know as a White male. I
admired her fearlessness, fortitude, respect, empathy, and
love for nature and mankind. Through her, and later my step-
father (yes the White Irish bigot), I acquired growing respect
for women. It was not uncommon for us siblings to put on the
boxing gloves and settle a fight with the rest of the family
laughing through the picture window. But later, as a teen, my
stepfather warned us that if we ever picked a fight with a
woman, we would not see the light of day. I still have great
respect for my older sister Patty who can still lay me down
with a good punch.
More than that, as a married man, I watch with care and
understanding how my wife, two daughters, and female stu-
dents who have navigated a male-dominated world sometimes
with success, and other times with defeat. But with my moth-
er's guidance, I am learning the impact such marks can make
in the physical aspect of one's place and the psychological. As
a White male educator in a predominantly White rural high
school community, introducing curriculum that focuses on
race, ethnicity, class, gender, and mental ability, can be risky.
It was not that I felt I was the next "great White hope." I actu-
ally felt like a White, Northern carpetbagger having difficulty
selling his goods in a predominantly White, rural southern
community, not feeling any need to necessarily redeem myself
(Remillard, 2011) or write a conversion narrative commonly
found among Southern Whites (Hobson, 1999).
More so, my narrative speaks to the underlying ecological
underpinnings of autopoetic narratives (Denzin, 1997) that
exposes a Peliasian (2004) "empathetic connection, [and] a
body that takes as its charge to be fully human" (p. 1) in our
personal and professional lives. I would research the com-
munity again, and I will still promote pedagogical action
with possibilities that ignite educative experience-making in
these communities (Washington & Humphries, 2011).
Despite rejection by some students from, and who were
assimilated into the White rural Southern high school men-
tality, others expressed their gratitude.
I cannot concur more strongly with Pinar's view that
some Northerners wrongly tout a moral superiority when it
comes to a discussion of racism in the South. Little do
Midwesterners remember their ancestral treatment of Native
American tribes during the early history of the plains, and the
disparaging of African Americans seeking economic refuge
and freedom up the mighty Mississippi River after the Civil
War, only to find themselves embroiled in an economic battle
stirred by White farmers and businessmen.
6 SAGE Open
In keeping with memories and thought structures, I chan-
nel my mother's muse by nurturing those very places I share
with my wife, my children, my students, my neighbors, and
everyone else. Within those spaces, places, or landscapes
(Greene, 1978), it is now time to ask ourselves, "How will
we navigate through such a complex world that is at times
impatient, harmful, intolerant, disrespectful, inconsiderate,
and self-centered towards nature and others, yet also seeks
patience, tolerance, respect, protection and empathy for
nature and others?" It is time we call on our own muse to
guide efforts toward a physical and psychological reconcep-
tualization of the educative place we call the high school.
With our muse at our side, we will be guided from an educa-
tively inclusive place to expanded spaces, not just new spaces
within the high school, but also spaces venturing into the
land that first brought our ancestors yearning for the toler-
ance, respect, and physical and mental well-being they once
sought.
My call beckons classroom research that Henry Giroux
(1992) says transcends borders, and in what Geneva Gay
(2011) calls "affective, humanistic, and transformative"
ways (p. 39), by helping teachers and students explore new
landscapes of learning, and making individual choices and
relativity within the global community (Greene, 1978).
Slattery (2006) accentuates the perpetuated problems sur-
rounding attitudes in open discussion of issues involving gen-
der, sexuality, race, and ethnicity, while further defending the
need for postmodern curriculum developers to, "aggressively
and consistently include lessons and experiences that will
ameliorate the divisions and hatred we face in the world today"
(p. 144). In the spirit of John Dewey (1916/1944), Maxine
Greene (1978), Giroux (1985), James A. Banks (2004), and
Gay (2011), this call is a call for urgent restructuring of the
high school as we know it, not only in the curriculum, the
objectives, and the physical architecture, but also in continued
research supporting endeavors advocating cultural and aca-
demic equality among all students. As such, I ask other
researchers to join with me in reigniting further research into
1. The restructuring of schools and other educational
institutions that accommodate student-centered
learning of the community spaces they inhabit,
including further student control in curricular deci-
sions that consider their inner psychological spaces
and awareness of physical surroundings impacting
their sense of well-being, interpretation of their place
in the community, local environment, and within a
multicultural world that transcends our comfort
zones, and
2. The inclusion of community members, such as archi-
tects, artists, doctors, counselors, scientists, and spiri-
tual leaders working with schools in nurturing an
interactive communal atmosphere that invites stu-
dents and educators out of the classroom and into the
local environment.
The lack of educators equipped to address these problems
has added to, "the frustration, anger, and violence that
threaten to destroy civilization" (Slattery, 2006, p. 186). The
practices of "irrelevant or inadequate" (Slattery, 2006,
p. 188) local school district philosophy and mission state-
ments can perpetuate divisions between philosophers and
educators in curriculum development and theory, "unless we
see philosophy of education as a vehicle for engendering jus-
tice, compassion, self-exploration, empowerment, critical
thinking, and ecological sustainability" (p. 198). As Levin
(2009) notes, "Educators can't for a moment be complacent
about our place in public's hearts and minds--consequently
in their wallets" (p. 94).
Aside from calls for further research, there is a need for
continued emphasis on student, educator, and community
involvement in school redesign, curriculum delivery, and
school climate. Inherent in reconceptualized high schools in
the design should be facilities that provide spaces for physi-
cal and artistic expression that allow for a greater sense of
well-being. Pilar Marin and Brett Brown (2008) argue that
beyond the academic development of students, school envi-
ronment also encompasses "student physical and mental
health, safety, civic engagement, and social development"
(p. 1). As such, they suggest that school policy and activities
should be viewed through the larger context. Schools have to
affect student physical, mental, and nutritional help through
teaching health classes, changing school lunch menus, physi-
cal education classes and sports activities, programs address-
ing mental health issues of bullying, drug abuse, and stress,
and mandated medical services.
Further reconceptualization entails a curriculum that
allows opportunity for students to interact with their environ-
ment. Aside from student field trips, community and envi-
ronment-based student projects can be offered which would
allow student interaction with community members, experi-
ential knowledge-building (Dewey, 1916/1944; Pinar, 2004;
Slattery 2006) and historical, autobiographical understand-
ings of their environment (Pinar & Grumet, 1976; Slattery,
2006). Furthermore, as Spears et al. (1990) discuss in Oliver
and Howley (1992), multiculturalism "can only be made
sense of when rural schools make sense of them in their own
circumstances" when "rural students can understand other
cultures best when they understand their own culture well"
(para. 9).
Walls are only reserved for utility rooms, offices, and
gyms, while instructional areas utilize an open plan with
both large and small subareas. Reconceptualized high school
communities could further provide greater access for expres-
sive spaces through expanded offerings of art, music, and
physical activities not normally available to students due to
course requirements and schedules.
Some design experts and schools are taking the lead in
discussions that include the involvement of students and
community in school redesign efforts. The Chicago
Architecture Foundation and its "DiscoverDesign" Internet
Humpal 7
tool for high school students teaches school design and con-
struction, and also provides a forum for input from other stu-
dents, teachers, and design professionals (Discover Design,
2011). Also, The School Planning Section of the North
Carolina Department of Public Instruction assists school dis-
tricts, architects, and designers in its state in the planning and
design of high-quality school designs. Other websites, such
as web Urbanist, also provide coverage of educational, and
creative works of culture from around the world that recently
displayed 15 "cool high school, college and university build-
ing designs" such as the Austrian-designed Modern High
School in central Los Angeles, and Orestad High School in
Copenhagen.
Reconceptualized high schools could also cultivate stu-
dent and educator opportunity for spiritual and emotional
development within their environments (Slattery, 2006,
p. 71). Becoming more prevalent are schools based on such
ideas of Buddhist leader Daisaku Ikeda's curriculum of Soka,
or value-creating, education. The value-creating focuses on
"cultivating individuals capacity to create values of gain,
good, and beauty" and also "the spirit to foster individuals
who create wisdom, courage, compassion, and other human
virtues through dialogue, global citizenship, and human edu-
cation" (Goulah & Takao, 2012, p. 60).
Just as "Christianity cannot be separated from Paulo
Freire's educational philosophy" (p. 60), they add Buddhism
is inherently tied to Ikeda's educational philosophy. But it's
clear religious doctrine is not taught in any class. In addition,
Goulah and Takao Ikeda assert schools promulgate human-
ism, spirituality, totally and virtues of wisdom, courage and
compassion because "they will enable students to enjoy per-
sonal growth and contribute to society" (p. 61).While separa-
tion of religion from schools is necessary, an atmosphere that
does not hinder student choice in development of their spiri-
tual well-being should be a cornerstone of our efforts. As
such, Slattery (2006) argues "we must find an appropriate
way to teach theology, textual hermeneutics, cultural diver-
sity, and critical analysis without cross the line of separate
between religion and government" (p. 77).
The thoughts of such reconceptualizations, whether in the
dreams of a 52-year-old White male high school teacher in the
South or in any other teacher's memory will just remain inside,
unless researchers, educators, and other community members
actively pursue such ventures with their muses as their guide.
I know all too well the value of a tree.
