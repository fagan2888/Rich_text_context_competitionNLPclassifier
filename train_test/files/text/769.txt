Are the Childless More Vulnerable?

Objectives. This study tests whether childlessness is significantly related to greater loneliness or depression among
older adults, both alone and in conjunction with marital status.
Methods. Using data from the 1988 National Survey of Families and Households, the relative circumstances of
community-dwelling, permanently childless adults and biological parents (with at least one surviving child), 50-84
years old, are compared. Multivariate models are used to test the effects of parental status and combined marital-
parental statuses on loneliness and depression, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics.
Results. Results of multivariate analyses show no significant, direct effect of childlessness, though a marginally
significant effect appears for women. However, small but significant differences are observed within a typology com-
bining marital and parental statuses. Widowed men and women report higher levels of loneliness and depression than
married parents regardless of parental status. Divorced parents are also significantly more vulnerable. The subjective
well-being of never married, childless men and women is indistinguishable from that of their married peers.
Discussion. The results confirm earlier studies, indicating that childlessness is not necessarily linked with dimin-
ished subjective well-being among older adults. However, marital status represents an important context within which
to understand and evaluate the experience of parental status.
GERONTOLOGICAL research has consistently docu-
mented the importance of family, especially adult
children, in providing social and instrumental support for
older persons. Although the help and companionship pro-
vided by other relatives and non-kin have been recognized,
how well they can substitute for close kin is less clear
(Cantor, 1979; Johnson & Catalano, 1981; Keith, 1986).
Within this context, childless elders have been identified as
a potentially vulnerable subgroup. Childlessness is associ-
ated with significantly higher risks of social isolation and
institutionalization (Bachrach, 1980; Freedman, 1996;
Johnson & Catalano, 1981), but there is little consistent ev-
idence that childlessness diminishes subjective well-being.
Much of the research on subjective well-being among
childless elders, however, dates back to the early 1980s and
does not reflect the changes in cohort composition and life
experiences among adults currently entering old age (see
Goldscheider, 1990; Preston, 1992).
The present analyses build on prior research by providing
a more current, nationally representative portrait of the rela-
tive status of permanently childless persons and those who
have surviving, biogical children. Using data from the Na-
tional Survey of Families and Households (NSFH), this arti-
cle tests whether childlessness has a negative impact on sub-
jective well-being, specifically on loneliness and depression,
and tests for effects of parental status that may be conditional
on other characteristics that increase vulnerability in old age.
Childlessness and Subjective Well-Being in Old Age
Dramatic social changes in this century have increased
the diversity of family forms and personal histories among
older adults. Compared to earlier cohorts, a higher propor-
tion of people enter old age with few or no children and
with fewer siblings within their families (Bengtson, Rosen-
thai, & Burton, 1990). In 1990, more than one fifth of per-
sons older than age 65 were childless (Himes, 1992). The
proportion childless was highest among the oldest cohorts,
who were young adults during the Great Depression (nearly
22%), and lowest during the baby boom (8.8% for women
born in the mid-1930s; Chen & Morgan, 1991). The im-
plications of childlessness for these cohorts have been
shaped by changing social norms that have defined the
salience of parental status over the life course. Strong
pronatalist norms, emphasizing the centrality of family and
procreation, have been pervasive in the United States
(Blake, 1972; Veroff, Douvan, & Kulka, 1981), and al-
though acceptance of childlessness has increased, most
Americans associate childlessness with greater loneliness
in old age (Blake, 1979).
Why are childless elderly persons assumed to be at a dis-
advantage? Scholars have traditionally used the availability
of kin as an objective measure of social resources. Elders
with more family ties have been defined as more socially
integrated and therefore protected against loneliness and
depression, whereas those with few or no kin ties have
been identified as vulnerable (see Antonucci, 1990; Bengt-
son et al., 1990). Recent work has criticized this structural
approach for ignoring non-kin networks and for focusing
on the quantity of ties but ignoring relationship quality
(Antonucci, 1990; Dykstra, 1990; Rook, 1984; Umberson,
S303
S304 KOROPECKYJ-COX
Chen, House, Hopkins, & Slaten, 1996). However, because
family structure can be readily measured and projected for
current and future cohorts, kin availability remains the most
useful predictor of trends in social resources on the popula-
tion level (Himes, 1992; Preston, 1992). Therefore, it is
critical to test regularly whether childless elders indeed dif-
fer from parents on a variety of measures, both objective
and subjective.
For Americans in general, the equation of childlessness
with a lonely old age reflects deeply held beliefs regarding
the value of children and the importance of family. Despite
greater acceptance of childlessness since the 1960s, there
has been no evidence of a rush away from parenthood
(Blake, 1979; Thornton, 1989; Veroff et al., 1981); as Blake
has stated, "there are still... cogent reasons for parenthood
that are uniquely inherent in the role of children as social
investments" (Blake, 1979, p. 247). The reported benefits
of having a child include the attainment and experience of
parent status, affirmation and emotional support in old age,
and a sense of "immortality" through the transmission of
genes and values (Blake, 1979). The intensity and norma-
tive expectations of the parent-child relationship are re-
flected in the high involvement of adult children, especially
daughters, in caring for aging parents (Brody, 1990; Rossi
& Rossi, 1990) and in the particularly intensive and on-
going assistance that they are often uniquely equipped to
provide (Litwak, 1985).
Childless elders tend to be significantly worse off on ob-
jective measures of social isolation, such as living alone,
having few face-to-face contacts (Bachrach, 1980; Kivett &
Learner, 1980), and not having an available caregiver
(Soldo, Wolf, & Agree, 1990). On the other hand, surveys
consistently report no differences between the childless and
parents on subjective measures of well-being such as happi-
ness, life satisfaction, and loneliness (Glenn & McLanahan,
1981; Rempel, 1985). As several researchers have argued,
the lack of a consistent negative effect suggests that unmar-
ried and childless elders obtain needed emotional and instru-
mental support from their relationships with other kin,
friends, and neighbors (Cantor, 1979; Dykstra, 1990). Other
scholars have further questioned the assumption that adult
children are necessarily positive resources, demonstrating
that stressful or distant relations can be detrimental to well-
being (Connidis & McMullin, 1993; Rook, 1984; Umberson
et al., 1996). The absence of adult children, therefore, would
not necessarily predict greater vulnerability in old age.
Besides social resource availability, however, regrets
about childlessness may also influence well-being in old
age. Alexander and colleagues (1992) have noted that older
women reevaluate their childless status at various stages of
their lives and have suggested that negative feelings about
childlessness may surface or increase with old age. Social
norms that have marginalized childless women in particular
may trigger feelings of regret or diminished well-being (see
also Veevers, 1980). In addition, research on infertility has
documented the distress of couples coping with involuntary
childlessness (Miall, 1986), and a few studies have indi-
cated that a negative effect on subjective well-being may per-
sist (or reemerge) in later life (Beckman & Houser, 1982;
Connidis & McMullin, 1993).
Loneliness, Depression, and Parental Status
The present research focuses on two measures of subjec-
tive well-being: loneliness, an indicator of perceived social
isolation, and depression, a measure of psychological dis-
tress. Loneliness is chosen because fears of loneliness in
old age and especially among the childless appear to be
widespread and persistent among the general public (Blake,
1979; Harris & Associates, 1974, 1981; Houser, Berkman,
& Beckman, 1984). Depressive symptoms represent a more
serious form of psychological distress that diminishes well-
being and may disrupt normal function. Loneliness has
been defined as an unpleasant feeling of dissatisfaction with
either the number or quality of existing social relationships
(see deJong-Gierveld, 1987; Perlman & Peplau, 1981).
Several studies based on data from the late 1970s have re-
ported no significant association between loneliness and
childlessness in later life (Keith, 1983a; Kivett & Learner,
1980; Rempel, 1985). The link between depression and
childlessness has received less attention in the geronto-
logical literature and has shown mixed results. Beckman
and Houser's (1982) study of older widowed and married
women found no differences between childless women and
mothers. Connidis and McMullin (1993) reported that
women who described themselves as childless by circum-
stance had significantly higher levels of depression than the
childless by choice and mothers. No studies have tested dif-
ferences in either loneliness or depression by parental status
using representative U.S. data collected since 1980, and
findings from earlier studies are limited in their generaliz-
ability and their methods.
This article examines loneliness and depression as sepa-
rate indicators of subjective well-being that represent con-
ceptually different domains. Depression is a measure of
psychological distress with clinical implications, whereas
loneliness is an unpleasant feeling that diminishes well-
being but is not generally defined as a psychological disor-
der. As Peplau and Perlman note, "depression is a much
broader phenomenon than loneliness; people can be de-
pressed for a variety of reasons; hence depressed people are
not invariably lonely" (1982, p. 10). However, I acknowl-
edge that these indicators are closely related and are
difficult to fully separate in practice or in measurement.
Loneliness may be a precursor to more serious depressive
symptoms. In turn, depressed affect interferes with social
interaction, further exacerbating both the objective and sub-
jective dimensions of social isolation (see Cohen, 1990).
High levels of loneliness have been linked to higher risks of
mental illness and suicide (Peplau & Perlman, 1982; Weiss,
1973). High levels of depression are significantly related
to poorer health and greater morbidity as well as higher
risks of institutionalization, suicide, and overall mortality
(Roberts & Vernon, 1983).
I also acknowledge that the availability of children and
parental status can influence loneliness and depression in
various ways, but the current research does not attempt to
model these pathways. Instead, the purpose of this research
is to test whether there is such an effect in a representative
sample and to identify subgroups for whom childlessness
may have a more detrimental impact. However, to the ex-
tent that relationship quality, proximity of adult children,
CHILDLESSNESS AND WELL-BEING IN OLD AGE S305
and personal expectations modify the effects of parenthood,
failure to include indicators will bias estimates of the ef-
fects of childlessness in a conservative direction.
Research Questions and Hypotheses
In order to focus on the importance of adult children as
an enduring and central source of social support, childless-
ness is defined here as never having had any biological or
adoptive children. These permanently childless adults are
compared to their peers who are biological parents with at
least one surviving child. Because of the inherent, norma-
tive ambiguity and diversity in the experience of steppar-
enthood (see Cherlin & Furstenberg, 1994), the existence or
absence of stepchildren is not considered in this article.
The present analyses begin by testing the basic questions:
Does childlessness influence loneliness and depression in
older adults? Is there an effect after other social factors such
as marital status and living alone are controlled? The analy-
ses are then extended by examining the varying effects of
childlessness among particular subgroups of older adults.
First, how are the patterns of effects different for men and
women? Second, do the effects of childlessness vary de-
pending on marital status? The data collected in the NSFH
provide the basis for an updated portrait of the role of family
history in shaping subjective well-being in later life.
Drawing on previous research, childlessness is not ex-
pected to be directly linked with subjective well-being.
However, parental status is expected to have an impact for
certain subgroups as outlined below.
Gender.--Gender socialization and expectations empha-
size parental status as more salient for women throughout
their lives. Social norms have defined women's adult iden-
tities, social value, and development around the norma-
tively prescribed role of mother, whereas men are generally
evaluated in their roles and accomplishments outside the
family (see Blake, 1972; Fisher, 1991). Women report feel-
ing stigmatized because of their childlessness (Miall, 1986;
Veevers, 1980), and questions about social value and fe-
male identity persist beyond menopause into old age (Alex-
ander et al., 1992; Fisher, 1991). In addition, research has
documented the greater closeness of mother-child relations
and the greater importance of parenthood for women com-
pared to men (Scott & Alwin, 1989; Simon, 1992). There-
fore, to the extent that childlessness may adversely affect
loneliness and depression, such an effect is expected for
women but not for men.
Marital history and current marital status.--Marital his-
tory plays an important role in shaping fertility experience
over the life course. Societal proscriptions against nonmari-
tal childbearing have linked the prospects for parenthood
with the commencement and timing of marriage. In turn,
the expectations, experiences, and evaluations of the child-
less status are defined in the context of the marital history.
Some studies have suggested that childlessness may be
more salient for elders who were formerly married (Beck-
man & Houser, 1982; Johnson & Catalano, 1981), yet inter-
actions between marital and parental status have not been
tested using nationally representative data. The present
analyses compare the levels of reported loneliness and de-
pression among subgroups of older persons who are defined
by marital and parental status.
Because the emotional and instrumental support avail-
able within marriage generally provides for the needs of
married elders, childlessness is not expected to influence
subjective well-being (see Keith, 1983b). For those who are
widowed, on the other hand, the availability of adult chil-
dren may represent a substitute for lost spousal support
(Beckman & Houser, 1982; Dykstra, 1993; Johnson &
Catalano, 1981). Johnson and Catalano (1981) have noted
that childless married couples form intense dyads that are
often isolated from other social ties; these childless elders
are particularly vulnerable upon widowhood. A significant,
detrimental effect of childlessness is therefore expected
among widowed respondents.
For divorced older adults, on the other hand, children
may represent additional stresses in the divorce process, in-
cluding negotiations of financial support and contact, as
well as single parenthood for the custodial parent. For the
childless, the timing of divorce may contribute to the ab-
sence of children, and it may provide a long adjustment pe-
riod in which to establish a supportive social network.
Therefore, no adverse effect of childlessness is expected
among separated and divorced adults.
Finally, childlessness that is linked with never marrying is
not expected to be detrimental for women or men. The never
married may feel more detached from the idea of parent-
hood because it was contingent on an event that never oc-
curred, or their single status may be linked with a desire to
avoid conventional family expectations. In addition, because
never married, childless status is lifelong, the social net-
works of single elders would reflect long-term activity and
planning for contingencies, including old age and sickness.
METHODS
Data
The National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH)
provides uniquely rich data for studying the salience of
parental status among older adults. Whereas most surveys
of older adults have asked only a single, broad question
about the number of surviving children, the NSFH has col-
lected detailed information that distinguishes between bio-
logical and adopted children. The effects of childlessness,
therefore, can be tested using a precise definition of
parental status. Data were collected in 1987 and 1988
through face-to-face interviews and self-administered ques-
tionnaires completed by primary respondents (chosen ran-
domly from each household; see Sweet, Bumpass, & Call,
1988). This article is based on data from 3,820 respondents
between the ages of 50 and 84, of whom 579 (15.2%, un-
weighted) have never given birth or fathered a child (256
men and 323 women).
The group aged 50 to 84 consists of survivors of the co-
horts born between 1904 and 1938. The lower age limit is set
at 50 in order to restrict consideration to persons whose
childlessness is most likely a permanent status. Because the
sample includes only community-dwelling respondents, the
maximum age is set at 84 years to minimize selectivity bi-
S306 KOROPECKYJ-COX
ases related to institutionalization and to higher nonresponse
rates among the oldest old (see Herzog & Rodgers, 1988).
Table 1 summarizes the proportion of adults in each of
several demographic subgroups who remained permanently
childless. The proportion childless does not vary by sex or
race. The age pattern of childlessness for women reflects
national fertility levels for these cohorts (see Chen & Mor-
gan, 1991), whereas men's fertility levels are less varied.
Marital status shows an expected pattern that reflects social
norms and age distributions. Note that the small number of
never married parents, 20 women and 8 men, are excluded
in order to clarify the analyses of marital and parental status
differences. Men's work status differences also reflect the
high prevalence of childlessness among the very old.
A comparison of parents and biologically childless re-
spondents is summarized in Table 2. The patterns of educa-
tional attainment among women reflect the selectivity of
highly educated women into the childless life course (see
Veevers, 1980). Self-reported physical health does not vary
significantly by parental status and matches physical health
profiles reported in other national data for noninstitutional-
ized persons in this age range (see Taeuber, 1992). As ex-
pected, childless men and women are much more likely to
live alone compared to parents, although two-person house-
holds are most common in each group.
It should be noted that among the biologically childless,
49 women and 53 men have adopted children. However,
because adoptive parenthood is qualitatively different from
both complete childlessness and biological parenthood,
these respondents are not included in the analyses. Parents
with no surviving children (40 women and 8 men) are also
excluded. This study is based on the remaining subset of
2,372 women and 1,448 men.
Dependent Variables
Depression is measured using a modified version of the
Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale
(CES-D) which includes affective symptoms (e.g., lonely,
sad, depressed) as well as symptoms of disrupted or re-
tarded activity (e.g., poor appetite, problems concentrat-
ing). Respondents were asked in the self-administered
questionnaire how often in the last week they experienced
each of 12 depressive symptoms, on a scale from 0 to 7.
The total depression score is the sum of the 12 items and
ranges from 0 to 84. Although the CES-D has been devel-
oped primarily as "a measure of symptoms and moods
rather than of illness or disorder" (Ensel, 1986, p. 51), high
CES-D scores are highly predictive of clinical diagnoses of
depression (Ensel, 1986; Roberts & Vernon, 1983. For
more information on the CES-D, see Ensel, 1986, or
Radloff, 1977). Developed as a screening instrument for
use in population surveys, the CES-D has been used suc-
cessfully with older populations (see Bojrab et al., 1988).

CHILDLESSNESS AND WELL-BEING IN OLD AGE S307
Loneliness is measured in the NSFH using a single item
that asks, "How many days in the last week did you feel
lonely?" The scores range from 0 to 7. This question ap-
pears as part of the 12-item CES-D depression scale. The
loneliness score is highly correlated with the total CES-D
score (r = .75) and with the CES-D score excluding the
loneliness item (r = .69), but multivariate regression analy-
ses show that loneliness and CES-D scores have different
patterns of covariation with the independent variables of in-
terest in the current research. Therefore, results for loneli-
ness and depression are presented and discussed separately.
Other research has suggested that the individual items of
the CES-D vary in their response patterns among particular
subgroups of the population and warrant analyses of indi-
vidual items and factors as well as composite scores (see
Coyle & Rubege, 1992; Kessler, Foster, Webster, & House,
1992).
Several weaknesses of the loneliness measure are noted.
First, any single-item measure is limited in its variability
and range compared to multi-item scales. Second, the lone-
liness question is not designed for use as a single item, and
it is not clear how a single item within the context of a
larger depression scale is answered by respondents. Specifi-
cally, its placement in the scale may bias the responses:
rather than responding to the concept of loneliness per se,
people may be responding to the overall series of questions
on depression. Therefore, social desirability biases would
predict lower reported levels of loneliness because of an
unwillingness to admit depression. This bias is likely to un-
derestimate actual levels of loneliness in the population, but
it is not expected to bias comparisons between subgroups
of elderly men and women.
On the other hand, the face validity of single, direct
questions measuring loneliness has been verified, and com-
parisons of multiple measures of loneliness report high cor-
relations between single questions and other measures (see
Dugan & Kivett, 1994; deJong-Gierveld, 1987; Shute &
Howitt, 1990). Self-reported measures may underestimate
the prevalence of loneliness because of social desirability
biases, but several scholars (Perlman & Peplau, 1982;
Shute & Howitt, 1990) have noted that admitted loneliness
may be conceptually more meaningful than high scores on
indirect scaled measures (two major scales do not include
the words "lonely" or "loneliness"; see deJong-Gierveld,
1987; Russell, Peplau, & Cutrona, 1980). Again, I expect
that any biases in the findings will be in a conservative di-
rection and that lower admission of loneliness among older
persons and men will not affect intragroup comparisons.
Theoretical work on loneliness has distinguished an
emotional component of isolation, which pertains to a per-
ceived lack of intimacy, and a social component, which de-
scribes a feeling of exclusion or mafginality from social ties
(Andersson, 1986; Weiss, 1973; see also Stroebe, Stroebe,
Abakoumkin, & Schut, 1996). Recent research has sug-
gested that a direct, single-item measure of loneliness may
tap the emotional dimension of loneliness more than social
isolation (Dugan & Kivett, 1994). Arguably, the direct
question used here may tap either dimension (or both), but
both components of loneliness are likely to be linked to the
absence of adult children.
Previous research has identified a cutoff score for the
CES-D roughly corresponding to the highest 20th per-
centile of depression scores (Ensel, 1986), which is highly
predictive of clinical depression. A measure of high depres-
sion has been created to designate scores that fall in the
20th percentile (scores above 21 out of 84), and both the
continuous and dichotomous depression measures are ana-
lyzed (see Kessler et al., 1992).
Independent Variables
The main independent variable in these analyses is child-
lessness, a dichotomous variable indicating that the respon-
dent has never adopted, fathered, or given birth to a child.
Separate models are run for men and women. Marital status
is operationalized as a series of indicator variables--sepa-
rated or divorced (referred to hereafter as divorced), wid-
owed, and never married--with married as the reference
category. Health, age, race (White compared to non-White
as reference category), educational attainment, work status,
and living alone are also used as controls in the multivariate
models. Health is measured using a single, self-rated health
question, "Compared with other people your age, how
would you describe your health?" Scores range from 1 for
poor to 5 for excellent. Age is used as a continuous vari-
able. Educational attainment is coded as a series of indica-
tor variables for less than high school, some college, and
college degree or more, with completion of high school
used as the reference category. Work and residence status
are coded as dichotomous variables indicating whether the
person worked for pay or lived alone, respectively, at the
time of the survey.
Analytical Method
The multivariate analyses include the sociodemographic
variables--health, race, age, educational attainment, work
status, living arrangement, and marital status--as controls
in predicting the effect of childlessness on the outcome
measures. Ordinary least-squares regression is used to ana-
lyze the continuous scores of loneliness and depression,
whereas logistic regression is used to analyze the dichoto-
mous score of high depression.
RESULTS
Direct Effects of Childlessness
Results from bivariate analyses of loneliness and depres-
sion by parental status are reported in Table 3. Childless-
ness significantly increases loneliness and depression among
men, but no statistically significant differences are observed
among women. The bivariate relations observed for men
are no longer significant after controlling for living alone or
marital status. The results of OLS regressions predicting
loneliness and depression and logistic regressions predict-
ing the likelihood of high depression, presented in Table 4,
indicate that the effect of childlessness is positive but not
statistically significant in each model. However, the effects
of childlessness on women's loneliness and likelihood of
high depression approach significance (p = .086 and p =
.085, respectively). Among the other variables, poor health
is strongly related to greater loneliness and depression for

both men and women; the standardized coefficients for
health are by far largest among the independent variables in
the depression models (betas are -0.33 and -0.29 for
women and men, respectively) and are high in the models
of loneliness.
Widowed women report significantly more loneliness
and depression than married women, but their higher de-
pression is no longer significant when loneliness is re-
moved from the CES-D score (not shown). Both loneliness
and depression are significantly higher among divorced
women. A similar pattern is observed for men, with wid-
owed men reporting greater loneliness and depression and
divorced men reporting significantly greater loneliness.
Never married men and women are not significantly differ-
ent from the currently married. In logistic regression analy-
ses of the likelihood of reporting high depression, formerly
married men and women are significantly more likely to re-
port high depression.
Conditional Effects of Childlessness
Gender.--The interaction between childlessness and gen-
der is tested by including a multiplicative interaction term
in the OLS regression models and running them on the en-
tire sample. There is a significant, direct effect of gender,
with women reporting significantly higher levels of loneli-
ness and depression compared with men. However, neither
parental status nor the interaction between childlessness
and gender is statistically significant.
Marital status.--This study tested whether the effects of
childlessness are conditional on marital status by defining a
typology based on marital status and childlessness. For
each ever-married group, marital-parental status combina-
tions are defined by a series of indicator variables. These
six variables along with the never married status are added
to the multivariate models. Married parents serve as the ref-
erence category. Results from these models are presented in
Table 5. Divorced mothers are significantly more lonely
and depressed than married mothers. Divorced fathers are
significantly more lonely and more likely to be highly de-
pressed compared with married fathers. Among both men
and women, widowed persons are more lonely regardless
of parental status and their depression levels are generally
higher, compared with married parents. Never married,
childless men and women appear very similar to the cur-
rently married on both measures of well-being. Comparing
the coefficients within each gender-marital status subgroup,
however, I fail to reject the null hypothesis of no difference
between the parents and childless.
DISCUSSION
In sum, the results show that permanent childlessness
does not represent a statistically significant, universal dis-
advantage in terms of greater loneliness or depression for
either men or women, net of other factors. The absence of a
general parental status effect confirms my hypotheses and
agrees with earlier work. Parental status represents a back-
ground variable in studies of subjective well-being, and it is
expected to have very weak, if any, effects compared to the
perceptions and expectations of social relationships (de-
Jong-Gierveld, 1987). The current findings indicate that
persistent beliefs linking childlessness with diminished well-
being in later life are not supported empirically, at least not
for the population as a whole.
The absence of any strong, adverse effect of childless-
ness among women deserves attention. Pronatalist social
norms experienced by today's older cohorts have con-
strained women's choices and have marginalized childless
women, whereas men have largely been exempt from these
pressures. Alexander and colleagues (1992) have noted that
older women's regrets about their childlessness are inter-
woven with strong criticisms of the norms that have labeled
them as deviant and that have equated normative woman-
hood with motherhood. The current results suggest that the
pressures and stigma experienced by women may not have
strong, lasting consequences in later life.
A weak effect, however, is observed. In regression mod-
els predicting loneliness and the dichotomous measure of
high depression among women, the effects of childlessness
approach significance using the more conservative, two-
tailed criterion (p = .086 and p = .085, respectively). Social
norms would suggest a one-tailed alternative hypothesis, a
detrimental effect of childlessness on well-being. Using a
one-tailed test, therefore, the effects of childlessness are
statistically significant, indicating a weak but deleterious
effect for women.
For both men and women, widowhood is linked with sig-
nificantly greater loneliness and generally greater depres-
sion regardless of parental status. The absence of a signifi-
cant parental status effect among widowed adults is
somewhat surprising and counters the conclusions from
earlier studies (Beckman & Houser, 1982; Johnson & Cata-
lano, 1981). The loss of a spouse greatly diminishes subjec-
tive well-being among older adults, and the hypothesized
benefit of adult children as a buffer in easing a parent's be-
reavement and providing support is not observed.
On the other hand, among divorced older adults, a statis-

tically significant detrimental effect is observed only for
parents. This finding may reflect the family stresses associ-
ated with divorce as well as more distant relationships for
noncustodial parents. Within the context of divorce, the
obligations and ties between parents and their adult chil-
dren may be more ambiguous and strained (see Cooney &
Uhlenberg, 1990; Webster & Herzog, 1995).
It should be noted, however, that all of the coefficients
for the divorced and widowed groups are positive, although
not all are statistically significant. However, testing sepa-
rately within each gender-marital status group, no statisti-
cally significant differences are observed between the child-
less and parents (though this may in part reflect the loss of
statistical power with diminishing cell sizes). The larger co-
efficients among the childless in nearly every subgroup of
ever-married adults nonetheless suggest a pattern that mer-
its further research.
The absence of significant differences between never
married adults and their married peers suggests that I
must look beyond current, structural indicators such as
marital status and parental status to understand variations in
subjective well-being. Although a number of studies have
affirmed the positive benefits of marriage, especially for
men (see Waite, 1995), the relative well-being of never
married adults has received little attention. Never married
adults establish personal and social resources for maintain-
ing their well-being through an ongoing process of "antici-
patory socialization" (Johnson & Catalano, 1981), cultivat-

ing social networks in advance to prepare for future exigen-
cies (see Dykstra, 1990; Rubinstein, Alexander, Goodman,
& Luborsky, 1991). The results underscore the importance
of marital history in defining the salience of parental status;
the negative findings reported in earlier research and in
the direct-effect models may reflect offsetting influences
among the different marital status groups.
It should be noted that different definitions of childless-
ness produce different results. Preliminary analyses (not
shown) indicate significantly higher loneliness and depres-
sion among women who are biologically childless, adoptive
parents. On the other hand, the effects of being biologically
childless with stepchildren or of having survived one's bio-
logical children are not statistically significant. Although
they lie beyond the current focus on enduring, normatively
defined parent-child ties, these findings nonetheless raise
serious questions about surveys that do not differentiate
between biological, adoptive, and stepchildren. The in-
creasing complexity of the familial life course argues for
greater attention to the distinctions between biological and

social parenting in future studies of middle-aged and older
populations.
One shortcoming of this study is the exclusion of the in-
stitutionalized and extreme aged from the sample. Because
lack of social supports is a major determinant of institution-
alization for frail, elderly persons, excluding them may pro-
duce an overly positive picture of childlessness in late life.
Institutionalization may have removed from the sample the
most lonely, depressed, and vulnerable childless elders,
leaving a subset of community-dwelling elders with better
social supports or stronger adaptive capacities (see Johnson
& Catalano, 1981). Excluding elders over the age of 85 fur-
ther eliminates a group for whom loneliness and depression
in the face of declines in health and function would be
more prevalent and more devastating.
This study provides a basic, structural description of dif-
ferential vulnerability in later life in a nationally representa-
tive sample, but further replication is needed. The next step
for informing scholarship and practice is to identify the
mechanisms and pathways through which parental status
produces different consequences depending on marital sta-
tus and history. Further research by the author has begun to
identify important evaluative factors which condition the
experience of parental status--the role of attitudes in condi-
tioning the effects of childlessness and of parent-child rela-
tionship quality in shaping the effects of parenthood. Future
research should also examine the relative contributions of
social resource deficits, changes in social norms (especially
for women), and qualitative differences in the experience of
childlessness or parenthood.
