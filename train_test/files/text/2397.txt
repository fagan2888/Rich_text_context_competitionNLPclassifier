GIVEN considerations such as increased longevity and rap-
idly aging populations in the United States and abroad,
efforts to understand mechanisms of successful aging are re-
ceiving increased attention. Research in this area has identified
some apparent predictors of physical, cognitive, and emotional
health in later life, which include both genetic and environmen-
tal influences. Because environments represent all nongenetic
effects, environmental, and quasi-environmental, influences
can be conceptualized broadly to encompass protective/risk
factors and behavioral patterns in which individuals engage.
For instance, they can easily be conceptualized as "purely" en-
vironmental influences, such as literal environments (eg, lead
exposure). They can also be more complex influences that re-
flect environmental exposures (eg, a lifetime of smoking) that
may arise partly from genetic influences (eg, genes predispos-
ing an individual to develop nicotine dependence). Using this
definition, environmental influences affect a wide array of
successful aging constructs (ie, constructs associated with
improved longevity as well as higher quality of life as individu-
als age). Environmental influences range from the biological

Background. Outcomes in aging and health research, such as longevity, can be conceptualized as reflecting both
genetic and environmental (nongenetic) effects. Parsing genetic and environmental influences can be challenging,
particularly when taking a life span perspective, but an understanding of how genetic variants and environments relate
to successful aging is critical to public health and intervention efforts.
Methods. We review the literature, and survey promising methods, to understand this interplay. We also propose the
investigation of personality as a nexus connecting genetics, environments, and health outcomes.
Results. Personality traits may reflect psychological mechanisms by which underlying etiologic (genetic and environ-
mental) effects predispose individuals to broad propensities to engage in (un)healthy patterns of behavior across the life
span. In terms of methodology, traditional behavior genetic approaches have been used profitably to understand how
genetic factors and environments relate to health and personality in somewhat separate literatures; we discuss how other
behavior genetic approaches can help connect these literatures and provide new insights.
Conclusions. Co-twin control designs can be employed to help determine causality via a closer approximation of the ideal-
ized counterfactual design. Gene-by-environment interaction (G × E) designs can be employed to understand how individual
difference characteristics, such as personality, might moderate genetic and environmental influences on successful aging out-
comes. Application of such methods can clarify the interplay of genes, environments, personality, and successful aging.

(eg, longevity) to the psychological (eg, optimism, resilience)
to the social (eg, social integration) (1).
Untangling the complex direct causal effects of, and inter-
actions among, genetic and environmental influences will be
critical to public health efforts to promote successful aging in
the coming years. For instance, although social integration
may show positive associations with aspects of successful
aging, interventions to improve quality of life by strength-
ening social ties might fail if these associations reflected
reverse causation (eg, continued good health is the cause of
increased social integration, as opposed to functioning in
the opposite direction) or the presence of a third variable
with broad impacts, such as underlying genetic factors. The
purpose of the current report is to outline the beginnings of
a framework to unravel the complex genetic and environ-
mental influences on successful aging. This framework inte-
grates individual differences in personality as a potential
explanatory mechanism and highlights newer behavior
genetic methods that can lead to stronger causal inferences
due to their novel design features. The wide variability in
many outcomes of successful aging suggests numerous
opportunities to apply such models toward understanding
the sources of this variation.
Genetics and Successful Aging
We will begin our discussion of the relative contributions of
genetic factors and environments to successful aging by focus-
ing on the direct effects of genetic factors. It is self-evident that
genetic factors relate to human development; just as genes
provide the informational framework to build each human
embryo, their impacts continue to be felt throughout the life
span. Although molecular genetic approaches are now being
applied to questions of successful aging--for instance, which
genetic variants might be related to the development of demen-
tia of theAlzheimer's type--the majority of our current under-
standing about the role of genetics in later life has come from
behavior genetic studies of twins. In their classic formulations,
behavior genetic studies parse variation in an observed pheno-
type (eg, a trait) into causal components--most typically (i)
additive genetic effects (referred to as "A"), (ii) shared environ-
mental effects ("C") that are common within a family, such as
the neighborhood in which the twins were raised together, and
that act to create greater phenotypic similarity within pairs than
would be predicted solely from genetic similarity, and (iii) non-
shared environmental effects ("E") that are unique to each
family member and that serve to make individuals different,
including, eg, stochastic effects (2). Behavior genetic methods,
for example, provide estimates of heritability, which is the pro-
portion of phenotypic variance due to genetic effects.
This classic approach has yielded important findings about
the relative importance of genetic factors for successful
aging. For instance, the heritability of longevity has been
estimated to be around 25% or greater and to be stable
across birth cohorts (3­5).
Environments and Successful Aging
In accepting a broad definition of "environment"--one that
includes all nongenetic sources of variance--we accept a
wide variety of possible influences on successful aging. If, for
example, 50% of subjective well-being variation were shown
to be due to nonshared environmental effects in behavior
genetic analyses, the next logical direction would be to ascer-
tain precisely which constructs accounted for this effect. On
one hand, we would include literal environmental settings,
such as the impact of continuing to live independently in one's
own home versus moving to an assisted living community. On
the other hand, given our definition, we would include less
commonly conceived types of environmental influences as
well. These include environmental exposures, such as expo-
sure to health-related behaviors (eg, smoking, exercise), indi-
vidual differences, social interactions, and so on. Such
environmental exposures are not purely environmental in most
cases; they are likely most accurately conceptualized as being
partially environmental exposures because they are also reflec-
tions of genetic influence in many cases. For instance, if an
individual chooses to expose himself to exercise, this might
reflect a genetically influenced predisposition to being ener-
getic and personality traits that might predispose an individual
to exercise. Alternatively, if an individual were, say, randomly
drafted into the military and was thus exposed to regular phys-
ical exercise, this would be a purely environmental manifesta-
tion of the same variable. This highlights the relative rarity of
identifying a construct that is purely genetically, or environ-
mentally, driven, and any discussion of such "environmental"
exposures should be understood as possibly reflecting down-
stream genetic influences as well. Finally, in behavior genetic
analyses, the nonshared environmental variance component
typically also includes psychometric error.
Numerous factors that have environmental aspects to
them have been linked to successful aging. A recent review
has established such behavioral factors as caloric restriction
and physical activity, and intervention-based environmental
exposures such as cognitive interventions, stress reduction,
and social programs, as being associated with cognitive,
emotional, and physical health in older adults (1). Of course,
health risk behaviors, such as smoking, have also been
related to health throughout the life span (6). Constructs
such as socioeconomic status--which, in childhood, is a
commonly used example of shared environmental effects
between twins--are also linked to healthy aging (7).
Personality
Like discrete health behaviors, environmental settings, and
genetic factors, personality traits have been associated with
important outcomes related to successful aging. For instance,
personality traits prospectively predict longevity, divorce, and
occupational attainment--and they do so as well as cognitive
ability (eg, IQ) and socioeconomic status (8). Personality trait
models typically include multiple distinct trait domains.
EATON ET AL.
482
Examination of these individual domains and the facets sub-
sumed therein has yielded associations with successful aging
variables. For instance, the domain of conscientiousness--a
key higher-order domain in Big Five models of personality--
and some of its facets (eg, responsibility, self-control, tradition-
alism) are consistent predictors of longevity (eg, an effect size
of r = -.09 of conscientiousness for mortality, indicating a
protective effect; [9,10]). Another trait domain, neuroticism/
negative affectivity/internalizing, has been shown to account
for the observed comorbidity of many forms of mental disorder
at different points across the life span (11). Although beyond
the scope of the present chapter, some extreme and maladap-
tive personality features (12), known clinically as personality
disorders, are, by definition, associated with dysfunction and
occur throughout the life span, including very late life (13).
Behavior genetic research has consistently demonstrated
that individual differences in single-assessment, self-report
personality traits, on average, are due approximately 50% to
additive genetic effects and 50% to nonshared environmen-
tal effects (14); when incorporating multi-rater data and
thus assessing personality traits more fully than self-report,
genetic factors account for around two-thirds of domain-
and facet-level variance (15). However, this literature is
typically quite separate from the behavior genetic literature
on successful aging and on environmental contributions
thereto. Because genetic factors, personality, health-related
behaviors, and successful aging appear so closely inter-
twined, this lack of integration is notable. In the following
sections, we lay out some features of a conceptual model of
how personality can be used to capture this interplay and
how behavior genetic methods can be used to understand
the complex etiologic underpinnings of successful aging.
Health Behaviors as Patterns
Studies focusing on health-related behaviors frequently
examine how a particular health-related behavior, such as
caloric intake or regularity of physical activity, relates to
constructs associated with successful aging, such as longevity,
subjective well-being, or physical health. This approach has
yielded a somewhat piecemeal understanding of the impact
of particular behaviors on aging. Numerous seemingly dis-
parate factors are associated with successful aging, such as
eating nuts, using sunscreen, and owning a car (16).A different
approach--one that focuses on broad longstanding patterns
of behavior across the life span rather than discrete behaviors--
may be a profitable and complementary angle from which
to investigate how behaviors are associated with successful
aging. For instance, it is probably not solely the frequency
of physical exercise in later life that relates to health. Rather,
it seems likely that this relation reflects a broad propensity
to adopt a healthy lifestyle, in which exercise is but one
aspect of an overall approach to living. Other behaviors
linked to this propensity perhaps include a combination of
high physical energy, focus on physical health, enjoyment
of being active versus sedentary, interest in stimulation
versus inactivity (eg, watching television), and so on. Studies
of physical exercise tap into this propensity, but they fail to
capture its breadth and may thereby attenuate its associations
with successful aging. The broad propensity is akin to studying
general cognitive ability (g)--which is a broad construct satu-
rating a variety of performance measures--by assessing only
mathematics. On the outcome side, this approach is similar to
conceptualizing successful aging solely as one aspect of this
broader construct (eg, longevity).
The Role of Personality in Health Patterns
If we accept that specific health behaviors are reflections
of broad, underlying propensities to engage in generally
stable patterns of related, but distinct, health behaviors, the
question becomes how to conceptualize these constructs for
further study. We propose that investigations of personality
may represent an important first step. The use of personality
as a means of framing these health-related behavioral pat-
terns is sensible, given that personality traits confer broad
predispositions to behave in a given way within a group of
related behaviors. For instance, the trait of extraversion
relates to characteristics such as outgoingness, sociability,
self-confidence, sensation seeking, energy, and positive
emotionality. Clearly, personality traits such as extraversion
encompass a broad set of behaviors; although each of these
behaviors might relate to successful aging if examined
separately, a better understanding of their impacts would
require an understanding that they are all manifestations of
the same psychological core. By incorporating information
about the domain-level trait of extraversion with informa-
tion about the specific characteristics (facets) it subsumes,
researchers can elaborate a model of personality-liked health
behaviors that shows both generality and specificity.
To illustrate this point, let us consider a particular personal-
ity trait as relating to patterns of specific health-related behav-
iors. Bogg and Roberts (9) meta-analytically examined trait
conscientiousness in tandem with tobacco, drug, and excessive
alcohol use; diet and activity patterns; violence, risky sexual,
and driving behaviors; and suicide. Results indicated that trait
conscientiousness related positively to all beneficial health-
related behaviors and negatively to all risky health-related
behaviors, thus highlighting how trait conscientiousness can be
used to unify our understanding of these superficially different
behaviors in a systematic patterned way.
Personality traits are also relatively stable over time, particu-
larly in adulthood (17,18). This is not to say that personality
traits are immutable or "set like plaster" as previously thought;
indeed, there are patterns of within-individual and between-
age cohort mean differences across the life span (19). How-
ever, the general rank-order stability of personality traits
provides a critical strength for studies of successful aging,
which typically take a longitudinal developmental approach.
Given recall biases and memory lapses, we can never know
GENES, PERSONALITY, AND AGING 483
precisely how an individual was in the past by retrospective
reporting. Because personality traits show a notable degree of
developmental stability, they provide a rough estimate for how
individuals have been--and behaved--throughout their life
span. In this way, personality traits might be conceptualized as
providing a reasonable basis upon which inferences about
lifelong health-related behavioral patterns can be drawn.
This being said, personality traits can change substantially,
even in later life, but this does not change the overarching mes-
sage. To wit, the factors that concern health and aging investi-
gators may be significantly impacted by latent individual
differences constructs that have been excluded from most
health research. These latent constructs, including personality
traits, likely influence health outcomes, and they do so whether
they change across the life span or not. It should also be noted
that personality is likely reciprocally influenced by some health
outcomes, such as health restrictions being associated with
apparent personality changes (eg, decreased mobility
resulting in fewer opportunities for, and less interest in, risk
taking or sensation seeking).
Integrative Frameworks
Although researchers have demonstrated associations of
successful aging and health variables with genetic factors,
environmental influences, and personality, these findings
have been reported in largely separate literature and remain
relatively unsynthesized. The full promise of these separate
lines of inquiry likely lies in developing an integrative
framework in which the effects of genetics, environmental
influences, and personality can be considered simultaneously.
We believe that particular behavior genetic approaches can
provide a means by which these ends can be realized. As
such, we now turn our attention to two methods that hold
notable promise for gerontological studies: co-twin control
designs and gene-by-environment (G × E) investigations.
Co-twin Control Analysis
The first behavior genetic method we will discuss is
the co-twin control design. Traditional behavior genetic
approaches parse variance in a phenotype (or set of phe-
notypes) of interest into genetic, shared, and nonshared
environmental components. This can be helpful for ascer-
taining the heritability of a phenotype and determining
where, for instance, research and intervention efforts should
be directed. For instance, a phenotype with a very high
heritability--say, 80%--would suggest that the phenotype
arises primarily from genetic influences (eg, stature is an
example of this type of highly heritable phenotype, [20]).
The picture here is complicated in a sense because, although
various phenotypes may differ in the degree to which their
variance is heritable, all human phenotypes are mediated
through genes. In other words, environmental exposures,
such as carcinogen exposure in the workplace, will interact
with the genetically driven biological substrates within each
individual, and thus gene-environment interplay will account
for whether an individual develops cancer.
The co-twin control design yields different information than
these traditional approaches. Rather than parsing phenotypic
variance in a single phenotype into its etiologic components,
co-twin control analyses support causal inferences about the
relations between specific constructs and aging outcomes of
interest. The illustration of causation is a contested and com-
plex issue in general (21). Drawing strong causal inferences is
even more problematic for gerontological research because the
causal inference gold standard--the randomized controlled
experiment--can rarely be conducted given the constructs
of interest, the life-span perspective, potential selection effects,
and other confounding factors. To understand better the
strengths of the co-twin control design for causal inference, we
must first discuss the counterfactual briefly.
In simplified experimental terms, we can think of the
counterfactual as being the result of a given individual
receiving and not receiving the experimental treatment.
(For an excellent discussion of the counterfactual and
co-twin control designs, see McGue and colleagues [22]). If
a researcher is interested in the impact of a cognitive inter-
vention (treatment) versus no intervention (control) for a
successful aging outcome like memory performance, what
she would like to know is how her sample of N individuals
would react if they received the treatment compared with if
they had received the control. In other words, she seeks a
difference score for each individual (di) between his or her
memory performance after receiving the treatment ( T
i
Y ) and
after receiving the control ( C
i
Y ), which can be represented
as 
i
T C
i i
Y Y
= - (22,23). However, this counterfactual
approach--where one knows the outcome of simultaneously
exposing, and not exposing, each individual to both treat-
ment and control--is not feasible. Instead, the researcher
relies on a randomized experiment. Because she cannot
assign each individual to both conditions simultaneously,
she will instead assign individuals to the treatment or con-
trol group. By use of random assignment and a reasonable
sample size, she hopes that individual differences will cancel
each other out and the groups will differ meaningfully only
with regard to treatment condition. As such, she is attempt-
ing to approximate the idealized counterfactual model.
Nonexperimental designs, and particularly the observational
and quasi-experimental designs used in much gerontology
research, typically approximate the idealized counterfactual
model less well than randomized experiments; however,
close attention to observational study design can mitigate
some of these issues (23). (In some instances, due to factors
such as selection effects, it may indeed even be the case that
broad observational studies can provide better estimates
of causality than potentially biased experimental designs;
[22]). One study design that can approximate the idealized
counterfactual model is co-twin control, wherein twins who
are discordant for a given X (ie, a treatment, exposure,
behavior, individual difference, etc.) are compared on an

outcome of interestY. The use of twins reared together to com-
pare the impact of one potential cause on the outcome capital-
izes on the understanding that monozygotic (identical, MZ)
twins have in common 100% of their segregating DNA and
100% of their shared rearing environments. Dizygotic (frater-
nal, DZ) twins, on the other hand, have in common, on aver-
age, only 50% of their segregating DNA in addition to 100% of
their shared rearing environments. Neither MZ nor DZ twins
have any nonshared environmental effects in common because,
by definition, these effects are unique to each twin.
The understanding that MZ and DZ co-twins have different
profiles of genetic, shared environmental, and nonshared
environmental overlap, formulated in quantitative terms,
allows for co-twin control behavior genetic modeling and
bolsters causal inferences (22). For example, if one can iden-
tify identical twins who differ, within pairs, on exposure to
a risk environment and those twins differ in a corresponding
way on an outcome, this suggests, but does not definitively
demonstrate, that the risk exposure is causal. The risk-outcome
association in this case would likely not be a function of, for
example, the same genetic variation causing both the risk
exposure and the outcome because these MZ twins share
100% of their segregating DNA. Thus, the co-twin control
design can be particularly helpful for testing and rejecting
some causal hypotheses. The design is comparatively less
strong in rejecting third variable explanations (eg, third
variable X causes the investigated risk exposure as well as
the outcome, giving the appearance of a direct exposure-
outcome link that is instead mediated through the third
variable X; third variable X causes the one twin to be
exposed while the other is not, and thus the measured
risk variable might not actually be in the causal chain of
exposure-outcome events). One limitation of the co-twin
control design--particularly for studies of aging--relates to
potentially varying ages of onset of disorders within twin
pairs, which may give the appearance of true discordance
while actually representing only a temporary discordance.
Co-twin control studies can be conducted with different
levels of analytical sophistication. For instance, some
co-twin control studies take a relatively straightforward
approach: they approximate the idealized counterfactual by
comparing outcome measures of MZ twins who are discor-
dant for a potential causal factor. Although we cannot assess
individual i after he or she has been exposed to a potential
causal factor and after not having been exposed to the factor,
we can treat a pair of MZ twins as being highly similar
individuals who are nearly perfectly matched on many
potential confounders (eg, gender, age, childhood environ-
ment, genetic code, etc.). Now, if Twin1 has engaged in, say,
regular physical exercise, whereas Twin2 has not, our compar-
ison of these two highly similar individuals on an outcome
(subjective well-being) will help clarify the role regular physi-
cal exercise plays with regard to subjective well-being (24).
Basic co-twin control designs of this nature are not perfect
analogs of the counterfactual, of course, and they do not
definitively demonstrate causation in and of themselves; how-
ever, these designs do approximate the comparison of the same
person after exposure and nonexposure to a potential causal
influence in a closer way than individual-level analysis (22).
Given its analytic and inferential strengths, the co-twin con-
trol design is being increasingly applied to gerontological
questions. Historically, co-twin control designs were applied to
the evaluation of interventions by giving one MZ twin the
treatment while leaving the other as a control, which is a more
efficient design than the standardized case­control random-
ized-controlled trial (25). This method is equally applicable to
nonexperimental observational designs as well, making it a
particularly promising approach to test hypotheses in aging
research. Co-twin control designs of this nature require little in
the way of analytic complexity and several registries of mid- to
later-life twins exist (eg, the Midlife in the United States sam-
ple and the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins).
Discussion of a nongerontological co-twin control study
of this nature would be informative for the purposes of illus-
tration. One excellent application of this sort of co-twin
control was done to examine the potentially causal relations
between childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and later develop-
ment of psychopathology (26). By examining a population-
based sample of 1,411 female adult twins (MZ and DZ
analyzed as a group), the researchers brought to bear the
power of basic co-twin control designs to test hypotheses.
After they established a link between CSA and later
psychopathology, the researchers were able to infer whether
this link was causal by examining co-twins discordant for
CSA. It is possible, for instance, that some characteristic of
the individual (eg, a personality-related third variable
confounder) would predispose her to CSA and indepen-
dently to psychopathology. Because twins (and particularly
MZ twins) are likely to share this characteristic with their
co-twins, within each pair of twins, there should be a rela-
tively low association between CSA and psychopathology;
the third variable hypothesis here would suggest that, since
the twins have similar levels of the characteristic, they
should both develop psychopathology regardless of whether
or not they experienced CSA. The authors did not find this
pattern; rather, their results showed clear links between
CSA status and psychopathology within discordant twin
pairs, with the abused twin significantly more frequently ex-
periencing psychopathology. This bolsters the inference that
CSA causes psychopathology. In this way, a relatively basic
comparison of twins--and particularly those discordant on a
potential influence of interest--can rule out confounding fac-
tors and provide support for causal links. Causal inferences
are further strengthened by study design factors and the
nature of the research question. For instance, the temporal
sequencing of the variables in this study (26)--onset of psy-
chopathology temporally followed CSA--bolstered the in-
ference that CSA's link to psychopathology was causal.
More complex co-twin control designs are available, and
these designs can be even more informative. By examining
GENES, PERSONALITY, AND AGING 485
outcome association is not causal but is due entirely to some
mix of both genetic and/or shared environmental effects,
one would expect RWI to be large while RMZ and RDZ
would similarly be near zero because the influence-outcome
association would be seen only at the individual level
(27,28). Importantly, Figure 1 is intended to be heuristic, as
opposed to involving precise point values corresponding
with the exact heights of the lines in the figure. For exam-
ple, the "within MZ pair" bar in scenario B is not precisely
zero as drawn, and hence, there may be a partial causal
effect if those bars corresponded with precise numerical
values along the y-axis. In actual empirical application of
these approaches, formal quantitative models can be fit that
yield precise quantitative statements of the degree to which
the data fit with the different kind of scenarios portrayed
heuristically in the Figure (eg, McArdle and Prescott [29]).
This sort of co-twin control design is increasingly being
applied in gerontological research, given its ability to parse out
cause and effect (30,31).A recent review of the co-twin control
studies in successful aging research highlights this method's
versatility (22). Co-twin control designs--often examining
discordant MZ and DZ twins grouped together--have tested
the impacts of potential influences on outcomes, such as phys-
ical exercise and job complexity on dementia; physical activity,
smoking, and heavy alcohol use on mortality; social class on
cognitive performance; physical exercise on life satisfaction;
and so on. Some of these studies have suggested causation
by exposure to a potential influence, whereas others have
suggested genetic and/or environmental confounding.
Given the wealth of constructs of interest--both as
potential influences and important outcomes for successful
aging--these studies represent only a preliminary step
toward a comprehensive developmental model of success-
ful aging in later life. How can we best proceed to test the
myriad possible combinations of influences and outcomes,
particularly given that it is likely patterns of behavior over
the life span rather than short-term exposures, that will have
the strongest impacts on successful aging? Again, we sug-
gest the unifying role of personality. It seems likely that the
analysis of twins discordant for personality traits, which
have broad impacts on a range of behaviors and other influ-
ences, would clarify influence-outcome relationships and
provide researchers with useful constructs for further study.
For instance, analyses of twins discordant for the personality
trait disinhibition might show associations with successful
aging. Researchers could then examine particular aspects of
disinhibition (eg, medication noncompliance, risk taking,
alcohol and substance use, etc.) likely to be associated with
different types of health outcomes.
Gene-by-Environment Analysis
Traditional behavior genetic methods assume that the
effects of genetics, shared environments, and nonshared
environments are relatively set at a given level. For instance,
Figure 1. Possible co-twin control result patterns. Scenario A suggests a causal
link between influence and outcome. Scenario B suggests a genetic third variable
may account for the influence-outcome association. Scenario C suggests a shared
environmental third variable may account for the influence-outcome association.
Scenario D suggests genetic and shared environmental third variables may account
for the influence-outcome association. These scenarios are intended to be heuristic
sketches of possible observations, as opposed to involving model-derived precise
point values corresponding with the exact heights of the lines in the figure.
within- and between-pair associations between the potential
influence and the outcome, separately in MZ and DZ twins,
a researcher can statistically estimate the outcome level of
an affected twin had he not been affected and vice versa
(27). Perhaps more importantly, these approaches also can
test causal hypotheses about the association between a
potentially causal influence and an outcome rather clearly.
Like traditional behavior genetic analyses, the co-twin con-
trol design relies on what we know about the differences
and similarities between MZ and DZ twins in terms of
shared genes, shared rearing environments, and unique
environments, as discussed above.
Co-twin control analyses estimate the magnitude of the
relationship between influence and outcome within individ-
uals in the general population (RWI), within discordant
MZ twin pairs (RMZ), and within discordant DZ twin pairs
(RDZ). Four possible resulting scenarios for comparing the
magnitudes of these relationships are shown in Figure 1.
Scenario A: If the influence is truly causal (ie, exposure to
the influence directly contributes liability to the outcome),
then RWI, RMZ, and RDZ will be equivalent--regardless of
one's genetic and shared environmental status, exposure to
the influence increases the risk for the outcome. Scenario B:
If the influence-outcome association is not causal but is due
to a genetic third variable that causes both the influence and
outcome, one would expect RWI to be large, RDZ to be
smaller, and RMZ to be smaller still. Scenario C: If the
influence-outcome association is not causal but is due to a
third variable residing in shared family environment (eg, child-
hood socioeconomic status conferring risk to CSA as well
as psychopathology) causing both influence and outcome,
one would expect RWI to be large and RMZ and RDZ to be
equivalently lower. This is because both MZ and DZ twins
experience the same shared rearing family environments,
and, regardless of whether or not they were exposed to the
influence, their shared environment predisposes them equally
to the outcome. Scenario D: Finally, if the influence-

an approximate 50% heritability for a phenotype (a common
finding) is interpreted as 50% of the trait's variation across
individuals is due to additive genetic factors; we emphasize
that it is not, and should not be interpreted as, that 50% of the
"cause" of a disorder in an individual is due to genetic influ-
ences. Indeed, heritability is a population statistic that tells us
about the variation of a phenotype among people not about
an individual person. However, some compelling behavior
genetic models also have the power to get closer to influences
on individuals within the population, by examining interac-
tions between genetic factors and environments. In other
words, the impact of genetic factors (or environments) might
be moderated by some other variable--perhaps heritability of
a phenotype differs as a function of another construct. While
such interactions have long been considered theoretically,
recent statistical advances (32) have made examining them
more empirically tractable, and it has become clear that the
effects of genetic factors are not static as once believed. We
now turn our attention to these models, focusing on what is
commonly referred to as gene-by-environment (G × E) analy-
ses (albeit these techniques rely on genetic variation discerned
from family data, as opposed to specific measured genetic
polymorphisms). While other methods of investigating the
associations between genetic factors and environments exist
(eg, the gene­environment correlation), we believe G × E will
provide a particularly important tool for gerontological re-
searchers. For information on other models, see Johnson (33).
The mathematics behind gene­environment interactions
is complex and beyond the scope of the present report, but
both algebraic derivations and theoretical descriptions have
been reported elsewhere for interested readers (32­34). For
our purposes, it is sufficient to think about gene by environ-
ment analyses as being conceptually analogous to interac-
tions in multiple regressions, and we will discuss these
methods by example rather than design. To use an example
of relevance to successful aging, we will review a study of
the genetic and environmental contributions to two indica-
tors of physical health (number of chronic illnesses and body
mass index; [35]). Although one can think of an aspect of
physical health as having a set level of heritability, it is perhaps
optimal to think of this level of heritability as representing the
mean genetic influence on physical health when the effect of
all other influences are removed. For instance, the authors
noted that, while physical health has been shown to have a
genetic component in previous studies, there is also a robust
association between income level and physical health, such
that individuals with higher incomes tend to have better physi-
cal health. Clearly, genetic factors and environments both
potentially play a role in physical health outcomes.
There are several ways to reconcile the genetic- and
income-related findings regarding physical health--among
the most statistically elegant is the analysis of G × E interac-
tion. Rather than assuming that genetic and environmental
contributions were steady across the full range of income,
we (35) tested whether these contributions might differ
as a function of income. Indeed, this was the case. When
individuals earned 1 SD above the income mean, the genetic
variance associated with number of chronic illnesses (after
controlling for insurance coverage and education) was .33;
for individuals 1 SD below the mean, the associated genetic
variance was 1.7 times greater (.55). Similar results were
reported for body mass index. These trends, which became
even more pronounced toward the tails of income distribu-
tion, indicated that the impact of genetic factors on physical
health was moderated by income. At low levels of income,
genetic effects are associated strongly with physical health;
at high levels of income, variance in physical health is due
much less to genetic effects. Why? One hypothesis is that
genetic factors provide a diathesis for health problems, and,
at lower income levels, individuals face higher levels of
stress (eg, financial, physical stress due to manual labor, etc.)
that can activate this diathesis. Importantly, modern methods
can also model gene­environment correlations in the same
framework as gene­environment interactions, and examina-
tion of these correlations can also enrich our understanding.
For example, in an extension of our first study on income and
health (36), higher gene­environment correlations were
observed between income and the personality characteristic
of sense of control, in relatively higher income environments.
This may reflect a tendency for similar (eg, personality and
ability) tendencies to affect both an individual's perception of
control and that individual's income level.
Physical health variables aside, how could G × E analyses
be meaningfully applied to research on successful aging?
Again, we return our focus to personality and the supposi-
tion that personality traits represent reasonable proxies for
relatively stable lifelong patterns of behaviors of interest to
gerontologists. By examining broadband constructs such as
personality traits, gerontology researchers can (i) ascertain
the genetic and environmental contributions to personality,
(ii) determine how these contributions are moderated by
relevant environmental variables, and (iii) test the effects of
potentially worthwhile environmental variables as they
relate to successful aging. Questions of this sort have already
begun to be addressed. For instance, one study examined
G × E with regard to the origins of higher-order personality
domains of positive emotionality (a tendency to view life as
pleasurable; including facets of achievement, social close-
ness, social potency, and well-being), negative emotionality
(a tendency to experience psychological distress, akin to
neuroticism; including facets of aggression, alienation, and
stress reactivity), and constraint (a tendency to act cautiously
and endorse traditional beliefs; including facets of control,
harm avoidance, and traditionalism; [34]). Clearly, these
domains are broad constructs, and they comprise theoreti-
cally interesting and important facets related to successful
aging (eg, well-being, social factors, risk avoidance, etc.).
Although it had previously been established that the vari-
ance of personality traits such as these is due approximately
50% to additive genetic effects and 50% to nonshared

do not. In addition, the merging of traditional tools (such as
the twin study) with novel biological technologies (eg, the
ability to study epigenetic variation at the genomic level) is
likely to provide novel insights about the mechanisms
underlying individual differences in aging outcomes (38).

environments in single self-report assessments, the authors
questioned whether the origins of these traits might differ
somewhat based on parent­child relationships during youth.
When using two measures of the parent­child relationship--
parental regard and parental conflict--as moderators of the
variance components of personality traits, the effects of
genetic factors and environments were altered. For instance,
as depicted in Figure 2, genetic factors accounted for 35%
of the variance in positive emotionality when parental
regard for their children was 2 SDs below the mean; at the
mean of parental regard, genetic factors accounted for 52%
of the variance in positive emotionality; at 2 SDs above the
mean, genetic factors accounted for 76% of the variance in
positive emotionality. This finding appears to indicate that
increasing levels of parental regard provide a stable "canvas"
upon which genetic factors can demonstrate their predis-
posing effects. The directionality of these links can alter-
natively be reversed, highlighting how personality can
moderate the genetic and environmental etiologies of the
parent­child relationship. Indeed, a separate study taking
this perspective demonstrated that the genetic and environ-
mental influences on parent­child relationship variables were
significantly moderated by the child's personality traits,
suggesting that the child's personality also had an evocative
impact on the quality of the parent­child relationship (37).
Summary
Studies of successful aging must move beyond traditional
frameworks and apply sophisticated methods to understand
causality and etiology. Behavior genetic approaches such as
co-twin control and G × E analysis can provide a framework
for such analyses. Further, refinement of constructs, beyond
specific influences, to relatively stable, lifelong constructs
that can pervade multiple aspects of life and account for
longstanding patterns of behavior, may be of particular
importance. We believe personality traits are worthwhile
constructs for study toward these ends. The integration of
personality traits with novel analytic methods may provide
compelling findings, and help frame new hypotheses, about
how and why some individuals age successfully, while others
