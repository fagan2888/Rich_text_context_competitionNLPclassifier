Consistent with prior work, our hypothesis was that older African Americans are less likely to report dysphoria than
are older Whites. Study subjects were 968 participants aged 60 years and older in Baltimore, Maryland, and 1,486
participants aged 60 years and older in the Durham-Piedmont region of North Carolina who identified themselves
as African American or White and who had complete data on symptoms of depression active in the one month prior
to interview, as well as several covariates thought to be related to depression. The effect of self-reported race on the
endorsement of symptoms from the section on Major Depression in the Diagnostic Interview Schedule was esti-
mated employing structural equations with a measurement model. Older African Americans were less likely to re-
port dysphoria than older Whites, although this only achieved statistical significance by conventional standards at
the Durham-Piedmont site. Older African Americans at both sites were significantly more likely to report thoughts
of death.
ENDORSEMENT of the symptoms of depression, in
contrast to a preoccupation with syndromes (Costello,
1992), has not received a great deal of attention in the liter-
ature on ethnic differences in depression. For this reason,
the extent to which differential reporting of symptoms
might account for observed differences in diagnosis of
depression and other mental disturbances across ethnic
groups is not well studied. Despite concerns regarding
comparative studies of African Americans and Whites
(Jackson, 1989; Neighbors & Jackson, 1996), there is a
compelling need to understand "cultural differences in the
expression and classification of psychiatric symptoms"
(Neighbors & Lumpkin, 1990).
The results of studies that have compared the diagnoses
given to White and African American patients support the
notion that depressive illness is relatively underdiagnosed
among African American patients (Adebimpe, 1981; Jones
& Gray, 1986; Worthington, 1992). Prevalence estimates
from the National Institute of Mental Health Epidemiologic
Catchment Area (ECA) Program were consistent with lower
prevalence of depression among African Americans (Robins
& Regier, 1991; Somervell, Leaf, Weissman, Blazer, &
Bruce, 1989), although the differential in rates of depres-
sion were not as pronounced as in other studies (e.g., Ver-
non & Roberts, 1982, and in studies reviewed by Neighbors
and colleagues [Neighbors, Jackson, Campbell, & Williams,
1989]). Clinical investigators have noted the tendency to di-
agnose African American patients with schizophrenia or
schizoaffective disorder rather than depression (Jones &
Gray, 1986). Recognition of depression among African
Americans in primary care and other health care settings
may be hampered by an emphasis on somatic concerns
(Adebimpe, 1981; Broadhead & Garrison, 1991; Brown &
Schulberg, 1996).
Studies of differing symptom presentations are few.
Raskin and colleagues found few differences in symptoms
when comparing symptoms of 159 African American inpa-
tients and 555 White inpatients (Raskin, Crook, & Herman,
1975). After adjusting for age, social class, and gender, a
measure of hostility was rated higher for African Ameri-
cans than for White patients. African Americans, particu-
larly men, reported more suicide attempts than other per-
sons in the sample. No differences in sleep disturbance,
feelings of guilt or worthlessness, hypochondriasis, or dys-
phoria were found. Liss and coworkers, also working in the
setting of an inpatient psychiatry service, found relatively
few differences in depressive symptom reports when com-
paring African Americans and Whites (Liss, Weiner, Robins,
& Richardson, 1973; Weiner, Liss, & Robins, 1973). De-
pressed affect was the only symptom more common in
Whites, while African Americans more commonly reported
dull affect, delusions of bodily change, delusions of gran-
deur, delusions of passivity, auditory hallucinations, visual
hallucinations, concrete interpretation of proverbs, de-
creased need for sleep, and increased speech. Broadhead
and Garrison studied 102 patients in primary care and
found that somatic symptoms were endorsed at similar
rates in African American and White patients (Broadhead
& Garrison, 1991). In contrast, Brown and Schulberg found
more severe somatic symptoms in African American pri-
mary care patients (Brown & Schulberg, 1996). These in-
vestigations did not adjust comparisons for other personal
characteristics such as age or gender.

tention to the different symptom patterns found in older
African Americans in contrast to Whites, as reflected in our
initial hypothesis; namely, that older African Americans with
depression are less likely to complain of dysphoric mood,
but instead have more somatic complaints (Baker, 1991). Ex-
amining responses from general medical outpatients, Baker
and colleagues qualitatively examined the prevalence of de-
pressive symptoms among 66 African American medical pa-
tients aged 50 years and older, finding that verbal statements
of dysphoric mood were not typical for older African Ameri-
cans (Baker, Parker, Wiley, Velli, & Johnson, 1995).
Depression may be more common among minorities than
previously believed (Jones & Gray, 1986), but if there are
ethnic differences in the tendency to report symptoms
thought to be salient for the diagnosis of depression, indi-
viduals will tend to be misclassified and prevalence rates
will be biased. We have previously noted in our analysis of
depressive symptom variation according to age that the mul-
tiple indicators, multiple causes (MIMIC) model implied a
significantly increased level of depression among minorities
at the Baltimore site but not Durham-Piedmont, in contrast
to prior studies from the ECA employing prevalence data
(e.g., Somervell et al., 1989) and incidence data (Anthony &
Petronis, 1991; Gallo, Royall, & Anthony, 1993). Our analy-
sis was grounded in the DSM criteria for disorder, but we
did not require subjects to meet standard diagnostic criteria
for depression. Instead, we employed a latent variable
model of depression that allowed us to examine symptom-
level differences according to self-reported ethnicity. Now
we employ this model to test the notion that symptom clus-
ters thought to be essential for certain diagnostic categories
among White subjects may not be valid among minorities
(Adebimpe, 1981).
Consistent with this prior work, we hypothesized that
older African Americans might be more likely to report
somatic or vegetative symptoms of depression, and less
likely to report symptoms of a psychological nature, espe-
cially dysphoria, when compared to older Whites. To exam-
ine this issue, we used community data on depressive symp-
toms from older adults, and employed an analytic method
derived from recent developments in evaluating test items
for differential item functioning, or bias, among groups of
examinees. Methods for the detection of bias in test items
have been of interest to test designers in the arena of
achievement testing (Camilli, 1992; Camilli & Shepard,
1994; Millsap & Everson, 1993; Osterlind, 1983; Rogers &
Swaminathan, 1993). In educational achievement testing,
bias, or differential item functioning, occurs when an item is
less likely to be answered correctly by one group of exami-
nees, say girls compared to boys, even when examinees at
the same level of ability are compared (Muthen, 1988a). In
the domain of psychological testing, adjusting for the level
of depression and potentially influential covariates should be
considered when making comparisons of symptom endorse-
ment across groups defined by self-reported race or culture
(Duncan-Jones, Grayson, & Moran, 1986).
This investigation differs from other studies of how
symptom reporting reflects ethnicity in several ways. Stud-
ies that examine psychiatric disturbances among different
ethnic groups, if they examine differences in the reporting
of specific symptoms at all, are limited because they fail to
standardize recording of symptoms, are based on reports of
individuals under treatment with experience in the specialty
mental health sector, and do not account for other covari-
ates that might influence the reporting of symptoms. The
method we have used to compare symptoms of depression
according to self-reported race, the MIMIC model, has sev-
eral advantages over other methods that might have been
used to compare item response, as discussed elsewhere
(Gallo, Anthony, & Muthen, 1994; Muth6n, 1989a). Our
group has previously applied this method to the analysis of
the symptoms of depression according to age (Gallo et al.,
1994), so this study represents an extension of a line of re-
search delineating the salience of the standard criteria for
depression across subjects defined by age, race, settings of
care, and other characteristics. This study differs from the
previous work (Gallo et al., 1994) because here the focus is
placed on the endorsement of symptoms by older African
Americans and Whites.
METHODS
The Epidemiologic Catchment Area Program (ECA) was
a series of epidemiologic surveys conducted by collabora-
tors between 1980 and 1984 at five sites in the United
States: New Haven, Connecticut (Yale University); Balti-
more, Maryland (Johns Hopkins University); St. Louis,
Missouri (Washington University); Durham-Piedmont,
North Carolina (Duke University); and Los Angeles, Cali-
fornia (University of California, Los Angeles). At each site,
ECA collaborators used multistage probability sampling to
select 3,000 to 5,000 adult respondents, and then applied a
standardized interview, the Diagnostic Interview Schedule
(DIS; Robins, Helzer, Croughan, & Ratcliff, 1981). The
standardized questions of the DIS were keyed to individual
criteria of the DSM-III case definition for Major Depres-
sion (American Psychiatric Association, 1980).
Positive responses to the questions were followed by fur-
ther questioning to determine whether a threshold for sever-
ity had been met and whether the symptom was plausible as
a psychiatric symptom; that is, the symptom could not be
explained by physical illness, medications, alcohol, or drug
use (Robins et al., 1981; Robins & Regier, 1991). Finally,
respondents rated the onset and recency of syndromes, that
is, clusters of symptoms, so that the timing of disorders
could be estimated. To meet the DSM-III diagnostic criteria
for Major Depression, an individual must have depressed
mood (dysphoria) or loss of interest in things normally en-
joyed (anhedonia) for two weeks or more, and at least four
of eight additional criteria. However, a diagnosis of Major
Depression was not required for inclusion in our analysis.
In Baltimore and in Durham-Piedmont, information on
onset and recency was gathered at the symptom level, so
that data on recency of individual symptoms are available
for the criteria of DSM-III Major Depression (Von Korff &
Anthony, 1982). If the respondent "ever" had the symptom,
the respondent was then asked when the last time the symp-
tom was present. In this study, item parcels were created
from the symptom-level data (West, Finch, & Curran,
1995). Specifically, item parcels were created for the symp-
tom criteria appetite disturbance, sleep disturbance, psy-
DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS P279
chomotor retardation or agitation, concentration difficulty,
and thoughts of death, as described in detail here.
Detailed descriptions of the sampling design, the diag-
nostic assessments, and other aspects of the ECA have been
published elsewhere, including several studies of DIS relia-
bility and validity (Anthony et al., 1985; Eaton & Kessler,
1985; Helzer et al., 1985). Only symptoms present one
month prior to the interview were rated as "present" for the
current analysis.
Analytic Strategy
The analysis was restricted to household data from re-
spondents aged 60 years and older at the Baltimore, Mary-
land, and Piedmont, North Carolina, sites. The availability
of two sets of data allowed us to compare differences in
symptom endorsement found at the Baltimore site with the
responses from the Durham-Piedmont site, that is, in two
independently gathered samples. Information on self-
reported race was obtained by asking the following ques-
tion: "Would you please look at this card and give me the
letter of the group that best describes your racial back-
ground?" The respondent then selected from a list: American
Indian, Alaskan Native, Asian, Pacific Islander, Black-Not
Hispanic, Hispanic, White-Not Hispanic. We restricted this
study to persons who identified themselves as either
"Black-Not Hispanic" or "White-Not Hispanic." In addi-
tion, only persons with complete data on symptoms along
with the covariates of gender, minority status, educational
status, marital status, and mental status score were included
in this analysis. The implication of selecting only individuals
with complete data is considered in our discussion of study
results.
The MIMIC model, described below, includes dichoto-
mous variables for self-reported race (White = 0; African
American = 1), gender (male = 0; female =1), educational
status (12 or more years of schooling = 0; fewer than 12
years = 1), marital status (married or living with someone
as though married = 0; not currently married =1), and men-
tal status score (above a standard criterion value = 0; below
the standard criterion value =1). The Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE) score (range, 0 to 30; Folstein, Fol-
stein, & McHugh, 1975) was employed as a measure of
mental status (Tombaugh & Mclntyre, 1992). The decisions
on how to code the variables were reached after consider-
ing what variables might modify the tendency to endorse
sadness or loss of interest or pleasure, but before any data
analysis was completed.
The MIMIC Model
Lazarsfeld and Henry (1968) and, later, Bartholomew
(1987), defined latent variables as unobserved variables that
explain the association among a set of observed variables.
This definition is consistent with the notion of a factor in
factor analysis; the factor explains the observed correlations
in the observed variables. The approach in standard factor
analysis assumes that variables are normally distributed and
related to each other in a linear and additive fashion. How-
ever, new analytical methods permit the appropriate use of
dichotomous symptom data. We used a formulation of the
latent trait model developed by Muthen (1983,1984,1988a).
The MIMIC model is a special application of the latent
trait model which enables item bias to be detected across
groups of individuals, whether distinguished by race, gen-
der, age, or other characteristics (Muthe"n, 1989b). We have
introduced covariates to the MIMIC model in order to ex-
amine differential item functioning by self-reported race,
adjusting for differences in the level of the latent trait and
for the effect of other covariates such as gender (Figure 1).
In addition to race, four covariates are introduced to adjust
for differences in level of depression due to gender, educa-
tional status, MMSE score, and marital status, as defined
earlier.
Figure 1 illustrates the three components of the MIMIC
model: (1) the measurement model; (2) the regression
model; and (3) the estimate of the direct effect of ethnicity
on the reporting of individual symptoms. These compo-
nents are estimated simultaneously, using the LISCOMP
program's limited information generalized least squares
estimator for dichotomous items (Muthe'n, 1988a, 1989a).
In the measurement model, the dichotomous symptoms
(symptom present within one month of interview = 1, or
not present = 0) are considered to be the indicators of an
underlying latent dimension of depression. The estimate of
the latent variable for depression is based on the covaria-
tion that the symptom items have in common, in contrast to
a simple sum of depressive symptoms. In the regression
model, the latent variable depression is regressed on the co-
variates. As in ordinary multiple regression, the estimates
of these regression coefficients represent the difference in
the value of the outcome variable for one group compared
to another. Finally, the estimate of the direct effect for eth-
nicity on a given symptom of depression represents a shift
in the measurement characteristics for that symptom com-
paring African Americans to Whites. A significant negative
direct effect implies that, even adjusting for other character-
istics and the level of depression, compared to Whites,
African Americans endorse the symptom at a lower preva-
lence than expected; that is, the symptom exhibits differen-
tial item functioning. Conversely, a positive direct effect is
interpreted to mean that the symptom is more likely to be
endorsed by African Americans than by Whites, all other
characteristics considered. Further details of the statistical
model employed can be found elsewhere (Gallo et al., 1994;
Muthen, 1989b).
RESULTS
A total of 1,157 subjects aged 60 years and older were
interviewed in the household survey in Baltimore, while
1,683 persons aged 60 years and older comprise the house-
hold sample in Durham-Piedmont. These figures exclude
subjects who did not identify themselves as either African
American or White. After excluding persons without com-
plete information on DIS symptom data and all covariates,
968 subjects remained for analysis from the Baltimore site
and 1,486 subjects remained from the Durham-Piedmont
site (Table 1). The African Americans in Baltimore tended
to include fewer persons not living with a spouse compared
to the African Americans in Durham-Piedmont (Table 2).
Among Whites, fewer persons in Baltimore reported less
than a high school education and fewer reported not living

with a spouse compared to Whites in Durham-Piedmont
(Table 2).
Table 3 contains the wording of the DIS questions used to
make operational the DSM-III criteria for depression as well
as the one month prevalence of item parcels. Inspection of
the prevalences shown in the table reveals that, for the most
part, the one month prevalence estimates for symptoms
were higher among African Americans than among Whites
in Baltimore, but tended to be lower among African Ameri-
cans compared with Whites in Durham-Piedmont.
Simple tests of model fit based on the chi-square statistic
are likely to reject good fitting models when the sample
size is large. For this reason, several alternative indices of
model fit were calculated for the MIMIC models. Values
for the fit indices range from zero, indicating poor fit, to
1.00, indicating perfect fit (Alwin, 1988; Bollen & Long,
1993; Hoyle, 1995). The goodness-of-fit index was 0.95 for
the Baltimore analyses and 0.98 for the Durham-Piedmont
analyses. An adjusted goodness-of-fit index that accounts
for the number of model parameters was 0.97 for the Balti-
more analyses and 0.99 for the Durham-Piedmont analyses.
The calculated indices indicate good model fit. The critical
numbers (Hoelter, 1983; Wheaton, 1988), 818 and 1,291,

and the descriptive fit values (Muth6n, 1989a), 0.002 and
0.001, for Baltimore and Durham-Piedmont, respectively,
also indicate good model fit. The covariance structure of
the symptom level data from the two sites was consistent
with a single factor, as evidenced by a scree plot of eigen-
values (not shown; Cattell, 1965; Edelbrock, 1987; Gib-
bons, Clark, Cavanaugh, & Davis, 1985).
The parameter estimates for the MIMIC models using
DIS data are presented in Tables 4 and 5. The first set of es-
timates relates to the regression of depression on the co-
variates of race, gender, education, MMSE score, and mari-
tal status (Table 4). The interpretation of the significantly
higher estimate for African Americans at the Baltimore site
was that older African Americans are higher on the latent
trait of depression when compared with older Whites. At
the Durham-Piedmont site, older African Americans had
a mean level of depression that was lower than that of
Whites. As anticipated, women, persons with less than a
high school education, and persons who were not married
also reported higher levels of depression according to the
MIMIC model, although these were not significantly differ-
ent from the null value for the estimates derived from the
symptom data obtained at the Baltimore site.
Focusing attention on the Baltimore site, examination of
the estimates in Table 5 for the direct effect of ethnicity on
the symptoms of depression indicate several items with dif-
ferential item functioning according to self-reported ethnic-
ity. Examining the estimates from the Baltimore site, sleep
disturbance was less likely to be endorsed by African Amer-
icans than Whites, given level of depression and the other
potentially influential covariates. Difficulty with concentrat-
ing and thoughts of death were more likely to be reported by
older African Americans one month prior to interview, when
compared with older Whites. Older African Americans were
less likely to report other symptoms, but the difference did
not reach generally accepted standards for statistical signifi-
cance. The key symptom of sadness was noted to be less
likely to be endorsed by African Americans at both sites (the
point estimate for the direct effect is negative). We tested
the extent to which these results were replicable using re-
sults in the responses from subjects in the Durham-Pied-
mont sample. As indicated in Table 5, three symptoms
demonstrated statistically significant differences in African
Americans compared with Whites at the Durham-Piedmont
site; namely, sadness, loss of interest, and thoughts of death.
The finding regarding the item parcel of "thinking about
death or suicide" deserves closer examination. The item par-

eel related to thoughts of death consisted of three questions
dealing with thinking a lot about death, wanting to die, or
thoughts of committing suicide (Table 3). While older
African Americans were more likely to endorse this item
parcel than were Whites in the MIMIC model, the main dif-
ference in endorsement arose from the item about thoughts
of death. Specifically, Whites in Baltimore and Durham-
Piedmont endorsed thoughts of death at similar rates (6.04%
and 6.32%, respectively), while African Americans in the
two samples endorsed thoughts of death at higher rates than
Whites (11.21% in Baltimore and 9.27% in Durham-Pied-
mont). In contrast, endorsement of wanting to die was simi-
lar in Whites and African Americans (1.61% among Whites
and 1.40% among African Americans in Baltimore, and
1.35% among Whites and 1.35% among African Americans
in Durham-Piedmont). No African Americans at either site
endorsed thoughts of committing suicide (compared to
0.13% of Whites in Baltimore and 0.62% in Durham-
Piedmont).
DISCUSSION
Our results were not wholly consistent with our initial
hypothesis regarding depressive symptoms reported by
older African Americans compared with older Whites. At
both sites studied, older African Americans were more
likely to report thoughts of death, but we failed to find any
pattern of older African Americans being more likely to
report symptoms of a somatic or vegetative nature (e.g., ap-
petite disturbance). On the other hand, it is interesting that
older African Americans were generally less likely to report
sadness than older Whites (although this difference failed
to reach statistical significance by conventional standards in
the Baltimore sample). We used an analytic approach that is
generally applicable whenever it is necessary to adjust for
levels of depression and potentially influential characteris-
tics, such as gender, in estimating whether there is differen-
tial item functioning according to race or culture. Few stud-
ies comparing responses of African Americans and Whites
have focused on item level differences in depression, as we
have done here.

This investigation differs in several ways from prior re-
search on ethnic differences in psychiatric disturbances.
First, the study respondents were the participants of a large
epidemiologic survey of psychiatric disturbances in the
community (the Epidemiologic Catchment Area [ECA]
Program; Robins & Regier, 1991), and therefore the study
was not limited to the responses of adults who have sought
treatment from a professional. Second, the data on symp-
toms were collected in a standardized manner employing
items keyed to the criteria set forth in the third edition of
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-III) of the
American Psychiatric Association (American Psychiatric
Association, 1980), so that symptoms can be studied in re-
lation to the standard diagnostic criteria, as opposed to
some general measure of psychologic distress. Third, we
used an analytic strategy with advantages over other meth-
ods that have been developed to study heterogeneity in
measurement (Muthen, 1989b), a strategy that allowed us
to examine the relationship of race to particular symptoms
while holding constant the influence of other characteris-
tics, such as gender and the level of depression.
Other methods employed to study group differences in
item response are limited in their ability: (1) to control for
important covariates (e.g., methods based on the Mantel-
Haenszel statistic; Nandakumar, Glutting, & Oakland, 1993;
Rogers & Swaminathan, 1993; Zwick & Ercikan, 1989);
(2) to employ a latent variable model with explicit speci-
fication of measurement error (e.g., logistic regression;
Camilli & Shepard, 1994; Rogers & Swaminathan, 1993);
or (3) to analyze sparse or skewed symptom data (e.g., mul-

DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS P283
tiple-group factor analysis; Horn & McArdle, 1992). In ad-
dition, most prior work on ethnic differences in symptoms
has been carried out among patients in the specialty mental
health services (e.g., Liss et al., 1973; Raskin et al., 1975;
Weiner et al., 1973), so that observed symptom differences
that might account for differing rates of diagnosis accord-
ing to race or ethnicity are confounded by differential ac-
cess to health services. Other characteristics that influence
the reporting of symptoms, such as gender, or level of de-
pression, are rarely considered.
Neighbors called attention to the assumption that instru-
ments measure the same construct when instruments devel-
oped among Whites are applied to African Americans or
other minority ethnic groups (Neighbors & Lumpkin,
1990); in other words, that measurement invariance holds.
Measurement invariance implies that symptoms have the
same relationship to an underlying psychiatric disturbance
across individuals, that the same construct is being mea-
sured (Horn & McArdle, 1992). The focused aim of the
structural equation model employed here was to examine
the measurement characteristics of the DIS at the symptom
level according to self-reported race. External and internal
relations among the variables and the construct of depres-
sion were simultaneously estimated in the MIMIC model,
providing a model of external and internal construct validity
(McArdle & Prescott, 1992). Furthermore, estimation pro-
cedures were appropriate given the dichotomous nature of
the symptom level data (Gallo et al., 1994; Muthen, 1989b).
Before discussion of the study results, a number of lim-
itations must be addressed. First, certain assumptions about
the validity and assessment of the concept of ethnicity un-
derlie the concept of "race" used in surveys (Hahn, 1992).
We have assumed that participants understand and respond
consistently to questions about ethnicity. Second, labels em-
ployed for ethnicity imply a homogeneity within groups. In-
stead, it is likely mat differences ascribed to "race" reflect
social more than genetic differences (Cooper & David,
1986; Lillie-Blanton, Anthony, & Schuster, 1993). On the
other hand, failure to account for heterogeneity in measure-
ment of depressive symptoms might be misleading in com-
paring prevalence of symptoms or disorders according to
ethnicity (Neighbors & Lumpkin, 1990). Third, we could
not explicitly include in the model somatic complaints re-
spondents may have experienced. We do not know the ex-
tent to which African Americans ascribed their symptoms to
a physical illness; however, symptoms ascribed to a physical
illness were not counted in the present analysis. Fourth,
chronic medical conditions may also affect the pattern of de-
pressive symptoms endorsed and are not included in the
model. Instead, we have chosen to adjust our estimates for
other characteristics that can be assessed more reliably than
self-report of medical diagnoses (such as level of educa-
tional attainment) but which are themselves associated with
functional and medical status. Fifth, the tendency to report
symptoms could have been affected in unknown ways by
the ethnic or racial background of the interviewer. It is pos-
sible that African Americans were reluctant to report certain
symptoms to a White interviewer, or that White participants
were reluctant to report certain symptoms to an African
American interviewer. Finally, the MIMIC model itself is
associated with a number of limitations that are discussed at
length elsewhere (Gallo et al., 1994).
Despite limitations, the study calls attention to a key
symptom that appears to be differentially reported by African
Americans and Whites: sadness. Another important clue to
depression, sleep disturbance, was less likely to be reported
by older African Americans than by Whites at the Baltimore
site. Older African Americans in Baltimore were more likely
to report trouble concentrating when compared with Whites.
At the Durham-Piedmont site, older African Americans were
less likely to report loss of interest. Thoughts of death were
more likely to be reported by African Americans at both
sites. Differences between sites likely reflect characteristics
of the samples that were not included in the model, such as
rural-urban contrasts, or may simply reflect sampling fluc-
tuation. Older African American adults at the rural site may
be generally more reluctant to report symptoms (the mean
level of depression was significantly less than the null value
of zero).
Older African Americans were more likely than older
Whites to report thoughts of death, but not suicidal ideation,
compared with Whites in both samples studied. Thoughts of
death (one's own or others) may not be inherently depressive,
but could be part of one's cultural world view and experi-
ences. Older adults may have increased thoughts of death as a
developmental consideration (Macdonald & Dunn, 1982), so
that thoughts of death per se may be nonspecific in detecting
depression. Suicidal ideation, however, is not developmen-
tally normal for older adults. Environmental stress is insuffi-
cient to produce suicidal ideation except in persons who per-
ceive few options (Bonner & Rich, 1988; Brown, Hentcleff,
& Barskat, 1986). Associated with suicidal ideation are intol-
erable pain, feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, and a
"constricted" cognitive state (Schneiderman, 1986). Cooper-
Patrick and colleagues found that suicidal ideation was pre-
dicted by hopelessness, guilt, depressed mood, and sleep dis-
turbance (Cooper-Patrick, Crum, & Ford, 1994). In that study
based on all five ECA sites, African Americans were less
likely than Whites to report suicidal ideation. Although
thoughts of death may be more common among the elderly,
and suicide rates increase with age (La Vecchia, Lucchini, &
Levi, 1994), suicidal ideation appears to be generally less
common among older adults when compared with younger
adults (Gallo et al., 1994; Musetti et al., 1989).
Other studies have focused on thoughts of death and sui-
cidal ideation among older people. Based on a stratified
sample of older primary care attenders, Callahan and col-
leagues estimated the prevalence of suicidal ideation at 0.7%
to 1.2% (Callahan, Hendrie, Nienaber, & Tierney, 1996).
Among patients reporting suicidal ideation, severity of
depressive symptoms and functional impairment varied
widely. Unfortunately, no demographic or clinical variables
distinguished depressed suicidal patients from depressed
nonsuicidal patients (Callahan et al., 1996). Half the pa-
tients with suicidal ideation reported a history of depres-
sion. Skoog and colleagues (1996) found that, among per-
sons aged 85 years and older living in Gothenberg,
Sweden, who did not have diagnosable mental disorders,
0.9% reported thoughts of taking their own lives within one
month of interview. Older patients with Major Depression,
P284 GALLO ET AL.
however, were much more likely to express thoughts of
death or suicide. These studies that focused on older adults
did not examine differences in endorsement of symptoms
according to ethnicity as we have done here. Depression is
the psychiatric condition most often linked to suicide
among older adults. Conwell and colleagues (Conwell &
Caine, 1991; Conwell et al., 1996), investigating via psy-
chological autopsy all suicides within a geographical re-
gion, found that with increasing age, depression was more
likely to be unaccompanied by other psychiatric conditions,
such as substance abuse. Up to half of the elderly victims of
suicide had seen their physician within one month of their
death, the majority had seen their general physician within
three months of the suicide (Barraclough, 1971; Clark,
1991; Conwell & Caine, 1991). Understanding alternative
presentations of depression according to ethnicity might
help in identifying who may be at risk for worsening de-
pression or even suicide.
Cross-cultural heterogeneity in studies of depression may
influence the symptoms expressed and, hence, the diagnosis
of syndromal depression. Like all investigations with a phe-
nomenological orientation, cross-cultural studies are com-
pelled to use multivariate statistical techniques to study
symptom patterns, avoiding a reliance on a priori diag-
nostic categories (Blashfield, 1990; Marsella, Sartorius,
Jablensky, & Fenton, 1985). Some cultures do not have
concepts that are equivalent to a Western notion of depres-
sion. The Hopi Indians of Arizona, for example, describe an
illness similar to Major Depression but without dysphoria
(Manson, Shore, & Bloom, 1985). People in some cultures
have difficulty finding the words to describe depression
(Kleinman, 1986; Leighton et al., 1963; Lutz, 1988; Waziri,
1973). Neurasthenic patients in China deny dysphoria, but
do exhibit the other symptoms of depression, such as psy-
chomotor retardation and somatic complaints. Even when
Chinese neurasthenic patients report dysphoria, they see it
as a result of pain they are experiencing, especially head-
ache (Kleinman, 1980).
In conclusion, our study did not support our initial hy-
pothesis that older African Americans would be more likely
than older Whites to report depressive symptoms of a
somatic nature and less likely to report symptoms of a
psychological nature. Based on conventional levels of sta-
tistical significance, only thoughts of death were more fre-
quently reported by older African Americans in both sam-
ples studied. Consistent with prior studies, there was
evidence that older African Americans were less likely to
report sadness when compared with older Whites. Close at-
tention to symptom patterns is essential if subsyndromal
forms of depressive illness are to be understood, and our
findings suggest that further work is needed on the issue of
measurement invariance in psychiatric research.
