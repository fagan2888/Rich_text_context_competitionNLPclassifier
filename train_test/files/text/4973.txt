Introduction
Mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety disorders
are diseases with high prevalence. Once people miss an
opportunity to recover, they take a long time to get back
into society. However, some people will avoid going to a
clinic to see a psychologist because of the stigma associ-
ated with these illnesses, and sometimes their condition has
become rather severe by the time they get to the clinic.
Therefore, preventive interventions and self-management
are important for addressing these problems. Self-
management is based on operant conditioning, which aims
to relieve stress people are incurring by rewarding them for
actions they take to improve their condition. There is also a
technique known as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT),
which is a proven method for recovering from depression
and anxiety disorders (Butler et al., 2006; Tolin, 2010).
Integrating self-management and CBT enables patients to
deal with their disease on a daily basis at low cost.
One of the goals of CBT is to enable people to regulate
their behavior. The idea behind this form of therapy is to
enable patients to activate and/or deactivate their actions,
that is, their behavior. A fundamental factor in behavioral
activation is getting people to continuously do things that
will bring better results to them. It aims to help them
increase their activities with positive reinforcement rather
than decrease their activities with negative reinforcement.
However, simply helping people to increase their activities
will not solve the problem. For people who have difficulty
in activating their behavior or are too active, it is better to
support them in a gentler manner by, for example, encour-
aging them to try small tasks or take short rest periods. This
is the key idea behind behavioral regulation.
Computerized cognitive behavioral therapy
Many researchers have confirmed evidence of the effect of
computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (CCBT), and it
is used in treating several mental diseases (Bardram et al.,

Abstract
Most of computerized cognitive behavioral therapy targeted restoration and few have targeted primary prevention. The
purpose of this study is to obtain the knowledge for further development on preventive mental healthcare application.
We developed a personal mental healthcare application which aimed to give users the chance to manage their mental
health by self-monitoring and regulating their behavior. Through the 30-day field trial, the results showed improvement
of mood score through conducting of suggested action, and the depressive mood of the participants was significantly
decreased after the trial. The possibility of application and further problem was confirmed.

Intervention Study
2 Health Psychology Open 
2012, 2013; Doherty et al., 2012). In particular, it is an
effective way to improve the state of mind of those with
mild to moderate depression, dysphoria, and anxiety disor-
der (Andrews et al., 2010; Christensen et al., 2004; Clarke
et al., 2005; Iloabachie et al., 2011). The National Institute
for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United
Kingdom recommends CCBT for these mental illnesses. In
recent years, many uses of CCBT that utilize more conveni-
ent mobile applications have been developed (e.g. Birney
et al., 2016; Watts et al., 2013), and there have been con-
tinuous extensions of target-specific programs to address
illnesses such as eating disorders (Nitsch et al., 2016),
social anxiety disorders (Miloff et al., 2015), posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) (Kuhn et al., 2014), or fibromyalgia
(De la Vega et al., 2016). Gamification of clinical tech-
niques such as attention-bias modification training (Dennis
and O'Toole, 2014) has also been developed, and the pos-
sibilities that various treatment methods show have been
expanded. However, using these methods for treatment
poses various risks. These risks have been discussed, and
summaries of the ethical issues they involve have been
reported (Prentice and Dobson, 2014).
Self-monitoring applications
Matthews et al. reported that a self-monitoring method on a
mobile phone was more effective than the paper-based meth-
ods that have been reported, and that it helped users to under-
stand self-awareness (Matthews and Doherty, 2011). Other
approaches have been reported, such as a real-time monitor-
ing application for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) children when symptoms appear (Gringras et al.,
2006), and monitoring symptoms of bipolar disorders that
have been shown to be effective compared to the paper-based
approach (Bauer et al., 2006). As for self-assessment and
screening, there are specialized applications for bipolar disor-
ders (Bardram et al., 2013), anxiety (Bauer et al., 2006), men-
tal illness including depression and anxiety disorder (Donker
et al., 2009), behavioral problems of young men (Diamond
et al., 2010), eating disorders (Fairburn and Rothwell, 2015),
and insomnia (Koffel et al., 2016; Kuhn et al., 2016).
Applications for patients with major depressive disor-
ders, bipolar disorders, and schizophrenia use voice-based
input and graphs to display the data to reduce the monitor-
ing workload for self-assessment (Chinman et al., 2007).
Recently, possibilities have been examined for effectively
using wearable systems for self-monitoring (Lanata et al.,
2015; Martinez et al., 2016).
Behavioral regulation applications
Applications for behavioral activation have been developed
mainly in the context of physical health promotion (Payne
et al., 2015). In such circumstances, MONARCA is one of
the famous self-monitoring applications for psychological
treatment, but it addresses behavioral activation (Bardram
et al., 2012). "BeWell" aims to activate behavior by graphi-
cally showing physical exertion feedback to the user, for
such factors as sleeping and physical conditions (Lane
et al., 2011). There are other applications that automati-
cally correct physical exertion data of depressed patients
from a mobile phone and give feedback to activate behav-
ior (Burns et al., 2011). These applications use games to
encourage users to do such things such as raising a virtual
pet or take long walks (Lin et al., 2006) or eat healthily
and regularly (Pollak et al., 2010). One application that
has been reported is the "Positive Activity Jackpot,"
which helps depressed people to become more activated
by scheduling pleasant events they can participate in and
using augmented reality technology (Edwards-Stewart,
2012). These applications and services encourage behav-
ioral activation and regulation. When they are used, how-
ever, it is important to not only activate behavior but also
to manage the behavior quantity and quality by adjusting
the user's physical and mental conditions. For example,
when users overexert themselves (i.e. by becoming too
activated), behavior deactivation is preferable to behavior
activation. This suggests there is a real need for a system
that has the capability to understand users' physical and
mental conditions by self-monitoring them and giving
them feedback with which they can regulate their
behavior.
This research work has mainly focused on supporting
patients and clinician interaction; they assumed that system
users were ill and needed to visit a clinic. On the other
hand, prevention is also an important issue to be addressed
in mental healthcare (Cuijpers et al., 2005). We therefore
focused on personal mental healthcare, assuming that our
system's users would be not only people who were men-
tally ill but also people who were in good mental health. We
wanted our system to enable users to use it anytime and
anywhere--at their home, office, or wherever--to check
their mental health. We also wanted it to be personal, that
is, one they could use on the web with the device of their
preference (personal computer, mobile device, etc.).
In accordance with our objectives, we here present the
personal mental healthcare application we propose, which
we call "SABORI" (self-monitoring application for behav-
ioral observation and regulation by interaction), which inte-
grates self-monitoring and behavioral self-regulation. This
article discusses the possibilities for applying it to people
for whom field trials have not motivated their interest in
mental healthcare and further developing it for preventive
mental health applications.
Materials and methods
We conducted a field trial to understand how the applica-
tion supports people to prevent them from incurring men-
tal illness and how well its interactive design works. Note
that this field trial was performed under close supervision
by clinical psychologists and that it received ethical
Hirano et al. 3
permission.1 Participants were told that they could stop
using the application anytime if they wanted.
Participants
We used an open participation process, in which we
recruited participants through our website, paper flyers, and
emails. In total, 98 volunteers participated in the field trial,
aged 19­69 (average: 34.46, standard deviation (SD):
13.16)years. There were 53 males and 45 females; 51 were
office workers and 31 were university students. None of
them had any prior associations or experience with our lab,
group, or project. They used the SABORI application on
their personal computer and whatever mobile device they
had (e.g. a smartphone).
Before starting the trial, each participant was asked to
answer a Kessler Psychological Distress Scale question-
naire (K10) (Kessler et al., 2002). The K10 questionnaire is
a simple 10-item screening scale for psychological distress
(range: 10­50). We performed this non-mandatory test
before (pre-test) and after (post-test) the trial to investigate
the improvement in the psychological state that had been
obtained with the application. The obtained results showed
that 83 of the participants answered the questionnaire
before the trial (pre-test), and that 23 of them (28%) were
recognized as having mild depression (threshold score is 25
in K10), but the others were in good health. For quantitative
analysis, we mainly analyzed the following: (1) the mood
score that was collected by the self-monitoring and (2) the
K10 score before and 30days after the trial. For qualitative
analysis, we asked participants to answer a free-form ques-
tionnaire on-site or online; 29 of them answered it. The
questionnaire items were about the participants' impres-
sions of the application, its points they had found useful or
not useful, its points they had enjoyed, and its functions
they preferred.
SABORI system
All the feedback, suggestions, interfaces, interactions, and
tokens for the application (including gamification function-
ality) were designed by psychotherapists who had com-
pleted CBT training. This application was created for
Japanese; all figures in this article include Japanese text
with English captions. The application was deployed on a
web server, and it was itself a web application. The users
used it on whatever device they preferred, such as a per-
sonal computer or a mobile device. The application was
implemented by adopting a responsive method to display
the appropriate design on various devices.
Self-monitoring (morning).We designed two questionnaires
to determine the user's psychological state; they were used
for self-monitoring (Figure 1). The first questionnaire was
for the mood score, which comprised three items: (1)
depressed feeling, represented on the "depressed--cheer-
ful" axis, (2) anxious feeling, represented on the "anx-
ious--relaxed" axis, and (3) frantic feeling, represented on
the "angry--calm" axis. Each axis has a 0­100 point scale,
and the mood score sum (maximum 300) was used for the
analysis of the field trial.
The second questionnaire aimed to collect self-monitor-
ing data focusing on "busyness, physical condition, and
mental condition." This 14-item questionnaire was used for
giving feedback and suggestions and was only displayed in
the morning (Figure 1, left). For a good starting point, the
first item was about the weather condition. The details of
the other 13 items were as follows: (1) five items about
busyness (Yes/No) (e.g. "Do you have some plans today?"),
(2) five items about physical condition (Yes/So-so/No)
(e.g. "Did you sleep well?"), and (3) three items about men-
tal condition (Yes/So-so/No) (e.g. "Are you thinking posi-
tively?"). Since answering the same questions every day is
boring for the user, there were variations (having the same
meaning) for each item. The application selected one of the
variations randomly.
Feedback and suggestions. On the basis of the self-moni-
toring data collected in the morning, the application gave
feedback and suggestions. Usually, the feedback and sug-
gestions given by a computer program are non-individual-
ized; all users get the same tasks many times. However,
feedback and suggestions for behavioral regulation should
be different because they are based on the users' mental
state, so the application needs to have functionality to
give feedback/suggestions on a case-by-case basis. In a
face-to-face interview, a therapist is able to give appropri-
ate suggestions by talking with the patient individually.
However, our application is able to present variations in
feedback/suggestions by analyzing the results obtained in
self-monitoring.
For suggestions, we first listed four types for behavioral
regulation (Table 1). The application selected two of them
using the weighting of the scores for busyness, physical
condition, and mental condition. There were three weight-
ing levels for the physical and mental conditions (good,
Figure 1. Self-monitoring interface.
4 Health Psychology Open 
moderate, and bad) and there were nine patterns for combi-
nations of them (Table 2). Additionally, the busyness score
had two levels (heavy and light), so there were 18 patterns
in total. Each pattern had three suggested actions, so the
application had 54 suggested actions in total.
After users got the feedback comment based on the anal-
ysis of the self-monitoring results (e.g. "You need a rest
today."), then the application selected two of the three
actions that are considered as appropriate patterns for users.
Finally, the user chose one action as that suggested for the
day from the presented actions.
Self-monitoring (evening).When the user logged into the
application in the evening, a different interface was dis-
played if the user had completed the self-monitoring in the
morning. At this time, the virtual agent in the kimono first
asked the user whether he or she had completed the sug-
gested action. There were three answer options: (1) "Yes,"
(2) "Only partially," and (3) "No." Once users had selected
an option, a reward item was given to them. Finally, the
users were asked to work out their mood score using the
same questionnaire that was used in the morning.
Review. We designed a couple of graphs to show self-mon-
itoring data. Figure 2 shows an example graph of the appli-
cation. The graph on the left represents the three elements
of the mood score, and that on the right shows the busyness
and physical conditions. We used six graphs to show mood
score, busyness, and physical condition (three graphs) in a
week and a month view (two types). The highest and lowest
scores of each condition were highlighted to support the
user to understand self-awareness.
Results
Usage frequency
We analyzed the 30-day login history, which started from
the first login day of the user. The average number of logins
was 9.35 times and the median was 5 times. During the
30
days, 14 participants logged in 21­30 times, 23 were
logged in 11­20 times, and 34 were logged in 2­10 times.
A total of 27 participants logged into the application only
once. The average number of logins was 12.52 times
(excluding participants who logged in only once). By look-
ing at the login interval (the number of days between two
consecutive logins, one being the minimum), we analyzed
participants who were logged in at least two times, and the
average was 2.50days. This means that not the long login
interval but the dropout causes the low frequency of login
times.
Completion rate of suggested action
Next, we analyzed the collected data to ascertain how
many suggested actions had been completed in the trial.
There were 797 time­day data sets for the 73 participants
who reported both mood scores in the morning/evening
and whether they had completed the suggested actions. We
prepared 54 actions for the suggestions, but two actions
were never presented to the participants. Among the 52
actions for whom the actions had been presented at least
once, 4 had never been chosen by the participants, so 48 of
them were included in the analysis. First, we calculated the
completion rate (completed times/presented times). The
overall completion rate was sufficiently high, the average

completion rate was 71.52percent, and the 40 actions were
completed over 60
percent of the time (Table 3). On the
other hand, there were six actions with a completion rate of
40percent or less. Next, we calculated the completion rate
for individuals. The overall completion rate was suffi-
ciently high as well; 57 of the participants completed
60
percent or more of the actions, and the median was
77percent.
Looking at the suggestion distribution types, we found
that though the deactivate action (DA) was frequently
selected, the other suggestions were selected nearly as
often. These included suggestions for improving heath both
"mentally and physically" and suggestions pertaining to the
use of "activating and deactivating action" functions. These
indicate that participants activated and deactivated actions
on the same basis, and that the application well guided
them with respect to their behavior.
Mood improvement by completing suggested
action
First, we calculated the differences in mood scores between
morning and evening for each set of 797 time­day data. We
then averaged the different scores for individuals who had
completed the action and those who had not. For the former
case, the mood score increased daily, the average change
score being 12.7 points (N=71, SD
=
33.3). For the latter
case, the mood score decreased, and the average was -2.8
points (N=52, SD
=
23.2). We analyzed the relationship
between doing the suggested action and mood improve-
ment. We used HLM 7.01 (http://www.ssicentral.com/
hlm/) and the hierarchical linear model for this analysis
(details are presented in Appendix 1). The results showed
that the estimate of the mood improvement difference
between a completed case and a not completed case was
13.4 points, and the difference was significant (standard
error (SE)=3.57, t(72)=3.76, p<.001). These results ena-
bled us to deduce that the user's mood in the evening was
improved as a result of doing the action suggested in the
morning.
Mood improvement after 30-day trial
To consider the long-term changes in mood associated with
using the application continuously, we first compared the
K10 scores obtained in the pre-test with those obtained in
the post-test. We received both pre- and post-test K10 data
from 31 participants. Table 4 compares the results obtained
from participants who took both tests and those who only
took the pre-test. There was a significant difference in the
number of logins between the two groups, so caution should
be taken when interpreting the results.
In the K10 questionnaire, a lower score is better and rep-
resents mental well-being; if the participant's mental health
improves, the score will decrease. We conducted an analysis
including participants who only took the pre-test and logged
into the application at least two times. In this test, we consid-
ered only 67 participants for purposes of accuracy. In this
situation, hierarchical linear models (Appendix 1) can be
used to include the data from participants who did not take
the post-test. As a result, we were able to confirm that there
was a significant decrease in the K10 score (t(66)=-2.21,
p=.003). The average score decreased by 1.75 points. These
results suggest that the mental state of participants tended to
get better the longer they used the application continuously.
We also found that a correlation occurred between the
change in K10 and the initial status of K10 (r=-.87).
Participants with a high K10 score at the pre-test tended to
show good improvement. Finally, we analyzed the mood
improvement in individual participants. The participants
for this analysis were those who took both the pre- and
post-tests, so this was a within-subject design analysis.
There were two groups for the analysis; one was a group of
participants who were recognized as having mild depres-
sion (K1025, n=10), and the other was a group of partici-
pants who did not have depression (K1024, n=21). The
results showed that the average score of the depressed
group was significantly decreased by 4.5 (t(9)=-2.40,
p=.04). Effect size d (Appendix 1) was -1.03. On the other
hand, we found no significant differences between the
results of the pre- and post-test in the non-depression group
(t(20)=-0.28, p=.78) and d=-.06.
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to obtain knowledge that will
enable further development to be pursued on preventive
mental healthcare application through field trials of the
SABORI system. We will discuss these points below.

Here, we will provide a brief summary of the field trial
results. The participants used the application frequently and
completed the suggested actions at a sufficiently high rate.
Their mood scores significantly improved if they carried
out the suggested actions. The K10 scores of the depression
group significantly improved after using our application for
30days. Judging from the overall results obtained, we feel
that our application has very good possibilities to make sig-
nificant contributions to managing personal mental health
management even though we did not compare it with any
control groups.
Mood improvement
The results we obtained that suggested the users'mood was
improved when they performed the actions suggested
allowed us to deduce that our behavioral self-regulation
system was able to at least to a certain degree help users to
improve their state of mind.
In comparing the K10 scores, we got for the participants
between the pre- and post-tests, a period of time that lasted
for 30
days, and we found that there was no significant
improvement for the people in the non-depression group.
The post-test results we obtained for them were signifi-
cantly lower than the pre-test results we obtained for the
depression group. In this trial, however, we did not prepare
any control group. Thus, we cannot deny the possibility that
participants had recovered naturally. Ideally, a follow-up
study should be performed on the incidence of mental dis-
ease to strictly verify the preventive effect.
Utilization
One of the biggest issues in CCBT personal mental health-
care application is the dropout rate.Asurvey by Kaltenthaler
et al. reported that 18­38
percent of participants drop out
during the session (Kaltenthaler et al., 2008). According to
extensive meta-analysis, only 17
percent of users com-
pleted all CCBT treatment modules (Karyotaki et al., 2015).
Participants dropped out due to multiple factors, for exam-
ple, they felt that they could not be rewarded sufficiently or
they felt clinicians would not recommend them as use
cases. In any case, the CCBT dropout rate was higher than
that of face-to-face psychological therapy. In our work, we
found that 27 of the 98 participants (27.6%) logged into the
application only once, which is in the range of the usual
CCBT dropout rate. This was not a bad result and in fact
was slightly higher than we had expected. As mentioned
beforehand, in face-to-face therapy therapeutic alliance
helps to maintain adherence to treatment (Lambert, 1992).
It has also been confirmed that a therapeutic alliance was
formed between people and an embodied conversational
agent (Bickmore et al., 2010). Such an alliance could have
been formed in the SABORI system between a user and a
virtual agent in the same way as had been reported in previ-
ous work.
The SABORI application targets people who are not
motivated by mental healthcare because the latter aims to
prevent them from becoming victims of depression or anxi-
ety. Therefore, it is difficult to compare the dropout rate in
this study with other therapeutic applications. The thera-
peutic applications that have been described need high
usage frequency to provide sufficient intervention; in con-
trast, our approach does not necessarily need high usage
frequency. At this point, we cannot discuss whether the uti-
lization rates we obtained in this study were sufficiently
high by comparing them with those obtained in previous
research. This is because there have been few studies on
preventive mental health application, and thus, it is neces-
sary to take long-term considerations into account.
Limitations and further problems
Since we did not prepare any control groups, we were not
able to confirm the effects produced when the user did not
use our application. Our findings were as follows: (1) the
mental condition of depressed users was improved after the
30-day trial and (2) the mental condition of users who were
recognized as being well by the pre-test was stable after the
30-day trial. The results suggested that the application has
valid possibilities for being able to help regulate mildly
depressive moods, but that it needs more trials and analysis
to validate the validity of its concept. By the same token, we
did not analyze users who did not start to use the application
and why they did not choose to do so. Neither did we study
how many and what types of users would like to use it con-
tinuously. Although we used an open participation process,
there were 27 users who logged into the application only

once. This indicates that we need to conduct a study on how
we can make the application suitable for public use using it
on a widespread basis.
The application did not compel participants to complete
the suggested actions. Furthermore, since it was based on
the participants' decision on whether or not they would try
to perform the suggested action, confounding variables
might be the result. For example, they might try to perform
the suggested action if they thought their mood would be
improved. Further trials and analysis will be necessary to
clarify these points. It will also be necessary to focus on
data that were missing in the post-test. Almost all the par-
ticipants who did not take the post-test stopped using the
application after less than 30
days. The low number of
usage cases reported suggests the strong possibility that the
users' mood was not improved as much as it would have
been if they had taken a longtime use test. However, this
application did not aim to provide a treatment environment;
it aimed to give users an opportunity to execute self-man-
agement. It is natural that when users dropped out early, it
was because they did not want to continue using the appli-
cation because we did not force them to use it. Finally, we
did not conduct any follow-ups. The effect of longtime
usage beyond the 30-day trial needs to be evaluated before
the application can be made more widely available.
Conclusion
We presented a personal preventive mental healthcare
application that we call SABORI, which aimed to give
users the chance to manage their mental health by monitor-
ing their mental/physical conditions and regulating their
behavior by performing actions suggested by the applica-
tion. The application, as well as a field trial conducted on
and discussions about it, enabled us to obtain knowledge
about further development and problems on preventive
mental healthcare application.

Appendix 1
Analyzing diurnal mood variation with
hierarchical linear model
Mood improvement in a day (mood difference between
morning and evening) of an individual i on day t: yit
is an
individual's repeated measurement data, and we can analyze
it with the hierarchical linear model. The relation between
diurnal mood variation and whether the participant did or
did not do the suggestion of the day is modeled as follows
y x r
it i i it it
= + +
 
0 1
(A1)
where xit
is an indicator variable for whether the participant
did or did not do the suggestion of the day. 0i
represents the
average of diurnal mood variation where individual i is did
not do (xit
=0) the suggested action of the day. The diurnal
mood variation that individual i did do the suggested action
on a day (xit
=1) is represented by 0i
+1i
, so 1i
is the dif-
ference between diurnal mood variations (morning and
evening) of did and did not do the suggested action, and it
represents the effect of doing the suggested action for indi-
vidual i. rit
is the error.
It is assumed that there is a difference among individuals
in the value of two parameters, 0i
and 1i
, and these two
parameters follow the bivariate normal distribution.
Therefore, the average of 1i
represents the average effect
of completing the suggested action.
Analyzing mood improvement after 30-day trial
The K10 score of pre-test and post-test was analyzed with
the hierarchical linear model. The K10 score of individual i
at time t (t=0 for pre-test, t=1 for post-test); yit
is also mod-
eled as equation A1. In this situation, xit
is an indicator vari-
able for time (xit
=0 for pre-test, xit
=1 for post-test). In the
same manner as Appendix 1, 1i
can be interpreted as the
difference between the K10 score of pre-test and post-test
for individual i, and the average of 1i
represents the aver-
age of those differences.
Effect size
There are variations for the index of the effect size d. In our
work, we define the effect size as follows
d
M M
SD
post pre
pre
=
-
( )
where Mpre
and Mpost
are the average score before and after
the trial. SDpre
is the SD before the trial.
