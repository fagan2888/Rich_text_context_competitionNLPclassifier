Abstract
Background: Studies suggest end-stage renal disease incidence and all-cause mortality rates
among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) differ by age. The association of diabetes
mellitus and hypertension with CKD across the adult lifespan is not well established.
Methods: Data from NHANES 1999­2004 were used to determine the association of risk factors
for stage 3 or 4 CKD (n = 12,518) and albuminuria (n = 12,778) by age grouping (20 to 49, 50 to
69, and 70 years). Stage 3 or 4 CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15
to 59 ml/min/1.73 m2 and albuminuria as an albumin to creatinine ratio 30 mg/g.
Results: For adults 20 to 49, 50 to 69 and 70 years of age, the prevalence ratios (95% confidence
interval) of stage 3 or 4 CKD associated with hypertension were 1.94 (0.86 ­ 4.35), 1.51 (1.09 ­
2.07), 1.31 (1.15 ­ 1.49), respectively (p-trend = 0.038). The analogous prevalence ratios (95%
confidence interval) were 3.01 (1.35 ­ 6.74), 1.61 (1.15 ­ 2.25), 1.40 (1.15 ­ 1.69), respectively, for
diagnosed diabetes mellitus (p-trend = 0.067); and 2.67 (0.53 ­ 13.4), 1.35 (0.69 ­ 2.63), 1.08 (0.78
­ 1.51), respectively, for undiagnosed diabetes mellitus (p-trend = 0.369). The prevalence ratios of
albuminuria associated with hypertension and diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus were
lower at older age (each p < 0.05).
Conclusion: Among US adults, diabetes mellitus and hypertension are associated with CKD and
albuminuria regardless of age. However, the associations were stronger at younger ages.
Background
Chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined by the presence of
albuminuria or reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR),
is common, and increasing, among adults in the United
States and worldwide. [1-3] The incidence and prevalence
of CKD increase markedly at older age.[2,4] For example,
in the Framingham Heart Study, the risk of developing
stage 3 CKD was 2.36 times higher for each 10 years older
age.[4] Additionally, the prevalence of stage 1 or 2 and
stage 3 or 4 CKD among US adults has been reported to
be 3.3 and 54 times higher, respectively, for adults 70
versus 20 to 39 years of age.[2]

Although the incidence and prevalence of CKD increases
with age, several reports have suggested that the relative
risk of adverse outcomes including end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) and mortality associated with CKD are attenuated
at older age.[5,6] While these studies have provided
important insight on outcomes among patients with
established CKD, few data are available on the impor-
tance and differential impact of risk factors for CKD across
the full adult lifespan. Similar to the age-related associa-
tion of CKD with ESRD and mortality, the relationship
between CKD and major risk factors may differ by age. To
determine the association of risk factors for stage 3 or 4
CKD and albuminuria by age grouping, we analyzed data
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES) 1999­2004. We hypothesized that hyper-
tension and diabetes mellitus are important risk factors
for CKD regardless of age but, similar to patterns observed
for outcomes among adults with CKD, these associations
would be stronger for younger adults.
Methods
NHANES 1999­2004 is a cross-sectional nationally repre-
sentative survey of the non-institutionalized civilian pop-
ulation of the United States.[7] Briefly, this study employs
a multi-stage stratified probability sample based on selec-
tion of counties, blocks, households, and persons within
households. Mexican-Americans, non-Hispanic blacks,
and older adults were over-sampled in order to improve
the precision of estimates for these groups. NHANES
1999­2004 consisted of an in-home interview and a med-
ical evaluation and blood sample collection in a mobile
examination center. Overall, 15,332 participants com-
pleted the medical evaluation and study interview. Partic-
ipants without serum creatinine measurements, estimated
GFR (eGFR) < 15 ml/min/1.73 m2, and pregnant women
were excluded from the analysis of stage 3 or 4 CKD,
resulting in a sample size of 12,518 participants. For the
analysis of albuminuria, individuals missing urinary albu-
min or urinary creatinine measurements and pregnant or
menstruating women were excluded, resulting in a total
sample size of 12,778 participants. Women and non-His-
panic blacks were more likely than men and non-His-
panic whites to be missing serum creatinine while older
participants and non-Hispanic blacks were more likely
than younger individuals and non-Hispanic whites to be
missing urinary albumin or urinary creatinine data.
Of relevance to the current analysis, variables collected
during the in-home interview were age, race-ethnicity,
gender, cigarette smoking, a previous diagnosis of diabe-
tes mellitus, cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction
or stroke) and pharmacologic treatment for hypertension,
high cholesterol, or diabetes mellitus. Self-report of a
prior diagnosis of diabetes mellitus with current use of an
oral hypoglycemic agent or insulin was used to define
diagnosed diabetes mellitus. Body mass index (BMI) was
calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in
meters squared; obesity was defined as BMI 30 kg/m2.
Three blood pressure measurements were obtained using
a standard protocol and hypertension was defined as an
average systolic or diastolic blood pressure 140 mmHg
or 90 mmHg, respectively, or current use of blood pres-
sure lowering medication.[8]
Total cholesterol was measured with the Hitachi 704 Ana-
lyzer; high cholesterol was defined as total cholesterol
240 mg/dL or pharmacologic lipid lowering treatment. A
sample of NHANES 1999­2004 participants were
assigned to attend a morning study visit to the mobile
examination center after an overnight fast. For partici-
pants who attended the morning study visit, glucose was
measured on previously frozen plasma. Among partici-
pants without diagnosed diabetes mellitus who attended
a morning study visit and fasted 8 hours or longer (N =
5597 for the stage 3 or 4 CKD analyses and N = 5507 for
the albuminuria analyses), undiagnosed diabetes mellitus
was defined as plasma glucose 126 mg/dL.
Serum creatinine was measured using the modified
kinetic method of Jaffe (Hitachi 917 analyzer). Serum cre-
atinine concentrations were calibrated to the assays used
for the development of the Modification of Diet in Renal
Disease (MDRD) study equation.[9] The simplified
MDRD study equation was used to calculate eGFR.[10]
Individuals with an eGFR of 15 to 59 ml/min/1.73 m2
were considered to have stage 3 or 4 CKD.[11] Urinary
albumin was measured using a solid-phase fluorescence
immunoassay; urinary creatinine was measured using
modified kinetic method of Jaffe (Beckman Coulter Syn-
chron AS/Astra Analyzer). Albuminuria was defined as a
urinary albumin to urinary creatinine ratio = 30 mg/g.[11]
The results were markedly consistent when gender specific
cut-points (urinary albumin to urinary creatinine ratio =
30 mg/g for women and = 20 mg/g for men) were used to
define albuminuria and therefore are not presented.[12]
The protocols for NHANES 1999­2004 were approved by
the National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention Institutional Review
Board. All participants provided written informed con-
sent.
Statistical Methods
The prevalence of stage 3 or 4 CKD and albuminuria, sep-
arately, was calculated by age grouping (20 to 49 years, 50
to 69 years, and 70 years) for the overall population and
for individuals with and without a history of hypertension
and diabetes mellitus, separately. Characteristics of the
population were calculated, stratified by age grouping for
participants with and without stage 3 or 4 CKD and with
and without albuminuria, separately. The statistical signif-
icance of differences in the means and prevalence esti-

mates for participants with and without stage 3 or 4 CKD,
and with and without albuminuria, was determined using
linear and logistic regression models, respectively, after
adjustment for age, modeled as a continuous variable.
Prevalence ratios of stage 3 or 4 CKD and albuminuria,
separately, associated with non-Hispanic black race-eth-
nicity, female gender, cigarette smoking, obesity, hyper-
tension, high cholesterol, diagnosed and undiagnosed
diabetes mellitus, and a history of cardiovascular disease
were calculated for each age grouping, separately, using
log-binomial regression models. All regression models
included age, race-ethnicity, gender, hypertension and
diagnosed diabetes mellitus. Undiagnosed diabetes melli-
tus was not included in all regression models as fasting
plasma glucose was measured only on a sub-sample of
NHANES participants. The statistical significance of the
linear trends across age group was assessed by including
an interaction term (e.g., age group*hypertension) in the
regression model. For these models, each person within
an age grouping was assigned the median age for that
grouping (i.e., 36, 57, and 76 years for participants 20 to
49, 50 to 69, and 70 years, respectively).
Sample weights that account for the complex survey
design of NHANES including unequal probabilities of
selection, over-sampling, and non-response were applied
for all analyses using SUDAAN (Version 9.1; Research Tri-
angle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC). Standard
errors were estimated using the Taylor series linearization
method.
Results
Risk factors for stage 3­4 chronic kidney disease by age
grouping
Stage 3 or 4 CKD was progressively more common at
older age with a prevalence of 1.4%, 9.9% and 38.3%
among adults 20 to 49, 50 to 69 and 70 years of age,
respectively. The age-specific prevalence of stage 3 or 4
CKD at 20 to 49, 50 to 69 and 70 years of age was 1.5%,
11.7%, and 39.0%, respectively, among individuals with
diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes mellitus or hyperten-
sion and 1.0%, 6.6% and 27.8%, respectively, among
individuals without diabetes mellitus or hypertension.
Table S1 presents demographic characteristics and the
prevalence and level of risk factors among individuals
with and without stage 3 or 4 CKD stratified by age group
[Additional file 1]. Within each age grouping, the differ-
ence in the prevalence of cigarette smoking was not signif-
icantly different among participants with and without
CKD. Among participants 50 to 69 and 70 years of age
but not their counterparts 20 to 49 years, obesity, hyper-
tension, high cholesterol, and a history of cardiovascular
disease were more common among those with compared
to without stage 3 or 4 CKD. Within each age group, the
prevalence of diagnosed diabetes mellitus was higher
among participants with stage 3 or 4 CKD. Although undi-
agnosed diabetes mellitus was more common among
adults with stage 3 or 4 CKD within each age group, this
was not statistically significant after age-adjustment.
No patterns were present across age groups in the preva-
lence ratio of stage 3 or 4 CKD associated with gender,
race-ethnicity, cigarette smoking, obesity, or high choles-
terol [Additional file 2]. After adjustment for age, race-eth-
nicity, gender, and diagnosed diabetes mellitus, the
prevalence ratio of stage 3 or 4 CKD associated with
hypertension was lower at older age (p-trend = 0.038).
Similarly, after adjustment for age, race-ethnicity, gender,
hypertension, and diagnosed diabetes mellitus, the preva-
lence ratio of stage 3 or 4 CKD was lower at older age for
cardiovascular disease (p-trend = 0.018). Although not
statistically significant, a trend towards lower prevalence
ratios of stage 3 or 4 CKD at older age were present at
older age for diagnosed (p-trend = 0.067) and undiag-
nosed diabetes mellitus (p-trend = 0.369).
Risk factors for albuminuria by age grouping
Similar to stage 3 or 4 CKD, albuminuria was more com-
mon at older age (5.8%, 11.4% and 22.7% among adults
20 to 49, 50 to 69 and 70 years of age, respectively).
Among individuals 20 to 49, 50 to 69 and 70 years of
age, the prevalence of albuminuria was 14.0%, 14.9%,
and 26.3%, respectively, among individuals with hyper-
tension or diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes mellitus
and 3.7%, 6.9% and 14.0%, respectively, for those with-
out diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes mellitus or hyper-
tension.
Although not statistically significant for all age groups,
cigarette smoking and a history of cardiovascular disease
were more common among participants with albuminu-
ria within each age grouping [Additional file 3]. In con-
trast, among adults = 70 years of age, high cholesterol was
less common among those with albuminuria. Among all
age groups, the prevalence of obesity, hypertension, and
diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus was higher
among those with, compared to without, albuminuria.
Although no patterns in the prevalence ratio of albuminu-
ria associated with black race-ethnicity, cigarette smoking,
and cardiovascular disease were present across age group,
progressively weaker associations of albuminuria with
female gender, obesity, and high cholesterol at older age
groups were present [Additional file 4]. After adjustment
for age, race-ethnicity, gender, and diagnosed diabetes
mellitus, the prevalence ratio of albuminuria associated
with hypertension was progressively lower in the older
age groupings (p = 0.019). Similar patterns of lower prev-
alence ratios of albuminuria at older age groupings were
present for diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus
(p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively).

Discussion
In the current study, associations were present between
diagnosed diabetes mellitus and stage 3 or 4 CKD for all
age groups. Additionally, although not statistically signif-
icant among the youngest age group, associations were
present between hypertension and stage 3 or 4 CKD.
However, for both hypertension and diagnosed diabetes,
these associations were stronger among younger adults.
Also associations between hypertension and diagnosed or
undiagnosed diabetes mellitus with albuminuria were
present across the adult lifespan but were stronger for
younger adults. Also, a substantial proportion of adults =
70 years of age who were free of diabetes mellitus and
hypertension had stage 3 or 4 CKD or albuminuria.
Recent studies have investigated differences in ESRD and
mortality across age grouping among patients with stage 3
through 5 CKD not on dialysis.[5,6] In a study of over 2
million US veterans, the relative risk of mortality associ-
ated with lower eGFR was substantially higher for
younger, compared to older, adults.[5] In a separate anal-
ysis of data for 209,622 patients with eGFR <60 ml/min/
1.73 m2 not on dialysis, the crude rates and multivariable-
adjusted hazard ratios of ESRD within each eGFR strata
was lower at older age.[13] Also, in a study from South-
ampton and South-West Hampshire, United Kingdom,
the standardized mortality ratio of mortality was lower at
older age for adults with persistent elevated serum creati-
nine (1.7 mg/dL for six months or longer).[14]
While several studies have investigated risk factors for
CKD and albuminuria, few data are available on these
associations by age group. In an analysis of the Cardiovas-
cular Health Study, an observational study of community-
dwelling adults 65 years of age at baseline, hypertension
and cigarette smoking were associated with a decline in
renal function among individuals who were free of diabe-
tes mellitus.[15] In the Coronary Artery Risk Develop-
ment in Young Adults study, a study of adults 18 to 28
years of age at baseline, glucose levels and change in systo-
lic blood pressure were associated with elevated serum
creatinine after 15 years of follow-up among both men
and women. Also, among 2122 Bogalusa Heart Study par-
ticipants with a mean age of 26.0 to 26.5 years, higher
systolic and diastolic blood pressure was associated with
an increased risk of albuminuria.[16] The current study
extends these previous studies by demonstrating the
importance of hypertension and diabetes mellitus as risk
factors for stage 3 or 4 CKD and albuminuria across the
full adult lifespan from age 20 through 80 years in a large
nationally representative sample of US adults.
The weaker association of hypertension and diabetes mel-
litus with stage 3 or 4 CKD and albuminuria at older age
and high prevalence of these conditions among older
adults without hypertension or diabetes mellitus suggests
that other factors may contribute to the high prevalence of
kidney disease in older adults. For example, nephrotoxic
agents that adults are exposed to over their life course may
explain the higher rate of kidney disease as people age.
Previous studies have reported environmental exposures
including lead and cadmium are more common at older
age and are associated with the development of kidney
disease.[17,18] Also, older adults have higher rates of
exposure to potentially nephrotoxic medications (e.g.,
acetaminophen) and medical tests (e.g., angiograms) that
may increase their risk of kidney disease. [19-21] Addi-
tionally, local obstructive processes are more common in
older adults and may play a role in the development of
CKD and albuminuria.[22] Atherosclerosis is another
possible factor contributing to the high burden of stage 3
or 4 CKD and albuminuria among older adults. Athero-
sclerosis is very common among older adults and can
affect the renal vasculature resulting directly in renal dam-
age.[23,24]. Also, the presence of more severe atheroscle-
rosis may be a marker for developing heart failure
resulting in decreased renal perfusion. A study by Shlipak
and colleagues found, after multivariable adjustment,
among adults  65 years of age without a history of clini-
cal cardiovascular disease, an ankle-brachial index <0.9
was associated with a 1.61 times higher risk of a rapid
decline in eGFR defined as  -3 ml/min/1.73 m2/
year.[25]. Additionally, participants in their study with a
common carotid intima-medial thickness  1.19 and
internal carotid intima-medial thickness  1.82 were 1.34
and 1.41 times more likely to have a rapid decline in
eGFR, respectively. The current study did not have data on
sub-clinical atherosclerosis, precluding investigation of
increased levels of this risk factor on the development of
stage 3 or 4 CKD and albuminuria.
As prevalence ratios depend on the baseline disease risk
(i.e., the risk of disease in the unexposed group), the
attenuation of prevalence ratios at older age may be a sta-
tistical anomaly resulting from the high prevalence of
stage 3 or 4 CKD and albuminuria among older adults.
However, the absolute difference in the prevalence of
hypertension and diabetes mellitus for those with and
without stage 3 or 4 CKD and albuminuria was also larger
among younger versus older adults. The consistency of
larger associations of hypertension and diabetes mellitus
with stage 3 or 4 CKD and albuminuria among younger
adults, (i.e., using absolute differences or prevalence
ratios) highlights the importance of these risk factors
among younger adults. Furthermore, the age-dependent
association between hypertension and diabetes with CKD
suggests that it may be a different physiologic condition
when present in younger versus older adults. Future stud-
ies are needed to evaluate these differences by age.
The results of the current study demonstrate the impor-
tance of hypertension and diabetes mellitus on kidney

disease in young adults. However, its important to recog-
nize the low prevalence of stage 3 or 4 CKD among adults
< 50 years of age with hypertension or diabetes mellitus.
While a previous analysis showed population-wide
screening for albuminuria was not cost-effective, there
was a clear beneficial cost-effectiveness ratio for screening
adults with hypertension or diabetes mellitus regardless of
their age.[26] Also, a scientific advisory statement from
the American Heart Association, developed in conjunc-
tion with the National Kidney Foundation, recommended
measuring serum creatinine, to screen for stage 3 or 4
CKD, for all adults with hypertension or diabetes mellitus
including those under 50 years of age.[27]
Limitations and Strengths
The relatively small number of NHANES 1999­2004
study participants under 50 years of age with stage 3 or 4
CKD is a major limitation of the current analysis. As such,
adequate statistical power was not available to detect
small associations of risk factors with stage 3 or 4 CKD in
this age group. An additional limitation is the cross-sec-
tional study design of NHANES 1999­2004. Although we
studied established risk factors for stage 3 or 4 CKD, cau-
tion should be taken when inferring causality based on
the results of the current study. Also, as with any large-
scale epidemiologic study, NHANES 1999­2004 relied on
the MDRD study equation to estimate GFR and determine
the presence of stage 3 or 4 CKD. Rule and colleagues
reported that the MDRD underestimates GFR in healthy
individuals. [28] The differential impact of the MDRD
study equation on classifying CKD by age group warrants
further study. Finally, we relied on fasting plasma glucose
and not an oral glucose tolerance test to define the pres-
ence of diabetes mellitus. Therefore, we may have under-
estimated the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes
mellitus in our sample. However, it is unlikely that this
occurred differentially by age grouping.
One of the major strengths of the current study was its
large sample which permitted us to perform analyses for
three separate age categories. In addition, NHANES 1999­
2004 provides data that represents the non-institutional-
ized civilian US population that were collected following
standardized protocols and data were available to analyze
stage 3 or 4 CKD and albuminuria, separately. Few epide-
miologic data are available on the presence of albuminu-
ria among older adults. The consistency of the trends of
lower prevalence ratios for both stage 3 or 4 CKD and
albuminuria at older age is noteworthy.
Conclusion
In conclusion, hypertension and diabetes mellitus are
associated with stage 3 or 4 CKD and albuminuria across
the full adult age range. Importantly, this association was
statistically significantly stronger at younger age group-
ings. The low overall prevalence of stage 3 or 4 CKD
among adults <50 years of age may mask the increased
risk of CKD among individuals with hypertension or dia-
betes mellitus. Further research is needed to better define
the differential impact of risk factors for the development
of stage 3 or 4 CKD and albuminuria by age group. Addi-
tionally, studies aimed at the identification of novel risk
factors for stage 3 or 4 CKD and albuminuria, especially
among older adults, are warranted.
