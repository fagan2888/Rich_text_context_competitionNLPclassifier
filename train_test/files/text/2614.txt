Background. In adults and children with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, a polymorphism in the
interleukin 6 (IL-6) promoter at position 174 predicts illness magnitude. In addition, polymorphisms in the
interleukin 10 (IL-10), tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a), and interferon g (IFN-g) genes are associated with
immune responsiveness and the frequency of complications. Here, the effect of these polymorphisms on illness
and seroconversion during infection with rhinovirus type 39 (RV39) was evaluated.
Methods. Seventy-two adults were genotyped for the selected polymorphisms, experimentally exposed to RV39,
and followed to track infection, seroconversion, and symptoms and signs of illness. Regression analysis was used
to determine whether these polymorphisms predicted seroconversion and illness magnitude in 57 infected subjects.
Results. The low-production IL-6 174 phenotype (C/C genotype) was associated with greater symptom
magnitudes, and the IFN-g phenotype +874 predicted the frequency of seroconversion. No relationship between
the IL-10 or TNF-a polymorphisms and any measured outcome was documented. The concentration of IL-6
protein, as measured in nasal wash fluids from subjects, was positively correlated with symptom magnitude, but
it was independent of the IL-6 174 genotypes representing the high- and low-production phenotypes.
Conclusions. These results document statistically significant associations between the IL-6 174 and IFN-g
+874 polymorphisms and specific responses to experimental RV39 infection. For the IL-6 174 polymorphism,
the results replicate those for experimental RSV infection.
Coldlike illness (CLI) is the most common disease af-
fecting humans. The majority of CLIs are caused by a
viral upper respiratory tract infection (vURTI), which
could be due to any of a number of viruses, including
rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza
virus, coronavirus, and enterovirus, among others [1,
2]. Although CLIs are usually self-limited, they cause
significant morbidity and are known precipitants of

complications in the sinuses, lungs, and middle ears
[3].
During a vURTI, a CLI is usually diagnosed on the
basis of the perceived significance of the expressed signs
and symptoms of illness. The viral symptom and sign
complex (vSSC) is a summary measure of the degree
of illness defined by the magnitudes and durations of
those symptom and sign elements typically associated
with a vURTI [4]. The vSSC elements are similar for
the different causal viruses [1, 5] and are believed to
represent the overt expression of the host immune and
inflammatory responses to a vURTI [6]. This com-
monality suggests that these viruses provoke their vSSCs
and cause CLIs via activation of similar immune and
inflammatory pathways.
Cytokines are known to orchestrate and coordinate
the host immune and inflammatory responses during
a vURTI [7, 8]. For example, assays of serial nasal wash
specimens from adult subjects experimentally infected
with rhinovirus, RSV, influenza virus, and coronavirus
document consistent patterns of interleukin 1 (IL-1),
200 · JID 2010:201 (15 January) · Doyle et al
interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8), and interleukin 10
(IL-10) production in nasal secretion that temporally track the
vSSC and respond appropriately to interventions and factors
that modulate the vSSC [4, 9­16].
In the population of individuals with a vURTI, the vSSC is
variable, such that not all vURTIs are associated with a CLI
[17], and past studies have documented a variety of factors
that modulate the vSSC and consequently CLI expression [18].
Regarding the latter, a study of natural RSV infection in infants
[19] and a follow-up study of experimental RSV infection in
adults [20] reported that the C/C genotype of a single-nucle-
otide polymorphism in the IL-6 promoter at position 174
was associated with a greater vSSC. The primary hypothesis
tested in the present study was that this IL-6 genotype is as-
sociated with a greater vSSC and a more prolonged CLI during
experimental infection with another virus, rhinovirus type 39
(RV39). Because the studies of RSV also documented the effects
of polymorphisms in the IL-10, interferon g (IFN-g), and tu-
mor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) genes on immune responses
and complication expression, a secondary hypothesis tested in
the present study was that these polymorphisms also affect the
host responses to RV39 infection [19, 20].
METHODS
Healthy adult subjects were recruited by advertisement. The
protocol, study methods, and potential risks were explained to
the recruited subjects; written informed consent for study par-
ticipation and for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
screening was obtained; and a general physical examination was
performed and a health history taken for each recruit at screen-
ing. From the subjects who were not excluded for medical
reasons, standard demographic information was collected;
blood was drawn for total and differential blood cell counts,
clinical chemical analysis, and assays of serum RV39 neutral-
izing antibody titer and HIV antibodies; urine was collected
for clinical urinalysis; and buccal swabs were collected for DNA
isolation.
Seventy-two healthy (according to history, physical exami-
nation, total and differential blood cell count, blood chemistry,
urine profile, and negative test result for HIV antibodies), sus-
ceptible (RV39 serum antibody titer, !4), adult (18­55 years
old) subjects were enrolled. Two days before admittance to
cloister (day 2), blood was drawn from each subject for repeat
assay of serum RV39 neutralizing antibody titer. Subjects were
then admitted to the cloister site, where they were confined to
an isolated floor of a hotel for 6 days (day 0, 24-h preexposure
period; days 1­5, sequential 24-h postexposure periods). On
day 0, female subjects with positive urine pregnancy test results
were excluded, as were subjects presenting with a CLI. At the
end of day 0, each subject was inoculated with RV39 by direct
instillation of course drops to the nasal mucosa at an estimated
dose of 100 times the median tissue culture infective dose
[21]. On each day of cloister, all subjects underwent a general
physical examination as well as an examination of the ears,
nose, and throat and completed a symptom diary; in addition,
nasal mucociliary clearance function was assessed, nasal secre-
tion production was measured, and a nasal wash was per-
formed, with samples aliquoted and frozen at 70C for later
assay. Throughout the study period, subjects were not permitted
to take prescription or over-the-counter medications, with the
exception of acetaminophen (which was dispensed by study
personnel) and birth control drugs. At the end of day 5, the
subjects were interviewed by a physician, provided with specific
instructions for follow-up, and discharged from cloister. On or
around study day 28, a convalescent blood sample was drawn
from each subject. The study protocol and informed consent
forms were approved by the institutional review boards at the
University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University.
Virology. The challenge virus was a safety-tested strain of
RV39. RV39 serum neutralizing antibodies were assayed at
screening, on day 2, and on day 28 by a standard 2-fold
dilution method, with titers reported as reciprocals of the final
dilution [22]. Seroconversion was defined as a 4-fold increase
in titer between days 2 and 28. A sample of nasal wash fluid
from each subject on each study day was placed (3:1, vol/vol)
in a cryovial containing 4 concentrated virus collecting broth
and then frozen at 70C. For RV39 detection, the sample was
thawed, 0.2 mL of the mixture was inoculated into tubes of
human embryonic lung fibroblast cells, and the cells were ob-
served for rhinovirus cytopathic effect [22]. Infection was de-
fined as detection of the challenge virus on any of days 1­5.
A variable representing infection duration, "days shed," was
constructed as the sum of the days on which RV39 was isolated.
DNA isolation, genotyping, and phenotype assignment.
Genomic DNA was isolated from the buccal cells by means of
a QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen), amplified using a Repli-g
Whole Genome Amplification kit (Qiagen), and quantified with
a Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay kit (Invitrogen) [23]. The
primer and probe sequences for the cytokine genotype assays
were based on those used in previous publications for IL-6
174 [24]; TNF-a 308 [25]; IL-10 1082, 819, and 592
[25]; and IFN-g +874 [26]. Genotyping was performed with a
TaqMan Genotyping Master mix (Applied Biosystems) accord-
ing to a published protocol [27]. The 7300 System SDS software
(version 1.4; Applied Biosystems) was used for instrument con-
trol, automated data collection, and genotype assignment.
Phenotypes corresponding to in vitro cytokine production
by stimulated lymphocytes [24, 28­33] were assigned to each
genotype, using the convention published by Gentile and col-
leagues [19]. Specifically, for IL-6 174, the G/G and G/C
genotypes were assigned to the high-production phenotype and
C/C to the low-production phenotype; for TNF-a 308, the
Cytokine Polymorphisms and RV39 Illness · JID 2010:201 (15 January) · 201
G/A and A/A genotypes were assigned to the high-production
phenotype and G/G to the low-production phenotype; for IFN-
g +874, the T/T genotype was assigned to the high-production
phenotype, T/A to the intermediate-production phenotype, and
A/A to the low-production phenotype; and for IL-10 1082,
819, and 592, the GCC/GCC haplotype was assigned to the
high-production phenotype, GCC/ACC and GCC/ATA to the
intermediate-production phenotype, and ACC/ACC, ACC/
ATA, and ATA/ATA to the low-production phenotype. For IFN-
g +874 and IL-10 1082, 819, and 592, phenotypes were
coded as 1 for low production, 2 for intermediate production,
and 3 for high production; for TNF-a 308 and IL-6 174,
phenotypes were coded as 1 for low production and 2 for high
production.
IL-6 protein assay. One aliquot of the nasal wash fluid
collected on each day from each of 65 subjects was thawed and
assayed for IL-6 by means of a commercially available enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (BioSource) [34]. The lower de-
tection limit of the assay was 0.1 pg/mL. For each subject, a
summary variable for IL-6 production was constructed as the
log of the baseline-adjusted IL-6 concentrations summed over
the 5 postexposure days of cloister. Summed values that were
!0 were assigned a value of .
log(0.1) p 1
Symptom assessment. Thirteen vSSC elements were eval-
uated by means of a self-completed diary on each study day,
using a 4-point scale (none, mild, moderate, or severe). These
elements represented 4 symptom domains: nasal symptoms
(rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and sneezing), throat symptoms
(sore throat and cough), general symptoms (headache, malaise,
chills, sweats, and fever), and complication symptoms (earache,
chest congestion, and sinus pain). For each element, the base-
line score on day 0 was subtracted from the score on each of
the 5 postchallenge days. Summary variables for each domain
and for the total symptom score were calculated as the sum
over all days of the baseline-adjusted scores for all contained
elements (negative summed values were assigned a value of 0).
The daily diary included a question as to the presence or ab-
sence of a "cold." A continuous variable, "cold days," was con-
structed by summing the yes responses over days 1­5.
Objective sign assessment. On each cloister day, subjects
expelled their nasal secretions into preweighed tissues and
sealed the tissues in plastic bags of known weight. At the end
of each 24-h period, the bags with the expended tissues were
weighed, and the secretion weight (ie, the nasal secretion pro-
duction) was determined by subtraction [21]. Nasal mucoci-
liary clearance function was measured by placing 20 mL of a
dyed saccharin solution bilaterally onto the anterior aspect of
the inferior turbinate using a calibrated pipette. The nasal mu-
cociliary clearance time was calculated as the difference between
the time when the solution was placed and the time when the
subject reported a sweet taste [35]. Summary nasal secretion
production and mucociliary clearance time variables were cal-
culated as the baseline-adjusted sum of the values over days 1­
5. Because these summary variables were not normally distrib-
uted, the data for both were log-transformed, and values that
were !0 were assigned a value of .
log(0.1) p 1
Data analysis. The 9 continuous outcome variables were
the log of the summary nasal secretion weight, mucociliary
clearance time, and IL-6 concentration; the summary nasal,
throat, general, complication, and total symptom scores; and
the number of cold days. The presence or absence of serocon-
version was treated as a dichotomous outcome variable. The
potential predictor variables consisted of the IL-6, IL-10, TNF-
a, and IFN-g phenotypes, day 2 RV39 titer, number of virus-
shedding days, age in years, race (white was coded as 1, and
all other races were coded as 2), and sex (female was coded as
1, and male was coded as 2). To determine whether these var-
iables were statistically significant predictors of each continuous
outcome variable, multiple regression analysis was used. To
determine whether these variables were statistically significant
predictors of seroconversion, logistic regression was used. The
relationships between the log of the baseline-adjusted IL-6 pro-
tein concentration and the continuous outcome variables were
evaluated using simple linear regression. All statistical proce-
dures were performed using NCSS 2000 Statistical Package soft-
ware (Kaysville). Unless otherwise indicated, data are presented
as mean  standard deviation.
RESULTS
Of the 72 enrolled subjects, 8 had a serum RV39 titer of 14
on study day 2 and were defined by the protocol as non-
susceptible. In addition, 5 subjects from whom RV39 was not
recovered on any day were defined as uninfected (no "wild"
viruses were isolated from any nasal secretion sample), and 2
subjects did not have buccal samples available for cytokine
genotype analysis. The data for these 15 subjects were elimi-
nated from the data set.
Of the remaining 57 subjects, 31 were male, 36 were white,
and the mean age was years. The data for demo-
30.3  10.7
graphics, symptoms and signs, virology assays, and genotype
data for IFN-g +874 and TNF-a 308 were complete for all
subjects. The genotype assay for IL-6 174 and the haplotype
assay for IL-10 1082, 819, and 592 failed for 1 and 3
subjects, respectively. IL-6 protein concentrations in nasal se-
cretions collected on each study day were available for 51
subjects.
None of the cytokine genotype distributions deviated sig-
nificantly from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The distribution
of cytokine phenotypes was as follows: for TNF-a, 12 for high
and 45 for low production; for IL-6, 47 for high and 9 for low
production; for IFN-g, 9 for high, 24 for intermediate, and 24
for low production; and for the IL-10 haplotype, 16 for high,

and a marginally significant predictor of lower complication

higher summary nasal, throat, complication, and total scores.
The low-production IL-6 174 phenotype was a significant
predictor of more cold days and higher general and total symp-
tom scores and was a marginally significant predictor of higher
nasal and complication symptom scores. Neither the TNF-a
308 nor the IL-10 1082, 819, or 592 phenotype was
significantly associated with any outcome variable.
Figure 1 shows the baseline-adjusted mean daily symptom
scores in each of the 4 domains and total symptoms for groups
defined by the low- and high-production IL-6 174 pheno-
types. With the exception of the throat symptom score, the
mean scores for the other domains and for total symptoms
were greater on most days among the subjects with the low-
production phenotype (ie, C/C) compared with the subjects
with the high-production phenotype (ie, C/G and G/G).
The multiple regression analysis was overspecified for the
contribution of all possible predictors to the log baseline-ad-
justed total IL-6 protein concentration. Limiting the possible
predictors to the cytokine phenotypes, number of days shed,
and baseline RV39 titer produced no significant effect of any

DISCUSSION
There is a vast literature relating cytokine polymorphisms to
various inflammatory and infectious diseases, but few studies
have examined the possible role played by these polymorphisms
in modulating the various expressions of a vURTI. One study
of RSV infection in hospitalized infants reported that the low-
production IL-6 174 phenotype was associated with greater
illness severity, and a study of experimental RSV infection in
adults reported that the low-production IL-6 174 phenotype
204 · JID 2010:201 (15 January) · Doyle et al
was associated with a greater vSSC. The results of the present
study of experimental RV39 infection in adults are consistent
with those findings and support our primary hypothesis. Spe-
cifically, the low-production IL-6 174 phenotype predicted a
greater vSSC and greater symptom scores for most symptom
domains in the RV39-infected subjects, with the effect realized
across all postexposure days (Figure 1). Although the IL-6 174
phenotype had no effect on the 2 objective illness measures
(nasal secretion production and mucociliary clearance time),
these outcome variables were also not predicted by the IL-6
174 phenotype in adults experimentally infected with RSV
[20].
The results of 2 other studies support the hypothesis that
the IL-6 174 phenotype has an effect on vURTI expression
as reflected in the frequency of a common vURTI complication,
otitis media [36]. Specifically, in a cross-sectional study Patel
and colleagues [37] reported that the low-production IL-6
174 phenotype was significantly more frequent in children
with a history of recurrent acute otitis media compared with
children without a history of otitis media, and in a longitudinal
study of young children Alper and colleagues [23] reported that
the low-production IL-6 174 phenotype was a significant pre-
dictor of the otitis media coincidence rate for rhinovirus
infections.
A second objective of this study was to explore the effect of
TNF-a 308, IFN-g +874, and IL-10 592, 819, and 1082
polymorphisms on the host responses to RV39 infection. These
polymorphisms were shown to affect other host responses dur-
ing RSV infection [20] and the rate of vURTI complications
[19, 23, 37]. For the outcomes examined in this study, only
the IFN-g +874 polymorphism was shown to have a significant
effect, with its phenotype being an inverse predictor of the rate
of seroconversion during RV39 infection. In adults experi-
mentally infected with RSV, the TNF-a 308 phenotype was
directly related to the frequency of seroconversion, whereas the
IFN-g +874 phenotype was indirectly related to the frequency
of subjects developing a 2-fold increase in nasal RSV-specific
secretory immunoglobulin A antibody titers [20]. In the present
study, the lack of significant effects of the other cytokine poly-
morphisms may be explained by their primary effects in pre-
vious studies on vURTI complications such as the frequencies
of otitis media and pneumonia [19, 23, 37], events that were
not observed in the present study.
From these results, there is sufficient evidence to advance
the hypothesis that the IL-6 174 C/C genotype (low-pro-
duction phenotype) is associated with up-regulated inflam-
matory responses to a vURTI as reflected in the vSSC and the
frequency of expressed complications. Although the mecha-
nism(s) by which that polymorphism exerts these effects re-
mains elusive, given the complex and poorly understood tem-
poral interactions among the various cytokines and other
inflammatory chemicals in provoking the vSSC and other ex-
pressions of a vURTI [4], the simplest hypothesis can be re-
jected. Specifically, as reported here and in past studies [12, 14,
16], higher nasal IL-6 concentrations are positively correlated
in both phase and magnitude with the expressed vSSC, leading
to the expectation that the high-production IL-6 174 phe-
notype would predict higher nasal IL-6 concentrations and con-
sequently greater illness magnitudes. However, neither of these
expectations was supported by the experimental data; that is,
no statistically significant relationship was demonstrated be-
tween the IL-6 174 phenotype and local IL-6 nasal secretion
concentration for either experimental RV39 or experimental
RSV infection in adults [20], and for all studies reviewed the
low-production (not the high-production) IL-6 174 pheno-
type predicted greater illness and complications [19, 20, 23,
37].
In interpreting these results, it should be recognized that the
cytokine phenotypes were assigned on the basis of in vitro
results for stimulated cytokine release by leukocytes that may
[28, 30, 38] or may not relate to in vivo cytokine production
in the nasal mucosa, blood [39, 40], and local secretions [20]
during a vURTI. Moreover, there are a large number of poly-
morphisms in the genes for IL-6 and other cytokines that were
not assayed in the present study but that have the potential to
interact with the assayed polymorphisms to influence cytokine
production [33, 41­44], and past studies have shown that the
local production of specific cytokines was influenced by poly-
morphisms in the genes for other cytokines (eg, the TNF-a
308 polymorphism predicted IL-6 and IL-8 protein concen-
trations in nasal secretions) [20]. These observations emphasize
the difficulties of predicting cytokine production for any bio-
logical compartment in response to a vURTI using the geno-
type-phenotype associations for a given cytokine polymorphism
on the basis of in vitro studies.
In conclusion, the present study documents statistically sig-
nificant effects of certain cytokine polymorphisms on selected
expressions of RV39 infection. Limitations of this study include
the relatively few cytokine polymorphisms assayed, the assay
of only IL-6 protein in nasal secretions, and the restriction of
outcomes to seroconversion, provoked symptoms, and 2 ob-
jective measures of illness. In addition, because this study was
limited to adults, in whom the frequency of vURTI compli-
cations is low, the effects of these cytokine polymorphisms on
complication frequency could not be assessed. Nonetheless, it
is highly likely that continued study of cytokine polymorphisms
in the settings of natural and experimental vURTIs will yield
important information regarding the genetic basis for CLIs,
vURTIs, and vURTI complications.
