CVD Mortality, 1968-1978: Observations and Implications
KENNETH G. MANTON, P H . D . , * AND HERBERT M. BAUM, P H . D . !
SUMMARY U.S. multiple cause of death data were examined for the period 1968-1978. Specifically, the
role of cerebrovascular disease mortality as an underlying and associated cause of death was studied. The
number of deaths where cerebrovascular disease was cited as the underlying cause of death declined much
faster than the number of deaths where cerebrovascular disease was cited as the associated cause of death.
This trend is indicative of a possible change in the role of cerebrovascular disease as an associated cause of
death. Cause elimination life tables were constructed for cerebrovascular disease as the underlying cause of
death and as any cause of death. In the general population, eliminating stroke as a cause of death is
projected to have less impact in 1978 than in 1968, for men than for women, and for whites than for
nonwhites. Tables were also constructed to examine the life expectancy gains for the group of individuals
who died of cerebrovascular disease. For these individuals, the gain in life expectancy at birth ranges from 9
years for white males to 18 years for nonwhite females.

THE MARKED DECLINE in the mortality rates for
cerebrovascular disease as an underlying cause from
the later 1960's through the 1970's has been well docu-
mented.13 However, a number of epidemiological
studies (e.g., Kuller et al,9"12 Florey et al13 14) have
documented the facts that a.) stroke frequently appears
on death certificates when some other condition is se-
lected as an underlying cause of death and b) that
stroke as a contributing cause of death often presents a
clinically similar picture to those occasions when it
appears as an underlying cause of death. Hence, the
question is raised in the studies whether the impact of
stroke on mortality is accurately represented by under-
lying cause of death statistics.
Not only have these epidemiological studies sug-
gested the necessity of examining the nonunderlying
cause occurrence of stroke on death certificates but
there are many other studies that suggest the necessity
of using multiple cause mortality data to understand
the linkages and interactions between various chronic
diseases." Indeed the importance of multiple cause
data and concepts for examining chronic disease mor-
tality has been stressed since 1917 with primary limita-
tions to such studies having been the limitations of the
available data system. We are fortunate, therefore, that
NCHS has recently made multiple cause mortality data
a component of its mortality data reporting system
starting with the 1979 public use mortality tapes. They
have also recreated the tapes for the period 1968 to
1978. Thus the recent availability of multiple cause of
death data warrants a review of the recent trend of
stroke mortality to determine if the decline could be
explained by a change in how cerebrovascular disease
is coded as a cause of death. In addition, despite the
trend being well documented, the implications of the
decline with respect to changes in life expectancy de-
serve greater attention.

In order to comprehend mortality trends it is neces-
sary to understand the standard terms used on a death
certificate and how this information is coded. Causes
of death are cited on two parts of the certificate. Part I
on the death certificate is designed to be used by the
physician to list the morbid conditions which define
the causal sequence leading to death. Usually, but not
always, the underlying cause of death will be selected
as the condition on the "lowest used line" of Part I.
Part II of the death certificate is to be used by the
physician to list any other significant medical condi-
tions which contributed to death but which were not
part of the causal chain indicated in Part I.
In standard statistical computations all of the medi-
cal information on Parts I and II is summarized in the
selection of a single condition to represent the underly-
ing cause of death. The underlying cause of death is
defined to be the cause which began a morbid process
that lead to death. In this paper, any condition which is
not the underlying cause of death is referred to as an
"associated" cause of death. A condition which is an
underlying or associated cause of death is referred to as
"any" cause of death. Using the medical condition
listed on the death certificate in this way is consistent
with the Twentieth World Health Assembly which de-
fined the causes of death to be entered in the cause of
death statement as "all those diseases, morbid condi-
tions or injuries which either resulted in or contributed
to death."15
The improved clinical management of cerebrovas-
cular events, coupled with an improved understanding
of the mechanism of these events, has resulted in a
reevaluation on how physicians view a "stroke".
Strokes are now viewed as both preventable and treat-
able. If current methods of prevention and treatment
are succeeding then survival rates should be improv-
ing. Examination of the coding of cerebrovascular dis-
ease as an underlying or an associated cause of death
will enable us to determine if part of the decline in the
reporting of cerebrovascular disease as an underlying
cause of death is a shift to coding it as an associated
cause of death. Such a shift might be interpreted as
evidence that there has been an improvement in the
management of these events.

Though mortality rates for cerebrovascular diseases
have declined markedly, this does not necessarily
mean that the lifetime significance of cerebrovascular
diseases has declined to a similar degree. This results
from the fact that cerebrovascular diseases, as well as
many other chronic diseases, tend to contribute pro-
portionately more to mortality at older ages. Hence,
mortality reductions which increase the number of per-
sons surviving to advanced ages will tend to increase
the lifetime contributions of the major chronic disease
to total mortality. Furthermore the results of Kuller et
al." are instructive in that they suggest the symptoms
expressed where stroke was an underlying versus non-
underlying cause of death on the certificate are the
same. Hence, nonunderlying cause mentions of the
stroke may represent as severe and life threatening a
disease process as when it is the underlying cause. In
this case, for either rate or life expectancy calculations,
the multiple cause data would present a more accurate
perception of the implications of the disease process.
To determine the implications of current declines in
mortality rates for the total lifetime significance of
cerebrovascular diseases, calculations on the change in
life expectancy attributable to the control of stroke as a
cause of death are presented.
The standard measures of the lifetime consequences
of specific causes of death are calculated in ways that
average the effect of the disease over all persons in the
population. Since the mortality risk associated with
cerebrovascular disease is, clearly, not distributed
equally over each member of the population, such cal-
culations do not tell us about the impact of the disease
upon affected individuals. As a consequence life ex-
pectancy measures are calculated in a way so that they
reflect the change in life span for persons directly af-
fected by the disease. This would seem to give a more
accurate picture of the actual changes in survival that
could be expected clinically if the disease processes
were eliminated.
In this paper, the mortality consequences of cerebro-
vascular disease are evaluated in three ways: 1) the role
of stroke as an associated cause of death, 2) the impact
of recent stroke mortality declines on the entire life
span of the general population, and 3) the conse-
quences of changes in the mortality rates for cerebro-
vascular diseases on those who would have died from a
cerebrovascular event. It is hoped that this treatment of
the problem will be a more realistic portrayal of the
population implications of the trends.
Methods
These analyses employ cause-specific mortality data
for the United States, provided by the National Center
for Health Statistics for the period 1968-1978. They
differ from the usual mortality data in that all medical
conditions reported on the death certificate are coded.
Previous analyses have used only the ACME (Auto-
mated Classification of Medical Entities) coded under-
lying cause of death. Throughout the study period,
data were coded according to the 8th Revision of
the International Classification of Diseases, Adapted
(ICDA). This prevents artifacts being engendered by
revisions in the coding scheme.
A code of 430-438 is considered to be a cerebrovas-
cular event. If these codes are not present anywhere on
the death certificate, the death is considered to be non-
stroke related. The reason for using the total range
430-438 is that there are questions concerning the
precision of specific subdiagnoses. Furthermore, for
many national health policy decisions it is a trend in the
overall category that is of most significance.
Stroke is considered to be the underlying cause of
death if one of the aforementioned codes is so desig-
nated. If one of these codes is present, but not as an
underlying cause, stroke is considered to be an associ-
ated cause of death.
The results will examine: a) basic frequencies and
ratio measures for stroke as an underlying cause of
death or as any cause of death, b) life expectancy gains
attributable to the elimination of stroke as an underly-
ing or as any cause of death in the general population,
and c) life expectancy gains attributable to the elimina-
tion of stroke both as an underlying or any cause of
death among individuals who actually died of stroke.
The analyses are conducted using race/sex specific
data.
Life expectancy (e,) is the expected number of years
to be lived, on average, after a given age (x). Life
expectancy is one of many estimates derived from a
life table. The life table is a statistical model which
combines mortality data for various age groups.3 Using
current mortality patterns, age specific mortality risks
and expectations can be derived from the life table.
There are various standard methodologies for calculat-
ing life table functions, and in this paper those of
Chiang6 will be used. Additional details concerning
these methodologies are presented in the appendix.
The difference between the life expectancy under
observed conditions (ex
), and the life expectancy if the
set of deaths did not occur (elA
), represents the in-
crease in life expectancy that could be achieved by
eliminating condition " A " as a cause of death. As an
example, during 1969-1971 life expectancy was 70.8
years. If malignant neoplasms were eliminated as a
cause of death, life expectancy would be 73.2 years.7
The gain in life expectancy, 2.4 years, represents the
difference between these life expectancies. The basic
assumption of the cause elimination technique is that
mortality due to cause " A " is independent of the re-
maining causes of death. In the present context it
means that the individual who would have died of a
stroke, but did not, has an equal chance of dying from
the other remaining causes of death. An implicit as-
sumption is that cerebrovascular events would still oc-
cur but would no longer be fatal.
When calculating the expected impact of eliminat-
ing a specific cause of death, it is necessary to recog-
nize that the increases in life expectancy are averaged
over the entire population. This can hide benefits
which accrue only to those individuals who have a
given disease or condition. Therefore, additional cal-
culations were done to reflect the gain in life expectan-

cy among only those who would have died of stroke.
When reviewing the increases in life expectancy, it
is important to place them in perspective. This can be
done by examining age-specific data and relating them
to table 1. The life table functions were calculated
from single years of age data, but only reported for
selected ages. A gain of 6.5 years for a white male
aged 60 in 1978 means that the individual could expect
to live an additional 23.7 years rather than the 17.3
years shown in table 1.
Results
During the period 1968-1977, the age/race/sex stan-
dardized mortality rates for stroke (cerebrovascular
disease) declined by 32 percent (from 103.4 per
100,000 to 70.0 per 100,000), while total mortality
declined by only 18 percent (from 944.3 per 100,000
to 776.9 per 100,000). This can now be related to how
stroke was coded as a cause of death.
During the 1968-1978 period, the number of deaths
where stroke was an underlying cause declined by 16.8
percent (from 211,321 to 175,817), while the number
of deaths where stroke was any cause decreased by
11.0 percent (from 325,533 to 289,885). The ratio of
the number of deaths where stroke was cited as the
underlying cause of death was 1.54. By 1978 this had
risen to 1.64. The ratio can be interpreted as meaning
that for every ten deaths where stroke was the underly-
ing cause, there were an additional six deaths where
stroke was an associated cause. The aforementioned
ratio varies slightly by race/sex groups. In 1977 the
ratio for white males was the highest (1.72) with all
other race/sex groups having a ratio of approximately
1.61. Thus, the rate of decline of stroke mentioned as
underlying cause of death was 52.7 percent faster than
its decline mentioned anywhere on the death certifi-
cate.
Data on current life expectancy (ex
), i.e., how long a
person could be expected to live if there was no change
in the current mortality conditions, for the various age
and race/sex groups are presented in table 1. As noted
in the methods section, these life expectancies are the
comparison levels from which the gains in life expec-

1978.
tancy are then measured. The data indicate that life
expectancy at birth is greater for whites than nonwhites
and greater for females than males.
Under the hypothetical situation that both the force
of mortality due to stroke could be completely elimi-
nated and that the force of mortality due to stroke is
independent of the forces of mortality for other dis-
eases, the estimated gains in life expectancy (eK;A
-- ex
)
can be calculated. Though both these events are un-
likely, the figures serve to illustrate the total lifetime
consequences of stroke mortality given current condi-
tions. The elimination of stroke as an underlying cause
of death, in 1968, results in a gain in life expectancy at
birth of 0.90 years for white males. This means that if,
in 1968, stroke were eliminated as an underlying cause
of death, life expectancy at birth for white males would
increase from 67.5 years to 68.4 years. For ages 45, 60
and 75 the increase in life expectancy remains constant
at approximately 0.9 years. At age 75 this means that
life expectancy would increase from 8.1 years to 9.0
years. If stroke were eliminated as any cause of death,
life expectancy at birth would increase an additional
0.52 years (to 68.9 years), and life expectancy at age
75 would increase an additional 0.56 years (to 9.6
years).
The increase in life expectancy (at birth and ages 45,
60, and 75) for white females is approximately 1.4
years for eliminating stroke as an underlying cause of
death and 2.3 years for eliminating stroke as any cause
of death. Similar data for nonwhite males is about 1.5
years and 2.4 years. Nonwhite females showed the
largest increase, 2.6 years for underlying cause and 4.3
years for any cause. A comparison across the race/sex
groups indicates that the gains were smaller for men
than for women and for whites than for nonwhites.
The increases in life expectancy are smaller in 1978
than in 1968; reflecting the decline in mortality. If
stroke were eliminated as a cause of death in 1978, the
increase in life expectancy among white males would
be approximately 0.7 years for underlying cause and
1.3 years for any cause. Among white females the
increase would be 1.2 years and 2.0 years. Among
nonwhite males the increase would be 1.1 and 1.9
years, respectively. Nonwhite females would still
experience the largest increase, 1.9 years and 3.3
years.
The aforementioned calculations are useful for re-
flecting on the aggregate total effect of stroke mortal-
ity. However, the results are somewhat artificial, since
the effects of eliminating stroke mortality are averaged
over the entire population. In order to understand the
impact of mortality for cerebrovascular disease, it is
necessary to examine a life table which represents the
mortality conditions only among individuals who died
of stroke (table 2).
To aid in comprehending this table another life table
function, lx
, is introduced. The function lx
represents
the number of deaths, attributable to a specific cause,
that would occur at and after age x, if the current
mortality conditions did not change. Thus for white
males in 1968, there would be 9,640 deaths where

stroke was the underlying cause of death. By 1978 this
would have declined to 7,820 deaths. As is indicated
by the data in the table, nonwhite females had the
largest number of people dying from stroke, and for
each race/sex group the numbers were lower in 1978
than in 1968. The data also indicate that, for white
males in 1978, 93 percent (12,338/13,278) of all the
stroke related deaths occurred after age 60. Compara-
ble percentages for white females, nonwhite males,
and nonwhite females are 96, 84, and 91, respectively.
The data on strokes can be compared to data for all
deaths. For white males in 1968, 9.6 percent of all
deaths resulted from stroke as an underlying cause of
death and 15.0 percent of all deaths occurred with
stroke as any cause of death. This declined to 7.8 and
13.3 percent in 1978. The percentage of deaths attrib-
utable to stroke increases with age. Among those indi-
viduals age 75 and over the percentages are 11.4 and
18.9. In 1978, the percentage of all deaths which were
stroke related for white females, nonwhite males, and
nonwhite females was 20.9, 14.5 and 21.6, respective-
ly. At age 75 and over, stroke accounted for 25.2, 19.6
and 26.1 percent of all deaths respectively.
In Table 2, e, is interpreted as the average age of
death due to stroke in a cohort subject to the current
stroke mortality conditions. Thus, the average age at
death for white males with stroke as an underlying
cause in 1968 and 76.2 years. This was almost identi-
cal to the average age for nonwhite females, five years
greater than the average age for nonwhite males, and
five years less than the average age for white females.
By 1978, as a result of the decline in stroke mortality,
the average age at death for white males and white
females increased by two years, while the average age
for nonwhites increased more dramatically (4.5 years
for nonwhite females and 3 years for nonwhite males).
The data in table 3 represent the hypothetical situa-
tion of Table 2 applied to the population in table 2, i.e.,
the expected increase in life expectancy among per-
sons who died of stroke, if stroke were eliminated as a
cause of death. The gains noted in this table are 5 to 7
times greater than the gains noted for the general popu-
lation. These data indicate that if stroke were eliminat-
ed as a cause of death in 1968, a white male who would
have died of stroke could be expected to live an addi-
tional 10.25 years. This decreased to 10.00 years in
1978. The largest gains were noted for nonwhite fe-
males, and the gains are greater for females than males
and nonwhites than whites.
Discussion
Throughout the study period, the three leading
causes of death, using underlying cause of death data,
were heart disease, cancer, and stroke. These diseases,
respectively, accounted for 38.6 percent, 16.5 percent
and 11.0 percent of the underlying causes of death in
1968. By 1978 this had changed to 37.8 percent, 20.6
percent, and 9.1 percent, respectively. Examination of

the data on total mentions changes the picture slightly.
In 1968 there were more deaths with stroke as any
cause than with cancer as any cause (325,533 vs.
323,258); but by 1978 the rise in cancer deaths and the
decline in stroke deaths is evident (454,134 vs.
289,885). Despite this, approximately 1 out of every 6
death certificates in 1978 listed stroke as any cause of
death.
A comparison of the age specific frequencies
(Birth-64, 65-74, 75-84, 85 + ) of stroke as an under-
lying cause of death versus stroke as any cause of death
showed slightly larger percentage declines for the un-
derlying cause group. This was observed in each of the
race/sex groups, with the largest percentage declines
being observed among the Birth--64 age group. This
probably implies either a decline in incidence coupled
with a decline in case fatality rates, or just a large
decline in case fatality rates. However, between 1968
and 1978, not all age groups displayed a decline. The
85 + age group registered an increase in the number of
deaths citing stroke as the underlying cause of death
and as any cause of death. This increase was observed
for each race/sex group, except white males. For white
and nonwhite females this increase was quite substan-
tial (37 and 28 percent). This increase is significant
from a public health viewpoint. In 1978, one-third of
all stroke related deaths among white females occur to
individuals aged 85 and over, and half of all the stroke
related deaths occur to white females. Therefore, an
increase in the number of stroke related deaths among
white females aged 85 and over has a major impact
upon the general stroke mortality rates.
From 1968 to 1978 there was a slight decline in the
ratio of stroke deaths cited as underlying cause versus
any cause. The implication is that there was a shift in
coding of stroke away from an underlying cause and
towards an associated cause of death. One explanation
of such a shift would be that there was improved sur-
vival from stroke during the period. There is some
evidence to indicate that, at least for cerebral infarc-
tions, this may have been the case.8 In addition, the
general decline in death rates resulted in an increase in
the median age at death. The data indicate that, after
age 45, the mean number of conditions reported on the
death certificates goes up with age. This could be inter-
preted, in layman's terms, that with increasing age
there are more things that go wrong with the body.
Given this, then there are more causes of death to
choose from as the underlying cause, and the proba-
bility of stroke being the underlying cause would
decrease while the probability of stroke being an asso-
ciated cause of death would increase. Thus a nonun-
derlying cause mention of stroke at more advanced
ages could represent a morbid process equally as seri-
ous as those occurrences when it is the underlying
cause of death."
From 1968 to 1978 there was a decline of over 30
percent in the rate of stroke mortality as an underlying
cause of death. Since the mortality rate was declining,
the gains in life expectancy in 1978 should be less than
those in 1968. It was anticipated that the change in the
life expectancy gains would be strongly related to the
drop in mortality; however, the life expectancy gains at
birth decreased only moderately (16 to 27 percent).
Comparable data for stroke as any cause of death are
14 to 23 percent. The smaller decline in life expectan-
cy gains for any cause is another reflection of the shift
in coding of stroke as an associated cause of death
rather than as an underlying cause of death. It is un-
clear as to why the decline in the gain in life expectan-
cy is so much less than that for stroke mortality, but
this is probably related to the generally old age of the
survivors.
The smallest change for life expectancy was ob-
served among white females. This possibly results
from the large increase in stroke related deaths among
the 85 + age group for white females (see above), and
the modest increase for the 75-84 age group.
Life expectancy measures have been used to argue
that the control of chronic disease will have only a
modest impact on the health of the population, since
there is usually only a small number of years of life
expectancy gain associated with the elimination of
these conditions. This statement is true when referring
to life expectancy at birth. However, in 1978, nearly
85 percent of all stroke deaths were to individuals aged

65 and over. Elimination of stroke as a cause of death
has minimal impact until the later years of life, and
therefore the reference point should be moved to re-
flect this. Since the added number of years an individ-
ual could expect to survive remains fairly constant to
age 65, the percentage gain increases with age. If the
reference point were moved to age 60, then elimination
of stroke as a cause of death would result in an 8.3
percent gain (1.42/17.1) in life expectancy for white
males. The percentage gain would be 10.5, 12.9, 18.9
for white females, nonwhite males and nonwhite fe-
males, respectively. It is difficult not to call these gains
substantial.
In addition, if the effects are restricted to the popula-
tion at risk, i.e., those who died of a stroke, the effect
of eliminating stroke as a cause of death is even great-
er. These adjusted data (table 3) show a 14.6 percent
gain in life expectancy at birth and a 49.8 percent gain
in life expectancy at age 60, among white males. Large
gains for the other race/sex groups can also be shown.
These adjusted gains are greater for nonwhites than for
whites, reflecting the larger mortality rates among
nonwhites.
The frequency of stroke deaths is important to study,
since it defines the size of the clinical problem. The
gain in life expectancy due to the theoretical elimina-
tion of stroke as a cause of death is important because:
a) it represents the lifetime impact of the disease, and
b) since it weighs each event by the number of years of
increased survival, it portrays the future effect of
stroke mortality on the current population. Clearly, if
more persons survive to advanced ages, proportionate-
ly more people will die of the conditions with the
highest forces of mortality at those ages. Thus, the life
expectancy gain measure is useful in helping put
changes in the mortality risk of a given condition in
context with the age specific changes in risk for other
conditions.
Conclusion
This paper has examined various facets of mortality
due to cerebrovascular disease, stroke, and the
changes in this mortality during the period 1968-1978.
The number of deaths where stroke was cited as the
underlying cause of death declined much faster than
the number of deaths where stroke was cited as any
cause of death; indicating that a change in the role of
cerebrovascular disease as an associated cause of death
has probably occurred. An examination of cause elimi-
nation life tables revealed that the life expectancy
change which could be expected from the elimination
of stroke mortality had not declined as markedly as the
stroke mortality rates and that at advanced ages the
change was positive. Adjusting the calculations to re-
fer to those who died of stroke showed that the life
expectancy gains of eliminating stroke as a cause of
death would be quite large.
These observations suggest that there has been pro-
gress in the clinical management of cerebrovascular
disease; however, stroke still remains a major force of
mortality. The various measures presented here indi-
cate that the impact of stroke mortality is greater than
that indicated by the underlying cause of death data.
Therelativedecline in stroke mortality was greater for
nonwhites, though the demographic subgroup with the
largest number of stroke related deaths was white fe-
males. Overall, this study suggests that to adequately
describe the population implications of chronic disease
conditions it is necessary to examine a variety of as-
pects beyond the data relating to underlying cause of
death.

The basic parameter of the life table, from which all other parameters
can be derived, is the age specific probability of death calculated as the
ratio of the number D, of deaths during the year for people aged x to x +
I divided by the average number Nx
of persons age x at the start of the
year, or.

To further explore the cause specific structure of mortality a number
of derivative life table quantities can be calculated. For example, one
might wish to know what the age specific probability of death might be
if deaths due to a specific disease were hypothetically eliminated. This
adjusted probability of death can be calculated as:
where DxB
is the number of deaths due to all causes but A, so that Dx
=
DxB
+ DxA-
The age specific probabilities of death are useful measures of differ-
ences in risk between populations. However, one may be interested in
producing summary, life table measures of those survival differences. A
life table measure that reflects differences in survival over the life span is
the "life expectancy." The "life expectancy" measure reflects the
average age to which people can expect to survive after birth, or the
number of years a person can expect to live after age x. The life
expectancy calculation requires two parameters, lx
, the number of
persons from the original cohort (l0
) which can expect to survive to age
x, and Tx
, the total number of years lived by the population after age x.
These two parameters may be calculated as.
(x
= I d,
y = x
where
d, = lx
qx
and lx +
, = lx
- d
and (using the trapezoidal rule, Chiang 1968)

The parameter Tx
simply represents the sum, over all ages after age x to
the end of the life table, of two components: a) the number of person
years lived during an age interval by persons who survived to the end of
an interval (e.g.. ly +
|) and b) the number of person years lived by
persons who died during the interval (e g., '/iyear). Using lx
andTx
life
expectancy is calculated as
Life expectancy in a cohort after cause of death A is eliminated is
calculated by substituting qx
.A
in (5) and proceeding with the computa-
tions in (4), (6). and (7). A measure of the impact on life expectancy of
eliminating cause A is obtained by taking the difference between the
regular life expectancy (e,) and that calculated using qx A
(exA
). This
difference, G, represents the average number of additional years that
could be expected to be lived in the population if cause A were eliminat-
ed, and is represented as:
Gx A
= e,.A
- ex
(8)
This measure, however, does not reflect the fact that only a given
proportion of the population will die of cause A. In the previous calcula-
tions, the total number of person years of life gained by eliminating
cause A are averaged over the entire population. To more specifically
evaluate the mortality experience of persons dying of cause A a life table
for only that population is calculated. This results in the following:
y = x
and
and
- J
and
= T../1,

(10)
(11)
(12)
e. = T./l, (7)
where \lA
is the number of deaths expected to occur after age x from
cause A among the lx
persons alive at x. Similarly, definitions for the
other functions can be derived.
A further quantity of interest is the life expectancy gain to be expected
among persons who died of cause A if cause A were eliminated. This
represents the actual gain in life expectancy expected to occur if a
clinical cure of A were achieved. This value is.
