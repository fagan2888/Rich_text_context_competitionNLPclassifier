s Abstract As a consequence of global aging of the human population, the occur-
rence of cognitive impairment and dementia is rapidly becoming a significant burden
for medical care and public health systems. By the year 2020, the WHO predicts there
will be nearly 29 million demented people in both developed and developing countries.
Primary and secondary prevention of dementia through individual and population-level
interventions could reduce this imminent risk. Vascular risk factors such as type 2 di-
abetes, hypertension, dietary fat intake, high cholesterol, and obesity have emerged as
important influences on the risk of both vascular and Alzheimer's dementia. Under-
standing the reasons for differences between populations in genetic vulnerability and
environmental exposures may help to identify modifiable risk factors that may lead to
effective prevention of vascular and Alzheimer's dementia.
INTRODUCTION
Dementia is now widely recognized as an important global public health problem.
Rapid advances in neuroscience and increased interest in the burden of dementia
syndromes on communities and nations have brought the importance of dementia
to the forefront. This renewed focus is in no small measure due to aging of the
world population and related increases in family, clinical, and social burdens from
patients with dementia. Epidemiology and other public health research approaches
have incorporated clinical and basic neuroscience into population-based research
to begin to delineate the natural history of these syndromes and identify risk fac-
tors for dementia development. Identification of preventable or modifiable factors
that influence the risk of dementia may lead to evaluation of preventive interven-
tions. An estimated 4 million people in the United States are believed to suffer
from Alzheimer's disease (AD) alone; if those with vascular dementia and other
common dementias were included, the numbers might double (31). The World

Health Organization (WHO) estimates there are 18 million people with dementia
in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America and predicts there will be nearly 29
million by 2020 (39).
Dementia is not one biological condition, but rather is a syndrome defined by
measurable cognitive decline to the point where physical, social, and intellectual
functions are clearly impaired. Specific criteria for the diagnosis of the demen-
tia syndrome and its components are available from several sources (84, 129).
Over 200 types of dementia have been described, most of which are very uncom-
mon, with some related to known genetic abnormalities. The heterogeneity of this
syndrome makes estimating its impact more complex.
Population-based clinical and basic research all contribute to the identification
of modifiable risk factors and the development of effective interventions. Clinical
treatments or rehabilitative interventions that retard or halt the progression of this
chronic illness or result in regression of disease have the potential to be applied as
preventive interventions. In this review, we emphasize identification of modifiable
environmental risk factors. Treatments focused on proximal features of dementia
are likely to be part of the pathology of the disease and less appropriate for a review
of disease prevention.
THE ECONOMIC AND PUBLIC HEALTH BURDEN
OF DEMENTIA
Costs of Care and Treatments
Treating and managing dementia patients include direct medical care costs for
acute care hospitals and long-term care. Some authors have recently projected an
83% increase in costs of caring for Alzheimer's dementia (111) by the year 2020.
Rice and colleagues estimated that formal care costs for dementia in the United
States averaged $27,672 per patient per year. Of these costs, long-term care is the
most expensive component and is primarily paid out of pocket by the patients'
family. Indirect costs such as lost wages and productivity averaged $10,400 to
$34,517 per patient per year, influenced by patient severity, and length of sur-
vival with disease. Patients with AD are more likely to live in nursing homes
(124) than other elderly individuals. Since most drugs currently available for AD
treatment have modest effects at best, these treatments do not substantially im-
pact progression of the disease in the overall population. Other treatments such
as statins are in the early stages of evaluation as preventive treatments for AD.
Treatments that prevent comorbid diseases, such as stroke or type 2 diabetes, may
affect the rate of AD development or progression, and may be more cost-effective
as preventive agents than current therapies. However all forms of primary and
secondary prevention as well as tertiary treatments need to be explored more
fully.

The Population Burden of Dementia
PREVALENCE The prevalence of major dementias, both AD and vascular dementia,
has been extensively reviewed elsewhere (74, 75, 106, 113) (Table 1). Briefly,
the prevalence of dementia in European studies of people aged 65 and older has
ranged between 5% and 10% and doubles every 4 years to reach 30% at age

80 (113). Most European studies suggest a higher risk of dementia in women.
Dementiaprevalenceisconsistentlylowerinmostdevelopingcountries.InNigeria,
prevalence of dementia in those aged 65+ was slightly over 2% (59); in Ballabgarh,
India less than 2% (47); and in Shanghai about 5% (149). Nearly all population-
based studies report an increase in both prevalence and incidence of dementia with
increasing age.
INCIDENCE In developed countries, dementia incidence is about 1% per year in
those aged 65 and older (113). Incidence varies across race/ethnic groups and
within race/ethnic groups in different geographic regions. At the time of this re-
view, very few incidence studies have been conducted in developing countries.
These include only India (47), Africa (58), and China (149). There has been some
published research on dementia in South America and Mexico (64); however,
they are not population-based cohort studies that can reliably provide estimates
of dementia incidence. One barrier, among many, to doing dementia research in
developing countries or across cultural groups is the lack of relatively unbiased
screening and assessment instruments that are feasible for use in settings with
minimal resources and populations with low literacy levels. A methodology for
ascertaining dementia in developing countries, which may make such research
more feasible in the future, has been proposed by the 10/66 group (106, 107).
A consistent pattern emerges from comparison of dementia incidence rates
across populations: Rates appear to be lower in developing countries compared to
developedcountries.ThemajorityofallincidencestudieshavebeendoneinEurope
and in the United States in populations of European ancestry. The single published
study in Japan reported incidence rates similar to those found in the United States
among those of European ancestry (46). Even among developed countries, there
is considerable variation. For example, incidence in some European countries (4,
6) is lower than in the United States. Some authors have postulated the existence
of a European north-south gradient in dementia risks, with the highest incidence
occurring in northern European countries and the lowest in southern European
countries (3). If this gradient exists, it may be owing to variations in exposure to
lifestyle factors, such as diet, or to lower frequency of APO e4 or other dementia-
related genotypes present in southern European populations.
Comparisons of immigrants to those remaining behind in the mother country
are useful for distinguishing the effects of environmental exposures from genetic
vulnerability. However, there are few studies comparing dementia in immigrants
to genetically similar groups in their country of origin. Hendrie has reported inci-
dence rates in African Americans 2.4 times higher than in Africans from Nigeria
(58). An earlier report (141) suggested that dementia prevalence in Japanese men
living in Hawaii might be higher compared to Japanese men living in Japan; there
are differences in diagnostic approaches between the two countries that may con-
found this finding. Meguro and colleagues (87) reported a similar prevalence of
senile dementia in Japanese men living in S~
ao Paulo, Brazil compared to those liv-
ing in Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. Cross-national comparison studies are by nature
CAN DEMENTIA BE PREVENTED? 5
complicated by differences in diagnostic methodology and cross-cultural biases
in assessment tools. However, they capture differences in environmental and ge-
netic vulnerabilities that can be explored further to identify new approaches to
preventing dementia. The lower rates reported in developing countries may point
to selective survival differences related to competing risks or to higher exposure
to dementia risk factors in the developed countries.
INCIDENCE OF SUBTYPES The major subtypes of dementia are Alzheimer's
dementia and vascular dementia. Diagnostic classification of vascular dementia
remains controversial and is evolving. Vascular causes of dementia are widely
regarded as modifiable through prevention and reduction of risk factors and may
offer the most significant hope at this time for primary prevention of dementia.
Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) may be a separate syndrome from AD, but
the diagnostic classification of DLB is still evolving.
Nearly all studies of dementia that have, to date, addressed incidence of sub-
types are in the United States, European countries, Japan, and China. In a cross-
national European study of dementia in 7 countries, Alzheimer's accounted for
about 70% of all dementia, followed by 15% for vascular dementia. A report from
the Italian Longitudinal Study on Aging (ILSA) reported AD incidence rates of
6.55 per 1000 person years (py) and 3.30 per 1000 py for vascular dementia.
Lobo (83) and colleagues have reported some variation in the proportion of all de-
mentias attributable to vascular dementia compared to Alzheimer's. Finland and
Pamplona had the highest proportion attributable to other dementias, and Sweden
had the highest attributable to Alzheimer's. Reports from Japan (46, 63, 145)
suggest that vascular dementia accounts for a higher proportion of total demen-
tia cases in that country: Estimates of the proportion of dementias classifiable as
vascular range from 32% (46) to 47% (145). Variations in occurrence of disease
across population groups, such as global regions, ethnicities, and genders, can
be broadly indicative of differences in genetic predisposition and environmental
exposures that may influence risk or progression of disease. Further, detection of
disease may be affected by socioeconomic circumstances or cultural views and
practices. Certainly, differences in the occurrence of dementia in developing and
developed countries or between disadvantaged and advantaged populations (for
example, African Americans versus European Americans) are necessarily subject
to influence by differential selective survival related to disadvantage. Some work
(91) has suggested that dementia incidence declines in very old ages. These views
have not yet been adequately evaluated in light of competing risks from earlier
cardiovascular mortality or other causes of premature death in populations.
Ascertainment of Dementia for Estimating
Population Burdens
Studies that are based on community health care diagnosis of dementia may find
inconsistent results owing to the variability in extent of patient evaluation and
6 HAAN WALLACE
diagnostic rigor by the health care system. Dementia is often not diagnosed or
not treated in typical community health care settings (43). Even when dementia is
evaluated in the health care setting, verification of subtype by neuroimaging is often
absent and a differential diagnosis of dementia is incomplete. Dementia is chal-
lenging to diagnose in older populations, and inter-rater discordance in dementia
and AD diagnosis has been documented (61). Some older persons remain incom-
pletely diagnosed because of lack of access to medical care, residence in long-term
care institutional settings, decisions made by caregivers or others responsible for
dementia patients that prevent a full evaluation, or by the confounding effects of
substantial comorbidity.
Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a possible early precursor of dementia, is
variously defined as the absence of dementia meeting Diagnostic Standards Man-
ual IV criteria with the presence of subjective memory complaints, normal general
cognitive functioning, objective memory impairment, and autonomy in activities
of daily living (53, 77). There are conflicting reports on how strongly current def-
initions of MCI predict the development of dementia. However, work that can
successfully define early predictors of dementia will be of importance for pre-
venting the progression to later, less treatable phases. Despite these limitations,
important and potential risk factors for dementia onset have been identified.
RISK FACTORS FOR DEMENTIA
Prevention of Dementia
Prevention may be thought of in three nonexclusive stages: primary, secondary,
and tertiary. Primary prevention generally refers to the prevention of disease be-
fore its biological onset or to prevention of risk factors for disease (sometimes
called primordial prevention). Secondary prevention refers to the early detection
of asymptomatic disease, usually through screening that leads to early treatment.
Except for people at high risk for dementia, such as those with certain genotypes
or high levels of identified environmental exposures, it is very difficult to precisely
identify asymptomatic individuals who are likely to acquire dementia at some
point in the future. A role for early dementia screening in primary care has been
proposed. However, a recent report from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
suggests there is insufficient evidence to support instituting such a universal screen-
ing policy (138). Tertiary prevention generally refers to interventions that retard
progression of or rehabilitate overt clinical disease. In addition to existing drug
treatments for dementia that modestly retard progression of dementia, tertiary pre-
ventive approaches may include behavioral or rehabilitative patient interventions
and improvement in the quality of supportive care in the community or the institu-
tional setting for the patient, the family, and other informal caregivers. A previous
review in the Annual Review of Public Health (104) addresses existing evidence
from observational studies on a set of potential lifestyle risk factors for Alzheimer's
disease that pointed the way toward potential interventions. The present review
CAN DEMENTIA BE PREVENTED? 7
addresses population burdens of the major forms of dementia; variability in risk
associated with environmental exposures, lifestyle and behaviors, race/ethnicity,
and genetic contributions; and existing evidence on clinical trials and interventions
that have the potential for directly preventing or treating dementias.
Genetics and Dementia in a Population-Based Context
Few candidate genes have so far been firmly identified in connection with
Alzheimer's disease. The most established of these is the APOE lipoprotein geno-
type. The e4 allele of this genotype is associated with increased risk of both AD
and vascular dementia. Homozygosity for e4 is usually more strongly associated
with both dementia and coronary artery disease than heterozygotic combinations
with only one e4 allele. The contribution of APOE to dementia risk varies by age,
gender, and ethnicity or ancestral background. APOE may account for up to 40%
of the genetic risk for sporadic late-onset AD (50). However, the fraction of AD
cases that are attributable to APOE e4 is estimated at about 5% (69) in Mexican
Americans, whereas in Americans of European ancestry Evans has estimated that
AD incidence would be reduced by 13% if the APOE e4 allele did not exist. Slooter
has estimated a 20% reduction in dementia (40, 125) with the elimination of e4 in
Dutch studies.
Presenilin (PS1 and PS2) genes are also accepted as contributors to early onset
AD, but these are probably far less common in populations than APOE e4 and
far fewer cases are attributable to these genes (80, 143). Other genetic factors that
may be related to lipid metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, hypertension,
stroke, or type-2 diabetes have implications for the risk of vascular dementia,
probably for AD, and might interact with APOE to influence the risk of dementia.
EARLY EFFECTS OF APOE A number of reports have demonstrated higher LDL
among children with the e4 allele (10, 51, 109, 127). Important longitudinal work
from the Bogalusa Heart Study (128) has reported that presence of the APOE e4
increased LDL more over a 15-year follow up compared to e3; further, those with
e2 were more responsive to lifestyle changes such as obesity or dietary fat intake.
Taken together, these findings support the notion that APOE e4 could increase
coronary heart or artery disease risks from birth onward. Whether this also holds
true for cognitive outcomes is not known. In fact, little has been done to examine
effects of APOE e4 on changes in cognitive status from youth to older adulthood;
the Scottish Mental Survey of 1932 (27) was able to report that APOE e4 predicted
change in cognitive ability from age 11 to age 80 but did not influence ability at
age 11. It is likely that APOE e4 is associated with cumulative exposure over time
to elevated LDL, amyloid deposition, and oxidative processes that affect vascular
disease and subsequent dementia risk later in life, rather than manifesting more
immediate, direct effects on cognition in childhood. Most research supports the
notion that those homozygous for the e4 allele experience greater loss of hippocam-
pal volume, changes in brain metabolism, and increased risk for cognitive decline
and dementia. The various APOE allele combinations are associated with varying
8 HAAN WALLACE
rates of atherogenesis, such that the risk of dementia and cognitive impairment
is significantly higher among those with the ApoE e4 allele and higher levels of
atherosclerosis (126).
CROSS-POPULATION STUDIES OF e4 The e4 allele of the APOE gene has been
linked to an increased risk of both AD and vascular dementia in a variety of pop-
ulations. There is considerable variability in the allele distribution of the APOE
genotype by race, ethnicity, and nationality. Available studies are limited in two
major ways: (a) Data on APOE allele frequencies, often taken from small, clinical
samples, can be biased by the high prevalence of demented subjects, the older age
of these subjects, and the lack of representativeness of these samples and matched
controls for general populations; (b) understanding of racial and ethnic diversity
in the effects of APOE on dementia is hindered by inappropriate classifications
of ethnic groups. For example, classification as "Hispanic" of people of Mexican,
Caribbean, Central-American, and South-American ancestry mixes together
groups that are diverse from a historic, cultural, and genetic point of view. Sim-
ilar issues pertain to Asians and other ethnic groups. A 1997 review by Farrer
(50) summarized the risk of AD associated with heterozygosity and homozygos-
ity for the APOE e4 allele; a higher risk of AD was consistently present across
all ethnic groups associated with homozygosity for e4; heterozygosity was also
associated with an increased risk of AD with the exception of African Americans,
where e4 heterozygosity was not associated with an increased risk of AD. More
recent work (33, 34) has suggested that certain APOD lipoprotein polymorphisms
[APOD is a high-density-lipoprotein (HDL)-associated glycoprotein] may mod-
ify the association between APOE e4 and AD. Desai's (33) work suggests that
the risk of AD associated with APOE e4 positivity was higher in those with the
APOD polymorphism Intron 12 allele; this allele combination was also higher
in those with AD compared to control subjects. A few laboratory and pathology
studies have implicated APOD polymorphisms in neurodegenerative and neurore-
generative processes (66, 131). This polymorphism may only occur in individuals
of African ancestry compared to individuals of European ancestry in the United
States (34); however, no other studies have reported population-level distributions
of APOD in non-European ancestry samples.
GENETICS AND PREVENTION OF DEMENTIA Primary and secondary prevention of
dementia related to genetic factors logically focuses on modifying environmental
and lifestyle exposures that influence risk by interacting with genetic vulnerability.
Because none of the known genetic risk factors for dementia is determinative,
screening to identify high-risk cases may not be feasible, effective, or desirable,
and universal screening is even less so.
Lipids are likely to be an important pathway in amyloid beta-protein deposition,
tau phosphorylation, and disruption of synaptic plasticity and neurodegenerative
endpoints (29, 30, 89, 90). Since the effects of APOE e4 on lipids are well docu-
mented, interventions that prevent exposure to dietary fat or other factors that are
CAN DEMENTIA BE PREVENTED? 9
known to increase LDL, or those that may reduce LDL through treatments (i.e.,
statins), may be effective in reducing dementia risk. The effectiveness of dietary
modifications or treatment with drugs that lower LDL has been evaluated in a few
studies involving children and adults (19, 140). Work by Pedro-Botet (99) and by
Campos (19) have demonstrated that those with APOE e2 may be more responsive
to lipid-lowering interventions compared to those who are e4+. Other work (56,
144) has provided some evidence that APOE e4 modifies the effects of hormone
treatments on lipids such that e4+ individuals are less responsive to treatment. The
contribution of genetic variation to disease differences between populations may
be relatively small if a recent report by Rosenberg is supported (117). This report
has suggested that "within-population differences among individuals account for
93% to 95% of genetic variation" and between-population differences account for
3% to 5%.
Early Versus Late Exposure
A growing body of evidence points to early life exposures to factors in the child-
hood socioeconomic environment, such as education, parental occupation, age at
menarche, and early nutritional intake, that may affect the risk of dementia in
old age. The reserve hypothesis (49) represents the notion that early exposures in
utero and in childhood affect brain size, synaptic plasticity, and dendritic density.
Although this has been demonstrated in nonhuman primates and in rodents, depri-
vation in humans in early life is correlated frequently with adverse exposures in
adult life, such as occupational toxins and lifelong poverty. Disentangling the con-
tributions of early exposures versus later exposures and their relative consequences
for dementia risk is difficult to accomplish in nearly all population-based studies.
Moceri (92), for example, has provided evidence that a disadvantaged childhood
environment characterized by area of residence in childhood and parental status
is associated with a higher risk of AD. Similar work by Kim (71) and Hall (52)
has linked markers of early inadequate nutrition (e.g., as suggested by shorter
limb length) and rural residence with a higher risk of dementia. De Ronchi (32)
reported a nearly fivefold increase in dementia risk associated with low education.
Farmer (42) has also reported an inverse association between cognitive change
and education in the Epidemiologic Catchment Area CA study. In a study of older
Mexican-American women, Haan reported an inverse association between educa-
tion and dementia risk (69) and a higher risk of cognitive impairment in women
who reported a late menarche, an indicator of early nutritional deprivation.
CAN PREVENTION OF VASCULAR DISEASE PREVENT DEMENTIA? Increasing evi-
dence is emerging at the molecular, physiologic, clinical, and social levels that
vascular disease and risk factors play important etiologic roles in both vascular de-
mentia and Alzheimer's dementia. De la Torre (28, 29) has reviewed this evidence
extensively, pointing out eight evidentiary themes at the population, clinical, and
molecular levels that support the role of vascular processes in dementia. The role
10 HAAN WALLACE
played by ApoE and potentially other genetically driven lipoproteins also supports
this notion. Further, there is evidence linking traditional vascular risk factors such
as obesity, exercise (9), hypertension, stroke (22, 23, 55, 79, 97, 100), and type 2
diabetes (14) to both vascular and Alzheimer's dementia. Inflammatory factors
such as homocysteine (13, 14) and c-reactive protein (120) are being investigated;
a growing body of evidence supports the notion that oxidative stress (44) is im-
plicated in dementia. Clinical trials using anti-inflammatory drugs, lipid-lowering
drugs such as statins (24), and antidiabetic drugs (2) are underway. However, a
recent clinical trial of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (3) did not
show any benefit as a tertiary preventive treatment for progression in AD patients.
Chemical and Physical Environmental Exposures
and Dementia
Several types of environmental exposures have been explored as possible causes of
dementia and AD in particular. Some work has been done to explore the relation of
neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive function and prior pesticide exposure. In
a study in three regions of Quebec, Canada, the relative risk of developing AD was
2.4 for men in occupations with pesticide exposure (7, 48). Clearly, more work is
needed with better exposure information to establish such associations and explore
the preventability of these exposures.
Brain accumulation of aluminum in cases of dialysis-associated dementia was
demonstrated, raising the issue of whether aluminum exposure was associated
with the incidence of primary AD. However, this notion has not been proven (18),
and there have not been any recently published investigations on this issue. Brains
from AD patients have been reported to have abnormal accumulation of iron in
senile plaques, and some but not all studies have suggested that iron may mediate
the in vitro neurotoxicity of amyloid-beta peptide (12). Iron may play a role in the
aggregation of tau protein, leading to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (146).
Lead, like iron, has been implicated in the genesis of neurofibrillary tangles (54).
Zinc has been postulated to have both pathogenic and protective roles in AD (26).
The role(s) of elemental metals or their complexes in AD and dementia seems to
be worthy of pursuit and may lead to treatments for dementia with metal-binding
agents (17). Potential interventions to reduce or eliminate these exposures have no
substantial basis yet for preventing neurodegenerative diseases.
HEAD TRAUMA There have been reports of an increased density in A plaque in
the brains of individuals who died of head trauma, but Adle-Biassette (1) found that
there was no difference in density of A deposits between cases of head trauma
and controls. A case-controlled study showed that a history of head trauma was
significant for both AD and non-AD dementias, but the effect was limited to males
(119). Several epidemiologic studies have reported increased risk of dementia
in individuals with head trauma (103, 145). The Multi-Institutional Research in
Alzheimer's Genetic Epidemiology (MIRAGE) project showed that the risk of
CAN DEMENTIA BE PREVENTED? 11
AD was elevated with a history of head trauma when compared to family and
spouse controls, and there was a smaller elevation in risk for those carrying APOE4
alleles (50). However, the Canadian Study on Health and Aging and the Rotterdam
Study showed no change in dementia risk for those with a history of head trauma
(78, 82).
ALCOHOL The relationship between alcohol consumption and dementia is com-
plex, mediated by dose and type of alcohol. High levels of alcohol intake, usually
associated with clinical problem drinking and alcoholism, can lead to cognitive
decline, but the neuropathological findings in alcoholic dementia are distinct from
Alzheimer'sdisease.Alcohol-associatedcognitiveimpairmentmaybeconfounded
by other factors in these patients, such as smoking, dietary deficiencies of vitamins
and antioxidants, or head trauma.
Moderate alcohol consumption may be protective (37, 62). For example, the
Rotterdam Study (118) and the Cardiovascular Health Study (96) showed light-to-
moderate alcohol consumption as significantly protective for all dementia (hazard
ratio = 0.58 (95% CI 0.38­0.90). The third Copenhagen City Heart Study showed
wine consumption, but not other alcohol types, reduced the risk of dementia (134).
Dementia was more common in older alcohol abusers in the Canadian Study of
Health and Aging for all diagnosed types except probable AD (132). In a Japanese
study of vascular dementia, alcohol consumption was a significant risk factor for
vascular dementia but not AD (46).
Neurologic effects of alcohol on the brain may be modified by genetic cofactors.
The Epidemiology of Vascular Aging study showed that the association between
alcohol consumption and cognitive decline was modified by APOE e4 genotype
(36). Noncarriers of APOE4 who drank were at decreased risk of cognitive de-
terioration, whereas carriers of APOE4 who drank were at increased risk. The
Cardiovascular Health Study showed that the risk associated with very high alco-
hol consumption was more pronounced among those with APOE e4 (96). Although
a growing body of epidemiological data from observational studies suggests that
moderate alcohol consumption is associated with protection from dementia, ab-
stainers may include individuals too ill to consume alcohol or those with a family
history of alcoholism.
DIETARY FACTORS Nutritional factors have been investigated as potential mod-
ifiable risk factors for dementia. Much of this work focuses on lipids, oxida-
tion, and inflammation. Modifiable exposures in these realms include dietary fat,
antioxidants, and folate-vitamin B12-homocysteine metabolism. A number of
studies have reported that high intakes of total fat, saturated fat, and total choles-
terol increase risk for incident dementia (37, 38, 67, 68, 85, 86). High fish intake
may be protective for incident dementia and AD, with relative risks of 0.4 (95%
CI 0.2­0.91) and 0.3 (0.1­0.9) respectively. Morris et al. (93) found that vegetable
fat and omega-6 fatty acid intake decreased the risk of AD, whereas saturated or
transunsaturated fats increased the risk.
12 HAAN WALLACE
One study of dietary antioxidant vitamins C and E showed that plasma levels
of vitamin C were lower in AD patients with poorer cognitive function despite
similar dietary intake (114). At least two studies (41, 94) have reported that those
with high levels of dietary vitamin C and E are at decreased risk of dementia (37).
The Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project found no association
between vitamins C and E or the carotenes in the development of AD (86). A case-
control study of patients with AD found that patients with AD had a lower level
of beta-carotene and vitamin A but not alpha-carotene when compared to controls
(65). Studies of nutritional factors in AD patients are generally confounded by
changes in eating habits and weight common in AD patients. Several studies in
humans have reported an inverse association between homocysteine and cogni-
tive impairment or dementia (95, 110, 122, 142). Inflammatory processes are of
increasing interest in dementia research for this reason.
EXERCISE Although it is clear that physical exercise offers health benefits for
older people, evidence supporting a specific effect of exercise for prevention of
dementia is still under investigation. Mechanistically, exercise has been suggested
to enhance brain neurotrophic factors (11) and modify apoptosis (101). Exercise
may benefit dementia by preserving muscle mass, preventing falls, and consequent
head trauma. Evidence that exercise can preserve optimal cardiovascular function,
deter stroke and microvascular disease, and improve regional cerebral blood flow
has been offered (23, 73). Given the substantial and diverse effects of exercise
on biological functions, the potential role of exercise for prevention of dementia
should receive further attention.
SMOKING Cigarette smoking has been reported to both promote and deter de-
mentia occurrence. For example, there is a selective loss of 4 subtype of nicotinic
receptors in the brains of AD patients, and this loss is related to the presence
and density of amyloid-1-42 plaques (12). The degree of reduction in nicotinic
receptor binding is also related to the severity of dementia (12, 21, 102). Nico-
tine has also been shown to inhibit apoptosis of neurons (60), and the idea of
smoking cessation as an intervention to prevent subcortical vascular dementia has
been suggested (116). Even if smoking has a protective effect on AD, it could be
completely or partially offset by an increased risk of vascular dementia (16, 98).
Smokers may have decreased perfusion to both cortical and subcortical regions of
the brain, as well as acceleration of cerebral atrophy and ventricular enlargement
(88). Reported associations between cigarette smoking and AD have been varied
(15, 60). A study of a cohort of British male doctors showed no significant change
in risk for dementia according to smoking status (35). A comparison of three
Canadian datasets showed inconsistent positive, negative, and neutral findings for
smoking and AD (136). Subsequent analysis of these data showed a significant
interaction between smoking status and alcohol consumption on the risk of AD
in two of the datasets, with the risk of smoking and drinking together having a
smaller increase in risk than either maineffect alone (135).Others (60) havefound a
CAN DEMENTIA BE PREVENTED? 13
protective effect of smoking on AD, limited to males and greater among those with
a positive family history. A meta-analysis (5) of 21 case-control studies showed a
pooled estimated odds ratio of 0.74 (95% CI = 0.66­0.84) for smoking. Another
meta-analysis provided a pooled relative risk for AD of 1.11 (CI = 0.93­1.34)
associated with cigarette smoking in four cohort studies, although the estimate
raised to 1.99 (CI = 1.33­2.98) when only two of the four studies were included
that described the number of smokers at baseline who later developed AD (5).
As for other exposures (98), Apolipoprotein E genotype may modify the smoking
effect on dementia and AD, such that those who are e4 positive are not affected
by smoking with respect to AD risk. Four European prospective studies found that
among those with a family history of dementia, there was no association between
smoking and dementia, whereas those without a family history of dementia had a
RR of 2.28 (78). APOE4 carriers have fewer nicotinic receptors, and nicotine may
help increase the density of the receptors or assist in the release of neurotrans-
mitters. It is likely that survivor bias due to early smoking-related mortality may
affect study outcomes by removing smokers from the population before they can
develop later-stage dementia.
Interventions and Treatments for Primary and Secondary
Prevention of Dementia
At present, drug treatments for slowing or halting the progression of dementia
are few and have limited effectiveness. Recent efforts to identify treatments that
might be efficacious for primary or secondary prevention have included NSAIDS,
statins, and antihypertensive medication.
NSAIDS Several observational studies have reported an inverse association be-
tween the use of NSAIDS and the risk of dementia (70, 112). The operative mech-
anism may be the anti-inflammatory properties of NSAIDS. Cache County study
data (148) suggested that long-term NSAID use reduced the incidence of AD.
However, a recent clinical trial of NSAIDS (3) in AD patients did not find a benefit
for progression. The reduction in AD risk associated with use of NSAIDs may
represent a role for primary prevention related to NSAIDS rather than treatment.
ANTIHYPERTENSIVE TREATMENT A positive association between systolic blood
pressure and dementia has been reported in a number of epidemiologic studies.
Similarly, stroke appears as a comorbidity or an etiologic factor for both vascular
and AD in at least 10 studies. This has given rise to the reasonable notion that
hypertension treatment may reduce the risk of dementia. Despite this potential,
only two randomized clinical trials have been attempted that directly address this
question. The Syst-Eur randomized clinical trial (45), designed to examine primary
prevention of stroke as an outcome of antihypertensive drug treatment, reported
a 53% reduction in vascular or mixed dementia and a 60% reduction in AD. The
PROGRESS (137) clinical trial of prevention of recurrent stroke by treatment with
14 HAAN WALLACE
antihypertensive medications reported a 34% reduction in a composite measure of
cognitive impairment and dementia. Whether antihypertension treatment affects
dementia by reducing A deposition or other hallmarks of AD is not known. Now
underway, the European SCOPE trial (n = 5000) (133) will examine the effects of
treatment with an antihypertensive medicine (candesartan cilexetil) versus placebo
on dementia outcomes.
HORMONE THERAPY Accumulated evidence suggested that exogenous estrogen
therapy in postmenopausal women may be associated with increased risk of de-
mentia (61). Despite varying methods and different types of estrogen therapy, with
and without added progestational agents, most observational studies with a sig-
nificant result showed protection associated with hormone replacement therapy
(HRT). Unopposed estrogen was reported to have greater benefits for dementia
than opposed treatments. However, the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), a large,
randomized clinical primary prevention trial of conjugated equine estrogens and
medroxyprogesterone acetate (Prempro®), found that dementia was twice as fre-
quent in the active treatment arm compared to the placebo arm; there was no
significant difference in the occurrence of cognitive impairment without dementia
(108, 123). Both vascular dementia and AD were more common in the treatment
group. The WHI HRT study was not able to evaluate the effects of HRT on de-
mentia subtypes owing to small numbers of AD cases. The WHI trial has also
confirmed Prempro® as a cause of stroke (105); it is possible that the increased risk
of all-cause dementia is related to the thromboembolic properties of HRT, which
may overwhelm any neuroprotective effects. A three-year clinical trial (97) failed
to provide any evidence for Prempro® as an effective treatment for Alzheimer's
dementia in hysterectomized women with AD.
STATINS Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), in
addition to impeding large-vessel atherosclerosis and its consequences, have sev-
eral metabolic effects on the brain that may be related to AD pathogenesis (72).
Some epidemiological studies have shown a negative association between statin
use and AD risk, and several mechanisms have been postulated (24, 115). Investi-
gators in one epidemiological study searched for indication bias for treatment for
cardiovascular disease as an explanation for association but failed to find it (115).
A Cochrane review published in 2001 concluded that the evidence for a causal
association was not yet present (121) but that this should be a high priority for
future research. It seems likely that trials in the treatment of clinical AD and other
dementias will appear in the next few years.
VACCINATION FOR PRIMARY OR SECONDARY PREVENTION OF AD A single popu-
lation-based, observational study (139) has reported a reduced risk of AD (OR =
0.41) associated with vaccination for diphtheria, tetanus, polio, or influenza. Re-
cent work done at Elan Pharmaceuticals (8) using a transgenic mouse model
for AD reported that antibodies against amyloid -peptide (A) injected
CAN DEMENTIA BE PREVENTED? 15
intraperitoneally cleared plaques and stopped peptide degradation. A subsequent
small trial in humans with AD provided evidence that this treatment increased
inflammatory response in the brain and elevated neurotoxicity. Recent work by
Nath and colleagues (57) has found that AD patients have a higher immune (anti-
body) response to aggregated A compared to soluble A. However, aggregated
A may be less neurotoxic than the soluble form. It is not yet clear whether the
immune response observed in AD patients is secondary to the development of
disease or is a proximal cause. It is likely that inflammatory and oxidative factors
related to this response are involved in AD and probably in vascular dementia as
well. The single observational study may have been biased by residual confound-
ing related to the likelihood that older persons who routinely seek vaccinations
differ by socioeconomic status and health behaviors from those who do not. The
general issue of infection and immunity in dementia has not been well explored
as yet.
EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERVENTIONS IN PREVENTING DEMENTIA A fairly consis-
tent pattern of results from recent trials of the above treatment interventions in AD
patients has failed to show significant benefits (and in some cases shows harm).
These discouraging oucomes may be, in part, due to the advanced stage of demen-
tia of study participants. Brain imaging studies show that most advanced dementia
patients have brain and hippocampal atrophy and white matter hyperintensities;
most also have the hallmark pathologies of AD, that is, plaques and tangles. There
are no studies at present that have addressed the reversibility of brain atrophy or
white matter hyperintensities in response to any intervention, partly owing to the
current logistical, technical, and cost limitations of serial imaging studies.
CONCLUSIONS: CAN DEMENTIA BE PREVENTED?
At one time, it was common to think of dementia as an inevitable outcome of
aging; it is now clearer that dementia is the result of a set of underlying patholog-
ical processes at least some of which may be preventable or modifiable. Certain
forms of cognitive decline, such as memory loss, are considered to be predictive
of specific dementias, especially Alzheimer's. Despite this improved recognition,
we do not yet have approaches to early screening that can predict future dementia
with certainty or can differentiate the future risk of one dementia subtype from
another. Some of this is due to uncertainty about the etiology of Alzheimer's de-
mentia and the role that vascular disease plays in its causation. Mounting evidence
points toward vascular disease as a major culprit for both Alzheimer's and vascu-
lar dementia. Although still controversial, this finding would be good news: The
past 30 years of public health and medical interventions have shown that we can
prevent vascular disease and that clearly identified vascular risk factors exist that
are modifiable.
Primary prevention of chronic disease depends on early identification of mod-
ifiable risk factors for which effective interventions exist and can be applied.

These may include dietary fat intake, dietary antioxidants, obesity, type 2 diabetes,
hypertension, physical exercise, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Genetic vul-
nerability related to APO e4 modifies many of these risks, and such interactions
mayincreasethecontributionofgeneticfactorsinthecontextofexposuretohigher-
risk environments. Preventive activities aimed at changing individual behaviors are
often expensive and difficult to execute in a population-based context. In a broad
sense, public health interventions that restrict access to smoking (for example),
increase screening and control of hypertension or diabetes, or stem the rising tide
of obesity may also reduce the population burden of dementias. Secondary preven-
tion of dementia depends on effective screening and early detection of dementia.
If effective treatments exist, early detection can lead to modification of dementia
risk. Indeed, multiple efforts are now underway to differentiate, through cognitive
screening and neuroimaging, those who will progress to dementia from those who
will not. For those at high risk of progression to dementia, significant modifications
in lifestyle and treatment of comorbid conditions, such as hypertension or diabetes,
may be effective strategies on the individual level. On the population level, inter-
ventions may include public and provider education regarding dementia or prac-
tices and policies that support routine dementia screening for people over age 50.
Dementia is a preventable syndrome, and progression to dementia can be pre-
vented or modified. In 20 years, if the WHO is correct, there will be close to
100 million people with dementia in the world. Even in wealthy, developed coun-
tries, the cost and burden of caring for these patients now falls on their families; in
most developing countries, there is no safety net at all and the future consequences
of these policy failures are daunting to imagine.
