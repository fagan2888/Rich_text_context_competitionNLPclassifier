Hidden decay of impact after
education for self-
management of chronic
illnesses: hypotheses
MJ Park, Joseph Green, Hirono Ishikawa and
Takahiro Kiuchi
Abstract
People with chronic illnesses can benefit from self-management education. However, those
benefits are said to decay over time (there is some evidence that this `decay of impact'does occur),
and the reinforcements used to prevent that decay appear to be ineffective. We hypothesize that
the reinforcements appear to be ineffective because decay of impact occurs only in a subgroup of
these programs' participants, so any benefits of reinforcements in that subgroup are concealed by
whole-group summary statistics. We also hypothesize that reinforcements can benefit those who
need them ­ those who would otherwise have decay. One approach to testing these hypotheses
requires analysis of individual-level data, which is uncommon in this field. Some useful data could
come from studies that have already been completed, but the strongest evidence will require
prospectively designed tests in future trials. If the hypotheses are false, then time and resources
spent on reinforcements can be saved or redirected. If the hypotheses are true, then
reinforcements can be implemented with less waste and they can be made more effective.
These programs can also be improved to better fit their users' needs, and there can be a new basis
for evaluating the programs' effectiveness.

Background
The global burden of chronic illnesses is
increasing.1 One response has been to help
patients with chronic illnesses self-manage
their conditions.2 Educational programs can
provide that help,3­5 and those programs do
have some benefits. They can, for example,

increase self-efficacy, self-rated health
status, and the frequency of aerobic exercise.
However, their impact can decay over time
and efforts to prevent the decay have failed.
Here we present two hypotheses: one to
explain that failure, and the other regarding
how the decay might be prevented. We
discuss how the hypotheses can be tested,
and we indicate some implications for
research and for practice if they are true.
In the context of health education in
general, improvement followed by deterior-
ation (i.e. `decay of impact') was described
35 years ago,6 and with regard to self-
management education it is still considered
to be important.7 Decay after self-
management education is not universal.8
Still, even though it has not been a primary
object of study, decay does seem to be
common.9­15 To prevent or mitigate that
decay, reinforcements (`booster sessions')
are recommended (p. 72).2
Nonetheless, in the context of education
for self-management of chronic illnesses,
reinforcements have been studied only occa-
sionally, and their use has received almost no
evidence-based support. In two studies of
arthritis self-management education, reinfor-
cement had no effect.16,17 After a diabetes
self-management intervention,18 telephone
follow-up did result in improvement on a
biological measure (lipid ratio) but it `did not
generally produce meaningful incremental
effects'. In that study, reinforcement was
counterproductive on psychosocial measures
(particularly on the Chronic Illness
Resources survey), that is, it `appeared to
produce less improvement. . . than conditions
not receiving the telephone follow-up'. In a
different diabetes self-management program,
`automated telephone reinforcement did not
improve the effectiveness' of the interven-
tion,19 and neither did reinforcement via a
discussion group for peer support.20 In the
latter study, two results were the opposite of
what one would expect: patients who were
randomized to not receive reinforcement
reported greater relief from health-related
distress, and the reduction in their depression
was also greater. In a pilot study of Internet-
based support for self-management of dys-
pnea, patients with chronic lung disease did
not benefit from a booster.21 This is not
intended to be an exhaustive and systematic
review. The six studies cited above were found
during a search for evaluations of reinforce-
ments after chronic-illness self-management
programs. The format, timing, and content of
the self-management programs and of the
reinforcements tested have certainly been
diverse, as have the populations studied and
the outcomes measured (see Appendix), and
the number of studies is small. Even with
those caveats in mind, evidence published to
date, overall, does not lead to the conclusion
that reinforcements are more useful than
non-reinforcement: in the context of self-
management education for people with
chronic illnesses, claims that reinforcements
are necessary and beneficial have little or no
empirical basis.
Are reinforcements to prevent or miti-
gate the decay of impact really needed? If
they are needed, why have they not con-
sistently resulted in better outcomes than
non-reinforcement? In this context, we cite
the statement by Lorig et al.22 indicating
that these programs' effects may appear to
be small because of important differences
among the participants: `It should be noted
that the population is very heterogeneous
for disease, age, education and symptom
distribution. Thus group changes and
mean effect sizes tend to be modest.'22
That explanation implies that the effect
sizes will not be small if they are not based
on whole-group means. For example, there
may be subgroups with very small effects
or perhaps zero effects, which would dilute
(partly hide, efface, or obscure) large
effects in other subgroups. If that is true,
then larger effects will be measured when
homogeneous subgroups are analyzed sep-
arately. Consistent with that idea, some
74 Chronic Illness 9(1)
analyses of subgroups of patients have
already led to findings of potentially
important differences between subgroups
(such as Reeves et al.,23 Swerissen et al.,24
Smeulders et al.25 and Nolte et al.26). In
one of those studies, three subgroups were
defined by their pattern of change after the
intervention: substantial improvement, no
change, and substantial decline.26 A pos-
sible fourth subgroup, one with decay of
impact, has not been studied, but it could
explain why some reinforcements appear to
be ineffective.
The hypotheses
If a subgroup of patients has decay of
impact, that pattern of change could
be hidden by other patterns of change in
other subgroups. Furthermore, if effective
reinforcements are given both to patients
who need them and to those who do not,
then the benefit to those who do need them
will be diluted by the lack of benefit to those
who do not. Therefore, we hypothesize that
decay of impact occurs in only a subgroup of
patients. We also hypothesize that reinforce-
ments can benefit the patients who are most
likely to have decay of impact.
These hypotheses may be relevant to a
variety of interventions. While the preva-
lence of decay and the need for reinforce-
ment could well differ between programs,
what studies of those programs have in
common is that whole-group summary
statistics can conceal large effects in sub-
groups. Imagine a health-education pro-
gram that increases the frequency of
aerobic exercise. Its effect might last for 1
year in some patients and for only 3 months
in others. In that case, even a successful
reinforcement given 3 months after the
original intervention would appear to have
little or no effect unless data from the
subgroup at risk for decay of impact are
analyzed separately.
Testing the hypotheses
These hypotheses can be tested using indi-
vidual-level data. The first step is to cat-
egorize individual patients according to their
pattern of change: decay of impact,
improvement-only, deterioration-only, and
possibly others. Each patient's classification
will depend on that patient's data rather
than on group data, and therefore the most
useful measures will be those with high
reliability, preferably at least 0.9 (p. 265).27
Using data that are as reliable as possible,
the researcher can classify each patient into
a pattern-defined subgroup.
The next step is to describe the prevalence
and magnitude of the decay of impact.
Evidence against the first hypothesis would
be a finding that none or almost none of the
patients had decay of impact. In contrast,
evidence consistent with that hypothesis
would be, for example, a finding that some
patients had decay of impact and others did
not, and a finding that differences in long-
term outcomes between the decay-of-impact
subgroup and other subgroups are large. If
more than a few patients do have decay of
impact, and if that decay is large, then the
next step will be to look for demographic,
clinical, and other predictors of having that
pattern of change, so that patients who are
at a high risk of having decay of impact can
be identified before the decay begins.
Many studies of these interventions have
included only 2 waves of measurement, and
few have lasted longer than 6 months, but
studies of the decay of impact must include
at least 3 waves of measurement and they
may also require longer follow-up.
Studies of health-education programs can
take years of work and large budgets, but it
might be possible to test these hypotheses
now. If the outcome measures are suffi-
ciently reliable, and if the pitfalls of post hoc
analysis of subgroups are avoided,23,28­30
then the hypotheses might be tested with
existing data from long-term studies that
Park et al. 75
have already been completed. The statistical
power of those tests could be increased by
collaborative re-analysis of raw data.31,32
Retrospective and exploratory
approaches to testing the hypotheses could
be supplemented by approaches based on
analogies with theory and evidence from
other contexts. One example is Rothman's
clear distinction between a change in behav-
ior and maintenance of a new behavior.33 In
that theory, maintenance depends on satis-
faction with outcomes, so patients who are
dissatisfied with short-term outcomes of a
self-management program would be pre-
dicted to have decay of impact, at least
with regard to health-related behaviors.
As another example, if the decay of
impact after these interventions is analogous
in important ways to relapse after treatment
for addiction, then the large body of work
on predicting and preventing relapse (as
reviewed by Hendershot et al.34) could be
applied to predict who will have decay of
impact and also to design effective reinforce-
ments. Imagine again a health-education
program that increases the frequency of
aerobic exercise. Some of the patients who
experienced that benefit might `backslide' in
particular situations: e.g. they might not
maintain their new exercise regimen after a
tiring day at work, or when a family member
needs extra attention, or during an acute
exacerbation of their chronic condition.
Each such instance of decay of impact
could be analogous to relapse in a `high-
risk situation,' which has been a main focus
of relapse-prevention research. In addition
to high-risk situations, there are `back-
ground factors that determine an individ-
ual's `set point' or initial threshold for
relapse,' and one is self-efficacy,34 which is
also emphasized in many self-management
interventions for people with chronic ill-
nesses, so it would be reasonable to test
whether self-efficacy and changes in self-
efficacy can be used to predict decay of
impact. Another of those background
factors is social support: it is known to be
important in relapse (as reviewed in
Witkiewitz and Marlatt35) and its role in
decay of impact is worth studying.
Prospectively designed tests of both
hypotheses can be included in future studies.
If the first hypothesis is supported, and if
patients who are likely to have decay can be
identified early enough, then the second
hypothesis can be tested. That is, the effects
of reinforcements can be measured after
they are given only to those patients who are
predicted to have decay, or, better still, to a
randomly selected group of them. The
second hypothesis may be more difficult to
test than the first, at least in part because, as
noted above, self-management programs
and reinforcements are diverse. There are
many possible combinations of frequency,
format, and content of reinforcements, but
only a few of them are likely to be rigorously
tested, so it will be important to design
candidate reinforcements carefully. Here
again, previous findings and a reasonable
theoretical framework could be useful.
Regarding timing, the work of Hennessy
et al.14 on education for HIV/AIDS preven-
tion shows how analysis of the decay of
impact can inform decisions about when
reinforcements should be given. Regarding
content, relapse-prevention theory gives a
logical basis for testing reinforcements
designed to maintain and enhance self-
efficacy. Also, if Rothman's theory33 is
correct (and recent research on weight loss
does support it, e.g. Sciamanna et al.36) then
reinforcements that merely repeat the con-
tent of the original health-education pro-
gram might be less effective than
reinforcements that focus on `perceived sat-
isfaction with received outcomes.'33
After the hypotheses are tested
Even if almost no patients are found to have
substantial decay of impact, those who take
part in these programs would still benefit,
76 Chronic Illness 9(1)
as the idea that reinforcement is unnecessary
would be supported, and resources that are
now used for reinforcements could be saved
or redirected.
If, on the other hand, reinforcements are
both needed and effective for a subgroup of
patients, therewillbeimplicationsforresearch,
and also for how those reinforcements are
designed and implemented. Overall, one goal
would be to minimize the costs of planning and
implementing reinforcements by offering them
preferentially to the patients who are likely to
need them most. Another goal would be to
optimize the target subgroup, format, timing,
and content of reinforcements.
While the reinforcements can be opti-
mized, the original intervention might also
be improved to better fit the needs of
patients who are likely to have decay of
impact. This would alter the criteria by
which these programs are evaluated: more
successful programs would be those after
which very few of the patients at risk for
decay of impact actually have it, and pro-
grams in which the decay is small.

Riemsma et al.16 studied the effects of an
educational program for arthritis self-man-
agement that included group-discussion ses-
sions as boosters at 3, 6, and 9 months. At
the 12-month follow-up, some patients still
had benefits with regard to fatigue and self-
efficacy. However, with regard to pain,
affect, physical health, social interactions,
and self-management behaviors, there were
no statistically significant effects at that
time. They concluded that the booster
sessions did not enhance the effects of the
self-management education.
Lorig and Holman17 studied 589 patients
who participated in an arthritis self-man-
agement educational program. They com-
pared the effects of no reinforcement,
reinforcement in group sessions, and rein-
forcement via a bi-monthly newsletter.
After the program, the reductions in pain,
disability, depression, and the frequency of
physician visits were maintained for
20 months even in the patients who had
no reinforcement, and neither of the two
forms of reinforcement enhanced the origi-
nal program's benefits.

Glasgow et al.18 studied 320 patients who
participated in a diabetes self-management
program. Half of those patients received
reinforcement via seven telephone calls over
12 months from a health counselor and the
other half received no telephone follow-up.
Half of them also received reinforcement
regarding community resources while the
other half did not. That reinforcement had
three parts: (1) information about local
availability of foods for proper nutrition,
(2) eight newsletters over 12 months that
focused on practical support from the com-
munity to maintain proper eating patterns,
and (3) goal setting for related activities
during follow-up meetings 3 months and 6
months after the program. The outcomes
measured were behavioral, biological, and
psychosocial. The results were that patients
who had received telephone follow-up had
greater improvement on only one outcome:
the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL
cholesterol (p < 0.02). One of the psychoso-
cial outcomes was the use of community
resources, which was measured using the
Chronic Illness Resources survey. On that
outcome, perhaps unexpectedly, the patients
who had not received the telephone follow-
up had greater improvement (p < 0.02). The
authors speculated that the effects of one
reinforcement program could have inter-
fered with the effects of the other. That is,
the support received via telephone follow-up
with health counselors might have dimin-
ished the perceived need for support from
the community.
Lorig et al.19 studied 567 people in the
San Francisco Bay Area who had type-2
diabetes. Each was randomly assigned to
one of three groups: wait-list control (usual
care), a 6-week disease-specific self-manage-
ment program with no reinforcement, or the
same program with reinforcement via
monthly automated telephone calls. The
main program and the reinforcements were
given in Spanish. The outcomes measured
were self-efficacy, three indices of health-
system utilization, seven health indicators
(symptoms, HbA1c, activity limitation,
etc.), and four health-related behaviors. At
the time of the 18-month follow-up, there
was a statistically significant difference
between the reinforcement group and the
non-reinforcement group on only one of the
15 outcomes. Specifically, those in the
reinforcement group were more likely to
have monitored their blood-glucose level in
the previous week. The authors concluded
that the `automated telephone reinforce-
ment did not improve the effectiveness' of
the program.
In a study of an Internet-based diabetes
self-management program, Lorig et al.20
compared data from 186 people who had
received reinforcement with data from 209
who had not. The reinforcement comprised
membership in an online discussion group
that was intended to provide peer support.
The measured outcomes were HbA1c,
health distress, activity limitation, psycho-
logical depression, patient activation, self-
efficacy, time doing aerobic exercise, and the
number of physician visits. The results
showed no benefit of the reinforcement.
Unexpectedly, at the 6-month follow-up
the only statistically significant difference
between the reinforcement group and the
non-reinforcement group was that the non-
reinforcement group had a greater decrease
in health distress (effect size for rein-
forcement ¼ -0.234, p ¼ 0.007). Similarly, at
the 18-month follow-up the only statistically
significant difference was that the non-
reinforcement group had a greater decrease
in depression (effect size for rein-
forcement ¼ -0.222, p ¼ 0.018). The authors
concluded that this reinforcement in this
context `appeared to have no value.' They
called for further study of how such a
reinforcement is utilized and of whether
such follow-up interventions are in fact
needed.
Also studying an Internet-based pro-
gram, Nguyen et al.21 conducted a pilot
Park et al. 79
study in 16 people with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease. Some had previously
participated in a dyspnea self-management
program, so for them the Internet-based
intervention was considered to be a boos-
ter. For the others the Internet-based
program was the primary intervention
and there was no reinforcement. There
were 12 outcome measures: the physical
functioning, role-physical, and general
health perception scales of the Medical
Outcomes Study SF-36; time doing exer-
cise (endurance and strengthening, mea-
sured separately); perceived availability of
social support (online and offline, mea-
sured separately); self-efficacy for mana-
ging dyspnea; the `mastery' subscale of the
Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire
(CRQ); dyspnea as measured by the
CRQ; severity of dyspnea-induced distress;
and impact of dyspnea on `normal work'
(housework and work outside home, mea-
sured together). At the 3-month follow-up,
on none of the 12 outcomes was there a
statistically significant difference between
the change in the reinforcement group and
the change in the non-reinforcement
group.
