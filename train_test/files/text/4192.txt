Abstract
Objective: The spectrum of molecular defects in Chinese patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency
(21-OHD), and genotype­phenotype relationships are unknown.
Methods: We screened eight patients with non-classical (NC) 21-OHD and 35 with classical
21-OHD, and detected nine known mutations.
Results: The most frequent mutation among the 43 21-OHD cases was p.Ile172Asn (allele
frequency, 36.0%), followed by c.290-13A/C > G (20.9%), Del (8.6%), p.Pro30Leu (7.0%),
p.Gln318Ter (7.0%), p.Val281Leu (4.7%), p.Arg356Trp (2.3%), p.[Ile236Asn; Val237Glu;
Met239Lys] (2.3%), and E3Á8 bp (1.2%). The frequency spectrum of CYP21A2 mutations in the
Chinese population was similar to that in the Japanese population, except that p.Val281Leu was
identified in Chinese NC21-OHD patients at a frequency of 25.0%, whereas it was absent in
Japanese patients. We found that genotype could predict phenotype in 88.3% of patients.
Conclusion: Some characteristics appear to be unique to the Chinese population, but genotype
was strongly predictive of phenotype.

Introduction
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH),
caused by a deficiency of steroid 21-hydro-
xylase (CYP21A2), is one of the most
common autosomal recessive diseases. Its
incidence was reported to be around 1 in
28,000 in Taiwan,1 but ranges from 1 in
10,000 to 1 in 15,000 live births in most other
populations.2 It causes ambiguous genitalia
at birth in females and inefficient cortisol
synthesis in both genders. Three major
phenotypes of CAH from 21-hydroxylase
deficiency (21-OHD) are described: the clas-
sical salt-wasting form (SW), the classical
simple virilizing form at birth (SV), and the
non-classical form with late-onset symptoms
and diagnosis (NC21-OHD).
The molecular defects in Chinese patients
with NC21-OHD have not been identified.
Therefore, in the present study, we used a
rapid mutation analysis method to ascertain
the prevalence of nine common mutations in
CYP21A2 (complete allele deletion [Del];
c.328delGAGACTAC in exon 3 [E3Á8bp];
p.Gln318Ter in exon 8; p.Arg356Trp
in exon 8; the exon 6 p.[Ile236Asn;
Val237Glu; Met239Lys] cluster; c.290-13A/
C > G in intron 2; p.Ile172Asn in exon 4;
p.Pro30Leu in exon 1; and p.Val281Leu
in exon 7). We also analyzed genotype­
phenotype correlations in Chinese patients
with 21-OHD.2­5
Patients and methods
Study population
Eight female NC21-OHD patients aged
16.5 Æ 4.5 years, and 35 classical 21-OHD
patients (nine SW and 26 SV; 10 males and
25 females) aged 14.5 Æ 10.0 years who were
seen at the Department of Endocrinology,
Peking Union Medical College Hospital
were included in the study. The diagnosis
was made according to clinical manifest-
ations and the 17-hydroxyprogesterone
(17-OHP) assay.5 Polycystic ovary (PCO)
was diagnosed by ultrasound examination
as either 12 or more follicles measuring
2 Æ 9 mm in diameter, or an increased ovar-
ian volume (>10 cm3).6 All subjects were
unrelated Han Chinese who lived in north-
ern China (provinces above the Yangtze
River). All adult patients signed an informed
consent form for DNA analysis. Parents/
guardians signed an informed consent form
for children. The study was approved by the
Ethics Committee of the Peking Union
Medical College Hospital.
Molecular analysis
Genomic DNA was prepared from periph-
eral blood leukocytes using a QIAamp DNA
Blood Mini Kit according to the manufac-
turer's instructions (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany).
CYP21A2 Del detection
PCR amplification of CYP21A2 in several
fragments was performed using oligonucleo-
tide primers A1/A2, as shown in Table 1 and
described below. PCR products were
digested with Taq I to detect mutations,
with the wild-type pattern showing 210 bp
and 187 bp bands of equal intensity. The
absence of one CYP21A2 allele was indi-
cated by a weak 210 bp band, whereas
complete absence of this band indicated
that both CYP21A2 alleles were absent.
E3Á8 bp detection
No PCR product could be amplified from
patients with a homozygous whole-allele
deletion or those with a deletion of
CYP21A2 exon 3. E3Á8 bp could therefore
be ascertained if whole-allele deletion had
been excluded.

fragments of CYP21A2 were amplified using
primer pairs B1/B2 and C1/C2, respectively
(Table 1).3,4 PCR products were purified
using the Wizard DNA clean-up system
(Qiagen), then 5 ml was digested with 10­15
U restriction enzyme for 2­12 h. Mutations
were detected in exon 1 (p.Pro30Leu) using
Aci I, in exon 6 (p.[Ile236Asn; Val237Glu;
Met239Lys]) using Dra III, in exon 8
(p.Gln318Ter) using Pst I, and in exon 8
(p.Arg356Trp) using Aci I. The digests were
subjected to electrophoresis on 2.5%­4.0%
agarose gels (Table 2).
PCR conditions
PCR was performed with approximately
200 ng of genomic DNA, 400 mmol/L of
each primer, and 2.5 U of Taq in a volume
of 50 ml. PCR conditions were 30 cycles of
denaturation at 94C for 20 s, and annealing
and extension at 58C for 90 s (B1/B2) or
68C for 5 min (C1/C2). PCR conditions for
A1/A2 were 35 cycles of denaturation at
94C for 30 s, annealing at 58C for 30 s, and
extension at 72C for 30 s.
c.290-13A/C > G and p.Ile172Asn were
detected using two rounds of PCR. One
microliter of the first-round PCR product
(fragment 1 for c.290-13A/C > G, fragment
2 for p.Ile172Asn) was used as a template for
the second round of PCR with appropriate
primer pairs (7/8 for c.290-13 A/C > G and
C1/9 for p.Ile172Asn). PCR conditions were
30 cycles of denaturation at 94C for 30 s,
annealing at 58C (c.290-13 A/C > G) or

(Table 2).
17-OHP assay
Serum 17-OHP levels were determined using
a commercial radioimmunoassay (DPC, Los
Angeles, CA) with an intra-assay coefficient
of variation of 4.0%. The normal value for
males was a mean of 1.5 mg/L (95% confi-
dence interval, 0.4­3.5 mg/L). The normal
value for females during the follicular stage
was a mean of 0.8 mg/L (95% confidence
interval, 0.2­2.6 mg/L).
Statistical analyses
Continuous data are presented as means Æ
standard deviation where appropriate. The
variables without normal distributions are
expressed as medians plus interquartile
ranges. All analyses were carried out using
SPSS v.22.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk,
NY).
Results
Mutation detection
Among the 43 patients with 21-OHD, we
detected a mutation in 79/86 (91.9%) alleles.
The most common mutation was p.Ile172Asn
with an allele frequency of 36.0%, followed
by c.290-13A/C > G (20.9%), and Del
(18.6%). Together, these three mutations
made up 75.6% of the total (65/86). The
frequencies of the other mutations were
p.Pro30Leu (7.0%), p.Gln318Ter (7.0%),
p.Val281Leu (4.7%), p.Arg356Trp (2.3%),
p.[Ile236Asn; Val237Glu; Met239Lys] (2.3%),
and E3Á8 bp (1.2%). No mutation was
identified in seven alleles.
Genotype data are reported in Table 3
and Table 4. In total, 11 alleles (12.8%) in 10
patients carried two different mutations.
Among 37 patients with mutations detected
on both alleles, the homozygosity frequency
was 10.8% (4/37), combined homozygosity
was 2.7% (1/37), and compound heterozy-
gosity was 86.5% (32/37). The zygosity
status could not be classified for six patients
(14.0%) because no mutation was identified
on at least one of their alleles.
Table 3 and Table 4 show the patients
classified by clinical phenotype. In the SW
group (n ¼ 9), the most common mutation
was Del with an allele frequency of 44.4%,
followed by c.290-13A/C > G (38.9%),
p.Gln318Ter (5.6%), and E3Á8 bp (5.6%).7
These mutations, which are all predicted to
severely compromise 21-hydroxylase enzym-
atic activity, made up 77.3% (17/22) of the
mutant alleles in the SW group. In the SV
group (n ¼ 26), the p.Ile172Asn mutation,
which moderately compromises 21-hydroxy-
lase activity, was found in 44.2% of detected
alleles, followed by c.290-13 A/C> G with an
allele frequency of 17.3% and Del with an
allele frequency of 17.3% also. In the NC21-
OHD group (n ¼ 8), the common mutations
were p.Pro30Leu (allele frequency, 37.5%)
and p.Val281Leu (25.0%), both of which
only mildly compromise 21-hydroxylase
enzymatic activity. All patients in the NC21-
OHD group were homozygotes or compound
heterozygotes with at least one allele carrying
the p.Pro30Leu or p.Val281Leu mutation.
Conversely, no SW patients carried
p.Pro30Leu or p.Val281Leu, and only one
SV patient carried the p.Pro30Leu/
p.Arg356Trp genotype.
Genotype­phenotype correlation
We classified the genotypes into four groups
(Null, Group A, Group B, and Group C)2,7­11
484 Journal of International Medical Research 45(2)
according to the extent of 21-hydroxylase
enzymatic compromise caused by the muta-
tions (Table 5). The Null group comprised
the `severe' genotypes, homozygosity or
compound heterozygosity for mutations
(Del, E3Á8 bp, p.Gln318Ter, p.Arg356Trp,
p.[Ile236Asn; Val237Glu; Met239Lys]), that
are predicted to cause a complete absence of
21-hydroxylase activity. Group A genotypes
were those homozygous for c.290-13A/
C > G, or compound heterozygous with a
mutation in the Null group. Group B
comprised p.Ile172Asn homozygotes or
compound heterozygotes with a Null or
Group A mutation. Group C comprised
homozygotes or compound heterozygotes
for mutations (p.Pro30Leu or p.Val281Leu)
predicted to cause mild 21-hydroylase
enzymatic compromise, or compound het-
erozygotes with Null, Group A, or Group B
mutations. Six patients could not be classi-
fied in this way because no mutation was
identified on one or both alleles. Nine of 11
patients in Group A were SW. Only five in
37 patients had an observed phenotype that
was different from expected (one case in

Analysis of NC21-OHD patients
The seven cases with NC21-OHD presented
mostly with menstrual disturbance, meno-
pause, hirsutism, and acne. Case 8 was
referred to hospital because her mother
had SV 21-OHD. The age at first hospital
visit for Cases 1­8 was 17.7 Æ 3.2 years
(range, 14­20 years). Epiphyseal arrest was
noted at the first examination in Cases 1­7;
their final height was therefore shorter
(151.6 Æ 7.1 cm) than average individuals of
the same age. Physical examination findings
included hirsutism, acne, and mild clitoro-
megaly. Seven patients underwent an
ACTH1-24
stimulation test. Their median
basal 17-OHP level was 18.6 mg/L (range,
2.9­30.1 mg/L); after stimulation it was
82.0 mg/L (range, 11.9­139.1 mg/L). Four
patients had PCO as detected by ultrasound
examination (Table 6). Only two patients
were homozygous for p.Val281Leu or
p.Pro30Leu; the other six were com-
pound heterozygotes for p.Pro30Leu or
p.Val281Leu with a Null, Group A, or
Group B mutation. It is possible that their
offspring would be SW or SV. Case 8 had a
peak 17-OHP level of 9.4 mg/L, which was
below the usual cut-off (10.0 mg/L) for
NC21-OHD diagnosis.
Discussion
CYP21A2 mutations in Chinese
21-OHD patients
The current protocol for the rapid genotyp-
ing of nine mutations causative of 21-OHD
was revised from previous methods3,4 and is
suitable for clinical applications. The sensi-
tivity of detection was 91.9%, in that 79/86

alleles were found to have at least one
mutation. The most frequent mutation in
Chinese patients with 21-OHD was
p.Ile172Asn, with an allele frequency of
36%. However, if the patients were stratified
by disease subtype, the most frequent muta-
tions were Del in SW patients (allele fre-
quency, 44.4%), p.Ile172Asn in SV patients
(44.2%), and p.Pro30Leu in NC21-OHD
patients (37.5%). As yet, the detailed
molecular characterization of Chinese
NC21-OHD patients has not been reported.
The present study is therefore comprehen-
sive because we detected all common muta-
tions, and included all 21-OHD subtypes.
This ensures an accurate reflection of the
true spectrum of CYP21A2 mutations and
facilitates the analysis of the relationship
between genotype and phenotype in these
patients.
According to a previous study of 51
Chinese patients (with no NC21-OHD
cases) in which the Del mutation was not
detected at all,12 the most common mutation
was c.290-13 A/C > G in SW with an allele
frequency of 43%. In contrast, in the present
study, the most common mutation was Del
with an allele frequency of 44.4%, followed
by c.290-13A/C > G (38.9%). Previously,
p.Ile172Asn (40.7%) was the most frequent
mutation in SV patients, followed by c.290-
13A/C > G (18.5%); these findings are simi-
lar to our own (p.Ile172Asn, 44.2%, c.290-
13A/C > G, 17.3%). A study comprising
eight SW and 11 SV patients and one NC
patient from Taiwan showed that the most

prevalent mutation was p.Ile172Asn
(27.5%), followed by c.290-13A/C > G
(25%), then Del (20%).13 The genotype of
the single NC21-OHD patient was
p.Asp183Glu/undetected. In a report of 35
cases from Hong Kong, the most frequent
mutations were Del (28.6%) and c.290-13A/
C > G (28.6%), followed by p.Ile172Asn
(18.5%).14 Furthermore, 11 alleles (12.8%)
in 10 patients carried two different mutations.
This compound heterozygous state probably
arose from large gene conversions or recur-
rent mutation events. The percentage of
homozygous genotypes observed in the pre-
sent study (10.8%) is lower than that reported
in the USA (21%),5 Germany (28%),7 and
Croatia (33%),15 and much lower than in
countries with a high rate of consanguinity
such as Iran (50%)16 and Iraq (50%).17
Among our Chinese NC21-OHD patients,
the most frequent mutation was p.Pro30Leu,
with an allele frequency of 37.5% (6/16). In
contrast, among Caucasian NC21-OHD
patients, the most common mutation was
reported to be p.Val281Leu, with an allele
frequency of 45%­60%.18 The frequency of
the p.Pro30Leu mutation is very low in parts
of the world other than Eastern Asia: 3.6% in
France,19 2.0% in Spain,20 2.2% in Israel,21
and 1.7% in Brazil.22 Japanese patients with
NC21-OHD were similar to Chinese patients
in that the most common mutation was also
p.Pro30Leu with a reported allele frequency
of 50.0% (7/14 alleles) in one study23 and
37.5% (6/16 alleles) in another investigation
of Japanese patients. 24 This suggests that
the characteristics of CYP21A2 mutations
might differ between eastern Asian popula-
tions and others.
The mutational distribution was shown
to be very similar between Chinese and
Japanese populations.23,24 Interestingly,
however, the p.Val281Leu mutation has
not been detected in Japanese patients.23,24
One Japanese NC21-OHD patient was het-
erozygous for p.Val281Leu, but the girl was
born in Japan to Brazilian parents.25 Some
investigators have even speculated that
NC21-OHD does not occur in Asian popu-
lations, or was incorrectly diagnosed, because
they had not observed p.Val281Leu.26 Our
finding of p.Val281Leu at a frequency of 25%
in Chinese NC21-OHD patients provides
evidence to refute this, and suggests a crucial
difference between Chinese and Japanese
cases that most likely reflects the ethnic
differences between these populations. These
observations should be confirmed by the
molecular analysis of additional Chinese
NC21-OHD patients.
The relationship between phenotype
and genotype
21-OHD may increase in severity with a rise
in the extent of 21-hydroxylase comprom-
ise.7­11 Mutations causing the complete loss
of 21-hydroxylase activity are Del, E3Á8 bp,
p.[Ile236Asn; Val237Glu; Met239Lys],
p.Gln318Ter, and p.Arg356Trp. c.290-
13A/C > G leads to almost no enzymatic
activity, while p.Ile172Asn causes a moder-
ate degree of compromise (1%­2% of wild-
type activity), and p.Pro30Leu and
p.Val281Leu are mild mutations that retain
20%­50% of the wild-type activity.12,27
To determine whether genotype can pre-
dict phenotype, we classified the genotypes
into four groups according to severity.
Because 21-OHD is an autosomal recessive
disorder, the allele with the less severe
mutation has the greater influence on pheno-
type. We found that our stratification
method had a positive predictive value
(PPV) of 81.8% (9/11) for predicting SW
21-OHD and a negative predictive value
(NPV) of 96.2% (25/26). The PPV for SV
was 94.1% (16/17) and the NPV was 80.0%
(16/20), while the PPV for NC21-OHD was
88.9% (8/9) and the NPV was 100% (28/28).
The average PPV was high (up to 88.3%)
and the overall NPV was 92.1%. This
suggests that genotype is strongly correlated
with phenotype in Chinese 21-OHD
Zhang et al. 489
patients. Other investigators have found that
the concordance rate between genotype and
phenotype varies among the three forms of
21-OHD.5,28 Speiser et al.29 showed that the
prediction of phenotype from genotype
became more difficult in patients who were
compound heterozygotes or in those carrying
mutations of intermediate severity. Others
found the same results in different popula-
tions.30­32 New et al.33 reported that 98% of
21-OHD patients had a genotype that cor-
responded to the hormonal phenotype.
In the present study, we found that the
genotype could not be used to predict the
phenotype in only five patients. This geno-
type/phenotype discrepancy may be
explained in a number of ways. In the two
p.Gln318Ter/c.290-13A/C > G patients,
alternative splicing causing variable levels
of normal 21-hydroxylase activity might
explain why the phenotype was SV not
SW.34 Furthermore, the p.Ile172Asn muta-
tion, which retains 1%­2% of 21-hydroxy-
lase activity, does not always give rise to SV
so could explain why the single Del/
p.Ile172Asn case manifested as SW not SV.
In the p.Pro30Leu/p.Arg356Trp case, com-
pound heterozygosity may lead to a level of
enzymatic activity intermediate between
that of p.Pro30Leu and p.Arg356Trp homo-
zygotes, possibly explaining why the case
presented as SV not NC21-OHD.
Additionally, the presence of unidentified
rare mutations modulating the phenotype
cannot be excluded.35 Nevertheless, these
genotype­phenotype discrepancies indicate
that great caution must be exercised when
predicting phenotypes after a prenatal diag-
nosis using fetal DNA.36
In conclusion, the genotyping method
presented here is practical, suitable for clin-
ical applications, and clearly illustrates the
close correlation between genotype and
phenotype. We identified many similarities
in the mutational spectrum between Chinese
and Japanese NC21-OHD patients, but dis-
parity was also noted. Thus, the
characterization of NC21-OHD genotypes
in different ethnic populations deserves fur-
ther study.
