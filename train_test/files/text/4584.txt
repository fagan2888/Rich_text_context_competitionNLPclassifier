Abstract
Objective: Next-generation sequencing was performed to evaluate the effects of short-term
application of dexamethasone on human gingiva-derived mesenchymal stem cells.
Methods: Human gingiva-derived stem cells were treated with a final concentration of 10À7 M
dexamethasone and the same concentration of vehicle control. This was followed by mRNA
sequencing and data analysis, gene ontology and pathway analysis, quantitative real-time
polymerase chain reaction of mRNA, and western blot analysis of RUNX2 and b-catenin.
Results: In total, 26,364 mRNAs were differentially expressed. Comparison of the results of
dexamethasone versus control at 2 hours revealed that 7 mRNAs were upregulated and
25 mRNAs were downregulated. The application of dexamethasone reduced the expression of
RUNX2 and b-catenin in human gingiva-derived mesenchymal stem cells.
Conclusion: The effects of dexamethasone on stem cells were evaluated with mRNA sequencing,
and validation of the expression was performed with qualitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction and western blot analysis. The results of this study can provide new insights into the role
of mRNA sequencing in maxillofacial areas.

adipogenic differentiation, respectively1,2
Mesenchymal stem cells play a crucial role
in tissue engineering and regenerative medi-
cine.3 In recent years, stem cells have been
derived from a variety of dental-related
tissues such as the periodontal ligament,
papilla, follicle, dental pulp of exfoliated
deciduous and adult teeth, and maxillary
sinus membrane, which represents a particu-
larly rich source of mesenchymal stem
cells.4,5 Stem cells from dental-related tissues
display multifactorial advantages including
a high proliferation rate, high viability, and
easy induction to distinct cell lineages.4
Moreover, our group has reported that
human gingiva-derived stem cells can be
differentiated into osteoblasts under some
conditions, including within osteogenic
media, and that these cells may be applied
to tissue engineering.6,7
Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid drug
that is broadly used to repress allergic
reactions and treat autoimmune diseases.8
One study revealed that dexamethasone
treatment induced osteonecrosis of the
femoral head via inhibition of osteogenic
differentiation of human bone marrow stem
cells.9 Another study showed that osteo-
blastic MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation was
directly inhibited by dexamethasone via
deviant glucocorticoid receptor activation
and subsequent P53 activation.10 Moreover,
dexamethasone induces bone loss by inhibit-
ing bone formation through suppression
of osteoblast proliferation and collagen
synthesis and by stimulating mature osteo-
clasts.11 As a result, high dosages of gluco-
corticoids can change bone remodeling and
promote bone resorption, which can lead to
osteoporosis.
In certain responses to a variety of
physiological and pathological stimuli, mes-
enchymal stem cells can proliferate and
differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes,
and adipocytes.12 Differentiation of
multipotent mesenchymal stem cells to the
osteoblast lineage and maturation of
osteoprogenitors are regulated and activated
by transcription factors.13 Among these
transcription factors, runt-related transcrip-
tion factor 2 (RUNX2) and the Wnt/
b-catenin signaling pathway are crucial for
osteoblast differentiation.14,15 RUNX2 is a
bone-specific factor and the master regula-
tor of bone formation.15 This transcription
factor has been found to modulate a com-
plex gene-regulatory network during osteo-
blastogenesis.16 Additionally, ablation of
RUNX2 results in the absence of a miner-
alized skeleton in mice and the development
of cleidocranial dysplasia in humans.17 The
inactivation of b-catenin in mesenchymal
progenitor cells exclusively blocks osteo-
blast differentiation.14,18 However, whole-
level gene changes have not been well
described.19 RNA sequencing can detect all
coding and non-coding regions in the cell
and determine their sequence and struc-
ture.20 Massive parallel sequencing can be
performed using next-generation sequencing
or second-generation sequencing.21 The pre-
sent study was performed to evaluate the
effects of short-term application of dexa-
methasone on human gingiva-derived mes-
enchymal stem cells with next-generation
sequencing.
Materials and methods
Isolation and culture of human
gingiva-derived stem cells
Gingival tissues were collected from healthy
patients undergoing clinical crown-length-
ening procedures. The design of the study
was reviewed and approved by the
Institutional Review Board of the Catholic
University of Korea, College of Medicine
(KC11SISI0348). Informed consent was
obtained from all patients according to the
Act on Legal Codes for Biomedical Ethics
and Safety and the Declaration of Helsinki.
Human gingiva-derived stem cells were
isolated and cultivated in accordance with
994 Journal of International Medical Research 45(3)
the procedure described in a previous study
by one of the authors.6 The gingival tissues
were collected and contained in sterile
phosphate-buffered saline (Welgene, Inc.,
Gyeongsan-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Korea)
that included 100 U/mL penicillin and
100 mg/mL streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich
Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) at 4C. The
tissues were de-epithelialized, separated into
1- to 2-mm2 fragments, digested in 0.2-mm-
pore filter, and modified in alpha minimum
essential medium (Gibco; Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) con-
taining dispase (1 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich
Co.) and collagenase type IV (2 mg/mL;
Sigma-Aldrich Co.) for 30 min at 37C.
The cell suspension was filtered with a
70-mm cell strainer (Falcon; BD
Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA),
and the cells were incubated at 37C in a
humidified incubator with 5% CO2
. After 24
hours, the nonadherent cells were washed
with phosphate-buffered saline and replaced
with fresh media every 3 to 4 days.
Cells were plated onto a 100-mm dish
(passage 4) at a density of 1.0 Â 106 cells/well
and cultured in a growth medium including
alpha minimum essential medium (Gibco),
ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich Co.), fetal
bovine serum (Gibco), L-glutamine
(Sigma-Aldrich Co.), penicillin, and strepto-
mycin (Sigma-Aldrich Co.). Dexamethasone
(Sigma-Aldrich Co.) was dissolved in 95%
ethanol to a concentration of 2 Â 10À3 M
(stock solution). The cells were then treated
with a final concentration of 10À7 M dexa-
methasone and the same concentration of
vehicle control (95% ethanol) for 2 and
24 hours. The doses of dexamethasone and
the time points used in the present study
were based on those used in previously
published studies.22,23
Total RNA extraction
The human gingiva-derived stem cells were
harvested at 2 and 24 hours. Total RNA was
isolated using Trizol reagent (Molecular
Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH,
USA). RNA quality was assessed with a
bioanalyzer (Agilent 2100; Agilent
Technologies, Amstelveen, The Netherlands)
using the RNA 6000 Nano Chip (Agilent
Technologies), and the quantity was deter-
mined by spectrophotometer (ND-2000;
Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) with a ratio
of absorbance of >1.8 at 260 and 280 nm.
To confirm high RNA quality for all sam-
ples, we checked whether the RNA integrity
number was >7.0.
Sequencing of mRNA and analysis of data
A library of control and test RNAs was
constructed using SENSE mRNA-Seq
Library Prep Kit (Lexogen, Inc., Vienna,
Austria) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Briefly, each 2 mg of total RNA
was prepared and incubated with magnetic
beads decorated with oligo-dT, and other
RNAs (excluding mRNA) were then
removed with a washing solution. Library
production was initiated by the random
hybridization of starter/stopper heterodi-
mers to the poly(A) RNA still bound to
the magnetic beads. These starter/stopper
heterodimers contained linker sequences
compatible with Illumina (San Diego, CA,
USA). A single-tube reverse transcription
and ligation reaction extends the starter to
the next hybridized heterodimer, where the
newly synthesized cDNA insert is ligated to
the stopper. Second-strand synthesis is per-
formed to release the library from the beads,
and the library is then amplified. Barcodes
were introduced when the library was
amplified. High-throughput sequencing
was performed as paired-end 100-base-pair
sequencing using HiSeq 2500 (Illumina).
RNA-Seq reads were mapped using the
Top Hat software tool (Toronto, ON,
Canada) to obtain the alignment file. The
alignment file was used to assemble tran-
scripts, estimate their abundances, and

detect differential expressions of genes or
isoforms using cufflinks. Gene classification
was based on searches performed using the
BioCarta (http://www.biocarta.com/),
GenMAPP (http://www.genmapp.org/),
DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/),
and Medline databases (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/).
Gene ontology and pathway analysis
Gene ontology analysis was performed and
included osteoblast differentiation, bone
remodeling, and Wnt signaling. P values
were used to denote significance of gene
ontology term enrichment (P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant).
Pathway analysis was also performed for
differentially expressed genes based on the
PATHWAY database of the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.
A fold change of 1.3 was applied in this
study, and a log2 normalized read count of
!4 was applied to minimize false counts.
A P value of <0.05 was considered statis-
tically significant.
Quantification by real-time
polymerase chain reaction
Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells
using GeneJET RNA Purification kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) and
reverse-transcribed. The sense and antisense
primers were designed based on GenBank.
Primer sequences were as follows: RUNX2
Forward 50-AAT GAT GGT GTT GAC
GCT GA-30, Reverse 50-TTG ATA CGT
GTG GGA TGT GG-30; b-catenin Forward
50-GAG GGG TGG GCT GGT ATC
TC-30, Reverse 50-CTC GAC CAA AAA
GGA CCA GA-30; and b-actin Forward
50-TGGCACCCAGCACAATGAA-30,
Reverse 50-CTAAGTCATAGTCCGCCTA
GAAGCA-30. b-actin served as a housekeep-
ing gene for normalization. The expression of
mRNA was detected by real-time polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) using SYBR Green
Real-Time PCR Master Mixes (Enzynomics,
Daejeon, Korea) according to the manufac-
turer's protocol. Quantitative RT-PCR
experiments were repeated three times.
Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in ice-cold RIPA lysis and
extraction buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Inc.) according to the manufacturer's proto-
cols. Whole cell lysates were quantified using
the BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Inc.). Protein samples were loaded and then
transferred for immunoblotting. The mem-
branes were incubated with the following
primary antibodies overnight at 4C: anti-
RUNX2 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge,
UK), anti-b-catenin (BD Biosciences, San
Jose, CA, USA), or anti-GAPDH antibody
(Abcam). After washing, membranes were
incubated with secondary antibody (Abcam)
for 1 hour at room temperature.
Data analysis
mRNA-Seq reads were mapped using Top
Hat software to obtain the alignment file.
Differentially expressed genes were deter-
mined based on counts from unique and
multiple alignments using EdgeR within R
version 3.2.2 (R development Core Team,
2011) with BIOCONDUCTOR version 3.0
(Gentleman et al., 2004). The alignment file
was also used to assemble transcripts, esti-
mate their abundances, and detect differen-
tial expression of genes or isoforms using
cufflinks. We calculated the fragments per
kilobase of exon per million fragments to
determine the expression level of the gene
regions. Global normalization was used
for comparison between samples. Gene
classification was based on searches done
by DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/).
The data are represented as mean Æ stand-
ard deviation of the experiments. Either
Student's t-test or a two-way analysis of

variance with a post-hoc test was performed
to determine the differences between the
groups using a commercially available pro-
gram (SPSS 12 for Windows; SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). The level of significance
was 0.05.
Results
Gene ontology
In total, 26,364 mRNAs were differentially
expressed. Scatter plots, which differentially
expressed the mRNAs, are shown in
Figure 1. The gene ontology analysis results
of the differentially expressed mRNAs are
shown in Figure 2. We focused especially on
osteoblast differentiation (fold change of
1.3, log2 normalized read count of !4 to
minimize false counts, P < 0.05) (Table 1
and Figure 3). First, we assessed the effect of
incubation time on the stem cells.
Comparison of the controls at 24 versus 2
hours revealed that 16 mRNAs were upre-
gulated and 26 were downregulated.
Comparison of the dexamethasone group
at 24 versus 2 hours revealed that 9 mRNAs
were upregulated and 37 were downregu-
lated. Comparison of the data in both
groups at 24 versus 2 hours showed that 4
genes were upregulated and 17 genes were
downregulated. The four genes that were
upregulated were TWIST1, BMP4, BGLAP,
and RDH14, and the 17 genes that were
downregulated were FHL2, GTPBP4,
SMAD3, SNAI2, PENK, LRP5, MEF2D,
EPHA2, AMELX, JUND, MSX2, CHRD,
SEMA7A, PTHLH, JUNB, LRRC17, and
SOX8. However, two genes (ESR1 and
ACHE) showed opposite trends.
Next, we assessed the effect of dexa-
methasone. Comparison of the dexametha-
sone and control groups at 2 hours showed
that 7 mRNAs were upregulated and
25mRNAs were downregulated. Comparison
of the dexamethasone and control groups
at 24 hours revealed that 6 mRNAs
were upregulated and 31 mRNAs were
downregulated. In both groups, 1 gene
(BGLAP) was upregulated and 11 genes
(WWTR1, CREB3L1, LRP5, IGFBP3,
MSX2, SMAD3, RSPO2, CHRD, PTH1R,
WWOX, and SPP1) were downregulated.
However, four genes (ESR1, IGFBP5,
LGR4, and ACHE) showed opposite
trends. Expression of RUNX2 was decreased
in the dexamethasone group at 24 hours.
Decreased expression of CTNNB1 (for
b-catenin expression) was also noted in
the dexamethasone group at 24 hours
(Figure 4).
Validation of mRNA expression
Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the
mRNA levels of RUNX2 and b-catenin
were lower at 24 than at 2 hours (Figure 5).
This change was more significant in the
dexamethasone group at 24 hours.
Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed to
detect protein expression following treat-
ment with dexamethasone at 2 and 24 hours
compared with the untreated group at 2 and
24 hours. Normalization of the protein
expressions revealed 34.3% Æ 4.3% expres-
sion of RUNX2 in the control group at
24 hours and 155.5% Æ 29.8% and
190.3% Æ 71.3% expression of RUNX2 in
the dexamethasone group at 2 and 24 hours,
respectively, when the control value at 2
hours was considered to be 100% (P < 0.05)
(Figure 6). The expression of b-catenin in
the control group was not significantly
different between 2 and 24 hours.
Normalization of the protein expression
revealed 95.2% Æ 14.5% expression of
b-catenin in the control group at 24 hours
and 66.8% Æ 13.5% and 73.6% Æ 43.9%
expression of b-catenin in the dexametha-
sone group at 2 and 24 hours, respectively,
when the control value at 2 hours was
considered to be 100% (Figure 6).

Discussion
In this report, we examined the effects of
predetermined concentrations of dexa-
methasone on stem cells at 2 and 24 hours.
Sequencing of mRNA and validation of the
expression was performed with qualitative
RT-PCR and western blot analysis. The
application of dexamethasone clearly
resulted in reduced expression of RUNX2

mesenchymal stem cells.
Stem cells derived from the gingiva were
used in the present study; these cells have
also been applied to tissue engineering.24
Human gingiva-derived mesenchymal stem
cells from the maxillofacial region can be
considered a favorable source of mesenchy-
mal stem cells because harvesting these cells
from the mandible or maxilla can easily
be performed under local anesthesia.6,25
Moreover, one study revealed that human
gingiva-derived mesenchymal stem cells
are superior to bone marrow-derived mes-
enchymal stem cells for cell therapy in
regenerative medicine.26
Two time points (2 and 24 hours) were
selected to evaluate the effects of the dexa-
methasone incubation time. The immediate
effects of dexamethasone were evaluated
using the 2-hour results, and the more sus-
tained effects were evaluated by using the
24-hour results. More pronounced effects
were observed at 24 hours because of the
cumulative effects of dexamethasone. Short-
term, high-dose dexamethasone reportedly
predisposes patients to complicated fracture
union, especially patients with angle frac-
tures.27 However, long-term physiologic
concentrations of dexamethasone resulted in
more intense staining for alkaline phosphat-
ase in human bone-derived cells.28

formed in a high-throughput manner and is

diseases.30 HiSeq (Illumina), Roche 454
(Roche, Branford, CT, USA), and SOLiD
(Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD,
USA) systems are representative sequencers
used for next-generation sequencing.
Among them, the HiSeq is reportedly has
particularly high-speed data quality and
complete end-to-end sequencing solutions.31
The sequencing data showed the expres-
sion of a total of 26,364 mRNAs. Gene
ontology analysis of mRNAs related to
osteoblast differentiation was then per-
formed. Previously, mRNA expression was
measured by microarray methods or RT-
PCR techniques.32 These techniques are
limited to the detection of known transcripts
and have a limited capacity to differentiate
between transcript variants.33 Although
RNA sequencing is still a technology under
active development, it offers several advan-
tages over existing technologies, including
determination of all coding and non-coding
regions; additionally, it is a popular method
for genome analysis.20,34 Notably, however,
genes with low expression abundance might
not be detected.35
Western blot analysis was performed to
detect the protein expression of RUNX2
and b-catenin and provide information
regarding possible mechanisms. Canonical
Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathways are
reportedly crucial for the osteoblastic lin-
eage.36 Wnt signaling suppresses mesenchy-
mal stem cell commitment to the
chondrogenic and adipogenic lineages and
enhances the osteoblastic lineage, and both
RUNX2 and b-catenin are major regulators
of this signaling.37 RUNX2 regulates a
complex gene-regulatory network during
osteoblastogenesis and upregulates various
osteoblast lineage-specific genes.38 One
study revealed that RUNX2-targeting
miRNAs might be essential to ensure
that the RUNX2 level is attenuated at
key stages of osteoblast lineage progression
to accommodate the biological functions
of RUNX2 in mesenchymal cell-fate

determination and maturation of osteo-
blasts.13 Inactivation of b-catenin in mes-
enchymal stem cells was shown to totally
block osteoblast differentiation as well
as mesenchymal cell differentiation into
chondrocytes in the perichondrium and
calvarium.39 Dexamethasone has been
shown to induce osteoporosis mainly by
suppressing osteoblast-mediated osteogen-
esis; however, the precise mechanisms
involved in these signaling pathways remain
unclear.40 For this reason, we examined the
canonical Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathways
in the present study and focused on changes

in RUNX2 and b-catenin. The expression of
RUNX2 was decreased by 70% after
24 hours of incubation with dexamethasone;
the result for b-catenin was similar to this.
We performed quantitative RT-PCR and
western blot to validate this result by com-
paring mRNA and protein levels. Moderate
consistency was found between the sequen-
cing data and the RT-PCR results.
The effects of dexamethasone on stem cells
were evaluated by mRNA sequencing, and
the expression was validated by quantitative
RT-PCR and western blot analysis. The
results clearly showed that the application
of dexamethasone reduced the expression of
RUNX2 and b-catenin in human gingiva-
derived mesenchymal stem cells. This study
may provide new insights into the role of
mRNA sequencing in maxillofacial areas.
