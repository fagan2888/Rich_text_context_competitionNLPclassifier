The American Society of Clinical Oncology and the National
Cancer Institute convened a symposium in June 1996 on
tobacco addiction. Additional support for the symposium
was provided by the American Medical Women's Associa-
tion and the American Society of Preventive Oncology. The
goals of this conference were to describe the burden and
public health consequences of tobacco addiction, to describe
the state of science for the treatment of nicotine dependence,
and to explore new strategies to increase quit rates and to
prevent the uptake of tobacco use. This article summarizes
and integrates the meeting presentations on tobacco addic-
tion and includes the topics of smoking prevalence; psycho-
biologic aspects of nicotine dependence; and implications for
disease, treatment, and prevention. Comments on regulatory
approaches and national strategies for reducing dependence
are also summarized in presentations by Dr. David Kessler,
former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner, and
Dr. C. Everett Koop, former U.S. Surgeon General. [J Natl

``Tobacco drieth the brain, dimmeth the sight, vitiateth the smell, hurteth
the stomach, destroyeth the concoction, disturbeth the humors and spirits,
corrupteth the breath, induceth a trembling of the limbs, exsicateth the
windpipe, lungs, and liver, annoyeth the milt, scortcheth the heart, and
causeth the blood to be adjusted.''

Introduction
Organization of the ASCO/NCI Conference on Tobacco
Addiction (1)
More than 300 years after Tobias Verner made the above
observations, most were officially confirmed in a report to the
U.S. Surgeon General on the health consequences of smoking
(2). By then, our nation was in the midst of the current epidemic
of tobacco-related disease. The ensuing 3 decades of experience
since the original Surgeon General's report on tobacco smoking
have brought additional sobering insights. First, adverse health
consequences extend to noninhaled forms of tobacco (3). Sec-
ond, simple provision of information about the consequences of
tobacco use to the public is insufficient to end the epidemic. Less
than 3% of smokers become nonsmokers each year (4). Third,
tobacco use is not simply a habit, but an addiction. Less than
15% of Americans who quit smoking for a day remain abstinent
1 year later (4,5). Finally, and tragically, with its inception in
early adolescence, tobacco addiction is a pediatric disease, not
simply an affliction of adulthood. The median age of initiation to
tobacco use is below 15 years in many countries (6).
The treatment of nicotine dependence may require the same
type of behavioral, societal, and pharmacologic strategies ex-
tended to the management of other abused substances, such as
alcohol, cocaine, and heroin. With this in mind, the American
Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the National Cancer
Institute (NCI) convened a symposium in June 1996 on tobacco
addiction. Additional support for the symposium was provided
by the American Medical Women's Association and the Ameri-
can Society of Preventive Oncology. In keeping with ASCO's
published position statement on tobacco control (7), the goals of
this conference were to describe the burden and public health
consequences of tobacco addiction, to describe the state of sci-
ence for the treatment of nicotine dependence, and to explore
new strategies to increase quit rates and to prevent the uptake of
tobacco use. This article cannot review all aspects of nicotine
dependence, but it will summarize and integrate the meeting
presentations on tobacco addiction and include the topics of
smoking prevalence; biologic aspects of nicotine dependence;
and implications for disease, treatment, and prevention. Regu-
latory approaches and national strategies for reducing depen-
dence are also summarized in presentations by Dr. David
Kessler, former Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commis-
sioner, and Dr. C. Everett Koop, former U.S. Surgeon General.

(see Appendix Table 1 for a list of the participants and their
institutions).
The Epidemic of Tobacco Use (8)
The former Surgeon General has stated that cigarette smoking
is the chief avoidable cause of death in our society, and many
believe that it represents the most important public health issue
of our time. In the United States, there are an estimated 434000
deaths per year from tobacco use, equating to about 1200 per day
or about 50 per hour. Tobacco is responsible for the yearly
deaths of more Americans than alcohol, cocaine, heroin, homi-
cide, suicide, car accidents, fires, and acquired immunodeficien-
cy syndrome combined (9).
Approximately one quarter of the U.S. adult population
(about 48 million people) currently smoke (10,11) Approxi-
mately one fifth of U.S. high school seniors smoke daily. The
rate is much greater among school dropouts. After a decline
through the late 1970s and early 1980s (10), followed by roughly
stable rates, current smoking among high school students in-
creased from 27.5% in 1991 to 30.5% in 1993 to 34.8% in 1995
(12,13). Thus, adult smokers who quit or die are being replaced
by children who smoke.
There have also been sharp increases in the past 2 decades in
the use of smokeless tobacco, occurring almost exclusively
among males between the ages of 18 and 34 years (10). For
example, from 1970 through 1991, the percentage of males un-
der age 25 years who reported using either chewing tobacco or
moist snuff rose from 2.2% to 8.4%. During the same period,
cigarette smoking for this group declined from 38% to 22.9%.
More than 5 million users of moist snuff are reported in the
United States alone (14).
In recent decades, U.S. rates of lung cancer have increased
among both men and women, and, in the late 1980s, lung cancer
surpassed breast cancer as the most common cancer killer of
women. Recently, a decline has been observed in age-adjusted
mortality from lung cancer among men, consistent with their
reduction in smoking (15). Unfortunately, this decline has not
yet been observed among women, for whom the increase in lung
cancer mortality continues. This pattern is consistent with the
fact that the rise in women's smoking occurred subsequent to
that in men. It is estimated that 43 900 and 66 000 women will
die of breast and lung cancer, respectively, in 1997 (15).
The impact of smoking is a growing worldwide problem.
Peto et al. (16,17) estimated that, in developed countries in 1995,
there would be about 2 million deaths attributable to smoking--
1.5 million men and 0.5 million women. In the former socialist
economies of Eastern Europe, serious increases in smoking-
attributed deaths are occurring, particularly among men. Rates
for women are steadily increasing, but at a lower rate than for
men; however, these rates are expected to increase as tobacco
marketing efforts focus on these women.
Reliable data are more difficult to obtain from some of the
developing countries. The general pattern reported is a high
prevalence of smoking among men (for example, >60% in Ban-
gladesh and India) but much lower use among women (except-
ing Nepal, which has high rates among both men and women).
A similar pattern is seen in the Pacific Region, including China,
where estimates in the 1980s showed more than 60% of men but
less than 10% of women smoking (18). The concern is that
tobacco marketing will target the women in these populations.
Peto et al. have estimated that global tobacco-related deaths
will exceed 3 million per year in the 1990s. In 30­40 years,
global tobacco-related deaths could exceed 10 million annually
(19). The World Health Organization projects that, unless some-
thing is done, one in 10 people now alive will die of a tobacco-
related disease.
Benefits of Quitting
The benefits of cessation and their impact on the public health
are substantial. Compared with nonsmokers, smokers exhibit a
dose-dependent increase in the risk of dying from lung (20),
pancreatic (21), head and neck, and renal (22) cancers, as well as
a twofold increase in risk of developing bladder cancer (23) and
leukemia (24) and a threefold increase in risk of myeloma (24).
Moreover, it is clear that former smokers live longer than con-
tinuing smokers and that the benefits of quitting extend into the
later age groups. In comparison with continuing smokers, people
who quit smoking before age 50 years show a 50% reduction in
risk for all causes of death in the subsequent 16 years, and, by
age 64 years, their risk of mortality is similar to that of never
smokers of the same age (9). As shown in Table 1, factors such
as health status at the time of quitting, duration of abstinence,
and previous level of tobacco exposure determine the magnitude
of risk reduction achieved. For example, relative to nonsmokers,
the mortality ratio for males with no concurrent illness who
smoked more than 21 cigarettes per day averaged 2.73 for cur-
rent smokers and 1.77 for former smokers with 6­10 years of
abstinence. In the case of cancer mortality, the change in rates
may also vary by site. For example, a 30%­50% reduction in
lung cancer mortality risk has been noted for both sexes and for
all histologic types after 10 years of nonsmoking; whereas, for
cancer of the bladder or kidney, the risk to former smokers may
be reduced by 50% within a few years following smoking ces-
sation. A 50% reduction in risk for cancer of the oral cavity and
esophagus has been observed as soon as 5 years after cessation
(9).
Implications for Disease and Prevention
Tobacco Use and Carcinogens (25)
Nicotine dependence provides the link through which smok-
ers are repeatedly exposed to carcinogenic and genotoxic ele-
ments associated with tobacco consumption. In the case of lung
cancer, smokers are exposed in dose-dependent fashion to the
major carcinogens underlying the disease, as shown in Table 2.
These carcinogenic compounds are the polynuclear aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs), typified by the classical carcinogen ben-
zo[a]pyrene (BaP), and the nicotine-derived tobacco-specific ni-
trosamine, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone
(NNK). PAH and NNK are powerful pulmonary carcinogens in
rodents, inducing tumors at total doses similar to those encoun-
tered in a lifetime of smoking (26,27). The metabolic activation
and detoxification pathways for PAH and NNK are well under-
stood and are the same in rodents and humans, although there are
quantitative differences (28,29). The DNA adducts that are
formed from PAH and NNK have been well characterized, and
Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Vol. 89, No. 24, December 17, 1997 SPECIAL ARTICLE 1853
their role as major factors in the carcinogenic process has been
established (30,31). These same DNA adducts are found in the
lungs of smokers (30,31), and the role of specific adducts in
causing permanent mutations has been elucidated (32). The
bulky adducts resulting from the metabolic activation of BaP
and NNK cause G to T mutations, while the methyl adducts
formed from NNK produce G to A mutations. These mutations
have been detected in K-ras oncogenes and p53 tumor sup-
pressor genes isolated from lung tumors in smokers, and a dose-
response relationship has been noted between G to T mutations
in p53 and cigarette smoke exposure (33,34) As shown in Fig. 1,
dependence on nicotine is a prerequisite to the multistage pro-
cess of lung carcinogenesis, in which these mutations play a
critical role (35). Moreover, in addition to their role in lung
cancer, the nitrosamines are also considered major causative
factors for cancers of the esophagus and pancreas. Both PAH
and nitrosamines have been causally related to oral cancer, and
aromatic amines have been associated with bladder cancer in
smokers (26,36).
Virtually all known carcinogens in tobacco products require
metabolic activation for binding to DNA. There are competing
detoxification reactions. The balance between metabolic activa-
tion and detoxification in an individual will, in part, determine
that person's risk for cancer upon carcinogen exposure. This
balance is in large measure determined by individual levels and
activities of carcinogen metabolizing enzymes, such as cyto-
chromes P450, glutathione S-transferases, N-acetyltransferases,
and uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferases (37).

specific carcinogen adducts to DNA or protein provides one way
of distinguishing individuals with differing risks of cancer. For
example, the higher risk of lung cancer in African-American
smokers than in Caucasian smokers may be related to poorer
detoxification of NNK (38). Another example is found in
the higher levels of 4-aminobiphenyl hemoglobin adducts in
smokers with a higher risk of bladder cancer. Adduct levels are
controlled in part by dose and by one's ability to activate the
carcinogen via cytochrome P450 1A2 or to detoxify it by N-
acetylation (39).
Smokeless Tobacco (40)
Smokeless tobacco users are also exposed to high concentra-
tions of nicotine carcinogenic nitrosamines. The three leading
brands of moist snuff in the United States, Copenhagen, Skoal,
and Kodiak, contain substantial amounts of nicotine (i.e., 10.9­
11.9 mg/g tobacco). Importantly, 22%­60% of this nicotine is in
the unprotonated form because of the relatively high pH (3).
Unprotonated nicotine is rapidly absorbed through the oral mu-
cosa (41). By contrast, products with a lower market share, such
as Hawken and Skoal, have significantly lower amounts of avail-
able nicotine (3).
Carcinogenic nitrosamines are formed from nicotine and
other tobacco alkaloids during the manufacturing of moist snuff
products (3). The two most carcinogenic nitrosamines in tobacco
products are N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) and NNK. They are
present in average amounts of 7.7 and 1.2 g/g tobacco, respec-
tively, and their structures are shown in Fig. 2.
The levels of NNN and NNK are far higher than those of
carcinogens in any other consumer product (42). Moreover, con-
centrations of NNN and NNK in U.S. moist snuff products have
not substantially changed over the past 20 years (43). A bioassay
of these two compounds applied to the oral cavity of the rat
demonstrated a substantial and statistically significant incidence
of oral tumors (44). A recent study (45) has also demonstrated an
association between NNK metabolites in the urine of snuff-
dippers and the presence of oral leukoplakia.
Tobacco Use and Chemoprevention (25)
Cessation of all tobacco use is clearly the best way to prevent
tobacco-related cancers, but recent studies suggest that chemo-
prevention may be a way to partially counteract carcinogen ex-
posure associated with continued use of tobacco. This approach
may be particularly important for the heavily nicotine-dependent
smoker, whose successful long-term abstinence may require
multiple cessation attempts and/or intensive treatment efforts
before it can be achieved. For example, a near lifetime admin-
istration of phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), which occurs
naturally as a conjugate in watercress and other cruciferous veg-
etables, has been shown to inhibit lung cancer induction in rats
treated with NNK (46,47). PEITC selectively inhibits the meta-
bolic activation of NNK in the rat lung (48,49) and in humans
exposed to PEITC through watercress consumption (50). A large
number of naturally occurring compounds are available that are
able to inhibit lung tumor development caused by NNK or BaP
(46) that could be employed for the chemoprevention of lung
cancer in smokers. Some compounds, such as myo-inositol, can
also inhibit lung cancer in animals when administered after car-
cinogen exposure and could potentially be useful for the che-
moprevention of lung cancer in ex-smokers (51). However, the
inverse relationship recently observed between lung cancer in-
cidence and -carotene supplementation among smokers (52,53)
indicates that caution should be exercised in this high-risk group.
The potential application of chemoprevention strategies has
been discussed elsewhere (54), and, although chemopreventive
agents hold promise, more research is needed to determine
whether they are effective at reducing the cancer risk of smok-
ers.
Tobacco Use and Molecular Epidemiologic Approaches to
Risk Identification (55)
The risk assessment process is often multidisciplinary and
complex because of interindividual variation in susceptibility to
cancer. Understanding this process can allow us to identify
smokers with the highest risks of developing cancer, perhaps
targeting them for intensive smoking cessation interventions,
chemoprevention trials, or tailored educational messages. Mo-
lecular epidemiology provides a means for studying the mul-
tistep processes that occur between exposure and cancer, and
results from these investigations highlight the role of genetic
susceptibility in carcinogenesis.
Cigarette smoking is the major determinant of lung cancer;
yet, fewer than 20% of lifetime cigarette smokers will develop
lung cancer. The risk of lung cancer depends on the dose of
tobacco, the duration of smoking, the types of tobacco, the type
of cigarette, and host susceptibility. Sometimes, gene­
environment interactions are suggested even by natural sub-
groups within the population. For example, it has been reported
(56) that the odds ratios for major lung cancer types were con-
sistently higher for women than for men at every level of expo-
sure to cigarette smoke. Furthermore, this sex difference could
not be explained by differences in baseline exposure, smoking
history, or body size, suggesting that it was the result of higher
susceptibility to tobacco carcinogens among women. Genetic
factors may influence carcinogen absorption, distribution, or ac-
cumulation in target tissue and thereby modulate the internal
levels of exposure [e.g., genetic polymorphisms in the enzymes
responsible for activation {cytochrome P450s} and detoxifica-
tion {glutathione S-transferase enzymes (57)} of tobacco car-
cinogens].
Another determinant of susceptibility to carcinogens may be
mutagen sensitivity, which can be measured in an in vitro assay
of mutagen-induced chromatid breaks in cultured lymphocytes.
Individuals with large numbers of breaks are considered to be at
higher risk of developing cancer because of a decreased ability
to repair induced damage. Case-control studies (58­61) have
indicated that bleomycin-induced mutagen sensitivity is an in-
Fig. 2. Structures of nicotine, Nnitrosonornicotine (NNN), and 4-(methyl-
nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK).

dependent risk factor for head and neck and lung cancers. A
meta-analysis of three case-control studies of heavy smokers
(62) showed an odds ratio of 11.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]
 5.0­26.6) for cancers of the head and neck in the absence of
the hypersensitive phenotype. However, among heavy smokers
who exhibited mutagen hypersensitivity, the odds ratio was 44.6
(95% CI  17.4­114). Similar interactions have been noted for
lung cancer susceptibility. It is informative to compare never
smokers and former smokers stratified on the basis of mutagen
sensitivity. Compared with those who never smoked and who
were not mutagen sensitive (the reference group), those who
never smoked but were mutagen sensitive had a twofold el-
evated risk. Former smokers who were not mutagen sensitive
were still at increased risk (about threefold). Thus, exposure to
sufficient levels of tobacco smoke can overwhelm whatever
nonsusceptible genotype or phenotype one has. Finally, for those
who were mutagen sensitive and who smoked, the risk was
much higher, indicating an interaction between mutagen sensi-
tivity and smoking.
Another example is a restriction fragment length polymor-
phism in codon 72 of the p53 gene, which has been implicated
in lung cancer risk. Patients with the susceptible genotype (cod-
ing for Proline/Proline) appeared to have an earlier age at diag-
nosis and lower mean cigarette pack-years1 of exposure than did
patients with the Arginine/Arginine- or the Arginine/Proline-
coding genotypes (63). These and other results suggest that in-
dividuals with a susceptible genotype tend to develop cancer at
earlier ages and with less cigarette exposure. It is interesting that
there are considerable ethnic differences in the prevalence of the
susceptible genotype, with estimates of 26% for whites, 20% for
African-Americans, 10% for Japanese, and only 2.5% for Mexi-
can-Americans; this observation may partly explain the latter
group's lower rates of lung cancer.
It is likely that there are numerous genotypic factors that
together explain differences in risk. The metabolism of the many
carcinogens in cigarette smoke is complex. Thus, multiple sus-
ceptibility factors must be accounted for to represent the true
dimensions of gene­environment interactions and to construct
the most appropriate quantitative risk-assessment models.
Psychobiological Aspects of Nicotine Dependence
Although the initiation of tobacco use may be dependent on
social factors (e.g., peer use, parental approval, and poor school
performance) and the marketing efforts of tobacco companies,
biologic factors play a fundamental role in the development of
nicotine dependence and pose significant barriers to achieving
tobacco abstinence (64,65). Among those trying even a single
cigarette, 33%­50% will become nicotine dependent (66).
Among regular tobacco users, the incidence of dependence is
even more substantial, ranging from 70% to 90% (67­69). In
fact, the risk of developing dependence to tobacco is higher than
that observed following initial use of cocaine or alcohol
(67,68,70). The effects of nicotine involve subtle, diverse, and
behaviorally relevant psychoactive properties, the development
of pharmacologic tolerance, and a reduction in symptoms of
withdrawal following nicotine administration. Understanding
these factors may provide insight into the mechanisms respon-
sible for the development of nicotine dependence and improve
our approach to treatment.
Chemistry of Nicotine (71)
Nicotine is a water- and lipid-soluble base with a pKa of 8.0
(64,72). Thus, nicotine delivered in alkaline cigar and pipe
smoke and smokeless tobacco is readily absorbed across muco-
sal membranes of the mouth and nose (64,72). Cigarette smoke
is acidic and, for effective absorption, must be inhaled in the
pulmonary alveoli, where absorption is rapid (72­74).
Cigarettes contain 6­11 mg of nicotine, of which the smoker
can absorb 1­3 mg irrespective of tobacco company provided
nicotine-yield ratings and which is sufficient to establish and
sustain nicotine dependence (72,75). A typical pack per day
cigarette smoker absorbs 20­40 mg of nicotine each day, achiev-
ing concentrations of 25­35 ng/mL of plasma by the afternoon
(72). The plasma half-life of nicotine is approximately 2 hours,
and the half-life of its primary metabolite, cotinine, is approxi-
mately 20 hours (76).
Psychophysiological Responses to Nicotine
Nicotine is rapidly distributed from the bloodstream, binding
to various tissues and activating nicotinic cholinergic receptors
or binding sites. Activation of these receptors leads to alteration
of spontaneous electroencephalogram and evoked brain electri-
cal potentials, alteration of local cerebral glucose metabolism,
modulation of adrenal and pituitary hormones, an increased
heart rate, and changes in skeletal muscle tension (72). The
effects may also produce pleasure and satisfaction in humans
and are sufficiently rewarding to lead animals as well as humans
to press levers that lead to repeated injections of nicotine
(64,72,77). In addition, evidence also suggests that nicotine may
enhance vigilance, memory, and task performance, independent
of withdrawal relief (78­81).
Nicotine's diverse, yet subtle, psychoactive actions may be
related to its simultaneous actions on many types of neurons and
its effects on the release of dopamine, norepinephrine, and se-
rotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT). These neurotransmitter
systems may be modulated by nicotine's direct or indirect ef-
fects on receptors or through its other cholinergically mediated
actions (72). Nicotine's effect on dopamine release (nucleus ac-
cumbens) and synthesis in the mesolimbic system may be im-
portant to the motivational and reinforcing properties of the drug
(82,83). Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens has been
associated with self-administration of nicotine, opiates, and co-
caine; brain electrical stimulation; anticipation of eating and
sexual behavior; the effects of rewards or incentives (83); and
avoidance of aversive stimuli (81). Nicotine may also increase
turnover of norepinephrine in the hypothalamus and release in
the locus coeruleus. This type of noradrenergic stimulation has
been related to enhanced attention to significant stimuli and
reduction in the salience of irrelevant stimuli (81). Moreover,
nicotine may stimulate 5-HT release in the median raphe nuclei,
where high-affinity nicotine binding sites exist, as well as sero-
tonergic neurons in the hypothalamus and striatum (83). Such
actions could have implications for understanding the relation-
ship between smoking and depressed mood, given the favorable
clinical response of patients with major depression treated with
serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (84).
Recent studies (85) also suggest that an up-regulation (i.e.,
increased expression) of nicotine receptors may result with
1856 SPECIAL ARTICLE Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Vol. 89, No. 24, December 17, 1997
chronic use, but many of these receptors are desensitized or
inactive. Tolerance may develop as capacity to recruit new re-
ceptors to compensate for desensitization is outstripped by their
rate of inactivation (86). In contrast, down-regulation (i.e., de-
creased expression) may take place when chronic use is termi-
nated. This process has been referred to as metabolic tolerance,
and its regulation may have a substantial genetic component
(86).
Most, if not all, effects of nicotine on the central nervous
system are dose dependent, and tolerance has been observed to
differing degrees across many effects (64,72). Nicotine tolerance
appears to be acquired substantially during youth as individuals
progress from smoking a few cigarettes on initial exposure to
higher levels of consumption (87,88). After a period of nicotine
exposure assumed to be at least ``several weeks'' (89), physical
dependence on nicotine may ensue. It has been suggested (86)
that repeated exposure to nicotine produces tolerance in sensi-
tive individuals, which in turn reduces the net effect of the drug.
This leads to a compensatory increase in consumption to obtain
the desired effect (i.e., dependent smoking). Less sensitive per-
sons may acquire little or no tolerance to nicotine, remaining
nonsmokers after initial experimentation or becoming ``chip-
pers,'' or intermittent users of tobacco (86). Chippers show little
evidence of nicotine withdrawal or impaired cognitive perfor-
mance when deprived of nicotine (78). In contrast, the depen-
dent person appears to function normally only when under the
influence of nicotine. Nicotine dependent persons also report
feeling ``abnormal'' or ``not right'' when deprived for more
than a few hours (89,90). Although nicotine administration can
cause intoxication and behavioral disruption in the nicotine na-
ive person over time, optimal performance for most smokers on
behavioral and cognitive tasks requires sustained nicotine ad-
ministration, with adverse performance effects accompanying
nicotine deprivation.
The nicotine withdrawal syndrome has been described in de-
tail and includes symptoms of increased anxiety, irritability, and
appetite and decreased cognitive capabilities and heart rate
(72,89­95). Strong tobacco cravings are also common. Onset
begins within a few hours of the last cigarette and includes an
increased tendency to smoke, impaired cognitive function, and
altered electrocortical function (91,92,95). Withdrawal symp-
toms peak within a few days and then begin to recede over the
next several weeks. However, most individuals who try to quit
smoking relapse before the syndrome subsides (64,95). Even the
continuing smoker experiences withdrawal symptoms during
each day of smoking, which presumably minimizes the duration
of abstinence that can be tolerated (65).
Nicotine replacement does not appear to shorten the course of
the syndrome, but it can reduce severity of the symptoms to the
more tolerable levels typically observed after about 4­5 weeks
of untreated abstinence. Some withdrawal symptoms, particu-
larly cognitive impairment, cravings, and irritability, may persist
for months or more in some individuals (72,95).
Smoking and Negative Mood States (96)
There is considerable evidence (97) to suggest that smoking
behavior is influenced by an individual's vulnerability to expe-
rience depressed or dysphoric mood. For example, depressive
mood and a history of major depressive disorder (MDD) are
more prevalent among smokers than among nonsmokers (odds
ratio  2.9; 95% CI  1.7­4.9) (69,97­100), more tightly
linked to nicotine dependent than nondependent smoking
(67,99), positively related to daily cigarette consumption (100),
predictive of greater withdrawal severity and withdrawal in-
duced depressive symptoms (101,102), and associated with a
decreased likelihood of quitting smoking (97,98,102,103).
Moreover, most of the time (60%) this disturbance in mood
precedes the development of tobacco dependence (104).
The relationship between smoking and negative affect is also
similar for nonclinical disturbances of mood. For example, as
shown in Fig. 3, data from the Health Promotion Disease Pre-
vention supplement to the 1991 National Health Interview Sur-
vey (43732 households) (105) indicate that the odds of being a
smoker increase with rising levels of daily negative mood (e.g.,
depression, loneliness, boredom, etc.). Although the effects are
significant for both sexes at the higher levels of negative mood,
they are apparent sooner for women than for men. The presence
of nonclinical levels of negative affect may also characterize as
many as 50% of all smoking lapses (106­109). In fact, an ex-
tensive prospective study of relapse (109) showed that 19% of
lapses were reported under conditions of extreme negative af-
fect, with 62% of these episodes occurring during interpersonal
conflict (arguing). Studies also show that smokers who believe
that smoking is an effective affect management strategy are less
likely to quit (110) and that postcessation depression and nega-
tive affect are the symptoms of withdrawal that best predict
relapse (102,111­113).
Implications for Treatment
Self-Quitting in the General Population (96)
It is estimated that about 48.5% of the population of ``ever''
smokers (90 million people) have already stopped smoking. Un-
fortunately, the decline in smoking prevalence appears to have
plateaued in the last 3­4 years (114). Smoking cessation con-
tinues to be a difficult proposition for most people. In the 1994
National Health Interview Supplement (NHIS-2000), it was es-
timated that, of the 48 million adult smokers, 69.3% want to stop
Fig. 3. Odds ratio for smoking according to negative mood score and gender.

smoking completely. Approximately 46.4% of current everyday
smokers made a serious cessation attempt (stopped for at least 1
day) in the 12 months prior to the survey (11), although only
13.8% of this group, and 5.7% of all the smokers, successfully
abstained from tobacco use for at least 1 month (NHIS-Health
Promotion and Disease Prevention Supplement) (5). It was es-
timated that only 2.5% of all smokers quit smoking permanently
each year (5).
It is interesting that the majority of former smokers (85%)
report a preference for quitting on their own, using mostly ``cold
turkey'' (85%) or gradual reduction (13%) approaches to ces-
sation (115). Only 15% of the former smokers report using as-
sisted or more intensive cessation treatments (e.g., physician's
advice, counseling, nicotine replacement, etc.). These findings
are consistent with the suggestion that smokers are reluctant to
take advantage of assisted forms of treatment when it is offered
(116,117). However, the high preference of self-quitting among
former smokers should not be interpreted as an endorsement for
the effectiveness of a single unassisted cessation attempt. Such
statistics most likely reflect the cumulative effect of multiple
cessation attempts carried out over a period of several years
(118), as well as the substantial economic and social barriers that
reduce access to assisted forms of treatment. Indeed, in a pro-
spective evaluation of more than 5000 would-be self-quitters,
only 4.3% reported continuous abstinence 1 year after their ces-
sation attempt (118).
Smoking Cessation Medications (119)
The understanding that tobacco addiction had a physiologic
basis brought with it the implication that medications could be
used to help people achieve and sustain abstinence. Two medical
disorders are now widely recognized to comprise what is more
generally termed tobacco addiction or dependence (89): 1) nico-
tine dependence and 2) nicotine withdrawal. Nicotine depen-
dence is the disorder of maladaptive and seldom spontaneously
remitting tobacco use. Diagnostic criteria for nicotine depen-
dence include evidence of tolerance (increased use over time and
absence of aversive symptoms), withdrawal (see below), and
persistent desire or unsuccessful effort to reduce intake. Nicotine
withdrawal is the constellation of symptoms that accompany
tobacco abstinence. These symptoms can include dysphoria, in-
somnia, irritability, anxiety, restlessness, increased appetite, and
difficulty concentrating.
Nicotine replacement. Nicotine polacrilex (``gum'') has
been available as a prescription medication since 1985 in the
United States and was approved for over-the-counter (OTC)
marketing in early 1996. Nicotine transdermal systems
(``patches'') have been available by prescription since late 1991,
and two of the four systems were approved for OTC marketing
in 1996. A nicotine nasal spray was approved and marketed as a
prescription medication in mid-1996. In addition, in the spring
of 1997, the FDA approved the nicotine vapor inhaler. All of
these medications are indicated as aids to smoking cessation, and
they reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms, such as difficulty
concentrating, irritability, and cravings. However, all vary some-
what in their instructions for use, side effects, dosage configu-
ration, and the nature and extent of behavioral support programs
provided by the pharmaceutical companies (65,120,121). Clini-
cal studies in the area have concentrated almost exclusively
on evaluating the long-term effectiveness of the nicotine patch and
gum, and results from these studies are briefly summarized be-
low. Further discussion is also provided in the AHCPR (i.e.,
Agency for Health Care Policy and Research) Clinical Practice
Guideline on Smoking Cessation section (see below) and in other
reviews (65,122,123).
Transdermal nicotine has been shown to be an effective form
of treatment that significantly improves cessation rates across
diverse settings and populations. Use of transdermal nicotine
approximately doubles 6- to 12-month cessation rates in relation
to the rate obtained with a comparable placebo. This result holds
true, even when the patch is provided alone or paired with a
low-intensity behavioral intervention. Recent meta-analyses
(124) suggest that absolute cessation rates observed with the
active patch may also be enhanced when it is used in conjunction
with more- versus less-intense psychologic interventions, al-
though the effect has not been uniform (125). Mean cessation
rates reported in the meta-analyses for the active patch plus high-
versus low-intensity psychologic interventions were 41.5%
(95% CI  37.6%­45.4%) versus 22.8% (95% CI  21.0%­
24.7%) at the end of treatment and 26.5% (95% CI  22.6%­
30.6%) versus 19.5% (95% CI  17.2%­22.1%) at 6 months
after the quit date (124).
The gum appears to improve 12-month cessation rates by
40%­60% compared with control interventions. The effect sizes
for gum versus placebo or no gum conditions were higher when
administered with more- versus less-intensive psychologic
therapy. One analysis (126) showed no difference in 1-year ab-
stinence rates for gum versus control conditions when each were
combined with a brief behavioral intervention. Thus, unlike the
patch, the gum may be less effective when only minimal forms
of psychologic intervention are used; however, similar to what
has been observed for the patch, cessation rates are likely to
improve with increasing intensity of adjuvant therapy.
In 1994, a 4-mg dosage form of nicotine gum was approved
for marketing on the basis of findings that it was effective for
heavier smokers, for whom the 2-mg formulation was generally
ineffective (127). Nicotine polacrilex is also the only smoking
cessation medication shown to reduce reliably the weight gain
associated with cessation, but the effect may not persist after
polacrilex use is discontinued (65). Noncompliance with chew-
ing frequency and use duration may reduce the gum's effective-
ness, although compliance improves with concurrent psycho-
logic therapy (123). Moreover, the nicotine patch may be
preferred to the gum, given its ease of use and constant nicotine
dosing.
Negative mood, nicotine replacement, and psychotropic
medication (96). As discussed above, negative mood states have
a significant impact on smoking prevalence and cessation re-
lapse. Amelioration of these conditions in the context of a smok-
ing cessation intervention appears to be an important step in the
treatment process. Some behavioral studies (128,129) indicate
that smokers with high levels of precessation negative mood
may benefit from cognitive-behavioral treatment that focuses
directly on managing the symptoms of negative affect. For those
with a history of major depression, the results of behavioral
intervention alone appear less conclusive. One study (130)
showed a significant benefit for a cognitive-behavioral affect
1858 SPECIAL ARTICLE Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Vol. 89, No. 24, December 17, 1997
management treatment program, while another from the same
laboratory (131) did not.
Studies using both the nicotine patch and the gum also show
that treatment efficacy is reduced among smokers who report
elevated levels of dysphoria immediately before (96,132,133) or
during (111,134) the early phases of treatment. Although cessa-
tion rates can be improved to the extent that either approach
offsets the increase in negative mood associated with quitting
(110,133,134), the relationship may vary by level of pretreat-
ment affect and, possibly, by sex. For example, the addition of
nicotine gum to an extensive program of behavioral counseling
does not appear to enhance the abstinence of smokers with a past
history of MDD (131), although modest treatment gains have
been reported for the combination of gum and brief counseling
among those with current depressive symptoms. Combining
transdermal nicotine replacement with group counseling also
enhances abstinence beyond that achieved by counseling alone
(96,135). Women appear to do equally well with or without the
patch added to the group behavioral intervention for 2­3 months
after all treatment ends. However, no effects on the basis of sex
are observed at the 6-month follow-up (Cinciripini PM, Wetter
DW, Cinciripini LG, Haque W, Van Vunakis H: manuscript
submitted for publication). Nevertheless, this finding is interest-
ing in view of studies that suggest that women may smoke more
often than men for reasons of non-nicotine reinforcement (136)
and have relapsed more in clinical trials of nicotine-replacement
therapy (136) (Wetter DW, Kenford SS, Smith JJ, Fiore MC,
Jorenby DE, Baker TB: manuscript in preparation).
The use of psychotropic medication as a prophylactic treat-
ment for negative affect has also produced favorable effects on
cessation rates in some studies. For example, in a preliminary
report (137), abstinence was improved among smokers who re-
ported at least one symptom of depressive mood and who took
the antidepressant fluoxetine (an SSRI or selective serotonin
re-uptake inhibitor). Early results with another antidepressant,
nortriptyline, showed favorable effects on cessation for smokers
both with and without a positive history of MDD (131). Im-
proved levels of abstinence have also been observed among
smokers with initially elevated levels of anxiety who were
treated with the anxiolytic, buspirone, in conjunction with be-
havioral counseling. The drug seemed to attenuate the expected
precessation rise in anxiety, although the beneficial effects on
abstinence lasted only for the duration of chemotherapy (138). A
subsequent study (139), using considerably less provider sup-
port, found no differences with buspirone. Finally, the FDA
recently approved the antidepressant, buproprion (Zyban, a do-
pamine reuptake inhibitor, Glaxo Wellcome), for use in smoking
cessation treatment. The results of a multicenter clinical trial
show that 1-year quit rates for smokers receiving 150­300 mg/
day of Zyban averaged 23% versus 19% in the placebo group
(140).
Experimental medications for smoking cessation (119). A
variety of non-nicotine medications have also been studied and
are briefly summarized below. These medications include the
following: clonidine, lobeline, and mecamylamine. Clonidine,
an antihypertensive, appears to be useful for some individuals,
but study findings are mixed. Lobeline, which partially mimics
the effects of nicotine, was used in many OTC smoking-
cessation products until 1994 when the FDA removed such
products from the market until they are shown to be effective.
Mecamylamine, an antihypertensive that has been used in re-
search for its nicotine blocking effects (141), enhanced cessation
efforts in a preliminary study when it was co-administered with
a nicotine patch (141). This drug combination will require con-
siderable additional research to determine whether or not it is
generally safe and effective, as well as to determine appropriate
dosing parameters. Cotinine, a nicotine metabolite, has been
evaluated in a preliminary study (143), but it is unclear whether
it will prove to be efficacious for smoking cessation. More de-
tailed reviews can be found in other sources (122,123,144).
Optimal use of approved and investigational medications
would be expected to vary across patients: some may require
higher doses, longer-term use, combinations of dosage forms,
and possibly new dosage forms. Similarly, for people unable or
unwilling to completely abstain from tobacco, experimental use
of nicotine medications to treat withdrawal symptoms and to
reduce their exposure to tobacco might be considered. A par-
ticularly promising application of available medications would
be the combination of gum and patch, which appears to provide
increased relief of withdrawal symptoms and achievement of
cessation (65). Another type of combination therapy could be
termed ``sequential,'' whereby patients use a transdermal medi-
cation to achieve abstinence and then intermittently use nicotine
polacrilex as needed to sustain long-term abstinence (65).
Tobacco-derived nicotine-delivery products (119). To-
bacco companies have patented a wide range of nicotine-
delivering products that are most accurately considered drugs
and/or drug delivery devices, regardless of how they have been
or will be formally regulated (68,145). The most distinct among
such tobacco company products that have actually been mar-
keted include the Premier and the Eclipse devices of the R. J.
Reynolds Tobacco Company (Winston-Salem, NC) and the
Masterpiece Tobaccos chewing gum of the Pinkerton Tobacco
Company (Owensboro, KY) (145,146). It is possible that some
of these products would be lower in their delivery of some types
of tobacco toxins. For example, Premier, and probably Eclipse,
appeared lower in conventional tar but similar in nicotine and
carbon monoxide delivery to a conventional cigarette and pos-
sibly higher in chemical derivatives of pyrolized glycerol.
Whether or not various tobacco-caused diseases might be re-
duced by substitution of such products for conventional tobacco
products is not known. Furthermore, the form and purpose of
these products appears aimed at maintaining, if not increasing,
the prevalence of nicotine dependence, whereas pharmaceutical
products have been designed and marketed as means to reduce
tobacco-caused disease, including nicotine dependence.
Treatment Recommendations: the AHCPR Clinical
Practice Guideline on Smoking Cessation (147)
In April 1996, the AHCPR released a set of guidelines for
practicing clinicians, smoking cessation specialists, and health
care administrators/insurers to deliver and support effective
smoking cessation interventions (123). The guideline panel
evaluated more than 300 randomized controlled studies in a
meta-analysis of several treatment components. The major rec-
ommendations of the panel can be summarized as follows:
Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Vol. 89, No. 24, December 17, 1997 SPECIAL ARTICLE 1859
1) Effective smoking cessation treatments are avail-
able, and every patient who smokes should be of-
fered one or more of these treatments.
2) It is essential that clinicians determine and docu-
ment the tobacco-use status of every patient
treated in a health-care setting.
3) Brief cessation treatments are effective, and at
least a minimal intervention should be provided to
every patient who uses tobacco.
4) A dose­response relationship exists between the
intensity and the duration of treatment and its ef-
fectiveness. In general, the more intense the inter-
vention, the more effective it is in producing long-
term abstinence from tobacco.
5) Three treatment elements, in particular, are effec-
tive, and one or more of these elements should be
included in smoking-cessation treatment:
(a) nicotine-replacement therapy (nicotine patches
or gum);
(b) social support (clinician provided encourage-
ment and assistance); and
(c) skills training/problem solving (techniques on
achieving and maintaining abstinence);
6) Effective reduction of tobacco use requires that
health care systems make institutional changes that
result in systematic identification of, and interven-
tion with, all tobacco users at every visit.
Cessation screening advice and providers. The AHCPR
panel recommended that providers in primary care settings,
which would include cancer screening and detection clinics,
implement a systematic assessment to identify all smokers. Ex-
panding the ``vital signs'' to include documentation of smoking
status for every patient at every visit has been suggested for this
purpose. The 4-A's model of smoking cessation (Ask, Advise,
Assist, and Arrange) was recommended as a strategy to be used
by primary care clinicians (148). The model includes strong
personalized messages to encourage/motivate a quit attempt and
advice/information on preparing to quit and coping with with-
drawal, making a commitment to abstinence, and arranging so-
cial support and follow-up. Referrals to other specialty providers
are encouraged if desired by the smoker. The largest increment
in success was observed after smokers were exposed to provid-
ers from multiple disciplines (e.g., medicine, psychology, and
nursing).
Intervention format: self-help or individual and group
interventions. The guideline panel noted that cessation rates
attributed to different self-help modalities (e.g., books, manuals,
audiotapes, community referral lists, pamphlets, etc.) did not
differ appreciably from each other and that these rates were not
substantially different from the rate obtained with control sub-
jects who received no self-help material. A slight increase in
cessation rates was noted in three studies that provided tele-
phone hotline support for smoker-initiated calls (odds ratio 
1.4; 95% CI  1.1­1.8) and in one study that combined several
types of self-help materials (odds ratio  1.9; 95% CI  1.2­
2.9). The panel recommended that telephone call-in-support be
considered, if feasible, when establishing a self-help interven-
tion program.
In contrast, interventions that offer person-to-person contact
(i.e., group or individual counseling) provide a substantial treat-
ment advantage over self-help material alone. In comparison
with self-help interventions, the more time providers spend (in-
tensity level) with smokers in a treatment session, the higher the
likelihood of cessation. The highest cessation rates were ob-
served for provider counseling sessions lasting longer than 10
minutes, but brief contact lasting 3­10 minutes, and even mini-
mal contact lasting less than 3 minutes, progressively improved
a smoker's chance of successfully quitting over that of control
subjects. In addition, both the duration of treatment and the
number of treatment sessions (length of session) improved the
odds of cessation, even after controlling for treatment intensity.
Significant improvements in cessation were observed for inter-
ventions involving four to seven sessions carried out over an
8-week period or more.
Treatment content. The panel also analyzed the efficacy of
several components of treatment, including aversive (rapid)
smoking; setting a quit day; counseling for diet, motivation, or
exercise; contingency contracting; relaxation; cigarette (brand)
fading; social support; and problem solving/skills training. The
results indicated that only cessation counseling, involving either
general problem solving/skills training (relapse prevention,
stress management, etc.) or supportive care provided by the
clinician within the treatment session, significantly raised ces-
sation rates above the rate obtained for no-contact control sub-
jects.
The problem solving/skills approach to treatment involves
such counseling elements as the recognition of high-risk situa-
tions (e.g., being around other smokers and alcohol consump-
tion), the enhancement of coping skills designed to alter or ame-
liorate relapse risk (e.g., use of distraction and avoidance and
planning for unanticipated events), the countering of negative
mood with stress reduction and reinforcement enhancement
strategies, and the provision of basic information about smoking
and successful quitting (e.g., nature and course of withdrawal,
the addictive aspects of smoking, etc.). The social support com-
ponent refers to provider encouragement to quit (e.g., commu-
nicating confidence in the patient's ability to quit, providing
basic information about withdrawal, and providing opportunities
to discuss cessation difficulties).
Nicotine-replacement therapy. The AHCPR panel also re-
viewed the results of five meta-analyses on the efficacy of the
transdermal nicotine patch and three analyses focusing on nico-
tine gum. It was concluded that all smokers should be encour-
aged to use the nicotine patch or gum for smoking cessation,
except in the presence of special circumstances (i.e., the need for
abstinence from all sources of nicotine). Research in this area is
summarized above in the ``Smoking Cessation Medications''
section.
In conclusion, the AHCPR guidelines provide substantial evi-
dence that dividends in cessation success may be expected with
interventions that use nicotine replacement and with interven-
tions that last relatively longer, involve more clinical contact,
and provide increasing levels of problem solving/skills training
and social support. It is recommended that counseling focus on
problem solving skills and social support and last as many weeks
as feasible given available resources (i.e., the longer the better).

Individually Tailored Self-Help Interventions (149)
Although cessation rates associated with minimal or self-help
interventions may be substantially lower than those obtained
with more extensive clinical treatments, self-help programs have
the potential of reaching large segments of the population at
relatively low cost. It can be argued that a small treatment effect
multiplied across the population can have a substantial public
health impact. Moreover, recent developments in the design and
implementation of new self-help materials (e.g., computer tai-
loring) allow more individual specificity in the treatment mes-
sage than was previously possible using ubiquitous or ``one size
fits all'' treatment materials. Personalizing or tailoring interven-
tion materials might enhance the effectiveness of self-help ap-
proaches by focusing treatment advice on issues most relevant to
the individual.
Tailored or personalized interventions incorporate informa-
tion provided by the subject on certain aspects of their smoking
behavior (i.e., motivation and readiness to quit, barriers to ces-
sation, self-confidence, individual temptations, etc.) into specific
written or counselor-delivered suggestions for behavior change.
Early studies (150­152) in the area suggest that, when used
alone or in conjunction with telephone counseling, personalized
or individually tailored feedback increases cessation rates, al-
though it may chiefly benefit smokers who are low in self-
efficacy or those who are less nicotine dependent. It is important
to note, however, that those who may have little intention to quit
at the onset of treatment (pre-contemplators) also seem to derive
an advantage from staged, matched, personalized feedback
(151,153).
Tailored self-help materials have also been combined with
nicotine-replacement therapy, using nicotine polacrilex gum and
the transdermal nicotine medications. The combination of these
two approaches presents a substantial research and public health
opportunity given the preference of many smokers for minimal
intervention and the documented effectiveness of nicotine re-
placement (see section on AHCPR recommendations). Both the
patch and nicotine gum are now available as OTC medications,
and some pharmaceutical companies (e.g., SmithKline Beecham
and McNeil Pharmaceuticals, Philadelphia, PA) provide self-
help materials to product consumers. Given the widespread dis-
tribution of OTC medications, plus consumer advertising to spur
interest in use of the product, the combination of nicotine-
replacement therapy and tailored self-help materials provided by
the manufacturers could become part of the routine care pro-
vided for smoking cessation. Outcome research using such ap-
proaches is just beginning. For example, a study by Orleans et al.
(154) used a series of tailored letters to supplement the use of
transdermal nicotine replacement in a population of elderly
smokers. Preliminary results from this randomized trial suggest
that the 3-month point prevalence abstinence rate among patch
users receiving the tailored program was 67% in comparison
with an abstinence rate of 32% among patch users receiving
nontailored support. High levels of initial abstinence (44%) have
also been reported (149) among users of the nicotine patch and
the Committed Quitters Personal Support Program (CQ), the
self-help program provided with the Nicoderm prescription
patch (SmithKline Beecham Consumer Healthcare). Participants
in the CQ program were mailed sequential letters, calendars, and
postcard reminders tailored to selected cessation benefits and
barriers that were identified in a baseline interview. They also
received a follow-up telephone call within a day or two of their
quit date and again 5 weeks later. While promising, the results of
this program, as well as of others associated with OTC nicotine-
replacement products, require further evaluation in randomized
clinical trials.
Community Intervention (COMMIT) (155)
The treatment approaches discussed thus far target the be-
havior of individual smokers and measure the success of the
intervention in terms of the abstinence achieved by these smok-
ers at specific points in time. Community interventions, on the
other hand, expose entire communities to a cessation or preven-
tion treatment and measure treatment outcome in terms of dif-
ferences in smoking prevalence between exposed and unexposed
communities. Recently, a combination of community-based in-
terventions to help smokers quit was evaluated in COMMIT,
which was funded by the NCI. COMMIT was a large-scale trial
involving 11 matched pairs of communities in North America
(156) randomly assigned to receive either an active community
intervention or no active intervention (control).
A baseline survey, using random-digit-dialing methods, was
used to estimate the smoking prevalence in each community and
to identify cohorts of heavy (25 cigarettes/day) and light-to-
moderate smokers (<25 cigarettes/day) to be followed. After the
randomization, the COMMIT intervention was implemented in
the intervention communities by use of several existing commu-
nity channels: media and public education, health care providers,
work sites (and community organizations), and cessation re-
sources (156,157). The assumption was that the combination of
approaches would be more effective than the sum of its indi-
vidual component effects. COMMIT would act as a ``catalyst''
for smoking cessation activities in the community.
The primary hypothesis of COMMIT was that the commu-
nity-level, multi-channel, 4-year intervention would increase
quit rates among cigarette smokers (with particular interest in
heavy smokers). ``Quit rate'' was defined as the fraction of
cohort members who had achieved and maintained cessation for
at least 6 months at the end of the trial. End point cohorts
totaling 10 019 heavy smokers and 10 328 light-to-moderate
smokers, 25­64 years of age, were followed by telephone con-
tact (157). The cohort analysis showed that the mean heavy
smoker quit rate was 18% for the intervention communities ver-
sus 18.7% for the comparison communities, a nonsignificant
difference (P  .68). Significant group differences (P  .004)
were observed for corresponding light-to-moderate smoker quit
rates, averaging 30.6% and 27.5% for the intervention and con-
trol communities, respectively. No significant sex differences in
the effect of the intervention were noted. However, among light-
to-moderate smokers, the less-educated subgroup appeared to be
more responsive to the intervention than college-educated smok-
ers. Analysis of the cross-sectional survey data also showed a
nonsignificant difference in the decline in smoking prevalence
between the intervention and the comparison communities, with
declines of 3.5% and 3.2% observed, respectively. There was an
encouraging decrease in smoking prevalence for middle-aged
and older adults, but the youngest group, ages 18­24 years,
unfortunately showed a much smaller change (157,158).
Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Vol. 89, No. 24, December 17, 1997 SPECIAL ARTICLE 1861
The impact of this community-based intervention on light-
to-moderate smokers, although modest, has public health impor-
tance. That this community-based intervention did not affect
heavy smokers or have a substantial impact on smoking preva-
lence beyond favorable secular trends, while disappointing,
points to the need for the prevention of nicotine dependence and
for more extensive treatment of highly nicotine-dependent
smokers. Such treatment approaches may go beyond traditional
educational and minimal levels of intervention and incorporate
the type of provider support, skills-training techniques, and nico-
tine-replacement therapies recommended in the AHCPR guide-
line (123) and may include alternative pharmacologic interven-
tion as well.
Implications for Public Policy
Regulatory Aspects of Prevention: Role of the FDA
(Remarks from former FDA Commissioner David Kessler)
(159)
To reduce the initiation and use of tobacco by young people,
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) launched an investi-
gation to answer two questions: Can nicotine be considered a
drug under the Federal Government's Food, Drug and Cosmetics
Act? If so, what is the appropriate strategy to regulate this drug?
Evidence that nicotine can be considered a drug. The Fed-
eral Government's Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act defines a drug
as ``an article (except for food) intended to affect the structure
and function of the body.'' The scientific literature demonstrates
that nicotine in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco has such an
effect on the body. Since the early 1990s, there has been almost
universal agreement within the scientific and medical commu-
nities that nicotine is an addictive drug.
During its investigation, the FDA discovered that the tobacco
industry also knew about nicotine's addictive properties. In the
early 1980s, Phillip Morris (New York, NY) forced one of its
scientists, Dr. Victor DeNoble, to withdraw a manuscript he had
submitted to the Journal of Psychopharmacology. Dr. DeNoble
had found that rats will self-administer nicotine, one of the hall-
mark properties of an addictive substance, and conducted tests
on nicotine analogues to find a substitute that could duplicate
nicotine's psychoactive and reinforcing effects.
However, to consider nicotine a drug, the FDA also had to
have evidence of intention to produce nicotine's pharmacologic
effects. The FDA uncovered 30 years of industry documents that
describe research by the tobacco industry to understand the phar-
macology of nicotine, including the minimum dose needed to
satisfy smokers. Specifically, the internal documents from
Phillip Morris and Brown & Williamson (Louisville, KY) re-
vealed that both companies conducted research on nicotine phar-
macology and manipulation and acknowledged nicotine's cen-
tral role in sustaining tobacco use. For example, the industry
found it could increase the amount of nicotine in a cigarette by
using high-nicotine tobacco and adding letulic acid to mask the
harsh flavor of high-nicotine tobacco. One company's handbook
on leaf blending and product development also describes how
the industry uses ammonia to ``liberate free nicotine from the
blend, which is associated with increases in impact and satis-
faction reported by smokers.''
Evidence that tobacco is marketed to youth. The second
phase of the FDA investigation examined the way the tobacco
industry markets its products to young people. An internal R. J.
Reynolds (RJR) document reported that ``evidence is now avail-
able to indicate that the 14­18 year old group is an increasing
segment of the smoking population. RJR [team] must soon es-
tablish a successful new brand in this market if our position in
the industry is to be maintained over the long term.'' RJR later
introduced the Joe Camel character. The FDA found that Joe
Camel promotional items played a central role in RJR's YAS
(Young Adult Smokers) program.
Strategy to reduce tobacco use by youth. On the basis of
this evidence, the FDA developed the following two-pronged
strategy to regulate the sale and marketing of tobacco products
to youth:
1) Minimize access by restricting the sale of ciga-
rettes and tobacco to face-to-face transactions and
by banning the distribution of tobacco in vending
machines, mail-order sales, self-service displays,
and free samples.
2) Minimize the impact of tobacco advertisements
that play on the themes of fun, rebellion, glamour,
freedom, and independence--themes with particu-
lar appeal to adolescents.
3) Ban outdoor advertising within 1000 feet of play-
grounds and schools and restrict all other adver-
tising to black and white, text-only format to re-
duce imagery that appeals to youth.
4) Eliminate brand name promotions on nontobacco
items (e.g., hats and t-shirts).
5) Limit the sponsorship of sporting and cultural
events by tobacco companies to the use of the
corporate name, not the brand name.
National Strategies to Combat Tobacco Use and Addiction
(Remarks from former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop)
(160)
Nicotine regulation will play a major role on the part of
government, the health care community, and society at large in
the near future. As described above, the demand that the Food
and Drug Administration be involved in regulating nicotine has
been intensified because of the recently publicized reports that
cigarette companies manipulate nicotine levels to ensure a nico-
tine level sufficient to create and sustain addiction. But, winning
the war against the tobacco industry and against nicotine addic-
tion will require more than a regulation of nicotine. It will re-
quire a variety of strategies aimed at reducing the demand for
smoking by:
· Changing public attitudes about tobacco, the to-
bacco industry, and tobacco addiction.
· Despoiling the myth of the economic necessity of
tobacco and impressing on the public the hypocrisy
of allowing tobacco companies to export tobacco
while the U.S. takes actions against other countries
that import cocaine to our country;
· Broadening the legal attack on the tobacco indus-
tries and their advertising practices, especially those
directed to youth; and
1862 SPECIAL ARTICLE Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Vol. 89, No. 24, December 17, 1997
· Taking a more active role in prevention in the
healthcare arena.
Changing public attitudes. More action can be taken in this
regard to improve the dialog between smokers and nonsmokers
and encourage third-party payers to support smoking-cessation
programs. Many insurance companies still will not pay a mere
$50 to help a patient participate in a smoking-cessation program,
although they willingly pay huge sums for medical care related
to smoking-induced illness. Thoughtful and effective ways to
deal with the issue of nicotine addiction are needed.
Despoiling the myth of tobacco economics. Clear, long-
range strategies to deal with the economic myths and realities of
tobacco are also needed. Despite the argument that tobacco re-
strictions would have a negative effect on the American
economy, a number of studies have shown that this is not the
case. Moreover, the right of a few individuals to profit from a
product that kills many of their fellow citizens every year is
questionable. Clearly, tobacco is costing the individual tobacco
producing states and country more than it profits either one.
Broadening the legal attack on the tobacco industry and
tobacco advertising. Although the recent, large, class-action
suit (Costanzo) met a discouraging setback, State suits aimed at
recovering Medicaid expenditures on smoking-related disease
may eventually prevail (see Authors' note below). It may yet be
possible to win a successful liability lawsuit against a tobacco
company.
Focusing physicians on tobacco-addiction prevention. Fi-
nally, American physicians need to be encouraged to be more
effective in their intervention with both their nonsmoking and
their smoking patients. Doctors need to take advantage of every
professional encounter with a patient to intervene against smok-
ing in that patient's life or in the life of a family member.
Author's Note
Before publication of this article, negotiations between State
Attorneys General and tobacco companies resulted in a pending
legislative proposal for Congressional consideration. Included in
this complex settlement are provisions to restrict the advertising
and sales of tobacco, to restrict smoking in public places, to penal-
ize tobacco companies if youth smoking rates are not reduced, and
to require stronger warning labels on tobacco products. Tobacco
companies have also agreed to provide funds for medical research,
smoking-cessation programs, public education about tobacco, and
enforcement of the settlement provisions. The medical research
funds alone would total $25 billion over 8 years.
Drs. C. Everett Koop and David Kessler chaired a committee
of public health experts convened to advise the Congress about
the settlement. Their committee recommended many modifica-
tions and additions to the settlement. In particular, they recom-
mended that the FDA retain the ability to regulate the nicotine
content of cigarettes and that the penalties be increased for to-
bacco companies if youth smoking rates do not fall. The com-
mittee proposed even larger budgets for the public health and
research programs in the settlement. They also suggested provi-
sions to help tobacco farmers convert to other crops and to reduce
tobacco use in other nations. Currently, the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services is conducting a complete review of the
settlement to make recommendations to the President.
