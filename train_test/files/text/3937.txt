Introduction
Consumer behavior has always been an area of major interest
for social science researchers, witnessing an explosion over
the past 50 years (MacInnis & Folkes, 2010). Accordingly,
literature on this topic has been the center of attention in a
number of previous studies (Arndt, 1986; Battalio et al.,
1974; Belk et al., 2012; Hameed, Waqas, Aslam, Bilal, &
Umair, 2014; Hawkins & Mothersbaugh, 2009; Howard &
Sheth, 1968; Robertson & Kassarjian, 1991; Solomon,
2013). Literature on consumer behavior is diverse and exten-
sive as changes in society, economics, and technology affect
the way consumers behave.
Inevitably, these changes lead to changed consumer
behavior studies by which, when, how, and why the topics
are studied. Like any other discipline, systematic analysis of
the knowledge development status of consumer behavior
field is critical in ensuring its future growth (Williams &
Plouffe, 2007). It is of a greater importance for a field of
research such as consumer behavior that, as MacInnis and
Folkes (2010) claimed, is thriving by the growing number of
articles and topics examined. One way of conducting this
systematic analysis is through studying scholarly literature,
which can illustrate a discipline's intellectual history
(Pasadeos, Phelps, & Kim, 1998). In this regard, to assess a
discipline's accrued knowledge, in-depth reviews of research
published in peer-reviewed journals are the most relevant
and useful resources (Üsdiken & Pasadeos, 1995; Williams
& Plouffe, 2007). The importance of consumer behavior in
the different disciplines of business literature also suggests
the need for an up-to-date look at the literature in this field.
Beyond helping consumer behavior scholars and practitio-
ners develop a better understanding of the direction in which
the field is progressing and identify the gaps, such studies
will provide a guideline for them in positioning their future
research and marketing efforts.
In this regard, a technique such content analysis, which
can be used to analyze message content and handling, is ideal
for conducting such literature review studies. As an observa-
tional research method, content analysis systematically eval-
uates the symbolic content of all forms of recorded
communications (Sattari, 2012). It can be considered as an
empirical starting point generating new research evidence
about the nature and effect of specific communications
(Kolbe & Burnett, 1991; Vallet-Bellmunt, Martínez-
Fernández, & Capó-Vicedo, 2011). Content analysis not only
helps identify central issues to the field but can also help to
reveal areas where more work needs to be undertaken, par-
ticularly if these are considered to be important and defining
issues in the discipline (Cokley, Caldwell, Miller, &
Muhammad, 2001). Such integrative review of consumer

Abstract
This article analyzes 12 years of recent scholarly research on consumer behavior published in the five leading international
journals in this field. Analyzing academic contributions to a specific area of research provides valuable insights into how it has
evolved over a defined period. The approach was to briefly discuss content analysis and its application in scholarly literature
review studies. The methodology used here involves the classification of topics to evaluate key trends in consumer behavior
literature. It includes a ranking of topics published, typology of the published articles, the research classification in terms of
methodologies, and analysis techniques. The most cited articles in the field and within each journal are also examined. The
comprehensive literature review of consumer behavior research undertaken in this article could advance the discipline of
consumer behavior research by elucidating the evolution of consumer behavior literature in the studied period.

behavior research as a diverse discipline with an overwhelm-
ing scope in peer-reviewed journals is necessary if the field
is to progress in a systematic fashion. Moreover, although
content analysis of journals can be time-consuming and data
intensive, such studies provide direction into future areas of
needed inquiry in the field by offering insight about the topi-
cal, methodological, and theoretical trends into research
communities (Williams & Plouffe, 2007).
According to Buboltz, Miller, and Williams (1999), an
examination of articles published in a journal reveals the trends
and issues that impact the discipline.Acontent analysis of jour-
nal articles within a specific discipline allows for an examina-
tion of the kinds of topics that are deemed important to the
particular field the journal represents (Cokley et al., 2001). In
consumer studies, marketing research, and other business dis-
ciplines, literature investigations can also provide insights into
the specific journals' contributions to the field as well as the
specific published works (Sattari, 2012). This, in turn, can be
used to describe a discipline's intellectual history (Pasadeos
et al., 1998). A comprehensive content analysis of peer-
reviewed journal publications in a field encourages the scholars
to assess the entire "forest" of knowledge by taking a step back
from their individual "trees" (Williams & Plouffe, 2007).
Such studies have been conducted within a variety of disci-
plines based on publications in the most respected journals.
Two examples are the Pasadeos et al. (1998) and West (2007)
studies reporting on the impact of advertising on researchers
during different periods of time. Buboltz et al. (1999) and
Cokley et al. (2001) have contributed similar studies in psy-
chology. Others have targeted the consumer behavior field such
as the studies done by Kassarjian (1977) and Helgeson, Kluge,
Mager, and Taylor (1984), but there is no current review of the
field. Therefore, given the importance of consumer behavior
research, a comprehensive literature study of more recent con-
tributions to this area of research is warranted.
In this regard, this article serves to assess the structure and
evolution of consumer behavior research content in business
disciplines. The purpose of this literature review is to system-
atically review consumer behavior research over a 12-year
period in five major journals in the field. Such an examination
of diverse research in this discipline allows for identification of
shifts and changes in a longitudinal manner. This article pres-
ents the results of a comprehensive content analysis covering
12 years of research in the domain of consumer behavior. Our
review, which evaluated more than 1,000 articles published
across five key journals, provides a descriptive snapshot of the
status of consumer behavior research including the most domi-
nant topics based on Helgeson et al.'s (1984) framework and
methodological and analytical approaches, in addition to cita-
tion statistics of the reviewed consumer behavior articles.
Method
To examine the content of consumer behavior literature,
trace its evolution, and identify the main streams of research
over time, a content analysis was first performed on the arti-
cles focusing on consumer behavior. Helgeson et al. (1984)
classified 32 years of consumer behavior literature from
selected journals and proceedings. As there did not seem to
be a comprehensive review and classification of consumer
behavior topics in the literature, they tried to rectify the situ-
ation by examining the evolution of consumer behavior lit-
erature as a topic between 1950 and 1981. No similar research
has been carried out since 1981, so this study replicates
Helgeson et al.'s work based on the framework proposed by
Berthon, Pitt, Ewing, and Carr (2002) by extending its con-
text to the period 1998-2009.
The purpose of this article is, therefore, to cover 12 years
(1998-2009) of literature to investigate consumer behavior
growth as a research topic in the literature. Like Helgeson
et al. (1984), our objective is not to evaluate the results of the
research but to categorize and evaluate trends as found in the
following publications: (a) Journal of Consumer Research
(JCR), (b) Journal of Marketing (JM), (c) Journal of
Marketing Research (JMR), (d) Journal of Advertising (JA),
and (e) Journal of Advertising Research (JAR).
The choice of these five journals is straightforward as
they have held positions as the top consumer behavior jour-
nals and business journals for decades. Evidence of this
comes from many sources, such as the ABS' (Chartered
Association of Business Schools) Academic Journal Quality
Guide Studies evaluating these journals at the top level of
business journals.
Evidence is also available from the Web of Science Internet
library source and Thomson Reuters journal citation reports,
both measuring the influence of publications based on impact
factors (defined as the frequency with which articles from a
journal have been cited). The last journal citation report from
Web of Science (2014) shows that JCR (5-year impact factor
of 5), JM (5-year impact factor of 7.42), JMR (5-year impact
factor of 3.77), JA (5-year impact factor of 1.73), and JAR
(5-year impact factor of 2.54) have consistently been posi-
tioned as top influential business journals (Journal Citation
Reports, 2014). Moreover, the idea behind choosing these
journals was to cover various disciplines among business stud-
ies such as marketing, advertising, and consumer research.
Choosing these five journals also helped to evaluate articles
published by different publishers, namely, the American
Marketing Association (AMA), Oxford University Press,
Taylor & Francis, and World Advertising Research Center.
Moreover, as claimed by Furrer, Thomas, and
Goussevskaia (2008), established influential journals, such
as the ones chosen in this study, set the bar for studies within
their frame of reference by forming the theoretical and
empirical work in their discipline.
However, it must be said that notable contributions to
consumer behavior research have come from other sources,
particularly books and monographs, which we did not exam-
ine. In total, 2,915 articles published in the five journals dur-
ing the period under study were included in our review.
Peighambari et al. 3
The first decision made by each reviewer was whether the
article dealt with consumer behavior. Hence, in the initial phase
of this research, the authors manually reviewed every issue of
the five examined journals to identify articles for inclusion in
the analysis. First each article's title, abstract, and keywords
were evaluated, and if they included consumer behavior (or
behaviour), then the article would be on the list for further anal-
ysis. In many cases, this criterion was not met so the full article
was inspected and skimmed through to determine whether that
the article was related to consumer behavior.Avery small num-
ber of publication entries, such as editorials, points of view,
abstracts, and book reviews, were excluded from the analysis.
In total, this identification phase yielded a sample of 1,263 con-
sumer behavior articles (Table 1).
The second phase of the study involved systematically
categorizing the major aspects of each chosen article. Both
deductive and inductive procedures were conducted to deter-
mine the categories used in the content analysis of the arti-
cles.The initial inclusion of content topics relied on deductive
procedures, meaning that the reviewed consumer behavior
articles were classified into 37 topics, which were divided
into four major areas, Internal, Purchase Process, External,
and Miscellaneous (Table 1), as previously determined by
Helgeson et al. (1984). This categorization can be explained
through Wright's (2006) perspective in that the variety of
human internal factors, external environment, and problem-
solving processes should be identified when trying to under-
stand consumer behavior. Accordingly, the Internal category
covers topics associated with consumers'individual and psy-
chological factors, whereas the topics categorized under
External involve situational and social factors.
To ensure consistent classification of multitopic articles,
in cases where an article could be classified under more than
one topic, the authors discussed the article and obtained a
consensus about the closest topic, which the article covered.
Then, each article was classified based on its research typol-
ogy as being either qualitative, quantitative, or both. In the
next step, by using Google Scholar, the number of citations
for each selected article was gathered.
Articles were further categorized according to research
methodology. Helgeson et al. (1984) used a group of four
methods: Survey, Experiment, Discussion, and Other.
Inductive procedures were used to develop additional catego-
ries for the articles' methodologies and analysis techniques.
This was done by each author independently reviewing the
contents of articles they were assigned and then meeting and

discussing their overall impressions of the types of articles
published in the journal. The inductive procedures resulted in
adding a new separate category to the research methods (case
study) and one to the analysis techniques (structural equation
modeling [SEM]).
Analysis and Results
The number of consumer behavior articles during the studied
time period ranged from 66 per year in 1998 to 156 per year
in 2009 (Table 1). These numbers as a percentage of total
articles appearing in the literature in the five selected jour-
nals are illustrated in Figure 1.
At least three characteristic life-cycle patterns seemed to
emerge, when plotting the percentage of consumer behavior
articles devoted to each of four major areas over time (Figure
2). The first pattern is exemplified by External area, which,
despite its consistent appearance in the literature, showed a
decline in the number of articles compared with the other
three areas. This pattern for External topics is negatively
skewed with periodic peaks through time.Asecond pattern is
exhibited by Internal topics, which are still in a growth stage
showing a gradually increasing interest in the literature. The
skewness for pattern is positive without any significant peri-
odic peaks through time. The Purchase Process area revealed
a third pattern, which is also positively skewed but with
some periodic and major peaks through time. Despite a
decline in the height of these peaks over time, the Purchase
Process topics remain an important part of the literature, and
this trend is growing.
Table 2 exemplifies the frequency and percentage of arti-
cles that each of the main area of topics covered compared
with the reviewed articles in consumer behavior fields in the
reviewed journals.
As mentioned above, 37 major topics in consumer behav-
ior were selected in categorizing articles, which were then
grouped into four major areas. Using these categories, Table
3 shows the percentage of occurrence of each topic within
the reviewed consumer behavior articles.
According to the findings, the most studied topic within
consumer behavior articles in the five journals was
Perception, which was covered in 12% of the articles. Only
slightly less common, Attitudes came next (11.5%), while
the third topic, at almost half the size of the preceding two,
with 6.2%, was Brand awareness/loyalty.
In Table 3, bold fonts highlight the most studied topic in
each major area. As discussed earlier, the present study clas-
sified articles based on their research typology, methodol-
ogy, and the data analysis techniques used. Findings revealed
that a large number of the reviewed consumer behavior arti-
cles were classified as quantitative studies (76%), as shown
in Table 4. To dig deeper into this matter, we also evaluated
the relationship between the types of studies (qualitative and
quantitative) with respect to the four topic categories as
shown in Table 5.
Moreover, according to the research methodology, experi-
ments and surveys were the most common instruments for
conducting consumer behavior research. This can be
described as the nature of consumer behavior as related to
studying and observing consumers. The articles were also

classified by using one of the previously mentioned 10 ana-
lytical techniques. Table 6 presents the frequency and per-
centage of each research methodology and the analysis
techniques used in the reviewed articles.
Moreover, Table 7 shows the trends regarding analytical
techniques used during the 12 years studied as the percentage
of all consumer behavior articles in each year.
In comparison with the study done by Helgeson et al. in
1984, there has been tremendous growth in the use of com-
plex statistical techniques such as SEM. This may be due to
the fact that these techniques involve advanced computer
software and packages that did not exist in 1984. It may
also be the result of an increase in the number of consumer
behavior articles that conducted scientific hypothesis test-
ing generated from a theory base. The complexity of the
articles written has also witnessed an increase due to grow-
ing emphasis on theoretical foundations and multivariate
statistics, linked to advances in computer manipulation of
data. Thus, to comprehend the more recent consumer
behavior articles, readers are required to have a greater
knowledge of the theoretical roots of articles and more
statistical sophistication than had been necessary for earlier
articles.
Another consequence of the data analysis concerns arti-
cles that have been cited the most often in consumer behav-
ior literature. Table 8 shows the 15 most cited articles in all
journals, whereas Table 9 illustrates the three most influen-
tial articles from each journal.
Conclusion
The results presented in this article suggest many impli-
cations for the consumer behavior research community,
researchers, journal editors, and reviewers, as well as for
the practitioners. In this regard, this article not only
serves to evaluate the structure and evolution of the lit-
erature in consumer behavior field but also presents some
assumptions about further developments in this
literature.
By helping consumer behavior scholars to better under-
stand the direction in which the field is going, the article is
intended to provide a guideline for scholars in positioning
their future research efforts. The results of this article pro-
vide consumer behavior researchers with a concrete perspec-
tive on what has been published on the subject area by
indicating hot topics, research methods, and analysis tech-
niques. The findings of this study highlight the most impor-
tant consumer behavior topics and the most influential
articles in the field based on citation frequency. The number
of topics studied in consumer behavior showed a dramatic
growth and revealed some general patterns during the 12
years studied in this article.

According to the results, authors aiming to have an article
published in a journal will have a better understanding of the
different trends consumer behavior research has had during the
studied period. Moreover, potential authors, researchers, and
interested readers may use the information presented as a
means to assess the field.
The findings of this research also provide journal editors
and reviewers with a wider (global, in a sense) perspective
regarding the publication trends and themes on consumer
behavior research topics, methods, and statistical analysis.
Practitioners can use this study to indicate which journals
to consult as sources of information on specific topics. The
analysis of the topic areas among the reviewed articles pro-
vides evidence that certain topic areas (Purchase Process and
Internal) enjoyed consistent popularity among the chosen
journals' editors and reviewers during the studied years,

while the interest in topics related to external aspects of con-
sumer behavior has decreased among the five journals. This
is in line with the ever-changing environment of consumers'
decision making and the move from profit-focused perspec-
tive of companies to a relationship-focused one to increase
loyalty. This seems to be in line with the evolution of con-
sumers' preferences too, meaning that scholarly work in
these journals has recognized this change and has begun to
investigate these changes in consumer behavior.
Limitations and Avenues for Future Research
While the content analysis conducted in this study provides
useful information to consumer behavior researchers and
practitioners, several limitations of the study must be indi-
cated. First, the five journals analyzed here do not represent
the entire body of consumer behavior research. In this regard,
future studies could select a larger number of journals, as
well as conference proceedings and books from various

disciplines. Furthermore, this article reviewed consumer
behavior studies published in a specific period. Extending
this time frame would, of course, strengthen the results and
their generalizability.
Moreover, as Yale and Gilly (1988) argued, any content
analysis may, to some extent, have a learning bias, meaning
that when the judges (in our case the authors of the article)
review more articles, they become more skillful and intui-
tive, which may result in a different manner of inspection for
the articles evaluated earlier versus the ones assessed later in
the process. As the reviews of the articles done in this study
are based on the judgments of its authors, further research
may come up with new and slightly different results.
Therefore, a more systematic and transparent coding scheme
is recommended for future study.
Future studies of the consumer behavior research litera-
ture can also investigate authorship of the articles, including
which authors have had what impact on the discipline and
which scholars from which institutions have been productive
in terms of consumer behavior publications. Finally, future
research can investigate and categorize the results and the
implications of articles in each topic, as well as the theories
that have been used or applied in those studies.
