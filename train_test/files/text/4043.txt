Organizations are made of interacting layers. That is, between
layers (such as divisions, departments, teams, and individu-
als) there is often some degree of interdependence that leads
to bottom-up and top-down influence mechanisms. Teams
and organizations are contexts for the development of indi-
vidual cognitions, attitudes, and behaviors (top-down effects;
Kozlowski & Klein, 2000). Conversely, individual cogni-
tions, attitudes, and behaviors can also influence the func-
tioning and outcomes of teams and organizations (bottom-up
effects; Arrow, McGrath, & Berdahl, 2000). One example is
when the rewards system of one organization may influence
employees' intention to quit and the existence or absence of
extra role behaviors. At the same time, many studies have
showed the importance of bottom-up emergent processes
that yield higher level phenomena (Bashshur, Hernández, &
González-Romá, 2011; Katz-Navon & Erez, 2005; Marques-
Quinteiro, Curral, Passos, & Lewis, in press). For example,
the affectivity of individual employees may influence their
team's interactions and outcomes (Costa, Passos, & Bakker,
2012). Several authors agree that organizations must be
understood as multilevel systems, meaning that adopting a
multilevel perspective is fundamental to understand real-
world phenomena (Kozlowski & Klein, 2000). However,
whether this agreement is reflected in practicing multilevel
research seems to be less clear. In fact, how much is known
about the quantity and quality of multilevel research done in
the last decade? The aim of this study is to compare what has
been proposed theoretically, concerning the importance of
multilevel research, with what has really been empirically
studied and published. First, this article outlines a review of
the multilevel theory, followed by what has been theoreti-
cally "put forward" by researchers. Second, this article pres-
ents what has really been "practiced" based on the results of
a review of multilevel studies published from 2001 to 2011
in business and management journals. Finally, some barriers
and challenges to true multilevel research are suggested.
This study contributes to multilevel research as it describes
the last 10 years of research. It quantitatively depicts the type
of articles being written, and where we can find the majority
of the publications on empirical and conceptual work related
to multilevel thinking.

Abstract
During the last 30 years, significant debate has taken place regarding multilevel research. However, the extent to which
multilevel research is overtly practiced remains to be examined. This article analyzes 10 years of organizational research
within a multilevel framework (from 2001 to 2011). The goals of this article are (a) to understand what has been done,
during this decade, in the field of organizational multilevel research and (b) to suggest new arenas of research for the next
decade. A total of 132 articles were selected for analysis through ISI Web of Knowledge. Through a broad-based literature
review, results suggest that there is equilibrium between the amount of empirical and conceptual papers regarding multilevel
research, with most studies addressing the cross-level dynamics between teams and individuals. In addition, this study also
found that the time still has little presence in organizational multilevel research. Implications, limitations, and future directions
are addressed in the end.

Multilevel Research: Aligned Theory,
Measurement, and Analysis
Rousseau (1985) and Mathieu and Chen (2011) highlighted
three fundamental aspects to multilevel research that must be
aligned, to avoid level-related confusions or errors: the level
of theory, the level of measurement, and the level of
analysis.
Level of theory refers to the focal level: the entity about
which the researcher draws conclusions (individuals, sub-
units, firms, etc.) and to which generalizations they are
designed to apply. Although it apparently seems easy, estab-
lishing the boundaries dividing one entity from another
(what defines a team, when its members belong to more than
one team, for example), and defining when one moves from
one level of analysis to another (from teams to organiza-
tions, as an example) must be done quite carefully. The same
considerations should be applied when examining mixed
teams, or individuals who belong to different projects in dis-
tinct organizations, as it makes it difficult to understand
their membership and their contribution to higher levels.
Another important aspect at this level is to actually explicit
the multilevel theory, which means to outline how phenom-
ena at different levels are linked. These links may be top-
down or bottom-up. Top-down mechanisms express the
influence of higher level contextual factors on lower levels
of the organization. For example, the culture of an organiza-
tion influences the more or less formal patterns of interaction
between individuals. Bottom-up mechanisms explain how
lower level dynamics shape the emergence of higher level
phenomena, which are unique, and cannot be reduced to their
lower level elements (Dansereau, Alutto, & Yammerino,
1984). In fact, there are team processes that necessarily
imply the interaction and coordination between team mem-
bers and cannot be reduced to their individual perceptions.
One example is team reflexivity, which has demonstrated to
yield team effectiveness (Graça & Passos, 2012; Schippers,
Den Hartog, Koopman, & Van Knippenberg, 2008).
Conceptually, these two mechanisms are both equally impor-
tant. However, empirical research has focused more on
downward (contextual) processes rather than upward (emer-
gent) processes, suggesting that the larger context is more
likely to influence lower level variables than the opposite.
Nonetheless, some researchers have highlighted the impor-
tance of upward influences and claimed that empirical stud-
ies should also emphasize them (Chen, Kanfer, DeShon,
Mathieu, & Kozlowski, 2009; Morgeson & Hofmann,
1999). This trend finds support in other research areas such
as social networks and complex adaptive systems because
these offer methodological tools to observe and analyze
bottom-up effects in social structures. One example is a
recent study on the dynamics of financial stability showing
that market crashes can only be avoided when banks accept
the loss of gains and behave in a resilient way. That is to say
that when banks decide to lower their risk, the financial
network will grow and the probability of a financial crisis
increases (Cruz & Lind, 2011).
The level of measurement refers to the entities from
which data are drawn and should reflect the theory level.
The level of theory and the level of measurement should
therefore be aligned to avoid possible misunderstandings
and erroneous conclusions. When studying organizational
climate, one must gather data at the organizational level
whereas addressing individual-level motivation, research-
ers should gather data from individuals. In an area of
research where individuals are often the main sources of
information, researchers must justify why the process
of data collection used is suitable for their particular
research purposes. When the level of measurement is lower
than the level of analysis, it is crucial to have a good justi-
fication for aggregating the data preceded by a theoretical
rationale that explains how the higher level phenomenon
comes into existence. Chan (1998) proposed a typology of
composition models (see Table 1) that may guide research-
ers when working on theory building, data gathering, and
the measurement instruments used. This typology, like
others (Chen, Mathieu, & Bliese, 2004, for example),
requires that researchers "have a theory about how data
collected at one level of analysis should be combined to
represent constructs at a higher level of analysis" (Mathieu
& Chen, 2011, p. 617). It encompasses five models that
describe how lower level data may be aggregated to repre-
sent higher level phenomena or constructs.
Adding to Chan's (1998) composition models, Kozlowski
and Klein (2000) suggested another form of emergence,
which they named "compilation models." On one hand,
composition models reflect an equal contribution of each
lower level entity to the higher level. For example, an orga-
nization's service climate is theoretically a reflection of the
members of the organizations' shared perceptions of the
extent to which organizational policies reward and encour-
age customer service (Schneider & Bowen, 1985). On the
other hand, compilation models suggest that higher level
phenomena may be more complex combinations of lower
level contributions. Team performance, for example, is a
complex function of specific individual contributions that
are not the same from individual to individual: Some indi-
viduals may contribute more to team performance than oth-
ers.Although this form of emergence (compilation) underlies
many concepts, it is not widely recognized by researchers
(Kozlowski & Klein, 2000).
Finally, theory and measurement levels should also be
aligned with the level of analysis, that is, the level at which
data are analyzed to test hypotheses. Statistically, several
measures have been created to assess within-group agree-
ment and justify data aggregation to the higher level, such
as the within-group agreement index (R
wg(j)
; James,
Demaree & Wolf, 1984, 1993), the intraclass correlation
coefficient (ICC; Bliese, 2000), and the average dispersion
index (ADI; Burke & Dunlap, 2002). However, the level of
Lopes Costa et al. 3
analysis goes beyond aggregation issues. In the 1980s, sev-
eral techniques and methods for analyzing multilevel data
emerged, such asANCOVA(Mossholder & Bedeian, 1983);
contextual analysis (Firebaugh, 1979); WABA (Within and
Between Analysis; Dansereau et al., 1984); CLOP (cross-
level operator; James, Demaree, & Hater, 1980); random-
coefficient modeling (RCM) with HLM (hierarchical linear
modeling; Burstein, Linn, & Capell, 1978); and there have
been other more recent advances, such as the development
of the Nonlinear and Linear Mixed Effects program for
S-PLUS and R programs (Pinheiro & Bates, 2000).
Moreover, Albright and Marinova (2010) have recently
presented a brief review on how to estimate multilevel
models using SPSS, Stata, SAS, and R, thus making impor-
tant contributions to the advances of multilevel research.
Mplus has also proved to be a valuable tool for analyzing
multilevel data (Muthén & Asparouhov, 2011), especially
for longitudinal designs. According to Kozlowski and Klein
(2000), there is no single "best" technique. Researchers
should base their choices on the "consistency between the
type of constructs, the sampling and the data, and the
research question; and on the assumptions, strengths, and
limitations of the analytic technique" (Kozlowski & Klein,
2000, p. 51). There has been an evolution in the theory of
multilevel, as well as interesting developments in the statis-
tical procedures and software available. Nonetheless, how
do researchers integrate these developments in their
research? How are multilevel theory and practice reflected
in recent peer-reviewed publications?
Multilevel Thinking in Theory and Research
Multilevel research has long caught researchers' attention, at
least in a theoretical sense. Recently, Rousseau (2011) sum-
marized some developments that have occurred for micro-
and macrobridging, and highlighted that multilevel research
is being (successfully) done. Rousseau structured her argu-
mentation by presenting some evidence. First, the existence
of an organizational mode of thinking, introduced as a natu-
ral feature of organizational researchers and as a distinctive
competence of organizational science. Due to its inherent
interdisciplinary aspects (e.g., psychology, sociology, and
economics), organizational science fosters a multilevel per-
spective. Other evidence is the use of multilevel or cross-
level heuristics by researchers, like the rule of thumb of
always considering one level up and one level below the
focal construct the researcher is studying, and partitioning
variance. Third, the development of multilevel concepts, like
"emergence" or "embeddedness," guides researchers in their
multilevel theory and research. Also, the use of cross-level
interventions is another evidence that proves that multilevel
thinking is "inherent in the working lives of many organiza-
tional scientists" (Rousseau, 2011, p. 1). In a study by Hitt,
Beamish, Jackson, and Mathieu (2007), the multilevel per-
spective was identified in approximately 25% of the articles
published in the Academy of Management Journal and in
50% in the case of the Academy of Management Review, in a
12-month period. Thus, it appears that multilevel research is
being done and developed.

Dispersion Within-group variance as
operationalization of the

The researcher may propose the construct of climate strength: the
degree of within-group consensus of climate perceptions and index the
construct with a dispersion measure. This can only be achieved when
there are no substantive subgroups within the group that can affect the
analysis.
Process The analogue for parameters
at the higher level and at
the lower level.
The researcher is examining safety climate and wants to describe the
process by which the organization moves from a lack of within-group
agreement of individual-level climate perceptions to high within-group
agreement: the researcher wants to compose an organizational-level
process of organizational safety climate emergence. This is preceded
by a dispersion composition. The process technique consists in finding
the right parameters to pass to higher levels, yet there is no empirical
algorithm to do this.

In addition to Rousseau's contribution, we would like to
emphasize that there is further proof that shows the rele-
vance and interest concerning multilevel thinking. Many
researchers are conscious of the importance and practical
appliance of multilevel thinking. The sharing that stems
from multidisciplinary teams embedded in research depart-
ments and the discussion of knowledge that each team
member can offer about distinctive and specific areas of
expertise may lead to an effective multilevel thinking and
to an integrative organizational science. In addition,
increasingly more people combine different areas in their
curricula. For instance, they have a degree in a specific area
(e.g., psychology), and do their PhD and their research or
work in another area (e.g., management). Thus, these peo-
ple are likely to have more knowledge and broader skills to
think, to analyze, and to understand organizational phe-
nomena at different levels and from different perspectives.
Moreover, in spite of acting and promoting change in only
one area, they have the skills needed to act and promote
change in different ones. More evidence of multilevel
thinking and research is the development of multilevel
research methods and statistical procedures, such as the
ones mentioned above. These developments have led many
universities to provide summer schools dedicated to multi-
level statistical procedures. This shows that universities
have made the more advanced organizational research
methods available to students to allow them to develop
their ability to analyze and to make interventions within a
hierarchical system of organizations, groups, and individu-
als (for instance, Multilevel Modeling with R for Beginners
at INGRoup Conference, 2012). What is more, several
books on the importance and practice of multilevel have
been published in the last decade (Klein & Kozlowski,
2000, for a reference). There are also articles and journal
issues specifically dedicated to multilevel (Journal of
Management--Special issue: Bridging micro and macrodo-
mains, as an example). These publications discuss the
recent advances in multilevel theory and research, and rep-
resent the effort of the experts (on management, human
resources, social capital, workplace demography, etc.) to
comprehend multilevel issues. Ultimately, their work
encourages and stimulates researchers to make their contri-
butions, thus multilevel progresses more and more.
Finally, the theoretical and methodological advances that
have been mentioned so far allow us to say that the current
reflections about research contexts (i.e., micro, macro), and
change (i.e., time), as key variables to understand a whole
system, express researchers' concern to embrace this
approach. This means that because time is present in all con-
texts--for some authors time is a component or a dimension
of context (Johns, 2006; Porter & McLaughlin, 2006)--and
the functioning of teams and organizations is dynamic, it is
essential to consider time to understand the micro and mac-
rocontexts. Even with all the considerations and advances
concerning multilevel thinking, Kozlowski and Klein (2000),
assumed that the influence of multilevel was "merely meta-
phorical" (p. 1). After 12 years, multilevel is widely known
and valued by organizational researchers, but can we say that
it is no longer a metaphor? Are the core problems of organi-
zational dynamics really explained according to the multi-
level research as has been done? To what extent did multilevel
research add something to the understanding of these prob-
lems? Moreover, to what extent did multilevel research
changed the management practices in organizations? At last,
is there any further potential for developing multilevel think-
ing in research and practice?
Some Barriers to Multilevel Thinking
One of the foundations of multilevel thinking was the idea
that micro phenomena are embedded in macrocontexts and
that macrophenomena can emerge due to the interaction and
dynamics of lower level elements (Kozlowski & Klein,
2000). Yet, organizational researchers are likely to highlight
either a micro- or a macroperspective. Although an organi-
zation is an integrative system, organizational science has
been having difficulties in integrating theories that explain
phenomena at the individual and group level of analysis
(e.g., goal-setting theory) with theories that explain phe-
nomena at the organizational level of analysis (such as the
resource-based view of the firm). Roberts, Hulin, and
Rousseau (1978), referred to the need for an integrative
effort of different disciplines in organizational science. The
multilevel paradigm was born when a meso approach high-
lighted the fact that any phenomenon of interest was influ-
enced by factors situated above and below that phenomenon.
Nowadays, researchers are still trying to make an effort to
bridge the micro-macro divide, as shown in some special
issues of the Academy of Management Journal (Hitt et al.,
2007), the Journal of Organizational Behavior (Griffin,
2007), and the Journal of Management (Aguinis, Boyd,
Pierce, & Short, 2011). One of the reasons for multilevel
thinking and research not being developed in organizational
science may be due to this micro-/macrobridging that is still
a challenge to researchers (Rousseau, 2011). First, it is a
cognitive challenge as people need to reflect on a large
amount of information when considering complex phenom-
ena. It is also a social dilemma, because people wonder why
they should invest their effort in studying complex models
of multilevel research instead of focusing on specific topics
that they can develop in depth. Finally, multilevel research
may be a political process when some levels are viewed as
more important than others. However, in accordance with
Molloy, Ployhart, and Wright (2011), there is not just one
divide between micro- and macroresearch, but there are
indeed two different divides. The authors define "divide" as
a conceptual and methodological separation in the literature
within specific areas. These separations reflect a different
focus on the vast economic and social systems where indi-
viduals and organizations are embedded. The first divide
Lopes Costa et al. 5
identified by Molloy et al. (2011) is called a "system level
divide." Within organizational science, researchers from
different subdomains (organizational behavior, strategy,
entrepreneurship, human resources management, to name a
few) have historically focused their attention differently on
one of three system levels: individuals and groups, organi-
zations, and economic and social systems. As a conse-
quence, depending on the level of the system that researchers
are paying attention to, the operationalization of the micro-
and macroconcepts themselves is different. For example,
within the subdomain of the management of human
resources, macrolevel refers to organizations, broadly
defined, and micro levels refer to individuals, dyads, or
groups. In the subdomain of strategy, however, micro refers
to firms and corporations, whereas macro means industries,
regional clusters, strategic groups, and so on. This makes it
very difficult to merge or to bridge the different areas of
multilevel literature and is related to the problem of defining
the focal unit, as mentioned before: If the bridge were based
on micro-/macrooperationalization, individuals and organi-
zations would be put in the same basket.
The second divide is called "disciplinary divide." Molloy
et al. (2011) defined the "trinity" of disciplines within orga-
nizational research: economics, sociology, and psychology.
Each discipline has its own theoretical approaches (how
phenomena are viewed and conceptualized), specific meth-
odologies (how phenomena are examined and measured),
and particular assumptions. Indeed, there is not a shared
epistemology within organizational science, and this leads
to differences in the way important phenomena are viewed,
conceptualized, examined, and measured. Even when the
methodological procedures are similar, researchers from
different domains use different symbols. Thus, this differ-
ence creates a communicative boundary between micro- and
macroresearchers that leads to confusion and misinterpreta-
tion (Aguinis et al., 2011). For example, the concept of
human capital in psychology is linked to individual differ-
ences in cognitive ability and to diverse psychological pro-
cesses such as learning. For an economist, it is mostly an
investment decision and for a sociologist it has to do with
someone's career history and structural prominence of prior
employees. For Aguinis et al. (2011), the specialization
domains of researchers enhance these divides: Some are
micro, such as organizational behavior and management of
human resources, while others are macro, such as business
policy and strategy, and organization and management
theory.
Journals may also be divided by micro (e.g., Journal of
Applied Psychology) and macro (e.g., Strategic Management
Journal) levels. This division is reflected in the articles'
characteristics, such as their length, acceptance rates, and the
number of coauthors per article. Hitt et al. (2007) showed
that despite some journals publishing micro- and macrostud-
ies, the integration of these perspectives is a challenge that
needs to be met for a greater acceptance of the concept of
"multilevel." Moreover, different researchers perceive the
same journal as contrary to their position. Microresearchers
perceive a journal as a macrojournal while macroresearchers
perceive the same journal as a microjournal (Aguinis et al.,
2011).Also, the membership of the Academy of Management
distinguishes members between micro- and macroclusters.
As a consequence, few members belong to micro- and mac-
rojournals simultaneously (Aguinis et al., 2011). Considering
the evidence for the flourishing of multilevel thinking and its
observable obstacles, is "multilevel" just a keyword that is in
fashion or does it really reflect multilevel thinking, theoriz-
ing, measuring, and analyzing?
To illustrate "what is really practiced" in the domain of mul-
tilevel research, we conducted a literature review to analyze
whether researchers are really doing multilevel research and
whether empirical studies or theoretical proposals are, in fact,
multilevel--or whether they only intend to be multilevel.
Method
Sample and Procedure for Data Analysis
The literature review we performed was broad-based, but not
a systematic one (we excluded proceedings and unpublished
works and we analyzed the abstracts). We conducted the
search on the "ISI Web of Knowledge" dataset, restricted the
search to the "Business" and "Management" web of science
categories, and limited the search to a 10-year period: from
2001 to 2011. We used the term multilevel and the topic
"title." With these criteria we obtained 141 articles. After
reading the abstracts of all articles, nine articles were
excluded because they were not related to multilevel defini-
tion (two examples are Frykfors & Jonsson, 2010 and Xiao,
Kaku, Zhao, & Zhang, 2011). In the end, we identified 132
articles to analyze. Each article was classified based on its
abstract. In a first step, the abstracts were equally divided
among the raters and were classified individually. The
abstracts were then subjected to a second blind analysis to
check whether there was agreement on the classification.
When there was no agreement among the raters, the abstracts
were read and discussed in team meetings until all the authors
reached an agreement.
First, articles were classified as conceptual or empirical.
Within conceptual papers, each article could be classified as
"theoretical" (a new model and/or propositions about spe-
cific topics), or as "research methods" (methodological
developments, discussions about current and new methodol-
ogies, and their application in specific settings). Empirical
papers were classified either as "single-level," "cross-level,"
or "homologous multilevel," according to Kozlowski and
Klein's (2000) proposal.1 We added a new possibility of clas-
sification a posteriori that emerged from the data analysis:
When the researchers considered time as a level of analysis,
we classified those empirical research articles as "time" (see
Table 2).
6 SAGE Open
Results
The results show that 43% of the abstracts correspond to
empirical cross-level studies (see Figure 1). A relevant per-
centage of abstracts correspond to conceptual papers (40%):
theoretical articles (23%) or conceptual research methods
(17%) about multilevel. Only 4% correspond to a homolo-
gous multilevel model.
Levels of Analysis
To deepen our understanding about what is really practiced by
researchers, we performed another analysis: We enumerated
which levels of analysis (individual, team, organizational, and
industrial) were included in the empirical studies. Regarding
the empirical single-level articles (n = 15), the majority (67%)
were studies that analyzed the individual level, and 13% con-
sidered the team level; the remaining 20% analyzed other lev-
els. In homologous multilevel studies (n = 5), we found that
three studies included all levels: individual, team, and organi-
zational levels. One focused on Multilevel Confirmatory
Factor Analysis, studying individual and team levels and the
other one analyzed individual and organizational levels. All
studies that addressed time (n = 2) examined the individual
level. Within the empirical cross-level articles (n = 57), the
majority (47%) were studies that analyzed individual and team
levels. A percentage of 19% studied individual and organiza-
tional levels and 7% referred to variables at team and organi-
zational levels. In a lower quantity, organizational and country
levels were studied in 5% of the papers and 3% focused on
organizational and industrial levels.
Journals, Citations, and Years
We also considered the journals in which articles were pub-
lished, the number of times cited on the Web of Science, and
the year of publication. Sixteen articles were published in
Organizational Research Methods (Impact Factor
5years
[IF
5years
] = 5.366), 10 in the Academy of Management Journal
(IF
5years
= 10.565), 9 in The Leadership Quarterly (IF
5years
=
4.295), as well as in Small Group Research (IF
5years
= 1.582).
Several journals only published one article between 2001
and 2011 (e.g., Human Relations, Human Resource
Management Review, Journal of Business and Psychology).
A closer look at the results clarifies what is happening in
multilevel research. Figure 2 depicts the Journals with the
most "multilevel" articles and the types of articles published,
according to our classification.
Considering the journals with the highest number of publi-
cations (n = 69), 33 were conceptual articles (16 theoretical
and 17 on research methods). Only four reflected homolo-
gous multilevel empirical research (with one being a
Confirmatory Factor Analysis), with the majority (27) pre-
senting cross-level studies. Finally, five articles had single-
level empirical analysis, despite the word "multilevel" in the
title. The 132 "multilevel" articles were cited, on average, 19
times (SD = 28.90); however, 17 articles have not been cited
yet. Five articles (Aguilera, Rupp, Williams, & Ganapathi,
2007; Hitt et al., 2007; Lapointe & Rivard, 2005; Liao &
Chuang, 2004; Taggar, 2002) were cited more than 100
times. These five most cited articles were published in jour-
nals that are in the "top 3" of the management ranking (on
the Web of Science): Academy of Management Review, the
first one in the ranking (IF
5years
= 11.442; Aguilera et al.,
2007), the Academy of Management Journal, the second
(IF
5years
= 10.565; Hitt et al., 2007; Liao & Chuang, 2004;
Taggar, 2002), and the Mis Quarterly, the third in the

had a conceptual nature and the remaining three presented
cross-level empirical research. None reflected empirical
research using a homologous multilevel model. The two most
cited "cross-level" articles were, indeed, cross-level studies.
In 2001, the year Kozlowski and Klein's book was pub-
lished, three "multilevel" articles appeared on the Web of
Science and in 2002 the number increased to 10. So far, 2011
was the most productive year for "multilevel" as 30 articles
were published (see Figure 3).
Discussion
Multilevel research seems to be equally preached and prac-
ticed. Indeed, there are almost as many conceptual papers
(i.e., theoretical and research methods) as empirical cross-
level ones, reflecting the large number of theoretical propos-
als that are "preached." Researchers believe it is important to
develop multilevel research, and tend to theorize about it.
Empirically, researchers mainly conduct investigations that
analyze the relationship between variables at different levels
of analysis--cross-level models--and mainly study top-
down influences between teams and individuals. Research
using homologous multilevel models is scarce. Finally, the
least practiced multilevel methodologies seem to be consid-
ering time as a variable and multilevel confirmatory factor
analysis. Authors might choose other techniques rather than
multilevel modeling to access changes over time (e.g.,
growth modeling, repeated measures).
Biology suggests that facultative mutualism between spe-
cies occurs when two individuals interact with each other for
mutual benefit, with no real need to do so (Odum, 1971). Our
findings lead us to propose that a similar effect is happening
with multilevel theory and cross-level empirical research.
However, the growth of multilevel research is mainly due to
empirical studies with cross-level models. Therefore, multi-
level "grows" in publications and in public recognition with
the development of cross-level studies. On the other hand,
cross-level research benefits multilevel thinking, as it must
rely on models that consider relationships between two or
more levels. In fact, it seems that researchers have been using
the concepts of multilevel and cross-level almost as if they
are completely interchangeable. However, for the sake of
conceptual rigor, researchers must be more cautious with the
use of the words multilevel and cross-level. Indeed, a multi-
level study can be more than a cross-level study and cross-
level models are by no means the only true multilevel ones
(an alternative example is multilevel homologous models).
The number of so-called "multilevel" papers that focus
solely on one level of analysis suggests that there is still
some confusion regarding the difference between multilevel
thinking (considering influences from upper and lower lev-
els theoretically) and multilevel research (actually modeling
the relationships between variables at different levels of
analysis and measuring and statistically analyzing them
accordingly). Multilevel thinking is not absent within the
academic community. What is, perhaps, lacking is the oper-
ationalization of that multilevel thinking in more research
that actually converts an encompassing vision of organiza-
tions in empirical studies. Aguinis et al. (2011) argued that
there is also a science-practice divide. In accordance with
the authors, the practitioners are interested in solving prob-
lems from all levels of analysis and sometimes researchers
explore only one level. When this occurs, practitioners
believe that the research produced is not relevant and cannot
help them. To contribute not only to the understanding of

organizational variables and their statistical relationships,
conducting multilevel research would help bridge the gap
between the science and the practitioner's communities.
Looking at the organizational reality from a practitioner's
viewpoint, with the typology of multilevel models in mind
(Kozlowski & Klein, 2000), one can ask what would be
more important: Knowing if the effect of one variable on
another means the same thing across levels of analysis or
understanding the effect of an important organizational,
industrial, or company-level variable on a team or individ-
ual-level variable? According to the research being done,
researchers apparently consider that the latter is more rele-
vant. Yet, the few numbers of studies may be a consequence
of the complexity in doing so.
Considering the amount of "multilevel" studies carried
out in the last decade (n = 132) in the business and manage-
ment areas, we can assume that, despite multilevel research
being advocated by many researchers, it is not yet a very
common practice. Even influential business and manage-
ment journals are not explicitly asking for multilevel contri-
butions. When we analyze journals' aims and scope, we can
seethatsomeimportantjournalsinBusinessandManagement
(such as the Journal of Management, the Academy of
Management Review, the Journal of Business Economics
and Management) do not clearly mention that they intend to
publish multilevel contributions. Other journals refer to lev-
els of analysis, mentioning that they are "not tied to any par-
ticular discipline, level of analysis, or national context"
(Academy of Management Journal); that they publish
research about psychological phenomena that can be "at one
or multiple levels--individuals, groups, organizations, or
cultures" (Journal of Applied Psychology); or that "The jour-
nal will focus on research and theory in all topics associated
with organizational behavior within and across individual,
group and organizational levels of analysis" (Journal of
Organizational Behavior). Nonetheless, the majority of mul-
tilevel articles are published in these top journals. It seems
that journals with a history of having high-quality research
standards are more open to complex studies.
In spite of the fact that a strong movement toward the
development of multilevel theories and knowledge exists,
much is yet to be done and various problems still have to be
solved before multilevel can progress. In the following sec-
tion, we outline some ideas that we hope may contribute for
the substantiation of multilevel studies.
Roadmap to a Meso Paradigm--Many
Challenges, Some Possible Answers
Mathieu and Chen (2011) argued that despite the multilevel
paradigm being alive and well, it is also faced with some
challenges. However, these can represent opportunities for
the field to continue to evolve, if properly addressed. There
is still much room for enhancing the possibilities of develop-
ing and conducting serious and valid studies with a more
integrated approach. Some authors (House, Rousseau, &
Thomas-Hunt, 1995) refer to this integrated science of orga-
nizations with the term meso, implying that organizational
science is simultaneously macro and micro. As previously
stated by other authors, we believe that the solution may
indeed lie in meso thinking. Once we start assuming that
companies and organizational systems are complex systems,
constantly changing and interacting with outside systems
(e.g., the market) and inside systems (e.g., departments), it
becomes clear that a useful way for us to research in a multi-
level scenario is to think and to do meso.
Level of theory.One first challenge concerns the existing
models about organizational theory. Some authors have
already identified aspects that may contribute to closing the
gap between micro and macro and between the science-prac-
tice divide. Molloy et al. (2011) and Hitt et al. (2007) recom-
mended that researchers focus on the real-world phenomena
faced by practitioners, integrating their knowledge and pro-
moting/facilitating multilevel thinking in organizational pro-
fessionals.As those who are in the field do not analyze reality
by thinking abstractly about levels or disciplines, they are
likely to be able to describe important multilevel phenomena
that researchers, embedded in their own disciplines and lev-
els, may not be able to conceive. However, as most world-
wide leaders and managers have not been trained to think
"multilevel," they lack the awareness that several variables
at different levels may establish interactions that will lead to
new arrangements of systems, and influence organizational
dynamics. Academia should also provide students (future
professionals and researchers) with the appropriate mind-set
to think (with theories) and act "multilevel" (with tools and
statistical analysis).
Level of measurement.The measurement processes/tech-
niques/instruments present another considerable challenge
for "multilevel": there are no clear guidelines about the steps
necessary to validate the transition of a construct that exists
at one level of analysis to another level of analysis. More-
over, even when there is an attempt to do it, researchers tend
to aggregate individual answers at higher levels. However,
there are concepts that only make sense at the individual
level, and the way they are measured at the individual level
does not reflect the higher level. Studying a higher level con-
struct is not just a question of methodology or data analysis,
but is essentially a theoretical one. Collective constructs that
are driven from individual level must have a solid theoretical
base that supports their existence.
Level of analysis.Multilevel theories and methods assume
that units are perfectly nested within higher levels, but this
situation is not always true, considering the complexities of
most organizational contexts. Thus, analytic techniques
should consider the nonindependence of nesting arrange-
ments, namely network approaches and qualitative data for
Lopes Costa et al. 9
further generating appropriate quantitative data. There are
also important limitations in software development and an
absence of mathematical principals and mature software
instruments. Indeed, there are still current software limita-
tions in making the model specification of some conceptual
multilevel models and common metrics for model assess-
ment. As multilevel analysis is complex and highly sensi-
tive to internal and external variation and until the
development or integration (from other sciences) of new
mathematical procedures is possible, statistical procedure
may be a limitation itself for effective multilevel analysis,
making it very difficult for multilevel theory and methodol-
ogy to progress.
The time variable.Finally, multilevel temporal issues
challenge researchers to model nested and longitudinal rela-
tionships. This becomes more important as some units may
change their higher level membership over time. So, future
multilevel research should also address temporal elements.
According to Rousseau (2011), simulations are extremely
useful to study effects over time, as they reduce the typi-
cal complications associated with longitudinal designs and
are being successfully adopted by some authors (Mathieu &
Schulze, 2006; Santos & Passos, in press).
Once Multilevel, Always Multilevel?
One important final consideration is necessary. Despite the
importance and the advantages of multilevel thinking, we
should not be carried away by its enthusiastic developments
and assume that we should always conduct multilevel
research. In fact, in some situations, multilevel is not at all
suitable. As Simon (1973) stated, even in real-world organi-
zations, what happens at lower levels (like departments) is
often ignored by the higher levels (e.g., CEO), except on
some occasions (for instance, when the department misses a
deadline or goes over the stipulated budget). In this sense, in
some situations, researchers would benefit by focusing their
study on parts of the organization instead of the whole.
Mathieu and Chen (2011) have also explored this issue and
wondered whether all research has to be multilevel. In accor-
dance with the authors, it is valuable to adopt a bracketing
strategy, meaning to include constructs of one level lower
and one level higher in the conceptual and empirical analy-
sis. So, researchers should justify why they selected specific
variables from one level and why they excluded others.
In short, researchers not only have to worry about how to
do multilevel research (and deal with the associated prob-
lems) but also about when to (or not to) do it. Before con-
ducting a multilevel study, researchers need to take some
aspects into account. First, they should only conduct a multi-
level study when it will make a significant contribution
within a given theoretical field. Moreover, researchers should
only conduct a multilevel analysis when theory supports the
multilevel relationship. If theory does not support it, they
should change the variables, hypotheses, or redo the litera-
ture review. Finally, the researchers need to analyze whether
there is appropriate theoretical work, methodological proce-
dures, and instruments to conduct a multilevel analysis, and,
only after that, proceed with their work. Otherwise, instead
of contributing to accurate and useful knowledge, unregu-
lated and ill-conceived multilevel practices will lead to inac-
curate theory building.
Conclusion
The present study was conducted using a limited time range
(2001-2011) and also restricted the search to the "Business"
and "Management" web of science categories. Therefore, the
results must be interpreted considering these limitations and
may not be generalized to other knowledge areas. Moreover,
we limited the keyword search to the article's title and ana-
lyzed only the abstracts, not the full text, which may have led
to missing some relevant information.
However, within our research criteria, it is clear that now-
adays, 12 years after Kozlowski and Klein's (2000) initial
introduction, no one can say that "multilevel" is not alive and
well: Multilevel issues are definitely experiencing an inter-
esting moment, as the attention in this kind of methodology
seems to be growing. Many researchers are committed to
exploring the potential of multilevel research, as well as its
limitations and weaknesses, or simply reinforcing its prac-
tice. However, it is assumed that there are some problems
and challenges to be solved and some bridges to build to
achieve an effective multilevel theory and practice. Our anal-
ysis demonstrates that researchers recognize the importance
of multilevel research, but articles on conceptual models are
almost as numerous as empirical ones. Moreover, the major-
ity of the empirical papers focus on one specific type of mul-
tilevel model--cross-level models--but more research is
still to be done in other kinds of multilevel models.
Nevertheless, more problematic is the existence of single-
level research under the definition of "multilevel."
If we want to intervene and apply our conceptual models
to real organizations, that are concrete multilevel systems, it
will require more than small fragments of problems/phenom-
ena. We need research that focuses on the dynamics between
levels of observation and that unfold over time to understand
how the different subsystems within organizations interact
and evolve.
