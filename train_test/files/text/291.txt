Vitamin D has been hypothesized to reduce cancer mortality
through its effects on incidence and/or survival (1,2). Support for
these hypotheses comes from a diversity of scientific approaches:
Animal and in vitro studies have shown that vitamin D plays a
variety of biologic roles that potentially reduce cancer incidence
and promote survival, including suppressing tumor progression by
reducing cell proliferation and stimulating apoptosis and cell dif-
ferentiation (3,4). Exposure to sunlight is one of the major sources
of vitamin D (5), and ecologic studies have demonstrated an
inverse association between indicators of residential ultraviolet
radiation and cancer mortality at various sites, including the colon,
ovary, prostate, and breast (6­9). Subsequent ecologic and obser-
vational studies found an inverse gradient for solar radiation sur-
rogates (e.g., residence, outdoor work) for mortality due to these
and other cancer sites (10­12). Recent analytic epidemiologic stud-
ies found improved survival for several cancers if diagnosis or treat-
ment occurred during nonwinter seasons, compared with winter,
leading to the speculation that therapy may positively interact with
vitamin D (2,13­16). The observation that some individuals who
are obese or dark-skinned tend to have lower vitamin D levels and
higher cancer mortality has led some investigators to suggest that
these associations may be mediated by vitamin D levels (1,17).
Finally, a recent Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS)
that was based on predicted 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]
values (the major circulating form of vitamin D) estimated that a
25 nmol/L difference in predicted 25(OH)D was associated with a
29% reduction in total cancer mortality risk in men (18).
After its photochemical synthesis in the skin, vitamin D
3
is
hydroxylated in the liver to the major circulating form, 25(OH)D,
and further hydroxylated in the kidneys, to the active or hormonal
form of vitamin D [1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D
3
or 1,25(OH)
2
D]. In
recent years, it has been established that hormonal vitamin D is
also synthesized from 25(OH)D in several extrarenal tissues (19).

Prospective Study of Serum Vitamin D and Cancer
Mortality in the United States
D. Michal Freedman, Anne C. Looker, Shih-Chen Chang, Barry I. Graubard
Background Vitamin D has been hypothesized to reduce cancer mortality through its effects on incidence and/or sur-
vival. Epidemiologic studies of the association of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and the risk of cancer,
however, have been largely limited to incident cancers at a few sites.
Methods A total of 16818 participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey who were 17
years or older at enrollment were followed from 1988­1994 through 2000. Levels of serum 25(OH)D were
measured at baseline by radioimmunoassay. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to
examine the relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and total cancer mortality (in the entire popula-
tion or according to race/ethnicity, sex, age, and retinol status) and mortality from specific cancers.
Because serum was collected in the south in cooler months and the north in warmer months, we exam-
ined associations by collection season. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Results We identified 536 cancer deaths in 146578 person-years. Total cancer mortality was unrelated to baseline
vitamin D status in the entire population, men, women, non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican
Americans, and in persons younger than 70 or 70 years or older. We found no interaction between vitamin
D and season or vitamin D and serum retinol. Colorectal cancer mortality was inversely related to serum
25(OH)D level, with levels 80 nmol/L or higher associated with a 72% risk reduction (95% confidence inter-
val = 32% to 89%) compared with lower than 50 nmol/L, P
trend
= .02.
Conclusions Our results do not support an association between 25(OH)D and total cancer mortality, although there was
an inverse relationship between 25(OH)D levels and colorectal cancer mortality.

and sun exposure [and serve as a substrate for 1,25(OH)
2
D in other
organs], whereas circulating 1,25(OH)
2
D is homeostatically con-
trolled, circulating 25(OH)D is considered to be reflective of an
individual's vitamin D status.
Despite the potential benefits of vitamin D, to our knowledge,
the relationship between measured vitamin D levels and total can-
cer mortality has not been examined prospectively. In this study,
we examined the relationship between serum 25(OH)D and cancer
mortality in persons aged 17 years and older from the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES
III), a nationally representative sample of the noninstitutionalized
US population.
Methods
Study Population
The NHANES III survey, which was conducted between 1988 and
1994 by the National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, was designed to examine the
health and nutritional status of the noninstitutionalized US popula-
tion (20). In addition to providing representative estimates of health
and nutrition for the total noninstitutionalized population, the sur-
vey was designed to provide separate estimates for three major
racial/ethnic groups: non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks,
and Mexican Americans. It was conducted with oversampling from
the latter two populations. Data were collected by interview and
physical examinations (conducted in Mobile Examinations Centers)
that included blood sampling for vitamin D and other serum con-
stituents. All procedures were approved by the National Center for
Health Statistics Institutional Review Board, and all subjects pro-
vided written informed consent.
We restricted eligibility to those who were aged 17 years and
older at baseline and who had completed the physical examination
in a Mobile Examination Center (n = 17705). Those who had no
25(OH)D measurement (n = 875), were of unknown mortality
status (n = 11), or were missing birthdate (n = 1) were excluded,
resulting in a cohort of 16818 subjects.
Vitamin D Measurement
Detailed information on the assay used to measure 25(OH)D has
been provided elsewhere (21). Briefly, levels of serum 25(OH)D
were assayed with a radioimmunoassay kit (DiaSorin, Stillwater,
MN). The coefficient of variation was 10%­25% (average 17.6%)
for lower 25(OH)D values (20­62.5 nmol/L) and 12%­18%
(average 15%) for higher values (85­147.5 nmol/L). The highest
coefficient of variation, 25%, corresponds to a mean 25(OH)D
value close to the assay detection limit, which reflects the fact that
small variability in the lower levels of measured 25(OH)D values
can result in higher coefficients of variation.
Categorical 25(OH)D cut points were set at less than 50, 62.5,
80, 100, and 120 nmol/L. The three lowest categories (<50, 50­
<62.5, and 62.5­<80 nmol/L) were chosen because they reflect
alternative cut points for 25(OH)D insufficiency (in the absence
of agreement on optimal levels) (21,22). Even lower values, e.g.,
37.5 nmol/L, have been used as cut points, but small case num-
bers prevented us from using lower threshold values in our analy-
ses. The highest cut points were selected to reflect the full
distribution of 25(OH)D values, with 20%, 10%, and 7% of the
cohort respectively, corresponding to 25(OH)D levels of 80 to
less than 100, 100 to less than 120, or 120 nmol/L or higher.
Subgroup analyses included fewer cut points, with the number of
intervals varying according to the case number size in each
subgroup.
Sample Collection
Between 1988 and 1994, blood samples were collected in different
seasons, with collection in southern latitudes undertaken in the
cooler months of November through March and collection in
northern latitudes in warmer months (April­October) because the
mobile vans used for data collection were sensitive to weather
(21). Thus, season and latitude, both of which are related to
25(OH)D levels, are linked in the dataset, which limits the oppor-
tunity to assess each variable independent of the other. We refer
to the two groups as "winter/lower latitude" and "summer/higher
latitude."
Endpoint Ascertainment
Follow-up of the cohort continued from data collection until
December 31, 2000, and was based on the NHANES III Linked
Mortality file (International Statistical Classification of Diseases,
10th Revision) (with 113 underlying causes of death), which had
been derived through probabilistic linkage with the National Death
Index. Cancer mortality was based on International Statistical
Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, codes (Table 2). Survival
follow-up continued until the event of interest, an underlying cause
of death due to cancer. Follow-up was censored at the date of death
for persons who died of other diseases and at December 31, 2000,
for persons who were not known to have died.
CONTEXT AND CAVEATS
Prior knowledge
Based on epidemiologic studies, vitamin D has been hypothesized
to reduce cancer mortality.
Study design
Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to exam-
ine the relationship between serum vitamin D level measured in
participants in a nationwide survey of health and nutrition and
cancer mortality.
Contribution
This study found that total cancer mortality was not related to vita-
min D status but that higher levels of vitamin D may be associated
with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer mortality.
Implications
Inverse associations between a surrogate for vitamin D status and
cancer mortality reported previously are not supported by the
results of this study.
Limitations
This study lacked power to clarify associations between vitamin D
status and particular cancers for which there were insufficient
deaths, and it relied on a single measurement to reflect serum
vitamin D status.

Confounding Variables
We considered race/ethnicity, latitude, body mass index (BMI),
total body fat, education level, smoking patterns, levels of physical
activity, disease history, calcium intake, and serum retinol levels as
potential confounders. Race/ethnicity was based on self-report, and
latitude, on the location of the physical examination. BMI was cal-
culated as body weight (kilograms) divided by height (meters)
squared, using height and weight measured during the physical
exam (20). Total body fat (kilograms) was derived using bioelectri-
cal impedance analysis data as previously described (23).
Education was based on self-reported number of years of
schooling completed. Smoking status was derived from responses
to questionnaire items that asked whether the respondents had
ever smoked at least 100 cigarettes, and if so, whether they cur-
rently smoked. Pack-years were calculated from multiplying the
reported number of cigarettes smoked per day by the years
smoked. There were two physical activity variables, one based on
the self-reported frequency of various activities and another
derived from a self-rating of personal activity level compared with
others of the same age and sex.
Dietary calcium and vitamin D intake from food and alcohol
were based on a single 24-hour dietary recall. The University of
Minnesota Nutrition Coordinating Center food composition data-
base was used for the vitamin D composition data (24,25), while
the U.S. Department of Agriculture food composition database
provided the calcium and alcohol values (26). Serum retinol was
measured by high-performance liquid chromatography at the
National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (27).
Statistical Analysis
Chi-square tests and multiple linear regression were used to assess
associations between baseline demographic and health-related
characteristics and serum 25(OH)D levels. Cox proportional haz-
ards regression analysis was used to compute relative risks (RR)
with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for total and site-specific can-
cer mortality by categorical level of 25(OH)D, with age (beginning
at baseline) as the time line (28). The proportional hazards
assumption was tested by examining the interaction between the
age attained during the study with the measured continuous
25(OH)D serum value and was found to be satisfied. We examined
total cancer mortality in each of the two season/latitude groups, as
well as for each sex, in non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks,
and Mexican Americans, and in age strata (<70 and 70 years
[attained age], with these strata selected based on case numbers).
To further assess whether 25(OH)D levels are associated with dif-
ference in cancer mortality by race, we examined mortality risk with
and without adjusting for 25(OH)D measurements, after control-
ling for a number of potentially confounding factors generally
comparable to those in the HPFS that sought to explore the role of
vitamin D in explaining racial differences in cancer incidence and
mortality (29). These factors were sex, smoking status, BMI, lati-
tude, total calories, alcohol, dietary calcium intake, serum retinol
and physical activity.
We also assessed site-specific cancer mortality, including
mortality due to cancer of the lung, colon or rectum, other diges-
tive organs, breast, and prostate, as well as mortality due to non-
Hodgkin lymphoma or leukemia. Site-specific cancer mortality
outcomes were selected based in part on suggested protective asso-
ciations with dietary, circulating vitamin D, and other indicators of
vitamin D exposure reported previously (e.g., colorectal, breast,
prostate) (1,12,17,30). We combined deaths due to non-Hodgkin
lymphoma and leukemia because of small numbers and because
experimental and epidemiologic studies suggest a possible associa-
tion between vitamin D or solar radiation and these hematopoetic
cancers (11,31­35).
Potential confounders were assessed by examining Pearson and
Spearman correlation coefficients with serum 25(OH)D for the
unweighted sample. No correlation coefficient was greater than
.24. We also assessed the potential confounders listed above to
identify the ones that substantively affected the main effects. The
final models were adjusted for sex, race/ethnicity, and smoking
(never, former, current <20 pack-years, 20 pack-years, unknown
pack-years). We also analyzed the relationships between 25(OH)D
and cancer mortality after excluding the first year of follow-up
because individuals who died within the first year may have had
disease at baseline. However, exclusion of the first year of follow-
up had little effect on risks, and results are not reported.
Trend tests were based on modeling the measured values of
25(OH)D both as a continuous variable and by assigning a value
for the median of each category of measured values and modeling
the resulting variable as continuous. Results were similar using
both methods (when there were more than two categories), so only
those based on the former are reported. All statistical tests were
two-sided, and P values less than .05 were considered to be statisti-
cally significant.
To explore effect modification, we examined stratified analyses
and multiplicative interaction by creating product terms. We
assessed seasonal/latitude group for interaction with 25(OH)D for
total cancer mortality. We also examined interaction of 25(OH)D
level with serum retinol levels for total cancer and colorectal can-
cer mortality to explore a published hypothesis that retinol intake
may counteract the cancer prevention effects of vitamin D (1).
All statistical tests using Cox proportional hazards analysis were
based on the Wald-F test (36). The data were analyzed using the
SUDAAN software program, a family of statistical procedures for
analysis of data from complex sample surveys (release 9.0.1,
Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC). Sample
weights were used to conduct weighted analyses to account for
the unequal probability of selecting individuals and for survey
nonresponse (36).
Results
We identified 536 deaths due to cancer during 146578 person-
years of follow-up in the NHANES III study, of which 206 were in
the winter/lower latitude group and 330 in the summer/higher lati-
tude group. The distribution of 25(OH)D measurements varied to
a statistically significant extent according to the factors presented
in Table 1 (P.001, except for education [P = .01] and alcohol
[P = .004]). Men, whites, and more highly educated participants
were more likely to have higher 25(OH)D values than women, both
African Americans and Mexican Americans, and less educated par-
ticipants, respectively (Table 1). Higher BMI was associated with
jnci.oxfordjournals.org JNCI | Articles 1597
lower 25(OH)D serum measurement, with a mean BMI of 27.8
kg/m2 in subjects with 25(OH)D lower than 50 nmol/L and a mean
BMI of 25.2 kg/m2 in those with 25(OH)D 80 nmol/L or higher.
In contrast, reported levels of physical activity were higher in those
with higher 25(OH)D, with 71.1% of those with circulating
25(OH)D lower than 50 nmol/L reporting a level of physical activ-
ity the same or greater than others of the same age/sex and 80.4%
reporting such physical activity in those with circulating 25(OH)D
80 nmol/L or higher. Dietary vitamin D and calcium, as well as
serum retinol, were higher in those with higher 25(OH)D levels
(Table 1).
In the combined group of both season/latitude subpopulations,
total cancer mortality was unrelated to 25(OH)D level (P
trend
= .65)
(Table 2). There was also no relationship to cancer mortality in
either the winter/lower latitude or summer/higher latitude groups,
and the test for interaction with season/latitude groups was not
statistically significant (P = .36).
When we confined the analysis to men, there was similarly no
statistically significant association between 25(OH)D and cancer
mortality risk in the combined season/latitude subpopulations,
although there was a suggestion of elevated risk in the two highest
categories of 25(OH)D [80 to <100 nmol/L: RR = 1.21, 95% CI =
0.83 to 1.78; 100 nmol/L: RR = 1.35; 95% CI = 0.78 to 2.31]
(Table 2). In women, there was also no association in the com-
bined season/latitude subpopulations (Table 2). Because the test
for interaction with season/latitudes groups was not statistically
significant for men (P = .70) or for women (P = .26), we have not
presented associations by sex and season/latitude groups. In addi-
tion, no association was seen in each age stratum (<70 or 70 years
at attained age; data not shown).
When we considered racial/ethnic groups separately, there was
also no association between 25(OH)D and total cancer mortality in
non-Hispanic whites (P
trend
= .80), non-Hispanic blacks (P
trend
= .14),
or Mexican Americans (P
trend
= .37) (Table 3). As with sex, the test
for interaction with season/latitude groups was not statistically
significant for non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, or
Mexican Americans, and we have therefore not presented associa-
tions by season/latitude group. Moreover, we found a statistically
significantly elevated risk in non-Hispanic blacks compared with
non-Hispanic whites that was not reduced by adjusting for serum
25(OH)D (data not shown).
We analyzed the relationship between serum 25(OH)D level
and site-specific cancer mortality (Table 4). One hundred fifty-
three subjects died of lung cancer; 66, of colorectal cancer; 72, of
other digestive cancers; 28, of breast cancer; 47, of prostate can-
cer; 40, of non-Hodgkin lymphoma or leukemia; and 130, of
other cancers. We found no relationship between 25(OH)D level
and lung cancer mortality. There was a statistically significant
inverse relationship between colorectal cancer mortality and
25(OH)D levels (P
trend
= .02). Serum levels at or above 80 nmol/L

were associated with lower risk (RR = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.11 to
0.68) compared with levels lower than 50 nmol/L. Mortality for
cancers at the other digestive cancer sites combined (including
esophagus, stomach, liver, and pancreatic cancer) showed no asso-
ciation with 25(OH)D levels (P = .18).
Levels of 25(OH)D levels were stratified in two categories
(<62.5 and 62.5 nmol/L) to assess breast cancer mortality, with the
cut point reflecting one alternative level of 25(OH)D insufficiency
(21). The higher category (with small case numbers, n = 8) was
related to a statistically significantly lower risk of mortality due to
breast cancer (RR = 0.28; 95% CI = 0.08 to 0.93), but the linear
trend [modeling 25(OH)D level as continuous values] was not sta-
tistically significant (P
trend
= .76). There was also no association
between prostate cancer mortality and 25(OH)D levels (stratified
as <62.5 and 62.5 nmol/L). Neither mortality due to non-
Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia combined nor mortality due to
all cancers not in the major groupings demonstrated a relationship
to 25(OH)D.
We examined the association between total cancer mortality and
serum retinol (umol/L) in quartiles to address the hypothesis that
retinol might counteract cancer prevention by vitamin D. There
was a suggestion of declining risk (RR with increasing retinol = 0.94
[95% CI = 0.67 to 1.32]; 0.91 [95% CI = 0.61 to 1.35]; 0.73 [95%
CI = 0.49 to 1.09]), but the linear trend was not statistically signifi-
cant (P
trend
= .17). The pattern was similar in both season/latitude
groups (data not shown). The relationship between 25(OH)D
(whether treated as a continuous or categorical variable) and total
cancer mortality was not modified by serum retinol (in two catego-
ries, split at the median) (test of interaction, P = .13 and P = .41,
respectively). There was also no interaction between 25(OH)D and
serum retinol for colorectal cancer mortality (P = .76, P = .91).
Discussion
We found no association between 25(OH)D and total cancer mor-
tality in the total NHANES III study population or in either
season/latitude subpopulation. We did, however, find an inverse
association with colorectal cancer mortality. Although there was
also a statistically significant inverse association with female breast
cancer mortality when subjects were divided into those with high
and low levels of 25(OH)D, the linear trend was not statistically
significant and the number of deaths due to breast cancer was
small. For all other cancer sites and groups of sites that we exam-
ined, there was no association between mortality and 25(OH)D
levels. To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the
relationship between measured serum vitamin D levels and cancer
mortality for selected sites and for all sites combined.
The study of the relationship between vitamin D levels and
cancer mortality has been based largely on latitude or other surro-
gates for exposure to solar radiation, not vitamin D itself (6,7,10).

(prostate); C82­C85, C91­C95 (non-Hodgkin lymphoma/leukemia); and C00­C14, C17, C23­C24, C26­C32, C37­C41, C43­C49, C51­C52, C54­C60, C62­C65,
C67­C80, C88, C90, C97 (other cancers, including buccal, larynx, melanoma, gynecological sites, kidney, bladder, brain, multiple myeloma).

There has, however, been one randomized controlled 5-year trial
of triannual high oral doses of vitamin D that evaluated cancer
mortality. It found a somewhat lower cancer mortality risk (RR =
0.86, 95% CI = 0.61 to 1.20) in subjects who were given vitamin
D, although the case numbers were small (n = 135 cancer deaths in
both arms combined) and the difference in risk was not statistically
significant (37). In addition, as noted above, one study estimated
that there was a 29% reduction in total cancer mortality risk
associated with an increment of 25 nmol/L in 25(OH)D based on
a predictive model for vitamin D level (18).
Several studies have, however, addressed the association
between serum vitamin D level and site-specific cancer incidence.
Our finding that colorectal cancer mortality is inversely associated
with 25(OH)D is consistent with a large number of observational
epidemiologic studies (1,17,38). Several prospective studies of the
relationship between serum/plasma 25(OH)D and colorectal can-
cer incidence have found a reduced risk associated with increased
vitamin D. One of the largest of these was a nested case­control
study with 193 cases of colorectal cancer within the Nurses' Health
Study. It found that the odds ratio of colorectal cancer for women
in the highest relative to the lowest quintile of 25(OH)D was 0.53
(95% CI = 0.27 to 1.04) and that there was a statistically significant
linear inverse trend (P = .02) (39). Three smaller studies
(n = 34, 57, and 146 cases) also found lower risks of colorectal
cancer associated with higher 25(OH)D (40­42). In addition, cir-
culating 25(OH)D was associated with reduced risk of colorectal
adenomas in women, although not in men (43). However, the
Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trial of
calcium (1000 mg) and vitamin D (400 IU) supplements over an
average of 7 years of follow-up found no association between the
intervention supplements and colorectal cancer incidence (44).
Nonetheless, the case­control study of baseline serum 25(OH)D
nested in the trial found a statistically significant inverse associa-
tion of colorectal cancer risk with baseline level of serum 25(OH)D,
suggesting that the null result of the trial may have been due to low
trial doses of vitamin D, insufficient trial duration (45), or reduced
risk being limited to those with low baseline levels.
Only one study has prospectively examined the relationship
between circulating levels of 25(OH)D and the risk of breast can-
cer (46). In that study, which included 701 breast cancer patients,
women in the third, fourth, or fifth quintiles of 25(OH)D had a
somewhat lower risk of incident breast cancer than women in the
two lowest quintiles, suggesting a possible threshold effect.
Although we observed a substantially reduced risk of breast cancer
mortality for those with 25(OH)D measurements at or above 62.5
nmol/L, the linear trend was not statistically significant and the
number of breast cancer deaths was small, so the result must be
interpreted with caution. In fact, the estimated relative risk of
breast cancer mortality associated with a 50-nmol change in
25(OH)D (RR = 0.83) was bounded by confidence intervals (95%
CI = 0.24 to 2.85) that are, too wide to rule out either the possible
protective effect observed in the study by Bertone-Johnson et al.
(46) in which the relative risk for the fifth quintile compared with
the first quintile [a difference in 25(OH)D of approximately
50 nmol] was 0.73, or an increased risk with rising 25(OH)D.
The absence of other associations, including the lack of any
relationship between 25(OH)D level and total cancer mortality,
does not support the current interest in 25(OH)D as a prohormone
that reduces the risk of and mortality due to a wide range of can-
cers. It is also inconsistent with the inverse association with cancer
mortality risk observed in the HPFS, which was based on predicted
25(OH)D values rather than on actual measured values (18).
There was no association between total cancer mortality and
25(OH)D in non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and
Mexican Americans; thus, our results do not support the hypothe-
sis that low vitamin D levels in blacks contribute to racial dispari-
ties in cancer mortality (29). The fact that the cancer mortality risk
in non-Hispanic blacks relative to non-Hispanic whites did not fall
after adjusting for serum 25(OH)D is also inconsistent with vita-
min D being a major factor in cancer mortality differences.

Retinol has been hypothesized to modify adversely the pro-
posed protective association between vitamin D and cancer (1).
The theoretical basis for this proposal stems from an interaction
between the hormonal vitamin D/vitamin D receptor complex and
the retinoid X receptor to form a heterodimer complex that inter-
acts with DNA sequences. It has been proposed that if retinol lev-
els are high, this molecule may compete with hormonal vitamin D
for the retinoid X receptor and thus reduce the activity of vitamin
D (1). Animal and human evidence cited in support of the hypoth-
esis relates to effects of vitamin D on serum calcium and bone
health (1). Although one nested case­control study (46) of breast
cancer and 25(OH)D examined the effects of retinol levels and did
not find that retinol modified the actions of 25(OH)D, our study
is the first, to our knowledge, to examine whether serum retinol
modifies the association between 25(OH)D and total cancer mor-
tality. We found no interaction between serum 25(OH)D and reti-
nol in relationship to overall cancer mortality (where there was
also no main effect of 25(OH)D) or in relationship to mortality
from colorectal cancer, which was inversely associated with
25(OH)D. Thus, our results do not support a role for retinol levels
in modifying an association between 25(OH)D levels and cancer.
Our study had several strengths. Serum 25(OH)D measure-
ments were obtained from an entire study population that was
derived from a representative sample of the civilian, noninstitu-
tionalized US population. We studied a wide range of covariates
and assessed an endpoint, cancer mortality, with a substantial
follow-up period (median 8.9 years) so that our results would be
sensitive to potential associations of vitamin D with survival.
Our study, however, recorded small numbers of cancer deaths
for certain cancer sites and racial and season/latitude subgroups,
and this limited our ability to detect associations. Other limitations
included the imprecision in measurements of 25(OH)D, our lim-
ited ability to assess risk at particularly low values of 25(OH)D
because of the absence of winter values for 25(OH)D in northern

latitudes, and a measurement of 25(OH)D based on a blood sample
that was collected at a single point in time, an imperfect surrogate
for long-term indicators of 25(OH)D. A recent cohort study, how-
ever, measured 25(OH)D concentrations at two times that were
3 years apart and found a Pearson correlation coefficient of .70
between samples (P<.001) (47).
In summary, we did not find a relationship between prospective
serum 25(OH)D and total cancer mortality, although we observed
a negative dose­response relationship between 25(OH)D and
colorectal cancer mortality. Serum retinol did not modify the rela-
tionship between 25(OH)D and total cancer or colorectal mortal-
ity. Additional studies with large numbers of samples of measured
25(OH)D serum levels, preferably at multiple time points, are
needed to confirm the total cancer mortality findings of this paper
and to obtain more accurate risk estimates for mortality from
specific cancers.
