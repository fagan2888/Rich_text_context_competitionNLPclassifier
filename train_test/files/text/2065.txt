SUMMARY
Most investigations in the social and health sciences aim to understand the directional or causal relation-
ship between a treatment or risk factor and outcome. Given the multitude of pathways through which the
treatment or risk factor may affect the outcome, there is also an interest in decomposing the effect of a
treatment of risk factor into "direct" and "mediated" effects. For example, child's socioeconomic status
(risk factor) may have a direct effect on the risk of death (outcome) and an effect that may be mediated
through the adulthood socioeconomic status (mediator). Building on the potential outcome framework
for causal inference, we develop a Bayesian approach for estimating direct and mediated effects in the
context of a dichotomous mediator and dichotomous outcome, which is challenging as many parameters
cannot be fully identified. We first define principal strata corresponding to the joint distribution of the
observed and counterfactual values of the mediator, and define associate, dissociative, and mediated ef-
fects as functions of the differences in the mean outcome under differing treatment assignments within the
principal strata. We then develop the likelihood properties and calculate nonparametric bounds of these
causal effects assuming randomized treatment assignment. Because likelihood theory is not well devel-
oped for nonidentifiable parameters, we consider a Bayesian approach that allows the direct and mediated
effects to be expressed in terms of the posterior distribution of the population parameters of interest. This
range can be reduced by making further assumptions about the parameters that can be encoded in prior
distribution assumptions. We perform sensitivity analyses by using several prior distributions that make
weaker assumptions than monotonicity or the exclusion restriction. We consider an application that ex-
plores the mediating effects of adult poverty on the relationship between childhood poverty and risk of
death.

1. INTRODUCTION
Social and health scientists are often interested in understanding how the effect of a risk factor or exposure
Z on outcome Y may be mediated through a third factor D. For example, children born into poverty may
have their life span shortened through a variety of mechanisms. One of them might be that childhood
poverty causes adult poverty, which in turn leads to reduced life span via poor (adult) health care, in-
creased stress, and other factors (Backlund and others, 1996), so that adult poverty is a mediator between
childhood poverty and risk of death. Alternatively, there may be effects of childhood poverty, for example,
poor childhood health care, health knowledge, attitudes and behaviors, and a variety of other impacts that
lead directly to reduced life span irrespective of adult poverty status (Kauhanen and others, 2006). The
concept of direct and mediated effects is often used in the vaccine literature (Halloran and Struchiner,
1995; Haber, 1999), where vaccines can reduce the risk of contracting a disease through stimulation of
subject's immune system or directly affect risk of infection through the "herd effect," the slowing or stop-
ping of a disease's movement through a population with an increased overall immune response. Direct
and mediated effects are also closely related to issue of inference with a surrogate marker (Prentice, 1989;
Taylor and others, 2005), where a good surrogate outcome serves as a mediator of treatment effect, leaving
little effect of the treatment to directly impact the true outcome of interest through other channels.
Regression methods to investigate mediation were outlined by Baron and Kenny (1986). They suggest
fitting linear models to the data of the form
E(Y | Z = z) = 1 + 1z,
E(D | Z = z) = 2 + 2z,
E(Y | D = d, Z = z) = 3 + 3z +  d. (1.1)
Mediation is evaluated by considering whether or not there is a significant marginal association between
the exposure and outcome (1 = 0), whether or not there is a significant association between the exposure
and the mediator and between the outcome and the mediator after adjusting for the exposure (2 = 0
and  = 0), and whether or not the direct effect of the exposure on the outcome is smaller in magnitude
than the total effect (|3| < |1|). If all these conditions are met, then D is said to mediate the effect of
Z on Y. Interpreting the coefficients in the linear model becomes more problematic when the outcome
is binary, particularly if confounders are included in (1.1) (Mackinnon and Dwyer, 1993). In this setting,
Mackinnon and others (2007) treat the outcome as a coarsened version of a continuous latent variable
that can be modeled as in (1.1), with numerical integration or simulation procedures used to evaluate the
marginal distribution of Y|Z under an explicit assumption about the distribution of D|Z.
A special case of mediation occurs when D is considered to be a "surrogate outcome" standing in
for the true outcome of interest Y: Prentice (1989) discusses a model similar to that of Baron and Kenny,
where the definition of a perfect surrogate assumes that 3 = 0 after adjusting for D. Wang and Taylor
(2002), among others, define measures of the degree to which these surrogate markers can replace the
true outcomes, that is, the degree to which these surrogate markers mediate the relationship between the
treatment and outcome.
A shortcoming of these approaches is that they condition on a postrandomization variable, the ob-
served mediator D = d, after the assignment of Z. Hence, the effect of Z on Y after adjusting for D
can no longer be interpreted causally, even if Z is randomly assigned (Rosenbaum, 1984). To get around
this, Robins and Greenland (1992) define direct and indirect effects in terms of potential outcomes. They
consider the set of potential outcomes to include the value of the outcome under each of the possible
values of the exposure and mediator and allow the set of "potential observables" to include values of the
mediator under each of the potential exposure assignments. They define a "prescriptive" direct effect as
the expected value of the difference in the potential outcomes under different treatment assignments when
Bayesian inference for causal mediation effects 355
the value of the mediator is held constant, and an associated prescriptive indirect effect as the expected
difference in the total effect (expected difference in potential outcomes under different treatment assign-
ments population averaged over all values of the mediator) as the prescriptive direct effect. In a setting of
dichotomous exposures, mediators, and outcomes, assuming that the exposure is randomized and never
improves the value of the mediator and that the effect of the potential exposure and the potential mediator
on the outcome do not interact, the direct effect of the exposure on the outcome is the proportion of the
population in which the exposure causes the outcome regardless of the potential distribution of the medi-
ator, and the indirect effect is the proportion of the population in which the exposure causes the mediator
and the mediator causes the outcome. In this framework, Albert (2008) develops a measure to quantify
the fraction of the overall treatment effect that is due to a mediator.
Rubin (2004) argues that, instead of allowing for the mediator and the exposure to both be implicitly
assignable and thus for the distribution of the full set of potential outcomes to be the product of the dis-
tribution of the mediator under all assignments and the distribution of the outcome under all assignments
of the mediator and the exposure, inference should focus on the distribution of the potential outcomes
"conditional" on the distribution of the mediator under all assignments (the "potential mediator"). The
values of the mediator under all assignments form prerandomization "principal strata" (Frangakis and
Rubin, 2002) within which causal estimators can be obtained. Contrasts in the potential outcomes within
strata where the values of the mediator are constant provide an estimate of the direct effect of treatment,
while contrasts in the potential outcomes within strata where the values of the mediator change provide
an estimate of the mediated effect of treatment. Gallop and others (2009) developed this suggestion in the
context of a continuous outcome assumed to be normally distributed. Here, we assume both a dichoto-
mous mediator and a dichotomous outcome, which provides a challenging problem of identifiability, as
we discuss below.
Joffe and Greene (2009) provide a comparison and contrast of the direct/indirect effect approach with
the principal stratification approach. We focus on the latter in this article, defining direct and mediated
effects in terms of intent-to-treat (ITT) effects within the principal strata of the mediators in Section 2.
Section 3 considers the structure of the likelihood and develops Bayesian estimation methods that provide
posterior distributions of causal estimates of interest under different a priori constraints on the potential
mediator distribution. Section 4 considers a specific data application, namely estimating the mediating
effect of adult poverty on the relationship between childhood poverty and risk of death. Section 5 summa-
rizes our findings and suggests future extensions of these methods. Our work provides 2 new contributions
to the causal modeling literature. First, traditional identifiability restrictions such as monotonicity or the
exclusion restriction make strong assumptions about the nature of the population. Thus, under monotonic-
ity, we assume that the exposure either has no effect or a unidirectional effect on the mediator. While this
might make sense in some settings, a more reasonable assumption might be that some principal strata
are more common than others. Here, we consider priors that restrict the orderings of the proportions of
principal strata rather than assuming they are zero. We also consider priors that do not constrain either
the principal strata or the potential outcomes in any fashion whatsoever. Second, we define a "mediated
effect" that ranges between 0 and 1 in the absence of directional interaction among the treatment effects
in the principal strata as the treatment effect ranges from direct to fully mediated.
2. DIRECT EFFECT AND MEDIATED EFFECT PRINCIPAL STRATA
In this article, we focus on the special case of a dichotomous exposure Z, dichotomous outcome Y, and
dichotomous mediator D. We denote the potential mediator values under each of the exposure assignments
by D(Z), and potential outcome values by Y(Z, D(Z)). (Because we do not allow the mediator to be ma-
nipulated independently of the treatment, Y(Z, D(Z))  Y(Z) for all Z; we use the notation Y(Z, D(Z))

whenever we are emphasizing the mediators role in the causal pathway between Y and Z.) For patients
receiving treatment Z = z, we only observe Y(Z = z, D(Z = z)) and D(Z = z); Y(Z = 1 - z, D(Z =
1 - z)) and D(Z = 1 - z) are unobserved. The joint distribution of Y(Z, D(Z)), D(Z) is a 16-cell multi-
nomial distribution given by Table 1: P(D(0) = d0, D(1) = d1, Y(0) = y0, Y(1) = y1) = i j for i = 1
if d0 = d1 = 0, i = 2 if d0 = 0, d1 = 1, i = 3 if d0 = d1 = 1, and i = 4 if d0 = 1, d1 = 0, and similarly
for j, y0, and y1. The 4 sets of values that support the distribution of D(Z) form the 4 principal strata
within which we will make inference about the potential outcomes Y(Z, D(Z)) and Y(1- Z, D(1- Z)):
D(0) = D(1) = 0; D(0) = 0, D(1) = 1; D(0) = D(1) = 1; and D(0) = 1, D(1) = 0. We refer to
these principal strata as "never mediators," "concordant mediators," "always mediators," and "discordant
mediators."
The overall causal effect (ce) of the exposure is given by the ITT effect: the contrast of the potential
outcome under Z = 1 with the potential outcome under Z = 0: D(Z)
E(Y(1, D(1)) - Y(0, D(0))) =
E(Y(1) - Y(0)) = (+2 + +3) - (+3 + +4) = +2 - +4. Our goal is to make inference about the
ITT effect within each of the mediation strata. Expanding the terminology of Frangakis and Rubin (2002)
with respect to surrogate measures, we term the contrast between potential outcomes within strata where
the exposure changes the mediator "associative effects"
E(Y(1, D(1)) - Y(0, D(0))|D(1) = D(0)) = ((22 + 42) - (24 + 44))/(2+ + 4+)
and the contrast between potential outcomes within strata where the exposure has no effect on the mediator
"disassociative effects"
E(Y(1, D(1)) - Y(0, D(0))|D(1) = D(0)) = ((12 + 32) - (14 + 34))/(1+ + 3+).
If the effect of the exposure is entirely direct, that is, unmediated through D, then,
E(Y(1, D(1)) - Y(0, D(0))|D(1) = D(0)) = E(Y(1, D(1)) - Y(0, D(0))|D(1) = D(0))
= E(Y(1) - Y(0)),
thus,
((22 + 42) - (24 + 44))/(2+ + 4+) = ((12 + 32) - (14 + 34))/(1+ + 3+) = +2 - +4
or ae = de = ce. If the effect of the exposure is entirely mediated through D, that is, there is no direct
effect of Z on Y, then,
E(Y(1, D(1)) - Y(0, D(0))|D(1) = D(0)) = 0; E(Y(1, D(1)) - Y(0, D(0))|D(1) = D(0))
=
E(Y(1) - Y(0))
P(D(1) = D(0))
Bayesian inference for causal mediation effects 357
or ae = +2-+4
2++4+
and de = 0. Thus, we construct a mediated effect measure
me =
ae - (+2 - +4)
+2-+4
2++4+
- (+2 - +4)
=
22+42-(24+44)
+2-+4
- (2+ + 4+)
1 - (2+ + 4+)
.
The intuition behind me is that it will vary from 0 when the effect of treatment Z is entirely direct
(in which case ae = +2 - +4) to 1 when the effect of Z is entirely mediated through D (in which
case 22+42-(24+44)
+2-+4
= 1). Although me is technically unbounded, we feel that this measure captures
the concept of mediation and direct effect in most settings since situations where me is less than 0 or
greater than 1 are somewhat pathological. Thus, me < 0 if the ITT effect in the associative strata is
smaller than the ITT effect in the disassociative strata--which implies in our poverty example that the ef-
fect of childhood poverty on risk of death being stronger when childhood poverty has no impact on adult
poverty than when it does--and me > 1 if disassociative effect is negative--which implies that childhood
poverty is "protective" when it has no impact on adult poverty.
Throughout the remainder of this article, we assume that the exposure Z is assigned at random, so
that P(Z, D(0), D(1), Y(0, D(0)), Y(1, D(1)) = P(Z). Hence, the joint distribution of the potential
outcomes and potential mediators is independent of treatment assignment, and we avoid the need to di-
rectly model the assignment of the treatment Z (Rubin 1978). We also make the stable unit treatment
value assumption (SUTVA; Rubin, 1990) that the assignment of a given subject to treatment Zi = z is
independent of the joint potential outcomes of (Dj (0), Dj (1), Yj (0), Yj (1)) for j = i.
2.1 Monotonicity assumption
A common assumption, plausible in many settings, is "monotonicity": D(0) D(1); this implies no
discordant mediators or 4+ = 0. In the context of the mediating effect of adult poverty on child-
hood poverty, the no defier assumption implies that no one would experience adult poverty as a con-
sequence of having avoided childhood poverty. If we make the monotonicity assumption for the outcome
Y(0, D(0)) Y(1, D(1)) as well, that is, there are no "discordant" outcomes (where a subject does worse
under a treatment that is designed to help or vice versa), we have +4 = 0 as well. Hirano and others
(2000) considered a similar model under the further restriction that either 12 = 0 (exclusion restriction
in the never mediators) and/or 32 = 0 (exclusion restriction in the always mediators).
Under the monotonicity assumption, the associative effect reduces to
ae = E(Y(1, D(1)) - Y(0, D(0))|D(1) = D(0)) = 22/2+
and the disassociative effect to
de = E(Y(1, D(1)) - Y(0, D(0))|D(1) = D(0)) = (12 + 32)/(1+ + 3+).
The mediated effect measure reduces to
me =
22/2+ - +2
+2/2+ - +2
=
22/+2 - 2+
1 - 2+
.
Note that ae, de, and me all have an upper bound of 1 under monotonicity since 22 2+
, 12 + 32
1+ + 3+
, and the dissasociative effect is constrained to be nonnegative.

3.1 Under the monotonicity assumption
We observe D(Z = z) and Y(Z = z) only for the actual treatment assignment Z = z. Hence, the
contingency table for observed data is given in Table 2 along with the complete data parameters for each
observed data cell. The observed data likelihood is given by

Because the quantities with unique MLEs converge in probability to their true values, the asymptotic
boundaries of the remaining MLEs are given by replacing the point estimates with their true values.
In small samples, the boundaries will be highly variable; as sample size increases, the boundaries will
converge toward their asymptotic limit, with the likelihood decreasing more rapidly beyond the boundary
point. To illustrate this, we consider a scenario with equally likely never, concordant, and always mediators
in which the effect of the treatment is entirely through the mediator: 11 = 1/5, 12 = 0, 13 = 2/15,
21 = 0, 22 = 1/3, 23 = 0, 31 = 2/15, 32 = 0, and 33 = 1/5. Figure 1 illustrates the profile
likelihood for 22 for 3 samples: n = 100, n = 500, and n = 2500. (The profile likelihood is obtained
by fixing 22 at a given value, maximizing the remaining values using an expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm, and computing the likelihood at the fixed 22 and the maximized values of the remaining i j ;
see Appendix B.)
Although some recent work has taken on the challenge for developing frequentist theory for situations
in which likelihoods are flat (e.g. Romano and Shaikh, 2008), standard asymptotic methods for point
estimation and interval construction do not apply. Thus, we turn to Bayesian methods to describe the

3.2 Relaxing the monotonicity assumption
Allowing for "discordant" mediators and outcomes, the observed data likelihood becomes

Unlike the monotonicity setting, there are no identifiable estimates of any of the parameters governing
either the joint distribution or marginal distributions of D(0), D(1), and Y(0, D(0)), Y(1, D(1)). There
are boundary conditions on the MLEs, however. In particular, the boundary conditions for ae are

3.3 Stochastic monotonicity assumption
We also consider a restricted prior that constrains 2+ 4+
and j2 j4 for j = 1, 2, 3, requiring
that the fraction of "concordant" mediators be greater than the fraction of "discordant" mediators, and
that, within all the principal strata except for the discordant, that the fraction of "concordant" outcomes
be greater than the fraction of "discordant" outcomes. We term this prior "stochastic monotonicity." The
constraint is imposed in the Gibbs sampling process by rejecting all draws from the conditional posterior

 that do not meet the constraint. Implicit in this prior is that the directionality of the treatment,
mediator, and outcome have been "lined up," so that Z = 1, D = 1, and Y = 1 are consistent with a risk
factors and poor outcomes, or protective treatments and good outcomes. This prior implies an upper limit
of 1 for the mediated effect me since negative disassociative effects are no longer possible.
Closed-form solutions for the MLE boundaries for the ae, de, and me can no longer be obtained; linear
programming methods may be used instead (Balke and Pearl, 1997).
4. APPLICATION: MEDIATING EFFECTS OF ADULT POVERTY ON RISK OF DEATH DUE TO
CHILDHOOD POVERTY
The Alameda County Study is a stratified random sample survey of households living in Alameda County
in California (Breslow and Kaplan, 1965). The purpose of the survey was to explore the influence of
health practices and social relationships on the physical and mental health of a representative sample of
the Alameda County population. Information was obtained for 6928 respondents covering chronic health
conditions, health behaviors, social involvement, and psychological characteristics. Questions were asked
on marital and life satisfaction, parenting, physical activities, employment, and childhood experiences.
Demographic variables on age, race, height, weight, education, income, and religion are also included.
In particular, poverty during childhood and poverty at the time of the 1965 interview are ascertained.
Respondents were followed and survival status noted for 3352 respondents in 2000. Survival status by
childhood poverty status and adult poverty status is shown in Table 3: 28% of children not in poverty were
adults in poverty, and 44% of children in poverty were also adults in poverty.
It could be argued that childhood poverty is a largely randomized variable in that children do not
choose their poverty status but are in some sense "randomly" assigned at birth; alternatively, an analysis
could be conducted that controlled for confounders, such as size of family, parent's martial status, or
other factors associated with childhood poverty that one might wish to separate from the pure effect of
poverty by using a preliminary propensity score adjustment (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983). Here, we
use propensity scores to restore balance with respect to gender, age, and race between those in poverty
and those not in poverty during childhood. We include a linear and quadratic term for age and a dummy
variable for race (white, African-American, and other) to account for the fact that older persons were more
likely to experience childhood poverty than younger persons, and African-Americans more likely and
those of other races less likely to experience childhood poverty. Because of the extraordinary imbalance
with respect to race among those in childhood poverty, African-Americans remain more likely to be in
childhood poverty than whites, although the difference is substantially reduced (see Table 4).

First, we conduct an analysis of the form that Baron and Kenny (1986) proposed. Children in poverty
are more likely to be in poverty as adults than children not in poverty (OR = 2.00, 95% CI 1.72, 2.32),
showing an association between the exposure and potential mediator. The unadjusted odds ratio of death
for persons in childhood poverty is 1.50 (95% CI 1.26, 1.79); adjusting for adult poverty reduces this
association only slightly (OR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.20, 1.71), suggesting that most of the effect of childhood
poverty on risk of death is direct and not mediated by the increased risk of being in adult poverty. Adjusting
for gender, age, and race reduces the overall effect of childhood poverty on risk of death (OR = 1.20,
95% CI 0.99, 1.45) and suggests a partial degree of mediation through adult poverty among this remaining
effect (OR = 1.13, 95% CI 0.93, 1.37).
Next, we conduct an analysis considering the associative, disassociative, and mediated effects uncon-
strained under the stochastic monotonicity assumption and under the deterministic monotonicity assump-
tion. Table 5 shows the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles for the associative, disassociative, and mediated
effects along with the fraction of the population that is estimated to be in each of the mediator princi-
pal strata, unadjusted and adjusted for age and race using the propensity scores described above. The
propensity score­adjusted analysis was conducted by stratifying the data by propensity score quintile and
running separate Markov chain Monte Carlo chains within each stratum. A draw from the posterior of 

 is
obtained as the weighted average of draws from each of the 5 propensity strata, weighted in proportion to
the fraction of the sample contained in each (approximate) quintile. MLE boundaries under the stochastic
monotonicity assumption are obtained using the linear programming package simplex in R (R Version
2.8.0, The R Foundation for Statistical Computing).
Allowing for nonmonotonicity suggests that about 40% of the population (95% CI 35­45%) is im-
mune to adult poverty (never mediators), 30% (95% CI 26­36%) are protected against adult poverty by
not experiencing childhood poverty (concordant mediators), 15% (95% CI 11­19%) are doomed to adult
poverty (always mediators), and 15% (95% CI 10­18%) experience adult poverty only if they do not ex-
perience childhood poverty (discordant mediators). The associative effect (0.076, 95% CI -0.094, 0.237)
and disassociative effects (0.054, 95% CI -0.074, 0.179) are approximately equal, with no strong evi-
dence of mediation effects (0.16, 95% CI -1.86, 2.28), although the possibility cannot be discounted due
to wide credible intervals. Constraining the prior decreases the posterior median of the associative effect
(0.057, 95% CI -0.026, 0.153) and increases the posterior median of the disassociative effect (0.076, 95%
CI 0.021, 0.161), suggesting rather counterintuitively that the effect of childhood poverty on survival is ac-
tually stronger when there is no impact on adult poverty than when there is. Balancing on age and race via
the propensity score analysis moves the posterior median of the associative effect toward zero--reflecting
that part of the childhood poverty effect is confounded with the age and race of the respondents--and
reduces the width of the posterior intervals. For comparison purposes, the overall effect of death on child-
hood poverty is 6.4 percentage points, and the age/race/sex­adjusted effect is 2.6 percentage points.
Assuming monotonicity suggests that the fraction of never mediators is 54% (95% CI 51­56%), of
concordant mediators is 18% (95% CI 15­21%), and of always mediators is 28% (95% CI 27­30%).
The disassociative effect is centered near the point estimate for the overall effect of childhood poverty

(0.056, 95% CI 0.019, 0.093). The associative effect is generally centered near 0(0.125, 95% CI 0.010,
0.330), although the possibility of a substantial associative effect suggesting mediation through adult
poverty cannot be entirely ruled out. Assuming monotonicity has little effect on the posterior median
for the mediation effect but does shrink the posterior intervals for the mediation effects substantially.
Balancing on age and race has little impact on the point estimates under monotonicity but substantially
reduces the width of the credible intervals.
Figure 2 shows the posterior distributions of ae, de, and me adjusting for age, race, and gender under
the 3 prior assumptions considered.
In sum, allowing for the possibility that some persons can somehow be "inoculated" against adult
poverty by the experience of childhood poverty suggests that the effect of childhood poverty on risk of
death is largely direct and not mediated through the experience of adult poverty caused by childhood
poverty. Assuming monotonicity--that there are no persons who experience adult poverty if and only if
they do not experience childhood poverty--provides very modest evidence that the increased risk of death
among persons experiencing childhood poverty is partly mediated through adult poverty. Standard regres-
sion methods applied to this data yield results consistent with the results obtained under monotonicity,
although the data suggest that a modest fraction of the population may indeed by inoculated.

5. DISCUSSION
Standard regression approaches to mediation such as Baron and Kenny (1986) lack causal interpreta-
tion due to potential unobserved confounding even when treatment is randomized because mediator is
observed postrandomization. Use of principal strata defined using the counterfactual distribution of the
mediators creates a conceptual prerandomization variable. In particular, a dissassociative effect of treat-
ment can be estimated as the ITT effect among subjects for whom the mediator does not change under
different treatment assignments, and similarly an associative effect can be estimated as the ITT effect
among subjects for whom the mediator does change under different treatment assignments. A mediated
effect can then be constructed by considering the value of the disassociative and associative effects when
the overall treatment effect is entirely direct versus completely mediated.
In the setting we consider here--dichotomous mediators and treatments--lack of identifiability sug-
gests use of Bayesian inference. Posterior distributions of ITT effects within principal strata are informed
by the data since boundary conditions are imposed on the counterfactual distribution. In general, principal
stratum inference is consistent with standard regression analysis when counterfactual correlation between
mediator and outcome is large (small) when mediation is present (absent). Principal stratum inference
analysis protects against inappropriate inference when counterfactual correlation is small (large) when me-
diation is present (absent) (see simulation studies available at http://www.sph.umich.edu/mrelliot/causal
/med-bios2.pdf). The Bayesian approach also allow us to incorporate constraints such as monotonicity or
a relaxed stochastic monotonicity.
The methods developed here assume unconfounded treatment assignment Z. This assumption is very
strong in many observational studies, although occasionally treatments of interest might appear in the
Bayesian inference for causal mediation effects 365
form of instrumental variables, such as changes in laws that might affect mediating behaviors but would
be independent of the joint distribution of the potential outcomes. In general, we propose using propensity
scores to balance on observed covariates.
A reviewer raised the issue of whether differences between the results of a standard regression anal-
ysis of mediation effects and the results of an analysis using principal stratification to account for pos-
trandomization selection bias have implications for study design, above and beyond the need to obtain
unconfounded treatment assignment to start with. While Hudgens and Gilbert (2009) considered power
and sample designs in the surrogacy setting, they did so under conditions sufficiently restrictive to obtain
consistent estimators. In our setting, with flat likelihoods, sensible sample size calculations could focus
on determination of interval widths under a variety of plausible assumptions about direct and mediating
mechanisms. It is less clear to us now we might make use of observed discrepancies between the principal
stratum and the standard regression approaches in designing further studies; however, we may be overly
pessimistic in this assessment, and look forward to others' consideration of this question.
Many extensions of this work are possible. A variety of different prior constraints could be considered:
for example, we might retain monotonicity for the outcome but relax it in some fashion for the mediator
or vice versa. Baseline covariates that allow prediction of principal stratification status can be useful in
sharpening inference. In the noncompliance setting, where much of the mediation analysis using principal
strata has focused, few practical predictors of compliance have been found. In more general applications,
such as the one considered here, searches for predictors of principal stratification status may prove more
fruitful.

Boundary conditions for linear combinations of the latent cell probabilities can be obtained using
linear programming methods (Balke and Pearl, 1997). However, because all the components in the linear
combination of i j that make up the associative effect are in MLE equations with no common elements, we
can obtain the upper and lower bounds for the MLE of ae by replacing the parameters with the appropriate
lower or upper bounds to maximize or minimize ae:

where ^
li j and ^

i j , and equivalently ^
li+
and ^

correspond to the lower and upper MLE limits for ^
i+
, and ^
l+ j and ^
u+ j to the lower and upper MLE
limits for ^

Similar derivations provide the unconstrained MLE bounds for de and me.
APPENDIX B: COMPUTING A PROFILE LIKELIHOOD FOR i j
A profile likelihood can be computed for any i j using an EM algorithm. We describe the example
for 22 under monotonicity. Let the complete data consist of the number of subjects mz
i j
, where z in-
dexes the treatment assignment and i and j correspond to the indices defined for the counterfactual
values of D(0), D(1), and Y(0), Y(1) in Section 2 (see Table B.1). The complete data likelihood is

APPENDIX C: BAYESIAN INFERENCE FOR DIRECT AND MEDIATED EFFECTS
C.1 Under monotonicity
The complete data is given by the cell counts mz
i j
, where z indexes the treatment assignment and i and j
correspond to the indices defined for the counterfactual values of D(0), D(1) and Y(0), Y(1) in Section
2. Under randomization and SUTVA, we have m
m
mz  MULTI(nz; 11, . . . , 33), so the data augmentation
step is given by draws from the multinomial distribution:

,
32
(22 + 23 + 32 + 33)

.
We also have m0
33 = n0
11
and m1
00 = n1
00
.
Because the likelihood is flat in a variety of regions of interest in the parameter space, the results will
be highly sensitive to the choice of the prior distribution, even in large samples. A formal reference prior
for cell probabilities in multinomial distributions was provided in Bernardo, in discussion of Kass (1989),
as
p(1, . . . , m) 
m-1
k=1


-1/2
i

1 -
k
j=1
j


-1/2


 .
Using simulation studies, we found that the repeated sampling properties of this prior to be less than
ideal; instead, using a Dirichlet prior with parameters equal to 1--the equivalent of a uniform prior on the
multinomial parameters under the constraint that the probabilities sum to 1--gave results that had better
asymptotic coverage properties. Consequently, we draw 

 conditional on the previous draw of m from
DIRICHLET(m0
11 + m1
11 + 1, . . . , m0
33 + m1
33 + 1).
