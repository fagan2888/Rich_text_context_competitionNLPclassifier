Abstract. Human observers group local shading patterns into global super-patterns that appear to
be illuminated in some unitary fashion. Many years ago, this was noticed for the case of uniform,
unidirectional illumination. Recently, we found that it also applies to convergent and divergent
illumination flows, but that human observers are blind to rotational light flow patterns (in the sense
of being unable to group the local shading patterns). We now report that human observers are also
blind to deformation patterns. This is perhaps interesting because convergent, divergent, rotational,
and deformation patterns all occur in natural light fields. This is an idiosyncrasy of the human visual
system, on par with the fact that visual awareness fails to present the observer with saddle shapes.
Keywords: shading, light fields, ambiguity, grouping, depth, shape.
1 Introduction
The conventional stimulus(1) in shape from shading research for about a century has been a circular
disk filled with a linear intensity gradient (Metzger, 1975; Ramachandran, 1988a, 1988b). It repre-
sents most likely an attempt to catch the essential information in shading patterns, which is supposed
to be the first-order intensity variation in a small neighborhood about a point (Turhan, 1935). The
result is somewhat troublesome, because of the effect of supposedly irrelevant factors. For instance,
not just the intensity gradient determines the resulting perception, the circular outline is just as
important (a square outline yields a very different perception; Wagemans, van Doorn, & Koender-
ink, 2010). However, this basic pattern has been adopted in a large volume of research, which is the
reason why we used it in the present study (Figure 1).
Most observers report that the basic stimulus appears to them as a pictorial relief, modulated
in depth. A small group of observers sees a flat intensity gradient (we are not in a position to put a
number on this, from our experience, we would guess at least one out of ten). Observers who report a
depth articulation declare to see either a "cap" (convexity, like the outside of an eggshell) or a "cup"
(1) We say "conventional stimulus," because this is the stimulus that pervades the literature on "shape from
shading" from the earliest times on. There is no doubt it was (and is) used because conceived of as "the minimal
stimulus". However, this it is not. The conventional stimulus is made up of a localized linear gradient (which
indeed might count as a "minimal stimulus") and a circular disk with a sharp edge. The edge typically accounts for
much of the shape impressions evoked by the stimulus. For instance, changing it to a square evokes a cylindrical,
instead of spherical shape, and changing it to triangular induces a conical shape. The true "minimal" stimulus
would be a localized gradient in the appropriate formal sense (scale space; Koenderink, 1984), thus an intensity
distribution modulated with the first derivative of a symmetric Gaussian function. It is hardly ever used although
because the edge is so important in inducing a phenomenal three-dimensional shape impression (Erens, Kappers,
& Koenderink, 1993), that is to say, because of the mixed nature of the conventional stimulus.

(concavity, like the inside of an eggshell). The depth ambiguity has been familiar for a long time (Rit-
tenhouse, 1786). As we have argued elsewhere, the fact that only caps or cups are reported is perhaps
surprising, since inverse optics shows that cylinders (either convex or concave) and saddle shapes are
equally valid interpretations. Here "valid" refers to "Shape From Shading" (SFS) theory, based on
standard radiometry (Boyd, 1983; Lambert, 1760; Moon & Spencer, 1981). SFS has a large literature;
we mention only Belhumeur, Kriegman, & Yuille (1999), Forsyth & Ponce (2002), Horn & Brooks
(1989), van 
Diggelen (1959), From a Bayesian viewpoint, saddles should be the preferred interpreta-
tion (Koenderink & van Doorn, 2003b). Whereas cylinders are indeed reported for a square outline,
saddle shapes are (in our experience) never spontaneously reported. The "cap or cup" decision is often
determined by the direction of the gradient, which is possibly interpreted as the direction of illumina-
tion in the "scene".
It is well known that a group of such basic stimulus patterns tends to "synchronize" (Kleffner &
Ramachandran 1992). That is to say, when you view a group of such stimuli with gradient directions all
lined up, one tends to be aware of a group of all caps or all cups (Figure 2, left). If there is an outlier in a
flock of caps, it is often reported as a cup and vice versa (Figure 2, second from the left). This finding is
also related to the work on the perception of light flow direction (Koenderink & Pont 2003; Koenderink
and van Doorn, 1996; Koenderink, van Doorn, & Pont, 2004; Koenderink, van Doorn, Kappers, te Pas,
& Pont, 2003; Koenderink, Pont, van Doorn, Kappers, & Todd, 2007; Pont & Koenderink, 2003, 2004).
In the Appendix, we explain the concept of "light field" and "surface illuminance flow" in some detail.
Roughly speaking, the "light field" describes the transport of radiant power, whereas the "surface illu-
minance flow" describes the aspect of the illumination that photometrically reveals the roughness of the
illuminated surface.
Recently, we have found (van Doorn, Koenderink, & Wagemans, 2011) that this "synchroniza-
tion" (a kind of "grouping") also occurs for divergent and convergent illuminance flows (Figure 2,
third from left) but not for rotational illuminance flows (Figure 2, right). This is interesting, because
all first-order singularities of the illuminance flow field (i.e., divergence, rotational, and deformation
fields) occur in the daily environment (Mury, Pont, & Koenderink, 2007, 2009a, 2009b). Thus, the
apparent selective sensitivity appears perhaps surprising. In any case, it is a nontrivial property of the

structures in human visual awareness. The stimuli shown in Figure 2 may be understood as abstrac-
tions from naturally occurring patterns, rendered suitable for a structured empirical investigation.
In Figure 3, we show the basis for the linear (local) approximation of illuminance flow fields.
The zeroth-order, unidirectional, uniform field can be locally deformed by linear combinations of
these four patterns. When the uniform flow vanishes, at singular points of the illuminance flow field,
one generically has a purely linear flow pattern. All these components occur in the natural environ-
ment. Thus, it makes sense to find out whether deformation patterns can group (like divergent pat-
terns) or not (like rotational patterns).
In this paper, we test whether human observers are able to group deformation patterns as they do
uniform or divergent patterns or whether they are blind to these as they are to cyclic (rotational) pat-
terns.
2 Methods
2.1
Observers
Observers AD, JK, JT, and JW were the authors, whereas EG, MS, RK, and SC were naive to the
issue. We do not consider the addition of a group of naive observers to be essential, because we are
interested in a possible form of selective blindness. If a group of experienced observers turns out to
be unable to group deformation patterns, it is hard to imagine why this would be different for naive
observers. Moreover, the advantage of the experienced observers is that they are very well docu-
mented as observers in various subdomains of visual perception. Three (AD, JK, and JW) were also
observers in a previous, related study (van Doorn et al., 2011). One (JT) has a known tendency to re-
port only "caps" (never "cups") when confronted with the conventional stimulus pattern. As it turned
out to be the case (see Results), both groups of observers yielded equivalent results.
2.2
Stimulus design
The stimulus design was similar to that used in an experiment upon which we have reported before
(van Doorn et al., 2011). The only difference is the number of basic stimulus patterns placed on the
annulus (Figure 4), which is eight in the present and six in the previous experiment. The number is
important, because the deformation stimuli cannot be represented very well using only six samples,
whereas eight samples suffice.

as a linear combination of these components. At top left one has a divergence, at top right a rotation, in the bottom
row, two mutually independent deformation patterns. The divergence and rotation are specified by magnitude
alone, the deformations also have an orientation.

3 Experiments
We report on two related experiments. Both potentially yield an answer to our research question,

although the second experiment perhaps allows some additional conclusions.
3.1
Simultaneous task
In the "simultaneous task," we presented stimulus patterns like those shown in Figure 4, randomly
rotated over some multiple of 45º. The observer fixated the red cross, then was presented with the
pattern for 2 s, after which the observer had to indicate whether the eight patterns were either
· all caps,
· all cups,
· not all the same.
This is a simple, overall decision. When all subpatterns are either cup or cap, the whole pattern
looks like it was made of one piece, it becomes a single Gestalt.
The patterns were presented on a computer screen. The background gray disk was 15 cm in
Figure 4. Left, The stimulus patterns used in the experiment. At top left a uniform field, at top right a random field
(of course this is just one instance, all instances are different). The bottom row shows two deformation fields with
different orientations. The red cross is used for fixation. Right, the same patterns, but shading gradient indicated
with arrows.
Figure 5. The presentation sequence for the simultaneous task. Each trial starts with a blank plus fixation mark.
This enables the observer to fixate the red mark. The observer initiates the next presentation, which presents the
stimulus pattern for 2 s. In the next phase, the blank pattern is on until the observer has responded. The response
indicates a triadic judgment: all caps, all cups, or mixed.

diameter and binocularly viewed from 50 cm. Room lights were dimmed. The trials were self-paced
by the observers (See Figure 5.)
Observers were tested with 500 presentations in all (1,000 AD, JK, JT, and JW), equally distrib-
uted over uniform, random, and deformation fields, in random order. In the case, the observer felt
fully uncertain, the trial could be dumped, and another one initiated. This happened in not more than
about one in 100 cases. Overall, all observers judged the task as "easy but dull". All but one observ-
ers completed the task in one session, observer JW needed two sessions.
For the uniform patterns, we checked how the all cap/cup report correlated with the direction of
the gradient (Figure 6). We find the expected pattern for the observers. Outlier is observer JT, who
(as we knew) will never report all cups. The remaining observers have a strong but idiosyncratic
preference for cap over cup.
3.1.1
Conclusions simultaneous task
The results of responding "caps", "cups", or "different" are shown as a triangle plot in Figure 7. One
has to judge whether the deformation results are more like the random or the uniform results. The
answer is immediately obvious. The result for the deformation patterns is like that for the random
patterns, and very different from that for the uniform patterns.
The conclusion is that human observers fail to group deformation into a single Gestalt. The

direction of the gradient. The concentric areas show the quartiles over all observers. Notice the decided preference
for cap over cup. At right, the plot for observer JT. This observer is special in that he never reports awareness of
all cups.

areas show the 95% and 50% probability areas, the dots show individual cases. The bluish area corresponds to the
uniform pattern, the reddish area to the random patterns, whereas the yellowish area represents the deformation
patterns. Conclusion is that the results for the deformation patterns resemble those for the random, rather than the
uniform patterns.
472 van Doorn et al.
deformation patterns look qualitatively different from the uniform patterns (and, to the three ob-
servers who participated in an earlier experiment, to the convergence or divergence patterns). They
look more like the random patterns (and again, to the three observers who participated in an earlier
experiment, to the rotation patterns).
3.2
Successive task
In the "successive task," we again presented stimulus patterns like those shown in Figure 4. The ob-
server fixated the red cross and was then presented with the pattern for 1 s. After this, there came two
successive periods of half a second each. In each period, one subpattern was indicated with an easily
visible dot. For the first period, the dot was red; for the second, it was blue. In this task, the observer
has to indicate, for both the first and the second interval, whether the indicated subpattern was judged
to be a cap or a cup. Thus, there are four possible responses, namely cap-cap, cup-cup, cap-cup or
cup-cap. In the former two cases, the two partial responses are correlated; in the latter two cases,
they are anti-correlated. (See Figure 8.)
The timing of the presentations is important. Naive observers initially tend to complain that the
presentation is fast, although they evidently are able to handle it. Experienced observers sometimes
complain of the slowness of the presentations because they notice occasional cap-cup or cup-cap
flips which interfere with the task. The timing that we eventually settled on is somewhat of a com-
promise. The temporal intervals were chosen such that it is unlikely that the second fiducial would
have flipped with respect to its appearance during the indication of the first fiducial. We could draw
on our previous experience here. The probability of a flip is less than a percent or so.
The patterns were presented on a computer screen. They were again 15 cm in diameter and bin-
ocularly viewed from 50 cm. Room lights were dimmed. The trials were self-paced by the observers.
Again, random, uniform, and deformation patterns were generated with equal probability. They were
randomly rotated over multiples of 45º. We used a total of 500 presentations (1,000 for AD, JK, JT,
and JW). This task is rather more difficult than the simultaneous task. In a few percent of cases, the
observer failed to see the first or second indication. Such cases could be discarded, and an additional
trial generated.
In the case of observer JT, who never reports to be aware of cups, the "cup" judgment was
replaced with a "not cap" judgment. Judging from the results, this at least partly succeeded. At least
the random and deformation cases are evidently distinct from the uniform case. Observer JT reports
to be aware of pictorial relief; he apparently does not merely respond to the gradient directions. In
the case of caps, these appear as convincingly three-dimensional; in the case of cups, these are "less
convincing" and might as well be interpreted as planar gradients.
What is interesting from a phenomenological viewpoint is that the observers apparently used the
relief appearance, rather than the (two-dimensional) gradient representation. It happens occasionally
that one is aware of a cap-cap event, whereas (in reflective afterthought) one notices that the gradi-
ents were opposite. In such (rare) cases, the microgenetic process possibly assumed different local
illumination directions for the first and second fiducial subpattern.
From the results, we may compute autocorrelation functions (see Figure 9). These specify pre-
cisely how seeing cap or cup at the second presentation depends upon cap or cup at the first presenta-
Figure 8. The sequence of presentations in a trial of the successive task. The trial starts with a blank plus fixation
mark, enabling the observer to fixate. The observer initiates the following three presentations. First the stimulus
pattern is presented for 1 s. Then, follow two one-half-second presentations in which the fiducial patterns are
identified: the first through a red, the second through a blue dot. The fourth presentation is blank again. It ends
when the observer has responded. The response involves a cap-cup decision for the first (red) pattern and one for
the second (blue pattern). Thus, possible responses are cap-cap, cap-cup, cup-cap, and cup-cup.

tion, as a function of the angular separation of the subpatterns.
3.2.1Conclusions successive task
The results from the successive task are--at the expense of some hard labor--much more detailed
than those of the simultaneous task. A cursory glance shows that the deformation case is much like
the random and very much unlike the uniform case. Thus, the conclusion that human observers
appear to be blind to the deformation patterns is immediate, without the need for any significance
testing.
Of course, one has certain predictions. In the case of the uniform pattern, we expect the appear-
ance to be either all caps or all cups. Thus, one expects the autocorrelation function to be equal to
one (perfect correlation) for all angular separations. This expectation is borne out to a surprising
extent.
For the random case, one expects (of course) the correlation to be perfect if the angular separa-
tion is zero. Anything less would imply cap-cup flips within a half-second interval. This is pretty
much borne out. One also expects correlations for non-zero angular intervals to be essentially (within
the random scatter) zero. Perhaps surprisingly, this is not borne out. Except for observer JT, who fails
to report cups in any case, observers tend to (minor) anti-correlation, except for the smallest angular
separations, for which there is a (minor) tendency to positive correlation. We do not understand these
(minor) trends, which are evidently systematic.
For the deformation case, one expects (in case grouping would fail to pertain) antipodes (around
180 angular separation) to anti-correlate separations of plus or minus ninety degrees not to correlate
at all. Except for the (special) case of observer JT, this appears to be borne out by the data. However,
the difference with the random case (which we fail to fully understand) is only slight, so we can
hardly conclude otherwise than that the deformation case is very much like the random one.
Figure 9. At top, the median autocorrelation functions for all observers except JT and the three stimuli (from left
to right: uniform, random, and deformation). The error bars indicate the interquartile ranges. The correlations
specify how the judgment at the second location depends on that at the first location, as a function of the angular
distance between the locations. (notice that the outermost positions are repeats of the opposite location.) Yellow
indicates positive, blue negative (anti-) correlation. The dashed red lines indicate naive predictions. At bottom,
the autocorrelation functions for observer JT (the 95% significance intervals are indicated in red). This observer
evidently shows a different pattern. JT's results for the uniform patterns are not different from those for the other
observers. His results for the random and deformation patterns are different but do not contradict our overall
conclusions.

4 Overall conclusions
The overall conclusion from these experiments is clear-cut: human observers do not group deforma-
tion patterns like they do uniform, convergent or divergent ones. We have not been able to robustly
differentiate the results for the deformation patterns from the results of the random patterns. They are
categorically different from the results for the uniform patterns though. Thus, the research question
posed at the initiation of the experiments has been definitively answered.
There remain interesting unanswered questions. For instance, it is unclear how the anti-corre-
lations for non-zero angular separations in the random case arise. We guess that this has to do with
local grouping processes (for angular separations of less than half the annulus) that mutually com-
pete to settle the global grouping. The "grouping" seems to be accompanied by an "anti-grouping".
We have met similar effects in a previous experiment for the case of rotations. This appears to be a
worthy target for experiments yielding more detailed data. Such experiments are not likely to be easy
though in view of the fact that it took several decades to move from preliminary qualitative observa-
tions to detailed quantitative data. There is clearly more detail to be probed. For instance, our observ-
ers occasionally spontaneously noticed a dissociation between pictorial relief (cap-cup distinction)
and visual field (gradient direction) properties. It might be possible to probe this.
A side issue, which is nevertheless of interest, is the difference between observer JT and the
others. All observers are aware of compellingly three-dimensional caps, but whereas all but one
observer are also aware of equally compelling cups, observer JT is not. Whereas the "cups" are obvi-
ously "non-caps" (which is why JT was able to complete the experiment), they are not compelling
as three-dimensional objects but might as well be described as planar figures. In the past, we have
encountered similar observers, as well as observers who failed to see any conventional stimulus as
convincingly three-dimensional. In two cases, we met with reviewers who declared that they failed
to "get the illusion", meaning that they were not visually aware of caps or cups. Apparently, one may
distinguish among various groups of distinct observers. There appears to be no literature on the is-
sue; it seems a potentially rewarding research topic.
In conclusion, the human visual system appears to be idiosyncratic in that it easily groups
unidirectional, convergent, and divergent illuminance flow patterns but fully ignores rotational and
deformation patterns. This is the case even though the first-order patterns all occur in the natural en-
vironment (Mury et al., 2007, 2009b). This "selective blindness" is reminiscent of the inability to be
visually aware of the conventional stimulus pattern as anything else but cap or cup (Wagemans et al.,
2010). In the case of surface illuminance flow (Pont & Koenderink 2003, 2004), we actually know
that the saddles which are ignored are actually more abundant in the natural environment than the
caps and cups taken together (Koenderink & van Doorn, 2003b). To understand such idiosyncrasies,
one will need to study the affordances of these patterns in further detail than has been attempted so
far. Perhaps insights from the arts, rather than from classical physics will prove useful there (Baxan-
dall, 2005; Jacobs, 1988; Luckiesh, 1916; Koenderink & van Doorn, 2003a).

Figure A1. Examples of light fields. At left, the field due to a diffusely radiating plane (e.g., a window with
diffusing screen), indicated with the red bar, at right two opposite, otherwise identical radiating planes. The black
regions are in shadow (we assume that the surfaces radiate only into a single half-space.). Notice that--unlike
"light rays"--the field lines of the light field are generically curved. (They can even form closed loops.) They
indicate the average direction of transport of radiant power. In the right figure, a deformation singularity is formed
at the center (indicated with the blue point), where the two irradiation directions "collide head on". The light
vector vanishes at that point, although the volume density of radiation is high. It lacks direction though.
Appendix: "Surface Irradiance Flow"
Chiaroscuro is mainly due to the radiation scattered by surfaces in the scene. In an "ideal" scene, all
objects have been painted a matte white ("Lambertian BRDF"; Lambert, 1760). Such scenes have
been used by photographers (Hunter & Fuqua, 1990), to learn lighting, and by visual artists (using
plaster models), to learn "shading" (Jacobs, 1988). In an ideal image of such a scene, the sources of
radiation are not included. Such cases virtually never occur in real life, but they are a good approxi-
mation modulo a variety of "special effects" like object color, specularities (highlights), translucen-
cies, reflexes, vignetting, air light, and so forth (Jacobs, 1988).
The ideal case will do fine for this appendix. We mention only basic facts. These are, as a mat-
ter of course, thoroughly understood by anyone working on the psychophysics of shading and light
fields, which is why we put them in an appendix. We do not pretend to discuss anything novel.
For a collimated source, the radiance scattered to the eye is proportional to the irradiance of the
scattering surface element, which is again proportional to the normal irradiance caused by the incident
beam, and the obliqueness of the surface element with respect to the source ("Lambert's cosine law";
Lambert, 1760). The normal irradiance caused by the incident beam is proportional to the radiance of
the source and (for a smallish source) the solid angle subtended by the source as seen from the surface
element (Horn & Brooks 1989; Moon & Spencer 1981). These facts are sufficient to determine the
"shading", for instance, to compute a computer graphics rendering (Foley, van Dam, Feiner, & Hughes,
1990).
Shading proper is the radiance scattered to the eye by surface elements in the scene. The notion of
"surface element'' needs to be made more precise though. For instance, a roughly plastered wall has
surface elements that all have the spatial orientation of the wall itself, but on a finer scale, one becomes
aware of a random distribution of spatial attitudes that we will denote "microfacets" (Koenderink &
van Doorn, 1996). These microfacets are variously shaded, according to their spatial attitudes, and
give rise to shading texture (Koenderink & Pont 2003; Koenderink & van Doorn 1996). Such texture
is categorically different from the "wall paper texture'' due to spatial albedo variations. The shading
proper is a local average over a sample of many texture elements. The structure of the texture depends
upon the direction of the irradiating beam, that is, on the tangential (surface) component of the irradia-
tion direction, not on its normal component (which determines the shading proper; Koenderink & Pont
2003). The field of tangential components depends both on the source distribution and on the shape of
the surface. A planar wall in sunlight will receive a uniform, unidirectional "surface irradiance flow",
whereas a spherical surface under the same illumination will receive a diverging flow. (The center of
divergence being the point where the sphere is normally irradiated, the tangential component vanishing
at that point).
Light field deformation blindness 477
The texture due to the surface irradiance flow will be of high contrast where the tangential
component is large as compared to the normal component, that is, at the terminator of the attached
shadow, and low where the tangential component is small as compared to the normal component,
that is, near the points that are normally irradiated, that is, face the source (Koenderink & Pont,
2002). The texture due to the surface irradiance flow is crucial for the perception of the nature of
material surfaces, a fact that is highly appreciated by photographers (Adams, 1952) For instance, in
portrait photography, skin texture is minimized by irradiation from the camera position and maxi-
mized by having the radiant source at right angles to the camera direction (Hunter & Fuqua, 1990).
The "light field" (because "light" is a quale, this historical term is perhaps an unfortunate one)
in space is a formal notion used in radiometric calculations, for instance, in interior architecture
(Gershun, 1936; Moon & Spencer 1981). The light field is a field of vectors that specify the aver-
age flow of radiant power through arbitrary virtual surface elements. (Here "virtual" indicates the
absence of a material surface.) The light field is itself invisible (as all radiation that does not arrive
in the eye is invisible) but specifies what would happen if you were to put an object at a certain
location. Human observers are visually aware of the light field on the bases of irradiated objects in
the scene and have expectations regarding the way a novel object introduced at some location would
appear to them. In that sense, they are indeed aware of the light field in empty space (Koenderink et
Figure A2. Examples of light fields as revealed by a circular necklace of spherical beads. At top a uniform,
unidirectional field, at center a diverging field, at bottom a deformation field (it may take some scrutiny to parse
the latter). In the experiment, we offer a "view from the top".

al, 2007).
The surface irradiance flow exists only on the surfaces of objects in the scene. It can be seen if
a surface is rough on the microscale, at least if this scale is coarser than the human visual resolution.
On the basis of such texture, human observers are sensitive to the direction of irradiance flow, being
able to estimate it to within 10 or so (Koenderink & Pont 2003). If the surfaces are smooth (e.g.,
plastics, many artificial objects, perhaps most objects used in vision research using screen presenta-
tions), the surface irradiance flow is not detectable.
The structure of the light field is determined by the distribution of radiant sources, including
"secondary radiators," that are illuminated surfaces that scatter radiation into all directions available
to them. (Of course, this implies "tertiary", etc., sources. The overall light field involves infinite sums
over such contributions; Koenderink & van Doorn, 1983). The light field in a realistic scene has nu-
merous "singular points", which are of various qualitatively different natures. In planar sections, one
has cases of convergent or divergent, whirl (rotational) and deformation fields (Mury et al., 2007). An
example is shown in Figure A1. In three dimensions, one has combinations of these. The singularities
can be seen when strategically located test objects are placed in the scene. This is illustrated in Figure
A2.
The structure of the surface irradiance flow depends both on the structure of the light field and
on the shape of the surface. In the simplest case of uniform, unidirectional irradiation, the flow
depends only on the shape of the surface. A sphere in sunlight will yield a divergent field, a spheri-
cal cup a convergent field, a saddle surface a deformation field (See Figure A3.) An intuitive way to
grasp the structure of the surface irradiance flow is as the flow of water that runs downward along the
surface.
The texture will also depend on the nature of the corrugated surface. When the surface is statisti-
cally identical to its depth-reversed copy (as with a Gaussian random surface), only the orientation (as
opposed to the direction) of the flow is revealed (Koenderink & Pont, 2003; Koenderink et al., 2004)
In such a case, it is impossible to make out the difference between a convergent or divergent field.
This makes it also very hard to glean a good impression of a deformation field (Figure A4 top row).
When the surface is less symmetrical, the direction of surface irradiance flow is revealed (See Figure
A5.) In the center column of Figure A4, one sees a divergent field. This image is very similar to the
view of a plastered ceiling around a light source mounted on the ceiling. If the surface corrugations
are more regular, the texture approaches the case used in the experiment. In the bottom row of Figure
A4, one easily spots the uniform, unidirectional field and the divergent field, whereas it is difficult to
gain a coherent impression of the deformation field. People's impressions appear to vary. One com-
mon observation is that the convexities tend to invert in parts of the image, depending on the momen-
tary fixation point.
The stimulus in our experiment is a highly simplified configuration that schematizes either a
distribution of objects in space or a corrugated surface. Thus, it may be understood as either show-
ing a planar section of the light field or a sample of surface irradiance flow. It does not really matter
which, as we are only interested in establishing whether human observers are perceptually aware of

Figure A5. Cross-section of heights for the surface in the middle row of Figure A4. The top profile shows a
sample of the surface itself, the bottom row a sample of a depth-inverted version. The two types are easy enough
to distinguish; thus, you can easily notice whether you see the surface (or perhaps only part of the surface) in the
images of the middle row of Figure A4 as intended, or reversed. You may want to practice on the leftmost image.
You should be able to "get" (in visual awareness) both the correct and the inverted version. In the rightmost image,
you may notice correct and inverted patches, shifting as you change your fixation.

certain shading patterns.
How frequent do deformation singularities occur in nature? For the case of surface irradiance
flow, one may use a theorem by Morse (1934), which relates the numbers of vergent points (either
convergent or divergent) and the number of saddle points (the centers of deformation patterns) to
the Euler (1736) characteristic of a surface. For a piece of surface that is topologically equivalent
to a disk (no holes of any kind), this characteristic equals one. Then, the number of deformation
singularities is one less than the number of vergent patterns. (In this case, whirl patterns do not
occur.) Thus, the upshot is that the vergent and deformation patterns are roughly equally frequent. If
you consider the patterns on the ground in an open forest, this implies that you will probably have
hundreds of deformation patterns in your visual field.
