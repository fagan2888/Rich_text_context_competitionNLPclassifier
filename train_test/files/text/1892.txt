Background--Although white blood cell (WBC) count has been consistently associated with cardiovascular end points,
little information is available on the independent contribution of specific white blood cell types. The objective of this
study is to assess the independent association of WBC types and other inflammatory markers with the presence of
reduced ankle-brachial blood pressure index (ABI), a marker of subclinical peripheral arterial disease (PAD).
Methods & Results--Cross-sectional study in 3949 individuals 40 years of age without known cardiovascular disease
who participated in the 1999 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). PAD was defined
as an ABI 0.9 in at least 1 leg. After adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, the odds ratios of PAD
comparing the highest to the lowest quartiles were 2.24 (95% confidence interval 1.24 to 4.04) for monocytes, 1.74 (0.87
to 3.45) for neutrophils, 2.53 (1.62 to 3.96) for C-reactive protein, and 2.68 (1.03 to 6.94) for fibrinogen. When WBC
types and inflammatory markers were simultaneously included in the full model, the corresponding odds ratios were
1.91 (95% confidence interval 1.06 to 3.42) for monocytes, 1.15 (0.49 to 2.69) for neutrophils, 1.37 (0.75 to 2.49) for
C-reactive protein, and 2.21 (0.88 to 5.57) for fibrinogen.
Conclusions--Monocytes were the only WBC type significantly and independently associated with PAD in a
representative sample of the U.S. population after adjustment for other inflammatory markers. These findings reflect the
potential role of circulating monocyte counts as markers of atherosclerosis. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol.

Atherogenesis is a chronic inflammatory process charac-
terized by early leukocyte recruitment that continues
throughout plaque maturation and rupture.1,2 Indeed, white
blood cell (WBC) count elevation has been consistently
associated with cardiovascular events.3,4 However, WBC
count includes several cell types with potentially different
pathogenic roles in atherogenesis. Although monocyte-mac-
rophages play a central role in atherogenesis,5­7 little atten-
tion has been paid to the association of monocyte count with
subclinical atherosclerosis. Few studies have assessed the
association of specific WBC types with cardiovascular end
points,8 and these studies have not evaluated the specific
contribution of circulating monocytes with respect to other
WBC types and markers of inflammation, such as C-reactive
protein (CRP) and fibrinogen.9­11
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is strongly associated
with increased levels of inflammatory markers, including
WBC count, CRP, and fibrinogen.12­14 The objective of this
study was to assess the association of circulating blood
monocytes and other WBC types with the presence of
reduced ankle-brachial blood pressure index (ABI), a highly
specific marker of PAD.15­18 We were specifically interested
in the independent contribution of each cell type after
adjustment for CRP, fibrinogen, and traditional cardiovascu-
lar risk factors.
Methods
Since the 1960s, the National Center for Health Statistics has
conducted the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
(NHANES), a series of cross-sectional surveys designed to provide
data representative of the noninstitutionalized civilian U.S. popula-
tion. In this study we used data from NHANES 1999 to 2002, as ABI
measurements were only available in NHANES since 1999. The total
population of NHANES 1999 to 2002 was 21 004. Participants 40
years of age and older were asked to participate in the ABI Section
of the Lower Extremity Disease examination. Overall 6671 individ-

uals were 40 years of age in NHANES 1999 to 2002. Persons were
excluded from the examination if they have bilateral amputations or
weigh 400 pounds (because of equipment limitations). In addition
to these exclusion criteria, some individuals who were eligible for
the examination (40 years) might not have received the examina-
tion due to the following multiple reasons: (1) casts, ulcers, dress-
ings, or other conditions of the participant interfered with testing, (2)
participant could not understand the test instructions, (3) participant
became ill and the test could not be performed, (4) there was an
equipment failure, (5) participant refused, (6) participant came late or
left early from the MEC and the LED examination could not be
performed, or (7) some other reason. As a result, these eligible
persons will have missing data for the ABI variables. Overall 5083
individuals 40 years of age had a valid ABI measurement.
Individuals with a known history of stroke, myocardial infarction,
angina, and congestive heart failure (n749) were excluded. We also
excluded participants with ABI values 1.4 (n68)19 and those with
missing values in variables of interest (n317), leaving 3949
individuals in the present study.
Ankle Brachial Index
A specific protocol was used to measure ABI in NHANES 1999 to
2002.20 Systolic blood pressure was measured on the right arm
(brachial artery) or the left arm if only choice, and both ankles
(posterior tibial arteries) with a Doppler device (Parks Mini-
Laboratory IV, model 3100, Parks Medical Electronics). Systolic
blood pressure was measured twice at each site for participants 40 to
59 years of age and once at each site for participants 60 years of
age. The left and right ABI measurements were obtained by dividing
the ankle systolic blood pressure for each side respectively by the
systolic brachial blood pressure, or by using the mean pressures for
participants with 2 blood pressure measurements at each site. PAD
was defined as an ABI value 0.9 in at least 1 leg.21
WBC Counts, C-Reactive Protein, and Fibrinogen
WBC count was determined on a Coulter Counter Model S-PLUS JR
(Coulter Electronics). Target coefficients of variation were 3.0%.
High-sensitivity CRP was measured using latex-enhanced nephe-
lometry on a Behring Nephelometer Analyzer System (Behring
Diagnostics, Inc) with NA Latex CRP Kit (Behring Diagnostics,
Inc). The intra-assay coefficient of variation was 3.2%. Fibrinogen
was determined by a comparison of the clotting time from a sample
with that of a standardized fibrinogen preparation obtained on a
Coagamate XC Plus automated coagulation analyzer (Organon
Teknika). The intra-assay coefficients of variation ranged from 1.7 to
3.9%. Details about laboratory procedures and quality control in
NHANES are available elsewhere.22
Other Variables
Age, sex, race/ethnicity, and smoking were assessed by self-report.
Obesity was defined as a body mass index 30 kg/m2. Hypertension
was defined as mean systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg, mean
diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg, or a self-report of a physician
diagnosis or medication use. Mean blood pressure was composed of
up to 4 readings on 2 separate occasions. Hypercholesterolemia was
defined as a total cholesterol 240 mg/dL, or a self-report of a
physician diagnosis or medication use. Diabetes was defined as a
fasting glucose 126 mg/dL, or a nonfasting glucose 200 mg/dL,
or a self report of a physician diagnosis or medication use. Glomer-
ular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated by the Modification of Diet
in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study formula.23 Mild kidney dysfunction
was defined as a GFR of 60 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, and low kidney
function was defined as a GFR 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using svy commands in Stata
version 8 to account for the complex sampling design and weights in
NHANES 1999 to 2002.
WBC type counts and CRP were markedly right skewed and were
log-transformed for statistical analysis. They were described as
geometric means and 95% confidence intervals. Pearson correlations
between WBC types and inflammatory markers were calculated.
WBC types, CRP, and fibrinogen were divided into quartiles
according to the weighted distribution of the whole sample. Because
of the small number of distinct levels, basophil count was grouped in
2 categories ( 0.1 and 0.1 109/L, with 58% and 42% of subjects,
respectively), and eosinophil count was grouped in 3 categories (
0.2, 0.2, and 0.2 109/L, with 45%, 31%, and 24% of subjects,
respectively). Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds
ratios for the prevalence of PAD in quartiles 2 to 4 of inflammatory
markers compared with the first quartile. Tests for trend across
increasing quartiles (or prespecified cutoffs for eosinophils and
basophils) were computed by introducing variables with the median
level for each quartile in the regression models.
Three sets of multivariable models were used to examine the
association of WBC types, CRP, and fibrinogen in a hierarchical
fashion. Model 1 adjusted for age, sex, and race. Model 2 further
adjusted for traditional risk factors (smoking status, obesity, hyper-
tension, diabetes, hypercholesteremia, and GFR). Model 3 adjusted
simultaneously for WBC types, CRP, and fibrinogen in addition to
the covariates included in Model 2.
Results
There were 220 PAD cases among 3949 study participants
(weighted prevalence 3.6%; 95% CI 3.1% to 4.1%). WBC
count, CRP, and fibrinogen were higher in PAD cases
compared with non-cases (all P0.001; Table 1). Among
WBC subtypes, only monocytes and neutrophils were signif-
icantly higher in PAD cases.
CRP and fibrinogen were strongly correlated (r0.54), but
their correlation with WBC subtypes was weaker (r0.30 for
all WBC subtypes; Table 2). Among WBC types, neutrophils
were the most strongly correlated with CRP and fibrinogen.

The correlation coefficient of monocytes with neutrophils
was 0.45 and similar in males and females.
In age-, sex-, and race-adjusted analyses, monocytes,
neutrophils, CRP, and fibrinogen levels were significantly
associated with the prevalence of PAD (Table 3, Model 1).
These associations persisted, although slightly attenuated,
after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors
(Table 3, Model 2). In risk factor adjusted models, the odds
ratios comparing the prevalence of PAD in the highest versus
the lowest quartiles were 2.24 (95% confidence interval 1.24
to 4.04) for monocytes, 1.74 (0.87 to 3.45) for neutrophils,
2.53 (1.62 to 3.96) for CRP, and 2.68 (1.03 to 6.94) for
fibrinogen. Basophils or eosinophils were not associated with
PAD in either model (data not shown).
When WBC types, CRP, and fibrinogen were introduced in
the models in addition to traditional cardiovascular risk
factors, monocytes and fibrinogen were still associated with
PAD prevalence (Table 3, Model 3). The odds ratios com-
paring the prevalence of PAD in the highest versus the lowest
quartiles were now 1.91 (95% confidence interval 1.06 to
3.42) for monocytes, 1.15 (0.49 to 2.69) for neutrophils, 1.37
(0.75 to 2.49) for CRP, and 2.21 (0.88 to 5.57) for fibrinogen.
In subgroup analysis, the association of monocyte count with
PAD was similar irrespective of the presence or absence of
traditional risk factors and other inflammatory markers (not
shown).
Discussion
Multiple lines of evidence indicate that inflammation plays a
pivotal role in atherogenesis, and that inflammatory markers
such as WBC count may aid in the detection of individuals at
higher atherosclerotic risk.24 In this cross-sectional study of
apparently healthy men and women, an elevated monocyte
count was significantly associated with PAD after adjustment
for traditional risk factors. This relationship was not present
for other WBC types, and it was independent of CRP and
fibrinogen.
WBC is a strong independent risk factor for cardiovascular
events,25­28 and for the prevalence and progression of sub-
clinical atherosclerosis.29,30 A recent meta-analysis concluded
that, among WBC types, neutrophils were more strongly
associated with future coronary events than monocytes,31 but
none of the studies described in this meta-analysis simulta-
neously controlled for other WBC types, CRP, or fibrinogen.
In our study, neutrophils were more strongly associated with
CRP and fibrinogen than monocytes, and adjusting for CRP
and fibrinogen virtually eliminated the association of neutro-
phils with PAD. Inflammation is associated with virtually all
stages of vascular disease including atherogenesis, plaque
rupture, and end-organ damage secondary to ischemia and/or
embolism. It is conceivable that monocyte counts may be
more strongly related to early development and progression
of atherosclerosis,32,33 but once established atherosclerotic
disease is present, they do not strongly influence the risk of
events. Quantification of the predictive ability of monocyte
counts will require fresh evidence from prospective studies
with serial measurements of WBC counts, differentials, and
other inflammatory markers.
There is extensive evidence for the active contribution of
monocytes to atherosclerotic lesion development.34.35 The
infiltration of circulating monocytes into the blood vessel
wall, where they are transformed into lipid-laden foam cells,
is one of the earliest events in the development of atheroscle-
rotic lesions. Monocytes are believed to play a critical role
not only in initiation of atherosclerosis, but also at multiple
stages including promotion of plaque instability and remod-
eling after a myocardial insult.36
The classical immunophenotypic marker for monocytes is
CD14, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor.37 However, at
least 2 distinct subpopulations of monocytes can be distin-
guished from the expression patterns of membrane surface
antigens. About 10% of monocytes coexpress CD16, the
low-affinity Fc-gamma receptor III. CD14/CD16 mono-
cytes are considered "proinflammatory monocytes" as they
efficiently produce tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-),38
while producing little antiinflammatory cytokine
interleukin-10 (IL-10) in comparison to CD14/CD16
monocytes.39 Levels of TNF- are known to correlate with
carotid intima­media thickness.40 In addition, CD14/
CD16 monocytes are expanded in hypercholestremic pa-
tients,35 negatively correlated to HDL cholesterol levels,35
and associated in a dose-dependent fashion with the expres-
sion of the more positively charged apo E4.35
In a small case­control study, Schlitt et al found CD14/
CD16 monocytes to be significantly associated with the
prevalence of coronary artery disease,41 but the retrospective

design and the small sample size make it difficult to interpret
these findings. Because Schlitt et al measured monocyte
levels in cases after occurrence of clinical events, it is
impossible to determine in this study whether CD14/
CD16 levels contributed to the event or were a consequence
of it. The evaluation of the role of CD14/CD16 mono-
cytes in atherosclerosis progression and cardiovascular out-
comes in prospective studies should be a research priority.
In our study, fibrinogen was also independently associated
with the prevalence of PAD after taking into account CVD
risk factors, WBC differentials, and CRP. The finding is
consistent with previous reports demonstrating fibrinogen to
be associated with incident CHD events as well subclinical
atherosclerosis adjusting for other inflammatory markers.42­45
In the Caerphilly study, controlling for CRP did not diminish
the effect of fibrinogen for incident CHD indicating it to be a
more specific CHD risk factor.43 In a population sample of
adults (n519, median age 55.5 years, 80% men) without
clinically overt atherosclerotic disease, elevated fibrinogen
levels was related to carotid IMT independently of a wide
range of important confounding variables including CRP.44
Baseline fibrinogen levels have also been observed to be
associated with higher carotid intimal thickness (IMT) levels
in a 5-year follow-up in the Edinburgh Artery Study.45 Higher
fibrinogen levels may potentially promote atherosclerosis by
increasing platelet adhesion to the subendothelium as well
affecting endothelial function.46,47 Our and previous findings
support the role of fibrinogen as an independent marker of
generalized atherosclerotic lesions in major arterial beds.
The strengths of our study include the rigorous methodol-
ogy and extensive quality control of NHANES procedures,
the use of a nationally representative sample, and the use of
a validated and specific measure of PAD. Our findings,
however, must be interpreted in the context of certain

limitations. Because of the cross-sectional design, we could
not determine whether circulating monocytes are directly
related to the atherosclerotic process or their recruitment is
stimulated by the presence of atherosclerotic lesions. Our
study lacked information on monocyte subtypes as well on
the presence of viral or bacterial infections that may be
implicated in atherogenesis and may affect monocyte count.
Whether an elevated monocyte count has direct vascular or
prothrombotic effects, is merely increased secondarily to
prevalent atherosclerosis, or is simply a marker of an uncer-
tain environmental or infectious stimulus remains to be
determined. Confirmation of these findings in prospective
studies is of critical importance. Finally, in our study WBC
determination was performed once; factors such as infections,
day-to-day variations, as well as variability in WBC determi-
nation may have potentially effected our findings by catego-
rizing participants with lower levels as having higher levels
and vice versa.48 It is generally considered that impact of such
dilution bias underestimates the true associations with CVD
risk as much as 50% for monocyte counts.48,49 The associa-
tion of monocyte count with PAD observed in our study is
potentially likely to be underestimated.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates for the first time an independent
association between monocyte count and peripheral arterial
disease defined as a reduced ankle-brachial blood pressure
index in a large population based study. More detailed
characterization of the association between different mono-
cyte populations and clinical and subclinical atherosclerotic
outcomes is needed to better characterize the role of inflam-
matory cells in atherosclerosis.
