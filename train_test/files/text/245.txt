Abstract
Objective: To study the dynamics of childhood overweight and the influence of
dietary intake on tracking of overweight.
Design and setting: A follow-up study conducted in China.
Subjects: Ninety-five overweight children, 6­13 years old, identified from 1455
children at baseline, were followed over a 2-year period.
Methods: Data on anthropometry and 3-day dietary intake were collected at baseline
and during follow-up. Overweight was defined using the International Obesity Task
Force reference of body mass index (BMI)-for-age. Differences between groups were
tested using analysis of variance and Cochran­Mantel­Haenszel tests.
Results: Of the 95 overweight children, 36.8% remained overweight 2 years later
(`tracking group'). Urban boys were three times more likely than rural boys to remain
overweight (63.2% vs. 21.9%). At baseline, the tracking group had higher BMI, body
weight and fat intake (% of energy), and lower carbohydrate intake (% of energy),
than the non-tracking group (who shifted from overweight to not overweight); they
were more likely to have a high-fat or high-meat diet, but less likely to have a diet high
in carbohydrate or vegetables and fruit. During the follow-up, the tracking group
increased fat intake and reduced carbohydrate intake while the non-tracking group
did not; and they also grew slower in height but faster in weight. Tracking of
overweight seemed to be related to tracking of high-meat (relative risk (RR) 2.4, 95%
confidence interval (CI) 1.0­5.6, P , 0:05) and high-fat (RR 1.5, 95% CI 0.9­2.5,
P , 0:1) diets.
Conclusion: Considerable changes in children's overweight status during childhood
and adolescence were observed in China, a transitional society. Dietary patterns,
particularly dietary composition, seemed to influence the tracking patterns of
overweight.

Obesity has become a global epidemic1­ 3. Childhood and
adolescence are identified as two critical periods for the
development of obesity4, and extensive efforts have
begun to focus on the prevention and management of
obesity during this period5. Numerous studies from
industrialised countries have shown that large proportions
of obese children remain obese through adolescence and
into adulthood6­8. Most previous research has focused on
investigating the risk factors for the development of
obesity ­ studying why non-obese individuals become
obese. Few studies based on free-living populations
have examined why obese children have different body
weight status at older ages, although some small-scale
intervention studies have tested the effects of vigorous
behaviour and lifestyle modification efforts9 ­12. Such
studies will provide useful insights into the development
of effective programmes, particularly for preventing
overweight children from becoming obese adults.
Another major gap in the literature is the lack of
understanding of the effects of childhood diet on
obesity13. Although dietary intake is widely viewed as a
crucial determinant of obesity, to our knowledge only
limited longitudinal studies have examined this topic in
free-living children, and findings are inconclusive13 ­17.
Many previous studies have examined the association
between children's dietary intake and body composition

using cross-sectional data, which cannot test causality18.
Positive energy balance is the fundamental biological basis
for obesity1,19. Surprisingly, very few studies have
detected a positive relationship between energy intake
and fatness, particularly in studies conducted in industri-
alised countries13. Underreporting and other measure-
ment errors are suggested as possible explanations for the
failure to detect these associations20 ­22. In a comprehen-
sive meta-analysis, Parsons et al.13 concluded that findings
about the effects of various dietary factors are incon-
clusive, and current literature provides little evidence to
suggest a relationship between any aspect of childhood
diet and fatness in adulthood in industrialised countries.
It is argued that the relationship between dietary intake
and body composition may be more complex than what is
indicated by a simple model of energy balance23,24.
Increasing evidence from studies, mainly in adults,
suggests that diet composition influences food and energy
intakes and affects adiposity23 ­27.
This study examined the dynamic patterns of over-
weight among Chinese children and their predictors. We
focused on the influence of dietary intake on tracking of
overweight. Longitudinal data from the China Health and
Nutrition Survey (CHNS) were used. Over the past two
decades, China, while undergoing extremely rapid socio-
economic changes, has become a society where people's
living standards, lifestyles, diet and nutritional status are
highly heterogeneous28 ­30. This provides an excellent
setting for enhancing our understanding of the aetiology
of childhood obesity.
Materials and methods
Study design
The CHNS was a longitudinal study initiated in 1989 in
eight provinces that vary substantially in geography,
economic development, public resources and health
indicators. Data have been collected in four rounds
(in 1989, 1991, 1993 and 1997). The initial survey covered
3780 households from 192 communities, totalling
16 000 individuals. School-aged children have been
included since 1991. More details about the study design
and data collection are provided elsewhere31.
Subjects
Our analysis focused on 95 children who were initially
overweight at baseline (1991) and were resurveyed in
1993. These children were identified from 1455 partici-
pants, aged 6­13 years in 1991, who had completed data
in the 1991 and 1993 surveys. At baseline 1535 children
had completed anthropometric measures. Individuals
were lost to follow-up mainly because of physical absence
when the later surveys were conducted, e.g. being away
from home due to attending school, working or visiting
relatives. Our analysis shows that the children's main
baseline sociodemographic characteristics such as age, sex
and urban­rural residence were not significantly different
between those who were followed and those who missed
the 1993 survey ðP . 0:05Þ: (Note: the 1997 data were not
used in the present study.*) The School of Public Health at
the University of North Carolina and the Chinese Academy
of Preventive Medicine have reviewed and approved the
procedures for the protection of human subjects during
data collection.
Data collection
Anthropometry
Measurements of body weight, height, triceps skinfold
thickness and arm circumference were obtained from all
family members (i.e. children and their parents) in each
survey. Weight was measured in light, indoor clothing to
the nearest 0.1 kg with a beam balance scale. Height was
measured without shoes to the nearest 0.1 cm using a
portable stadiometer.
Dietary data
Detailed household food consumption data and individual
dietary intake data were collected for three consecutive
days in each survey. The sample was randomly allocated
from Monday to Sunday and almost equally balanced
across the seven days of the week from each sampling
unit. Household food consumption was determined by
inventory change from the beginning to the end of each
day. Individual dietary intake data (24-hour recall) for the
same three consecutive days were obtained from all family
members. For young children (under 10 years), the
mothers reported their dietary intake. The collection of
data on household food consumption and individual
dietary intake allowed a check on the quality of each
against the other. At the time of data collection, the
individual and household dietary data were compared and
used to identify major discrepancies. When significant
discrepancies were found, the household and the
individual in question were revisited and asked about
their food consumption to resolve these discrepancies.
*The 1997 data were not used in the present study because of several
considerations. First, one of the eight provinces did not participate in
the 1997 survey. As a result, the sample size was reduced considerably
in 1997. Second, only a small number of children (,15%) remained
overweight in 1997 based on the International Obesity Task Force
(IOTF) standard that we used. The small numbers did not allow us to
make meaningful comparisons between the two groups. Third, we
suspect that the IOTF reference might have a low sensitivity in
identifying overweight individuals in older adolescents from
developing countries31. However, no local body mass index (BMI)
reference for child and adolescent overweight is available in China.
Finally, increasing evidence shows a close association between
sexual maturation and obesity. Our previous research and others
found that the median age of menarche among Chinese girls is
around 13.7 years. Therefore, to limit our analysis within a 2-year
follow-up period (1991 to 1993) for children initially aged 6­13 years
would help minimise the influence of puberty and that of other
factors listed above.

From the household dietary data, information on cooking
oil and other condiments, such as salt, supplemented
the individual dietary intake data based on individuals'
amounts of meat and vegetable consumption32,33. Great
efforts were made in the field to survey all subjects within a
short period in the autumn in each survey. The 1991
Chinese food consumption table34 was used to calculate
subjects' nutrient intakes.
Quality control
The survey team comprised 20­23 nutritionists for each of
the provinces in each round of the survey. All interviewers
had at least a college degree and they had attended 10-day
training sessions for each survey. Most interviewers had
experience of conducting other national health and
nutrition surveys. Interviewers were required to follow a
carefully developed protocol similar to that used in the US
National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
(NHANES)35. In addition, inter- and intra-observer
reliability and equipment checks were conducted during
the training and data collection.
Measures and study variables
Definition of overweight
BMI (weight (kg)/[height (m)]2) has been used widely in
adults to define overweight and obesity1. Currently BMI is
increasingly accepted for use in children and adoles-
cents1,36­40. We chose to use the IOTF sex­age-specific
BMI cut-offs to define child overweight, which corre-
sponds to BMI ¼ 25 kg m22 at age 18 years37. The IOTF
reference was developed on the basis of data from six
countries world-wide. In addition, if in 1991 a mother or
father's BMI was $25 kg m22, they were classified as
overweight; if BMI was ,18.5 kg m22, they were classified
as underweight1.
Dietary intakes
Each child's diet was characterised by using his/her 3-day
average macronutrient intakes and food group consump-
tion. Two main food groups, meats and vegetables and
fruit (VF), were selected based on the University of North
Carolina­Institute of Nutrition and Food Hygiene China
Food Grouping System, which was developed by the
authors (Wang et al., 1998, unpublished). The Food
Grouping System separates over 1400 foods into five major
categories (i.e. (1) grains, cereals and products; (2) veg-
etables and fruits; (3) animal source products; (4) cooking
oil, seasoning and other condiments; and (5) other) and
39 food groups (e.g. the VF category was further
divided into seven groups including fresh vegetables,
fresh fruits, dried vegetables, pickled vegetables, etc.).
Meats and VF were highlighted in this study because they
are likely to influence the energy density of an individual's
diet and total energy intake (TEI), and thus affect
adiposity. Meats included red meats such as pork, beef
and lamb, poultry, game, organ meats, fish and meat
products. Note that, in general, fruit consumption in China
is quite low, especially in rural areas29. Thus, vegetables
were the major component of the sample's VF
consumption.
We chose to use `relative measures' (e.g. proportion of
TEI derived from a certain macronutrient) instead of
absolute measures (e.g. amount of nutrient or food intake)
to study the effects of dietary intake on overweight over
time. This is because biological requirements for nutrients
and energy keep changing with age during childhood and
adolescence, and also vary by sex and maturation
status41,42. Furthermore, increasing evidence suggests
that the composition of the diet affects adiposity, although
very few studies have found a positive relationship
between TEI and obesity13.
We computed children's TEI as a `percentage of the
Chinese Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA)
(%RDA)'34, along with dietary fat and carbohydrate
intakes as `percentages of energy (%E) from each of
these macronutrients' (see Table 1). Moreover, because
the Chinese RDA for energy intake is provided only for
age groups for children (see Appendix) and because
biological energy requirements vary by body size,
children's TEI was also expressed as `energy/height'
( ¼ kcal cm21, 1 kcal ¼ 4:184 kJ). Note that height but
not weight was used, because the outcome variable in
the present study was obesity. Consumption of meats
and VF was measured as `grams per 1000 kcal'
(mg kcal21). We focused on examining the structure of
the children's diet instead of absolute amounts of dietary
intake. Such energy adjustment also allowed for
addressing reporting errors and bias43. Several special
types of dietary intake patterns were defined and are
presented in Table 1.
Data analysis
Based on children's BMI, we first examined the dynamic
patterns of their overweight status between 1991 and 1993.
Then, we compared the differences between the over-
weight tracking and non-tracking groups (Groups 1 and 2,
see below). We attempted to examine: (1) whether they
had different baseline characteristics; and (2) whether they
had experienced different changes during the follow-up.
Based on individuals' BMI measures in 1991 and 1993,
children were separated into four groups (representing
four types of dynamic pattern):
. Group 1: overweight ! overweight group (tracking of
overweight);
. Group 2: overweight ! non-overweight (non-tracking
of overweight);
. Group 3: non-overweight ! overweight (development
of overweight); and
. Group 4: non-overweight ! non-overweight (not over-
weight in either year).

We focused on comparing the first two groups, but not the
last two, because a large body of literature has studied the
risk factors for the development of obesity.
We conducted Cochran­Mantel­Haenszel tests to
examine the differences in categorical variables. Relative
risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) are presented.
Logistic regression analysis could not be performed owing
to small sample size44. For continuous variables, we
conducted analyses of variance using General Linear
Models to test the differences between groups, adjusted
for age and gender. Next, using Cochran­Mantel­
Haenszel tests we studied the association between
tracking of overweight and tracking of dietary intake
patterns. Finally, similar analyses were performed to
compare the two groups' experience during the follow-up
(i.e. changes in dietary intake and growth in height and
weight). Note that we also considered more completely
specified models, which included a number of thesis
variables simultaneously. But we chose not do this due to:
(1) our small sample size; and (2) some of the variables
being highly correlated, e.g. the correlation coefficient (r)
between baseline fat and carbohydrate intakes was 0.99;
and r ¼ 0:37 for BMI and weight. Furthermore, collinear-
ity was detected when the dietary intake variables were all
included. A separate concern relates to the possible need
of adjustments for multiple comparisons. These adjust-
ments were not made because they are recommended for
clinical trials, but not for observational epidemiological
studies45 ­49. Data management and data analysis were
performed using SAS software, version 8.2 (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Main characteristics of the sample and overweight
dynamics patterns
At baseline, the mean age of the sample was 9.4
(standard deviation (SD) 2.2) years, 51.8% were aged 6­9
years and 48.2% were aged 10­13 years. Their mean BMI
was 16.2 (SD 3.1) kg m22; 47.2% were female, and 24.1%
lived in urban areas. Cross-sectional analysis revealed
that the prevalence of overweight was 6.4% in 1991 and
6.3% in 1993. During 1991­1993, only a small proportion
(4.2%; 57/1360) of non-overweight children became
overweight.

The overweight tracking patterns are presented in
Table 2. Over one-third (36.8%) of the 95 overweight
children remained overweight in 1993. Overweight
children (6­9 years) were more likely to remain over-
weight than were adolescents (10­13 years). Urban boys
were almost three times more likely to remain overweight
than their rural counterparts (63.2% vs. 21.9%, P , 0:05).
In contrast, urban overweight girls were less likely to
remain overweight than rural girls, but the difference
(28.6% vs. 37.8%) was not significant (P . 0.05).
Comparison of baseline characteristics between the
overweight tracking and non-tracking groups
As shown in Table 3, the overweight tracking group had a
significantly higher %E derived from dietary fat intake
(23.6% vs. 19.1%), but a lower %E from carbohydrate
(64.0% vs. 68.9%). They also had higher meat consump-
tion but lower VF consumption, although the differences
between the two groups were not significant ðP . 0:05Þ:
The tracking group was heavier and had higher BMI than
the non-tracking group ðP , 0:05Þ:
We also examined dietary intakes as categorical
variables ­ types of diet (Table 4). Overweight children
who had a high-fat diet ðP , 0:1Þ or a high-meat diet
ðP , 0:05Þ were more likely to remain overweight; but
those who had a high-carbohydrate diet or a high-VF diet
were at a lower risk ðP , 0:05Þ: Overall, urban children
were more likely to remain overweight than their rural
counterparts ðP , 0:05Þ; which was primarily due to the
urban­rural difference for boys.
Linkage between tracking of overweight and
tracking of dietary intake patterns
Cochran­Mantel­Haenszel tests reveal that tracking of
overweight was associated with the tracking of dietary
intake patterns. Children who maintained a high-meat
diet (RR 2.4, 95% CI 1.0­5.6, P , 0:05) or a high-fat diet
(RR 1.5, 95% CI 0.9­2.5, P , 0:1) were more likely to
remain overweight. Note that if odds ratios (ORs) were
reported, they were much greater then RRs; e.g. for
tracking of high-meat diet, OR and 95% CI were 4.4 and
1.0­19.6.
Comparison of changes in dietary intake during
the follow-up between the overweight tracking and
non-tracking groups
Although none of the differences in dietary intake changes
between the two groups were statistically significant when
adjusted for age and gender ðP . 0:05Þ; compared with
the non-tracking group, the overweight tracking group
had a smaller decrease in TEI levels, expressed as %RDA
(213.0 vs. 218.1) and as a measure relative to children's
height (21.9 vs. 23.7), and a greater increase in meat
consumption (6.8 mg kcal21 vs. 0.9 mg kcal21), which is
marginally significant ðP , 0:07Þ:
As shown in Table 5, when children's baseline BMI and
corresponding baseline dietary intake were also adjusted,
the differences in fat and carbohydrate intakes between
the two groups became significant ðP , 0:05Þ: The
tracking group had increased their fat intake and
decreased carbohydrate intake, while the non-tracking
group decreased their fat intake and increased carbo-
hydrate intake. In addition, the tracking group's meat
consumption increased, but the non-tracking group's was
almost not changed.

follow-up (Fig. 1). The ratio of growth in weight-to-height
was 0.9 vs. 0.2. We also compared these two groups with
the other two groups (those who initially were not
overweight). The overweight tracking group had a similar
height growth rate to those who remained non-over-
weight. Non-overweight children who became over-
weight in 1993 grew slower in height but faster in
weight than the other three groups. These suggest that
growth patterns and sexual maturation may influence
children's risk of remaining overweight.
Discussion
Studies conducted in industrialised countries show that
approximately one-third of obese children and one-half of
obese adolescents remain obese as adults, but the rate
varies considerably between studies6,7. In general, obesity
tracking patterns seem to be influenced by the length of
follow-up, definitions of obesity, initial age when obesity
developed, degree of initial obesity status, social
environmental factors and genetic disposition6,7. Follow-
ing 95 overweight children in China, a society under rapid
socio-economic transitions, we found that only over one-
third of children remained overweight over a 2-year
period. Our results are consistent with Mo-suwan et al.'s
findings in Thailand50. They reported that 12% of children
remained overweight over a 5-year period. They defined
overweight using the 85th percentile of BMI derived from
the US NHANES I data36. These findings may suggest
considerable opportunities to help reverse overweight
children's body weight status.
Several factors may help explain the low tracking in
overweight we observed. First, this may be due to the rapid
changes in socio-economic factors and people's lifestyles in
China over the past two decades28,30. Overweight children
might have changed their lifestyles considerably during the
follow-up as a result of the changes in their environments.
Second, we used the IOTF reference to define overweight,
which might have underestimated the tracking proportion.
Previous findings from other studies and ours indicate that
applying references based on data from wealthy
populations in developing countries may be problematic,
especially for longitudinal studies31,36,51­53. The IOTF
reference as well as the WHO reference36 used by
Mo-suwan et al. in their tracking study50 may have a
lower sensitivity for identifying overweight individuals
among adolescents than among children in developing
countries51,52. Moreover, the phenomenon may also be
related to the high prevalence of stunting among Chinese
children at young ages54. Stunting is suggested as a risk
factor for childhood obesity55,56. We suspect that catch-up
growth occurring at older ages, well-documented
previously57, may have helped reverse some children's
overweight status. Nevertheless, our findings indicate that
environmental and behavioural factors affect one's risk of
remaining overweight.

We found that children who remained overweight over
time had different baseline characteristics and experiences
during the follow-up. Dietary intake related to the tracking
of overweight. Children who tracked overweight were
more likely to have a higher baseline fat intake but lower
carbohydrate intake; and were more likely to have a high-
meat diet, but less likely to have a high-carbohydrate or
high-VF diet. Overweight children who tracked high-fat
and high-meat diets were more likely to remain
overweight. It is likely that the associations may be even
stronger than what we observed if intra-individual
variations in dietary intake can be corrected43,58.
Although energy balance in particular is the
fundamental biological basis for the influence of diet on
obesity, we did not observe a significant association
between energy intake and tracking of overweight. There
are several possible explanations. First, our small sample
size ðn ¼ 95Þ did not provide us with adequate statistical
power. Second, we could not adjust for children's physical
activity, which may be a potential confounder. Third, these
overweight children might have changed their energy
intake during the follow-up as indicated by our data.
For example, we found that both the tracking and non-
tracking groups reduced their TEI relative to the Chinese
RDA and their body size, but the tracking group reduced
less than the non-tracking group. Finally, similar to many
other studies conducted in free-living populations, we
could not measure children's TEI accurately, while
measures of diet composition (e.g. %E from fat) may be
a better indicator of children's actual energy intake levels.
We think that the composition of the sample's diets will be
more accurate or reliable than their reported absolute
amounts of foods/nutrients consumed. Goldberg and
colleagues reported that the majority of previous nutri-
tional epidemiological studies that used 24-hour recalls
have underestimated individuals' TEI59. Energy adjust-
ment generally reduces measurement error43.
Our data suggest an association between fat intake and
tracking of overweight. A number of mechanisms have
been suggested to explain why higher fat intake is linked
with obesity23 ­26,60. First, individuals who consume a
high-fat (as %E from fat) diet are likely to have higher TEI.
Second, excess energy from fat can readily be stored in
body adipose tissue depots with very high efficiency.
For example, about 96% of excess energy from fat but only
60­80% from carbohydrate may be stored as body fat.
This also helps explain why our subjects who had higher
carbohydrate intakes were less likely to track overweight.
Recently, based on clinical trials conducted between 1966
and 1998, Astrup et al.23 concluded that a reduction in
dietary fat intake without restriction of TEI prevents
weight gain in subjects of normal weight and produces a
weight loss in overweight subjects.
The linkage between meat consumption and tracking of
overweight is likely related to the impact of diet
composition on TEI. Children who consume more meat
are likely to have a higher TEI due to the higher energy
density and fat content of their diets. Pork is the main type
of meat consumed in China, which usually has a high fat
content29. But we suggest that people should be cautious
to recommend reducing children's meat consumption in
developing countries like China, where a large proportion
of the population do not have adequate protein intake and
suffer from a range of nutrition deficiencies29,54. In these
populations, higher meat consumption will help the
children obtain adequate amounts of the high-quality
protein, vitamins and minerals needed for growth and
development41,42.
The study of tracking of obesity in children and
adolescents is complicated by their complex linear growth
patterns. Few studies have examined the linkage between
tracking of obesity and children's linear growth patterns.
Previously, De Simone et al. reported that obese subjects
had a less notable growth spurt during puberty than lean
children61. Falorni et al.62 found that, compared with non-
obese children, obese Italian children had a significantly
greater height velocity before puberty; but around the age
of puberty, their growth spurt was reduced and more
precocious. As a result, obese children were shorter than
non-obese individuals. These obese children had partici-
pated in a weight-reduction programme. It is less clear
whether such findings are applicable to free-living
children, but previous evidence suggests that children's
linear growth is not influenced by the treatment of
obesity63. Based on longitudinal data collected for a large
Swedish cohort of children ðn ¼ 3650Þ; He and Karlberg
recently reported a positive association between BMI gain
and height gain during childhood (2­8 years); but BMI
gain during childhood was associated with reduced height
gain in adolescence. However, they found no direct
correlation between BMI gain in childhood and final
height at age 18 years64.
We found that, during the follow-up, the tracking group
grew faster in weight but slower in height than the
non-tracking group. The ratio of growth in weight-to-
height was 0.9 vs. 0.2 for the two groups. The high ratio

of weight-to-height growth for the tracking group was not
due to a subnormal growth in height. In fact, we found that
the tracking group had a similar height growth rate to non-
overweight children. Rather, it was children who were not
overweight at baseline but became overweight who grew
slower in height but faster in weight than all the others.
This suggests that the growth patterns accompanying
sexual maturation during late childhood and adolescence
may influence children's risk of having different over-
weight outcomes, although causality cannot be proved
with our data. A large body of literature shows that sexual
maturation is related to obesity65­ 70. The complex causal
relationship between maturation and fatness is yet to be
unravelled but clearly merits further examination.
The present study has several limitations. First, data on
physical activity were not collected and, as a result, we
were unable to examine how physical activity may
influence tracking of overweight. Second, only 95 children
were overweight at baseline and could be studied. The
small sample size limits our statistical power to detect
some significant results. For example, our sample size
allows for detecting a significant difference of
17.6 mg kcal21 in meat consumption and 264.5 mg kcal21
in VF consumption between the tracking and non-tracking
groups, while the observed differences were 5.0 and
221.3 mg kcal21, respectively. Third, the use of BMI and
the IOTF reference to classify overweight might have
caused some misclassifications. Finally, we could not
examine how genetic factors might influence tracking of
overweight. It will be of interest to understand the role
played by the interaction between genetics and environ-
mental factors19.
In conclusion, despite considerable changes in
children's overweight status during childhood and adoles-
cence and equally remarkable shifts in diet and socio-
economic factors, the dietary intake patterns of Chinese
children appear to influence the dynamics of childhood
overweight. Further studies based on larger samples and
longer follow-up periods are needed before being able to
extrapolate from our findings to the broader context.
