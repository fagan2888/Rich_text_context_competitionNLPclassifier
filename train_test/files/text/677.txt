and Mental Health

Past research on intergenerational exchanges suggests that parents and adult children remain vitally involved in
supportive exchanges in later life. What has not been examined is the long-term importance of patterns of intergen-
erational exchange for individual mental health and well-being. Using data drawn from the two waves of the Na-
tional Survey of Families and Households on adults aged SO and older (N = 2237, M^e
= 62.3), we tested hypotheses
derived from three theoretical explanations of the relationship between exchange patterns and psychological well-
being. Wefound strong evidencefor the importance of contingent exchanges between parents and adult children in
promoting older adults' psychological well-being. Whereas receiving contingent exchange has positive conse-
quences, noncontingent giving can have negative consequences around specific transitions in the lives of parents
and children.
THE importance of intergenerational family relation-
ships for the health and well-being of an individual
has been the concern of a growing body of research in the
past decade. This heightened interest is, in part, driven by
social changes in family structure, the changing economy,
and loss of confidence in the ability of social institutions to
continue to provide a safety net in times of need (Zarit &
Eggebeen, 1995). Despite this greater attention, we still
know relatively little about why individuals give. We do not
know the particular giving strategies individuals employ,
under what circumstances or with what conditions they
accept support from others, or the effectiveness of their
particular exchange strategy. The purpose of this article is
to address several of these unanswered questions. Specifi-
cally, we examine the linkage between the mental health of
older adults and three distinct patterns of intergenerational
exchanges.
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
There are three dominant theoretical perspectives on
why individuals give: social exchange theory (Homans,
1958; Thibaut & Kelley, 1959), equity theory (e.g., Walster,
Berscheid, & Walster, 1973), and exchange based on need
(Deutsch, 1975).
Social exchange theory is based upon economic princi-
ples of costs and rewards and the concept of reinforcement
from behavioral psychology (Homans, 1958; Shornack,
1986; Thibaut & Kelley, 1959). A basic premise is that so-
cial exchange and interaction will continue as long as that
interaction is seen as profitable; that is, where perceived re-
wards are seen to outweigh the costs to an individual; the
individual is thus "overbenefitted." These origins led to a
relatively mechanistic conception of exchange based heav-
ily upon an individual's perceptions of a particular relation-
ship and his or her ability (or inability) to acquire similar
benefits from other sources. It follows, then, that the most
satisfying relationships would be those from which an indi-
vidual was most overbenefitted. Individuals believed to
possess relatively fewer socially desirable resources, such
as elderly adults or those from other disadvantaged groups,
would be seen as poor partners for social exchange and in-
teraction and would be likely to have few "profitable" so-
cial relationships (Dowd, 1975, 1986). From this perspec-
tive, the purpose of social relationships is self-serving--to
gain the greatest relative benefit possible.
Empirical investigations of this theoretical explanation
for intergenerational transfers have been fairly limited.
Most studies are focused on determining how common this
strategy is rather than whether it is associated with well-
being. Cox and Rank (1992), using nationally representa-
tive data on American families, found that routine assis-
tance is more consistent with the exchange model than with
alternative specifications. Hogan, Eggebeen, and Clogg
(1993), using the same data, but employing quite different
measurement models, also found evidence of exchange re-
lationships in American families. Finally, Spitze and Logan
(1989) found evidence in their sample, drawn from the Al-
bany New York area, which is consistent with the idea that
women's investment in caregiving and kin keeping activi-
ties in their early and middle life course creates obligations
in men and children that lead to assistance in later life.
These patterns, of course, are what exchange theory would
predict.
Although there appears to be evidence that intergenera-
tional relationships in American families are carried on in a
fashion that is consistent with exchange theory, there have
been virtually no attempts to assess its "effectiveness" for
the health and well-being of individuals. A major reason
for this is that a careful assessment of this strategy places
great demands on data. With few exceptions, most data on
intergenerational ties are cross-sectional, which greatly
limits the chances of finding evidence for the effectiveness
P86

of this strategy. This is especially true when one considers
that both exchanges and psychological outcomes often
share a similar set of predictors. For example, a decline in
functional ability might be accompanied by both receipt of
more assistance and higher levels of depression, thus artifi-
cially inducing a negative correlation between exchange
and well-being. In one of the few explicit tests of this pat-
tern of exchanges which controlled for the effects of health,
functional ability, education, marital status, and proximity
to child of closest contact, McCulloch (1990) found ex-
change-type relations between aging parents and adult chil-
dren were not associated with a measure of morale among
the parents.
Equity theory represents a distinct approach to under-
standing intergenerational relationships. This theoretical
perspective suggests that relationships will be seen as most
satisfying when they are perceived as "balanced." Balanced
relationships are those in which an individual feels that
contributions to, and receptions from, a particular relation-
ship are about equal (Lerner, 1975; Walster, Walster, &
Berscheid, 1978). Similar to social exchange theory, this
perspective suggests that individuals will be dissatisfied
with relationships in which an individual receives less than
he or she contributes. In direct contrast to social exchange
theory, however, relationships in which an individual would
feel he or she has "overbenefitted" would also be seen as
unsatisfactory. Although it may not be clear why individu-
als would feel dissatisfied in relationships where they were
overbenefitted (Feeney, Peterson, & Noller, 1994), one pos-
sibility is that having intergenerational relationships that are
"unbalanced" this way may be seen as a threat to one's in-
dependence (McCulloch, 1990; Stoller, 1985). That is, the
inability to reciprocate assistance may undermine mental
health and/or well-being.
There is some evidence that exchange relationships func-
tion along lines that are consistent with this theory. Roberto
and Scott (1986) examined the relationship between equity
in specific older adult friendships and perceived distress
within the relationship. They found that inequitable rela-
tionships were associated with greater distress across both
affective and helping components of the friendship. Rook
(1987) found in her sample of older widowed women that
those who reported balanced exchanges with their adult
children and their friends felt less lonely. Similarly, Mutran
and Reitzes (1984), in their study of patterns of exchange
between elderly parents and their adult children, found that
greater assistance from adult children was related to nega-
tive affect and poorer health for the married sample. How-
ever, they found the opposite for the widowed group; they
received less help when in poor health and had fewer posi-
tive and more negative feelings. Finally, Stoller (1985) re-
ported that it was the inability to reciprocate, rather than
support received, which predicted lower morale in her sam-
ple of older adults.
A third theoretical explanation of patterns of intergenera-
tional support suggests that they are largely motivated by
need (Deutsch, 1975). The idea is that parents monitor the
well-being of their children (and children monitor the well-
being of their parents) and offer assistance when they per-
ceive that there is a need. We term support given in re-
sponse to an identified need or transition "contingent ex-
change," indicating that it is neither the exchange nor the
transition alone that matters, but rather the moderating ef-
fect of support given or received. This perspective has been
the de facto theory behind a good number of the quantita-
tive models of assistance rendered across generations (cf.
Eggebeen, 1992; Hogan et al., 1993). That is, modeling in-
tergenerational resource flows is largely (though not exclu-
sively) built around variables measuring the resources and
needs of each generation. This is also a standard theoretical
approach in economic theories of intergenerational trans-
fers of time and money (Becker, 1974; Eggebeen & Wil-
helm, 1995).
Despite the intuitive and theoretical appeal of this theory,
the empirical support is surprisingly mixed. Research using
cross-sectional survey data often reports patterns that are
much more complex than this theoretical approach would
suggest. For example, Hogan et al. (1993) found that
whereas individuals who had a preschool-aged child were
more likely to be receiving assistance than those without
children, those living in poverty were less likely to be in-
volved in exchange relationships than the non-poor. Fur-
thermore, there was no association between the health of
the respondent and the likelihood of receiving help. To be
sure, a number of other studies show that, by and large,
family members are responsive to the needs of other family
members (cf. Zarit & Eggebeen, 1995). However, it is sur-
prising that a large proportion of individuals in need fail to
receive help from their relatives (Hogan & Eggebeen, 1995;
Stoller & Pugliesi, 1991).
This underscores the pressing need for research on the
impact of exchange to address two considerations. First,
longitudinal research is necessary to disentangle the effects
of having a particular status from the effects of transitions
into and out of that status, because it is the latter which is of
primary interest developmentally. Second, and relatedly, it
is necessary to include predictors both of exchanges and
outcomes in order to avoid reaching an incorrect conclusion
about the importance of exchange for well-being, as Hogan
et al.'s (1993) example clearly illustrates.
Recent social-cognitive work on expectations for ex-
change and norms of reciprocity suggests that social ex-
change and equity perspectives may be inadequate to capture
supportive exchanges in long-term relationships (Davey,
1994; Davey & Norris, in press). Both older and younger
adults appear to indicate that contingent exchange best
characterizes their close relationships with specific others,
whereas social exchange is seen as most appropriate in
more distant relationships. It is interesting to note that older
adults appear to make these distinctions more strongly in
very close relationships than do younger adults.
In summary, empirical investigations of why individuals
give have failed to provide consistent support for any of
these theories. More significantly, evidence for the linkage
between a particular pattern of exchange and the well-being
of the individuals involved is mostly lacking. The purpose
of this article is to address these shortcomings by examin-
ing the relationship between each of these three approaches
and the mental health and well-being of a representative na-
tional sample of older adults, using longitudinal data.

RESEARCH QUESTIONS
This study, then, was designed to address two broad re-
search questions. First, do routine intergenerational ex-
changes have psychological consequences for older adults?
The gerontological literature is equivocal on the question of
whether or not support given or received, per se, has psy-
chological consequences for older adults. To address this
question, we attempt to rectify several potential competing
explanations that plague the majority of previous research
in this area. It is possible, for example, that variables such
as health status may predict both exchange and mental
health outcomes, making it appear as though those who re-
ceive the most assistance fare the poorest. Another issue
that we strive to address in this first question is whether
support can be considered as cause or consequence of a
particular mental health outcome (cf. Johnson, 1991). In
both cases, only a longitudinal perspective which attempts
to incorporate the range of variables associated with both
exchange and mental health variables can hope to disentan-
gle these complex relationships.
Second, is there a theoretically derived pattern of routine
intergenerational assistance which is most strongly associ-
ated with mental health outcomes for older adults? In this
section, we frame hypotheses derived from each of social
exchange theory, equity theory, and the contingent ex-
change perspective. Social exchange theory predicts that
older adults who receive more than they give to adult chil-
dren will have more positive mental health outcomes, such
as lower levels of depressive symptoms and greater life sat-
isfaction. This is analogous to proposing that overbenefit-
ting has positive consequences, whereas underbenefitting is
deleterious. Equity theory predicts that older adults who
receive amounts of assistance roughly equivalent to the
support they give to an adult child will fare better than
those who are in imbalanced exchanges, where they experi-
ence either overbenefit or underbenefit. The contingent ex-
change perspective predicts that older adults who experi-
ence a need will benefit from receiving assistance from
their adult child, and will suffer from providing assistance
to their adult child under the same circumstances. Similarly,
providing support to a child who has experienced a need
will be beneficial whereas receiving support from the same
child will be deleterious.
The focus of the current study differs in many respects
from much other work in this area and, as a result, we hope
will provide a more rigorous test of the psychological con-
sequences for older adults of intergenerational exchanges.
Specifically, we examine both levels and patterns of routine
intergenerational assistance between older parents and a
specific, randomly selected adult child. Because most par-
ents have more than one child, this study is thus likely to
underestimate the total psychological consequences of in-
tergenerational exchanges for older adults. To disentangle
the effects of prior levels of exchange and psychological
outcomes, we rely on longitudinal data in our analyses. Fi-
nally, our models include a large number of variables that
have been identified in the literature as correlates of inter-
generational exchanges, mental health outcomes, or both
(e.g., Eggebeen, 1992; Mancini & Blieszner, 1989; Silver-
stein & Bengtson, 1991, 1994; Zarit & Eggebeen, 1995).
As such, they serve as potential competing explanations for
an observed relationship between intergenerational ex-
changes and older adults' psychological well-being, and
their effects should be controlled.
METHOD
Data
This study was conducted using data from the 1987-1988
and 1992-1994 waves of the National Survey of Families
and Households (NSFH), a national sample survey covering
a wide variety of issues on American family life. It involved
initial interviews with 13,008 respondents, oversampling
single-parent families, stepfamilies, recently married cou-
ples, and cohabiting couples. The second wave of this survey,
conducted 5 years later, re-interviewed 10,008 individuals.
Sample
Participants were 2,237 individuals (56% female), aged
50 and older (MAge
= 62.3 years; SD = 9.3; range 50-95),
who completed both study interviews and had at least one
child, aged 19 or older at the time of the initial interview.
African Americans comprised 8.5% of the current sample,
and 5.3% were Hispanic. Mean reported total household in-
come was $37,458, and the mean education level was 11.8
years (SD = 3.6). Children of the respondents were equally
divided between males and females (50% female) with a
mean age of 40.9 years (SD = 10.4; range 24-76) and an
average educational level of 13.7 years (SD = 3.0).
Attrition Across Waves
Those present at both waves of data collection differed in
several ways from those who completed only the original in-
terview. Specifically, they were more likely to be younger,
by approximately 5.6 years and, as a result, more likely to
have a coresident child at the initial time of interview. They
also had an average of an extra year of formal education, re-
ported slightly better self-rated health, and had higher fam-
ily incomes.
Measures
Outcomes.--Three primary outcome variables were con-
sidered in the current study. Depressive symptoms were
measured using a 12-item version of the CES-D scale (five
items from the Depressed Affect scale and seven from the
Somatic scale; Radloff, 1977), with scaling modified such
that participants reported the number of days in the previ-
ous week during which they had experienced each of the
symptoms. For the current sample and scaling, internal con-
sistency was very high (a = .92 at both waves). Another 3-
item scale measured the extent to which participants re-
ported experiencing long-term depressive symptomatology
(i.e., lasting 2 weeks or more) in the previous 6 months.
Cronbach's alpha of .69 for this scale indicates acceptable
internal consistency, given the brevity of the scale, and its
dichotomous indicators. The final outcome of interest was a
single-item global life satisfaction variable from the Insti-
tute for Social Research at the University of Michigan.
INTERGENERATIONAL EXCHANGES AND MENTAL HEALTH P89
Background characteristics.--To control for competing
explanations of a relationship between exchange and well-
being, a large number of background characteristics of par-
ents and offspring were included in the current analyses.
Parent characteristics controlled for included age in years,
sex (0 = male, 1 = female), race (dummy coded as African
American, and as Hispanic, with non-Hispanic White as the
reference category), geographic region (dummy coded as
North Central, South, and as West, with North East as the
reference category), urban/rural location (dummy coded as
Rural but adjacent to urban, and as Rural and not-adjacent
to urban, with Urban as the reference category), educational
attainment (measured in years of formal education), log of
total household dollar income, and poverty status (coded 1
if household income was below one-half of the median in-
come for the year of interview, and 0 otherwise). Relevant
child characteristics included gender (0 = male, 1 = fe-
male), educational attainment (measured in years of formal
education), and number of children (respondent's grand-
children). Several relationship characteristics were also
controlled, including log of distance in miles between par-
ent and child, perceived relationship quality ("How would
you describe your relationship with X"; from 1 = very poor
to 7 = excellent), and number of respondent's adult chil-
dren. We used the log of distance as a predictor in our mod-
els to reduce skewness and kurtosis of this variable. Un-
transformed, skewness and kurtosis were 4.96 and 33.96 at
Time 1, and 5.28 and 38.26 at Time 2. Transformed, skew-
ness and kurtosis were -0.77 and -0.39 at Time 1, and
-0.84 and -0.45 at Time 2, indicating that our transforma-
tions were effective.
Parent transitions.--Five potential transitions in the lives
of older parents were examined. Each was coded as 1 if it
had occurred and 0 otherwise. These included loss of
spouse, due to divorce or widowhood; change in health sta-
tus; significant (defined as 20% or more) decline in income;
and transition from working to not working, due to retire-
ment or unemployment. Inclusion of self-rated health status
("Compared with other people your age, how would you
describe your health"; from 1 = very poor to 5 = excellent)
and functional limitations on the Activities of Daily Living
(ADLs; coded as the sum of limitations with caring for per-
sonal needs such as bathing, dressing, eating or going to the
bathroom; moving about inside the house; day-to-day
household tasks; climbing a flight of stairs; walking six
blocks; doing heavy work like shoveling snow or heavy
housecleaning; and working for pay, such as the amount or
type of work done) at both times of measurement led to
multicollinearity problems with the regression models, and
so composite (factor) scores were created through principal
components analysis, with higher scores indicating better
health. In each case, a transition reflects a change in status
which occurred between the first and second interviews.
Child transitions.--Three child transitions were of inter-
est. These included birth of a grandchild, loss of a spouse
due to divorce or widowhood, or becoming coresident with
the parent. Again, transitions reflected changes that had oc-
curred between the two interviews.
Intergenerational exchanges.--Table 1 lists the exchange
items asked at each time of measurement in the NSFH.
Support given to adult children at each interview was mea-
sured as the proportion of items which a parent had given to
his or her child in the preceding month. Support received
from adult children at each interview was measured as the
proportion of items which a parent had received from his or
her child in the preceding month. From these four items,
social exchange was calculated as overbenefit, or (support
received - support given). This measure was high when
parents were overbenefitted, and low when parents were
underbenefitted. Equity was measured as "imbalance," or
(support received - support given)2 (cf. McCulloch, 1990;
Walster et al., 1973). This measure was high when parents
were either overbenefitted or underbenefitted, and low
when parents were neither overbenefitted nor underbene-
fitted. This measure is equivalent to the equation presented
by Walster et al. (1973), in the absence of both partners'
perceptions.
An important limitation of the present study is that differ-
ent and incompletely overlapping exchange items were
asked at each time of measurement. Financial assistance is
included in the initial interview, for example, but not at the
second interview. Likewise, three exchange items at the ini-
tial interview address issues of emotional support, whereas
this is captured by only a single item in the follow-up inter-
view. Fortunately, however, the same content areas were
covered for giving and receiving assistance within each

wave, permitting calculation of the balance of exchanges
within each wave. As a result, comparisons between mea-
sures of giving and receiving are valid within each time
of interview, but not across time. For this reason, we in-
clude measures of support given and received at the time
of initial interview in our models to control for past levels
of support exchanged. As a result, we are modeling de-
viations above and below the level of exchange predicted
by prior levels, rather than the change in specific types
of support exchanged. Clearly, this situation is far from
ideal for studying developmental phenomena, but still pro-
vides an important perspective on intergenerational ex-
changes over time, specifically that of current status, con-
trolling for prior levels.
RESULTS
We were primarily interested in examining the effects of
intergenerational exchanges on individual outcomes net of
what could be explained by respondent background charac-
teristics, and factors which might be responsible for ex-
change itself. For this reason, we adopted a 3-step hierar-
chical approach. In the first model, the outcome was
predicted from its value at the initial interview to control
for the stability in the score. In the second model, all con-
trol variables, transitions, and main effects of exchange
given and received were entered into the model to deter-
mine whether they added significantly to prediction of the
Time 2 outcomes. In the final step, variables representing
the pattern of exchange were entered into the equation to
determine whether or not the pattern of exchange added to
the prediction net of the main effects in the model. To avoid
problems with multicollinearity in tests of the contingent
exchange perspective, separate analyses were performed for
parent transitions and child transitions.
Baseline Model
The baseline models for each outcome, including respon-
dent background characteristics, and variables to control for
levels of exchange, are shown in Table 2.
Depressive symptoms.--Parent characteristics related to
greater depressive symptoms included being more de-
pressed at the initial interview, being younger, and having
lower income. Being Hispanic was associated with lower
depression. Parental transition variables related to greater
depression were losing a spouse since the initial interview,
and experiencing a decline in health status. Two relation-
ship characteristics predicted lower depression: having a
better relationship with one's adult child, and receiving less
support from the child at Time 2, net of Time 1 levels of
giving and receiving. No child characteristics or transitions
were associated with parental depression.
Long-term depression.--Longer term depression was as-
sociated with being younger, being female, losing a spouse,
and having a decline in health status. No relationship or
child characteristics made unique contributions to long-
term depression. However, the birth of a grandchild was as-
sociated with significantly less long-term depression.
Life satisfaction.--Other than previous level of life satis-
faction, only a single parent characteristic was predictive of
life satisfaction. Specifically, those living in the western
states reported lower life satisfaction. Losing a spouse and
poorer health status both predicted lower life satisfaction.
Quality of relationship with the adult child was predictive
of greater life satisfaction. As with depressive symptoms,
no characteristics of the child or child transitions predicted
parental life satisfaction.
Social Exchange
Social exchange theory predicts that the extent to which
an individual receives in excess of what they give will be
associated with more positive outcomes. To test this, we
added extent of overbenefit to the baseline model. As seen
in Table 3, extent of overbenefit did add significantly to the
prediction of both depressive symptoms and long-term de-
pression. However, the results are in direct contrast to the
predictions of social exchange theory. The extent to which
parents receive in excess of what they give to their child is
associated with greater depressive symptoms and more
long-term depression. Thus, while overbenefitting does pre-
dict levels of depression, it acts in the opposite direction to
what theory would predict, once factors accounting for the
exchange itself are controlled.
Equity Theory
Equity theory suggests that any imbalance in a relation-
ship, either over or underbenefit, will be associated with
greater distress in the form of greater depression and
lower life satisfaction. We tested this theory in two ways.
First, we added imbalance to the baseline equation to de-
termine whether the prediction of depression and life sat-
isfaction was significantly improved. This is analogous to
including an interaction term in the model without includ-
ing the main effects. Second, we added overbenefit and
imbalance (overbenefit2) to the model together to deter-
mine whether underbenefitting was also stressful, treating
overbenefit and imbalance as linear and quadratic terms,
respectively (cf. McCulloch, 1990). The rationale behind
this approach is to localize the effect of imbalance. If it is
only underbenefitting (or overbenefitting) which predicts
subsequent mental health outcomes, then only the linear
trend will be significant. If both underbenefitting and
overbenefitting are important, then the quadratic trend will
be significant.
Alone, greater imbalance in the parent-child relationship
was associated with more depressive symptoms as equity
theory would predict but not long-term depression or life
satisfaction. When imbalance was added to overbenefit, it
made no unique contribution to the prediction. Thus, we
found support only for equity theory's prediction of negative
consequences of overbenefitting, not for underbenefitting.
Contingent Exchange
As noted above, separate hierarchical regression models
were tested to examine the effects of contingent exchanges
around parent and adult child transitions. Results for the
parent moderator variables appear in Table 4. Results from
analyses of child moderator variables are shown in Table 5.

Depressive symptoms.--Addition of the 8 interaction
terms significantly improved the prediction of depressive
symptoms. As can be seen in Table 4, there were two sig-
nificant interaction terms. Individuals who experienced a
decline in health status and received greater amounts of
support from an adult child than would be predicted from
prior levels also experienced fewer depressive symptoms.
Likewise, those who experienced a significant decline in in-
come and also received a greater amount of support than
predicted from prior levels experienced fewer depressive
symptoms. Thus, contingent receipt of assistance appears to
moderate the negative effects of declining health/functional
status, and a substantial decline in income.
Child moderator variables were also important for older
adults' depressive symptoms. Parents who experienced the
birth of a grandchild and received more support than would
be predicted based on previous levels also reported lower
levels of depression (see Table 5).

Long-term depression.--The addition of parent contin-
gent exchange moderator variables also added significantly
to the prediction of long-term depression, yielding three
significant interaction terms. Parents who experienced their
own spousal loss or the transition out of employment, and
who gave more to their adult children than would be pre-
dicted by prior levels of support reported higher levels of
long-term depression. Thus, this noncontingent giving may
have negative consequences for older parents. As with de-
pressive symptoms, those who received a greater than pre-
dicted amount of support in the face of declining health had
lower levels of long-term depression. Addition of child
moderator variables did not add significantly to the predic-
tion of long-term depression.
Life satisfaction.--Addition of moderator variables for
parental transitions did not add significantly to the predic-
tion of parental life satisfaction. However, two child moder-

ator terms were important for predicting parents' life satis-
faction. Older adults had greater life satisfaction around the
birth of a grandchild both when they reported giving less to
their adult child than would be predicted on the basis of
previous support, and when they reported receiving more
from the adult child than would be predicted on the basis of
previous support. Thus, we again have evidence that contin-
gent exchange has positive consequences, whereas non-
contingent exchange (i.e., greater than average levels of
giving) has negative consequences.
DISCUSSION
The goal of this study was to examine the relationship
between specific patterns of intergenerational exchanges
and older adults' psychological well-being. In several re-
spects, this study is unique. First, we make use of longitudi-
nal data. This is an important consideration because, if sup-
port is given in response to an event in the lives of parents,
then those with the greatest need (and poorest outcome)
may be receiving the greatest amount of support. This will
artificially induce a negative correlation between support
received and mental health, making it appear as though re-
ceipt of support is associated with poorer mental health.
Second, we focus on a single parent-child dyad within
each family, selected at random. This permits us to examine
aspects of a specific relationship over time. Again, this is an
important consideration because each of the three theoreti-
cal perspectives we test makes a statement about how indi-
vidual relationships function over time. Aggregating across
a group of relationships, such as all parent-child dyads, can
serve to mask the process that is going on in any single re-
lationship, and downplay the variability which can be seen
within any particular family.
Finally, our study controls for many other variables
which may affect both exchange and outcomes. The im-
portance of controlling for competing explanations for
observed relationships between exchange and outcomes
INTERGENERATIONAL EXCHANGES AND MENTAL HEALTH P93
cannot be underestimated if we are to understand the con-
tribution of exchange to older adults' mental health. Failing
health, declining income, loss of spouse, gender, education,
and a variety of other factors, have all been shown to pre-
dict both exchange and mental health. To study the role of
supportive exchange for mental health, it is important that
as many as possible of these extraneous influences be con-
trolled. Use of a large, nationally representative data source
permitted us to do this to a greater extent than has generally
been possible in the past.
Our results provide negative support for social exchange
theory. Contrary to predictions, the extent of overbenefit,
given prior patterns of support given and received, was as-
sociated with higher levels of depression, both short- and
long-term. This is consistent with the finding in the baseline
model that receipt of assistance at Time 2, net of expecta-
tions based on Time 1 levels of receiving, is also associated
with greater depressive symptoms. It would appear from
these data that there is more to satisfactory social relation-
ships than whether one is "getting" more than "giving."
It appears as though parents who are overbenefitted tend
to suffer psychologically. Apparently, it is not simply the
state of dependency itself which is responsible for these
findings, because major causes of this are controlled in our
models. That is, the higher levels of depression observed
cannot be attributed to greater assistance received around
declining health, as both assistance and health appear in the
model. In addition, because we control for past levels of
support given and received, these findings suggest that it is
people who are overbenefitted to a greater extent than
would be predicted from prior levels of exchange who ex-
perience negative psychological consequences. Thus, these
findings cannot be attributed either to high or low levels of
exchange alone, but rather the extent of overbenefitting.
From a psychological vantage point, these findings are
intriguing. Within the gerontological literature, it is often
assumed that support given by parents to children earlier in
life will be reciprocated later in life, creating an equitable
situation when considered across the entire adult life span
(e.g., Antonucci & Akiyama, 1987). Gerontological litera-
ture generally supports this idea, indicating that parents
tend to provide more support to children than they receive
until very late in life (Morgan, Schuster, & Butler, 1991).
To the extent that this is true, these findings suggest this
may have developmental implications for older adults'
mental health. That is, even having this support bank to
draw from may not always be sufficient to protect older
adults from potentially negative consequences of being
overbenefitted. This issue is taken up in greater detail, how-
ever, when the contingent exchange perspective is dis-
cussed below.
Equity theory suggests that individuals who are either
overbenefitted or underbenefitted will experience poorer
mental health outcomes than those whose relationships
roughly balance support given with support received. Our
test of this model indicates that underbenefitting is not as-
sociated with any deleterious mental health consequences,
but overbenefitting is.
In contrast to previous work on the equity perspective,
which sought to explain why being overbenefitted would
have negative implications, this study suggests that the lack
of importance for being underbenefitted may be what begs
explanation. This finding appears to reinforce the psycho-
logical importance of being able to reciprocate within a
specific parent-child relationship (Roberto & Scott, 1986;
Rook, 1987; Stoller, 1985). These findings also underscore
the importance of considering both support given and sup-
port received. Whereas Silverstein, Chen, and Heller (1996)
found that receiving support at levels that were very high or
very low was associated with negative mental health out-
comes, the current findings extend this idea to suggest that
negative consequences are possible whenever the levels of
support received exceed levels of support given. Because
we know that the situation of being underbenefitted is more
likely to arise in later life, these findings also suggest im-
portant developmental consequences for intergenerational
exchanges. For example, although individuals are more
likely to be underbenefitted in relationships with their chil-
dren across most of adulthood, the reverse is true in very
late life. This might lead us to conclude that, with age,
older adults can expect to experience negative outcome as a
result of both declining health and the assistance they re-
ceive from their children. Again, consideration of the con-
tingent exchange perspective below may help to reconcile
these findings.
One reviewer suggested that these findings might be at-
tributable to differential effects of overbenefit in emotional
versus tangible domains. Specifically, it was suggested that
it may be good to be overbenefitted with regard to emo-
tional support, but harmful to be overbenefitted in instru-
mental domains. To the extent that instrumental support
items dominate our measure of overbenefitting, this is in-
deed a plausible interpretation that should be examined in
greater detail in future research.
Examination of contingent patterns of exchange begins
to shed some light on the circumstances under which it is
important to give and receive support in parent-child rela-
tionships. First and foremost, our results suggest that ex-
change has important consequences when it occurs around
specific changes in the lives of both older parents and their
adult children. In the current study, we found evidence for
the importance of exchanges around widowhood, decline in
health, significant drop in income, transition out of employ-
ment, and the birth of a grandchild.
There are at least three reasons why addition of the con-
tingent exchange moderators only modestly improved pre-
diction of parental outcomes. To begin with, interaction ef-
fects are notoriously difficult to find in non-experimental
contexts. Interactions and main effects are usually corre-
lated, which reduces the unique (i.e., uncorrelated) contri-
bution of any single interaction term. Additionally, unrelia-
bility of measurement is compounded with the construction
of multiplicative composites, which sets an upper limit on
the extent to which interactions can add to a model. A sec-
ond important consideration is that, in terms of explained
variance, addition of the moderating effects accounts for
between 1.5% and 5% of the reliable variance in the mod-
els, suggesting that their unique relative contribution is ac-
tually quite reasonable. The last consideration we wish to
raise is that these effects necessarily under-represent the in-
P94 DAVEYAND EGGEBEEN
fluence of intergenerational exchanges, as they only incor-
porate information from a single parent-child relationship.
We are currently developing models which will provide
valid estimates of these phenomena using information from
relationships with all adult children. We thus expect that the
net importance of contingent exchange is likely to be con-
siderably higher than we can observe with the design of the
current study.
We find evidence that support given and received around
each of the parental transitions and birth of a grandchild
have important moderating influences on the effects of the
transitions themselves. The interpretation of these findings
is consistent for each of the significant interactions. Specifi-
cally, receiving a greater amount of support around a de-
cline in health, substantial drop in income, or the birth of a
grandchild, than would be predicted on the basis of prior
levels of exchange, is associated with more positive and
less negative mental health outcomes over a 5-year period.
That is, we find strong evidence for the importance of re-
ceiving contingent support from adult children..
Relatedly, the noncontingent provision of support to an
adult child (i.e., greater than expected amounts of support
with the loss of a spouse or birth of a grandchild) appears to
have deleterious consequences for older adults. Normative
amounts of support given and received are to be expected
around any transition in the lives of parents and their chil-
dren. Parents experiencing a transition who receive more
than these amounts fare better; those who receive less fare
more poorly. Parents who provide greater than average lev-
els of support to adult children around specific transitions
may fare more poorly than those who provide less support
under the same circumstances.
These findings suggest that individuals who find them-
selves in unusually supportive relationships fare well,
whereas those who have exceptional demands placed on
them by their social relationships in times of need may fare
poorly; certainly more poorly than those who do not experi-
ence such demands.
Findings from the contingent exchange perspective can
help us to make sense of the results from the social ex-
change and equity perspectives. It is not giving or receiving
in and of themselves that affect mental health, but rather the
context in which they are given or received. If support oc-
curs in a fashion that is consistent with the circumstances, it
is likely to exert a positive influence on older adults' mental
health and well-being. If support, at least support provided
by older parents, is inconsistent with circumstances, it can
be expected to have negative consequences. Thus, over-
benefitting is not detrimental when it occurs for a specific
reason (such as the loss of a spouse, or around declining
health), and underbenefitting can have negative conse-
quences when it occurs at an inappropriate time.
It seems somewhat surprising that we did not find more
evidence for the psychological importance of contingent
giving of support. In part, this may be the result of a rela-
tively insensitive measure of well-being, where we would
be most likely to see such an effect. Additionally, we have a
relatively limited amount of information about transitions
in the lives of adult children, and so may not be tapping the
right circumstances under which giving support matters.
We have identified a set of circumstances under which
contingent receipt of support has beneficial consequences.
To what extent does this actually play out in parent child re-
lationships? We find encouraging evidence on two fronts.
First, individuals tend to report that they anticipate receiv-
ing support in a fashion consistent with the contingent ex-
change perspective (Davey & Norris, in press). This is true
of very close relationships generally, and there is also evi-
dence that older adults may hold these expectations to a
greater degree than do younger adults. Second, we find lon-
gitudinal evidence that children do actually "step to the
fore" when parents experience a need, and that this is likely
to be true regardless of parents' anticipated support from
adult children as opposed to other sources (Eggebeen &
Davey, 1997). This is good news because it suggests that
parents are highly likely to receive support in a fashion that
may actually help to protect them from the negative conse-
quences of dependency.
Future research will need to explore ways of incorporat-
ing information about all parent-child relationships in a
fashion that does not lose sight of the fact that exchange is a
property of a relationship. In this way, it will be possible to
estimate the total effects of intergenerational support for
mental health and well-being. We will also need to explore a
wider range of domains of intergenerational assistance and
identify the circumstances under which one type of support
can substitute for another. Ideally, future research will also
incorporate information from multiple family members, as
such data become more widely available to researchers.
There seems to be little doubt that the important connec-
tions between older parents and their adult children serve
important developmental functions for both generations.
One of the most consistent findings of the recent burst of
scholarly attention being given to intergenerational rela-
tions is that family members remain vitally involved with
each other as they age. However, it is also evident from this
research that the nature of this involvement is more compli-
cated than many of our theories suggest. This is clearly evi-
dent in this article. We find good evidence that patterns of
exchange have important implications for the psychological
health of aging parents. Nevertheless, many questions re-
main. Our data constrain us to a 5-year window, yet it is en-
tirely plausible that parents and children conduct their ex-
changes with a much longer "time horizon" in mind, which
may have different consequences than are evident in the
short run. Future work should also investigate the implica-
tions of gender differences. That is, do men and women
use, think about, and react to exchange patterns differently?
It is also entirely conceivable that individuals employ
"mixed" exchange strategies, depending on what is being
given or received. That is, parents and children may be
more likely to engage an "exchange" strategy when money
is the commodity being passed between generations,
whereas contingent giving may be more likely employed
when there are family emergencies. Finally, patterns of ex-
change, and their consequences, may be partially contin-
gent on the life courses of both parents and children. Future
work investigating the consequences of social exchanges
for the well-being of individuals would do well to address
these questions.
