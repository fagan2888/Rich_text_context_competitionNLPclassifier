Propensity Score Estimates in Multilevel
Models for Causal Inference
Patricia Eckardt
b Background: Teenage obesity is a national epidemic that re-
quires school- and community-based initiatives to support
healthy behaviors of students regarding exercise and nu-
trition to decrease the prevalence.
b Objectives: The aim of this study was to demonstrate a meth-
odology for an estimation of causal effects of the adoption of
healthy behaviors with a potential outcomes approach within
a multilevel treatment setting of school program adoption of
a socially supportive environment.
b Methods: Propensity score estimates within a multilevel model
provided causal estimates of the impact of the adoption of
health habits by students within supportive school environ-
ments (SSEs) and non-SSEs. A potential outcomes approach
to causal modeling was shown with a secondary analysis
of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
study. The student participants consisted of 13,854 adoles-
cent students, with an accompanying sample of 164 school
administrators.
b Results: The effect of healthy eating habits in an SSE was
a statistically nonsignificant decrease in body mass index
(BMI). The effect of healthy eating habits in a non-SSE was
a statistically nonsignificant increase in BMI. The difference
between the healthy habit practices for students in support-
ive and nonsupportive schools was a resultant difference in
BMI of 0.3484.
b Discussion: The results demonstrate a difference in causal
effects of eating habits in different school settings. Further
research regarding causal effects of student habits and
school programs is indicated.

Teenage obesity is a national epidemic (Ben-Sefer,
Ben-Natan, & Ehrenfeld, 2009). Approximately 17%
(12.5 million) of children and teens in the United States are
obese (Ogden, Carroll, Curtin, Lamb, & Flegal, 2010). It has
been hypothesized that students who follow healthy habits
regarding exercise and nutrition decrease their chances of
becoming obese in adulthood (Liou, Liou, & Chang, 2010).
Some school policymakers and nurses believe that the adop-
tion of a supportive school environment (SSE) program, one
that includes increased fruits and vegetables available at the
cafeteria and a variety of available forms of exercise and re-
creation, increase opportunities for students to practice healthy
habits and decrease their chances of developing obesity
(Cassady, Vogt, Oto-Kent, Mosley, & Lincoln, 2006; Vitale,
2010). Body mass index (BMI) is the current standard
measure of obesity in adolescents (Lin & Lam, 2011; Liou
et al., 2010). However, a standardized BMI z score often is
considered a more accurate measure of an individual teen's
obesity (Boylan et al., 2010; Rausch, Perito, & Hametz, 2011).
Multiple observational studies have examined these hypotheses
with conflicting results (Liou et al., 2010).
An observational study, like an experimental study, is
an empirical study conducted to explain a cause-and-effect
relationship between two variables (Cochran, 1965; Little &
Rubin, 2000: Rosenbaum, 2002; Rubin, 1997). In nursing
literature, the term ``quasi-experimental study'' is used more
commonly than observational study to describe a study
that lacks the critical causal element of random assignment
(Guo & Fraser, 2010). In Clayton, Chin, Blackburn, and
Echeverria's (2010) prospective quasi-experimental study, a
difference was found in obesity rates between groups after
a healthy habits program was offered at school. Fulkerson
et al. (2010) and Hollar et al. (2010) did not find a signif-
icant difference in means of postintervention BMI z score
between groups with healthy habits at home and school in-
tervention. Randomized and multilevel randomized control
trials to study the effect of healthy habit interventions on
adolescents' BMI (de Heer, Koehly, Pederson, & Morera,
2011) and BMI z score (DeBar et al., 2011; Dzewaltowski
et al., 2010) were equivocal in findings.
To estimate the causal effect of students' healthy habits
on their development of obesity in young adulthood and
the effect of an SSE on students' practice of healthy habits, a
multilevel potential outcomes model is required to account
for the natural nesting of the teenage students within the
schools they attend. Multilevel models are also known as
hierarchical models, mixed effect models, and random coef-
ficient models (Albright, 2007; Albright & Marinova, 2010;
Laird & Ware, 1982; Muthen & Muthen, 2012; Rasbash,
Steele, Browne, & Goldstein, 2009; Raudenbush & Bryk,
2002; Singer, 1998; Singer & Willett, 2003). Multilevel model-
ing of students within school settings frames the research
within the socioecological theory by considering social and

environmental factors in which the students are nested nat-
urally (Maclean et al., 2010). Multilevel modeling also allows
for variance component estimates to be examined explicitly
at each level of the proposed model (Albright, 2007; Albright
& Marinova, 2010; Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002; Singer,
1998; Singer & Willett, 2003).
A potential outcomes framework at each level of the
multilevel model allows for causal inference regarding these
factors and not simply comparison across groups (Pearl,
2003, 2010). This framework accounts for the probabilistic
mechanism of treatment assignment that observational stud-
ies and most random experiments usually do not. Assign-
ment to treatment in an observational study is not random,
although sampling from a population of interest often is;
whereas assignment to treatment in random experiments is
assigned randomly, yet sampling from the population of in-
terest is not a random process (Little & Rubin, 2000). Pro-
pensity score estimates allow for potential outcomes inference
by accounting for manipulation of treatment assignment.
There can be no causal inference without manipulation of
treatment (Rubin, 1986).
Rubin's (1974) counterfactual causal model approaches
causal modeling with a fundamental assumption of poten-
tial outcomes (Angrist & Pischke, 2008; Rosenbaum, 2002;
Rubin, 1974). This theory asserts that there is one potential
outcome associated with each treatment a subject may receive.
For the following example, Y denotes an individual subject's
potential outcome and Z denotes treatment assignment. If
there are two alternate treatments (a binary treatment con-
dition), then each subject has two potential outcomes repre-
sented commonly in the potential outcomes literature as
Y(0) and Y(1). Specifically, Y(0) is the outcome for a subject
who does not receive the treatment (i.e., Z = 0), whereas
Y(1) is the outcome if the subject does receive the treatment
(i.e., Z = 1). However, one never gets to observe both of
these potential outcomes, as the subject can receive only one
treatment at a time (Rubin, 2004). Therefore, the causal
effect Y(1) j Y(0) cannot be estimated for an individual,
but only an average effect for a group of people.
In a randomized experiment, the observed outcomes of
the subjects in the sample can be used to estimate an average
treatment effect conditioned on treatment assigned. An un-
biased estimate of the average treatment effect E[Yi
(1) j
Yi
(0)] = E[Yi
(1)] j E[Yi
(0)] within an observed population
sample is the difference in observed outcomes in the two
distinct treatment groups. Therefore, in a randomized exper-
iment, if Z stands for treatment assignment, then the aver-
age treatment effect E[Yi
(1)] j E[Yi
(0)] can be estimated as
E[Yi
(1)] = E[Yi
(1)|Zi
= 1] and E[Yi
(0)] = E[Yi
(0)|Zi
= 0]. One
can then obtain an unbiased estimate of the average treat-
ment effect by estimating E[Yi
(1)] with Y
j
Z=1
and E[Yi
(0)]
with Y
j
Z=0
.
The assumptions of the potential outcomes model are ig-
norability of treatment assignment and stable unit treatment
value. Treatment assignment is ignorable when the potential
outcomes are independent of the treatment variable, as is
the case with randomized assignment to treatment (Rubin,
2004). The stable unit treatment value (SUTVA) is the as-
sumption that there is only one potential outcome for each
subject associated with the policy or treatment adopted,
with no effect on an individual subject's potential outcome
due to the policy or treatment given another subject (Rubin,
1986). The assumption of SUTVA at the school level is
plausible because schools in the proposed nationally sam-
pled data set are located in distinct communities with dif-
ferent geographic conditions; have various combinations of
socioeconomic levels, governmental resources, and political
affiliations in the community profiles; and span the conti-
nental United States. Here, an assumption that the identities
and treatment assignments of other schools are uninforma-
tive about student i's outcomes holds (SUTVA assumption
at the school level).
However, Rubin (1990) cautioned that SUTVA becomes
problematic when treatments are given to children who in-
teract with one another, as in an observational study wherein
student-level treatment is nested within school-level program
adoption. To account for the possible violation of a strict
interpretation of SUTVA at the student level within a multi-
level setting, the Hong and Raudenbush (2006) relaxed
form of SUTVA can be applied. For a binary treatment, let
zi
= 1 if student i practices healthy habits and zi
= 0 if the
student does not. Then, given N units overall in a school,
there is a 1 Â N vector of possible treatment assignments
z = (z1
, z2
, ..., zN
) = (zi
, z_i
), wherein z_i
is the 1 Â (N j 1)
vector of treatment assignments with zi
removed, for
Zi
2f0; 1g; i ¼ 1; :::; N. Under these set conditions, subject i
has 2N potential outcomes, Yi
(z), corresponding to all pos-
sible treatment assignments of the N subjects.
A contrast between any two of the 2N potential outcomes
for a given subject is a causal effect. The SUTVA is a dis-
tinctive case wherein Yi
(z) K Yi
(zi
, z_i
) = Yi
(zi
), demonstrat-
ing that an individual student's potential outcome, given all
other student treatments, remains the same under SUTVA.
To summarize the school program adoption information in
a way that will be useful for average causal estimates, the
impact of z (treatment assignment) on a single subject's po-
tential outcome can be modeled as operating through zi
(individual's treatment assignment) as well as through a
simple function of z_i
, which will be denoted as v(z), the
treatment assignments of all other students within an indi-
vidual's school, except the individual's assignment. This is
represented as
^
Yi
ðzÞ K ^
Yi
ðzi
; zÀi
Þ ¼ ^
Yi
½zi
; vðzÞ ð1Þ
E{Y[z,v(z)] jY[z¶,v(z¶)]} is a generic causal estimand,
wherein z and z¶ are alternative treatment assignments for
an individual and z and z¶ are alternative treatment as-
signments for all individuals within that group (Hong &
Raudenbush, 2006). For the purposes of the SSE policy, let
v(z) = 1 if a school is an SSE policy school and v(z) = 0 if
this is not the case. Now, Y(z,v(z)) can take on four pos-
sible values: Y(1,1), Y(0,1), Y(1,0), and Y(0,0).
Therefore, the potential outcomes for an individual
student i attending a school j, denoted by Yij
(zij
, vj
), could
take on four values: Yij
(1,1), Yij
(0,1), Yij
(1,0), and Yij
(0,0).
For example, Yij
(1,1) represents the potential outcome of a
student i who practices healthy habits from an SSE school,
and Yij
(1,0) is the potential outcome of a student i who
practices healthy habits from a non-SSE policy school.
Through the use of the relaxed form of SUTVA outlined
above and the propensity score estimates for a potential
outcomes framework of causal estimates (Rosenbaum &

Rubin, 1984) outlined in the next section, causal effects of
treatment on a student-level outcome variable of interest
can be estimated. This causal modeling methodology allows
school assignment and peer treatments to affect potential
outcomes within a framework that accounted for the natural
nesting of the data and did not violate assumptions required
for these estimates.
Supportive school environment policies are not assigned
at random to schools, and students within schools are not
assigned at random to be practice of healthy habits, so the
ignorability of treatment assignment assumption must be
considered. A propensity score is the conditioning on covar-
iates of an observed probability for receiving the treatment.
As such, if there is no hidden bias, then the conditional dis-
tribution of treatment assignment is uniform and treatment
assignment is ignorable (Rosenbaum, 2002).
Let X be a vector of student-level covariates and W be a
vector of school-level covariates. W includes the school-level
aggregates of student-level covariates such as the demographic
makeup of students attending a school. Causal inferences
are possible if treatment assignments are ignorable within
levels of covariates (wherein X = x and W = w) for schools
such that
E½Yðz; 3ÞjZ ¼ z; V ¼ v; X ¼ x; W ¼ w
¼ E½Yðz; vÞjX ¼ x; W ¼ w ð2Þ
In this case, the conditional average causal effect E[Y(z,
v)|X = x,W = w] j E[Y(z¶, v¶)|X = x, W = w] is equivalent
to the observed data estimand, E[Y(z,v)|Z = z, V = v, X = x,
W = w] j E[Y(z¶,v¶)|Z = z¶, V = v¶, X = x, W = w]. The
conditional average causal effect, being estimable from ob-
served data, allows causal inference regarding the difference
between students attending an SSE school versus a non-SSE
school (Hong & Raudenbush, 2006).
v(Z) = V was denoted as the random variable that takes
on values v(z) = v = 0 for non-SSE policy schools or v(z) =
v = 1 for SSE policy schools; X was assigned to be a vector
of child-level covariates and W as a vector of school-level
covariates.
Let Q be the probability of a school having a supportive
environment. Conditioning on covariates, schools adopting
a policy (V = 1 or V = 0) is influenced by W (school-level
covariates) with a probability Q = Q (W); thus,
Q ¼ PðV ¼ 1jWÞ ð3Þ
If the assignment of schools to a zero or non-SSE policy
is ignorable given the observed school-level pretreatment co-
variates W, then an unbiased estimate of school j's propensity
of selecting an SSE policy, Qj
, can be made as a function of Wj
.
Let q be the probability that a student practices healthy
habits according to the school SSE policy within the school
that student attends. This could be written as
q1
¼ P½Z ¼ 1 j V ¼ 1 and q0
¼ P½Z ¼ 1jV ¼ 0 ð4Þ
If student practice or nonpractice of healthy habits, under
an SSE or a non-SSE policy, is ignorable given the observed
student-level pretreatment covariates X and the school-level
covariates W, then student i's propensity of practicing
healthy habits in school j, denoted by q1ij
if the school has
adopted an SSE policy and by q0ij
otherwise, can be esti-
mated as functions of Xi
and Wj
. Hence q1
= q1
(X, W) and
q0
= q0
(X, W), wherein
q1
¼ PðZ¼1jV ¼ 1
; X; WÞ
q0
¼ PðZ ¼ 1jV ¼ 0; X; WÞ ð5Þ
A student's probability of practicing a specific treatment
(practice of healthy habits or nonpractice of healthy habits)
under a specific school program (SSE or not) can be expressed
as P(Z = z, V = v|X, W) = P(Z = z|V = v, X,W)P(V = v|W).
If these potential outcomes are considered carefully, it is
clear that not all of the four potential outcomes are defined
for some of the students. A student who may practice healthy
habits in an SSE policy school may not have such a propen-
sity in a non-SSE, and another student may never practice
healthy habits (even within a school with an SSE policy).
Monotonicity, described by Angrist (1990), is applied here
as the assumption that the probability of practicing healthy
habits in an SSE policy school is always greater than or
equal to that within a non-SSE policy school. To address
this natural distinction into subpopulations of students, the
monotonicity assumption regarding the student level propen-
sity score estimates (q1
and q0
), wherein q1
denotes a stu-
dent's probability of practicing healthy habits under an SSE
policy and q0
denotes the student's probability of practicing
healthy habits under a non-SSE policy was applied. As mono-
tonicity is plausible in this case, three subpopulations of
students of interest can be identified within the data set,
noted as Subpopulations A, B, and C. The potential outcomes
and the causal effects of interest for each of these subpopu-
lations are listed in Table 1.
This results in the following causal estimands: The aver-
age causal effect of practice of healthy habits relative to non-
practice of healthy habits, conditioned on the covariates (X
and W), under a non-SSE policy for students in Subpop-
ulation A (students with propensity of practicing healthy
habits in a non-SSE school), may be expressed as
E½YA
ð1;0ÞÀYA
ð0;0ÞjX; W ð6Þ
Also, the average conditional practice of healthy habits ef-
fect under an SSE policy for students in Subpopulation A and
those in Subpopulation B. Combining these subpopulations
(A and B) produces a group of students who have a propensity
for practicing healthy habits. Denoting this group of students
as Subpopulation AB (A and B), this estimand is expressed as
E½YAB
ð1;1ÞÀYAB
ð0;1ÞjX; W ð7Þ
For students in Subpopulation A, the difference between
Equations (6) and (7) can be considered an estimation of
the extent to which the causal effect of the individual-level
practice of healthy habits depends on the school-level practice
of healthy habits policy. Only one of the two propensity
scores for every student can be estimated from observed data.
This will affect the ability to estimate the causal effects de-
fined in Equations (6) and (7).
After decomposition of Equation (6) as
E½YA
ð1;0ÞÀYA
ð0;0ÞjV ¼ 1;X; WPðV¼ 1jWÞþ
E½YA
ð1;0ÞÀYA
ð0;0ÞjV ¼ 0; X; WPðV¼ 0 jWÞ ð8Þ

it is clear to see that only the second term of this expression
can be estimated for this population:
% Z0
¼ E ½YA
ð1;0ÞÀYA
ð0;0ÞjV ¼0; X; W ð9Þ
wherein %Z0
is the conditional effect of healthy habits
practice under a non-SSE policy for students attending non-
SSE policy schools.
Following this logic with the estimates of conditional
average practice of healthy habits effects for students with
propensity to practice healthy habits subpopulation (AB), if
Expression (7) was decomposed now as
E½YAB
ð1;1ÞÀYAB
ð0;1ÞjV ¼ 1; X; WPðV ¼ 1jWÞþ
E½YAB
ð1;1ÞÀYAB
ð0;1ÞjV ¼ 0; X; WPðV¼ 0jWÞ ð10Þ
then the second term, E[YAB
(1,1) j YAB
(0,1)|V = 0, X, W],
cannot be estimated directly from the observational adoles-
cent health data, but the first term,
% Z1
¼ E ½YAB
ð1;1Þ À YAB
ð0;1ÞjV ¼1; X; W ð11Þ
can be estimated. %Z1 is the conditional effect of fol-
lowing healthy habits under the SSE policy for students at-
tending SSE policy schools.
The research questions of interest were as follows: (a)
What are the causal effects of a student's practice of healthy
habits in an SSE on the student's BMI? (b) What are the
causal effects of a student's practice of healthy habits in a
non-SSE on the student's BMI? The multilevel approach to
answer these questions accounts for the socioecological in-
fluence of students nested within schools, and propensity
score estimation allows for a cause-and-effect estimation if
assumptions are met.
Methods
Sample
The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
(Add Health; http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth/
data) is a longitudinal study of a nationally representative
sample of adolescents in Grades 7Y12 in the United States
that began during the 1994Y1995 school year (Harris &
Udry, 2009). Data were used on a subsample of subjects
from Wave I (1994Y1995 school year) and Wave III (2001
year) and consisted of students sampled from Wave I (n =
13,854) and school administrators sampled from Wave I
(n = 164). Protection of human subject rights was insured
with institutional review board approval and a Sensitive
Data Security Plan that was developed according to the
strict guidelines of the Add Health Data Administrator at
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for the
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health data
when stored on an external hard drive.
Variables
The treatment variables of interest in this research study
occurred at the student and school levels. At the school
level, the adoption of an SSE for healthy habits was the
treatment of interest. This variable was constructed from
responses by school administrators regarding school pro-
grams of nutrition and exercise. At the student level, the
practice of healthy habits by a student was the treatment
level variable of interest and was constructed from student
responses regarding daily eating and exercise habits. The
Wave I covariates that were hypothesized to affect either of
the treatment variables at their corresponding level or the
outcome variable of interest were included in the propen-
sity score estimates for the assumption of ignorability of
treatment assignment to hold (Gelman & Hill, 2006).
These variables at the school level included measures of
parents' average socioeconomic status, school district avail-
able resources in dollars and space, teacher and adminis-
trator demographics, geographic location of school, and
type of neighborhood (rural, urban, suburban; Table 2). At
the student level, the covariates used in the propensity score
estimates included student age, gender, ethnicity, number
of people in household, club affiliation, measures of self-
worth, body image, behaviors regarding alcohol and tobacco,
friends' behaviors regarding alcohol, grades, and parental
influence regarding teen's choices and daily habits (Table 3).

Analysis
The causal estimates of interest were obtained using logistic
regression equations to compute the estimates of Q
^ , q
^0
,
and q
^1
in Excel 2010. To demonstrate the diagnostic prop-
erties of the propensity score estimates, common axis bar
graphs were generated with STATA SE 11.
Q
^ is each school's conditional propensity of adopting
an SSE policy given the observed school-level covariates
(W1
, ..., Wn
). Seventeen covariates considered predictive of
treatment or outcome (Drews et al., 2009) were identified
and included in the propensity score estimate. On the basis
of the logit of Q
^ , the sample of schools were divided into
five strata. Five subclasses are sufficient to remove at least
90% of the bias for many continuous distributions
(Cochran, 1968).
The estimate of q1
(the probability of practicing healthy
habits within an SSE policy school) was estimated using a
logistic regression model. A total of 65 student-level covari-
ates considered predictive of treatment or outcome (Liou
et al., 2010; Power, Bindler, Goetz, & Daratha, 2010) were
included in the propensity estimate of practice of healthy
habits, q
^1
. In parallel to the estimation of q1
, q0
was es-
timated through a logistic regression model for students
attending non-SSE policy schools using the same student-
level covariates. Five strata for the logit of Q
^ , q
^0
also were
constructed.

factor (coded as a categorical variable with four levels), and
each of the covariates (or confounders) was a dependent
variable. These balancing steps were repeated until balance
was achieved or until no further improvement in balance
could be made (Yanovitzky, Zanutto, & Hornik, 2005).
However, reliance on significance testing to check for
covariate balance is sensitive to sample size (Shadish, Clark,
& Steiner, 2008).
The minimum value of the logit of q1
(constructed from
the data set) for the practice of healthy habits students
attending SSE schools was then used as the cutoff point to
identify students from Subpopulation C (students unlikely
to practice healthy habits even in an SSE). These students
were omitted from the causal analysis, because they did not
have the potential outcomes related to the causal question
of interest. Students whose logit of q1
was above the cutoff
value were considered to belong to Subpopulations A or B
(students who have a propensity to practice healthy habits)
and were combined into a subpopulation of AB.
Similarly, students from non-SSE policy schools whose
q0
logit was below the minimum cutoff for any practice of
healthy habits students were excluded from the sample used
in the causal estimates, leaving only students from Subpop-
ulation A (students with a propensity to practice healthy
habits even in non-SSE policy schools).
After the initial estimate of causal effects by propensity
score stratification, the clustering of students within schools
was modeled with two hierarchical linear models using HLM
6 software. The resulting models were estimates of %z0
, a
causal estimand of the effect of healthy habit practice rel-
ative to non-healthy habit practice on measured BMI scores
for the students in Subpopulation A, and %z1
, a causal estimand
of effect of student non-healthy habits relative to healthy
habits on measured BMI scores for the students in Sub-
population AB in an SSE. These models included an estimate
of the variation of the practice of healthy habits effect across
the students and schools by using a hierarchical two-level
regression model, with student at Level 1 and school at
Level 2.
Results
As shown in a bar graph in Figure 1 representing the
distribution of schools according to the logit of the Q
(propensity for adopting SSE), most schools in the sample
were non-SSE schools (n = 146) and the remaining were
SSE schools (n = 18). Balance was achieved on over 95% of
the school-level pretreatment covariates. On the basis of
the logit of the Q estimate, the sample of schools (n = 164)
was divided into five strata. The results of the analysis are
displayed in Table 4. Schools with supportive environ-
ments had a predicted propensity of a supportive environ-
ment, with over 40% of the SSE schools in the highest
predicted stratum. An overall higher logit of the Q estimate
within stratum for the SSE schools was noted in contrast
to the non-SSE schools. Schools with a propensity for SSE
programs had, on average, more English-as-a-primary-
language households and higher family household incomes.
The non-SSE schools also had a lower percentage of schools
with immunization programs and tended to be located in
rural areas.
Student propensity for practice of healthy habits within
a non-SSE school, q0
, was estimated through a logistic
regression model for children attending non-SSE schools
only. In Figure 2, students practicing healthy habits (n =
6,775) are represented across the upper half of graph and
the nonpractice of healthy habits students (n = 5,581) is
represented across the lower half of the graph. On the basis
of the logit of the q0
estimate, the sample of students (n =
12,356) was divided into five strata. The students who
practiced healthy habits and the students who did not were
dispersed across all strata in this estimate, with no clear
concentration of students in either area of the propensity
strata. Balance was achieved on more than 95% of the
student-level pretreatment covariates. Students who had
lower propensity estimates to practice healthy habits were
more likely to be students born outside of the United States,
watched more hours of television, ate less meals per week
with parents, had more friends who drank alcohol
regularly, and made their own choices regarding time to
sleep on school nights.
Student propensity for practice of healthy habits within
an SSE school, q1
, was estimated through a logistic
regression model for children attending SSE schools only.
Balance was achieved on 95% of the student-level pretreat-
ment covariates believed to effect the treatment or outcome
variable. A graph representing the distribution of students
according to the propensity score estimates of practicing
healthy habits from an SSE school is presented in Figure 3.
On the basis of the logit of the q1
estimate, the sample of
students (n = 1,495) was divided into five strata. There was
a higher propensity for students who practiced healthy
habits to have more frequent medical and dental exams, to

eat dinner with their parents, to get more hours of sleep, to
feel safe in their schools, and to plan on attending college.
The students who did not practice healthy habits had an
increased hours of television watched, had an increased
amount of video games played, reported more asthmatic
conditions, ate nothing for breakfast often, and had a
higher report of being left back a grade in school.
Empirical identification of subpopulations was accom-
plished by constructing mutually exclusive groups based on
the estimated value of the logits of students to practice
healthy habits. The value of j3.341 was used as the cutoff
point to identify the 20 non-healthy habits students in SSE
schools belonging to Subpopulation C, because there were
no practice of healthy habits students with a logit less than
or equal to j3.341. The minimum value of the logit of
q
^0
(j2.43 ) was used as the cutoff point to identify the
21 students attending non-SSE schools belonging to Sub-
population C, bringing the Subpopulation C total sample
size to 42. The remaining sample size for students in
Subpopulation AB in SSEs was 1,475, and the sample size
for students identified as belonging to Subpopulation A in
nonsupportive schools was 12,335.
The raw difference in the average BMI score outcome was
observed across strata for students in Subpopulation AB in
non-SSE schools, and an estimate of the overall differences in
BMI was calculated (Table 5). The mean differences in BMI
were not significant within the strata. The raw difference in
the average BMI score outcome was observed across strata
for students in Subpopulation A in SSE schools, and the
average mean difference was not significant (Table 6).
The causal estimands of interest %z0
and %z1
were then
obtained with a hierarchical two-level regression model,
students at Level 1 within school at Level 2 (Tables 7 and 8).
The raw difference results in BMI outcomes were supported
with the causal estimates of the effect of practicing healthy
habits obtained with the hierarchical linear model estimates.
The causal effect of practicing healthy habits within a non-SSE
school, %z0
, for students in Subpopulation A was 0.16 (SE =
0.14). The causal effect on BMI scores for students from
Subpopulation AB, practicing healthy habits in SSE schools,
%z1
, was j0.18 (SE = 0.39).
Discussion
The purpose of this research was to obtain causal estimates
of the impact of healthy habits on individual students'
obesity outcomes with a nationally representative observa-
tional data set to demonstrate a methodology to estimate

causal effects in a multilevel setting. To obtain these causal
estimates, the distribution of covariates between the units
of comparison at both school and student levels and the
natural clustering of students within schools was consid-
ered in the potential outcome models with a relaxed form
of SUTVA.
At the school level of this data, the estimated distribution
of the logit for adopting an SSE policy allowed for com-
parison between types of schools. Most schools were non-
SSE; the SSE-identified schools appear to have a dichotomous
distribution, with approximately half of the schools profiling
as private schools with high SES and resources and the other
half profiling as larger public schools with lower income and
resources. The private schools have tuition resources, and the
federally and state funded programs may be funding the
larger, economically less-advantaged public schools, resulting
in the emergence of these two profiles of SSE schools.
At the student level of the sample, there were two
propensity score estimates obtained empirically, the first
being q0
from children attending non-SSE schools. The
students within the non-SSEs who practiced healthy habits
did differ from their non-healthy habits practice peers on
many covariates of interest, but a strong profile did not
emerge. The second student-level estimate, q1
, was obtained
empirically from students who attended SSE schools. The
students within these schools also differed when compared
between students who practiced healthy habits and those
who did not.
The results, although not statistically significant, sup-
port the finding that SSE has a positive effect on students
with a propensity for practicing healthy habits in SSE and
non-SSE schools. Random assignment to treatment allows
for causal inference if the sample size is sufficient (Pearl,
2003). This study had a larger sample size, in both levels of
the treatment, than previous multilevel randomized control
trials that studied the effect of exercise and eating habits on
adolescents' BMI and BMI z scores and unlike the random-
ized studies accounted for ignorability of treatment assign-
ment at both levels of the model (DeBar et al., 2011; de Heer
et al., 2011; Dzewaltowski et al., 2010). The nonsignificant
findings may be due to low power as the Level 2 sample size
was only n = 18 for SSE schools. However, one strategic
advantage of propensity score estimates for causal inference,
over simple matching and regression techniques, is that it
provides a one-factor covariate comprised of all other
hypothesized predictor covariates, allowing for stratification

on one identified covariate instead of 65 at the student level.
More importantly, the nonsignificant findings may indicate
that the causal relationship between the adoption of healthy
habit behaviors at a student level, whether in an SSE or not,
may not address the multidimensional influences on obesity
outcomes fully (Maclean et al., 2010). A dependent measure
more proximal in time than the 6-year lag BMI used in this
analysis would add to causal inference estimates. Body mass
index is not considered by some experts to be the best
measure for adolescent obesity, so a standardized BMI z
score may be a more accurate measure of an individual
teen's obesity (Rausch et al., 2011). However, although BMI
and BMI z score are the most current measures of childhood
obesity, these are not direct measures of body fat. Other
measures such as percentage of body fat and bioelectrical
impedance analysis are being proposed by some obesity
researchers as more valid obesity assessment tools (Boylan
et al., 2010). Alternative or multiple obesity measures should

be considered for further research. A continuous measure-
ment level of SSE as opposed to a binary assignment may be
helpful in adding information regarding the causal effect of
varying levels of SSE on students' BMIs. The results obtained
with this research cannot be generalized to students in Sub-
population C. Subpopulation C will require a different causal
model. Although small (n = 41), this subpopulation needs
to be considered in healthy habits policy and program
adoption research to decrease adulthood obesity. A further
limitation of this research was that most variables at both
levels were from self-reported survey data, with the exception of
measured heights and weights for the outcome BMI variable.
Multilevel modeling can be achieved with multiple types
of software, such as HLM, Mplus, MLwiN, SAS PROC
MIXED, STATA, R, and IBM SPSS 19 and 20. Versions of
HLM, like MLwiN and R, are available for free, an ap-
pealing consideration when allocating research funding.
HLM allows for specification of the model at each level
separately, such as at the student and school levels, and does
not require the researcher to derive a single equation spec-
ification (Singer, 1998). This can be quite helpful to the
nonexpert quantitative researcher by providing explicit
notation of the theorized variables at each level and avoid-
ing the common omission of cross-level interactions. HLM
does derive and display the singular multiple-level equation,
in addition to the individual-level equations. HLM, like
MLwiN, does not require command input in syntax, making
it appealing to many nonstatistician researchers. There are
manuscripts and books available that provide a thorough
discussion of the various software products available to model
multilevel research (Albright, 2007; Albright & Marinova,
2010; Hong & Raudenbush, 2006; Muthen & Muthen,
2012; Rasbash et al., 2009; Singer, 1998).
Multilevel modeling accounts for the natural clustering
of students within schools and can be used to estimate the
variance components at each level of the model, allowing
researchers to examine distinct phenomena and socio-
ecological factors. However, multilevel modeling without
a causal framework will not produce cause-and-effect rela-
tionship answers. The inclusion of propensity score estimates
at both levels of the model, with a relaxed form of SUTVA at
the student level, can meet the assumptions required to es-
tablish a cause and effect relationship.
Propensity score estimates for causal inference need to
be used in consideration of potential limitations. Ignorability
of treatment assignment is an untestable assumption for all
causal inference modeling and may be violated if an unob-
served relevant covariate is omitted from the model (Pearl,
2003, 2010). Sensitivity analysis can provide information
regarding plausibility of assumptions being tenable, but
confidence in causal conclusions must be viewed by their
consistency with findings of other evidence in addition to
how sensitive the conclusions are to reasonable devia-
tions. Propensity score estimates, like experimental stud-
ies, work better with larger samples, as a covariate in a
small sample may be unbalanced enough between two
groups to make the samples nonequivalent (Rubin, 1997).
Balancing can be observed with a variety of methods on ob-
served covariates only (Yanovitzky et al., 2005 ). The SUTVA
assumption may not be tenable in multilevel settings. This
violation can be addressed by a relaxation of SUTVA as done
in this study. The primary limitation with propensity score
estimates, as with all causal inference, remains the inability
to test if a relevant covariate was eliminated from the model
(Pearl, 2003, 2010; Rubin, 1974, 1997). Convergence of strong
evidence over multiple studies supports causal conclusions.
Cause-and-effect relationships in a multilevel setting are
often the relationships nurse researchers want to test. Various
constraints of resources, ethics, and political opposition often
preclude the design of treatment effect studies that meet the
assumptions for causal inference. Propensity scores can pro-
vide these estimates in observational settings and can be
produced with the use of spreadsheet software that has basic
statistical functions, making a causal modeling approach of
analysis readily available to most researchers. q
