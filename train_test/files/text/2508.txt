Introduction
In the USA, the national Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) has documented that 9th­12th grade stu-
dents in high school have engaged in many risky health behaviours. According to the YRBS data from
2011, 70.8% of teenagers reported having consumed at least one alcoholic drink (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, 2012a). Moreover, 47.4% of adolescents had engaged in sexual intercourse
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012c). These two behaviours (i.e. alcohol use and sexual
intercourse) occur more frequently among adolescents than other risky behaviours, such as tobacco
use (44.7%) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012d) or marijuana use (39.9%) (Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, 2012b). In addition, in the same year, 22.1% answered positively to the
item:`Did you drink alcohol or use drugs before you had sexual intercourse the last time?'-- indicating
that nearly half of the adolescents who engaged in sexual intercourse, did so under the influence of
drugs or alcohol (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012c).
Risky behaviours among adolescents pose a significant threat to their health during the
adolescence years, and engaging in risky behaviours can lead to non-trivial health problems, even
as adults (DiClemente, Hansen, & Ponton, 1996). Certain levels of alcohol consumption during
adolescence can negatively affect physiological development (by affecting the brain and hormones,
ABSTRACT
This study examined how the structure of friendship networks influences
two risk behaviours in tandem (drinking and sexual intercourse) among a
sample of US adolescents (7th­12th grades, n = 901; 2 schools) from Wave
I of the Add Health data. For one school, adolescents in denser and smaller
networks were at higher risk for engaging in sexual intercourse and drinking
alcohol simultaneously. In that school, network attributes (out-degree and
betweenness) and adolescents'age were associated with an increased risk.
In the other school, more diffused friendship networks posed less risk of
engaging in these two behaviours in tandem. Moreover, engagement in
risky behaviours was significantly predicted by teens' age and gender. We
conclude that friendships'influence on adolescents'risk behaviours varies,
depending on size and composition of the networks and adolescents'
characteristics. Moreover, understanding adolescents' social ties can be
useful for health promoters, thus research on adolescent networks remains
warranted.

for instance), and can lead to other risky behaviours, including unprotected sexual activity and
tobacco use (Guo et al., 2002; Santelli, Robin, Brener, & Lowry, 2001). Although engaging in sexual
activity during adolescence is normative within many social groups in the USA (Brendgen, Wanner,
& Vitaro, 2007), beginning sexual intercourse at an early age leads to an increased risk for sexually
transmitted infections, or for becoming pregnant (Tapert, Aarons, Sedlar, & Brown, 2001). These
risks may increase when sexual activity is coupled with significant amounts of alcohol consumption
(Bailey, Pollock, Martin, & Lynch, 1999), because high blood alcohol levels can impair judgement
and lead to unprotected intercourse.
The literature on adolescents'health addresses the notion that when adolescents engage in a risky
behaviour, they are more likely to engage in other risky behaviours. For instance, in a study conducted
by MacArthur et al. (2012), the authors documented that alcohol use among adolescents (aged 15
and 16) was positively associated with other risky behaviours (i.e. substance use and sexual activity).
Additionally, the study by Patrick and Schulenberg (2010) presented adolescents' substance use (i.e.
smoking and marijuana use) as leading to greater intentions to drink alcohol.
For these phenomena, earlier literature demonstrate that, in particular, friends and/or friendship net-
works during adolescence play a key role in influencing adolescents'risky behaviours (Alexander, Piazza,
Mekos, & Valente, 2001; Pollard, Tucker, Green, Kennedy, & Go, 2010; Sieving, Eisenberg, Pettingell, &
Skay, 2006;Valente, Unger, & Johnson, 2005), because friends and friendships underlie person-to-person
and/or group-to-group interactions. For instance, the study conducted by Schwinn and Schinke (2014)
found that drinking and offering alcohol increasingly affected other teens'intentions toward drinking.
In addition, Fujimoto and Valente (2012a) addressed a key finding that various types of friendships
among adolescents (i.e. mutual, reciprocal and directional friendships) strongly influenced friends'
substance use (e.g. drinking and smoking).
Moreover, other studies have identified friendships as probably the most significant factor in the
spreading of risky behaviour among groups of teens (Ali & Dwyer, 2011; Fujimoto & Valente, 2012b;
Jaccard, Blanton, & Dodge, 2005), because of adolescents'development and most of them needing to
belong to their friends'or other social groups outside their own family. For instance, a study carried out
by Mercken, Snijders, Steglich, and deVries (2009) identified that adolescents were more likely to select
their friends based on similar smoking behaviour. Additionally, the study conducted by Fujimoto and
Valente (2013) found that adolescents affiliated with organised school sports and clubs (e.g. basket-
ball and playing chess) affected non-affiliated adolescents' drinking behaviour. Therefore, examining
friendship networks may provide better information on adolescents'behaviours and their interpersonal
mechanisms, than the study of individual intra-personal factors alone.
One way to capture the influence of friendships among adolescents is Social Network Analysis
(SNA). Studies have highlighted that SNA can be applied to understanding the scope of changes
in risky health behaviours and friendship ties among adolescents (Christakis & Fowler, 2007; Jeon
& Goodson, 2015; Luke & Harris, 2007; Smith & Christakis, 2008), because the interplay of dynamic
friendships and behaviours occur inside inter-personal systems (Steglich, Snijders, & Pearson, 2010).
Specifically, utilising SNA can provide visuals (in graph form) that are useful to describe and analyse
the patterns of a network's structure, as well as verify statistical measures (Crnovrsanin, Muelder,
Faris, Felmlee, & Ma, 2014).
The theoretical perspective of network theory focuses on structural and/or relational approaches
to the research of social (network) influence (Cook & Whitmeyer, 1992), compared with learning and/
or observing approaches in traditional theories. In other words, network theory is based on the notion
of network influence: adolescents are affected by interacting directly and indirectly with their friends
or with their friends'friends (Ennett & Bauman, 1996). The result is that they can share similar behav-
iours (i.e. influenced by friends or exert influence on friends) or stand in similar positions inside their
networks (i.e. individuals connecting to all other friends in the network measured by network centrali-
tiessuchasdegree[thenumberoflinkstoandfromaperson],density[theratioofthenumberofactual
connections divided by the total possible connections in the network] (Valente, 2010) and
betweenness [the number of times an adolescent lies on the shortest paths linking other adolescents

in the network]) (Borgatti, Everett, & Johnson, 2013). Therefore, utilising network analysis, research-
ers can examine the composition or the set-up of the network and its influence upon adolescents'
risky behaviours.
Traditionally, risky behaviour dissemination relies on individual-level information on how
adolescents adopt a behaviour through learning and/or observing others perform the behav-
iour. Researchers have used traditional theories such as the Theory of Planned Behavior or Social
Cognitive Theory in studies of health and risky behaviours among adolescents. These classical
theories have emphasised the individual-level inter-personal process of learning risky behaviour
by directly observing how others behave, or by adopting a group's social norms and framing
attitudes according to these norms in order to be accepted into those groups (National Institutes
of Health, 2005).
Regarding our topic of interest, here, in addition to social network theory, Jessor's Problem Behavior
Theory (PBT) (1987) can also help explore the mechanism of influence of friendship network structure
upon adolescents' risky behaviours. PBT is based on a social-psychological framework that attempts
to explain risk factors related to adolescent involvement in various problem behaviours such as sexual
intercourse, tobacco, alcohol and drug use (Jessor, 1987). PBT includes three major systems of socio-psy-
chological variables: the personality system (i.e. individual values, beliefs and attitudes), the perceived
environment system (i.e. family and friend influences) and the behaviour system (i.e. drinking, deviant
behaviour, marijuana, cigarettes and drug use behaviours). According to Jessor (1987), adolescents'
problem behaviours are associated with the perceived environment system (e.g. peer relations) and
personality system (e.g. attitudes), because, within peer relations, friends'behaviours can directly influ-
ence various risky behaviours among adolescents.
Informed by these theoretical perspectives, the purpose of this study, therefore, is twofold:
using data from a large, national sample of adolescents in the US, to (1) describe the structure
of friendship networks for adolescents who engage in, and for adolescents who do not engage
in sexual intercourse and alcohol consumption simultaneously; and (2) assess the influence of
friendship network structure upon adolescents'risky health behaviours (specifically the behaviours
of sexual intercourse and alcohol consumption in tandem). To achieve this purpose, we employ
SNA techniques utilised by authors in the research of social networks (Ennett et al., 2006; Mercken
et al., 2009; Valente, Gallaher, & Mouttapa, 2004).
This study is important because it examines two risky behaviours simultaneously, while most
previous studies examine risky behaviours individually and in isolation. We believe that research
examining multiple simultaneous risk behaviours can significantly help with the design of more effective
prevention programmes to promote adolescents'healthy development.
Methods
Data source
This study utilised the longitudinal data generated by the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health to Adult Health (Add Health) in the USA.The Add Health study gathers information (e.g. health-
related behaviours of adolescents, demographics and family socio-economic status) for students in
grades 7­12 nationwide, thus yielding representative data stored in the Caroline Population Center
at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. To date, Waves I, II, III and IV of the data collection
conducted in 1994­1995, 1996, 2001­2002 and 2007­2008, respectively, have followed youth from ado-
lescence to young adulthood.The Add Health data-set comprises completed in-school questionnaires
and in-home interviews. The Wave I in-school questionnaire (n = 90,118) from 145 schools includes
topics such as demographic characteristics (e.g. age, gender and ethnicity), health-risk behaviours,
extracurricular activities in the school year, and friendship nominations for the five best male and five
best female friends from school rosters (Harris et al., 2009).

Sample
From the pool of adolescents completing the in-school questionnaire, the Wave I in-home inter-
view sample (n = 20,745) in grades 7­12 is drawn. The in-home interview includes sensitive ques-
tions including those about alcohol use and sexual behaviour. Additionally, the in-home interview
sample contains a subsample, called the saturated school sample (n = 3702) from 16 schools where
all enrolled students in the schools participated in in-home interviews. Therefore, in order to achieve
our purpose, this study used the saturated sample from the two schools providing the largest
samples out of the original 16, for analysis. The remaining 14 schools are excluded due to relatively
small sample sizes and substantially larger amounts of missing data. Moreover, friendship nomi-
nations in these saturated schools allow us to construct complete friendship networks, indicating
these networks can provide inter-relationships such as adolescent's relations and network positions
among individual adolescents.
We limited our analysis to adolescents who answered`yes'or`no'to the question,`The most recent
time you had sexual intercourse, had you been drinking alcohol?' in the in-home interview, from the
two schools with the largest saturated samples.This resulted in a total sample of 901 (School 1: n = 324
and School 2: n = 577).
Measures
Friendship nominations were obtained by asking students to name up to five best male and five best
female friends. The friendship nominations from the same school rosters to which the respondent
belonged received unique identification codes (e.g. 12345678), whereas friends from different schools
were duly identified by specific codes (e.g. 77777777). We excluded friendship nominations from
different schools in subsequent analyses because these friends did not connect with each other within
the same friendship networks. Using nominations from the same school rosters, we can create complete
networks within a given school. These complete networks allow us to measure adolescent's relations
and network positions.
We computed the following measures of friendship networks via a social network analysis computer
program.
(1)Degree is`the number of links to and from a person'(Valente, 2010). Out-degree is the number
of friendship ties that the ego (person responding to the survey) nominates; in-degree is the
number of friendship nominations the ego receives (Valente, 2010).
(2)Density is the ratio of the number of actual connections divided by the total possible connec-
tions in the network (Valente, 2010).
(3)
Betweenness is the number of times an adolescent lies on the shortest paths linking other
adolescents in the network (Borgatti et al., 2013).
(4)
Bonacich centrality is `... not only a function of how many friends an individual has but also
the number of friends one's friends have'(Ali, Amialchuk, & Rizzo, 2012).
In this study, we assessed the influence of friendship network structures upon the behaviours of
sexual intercourse and alcohol consumption in tandem, based on a question in the in-home interview
atWave I. Specifically, students were asked if they had been drinking alcohol when they last had sexual
intercourse. Originally, while the questionnaire offers the option of answers coded as three categor-
ical variables (e.g. 0 = `no', 1 = `yes', and 3 = `refused'), we dichotomised the variable, examining only
participants who answered`yes'or`no'.We also utilised gender and grade as control variables, coded as
dichotomous (1 = male and 2 = female) and categorical variables (e.g. 7 = 7th grade and 8 = 8th grade)
from the in-home interview at Wave I.

Statistical analyses
For descriptive analyses we employed Stata 13 (StataCorp LP, College Station,TX). Moreover, to analyse
the saturated samples from the in-home interview atWave I, we utilised the NetDraw feature in UCINET,
a dynamic network analysis tool, to describe the structure of the friendship networks for adolescents
who engaged in and for those who did not engage in simultaneous sexual intercourse and alcohol use.
To assess the relationship between network structure and adolescents' risk behaviours, we ran a
logistic linear regression using Stata 13 for each school. In a preliminary analysis, we assessed whether
students in the two schools were similar enough to agglomerate into a single sample, and found there
were statistically significant differences between Schools (1 and 2) on the question regarding alcohol
use during sexual intercourse (p = .03). We report our analyses, therefore, separately for each school,

as students in the schools differed significantly in their responses on the surveys. Moreover, we also
assessed multicollinearity, reporting variance inflation factors (VIF), among variables in the logistic
regression analysis. The VIF values of all variables were below 4.42 in Schools 1 and 2, indicating mul-
ticollinearity was not a problem (O'Brien, 2007).
Results
Descriptive statistics
As shown in Table 1, we employed descriptive statistics to highlight the characteristic of the samples
from School 1 (n = 324) and School 2 (n = 577), respectively. Because adolescents were allowed to choose
multiple options for the item on race/ethnicity, the percentage totals exceed 100%. In School 1, nearly
half of the students were female (49.48%), 29.1% reported being 18 years old and 99.4% marked their
race/ethnicity as white. In School 2, more than half of the students (54.1%) were male, 35.88% were
18 years old and 29.5% reported their race/ethnicity as African-American.
Table 2 shows descriptive statistics for adolescents from the two schools, who engaged in (`yes')
and who did not engage in (`no') drinking alcohol before having intercourse. Once again, the total
percentages for race/ethnicity exceed 100%, because students could have chosen multiple ethnic-
ities. School 1 had 50 students in the`yes'group, and 274 students in the`no'group. More than half
the students in the`yes'group (62%) were boys and 34% were 17 and 18 years old, respectively. All
students (100%) marked one of their race/ethnicities as white. Among the `no' group at School 1,
more than half (51.5%) of students were girls and 28.1% reported being 18 years old. The majority
(99.3%) marked white as one of their ethnicities. In School 2, 40% were boys in the`yes'group and,
of these, 40.98% were 17 years old; 34.4% reported their race/ethnicity as African-American. In the
`no'group, 52.7% were boys, 37% were 18 years old, and 28.9% marked one of their race/ethnicity
choices as African-American.
Networks
Figure 1 depicts the network structures of School 1 and 2, based on friendship nominations, for the
adolescents who engaged in sexual intercourse and drinking alcohol. Adolescents were asked to report
five best male and female friends; however, the total number of friendship nominations varied by stu-
dent. It is important to note we did not include `isolates'or adolescents with no ties in Figure 1. Thus,
the number of students in the graph depicted in Figure 1 differs from the total sample. Each square
(adolescents engaged in risky behaviours) or circle (their friends) represents a student in the network.
Squares and circles are sized based on degree. In School 1, there are 137 adolescents with 147 ties.The
graph for School 2 displays 92 students with 41 ties.
Figure 2 shows students (circle) who did not engage in the two behaviours we assessed within each
school, based on friendship nominations.We also did not include`isolates'in Figure 2.Thus, as for Figure
1, the number of students in the graphs differ from the number of students in the analytical sample.
Each circle represents a student in the network. Circles are sized based on degree. School 1 portrays
468 adolescents with 524 ties in the network. School 2 shows 701 students with 448 ties.
Assessing the influence of network structure on individual behaviour
Table 3 shows the results of the probabilities (or odds ratios) of engaging in sexual intercourse and
drinking alcohol associated with individual-level and network-level variables for adolescents in Schools
1 (n = 324) and 2 (n = 577). The probabilities were estimated separately for each school.
In School 1, in terms of demographic predictors, age was significantly associated with simultaneous
engagement in sexual intercourse and alcohol consumption (OR = .66, p < .05), indicating adolescents
who were younger were more likely to participate in these two behaviours.

We also tested network centrality measures such as degree, density and Bonacich power, and found
out-degree and betweenness to be associated with engaging in these behaviours (sex and drinking
alcohol) in School 1. Engaging in sex and drinking alcohol simultaneously was significantly predicted
by out-degree (students named others as a friend: OR = 1.39, p < .05) in this friendship network, indicat-
ing adolescents who named more friends were more likely to have an increased engagement in these

behaviours. Additionally, betweenness (the fraction of the shortest path between students: OR = 1.01;
p < .05) was significantly related with engagement in risky behaviours (sexual intercourse and drinking
alcohol in tandem), indicating students who were connected through a short path with others exhibiting
risky behaviours were more likely to engage in these risky behaviours, themselves.
In School 2, engagement in risky behaviours (sex and alcohol consumption simultaneously) was
significantly predicted by gender (OR = .46, p < .05), indicating male students were more likely to have

increased involvement in risky behaviours. Moreover, age (OR = 1.43, p < .05) was another significant
predictor, indicating students who were older were more likely to engage in sexual intercourse and
drinking alcohol at the same time. In contrast with the results from School 1, none of the network
centrality measures for the School 2 sample had a statistically significant relationship with adolescents'
sexual intercourse and drinking in tandem.
Discussion
In this study, we were interested in the influence of friendship network structures upon adolescents'
risky health behaviours, specifically the simultaneous behaviours of sexual intercourse and alcohol
consumption. Utilizing SNA, we identified three predictors (i.e. age, out-degree and betweenness) in
School 1and 2 predictors (i.e. gender and age) in School 2. These factors were significantly associated
with risky behaviours (sexual intercourse and drinking alcohol in tandem) among adolescents in our
sample. Our results indicated that (a) the structure of friendship relationships (i.e. out-degree and
betweenness) among students was related to an increased risk for engaging in these behaviours in one
school, but not in the other; and (b) demographic attributes (i.e. age and gender) also varied by school.
In School 1 ­ as shown inTable 1 describing the characteristic of the sample ­ the sample size is rel-
atively smaller (n = 324) than School 2 (n = 577), but, the friendship network in School 1 shows a larger
number of connections (denser network) among adolescents sampled than School 2 (as depicted in
Figure 1, School 1 had147 ties in the `yes'group). School 2 displays a friendship network with sparser
connections (also in Figure 1: School 2 had 41 ties in the `yes' group). This suggests that in this study,
at least, tightly bound friendship networks in smaller schools with single race/ethnicity (School 1) may
carry higher risk of engagement in sexual intercourse and alcohol consumption in tandem. On the other
hand, more diffused (spread out) networks in larger schools with more diverse race/ethnicity (School 2)
seem to pose less risk of engaging in these two risk behaviours simultaneously. This finding suggests
that, counterintuitively, larger networks may pose less risk, depending on how densely connected its
members are.
With respect to network attributes (i.e. out-degree and betweenness), out-degree refers to the
number of friendship nominations teens made (Valente, 2010). In this study, the out-degree attribute
in School 1was correlated with an increased risk of engaging in sexual intercourse and alcohol con-
sumption simultaneously. As defined earlier, out-degree refers to the nominations made by a study
participant (or the number of ties that stem from a node in the directed network; in the case of friend-
ship networks: a measure of gregariousness); in-degree refers to the nominations received by a study
participant (in the case of friendship networks, a measure of popularity) (Valente, 2010). In our sample,
students who nominate others rather than receive nominations from others appear to influence their
peers' behaviours within their friendship network. This may indicate that, potentially, these students

actively seek contact with other students in order to embed into friendship networks. Similar to our
finding, the study conducted by Fujimoto andValente (2012a) identified that students who nominated
others were more likely to influence their friends'smoking and drinking behaviours, than adolescents
who were nominated by others.
Betweenness is another attribute of a network, referring to the number of times an adolescent
lies on the shortest paths linking other adolescents in the network (Borgatti et al., 2013). We included
betweenness centrality because it can be an indirect measure of network flow or influence spread
among adolescents. Betweenness also allows us to identify individuals who would possibly exert control
over others, within the network.
In this study, the betweenness attribute was significantly related with engagement in sexual inter-
course and drinking alcohol in School 1. This relationship potentially indicates that individuals in the
network are likely to be influenced by the risky behaviours of friends or exert influence toward risky
behaviours on others, because they are connected by a greater number of geodesic paths. Additionally,
it may be possible that there are individual adolescents with higher betweenness in the network, so they
control or influence behaviour or information flow serving as gatekeepers among the other adolescents
(Ennett et al., 2006). Supporting this finding, a study conducted by Ennett et al. (2008) assessed the
relationship between peer attributes and adolescents'smoking utilising SNA. Authors found there was a
significant correlation between friend's cigarette use and betweenness centrality: higher betweenness
centrality was related to an increased risk for engaging in smoking behaviour.
While these two network attributes (out-degree and betweenness centrality) were associated with
risky behaviours (sex and drinking alcohol simultaneously) in School 1, no effects for network structure
were found in School 2.
Consistent with previous research on adolescents'risky health behaviours and peer influence, we did
find that adolescents'age was associated with an increased risk for involvement in sexual intercourse
and simultaneous alcohol consumption. In School 1, adolescents who were younger were more likely
to have engaged in these risky behaviours; conversely, in School 2, teens who were older were more
likely to participate in those behaviours. In other words, being young, within certain structures, may
entail protection. On the other hand, being young, within different structures, may lead to risk. A study
by Ali and Dwyer (2011) assessed the association between peer friendship networks and adolescent's
sexual behaviour.The authors documented that older adolescents enrolled in higher grades were more
likely to have had sexual intercourse and multiple sexual partners.
Regarding gender, surprisingly, we did not find any effect in School 1. Even when we calculated
a logistic regression model including only demographic variables and no network attributes, the
results did not show gender as having a positive relationship with the risky behaviours in that school
(OR = .642, p = .166). However, in School 2, male teens were more likely to have engaged in the two
risky behaviours we assessed, compared with female teens. It is possible that male adolescents within
this present friendship network may show particularly high susceptibility toward risky behaviours. It
may also indicate that male teens may get an earlier start to engage in risky behaviours than females
in this study. Reasons explaining why gender was a significant predictor in School 2, but not in School
1, are not clear. Findings indicated that, for School 1 study participants, knowledge about the structure
of their networks supersedes knowledge about individual students'gender. In other words, for School
1, if attempting to predict engagement in sexual intercourse and alcohol consumption (in tandem),
having information about the network would be more valuable than information on gender. For School
2, because the network structure had no association with the behaviours, knowing the students'gender
becomes more valuable predictive information than their network structures.
We did find in one school that adolescents'friendship network characteristics can influence theirs
and their friends'risky behaviours, within certain contexts.These findings are in line with network the-
ory because the theory proposes that network properties (such as network centralities, such as degree
or density) represent mechanisms that can affect outcomes of interest (Fredericks & Durland, 2005).
Moreover, our findings suggest the underlying causes of tie formation (i.e. out-degree and betweenness)
among adolescents can influence the risky behaviours of other adolescents in the network. Therefore,

these findings can provide an additional layer of understanding and greater insight into the overall
influence of friendship networks on adolescents'risky behaviours.
When examining risky behaviours of adolescents (e.g. smoking or drinking alcohol), previous studies
have found evidence that intra-personal factors (e.g. attitudes or beliefs) and the relationships among
adolescents (inter-personal factors) are significantly correlated with teens'risky behaviours. Such find-
ings indicate that adolescents' risky behaviours can be influenced by friendships or by observation
of other teens' behaviours. Jessor's PBT helps explain this phenomenon as it proposes that problem
behaviours can be explained from the perspective of three major systems acting upon each other:
socio-psychological variables, such as families (i.e. parents or siblings) or friends'behaviours (perceived
environment system) may affect the adolescents' beliefs or attitudes (personality system) that may
predispose individual adolescents toward risky behaviours (behaviour system) (Donovan, Jessor, &
Costa, 1991; Jessor, 1987). Therefore, PBT as a conceptual framework can help clarify the mechanisms
through which adolescent ties can influence their behaviour.
Our study makes an important contribution to the literature on adolescent health promotion
because it examines engagement in two risk behaviours, simultaneously (sexual intercourse and
drinking alcohol in tandem), and approaches this examination from a friendship network perspec-
tive. Nonetheless, despite its contributions, this study contains important limitations: (1) we did
not include any intra-personal variables such as attitudes, norms or beliefs, in our analyses; and (2)
we only assessed one-time period (Wave I). Further analyses might include intra-personal factors
as control variables, to better tease out the potential effects of network structure(s). Also benefi-
cial would be to examine multiple points in time (e.g. Waves I and II) in order to provide a better
understanding of the changes in behaviour and in network composition/structure resulting from
the influence of friends who engage in risky behaviours. A third limitation regards our findings
and their different patterns for School 1 and 2. Given the differences, the findings may not gen-
eralise to a more contemporary sample. Lastly, the Add Health data-set is based on self-reported
information and carries with it the potential errors in recall and reporting intrinsic to this type of
inquiry. Generalisation, again, should be avoided.
Recommendations for researchers and health promoters
Despite these limitations, this study suggests that denser friendship ties, coupled with specific network
characteristics (i.e. out-degree and betweenness) among students in a smaller school may be associated
with prevalence of engagement in sexual intercourse and alcohol consumption simultaneously, as
compared to a lager school. Age and gender were also found to have an association, although gender
was not a factor in one of the schools. These findings have implications for future research and for the
development of health promotion programs for adolescents.
Regarding research, we believe future studies should employ SNA to examine adolescents' risky
behaviours, but they should also include multi-level data (intrapersonal, interpersonal and school char-
acteristics). Researchers should, whenever feasible, use longitudinal data to understand the mechanisms
through which friendship networks lead adolescents to change their behaviours (Kobus, 2003). Also
valuable is examining multiple co-occurring behaviours, whenever possible, given that risk behaviours
rarely occur in isolation.
Finally, when designing health promotion programs for adolescents, health promoters should con-
sider designing programs directed at networks of adolescents, especially dense friendship networks
(Haynie, 2001). Given that most of these networks are school bound, this approach only requires a
shift in perspective ­ from an individual-centred intervention, to a network-centred one. Moreover,
when designing programs to target adolescent networks, health promoters should attempt to learn
about the composition/characteristics of the networks and identify individual adolescents with high
betweenness centrality ­ these teens may become valuable peer leaders or gatekeepers and influence
many others in the network (Ennett et al., 2006). Working with these teens might be an efficient way
to promote the health of the entire network.
