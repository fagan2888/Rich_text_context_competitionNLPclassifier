1 Introduction
In the last twenty years high-income countries have witnessed an important move-
ment in the aspirations of public policy beyond meeting merely material goals towards
a range of outcomes captured through the use of the term well-being. In the United
Kingdom the concept of well-being is prominent as a goal of contemporary policy
making: ``In order to get a better understanding and focus on wellbeing ... the govern-
ment will sponsor cross-disciplinary work ... to explore how policies might change
with an explicit wellbeing focus'' (HM Government, 2005, page 23). The 2000 Local
Government Act obliges local government ``to set the overall strategic direction and
long-term vision for the economic, social and environmental wellbeing of a local area''
(DCLG, 2008a, page 26). But the concept of well-being is itself ill defined, a term
used in multiple different contexts with different meanings and policy implications.
This instability of meaning and the associated lack of shared understanding have
been positioned as risks or barriers to communication and partnership in policy and
governance (Ereaut and Whiting, 2008). There are currently major moves to define
and measure well-being. The recent high-profile Commission on the Measurement of
Economic Performance and Social Progress was set up to explore relevant indicators
of social progress beyond gross domestic product and includes well-being as a key
outcome (Stiglitz et al, 2009). Developing societal measures of well-being is an analyt-
ical priority for the UK Office for National Statistics (Allin, 2007). We challenge this
presumed need for precision in definition and measurement of well-being. First, we
introduce the dominant use of the concept of well-being as evident in academic studies
and position this into Rose's (1996) theory of contemporary governance. We then
explore how the concept of well-being is practised discursively in local governance to
critically examine the presumed place of well-being as an overarching goal in local
policy making.
Academic knowledge and expertise contribute to framing and legitimating the
practices of central concepts of governance such as well-being and there is a sub-
stantial and growing body of work exploring the nature and definition of well-being.

Abstract. The concept of well-being has become prominent within national policy goals in the UK
since the end of the 1990s. However, the concept of well-being remains ill defined, an instability that
is increasingly understood as problematic to policy making. We engage with this terminological
instability through an exploration of how the concept of well-being is practised discursively in local
governance and critically examine the place of the concept in local policy making. In contrast to the
current enthusiasm to define and measure well-being, we argue that the conceptual instability has
inherent value for local governance. The concept of well-being is practised through a number of
potentially conflicting discourses, but it is exactly this conceptual instability that enables a local
negotiation and combination of alternative policy frameworks for local place-shaping strategies. As
such, well-being not only is an overarching goal of governance but also contributes to the dynamics
of the policy process.

Within this a mainstream approach has emerged to operationalise well-being. First,
research mostly takes a normative approach to definition and deals with the abstract
nature of the concept by breaking it down into constitutive components (see, for
example, Stiglitz et al, 2009). Debates concern the identification of independent
dimensions and the relative value of objective and subjective elements (Deneulin and
McGregor, 2009; Diener et al, 2009; Fleuret and Atkinson, 2007; Nussbaum, 2000).
Second, these philosophical elaborations of the dimensions to well-being underpin
applied, quantitative research on assessment and measurement and on the identifica-
tion of associated variables (Clarke et al, 2006; Huppert et al, 2005; McGillivray and
Clarke, 2006; Searle, 2008; Steuer and Marks, 2008). These endeavours share a com-
mon understanding of well-being as a quality that inheres to the individual. Well-being
may be influenced by factors and processes from the individual to the global in scale
and reach; it may be an objective characteristic or a subjective assessment; it may refer
to a current state or a projection into the future, but the concept of well-being itself
is individual in scale.
This treatment of well-being as an individual attribute has not always been the
case. Sointu (2005) documents the changing dominance of different competing defini-
tions of well-being since 1985 in the UK press. She identifies a clear shift in the term
from a collective attribute, mostly associated with economic well-being, through to an
individual attribute, largely related to a positive mental state. Sointu interprets this
shift in the dominant use of the term well-being as concurrent with changes to the
modes of governance and welfare provision grouped under the label of neoliberalism.
There is almost no analysis to date that explores how well-being is conceptualised
in relation to different governance regimes. Dean (2003) builds a conceptual analysis
of ``moral and political accountsöthrough which people in different social and cultural
contexts might understand and contend with ... threats to well-being'' (page 2). He
maps such potential discursive repertoires of well-being along two dimensions: first, a
universal ^ local dimension which differentiates the systems and structures through which
social, economic, and political resources are coordinated from a local agency through
which meanings, behaviour, and feelings are constructed; second, a contractarian ^
solidaristic dimension of traditions of citizenship and policy which differentiates subjects
as bargaining and competitive from subjects as attached or cooperative. Contemporary
neoliberal governance maps high on the universal and contractarian dimensional poles.
Dean's conceptual framework centres on discourses. This reflects arguments that
much of governing is about defining the situation through the discursive construction
of frameworks within which problems and policy responses are defined and negotiated
(Hajer and Laws, 2006). Within a neoliberal discursive repertoire the individual is
reassigned as the primary unit of action and analysis, as the arbiter of policy options
through consumer choice, and the site for self-management and self-actualisation
(Barnett, 2003; Harvey, 2005). Herein lies the connection that Sointu (2005) asserts
between neoliberalism and well-being. Well-being, treated as an individual quality, is
ultimately the outcome of individual choices and actions for both self and closely
connected others. Writers drawing on Foucault's notion of governmentality (1991)
examine how this apparent space for self-actualisation is one in which choice is shaped
and directed through a complex interplay of multiple rationalities and technologies
(Binkley, 2007; MacKinnon, 2000; Miller and Rose, 2008; Prince et al, 2006; Rose
et al, 2006). Local government is thus tasked to enable social inclusion through
an active, responsibilised engagement in their own well-being (Barnett, 2003). Systems
of audit and accounting, monitoring and surveillance are central to a neoliberal
governance regime, in which standardised indicators and performance targets for
local government may effectively shape both goals and visions of local government
134 S Atkinson, K E Joyce
(Miller and Rose, 2008; Rydin, 2007). Through a governmentality lens, well-being holds
promise as both discursive rationality and calculative technology by which to promote
and valorise self-actualisation and self-responsibilisation as part of a competent
citizenry. The concept can enable everyday individual behaviours to be connected
into wider rationalities of government through, on the one hand, a moral imperative
for self-management and, on the other, the external definition of responsible choices.
However, realising this promise is still an emergent process. The imperative for better
measurement of well-being and the dominant uses of the term in both academia and
the mass press can be seen as reflecting this process. To what extent, then, is this
process evident in the mobilisation of the concept of well-being in local governance
in the UK?
2 National structuring of well-being
Central government in the UK positions well-being prominently in policy goals across
various sectors, including children, health, and sustainable development. The Local
Government Act, 2000, makes well-being key to the obligation of local government
to elaborate a local Sustainable Community Strategy (DCLG, 2008b). Local govern-
ment is situated as a place-shaping agency informed and guided by the Local Strategic
Partnership, a nonstatutory forum for voluntary involvement of local communities in
local governance (DCLG, 2006). The Sustainable Community Strategy is operational-
ised and monitored through the local area agreement which is composed of a series
of targets and monitoring tools to evaluate and assess progress (DCLG, 2008b). Local
authority targets are developed within The National Performance Framework designed
to assess performance and legislated through the Local Government and Public
Involvement in Health Act, 2007.(1) This provides a national set of 198 standardised
indicators from which each local authority selects 35 in agreement with central govern-
ment plus 17 statutory targets on early years and educational progress (DCLG, 2007).
A governmentality approach expects the requirement for conceptual goals to
be translatable into defined and measurable objects to in turn structure vision so
as to constrain local priority definition by specifying a set of standardised, universal
measures (Enticott and Entwistle, 2007; Rydin, 2007). However, empirical studies of
local governance demonstrate resistance to, or at least reconstruction of, the influence
of both the discursive rationalities and such calculative technologies. Some local
government officers will have trained within or have political sympathies with alter-
native discursive repertoire of governance, particularly those that map onto Dean's
poles of local and solidaristic (2003). Moreover, various policy issues and concepts
are characterised by overt contestation which make resistance and reconstruction
more likely (Rydin, 2007). Operationalising well-being constitutes such a policy issue,
recognised as a challenge to define and measure (Allin, 2007; HM Government,
2005).(2)
The influence of an imperative for measurement on conceptual definition is evident
in examining how well-being is structured at national level. The 2006 government white
paper, Strong and Prosperous Communities (DCLG, 2006) outlines national govern-
ment's priority challenges (see table 1). Despite the broad usage of the concept of
well-being in central government directives for Sustainable Community Strategies
(DCLG, 2008a), sustainable development goals (HM Government, 2005), and national
priorities for measurement and monitoring (Allin, 2007), here the term well-being
is practised within only two of the national challenges: ``Health and Well-being'' where

it is frequently used throughout the section (page 13); ``Children, Young People and
Families'', where it reiterates one of the goals of the government's Every Child Matters
policyö``achieving economic well being'' (page 21). The National Performance
Framework (DCLG, 2007) presents the national indicator set by themes (see table 1),
and similarly places well-being in relation to health, this time adult health, and the
Every Child Matters goal of economic well-being. The national strategy and the related
set of performance indicators thus resolve tensions between concept and indicator by
structuring the concept of well-being into two distinct and contained fields.
3 Analysing local Sustainable Community Strategies
We take as our case material the Sustainable Community Strategies. Given that local
government is tasked with enabling self-responsibilisation and self-actualisation, the
term well-being may be mobilised to this end. But, given the contestation around
the definition of well-being, the term may also afford a conceptual tool for resistance
at local level to neoliberal discursive regimes. We explore how well-being is practised at
two levels within the strategy documents: first, the way local authorities frame their
vision and priority themes, which we have called the structuring of well-being; second,
the discursive practices of the term well-being and the implicit constellations of themes
and meanings.
In selecting a small number of case-study documents, we set two criteria: we excluded
large local authorities likely to be more powerful in their dealings with central government;
we wanted the local authorities to share regional concerns and regionally defined priorities
to better compare locally determined practices. Thus, we selected the Sustainable
Community Strategies from three relatively small urban boroughs within the Tees Valley
region in the northeast of England: Darlington, Hartlepool, and Stockton which are
adjacent along the north shore of the River Tees. The three Sustainable Community
Strategies were all published towards the end of 2008, together with the Local Area
Agreements (Darlington Partnership, 2008; Hartlepool Partnership, 2008; Stockton
Renaissance, 2008). The documents are complemented by interviews with two key local
government officers in each borough, purposively selected as key in the production and
subsequent management of the documents. Semistructured interviews were undertaken
between June 2008 and March 2009 on a one-to-one basis and lasted around an hour.
All interviews were recorded and transcribed before analysis. In line with assurances
of confidentiality, informants are not identified by local authority when quoted.
The analysis proceeds in three stages. First, the local structures of well-beingöthat
is, how well-being is placed within the overall visions and priority themes of the local
strategiesöare described and compared with the national structures. Second, the discursive
practices of well-being are mapped by the themes associated with the practice of the term
and against a set of dimensions adapted from Ereaut and Whiting (2008), listed in table 2.
Table 2. Dimensions to well-being (source: adapted from Ereaut and Whiting, 2008).
Dimension Description
Scale Individual or collective; human or other entities
Authority to define Subjective, self-defined or objective, expert defined
Value An end in itself or as necessary to other ends
Unified concept Reducible to elements or a holistic totality
Permanent or transitory A stable state or a dynamic process
Criteria Neutral, absence of something wrong, or better than neutral
Responsibility Located within social and institutional structures or individual
agency
Well-being in local governance 137
Third, local agency is explored through the meanings given to well-being by the key local
government officers interviewed. In the final section we draw on this three-step analysis to
reflect on the place of well-being in local government policy making.
4 Local structures of well-being
The Darlington and Hartlepool strategies are structured round a vision to improve
lives and places and, whilst well-being is not explicitly used, both emphasise oppor-
tunities for everyone to realise their potential. In Darlington the key concepts are
inclusionöa Darlington whose benefits are for all peopleöand place, which has
various aspects including environmental concerns. The economy is not positioned as
an aim in itself, but as a means to the people and place-related goals:
``we want to make the most of our potential for greater prosperity, and open up
aspiration and opportunity for everybody'' (Darlington Partnership, 2008, page 7).
Hartlepool's vision is expressed through a list of desirable qualities for Hartlepool, itself
defined as community and physical environment. These community and environmental
qualities will enable social inclusion and benefits for all.
``Hartlepool will be an ambitious, healthy, respectful, inclusive, thriving and outward-
looking community, in an attractive and safe environment, where everyone is able
to realise their potential'' (Hartlepool Partnership, 2008, page 5).
By contrast, the Stockton vision echoes the well-being domains in the Local Government
Act of 2000, being structured by economic, environmental, and social goals:
``Stockton-on-Tees driving Economic Renaissance... .
An enhanced quality of place... .
Enhanced well-being and achievement for local people'' (Stockton Renaissance,
2008, page 9).
The economy is placed at the forefront of the vision as an end in itself, with
environmental and social ends taking an equal, parallel, and intersecting role. Only
Stockton uses the word well-being in the vision statement and, by placing it into the
social strand, explicitly relates the concept to people and individuals.
The visions are developed through sets of themes which reflect closely, but not
exactly, the indicative themes of national government (see table 1). All documents
identify a theme related to the economy, although this varies as to what is included
beyond commerce and jobs. They all also contain themes related to the safety of
communities, health, and the environment. Hartlepool and Stockton echo the national
theme of stronger communities. Children and young people are high profile in all
documents but there is variation in how this category is placed. Stockton alone
specifically identifies demographic groupsöchildren and young people, and older
adultsöechoing the national performance framework. The other documents use cate-
gories of aspiration and lifelong learning for the whole population, but within which
children and young people are given a particular focus. Hartlepool and Stockton
expressly diverge from the national themes by placing leisure and the arts amongst
their themes; these are embedded within other themes in the Darlington document.
The national government's theme of tackling exclusion and promoting equality has
been incorporated into both vision and themes in all local authority strategies but
not positioned as a separate category.
Thus, whilst the national themes are mostly echoed through all the local Sustainable
Community Strategies, there are important variations both from the national structure
and between the adjacent local authorities in the framing and language of challenges.

5 Mapping the discursive practices of well-being
5.1 Themes of well-being
The term well-being is used least in Stockton where practice almost exclusively relates
to individual health:
``Our vision is for a healthier Stockton where all residents are able to take control of
their own physical and mental health and well-being ...'' (Stockton Partnership,
2008, page 35).
The few occurrences in which well-being does not refer to health relate to children
together with a connection between well-being and achievement, which can be traced
through different demographic groups, individuals, and communities.
Similarly, in Hartlepool the term well-being most often relates to mental and
physical well-being and, again, the exceptions relate to children. However, since
Hartlepool's agenda for children and young people cuts across its eight themes, well-
being is placed and practised not only under the theme health and well-being, but also
under the themes of jobs and the economy in relation to the Every Child Matters
goal of promoting economic well-being (Hartlepool Partnership, 2008, page 31) and of
community safety:
``where ... all adults take responsibility for their [children's] safety and well-being''
(page 46).
Adult well-being also features under the jobs and the economy theme in an argument
that
``residents enjoying better physical and mental well-being as a result of being in
employment'' (page 33).
The Darlington document expresses the most varied practice of the term well-
being. Moreover, the expression beyond health does not exclusively relate to children.
The term well-being is placed under three of the five themes: healthier, aspiring, and
greener Darlington. The practice of the term well-being under the healthier theme
contrasts to the other documents by talking of fulfillment, as opposed to achievement:
``happiness, fulfillment and well-being are central to the vision'' (Darlington Partnership,
2008, page 30).
The concept of emotional well-being is firmly embedded within a wide range of
processes to:
``enable people to be in control of their lives, have equality of opportunity and
aspiration, have access to the information and support they need to pursue
their aspirations, to value their place in the community, and to treat one another
with respect and dignityöthese objectives underpin emotional health and well-being''
(page 30).
Darlington is also distinctive in an explicit reference to spiritual aspects of well-being:
``[a] broader view of prosperity and aspiration as embracing spiritual and mental
well-being and the `social capital' of community involvement, as well as material
wealth'' (page 17).
Well-being is linked to community concerns of social relations, pleasant spaces, and
equity:
``Supporting informal leisure and health and well-being by reclaiming open space
for community use'' (page 35).
``A philosophical forum for debate on issues of inclusion, equality and community
well-being'' (page 41).
5.2 Conceptual dimensions of well-being
The detailed meanings implicit in the discursive practices of the term are mapped onto
a number of conceptual dimensions, listed in table 2.
Well-being in local governance 139
First, despite the dominance in current research of well-being as an individual
attribute, several uses of the term reflect either collective or nonhuman scales, particularly
in the Darlington strategy:
``our focus on improvement, and particularly on tackling deprivation, should be
matched by care for the wellbeing of the whole community and the environment''
(Darlington Partnership, 2008, page 11).
``building the social inclusion and environmental well-being that are the desired
characteristics of a sustainable community'' (page 5).
However, the meaning of this collective use is uncertain. A connection to a notion of
sustainability is implicit, as are attributes of inclusion, respect, and care.
Second, the majority of uses of the term well-being were in contexts where
some form of objective assessment of that well-being could be made by someone
else:
``We will give priority to: improving sexual health, including a reduction in teenage
conception rates; reducing levels of substance misuse; improving emotional
and mental well-being including tackling bullying; halting the rise in obesity; and
maintaining low rates of infant mortality'' (Stockton Renaissance, 2008, page 33).
Only a few cases indicated that people themselves might constitute the primary source
of assessment: an unusual combination with spiritual well-being in Darlington; refer-
ences to happiness or fulfilment, also mostly in Darlington. By contrast, Hartlepool
and Stockton eschew a subjective fulfilment in favour of `achievement' as amenable
to objective measurement given its common association with children, education, and
skills. However, the Stockton document does position perceptions of the local environ-
ment as a key influence on well-beingöpossibly a dimension to well-being, possibly
a factor affecting well-being, but certainly something to be assessed subjectively.
Third, well-being was most often placed as an end in itself and never only as a
means to another end:
``Residents enjoying better physical and mental well-being as a result of being in
employment'' (Hartlepool Partnership, 2008, page 33).
``Recognising and accommodating the broader view of prosperity and aspiration as
embracing spiritual and mental well-being and the `social capital' of community
involvement, as well as material wealth'' (Darlington Partnership, 2008, page 17).
Thus community well-being is valued for its own sake as well as for the well-being of
the individuals comprising it. Economic well-being is positioned as the means for
better future well-being, in other senses, for children and adults; environmental well-
being is positioned both as an important end in itself and as part of sustainable
living.
Fourth, despite claims that well-being captures a holistic experience of living, the
multiple dimensions comprising well-being are treated as different spheres of actionö
spheres which are both distinguishable components of well-being and distinguishable
influences on well-being. This blurring enables a reduction of well-being to these
components for monitoring and policy evaluation:
``Individuals need to be able to develop their own integrated package to improve
their well-being, including for example: employment opportunities; health improve-
ment; social care; education and lifelong learning; leisure and cultural activities''
Stockton Renaissance, 2008, page 44).
Fifth, this components approach and the need to measure well-being results in the
concept largely treated as a static state,
140 S Atkinson, K E Joyce
``improving emotional and mental well-being including tackling bullying; halting the
rise in obesity; and maintaining low rates of infant mortality... looked after children
will have similar levels of physical and mental health'' (page 33),
although implicit reference to the life-course emerges occasionally:
``good health and wellbeing for older people, rooted in healthy lifestyle choices
earlier in life'' (Darlington Partnership, 2008, page 30).
``Enhancing well-being and achievement of children and adults will ensure ... life
opportunities for all our residents'' (Stockton Renaissance, 2008, page 9).
Sixth, there is confusion as to whether well-being is more than a neutral state.
Well-being is often used rather rhetorically as a positive emotional state, but reverts
in the detail to a biomedical absence of mental ill-health:
``to promote mental well-being, to reduce suicide rates and support people with
mental health problems'' (Hartlepool Partnership, 2008, page 42).
This reduction to an absence of ill-health in part reflects the imperative to describe
and monitor the pursuit of well-being through measurable indicators. However, positive
meanings to the term are evident in other contexts:
``to support individuals to enjoy their lives and achieve wholeness and mental
well-being'' (Darlington Partnership, 2008, page 12).
``To improve the health, emotional development and well-being of all children, young
people and their families'' (Hartlepool Partnership, 2008, page 65).
Lastly, the documents combine different levels of responsibility. The local authority
reasserts its traditional responsibilities for the provision of services but expands this
with a brief for improving the context in which others can make responsible choices.
Nonetheless, children are brought almost entirely under the ambit of national and local
government:
``We will promote the health, wellbeing and achievement of children and young
people'' (Stockton Renaissance, 2008, page 12).
The emphasis on individual responsibilities, especially for health and healthy lifestyles,
is evident throughout:
``where all residents are able to take control of their own physical and mental health
and wellbeing, through living healthy and active lifestyles'' (page 36).
More interesting is the positioning of the community as taking responsibility for
subjective aspects of well-being:
``Regarding the happiness, fulfillment and well-being of individuals as legitimate
concern for the community as a whole'' (Darlington Partnership, 2008, page 12).
This exercise in mapping the place and practice of the term well-being within the
Sustainable Community Strategies indicates three concurrent discourses. The most
frequent use of the term through all three documents relates to health and well-being,
constructed as: individual in scale; defined objectively by others; a state with compo-
nent elements, although reference to the life course is noted; expressing ambivalence
as to whether well-being is a neutral state characterised by the absence of definable
features of ill-health or a positive state characterised by what remain ill-defined
criteria; strongly defined as ultimately the responsibility of the self. This practice is
so ubiquitous it clearly constitutes the contemporary dominant discourse for well-
being. In Hartlepool and Stockton any other conceptual associations beyond the
dominant discourse of health and well-being mostly relate to children, and largely
reflect achieving economic well-being, one of the goals of central government's
Every Child Matters policy. This then constitutes a secondary discourse of well-being
specifically in relation to children, also individual in scale, defined objectively by
others, a state with component elements although the dynamism of development is
Well-being in local governance 141
noted, positive rather than neutral and with responsibility lying largely with the state
and local government. These two primary discourses echo the national government
mobilisations of well-being.
However, two other well-being discourses emerge associated with concepts of com-
munity and environment. The meanings in relation to community involve desirable
attributes such as inclusion, respect, and care whilst those in relation to environment
include future prospects and sustainability. Similarly to the two more dominant
discourses, these characteristics of well-being are mostly defined objectively by others.
The term well-being is used with positive rather than neutral connotations, as in the
children and well-being discourse. The two discourses differ from the other two in
the focus on collective and nonhuman specific scales. They differ from each other
in that the community discourse treats well-being as a state with component elements
such as inclusion, respect, and care, whilst the environment discourse treats well-being
as dynamic through the concerns with sustainability and future prospects.
Community and inclusion and environment and sustainability are in themselves
leading concepts and issues for contemporary governance and are prominent both
in the name and throughout the Sustainable Community Strategies. Despite this, in
relation to well-being they emerge only as minor discourses, and significantly in only
one of the three strategies.
6 Local agency and the place of well-being
In this section we examine the discursive practices of key local government officers in
relation to the four discourses of well-being identified from the Sustainable Community
Strategies.
In line with the dominant discourse evident in both national and local government
documents, the local government officers most often explicitly connected well-being to
health:
``it's interesting that you've picked it up and said well-being, rather than health and
well-being, because I think it's difficult to separate the two.''
But the connection reflects a social model of health in which multiple factors are
influential:
``It's more than the absence of ill-health, it's about access to wide variety of services,
not only just to satisfy needs but those which make better a life.''
``Take the child protection agenda, child abuse, then that's actually about health
and well-being ... about making sure that children and young people are safe ... if
they're not safe... they're not going to grow up, they'll have mental health problems
and ... not get into work ... and the generations will carry on.''
Thinking about well-being through a social model of health requires consideration
of the consequences of the actions of other sectors on health which thus broadens the
scope of responsibility across government sectors:
``colleagues in the Jobcentre Plus who look at well-being in terms of... financial and
economic well-being, but then actually acknowledging the knock-on effects that has
in terms of health.''
``It's the benefit of having a health and well-being group because ... it's that differ-
ent combination, so having someone from regeneration involved in that means that
when we're looking at our new developments ... you think of the environment,
what will it do ... . [In terms of] quality of life.''
142 S Atkinson, K E Joyce
Moreover, this is an intersectoral responsibility that local government officers see
taken up:
``Yes, it's in health and well-being but we've all got to contribute to this... there's real
understanding that it involves all of us.''
The reduction of well-being to mental or emotional health found in the documents
is echoed, but again draws on a broad social model of health:
``I think prosperity is quite an important area that we need to push but not obviously
to the detriment of well-being, prosperity at what cost, the pressure that prosperity
can bring on people and is the balance right, stresses and strains and balancing
that against well-being.''
The reduction to absence of ill-health is largely avoided by the local officers:
``Well-being is, I would say is, a very generic title, you know. It is about what people
actually think about their lives. So at the end of the day are they happy with their lives?''
In contrast to the extensive practice of a health and well-being discourse, inter-
viewees draw little on the secondary discourse in which well-being is linked to economic
well-being of children. The presence in the documents reflects central government
imperatives to include the Every Child Matters goals, but finds little engagement
from local government officers beyond repetition of this agenda:
``For children and young people, it isn't about well-being overall but it's about are
they a productive member of society?''
``There's looking at economic well-being, that stems from the ECM [Every Child
Matters] framework.''
The lack of attention to the children and well-being discourse indicates that,
although national government rationalities may be operationalised in order to meet
national government requirements, they are not necessarily internalised. Moreover,
there is no evidence of a conscious resistance or conflict in the discursive practices
around children and economic well-being.
The relationship with central government in setting indicators and targets shows
more explicit conflict:
``There is always a worry that the central government drive is not always quite the
same as the local one.''
``It's been quite testing particularly when we get down to targets. This is all about
delivering the community strategy but of course government have their priorities
as well. So there was reconciliation to go on there.''
These comments belie any notion that the imposition of calculative regimes struc-
tures local subjectivities into framing the practices of abstract concepts like well-being.
Moreover, more detailed commentaries of how indicators relate to well-being show
resistance to measurement as the final arbiter:
``You can measure facets of it [well-being] ... but we have to be clear why we're
measuring it and how we interpret it.''
``I don't think you can measure well-being as such.''
Assessment elicited not only evidence of resistance conceptually to national govern-
ment approaches, but also local conflicts. A number of local government officers
stressed the importance of local negotiation in assessment:
``a mix between the sort of lets count it, can we measure it, that performance
management ... it's just as really important that we care... there was the two camps
and somewhere in the middle we managed to come together and say well actually
as long as we can count some bits of it and have some subjective bits then that
really for us is well-being.''
Well-being in local governance 143
``but you can't escape politics, or can't come up with the perfect answer [about what
well-being is] so it's about discussion, negotiation, and reconciliation.''
Most do propose that well-being needs breaking down into component elements for
assessment. Nonetheless, several question whether this is enough to capture fully what
well-being is:
``Whether in the end we measure well-being or measure strands within that holistic
view. ... whether you can then bunch them all together and say, well, that's a picture
of well-being, I don't even begin to know to be honest. I think the best measure
is going out and talking to people and, you know, trying to synthesise the views as
to the state of play.''
``You can also think of the well-being of the community which has more factual
components like a strong economy and low unemployment, transport that works so
you can get to where you want to, low crime. So you've got all of these factual bases
but sitting on top of that or generated by it is well-being.''
There was also resistance to a solely objective assessment of well-being, equated
with indicators, viewed as missing important subjective accounts of well-being:
``We need to measure a bit but also accept that a lot of it is subjective and somewhere
together that will give us a well-being type approach.''
Nonetheless, whilst local accounts of measurement show a nuanced understanding
of well-being, the concept is firmly treated as an attribute of individuals and an
attribute that is shaped by individual choice and self-government:
``It's more than the absence of ill-health, it's about access to wide variety of services,
not only just to satisfy needs but those which make better a life. In one word it's
about choice and creating opportunities for people to have choice and control over
their own lives.''
The dominant discourse of health and well-being as individual health, as mental
health, or emotional health or as a subjective state was at times explicitly challenged:
``It's about how we live our daily lives, how we get on with our neighbours, how we
mix in our communities, what events are going on in communities, how and where
we go shopping, how well we interact all of that stuff is much more important than
the NHS [National Health Service] and police are to the well-being agenda.''
Further challenges to the dominant discourse position well-being as dynamic within
a time-frame or a life-course approach, rather than as a static state:
``It's very easy to say well-being is about mental health but actually aspirations are
well-being, or peace of mind is actually what it's about. Aspirations have got to be
about people tracking a course for themselves and saying they've achieved it and
not just accepting what they've got.''
Although these framings of well-being largely operate at the individual scale, occa-
sionally well-being is attributed to other scales of analysis. Whilst central government
charges local government with responsibility for telling the story of place and for a
place-shaping agenda, a few local actors explicitly link this to the concept of well-being:
``So the sense of well-being through being ... as a community, we as a public have
a sense of well-being and confidence. The well-being of the borough is about the
confidence... that doesn't mean over-confidence or misplaced confidence.''
``Something else that came through strongly... the need to build a much stronger,
more caring, cohesive community, recognition that we're getting to be a more diverse
community, so we get back to sort of core community values. They [the faith and
voluntary sectors] would ask really searching questionsöwhy is prosperity so
important, what do you mean by prosperity, what about spiritual prosperity?
And then stuff about health, what's wrong with dying?''
144 S Atkinson, K E Joyce
This resonates with the alternative discourse of community and well-being identified
from the Sustainable Community Strategies. The engagement of local government
officers with an alternative discourse of community and well-being, related to issues
of care and inclusion, was provoked by central government's requirement that local
authorities work in partnership with other local agencies, particularly the voluntary
and faith agencies:
``Quite often when you produce these types of documents, the public sector dominates
the culture, but in ours the prevalent and dominant group is the voluntary and com-
munity sectors and we sat in the LSP [Local Strategic Partnership] with the voluntary
sector saying, `this is our document, the voluntary sector wrote this you know.''
The wider prominence of environment and sustainability in UK governance is little
reflected in relation to well-being. Moreover, the distinction between current and future
well-being, as expressed by the notion of sustainability, is explicitly understood as more
than environmental:
``Well-being is about sustainability not only in environmental but economic and
social terms. It's about creating economic, environmental and social circumstances
which can be sustained into the future in ways that don't disadvantage particular
groups or particular areas.''
These explorations of the engagement of key local government officers with well-
being in the production of the Sustainable Community Strategies show local agency
capacity to adopt central government framings without necessarily internalising these
uncritically, to resist and adapt such framings for local purposes, and to go beyond
such framings to reconcile them with alternative practices of the concept of well-being.
Ironically, perhaps, the mobilisation of alternative discourses in local governance is
facilitated exactly by some of the requirements placed upon local government by
national guidelines. The adherence to government directives to work in partnership
with other local actors generated a source of variation in conceptualising well-being.
The imperative to negotiate indicators and targets brought to the fore debates about
what well-being really is, how it might be captured and assessed, and the role of
measurement therein.
These negotiations around the meanings and practices of well-being do suggest that
the conceptual instability of well-being is problematic for the policy process (Ereaut
and Whiting, 2008). But, whilst local government officers recognise the challenges of
a broad, abstract concept such as well-being in policy, they also stress its importance:
``The sense of well-being is about having a vision for our communities, for our
places. Place-shaping is effectively about the same, so sustainability, well-being,
place-shapingöthey're all terms that don't easily define themselves and are open,
of course, to being defined differently and exploited because of that. But I think
when you're talking about what we're doing here, which is about defining a vision
for the future, then they are essential concepts.''
Indeed, it may be that it is this very instability of the term well-being that infuses
it with the potential to serve a creative function in locally negotiated priorities. This
proposition is supported by local actors both in the quotations above relating to the
measurement of well-being, and, here, explicitly positioning instability in the term
well-being as a provocation to creative discussion and thinking and the forging
of partnerships:
``I think that in a way because they [the terms well-being, sustainability, and place
shaping] are not easily defined it is quite useful because it gives people a chance to
sit down and thrash out what they, as a community, mean by that and that's more
important than one person like me writing clever words in a document. It's actually
getting people together and agreeing what they are about.''
Well-being in local governance 145
7 Reflections on the place and practices of well-being in local governance
The copresence in the same documents of a mix of dominant and other more minor
discourses of well-being supports the characterisation of the concept of well-being
as confused and contradictory. However, we argue against those who position this
instability as problematic and of necessity indicating the need for more precise
definition and measurement. Instead, we see the conceptual instability of well-being
as enabling the local expression of voices contesting dominant ideologies of the self,
responsibility, and governance.
The mobilisation of well-being common in academia and in the mass press indi-
cates how the concept might encapsulate the rationale for self-responsibilisation and
self-actualisation within a neoliberal governance regime. However, for this to be
realised, the holistic resonance of well-being requires work on boundary setting to
translate the concept into a measurable entity. The responsibilisation of the individual
within neoliberalism makes it logical that well-being will be conceived of as an
attribute of the individual. The need to translate any notion of well-being into perfor-
mance indicators favours an approach that breaks the concept down into component
parts. This is broadly consistent with much of the academic literature in which dimen-
sions cover a wide range of facets of human life (Nussbaum, 2000; Stiglitz et al, 2009).
However, the national and local policy vision documents, and often the key local
actors, narrow the concept far more tightly through a dominant discourse of well-
being as inseparably connected to health. This tightly bounded definition brings
important losses in the potential value of the term. The cooption of well-being as an
adjunct to health risks reducing the term to a mere synonym and the discursive
practice of well-being in the national white paper does just this. In the local Sustain-
able Community Strategies, further reductions are seen when the phrase indicates
mental well-being, or even the absence of mental ill-health, and concentrates on
demographically defined and static categories such as children or the elderly rather
than on the continuous production of health throughout the life course. Even when well-
being is framed into a social model of health, the dominance of health and well-being
as a discourse undermines the potential for well-being to function as an intersectoral
unifying concept.
The empirical mapping to identify different discourses of well-being by themes and
dimensions complements Dean's (2003) conceptual matrix of potential negotiations
of well-being by dimensions of welfare regime. The dominant discourses, and their
associated reductions, of health and well-being and of children and well-being, reso-
nate with Dean's pole of contractarian welfare regimes. The alternative discourses of
community and well-being and of environment and well-being which involve collective
and nonhuman scalesösustainability in relation to well-being, respect, and careö
resonate with the opposite pole of solidaristic traditions. However, although Dean's
dimensions were elaborated for ``different social and political contexts'' (page 2), the
confusion and contradiction within discursive practices across and within three similar
local authorities demonstrates the coexistence of different `moral and political
accounts' of well-being in the same social and political context. The local nongovern-
mental and faith organisations had a key role in effecting the inclusion of elements of
an alternative welfare regime into neoliberal framings. The particular significance here
is that, first, the expression of this alternative framing is effected through the mobilisa-
tion of distinct discourses of well-being and, second, that it is exactly the conceptual
vagueness of the concept of well-being that enables potentially oppositional framings
to coexist creatively within a single local authority strategy.
An open category of well-being provides an ideal conceptual tool through which
to negotiate tensions between alternative political and moral accounts in relation to
146 S Atkinson, K E Joyce
performance and responsibility. We propose that conceptual complexity and instability
have inherent value for local governance; the danger lies in narrowing the scope of
the concept. Much research within the governmentality tradition has focused on local
resistance to monitoring the calculative regimes of governance. But the key task for
releasing the potential of well-being as an emergent tool of neoliberal governance
is boundary work to narrow the scope of how the concept is practised and this should
be the key arena for resistance. Already, the mobilisation of well-being other than as
an outcome of self-management is practised only as minor discourses. Well-being needs
to be seen not only as the final goal and outcome of government policy, requiring
closed definition and monitoring, but more importantly as part of the dynamics of the
policy process, a stimulus to critical debate about the nature of overarching policy
goals. The emergent and potential power of the term well-being is not as a calculative
but as a conceptual technology in which well-being is best comprehended as constella-
tions of discursive practices through which place-shaping strategies may be negotiated
and reconciled locally.
