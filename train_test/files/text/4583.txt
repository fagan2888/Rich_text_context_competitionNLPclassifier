Introduction
The concept of homosociality describes and defines social
bonds between persons of the same sex. It is, for example,
frequently used in studies on men and masculinities, there
defined as a mechanism and social dynamic that explains the
maintenance of hegemonic masculinity. A popular use of
the concept is found in studies on male friendship, male
bonding, and fraternity orders. It is also frequently applied to
explain how men, through their friendships and intimate col-
laborations with other men, maintain and defend the gender
order and patriarchy (Bird, 1996; Lipman-Blumen, 1976).
However, this common and somewhat overexploited use of
the concept referring to how men, through their relations to
other men, uphold patriarchy tends to simplify and reduce
homosociality to an almost descriptive term that is used to
show how men bond, build closed teams, and defend their
privileges and positions.
A more complex, refined and dynamic view on homoso-
ciality is found in Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's (1985) classic
study Between men. Instead of using the concept merely as a
tool to analyze social bonds and power relations between
men, Sedgwick discusses the relation between different types
of desire and intimate relationships between men.
To draw the "homosocial" back into the orbit of "desire," of the
potentially erotic, then, is to hypothesize the potential
unbrokeness of a continuum between homosocial and
homosexual ­ a continuum whose visibility, for men, in our
society, is radically disrupted. (Sedgwick, 1985, pp. 1-2)
Through her analysis of the complex relationship between
homosociality, homosexuality, and homophobia, Sedgwick
develops an interesting and useful theory of gender and mas-
culinity. Her main thesis is that a continuous relation is radi-
cally disrupted and gradually turned into a discontinuous
relation of male homosocial and homosexual bonds, whereas
there is a much more continuous relation between female
homosocial and homosexual bonds.
For instance, the diacritical opposition between the "homosocial"
and the "homosexual" seems to be much less thorough and
dichotomous for women, in our society, than for men. [. . .] The
apparent simplicity ­ the unity ­ of the continuum between
"women loving women" and "women promoting the interests of
women", extending over the erotic, social, familial, economic,
and political realms, would not be so striking if it were not in

Homosociality: In Between Power and
Intimacy
Nils Hammarén1 and Thomas Johansson1
Abstract
The concept of homosociality describes and defines social bonds between persons of the same sex. It is, for example, frequently
used in studies on men and masculinities, there defined as a mechanism and social dynamic that explains the maintenance
of hegemonic masculinity. However, this common and somewhat overexploited use of the concept to refer to how men,
through their relations to other men, uphold and maintain patriarchy tends to simplify and reduce homosociality to an
almost descriptive term ­ one used to point at how men tend to bond, build closed teams, and defend their privileges and
positions. The purpose of the present article is to investigate, explore, and discuss the concept of homosociality. We will
introduce a distinction between vertical/hierarchical and horizontal homosociality. Hierarchical homosociality is similar to and has
previously been described as a means of strengthening power and of creating close bonds between men and between women
to maintain and defend hegemony. Horizontal homosociality, however, is used to point toward more inclusive relations
between, for example, men that are based on emotional closeness, intimacy, and a nonprofitable form of friendship. Relating
this distinction to the concept of and discussion on hegemonic masculinity, we will reconstruct and develop a more dynamic
view on homosociality.

strong contrast to the arrangement among males. (Sedgwick,
1985, pp. 2-3)
The discontinuity between male homosociality and homo-
sexuality results in male homosocial relationships being a
form of "male bonding", which is characterized by homoso-
cial desire and intimacy, as well as homosexual panic.
Homosocial desire refers to men turning their attention to
other men, and homosexual panic refers to the fear of this
attention gliding over into homosexual desire. In an attempt
to emphasize heterosexuality, fear or hatred of homosexuals
and misogynist language are developed.
In many ways, Sedgwick has set the agenda for studies on
homosociality. At least three different types of readings and
interpretations of the concept have evolved. First, as pointed
out above, the concept is often used to analyze how men,
through their relationships and social bonds with other men,
construct power blocs and protect male territory and privi-
lege. Second, there is a whole body of literature that pursues
queer readings of homosociality and explores the underlying
continuum of desires and relations. Finally, there is a grow-
ing body of literature on female homosociality that presents
a somewhat different picture of the phenomenon in question.
This literature connects in part to Sedgwick's arguments, but
there are also some significant developments, for example,
the questioning of Sedgwick's thesis on the asymmetry
between male and female homosociality. There are, obvi-
ously, no absolute boundaries between these three different
approaches to homosociality, but discussing them separately
makes it easier to analyze different aspects of the concept.
The purpose of the present article is to investigate,
explore, and discuss the concept of homosociality, especially
male homosocial relations. Through a reading of contempo-
rary and significant Anglo-Saxon and European literature, in
particular, cultural studies, that use the concept to analyze
different textual and social phenomena, our ambition is to
explore and problematize the use of homosociality in studies
of gender and masculinity. We will highlight different empir-
ical examples of homosocial relations, in the research and
popular culture, and will explore different aspects of homo-
sociality, looking at how these characteristics relate to each
other and what implications they might have for gender
issues.
We are especially interested in developing and emphasiz-
ing the contradictory and ambivalent aspects of the concept,
pointing both toward a defense of hegemonic masculinity and
toward a silent and slow process that might undermine or
reconstruct this power structure, as it appears today in many
Western countries. In our view, the concept of homosociality
is often defined as a mechanism and social dynamic that
explains the maintenance of hegemonic masculinity, situating
gender relations within a reasonably stable power structure.
However, by relating homosociality to the concept of hege-
mony deployed by poststructuralist scholars Ernesto Laclau
and Chantal Mouffe, our aim is to discuss and reconstruct a
structuralist and sometimes unproblematized relation between
hegemonic masculinity and homosociality, thus developing a
more dynamic view on homosocial relations.
Homosociality and Hegemonic
Masculinity
We must recognize, then, a continuum of homoerotic experience
among working-class men in a number of social settings. At the
same time we must acknowledge that this experience is silenced,
that the public language of the peer group and the workplace is
heterosexual. Moreover, it is often seriously homophobic.
"Poofters" are an object of derision, sometimes hatred. (Connell,
2000, p. 109)
There is a massive body of literature on the homosocial
ordering of men's relations, and all the different strategies
men use to maintain the gender order and uphold male privi-
leges (e.g., Bird 1996; Flood, 2008; Mac An Ghaill, 1994;
Messner, 2001). In this category of research, we have a num-
ber of classic studies, for example, Paul Willis's study
Learning to Labour (1977) about a group of working-class
boys (the lads) who, in their informal group, make not behav-
ing well, that is, not behaving according to middle-class ide-
ology, is the honorable thing to do. The lads oppose all
authorities related to the middle class, while they respect
working-class authorities. As a system of socialization and
reproduction, the school is dominated by middle-class values
and the lads put up hard resistance to people who respect this
ideology of conformity and theoretical knowledge, that is,
the teachers and the pupils who like doing their homework
(the ear `oles). This struggle also leads to the construction of
a tight and close male order that excludes and oppresses
young women, immigrants, and other men. Willis' study on
men and homosociality has in many ways become iconic and
very influential in sociology and educational research.
Another example of and angle on these male-to-male rela-
tions can be found in Michael Flood's (2008) article on how
bonds between young men also shape their relations with
women and form their sexual attitudes and behavior. In his
interviews with young men at a military university, there
were many examples of how friendship between men builds
on and involves fantasies and experiences of having sex with
women, as well as sharing memories of collective sexual
harassments and sexual encounters. Women become a kind
of currency men use to improve their ranking on the mascu-
line social scale. According to Flood, homosociality refers
first and foremost to nonsexual and same-sex bonds, involv-
ing quite high degrees of homophobia. However, it is also
possible to read and understand this externalized homopho-
bia as a sign of underlying homoerotic desires. Flood (2008)
concludes,
Male-male relations organize and give meaning to the social and
sexual involvements of young heterosexual men in powerful
Hammarén and Johansson 3
ways. Homosocial bonds are policed against the feminizing and
homosexualizing influences of excessive heterosociality,
achieving sex with women is a means to status among men, sex
with women is a direct medium of male bonding, and men's
narratives of their sexual and gender relations are offered to
male audiences in storytelling cultures generated in part by
homosociality. (p. 355)
Another much discussed issue in relation to homosocial-
ity is the proposed lack of intimacy in men's friendship rela-
tions. Homosociality is often seen as being based on and
formed through competition and exclusion. Recent research
has put forward another and more complex image of mascu-
linity and friendship. In an article exploring the "stag night",
the premarital ritual involving a man who is soon to be mar-
ried and his friends celebrating the coming wedding, there is
evidence for certain changes in men's relationships. Thomas
Thurnell-Read (2012) conducted participant observations
with eight separate stag-tour groups. The observations con-
firmed a picture of male participants actively working to
maintain and develop their friendship bonds. These groups
of men were striving for group cohesion, togetherness, and
intimacy, rather than interpersonal competition and the cre-
ation of male hierarchies. Even though this phenomenon can
be seen as a part of hegemonic masculinity, there are also
traces of changes and redefinitions of masculinity. In con-
trast to Willis' study, for example, the focus here is on the
creation of a more sensitive and intimate masculinity.
Although there is a growing body of literature that brings
forward more nuanced images of masculinity, thus stretching
and extending the concept of homosociality to investigate
potential changes in or redefinitions of hegemonic masculin-
ity (e.g., Anderson, 2008, 2009), there is also an extensive
body of work that reproduces the image of homosociality as
a mechanism that supports and reinforces hegemony and
rather stereotypic images of masculinity (Bird, 1996;
Gilmartin, 2007; Kiesling, 2005; Snyder, 2007). We are not
arguing that these authors are unaware of the complexity of
the concept, but their findings and conclusions clearly pro-
mote the notion that homosociality evidently is a part and
extension of hegemonic masculinity.
According to Connell (1995), hegemonic masculinity
refers to "the configuration of gender practice which embodies
the currently accepted answer to the problem of the legitimacy
of patriarchy", and which results in the dominant position of
men and the subordination of women (p. 77). The concept is
often used to analyze a historically changing and mobile
power structure and a hierarchical relation between different
groups of men and women. Hegemonic masculinity is con-
structed in relation to subordinated and marginalized mascu-
linities as well as in relation to femininities. However,
hegemony does not imply total power and domination but
instead is focused on a balance of forces and an ongoing strug-
gle for power. When historical conditions and social patterns
in society change, the hegemonic position can also be con-
fronted and questioned, meaning that hegemony is never
absolute or fixed. The concept thus points to possible changes
in and transformations of masculinity. Yet, Connell uses the
term complicity to theorize how men relate to power and to the
hegemonic structures of masculinity. According to Connell,
most men have a complicated, dependant, and ambivalent
relation to power. In Connell's definition of hegemonic mas-
culinity, patriarchy is changing, albeit slowly, but it is still
quite a stable power structure. The organization of gender on a
larger scale is centered on a single fact: "the global dominance
of men over women" (Connell, 1987, p. 183).
The theory of hegemonic masculinity has had a great
impact on gender studies, has become a key concept, and
could be interpreted as more dynamic and flexible than, for
example, the notion of patriarchy. However, a number of
scholars have stressed a criticism of the concept (e.g.,
Anderson, 2009; Beasley, 2008a, 2008ab; Hearn, 2004;
Whitehead, 2002). For example, Hearn (2004) points out
some critical problems with the concept of hegemonic mas-
culinity, especially the lack of a discussion of resistance and
the problems of adapting it to analyses of specific and local
masculinities. He argues for the study of multiple forms of
hegemony in the gender order and for a concept that focuses
on stable and changing structures and gender identities. In a
similar way, Beasley (2008a, 2008b) criticizes the mono-
lithic and unchanging use of the concept, calling for a subtler
and more usable concept that allows analysis of particular
forms of masculinity and men and masculinities at different
levels of abstraction.
When the concept of hegemonic masculinity is chal-
lenged, redefined, and expanded, how can we then compre-
hend, interpret, and conceptualize homosociality in relation
to the gender order? We will return to this question a number
of times, especially in the section titled "Reconstructing
Hegemonic Masculinity and Homosociality".
Homosociality and Homoeroticism
In November 1994, the metrosexual male was identified and
described by the cultural critic Mark Simpson (Coad, 2008).
This market segment consisted of young, urban, White, mid-
dle-class men ­ consumers and young narcissistic men pre-
occupied with looks, style, and image. In the 1990s, these
men and this phenomenon indicated a crisis in masculinity, a
closer relation between homo and hetero men, and a general
movement toward a new masculinity. Coad (2008) writes,
Metrosexual males may look prettier and more beautiful than
their nonmetrosexual brothers, but metrosexuality is the motor
behind more decisive changes in the realm of sexual politics; it
influences how heterosexual males interact with homosexual
males and it is in the process of replacing traditional categories
of sexual orientation. (p. 197)
However, the views on and interpretations of this phe-
nomenon vary. Shugart (2008) argues that metrosexual mas-
culinity defines and casts homosociality as a kind of universal
4 SAGE Open
male solidarity. Instead of pointing toward a new masculin-
ity, and a more sensitive and inclusive masculinity, metro-
sexuality reorganized homosociality to define homosexual
men as different from women and heterosexual men.
According to Shugart (2008), the main result of this move-
ment is a highly commercialized masculinity and a strength-
ening of normative masculinity.
To understand and position the whole discussion of a new
masculinity, and the potential erasure of the boundaries
between heterosexuality and homosexuality, we have to
return to Sedgwick. Her definition of homosociality is char-
acterized by a triangular structure in which men have bonds
with other men and women serve as the conduits through
which these bonds are expressed. However, this triangle may
portray as rivalry what is actually an attraction between men.
The argument and the idea that there is an underlying con-
tinuum between different kinds of male homosocial desires
open up a potential arena for research on the fragile boundar-
ies and lines between different masculinities and hetero-/
homosexuality. This is apparent, for example, in Eric
Anderson's study Inclusive Masculinity (2009). Anderson's
thesis is that we are today witnessing a considerable change
in masculinity. The lessening of homophobia gradually leads
to a widening of the range of masculine identities and posi-
tions that are possible to embody and perform. Anderson
nurtures an optimistic view on gender and changes in gender
structures. However, he is at the same time fully aware that
these changes are uneven, and that in many masculine con-
texts and milieus, masculinity is still defined as the opposite
of femininity and homosexuality. However, this said, he is
obviously describing and putting forward a scenario in which
masculinity is becoming gradually more inclusive and per-
missive (Anderson, 2008, 2009):
In a culture of diminished homohysteria, boys and men will be
free to express emotional intimacy and physical expressions of
that relationship with one another. Accordingly, this culture
permits an ever greater expansion of acceptable heteromasculine
behaviours, which results in a further blurring of masculine and
feminine behaviours and terrains. The differences between
masculinity and femininity, men and women, gay and straight,
will be harder to distinguish, and masculinity will no longer
serve as the primary method of stratifying men. (Anderson,
2009, p. 97)
In his influential study on homosexuality and modernity,
Henning Bech's (1997) ideas fit into this way of approaching
homosociality. He identifies something he calls absent
homosexuality. He writes, "The mode of being of absent
homosexuality can only be comprehended in its relation to
the other pole in the modern form of male-male eroticism,
i.e. the homosexuals, in its simultaneous connection to and
demarcation from them" (Bech, 1997, p. 84). He describes
absent homosexuality as a ghost-like character, present but
absent, desired and denied, known and unknown. This idea
of an absent homosexuality that structures society and men's
lifestyles and desires has certain similarities with Judith
Butler's idea of melancholia and identity. In The Psychic Life
of Power, Butler (1997) starts from Freud's theory of melan-
cholia and uses this description of clinical depression as an
inspiration for analyzing the construction of a heterosexual
order. According to Butler, heterosexuality naturalizes itself
by insisting on the Otherness of homosexuality. Then the het-
erosexual identity is based and sculptured on a melancholic
incorporation of the love that it disavows. According to
Butler, the man who "insists upon the coherence of his het-
erosexuality will claim that he never loved another man, and
hence never lost another man" (Butler, 1997, p. 139).
The idea of a homoerotic continuum has inspired several
cultural analyses. What is often found is a blurred boundary
and distinction between homosociality and homoeroticism.
There is a complex and dynamic relation between, for exam-
ple, legitimate culture and underground print culture. Janes
(2012) studied a leading British educational magazine for
children (1962-1982) and found queer subtexts and a mani-
fold of expressions of homoerotic desire in these magazines.
Janes argues that it is not surprising to find a homoerotic
space in writings produced by men for boys. The interplay
between homophobia and close homosocial and homoerotic
bonds between men created in fiction, but also, for example,
in schools and in the military, can be seen as evidence for the
thesis of a continuum of desires.
Cultural analysis shows how fragile and anxiety-ridden
the indistinctness that marks homosociality is and points
toward the continuous boundary work being done to uphold
and defend the heterosexual order (Brady, 2012). Thus, even
though we have an underlying stream of homosocial desire,
there are also constant attempts to suppress and rein in these
streams in the heterosexual and normative order. J. Jack
Halberstam (2002) describes one such cultural mechanism in
the neohomosocial triangles. In these triangles, a new con-
stellation of one heterosexual man, one overtly gay man in
the position as a rival for the woman's affections replaces the
ordinary constellation of two men and a woman.
By studying films, such as As Good as it Gets (1997) and
Chasing Amy (1997), Halberstam dissects and analyses how
the straight homophobic man enters a learning process and
learns how to accept a fully human and more gender-equal
model of manhood. However, this narrative usually ends up
in a reinforcement of the heterosexual order, although with
some new nuances.
At the end of As Good, Jack Nicholson gets the girl, the girl's
son gets better, the girl gets laid, the black guy gets lost, the gay
man gets his dog back, and that's as good as it gets. It can get
much better. I would contend, but only when we find productive
ways as feminists to theorize minority forms of masculinity.
(Halberstam, 2002, p. 363)
Although the idea and theory of a continuum of homoso-
cial desires and erotic expressions have greatly influenced
thinking in the field of gender and queer analysis, it seems
Hammarén and Johansson 5
that there is no easy escape from the patriarchal system and
hegemonic masculinity. The subversive forces point toward
breaches and leakages in the gender system, but in the end,
there is a strong tendency to subordinate and neutralize resis-
tance and utopian forms of thinking about gender and
sexuality.
Female Homosociality and the Gender
Conundrum
The suggested continuum between female friendship, feminist
solidarity, and same-sex desire has great support in the litera-
ture. However, there is also a growing critique of this way of
approaching female homosociality. Sedgwick put forward a
thesis on the asymmetry between male and female homoso-
ciality. She argues that male homosociality is first and fore-
most fashioned through the exchange of women and the
consolidation of men's power in society, whereas for women,
this sharp cleavage between homosociality and homosexuality
is not that distinct, clear, and stable. According to Binhammer
(2006), this is a somewhat idyllic and perhaps even naive
image of women's relationships. She argues that women in
many ways circulate in and are permeated by the same capital-
ist economy and system as men are. Women's bonds are not
created outside the dominant sexual economy but as a part of
it. Women's relations are therefore not by definition and auto-
matically a challenge to hegemonic masculinity.
In an interesting article, Henriette Gunkel (2009) dis-
cusses and analyzes the "mummy-baby" relationship in the
South African schools. Briefly, this is a culturally specific
form of female same-sex intimacy, although similar forms
are found in, for example, British boarding schools. An older
girl at the school helps the newcomers, the younger girls, and
provides them with emotional support. Sometimes, this rela-
tion develops into sexual encounters and relationships.
Although this is taking place in a highly policed and homo-
phobic environment, this particular form of relationship
seems to exist alongside the sexuality apparatus and to be
accepted. The point here is that homosociality needs to be
theorized and understood in different ways depending on the
national and socio-cultural context.
In contrast to this study of accepted, but highly policed
sexual relations between women, Christine Griffin (2000)
argues that all young women in the West have to deal with the
accusation of being a lesbian. This accusation also affects all
women, albeit in different ways, and with different effects.
Griffin calls for research that is open to aspects of female
friendship that are colored and permeated by desire, fantasies,
and a passion for same-sex relationships. This type of friend-
ship is immediately drawn into the naturalized model of com-
pulsory heterosexual relationships and the pressure of "getting
a man". According to Hammarén (2008), concepts of love
and intimacy have become feminized. In his study on identity
constructions among young men in multicultural suburbs,
female intimate relationships are understood as expressions
of friendship and heterosexuality. Young women who kiss,
hold hands with, and hug each other are not considered lesbi-
ans, but rather women involved in normalized feminine het-
erosexual behavior. Lesbians are therefore made invisible and
are ignored. According to a heteronormative order and male
gaze, women's intimate relations are understood as friendship
or a sexual display aimed at heterosexual men.
There is clearly a lack of research exploring female friend-
ships as something other than desexualized relations.
Therefore, sexual minority women's relations are not
explored and researched (Arseneau & Fassinger, 2006).
There is also a paucity of literature on friendships between
Black and White women, for example (Granger, 2002), or
cross-racial friendships in general. There is obviously a need
to study and problematize the idea of a continuous relation
between female homosocial and homosexual bonds and
friendships (see, for example, Marcus, 2007). The whole
idea of a sharp contrast between how this works in a male
versus a female spectrum of desire and relations would seem
to be the result of a polarized view on gender and identity
(Johansson, 2007).
Toward a Theory of Homosociality
The three different focuses on homosociality are, of course,
partly overlapping. In the literature, this concept is mainly
used as a tool to understand and dissect male friendships and
men's collective attempts to uphold and maintain power and
hegemony. The most common use of the concept is inspired
by Sedgwick's approach, and the whole discussion and idea
of a homoerotic continuum. However, most authors also
stress and focus on the radical disruption of this continuum
and the consequences of this disruption for homophobia, and
a fragile but power-seeking masculinity. In contrast, female
homosociality is described as something completely differ-
ent, and more in terms of a closer relation between sociality
and sexuality. As we have discussed, this way of framing and
analyzing homosociality is in need of reinterpretation.
We will now introduce the distinction between vertical/
hierarchical and horizontal homosociality. Hierarchical
homosociality is similar to and has already been described as
a means of strengthening power and of creating close homo-
social bonds to maintain and defend hegemony. Although
this description is primarily used to talk about men's friend-
ships and exchange of means and valuable cultural and social
capital, it is also possible to frame and investigate women's
relations using this concept. However, we will not argue that
this concept and the idea of a vertical and hierarchical homo-
sociality are totally gender neutral. Horizontal homosociality
is similar to what was earlier described as female homoso-
ciality. This concept is used to point toward relations
between, for example, men ­ relations that are based on emo-
tional closeness, intimacy, and a nonprofitable form of
friendship. There are, clearly, no absolute boundaries
between these two approaches to homosociality. Aspects of
6 SAGE Open
hierarchical homosociality in horizontal relations and vice
versa might be present, but making a distinction between
them and discussing them separately make it easier to ana-
lyze different aspects of the concept and highlight different
implications.
Bird (1996) argues that homosociality maintains hege-
monic masculinity and patriarchy, acting to institutionally
and interpersonally segregate men and women, and to sup-
press nonhegemonic masculinities. However, this common
use of the concept ­ which refers to how men, through their
relations to other men, uphold and maintain patriarchy, in
terms of emotional detachment, competitiveness, homopho-
bia, and sexual objectification of women ­ tends to reduce
homosociality exclusively to a heteronormative, androcen-
tric, and hierarchical term used to show how heterosexual
men bond and defend their privileges and positions. Is it not
possible to discuss, for example, male homosocial relation-
ships in terms of intimacy, gender equality, and nonhomo-
phobia without disregarding the possible advances of
maleness?
In popular culture, the concept of bromance (which com-
bines the words brother and romance) and womance (com-
bining woman and romance) has been introduced, discussed,
and debated. Bromance and womance refer to close and inti-
mate nonsexual and homosocial relationships between two
(or more) men or women. Womance is similar to the above-
mentioned concept of female homosociality; bromance,
however, differs from traditional understandings of male
homosocial relations and does not necessarily fit within the
construct of masculinity found in some masculinity theories
focusing on competition and hierarchies. Bromance empha-
sizes love, exclusive friendship, and intimacy that are not
premised on competition and the often described "shoulder-
to-shoulder" friendship, for example, watching football,
playing golf, or training for a marathon together. Bromances
provide a space for intimate male friendship (Chen, 2012),
even though studies also show that male friendships might
include utilitarian aspects, desire, rivalry, and self-interest
pointing toward a less idealized picture contrary to bromance
(Bray, 2003).
The concept is barely discussed by academic scholars but
returns regularly in media portrayals in movies, on TV, in
gossip magazines, and in more or less obscure blogs and
websites. According to, for example, Wikipedia, the free
encyclopedia (2012), a number of celebrities have engaged
in close bromances with associated celebrities, for example,
Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, and George Clooney and Brad
Pitt. Fictional bromances on television have also become
more commonplace and shows and dramas such as Scrubs,
Boston Legal, and Boy Meets World have had lead characters
with bromantic relationships including long-lasting friend-
ships and love. The same applies to different boy bands such
as One Direction, or films such as The King's Speech.
Examples of womances in popular culture seem to be more
exceptional, although the film Thelma and Louise is
sometimes said to be one. The terms bromance and womance
are often used to refer to two heterosexual partners, although
there have been celebrity male gay­straight bromances (also
called homomances or hobromances). We are not suggesting
that bromances and womances are similar. The popular con-
cept of bromance, unlike the concept of womance, is perhaps
a reflection of the different values assigned to male and
female friendships. In addition, while, for example, Thelma
and Louise is about fighting misogyny and male abuse, many
bromances are about how men make highly enjoyable friend-
ships and focus on each other. Consequently, there would
seem to be an underlying power relation between the
concepts.
According to Chen (2012), bromances comprise three
general constitutive elements: They are restricted to men, are
asexual, and are locations for intimacy, love, and affection
between men. They are also described as a complicated love
and affection shared by straight males. The "bro" aspect of
bromance may perhaps emphasize heteronormativity, as well
as homophobia, indicating that it is not gay because it is
between men. The focus on heterosexual men, however,
seems to differ. Bromances or homosocial relations between
gay men or between a straight man and a gay man are quite
rare, but do exist (Nardi, 2001). Bromances imply intimacy
that slips between the boundaries of sexual and nonsexual
relationships.
Bromances notably provide a space for male intimacy, in sharp
contrast to the general types of friendship that society permits
men to have. They recognize intimacy without sex, in contrast
with general conceptions of intimacy. (Chen, 2012, pp. 248-249)
In one Swedish daily newspaper, we can read about male
intimacy and bromance (Svenska Dagbladet, 2011). The arti-
cle discusses men's friendships as still being defined by
homophobia and distant relationships; however, these rela-
tionships are loosening up. Today, we can witness men hav-
ing close and intimate relationships with their friends, not the
least as represented in media and films. The article highlights
the concept of bromance and how some men's friendships
are like a kind of love relation ­ guys who hang out all the
time, talking about everything, and who like to hug each
other. Bromance is described as a nonsexual love affair
between men, which has been made possible through the
undermining of a traditional gender order (Svenska
Dagbladet, 2011). These kinds of relations are similar to
what we call horizontal homosociality, also described earlier
as female homosociality.
In constructions of homosocial relations, some differ-
ences between people are marked and some may be obscured.
For example, the assertion of gender may overlook sexuali-
ties, age, or local differences. Often, the literature on homo-
sociality has a quite one-dimensional focus. Theories of the
intersections between sexuality, class, ethnicity, age, and
gender are seldom used to elaborate critical perspectives on
Hammarén and Johansson 7
these issues (Collins, 1998; McCall, 2005; Mohanty, 1998;
Tayler, Hines, & Casey, 2010). These variables influence the
individual at the same time and constitute flexible and often
complex processes of belongings and power relations.
According to this view, power relations and social positions
are by necessity connected to a plurality of categories. An
intersectional framework acknowledges the multidimension-
ality of societal factors, identities, and power (as opposed to
focusing on class or gender individually). It also attempts to
capture how social factors influence one another. For exam-
ple, being male, heterosexual, middle class, and of the major-
ity ethnic population can be considered occupying a
hegemonic position, in contrast to being a female, working-
class lesbian. However, these positions are very much con-
textual and situated, resulting in complex and, sometimes,
ambiguous social relations. Consequently, an intersectional
approach involves locating individuals within these dynam-
ics and examining how people become subjected to a plural-
ity of changing variables.
Homosocial relations are often described in relation to
men, heterosexuality, and shared activities, such as games,
playing musical instruments, watching movies, sport activi-
ties, and drinking (Messner, 2001). However, relating to the
above description of intersectionality, homosociality does
not necessarily imply either heterosexuality or homosexual-
ity, and these relations might also entail emotional sharing.
While the concept of homosociality (and bromance) has
often been applied to relations between straight men, mixed
gay­straight or gay­gay nonsexual relationships between
men or women could just as well be defined as homosocial
(Nardi, 2001). Bromances are said to maintain heteronorma-
tive hierarchies, as only heterosexuals can have a bromance
(Chen, 2012). This particular boundary reflects the phenom-
enon of "straight panic" in which individuals experience
anxiety about how others perceive their sexuality and, thus,
feel a need to confirm their heterosexuality. However,
because men in bromances are often identified in society as
heterosexuals, they can have intimate friendships, without
risking being misperceived as gay. At the same time, bro-
mances are a source of subordination, encouraging men to
stay within rigid boundaries of sexuality norms. Bromances
are also described as restraining the pool of intimate friends
men may have--gay men are excluded, and consequently,
the culture reinforces homophobia and subordination of the
gay community (Chen, 2012).
Yet, friendships between gay men and the development of
networks and neighborhoods legitimize alternative forms of
masculinity, thereby challenging hegemonic masculinities.
In his study on the politics of friendship in the gay social
movement, Nardi (2001) claims that gay friendships have the
potential to produce communities, reinforce gay identity, and
effect socio-political change on a larger scale. The gay com-
munity helps members to find meaning and dignity in a soci-
ety that is trying to impose a hegemonic male order. The
friendships of gay men serve to create a sense of belonging
and thus help sustain a sense of "gay identity". Obviously,
gay men do not automatically pose a challenge to male hege-
mony. They do not necessarily resist notions that, for exam-
ple, men are superior to and should dominate women.
However, they may undermine traditional aspects of hege-
monic masculinity in that heteronormativity is questioned
and homosexuality is made visible (Mills, 2001).
Even though Chen (2012) characterizes bromances as
maintaining heteronormativity, she concludes her article by
claiming that bromances are a starting point for deconstruct-
ing homophobia and represent a queering of heterosexual
male friendship. Consequently, they open up space for men
to experience intimacy outside the heterosexual pairings,
which may also lead to a dismantling of compulsory hetero-
sexuality. Furthermore, and contrary to Chen, situating bro-
mances in mixed gay­straight or gay­gay nonsexual
relationships might deconstruct homophobia and contest het-
erosexist norms even more (Rumens, 2011).
Reconstructing Hegemonic Masculinity
and Homosociality
Although there have been some efforts to transcend and
redefine the concept of homosociality, pointing toward
potential changes in and redefinitions of hegemonic mascu-
linity (Anderson, 2008, Thurnell-Read, 2012), the concept of
homosociality is often, as previously mentioned, defined as a
mechanism and social dynamic that explains the mainte-
nance of hegemonic masculinity (Gilmartin, 2007, Snyder,
2007). There is a clear and growing body of literature that
brings forward more nuanced images of masculinity, thus
stretching and extending the concept of homosociality to
investigate possible reconstructions of hegemonic masculin-
ity (e.g., Anderson, 2008, 2009). The overall picture from the
research, however, promotes the notion that homosociality
clearly is a part and extension of hegemony, thus serving to
always reconstruct and safeguard male interests and power.
The growing body of poststructuralist literature on mas-
culinity and queer theory, which has resulted in theoretical
developments and a critique of structuralism, has led to a
questioning of certain categories, definitions and ways of
approaching gender, power, and power relations (Whitehead,
2002). These theoretical redefinitions and descriptions of
gender and power are perhaps utopian, but they also point to
certain changes in contemporary masculinities. In a critical
investigation of the concept of hegemonic masculinity,
Johansson and Ottemo (2013) claim that
[T]he different positions or relations described entail either
control, power and domination, or loss of control, powerlessness
and subordination. The only relation/position that allows us to
think beyond this polarized relational drama is complicity.
However, this position does not allow for much resistance or
change, because it is first and foremost described as a support
act for hegemony. (p. 4)
8 SAGE Open
Furthermore, Johansson and Ottemo (2013) argue that
Connell stays firmly within structuralism and that it is diffi-
cult to discern any differences between theories of patriarchy
and those of hegemonic masculinity.Although the concept of
hegemonic masculinity implies a certain flexibility, suggest-
ing that manifestations of hegemonic masculinity can and
will change, the theory often ends up within a structuralist
framework according to which, these manifestations will
work to secure patriarchy (Johansson & Ottemo, 2013).
From this point of view, situating homosociality within a
structuralist framework of hegemonic masculinity will auto-
matically locate homosocial relations within a stable power
structure.
Whitehead (2002) criticizes the concept of hegemonic
masculinity along similar lines. He argues that the concept
upholds an unreservedly structuralist position, marginalizing
the subject and acts of resistance that are exercised by, for
example, women or men not acting in accordance with nor-
mative gender ideals. In this view, the individual is lost
within, or subjected to, an ideological apparatus and innate
drive for power.
Although offering a more nuanced interpretation of male
dominance than patriarchy, hegemonic masculinity ultimately
suffers from the same deficits, for it posits an intentionality
behind heterosexual men's practices (a "will to power" if you
like) while suggesting that women and gay men are somehow
excluded from this otherwise innate desire to dominate and
oppress. (Whitehead, 2002, p. 92)
The fact that the concept of hegemonic masculinity has
had a great impact on gender studies, and has become a key
concept in studies on masculinities, has obviously influenced
how we comprehend issues such as resistance, agency, and
subjectivity, and hence, how we understand and interpret gen-
der relations, constructions of masculinities, certain catego-
ries, and definitions.According toWhitehead (2002), theorists
using this concept are excused from having to engage in any
deep analysis of the actual practices of men, taking it as a
given that these practices always are representations of domi-
nant patterns of masculinity. Consequently, the concept of
hegemonic masculinity is a useful descriptor of dominant
masculinities, but its overuse results in the conflation of fluid
masculinities with an overarching structure. In an attempt to
resolve the inconsistency between a deterministic model of
(male) power and the multiplicity of masculinity that widens
the range of masculine positions that can be embodied and
performed (as exemplified by certain forms of homosocial
relations), Whitehead calls for hegemonic masculinity to use
an understanding of the social as a contested arena. Instead of
leaving room for ambiguity, Whitehead claims that the con-
cept of hegemonic masculinity is often used as a "blanket
descriptor of male power" (Whitehead, 2002, p. 93).
To achieve this ambiguity, without leaving us with a the-
ory free from power relations, we will turn to Ernesto Laclau
and Chantal Mouffe's notion of hegemony. Using their defi-
nition, we believe that it is possible to develop a dynamic
understanding of the relation between hegemonic masculin-
ity and homosociality, detaching the discussion from its
structuralist legacy.According to Laclau and Mouffe (Laclau,
1990; Laclau & Mouffe, 1985/2001), hegemonic struggles
are a symptom of the always displaced nature of society, con-
tingency, and the gaps different groups try to cover. Any ulti-
mately fixed meaning or completely centered structures are
impossible, and we are instead offered partial fixations and
attempts at transcending difference and constructing a center.
Hence, the subject ­ constructed in relation to the open char-
acter of every discourse ­ can never be totally fixed and sta-
ble, but is changeable and transitional. Subjectivity and
agency should be understood as being rooted neither in
something external to the structure nor in something com-
pletely internal to it, instead the structure itself is undecid-
able and nonrepetitive.
Laclau and Mouffe offer us a more open field of dis-
courses and language games, leading to a dynamic view on
hegemonic articulations and struggles. Hegemony is never
fully accomplished but is in motion, and because it is onto-
logically conditioned by an omnipresent contingency, we
will never be able to go "beyond hegemony". Yet, Laclau and
Mouffe do not suggest that we will never be "free" in a dys-
topian sense, rather, this can be interpreted as a call to strug-
gle against repressive structures ­ to redefine and rearticulate
the current hegemony and construct a more desirable (tem-
porary) hegemonic order. Consequently, hegemony is some-
thing to struggle for; the main question is in what ways we
should hegemonize the social. Relating this post-Marxian
concept of hegemony to hegemonic masculinity would allow
us to analyze potential transitions and changes, for example,
articulations of potentially radical strategies for changing the
gender order. Social change is not primarily based on destroy-
ing a certain order but instead, on redefining this order.
Although the ambition of the concept of hegemonic mas-
culinity has been to create a flexible tool for investigating a
mobile power structure, discussions on hegemonic masculin-
ity as well as on homosociality often end up in an analysis
that solely fixates and upholds the contemporary and oppres-
sive gender order. Using a poststructuralist approach to hege-
mony, we are not suggesting that we would replace these
kinds of analyses with naive and optimistic conceptualiza-
tions of society. Instead, if we accept that the social is open
for redefinitions and transitions, leading to the possibility of
different subject positions, a poststructuralist approach could
help us to analyze how potential hegemonic rearticulations
not only lead to the reinforcement of a given gender order but
also to the formation of a possibly redefined and perhaps
more "desirable" order.
Changes in masculinity, for example, the construction of
horizontal homosociality, in which emotional closeness, inti-
macy, and a nonprofitable form of friendship are developed,
are not necessarily a sign of a strengthening of patriarchy as
Hammarén and Johansson 9
many discussions on hegemonic masculinity suggest. The
same applies to bromances, which description sometimes
differ from traditional understandings of male homosocial
relations and do not always fit within the construct of mascu-
linity found in some masculinity theories focusing on com-
petition and hierarchies. In accordance with a poststructuralist
reading, our proposal is that we not predetermine the agents
of change and instead, remain open to the possibility of dis-
covering potential movements toward a redefined hegemony
that contains the seeds of utopian visions of the gender order
(Kimmel, Hearn, & Connell., 2005). Even Connell (1995)
suggests that it is not necessary to offer a general descriptor
of hegemonic masculinity but instead, posits that a hege-
monic form of masculinity is the form that is the most desired
in a particular context. Consequently, different contexts can
inhabit different hegemonic ideals.
We believe that it is important for gender research to
develop a theoretical model that emphasizes the dynamic
qualities of Connell's concept of hegemonic masculinity. By
exploring different masculine positions and carefully investi-
gating contradictory aspects of hegemonic masculinity, it is
possible to discern different patterns of power in everyday
life ­ for example, feminist movements and alternative mas-
culinities ­ and possibilities for subverting gender. At the
same time, it is obviously important to discover new forms of
nostalgic and conservative masculinities that are struggling
to protect men's privileges and power positions in society.
We are not suggesting that, for example, metrosexuality or
bromances aren't shifts in acceptable forms of masculine
performances. The idea that male friendships defined by
homophobia and distance seems to loosen up, resulting in
close and intimate friendship relations, can still be inter-
preted in an accepted but still reformulated framework of
hegemonic masculinity, although perhaps a more desirable
one. It does not follow from Laclau and Mouffe (Mouffe,
2005), and their suggestion that there is no "beyond hege-
mony", that there is no "beyond patriarchy" and that mascu-
linity will always be hegemonic in relation to femininity.
Consequently, for a rearticulation of hegemony to be desir-
able, we obviously have to break with Connell's notion that
hegemonic masculinity is always defined as being opposed
to and privileged over femininity (Connell & Messerschmidt,
2005). We also have to question the notion that all hegemo-
nies are equally bad and try to discern whether different
hegemonies are specific to different forms of masculinity.
Part of such a struggle could involve articulating elements
historically related to women and men as well. And this is
perhaps what happens when male performances and friend-
ships might be associated with intimacy, love, and affection
(Johansson & Klinth, 2008). However, articulating intimacy
and emotional closeness to men may not lead to a complete
disruption of masculinity but perhaps to a potential recon-
figuration of hegemonic masculinity that is not a priori and
necessarily privileged in relation to femininity.
Conclusion
Although the concept of homosociality may uphold and
maintain homogeneous gender categorizations, focusing on
single-sex groups and often referring to hierarchical gender
relations in which men strengthen certain hegemonic gen-
der ideals, applying a poststructuralist understanding of the
concept helps us to problematize a common structuralist
understanding of the relation between hegemonic mascu-
linity and homosociality. Moreover, by making a distinc-
tion between the vertical and horizontal practice of
homosociality, we can develop a more dynamic view on
homosociality. Taking a vertical/horizontal view on homo-
sociality emphasizes its relation to a structuralist hege-
monic gender order, that is, to what degree homosocial
relations uphold and maintain "traditional" hegemonic
male and female social positions. A poststructuralist read-
ing of hegemony makes it possible to interpret potential
rearticulations of hegemony as part of the struggle for gen-
der equality and a more just society. Perhaps the develop-
ment and conceptualization of bromances and horizontal
homosociality point toward variation and transition and,
consequently, to a reconfiguration of hegemony, including
tendencies toward an eventual transformation of intimacy,
gender, and power relations. However, we acknowledge
that we are only touching on potential and partial redefini-
tions of hegemony, also those often closely connected to
the middle class, and, thus, we need to analyze the gender
order more thoroughly by taking an intersectional approach
to examining how these performances may affect more
general gender relations in society.
In addition, there is a clear need to study and problematize
the idea of a continuous relation between female homosocial
and homosexual bonds and friendships. The whole idea of
there being a sharp contrast between how this works in a
male versus a female spectrum of desire and relations seems
to be the result of a polarized view on gender and identity,
not the least related to the notion that hegemonic masculinity
is defined as opposed to and privileged over femininity. It is
likely that the more polarized the gender order and the more
heteronormative the sexual codes are the more traditional
forms of homosociality one expects to find in society. As this
order slowly changes and loosens up, thus rearticulating
hegemony, homosociality may take other forms, and friend-
ships may relate not only to same-sex relations but also to
heterosocial forms of friendship and intimate nonsexual rela-
tions (Rumens, 2011, 2012). For example, in the absence of
societal policing of gender and sexual orientation, men
would be able to have friendships with other men regardless
of sexual orientation (Chen, 2012). Sexual orientation would
not be the basic principle for friendship. Rigid boundaries
between friendships and romantic relationships would not be
necessary, and the potential for fluidity in relationships
would increase.
10 SAGE Open
Men would not need to categorize people in terms of "friend" or
"potential lover," but would instead have a singular category of
relationship in which they could both provide and receive
intimacy and care. This proposition would also undermine
sexual fluidity as a woman-specific construct, and permit men to
experience more fluidity in both relationship forms and sexual
relationship partners. (Chen, 2012, p. 262)
Adding age/generation to this analysis, some Swedish
studies have shown that recent generations of men raised by
feminist mothers and fathers in the 1970s and afterward are
more emotionally open and more expressive (Johansson,
2007). There is also less concern among contemporary young
men about the notion of being identified as gay, and, thus,
they are more comfortable with exploring deeper friendships
with other men (Johansson, 2007). Finally, relating to Chen
and her vision presented above, situating homosociality in an
intersectional framework develops, emphasizes, and makes
visible the inconsistent and ambiguous aspects of homoso-
ciality, focusing not only, as in the case of Chen, on straight
men but also on women and different sexual positions and
generations. Using this approach further allows us to point
toward a defense of a structuralist framing of hegemonic
masculinity by referring to vertical/hierarchical homosocial-
ity and toward a potential and slow process of rearticulating
hegemony by referring to horizontal homosociality.
