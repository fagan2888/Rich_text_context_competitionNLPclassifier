Background. In 2006, the largest mumps outbreak in the United States in 20 years occurred. To understand
prior mumps seroprevalence and factors associated with the presence of antibody to mumps virus, data from the
1999­2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were analyzed.
Methods. A mumps virus­specific enzyme immunoassay was used to measure the seroprevalence of serum
immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody among NHANES participants aged 6­49 years. Participants were grouped on
the basis of 10-year birth cohorts, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using SUDAAN software, and
logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors.
Results. The overall age-adjusted seroprevalence of IgG antibody to mumps virus during 1999­2004 was 90.0%
(95% CI, 88.8%­91.1%). Seroprevalence was higher among US-born non-Hispanic blacks (96.4% [95% CI, 95.5%­
97.2%]) and non­US-born Mexican Americans (93.7% [95% CI, 92.0%­95.2%]). Seroprevalence was significantly
lower in the 1967­1976 birth cohort (85.7% [95% CI, 83.5%­87.8%]). The variables sex, education, and race/
ethnicity/birthplace were independent predictors in at least 1 of the birth cohorts.
Conclusions. The overall estimate of 90.0% is at the lower end of the estimated population immunity (90%­
92%) needed to achieve herd immunity. Lower seroprevalence among groups suggest that they represent populations
at an increased risk. For mumps control, high vaccine coverage and high population immunity must be achieved
and maintained.
Mumps is an acute viral illness characterized by uni-
lateral or bilateral parotitis preceded by nonspecific
symptoms, such as fever, headache, malaise, and my-
algia. Complications of mumps include deafness, mas-
titis, aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and, in postpu-

bertal age groups, oophoritis and orchitis. Mumps is
endemic in most of the world, and many countries do
not include mumps vaccine in their routine childhood
immunization programs. As of December 2005, 110
(57%) of the 193 World Health Organization member
states had included mumps vaccine in their national
immunization programs, most by including the com-
bined measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine [1].
These include a majority of industrialized nations and
countries undergoing economic transition [1].
In the United States, live mumps vaccine was licensed
in 1967 and was recommended for routine use in 1977
[2]. By 2000, the number of reported mumps cases in
the United States had declined to 338 [3]. Because this
met the Healthy People 2000 reduction goal of !500
cases [4], the United States set a goal of mumps elim-
ination by 2010 [5]. By 2005, only 314 cases of mumps
(incidence, 0.1 cases per 100,000 population) were re-
ported in the United States, a decline of 99.7% since
1968 [6]. However, in 2006 the largest mumps outbreak
in 20 years occurred, with 6584 cases (incidence, 2.2
668 · JID 2010:202 (1 September) · Kutty et al
cases per 100,000 population) [7]. The age groups most affected
were 10­19, 20­29, and 30­39 years of age, a majority of whom
had been inoculated with at least 1 dose of mumps vaccine.
The occurrence of this outbreak led some to question the fea-
sibility of mumps elimination and prompted us to evaluate the
seroprevalence of antibody to mumps virus in the US popu-
lation, specifically in those age groups most affected by the
2006 outbreak. Data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative
sampling of the US population conducted during 1999­2004,
were used to assess mumps seroprevalence.
METHODS
Survey design and participants. NHANES is conducted by
the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, to provide national statistics on the
health and nutritional status of the noninstitutionalized US
civilian population. Since 1999, NHANES has been a contin-
uous survey, with data released every 2 years. The present anal-
ysis makes use of data collected from 1999 through 2004. The
sampling plan for the survey is a stratified, multistage, prob-
ability-cluster design, to provide a sample that is representative
of the US population [8]. Black Americans, Mexican Ameri-
cans, adolescents, and low-income persons were sampled at
higher frequencies than were other participants, to provide sta-
ble estimates for these groups. Participants in the survey un-
dergo household interviews and then standardized physical ex-
aminations and the collection of biological samples at special
mobile examination centers [8].
Serum samples from participants 6­49 years of age were
available for testing for the presence of immunoglobulin G
(IgG) antibody to mumps virus. Race/ethnicity was categorized
on the basis of a participant's self-identification as non-His-
panic white, non-Hispanic black, or Mexican American. Par-
ticipants who did not fit into one of these categories were
classified as other and were analyzed with the combined pop-
ulation but were not analyzed separately. Other variables an-
alyzed included the following: (1) family income, based on a
poverty-index ratio calculated by dividing total family income
by the poverty-threshold index adjusted for family size at the
year of the interview and categorized as either below the poverty
level or at or above the poverty level [9]; (2) birthplace, cat-
egorized as within or outside the United States; (3) health in-
surance, categorized as any or none; (4) regular source of health
care, defined as having 1 or more sources of health care; (5)
education, based on individual education for those aged 20­
49 years and education of head of household for those aged
6­19 years, measured as last year of school completed and
categorized into 2 levels (less than or equal to high school
graduate or more than a high school education); and (6) crowd-
ing index, derived from household size and number of rooms
in the household (not including bathrooms), calculated as the
number of persons per room (PPR), and categorized as !0.5,
0.5­0.99, and 1 PPR. Informed consent was obtained from
all participants, and the Ethical Review Board of the National
Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, approved the protocol.
Laboratory testing. A commercially available indirect en-
zyme-linked immunosorbant IgG assay (Mumps IgG ELISA II;
Wampole Laboratories) was used for the detection and quali-
tative determination of IgG antibody to mumps virus in serum
specimens. As reported by the manufacturer, the relative sen-
sitivity of this test is 96.6% (95% confidence interval [CI],
94.0%­99.3%), and the relative specificity is 90.4% (95% CI,
82.4%­98.4%). The cutoff points for IgG antibodies to mumps
virus, based on index standard ratio (ISR) values, were as fol-
lows: seronegative, ISR of 0.90; indeterminate, ISR of 0.91­
1.09; and seropositive, ISR of 1.10. All samples with sero-
negative or indeterminate results for mumps virus IgG were
retested with an equal number of randomly selected positive
serum samples. If retested samples had positive results, they
were reported as IgG seropositive. Serum samples testing either
negative or indeterminate were considered negative for pur-
poses of this study. For quality assurance purposes, a 10%
random-sample repeat of the entire specimen collection set was
performed.
Statistical analysis. Participants were grouped into 10-year
birth cohorts based on the age groups that were affected during
the 2006 mumps outbreak, to assess the seroprevalence of an-
tibody to mumps virus, to identify differences in mumps an-
tibody seroprevalence that might have occurred in correlation
to changes in vaccination policies, and to ensure that there was
a sufficient sample size for each group. The birth cohorts were
1949­1956, 1957­1966, 1967­1976, 1977­1986, and 1987­1998.
Estimates of seroprevalence were weighted to represent the total
civilian noninstitutionalized US household population and to
account for oversampling and nonresponse to the household
interview and physical examination [10]. Standard errors were
calculated using SUDAAN software [11]. Estimates were consid-
ered to be unstable if the relative standard error around the
proportion of participants who were not seropositive for IgG
antibody to mumps virus was 130% or if the estimate was based
on !10 persons negative for mumps IgG antibody. The exact
binomial method was used to calculate 95% CIs [12]. Differences
between seroprevalence estimates were evaluated by examination
of P values calculated by a univariate t statistic obtained from a
general linear contrast procedure in SUDAAN; differences with
were considered significant. No adjustments for multiple
P ! .05
comparisons were made.
To identify independent predictors of mumps seropositivity
in the birth cohorts that had the lowest seroprevalence of an-
tibody to mumps virus (ie, 1967­1976, 1977­1986, and 1987­
Mumps Virus Antibody in the US · JID 2010:202 (1 September) · 669
1996 birth cohorts), a logistic modeling procedure in SUDAAN
was used, with from the Satterthwaite-adjusted F sta-
P ! .05
tistic considered to indicate significance. Because of the strong
association between place of birth and mumps seroprevalence,
the variables race/ethnicity and birthplace were combined (race/
ethnicity/birthplace) in the modeling procedures and grouped
as follows: US-born non-Hispanic whites, US-born non-His-
panic blacks, US-born Mexican Americans, and non­US-born
Mexican Americans. In addition, because of the small numbers
of foreign-born non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks
in the sample, these subgroups were not included in the mod-
eling procedure. Interactions with the combined race/ethnicity/
birthplace variable and each cofactor were evaluated. Odds ra-
tios (ORs) and their 95% CIs are reported for all cofactors.
RESULTS
Response rates. Of the 22,036 participants aged 6­49 years
sampled for NHANES from 1999 through 2004, 18,433 (84%)
were interviewed and 17,672 (96% of those interviewed) were
examined. Of those examined, 15,383 (87%) had serum sam-
ples available to test for the presence of IgG antibody to mumps
virus. The percentage of participants whose serum samples were
tested varied with age and was higher among those aged 12­
19 years (91%) and was lower for those aged 6­11 years (83%),
compared with other age groups (range, 84%-86%) ( ).
P ! .001
In addition, the percentage tested varied by race/ethnicity
(Mexican American, 88%; non-Hispanic white, 87%; non-His-
panic black, 86%), sex (male, 88%; female, 86.4%), and house-
hold crowding (1 PPR, 88%; 0.5­0.99 PPR, 87%; !0.5 PPR,
86%) but did not vary by place of birth, poverty index, health
insurance, education, or regular source of health care.
Seroprevalence of IgG antibody to mumps virus. The age-
adjusted seroprevalence of IgG antibody to mumps virus in the
US population aged 6­49 years during 1999­2004 was 90.0%
(95% CI, 88.8%­91.1%) (Table 1). Seropositivity was signifi-
cantly higher among those in the earliest birth cohort, 1949­
1956 (93.4% [95% CI, 90.7%­95.6%]), than among those born
from 1967 through 1976 (85.7% [95% CI, 83.5%­87.8%];
) or among those in later birth cohorts (1977­1986,
P ! .001
90.1% [95% CI, 88.5%­91.6%]; ) (1987­1998, 90.3%
P ! .01
[95% CI, 88.8%­91.7%]; ). The seroprevalence of IgG
P ! .05
antibody to mumps virus was significantly lower among those
born during 1967­1976, compared with all other birth cohorts
(1949­1956, 1957­1966, 1977­1986, and 1987­1998; ).
P ! .001
The pattern in mumps seropositivity by birth cohort differed
for each of the combined race/ethnicity/birthplace subgroups
(Figure 1). Among US-born non-Hispanic whites, the pattern
over time was similar to that of the combined population: a
statistically significant decline in mumps seroprevalence from
the 1949­1956 cohort to the 1967­1976 cohort and a subse-
quent significant increase in mumps seroprevalence for the
1977­1986 and 1987­1998 cohorts. Among US-born Mexi-
can Americans, the pattern was similar to that among non-
Hispanic whites, except that there was only a statistically sig-
nificant increase in mumps seroprevalence between the 1967­
1976 cohort and the 1977­1986 and 1987­1998 birth cohorts
( ). Among US-born non-Hispanic blacks, seroprevalence
P ! .01
decreased over birth cohorts and was significantly higher among
those born from 1949 through 1956 than among those in the
1977­1986 and 1987­1998 birth cohorts ( and ,
P ! .05 P ! .001
respectively). Mexican Americans not born in the United States
had a very different pattern of mumps seroprevalence across
birth cohorts than did the other 3 groups. Although not sta-
tistically significant, there was an increase in seroprevalence
among those born during 1949­1956 until 1967­1976 (P 1
) and a statistically significant decline between 1967­1976
.05
and 1987­1998 ( ).
P ! .05
Mumps seroprevalence varied among the race/ethnicity/birth-
place subgroups overall and by birth cohort (Table 1). US-born
non-Hispanic blacks had consistently higher mumps seroprev-
alence than did US-born non-Hispanic whites and US-born
Mexican Americans in the combined population ( ) and
P ! .001
across all birth cohorts ( to ). In addition, US-
P ! .05 P ! .001
born non-Hispanic blacks had higher mumps seroprevalence
than did Mexican Americans not born in the United States for
both the 1949­1956 and 1957­1966 birth cohorts ( for
P ! .05
both comparisons). Among Mexican Americans, those not born
in the United States had higher mumps seroprevalence than did
those born in the United States in the combined population
( ) as well as in the 1957­1966 ( ) and 1967­1976
P ! .001 P ! .05
( ) cohorts. Similarly, Mexican Americans not born in the
P ! .001
United States had consistently higher mumps seropositivity than
did US-born non-Hispanic whites in the combined population
( ) as well as in the 1957­1966 ( ), 1967­1976

( ), and 1977­1986 ( ) cohorts.

Predictors of presence of IgG antibody to mumps virus. In
all birth cohorts combined, those born in the United States
had lower seroprevalence than did those not born in the United
States (89.0% [95% CI, 87.7%­90.3%] vs 94.7% [95% CI,
93.6%­95.7%]; ) (Table 1). This association was con-
P ! .001
sistent across birth cohorts but was statistically significant only
for those born during 1967­1976 and 1977­1986 ( ).
P ! .001
For all birth cohorts combined, mumps seropositivity was lower
among males than among females (89.0% [95% CI, 87.5%­
90.4%] vs 90.9% [95% CI, 89.6%­92.1%]; ). This as-
P ! .05
sociation was consistent across birth cohorts from 1957 on but
was statistically significant only among those born during 1977­
1986 and 1987­1998 ( ). Among the combined popu-
P ! .05
lation and across the birth cohorts, no significant association
between mumps seropositivity and family income, education,
ability to identify a health care provider, or health insurance
was found; findings for household crowding were inconsistent.

In the logistic regression model for the 1967­1976 birth co-
hort, race/ethnicity/birthplace was the strongest predictor of
the presence of antibody to mumps virus (Table 2). Mexican
Americans not born in the United States (adjusted OR [aOR],

born in the United States (aOR, 6.8 [95% CI, 3.0­15.3]; P !
) were more likely to be seropositive for IgG antibody to

mumps virus than US-born non-Hispanic whites, after ad-
justment for all other cofactors. The estimate of the ORs for
Mexican Americans not born in the United States and non-
Hispanic blacks born in the United States may be unstable
because they are based on 15 or fewer persons seronegative for
mumps virus. In the model for this birth cohort, lower edu-
cational status was predictive of lower mumps seroprevalence
(aOR, 0.7 [95% CI, 0.4­0.98]; ).

DISCUSSION
As mumps continues to be endemic in most parts of the world,
with the annual incidence of mumps in the absence of im-
munization being in the range of 100­1000 cases per 100,000
population [1], importation of mumps will continue to occur
in the United States [13]. To maintain mumps control in the
United States, it will be critically important to achieve and
maintain high population immunity to mumps. Several studies
in the United Kingdom have estimated the population im-
munity for mumps to range from 75% to 92% [14­16].
In the present study, the seroprevalence of IgG antibody to
mumps virus was used as a measure of population immunity
against mumps. The calculated seroprevalence of antibody to
mumps virus in the noninstitutionalized US population aged
6­49 years during 1999­2004 was 90.0%, with a lower confi-
dence limit of 88.8%. This value is below the estimated level
of immunity (92%) [16] needed to achieve and maintain elim-
ination. It is likely too that this value is an overestimate of the
population immunity for several reasons. Individuals who have
had documented positive IgG to mumps by enzyme immu-

noassay have developed mumps within months to years, sug-
gesting that positive enzyme immunoassay values may not re-
flect immunity [17, 18]. In addition, unlike measles and rubella,
no antibody level has been defined as a surrogate measure for
individual immune protection from mumps disease [19].
The prevalence of antibody to mumps virus among those
born during 1967­1976 (85.7%, with an upper confidence limit
of 87.8%) was significantly lower than that for all other birth
cohorts and was well below the estimated threshold needed to
maintain herd immunity in the population. This finding is
similar to findings for measles and rubella seroprevalence for
this birth cohort from other NHANES 1999­2004 studies [20,
21]. The lower seroprevalence for this birth cohort might reflect
changes in the epidemiology of mumps in the United States
and changes in US mumps vaccination policy and practice. In
1967, when live mumps vaccine was first licensed, the Advisory
Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended
that the vaccine be considered for use in children approaching
puberty, in adolescents, and in adults, especially men [22]. In
1968, the recommendations were expanded to consider im-
munizing all susceptible children 11 year of age, but mumps
vaccine was not introduced into the routine immunization
schedule [23]. In 1971, the US Food and Drug Administration
licensed MMR vaccine; 6 years later, in 1977, the ACIP rec-
ommended routine immunization with MMR vaccine [2] at
age 15 months. During a resurgence of mumps in 1986­1987,
older schoolchildren, students on college campuses, and young
adults were most affected [24]. However, it was during a re-
surgence of measles in 1989 [25] that the ACIP recommended,
starting in 1989, a second dose of MMR vaccine for children
entering kindergarten or first grade (ie, 4­6 years of age) [26],
thereby improving protection against both measles and mumps.
The introduction of mumps vaccine and recommendations
for its routine use led to decreasing exposure to circulating
mumps virus, which might explain the lower seroprevalence of
IgG antibody to mumps virus in the 1967­1976 birth cohort
[24]. In addition, this cohort was born too early to receive the
second dose of vaccine at school entry (as recommended in
1989) and less likely to have been affected by the school im-
munization laws [22, 27]. These 2 factors might have contrib-
Mumps Virus Antibody in the US · JID 2010:202 (1 September) · 673
uted to the low overall seroprevalence rate among those born
from 1967 through 1976.
In the present study, non-Hispanic blacks had consistently
higher seroprevalence than did other race/ethnicity groups, re-
gardless of the vaccination era. Studies examining racial dis-
parities in vaccination coverage have found that non-Hispanic
black children have significantly lower rates when compared to
non-Hispanic white children [28­30]. Thus, higher seroprev-
alence among non-Hispanic blacks might reflect greater ex-
posure to natural infection.
Mexican Americans not born in the United States had a higher
mumps seroprevalence than did those born in the United States.
This may be a reflection of greater circulation of mumps virus
in Mexico, where MMR vaccine was not routinely used before
1998. Thus, the pattern of seroprevalence to mumps among non­
US-born Mexican Americans might reflect virus exposure and
natural infection during their early life in Mexico.
During the 2006 mumps outbreak [7], the highest incidence
of mumps was seen in the age groups 14­17 and 18­24 years,
corresponding to the 1987­1998 and 1977­1986 birth cohorts,
respectively. The seroprevalence among persons in these birth
cohorts was 90%, the lower limit of the estimated seroprev-
alence needed for herd immunity. In addition, non-Hispanic
whites (incidence, 9.95 cases per 100,000 population) were
found to be most affected during the 2006 outbreak. One pos-
sible explanation for this finding is the lower seroprevalence
found among non-Hispanic whites than among the other race/
ethnicity groups. Another explanation may be that transmission
of mumps occurs rapidly in close quarters, as demonstrated by
the outbreaks in schools, on college campuses, and in the mil-
itary [7, 31­35]. This may explain why persons in the 1967­
1976 birth cohort with the lowest seroprevalence were less af-
fected, given that they were most likely no longer in school or
college.
Females had higher seropositivity of IgG antibody to mumps
virus than males in NHANES 1999­2004. This may be due to
targeted vaccination of women of childbearing age for the ru-
bella component of the MMR vaccine [36]. Although males
had lower seropositivity than females, they were less affected
during the 2006 mumps outbreak. The incidence of mumps
among male patients was 7.7 cases per 100,000 population,
compared with 13.5 cases per 100,000 population among female
patients. This could be partly explained by differences in social
behavior, with closer interpersonal contact among females than
among males [37].
There are limitations to this study. Mumps vaccination and
history of mumps disease are not recorded in NHANES; hence,
we do not know the effect of vaccination on mumps seropos-
itivity. Specific data on access to immunization services was
not collected; having a regular source of health care was used
as a surrogate for access to immunization. Self-reported socio-
economic status and measures of health care access (such as
having a regular source of health care or having insurance) at
the time of the survey might not reflect the status of these
factors at the time of vaccination or exposure to disease. Final-
ly, small sample sizes in certain sociodemographic subgroups
may have limited our ability to detect statistically significant
associations.
Data from NHANES 1999­2004 demonstrate that the se-
roprevalence of antibody to mumps virus in the US population
was at the low end of the estimate needed for herd immunity.
Lower seroprevalence among some groups suggest that they
represent populations at increased risk for mumps. To achieve
mumps control in the United States, it is imperative to ensure
that children and adults who are at high risk receive age-ap-
propriate 2 doses of MMR vaccine [38, 39], to maintain the
high levels of mumps immunity as well as the high seroprev-
alence of antibody to mumps virus in the population.
