Summary
This article uses the fate of the Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE)--a
process of classroom transaction mandated by the Right to Education (RTE) Act 2009 as
a case to illustrate the point that altering policy alone is insufficient to effect change and
inclusion. The existing paradigm, in this case, the culture of performativity in educa-
tion, through its obeisance to marks, grades, and detention as indicators of learning and
merit, feeds off and in turn sustains beliefs in the role of education in maintaining the
social status quo.
The provisions of the RTE Act 2009 were built to work together as an organic unit to
support the well acknowledged principle that knowledge cannot simply be transferred
from teacher to pupil. Using this principle known as constructivism, which also under-
lies Argyris's single-loop learning, each child constructs her own understanding and
learning. The teacher acts as a facilitator by continuously observing and assessing what
the child has understood, and on this basis proceeding to clarify or add information. This
process of continuous comprehensive evaluation was mandated in the RTE to enhance
both learning and inclusion. Academic authorities under the RTE Act were notified by
the central and state governments for prescription of curriculum and evaluation proce-
dures in conformity with the framework of the NCF 2005.
However, as this article shows, it was found that instead of the intended CCE based
on the NCF 2005, another procedure, also incidentally named CCE, was being imple-
mented. This CCE process with a system of assessment that was internal to the school
had been developed (at short notice) for the secondary stage to replace the 10th class
board examinations of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).
The manner in which policy implementation can go astray has been demonstrated in
this article as it attempts to describe and explain the appeal of this CCE, which came
neither from the authorized academic authority nor was appropriate for the stage at
VIKALPA · VOLUME 43 · ISSUE 1 · JANUARY-MARCH 2018 15
which it came to be widely adopted. The article dwells
on the policy actors, their motivations and interests, and
this all too hasty application of CCE which predictably
failed to enhance learning at the developmental stage
at which it was applied. The ricocheting effects of this
misapplication have led to the RTE Act being placed in
Parliament to allow the state to bring back the pass­fail
system, and the culture of performativity and exclu-
sion at the elementary stage that the RTE Act had aimed
at eradicating.
In conclusion, this article returns to implications of this
case for any cultural change in public policy without
first changing the social norms that sustain such policies
of exclusion.
As undergraduate students of psychology, one
of our first `experiments' in the psychology lab
was on `knowledge of results'. Here, a `subject'
(usually a wary student from another course) was
blindfolded and instructed to turn a pointer on its pivot
to make an angle of 45 degrees, 30 degrees, etc. Subjects
who were told how close they came to the required
target were found to progressively improve with each
attempt, while the subjects who were given no such
simultaneous feedback of assessment, or `knowledge
of results', did not.
I was unimpressed by this introduction to the psy-
chology of learning; did something as obvious as this
really need to be demonstrated by an experiment?
Today, I worry that this fundamental principle seems
to be overlooked to ensure that every child learns. This
happens, even as the right to education and learning is
avowed as integral to the 12th plan agenda of inclusive
growth. Issues of annual surveys of learning achieve-
ment in schools, of reintroduction of 10th class board
examinations, and a return of detention policies domi-
nate current emanations from the NITI Aayog, the
Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), and
the Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE),
respectively--all apparently in an endeavour to ensure
the betterment of learning for all children in schools.
Foregrounding these is the disenchantment with
Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE), a
curricular intervention intended to ensure that every
child learns through the institutionalization of a
process that is child-centred, integral to the learning
process and of benefit to both "learners themselves and
to the educational system by giving credible feedback"
(NCF, 2005, p. 71).
In 2009, the Right to Education (RTE) Act had man-
dated `continuous and comprehensive evaluation (CCE)
of a child's understanding and ability to apply the
same' (Section 29.2.h) to complement policies such as no
detention and age appropriate admission at the elemen-
tary stage among its slew of reform measures having
the potential to transform the institutional structure
and climate of elementary education in India (Kumar,
2017). Simultaneously, for the secondary stage, the CBSE
announced a paradigm shift from examination to effec-
tive pedagogy in the replacement of its 10th class board
exams with school-based evaluation--CCE with effect
from 2011 (CBSE, Circular No. 39).
However, barely after it lifted off, CCE is in trouble
at both the elementary and the secondary stages.
In October 2016, at the 64th meeting of the CABE,
expressing concern at "deteriorating learning outcomes
it was resolved, to amend the no-detention policy by
making suitable amendments to the RTE Act", and
in August 2017, a Bill in Parliament to this effect was
introduced (MHRD, 2016, p. 16). Thus, the imminent
return of pass­fail exams in elementary classes will
make CCE redundant at the elementary stage. While at
the secondary stage, the announcement, almost imme-
diately thereafter, by the CBSE, of the restoration of
10th class board exams for the 10th grade from the year
2017­2018, knolls the demise of the CCE even at this
stage (CBSE Circular No. Acad-05).
The culture of performativity in education--a term
usedbyStephenJ.Ball(2000)todescribesociety'sobses-
sion with statistics, testing, grades, and goals--has
often been rued in reiterating that education should be
about all round development of potential rather than
about marks in an annual exam. In this context, there-
fore, this article attempts to understand this rejec-
tion of CCE--a system which had sought to counter
this culture of performativity through a child-centred
intervention rooted in the principle of simultaneous
feedback in order to ensure that every child learns.
The article reflects on the research on CCE in prac-
tice, using the lens of organizational theory to draw
implications for the success and sanguinity of future
attempts at ensuring that each child is learning. At
the outset, however, this article explains how learning
is constructed--a process which those familiar with
organization theory will recognize as akin to single-
loop learning (Argyris, 1976).
16 POLICY LESSONS FOR INCLUSION FROM THE FATE OF THE CCE WITHIN THE PERFORMATIVITY CULTURE IN EDUCATION
CONSTRUCTIVISM, LEARNING LOOPS AND
THE RTE
In order to understand how the RTE Act attempted to
facilitate learning, one first needs to appreciate the
process of learning itself. Frequently conceptualized as
the filling of a jar, it has for long been recognized that
learning is not as simple as transferring knowledge
from one mind to another. For instance, all students on
hearing the same lecture do not acquire the same knowl-
edge, and will not reproduce it like a tape playing back
a recording. The fact that every child understands and
learns differently tells us that the process of learning
involves connecting new information to existing under-
standing and constructing new knowledge with the help
of cognitive resources, tools, and social interactions.
If knowledge cannot be transferred, then the teacher
cannot be a giver but the facilitator of that knowledge.
Within classroom interaction, the child makes explicit
his/her current understanding (and is thus an active
partner and not a passive receiver)--thereby enabling
a teacher to correct, clarify, add, and further facilitate
the construction of knowledge in a continuous process
of assessing, evaluating, and facilitating. The process
of learning thus builds on a student's existing knowl-
edge, with facilitation from the teacher. Known as
constructivism, this paradigm of learning is at the core
of the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005.
This along with a process of CCE, of what needs to be
done next to facilitate learning by the teacher, has been
described as `two of the most progressive measures to
reconceptualise and re-imagine what was essentially
a rote-based education system' (Economic & Political
Weekly [EPW], 2017, p. 9).
The similarity of this process toArgyris and Schon's (1978)
single-loop learning might immediately be apparent to
students of organizational theory, for it too is grounded
in constructivism (Kinsella, 2006). Furthermore, an under-
standing of the learning loop and the management of
organizationallearningasinterdependentprocessesallow
one to more readily appreciate the clauses of the RTE Act
2009 that sought to make provision for the enabling condi-
tions for a constructivist process of teaching and learning
in classrooms.
THE ORGANIZATION OF LEARNING AND THE
RTE ACT
The RTE Act restricts class sizes, to a maximum of 40
children at the primary stage and to 35 children per class
for grades 6­8, to ensure that the teacher may devote
the individual attention necessary to active engagement
and discovery of each child's current state of knowl-
edge. To empower teachers to devote themselves solely
to teaching (and escape deployment for cattle censuses,
etc.), the RTE Act prohibits non-teaching duties except
for those related to election, census, and disaster
management. A teacher's duty has been for the first
time been specified by law, as are a minimum number
of school working days and teacher working hours
(distinct from instructional hours). Clauses provide
for teachers to be professionally trained, and for their
service conditions and remunerations to be according
to declared norms--a sore point with schools gaining
from exploitation of the teacher labour market.
All children must only be in full-time formal schools
(and not in part-time non-formal education centres for
the poor). For the first time in India, a school is defined
by law and norms for basic infrastructure (like an
all-weather building, etc.) prescribed.
With schools, teachers, and children in place, the RTE
Act mandates the conditions for learning and construc-
tion of knowledge--a school environment without
corporal punishment, fear, or threats. A provision for
no-detention, already a policy in 23 states, was put
into the law. If education is child-centred, active, and
focused upon all-round development, then evaluation
has necessarily to be an ongoing process of observation
and correction. Therefore, CCE was mandated as part
of the teaching­learning process.
Thus, in the RTEAct, learning is understood as being con-
structed in a process very similar to Argyris and Schon's
single-loop learning through a continuous process of
detection and correction of error, while other clauses of
the Act put together the conditions for such learning to
take place, which, as in the case of Senge's learning organ-
izations (Senge, 1990), work together as a system.
Working together as a system, the RTEAct had the poten-
tial for actualizing individual goals of personal learning
and national goals of the right of elementary education
of each and every child. Perhaps, this strength was also
its weakness. The removal of any one key element also
had the potential to unravel it.
CONTINUOUS AND COMPREHENSIVE
EVALUATION (CCE)
The term CCE is indigenous in its genesis. CCE was rec-
ommended as an alternative to annual examinations
VIKALPA · VOLUME 43 · ISSUE 1 · JANUARY-MARCH 2018 17
in the report of the India Education Commission (1964-
66, also referred to as Kothari Commission), and reiter-
ated in the National Policy on Education, 1986. Evolving
in its conceptualization, the NCFs of 2000 and 2005
recommended it as a system of evaluation `integral to
the teaching learning process' (Sharma, 2014, p. 3). CCE
involving `ongoing observational and qualitative assess-
ments of children and the use of feedback within learning
activities using a "daily dairy" as the tool in this process
was advised by the National Curriculum Framework
2005' (NCF, 2005, p. 73). In this sense, CCE is a process
of assessment for learning and has been described as `an
Indian form of formative assessment' (Sreekanth, 2017,
p. 3). CCE primers produced by the National Council of
Educational Research and Training (NCERT, n.d.) demon-
strate its use for all subjects at the elementary stage.
For the secondary stage, the CBSE conceptualized CCE
as sets of `formative assessments' (FAs), the scores
for which, fed into the scores of term-end tests called
`summative assessments' (SAs) that provided a final
score at the end of each grade. Worldwide, the process of
FAis used by teachers and students to provide feedback
during instruction in order to adjust ongoing teaching
and learning. Acknowledged as a route to raising
student achievement, the term FA has acquired a buz-
zword status (Louie et al., 2011). SA, in contrast to FA,
involves tests or regular activities separate from the
teaching­learning process, such as in tests at the end of
a completion of a chapter or at the end of term.
THE CCE IN PRACTICE
Research studies on implementation of the CCE report
confusion among teachers and parents about CCE
(Chopra & Bhatia, 2014; Jhingran, 2016; Kothari &
Thomas, 2012; Mohanty, 2010; Sharma, 2016; Singhal,
2012). Srinivasan (2015) reports that teachers are as
scared of CCE as the students.
The system of evaluation, instead of becoming inte-
grated into the process of teaching and learning, were
felt as an extra burden. The shifting of focus away from
teaching­learning to the process of assessment and
record-keeping, and of time being wasted in the process
of maintaining records, were a common refrain from
the field (Jhingran, 2016; Nawani, 2013; Sharma, 2016;
Singhal, 2012). Mohanty (2010), for example, reported
that students feel that it will mean more assessments for
them on an ongoing basis. Teachers feel that their work
has increased tremendously with assessments having
additional descriptive indicators.
In place of the envisaged flexibility in curriculum trans-
action, it was found that `the requirements of following
certain formats has come to dominate schooling and
that teachers fulfil the needs of the CBSE­CCE in a
mechanical manner' (Srinivasan, 2015, p. 81).
The situation was not much different at the elemen-
tary stage in government schools. In a study of CCE
programmes of 12 states and union territories (UT)
across India, it was found that instead of following the
more flexible pattern advised by the NCERT, the CCE
material of most states comprised of `formal prescrip-
tive and rigid recording procedures of the FAs' (Sharma,
2014, p. 14). The study noted with disapproval that the
practice of `gathering information of child's learning
progress through different cycles of FAs and SAs is
being used to label her/him with a particular level and
is beating the purpose of assessment for learning and
assessment as learning' (Sharma, 2014, p. 13).
Similarly, it was noted by Jhingran (2016, p. 95) that
the teaching­learning process itself, far from becoming
child-centred, `continues to be teacher centred and
focussed on rote memorisation, choral repetition and
the copying kind of drill-oriented activities'. The main-
taining of records too had become dissociated from
what was taking place in the classroom and,
[t]he most disturbing finding from the field was that
across states and schools, CCE records are exclusively
maintained for showing supervisors, and for reporting
to parents, never for understanding students learning
progress, gaps and needs. Recording of assessment find-
ings (qualitative or marks/grades) seems to be an end in
itself. (Jhingran, 2016, p. 100)
These disparaging research reports on the CCE add
to the negative opinions expressed in meetings of the
Committee for Assessment and Implementation of CCE
in the context of the No-Detention Provision in the RTE
Act set up in 2012 (also known as the Geeta Bhukkal
Committee). At the final meeting of this subcommittee,
the chairperson summarized its views thus:
In all the field visits undertaken by the sub-committee
and in class room interactions with the student, teachers
and parents, there is a common perception about negative
impact of No Detention policy. All of them have expressed
a need for detention policy if the performance of schools
and students have to be improved. So many states raised
this issue in the CABE meeting because they are dealing
with field responses. In the state legislative assemblies,
Education Ministers are being questioned on the rationale
and implication of introducing No Detention policy.
18 POLICY LESSONS FOR INCLUSION FROM THE FATE OF THE CCE WITHIN THE PERFORMATIVITY CULTURE IN EDUCATION
In Haryana, Call Attention motions have been moved on
the subject. If the records of other state assemblies are exa-
mined, such discussions are likely to be available. This
was a demand for re-examination of this provision by
large number of states which led to constitution of the
Sub-Committee to review this matter in detail....
(Report of the `Committee for Assessment and Implem-
entation of Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation
[CCE] in the context of the No Detention Provision in the
RTE Act' GOI, [2014, p. 233])
Expectedly, this subcommittee recommended amend-
ment of the roll-out plan of no-detention; and their
advice for `a system of state-wide assessment at grades
3, 5 and 8--with no detention up to grade 5, provisional
promotion after grade 5 and detention after level 8', all
but rendered CCE as superfluous (GOI, 2014, p. 17).
CCE: QUITE CONTRARY
As observed earlier, contrary to the high expectations
from CCE in bringing about a transformation in the
education system, through a process of FA integrated
into the teaching learning process, what transpired
was quite reverse. Not only were CCE/no-detention
resisted politically but field experiences of CCE too
belied the anticipated freedom from examinations,
stress reduction, and child-centred flexibility in curric-
ulum transaction.
Moreover, although two variants of CCE were available
(one developed by the NCERT for the elementary stage
and the other by the CBSE), in the field the variants of
the CBSE model (characterized by FA scores added to
SA scores) were predominantly found to be in use in
most states--even at the elementary stage, and also
in central schools such as Kendriya Vidyalayas, and
Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (for which the NCERT
was the notified academic authority for curriculum and
evaluation under the RTE Act).
THE CBSE MODEL OF FORMATIVE
ASSESSMENT
The findings from research studies that the CCE in
practice (predominantly the CBSE model of CCE) was
confusing and burdensome instead of stress reducing
and learning enhancing prompts questions about why
it was perceived that way.
Closer examination of the CBSE manual (CBSE, 2010a)
and the procedures for FA reveals an operationaliza-
tion of FA inconsistent with internationally accepted
definitions such as those of UNESCO's International
Bureau of Education (IBE; 2013)2 which stipulates FA
as integral to the teaching­learning process, involving
students in the process of assessment and feeding
back to inform students and the adaptation of ongoing
curriculum transaction. Globally, FA is understood as a
`process' (and therefore not marked or graded, as was
done in the case of the FAs of the CBSE)--`any assess-
ment system that involves tests or regular activities that
are interpreted in relation to performance criteria and
which are reported are deemed summative assessment
of learning' (Brown, 2013, p. 2). Recognizing the intri-
cacy of this process, Black (2007) explains:
A frequent misunderstanding is that any assessment by
teachers, and in particular the use of a weekly test to
produce a record of marks, constitutes formative assess-
ment.Itdoesnot.Unlesssomelearningactionfollowsfrom
the outcomes, such practice is merely frequent summa-
tive assessment: the key feature, interaction through
feedback, is missing. Another misunderstanding is the
belief that this is about the coursework assessment that
forms part of some GCSEs; such assessment cannot
aid learning unless there is active feedback to improve
pupils' work as it develops. (Black, 2007, p. 2)
CBSE's operationalization of FA as marked FAs and
added to SAs (end of term SA) has evoked academic
censure. Even the report of the Geeta Bhukkal
Committee set up in 2012 notes that academic member
Vinod Raina questioned the lack of coherence between
CCE of NCERT and CBSE, and reported inadequa-
cies in the understanding of CCE; academic member
Dr Kiran Devendra of NCERT is quoted as having
`expressed concern on conducting more number of
tests in the name of CCE'; and that academic member
Professor Nargis Panchpakesan, `criticised that most
of the schools are adopting CBSE CCE against NCERT
CCE' (GOI, 2014, p. 170).
According to Sharma (2016, p. 88), `the traditional
system of examinations is being merely dressed up in
a new set of terms (formative and summative assess-
ment, scholastic and co-scholastic domains, and the
like) instead of the necessary holistic shift in approach
to assessment that is actually called for'. While
Srinivasan (2015, p. 62) derisively refers to this `divi-
sion of the assessment of the so-called scholastic areas
or curricular areas into FA and SA as the CBSE's major
contribution to the evolution of the CCE framework'.
VIKALPA · VOLUME 43 · ISSUE 1 · JANUARY-MARCH 2018 19
Sreekanth (2017) raised objections to `a centralised
prescription and monitoring mechanism [which] takes
away the essence of FA' (p. 13) and to the summing up
of FA and SA scores, `aggregating the two together to
produce end of year grades is questionable' (p. 4).
`Thereasonforthisstateofaffairs'accordingtoSrinivasan
(2015, p. 82), who had studied the implementation of
the CBSE model of CCE in Jawaher Navodaya Schools,
may be attributed to the gaps in the understanding of
CCE at the planning level in the three important organi-
sations involved in the business, namely, NCERT, CBSE
and NVS'. On the other hand, perhaps with greater
insider information, Sreekanth (2017, p. 14) attributes
the `missing linkages and coherence between CCE
concept and operationalization to the lack of engage-
ment of suitable expertise for the academic activity,
having theoretical and practical understanding, appro-
priate to the context, and keeping current concerns in
clear focus'. He raised issues regarding understanding
of the philosophy of FA among the group formulating
the CBSE manual on CCE:
The composition of the group that has formulated the
CBSE manual is largely drawn from the practitioner
community (teachers) whose practical experience and
interests are of course important to be taken into account.
However, there is a lack of involvement of academics in
the group who understand the philosophical dimensions
of the reform and the appropriate role of FA in the new
context. (Sreekanth, 2017, p. 14)
If indeed the CBSE's formulation of CCE resulted from
misunderstanding of the FA construct, then three ques-
tions come to the fore. First, the question of its launch
in this condition by the CBSE; second, of the unques-
tioning adoption of this model, even at the elemen-
tary stage by the central government and by most state
governments; and third, of the appeal of this model
over the NCERT model of CCE.
LAUNCH, ADOPTION, AND APPEAL WITHIN A
PERFORMATIVITY CULTURE
Launch by CBSE
Parallels come to mind from a historic, premature, and
ill-fated launch of NASA's Challenger, which exploded
soon after lift-off. Researchers who examined this
disaster through a behavioural ethics lens found that
in common with many organizational and policy deci-
sions, the construal of the issue had a determining effect
on the decision to launch. Ambiguity regarding the
technical safety of the Challenger's `O-Rings' should
have,accordingtoTenbrunselandBazerman(2011,p.2),
been perceived from the perspective of safety first.
However, framing it as a management decision ensured
the fading out of issues such as safety first, while issues
of time and efficiency, and of pleasing the bosses at
NASA came to the fore.
In the case of CBSE's CCE, Sreekanth (2017) points out
that the reform was launched without a pilot study
being carried out to ascertain its feasibility and modifi-
cation needs. He says, `in the case of CCE of the CBSE,
focus group discussions were held with stake holders
and the scheme was then launched across all schools
affiliated to the CBSE...' (p. 18). The CBSE (2009)
announced its scheme to all the heads of the CBSE insti-
tutions on the 20 September 2009, and in explaining its
rationale quoted the then Union Minister for Human
Resource Development:
Push the process of examination reform in accordance
with NCF 2005. This will include making the Class X
examination optional, thus permitting students contin-
uing in the same school (and who do not need a board
certificate) to take an internal school assessment instead.
(Press Information Bureau [PIB], 2009)
ThisquoteisfromtheAgendaitemNo.7oftheMinister's
first 100 days agenda announced on the 29 June 2009
(PIB, 2009). It was perhaps the rush to meet the dead-
line of the Minister's 100 day agenda which prompted
CBSE's urgency to launch its CCE without trial.
ADOPTION BY GOVERNMENTS
Srinivasan (2015, p. 62) points out that `after RTE,
2009 came into effect; the CBSE extended the imple-
mentation of CCE for Classes VI­VIII in the schools
that are affiliated to it. The CBSE published a series of
manuals on CCE. Later, many states introduced CCE
for Classes I­VIII'. Thus, within less than a year, the
CBSE had not only extended itself to its own schools
beyond the secondary stage (CBSE, 2010a) but the
same model was adopted by schools under the central
government and, as reiterated by Srinivasan, state
governments too adopted this model for the elemen-
tary stage of Classes I­VIII. One explanation for this
is obvious, when the RTE Act came into effect in 2010,
CBSE's CCE model was readily available, whereas
NCERT exemplars did not come out for a few more
years thereafter (Jhingran, 2016).
20 POLICY LESSONS FOR INCLUSION FROM THE FATE OF THE CCE WITHIN THE PERFORMATIVITY CULTURE IN EDUCATION
Neo-institutional explanations for the ready adoption
of the CBSE's CCE lie in the view of institutions being
embedded in and influenced by their environment (field)
from whom they seek legitimacy. In situations of uncer-
tainty rather than functional efficiency, which is often
difficult to ascertain, logics of confidence and good faith
prevail (Meyer & Rowan, 1977), in this case, faith in the
CBSE. Furthermore, isomorphism with dominant others
in the field offers both supportive buffering and shared
legitimacy. Viewed from these standpoints, reassurance
feasibly met convenience in state governments' decision
to adopt a tried and tested model of CCE already in use
in private CBSE and central government schools.
`PERFORMATIVITY CULTURE': THE APPEAL OF
CBSE'S CCE
`Currently the board examinations negatively influ-
ence all testing and assessment throughout the school
years beginning with pre-school' (NCF, 2005, p. 71).
Even as most would agree with this statement in the
NCF, it is equally true that examinations, marks, and
grades represent the familiar that one is comfort-
able with. Marks and grades enable one to know how
a child is doing in school. Across schools, their rela-
tive performances in board exams are perceived as
indicators of their standing. Thus, even as one might
disparage such a culture of performativity in the
education system, the fear of negotiating the educa-
tional minefield devoid of such performance markers
supports resistance to their obliteration.
Conceding the necessity to acknowledge social and
parental subscription to the performativity culture,
Dhankar (2017) points out that the most important
argument of those wanting to rescind CCE and rein-
state a compulsory board is that `the children will reach
the next level of school grossly under­prepared .... This
argument cannot be dismissed summarily'.
The choice and reinforcement of CBSE's model of CCE,
with its multiple-registered, marked, and summated
tests in preference over the NCERT's model (devoid of
such dramatic evidences) was thusly set in the logics
of a culture of performativity. Jhingran (2016, p. 16)
points out that `in most states, the conduct of periodic
assessments using a fixed set of prescribed tools and
techniques and recording marks/grades or descrip-
tive qualitative statements is considered the impor-
tant part of CCE'.
Such performativity culture reasoning was evidenced
in the Gujarat state government's choice of CCE model.
In this model, FA, although described by the manual as
an integral part of teaching­learning activity, `inclu-
ded grading and marking and a weightage in the
semester and year-end final grade'. Astonishingly, it
was found that the state-level core group was aware that
this was conceptually not appropriate; nonetheless, they
opined that this `needs to be done because formative
assessment will not get done if it is not graded and no
weightage is assigned to it' (Jhingran, 2016, p. 54).
Perhaps this finding of a deliberate twist of meaning to
FA in the above case to serve the purpose not of CCE,
but of teacher accountability, supports Sreekanth's app-
rehension about the CBSE's FA, and whether `as an
affiliating and monitoring agency for the schools affil-
iated to the Board, it has adopted its own priorities
and mechanism to implement CCE which is not in
conformity with the philosophy of FA' (2017, p. 15).
Prevailing dispositions in favour of performativity
in education make it easy to comprehend the attrac-
tiveness to policymakers of assessments which serve
multiple, even contradictory purposes, exemplifying
Ball's statement (2000, p. 2) that `performativity is a
technology, a culture and a mode of regulation, or a
system of terror in the operation of which purposes are
contradictory, motivations blurred'. Apparently, the
very appeal of CBSE's CCE lay in its unproblematic
accommodation, in contrast to the systemic transfor-
mation required by NCERT's CCE, within the existing
examination-valuing status quo. Second, its adoption
by CBSE-affiliated and central government schools lent
credence to its functional fitness as an appropriate tool
for the assessment for learning that it purported to be.
But above all, perhaps the deciding factor in its appeal
to policymakers, as seen in the case of Gujarat, resided
in its potential as a tool for teacher accountability.
Thus, as seen in this section the CCE in practice, in its
design and implementation, was mutated by under-
standings of education by actors e.g. policymakers,
teachers, parents, society--within the frame of reference
of a performativity culture, reducing it to a competitive
game and a set of motions to be ticked off as done. The
frame itself, through which the CCE was construed and
understood, remained untouched.
CONCLUSION
What does the lesson of the CCE portend for education
within the agenda of inclusive growth? Is it, as sugg-
ested by the experiment described at the beginning
VIKALPA · VOLUME 43 · ISSUE 1 · JANUARY-MARCH 2018 21
of this article, about the psychology of learning and
the presence/absence of the all-important feedback
(learning) loop connecting performance achieve-
ments and objectives? Would a policy designed to fit
the feedback loop correctly into the teaching learning
process change policy outcomes to ensure that every
child learns? As seen in this article, the intent of policy,
its tools, and its processes of implementation are medi-
ated by understandings and meaning-making by actors
in the system.
In the context of India, Wiener's (1991) research on the
belief systems of educational policymakers shows that
India's per capita income and economic situation is less
relevant as an explanation than the belief systems of the
state bureaucracy. According to Weiner:
At the core of these beliefs is the Indian view of the social
order, notions concerning the respective roles of upper
and lower social strata, the role of education as a means
of maintaining differentiations among social classes, and
concerns that `excessive' and `inappropriate' education
for the poor would disrupt existing social arrangements.
(1991, p. 5)
It was in line with such beliefs, widely shared by
educators, social activists, trade unionists academic
researchers, and, more broadly by members of the
Indian middle class, holds Weiner, "that resources
were channelled into elite government and state aided
private schools, in an effort to create an educated class
that is equal to educated classes in the West, and that
is capable of creating and managing a modern enclave
economy" (1991, p. 5).
Weiner could well have been echoing Weber's (1946
[1922­1923], p. 280) famous `switchmen' metaphor:
Not ideas, but material and ideal interests, directly govern
men's conduct. Yet very frequently the `world images'
that have been created by `ideas' have, like switchmen,
determined the tracks along which action has been pushed
by the dynamic of interest.
What the psychology of learning experiment failed to
consider or convey to me at that time, I realize now, is that
the feedback to the learner is mediated through the will
of the interventionist and his/her motivations to enable
the learner to learn. Policy is implemented by adminis-
trators, teachers, and others in the system, and its lines
of action are determined by the `dynamic of interest'.
Education policy necessarily involves teachers but often
fails to `involve' them. Gavin Brown reminds us,
It cannot be assumed teachers will enact policy as
intended. Indeed there is strong evidence that how
teachers conceive of a phenomenon, acts to filter (i.e.
control what they will pay attention to), frame (i.e.
control how they will understand what they pay atten-
tion to), and guide (i.e. influence their behaviour) their
responses to that phenomenon. (2016, p. 1)
Policy intentions require shared values and commit-
ment to purpose--including, as pointed out by Jhingran
(2013, p. 31), `teachers' beliefs about children's learning,
teaching, assessment, the hierarchical teacher­student
relationship, etc.' Nawani (2013, p. 40) too reminds us,
as does the fate of the RTE mandated CCE, `isolated
reforms in techniques of measurement will not have
much meaning unless accompanied by concomi-
tant changes in the classroom culture'. The culture of
performativity which pervades our system of education
and our conceptions of what education is, what it is for,
and even the organization of the process of teaching­
learning itself needs overhauling, if it truly wants to
embrace every child within the larger agenda of inclu-
sive growth. The manner in which a CCE was instantly
prepared and administratively applied to the educa-
tional system without reflection, testing, or preparation
is but an example of the culture that needs to change in
order to walk the talk of inclusive education.
NOTES
1. The views expressed in the article are personal.
2. According to UNESCOs IBE Glossary of Curriculum Term-
inology, both Formative assessment and Assessment for
Learning are part of the teaching learning process and
used only for understanding learner's needs, and involves
learners in the process:
Assessment for learning- Assessment of learner's progress
and achievement, the primary purpose of which is to
support and enhance learning by adapting the educational
process to meet the learner's needs whenever required. See
also `Formative assessment'. (Pg 6)
Formative assessment- Assessment conducted throughout
the educational process with a view to enhancing student
learning. It implies: eliciting evidence about learning to
close the gap between current and desired performance
(so that action can be taken to close the gap); providing
feedback to students; and involving students in the assess-
ment and learning process. (Source: CCSSO 2008). See also
