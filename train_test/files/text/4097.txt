Introduction
Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequently diagnosed female
cancer, and the second leading cause of deaths related to
cancer in women worldwide.1 Risk factors such as aging,
breast density (BD), lifestyle, and genetic parameters have
all been implicated in breast carcinogenesis.2,3 Of these risk
factors, BD has been shown to be very significant, espe-
cially in younger women.4 Established BC risk factors asso-
ciated with genetics and lifestyle are also confounders for
BD through hormonal and genetic pathways and modify the
relationship between BD and BC risk.5 Breast density refers
to the proportion of the breast that is composed of fibro-
glandular tissue and is represented by the radiopaque areas
on a mammogram.6,7 Although BD is regarded as a strong
risk factor for BC, it is still contentious whether it is an
independent risk factor or whether it merely reflects oppor-
tunities for cancer to develop. Regardless of these conten-
tions, high mammographic BD (MBD) has been shown to
be associated with BC risk and interval cancer.4 Importantly,
BD is regarded as a modifiable risk factor for BC8,9 and,
therefore, may be an important biomarker for the effect of
interventions on BC risk.
Identifying the relationship between MBD and interven-
tions that modify BD requires reliable and reproducible
methods for MBD assessment. Currently, area-based and
volumetric approaches exist for MBD assessment.6,7 The
qualitative area-based methods classify MBD into different
categories based on subjective opinion, using features such
as area covered by dense tissue and ductal prominence. They

Abstract
Background. Lower breast density (BD) is associated with lower risk of breast cancer and may serve as a biomarker for the
efficacy of chemopreventive strategies. This review explores parameters that are thought to be associated with lower BD. We
conducted a systematic review of articles published to date using the PRISMA strategy. Articles that assessed change in BD
with estrogen-receptor modulators (tamoxifene [TAM], raloxifene [RLX], and tibolone) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs), as well
as cross-sectional and longitudinal studies (LSs) that assessed association between BD and physical activity (PA) or diet were
reviewed. Results. Ten studies assessed change in BD with TAM; all reported TAM-mediated BD decreases. Change in BD with
RLX was assessed by 11 studies; 3 reported a reduction in BD. Effect of tibolone was assessed by 5 RCTs; only 1 reported change
in BD. AI-mediated BD reduction was reported by 3 out of 10 studies. The association between PA and BD was assessed by
21 studies; 4 reported an inverse association. The relationship between diet and BD was assessed in 34 studies. All studies on
calcium and vitamin D as well as vegetable intake reported an inverse association with BD in premenopausal women. Two RCTs
demonstrated BD reduction with a low-fat, high-carbohydrate intervention. Conclusion. TAM induces BD reduction; however,
the effect of RLX, tibolone, and AIs on BD is unclear. Although data on association between diet and BD in adulthood are
contradictory, intake of vegetables, vitamin D, and calcium appear to be associated with lower BD in premenopausal women.

include the Wolfe, Boyd and Tabr methods, along with the
Visual Analogue Scale and breast imaging reporting and
data system (BI-RADS).6,7 Semiautomated area-based
methods such as planimetry, Cumulus, and Madena use
thresholding and segmentation techniques to measure per-
centage mammographic density (PMD). Automated area-
based methods use thresholding and/or statistical modeling
to estimate PMD and include texture-based approaches,
Autodensity, and MedDensity.6 Volumetric approaches use
statistical or physical modeling to calculate volumetric BD
(VBD). Volumetric approaches include calibration tech-
niques, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, Cumulus V, and 3
physics model­based volumetric techniques: Standard
Mammographic Form, Volpara, and Quantra.6,7
Many studies have attempted to assess the relationship
between BD and specific clinical interventions such as
estrogen-receptor modulators,8-11 aromatase inhibitors
(AIs),12-17 physical activity (PA),18-23 and diet.24-31 However,
the nature and magnitude of the relationship between BD
and these interventions is unclear. Furthermore, the cate-
gory of women (age, ethnicity, body mass index [BMI], and
menopausal status) in which these parameters are more
effective is unclear. This lack of clarity underscores the
need for a review of interventions that are thought to have
an impact on BD, given the role of BD as an intermediate
and potentially modifiable risk factor for BC.5,8,9
Increasingly, BD notification legislations have been passed
in 22 states in the United States,32 and BD details are being
made available to screened women. The benefit of BD noti-
fication to women will only be accrued when such data are
accompanied with clear information about BD and cancer
as well as information about parameters that are associated
with lower BD and cancer risk. Therefore, this review
examines the effect of estrogen-receptor modulators such as
tamoxifene (TAM), raloxifene (RLX), and tibolone as well
as AIs such as letrozole, anastrozole, and exemestane on
BD. It also explores the association between BD and param-
eters such as PA and diet.
Materials and Methods
Search Strategy
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and
Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) strategy was used to search for
articles published to date using MEDLINE, EMBASE,
CINAHL (Ebscohost), PubMed, Cochrane library, Web of
Science, and Scopus databases. We also conducted a Google
search, and reference lists of published articles were exam-
ined to identify additional articles not found in the database
search. The search was conducted in the English language.
To systematically search for literature of interest, a combina-
tion of search terms was used; these were thematically
related to our hypothesis and also common themes identified
through preliminary search of the literature. These were
"breast density reduction interventions," "breast density
modifiers," "breast density and estrogen-receptor modula-
tors," "breast density and tamoxifene," "breast density and
raloxifene," "breast density and tibolone," "breast density
and letrozole," "breast density and anastrozole," "breast
density and exemestane," " breast density and aromatase
inhibitors," "breast density and physical activity," "exercise
and breast density," "breast density and diet."
Inclusion Criteria
Articles were included if they were randomized controlled
trials (RCTs), case-control studies (CCSs), or cohort studies
(CSs) that investigated change in BD with interventions.
Longitudinal studies (LSs) and cross-sectional studies
(CSSs) that assessed association between BD and parame-
ters such as PA and diet were also included. Articles were
also included if they were published in the English lan-
guage. Articles that did not fulfill the above criteria were
excluded, as were reviews and case reports.
Data Synthesis
Data extraction was performed independently by 2 review-
ers, with differences of opinion resolved by discussion. No
article needed to be excluded for reasons of differences of
opinion between reviewers; however, had consensus not
been reached, articles would have been excluded. For each
study, reviewers extracted information using the Participant
Intervention Comparator and Outcomes (PICOS) method
(Table 1). Studies that assessed BD from RCTs or were a
subset of RCTs were considered RCTs in the current review.
Studies were qualitatively assessed for quality and risk of
bias based on study-specific design (clarity of protocol,
assessment and report of compliance, blinding of outcome
assessors, and outcome measures); this enabled us to
appraise the conduct of each study. Table 1 shows eligibility
criteria for inclusion of studies.
Results
The search strategy identified 1853 publications, from
which 156 eligible articles were found. Of these, 48 were
duplicates, and 21 did not fulfil the inclusion criteria and
were excluded, resulting in 87 articles that fulfilled the
inclusion criteria. Of the articles that fulfilled inclusion cri-
teria, 22 were on selective estrogen-receptor modulators
(SERMs), 2 were on SERMs and AIs, 8 were on AIs alone,
21 were on PA, and 34 were on diet (Figure 1).
Of the studies on estrogen-receptor modulators, 10
assessed change in BD with TAM intervention and included
1 RCT,10 2 nested CCSs,8,9 1 CS,11 and 6 post hoc analyses
of RCTs.33-38 The sample sizes of the 10 studies ranged from
Ekpo et al 129
16 to 1065 (n = 2877). Among the studies, 7 included pre-
menopausal and postmenopausal women, with heterogene-
ity in criteria for ascertaining menopausal status. Most of
the studies administered 20 mg of TAM per day, and total
duration of TAM administration varied from 1.5 to 6 years.
Also, 7 studies used area-based qualitative and/or quantita-
tive approaches for MBD assessment, and 1 assessed fibro-
glandular volume with MRI. Only 4 studies adjusted for
confounding factors that affect BD.8-10,35 All studies reported
TAM-mediated BD decreases (Table 2).
A total of 9 studies assessed change in BD with RLX
alone,39-47 and 2 studies assessed tibolone and RLX inter-
vention.48,49 The sample size ranged from 27 to 444 (n =
2005), and 8 of the 9 studies assessed postmenopausal
women. Most of the studies administered 60 mg of RLX per
day, and the duration of the RLX administration varied
from 3 months to 3 years. Area-based methods were used
for MBD assessment in a majority of the studies, and 1
study measured fibroglandular volume with MRI. There
was a paucity of information on BD confounders in most of
the studies. Of all RLX studies reviewed, only 3 reported a
significant reduction in BD (Table 2).40,41,49
There were 5 RCTs that assessed change in BD with
tibolone intervention.48-52 Ages of participants ranged from
41 to 70 years, and the sample size ranged from 37 to 177 (n
= 665). Tibolone administration was 2.5 mg/d, and duration
of administration was 1 year. Three studies performed sub-
jective MBD assessment, 1 used Cumulus, and 1 performed
VBD assessment. Only the study that measured VBD
adjusted for confounders and reported a significant tibo-
lone-mediated BD reduction.49
Changes in BD with AIs (letrozole, 2.5 mg/d; anastro-
zole, 1 mg/d; exemestane, 25 mg/d) were assessed in 10
studies.13-17,53-56 Four of the studies used letrozole alone;
there was 1 study each on anastrozole and exemestane, and
others combined 2 of the 3 AIs. Of these, 4 were prospec-
tive arm trials and 3 were RCTs. The sample size varied
from 16 to 1065 (n = 2110), and the age of participants
ranged from 24 to 77 years, with 80% of the studies involv-
ing postmenopausal women alone. The duration of admin-
istration ranged from 6 months to 2 years. Among the
studies, 7 assessed MBD using area-based computer-
assisted methods, and the remaining studies used an area-
based subjective approach alone or in combination with
area-based computer-assisted methods. There was little or
no adjustment for BD confounding factors in most of the
studies. Only 3 out of the 10 studies reported statistically
significant reduction in BD with AIs (Table 2).15,17,54
The association between PA and BD was assessed in 21
studies.18-23,57-71 Of these, 71% were CSSs, and the sample
size ranged from 95 to 2720 (n = 20
424). Association
between PA and BD was evaluated within 5 years prior to
date of mammographic examination in 71% of the studies,
and 29% assessed this association more than 5 years prior to
mammography date. In all, 5 studies investigated the asso-
ciation of childhood and adolescent PA with BD in adult-
hood. Also, 11 studies assessed nonoccupational PA; 7
assessed household, occupational, and recreational PA; and
2 assessed life-course PA (Table 3). Qualitative assessment
of MBD was performed in 7 studies, and area-based quanti-
tative approaches were used for PMD assessment in 14
studies. A significant percentage (81%) of the studies found
no association between PA and BD22,23,57-71; 19% of the
studies reported a statistically significant inverse associa-
tion between PA and BD in perimenopausal and postmeno-
pausal women with BMI >25 kg/m2.18-21
The relationship between diet and BD was assessed in 34
studies: 59% were CSSs on the association between diet
and BD, and 27% were RCTs that assessed change in BD
with dietary interventions (Table 4). The sample size ranged
from 30 to 2252 (n = 24579). Of these, 27 studies assessed
diet in adults aged 25 to 79 years,24-26,28,29,31,72-92 and 7 stud-
ies assessed the association of childhood and/or adolescent
diet (4 to 18 years) with BD in adult life.27,64,68,93-96 Of the
studies in adults, 5 evaluated calcium and vitamin D (750
mg/d and 100 IU/d respectively), 4 assessed circulating
vitamin D--25(OH) D--and 6 assessed isoflavone. Four
studies assessed dietary fats26,80-82; 3 assessed a low-fat,
high-carbohydrate diet25,29,83; and 4 assessed carbohydrates
and proteins.80-82,90 Two studies assessed vegetables,26,73
and 2 assessed Mediterranean diets (Med-diets) and multi-
vitamin-multimineral supplements (M-M supplements).24,92
Of the 7 studies that assessed childhood and adolescent diet,
3 were on dietary patterns,64,84,95 and other studies were on
calorie restriction,96 alcohol,93 dietary vitamin D and cal-
cium,94 and a low-fat diet.27 A majority of the studies
assessed BD with area-based methods such as Cumulus and
qualitative approaches. No association was found between
childhood or adolescent diet and BD in adulthood.27,64,68,93-95

In adults, all 5 studies on calcium and vitamin D reported an
inverse association with BD in premenopausal women but
not in postmenopausal women.72,73,76,77,84 All RCTs of iso-
flavone demonstrated no change in BD,31,86-89 and all CSSs
reported no inverse association between dietary fat and
BD.26,80-82 The 2 RCTs on low-fat, high-carbohydrate inter-
vention found statistically significant BD decreases,25,83 and
no further change was noted in a 4-year post hoc analysis of
1 RCT.29 Studies on protein and carbohydrate intake and
BD generated conflicting results, with 2 reporting higher
BD,82,90 1 demonstrating an inverse association,80 and 1
reporting no association with BD.81 The 2 studies on vege-
table intake in adulthood reported an inverse association
with BD.26,73 Intake of Med-diets and M-M supplements
also demonstrated conflicting results, with one reporting
lower BD for Med-diet and M-M supplements in

Discussion
One encouraging attribute of BD is that it can be altered.8
Because most determinants of BD and BC are interrelated and
interdependent,5 it is logical that parameters that lower BD
may lower BC risk. Many parameters are thought to alter BD;
however, this review focuses on SERMs, AIs, PA, and diet.
Estrogen plays a critical role in BD and increased BC
risk5; therefore, it is intuitive that interventions that decrease
estrogen bioavailability may lower BD. A few substances
with strong binding affinity for estrogen receptors such as
SERMs have been identified to antagonize the action of
estrogen on breast tissue through inhibition of 17-estradiol
activity.97 SERMs also decrease insulin-like growth factor
(IGF)-1 levels and increase IGF binding protein (IGFBP)
and sex hormone binding-globulin.8,9,15 Other substances
(AIs) inhibit the production of estrogen by aromatase.15,56
Evidence shows that TAM mediates BD reduction in both
premenopausal and postmenopausal women, but no con-
crete evidence exists for BD reduction with RLX, tibolone,
letrozole, anastrozole, or exemestane (Table 2). The BD
reduction in TAM studies might be explained by the preva-
lence of premenopausal women as shown by the stronger
BD decreases in premenopausal women. Most of the AIs,
tibolone, and RLX studies were performed in postmeno-
pausal women. Because menopause is associated with tis-
sue involution,98 postmenopausal breast tissue may not be
responsive to AIs and RLX therapies.
A few limitations are noted in studies on antiestrogen
agents. About 80% of the studies on TAM and tibolone did
not adjust for BD confounders. Two of the studies on estro-
gen modulators had very small sample sizes,11,17 and 1
study99 reported duration of treatment but not dosage
administered. There was variability in age, populations, and
sample size between studies, thus making comparison of
studies difficult. A majority of the studies did not assess the
consistency of MBD assessments, and 90% of the studies
used area-based approaches for MBD assessment, which
may not detect change in BD when the quantity of dense
tissue changes but the dense area remains unchanged.
Significant changes in BD with 3 different estrogen-
receptor modulators were demonstrated where VBD assess-
ment was performed11,40,49 and emphasize the need for fur-
ther studies using volumetric methods to assess the effect of
RLX, tibolone, and AIs on BD in premenopausal women.
Thus, variability in MBD assessment continues to be a con-
founding factor in studies assessing the impact of interven-
tions on BD, as demonstrated by the heterogeneity in results
obtained in the same patients when different MBD mea-
surement approaches were used.35,40,54
PA alters BMI by reducing adiposity and increasing
muscle mass, and the association between BMI, BD, and
cancer is well established.100 However, the evidence for the
association between PA and BD is conflicting. Of the 21
studies, 81%, including a RCT of aerobic exercise on BD,23
found no association between PA and BD. It is well estab-
lished that BMI and postmenopausal status are negative
confounders for BD.100 BMI was found to attenuate the
association between PA and BD, but only 9 studies adjusted
for menopausal status; 95% of the studies did not report
whether participants were premenopausal or postmeno-
pausal at the time of PA, and 1 study70 did not specify the
timing of PA. There was heterogeneity in the type, duration,
and intensity of PA, making comparison of results difficult.
The only RCT that assessed change in BD with aerobic
exercise was in postmenopausal women. Involution of the
breast and depletion of sex hormones and growth factors is
common in postmenopausal women.5,98 Because exercise
acts through these hormonal agents, it is unsurprising that
no change was noted in BD with aerobic exercise in post-
menopausal women. About 90% of the studies assessed
Caucasian women, limiting the generalization of results to
other ethnic populations.As yet, there is no evidence to sug-
gest that PA is associated with lower BD. Nonetheless,
because PA is inversely related to serum IGF-1, estrogen,
and progesterone bioavailability and reduction in their
serum concentration reduces cell proliferation and exposure
to carcinogens, PA is a controllable, important BC risk miti-
gation agent.
Although evidence for the association between diet and
BD is also contradictory,27,64,68,93-96 intake of vitamin D and
calcium; a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet; and vegetables
appears to be associated with lower BD, mostly in pre-
menopausal women (Table 4). Calcium and vitamin D play
an important role in the modulation of epithelial cell growth,
proliferation, and differentiation.101 The inverse association
between these food sources and BD in premenopausal
women is stronger at higher threshold consumption and
among women with high concentrations of IGF-I or IGFBP-
3.77 Lower BD from calcium and vitamin D intake has been
attributed to antioxidant activity101 and inhibition of IGFs.77
Premenopausal, compared with postmenopausal, women
have more proliferating cells and mitogens implicated in
BD increases,5,8,77 which is perhaps the reason for the
inverse association between calcium and vitamin D with
BD in premenopausal women only. Isoflavone consump-
tion has been shown to be associated with lower cancer
incidence102 but not BD.31,86-89 A recent LS shows that soy-
product consumers who metabolize daidzein manufactured
by intestinal bacteria to equol (a nonsteroidal estrogen)
demonstrate slightly lower BD than non­equol producers.91
This suggests that the metabolism of a specific diet may
influence its association with BD and needs to be explored.
Isoflavones reduce the effects of mitogens and mutagens
140 Integrative Cancer Therapies 15(2)
through increases in antioxidant activity and sex hormone­
binding globulin serum bioactivity,102 and these 2 properties
reduce cell proliferation associated with BD increases.
Isoflavone studies are limited by the area-based assessment
of MBD and inadequate adjustment for BD confounders.
The literature on the association between carbohydrates
and proteins with BD also presents conflicting outcomes:
direct association,82 inverse association,80 and no associa-
tion.81 However, RCTs on low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet
have shown an inverse association with BD in premeno-
pausal and postmenopausal women.25,29 There is evidence
that the fiber make-up of carbohydrates influences the IGF/
IGFBP sequence and oxidative stress.103 Therefore, varying
fiber content in the different sources of carbohydrates may
differentially influence growth factors responsible for BD
variations, and this may be the reason for the inconsistent
relationship between carbohydrate intake and BD.
Vegetables and carotene inhibit cell proliferation and
IGF-1,104 and these may be the reasons for their association
with lower BD in premenopausal and postmenopausal
women.26,73 Although regular use of M-M supplements has
generated different outcomes, these supplements contain
antioxidants that reduce the activity of mitogens responsi-
ble for BD increases24 and, therefore, need to be further
investigated.
Generally, the reliance of CSSs on questionnaires whose
reliability can be diminished by memory deficiency makes
it difficult to measure the extent of exposure to dietary fac-
tors.105 The association between a specific diet and BD may
also be attenuated if such food is consumed in combination
with other counteracting food substances and if intake
occurred before mammogenesis. Therefore, RCTs using
VBD measurement approaches may provide more accurate
evidence for the impact of interventions on BD. The litera-
ture demonstrates that antidiabetes agents such as metfor-
min inhibit IGF-1 and insulin/IGF chain and alter metabolic
processes.106 These processes are associated with reduction
in cell proliferation,106 which may lower BD. Thus, it may
be important to assess the effect of antidiabetes agents and
changes in glucose homeostasis on BD. Finally and encour-
agingly, change in BD over time is consistent with change
in BC risk,107,108 and reduced BD is associated with a
reduced risk of BC108,109 and death from the disease.110
Therefore, BD may have potential utility as a biomarker for
the efficacy of chemopreventive interventions.
Conclusion
There is substantial evidence that BD is potentially reduc-
ible. Tamoxifen reduces BD; however, the effect of RLX,
tibolone, and AIs on BD is still unclear. There is no evi-
dence for association of PA and childhood or adolescent
diet with BD. Although data on the association between
dietary factors and BD are conflicting, intake of vegetables,
vitamin D, and calcium in adulthood is associated with
lower BD in premenopausal women. It is hoped that lower-
ing BD with interventions may lower BC risk and improve
early detection of BC with mammography. However, these
benefits can only be amassed if women are adequately
informed about BD and BC risk mitigation strategies.
Implementation of these strategies may hold the key to
reducing the risk of BC.
