Abstract
Using the Puerto Rican Maternal and Infant Health Study dataset (PRMIHS),
the predictors of relationship status were examined via probit regression. The
strongest predictors of relationship status found were interactions between
binary variables for the age. A respondent first had sexual intercourse and for
the age when a respondent first entered into a union (N = 1452). This paper
concludes by arguing that the results provide support for viewing union status
as being primarily dependent on the people involved in the union, as opposed
to being primarily dependent on factors external to the people themselves.
Keywords
Divorce, Separation, Union Status, Union Stability, Relationship Status
1. Introduction
The predictors of relationship status are often viewed from an "external to the
person" perspective instead of from the viewpoint that these predictors are often
reflective of intrinsic qualities of the people in the relationship. While a rela-
tionship's status is surely not entirely determined by qualities intrinsic to the
people in that relationship, the results of this paper indicate that relationship
status is best determined by examining the actual people in a relationship.
2. Literature Review
One prominent approach to analyzing divorces/separations nowadays is the ra-
tional choice model. In the context of relationships, this model posits that people

will stay in relationships when it is in their own best interest to do so and end
them when the overall cost of remaining in them exceeds the benefits of doing
so, hence maximizing their utility. Using this logic, the positive relationship
sometimes found between the household division of labor (i.e. specialization)
and union stability is perceived as reflecting the greater costs incurred by exiting
a relationship in which the partners have grown increasingly dependent on each
other due to increasing specialization [1] [2] [3] [4]. In regards to a wife's in-
come, this outlook has explained the sometimes negative association between
said measure and union stability as reflecting the lessened costs for a wife to exit
a relationship when her income has risen [5]-[11]. As for the frequently found
negative relationship between age at marriage and union stability, this perspec-
tive has argued that it reflects the longer payoff period a person has to find
another partner when he/she ends a relationship while young as opposed to
while older [10] [12]. The negative relationship between female labor force par-
ticipation and union stability, meanwhile, has been explained as resulting from
the greater number of attractive partners made available to men via said factor
[13].
In addition to the findings mentioned in the preceding paragraph, there are
others to which the rational choice viewpoint has been applied. The negative re-
lationship between union dissolution and investments in a relationship via
things such as time spent in union, children, and home ownership has been ex-
plained as resulting from the greater costs incurred by exiting a union with more
of these investments [9] [11] [12] [14] [15] [16] [17]. Additionally, the some-
times found positive relationship between a couple having a boy and union sta-
bility has been viewed as reflecting the greater costs for fathers to leave unions in
which they have put more time and energy into due to their greater involvement
with a male child vis-à-vis a female child [18] [19] [20]. At the same time, the
sometimes positive relationship which has been found between a wife's income
and union stability has been deemed as resulting from the reduced benefit of ex-
iting a relationship in which a wife's income, if pooled, has benefited the entire
family and relieved the economic pressure on the husband [8] [21].
Another major, related approach in the literature on relationships is to ex-
amine certain variables, particularly demographic ones, and to explain their im-
portance in terms of what they provide instead of looking at them in terms of
what they reveal about the person. One such variable is education, which some
have argued reflects communication skills needed to maintain relationships [9]
[22] [23], while one study by an author named Ono argued that in specific re-
gards to a wife's education, it only affects relationships through earnings [9]. In
that study, however, even when a wife's earnings were controlled for, the re-
sponse of "no information" given for a wife's education had a statistically signif-
icant positive effect on marital dissolution [9]. This finding may be caused by the
possibility that women in that dataset who had little or no education preferred to
give no information on that variable, consistent with the social desirability phe-
A. Mastroniani
DOI: 10.4236/ojapps.2017.78031 414 Open Journal of Applied Sciences
nomenon sometimes found in surveys [24] [25]. If so, Ono's claim that a wife's
education only impacts relationship status via earnings may be contradicted [9].
The resources available to a husband, meanwhile, as measured by things such as
percentage of time working in a given period and his level of education, have
been looked at as proxies for income/resources which can be made available to
stabilize relationships [6] [9] [13] [16] [26]. In addition, age at marriage has been
described as reflecting less knowledge of proper role performance in marriage
[16] and as a proxy for time spent gathering info as to whether someone is a
suitable partner [10]. In regards to domestic violence and other stressful events,
the negative relationship between these things and union stability has been ex-
plained as being a result of the reduced benefits to staying a relationship which
has had its quality lowered due to strain [27] [28] [29].
The preceding two paragraphs, it should be noted, are not meant to be taken
as exhaustive. Whether one identifies as Catholic, for instance, has been ex-
amined on the grounds that identifying oneself as such would reduce the like-
lihood of union dissolution due to said religion's views on divorce [10] [30]. A
couple's degree of similarity in regards to things such as education and ethnicity,
meanwhile, has been looked at with the belief that greater dissimilarity leads to
greater conflict and hence less union stability [31] [32]. The effect of tax rates
has also been examined [33], as has the often found negative relationship be-
tween cohabitation and union stability of cohabitation [30] [34] [35] [36] [37]
[38], the effect of welfare reform [39] [40], and there are numerous other factors,
as well. A complete overview will not be undertaken, however, for entire papers
have been devoted to such attempts [41] [42].
3. A Different Perspective
Referring back to the title, the caveat which will be mentioned is that this author
believes that some of the aforementioned variables should be examined in the
light of what they reveal about the actual persons involved in the relationship.
This action should by no means be taken as an assumption that events which
happen during a relationship do not matter for its stability, however, for what
actually happens during one surely plays some role in its eventual outcome.
What it does indicate is that it is this author's viewpoint that things such as do-
mestic violence, whether a partner has gone to jail, level of educational attain-
ment, etc., should be viewed primarily as indicators of the actual people involved
in the relationship. Looking at unions as ventures/agreements that are usually
between two parties which require skills such as the ability to communicate,
compromise, and think calmly in regards to the long-term future (and hence
delay gratification) to achieve long-lasting stability, it is hereby hypothesized
that people who are able to succeed in other endeavors that require at least some
of these same skills, such as attaining a good paying occupation and saving
enough over the long haul to buy expensive items such as a home, will be more
likely to achieve long-lasting union stability than those people who cannot. Un-

fortunately, this hypothesis cannot be used to show cause, for it is a subjective
interpretation of available facts. It should be pointed out, however, that for what-
ever reason, results obtained from data in this field, which if not completely
non-experimental is overwhelmingly so, are oftentimes referenced in a way that
implies that they reveal causation. All attempts will be made in this paper to avoid
that error, for this analysis is based on non-experimental data (i.e. survey data).
Before moving on, a few more points need to be made. Firstly, the "types of
people" argument has been made previously, as when authors such as Morgan
and Rindfuss [43] and South and Spitze [16] argued that the positive relation-
ship between age at marriage and union stability exists because age at marriage
can be seen as a proxy for maturity. But as any even cursory survey of recent
journal articles regarding this subject would reveal, that this focus is not the
predominant one in this field today. Secondly, the conclusion that the assign-
ment of responsibility for relationship status should primarily be placed with in-
dividuals is supported by many biological studies which have directly examined
divorce via behavioral genetics studies [44] [45] [46] and testosterone studies
[47]. Thirdly, testosterone has been linked indirectly to marriage in numerous
studies that have demonstrated a link between it and things known to affect ma-
rital stability (e.g. antisocial behavior, occupational attainment) [48] [49].
Fourthly, as noted by Johnson et al. [45], the genetic influence on personality has
been well established [50], which is noteworthy considering that as some such as
Teachman have noted [51], several personality traits have been linked to divorce
[44] [46] [52] [53] [54] [55]. Lastly, the debate regarding the importance of indi-
vidual factors vis-à-vis external/situational factors is an old one, as when Rein-
hold Niebuhr criticized many liberal thinkers for placing the blame for the ills of
the world primarily on situations and institutions rather than on human beings
themselves [56]. Given the recent dominance of rational choice models in this
field, however, it was decided to make this point of difference clear.
4. Data
The dataset which will be used in this paper is the Puerto Rican Maternal and
Infant Health Study (PRMIHS), which consists of 2763 personal interviews with
mothers of infants drawn from two independent samples. Because this paper is
attempting to determine what predicts the failure or sustaining of relationships,
including marriages, only those mothers who gave information on union status
and who did not respond that they never married or that they were widowed to
the question regarding current marital status will be examined. The sample size
will further be reduced by excluding people who gave no information on va-
riables considered to be important for this analysis, thereby reducing the final
sample to 1452 respondents.
4.1. Dependent Variable
All dummy variables were coded as either 0 or 1, as per convention, and all biva-
A. Mastroniani
DOI: 10.4236/ojapps.2017.78031 416 Open Journal of Applied Sciences
riate regressions mentioned hereafter regarding dummy variables utilized probit
regression.
Current marital status: A dummy variable was created to deal with respon-
dents who answered that they were divorced or separated from their partner at
the time of their interview. It should be noted that due to question wording, it is
possible that some mothers had been in relationships which had ended and then
gotten into ones which were still existent. If anything, this possibility would
make it seem as if relationships had been more stable than they actually were.
Lastly, there was a question in the PRMIHS survey asking about first union sta-
tus, but not much data pertaining to that time in the respondent's life was avail-
able. Current marital status was therefore examined instead.
4.2. Independent Variables
4.2.1. Variables Pertaining to Living Situation and Partner Quality
Living status and partner quality: Dummy variables pertaining to whether the
respondent had been living with the father of the focal child at time of concep-
tion and to whether the respondent's partner had hit her or been to jail were in-
teracted in these analyses. The latter dummy variable was initially entered by it-
self into models to test the hypothesis that relationship stability is contingent
upon the quality of one's partner. It was not entered by itself into final regres-
sions, however, because a bivariate regression between that dummy variable and
the aforementioned one pertaining to living situation revealed that a 1 value for
the latter lowered the chances of a 1 value for the former by 12.2% (p < 0.02).
It should be noted that including the living situation dummy variable followed
the lead of Oropesa and Landale [29] on the grounds that relationships where
the partners lived together at time of conception would be more stable than ones
where they did not. Additionally, whether a respondent's partner had hit her or
been to jail was interacted because a bivariate regression revealed that an answer
of "yes" to whether the respondent's partner had been in jail raised the likelih-
ood of the respondent having been hit by her partner by nearly 38.5% (p <
0.0001). The decision to require that the respondent's partner had both hit her
and been to jail was foregone, however, because this concurrence occurred in
only 13 cases in the final sample. Lastly, the interaction with a positive value for
instances when the respondent lived with the father at the time of conception
and where her partner had not been to jail or hit her served as the base category
by author's discretion.
4.2.2. Partner Similarity Variables
Education: Dummy variables regarding whether the respondent had completed
the 11th grade at most and the father had completed 16 or more grades were in-
teracted.
Ethnicity: Whether the father of the focal child was Puerto Rican and whether
the mother identified herself as Puerto Rican under ethnic identification were
examined. At first, a dummy variable dealing only with the father's ethnicity was
A. Mastroniani
DOI: 10.4236/ojapps.2017.78031 417 Open Journal of Applied Sciences
created, but later analyses showed that results with this dummy were essentially
identical. The choice to use the dummy with both partners' ethnicity was thus
made solely by author's discretion.
4.2.3. Age First Union - Age First Sexual Intercourse Interaction Variables
Age first union and age first sexual experience: Dummy variables for whether
the respondent's first union occurred before the age of 27 and whether her first
sexual experiences occurred at the age of 17 or later were created due to the logic
of previous hypotheses regarding long-term thinking, patience, etc. These two
variables were not entered separately into final equations, however, but were in-
stead interacted because a bivariate regression between them revealed that a 1
value for the latter dummy variable lowered the chances of a 1 value for the for-
mer one by nearly 33.4% (p < 0.0001). It should be noted that the decision was
made to eschew continuous measures of age at first union and age at first sexual
intercourse for the following reasons: 1) to diminish the impact of extreme res-
ponses given (e.g. in the final analyses, there were 22 values of 13 or less for age
at first union when it was asked for in years and eight values of 11 or less for age
first time when measured in years); 2) measuring age at these events as a conti-
nuous variable seems to imply that there are important cognitive differences
between people when there is none (e.g. how much more mature is a 25.3 year old
respondent from a 25 year old one, or a 14 year old from a 15 year old?); 3) using a
continuous variable implies that there is a constant effect for every year added
agewise, but results indicated that this condition was not present (i.e. not delaying
one's first union until 22 or 23 raised the chances of a positive value of the depen-
dent variable more than entering one's first union before the age of 20).
Before moving on, it must be pointed out that it is of course possible that
these variables will be affected by things other than the aforementioned traits
such as social reclusiveness. This trait, which would probably increase the res-
pondent's age at loss of virginity and presumably at first union, but the PRMIHS
survey does not provide data suitable for this type of alternative analysis (i.e. it
does not ask respondents about their social tendencies or habits). It is also possi-
ble that delaying one's first sexual experience until the age of age or later reflects
adherence to traditional values, but again, this possibility cannot be further ex-
plored due to data constraints. Furthermore, alternate forms for the variables
forming the basis of this interaction which used different age cutoff points were
created. Results for regressions with these variables serving as the basis for al-
ternate interactions were not substantially different. The connection between age
at first union and age at first sexual encounter, meanwhile, remained strong
when measured in continuous form (R-Squared=0.569; p<.0001). Lastly, 27 and
17 served as the cutoff points for age at first union and age at first sexual expe-
rience, respectively, by author's discretion.
4.2.4. Stressful Events Variables
Difficulty with bills and health of a loved one: Pertains to respondents who were
A. Mastroniani
DOI: 10.4236/ojapps.2017.78031 418 Open Journal of Applied Sciences
unable to pay their bills and who had a loved one fall into poor health. In the
survey which provided the basis for the Puerto Rican Maternal Infant and
Health dataset, respondents were asked if someone close had died, if a close fam-
ily member had been hospitalized, and if they had been unable to pay their bills.
The answers to these three questions will not be used as part of an index, as in
prior research [29], but they will be used in this paper to form interaction va-
riables. A dummy for instances where someone close was not well was created by
multiplying one dummy with a positive value for instances where a relative was
in the hospital and another dummy for a positive value in cases where someone
close died after a bivariate regression showed that a yes response to one of these
questions raised the probability of a yes response to the other one by approx-
imately 32.1% (p < 0.0001). An interaction variable representing respondents
who could not pay their bills and who had someone close be not well was then
created by multiplying a dummy for respondents who could not pay their bills
by a dummy for instances where someone close to the respondent was not well
after a bivariate regression showed that a 1 value for the bills dummy raised the
chances of a 1 value for the loved one's health dummy by close to 9.9% (p <
0.01).
The interaction where the respondent could pay her bills and no loved one
was ill served as base category by author's discretion. Additionally, a different
dummy variable regarding financial difficulties was created and it served as a
part of interactions with the health of a loved one dummy also. Results for mod-
els with these variables were essentially identical. Furthermore, previous research
had included whether someone close to the respondent had had problems with
substance abuse [29]. A bivariate regression, however, revealed that a yes re-
sponse to whether someone close had abused substances raised the likelihood of
a 1 value for the aforementioned dummy pertaining to a partner's having hit the
respondent or having gone to jail by approximately 33.4% (p < 0.0001). This
question was thus not be used as a stressful event variable. In the same light,
respondents had been asked if they had been in a fight as an indicator of stress,
but a bivariate regression between this answer and the dummy pertaining to a
partner having hit the respondent or having gone to jail showed that a yes re-
sponse to one of these questions raised the probability of a yes response to the
other by 44.8% (p < 0.0001). Whether the respondent had been in a fight was
thus not used as part of a stressful event variable, either.
4.2.5. Variables Dealing with Education and Money
Education and income: Dummies were created regarding whether the respon-
dent had attained at least a Bachelor's degree and whether her combined house-
hold income at time of pregnancy was at minimum 25,000 dollars. The decision
was made to interact these variables because a bivariate regression between them
revealed that 1 value for the education dummy raised the chances of a 1 value for
the income dummy by nearly 35.5% (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, by interacting
these dummy variables, it may be possible to determine whether it is increasing
A. Mastroniani
DOI: 10.4236/ojapps.2017.78031 419 Open Journal of Applied Sciences
levels of money or of education which has the stronger effect on union stability.
As for measurement decisions, it was decided to measure education and income
dichotomously for reasons similar to the ones already given for measuring age at
first union and at first sexual intercourse dichotomously. They are: 1) measuring
education at the interval or ratio level suggests that there may be differences be-
tween people when there actually is none, at least not substantively (i.e. there
may be no meaningful difference between someone who drops out of school af-
ter 10th and someone who drops out of school after 11th grade); 2) there may be
an important difference between people who complete a certain phase of
schooling (e.g. college) and those people who merely begin it (i.e. different levels
of diligence, rational long-term decisionmaking ability, etc.--also sometimes re-
ferred to as the Glick effect). 3) in regards to income, there is a possibility that
the effect of each additional dollar which a person possesses is not constant and
that instead there are instead meaningful thresholds which should be sought out
(e.g. minimum monetary amount needed to pay rent).
No separate dummy variable was constructed for people who go on to com-
plete Master's or PhD level studies due to the small number of respondents who
did so. Additionally, alternate dummy variables for income using different cutoff
points such as $15,000 and $ 30,000 were created, but multivariate regressions
with them did not differ substantially from the one presented here. Additionally,
there was no sure way to determine if respondents had dropped out of high
school or college once beginning it, thereby making it impossible to examine a
possible dropout effect. Lastly, the interaction representing respondents who had
not attained at least a Bachelor's degree and whose combined household income
was under $25,000 served as the base category by author's discretion.
4.2.6. Variables Pertaining to Religion
Religious denomination and frequency of service attendance: Separate dummy
variables representing Catholics, Protestants, and non Catholics or Protestants
were created to check for an effect of religion on union dissolution and to avoid
homogenizing people belonging to different religious sects. At the same time, a
dummy variable pertaining to whether a respondent attended religious services
once a week or more was created and then interacted with the religious deno-
mination dummies. This decision was made for the simple reason that religious
people who attend services frequently (here defined as at least once weekly by
author's discretion) may be different from people of the same faith who do not
show such devotion to it. Respondents who did not identify themselves as Prot-
estant and who did not attend religious services at least once weekly served as
the base category by author's discretion.
4.2.7. Additional Variables
Prior fertility: The number of births the respondent had before the birth of the
study's focal child was entered into final analyses.
No prior children: A dummy variable dealing with the specific instances
A. Mastroniani
DOI: 10.4236/ojapps.2017.78031 420 Open Journal of Applied Sciences
where the focal child was the union's first was included.
Sex of child: A dummy variable dealing with whether the focal child was fe-
male was included.
It should be noted that a dummy variable regarding instances where the focal
child was the couple's first child and a girl did not substantially alter the final
model and was thus dropped.
4.2.8. Variables Purposely Not Included
Father's age at pregnancy: Although a variable for the father's age at pregnancy
could have been very valuable considering the numerous studies showing that
there is a relationship between age and union stability, none was included in this
analysis. This exclusion was decided upon because there were only 520 values for
the father's age at pregnancy in the entire dataset.
Age endogamy: For the reason given in the preceding paragraph, no variables
concerning age endogamy were used in this analysis.
Type of job. In keeping with the logic previously set forth, a dummy variable
was created to ascertain the possible relationship between having a manageri-
al/specialty occupation job as defined by 1990 Census Industry codes and rela-
tionship status. It was dropped from final analyses because including it with all
the other variables included in the final model reduced the sample size to only
637 respondents
Wantedness of focal child. Again partly following the lead of Oropesa and
Landale [29], a dummy variable regarding the wantedness of the focal child was
created. If a respondent answered "wanted to become preg sooner or wanted to
become preg then," said dummy variable was coded as 1. This variable was
dropped in final analyses, however, because bivariate regressions with an afore-
mentioned dummy variable pertaining to living situation showed that a 1 value
for the child wantedness dummy raised the probability of a 1 value for the living
situation dummy by 26.4% for the entire dataset (p < 0.0001). Lastly, including it
alongside all the other variables ultimately included reduced the sample size to
only 960 respondents.

In the bivariate regressions, 11 out of the 22 variables were significant at the
0.05 level, with 12 being significant at the less restrictive 0.1 level, 7 being signif-
icant at the more restrictive 0.01 level, and 6 being significant at the very restric-
tive 0.001 level. In regards to strength of relationship with the dependent varia-
ble, the dummy pertaining to cases where the respondent had completed less
than 12 years of education while her partner had completed at least 16 clearly
had the strongest relationship. The dummy variable for when the respondent
had at least finished college and the combined household income was less than
25 thousand dollars and the dummy for couples who did not live together at
time of conception and in which the respondent's partner had not been to jail or
hit her, meanwhile, had the second and third strongest relationships with union

stability with nearly equal coefficients of -0.725 and 0.696, respectively. When
analyses became multivariate rather than bivariate, many noteworthy changes
occurred. Starting with the age first union-age first sexual experience interac-
tions, the dummy for cases where the respondent entered into the union in
question before age 27 and had not experienced sexual intercourse until after her
17th birthday became significant at the.05 level, whereas it had not been signifi-
cant previously at even the 0.1 level. At the same time, the coefficients for each
of the union-age at first time interaction variables became much larger (i.e. coef-
ficients went from 0.313, -0.142, and 0.043 to 1.156, 0.995, and 0.925 for the
dummies pertaining to entering a union before 27 and having sex before 17, en-
tering a union before 27 and delaying sex until at least the age of 17, and for de-
laying entering a union until after 27 and having sex before reaching the age of
17, respectively).
In regards to the other variables in the model, the variable for instances where
the respondent had completed at least college and the combined household in-
come at time of pregnancy was over $25,000 became insignificant at the 0.1 level.
Meanwhile, the dummy for cases where the respondent had attained at least a
Bachelor's degree and her combined household income during pregnancy was
less than $25,000 remained significant only at the 0.1 level. As for the dummy
pertaining to cases where the couple did not live together at time of conception
and the father of the focal child had hit the respondent or been to jail, it became
significant at only the 0.1 level. The effect of the focal child being the couple's
first child, meanwhile, became significant at the 0.1 level and its effect on the
dependent variable nearly doubled (i.e. a 1 value for it lowered the chances for
the dependent variable equaling 1 by nearly 10. 3% in multivariate calculations
instead of by 5.2% as in a bivariate calculation). The other fertility-related varia-
ble, meanwhile, became significant at the 0.1 level and had its coefficient rise
from 0.018 to 0.086, which represents a meaningful difference for larger values
of it. As for the effect of the respondent being unable to pay her bills and having
someone close to her be not well, its positive effect on union dissolution was re-
duced from 22.2% to 14.4%.
Turning to cases where the respondent attended religious services less than
once a week and identified herself as Catholic, this interaction became signifi-
cant at the 0.05 level and its coefficient rose to -0.301 from -0.143, thereby in-
creasing its effect on the dependent variable by 2.3%. The effect of attending re-
ligious services infrequently and of not being Catholic or Protestant, meanwhile,
went from being insignificant at even the 0.1 level to being significant at the 0.05
level and it went from having virtually a nil effect on union dissolution to affect-
ing it by 16.3%. Lastly, the effect of the respondent having completed less than
12 years of schooling while her partner had completed 16 or more went from
being the largest to being the 4th largest behind each of the three age first union -
age first time interactions (although it should be pointed that the interaction re-
garding respondents who entered into a union before 27 and had first sexual in-
tercourse after 17 was not significant at even the 0.1 level).

There were other changes in results when going from bivariate to multivariate
analyses, but they were of much less substantive importance. They were as fol-
lows: 1) the dummy for respondents who entered a union before the age of 27
and who engaged in sexual intercourse before the age of 17 became insignificant
at the 0.001 level; 2) the dummy for respondents who had not attained at least a
Bachelor's degree and whose combined household income during pregnancy
was at least $25,000 had its p-level rise to 0.001.
6. Discussion
The people who did not delay both their entry into their first union and into
sexual intercourse were the ones most likely to be divorced or separated. Interes-
tingly, the group second most likely to be divorced or separated was the one
whose members delayed sexual intercourse but did not delay their first union
until later on in their 20s, thus repeating the implication from prior research that
age at first union is the most substantial predictor of relationship status.
As for the variables regarding living arrangement and partner quality, it must
be pointed out that each of the three variables in the final multivariate regression
had substantial effects on the dependent variable and were all significant at the
0.1 level. The interaction representing cases where the couple lived together at
time of conception and where the male had hit the respondent or been to jail
and the interaction representing cases where the couple did not live together at
time of conception and the male had not hit the respondent or been to jail being
significant at the 0.05 level. Perhaps the most interesting fact about these va-
riables is that it was the interaction representing cases where the couple did not
live together and the father had not been to jail or hit his partner which had the
largest coefficient, not the interaction for cases where the couple did live togeth-
er and the father had been to jail or hit his partner. While their coefficients were
roughly equal, it is interesting that in regards to this dataset, not living with the
father was slightly more deleterious to the chances of a union proving stable
than living with someone who hit his partner or had been to jail.
Moving to other multivariate results, it is very interesting that the interaction
representing respondents who had a partner with 16 or more years of schooling
but less than 12 themselves had such a substantial impact on the dependent va-
riable. With its positive coefficient of 0.844, it implies that, at least in the context
of the PRMIHS dataset, there was a much greater chance for a union to end
when the man had attained a substantially higher level of education than the fe-
male (i.e. all else held equal, this condition raised the chances for a 1 value for
the dependent variable by nearly 30%). This finding must be treated cautiously,
however, for the dummy in question had a positive value only 13 times in the fi-
nal sample. Nevertheless, it is a finding worth taking note of, especially consi-
dering that it is consistent with prior relationships found between union status
and educational endogamy. The exact reason for this finding, however, cannot
be ascertained from the examined survey. It is possible that the male after a cer-
A. Mastroniani
DOI: 10.4236/ojapps.2017.78031 426 Open Journal of Applied Sciences
tain point attempts to "trade up" by attaining a more educated wife. At the same
time, however, it could be the case that education level/BA attainment is a proxy
for communication as previous authors have argued [9] [22] [23]. This finding
implies that the woman's communication skills are more important for union
survival than the man, a proposition supported by the finding that a positive
value for an interaction representing cases where the respondent had at least a
Bachelor's degree and her partner had completed less than 12 years of schooling
predicts a negative value for the dependent variable perfectly. Similar to the in-
teraction for cases where the respondent had not finished at least 12 years of
schooling and the father had completed 16 or more, however, this result must be
viewed cautiously because there are only 15 instances of this situation.
There is yet another interesting finding in regards to coefficient size when one
examines the education-income interaction variables. While it did not reach sig-
nificance at the.05 level, the interaction for cases where the respondent had at
least a Bachelor degree and her combined household income during pregnancy
was under $25,000 had the largest coefficient for these three variables and it will
not be discarded here considering that its p-value was barely above.05 (p =
0.052). This finding indicates that education is slightly more important for union
stability than income. Nevertheless, the interaction for cases where the mother
had not attained at least a Bachelor's degree and her combined household in-
come during pregnancy was at least $25,000 was statistically significant at the.05
level and it did not have an effect to scoff at on the dependent variable (i.e. a 1
value for this independent variable reduced the chances of a 1 value for the de-
pendent variable by nearly 18.1%). This fact implies that it is sufficient that a
couple have either money or at least one educated partner (in this case, the
woman) to lower its likelihood of ending in divorce or separation. In one final
point on these variables, it is surprising that the interaction representing cases
where the respondent had attained at least a Bachelor's degree and whose com-
bined household income during pregnancy was at least $25,000 had the smallest
coefficient and would only be considered significant at a rather relaxed alpha
level of 0.15. One would have expected this variable to have the largest coeffi-
cient for this group of variables; this expectation was clearly not met, however.
For the stressful event interaction variables, there are two things worth dis-
cussing. One, the signs for the two significant interactions were in opposite di-
rections (i.e. the coefficient for the dummy pertaining to respondents who could
not pay their bills and did not have a loved one be not well was positive, whereas
the dummy representing respondents who could pay their bills and had some-
one close to them be not well was negative), thus calling into doubt the wisdom
of putting these two variables into the same index variable as had been done in
prior research [29]. Two, the coefficient for the interaction representing respon-
dents who could pay their bills and who had a loved one be not well was slightly
larger than its inverse (i.e. the interaction representing respondents who could
pay their bills and did not have someone close to them be not well (0.465 and
0.37, respectively)), thereby implying that having a loved one be ill has a some-
A. Mastroniani
DOI: 10.4236/ojapps.2017.78031 427 Open Journal of Applied Sciences
what stronger "pulling together" effect on couples than any "pulling apart" effect
of not being able to pay bills (i.e. a 1 value for the former interaction affects the
dependent variable by 18.1%, instead of by 14.4% as a 1 value for the latter one
does).
Moving on to the variables dealing with religion, only two attained signific-
ance at even the relaxed 0.1 level (i.e. the interaction for Catholics who attended
services less than once a week and the interaction for respondents who were
neither Catholic nor Protestant and who attended services less than once a
week). The latter dummy also had the largest coefficient of the group (-0.434),
meaning that a 1 value for this interaction reduced the chance of the dependent
variable equaling one by nearly 16.6%. The coefficient for the dummy
representing Catholics who attended services less than once a week, meanwhile,
lowered said chances by 11.8%. It is very interesting that nonfrequently church
attending Catholics are less likely in this dataset to be divorced or separated than
frequent church attending Roman Catholics and frequent church attending
Protestants. Lastly, it should be noted that although only two of these five va-
riables were statistically significant, all were in the expected direction (i.e. nega-
tive).
As for the variables regarding the actual child and fertility history, the dummy
for cases where there was no prior child and the continuous variable for the
number of births prior to the focal child both had negative coefficients and were
significant at the 0.1 level. The effect of the child at the focus of the PRMIHS be-
ing the first child was to reduce the chances of the dependent variable equaling 1
by approximately 10.3%, whereas each child had prior to the focal child reduced
said chances by nearly 3.6%. This effect may not seem like much at first glance,
but it is noteworthy considering that 193 respondents in the final sample had 3
or more children prior to the focal child.
7. Parting Thoughts
This analysis of the Puerto Rican Maternal and Infant Health Study dataset pro-
vides support for the assertion that relationships fail primarily because of the
people in them. The relationships which turned out to be the least stable, re-
gardless of which dummy variables were used, were the ones where the respon-
dent had not delayed entering into their first union until later in life, particularly
into their late 20s, and the ones in which the male exhibited undesirable qualities
by hitting his partner or going to jail. While it of course could be argued that it is
the stress of having one's partner going to jail or the possible negative employ-
ment consequences in the future for said partner that is truly affecting unions,
such an argument in this author's opinion mistakes an effect for a true cause.
Moving on to another point, perhaps the most interesting finding in this
analysis was that the best predictors of union stability were the interaction
representing cases where the respondent entered the union before 27 and en-
gaged in sexual intercourse before 17 and the interaction representing cases
A. Mastroniani
DOI: 10.4236/ojapps.2017.78031 428 Open Journal of Applied Sciences
where the respondent entered the union before 27 and engaged in sexual inter-
course after 17. While it is possible that later age at first sexual intercourse and at
first union could be driven by things such as low attractiveness and being social-
ly hermetic; a 2012 study found that adolescents who reported first sexual inter-
course at a later date than other adolescents actually were not less attractive
physically [57]. Moving on, it should be noted that these two variables, age at
first union and age at first sexual intercourse, quite possibly pertain to the as-
pects of life most under the control of the actual respondent compared to the
other aspects of life examined in this study. Income can be affected by things
such as a weak economy or being friends with someone who has hiring power,
educational attainment can be affected by something such as family finances
dictating that schooling must be foregone for an additional regular paycheck,
etc. At what age one first enters into a union or engages in first sexual inter-
course, however, are intimate decisions presumably not heavily or as heavily af-
fected by such externalities. Perhaps divorce falls into this category of being an
intimate decision, not an economic or rational one as it has primarily been
thought of in recent decades.
If the final sentence of the preceding paragraph is correct, it would dovetail
with studies showing that the reasons given most frequently by divorcees for
their divorces oftentimes include things such as extramarital sex and abuse [13]
[58] [59] [60] [61] [62]. South and Lloyd, it should be added, pointed out in their
1995 study that even with conservative estimates, a substantial number of di-
vorces in their work were presaged by extramarital sex [13]. The usefulness of
examining sexual behavior to understand marital stability has been documented
in other studies examining sex as well, particularly premarital sex [63] [64].
Notably, a 2012 study on young adults found that later age at first sexual inter-
course was associated with reduced odds of marriage or nonmarital cohabita-
tion, with fewer romantic partners in adulthood, and with greater relationship
satisfaction [57]. Furthermore, although not examining unions, some recent stu-
dies show that an economic, rational choice viewpoint is sometimes limited or
not the most explanatory viewpoint [65] [66] [67]. Given this fact, along with the
others presented in this paper, it may well be the case that the primary focus on
union status should return to where it had been before: on people and emotions.
