differs by serum concentrations of persistent organic pollutants:
a possible explanation for the obesity paradox

OBJECTIVE: Numerous studies have documented an obesity paradox in which the overweight and obese elderly have a better
prognosis than those with ideal body weight. Good prognosis among the overweight or obese elderly may reflect the relative
safety of storing the harmful lipophilic chemicals, known as persistent organic pollutants (POPs), in adipose tissue rather than in
other critical organs. Therefore, we hypothesized lower mortality among the obese elderly with a higher body burden of POPs,
but this pattern may not exist among the obese elderly with a lower body burden of POPs.
PARTICIPANTS: Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999--2004 study with a mean 4.2-year
follow-up, we tested whether the association between fat mass and total mortality in 635 (652 for organochlorine pesticides)
elderly participants aged X70 years differed depending on serum concentrations of 23 POPs.
RESULTS: There were statistically significant interactions between fat mass and POPs in predicting total mortality. In those with
low POP concentrations, there was no obesity paradox; mortality increased with fat mass (hazard ratios about 2--3 in the
highest vs lowest quintile of fat mass). However, consistent with an obesity paradox, these patterns completely disappeared in
those with high POP concentrations. Compared with the lowest quintile of fat mass, statistically significantly lower mortality
was observed in the elderly in the third to fifth quintiles of fat mass. In the case of polychlorinated biphenyls, the mortality in
the highest quintile of fat mass was only one-fifth of that in the lowest quintile.
CONCLUSION: These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that adipose tissue provides relatively safe storage of toxic
lipophilic chemicals, a phenomenon that could explain the obesity paradox. Although weight loss may be beneficial among the
obese elderly with low POP concentrations, weight loss in the obese elderly with higher serum concentrations of POPs may
carry some risk.

INTRODUCTION
Although overweight and obesity are well-established indepen-
dent risk factors for chronic disease development in the general
population, numerous studies have documented an obesity
paradox in which overweight and obese people with various
conditions including old age, cardiovascular diseases, cancer or
chronic kidney diseases have a better prognosis than do patients
with ideal body weight.1--4
Several mechanisms have been discussed as possible
explanations.1--4 For example, the inaccurate assessment
of body fatness by the conventional body mass index has
been most commonly suggested as a potential explanation.
However, studies using directly measured body fat mass observed
a similar obesity paradox.5 Other speculations include a survival
effect, increased lean body mass, more aggressive treatment or
better nutritional reservation among obese patients or the
elderly,1--4 but data specifically supporting these possibilities are
not available.
Recently, background exposure in the general population to
persistent organic pollutants (POPs), lipophilic chemicals that
accumulate in adipose tissue, has been strongly linked to a variety
of chronic diseases.6--13 POPs, including polychlorinated dibenzo-
p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), poly-
chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorines pesticides
(OCPs) have been highlighted as being chemicals of concern.
POPs metabolize very slowly in humans, with half-lives of
several years or decades. As the natural organ for storage of fat
and fat-soluble substances, adipose tissue may be a relatively safer
depot for POP storage than other critical organs. From this
viewpoint, high body fat mass may not be harmful or could even
provide the benefit of affording enhanced capacity for less
harmful storage of POPs. Therefore, we hypothesized that the
association between obesity and mortality would differ depending
on POP levels. Specifically, we expected good prognosis among
the obese elderly with a higher body burden of POPs, but a poorer
prognosis among the obese elderly with a lower body burden of

POPs. This hypothesis was tested in subsamples of the National
Health and Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999--2004 mortality
follow-up database. Fat mass derived from dual X-ray absorptio-
metry was used as indices of obesity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study subjects
The continuous NHANES, conducted annually since 1999 by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, is an ongoing survey designed to measure
the health and nutritional status of the civilian noninstitutionalized US
population. In the NHANES 1999--2002, all POPs were measured in the
same subsample, whereas in the NHANES 2003--2004 OCPs were measured
in a subsample different from the one in which other POPs were measured.
Thus, the final sample sizes were 635 for PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs and 652
for OCPs, including subjects aged 70 years or older and followed up for
mortality through the end of 2006.
Measurement
Venous blood samples were collected and shipped weekly at À20 1C.
PCDDs, PCDFs, PCBs and OCPs were all measured as individual chemicals
by high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry
using isotope dilution for quantification. We selected 3 PCDDs (1,2,3,6,7,8,-
hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and
1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9-octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin), 3 PCDFs (2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodi-
benzofuran, 1,2,3,4,7,8-hexachlorodibenzofuran and 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachloro-
dibenzofuran), 12 PCBs (PCB028, PCB074, PCB099, PCB118, PCB126,
PCB146, PCB153, PCB156, PCB169, PCB170, PCB180 and PCB187) and five
OCPs (p,p0-DDE, trans-nonachlor, oxychlordane, heptachlor epoxide and
b-hexachlorocyclohexane) for which at least 80% of the study subjects had
concentrations more than the limit of detection. The fat mass was
measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry using Hologic QDR 4500A
fan-beam densitometers (Hologic, Bedford, MA, USA).
Mortality follow-up
Probabilistic matching was used to link NHANES participants with the
National Death Index to ascertain vital status. Matching was based on 12
identifiers for each participant (for example, Social Security number, sex
and date of birth). Persons who survived the entire follow-up period were
administratively censored on 31 December 2006. Follow-up time for each
person was calculated as the difference between the NHANES examination
date and the last known date alive or censored.
Statistical analysis
First, we checked whether there were statistically significant interactions of
serum concentrations of individual POPs (tertiles) with fat mass (quintiles)
in predicting total mortality using Cox proportional hazard models. Cutoff
points of tertiles of individual POPs were presented in Supplementary
Table S1. In addition to individual POPs, we also used the summary
measures of subclasses of POPs by summing the rank orders of the
individual POPs belonging to each subclass for subjects with detectable
values of each POP, assigning rank 0 to values that were not detectable.
Second, we calculated hazard ratios on the associations of total mortality
with fat mass by stratifying subclasses of POPs, which showed statistically
significant or marginally significant interactions. Adjusting covariates were
age, gender, race ethnicity, smoking status and physical activity.
All statistical analyses were performed with the SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and SUDAAN 9.0 (Research Triangle Institute, Research
Triangle Park, NC, USA). Estimates of main results were calculated
accounting for stratification and clustering,14 adjusting for age, gender,
race ethnicity, smoking status and physical activity instead of using sample
weights; this adjustment has been regarded as a good compromise
between efficiency and bias.14,15 As results were very similar with SAS 9.1
and SUDAAN 9.0, we present the results based on SAS 9.1.
RESULTS
Among 635 elderly with information on PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs,
150 subjects (underlying causes: 51 cardiovascular, 39 cancer, 17
respiratory disease and 43 others) died during the mean follow-up
time of 4. 2 years. Among 652 elderly with information on OCPs,
the number of deaths was 135. Data of the 635 participants with
regard to distributions of several factors including demographic
variables according to fat mass are shown in Table 1. The elderly
with more fat mass were likely to be younger, women, non-
smokers and physically inactive. They also had a higher prevalence
of diabetes or hypertension than the elderly with less fat mass.
Results based on 652 participants with information on OCPs were
similar to that shown in Table 1 (data not shown). Among all
subjects, compared with those with the lowest fat mass, the
adjusted hazard ratios were 1.0, 0.8, 0.6 (95% CI: 0.3--0.9), 0.9 and
0.9 across fat mass quintiles.
Table 2 shows P-values for interactions of fat mass with
individual POPs in prediction of total mortality after adjusting for
age, gender, race, cigarette smoking and physical activity. Among
23 individual POPs included in the analyses, all 3 PCDDs, 2 out of 3
PCDFs, 11 out of 12 PCBs and 1 out of 5 OCPs showed strong
interactions with fat mass in the prediction of total mortality. The
summary measure of PCDDs, PCDFs and PCBs also showed strong
interactions with fat mass. In POPs with dioxin activity, there was
no clear pattern according to toxic equivalent factor. Among five
OCPs, only heptachlor epoxide showed a meaningful significant
interaction.

Table 3 shows results of stratified analyses by summary
measures of those POP subclasses, which showed statistically
significant or marginally significant interactions in Table 2.
Patterns of associations between fat mass and total mortality
differed by POP concentrations. When the elderly had low levels
of PCDDs, PCDFs or PCBs, those in the highest quintile of fat mass
showed about two times higher mortality rates compared with
those in the lowest quintile of fat mass. Adjusted hazard ratios of
fat mass were 1.0, 1.8, 2.0, 3.0 (95% CI: 1.2--7.8) and 1.6 across fat
mass quintiles among the elderly within the lowest tertile of
heptachlor epoxide belonging to OCPs. However, these patterns
completely disappeared when the elderly had high levels of POPs.
Statistically significantly lower mortality rates in the elderly with
high fat mass (third to fifth quintile) were observed. The inverse
association between fat mass and mortality was particularly strong
with PCBs; the mortality was one-fifth as great among the elderly
in the highest quintile of fat mass compared with those in the
lowest quintile of fat mass. The interactions between fat mass and
POPs were displayed in Figure 1.
DISCUSSION
Among all subjects aged 70 years or older, compared with the
lowest fat mass group, elderly persons who were in the third
quintile of fat mass had a significantly lower mortality, and those
in the fourth or fifth quintile of fat mass did not show increased
risk of mortality, consistent with the well-known obesity paradox
in the elderly. Although methodological problems such as survivor
bias, selection bias, lead time bias or, in meta-analyses, publication
bias and confounders have been discussed in previous studies,2
no explanation has yet provided data that clearly explained the
paradox.
This study provides an avenue by which POPs and their storage
in fat tissue could contribute to the obesity paradox in the elderly.
For example, when we restricted analyses to subjects with
relatively low POPs, there was no obesity paradox: compared
with the lowest fat mass group, the risk of mortality among the
elderly with high fat mass was two to three times higher than
among those with low fat mass. On the other hand, the obesity
paradox was strongly observed among the elderly with high levels
of POPs. When the elderly had relatively high POPs, those with
high fat mass showed a lower risk of mortality than those with low
fat mass. This finding suggests a possible protective effect of
obesity against harmful lipophilic chemicals such as POPs.
Supporting the idea that harm could occur if POPs were not
harbored in adipose tissue, POPs released into plasma during
weight loss among obese persons were associated with a
decrease in serum T3 concentration, resting metabolic rate and
the activity of skeletal muscle oxidative enzymes.16,17
Besides the elderly, the obesity paradox is widely observed
among patients with a variety of chronic diseases including
cardiovascular diseases or cancer. Recent epidemiological studies

observed strong associations between serum concentrations of
POPs and a variety of chronic diseases in the same NHANES data
set,6--11 as well as with incident diabetes and related variables in
other studies.12,13 Therefore, patients with these diseases tend to
have higher levels of POPs, similar to the elderly with high POPs.
This observation could help explain why the obesity paradox is
observed among patients with a variety of chronic diseases, as
well as the elderly.
Within the concept of the obesity paradox, efficacy and
safety of weight loss can be questioned among the obese
elderly or patients with chronic diseases. One study reported that
intentional weight loss among overweight and obese patients
with coronary artery disease showed marked improvements
in obesity indices, lipid profiles and inflammation markers, but
there was only a nonsignificant trend for lower mortality,
suggesting that obesity might have some benefit that traded
off against the beneficial effects of improving traditional CVD risk
factors.5 If obese elderly or patients with chronic diseases had
high serum concentrations of POPs, our findings may indicate that
fat mass has such a beneficial effect as a relatively safe storage
site of lipophilic chemicals such as POPs. If an elderly person
was found to have high POP levels, our findings imply that
careful consideration should be given before instituting
intervention leading to weight loss. On the other hand, weight
loss may be beneficial among the obese elderly with low POP
concentrations.
Importantly, it is well known that spatial and temporal trends of
POPs vary greatly among populations.18,19 Therefore, the interac-
tions between obesity and POPs in prediction of mortality may or
may not be observed depending on the distribution of POPs in a
specific population. For example, if a population was studied in
which most people had high POP concentrations, for example,
similar to or higher than the third tertile of POPs in this study
subjects, it may be difficult to observe the interactions between
obesity and POPs in the prediction of mortality.
In fact, the relationships between obesity and POPs themselves
are not simple. Multidirectional associations between these two
closely related factors are possible. Obesity itself can increase the
half-lives of POPs.20 At the same time, exposure to low-level POPs
can itself cause obesity even though high-dose POPs can lead to
weight loss, likely due to cell toxicity.12,21 In addition, weight loss
leads to increased serum concentrations of POPs, whereas weight
gain leads to decreased serum POPs.22 Among the elderly, the
evolution of obesity over time during adulthood and aging-related
body composition and fat distribution changes may affect the
dynamics of POPs in the body. It would be desirable to
disentangle these complicated relationships in studies that
include repeated measurements of fat mass and concentrations
of POPs with follow-up for incident disease and intermediate
factors.
One limitation of this study was that, although power was
adequate for the study of total mortality, we had restricted power for
analysis of cause-specific mortality due to the small number of death
cases. Nevertheless, when we applied the same analyses to the 51
cardiovascular deaths, we observed a similar pattern of interaction
between fat mass and POPs. In addition, the elderly within the lowest
tertile of POPs are not sufficient to evaluate the pure effect of obesity
on mortality, because of strong correlations of POPs with age, so that
even the lowest tertile had substantial POPs concentrations. The
slight decrease of mortality in the second or third quintile of fat mass
compared with the elderly within the lowest tertile of POPs might
disappear if analyses could be restricted to the elderly with less POP
contamination. However, in a modern chemically contaminated
society, such a subpopulation may not exist. Finally, we could not
directly test whether the same interaction between fat mass and
POPs on mortality is observed among patients with chronic diseases.
On the basis of previous findings on the associations between POPs
and chronic diseases in the same NHANES data set, we could expect
that patients with these chronic diseases had higher concentrations
of POPs.
In conclusion, the different associations between fat mass and
mortality by levels of POPs are consistent with our hypothesis that
adipose tissue provides relatively safe storage of toxic lipophilic
chemicals. This phenomenon may contribute to explaining the
obesity paradox. Additional research on this topic would be
valuable.
