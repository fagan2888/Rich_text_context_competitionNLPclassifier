SUMMARY
This paper examines the female wage structure focusing on changes at dierent points in the wage
distribution. Newly developed quantile regression methods are used in analysing data from the March
Current Population Survey. The results show that while the most signi®cant changes for the less skilled
women took place at the bottom of the wage distribution, for the more skilled groups changes occurred at
both ends of the distribution. Consequently, wage inequality decreased for the high-school graduates and
increased for the younger college graduates. Furthermore, the more highly skilled women experienced the
steepest gain in wages regardless of their position in the distribution. # 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

1. INTRODUCTION
The US economy and its position in the world witnessed rapid changes in the past two decades,
especially during the 1980s. Much recent research in labour economics is devoted to the invest-
igation of the eects of these changes on the US wage structure.1 While researchers have not
ignored the female labour force, most studies have concentrated on the male labour force.2
The growing importance of the female labour force goes far beyond greater participation, to
their ®lling positions requiring more responsibilities and skills. Traditional family and household
duties still place more constraints on women than on men, but more married women are pursuing
independent careers. These developments in the commitment of women to participation in the
labour force have led to signi®cant changes in the wage distribution, especially relative to men.
For example, O'Neill and Polachek (1993) and Blau and Kahn (1992a) ®nd that: (1) the decline in
the women±men wage gap is due in part to the increases in the return to experience for women;
and (2) approximately one quarter of the convergence is due to an increase in education and
experience.

see Levy and Murnane (1992).
2 Goldin (1990) gives a detailed investigation of many aspects of the female labour force over the last few decades.
Using a percentile ranking method, Blau and Kahn (1992b) compare the women±men wage
gap in the USA to other industrialized countries. They ®nd that the rank method places the USA
at the very top, while the traditional mean ratio places it towards the bottom. They attribute this
®nding to the fact that the widening wage inequality for men is due mainly to a longer tail at the
bottom of the distribution.
This paper examines the female wage structure by refocusing the attention to changes at
dierent points in the wage distribution. I analyse changes in the conditional log wage quantiles
and within-group wage inequality for women in nine age groups, between 20 and 64 years, and
®ve cohorts (that can be followed throughout the sample period). The data come from the March
Current Population Survey (March CPS) for the years 1968, 1973, 1979, 1986, and 1990. Sample
selection bias is corrected in a non-parametric fashion using a two-step procedure similar to that
suggested by Heckman (1980).
The results portray several important ®ndings. The ®rst-stage estimation indicates that
traditional family and household duties played a less signi®cant role in the late 1980s than at the
beginning of the sample period. It is also found that the traditional probit estimates dier
considerably from the semiparametric least-squares estimates.
The results for the wage oer equation indicate that over time there are signi®cant dierential
changes in the conditional quantiles, and consequently wage inequality, across the various skill
groups. Most of the action for the lower skill groups and cohorts took place at the bottom of the
wage distribution. For the more skilled groups, signi®cant changes occurred at the top of the
distribution as well. Consequently, the younger and less educated groups experienced a greater
reduction in wage inequality. The results indicate that there are signi®cant sample selection biases
for all age groups, mostly at the low quantiles of the wage distribution in the early sample years.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and the
methods for making the data consistent over time. The economic model underlying the estima-
tion and related methodological issues are discussed in Section 3. Section 4 presents the empirical
results, while Section 5 summarizes and concludes. An Appendix gives a brief heuristic justi®ca-
tion for the econometric methods used in the paper.
2. THE DATA
The empirical analysis in this study is based on an extract from the March CPS for 1968, 1973,
1979, 1986, and 1990. It includes data on all women between the ages of 20 and 64.3 A woman is
de®ned here as working if: (1) she worked for at least two weeks; and (2) her total earned income
was positive. All nominal data are de¯ated by the implicit price de¯ator of personal consumption
expenditure for gross national income.4 The total number of observations and the percentage of
working women are reported in Table I.
Massive changes in the sampling frame, coverage, and imputation methods make the CPS data
dicult to use prior to 1975. Furthermore, prior to 1975 some of the variables were only
bracketed. For example, the number of weeks worked Ð a vital variable to this analysis Ð is
reported in only seven categories. To deal with this problem I adopt the same imputation method
suggested in Buchinsky (1994), whereby the variable `weeks worked last year' is imputed using
3 Since most of the relevant questions in the March CPS refer to the year preceding the sample year, the dates in this
study are the actual years to which the questions referred (i.e. the CPS year 1968 is referred to in this study as 1967, etc.).

the frequencies in the CPS years 1976, 1977, and 1978, conditional on sex, race, age and
education.5
As shown in Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1993), the changes made in the sampling, coverage and
imputation techniques mainly aect the top and bottom 10% of the wage distribution. Since this
also holds true after controlling for education and experience, these changes need not introduce
any bias as they do for mean regressions.
Another problem is that the CPS does not provide data for actual work experience. It is well
known (e.g. O'Neill and Polachek, 1993) that potential experience (computed as ageÀyears of
schoolingÀ6) is not a good proxy for women's actual experience. Hence, as is explained in detail
in Section 4, some additional adjustments are required.
Other data sources, such as the PSID (Panel Study of Income Dynamics) and the NLS
(National Longitudinal Survey), provide more detailed information about labour market
attributes of women, but suer from other problems (such as attrition). For the non-parametric
methods employed here the CPS data are more useful as they provide large samples which are
necessary in obtaining parameter estimates with reasonable precision.
3. ECONOMIC MODEL AND METHODOLOGY
The model estimated here can be traced back to the seminal paper by Gronau (1974) on the
selectivity bias induced by the job search process. In the context of quantile regression (for the
widely used linear form for wage oer) the conditional quantile of observed wages depends,
among other things, on a bias term of an unknown form which cannot be corrected using the
traditional parametric correction for sample selection. Therefore I resort to a non-parametric
method for mean regression proposed by Heckman (1980) and Newey (1991).6

Note: A woman is de®ned as working if: (1) she worked for at least two weeks; and (2) her total earned income was
positive. Women reported as `working without pay' are not included.
5 As indicated in Buchinsky (1994, 1995b) this imputation has proven to be very reliable. The estimated coecients from
quantile (and mean) regressions that use the imputed values of `weeks worked last year' dier by less than one standard
error from those obtained from the actual data for the years after 1977. A detailed description of the imputation method
is provided in an appendix in Buchinsky (1994). This appendix, as well as the actual MATLAB programs which do the
imputation, are available from the author upon request.
6 Alternative non-parametric approaches were considered by Choi (1992), Ahn and Powell (1990), Cosslett (1990), and
Gallant and Nychka (1987).

Since the function h
y
(g) in equation (4) is unknown, it is approximated by a series expansion,
following a two-step procedure similar to that introduced by Heckman (1980) and Newey (1991).
In the ®rst step the selection parameter g

is estimated. In the second step a quantile regression
is run on x

and on an estimate of h

As in Heckman and Honore
Â (1990), Heckman (1990), and Andrews and Schafgans (1996), the
constant term in the wage regression is identi®ed here from the sub-population for which the
probability of participation is close to one. I adopt here the idea suggested by Andrews and
Schafgans for the estimation of the constant term in mean regression. The procedure was carried
out as follows.

4. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS
When analysing aspects relating to the female labour force one must keep in mind the vast
changes over the past few decades. As is clearly seen from Table I, the participation rate of
women in the labour force has increased markedly across all age groups, from about 58% in 1967
to over 73% by 1989, with the larger increases in the younger age groups. Many more women
were engaged in professional, technical, and managerial occupations in 1989 (31.8%) than in
1967 (only 17.9%), while the percentage of working women in the `traditional' female occupa-
tions declined signi®cantly. Changes in the commitment of women towards active participation
in the labour force and in the attitude of American society towards working women have led to
vast changes in the women's wage structure, exceeding those in the economy. These changes are
re¯ected in the results presented in the next two sub-sections.16
4.1. First-step Estimation Ð The Participation Equation
The selection equation, i.e. the probability that a woman participates in the labour force, is
estimated using the common approach described in Mroz (1987). One signi®cant modi®cation is
that here the error distribution is not assumed to take any parametric form.
The dependent variable in this equation is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if a woman
works for pay, and 0 otherwise.17 The independent variables include: family composition by age,
children by age groups, personal nonearned income, other family income (excluding personal
income), education, potential labour market experience, interaction between potential labour
market experience and number of children in the family, dummy variables for race and
16 The results presented here are only for selected age groups and years, for which they seem most signi®cant. More
general results, for all years and age groups, are available from the author upon request.
17 It is implicitly assumed that a woman who wants to work can ®nd a suitable job. In times when the unemployment rate
is unusually high this may not be a good assumption.

metropolitan area, a set of nine division dummy variables, and a set of ®ve marital status dummy
variables.18
As mentioned in the data section, an additional problem that needs to be addressed is that only
potential experience, rather than actual work experience, is available from the CPS data.
Assuming that the main alternative use for woman's time is child rearing (and the home activities
related to this task), instead of the term X

(1 7 (d

)chld) can be viewed as the adjustment one needs to make to potential experience in
order to obtain actual experience, the variable of interest.19
The estimation was carried out for nine age groups, 20±24, 25±29, 30±34, 35±39, 40±44, 45±49,
50±54, 55±59, and 60±64. The results for selected age groups and years are reported in Table II,
along with the implied elasticities.20 In general, the coecients vary both across the dierent age
groups, at each of the sample years, and over the sample years for any of the age groups.
The results suggest that non-pecuniary family characteristics (e.g. family size, number of
children) are important factors in women's participation decision. However, they seem to be
more important for the younger age groups and more signi®cantly so in the early years than at the
end of the sample period. But even for these age groups it is signi®cant only in the early sample
years. Having young children (under the age of 6) has a more signi®cant impact on women's
probability of working. Nevertheless, this eect, as well, was found to be more signi®cant in the
18 The de®nition of a family unit is according to the 1981 CPS. An appropriate adjustment is made for the years prior to
1981. Non-earned income includes all sources of income other than work-related transfers or direct income from wages
and salaries. The variable `number of children in the family' includes only one's own children. The dummy variable for
race takes the value 1 if the individual is white, and 0 otherwise. The dummy variable for the metropolitan area takes the
value 1 if an individual lives in the CPS standard statistical metropolitan area (SMSA), and 0 otherwise. Education is
de®ned as the number of completed years of schooling. Potential labour experience is de®ned as: min(age Ð education Ð
6, age Ð 18). The division dummy variables are for the CPS divisions: New England, Middle Atlantic, East North
Central, West North Central, South Atlantic, East South Central, West South Central, Mountain, and Paci®c. Each of
these variables takes the value 1 if an individual lives in that division, and 0 otherwise. The marital status dummy
variables are for ®ve categories: married with spouse present, married with spouse absent, widowed, divorced (including
separated), and never married. Each dummy variable takes the value 1 if the individual is in that marital status, and 0
otherwise.
19 While the adjustment factor for x
a
is given by this term as well, I let the adjustment term for x2
p
be (1 7 (d
2
/g
2
)chld) to
allow for more ¯exible approximation of the term X
a
.
20 All estimates are normalized by the absolute value of the coecient on `number of other family members in the labour
force' (which is always found to be negative). The probit estimate for this coecient was highly signi®cant in all years and
changed very little, in absolute terms, over the sample years. This makes the comparison of the normalized coecients
more meaningful. Note that the elasticity of F with respect to the jth variable is given by

early sample years. The availability of more adequate daycare is one possible explanation for this
apparent change in the importance of having young children on the probability of working. In
addition, the signi®cant rise in women's real wages also makes it more likely that a woman be
oered a wage exceeding her reservation wage. The estimates for the older age groups are not very
precise and give weaker evidence as to the eect of having children on the participation decision.
In general, the family income variables, other family income, and personal non-earned income
have signi®cant negative impacts on the participation probability. As can be seen from the table,
the point estimates for other income become larger, in absolute terms, for the younger groups
over time, while other family income becomes less signi®cant. This indicates that the probability
of participation is not aected purely by the availability of more resources in the family. This
apparent result might re¯ect a few known facts about the younger age groups at the same point
in their life cycle as their older counterparts: (1) they have dierent expectations for their career
path; and (2) pursuing a career is a goal by itself, therefore substantially reducing their
reservation wages.
There are noticeable dierences in the participation behaviour for whites and non-whites. For
the youngest age group represented in Table II (25±29) a white woman in 1967 was much more
likely to work than a non-white woman. The completely opposite phenomenon is apparent at the
end of the sample period. This apparent change is less clear for the older age groups as the point
estimates toward the end of the sample year are statistically indistinguishable from 0. Marital
status and geographical location (not reported here) have only a marginal eect on the
probability of working with no particular pattern of changes either across the various age groups
or across the sample years.
As can be seen from Table II, the signi®cant changes in some of the coecients imply
signi®cant changes in the corresponding elasticities. The elasticities with respect to family size
and the number of children under age 6 dropped signi®cantly over the sample years. In contrast,
the elasticity of other sources of income (personal and family) ¯uctuated over the years with no
clear pattern of change. Note that the educational attainments have a larger impact on the
participation probability for all age groups, and especially for the younger age groups. This might
re¯ect the fact that as women have a longer participation horizon in the labour market over their
life time, they have a greater incentive to invest more in their own human capital.
Testing for equality of the non-parametric and probit estimates
Since the non-parametric and/or semiparametric methods are highly computer intensive, one
must ask the simple question: `Is it worth it?'21 A visual comparison of the SLS estimates with
those obtained for the probit model shows that they are of the same order of magnitude and have
the same signs. Yet dierences of 10±30% are apparent for most age groups in most years. Test
statistics for Hausman's test reported in Table III clearly indicate that for most age groups in
most years the null hypothesis of normal errors is clearly rejected at the 5% signi®cance level.
In order to verify that the general rejection of the null hypothesis is not simply an artifact of the
subjective choices (bandwidth, etc.) made, I computed an alternative test statistic, in which VÀ1
SLS
replaces (V
SLS
7 V
P
)71, giving: dHVÀ1
SLS
d. This test statistic severely penalizes the alternative
hypothesis when true, and may have no power at all. However, even this test overwhelmingly
rejected the null hypothesis for almost all age groups and years. While a rejection of the null
21 For comparison, the estimation using the SLS procedure takes between 3 to 5 hours for each age group, while the
estimation of the probit model, with similar speci®cations, takes a few seconds.

hypothesis may be indicative (but not conclusive evidence) of non-normal errors, it might not
aect the predicted participation probabilities and/or the quantile regression estimates.
To examine these aspects I performed two additional sensitivity tests. In the ®rst test I examine
whether or not the two sets of predicted probabilities (from the two alternative estimation
procedures) are statistically dierent from each other. The well-known Pearson test led to general
rejection of the null hypothesis in about half the age group±years compositions (23 out of the
total 45 cases) at the 5% signi®cance level. In the second test I computed two sets of quantile
regressions only for these 23 groups. In the ®rst set I used the probit predicted probability to form
the series expansion, while in the second set I used the SLS probability estimates. I then
constructed con®dence regions for the true parameter vectors based on the second set of quantile
regression estimates. In 21 out of the 23 cases these con®dence regions did not cover the quantile
regression estimates associated with the probit estimates. For these reasons I report only the set of
quantile regression estimates based on series expansions using the SLS estimates.
To assess and verify the applicability of the model estimated here I performed two additional
sensitivity analyses. First, I tested the applicability of a simple multiplicative heteroscedasticity
model, similar to the one suggested by Koenker and Bassett (1982). I assume that the error
structure takes the form: v  (v*  x)(1  l
1
g) and u  (u*  x)(1  l
2
g). The estimation of this
model was carried out using the minimum distance framework as outlined in Buchinsky (1995c).
The heteroscedasticity model was generally rejected, particularly for the younger age groups.22
This indicates that the error distribution depends on the single index g in a more complicated way
than is permitted by the above heteroscedasticity model.
In the second sensitivity analysis I examined the key issue of the dependence of the error term
on x
2
only through the single index. To do that I estimated the model for each of the age groups,
adding (in addition to the series expansion terms) polynomial functions of individual variables
from the selection equation. The estimated parameter vectors from this experiment remained
virtually unchanged relative to those with only polynomials of the single index g. These results
seem to indicate that, in general, the error term does depend only on the single index g(x
1
; a
0
, b
0
),
or, in other words, that Assumption E is satis®ed.

4.2. Second-step Estimation Ð The Wage Oer Equation
The second-step estimation of the wage equation includes only the working women.23 The model
estimated is a version of Mincer's (1974) model, similar to that considered in numerous other
studies in the literature. In contrast to previous studies, the focus here is on the characterization of
changes at various points of the conditional log wage distribution.
The dependent variable in the analysis is the log of weekly wages.24 The independent variables
control for personal characteristics (education and experience) and geographical location, and
are a subset of the independent variables from the selection equation.25
O'Neill and Polachek (1993, Tables 3 and 4) report that for the PSID data, the proportion of
actual to potential experience is between 0.65 and 0.80. The implied ratios estimated using the
adjustment factor discussed above are well within this range, with larger ratios for the younger
women than for the older groups. Furthermore, the returns to experience are closer to those
reported by O'Neill and Polachek for the PSID data using actual experience than to the estimates
using the CPS data without the adjustments to potential experience. This suggests that the
reported estimates are not systematically biased in any particular fashion.
Several mean and quantile regressions, with and without correction for sample selection, were
considered. The quantile regressions were estimated at ®ve representative quantiles, namely the
0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 0.90. A preliminary analysis, using Craven and Wahba's (1979) cross-
validation technique, suggests that for the data at hand, two terms of orthogonal polynomials
should be included in the series expansion.26
In addition to analysing changes at dierent quantiles of the wage oer distribution, I also
examine changes in two measures of within-group wage inequality formed as the dierence
between conditional quantiles. The 90-10 measure (and similarly the 75-25 measure) is de®ned
as the dierence between the 0.90 and the 0.10 conditional quantiles. These measures are
further decomposed into two half-spreads relative to the conditional median of the distribution.
Analysing these measures allows one to directly identify which part of the distribution contri-
butes more to the overall inequality.
Changes in the conditional quantiles
The estimated conditional quantiles and means of log weekly wage are provided in Table IV for
high school and college graduates for several representative age groups. Note that the results are
23 To make the data selection comparable with other studies I excluded self-employed from the analysis. Nevertheless, the
proportion of self-employed was quite small in all years and excluding them from the analysis has virtually no eect on
the results.
24 More precisely, this variable is de®ned as the log of the ratio between total earnings from wages and salaries and the
number of weeks a person worked.
25 The variables include: education, experience, experience squared, experience interacted with education and the number
of children in the family, experienced squared interacted with the number of children in the family, a dummy variable for
white women, a set of geographical division dummy variables, a metropolitan area dummy variable, and a set of marital
status dummy variables. Omitted from the regression are the family characteristic variables, including the other sources
of income variables and those related to the number of children at various age groups. These exclusion restrictions,
together with the assumption made in the previous section, allow one to identify all the coecients from the wage oer
equation.
26 This is consistent with Newey, Powell, and Walker (1990), who reported that the same cross-validation technique led
them to include two terms in their analysis of Mroz's (1987) data. Addition of more terms to the series expansion
resulted, in some cases, in severe multicollinearity problems.

for the inverse Mill's ratio series expansion.27 The conditional quantiles are evaluated at the
median values of the variables, except for the dummy variables. The latter variables are evaluated
at the mean values over the entire period.28 Figures 1 and 2 depict the results for the two
education groups for a few representative age groups.
As can be clearly seen from Table IV and the accompanying ®gures, the conditional quantiles
changed quite dierently both across the various age groups, at any education level, and for the
two education levels, for any given age group. A common result for all age-education groups is
the general upward bias of the estimated conditional quantiles; a phenomenon most pronounced
for the lower quantiles at the early sample years, when the participation rate was relatively low.
This is consistent with the economic model outlined above; we are more likely to observe those
women with wage oers at the upper end of the distribution as their participation probabilities
are higher. The results suggest that as wages increased considerably at all quantiles, more women
who obtain wage oers even at the lower end of the distribution will choose to work.
Note that the bias tends to be larger for the middle-range age groups (25±44) than for the very
young (20±24) or older groups (45). For the younger group, some of the individuals are still in
college and will not join the labour force, giving up potentially higher earnings in the future,
unless they were oered a relatively high wage. Women in the older groups, who are out of the
labour force, are also likely to be with a short work history, and are therefore likely to be oered a
relatively low wage which, in turn, induces them to stay out of the active labour force.
Figures 1 and 2 seem to indicate that there is a more systematic upward trend, most pro-
nounced at the upper quantiles, for the most highly educated individuals. Furthermore, there is a
signi®cant upward shift of the level of the conditional quantiles, which increased over time in
favour of the groups with higher educational attainments. Note also that the conditional mean
for all educational groups, and more so for the more highly educated groups, is consistently
below the conditional median. Nevertheless, they do exhibit the same general pattern of change
as the conditional medians.
Within-group wage inequality Ð age group analysis
Table V reports the 90-10 and 75-25 inequality measures for the two education groups as before,
while Figure 3 depicts these measures for a few selected age groups. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) for the
high school graduates show that there are signi®cant dierences in the level of these measures
among the various age groups. Both measures of inequality tend to be larger for the middle age
groups than for the other groups, with a clearer pattern of downward trend. Nevertheless, a
signi®cant decline is observed for all groups over the entire sample period. The 90-10 measure
implies that the ratios between the wages at the 0.90 quantile and 0.10 quantile were 8.9, 9.7, 8.9,
and 6.2 for the 25±29, 35±39, 40±44, and 55±59 age groups, respectively, in 1967. By 1989 these
ratios reduced signi®cantly to 2.8, 5.6, 3.2, and 3.4, for the same four age groups. Smaller but
signi®cant decreases in these ratios, from about 3 in 1967 to less than 2 in 1989, is also observed
for the 75-25 measure. Note that the general downward trends in the inequality measures for all
27 For the conditional means I also provide estimates based on the traditional inverse Mill's ratio, which uses the probit
estimates. The inverse Mill's ratio approximation series uses the SLS estimates of the participation probability. The ®rst is
valid only if the underlying error terms are normally distributed. The results for the other approximation series are
omitted for brevity.
28 Evaluating the dummy variables at their mean values gives one representative number, for each conditional quantile,
averaged over all geographical divisions, marital statuses, and race.

age groups were dominated mostly by changes at the lower conditional quantiles and the
corresponding (50-10 and 50-25) half-spreads.
Changes in the inequality measure for the college graduates were somewhat dierent than
those for the high school graduates, as is demonstrated in Figures 3(c) and 3(d). Nevertheless, we
observe a similar pattern of signi®cant decreases in the inequality measures, mainly during the
®rst half of the sample period. Note that lower levels of inequality are observed for the younger
and older groups. Again, changes at the lower end of the distribution dominated the pattern of
change in the inequality measures. The implied ratios between the wages at the 0.90 quantile and
0.10 quantile in 1967 were 8.2, 5.1, 7.5, and 5.4 for the 25±29, 35±39, 40±44, and 55±59 age
groups, respectively. By 1985 these ratios declined to 5.6, 4.0, 4.0, and 4.6, a much smaller
reduction, in relative terms, than for the high school graduates.
Within-group wage inequality Ð cohort analysis
There are ®ve cohorts that can be followed throughout the sample period, namely those who were
in the 20±24, 25±29, 30±34, 35±39, and 40±44 age groups in 1967. Being in dierent age groups in
1967 meant completely dierent market perspectives and career horizons. It turns out that the
general trends are quite similar for the two education groups, with a clearer pattern for the college
graduates. The results for the college graduates are depicted in Figure 4.

both cohorts. Furthermore, there are signi®cant dierences in the pattern of change of each
measure for the two cohorts. While for the 20-24 cohort there are signi®cant increases in the two
measures during the ®rst half of the sample period, for the 30±34 cohort there are general
downward trends throughout the sample period. Also, while changes in the inequality measures

for the younger cohort were equally aected by the two half-spreads composing them, changes
for the 30±34 cohort were dominated mostly by the lower half-spreads (i.e. the 50-10 and 50-25).
It is clear from the results presented so far that younger women in 1967 had better career
perspectives than older women. In particular, the more highly skilled women, who also have a
greater commitment to participating in the labour force, gained more than their older counter-
parts. Signi®cant dierences between the corresponding conditional quantiles of college gradu-
ates and high school graduates, for all cohorts, indicate that after a drop during the early part of

the sample, there were signi®cant increases in all conditional quantiles for the college graduates
relative to the high school graduates. That is, the wage distribution of college graduates
dominates that of high school graduates for all cohorts, most signi®cantly toward the end of the
sample period.
5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Most recent research on changes in the US wage structure, and particularly on changes in the
return to skills, have concentrated on the male labour force and were restricted, generally, to
mean type analyses. Studies which investigate changes aecting the entire distribution need to
incorporate techniques which allow examination of changes at distinct points of the distribution.
I use quantile regression techniques with non-parametric correction for sample selection to
analyse changes in the conditional wage distribution for women using the March Current
Population Survey (March CPS) for the years 1968, 1973, 1979, 1986, and 1990. This procedure
allows me to compute measures of wage inequality at dierent ranges of the distribution.
The estimation is carried out in two steps. First, a single linear index model is estimated using a
semiparametric least-squares estimator proposed by Ichimura (1993). Key results from the ®rst-
stage estimation are: (1) traditional family and household duties play a lesser role as time
progresses; (2) these duties seem to be more important for the younger age groups than they are
for the older age groups; and (3) there are signi®cant dierences between the SLS and the probit
estimates for almost all age groups and years.
In the second step, the estimated single index is used to form a series approximation for the
unknown selection bias term. In the estimation of the wage oer, a version of the traditional
Mincer's (1974) model is adopted. The estimation is carried out for nine age groups, at ®ve-year
age intervals between the ages of 20 and 64, at ®ve quantiles, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 0.90, as
well as for a mean regression. The results indicate that there is less variation, and more consistent
increases in the higher conditional quantiles for the more educated groups. Signi®cant increases
at the lower quantiles are observed for all age groups. The result of this phenomenon is a decrease
in wage inequality for all women, especially for the less skilled. For the college graduate group in
particular, there were more pronounced increases in the top quantiles but they were accompanied
by the same sharp increases in the lower conditional quantiles. A common result for all age
groups is the severe upward sample selection bias, especially at the lower quantiles. Nevertheless,
this bias became much smaller over time as more women entered the labour market.
The results for the ®ve cohorts that can be followed throughout the sample show that there are
signi®cant dierences in the way the inequality measures have changed and particulary the way
the two half-spreads composing each measure have changed. The most pronounced decreases in
wage inequality are observed for the high school graduate group, while for the younger college
graduates there were signi®cant increases in wage inequality through most of the sample period.
The results also indicate that highly quali®ed women have gained a lot in terms of wages,
conditional on their characteristics, regardless of their position in the distribution.
APPENDIX: ASYMPTOTIC DISTRIBUTION FOR 
b
y
The method employed here can be intuitively explained as follows. If the selection term h
y
(g) was
known, then one could simply include it in the quantile regression (in addition to x
2
) to obtain
a consistent estimate for b
y
. Since h
y
(g) is unknown, it is approximated by a polynomial

series: P(g)  d
y0
 d
y1
f(g)  . . .  d
yS
f S(g). As the sample size increases one needs to increase
the number of terms in this series. Asymptotically, P(g) approximates h(g) arbitrarily closely.
For the purpose of inference, one needs to compute, L
b
y
, the covariance matrix of 
b
y
. This can
be accomplished by taking S as ®xed and forming a covariance matrix for 
bH
y
Y 
dH
y
 as if they were
simple coecient estimates in the yth quantile regression of y on x
2
and ( f(g), . . . , f S(g)).
One complication is that without further assumptions the constant b
y1
in b
y
cannot be
separately identi®ed from d
y0
. However, as is explained in the text, b
y0
can be identi®ed if there is
a subset of observations for which the participation probability was arbitrarily close to 1. In the
®rst part of this Appendix I describe how to obtain the asymptotic distribution for the slope
coecients of the estimated vector 
b
y
. Then I describe how to obtain the asymptotic distribution
for the estimated coecient 
b
y1
, corresponding to the constant term in the wage oer equation.

This block diagonality stems from the fact that

is estimated based on a decreasingly small

totically equivalent to
