Objective: To determine prevalence estimates of expo-
sure to trauma and 12-month rates of posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) among juvenile detainees by demo-
graphic subgroups (sex, race/ethnicity, and age).
Design: Epidemiologic study of juvenile detainees. Mas-
ter's level clinical research interviewers administered the
PTSD module of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for
Children, version IV (DISC-IV), to randomly selected de-
tainees.
Setting: A large, temporary detention center for juve-
niles in Cook County, Illinois (which includes Chicago
and surrounding suburbs).
Participants: Randomly selected, stratified sample of
898 African American, non-Hispanic white, and His-
panic youth (532 males, 366 females, aged 10-18 years)
arrested and newly detained.
Main Outcome Measures: Diagnostic Interview Sched-
ule for Children, version IV.
Results: Most participants (92.5%) had experienced 1
or more traumas (mean, 14.6 incidents; median, 6
incidents). Significantly more males (93.2%) than fe-
males (84.0%) reported at least 1 traumatic experience;
11.2% of the sample met criteria for PTSD in the past year.
More than half of the participants with PTSD reported
witnessing violence as the precipitating trauma.
Conclusion: Trauma and PTSD seem to be more preva-
lent among juvenile detainees than in community samples.
We recommend directions for research and discuss im-
plications for mental health policy.

EACH YEAR, APPROXIMATELY
2.4 million youth are ar-
rested, accounting for 17%
of all arrests.1 On a typical
day, approximately 109000
youth are detained.2 The number of youth
in the juvenile justice system with psy-
chiatric disorders is a major public health
problem. Two thirds of males and three
quarters of females in juvenile detention
have 1 or more psychiatric disorders.3,4
The related literature suggests that
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is
more common in youth in the juvenile
justice system than in community
samples.4-15 Lifetime diagnoses of PTSD
in community samples of youth range
from 6.3%16 to 7.8%10; current diagnoses
are 3.5%.17 Prevalence of PTSD among
youth in the juvenile justice system var-
ies considerably, depending on the type
of sample, the measure used, and the
time frame assessed (within the past
year, within the past month, or at the
time of the interview).4,13-15,18-20 For ex-
ample, rates among males are 2.3%
among American Indian detainees (past
year)19; 4.8% among youth in secure
placement (past month)4; 24.2% among
felons in secure custody (at the time of
the interview)14; and 32.3% among incar-
cerated youth (at the time of the
interview).13 Far fewer data are available
on females in the juvenile justice system.
Duclos et al19 found 0 cases of PTSD
within the past year among 64 female
American Indian juvenile detainees. In
contrast, Cauffman et al15 found 47
(48.9%) of 96 incarcerated females met
criteria for PTSD in the past 3 months.
Unfortunately, most of these studies
aretoosmall,13-15,19 toounique,19 orlacksuf-
ficiently standardized diagnostic assess-
ments14 to generate reliable estimates. To
date, no large-scale study has examined the
prevalence of trauma and PTSD across
demographic subgroups that make up in-
creasing proportions of the juvenile jus-
tice population, that is, African Ameri-
cans, Hispanics, females, and younger
children. This omission is critical. Post-
traumatic stress disorder is associated with

with enormous personal and societal costs.24
In this article we present the prevalence of PTSD and
trauma among juvenile detainees. This study has 2 ad-
vantages: (1) a stratified, random sample, large enough
to compare sex, racial/ethnic, and age groups; and (2) a
standardized measure of PTSD, the Diagnostic Inter-
view Schedule for Children, version IV (DISC-IV).
METHODS
PARTICIPANTS AND SAMPLING PROCEDURES
Participants were part of the Northwestern Juvenile Project, a
longitudinal study of 1829 youth (aged 10-18 years) arrested
and detained between November 20, 1995, and June 14, 1998,
at the Cook County (Illinois) Juvenile Temporary Detention
Center (CCJTDC) in Chicago. The random sample was strati-
fied by sex, race/ethnicity (African American, non-Hispanic
white, Hispanic), age (10-13 years or 14 years), and legal sta-
tus (processed as a juvenile or as an adult) to obtain enough
participants to examine key subgroups (eg, females, Hispan-
ics, and younger children).
The CCJTDC received approximately 8500 admissions each
year during the time data were collected (John Howard Asso-
ciation, unpublished data, 1992). The CCJTDC is used solely
for pretrial detention and for offenders sentenced for fewer than
30 days. All detainees younger than 17 years are held at the
CCJTDC, including youth processed as adults (automatic trans-
fers to adult court). Youth up to the age of 21 years may be de-
tained in the CCJTDC if they are being prosecuted for an ar-
rest that occurred when they were younger than 17 years.
Like juvenile detainees nationwide,25 approximately 90%
of the CCJTDC detainees are male; most are racial/ethnic mi-
norities. The population of the CCJTDC is 77.9% African Ameri-
can, 5.6% non-Hispanic white, 16.0% Hispanic, and 0.5% other
racial/ethnic groups. The age and offense distributions of the
CCJTDC detainees are also similar to detained juveniles na-
tionwide.25
We chose the detention center in Cook County (which
includes Chicago and surrounding suburbs) for 3 reasons. First,
nationwide, most juvenile detainees live in and are detained
in urban areas.26 Second, Cook County is ethnically diverse and
has the third largest Hispanic population in the United States.27
Studying Hispanics is important because they are the largest
minority group in the United States28 and they are overrepre-
sented in the justice systems.25 Third, the detention center's size
(daily census of approximately 650 youth and intake of 20 youth
per day) ensured that enough participants would be available.
No single site can represent the entire country because ju-
risdictions may have different options for diversion.29,30 Nev-
ertheless, Illinois' criteria for detaining juveniles are similar to
other states'.29 All states allow pretrial detention if the juvenile
needs protection, is likely to flee, or is considered a danger to
the community.29,30
Detainees were eligible to be sampled, regardless of
their psychiatric morbidity, state of drug or alcohol intoxica-
tion, or fitness to stand trial. Within each stratum, we used a
random numbers table to select names from the CCJTDC's
intake log. Throughout the study, we tracked how many
participants were still needed to fill each cell. Project staff
sampled the rarest categories first. The final sampling frac-
tions ranged from 0.018 to 0.689. (Additional information
on the sample is available from us.)
Studying detained youth requires special procedures be-
cause they are minors, because they are detained, and because
many do not have a parent or guardian who can provide appro-
priate consent.31 Project staff approached participants on their
units, explained the project, and assured them that anything they
told us (except acute suicidal or homicidal risk) would be con-
fidential. Participants signed either an assent form (if they were
18 years) or a consent form (if they were 18 years). Federal
regulations allow parental consent to be waived if the research
involves minimal risk (45 CFR §46.116[c], 45 CFR §46.116[d],
and 45 CFR §46.408[c]).31,32 The Northwestern University In-
stitutional Review Board, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention Institutional Review Board, and the US Office of Pro-
tection from Research Risks waived parental consent. However,
as ethicists recommend, we nevertheless tried to contact par-
ents to provide them an opportunity to decline participation and
to offer them additional information (45 CFR §46.116[d][4]).33,34
Despite repeated attempts to contact the parent or guardian, for
43.8% of the participants, none could be found. In lieu of pa-
rental consent, youth assent was overseen by an independent par-
ticipant advocate representing the interests of the participants.
Federal regulations allow for a participant advocate if parental
consent is not feasible (45 CFR §46.116[d]).33
We began collecting data on PTSD 13 months after the
larger study began. Of the 1148 names selected, 34 detainees
(3.0%) refused to participate in the study. There were no sig-
nificant differences in refusal rates by sex, race/ethnicity, or age.
Two youth were released before finishing the interview; 189
youth left the CCJTDC while we were locating their caretak-
ers for consent or before we could schedule an interview; 25
youth were released after consent was obtained but before the
interview commenced. The final sample size was 898 and com-
prised 532 males (59.2%) and 366 females (40.8%); 490 Afri-
can Americans (54.6%), 154 non-Hispanic whites (17.1%), 252
Hispanic (28.1%), and 2 others (0.2%). Participants ranged in
age from 10 to 18 years; the mean was 14.8 years; the median
was 15 years.
Participants were interviewed in a private area, almost al-
ways within 2 days of intake. Most interviews lasted 2 to 3 hours,
depending on how many symptoms were reported. We used both
male and female interviewers. Female participants were always
interviewed by female interviewers. Interviewers were trained for
at least 1 month; most had a master's degree in psychology or an
associated field and experience interviewing high-risk youth. One
third of our interviewers were fluent in Spanish. We maintained
consistency throughout the study by monitoring scripted inter-
viewswithmockparticipants.Additionalinformationonourmeth-
ods is published elsewhere.3,35,36
MEASURING PTSD
We used the DISC-IV, based on DSM-IV criteria, to assess PTSD.
(Other disorders, presented elsewhere,3,35 were assessed using
the DISC, version 2.3.) Our data are based on the youth's self-
report because it was not feasible to interview caretakers. Like
other measures of PTSD in children,37 there are still insufficient
data on the DISC-IV's reliability and validity, in part, because the
PTSDdiagnosisisrelativelynew.37 Studiesdocumentingthemod-
ule'sreliabilityandvalidityareinprogress(P.Fisher,PhD,e-mail,
July11,2003).DespitethelackofpsychometricdataonthePTSD
module of the DISC-IV, we chose it for several reasons. The DISC
is the most widely used diagnostic instrument for child and ado-
lescent research.38 It is especially useful for large-scale epide-
miologic studies because it is relatively brief; it can be adminis-
tered by nonclinicians; it is designed to assess youth who have
and have not been traumatized; and it generates DSM-IV disor-
ders using computerized scoring.
The PTSD module assesses whether youth have ever ex-
perienced any of the 8 traumatic experiences listed in Table 1.
Participants then identify the event that was "the most diffi-

cult for you in your entire life." The DISC-IV assesses PTSD
diagnosis within the past year for this "worst" trauma.
Because we stratified our sample by sex, race/ethnicity, age,
and legal status, we weighted all prevalence estimates to re-
flect the population of the CCJTDC. All reported standard er-
rors and inferential tests have been corrected for design char-
acteristics with Taylor series linearization40,41 using the survey
estimation procedures of Stata Statistical Software: Release 8.0.39
Tests of prevalence use logit models, and tests of means of counts
use Poisson regression models.39 We used 2-tailed tests through-
out. To reduce the probability of type I errors, we used layered
Bonferroni corrections.42 Our level of significance for each group
of tests was P.05.
RESULTS
TRAUMA
Overall Rates
Table 1 shows that 92.5% of the sample had experi-
enced at least 1 trauma; 84.0% had experienced more
than 1 trauma (not shown); the mean number of trau-
matic incidents equals 14.6 ; the median equals 6 inci-
dents (not shown). Significantly more males (93.2%)
than females (84.0%) reported a traumatic experience.
There were no significant differences in overall preva-
lence of trauma across race/ethnicity for males and
females. Among both male and female detainees, sig-
nificantly more youth 14 years or older (94.2% males
and 86.5% females) reported trauma than youth aged
10 to 13 years (82.4% males [F1,523
=7.20, P=.008] and
59.1% females [F1,363
=14.56, P.001]); analyses of age
are available from us.
Specific Traumas
Table 1 also shows that, among both males and females,
the 3 most frequently reported traumas were having
"seen or heard someone get hurt very badly or be
killed" (reported by 74.9% of males and 63.5% of
females), having been "threatened with a weapon" (re-

POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER
Table 2 reports PTSD diagnoses in the past year for the
entire sample (11.2%). There were no significant differ-
ences in PTSD diagnosis by sex or across race/ethnicity
for males and females.
We examined precipitating traumas for persons di-
agnosed as having PTSD. Among male participants "hav-
ing seen or heard someone get hurt very badly or be killed"
was the most frequent precipitating trauma for PTSD, sig-
nificantly higher among males (58.9%) than females
(23.5%) (F1,98

pants, thinking "you or someone close to you was going

*Data are given as percentages unless otherwise indicated. Each cell is weighted to reflect the population of the detention center. Because females constituted only
7.3% of the detention center population, overall rates cannot be computed by averaging the rates of male and female participants. To protect against type I error, each
group of tests is Bonferroni-adjusted beginning with the lowest P to the highest; for this reason, the probability of type I error may not be a monotonic function of the
F statistics. We present Bonferroni-adjusted P values for tests that were originally statistically significant at .05. Tests for mean numbers of trauma are computed with
the Poisson regression for survey data module in Stata statistical software: Release 8.0.39
One male participant, who self-identified as "other," is excluded from the analysis of race/ethnicity.

cipitating trauma, significantly higher among females
(27.8%) than males (9.5%) (F1,98
=6.31, P=.01). (These
analyses are available from us.) Other precipitating trau-
mas were too rare to analyze further.
We also examined the age at which the participants
had experienced their worst, precipitating trauma. Most
participants (88.7%) reported that their worst traumas oc-
curredwithin2yearspriortotheinterview.However,being
forced to do something sexual--when that was identified
as the worst trauma--occurred 5 years before the inter-
view for most participants. (These analyses are available

COMMENT
TRAUMA
Exposure to trauma is a fact of life for delinquent youth.
More than 90% of our sample experienced at least 1 trau-
matic event; more than half (56.8%) were exposed 6 or
more times. These findings are comparable to reports from
smaller studies of youth in correction facilities.7,13,15,18
It is difficult to compare our findings to commu-
nity studies because published findings vary, depend-
ing on the sample (eg, urban, suburban, minority) and
which traumas were assessed. Yet, our overall preva-
lence of trauma is substantially higher than most stud-
ies of youth and young adults (ages 15-24 years), espe-
cially for severe and violent trauma.5,6,16,17,43-45
Witnessing violence, the most common trauma, is
far more common in our sample (63.5% of the females
and 74.9% of the males) than in most community stud-
ies of youth and young adults (4.9%-40.1%)5,6,10,16,43,46 Our
findings are most comparable to studies of urban teen-
agers.44,45,47-49 Living with widespread or chronic com-
munity violence in the inner city has been compared with
living in a war zone.47
TRAUMA AND PTSD
More than 1 (11.2%) of 10 detainees had PTSD during
the year prior to the interview. These estimates are lower
than those reported by Burton et al14 (24%, current dis-
order), Cauffman et al15 (48.9% of females, past 3 months),
and Steiner et al13 (31.7% of males, current disorder), per-
haps because our instruments and methods are differ-
ent. Burton et al14 used a symptom checklist adminis-
tered to small groups. Cauffman et al15 and Steiner et al13
used the PTSD module of the Revised Psychiatric Diag-
nostic Interview.50 The Revised Psychiatric Diagnostic In-
terview assesses symptoms of PTSD independent of a par-
ticular trauma. In contrast, the DISC, like most
instruments, assesses PTSD based on the participant's per-
ceived worst trauma.
The prevalence of PTSD in our sample was higher
than reported by Garland et al20 (3.1%, past year) and
Wasserman et al4 (4.8%, males only, past month), who
used the DISC, and Duclos et al19 (1.3%, past year), who
used a modified version of the Composite International
Diagnostic Interview (CIDI); the CIDI is similar in struc-
ture to the DISC. Our findings and those of prior stud-
ies may differ because of the point at which the sample
was drawn. We sampled youth right after they were de-
tained, and before their adjudication hearings. Garland
et al20 and Wasserman et al4 sampled convicted juve-
niles in secure placement. The findings of Duclos et al19
may be different from ours because their sample was com-
posed only of American Indian detainees.
The prevalence of PTSD in our sample (during the
12 months prior to the interview) exceeds lifetime esti-
mates of PTSD reported in community samples of youth
and young adults (3.5%-9.2%).5,6,10,16 More than half of our
participants with PTSD had reported witnessing violence
as the precipitant. Our findings might reflect that our par-
ticipants, like most juvenile detainees nationwide, live in
urban areas that have high rates of violence.51,52 Alterna-
tively, our findings are consistent with research linking
traumatic victimization in childhood and subsequent psy-
chosocial problems, such as delinquency, perpetration of
violence, and drug use.13,16,17,47,48,53-58
Why were rates of PTSD not higher, given the ex-
tent of exposure to trauma in our sample? There are sev-

*Posttraumatic stress disorder could not be determined for 4 participants
because of missing data. One male participant and 1 female participant who
self-identified as "other" (race/ethnicity) were excluded from the analyses.
Each cell is weighted to reflect the population of the detention center.
Because females constituted only 7.3% of the detention center population,
overall rates cannot be computed by averaging the rates of male and female
participants. This is also true for race/ethnicity and age. To protect against
type I error, each group of tests is Bonferroni-adjusted beginning with the
lowest P to the highest. For this reason, the probability of type I error may
not be a monotonic function of the F statistics. Tests of differences by
race/ethnicity and age within sex were not calculated because cell sizes were
too small.

eral possibilities. First, the types and patterns of trau-
mas reported by youth in community samples and our
sample differ. We do not know the conditional risk of
specific traumas in our sample because the DISC-IV, like
most instruments, assesses PTSD only for the worst
trauma.6 Second, traumatic experiences can precipitate
other conditions besides PTSD, for example, disruptive
behavior disorders, other internalizing disorders, some
personality disorders, and physical illnesses.37 These dis-
orders are common in our sample.3,35 Third, prevalence
of PTSD may have been higher had we asked about a wider
range of traumas, used more than 1 screen question to
ask about sexual abuse or other types of intimate vio-
lence, or conducted interviews using techniques that al-
low for anonymity (eg, the Voice DISC).4,59,60
Most demographic differences corroborated prior in-
vestigations of community samples.6,10,16,46,61 Although
male detainees were significantly more likely than fe-
male detainees to have experienced trauma, female de-
tainees were as likely to have PTSD as were male detain-
ees. In community samples, females are twice as likely
as males to develop PTSD following exposure to trauma.6
Like prior studies in the community, we found few
racial/ethnic differences in rates of trauma or PTSD.5,10
Those few differences pertained to the type of trauma re-
ported most frequently. In our sample, African Ameri-
can males were more likely to have witnessed violence
than were non-Hispanic whites, consistent with the high
levels of violence exposure among inner-city, minority
youth.62 Non-Hispanic white males were more likely to
have experienced actual and threatened violence than
other males. Among females, Hispanics were most likely
to have experienced violent victimization.
LIMITATIONS
Our findings are drawn from 1 site and may pertain
only to youth in urban detention centers with similar
demographic composition. Moreover, our findings are
based on a sample of pretrial detainees and may not be
generalizable to adjudicated juveniles serving sen-
tences.
Because it was not feasible to interview caretakers,
our data are subject to the reliability and validity of the
youths' self-report. However, youth and their caretak-
ers are comparable reporters of youths' anxiety disor-
ders.63 Recall of traumas may be affected by arrest and
detention; yet, recall of events by youth may be less sub-
ject to the distortions of time than recall by adults.5 More-
over, the DISC--like most measures--probes for PTSD
for the single-worst trauma; hence, we are unable to es-
timate the age of onset of PTSD or the vulnerability to
PTSD by type of trauma.6 Despite these limitations, our
study has implications for research on PTSD and for men-
tal health policy.
FUTURE RESEARCH
We suggest 3 directions for future research.
1. Studies of vulnerability to PTSD in high-risk
youth. Although more than 90% of our sample were ex-
posed to 1 or more traumas, only 11.2% of the sample
met criteria for PTSD in the past year. We need to de-
termine the relative risk of PTSD for types of trauma (eg,
witnessing murder, being shot, witnessing ongoing do-
mestic violence, sudden loss of a loved one) among youth
who are frequently exposed to trauma and violence, such
as our participants. Such studies could document fac-
tors that increase resilience to PTSD among high-risk
youth and guide prevention strategies.64,65
2. Studies of chronic community violence and its
relationship to PTSD. Community violence is epidemic
in inner cities.62 Research suggests that chronic expo-
sure to violence may have more deleterious effects on chil-
dren than acute violence.62 We must study the effects of
chronic community violence on high-risk youth as they
become adults.17 Longitudinal studies should examine the
role that witnessing violence plays in perpetuating the
cycle of violence.
3. DefinitionoftraumaanddiagnosisofPTSD.There
is a scarcity of research on the validity and reliability of di-
agnostic measures of PTSD, in part because the diagnosis
is relatively new.37 Moreover, the definitions of trauma in
DSM-IV are somewhat ambiguous66; hence, there is little
consistency among diagnostic instruments that measure
traumas. For example, most measures assess violent vic-
timization (DISC-IV, CIDI 2.1)67; others also assess trauma
from perpetration of violence (R. C. Kessler, PhD, Na-
tional Comorbidity Study--Replication, unpublished data,
2001-2002). Some measures assess sexual victimization by
anyperpetrator(DISC-IV,CIDI2.1);othersspecificallyask
about victimization by family members (DIS-IV,68 Na-
tional Comorbidity Study--Replication). These differ-
ences reduce the validity and reliability of diagnoses. We
need a consensually understood and empirically vali-
dated framework to define and measure traumatic
events.24,69-71
IMPLICATIONS FOR
MENTAL HEALTH POLICY
The mental health system must
1. Improve services for victims of trauma. Expo-
sure to trauma is a serious public health problem among
high-risk youth. Yet, services are insufficient.43 Timely
interventions may avert subsequent and often chronic so-
cial problems common among traumatized youth.8,16,62
To the extent that PTSD is correlated with subsequent
violent perpetration, effective treatment is also a matter
of public safety.15,72,73
2. ImprovethedetectionofPTSD.TheSurgeonGen-
eral'sreportonchildren'smentalhealthsuggeststhatemer-
gency medical providers must address the mental health
needs of youth who have experienced trauma.74 Posttrau-
matic stress disorder is frequently overlooked even in the
best psychiatric settings.75,76 Because PTSD frequently co-
occurs with other psychiatric disorders,10,16 it can be dif-
ficult to detect without systematic screening.
3. Avoid retraumatizing youth. The conditions of
confinement often exacerbate symptoms of mental disor-
der, including PTSD.77 Juvenile justice providers must also
reduce the likelihood that youth will be retraumatized dur-
ing routine processing. Symptoms of PTSD may be exac-

erbated by such common practices as handcuffs and
searches.78,79 In detention centers, psychiatric crises are of-
ten handled by isolating and restraining symptomatic de-
tainees. These practices can trigger or escalate symptoms
of PTSD (eg, severe anxiety, aggression, and numbing of
emotions).78,79 Psychiatrists can help to develop strate-
gies to manage emergencies more humanely--and, ulti-
mately, more cost-effectively.
Our nation's delinquent children are among the most trau-
matized. We must balance the resources used to punish
with resources needed to heal the traumas endured by
vulnerable youth.
