A Prospective Examination of Whether Childhood Sexual
Abuse Predicts Subsequent Sexual Offending
Cathy Spatz Widom, PhD; Christina Massey, MA
IMPORTANCE Childhood sexual abuse has been assumed to increase the risk for sexual
offending. However, despite methodological limitations of prior research, public policies and
clinical practice have been based on this assumption.
OBJECTIVE To empirically examine the commonly held belief that sexually abused children
grow up to become sexual offenders and specialize in sex crimes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective cohort study and archival records
check included cases and control individuals originally from a metropolitan county in the
Midwest. Children with substantiated cases of physical and sexual abuse and neglect (aged
0-11 years) were matched with children without such histories on the basis of age, sex,
race/ethnicity, and approximate family social class (908 cases and 667 control individuals).
Both groups were followed up into adulthood (mean age, 51 years). The court cases were
from 1967 to 1971; the follow-up extended to 2013.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Criminal history information was collected from federal and
state law enforcement agency records at 3 points in time and from state sex offender
registries.
RESULTS Overall, individuals with histories of childhood abuse and neglect were at increased
risk for being arrested for a sex crime compared with control individuals (adjusted odds ratio
[AOR], 2.17; 95% CI, 1.38-3.40), controlling for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Specifically,
individuals with histories of physical abuse (AOR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.02-4.16) and neglect (AOR,
2.21; 95% CI, 1.39-3.51) were at significantly increased risk for arrest for sex offenses, whereas
for sexual abuse, the AOR (2.13; 95% CI, 0.83-5.47) did not reach significance. Physically
abused and neglected males (not females) were at increased risk and physically abused males
also had a higher mean number of sex crime arrests compared with control individuals. The
results did not provide support for sex crime specialization.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The widespread belief that sexually abused children are
uniquely at risk to become sex offenders was not supported by prospective empirical
evidence. These new findings suggest that early intervention programs should target children
with histories of physical abuse and neglect. They also indicate that existing policies and
practices specifically directed at future risk for sex offending for sexually abused children may
warrant reevaluation.

Childhood sexual abuse is a significant problem with se-
rious social, psychological, and physical health
consequences.1,2 Among these, childhood sexual abuse
isbelievedtoincreasetheriskforsubsequentsexualoffending.3
Numerous reports have described sexual abuse in the back-
grounds of adult sex offenders who were either incarcerated
orintreatmentprograms4-14 andjuvenilesexualoffenders.15-20
However, the cross-sectional design of these studies intro-
duced ambiguity into the meaning of these findings because
retrospective data do not provide evidence of prospective risk.
A 2004 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report rec-
ommended priority for research that takes an upstream ap-
proach to the problem of sexual violence by attempting to de-
termine factors that predict violence before it occurs.21
To our knowledge, few prospective studies have followed
up childhood sexual abuse survivors into adolescence or adult-
hood to date. An earlier report from the US Government Ac-
countabilityOffice22 concludedthatresearchfindingsonthere-
lationship between childhood sexual abuse and later sexual
offending were inconsistent and inconclusive. Many existing
studies also lacked a control group, making it difficult to evalu-
ate the extent to which estimates are higher than the general
population.Oneexceptionwasaprospectivestudyofindividu-
als with documented cases of childhood abuse and neglect and
matchedcontrolindividualswhowerefollowedupwithasearch
ofcriminalarrestrecordsthroughameanageof32years.23 Those
who experienced childhood sexual abuse, physical abuse, and
neglectwereatriskforcrimeanddelinquencyincludingsexual
offending. Survivors of childhood sexual abuse were at most
risk for prostitution, and none had arrests for incest, child mo-
lesting, public indecency, or contributing to the delinquency
of a minor.23 Another study followed up male childhood sexual
abuse survivors (mean age, 11 years) for a period of 7 to 19 years
and found that 11.6% had subsequently committed sexual of-
fenses,concludingthatthe"riskofchildvictimsofsexualabuse
becoming abusers themselves is lower than previously
thought." 24(p474)
However, these 2 prospective studies23,24 were limited be-
cause of the ages of the study samples. The US Department of
Justice reported that 4 of 10 sexual assaults are committed by
individuals 30 years or older.25 Statistics from the 2009 Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation Uniform Crime Reports showed
that individuals 30 years and older accounted for 48.7% of ar-
rests for sex offenses.26 Thus, it is possible that the 2 earlier
studies showing little or no association between childhood
sexual abuse and risk for arrest for sexual offenses may have
underestimated the extent of sexual crimes because sexual of-
fendersareolderonaveragethanotherkindsofoffenderswhen
first convicted.27 On the other hand, some research suggests
that individuals who were sexually abused commit their first
sex crime at a younger age than individuals without such
histories.17,28
Sex offenders are also assumed to be persistent offenders
who specialize in sex crimes.29 Empirical evidence has been
mixed; however, current research suggests that sex offend-
ers are not specialists.30,31 Instead, the convicted sex of-
fender is characterized by a more general pattern of antiso-
cial behavior.32
The current study was designed to improve on earlier re-
search with a longer-term follow-up into the adulthood (mean
age, 51 years) of individuals with documented cases of child-
hood sexual and physical abuse and neglect and matched con-
trol individuals. We hypothesized that compared with physi-
cally abused and neglected children and matched control
individuals, those with documented histories of childhood
sexualabuseareatgreaterriskforbeingarrestedforasexcrime
and committing a larger number of sex crimes, are younger at
their first arrest for a sex crime, and are more likely to special-
ize in sex crimes.
Methods
Thisresearchuseddatafromaprospectivecohortdesignstudy
in which abused and neglected children were matched with
nonabused and non-neglected children and followed up into
adulthood.33 Notable features of the design include an unam-
biguous operationalization of child abuse and/or neglect (sub-
stantiated court cases); a prospective design; separate abused
and neglected groups; a large sample; a comparison group
matched as closely as possible on age, sex, race/ethnicity, and
approximate social class background; and assessment of the
long-term consequences of abuse and/or neglect beyond ado-
lescence and into adulthood.
The prospective nature of the study disentangled the ef-
fects of childhood experience of abuse from other potential
confounding effects. Because of the matching procedure, par-
ticipants were assumed to differ only in the risk factor, that is,
having experienced childhood neglect or sexual or physical
abuse. Because it is obviously not possible to randomly as-
sign participants to groups, the assumption of group equiva-
lencyisanapproximation.Thecomparisongroupmayalsodif-
fer from the abused and neglected individuals on other
variables nested within abuse or neglect.
Cases were drawn from the records of county juvenile and
adult criminal courts in a Midwest metropolitan area during
the years 1967 to 1971 (N = 908). To avoid potential problems
with ambiguity in the direction of causality and ensure that
the temporal sequence was clear, cases were restricted to chil-
dren younger than 12 years at the time of the abuse or neglect
incident. Physical abuse cases included bruises, welts, burns,
abrasions, lacerations, wounds, cuts, bone and skull frac-
tures, and other evidence of physical injury. Sexual abuse
charges varied from felony sexual assault to fondling or touch-
ing in an obscene manner, rape, sodomy, and incest. Neglect
casesreflectedajudgmentthattheparents'deficienciesinchild
care were beyond those found acceptable by community and
professional standards at the time and represented extreme
failure to provide adequate food, clothing, shelter, and medi-
cal attention.
A critical element of this design was the establishment of
a comparison or control group, matched on the basis of sex,
age,race/ethnicity,andapproximatefamilysocioeconomicsta-
tus during the period under study. This matching is impor-
tant because it is theoretically plausible that any relationship
between child maltreatment and later outcomes is con-

founded or explained by social class differences. Children who
were younger than school age at the time of the abuse or ne-
glect were matched with children of the same sex, race/
ethnicity, date of birth (±1 week), and hospital of birth through
county birth record information. For school-aged children,
more than 100 elementary schools' records were searched to
find matches of the same sex, race/ethnicity, date of birth (±6
months), and same class in same elementary school during
1967-1971. Overall, there were 667 matches (73.7%) for the
abused and neglected children. Records were checked and no
members of the control group were reported to the courts for
abuse or neglect, although it is possible that some may have
experienced unreported abuse or neglect.
The City University of New York and Federal Bureau of
Investigation institutional review boards approved the
procedures involved in this study and waived participant
consent.
Participants
A total of 1575 individuals (908 abuse/neglect cases and 667
matched control individuals) were included in this study. Ap-
proximatelyhalfthesamplewasfemale(51.0%)and66.3%were
white, non-Hispanic. The mean (SD) age of the sample in 2013
was 51.33 (3.56) years (range, 42-61 years).
Measures
Criminal histories were compiled from searches conducted
during 1987-198834 and 1994.35 In addition, an updated
search of arrest records was conducted in 2013 using infor-
mation from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National
Crime Information Center and state law enforcement
agency in the Midwestern state where the records of child-
hood maltreatment were initially collected. This new infor-
mation was combined with prior records to create a compre-
hensive criminal history record for each person. Sex
offenses included statutory rape, child molestation, entic-
ing a child for indecent purposes, sexual battery, criminal
deviant conduct, solicitation of a minor, child pornography,
vicarious sexual gratification, sexual misconduct with a
minor, incest, indecent exposure, peeping, rape, sexual tor-
ture, lewd conduct, sodomy (until Lawrence v Texas [2003],
sodomy was considered an offense in many jurisdictions),
and aggravated sodomy. Specialization was defined as hav-
ing more than 50% of the crimes on a person's criminal rec-
ord representing a sex crime.30,36
TheDruSjodinNationalSexOffenderPublicWebsite(http:
//www.nsopr.gov) was also searched for information from
all 50 state sex offender registries. Information was recorded
for state of residence and offense commitment, type of sex
offense, date of conviction, sentence length, victim age or
sex, classification level of offender, and registration compli-
ance status.
Statistical Analyses
All variables and scales were examined for outliers and skew-
ness.Differencesbetweenthecontrolandabuse/neglectgroups
overall and specific types (sexual and physical abuse and ne-
glect) were examined. Logistic regressions were used for di-
chotomous dependent variables (an arrest), whereas ordi-
nary least squares regressions were used with continuous
variables (number of offenses). When count variables were sig-
nificantly skewed, generalized Poisson regressions were used.
The Kaplan-Meier product-limit technique was used to evalu-
ate the survival function at the age at onset of sex offending
for uncensored cases and age at time of Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation record review for censored cases. The log-rank sta-
tistic (Mantel-Cox) was used to test for differences between the
survivalfunctions,weighingallcasesequally.Allanalysescon-
trolled for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Because of sex differ-
ences in the rates of offending,34 analyses were repeated for
men and women separately. The number of participants var-
ied slightly in each analysis owing to missing data. Statistical
significance was set at 0.05 and IBM SPSS Statistics (version
21) was used.

Overall,abusedandneglectedchildrenweresignificantlymore

child abuse and neglect increased the risk for being arrested
for a sex crime (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.17; 95% CI, 1.38-
3.40). Specifically, individuals with histories of physical abuse
(AOR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.02-4.16) and neglect (AOR, 2.21; 95% CI,
1.39-3.51) were at increased risk for arrest for sex offenses,
whereas for childhood sexual abuse, the AOR did not reach sig-
nificance (AOR, 2.13; 95% CI, 0.83-5.47).
For males, child maltreatment (AOR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.37-
3.71), physical abuse (AOR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.07-4.81), and ne-
glect (AOR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.37-3.79) increased the risk for ar-
rest for a sex crime, whereas sexual abuse did not reach
significance (AOR, 1.94; 95% CI, 0.52-7.24). For females, child
abuse/neglect overall and specific types of abuse or neglect did
not increase the risk for arrest for sex crimes.
The number of arrests for sex offenses did not differ sig-
nificantly between the abuse/neglect (mean [SD], 1.91 [1.37])
and control groups (mean [SD], 1.67 [1.09]) (Wald 2

P = .464; Table 2). However, individuals with histories of child-
hood physical abuse ( = 0.42; P = .004) and males ( = 0.49;
P = .001) had a larger number of arrests for sex crimes.
Childhood Sexual Abuse and Age at First Arrest
for a Sex Crime
The mean age at first arrest for a sex crime ranged from early
20s to early 30s. There were no significant differences among
the groups (Table 2). Inspection of the pattern of age at onset
of these arrests (Figure 2) shows that the curves for the abuse/
neglect (log-rank statistic = 8.737; df = 1; P = .003) and ne-
glect groups (log-rank statistic = 11.113; df = 1; P = .001) were
significantlydifferentfromthecontrolindividuals,withatrend
for physical abuse (log-rank statistic = 3.673; df = 1; P = .06).
The sexual abuse group did not differ from the control group
(log-rank statistic <.001; df = 1; P = .99).

Childhood Sexual Abuse and Specialization in Sex Crimes
Of those in the sample with arrests for sex crimes, few (6.67%)
had records that included only sex offenses. Only 10 (9.52%)
of the sex offenders met the criteria for specialization, and 3
of these were control individuals.
Discussion
The current study examined a number of commonly held be-
liefs about the consequences of childhood sexual abuse and,
specifically, the likelihood that these child victims will grow
up to become sexual offenders and specialize in sex offend-
ing. Using a prospective design, we found that individuals with
histories of childhood abuse and neglect were at increased risk
for being arrested for a sex crime compared with individuals
without such histories, and this effect was primarily in those
with histories of childhood physical abuse and neglect and for
males. This pattern of offending is consistent with earlier find-
ings that childhood survivors of physical abuse and neglect
were at increased risk for being arrested for a violent crime and
reinforces the notion that sex crimes are also violent crimes.
Contrary to what is commonly believed, individuals
with a history of childhood sexual abuse were not at unique
risk to be arrested for a sex crime compared with physically
abused or neglected individuals or matched control indi-
viduals. Because of the relatively small number of sexually
abused youth in this sample, these results need to be inter-
preted with caution. The lack of significant findings for
sexual abuse survivors may be the result of inadequate sta-
tistical power. However, power is determined by sample and
effect sizes. Many studies with small samples report signifi-
cant findings because the effect is substantial. In 2 previous
studies from this sample of abused and neglected children,
individuals with childhood sexual abuse histories were at
significantly increased risk for sexually transmitted diseases
in adulthood37 and having same-sex sexual partners,38 sug-
gesting that substantial effects can be detected even with
this relatively small subset of individuals with histories of
childhood sexual abuse.
In terms of age at onset of sexual offending, we did not find
that those who had experienced childhood sexual abuse were
arrested for their first sexual offense at an earlier age than con-
trol individuals. In contrast, we found that maltreated chil-
dren in general and those who had been neglected had a higher
probability of being arrested at any age. Lastly, our results
showedthatindividualswhowerearrestedforsexcrimeswere
not likely to specialize in sex offending, regardless of maltreat-
ment status. Most of these individuals had arrests for other
types of offenses, suggesting that the sex offenses commit-
ted were part of a larger pattern of violent and antisocial be-
havior, particularly among individuals with histories of child-
hood physical abuse and neglect.
Interpreting the findings from this study should take into
account the study's limitations as well as strengths. One key
advantagewastheprospectivelongitudinalfollow-upthatper-
mitted an estimation of future risk compared with retrospec-
tive designs. Although the use of official records of child abuse
and neglect is also an advantage because of the lack of ambi-
guity about the maltreatment experience, this strategy means
that only cases of abuse and neglect that came to the atten-
tionofauthoritieswereincluded.Thesampleisweightedheav-
ilytowardthelowerendofthesocioeconomicspectrum;there-
fore, the results may not generalize to consequences of abuse
and neglect for children in middle- and upper-income fami-
lies. These findings are also not generalizable to abused and
neglected children adopted in infancy or early childhood be-
cause these cases were excluded. Furthermore, because the
sample represents children who grew up in the late 1960s and
early 1970s, this may raise concerns about the relevance of
these cases to current cases. However, the cases studied here
are quite similar to current cases being processed by the child

protection system and the courts. One difference is that these
children were not provided with extensive services or treat-
ment options as available today and, thereby, the results of this
study represent the natural history of the development of
abused and neglected children.
Another possible concern is the extent to which these chil-
dren moved out of state, making the rates reported here con-
servatively biased. However, because National Crime Infor-
mation Center records reflect arrests for crimes across the
United States and all state registries were searched, this should
mitigate against this problem. It also might be argued that of-
ficial report data underestimate actual sex offense rates be-
cause sex offenses are underreported. Although this is a con-
cern, as suggested by Carpentier et al,39 underreporting may
have less impact if data are collected across a long follow-up
period (in this case, more than 30 years). If a person was en-
gaging in sex offending, the probability that at least 1 event
would be detected increases with the more crimes commit-
ted. Relatedly, these individuals were involved in official child
protective service cases as children and often came from fami-
lies with extensive involvement with child welfare and jus-
tice systems, increasing their general risk for arrest owing to
surveillance bias.
We searched the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public
Website for information about sex offenders and found a se-
rious underestimation of the prevalence of sex offenses (a total
of 9 individuals listed on all state registries). Given such a ma-
jor discrepancy between the public registry data and official
criminal history records, our findings support previous rec-
ommendations that researchers should consider the use of the
public registry data with caution.40
Conclusions
This study represents a long-term and comprehensive assess-
ment of the extent to which sexually abused children become
sex offenders and compares them to physically abused and ne-
glected and nonmaltreated children. These findings show that
physically abused and neglected children are at increased risk
for being arrested for sex crimes and should receive effective
interventions to avert these negative consequences. These re-
sults do not provide support for the common belief that being
a survivor of childhood sexual abuse carries with it a unique
increase in the risk for becoming a sex offender, contrary to
some public policies and administrative practices of some ju-
risdictions where children may be stigmatized, placed in re-
