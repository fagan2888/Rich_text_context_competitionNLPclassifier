Abstract
We are living in an algorithmic age where mathematics and computer science are coming together in powerful new ways
to influence, shape and guide our behaviour and the governance of our societies. As these algorithmic governance
structures proliferate, it is vital that we ensure their effectiveness and legitimacy. That is, we need to ensure that they are
an effective means for achieving a legitimate policy goal that are also procedurally fair, open and unbiased. But how can
we ensure that algorithmic governance structures are both? This article shares the results of a collective intelligence
workshop that addressed exactly this question. The workshop brought together a multidisciplinary group of scholars to
consider (a) barriers to legitimate and effective algorithmic governance and (b) the research methods needed to address
the nature and impact of specific barriers. An interactive management workshop technique was used to harness the
collective intelligence of this multidisciplinary group. This method enabled participants to produce a framework and
research agenda for those who are concerned about algorithmic governance. We outline this research agenda below,
providing a detailed map of key research themes, questions and methods that our workshop felt ought to be pursued.
This builds upon existing work on research agendas for critical algorithm studies in a unique way through the method of
collective intelligence.

Introduction
We are living in an algorithmic age where mathematics
and computer science are coming together in powerful
ways to influence, shape and guide our behaviour and
the governance of our societies. With the spread of sur-
veillance technologies and the growth of the internet of
things, we are creating a vast interconnected network of
data collection devices (Greengard 2015; Kellermeit
and Obodovski, 2013). This network produces ever-
larger datasets of potentially useful information,
updated in real time (Kitchin, 2014; Mayer-
Schonberger and Cukier, 2013). No human being can

make sense of this data unassisted. Hence there is sig-
nificant reliance on algorithms to mine, parse, sort and
configure the data into useful packages. Oftentimes
these systems are maintained and tweaked by human
designers and engineers, and the information is then
utilized by humans in traditional corporate and bureau-
cratic decision-making systems. But there is also a
growing willingness to outsource decision-making
authority to algorithm-based decision-making systems.
Some even dream of creating `master algorithms' that
will be able to learn and adapt to any decision-making
situation without the need for human input or control
(Domingos, 2015).
We can refer to these converging trends by using the
label `algorithmic governance' or, perhaps more pro-
vocatively, `algocracy' (Aneesh, 2006, 2009; Danaher,
2016). Whether we like it or not, algorithms are increas-
ingly being used to nudge, bias, guide, provoke, control,
manipulate and constrain human behaviour. Sometimes
this is beneficial; sometimes benign; sometimes prob-
lematic (Danaher, 2016; Pasquale, 2015; Zarsky,
2016). To ensure that it is more the former than the
latter, an algorithmic governance system ought to be
designed and implemented in a way that ensures both
its effectiveness and its legitimacy (Peter, 2017). That is
to say, we should ensure that it is an effective means for
achieving some policy goal, whilst remaining procedur-
ally fair, open and unbiased. But how can we ensure that
algorithmic governance systems are both?
This article shares the results of a collective intelli-
gence (CI) workshop we ran at NUI Galway in March
2016 that addressed exactly this question. The work-
shop brought together a multidisciplinary group of
scholars to consider (a) barriers to legitimate and effect-
ive algorithmic governance and (b) the research meth-
ods needed to address the nature and impact of specific
barriers. An interactive management (IM) workshop
technique (Warfield and Cardenas, 1994) was used to
harness the CI of this multidisciplinary group. This
method enabled participants to produce a framework
and research agenda for those who are concerned about
algorithmic governance. We outline this research
agenda below. We start by explaining some of the back-
ground to our workshop, placing its results in the con-
text of the current literature on algorithmic governance.
We then explain the methods and results of our work-
shop. Finally, we close by offering reflections on the
research agenda proposed by the group. The proposed
agenda is then provided in Table 2.
Context: Understanding algorithmic
governance
The technological trends alluded to in the opening
paragraph are relatively recent, but they have a
deeper history. The phenomenon of algorithmic gov-
ernance is part of a longer historical trend toward the
mechanization of governance. Sociologists since the
time of Weber have highlighted ways in which the
legal-bureaucratic organization of the state is subject
to the same modernising trends as the design of indus-
trial factories (Kanter, 1991; Weber, 1947). The result is
a system of governance that is machine-like in nature:
tasks are subdivided and roles are specialized so as to
perform the business of governance as efficiently as pos-
sible. This has always depended on the collection of
data about the society and citizens to whom the
system applies (Hacking, 2006), and from the dawn of
the computer age attempts have been made to automate
some or all of the process. Key figures in the cybernetics
movement, for example, advocated the use of compu-
terized systems of data collection, processing and deci-
sion-making in social governance (Medina, 2011;
Morozov, 2014).
This does not mean that algorithmic governance is
nothing new. The systems we consider in this paper and
that we considered at our workshop are different from
their historical forebears. The differences are largely a
matter of degree and not of type. The technologies that
facilitate the automation of governance certainly build
on top of the pre-existing structures, thereby taking
advantage of previous mechanistic innovations. But
the speed, scale and ubiquity of the technologies that
make algorithmic governance possible are grander now
than they were in the past. Advances in machine learn-
ing and data collection enable the automation of pro-
cesses that previously would not have been possible.
They also enable far more efficient processing and
handling of the data. Couple that with the fact that
technologies of surveillance have become more deeply
integrated into our everyday lives, and it seems that we
are at a significant inflection point for the future of
algorithmic governance. Many scholars have started
to pay attention to this emerging reality and this has
given rise to a burgeoning academic literature on the
topic of algorithmic governance.
Our workshop aimed to contribute to and build upon
this literature. Three aspects of the literature were of
particular concern to us, specifically, the aspects focus-
ing on (a) the forms/modes of algorithmic governance,
(b) the problems of algorithmic governance and (c) the
methods for studying algorithmic governance. We
briefly describe these aspects below, noting how they
shed light on the phenomenon of algorithmic govern-
ance, and how our study tries to build upon them.
The forms of algorithmic governance
The first trend concerns the classification of different
algorithmic governance systems. Considerable work
2 Big Data & Society
has been done on identifying the key properties of the
Big Data systems that enable contemporary algorith-
mic governance. Back in 2001, Doug Laney of Gartner
proposed the now-classic `three Vs' framework for
understanding the emergence of Big Data systems.
This framework suggested that Big Data was `big' in
terms of its volume, velocity and variety. Since then,
more complex frameworks have been proposed
(Kitchin and McArdle, 2016). Kitchin, for instance,
has argued that there are at least seven dimensions to
bigness, adding exhaustivity, resolution and indexicality,
relationality and extensionality and scalability to the
three Vs (Kitchin, 2014). These elaborations are
useful insofar as they help us to grasp the properties
of Big Data and better understand the challenges and
opportunities it poses in the context of the design of
algorithmic governance systems. That said, any classi-
fication system of this sort is prone to being value-laden
and under- or over-inclusive (Kitchin and McArdle,
2016). This comment applies equally well to the other
classification systems to which we refer below, and has
implications for the definition and scope of algorithmic
governance systems.
Another aspect of the ongoing literature relates to
the classification of algorithms themselves. New algo-
rithms are designed all the time, but they typically fall
into a set of general types that have been exhaustively
categorized by computer scientists (for a basic introduc-
tion see Cormen, 2013; for a more comprehensive one,
see Cormen et al., 2009). For example, there are search-
ing and sorting algorithms that break down into sub-
types such as binary search, selection sort, insertion
sort, merge sort and quicksort. Understanding these
different types is important when it comes to assessing
the social and normative properties of algorithmic gov-
ernance systems. For instance, one of the most import-
ant high-level shifts in the design of algorithms in recent
years is the move from `top-down' algorithms (in which
a programmer or team of programmers exhaustively
defines the ruleset for the algorithm) to `bottom up'
machine-learning algorithms (in which the algorithm
is given a learning rule and trained on large datasets
in order to develop its own rules). This shift is import-
ant because the use of bottom-up algorithms creates
certain problems when it comes to the transparency
and opacity of algorithmic governance systems, par-
ticularly when such algorithms are incorporated into
already-opaque governance structures. Awareness of
this problem was part of the original motivation for
our workshop and something that was repeatedly high-
lighted by the participants. A major goal, consequently,
was to develop a research agenda that could address the
consequences of this shift.
A final aspect of the ongoing literature on the clas-
sification of algorithmic governance systems is more
explicitly evaluative in nature. It is primarily underta-
ken by ethical and legal theorists and focuses on iden-
tifying the key stages in the process of algorithmic
governance and seeing how they relate to pre-existing
governance systems. Four stages are identified by most
contributors to this literature. They are collection, pro-
cessing, utilization and feedback and learning (Citron
and Pasquale, 2014; Pasquale, 2015; Zarsky, 2013).
These stages are often said to define a governance
`loop': the system acquires information, processes it,
uses it and then feeds back on itself by learning from
what it has done (Carr, 2015; Citron and Pasquale,
2014; Zarsky, 2013). In this respect, an algorithmic gov-
ernance system functions like a quasi-intelligent and
adaptive system. From a normative perspective, one
of the key concerns is to figure out how humans are
involved in the different stages. Human participation in
and comprehension of governance is typically deemed
to be an important determinant of social and political
legitimacy. And, of course, the impact of such systems
on human behaviour is often key to their ethical and
normative evaluation. Consequently, considerable
attention has been paid to classifying systems on the
basis of the type and degree of human involvement.
Citron and Pasquale (2014), for instance, adopt a
classification system utilized in military contexts to dis-
tinguish between systems in which humans are in the
loop, on the loop or off the loop.
Identifying the problems with algorithmic
governance
Although we did not seek to add additional complexity
to these classificatory systems with our study, we found
them valuable when it came to understanding and iden-
tifying the potential shortcomings or problems in the use
of algorithmic governance systems. This is the second
major trend in the current literature and the one to
which we tried to contribute more directly. There are
many proposed benefits to algorithmic governance,
including speed, efficiency, comprehensiveness and fair-
ness (Domingos, 2015; Mayer-Schonberger and Cukier,
2013; Zarsky, 2012). But there is also a growing field of
critical algorithm studies which seeks to locate the
social, ethical, political and legal problems that may
be produced or reinforced by these systems (Gillespie
and Seaver, 2016). There is a large and well-known lit-
erature on the privacy and data protection issues asso-
ciated with the surveillance systems that underlie
algorithmic governance (Polonetsky and Tene, 2013).
There are several studies highlighting potential biases
in the collection and utilization of data (Crawford,
2013; Kraemer et al., 2011; O'Neil, 2016). There are
other studies expressing concerns about the emerging
`Big Data divide' which ensures that only large
Danaher et al. 3
institutions can realize the benefits of the data revolu-
tion (Mittelstadt and Floridi, 2016). There are many
scholars talking about the opacity and lack of transpar-
ency that might be inherent in algorithmic governance,
particularly when the governance system is driven by
machine learning (Burrell, 2016; Danaher, 2016) and
when it is protected by a network of secrecy laws pro-
tecting such algorithms (Pasquale, 2015). There are also
concerns about the inaccuracies, inefficiencies and unin-
tended consequences of these systems. All of these
problems threaten to undermine the effectiveness and
legitimacy of algorithmic governance.
Zarsky (2016) provides a taxonomy for classifying
all the problems discussed in the literature to date. He
argues that algorithmic decision-making systems have
two key properties: they are potentially opaque and can
be automated. He then argues that these two properties
give rise to a particular taxonomy of objections. This
taxonomy divides the problem space into two major
branches: (i) an efficiency branch (which covers prob-
lems arising from the inaccuracy of decisions made on
foot of algorithmic assistance); and (ii) a fairness
branch (which covers problems arising from the
unfair treatment of people under algorithmic govern-
ance systems). These branches break down into related
sub-branches (prediction problems, bad data problems,
unfair wealth transfer problems, arbitrariness problems
and so on), allowing us to map out a reasonably com-
prehensive space of problems that could arise from
algorithmic governance (see Figure 1). Being cognizant
of these potential problems could, according to Zarsky,
be a boon to future research.
While Zarsky's work on this is both helpful and
insightful, it is largely the product of his personal,
albeit highly-informed, perspective on the topic. One
of things we sought to do through our CI workshop
was to harness the insights of a group of scholars with
diverse academic, applied and industry experience in an
effort to map out a comprehensive problem space, spe-
cifically focused on barriers to legitimate and effective
algorithmic governance. We expected that the barriers
identified by our participants would complement those
identified by Zarsky but would also provide a more
disciplinarily diverse perspective on the problem
space. Furthermore, we were conscious of the fact
that Zarsky did not link his taxonomy of problems to
an explicit research agenda for overcoming barriers to
legitimate and effective algorithmic governance. This is
something we explicitly attempted through our CI
methodology.

Methods for studying algorithmic governance
This brings us to the final trend in the current literature,
one to which we also sought to contribute more dir-
ectly. This one relates to the identification of key
research questions and methods that could further
enhance our understanding of algorithmic governance
and advance the critical algorithm studies agenda.
There has been relatively little systematic work done
on this topic to date. The most concerted effort is
that of Kitchin (2017). He argues that a major goal of
critical algorithm studies should be to better under-
stand the processes through which algorithmic govern-
ance systems are designed and implemented. In
particular, he argues that attention be paid to the
`translation' problems that arise when policy goals
need to be converted into computer code. He then iden-
tifies three major challenges facing anyone who wishes
to understand these processes and six potential meth-
odological approaches for overcoming them. Each of
these methodological approaches brings with it a
number of plausible research methods. The result of
this is the framework illustrated in Table 1. Note as
you read it that the six methodological approaches do
not map directly on to the three challenges but instead
suggest a range of potentially useful research methods
that might help to overcome those challenges.
Kitchin thus provides a useful starting point and
framework for anyone wishing to do serious research
in this area. Once again, however, the framework
derives from the mind of a single scholar and is not
the product of diverse disciplinary perspectives.
Furthermore, it is not directly linked to a more compre-
hensive, categorised and coherent map of the problem
space associated with algorithmic governance. Drawing
upon the CI of a group of scholars, we hoped to provide,
via our workshop, a more diverse, innovative and com-
prehensive framework of research questions and meth-
odologies that is directly linked to a map of the problem
space. This, we believe, will help to build upon and com-
plement Kitchin's framework, and suggest ways to pro-
gress research in the area of algorithmic governance. We
now turn to the methodology of our workshop and the
results we obtained from it.
Methods ­ Collective intelligence
For our workshop, we used a CI methodology known
as `interactive management' (Warfield and Cardenas,
1994). This provided a systematic approach when
working with the participants at the workshop to iden-
tify barriers to legitimate and effective3 algorithmic
governance and to develop a research agenda that
would help to address these barriers.
IM was originally designed to assist groups in deal-
ing with complex issues (Warfield, 1976). The theoret-
ical constructs that inform IM draw from both
behavioural and cognitive sciences, with a strong
basis in general systems thinking. The IM approach
carefully delineates what are known as `content' and

Research focus
 Translation problem: How is policy converted into code?
Research challenges
 Black-boxing: Algorithms are often proprietary. They are owned and controlled by companies and governments and their precise
mechanisms are often hidden from view.
 Heterogeneity and contextual embedding: Algorithms are often created by large teams, assembled from pre-existing packages of code
and embedded into complex networks of other algorithms.
 Ontogenetic and performative: Algorithms are not static and unchanging. They are often modified and adapted in response to user
interactions; they develop and change in uncontrollable and unpredictable ways.
Methodological approaches and methods
 Examining code: Deconstruct code by sifting through documentation, map out algorithm genealogies, examine how the same task is
translated into separate coding languages and run across different platforms.
 Reflexively producing code: The auto-ethnographic method, i.e. reflect on how you would convert the problem into a ruleset and
associated code.
 Reverse engineering: Select dummy data and see what is outputted under various scenarios (e.g. testing Google's Pagerank or
Facebook's Edgerank), follow debates among users, interview those who try to game algorithmic systems and so on.
 Interviews and ethnographies of coders: Carefully observing and interviewing members of coding teams as they construct an algo-
rithm.
 Unpacking the socio-technical assemblage: i.e. discursive analysis of company documents, industry material, procurement tenders,
legal standards and frameworks.
 Studying real world effects: Conducting user experiments, user interviews and/or ethnographies and otherwise exploring the social
effects of algorithms.

`process' roles, assigning to participants to the work-
shop responsibility for contributing content ideas, and
to the facilitator of the workshop responsibility for
choosing and implementing selected processes, specific-
ally, methodologies for generating, clarifying, structur-
ing, interpreting and amending ideas. In an IM
workshop, emphasis is given to balancing behavioural
and technical demands of group work (Broome and
Chen, 1992) while honouring design laws concerning
variety, parsimony and saliency (Ashby, 1958;
Boulding, 1966; Miller, 1956). IM has been applied in
a variety of situations to accomplish many different
goals, including developing instructional units (Sato,
1979), designing a national agenda for paediatric nur-
sing (Feeg, 1988), creating computer-based information
systems for organizations (Keever, 1989), assisting city
councils in making budget cuts (Coke and Moore,
1981), improving the US Department of Defense's
acquisition process (Alberts, 1992), promoting world
peace (Christakis, 1987), improving Tribal governance
process in Native American communities (Broome,
1995) and training facilitators (Broome and Fulbright,
1995). IM has also been recently used in a variety of
basic science applications, for example, to design a
national well-being measurement system (Hogan
et al., 2015b), to understand the adaptive functions of
music listening (Groarke and Hogan, 2015), critical
thinking skills (Dwyer et al., 2014) and entrepreneurial
competencies (Rezaei Zadeh et al., 2016).4
In a typical IM session, a group of participants
who are knowledgeable about a particular situation
(a) develop an understanding of a situation they
face, (b) establish a collective basis for thinking
about their future in relation to that situation and
(c) produce a framework for effective action. IM util-
izes a set of group methodologies, matched to the dif-
ferent phases of group interaction and the
requirements of the situation. These include the nom-
inal group technique (NGT), ideawriting, interpretive
structural modelling and field and profile representa-
tions. The first two methodologies are used for gener-
ating ideas that are then structured using one or more
of the latter three methodologies. Our workshop used
a combination of NGT, ideawriting and field represen-
tations (see `The process' section). To our knowledge
this represents the first application of IM to examine
barriers to legitimate and effective algorithmic govern-
ance and research that would help to address these
barriers.
Participants
A total of 15 participants (10 men, 5 women) from
diverse academic and industry backgrounds were
invited to attend a CI workshop as part of an
Algorithmic Governance conference at NUI Galway.
All expenses relating to the event, including travel
and accommodation, were funded by the Whitaker
Institute at NUI Galway and the Irish Research
Council. Participation was on an invitation-only
basis. Participants were selected by the first and
fourth authors. They were selected on the basis of
their research interests and expertise, with a view to
securing a reasonably diverse set of disciplinary back-
grounds, and to achieving some reasonable balance rep-
resentation from both genders. We did not succeed in
achieving ideal balance in the latter regard but did suc-
ceed in achieving a minimal target of one-third female
participants. More participants were invited (20) than
could attend and participate (15), and two of the par-
ticipants were self-selecting (we advertised the event
within our own institution and to the colleagues of
other invited participants and asked that people who
were interested express their interest via email before
receiving an invitation to attend). The backgrounds of
the participants included computer science, law, library
science, philosophy, geography, psychology, data sci-
ence, political science and information systems. One
of the participants was a former elected official, and
several had some previous experience in the civil ser-
vice. Three of the participants had a background in
computer programming and had worked in industry.
One of the participants was at the time employed by
a company with a commercial interest in the technol-
ogy, but this was declared and it was made clear that he
was participating on a personal not a commercial basis.
All participants were informed about the study proced-
ure and gave their informed consent.
There are questions to be asked regarding the repre-
sentativeness of the group. We sought participants on
the basis of their academic and technical expertise
rather than on the basis of other criteria. We reflect
on some of the issues this may raise for the results of
the workshop in the concluding section.
The process
There were four steps involved in the IM process: (1)
participants were asked to generate and clarify barriers
to legitimate and effective algorithmic governance using
a modified NGT method, (2) the facilitators categorised
these barriers to create a field representation of barriers,
(3) the participants engaged in multiple rounds of idea-
writing and group discussion to generate and clarify
research options in response to barriers, (4) the result-
ing idea-writing sheets were transcribed and analysed to
synthesise research options for a proposed research
agenda.
The nominal group technique (NGT; Delbeq et al.,
1975) is a method that allows individual ideas to be
6 Big Data & Society
pooled. A modified version of the standard face-to-face
NGT method was used in the current study, with an
initial pool of ideas gathered via email. The NGT
method involved four steps: (a) participants were pre-
sented with a context statement and stimulus question
(the question was `what are the barriers to legitimate
and effective algorithmic governance?') via email; (b)
the participants generated five responses to this stimu-
lus question by working alone and then sent their
responses to the facilitators via email; (c) the facilitators
recorded these ideas for posting on the walls surround-
ing the group at the workshop; (d) the participants
engaged in a serial discussion of the listed ideas for
the sole purpose of clarifying their meaning (during
the first hour of the workshop).
The field representations were generated in advance
of the face-to-face meeting and workshop with partici-
pants using the paired comparison method (Rezaei
Zadeh et al., 2016) to compare barriers in pairs and
identify categories of related barriers. Category labels
were generated after related ideas had been grouped,
with three interdependent coders working together to
categorise a total of 57 ideas.
The ideawriting method (Paulus and Yang, 2000)
was then used by participants to propose research
ideas, along with stated methods and methodologies,
which could facilitate understanding and help to
address barriers to legitimate and effective algorithmic
governance. Group members wrote their ideas on
sheets of paper and exchanged them across an idea
table, silently reading one another's ideas and adding
to the idea set, prior to group discussion on the full set
of ideas, and round-robin presentation of ideas to the
facilitation team. Two trained IM facilitators facilitated
the ideawriting session, which lasted for 2 hours.
Results ­ Barriers, research questions
and research methods
Participants identified 12 major categories of barriers to
effective and legitimate algorithmic governance (see
Figure 2), and an additional challenge posed by the
interdisciplinary nature of the topic. They also identi-
fied a wide range of research themes (see Figure 3) and
methods (see Figure 4) that could be used to address
those barriers. What follows is a description of all 13
barriers along with the set of research questions and
methods participants proposed to address and over-
come these barriers. This constitutes the research
agenda proposed by the workshop.
Opacity of algorithms
One major concern that has emerged in the literature
about algorithmic governance is the actual and
potential opacity of such systems. The participants
agreed that this is a problem, highlighting in particular
how the lack of public and governmental understand-
ing worked alongside intrinsic and manufactured opa-
city in the construction of algorithmic governance
structures.
To address these problems, participants suggested
that we try to get a better understanding of how algo-
rithmic systems work: how they are coded and how they
can be de-coded. Several research methods were recom-
mended. Some participants suggested that we study
coders as they programme and develop algorithms `in
real time', for example by following the coding process
through live video-streaming services such as Periscope,
or by `crashing' (i.e. attending and observing) hacka-
thons. Others recommended forensic analysis and
ethnographic case studies to develop an understanding
of how systems are developed, with a particular focus on
how machine learning systems develop rulesets that end
up being used in decision-making systems. Participants
also recommended that we map out the stakeholder
understanding of algorithmic systems, paying particular
attention to the gap between public and expert under-
standing of how these systems work. This could be
achieved through a combination of methods, including
surveys, case studies, citizen science approaches, inter-
views and visual qualitative methods that graph what
algorithmic systems `look like' to affected communities.
Participants recommended that we study more closely
how these systems are used in governance and the
impact they have on targeted communities and social
groups. Again, interviews, ethnographic studies, com-
parative analysis and longitudinal studies were sug-
gested as appropriate methods for this. Finally, one
participant suggested that we develop an index of algo-
rithmic transparency that could be used to scrutinize
and assist in the development of algorithmic governance
systems. The index could be modelled on similar indexes
for political transparency developed by Transparency
International and developed in partnership with such
an organisation.
Techno-utopianism
Another barrier raised by participants concerned nai¨ve
techno-optimism or utopianism among politicians and
technological stakeholders. This could lead them to
rush into the widespread adoption of algorithmic gov-
ernance systems without properly reflecting on their
potential biases and negative effects. In addressing
this barrier, participants felt there was a need to
assess how widespread such techno-utopianism was
and clarify its causes. The use of discussion groups
and observational studies was identified as a way to
map current attitudes toward these technologies.
Danaher et al. 7
Figure 2. Categories of barriers to legitimate and effective algorithmic governance, including sample barrier statements.
8 Big Data & Society
One participant suggested that we analyse speeches
made by politicians and other key decision-makers to
see how frequently they take-up `popular science' ideas
in their discussions of the technology. Careful analysis of
cultural depictions and representations of the technolo-
gies was also suggested as being important when it came
to understanding causes and origins of techno-utopian-
ism. Participants felt it was important to understand the
long-term effects of techno-utopianism with one person
suggesting that a longitudinal corpus analysis could be
used to map changes in emotional attitudes toward the
technology over time. Observational and comparative
case studies of coders, developers and relevant govern-
ment agencies during the design and implementation of
algorithmic governance systems was also suggested as a
way to identify the limitations and biases that might
result from techno-utopianism. In addition to this, par-
ticipants felt we should explore various ways in which to
raise awareness of techno-utopianism, perhaps through
the use of video games and comics. In reflecting on these
suggestions after the workshop, we would suggest that in
order for these research methodologies to be effective,
researchers would need a definition and clear measure of
`techno-utopianism'.

Techno-pessimism
Contrasting with the previous barrier, several of our par-
ticipants suggested that pessimism regarding advances
in technology could be a barrier to effective and legitim-
ate algorithmic governance. They proposed several lines
of research to understand more about such techno-
pessimism. They identified a need to form a common
understanding of what constitutes techno-pessimism,
when it may be justified, and under what conditions it
applies to one specific technology or towards technology
in general. Participants suggested that we look at
whether harms due to the proliferation of technological
devices in young peoples' lives are evident. This could
shed light on whether generalised techno-pessimism is
justified. Investigations into the possible harms that
algorithmic governance presents, such as defamation
and damage to credit were also suggested when examin-
ing a more narrow type of techno-pessimism. Another
suggestion was to examine analogous historical experi-
ences of techno-pessimism in governance.
Following the development of a coherent definition
of techno-pessimism, participants suggested that
investigations into the prevalence of techno-pessimism,
particularly amongst regulators, would be appropriate.
This would require the development and validation
of measures of techno-pessimism. The development of
such measures would facilitate two further lines of
research suggested by our participants, one of which
would focus on the cause of techno-pessimism and
the other on its effects. Participants mentioned specific
causes of techno-pessimism that might warrant investi-
gation. These were: negative experiences of technology,
data protection hype, lack of knowledge, age effects,
level of political engagement and the speed of release
of technologies. Participants also mentioned possible
effects of techno-pessimism which might warrant inves-
tigation, including the possible disadvantaging of cer-
tain sectors of society due to their fear of technology.
Both quantitative and qualitative methodologies were
proposed as suitable for progressing these lines of
research, although a broader range of qualitative meth-
odologies were suggested including interviews, case stu-
dies, focus groups and observational methods. Surveys
and experiments were proposed as possible quantitative
approaches.

Technological uncertainty
The apparent uncertainty regarding the effects of
technological development was seen as a significant
barrier to effective and legitimate algorithmic govern-
ance. Participants thought that the uncertainty had
both subjective and objective dimensions.
On the objective side, it was suggested that, in gen-
eral, we have a poor understanding of the contingent
ways in which technology develops. This was linked in
our participant discussions to the experimental and eth-
ically uncertain nature of all new technologies.
Proposed research strategies included investigating the
effects of technological development from both a his-
torical and ethical standpoint. The historical approach
was seen as useful for examining the unintended conse-
quences of new information systems, and for mapping
the dynamic evolution of technology. One suggestion
was to acquire all documents on a completed algorith-
mic governance system using a Freedom of
Information request in order to examine how that
system changed from development to implementation.
On the subjective side, technological uncertainty was
seen as a matter of perception, caused by either a lack
of technological understanding or lack of interest
among the public and policy-makers. Participants sug-
gested that our research strategies focus on ascertaining
the extent of such uncertainty and its causes. They felt
that research could be done to see how best to address it
through interviews, focus groups and awareness-raising
projects. Participants also felt that the lack of clarity
regarding the contribution of government officials to
algorithm development in the public sector was a
significant source of technological uncertainty. This
suggested there was a need to investigate how major
e-government systems are developed and it was sug-
gested that this could be done using ethnographic meth-
ods. Another suggested line of research in this vein was
the investigation of how policy-makers work with
experts and how governments ensure that specific
expertise is factored into algorithmic decision-making.
Capacity/Knowledge among technologists
Technical experts wield a lot power when it comes to
the design of effective and legitimate governance sys-
tems, but several of our participants worried that tech-
nical experts lack knowledge of the legal (and other)
governance systems with which they interact. They
also worried that such experts might be unaware of
their own implicit biases and how they affect the
coding process, and might be hostile to outsiders who
lack their technical expertise.
To address these barriers, participants suggested that
we get a clearer sense of the attitudes of programmers
towards themselves, their work and those outside their
discipline. In particular, they felt that researchers
should figure out the extent to which technologists are
developing their own internal culture and groupthink,
the extent to which they resist critical outside perspec-
tives, and their overall awareness of implicit biases.
Developing this understanding could be achieved
through case studies, surveys and interviews.
Furthermore, since attitudes toward, and awareness
of, law was a particular concern, our participants felt
that research should focus on legal knowledge and reac-
tions to law among technologists. This could include
tests of legal knowledge, analysis of the extent to
which programmers incorporate legal changes into
their code, and the extent to which coders try to
defend themselves from litigation in their coding deci-
sions. Surveys, case studies and interviews were again
suggested as the preferable methods. Finally, several
participants recommended that we examine the educa-
tional background of technologists and consider the
benefits of a broad life-long learning model for
technologists.
Capacity among public servants and
representatives
In a similar vein, several of our participants were con-
cerned that a lack of competence amongst politicians
and public sector workers could be a barrier to effective
and legitimate algorithmic governance. The concerns
varied from questions about mathematical abilities
among politicians, to questions about procurement
and information systems-capacities in public sector
organisations. To research these barriers, participants
suggested, in the first place, that we have some clear
sense of the definitions of `capacity' and `competence'
in the public service context. Clarity could be achieved
by recruiting focus groups of public service workers to
cluster and refine definitions. Understanding the extent
of the capacity problem in the public sector was also
deemed to be an important research priority.
Participants said that research should focus on identify-
ing the levels of competence needed by key decision-
makers. This could be achieved through historical
case studies of public sector organisations, qualitative
and narrative interviews with key actors, interviews and
focus groups analysing understandings of uncertainty,
and comparative studies of different government agen-
cies and private sector workers. Getting a better handle
on politicians' competencies with mathematical reason-
ing and information systems was also deemed to be key
research strategy. Finally, participants recommended
that research should focus on how problems with com-
petence arise and get managed within the public sector.
In particular, they suggested that studies be conducted
Danaher et al. 11
on who gets recruited to the public sector, who gets
decision-making authority, what is the relationship
between the public and private sector, and how are
people held to account when things go wrong. A
number of methods were recommended in this regard,
including actor-network theory methods, to map out
relationships between individuals and social organisa-
tions, comparative and cross country analysis of gradu-
ate destinations, freedom of information requests to
collate relevant information, and detailed case studies.
Capacity among lawyers and legal systems
If algorithmic governance is something that is ultim-
ately made possible and held to account through law,
then it is important to understand the capacity of legal
systems and legal actors to manage it. Our participants
were sensitive to this need, with several expressing con-
cerns about the training of lawyers, the inflexible and
conservative nature of legal codes, and the possibility of
regulatory gaps opening up which prevent people from
challenging the negative outcomes of algorithmic gov-
ernance. To overcome these barriers, participants sug-
gested that we survey the extent to which legal
problems are already arising from algorithmic govern-
ance systems. This could be achieved by literature
reviews and interviews with key legal figures (e.g. pros-
ecutors or regulators). The creative exploration of pos-
sible legal problems was also recommended, with one
participant suggesting that this could be achieved
through experimental moot courts (mock trials).
Participants also suggested that we identify capacity-
related problems by analysing existing code and cate-
gorizing errors that emerge from this code according to
whether they are `technical' or `legal' in nature. This
could be enabled through case studies that combine
interviews with document analysis.
Legal and institutional complexity
Complexity and a lack of transparency about algo-
rithms are often deemed to be barriers to legitimate
governance. Our participants expressed some concerns
about how complexity in legal-bureaucratic systems
that implement algorithmic governance systems could
contribute to these problems. Several distinct worries
were expressed. Some participants worried about the
complexity of bureaucratic systems in themselves;
some worried about the increased complexity resulting
from the use of ICT within those systems; and some
worried about the ways in which laws contribute to the
lack of transparency associated with algorithmic gov-
ernance systems. Participants recommended that
research be undertaken to address each of these three
concerns. Some participants suggested that we
investigate previous and existing complexities in bur-
eaucratic systems, using historical case studies, visual
cartographies of the relationships between different
organisations, process tracing, and comparative stu-
dies. One participant suggested that we take advantage
of our experience with existing regulatory regimes that
require the collection and tracking of environmental
information and conduct a detailed study of how insti-
tutions respond to regulatory change. Others suggested
that we focus on how ICT is adopted and deployed
within bureaucratic systems. This could be done by
comparing use of proprietary and open source systems
in data-management, and by conducting a mental
model analysis of key stakeholders that compare how
they think ICT systems work with their actual oper-
ation. Finally, one participant recommended that we
investigate the way in which algorithmic governance
systems are described and framed in legal cases invol-
ving privacy and data protection issues. There are many
cases on these issues already and they provide insight
into how legal systems might cope with algorithmic
governance more generally.
Commercial and public interests
The lack of balance between private profit-driven inter-
ests and public socially-driven interests was seen as
another significant barrier. One participant noted that
this lack of balance has led to a gap between the pace of
the commercial development of algorithmic decision-
making systems and the more limited applications in
the public sector. The participant suggested that
people in the private sector were reluctant to slow
development in order to ensure effectiveness, as this
would curb commercial success. Underlying this con-
cern is the broader conflict between the values and
goals of private and public bodies, which another par-
ticipant said was not sufficiently acknowledged. They
gave the example of the lack of regulation put in place
following the privatisation of sensitive areas such as
healthcare. A number of research strategies for investi-
gating both the balance between commercial and public
interests and the balance between commercial and indi-
vidual interests were recommended. Regarding the
former, participants suggested that the differences in
perspective between government IT departments and
private sector contractors should be explored through
content analysis of e-government policy documents and
the brochures and websites of vendors. This could help
inform the development of a model of the goals and
values of private and public actors. Regarding the bal-
ance between commercial interests and individual
rights, participants recommended that we explore cur-
rent attitudes and perspectives toward algorithmic gov-
ernance and regulation, and raise awareness of
12 Big Data & Society
algorithmic governance. Participants identified a
number of secondary data methods that could advance
this research strategy. These included case studies and
traditional legal and economic analysis research meth-
ods. Participants also identified a number of primary
data methods, including public consultation, inter-
views, focus groups and surveys. The final research
strategy recommended by participants in relation to
this barrier was to examine the effects that a greater
focus on privacy might have on the legitimacy and
effectiveness of algorithmic governance. Participants
suggested that the practice of `privacy by design' be
researched, and potentially followed up by awareness-
raising training in commercial settings. Case studies of
data overload could also be used to shed light on
whether more data is always better. Furthermore,
methods from economics could establish whether
there are benefits to more discerning data collection.
Effective governance versus individual rights
Participants felt that, in considering the development of
algorithmic decision-making technologies, care must be
taken to ensure that a focus is maintained on individual
rights and fair treatment, rather than solely on effective
governance. For example, participants suggested that
we prioritise research into the ways in which inequality
and bias can be embedded in algorithms. A number of
case studies already exist looking at this and it was felt
that more should be undertaken. Participants also sug-
gested that a key research priority was to examine the
competition between efficiency and fairness in govern-
ance by surveying the public about their conception of
effective governance. This could be combined with an
investigation of into how technology can be employed
to enhance government transparency and citizen par-
ticipation. This strategy was suggested in response to
the perceived apathy towards participative governance
practices among political leaders. One participant felt
that research into smart cities and their potential to
enable participative governance would be a useful con-
tribution to this research agenda. The piloting of block-
chain technology as an alternative governance
mechanism was also suggested as a means of increasing
transparency and participation.
Ethical awareness (or lack thereof)
In relation to ethical awareness, participants high-
lighted inadequate consideration of ethical concerns
with algorithms and failure to integrate deep social
and ethical thinking into technology education as sig-
nificant barriers. They also highlighted the lack of
awareness of ethical implications of apparently neutral
algorithms and the failure to recognize the political
ethical dimensions of Big Data. In response to these
barriers, participants suggested that it would be import-
ant to examine current levels of awareness and know-
ledge of ethical issues in the area of algorithmic
governance among coders, politicians and the public.
They highlighted the value of historical analyses and
case study analyses in shedding light on how under-
standing of ethical issues developed in analogous
domains (e.g. the development of medical ethics in
the field of medicine) and how analysis of specific
cases of algorithmic governance can shed light on key
ethical issues in political decision-making. Participants
also highlighted the importance of directly analysing
the ethical consequences of algorithmic governance,
for example, in areas such as predictive policing and
profiling, where there is potential to perpetuate ethnic
bias and social dynamics within communities. Related
to this is the need for an analysis of the language of
politics and Big Data studies, and how ethics are
reflected in the language of agency, depoliticisation,
and hegemony; and how political bias might be
reflected in Big Data decisions. Analyses of ethical
frameworks and existing codes of practice used in
both technology education and Big Data applications
was also seen as important, alongside an analysis of the
ethical decision-making practices of data scientists and
the ethical deliberation of politicians. From a techno-
logical point of view, participants proposed that we
analyse the extent to which ethical development can
be incorporated into machine learning. Participants
also recommended some applied research goals, such
as trying to write an open-source charter of algorithmic
ethics and to investigate how research ethics commit-
tees are currently handling algorithms.
Privacy and informed consent
In relation to privacy and informed consent, partici-
pants highlighted inadequate privacy protections, fail-
ure to adequately protect human rights, dissonance
between algorithmic systems and regulatory/legislative
frameworks, conflict between the private and public
interests, and failure to fully inform the citizenry of
the multiple and myriad uses of their data as barriers.
In response to these barriers, participants highlighted
the importance of exploring the public's understanding
of informed consent, their knowledge of the uses of
their data and the uses of algorithms using surveys,
interviews, vignette studies and laboratory studies.
They also proposed case studies and survey studies
designed to examine public attitudes toward conveni-
ence versus protection of rights (i.e. how willing are
people to sacrifice privacy rights in return for cheaper
and more effective services?). They highlighted the need
to review the literature on privacy as defined in law and
Danaher et al. 13
the need to adopt cross-discipline studies that compare
standards of consent in different legal fields.
The challenge of interdisciplinarity
The landscape of interdependent barriers outlined
above, and the range and scope of research needed to
understand and overcome those barriers highlighted, to
all participants, the need for interdisciplinary cooper-
ation. This was felt by most to be a generic challenge,
present in many cross-disciplinary fields of research,
but one that should not be ignored. Participants
noted a range of issues that may have a negative
effect on progress in this regard, including the dismissal
of different perspectives in the field, a continuing know-
ledge gap and the lack of shared perspectives between
technologists and others, which results in the under-
theorised nature of both approaches to algorithmic
governance. Participants highlighted a separation
between domain-level experts and developers that led
to systems that fail to match ethical and legal require-
ments. They noted that inadequate communication and
lack of common language and cause among academics,
policy makers and private sector actors, and lack of
opportunities for deep multidisciplinary engagement,
were also barriers to effective and legitimate algorith-
mic governance. In response, participants highlighted
the value of survey, interview and ethnographic studies
exploring competing attitudes of technologists and
social scientists and the language used by different dis-
ciplines to describe similar phenomena. They proposed
research focused on the nature of successful collabor-
ation, and case study, document, and interview analysis
of existing multidisciplinary projects and the iterative
collaborative development of understanding. They
highlighted the need for a review of available curricula,
and interviews and surveys of students and teaching
professionals to examine the form of training under-
taken in different disciplines and how different educa-
tional practices may perpetuate difficulties associated
with interdisciplinary communication. Participants
highlighted the potential to theorize and establish a
common approach to multiperspectivalism using col-
laborative writing methodologies. They also proposed
the establishment of new networks of cross-disciplinary
researchers who can work together to overcome inter-
disciplinary challenges and advance understand of
effective and legitimate algorithmic governance.
Conclusion: Mapping the research
agenda
We present the full map of barriers, research questions
and research methods/strategies that was produced
through our CI workshop in Table 2. We want to con-
clude by explaining the contribution we believe this
map makes to the existing literature on algorithmic
governance, highlighting the limitations of what we
did, and identifying ways in which the research
agenda we produced could be developed and enhanced
in the future.
We can explain the contribution most easily by com-
paring what the workshop produced with the existing
frameworks we discussed in `Context: Understanding
algorithmic governance' section. Consider, for instance,
the frameworks that have been put forward by Zarsky
(Figure 1) and Kitchin (Table 1). Zarsky's was a tax-
onomy of the problems that arise from the use of algo-
rithmic governance systems. This taxonomy focused on
two major categories of problems (efficiency and fair-
ness), and broke those down into a series of sub-pro-
blems. The barriers identified in our CI workshop
covered much of the same territory, with participants
also highlighting specific concerns about inefficiencies,
biases, lack of transparency and unfairness in the
implementation of these systems. But the participants
went much further than Zarsky, highlighting how the
efficiency and fairness problems were connected to
other problems in education, public understanding,
technical competence, recruitment, institutional com-
plexity, gaps in legal standards and more. The result
is a much richer understanding of the problem space
involved in this debate. On top of this, our participants
linked these problems to specific research questions and
methodologies and thus identified ways in which we
might better understand these problems and contribute
to their solution.
Something similar is true when we compare the
results of our workshop with the research framework
proposed by Kitchin. Where he highlighted one major
focus, three research challenges, and six research stra-
tegies, our participants identified 12 major barriers to
effective and legitimate governance and an additional
challenge relating to multidisciplinary study, at least
48 distinct research questions, and 65 research applica-
tions. There is, consequently, a different level of com-
prehensiveness and breadth to the results of our
workshop than is currently found in the literature. To
be sure, our participants identified similar challenges
and methods to Kitchin, but their collective efforts pro-
duced a more fine-grained analysis of the challenges,
and a more complete mapping of the research that
needs to be done to address each of these challenges.
On top of this, we think they hit upon some interesting
and novel research methods, including the use of live-
streaming video to study coders as they code, partner-
ing with political transparency organizations to create
measures of algorithmic transparency, the construction
14 Big Data & Society
of visual cartographies and the use of actor-network
theory to better understand institutional and legal com-
plexity, among many other proposed methods.
Of course there are limitations to what we produced.
It is important that anyone proposing to use our
agenda is aware of that. One obvious limitation con-
cerns the representativeness of the group involved. The
research agenda we developed was the product of a
particular group of people, working together over a
particular period of time. There is no doubt that
important perspectives were missing from what we
did. As we mentioned in the `Context: Understanding
algorithmic governance' section, the participants were
invited on the basis of academic and technical expertise
and interest. Only one of the 15 was currently
employed in industry, the remaining 14 were all cur-
rently employed in academic institutions. Some of
those currently employed in academia had back-
grounds in industry and government, and this was
one of the selection criteria, but their current form of
employment no doubt limited their perspective on the
issue. On top of this, although there was some attempt
to achieve disciplinary and gender diversity, other
forms of representativeness were not sought. As the
current research literature and our research agenda
itself suggests, algorithmic governance systems may
embed certain forms of bias and may disproportion-
ately affect members of minority groups (ethnic,
racial, sexual, disability-related, etc.). While some of
our participants may belong to such groups, we did
not select them for that reason and hence the absence
of a more explicit recognition and engagement with
minority perspectives means that there could well be
gaps in what we have produced. We would defend
the appropriateness of our academic-oriented selection
criteria given that our aim was to produce a research
agenda that would be useful to academic researchers,
but there is certainly room for others to repeat the
exercise with different groups and compare the results
with what we have produced.5
Allied to this, the fact that the research agenda was
produced by a particular group on a particular day
means that our participants will undoubtedly have
overlooked or ignored other possible research questions
and methods. More work needs to be done to add-in
the missing perspectives and fill-in the gaps, perhaps by
reconciling and cohering our agenda with those already
provided. A particular concern in this regard, and one
raised by several of the reviewers on this paper, was the
apparent absence of more critical/radical perspectives
on the topic of algorithmic governance from our
research agenda. It is worth noting that such perspec-
tives are not entirely absent from what has been pro-
duced. The barriers originally identified by the
participants consisted in statements/propositions,
which we then grouped together and reduced to
simple descriptive labels (such as `opacity', `techno-
pessimism, `public vs. private interests' and so on).
Several of these statements6 ­ particularly those relating
to techno-utopianism, inequality vs. rights, and public
vs. private interests ­ were quite explicitly radical/crit-
ical in their focus, challenging the more mainstream
liberal political focus adopted by others. These state-
ments were displayed to all participants on the day of
the workshop on the walls of the room in which the
session took place. Furthermore, the workshop itself
took place after a more traditional academic conference
consisting of short paper presentations. Several of these
papers adopted a more radical and critical perspective
on the topic and those perspectives continued to be
discussed in the workshop session itself.7 The research
agenda we have produced (see Table 2) may seem to be
shorn of those perspectives, but we would argue that
this is not necessarily the case. We have reduced the
discussions and conversations from the day to a series
of reasonably concrete research questions and methods.
We would argue that several of these questions and
methods are open to those who wish to pursue a
more radical/critical research agenda. That said, we cer-
tainly acknowledge that the way in which we framed
the workshop (asking participants to focus on the ques-
tions of legitimacy and effectiveness) had a mainstream
liberal/political orientation. We encouraged partici-
pants not to take this framing for granted in their con-
tributions, but this could have affected the results we
produced. We also acknowledge that we tried to facili-
tate dialogue at the workshop that represented the full
range of perspectives of participants, including those
that were negative or critical of the possibilities for
algorithmic governance.8
Despite these limitations, we would argue that by
harnessing the power of CI, we have produced the
most comprehensive mapping of the research agenda
to date ­ something that researchers can begin to use
and develop right now. But no research agenda is ever
complete and final. They are and should be subject
to critique, iterative change and development. Future
CI workshops of this sort could be used to facilitate
further interdisciplinary collaborations on this import-
ant topic, perhaps by trying to represent different
groups in the conversation and discussion. This is
likely to be made necessary anyway by the fluid and
rapidly-changing nature of the technologies underlying
algorithmic governance structures. Nevertheless, we
think the methodology we adopted to produce this
research agenda, and the agenda that was actually pro-
duced, provide a firm platform on which future
researchers can build.

2. This table was created by the lead author based on the
discussion in Kitchin (2017). It does not appear in
Kitchin's original paper.
3. We focused on the concepts of `legitimacy' and `effective-
ness' due to the fact that (a) they seemed sufficiently cap-
acious to cover a number of concerns one might have
about this technology, (b) were similar to concepts used
in the pre-existing literature on the problems of algorith-
mic governance (e.g. Danaher, 2016; Zarsky, 2016) and (c)
were broadly acceptable within mainstream liberal-demo-
cratic theory (Peter, 2017). We were conscious, however,
that focusing the inquiry on these two concepts could bias/
narrow the results of our study since they may be thought
to exclude more radical and critical theoretical perspectives
on algorithmic governance. To overcome this problem we
encouraged participants in our workshop to feel free to
question the conceptual framework that we used. We
reflect on our successes and failures in this regard in the
concluding section.
4. Groupwork methodologies have their problems. For
example, the different processes used by a group to gener-
ate, critique and refine an idea set can lead to excessively
convergent thinking and be excessively reliant on common
knowledge (and hence not on the knowledge provided by
the unique individual perspectives that are present in the
group). We were conscious of these issues in the design of
our workshop and the IM techniques we used (NGT, idea-
writing, field representations) have been designed to over-
come some of the common pitfalls of groupwork. For a
longer discussion of the problems with groupwork and the
techniques that can be used to address them, we recom-
mend that the reader consult some of the second author's
previously published work (Hogan et al., 2014, 2015a), as
well as the very comprehensive discussion in Straus et al.
(2009).
5. As one of our reviewers pointed out, there are issues even
within academia concerning the representativeness of our
group. After all, not everyone has the time to travel to
attend and participate in a workshop of this sort. We
tried to mitigate against this to some extent by ensuring
that the event took place outside of teaching time (for the
Irish participants) and during the ordinary working day.
Just over a third of the participants were locally-based (i.e.
attending an event that took place at their ordinary place
of employment) so they should not have faced any greater
difficulties in attending than they would ordinarily have
faced in attending work. For those travelling from other
institutions, difficulties in taking time out to attend would
certainly be a greater issue and was the stated reason for
most of the rejected invitations.
6. These statements are on file with the authors.
7. Approximately half of the papers were published in an
abbreviated form in the September/October 2016 edition
of the journal Computers and Law. The more radical/crit-
ical perspective is on display in at least one of these pub-
lished papers: Morison `Algorithmic Governmentality:
Techno-Optimism and the Move to the Dark Side' ­ avail-
able at https://www.scl.org/articles/3714-algorithmic-gov-
ernmentality-techo-optimism-and-the-move-towards-the-
dark-side
8. Another issue, as one of the reviewers to the paper pointed
out, has to do with the `algorithmic' nature of the collect-
ive intelligence method. It might seem ironic and odd that
we have used a quasi-algorithmic method for producing a
research agenda about algorithmic governance. We appre-
ciate this irony. But we think there are broad (any rule-
following process) and narrow (a computerized, auto-
mated rule-following system) interpretations of what it
means for something to be `algorithmic'. Our research
method was algorithmic in a broad sense, but we are not
sure that it is algorithmic in the narrow sense and the
narrow sense is the one covered by the proposed research
agenda. Nevertheless, there is an interesting `meta'
research question to be posed about the method and
whether it compounds or alleviates concerns about algo-
rithmic (in the narrow sense) governance.
