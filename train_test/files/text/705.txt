Employment-Based Health
Insurance For Children:
Why Did Coverage Increase
In The Mid-1990s?
While the strong economy has done little to bring down the overall number
of uninsured persons, it appears to have improved the outlook for children.
by Paul Fronstin
Between 1994 and 1997 the percent-
age of children covered by an employ-
ment-based health plan increased from
58.1 percent to 59.7 percent, after years of a
steady erosion in coverage (Exhibit 1).1 As a
result of the increase in the percentage of chil-
dren with employment-based coverage and
population growth, 1.8 million more children
were covered by an employment-based health
plan in 1997 than in 1994.2 The percentage of
adults, both working and nonworking, cov-
ered by an employment-based health plan re-
mained virtually constant over this period.
The increase in the percentage of children
with employment-based coverage is impor-
tant to understand, for a number of reasons.
First, policymakers and others have been puz-
zled by the overall increase in the number of
uninsured persons during the recent period of
strong U.S. economic growth. For example, a
recent study found that fewer small employ-
ers offered health benefits in 1998 than in 1996
but was unable to explain why offer rates
have fallen.3 This paper presents evidence that
the strong economy is having a positive effect
on health insurance coverage for children.
Second, the increase in employment-based
coverage of children has a number of implica-
tions for policy, including its impact on the
State Children's Health Insurance Program
(CHIP). The increase will affect future enroll-
ment in the CHIP program and ultimately ex-
penditures on the program. In addition, the
potential that CHIP coverage has to "crowd
out" employment-based health insurance cov-
erage may become much smaller as more chil-
dren obtain employment-based coverage.
The increase in employer coverage also has
implications for the Medicaid program. Since
1993 the percentage of children covered by the
program has been declining, despite expan-
sions to the program beginning in 1990. Fewer
children are eligible for Medicaid because
more parents became employed on a full-time,
full-year basis; family income increased; and
the likelihood of being covered by an employ-
ment-based health plan increased between
1994 and 1997. As long as the economy re-
mains strong, we can expect a continued in-
crease in the percentage of children with em-
ployment-based health insurance coverage,
which will reduce reliance on the Medicaid
program and reduce the portion of federal and
state budgets devoted to Medicaid.
To design effective policies that will pro-
vide health insurance to uninsured children,
we need to understand who is covered by em-
ployment-based coverage and why coverage

rates are increasing. This paper provides data
on the factors affecting these trends between
1994 and 1997. It examines the change in the
number of uninsured children across selected
factors (age, family income, race, parents'
work status, and job characteristics) and
finds that the distribution of children by fam-
ily income shifted away from the poor to
higher income levels; the distribution of chil-
dren by parents' work status shifted toward
more children in families with a mother or
father working all year and full time; and
working parents were more likely to be em-
ployed in large firms in 1997 than in 1994.
Nonwhite children experienced significant
increases in employment-based health insur-
ance between 1994 and 1997, mainly because
of increased employment of their parents in
full-year, full-time jobs with access to health
insurance.
DATA AND METHODS
The data for this paper come from the March
1995 and March 1998 supplements to the Cur-
rent Population Survey (CPS).4 Each year's
survey contains detailed data on approxi-
mately 150,000 persons, including more than
40,000 children. The March CPS provides an-
swers to questions on labor-force participa-
tion, work experience, family income, demo-
graphics, and health insurance coverage. The
questions on basic demographic variables re-
fer to the month the survey was fielded, but
the questions on health insurance coverage re-
fer to the prior calendar year. For example,
respondents to the March 1998 survey were
instructed to provide information about their
health insurance coverage during calendar
year 1997. If respondents answered the ques-
tions accurately, the uninsured should in-
clude only those persons who were without
health insurance for the entire twelve months.
It is unclear, however, whether respondents
are answering the question correctly or are
providing information concerning their cur-
rent health insurance status. Comparisons of
the CPS health insurance data with other sur-
veys generally have found that the CPS more
closely resembles a point-in-time estimate
rather than a calendar-year estimate, leading
researchers to believe that at least some re-
spondents actually answer the health insur-
ance questions with reference either to a par-
ticular point in time or for some period of time
that is less than a full year.5
To understand why the percentage of chil-

dren with employment-based coverage is ris-
ing, we must examine not only who is experi-
encing an increase in coverage but also how
the characteristics of the population are
changing. For example, even if the percentage
of children covered by an employment-based
health plan remained the same across all in-
come groups between 1994 and 1997, more
children would be covered by an employ-
ment-based health plan in 1997 as long as the
income distribution shifted to higher income
levels. Hence, when trying to sort out the fac-
tors responsible for the increase in coverage
levels, it is necessary to examine both the in-
crease in coverage rates and the changing
characteristics of the population.
FINDINGS
Between 1994 and 1997 the number of chil-
dren covered by an employment-based plan
increased by almost 1.8 million. An increase in
the likelihood of being covered by an employ-
ment-based plan combined with population
growth to cause the increase. Population
growth accounted for approximately 40 per-
cent of the increase in the number of children
covered. The increased likelihood of having
employment-based coverage is due in part to
the changing characteristics of children. This
section presents the data on these changing
characteristics and also shows how the likeli-
hood of having coverage has changed within
each characteristic. The results are used to
show how the net increase in employment-
based coverage among children has been
distributed.
n AGE AND FAMILY INCOME. The per-
centage of children with an employment-
based plan increased from 58.1 percent in 1994
to 59.7 percent in 1997, resulting in a net in-
crease of approximately 1,767,800 children
covered by these plans (Exhibit 2). Young
children and children below the poverty level
saw the greatest increase in their likelihood of
having employment-based coverage.
As a child's age increases, his or her prob-
ability of being covered by an employment-
based health plan increases. However, the in-
crease in this probability between 1994 and
1997 occurred only among younger children.
As a result, children from birth to age six rep-
resented 723,400 of the 1,767,800 increase in
the number of children covered.
Family income also is an important factor
associated with the likelihood of being cov-
ered by an employment-based health plan. Be-
cause of the changing distribution of income,
we would expect more children to be covered

by such a plan. In 1994, 22.4 percent of chil-
dren were in families with family incomes un-
der the poverty level, compared with only 20.5
percent in 1997. The distribution of children
by family income shifted most toward the
higher end, 400 percent of poverty or higher.
This trend alone would account for the in-
crease in employment-based coverage among
children. However, the change in the distribu-
tion must be combined with some lower-
income groups' experiencing an increase in
the likelihood of being covered. For example,
children in families with incomes under the
poverty level experienced a 1.5-percentage-
point increase in the likelihood of being cov-
ered by an employment-based health plan.
While this group did experience an increase
in the likelihood of having employment-based
coverage, most of the increase in coverage was
the result of the shifting income distribution.6
n RACE. Overall, children of all races ex-
perienced an increase in the percentage cov-
ered by an employment-based health plan be-
tween 1994 and 1997, but the increase was felt
most among nonwhite children (Exhibit 3).
Specifically, blacks experienced a 5.3 percent
increase, Hispanics a 3.7 percent increase,
other races a 5.1 percent increase, and whites
only a 0.6 percent increase. Despite the in-
crease in employment-based coverage among
blacks, Hispanics, and other races, blacks and
Hispanics continue to be much less likely
than whites and other races are to be covered
by an employment-based health plan. Hispan-
ics and other races are increasing as a percent-
age of the population, and the net increase in
the number of children covered by employ-
ment-based insurance has been overwhelm-
ingly attributable to the increase in the popu-
lation of Hispanic children and children of
other races.
n PARENTS' WORK STATUS. The labor-
force attachment of parents is a significant
factor in determining the insurance status of
children. Children were much more likely to
have either a working father or mother em-
ployed full time, all year in 1997 than they
were in 1994 (Exhibit 4). This accounts for
virtually all of the increase in employment-
based coverage.
n WORKING PARENTS' FIRM SIZE. For
both children with working fathers and those
with working mothers, the distribution by
firm size shifted from small employers to large
employers. Children with fathers who
worked for a firm with 1,000 or more employ-
ees experienced an increase in the likelihood
of having employment-based coverage. The
combination of the effects ultimately had a
strong effect on the net number of children
gaining employment-based coverage between
1994 and 1997.7

dren covered by an employment-based health

plan increased from 58.1 percent to 59.7 per-
cent between 1994 and 1997. This increase is
due to a number of factors, both explainable
and unexplainable. The explainable factors
include changes in the characteristics of the
population, such as (1) more children in high-
income families relative to low-income fami-
lies in 1997; (2) more children with parents
working all year and full time in 1997; and (3)
working parents who were more likely to be
employed by large firms relative to small firms
in 1997. The unexplainable factors include the
increase in the likelihood of being covered by
an employment-based plan among poor chil-
dren from birth to age six and the increase in
coverage among nonwhite children.
The increased likelihood of having employ-
ment-based coverage among nonwhites is one
of the most interesting findings in this paper.
Further analysis finds that nonwhite children
were significantly more likely in 1997 than in
1994 to have a working father or mother em-
ployed full time, all year.8 It is likely that as
more nonwhite parents gain full-time, full-
year employment, access to health insurance
coverage will increase. This suggests that the
strong economy is having an effect on the cov-
erage rates of children.
As long as the economy continues to grow
and the labor market continues to be tight, we
can expect future increases in the percentage
of children with employment-based coverage.
The trend is unlikely to reverse itself even if
the economy experiences a return of high

health care cost inflation. Despite recent re-
ports, small employers will have a difficult
time dropping coverage, and large employers
will have a difficult time shifting the cost of
coverage during a period of very low unem-
ployment when employers are competing for
scarce labor resources.9 However, this trend
can easily reverse itself if the economy experi-
ences a recession.

NOTES
1. The increase in coverage is significant at the 1
percent level. These data points are slightly
lower than those published by the Census Bu-
reau. The difference stems from how private in-
surance is treated when it is obtained from
someone outside the household. The Census Bu-
reau treats private insurance obtained from out-
side the household as employment-based cover-
age. In contrast, this paper does not treat insur-
ance received from someone outside the house-
hold as employment-based coverage because
there is no way to confirm that the source of
coverage is related to employment.
2. Whether or not a person has insurance coverage
is part of a larger dynamic process composed of
some people getting coverage who did not pre-
viously have it, and other people losing coverage.
Because the results in this paper did not follow
the same people between 1994 and 1997, the 1.8
million increase in the number of children with
coverage studied here represents a net increase.
This increase includes both children who both
have gained employment-based coverage and
those who lost such coverage.
