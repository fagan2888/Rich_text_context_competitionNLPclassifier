Abstract
Background: Ethnic minorities with depression are more likely to seek mental health care through primary care
providers (PCPs) than mental health specialists. However, both provider and patient-specific challenges exist. PCP-
specific challenges include unfamiliarity with depressive symptom profiles in diverse patient populations, limited
time to address mental health, and limited referral options for mental health care. Patient-specific challenges
include stigma around mental health issues and reluctance to seek mental health treatment. To address these
issues, we implemented a multi-component intervention for Asian American and Latino American primary care
patients with depression at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH).
Methods/Design: We propose a randomized controlled trial to evaluate a culturally appropriate intervention to
improve the diagnosis and treatment of depression in our target population. Our goals are to facilitate a) primary
care providers' ability to provide appropriate, culturally informed care of depression, and b) patients' knowledge of
and resources for receiving treatment for depression. Our two-year long intervention targets Asian American and
Latino American adult (18 years of age or older) primary care patients at MGH screening positive for symptoms of
depression. All eligible patients in the intervention arm of the study who screen positive will be offered a culturally
focused psychiatric (CFP) consultation. Patients will meet with a study clinician and receive toolkits that include
psychoeducational booklets, worksheets and community resources. Within two weeks of the initial consultation,
patients will attend a follow-up visit with the CFP clinicians. Primary outcomes will determine the feasibility and
cost associated with implementation of the service, and evaluate patient and provider satisfaction with the CFP
service. Exploratory aims will describe the study population at screening, recruitment, and enrollment and identify
which variables influenced patient participation in the program.
Discussion: The study involves an innovative yet practical intervention that builds on existing resources and strives
to improve quality of care for depression for minorities. Additionally, it complements the current movement in
psychiatry to enhance the treatment of depression in primary care settings. If found beneficial, the intervention will
serve as a model for care of Asian American and Latino American patients.
Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01239407
Background
The project proposes a randomized controlled trial to
evaluate a culturally focused intervention to improve the
recognition and treatment of depression in Asian Amer-
ican and Latino American primary care patients at
Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). The interven-
tion entails using multi-lingual consultations and toolk-
its, for providers and patients, over the course of two
visits. Goals of the project are to facilitate a) primary
care providers' ability to provide appropriate, culturally
informed care of depression in adult Asian American
and Latino American patients, and b) patients' knowl-
edge of and resources for receiving treatment for
depression.

This intervention focuses on the primary care setting,
as ethnic minorities with depression are much more
likely to be cared for by primary care physicians (PCPs)
than by specialists in mental health [1]. Targeting both
the provider and patient in the intervention is impor-
tant for a variety of reasons. Providers may face chal-
lenges in correctly diagnosing depression in patients
whose ethnic background is different from their own,
due to difficulties in correctly identifying depressive
symptoms or using different cues or vocabulary to
describe depression [2,3]. In addition, there may be
some variation in symptom presentations. For example,
Latino Americans may give greater emphasis to somatic
complaints than non-Latino Caucasians [4], and as
Asian Americans become more acculturated, they tend
to report worsening levels of mood symptoms [5].
These varying symptom presentations can differ from
what most clinicians are trained to expect, resulting in
clinical misdiagnoses [6]. Patients themselves are reluc-
tant to seek treatment; Asian Americans may experience
higher levels of perceived stigma related to seeking
mental health treatment, particularly from their families
[7]. In addition, Latino Americans may have had fewer
helpful mental health treatment experiences than non-
Latino Caucasians, which may make them less willing
to seek treatment in the future [8].
As one solution to bridge this gap between provider
knowledge and patient needs, Kirmayer et al. developed
the Cultural Consultation Service (CCS) model in 1999
[9,10]. The CCS responded to requests for assistance
placed by primary care providers and mental health pro-
fessionals facing difficulties with the assessment or treat-
ment of ethnically diverse patients. In their evaluation of
100 cases referred to the CCS, Kirmayer's group found
that cultural misunderstandings were associated with an
increased risk for incomplete assessments, incorrect
diagnoses, and inadequate or inappropriate treatment.
By providing cultural consultations and formulations
based on the DSM-IV cultural formulation model, the
CCS effectively improved diagnostic assessment and
treatment for their diverse population [9].
In a critical review of the literature, Van Voorhees et
al evaluated interventions attempting to reduce dispari-
ties between non-Latino Caucasians and ethnic minori-
ties and found that multi-component interventions were
successful in improving depressive symptoms and func-
tional status in nearly every study [11]. These interven-
tions utilized a chronic disease management model,
complete with case management, enhancement of access
to care, and a variety of approaches tailored to the spe-
cific system, provider, and patient factors. One study,
the "Improving Mood-Promoting Access to Collabora-
tive Treatment" (IMPACT), not only improved all out-
comes, but also eliminated ethnic disparities [12]. This
trial randomized older adults with depression to usual
care or to an intervention including case management,
patient education, and either medication or problem-sol-
ving psychotherapy within a collaborative care model
including available psychiatric consultation. The inter-
vention demonstrated a reduction of depressed mood by
at least 50 percent as compared to usual care; however,
there was little cultural tailoring of the materials, i.e.,
the "matching of study intervention goals and materials
to the needs and sensitivities of specific populations." In
fact, Van Voorhees et al concluded that none of the stu-
dies in their review compared culturally tailored inter-
ventions with standard interventions in a randomized
control trial. They also wondered if "structural changes
in the pattern of delivery of mental health services" and
"culturally tailored mental health service programs" may
prove to be particularly effective to minorities impacted
by mental health issues [11]. The proposed intervention
seeks to provide such a model to Asian American and
Latino American primary care patients - understudied
populations in health care disparities intervention
research [13,14].
Preliminary Studies
The first part of the proposed intervention, conducting
clinic-wide screening for depression, builds on the work
by Dr. Albert Yeung. In one project using widespread
depression screening in an Asian American population
in primary care in 2004-2005, Yeung and colleagues [15]
used a Chinese bilingual version of the Patient Health
Questionnaire (CB-PHQ-9) to screen and identify
patients with possible depression. Patients who screened
positive were interviewed to establish psychiatric diagno-
sis and to engage them in treatment. Their work
demonstrated that depression could be identified in this
sample of primary care patients, using a translated
screening questionnaire and a culturally sensitive clinical
evaluation to engage patients in mental health treat-
ment. In addition, 44% of those who screened positive
agreed to come in to be assessed by a psychiatrist;
among those who were then diagnosed with MDD, 93%
were willing to accept treatment. These findings demon-
strate that screening minority patients in primary care
settings can be both a feasible and effective tool to iden-
tify patients likely to have clinical depression.
Mischoulon et al. reported that screening in primary
care settings may not be enough; independent screening
by psychiatrists in primary care settings may not be ade-
quate to ensure appropriate management of depression
by PCPs [16]. In this study, patients were screened for
MDD in a community-based primary care health center.
For those who met criteria for MDD, a letter was mailed
to their PCP informing them of their patient's diagnosis
of MDD. Forty outpatients, of whom 29 (72 percent)

Page 2 of 10
were Latino American, were found to meet criteria for
MDD. Medical record charts were reviewed 3 months
later to determine the PCPs' management following the
diagnosis. Of the 38 patients who remained in the study
at 3 months, 20 (53 percent) received no intervention
for depression from the PCP, and of these, 14 (70 per-
cent) were Latino American. Only five (13 percent) were
prescribed an antidepressant by their PCP, nine (24 per-
cent) were referred to mental health services for medica-
tion, psychotherapy or combination treatment, and four
(11 percent) were prescribed an antidepressant and then
referred to mental health services. Mischoulon and col-
leagues concluded that possible explanations for this
lack of treatment of depression may include time con-
straints during primary care visits, patient and/or physi-
cian reticence, and insufficient education of PCPs about
clinical depression. These findings suggest that screen-
ing and notification must be supplemented by additional
interventions if they are to have an impact on the care
of depression.
The second part of this proposed intervention derives
from a pilot project from our group that applied a cul-
turally focused psychiatric consultation service for a
group of high service-utilization patients. In the initial
pilot, the service was based on the Cultural Consultation
Service (CCS) model developed by Kirmayer et al [9,10].
As part of the consultation service, members of the pro-
ject team met monthly with case managers who were
following a group of chronically, medically ill patients.
Cases with difficult psychiatric issues were discussed,
and formal consults could be requested for patients
whose presentation and treatment was complicated by
cultural issues. Members of the consultation service also
met regularly to discuss cases. Results of the initial
needs assessment indicated that case managers per-
ceived a strong need for such a culturally focused psy-
chiatric consultation service, but tended to refer patients
for psychosocial issues rather than for psychiatric diag-
nostic assessment. Similarly, in a six-month follow-up to
the culturally focused psychiatric clinical intervention,
case managers were asked about their overall perception
of the utility of the service and obstacles to its use.
Based on their responses, case managers perceived a sig-
nificant value, but tended to underutilize the service.
This experience suggested four hypotheses. The consul-
tation service would benefit from: a) focusing on a spe-
cific psychiatric diagnosis; b) targeting patients at their
primary care providers' offices directly, providing a
greater ability to connect with minority patients than an
intervention that serves as a liaison to staff; c) making
the consultation service more user-friendly; and d)
enriching the intervention with patient-focused materi-
als, in order to maximize patient knowledge and skills.
These findings further supported the recruitment of
patients through screening for those who meet criteria
for likely depression, rather than relying solely on refer-
rals by PCPs.
A final component of the CFP intervention was based
on the team's experience with adapting cognitive beha-
vioral interventions for the treatment of depressive dis-
orders in chronically ill Latino Americans [17,18]. For
example, in a sample of HIV-positive foreign-born
Latino Americans, a cognitive behavioral intervention
was linguistically/culturally adapted and administered by
bilingual/bicultural staff. Participants received either a
10-week cognitive behavioral stress management
(CBSM) intervention or a one-day seminar. Results indi-
cated that, compared to those who only received the
seminar, participants who received the CBSM interven-
tion reported significantly less anger, maladaptive cop-
ing, and HIV-related symptoms [19]. These results led
to recommendations for including culturally-adapted
cognitive behavioral therapy techniques within clinical
interventions for chronically-ill Latinos, for example, by
addressing cultural factors such as familismo and
respeto.
Study Aims
This study is a randomized controlled trial of a cultu-
rally focused psychiatric consultation model for Asian
American and Latino American primary care patients
with depression (see Figure 1). The primary aim of the
study is to determine the feasibility, satisfaction and cost
associated with implementing a CFP consultation service
within a primary care setting at MGH. Additionally, an
exploratory aim serves to describe (e.g., demographic
factors; level of depression; service utilization) the parti-
cipant patient population at screening, recruitment and
enrollment, as well as to determine which, if any, of
these variables influence participation in the study (e.g.,
consent to be contacted).
Methods/Design
Overview
This is a randomized controlled trial of the CFP inter-
vention. During the study period, all patients in partici-
pating primary care clinics will receive a screening form
for symptoms of depression; data on age, gender, race,
ethnicity and primary language will be obtained at the
time of screening. Asian American and Latino American
patients who screen positive for clinical depression will
be contacted by study staff and invited to participate in
the CFP study. Eligible patients will be randomized
either to the intervention arm or usual care based on
their primary care provider. Patients in the intervention
arm will receive the CFP intervention over two visits
and then called at six-months by study staff to adminis-
ter follow-up questionnaires (described below). Patients

in the usual care arm will be called at baseline and at
six-month follow-up by study staff to administer ques-
tionnaires (described below). To evaluate the cultural
components of the study, a number of qualitative inter-
views will also be conducted with participants in the
intervention and usual care arms, and with members of
the target population who did not participate in the
study. Please see Figure 1 for the study flowchart.
Description of Intervention
The CFP intervention includes two major components:
1) Patients receiving the intervention will undergo a
CFP consultation assessment by a member of a multi-
disciplinary team of mental health providers (e.g., psy-
chiatrists, psychologists) who are bilingual and/or
bicultural, trained in culturally competent techniques,
and familiar with the cultures and languages of the cli-
ents served. The Engagement Interview Protocol and
DSM-IV-TR Cultural Formulation model will be utilized
to make a culturally appropriate diagnosis, assess the
patient's psychiatric needs in a cultural context, conduct
a culturally focused intervention, engage the patient, and
make recommendations to the PCP [15,20,21]. The CFP
clinician will work collaboratively with the patient's PCP
to communicate diagnostic and treatment recommenda-
tions after the two-week follow-up visit. Given the criti-
cal nature of communicating the CFP findings to the
PCP, the CFP clinician will work with the PCP to deter-
mine his preferences for communication. Recommenda-
tions can be given to the PCP by multiple avenues: by
e-mailed letter, and/or by page or phone call as needed.
Clinicians will make themselves available to PCPs on an
as-needed basis throughout the study period.
2) Patients will receive a culturally appropriate CFP
consultation patient toolkit, available in their language
of preference (i.e., English, Spanish, Chinese, or Vietna-
mese), as well as training in using the toolkit materials.
The patient toolkit was added to enrich the intervention
by providing patients with psychoeducation, handouts
on managing depression based on cognitive behavioral
therapy techniques, and information on community
resources [22]. To help in the management of their
&

2 Includes structured interview, self-report measures (e.g., depressive symptoms, service utilization) and electronic medical record review; letter with
recommendations to primary care provider sent either after baseline or two-week follow-up.
3 Includes self-report measures (e.g., depressive symptoms, service utilization) and electronic medical record review.
4 Qualitative interviews conducted after six-month assessment with study participants and members of target population.

depression, patients will be encouraged to complete
these materials and bring them to visits with their PCP.
In addition, within two weeks of the initial consultation,
patients will attend a follow-up visit with the CFP clini-
cian to review and answer their questions about the
treatment of their depressive symptoms. The CFP clini-
cian will also review patients' understanding of the
toolkit, including their use of the cognitive-behavioral
based handouts. To add flexibility in follow-up for
patients, these visits can be done in person or over the
phone.
CFP Intervention Training
At the beginning of the study, CFP clinicians attend four
hour-long training sessions on the CFP consultation
study procedures to ensure that the intervention is
applied in a standard fashion. Clinicians will audiotape
all CFP sessions, and a weekly group supervision meet-
ing for CFP clinicians will be held to review cases and
provide supervision for issues related to clinical diagno-
sis and intervention. Finally, the CFP consultation ser-
vice will meet weekly to discuss consultation requests,
follow up on the impact of consultations, and to address
other logistic issues.
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
Patients will be included based on the following criteria:
adults who 1) are 18 years of age or older; 2) are mem-
bers of either targeted Asian American or Latino Ameri-
can minority groups; 3) screen positive for symptoms of
depression; and 4) are able to consent to study partici-
pation. Patients will be excluded if they have active
unstable, untreated psychiatric illness precluding partici-
pation in the study (e.g., actively suicidal or homicidal
or actively psychotic). Patients in the intervention arm
will be excluded if they have bipolar disorder.
Target PCP practices
The intervention will be conducted at four MGH pri-
mary care practices; each PCP practice consists of multi-
ple sub-practices called pods.
Recruitment strategy
All patients in participating primary care clinics will be
offered screening for the symptoms of depression by the
Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) as part of their
routine primary care visit [23]; data on age, gender,
race, ethnicity and primary language will be obtained at
the time of screening. Asian American and Latino
American patients who screen positive for clinical
depression will be called by study staff and invited to
participate in the CFP consultation intervention. Patients
also may be referred by participating PCPs. For the qua-
litative interviews, a subset of study participants will be
invited to participate after the six-month follow-up visit,
as well as eligible members of the target population who
not participate in the study.
Randomization scheme
Primary care patients at MGH will be randomized by
pods, which comprise multiple clusters of 5-6 PCPs
within each practice site. Using electronic medical
records data from 2007, practices will be matched based
on an index composed of two variables: 1) the number
of patients who are members of the target minority
groups and 2) the rate of diagnosed depression. Within
each pair, one practice will be randomized to participate
in the intervention and the other will be assigned to the
"usual care" arm.
Target Health Condition
All patients in the intervention and usual care (control)
arms will be screened for clinical depression using the
self-rated PHQ-2 at their primary care visit. Both
patients and PCPs will be notified of positive screening
results for all patients assessed. For the intervention
arm, diagnoses of specific depressive disorders (major
depressive disorder, dysthymia, depressive disorder
NOS, adjustment disorder with depressed mood) will be
established during the baseline clinical interview using
DSM-IV-TR criteria [21].
Definition of Usual Care
PCPs of those patients who screen positive on the PHQ-
2 in the usual care arm will receive written feedback on
their patients' PHQ-2 results, in addition to a standard
list of referrals to MGH mental health resources. At the
end of the study, patients in the usual care arm will be
offered the intervention.
Human Subjects Approval
All study procedures have been approved by the hospital
Institutional Review Board (IRB).
Analytic Plan
Description of Measures (See Table 1):
Initial Screen
On the screening form, patients will be administered
the PHQ-2 and asked additional questions about gen-
der, age, race, ethnicity, and language spoken at home.
Using a cutoff score of two or above (out of a possible
total score of six), the PHQ-2 has been validated for
diagnosing any clinical depressive disorder with a 82.1
percent sensitivity, 80.4 percent specificity, and a posi-
tive predictive value of 48.3 percent (assuming 18 per-
cent prevalence of any depressive disorder) [23]; it
consists of the first two questions of the PHQ-9, which
Trinh et al. BMC Psychiatry 2011, 11:166
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/11/166
Page 5 of 10
has been translated into Chinese, Vietnamese, and
Spanish [23-27]. The screening form will be available
in multiple languages (English, Spanish, Chinese, and
Vietnamese).
Baseline Visit
Both patients in the intervention and usual care arm will
give consent to participate in the study at the beginning
of the baseline visit. In the intervention arm, assessment
measures used at baseline to characterize the interven-
tion patient population will include the Mini Interna-
tional Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) [28], Quick
Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Rated
Scale (QIDS-SR) (see Appendix 2) [29], Global Assess-
ment of Functioning (GAF) [21], and Schwartz Outcome
Scale (SOS-10) [30]. Questionnaires regarding the
patients' demographics and utilization of resources will
also be assessed. In the usual care arm, for target mino-
rities who screen positive, the assessment measure will
include the QIDS-SR and SOS-10.
Six-month follow-up
Patients will have the option to complete the visit over
the phone or in person. In both the intervention and
usual care arms, patients will be given the QIDS-SR
self-rated questionnaire and asked a brief "Resource Uti-
lization Questionnaire" with questions regarding use of
antidepressant medications, referrals/visits to mental
health specialists, or alternative providers both in and
out of the MGH system. The electronic medical record
will also be reviewed at baseline and at the six-month
follow-up for both intervention and usual care arms to
obtain depression diagnoses, prescription of antidepres-
sant medications, and referrals/visits to mental health
specialists in the system.
Sample size and power
Initially, we planned for a total sample size of 506
patients, split evenly between the intervention and usual
care groups. We calculated this sample size to yield 84
percent power to detect a difference in the reduction of
depressive symptoms on the QIDS-SR by 50 percent in
the intervention arm versus 35 percent in the treatment
arm, paralleling the experience of patients in the inter-
vention arm in STAR*D, an multi-center effectiveness
study of Major Depression in primary care settings [31]
as well as the experience of patients in usual care arm
in several studies [32-34]. However, given the multiple
recruitment challenges we have faced to date, we have
revised our total sample size to 120 patients, split evenly
between intervention and usual care groups. Although
this sample size is significantly smaller, the results of
both the qualitative and exploratory analyses of this
study will inform further iterations of this intervention
and study design.
Qualitative analysis
The project's implementation process and satisfaction
(providers' and patients') with the CFP consultation
intervention will be assessed in several ways. Qualitative
data will be collected through interviews, meetings and
conversations with the project and primary care practice
staff, as well as reviews of project records and meeting
summaries. Interviews will be transcribed and translated,
with content analysis used to assess for convergent and
divergent themes.
The patient interviews will include samples of Asian
American and Latino American patients. In addition,
interviews will be conducted with members of the target
population who did not participate in the study. The
interviews will be conducted by telephone, or in person

as needed. The interviews will assess the extent of
patients' involvement with the project or perception of
this kind of intervention. All participants will be asked
for their opinions about offering this service through
their primary care office and the screening process. In
addition, intervention participants will be surveyed
about satisfaction, use of the toolkit, opinions about the
cultural tailoring of the intervention, and asked for their
suggested changes to the intervention. Intervention
patients will also be asked about their follow-up on
recommendations from the consultation and discussions
- if any - with their PCP resulting from the intervention.
Usual care participants will be asked about their use of
mental health services, their understanding of the study
when they enrolled, and their views on what they believe
would be important to include within toolkits or a cul-
turally focused psychiatric consultation service.
Using open- and closed- ended questions, the project
staff and practice staff (including PCPs, practice man-
agers and frontline staff) will be asked about their per-
ceptions of, experiences with, and satisfaction with the
project's implementation, including the screening and
referral process. The organizational structure and
resources of each participating primary care practice will
be characterized at the beginning of the project to assist
in the understanding and interpretation of implementa-
tion differences across the sites. Through the review of
organizational data and regularly collected project data
and the interviews, the identified organizational issues
will be addressed with the practices, possibly identifying
the need for procedural changes or additional staff
training.
Additionally, the costs of implementing and continu-
ing the program will be assessed. Initial startup costs
and the ongoing costs of the intervention will be
tracked. Both the direct dollar outlays associated with
program implementation and the dollar values of pro-
gram resources not reflected in the program budget will
be calculated. While the project budget and expenses
can be calculated directly from project data, work will
be done with practices to estimate the cost of consulta-
tions and coordinating care.
Other questions to be asked within this cost analysis
will be whether patients' utilization of practice and hos-
pital servicesÂ­including primary care, emergency depart-
ment and inpatient visits and their associated costsÂ­
changed as a result of participating in this project. Costs
of the care provided to the patients will also be com-
pared to the cost of usual care in the control group.
Using the figures above, the total range and average
costs of care for the patients receiving the intervention
will be calculated. A preliminary analysis also will be
undertaken to look at differences in the use of services
in the treatment versus the control group, i.e., if the two
groups differ in their utilization and costs of primary
care, emergency department visits and inpatient care.
Such cost analyses may provide preliminary estimates of
the costs of implementing such interventions in aca-
demic medical centers.
Exploratory analysis
Descriptive analyses will be performed to provide infor-
mation related to the study's experience conducting the
initial screening patients within their primary care
clinics.
Data from initial screens will be utilized to provide a
greater description of the patient population at screen-
ing, recruitment and enrollment (e.g., race; ethnicity;
preferred language; age; gender; level of depression (i.e.,
PHQ-2 score); service utilization, as well as identify
which of these variables, if any, served to influence par-
ticipation in the study. This information will allow us to
describe, for example, whether consent to be contacted
differs by level of depression and whether this is moder-
ated by demographic factors (e.g., race, ethnicity, gen-
der). Additionally we will provide additional data
describing rates of enrollment as compared to the total
screened.
Secondary exploratory analyses will explore the impact
of the intervention on depression. Patients' scores on
the QIDS-SR will be compared between the usual care
and intervention arms. To measure changes in racial
and ethnic disparities in depression recognition and
treatment, rates of depression diagnoses will be com-
pared from baseline to six-month follow-up for the
intervention and usual care arms. As measures of the
use of any ongoing specialty mental health care, the
rates of prescription of pharmacotherapy and referrals/
visits to mental health specialists as provided by patient
self-report will be compared at baseline and at the six-
month follow-up. Data analysis will be conducted using
STATA statistical software [35].
A general linear model that accounts for clustering at
the PCP level will be used. Analyses of the main out-
comes will include as covariates any patient or physician
factors that differed significantly between study arms.
Outcomes regarding diagnosis and treatment will be
assessed using general estimating equations with a bino-
mial link and standard errors will be adjusted to account
for clustering within practice. Separate analyses will be
conducted for each outcome (i.e., dependent variables)
Â­ changes in depressive symptoms, diagnosis of and
treatment (prescription of antidepressant medications;
referrals/visits to mental health specialists) for depres-
sion at six months after enrollment. The effect of study
arm on each outcome will be assessed, controlling for
significant differences emerging from the bivariate
analyses.

Discussion
The intervention is designed to provide enhanced recog-
nition and treatment of depression in Asian American
and Latino American primary care patients, while pla-
cing minimal additional burden on the existing primary
care system at MGH. Several challenges to the imple-
mentation of this intervention exist, including minimiz-
ing burden to participating sites, recruitment and
retention issues, and language and literacy issues.
Regarding the first challenge, obtaining staff and part-
nership buy-in during the grant-writing stage, and soli-
citing feedback from all levels of administration during
every step of the process of designing and implementing
the study has been instrumental. Regular meetings with
participating sites are crucial to clarify workflow, ques-
tions about the service, and other issues that may arise.
Keeping the protocols simple and easy to implement
will be critical.
As with any clinical research intervention, recruitment
and retention (e.g., dropout, loss to follow-up) are con-
cerns (40). This is particularly relevant for recruitment
and retention of minorities. Within recruitment and
retention, the CFP team will consider how and which
cultural issues are applicable in order to target Asian
American and Latino American primary care patients.
Among these groups, examples of such characteristics
may include language and literacy, use of complemen-
tary and alternative treatments, the perceived impor-
tance of the quality of interpersonal relationships
between the patient and CFP team, and the relationship
between the PCP practices and the CFP team.
To address language and literacy issues, all materials
(e.g., consent forms, study instructions) and the CFP
consultations will be provided in the patient's preferred
primary language, and materials for the toolkit will be
developed at a sixth-grade reading level. The patient
toolkit has also been prepared in audio CD format for
patients with literacy issues. Recruiting research assis-
tants and clinical staff with Spanish, Mandarin, Canto-
nese and Vietnamese proficiency are crucial to the team.
If patients and providers indicate strong satisfaction
with the CFP intervention, it is hoped that the interven-
tion can be expanded through a large scale randomized
controlled trial of the intervention. Findings from such a
study will provide evidence for the effectiveness of this
model to improve the mental health of minorities in pri-
mary care settings.
Although this intervention is being piloted at MGH
with Asian American and Latino American patients, the
goal is ultimately to make it more generalizable with the
ability to disseminate the intervention to different set-
tings. To this end, a crucial end-product of this inter-
vention will be the creation of a manualized "start-up
guide" which will include the tools used to develop the
CFP consultation, including conceptual models, proto-
cols used for assessment, implementation process and
its evaluation. A detailed evaluation will be conducted
to understand the implementation process and costs (e.
g., start-up and implementation). This implementation
evaluation and cost analysis will inform the generaliz-
ability of this intervention. Organizations seeking to
implement the CFP consultation intervention could use
this guide to inform the development of an intervention
appropriate to their setting.
Regarding dissemination, this consultation model could
be used in any health care setting with outpatient clinics
and sufficient staffing capacity to create a psychiatrically
focused consultation service. Certainly, questions arise
regarding the ability of an organization to implement this
intervention with a significant minority population but
few bicultural/bilingual providers, or in a setting where
providers have not been trained to conduct similar cultu-
rally focused interventions. Such an organization may
need concrete details regarding intervention implementa-
tion as discussed above. Similarly, the organization may
benefit from seeking outside supervision and support
from others experienced in conducting culturally focused
interventions. However, such supervision and support is
available and more readily accessible. One of the senior
members of our team, Dr. Yeung, is an expert in the field
of telepsychiatry and is currently developing a model of
telepsychiatry consultation via the internet for Chinese
American immigrants with depression. He is interested
in eventually expanding a network of multicultural clini-
cians that can serve as consultants to patients in areas
with underserved minorities, or as consultants to organi-
zations planning to implement this model. The MGH
CFP consultation team would be eager to serve in this
capacity. If this intervention is disseminated to other
organizations, further research regarding the generaliz-
ability and dissemination process of this intervention
would inform this approach.
By improving the identification and treatment of
depression in Latino American and Asian American
populations, this intervention will help reduce the well-
known problems with under-recognition and under-
treatment of these minority patient groups. This CFP
consultation service complements the current movement
in psychiatry to enhance the treatment of depression in
primary care settings, especially useful for minority
patients who are unwilling or unable to access specialty
mental health care.
Conclusion
The proposed CFP intervention complements the cur-
rent movement in psychiatry to enhance the treatment
of depression in primary care settings. This project
serves as a model for understanding both a) the

minorities in primary care settings; and b) the feasibility
of this intervention through the use of an implementa-
tion evaluation and cost analysis.
