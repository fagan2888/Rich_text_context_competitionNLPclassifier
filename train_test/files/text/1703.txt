A vitamin D nutritional cornucopia: new insights concerning the
serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D status of the US population1,2
Anthony W Norman
It is generally agreed that the serum concentration of 25-
hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] in healthy persons is the best
indicator of the vitamin D status of patients with vitamin D­re-
lated disease states (1). The report by Looker et al (2) in this issue
of the Journal provides a cornucopia of new insights into the
vitamin D nutritional status of US citizens from 1988 through
2004. In particular, this report compares serum 25(OH)D con-
centrations of 20 289 participants in the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2000­2004 with
those of 18 158 participants in NHANES III (1988­1994). For
the first time, results were reported for children 1­11 y old,
pregnant women, and the Mexican American population.

25(OH)D concentrations of persons 12 y old fell by 5­20
nmol/L between 1988­1994 and 2000­2004. Assay changes,
which were unrelated to changes in 25(OH)D status, accounted
for a portion of this apparent difference between the 2 study
groups; nevertheless, at the end of the complex analysis, there
still was a significant (7.1 nmol/L) reduction in 25(OH)D con-
centrations in males (except Mexican Americans) but not in most
female groups. This result is potentially disturbing if it represents
the beginning of the downward trend in serum 25(OH)D con-
centrations that has been seen over the past 10­15 y. It will
therefore be essential to repeat this study after another decade.
The vitamin D cornucopia that Looker et al provided contains a
variety of other novel and important observations. These include
differences in 25(OH)D status 1) by ethnicity and sex in non-
Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans; 2)
by age group (1­5, 6­11, 12­19, 20­49, 50­69, or 70 y old); 3)
by season (November­March or April­October); and 4) by preg-
nancy status. In addition, a second vitamin D cornucopia can be
found under "Supplementary data" in the current online issue. This
material contains extensive data on 4 topics: 1) a comparison of
25(OH)D assay methods; 2) seasonal variations in serum 25(OH)D
by race-ethnicity in persons 12 y old; 3) the prevalence of serum
25(OH)D concentrations  25 nmol/L (an indication of nutritional
vitamin D deficiency); and 4) the prevalence of serum 25(OH)D3
concentrations below selected thresholds by age, sex, and race-
ethnicity.
Some readers may be troubled by 2 technical aspects of the study
byLookeretal.Apotentiallyconfoundingproblemisthattherewas
anevolutionin25(OH)Dassaymethodologybetweenthefirststudy
in 1988­1994 and the second study in 2000­2004. Possible assay
differenceswereassessedbyrepeatingmeasurementsofthe25(OH)D
concentrations in 150 stored serum samples from NHANES III
with the samples from the 2000­2004 samples. Looker et al used
sophisticated statistical techniques to tease out the shift in the
mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations between the 2 decades that
was due to changes in assay methods. This problem was recently
discussed in detail (3). However, there still is a need for signif-
icant improvements in 25(OH)D assays so that consistent and
precise assay results may be obtained over multiyear periods.
The second potential concern relates to the protocol used in
NHANES; that is, the serum samples were collected in the US
southern latitudes (35 °N) only in November­March and in the
US northern latitudes (35 °N) only in April­October. Thus, the
magnitude of the seasonal fall in 25(OH)D concentrations in the
winter in the northern latitudes is underestimated, as is the increase
in concentrations in the summer in the southern latitudes. Ideally, in
astudyfocusingonserum25(OH)Dconcentrations,thereshouldbe
no bias of the time of the year for the latitude at which the serum
samples were collected. These same concerns also apply to the
involvement of the vitamin D endocrine system with the disease
process of cancer. Epidemiologic studies have suggested a direct
link between greater sunlight (ultraviolet B light) production of
vitamin D3
in populations living at lower latitudes and lower inci-
dences of breast, colon, prostate, and ovarian cancers and non-
Hodgkinlymphoma(4).Otherstudieshaveshownthatpersonswith
lowserumconcentrationsof25(OH)D(ie,8nmol/L)hadahigher
incidence of cancer (5), which reinforces the need to improve vita-
min D nutritional status.
The study by Looker et al is particularly important, given the
current concerns about the appropriate recommendations for the
dailyintakeofvitaminD3
(6,7).Thecurrentadequateintakeallow-
ance of vitamin D, recommended in 1997, is considered by many
scientiststobetoolowandtobefocusedonlyonvitaminD'sactions
oncalciumandboneissues(1).However,overthepastdecade,new
evidence has shown that there are 5 additional physiologic systems
in which the vitamin D receptor and its cognate steroid hormone,
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3
[1,25(OH)2
D3
], generate biologi-
cal responses (8). These are the immune, pancreas, heart-
cardiovascular, muscle, and brain systems; the control of the cell

cycle and thus of the disease process of cancer is also involved.
Acting through the vitamin D receptor, the steroid hormone
1,25(OH)2
D can produce a wide array of favorable biological
effects that collectively are projected to contribute to the im-
provement of human health. The sphere of influence of the vi-
tamin D endocrine system, updated to include physiologic sys-
tems beyond calcium and bone, is shown in Figure 1.
The size of the NHANES study group is large, and one of its
greatest values is that it provides the opportunity for study of the
nutritional status of major ethnic groups in the US population. The
25(OH)D data from a properly diverse study group will allow ap-
propriatehealth-caredecisionstobemadeforeachethnicsubgroup.
It is essential that the next chapter of the NHANES process will
include appropriate measurements and evaluations to provide in-
sight into the 25(OH)D nutritional status of all 6 of the physiologic
systems that make up the vitamin D endocrine system.

FIGURE 1. Summary of the vitamin D endocrine system. Target organs for the steroid hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3
[1,25(OH)2
D3
] are defined
by the presence of the vitamin D receptor (VDR); 37 tissues are known to possess the VDR (8). The paracrine production of 1, 25(OH)2
D3
is known to occur
in at least 10 tissues (8). New evidence shows that 5 additional physiologic systems (immune, pancreas, heart-cardiovascular, muscle, and brain systems) and
the traditional intestinal-bone calcium system are responsible for producing biological vitamin D­related responses that are important to good health.
