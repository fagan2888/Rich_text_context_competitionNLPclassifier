Female Cigarette and Alcohol Consumption
as a Short-Term Mating Strategy
Eveline Vincke1
Abstract
In developed countries, the traditional gender gap in youth smoking and drinking is closing. As tobacco and alcohol are more
harmful to women than to men, this is an alarming trend. As men are generally more short-term oriented in their sexuality than
women, and given that cigarette and alcohol use are still considered masculine behaviors, we explored if female smoking and
drinking can function as a short-term mating strategy. By means of a between-subjects experiment (N ¼ 218), men's perceptions
of female smoking and drinking were studied. The experiment showed that young men perceive women who use cigarettes and
alcohol as being more sexually unrestricted. Furthermore, tobacco and (especially) alcohol use brought some short-term
attractiveness benefits to women. In short-term mating contexts, drinking enhanced women's attractiveness, whereas occa-
sional smoking was found equally desirable as not smoking. However, in long-term mating contexts, frequent drinking and all
smoking behavior harmed women's desirability. A follow-up study (N ¼ 202) confirmed men's perceptions, showing that female
users of tobacco and alcohol are indeed more short-term oriented in their sexuality. Overall, results indicate that female smoking
and drinking can operate as a short-term mating strategy.

In young adulthood, smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol
are widespread (Hammond, 2005; Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], 2014; U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services [DHHS], 2012).
Generally, males engage most in these behaviors. Yet, a high
number of women also smokes and drinks (Ahlstro
¨m & O
¨ ster-
berg, 2005; DHHS, 2012; SAMHSA, 2014). Even more,
research shows that the traditional gender gap in youth smoking
and drinking is closing, particularly in the well-developed Eur-
opean and American regions (Amos, Greaves, Nichter, &
Bloch, 2012; Flandorfer, Wegner, & Buber, 2010; Hitchman
& Fong, 2011; Holmila & Raitasalo, 2005; World Health Orga-
nization [WHO], 2005, 2008).
Given the detrimental physical, social, and behavioral
effects of early smoking and drinking (Doll, Peto, Boreham,
& Sutherland, 2004; Ellickson, Tucker, & Klein, 2003; Jha
et al., 2013; WHO, 2014), this is a worrisome trend. Especially
since female users are more susceptible to the negative health
effects due to physiological differences (Huxley & Woodward,
2011; Mancinelli, Vitali, & Ceccanti, 2009; Neugut &
Jacobson, 2006; Nolen-Hoeksema, 2004; Steliga & Dresler,
2011). As women have higher levels of body fat and estrogen,
combined with lower levels of metabolizing enzymes, women
absorb and retain alcohol more than men. This leads to higher
alcohol concentrations in women's blood and a greater toxicity
(Holmila & Raitasalo, 2005; Mumenthaler, Taylor, O'Hara, &
Yesavage, 1999; WHO, 2005). In addition, women are more
vulnerable to cardiovascular and lung diseases due to a higher
genetic susceptibility to tobacco carcinogens (Bennett et al.,
1999; Shriver et al., 2000).
In order to halt this alarming trend, more insight is necessary
in why young women increasingly engage in cigarette and
alcohol consumption.

Human Sexuality and Courtship Behavior
Due to asymmetries in fertility and minimum level of parental
investment (Buss & Schmitt, 1993; Trivers, 1972), men and
women benefit from engaging in different sexual strategies.
Men often follow a more short-term oriented, unrestricted mat-
ing strategy, approaching a higher number of women. Women,
on the other hand, are generally more long-term oriented and
restricted. However, both the sexual strategies theory (Buss &
Schmitt, 1993) and the strategic pluralism model (Gangestad &
Simpson, 2000) point out that men and women follow both
mating strategies depending on environmental circumstances
(e.g., harshness, uncertainty) and personal characteristics (e.g.,
attractiveness).
As women are generally more sexually restricted than men
(Schmitt, 2005), they are often demanding of a costly courtship
before consenting to sexual encounters. Therefore, to avoid
high mating efforts, cues of sexual availability in women are
beneficial for men following a short-term mating strategy.
Accordingly, women engage in behaviors to signal their
short-term mating orientation (STMO) to men (Buss &
Schmitt, 1993; Regan, Levin, Sprecher, Christopher, & Cate,
2000). Research suggests that women often use signaling stra-
tegies analogous to men, to indicate that they are also more
manlike and unrestricted in their sexual strategy (Sylwester &
Pawlowski, 2011).
Male Short-Term Mating
Several studies indicate that physical risk-taking is used by
men in short-term mating situations. Not only does the prox-
imity of attractive women stimulate physically risky behavior
(Frankenhuis, Dotsch, Karremans, & Wigboldus, 2010; Paw-
lowski, Atwal, & Dunbar, 2008; Ronay & Hippel, 2010), phys-
ical risk-taking is also found most attractive in short-term
mating situations (Bassett & Moss, 2004; Kelly & Dunbar,
2001; Sylwester & Pawlowski, 2011). Also, smoking cigarettes
and drinking alcohol--being physically risky behaviors--
appear to function as a short-term mating strategy. Young men
with high mating motivations engage more in drinking games
and smoking behavior (Hone, Carter, & Mccullough, 2013;
Hone & McCullough, 2015; Jones & Figueredo, 2007),
whereas women perceive male cigarette and alcohol users to
be more sexually unrestricted and more desirable as a short-
term partner than nonusers (Vincke, 2016).
Female Short-Term Mating
Also in women, risk-taking functions as a cue in short-term
mating situations. Both physical and social risk-taking (i.e.,
engaging in nonconformist behavior that can damage one's rep-
utation) enhance female attractiveness in short-term mating con-
texts (Bassett & Moss, 2004; Sylwester & Pawlowski, 2011). In
long-term mating situations, on the other hand, men prefer risk
avoiders (Bassett & Moss, 2004; Sylwester & Pawlowski, 2011),
unless the risky activities are moderate (Farthing, 2007).
In line with risk-taking literature and male signaling,
research also indicates that female cigarette and alcohol con-
sumption are related to short-term mating. Indeed, and similar
to men, women with high mating efforts participate more in
drinking games (Hone & McCullough, 2015; Hone et al.,
2013). In addition, both young men and women who are
actively dating drink more alcohol compared to youngsters
who are not dating or who are in a committed relationship
(Devos-Comby, Daniel, & Lange, 2013; Pedersen, Lee, Lari-
mer, & Neighbors, 2009). Moreover, the study of Clark (2004)
shows that the amount of money spent on alcohol is a very
strong predictor of women's level of sexual unrestrictedness.
Women even indicate considering drinking as a means to indi-
cate sexual willingness to others (Lindgren, Pantalone, Lewis,
& George, 2009; Lindgren, Parkhill, George, & Hendershot,
2008), whereas men perceive women who drink alcohol as
being more sexually available and willing (Abbey, 2002; Gar-
cia & Kushnier, 1987; Koukounas, Djokic, & Miller, 2014;
Lindgren et al., 2008; Parks & Scheidt, 2000).
In women, smoking behavior is also linked to higher mating
efforts and an unrestricted sexual approach (Jones & Figuer-
edo, 2007; La
°ngstro
¨m & Hanson, 2006). Female adolescent
girls with a liberal sexual approach are up to 8 times more
likely to smoke (Li, King, & Winter, 2010), while--more so
for girls than boys--early dating is a strong predictor of smok-
ing later in life (Fidler, West, Jarvis, & Wardle, 2006). Smok-
ing also appears to be the best predictor of sexual risky
behavior in both male and female adolescents (Farid, Rus,
Dahlui, Al-Sadat, & Aziz, 2014).
Given the harmful health consequences of smoking and
drinking, both behaviors can be considered physically risky for
women. In addition, cigarette and alcohol use is still perceived
as masculine behavior (de Visser & McDonnell, 2012; de Vis-
ser & Smith, 2007; Holmila & Raitasalo, 2005; Rolfe, Orford,
& Dalton, 2009), leading to a ``manly'' impression of women
who engage in smoking and drinking (C. Jackson & Tinkler,
2007; Rolfe et al., 2009). As a consequence, smoking and
drinking can also be considered social risk-taking, used by
women to oppose to traditional gender roles.
Current Research
As women engage in male signaling strategies to indicate a short-
term mating orientation to others, we hypothesize that female
cigarette and alcohol use can function as a short-term mating
strategy. Accordingly, we expect that a woman's smoking and
drinking behavior will operate as a perceivable cue that affects
men's perception. As smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol
can be considered physically and socially risky for women, we
believe that a higher cigarette and alcohol consumption will lead
to a more unhealthy and risky impression of a young woman's
overall behavior (Hypothesis 1). Moreover, we expect that men
will perceive women who engage in cigarette and alcohol use as
being more unrestricted in their sexuality (Hypothesis 2). Also,
smoking and drinking will bring attractiveness advantages to
young women (Hypothesis 3). Corresponding with risk-taking
2 Evolutionary Psychology
literature, occasional smoking and drinking behavior--being
moderate risky behaviors--will enhance women's attractiveness
in both short-term and long-term mating contexts (Hypothesis
3a). Heavy smoking and drinking, on the other hand, will bring
attractiveness benefits only in short-term mating situations
(Hypothesis 3b). Additionally, if cigarette and alcohol use
function as a short-term mating strategy because of their phys-
ical or social riskiness, we also believe that the perceived
overall behavioral unhealthiness and riskiness will mediate
men's assessment of women (Hypothesis 4).
Furthermore, for smoking and drinking to operate as a short-
term mating strategy, men's perceptions must correspond with
young women's actual behavior. Therefore, female smokers
and drinkers must be more short-term oriented in their sexual-
ity compared to nonusers (Hypothesis 5). Moreover, we believe
to find a correlation between users' level of sexual unrestrict-
edness and their average cigarette and alcohol consumption
that matches with the results of Hypothesis 2 (Hypothesis 6).
To answer these hypotheses, two studies were conducted.
Study 1: The Perception of Female Smoking
and Drinking Behavior
Design
To investigate how young men assess women's sexual strategy
and attractiveness as a function of their smoking and drinking
behavior, an online between-subjects experiment was con-
ducted. More specifically, a factorial survey approach was
used, in which participants evaluated vignettes (descriptions),
varying (an) experimental factor(s) (Auspurg & Hinz, 2015).
This research approach has already proven successful in the
study of risky behavior (Bassett & Moss, 2004; Kelly & Dun-
bar, 2001; Sylwester & Pawlowski, 2011) and conspicuous
signaling behavior (Sundie et al., 2011).
Participants
In total, 233 young men started the online experiment. Because
of the attractiveness-related questions of Hypothesis 3, partici-
pants with a homosexual orientation as well as participants
outside the young adult age range and participants with largely
incomplete questionnaires were excluded from the data set. The
final sample consisted of 218 men, between the age of 18 and
30 (M ¼ 21.77, SD ¼ 2.37). All participants were Flemish, living
in the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium. In Belgium, it is legal
to sell alcohol to youngsters from 16 years on. Only when buying
liquor, youngsters need to be 18 years. The 16-year-old age
limit also counts for buying cigarettes (www.belgium.be),
making all participants legal consumers of both substances.
Materials and Measures
In this first study, behavioral profiles (vignettes) were created,
describing the hobbies of typical young women in circa 70
words. In total, two behavioral profile sets were created, focus-
ing respectively on smoking and drinking behavior. Each profile
set consisted of three versions, varying the women's smoking or
drinking frequency. All three versions were identical, except for
the last sentence, stating that the person did not use, used occa-
sionally, or used frequently (see Appendix). All participants rated
one version of each behavioral profile set, that is, one smoking
behavioral profile and one drinking behavioral profile.
To distribute these profiles, three online links were created
via the program ``Thesistools,'' each link containing two pro-
files. All three links first showed a smoking profile followed by
a drinking profile, yet varied the behavioral frequencies. For
instance, when opening the first link, participants were asked to
read a behavioral profile in which the target individual smoked
occasionally and one in which she drank alcohol frequently.
To assess the attractiveness of the main character as a func-
tion of her smoking/drinking frequency, participants were
asked the following: ``Based on the profile you just read, how
attractive would you find this person as a potential partner in
the following situations? (a) a short-term relationship (a date,
one-night stand, casual relationship, etc.) and (b) a long-term
relationship (loyal, committed relationship, marriage).'' Both
questions were followed by a 7-point Likert-type scale, ranging
from 1 (not at all attractive) to 7 (very attractive).
To gain insight into the perceived sexual strategy, partici-
pants were asked to fill in the three attitudinal items of the
Sociosexual Orientation Inventory (e.g., Sex without love is
OK.), assessing the level of sexual unrestrictedness (Simpson
& Gangestad, 1991). However, participants were asked to fill
in these questions from the perspective of the main character in
the profile (Sundie et al., 2011): ``To what extent do you think
the person in the profile would agree with the following state-
ments? Answer this question as you think the main character
from the profile would reply.'' Here also, a 7-point Likert-type
scale was used, ranging from 1 (I strongly disagree) to 7
(I strongly agree). A new variable computed the mean score
of the three questions, for both the smoking and drinking pro-
files (asmoking
¼ .81, adrinking
¼ .79). A higher score indicated a
more short-term oriented, unrestricted sexual orientation.
Finally, participants also indicated on a 7-point Likert-type
scale how unhealthy and risky they considered the overall
behavior of the target individual to be: ``Based on the profile
you just read, to what extent do you agree with the following
statements (a) This person behaves in an unhealthy manner and
(b) This person behaves in a risky manner.''
Participants agreeing to take part in the experiment ran-
domly received one of the online links to the different vignette
sets. Participants were first informed that they would be taking
part in an experiment focusing on behavioral perceptions, in
which evaluations of others needed to be made. After confirm-
ing participants' confidentiality and anonymity, all participants
read and rated the behavioral profiles.
Statistical Analysis
In the first study, mixed analyses of variance (mixed ANOVAs)
were conducted to verify Hypotheses 1 and 3. Significant main
effects were reported via pairwise comparisons. Simple effects
Vincke 3
analyses via the SPSS syntax (Field, 2013) were used to discuss
significant interaction effects. To study Hypothesis 2, univari-
ate ANOVAs were conducted, followed by Tukey post hoc
testing. Finally, for Hypothesis 4, mediation analyses were
performed, using Model 4 of the PROCESS procedure of
Hayes (2013; http://www.afhayes.com). Because of the high
correlation between the two potential mediators unhealthi-
ness and riskiness in both profile sets (rsmoking
¼ .58,
p < .001; rdrinking
¼ .56, p < .001), separate mediation anal-
yses were preferred over parallel mediation with two media-
tors (Kenny, Kashy, & Bolger, 1998). In addition, three
dummy variables were created to compare the conditions
of the independent variable ``profile version'': occasional
usage versus no usage, frequent usage versus no usage, and
frequent usage versus occasional usage. Bias-corrected boot-
strapping (with 5,000 bootstrap samples) was used to gener-
ate 95% confidence intervals around the indirect effects of
perceived unhealthiness and riskiness on the SOI and attrac-
tiveness ratings. Mediation is present when the confidence
intervals exclude zero.
Results
The Impact of Smoking and Drinking on Perceived
Behavioral Unhealthiness and Riskiness
To investigate Hypothesis 1, two mixed ANOVAs were con-
ducted: one for the smoking profiles and one for the drinking
profiles. Perceived unhealthiness and riskiness served as
dependent variables in the within-subjects factor ``harmful-
ness.'' Profile version functioned as between-subjects factor,
with the three behavioral frequencies: never, occasional, and
frequent. For both the smoking, F(2, 212) ¼ 15.14, p < .001,
Z2
p
¼ .125, and drinking profiles, F(2, 214) ¼ 7.95, p < .001,
Z2
p
¼ .069, results showed a significant interaction effect
between perceived riskiness and unhealthiness as a function
of usage frequency. Additionally, there was also a significant
main effect of profile version, Fsmoking
(2, 212) ¼ 57.72, p <
.001, Z2
p
¼ .353; Fdrinking
(2, 214) ¼ 63.08, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .371.
For the smoking profiles, the profile version main effect
showed that the vignettes were perceived to be more harmful
as the smoking frequency rose (Mfrequently
¼ 5.01, SDfrequently
¼
1.11; Moccasionally
¼ 3.84, SDoccasionnaly
¼ 1.36; Mnever
¼ 2.92,
SDnever
¼ 1.09; all ps < .001). Simple effects analyses of the
interaction effect (see Figure 1) confirmed that this was the
case for both perceived behavioral riskiness (ps .030) and
unhealthiness (ps < .001).
For the drinking profiles, the main effect of profile version
also showed a higher perceived harmfulness as the drinking
frequency rose (Mfrequently
¼ 4.19, SDfrequently
¼ 1.43;
Moccasionally
¼ 2.69, SDoccasionnaly
¼ 0.92; Mnever
¼ 2.16,
SDnever
¼ 0.96; ps .005). However, the interaction effect
clarified that this was only the case for perceived behavioral
riskiness (ps .002). The occasional drinking profile was not
perceived to be more unhealthy than the nondrinking profile
(p ¼ .110), whereas the frequent drinking profile did score
significantly higher compared to the occasional drinker
(p < .001) and nondrinker (p < .001).
Perceived Sexual Strategy as a Function of Smoking and
Drinking Behavior
To study if men actually use women's smoking and drinking
behavior as a cue to infer sexual strategies (Hypothesis 2), two
ANOVAs were conducted (one for smoking behavior and one
for drinking behavior). The mean SOI score served as depen-
dent variable, whereas profile version--varying between the
three behavioral frequencies never, occasional, and fre-
quent--was used as independent variable.
Results indicated that women's perceived sexual strategy
was affected by their smoking behavior, F(2, 215) ¼ 8.43,
p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .073, and drinking behavior, F(2, 215) ¼
21.17, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .165. More specifically, post hoc analyses
(see Figure 2) showed that both an occasional (p ¼ .012) and
frequent smoker (p < .001) were perceived as significantly
more short-term oriented in their sexuality compared to a non-
smoker. However, there were no significant differences
between the two smoking frequencies (p ¼ .599). Similarly,
frequent (p < .001) and occasional drinkers (p ¼ .010) were
perceived as significantly more sexually unrestricted compared
to a nondrinker. Additionally, a frequent alcohol user was also
regarded as having a more short-term-oriented mating tactic
compared to an occasional drinker (p ¼ .001).
Attractiveness as a Function of Smoking and Drinking
Behavior
Two mixed ANOVAs were conducted (one for smoking beha-
vior and one for drinking behavior) to verify if women's short-
term and long-term attractiveness is affected differently
depending on their smoking and drinking frequency. Short-
term and long-term attractiveness functioned as the dependent
variables in the within-subjects factor ``attractiveness.'' Profile
version (i.e., the three behavioral frequencies) was used as
between-subjects factor.

For the smoking profiles, results showed a significant main
effect of the within-subjects factor ``attractiveness,'' F(1, 215)
¼ 276.40, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .562, and between-subjects factor
profile version, F(2, 215) ¼ 28.21, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .208. Also a
significant interaction was present between a women's short-
term and long-term attractiveness as a function of her smoking
frequency, F(2, 215) ¼ 5.08, p ¼ .007, Z2
p
¼ .045.
According to the profile version main effect, both a non-
smoker (M ¼ 4.55, SD ¼ 1.21, p < .001) and occasional smoker
(M ¼ 4.27, SD ¼ 1.31, p < .001) were significantly more
attractive than a frequent smoker (M ¼ 3.09, SD ¼ 1.21), with
no differences between a nonsmoker and occasional smoker
(p ¼ .176). The interaction effect (see Figure 3) confirmed
these findings for short-term attractiveness, with no significant
differences between the nonsmoking and occasional smoking
profile (p ¼ .814), and frequent cigarette use being less desir-
able in a short-term mating partner (ps < .001). However, both
occasional (p ¼ .010) and frequent smoking (p < .001) did harm
a woman's long-term attractiveness compared to not smoking,
occasional smoking being more attractive than frequent smoking
(p < .001). In addition, the main effect of the within-subjects
factor showed that overall, the smoking profiles received higher
short-term attractiveness (M ¼ 4.87, SD ¼ 1.60) than long-term
attractiveness ratings (M ¼ 3.07, SD ¼ 1.62). The simple effect
analyses of the interaction effect confirmed that short-term
attractiveness scores exceeded the long-term attractiveness rat-
ings in all three profiles (ps < .001).
For the alcohol profiles, findings showed a significant main
effect of profile version, F(2, 215) ¼ 8.96, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .077,
as well as a significant interaction effect between short-term
and long-term attractiveness and the drinking frequency, F(2,
215) ¼ 17.08, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .137.
The profile version main effect showed that occasional
drinking (M ¼ 5.35, SD ¼ 1.03) was perceived as more attrac-
tive than both not drinking (M ¼ 4.50, SD ¼ 1.48, p < .001) and
drinking frequently (M ¼ 4.90, SD ¼ 1.08, p ¼ .034). Drinking
frequently was considered slightly more attractive than not
drinking (p ¼ .048). However, when looking at the interaction
effect (see Figure 3), this pattern differed for short-term and
long-term attractiveness. More specifically, both an occasional
(p ¼ .003) and frequent drinker (p < .001) were perceived as
more desirable for short-term mating than a nondrinker, with
no significant differences between the two alcohol using pro-
files (p ¼ .276). Yet, the attractiveness benefits of heavy drink-
ing faded in a long-term mating context. Only occasional
drinking enhanced a woman's long-term attractiveness com-
pared to not drinking (p < .001) and frequent drinking
(p < .001). Not drinking and drinking frequently did not differ
(p ¼ .432). Additional follow-up analyses of the interaction
effect showed that there were no differences between a
woman's short-term and long-term desirability in the nondrink-
ing condition (p ¼ .144). An occasional drinker, on the other
hand, was more attractive as a long-term partner (p ¼ .006),
whereas a frequent drinker was more desirable as a short-term
than a long-term partner (p < .001).
The Influence of Perceived Riskiness and Unhealthiness
on Male Impressions
To investigate if men's perceptions are affected by the per-
ceived behavioral riskiness (Hypothesis 4), mediation analyses
were conducted. The SOI scores, short-term attractiveness, and
long-term attractiveness were used separately as outcome vari-
ables (Y). The three dummy variables of the profile versions
served as independent variables (X) and covariates, with per-
ceived unhealthiness and riskiness as the two (separate) med-
iators (M).
Results (see Table 1) showed significant positive indirect
effects of the smoking and drinking frequency on the perceived
level of sexual unrestrictedness, through unhealthiness and ris-
kiness perceptions. These findings indicate that as the smoking
and drinking frequency increased, the perceived behavioral
unhealthiness and riskiness rose, leading to a more sexually
unrestricted impression of the young woman. Only for occa-
sional drinking, no mediation via perceived unhealthiness was
found. In addition, in the smoking profiles, no significant indi-
rect effects were present for short-term and long-term attrac-
tiveness. However, for drinking alcohol, perceived behavioral
riskiness did mediate women's short-term and long-term

desirability in a positive manner. Accordingly, a higher drink-
ing frequency led to a more risky impression, enhancing a
woman's attractiveness.
Discussion
The findings of the first experimental study showed that both
smoking and drinking could be considered unhealthy and risky
behaviors that influence men's perceptions. First of all, both
behaviors functioned as a cue for women's short-term sexual
strategy. Additionally, frequent drinking brought short-term
attractiveness benefits to women, whereas a similar trend was
visible for occasional smoking. These results indicate that cigar-
ette and (especially) alcohol use could function as a female
short-term mating strategy. However, for this mating strategy
to work, women's behavior must correspond with men's percep-
tions. Therefore, a second survey study was conducted.
The Sexual Strategy of Young Female
Smokers and Drinkers
Design
The aim of the second study was to investigate if young women
who use cigarettes and alcohol are more unrestricted in their
sexuality compared to nonusers (Hypothesis 5) and to verify if
there is a correlation between the level of sexual unrestricted-
ness and the behavioral frequency of users, similar to men's
perceptions (Hypothesis 6). To answer these hypotheses, an
online survey was carried out assessing young women's

6 Evolutionary Psychology
smoking and drinking behavior as well as their mating strategy.
Corresponding with large surveys on substance use, (Johnston,
O'Malley, Bachman, Schulenberg, & Miech, 2014; Steketee,
Jonkman, Berten, & Vettenburg, 2013), both the frequency and
average consumption of cigarettes and alcohol were measured.
Respondents
The final sample consisted of 202 Flemish young women
between the age of 18 and 30 years old (M ¼ 21.39, SD ¼
2.5). Of this sample, 16.8% smoked cigarettes (n ¼ 34). Almost
all women indicated drinking alcohol (91.1%), with only a
small group never drinking any alcohol (n ¼ 18).
Measures
The questionnaire started by asking the respondents if they
sometimes smoked or drank alcohol. Additionally, the smoking
and drinking frequency of users was measured by questioning
on how many days in the previous month they had smoked
cigarettes or drank alcohol. Answers were given on a 7-point
scale with fixed categories (not a single day, 1­2 days, 3­5
days, 6­9 days, 10­19 days, 20­29 days, and all days). Subse-
quently, average weekly consumption was assessed by asking
how often respondents smoked cigarettes or drank alcohol on
average per week. This was measured with an 8-point scale
(less than 1 cigarette a week, 1­3 cigarettes a week, 4­10
cigarettes a week, 11­20 cigarettes a week, 1­3 cigarettes a
day, 4­10 cigarettes a day, 11­20 cigarettes a day, and more
than 20 cigarettes a day). The same frequency categories were
used for alcoholic drinks.
To assess young women's level of sexual unrestrictedness,
the Revised Sociosexual Inventory (Sociosexual Orientation
Inventory (SOI)-R; Penke & Asendorpf, 2008) was used. This
inventory consists of nine questions, addressing a person's atti-
tude toward casual sex (e.g., Sex without love is OK.), their
sexual desires (e.g., How often do you have fantasies about
having sex with someone with whom you do not have a com-
mitted romantic relationship?), and past behavioral experi-
ences (e.g., With how many different partners have you had
sex within the past 12 months?). Additionally, the Short-Term
Mating Orientation (STMO) Scale and Long-Term Mating
Orientation (LTMO) Scale were added, measuring both
short-term and long-term mating tendencies separately via
statements (Jackson & Kirkpatrick, 2007). The STMO contains
10 statements (e.g., Sometimes I would rather have sex with
someone I do not care about.), whereas the LTMO consists of
seven questions (e.g., I hope to have a romantic relationship
that lasts the rest of my life.). All scales had sufficient internal
consistency (aSOI-R
¼ .83, aSTMO
¼ .89, aLTMO
¼ .75).
Statistical Analyses
Mann­Whitney tests were used to verify if the mating strategy
of smokers and drinkers differs from nonusers (Hypothesis 5).
This nonparametric variant for testing two groups was chosen
because of the large differences in sample sizes between users
and nonusers, combined with a violation of the normality
assumption for some groups. Second, one-tailed correlations
were conducted to verify if users' level of sexual unrestricted-
ness rises with their smoking and drinking frequency (Hypoth-
esis 6). As respondents indicated their frequency and average
alcohol and cigarette consumption on a scale with fixed answer
categories, the nonparametric correlation measure ``Spearman
rho,'' suited for ordinal variables, was opted for.
Results
Three Mann­Whitney tests were conducted for both smokers
and drinkers, with being a user/nonuser as independent variable
and the SOI-R, STMO, and LTMO as dependent variables.
Results showed that smokers (Mdn ¼ 3.56) scored significantly
higher on the SOI-R compared to nonsmokers (Mdn ¼ 2.67),
indicating a higher level of sexual unrestrictedness (U ¼ 2,097,
z ¼ À2.44, p ¼ .015, r ¼ À.17). No significant differences
were found for the STMO (U ¼ 2,451, z ¼ À1.21, p ¼ .227,
r ¼ À.09) and LTMO Scales (U ¼ 2,696.5, z ¼ À0.41,
p ¼ .682, r ¼ À.03). For drinking alcohol, the STMO Scale
showed that drinkers (Mdn ¼ 3.10) were more short-term
oriented in their sexuality than nondrinkers (Mdn ¼ 2.40),
U ¼ 1,045, z ¼ À2.53, p ¼ .011, r ¼ À.18. A similar non-
significant trend was found via the SOI-R (U ¼ 1,246.5,
z ¼ À1.73, p ¼ .083, r ¼ À.12), with a higher level of sexual
unrestrictedness for drinkers (Mdn ¼ 2.78) than nondrinkers
(Mdn ¼ 2.39). Finally, also the LTMO Scale indicated a trend
in which nondrinkers (Mdn ¼ 4.64) were more long-term
oriented in their sexuality than drinkers (Mdn ¼ 4.57;
U ¼ 1,182, z ¼ À1.95, p ¼ .051, r ¼ À.14).
In addition, Spearman one-tailed correlations between the
usage of smokers and drinkers (frequency and average con-
sumption) and their level of sexual unrestrictedness were con-
ducted. Results found no clear correlation between users'
smoking frequency and their level of sexual unrestrictedness,
measured by the SOI-R, STMO, or LTMO. Only the average
smoking behavior correlated significantly with the SOI-R
Scale, showing a medium positive relation (rs
¼ .34,
p ¼ .025). For alcohol use, on the other hand, results showed
that women who drank more frequently and who had a higher
average consumption also had higher scores on the SOI-R and
vice versa (rs frequency
¼ .38, p < .001; rs average
¼ .36, p < .001).
This medium positive correlation was also found when looking
at the STMO Scale (rs frequency
¼ .36, p < .001; rs average
¼ .28,
p < .001). Finally, also the small negative correlation between
alcohol consumption and the LTMO indicated that drinking
regularly is linked to being less long-term oriented sexually
(rs frequency
¼ À.11, p ¼ .065; rs average
¼ À.139, p ¼ .031).
Discussion: Study 2
Results of this follow-up study confirmed that young women
who smoke and drink are more unrestricted in their sexuality
compared to nonusers. Additionally, a higher alcohol
Vincke 7
consumption was positively correlated with a higher level of
sexual unrestrictedness. Young women's cigarette consump-
tion, on the other hand, was associated less with their level of
sexual unrestrictedness. These findings correspond with men's
perceptions, making no distinction between the sexual strategy
of occasional and frequent smokers, although perceiving heavy
and occasional drinkers differently.
General Discussion
Despite the more harmful health effects of cigarette and alcohol
use for women, the traditional gender gap in smoking and
drinking behavior is closing in well-developed countries.
Therefore, this article explored if female smoking and drinking
can operate as a short-term mating strategy. By means of an
experiment, we studied if cigarette and alcohol use affected the
perceived overall unhealthiness and riskiness of women's
behavior (Hypothesis 1), if men perceived young female smo-
kers and drinkers as more sexually unrestricted (Hypothesis 2),
if smoking and drinking brought attractiveness benefits
(Hypothesis 3), and if men's perceptions were mediated by the
perceived behavioral unhealthiness and riskiness (Hypothesis
4). A follow-up study verified if men's perceptions corre-
sponded with women's actual behavior and sexual strategy
(Hypotheses 5 and 6).
Consistent with Hypothesis 2 and previous literature (Kou-
kounas et al., 2014; Lindgren et al., 2008; Parks & Scheidt,
2000), the experiment confirmed that women who smoke and
drink were actually perceived as being more unrestricted in
their sexuality compared to nonusers. However, the extent to
which women smoke did not affect their impression, whereas a
frequent drinker was perceived as more short-term oriented
compared to an occasional drinker.
In addition, drinking enhanced women's attractiveness. As
stated in Hypothesis 3a, drinking occasionally was considered
more desirable in a woman than not drinking, both in a short-
term and long-term mating context. Moreover, confirming
Hypothesis 3b, frequent drinking was also perceived as more
attractive than not drinking but only for short-term mating. For
smoking, only a trend was visible, in which short-term attrac-
tiveness benefits were limited to not harming women's desir-
ability. More specifically, an occasional female smoker was
considered equally attractive by men as a nonsmoker but only
in short-term mating contexts. A woman's long-term attractive-
ness, on the other hand, was negatively affected when smoking
occasionally. Smoking frequently was found the least appeal-
ing in both mating contexts.
These attractiveness findings of drinking alcohol correspond
with general risk-taking literature showing that heavy physical
and social risk-taking are attractive only in short-term mating
contexts (Bassett & Moss, 2004; Sylwester & Pawlowski,
2011), whereas moderate risk-taking can also be advantageous
for long-term mating (Farthing, 2007). Moreover, as moderate
drinking is often driven by social motivations and used for
bonding with others (de Visser, Wheeler, Abraham, & Smith,
2013; Kuntsche, Knibbe, Gmel, & Engels, 2005), this might
also be a preferred characteristic in a long-term romantic part-
ner, explaining the high attractiveness of occasional drinking.
Finally, similar results were found in a recent study, showing
that a person's general (i.e., long-term) attractiveness increased
when drinking a moderate amount of alcohol, yet decreased
when drinking more (Van Den Abbeele, Penton-Voak, Att-
wood, Stephen, & Munafo, 2015).
The second study confirmed the male perceptions of Study 1
(Hypothesis 5), showing that users of cigarettes and alcohol
were more short-term oriented in their mating strategy than
nonusers. These results also agree with studies linking higher
mating efforts to smoking and drinking behavior, in both men
and women (Hone & McCullough, 2015; Hone et al., 2013;
Jones & Figueredo, 2007). Furthermore, the survey revealed
that female users' level of sexual unrestrictedness was not con-
sistently correlated with their smoking frequency, yet was
clearly related to their alcohol consumption. This also matches
with the male impressions of Study 1, in which female smokers
were perceived as being more short-term oriented independent
of their smoking frequency, whereas their impression was
affected by the drinking frequency.
These findings show that female smoking and drinking
behavior are perceivable short-term mating cues, affecting a
woman's attractiveness. In addition, there appears to be a clear
link between a woman's sexual orientation and her cigarette
and alcohol consumption. Yet, the question remains why. On
the one hand, results indicated that smoking and drinking can
be considered unhealthy and risky behaviors, affecting the
overall behavioral impression of women. On the other hand,
Hypothesis 4, verifying if men's perceptions are actually
mediated by the perceived behavioral unhealthiness and riski-
ness, was only partially confirmed. As expected, the perceived
sexual strategy was mediated in a positive manner. Accord-
ingly, a higher smoking and drinking frequency led to a more
sexually unrestricted impression through a higher perceived
unhealthiness and riskiness. However, perceived riskiness only
mediated the short-term and long-term attractiveness of the
alcohol profiles, with no significant mediating effects on the
attractiveness ratings of the smoking profiles. The fact that a
higher perceived riskiness of drinking alcohol enhanced a
woman's short-term desirability corresponds with scientific
literature, showing that drinking alcohol can be considered
socially risky behavior in women (cf. supra), increasing
women's short-term desirability (Sylwester & Pawlowski,
2011). Moreover, it could also indicate a higher willingness
to take sexual risks. The finding that a higher perceived riski-
ness also raised a woman's long-term attractiveness was rather
unexpected. Possibly, this could point out that the perceived
riskiness of drinking behavior remained rather moderate.
In the theoretical part, we mentioned that smoking and
drinking might function as a short-term mating strategy
because of its' masculine connotation (Sylwester &
Pawlowski, 2011). According to the social role theory, male
and female gender roles are learned through cultural transmis-
sion and socialization. Consequently, women would also be
socialized through these gender roles to find unhealthy
8 Evolutionary Psychology
consumption behaviors masculine (Eagly & Wood, 1999; Wal-
dron, 1997). Although we agree with this cultural approach in
that women can use masculine behavior to signal information
about themselves to others, we believe that it is not cultural
transmission that makes smoking, drinking, and other risk-
taking typically male behavior. All over the world, young men
engage most in risk-taking behavior (Kruger & Nesse, 2004).
Moreover, as testosterone levels correlate with these risky
behaviors, there appear to be biological determinants present
(Ronay & Hippel, 2010; Saad & Vongas, 2009; Stenstrom,
Saad, Nepomuceno, & Mendenhall, 2011; Sylwester &
Pawlowski, 2011). Furthermore, these biological determinants
are also found in women. For instance, unrestricted women
appear more masculine in body, behavior, and mind (Campbell
et al., 2009; Clark, 2004; Mikach & Bailey, 1999), while hav-
ing higher testosterone levels (Edelstein, Chopik, & Kean,
2011; van Anders, Hamilton, & Watson, 2007). However, we
do believe that cultural transmission affects which behaviors
are considered suitable signaling behavior. Applied to this
research, we believe that the positive perception of drinkers
and drinking and the more negative discourse about smoking
partly explain why alcohol confirms our expectations more
than using cigarettes.
Due to alterations in the brain chemistry, low levels of
alcohol reduce stress, create a positive mood, and make peo-
ple less inhibited. Consequently, moderate drinkers are often
more socially unrestricted and pleasant (Mitchell et al., 2012;
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 2010).
In addition, moderate alcohol consumption is often perceived
as positive, due to studies indicating that occasional, moder-
ate drinking can have positive effects on one's health (Di
Castelnuovo et al., 2006; Ellison, 2007; Gutjahr, Gmel, &
Rehm, 2001; Koppes et al., 2005). Although recent research
contradicts these health improving qualities of moderate
alcohol consumption (Chikritzhs et al., 2015; Fekjær, 2013;
Stockwell et al., 2016), the idea is still present among many
consumers. Also, youngsters are confronted with a large
amount of advertisements, in which attractive people pro-
mote alcoholic beverages (Gunter, Hansen, & Touri, 2008;
Snyder, Milici, Slater, Sun, & Strizhakova, 2006). Accord-
ingly, drinking alcohol is widely accepted, with more than
90% of Flemish college and university students using alcohol
(Lorant, Nicaise, Soto, & d'Hoore, 2013; Rosiers et al.,
2014).
The discourse on smoking, on the other hand, is much more
negative, as the dangers of cigarette use are stressed in many
communications (e.g., in Belgium, every package of cigarettes
contains a warning) and cigarette advertising is often no longer
allowed. Additionally, although smoking briefly stimulates the
smoker's mind (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2016), it
does not have the same inhibiting effects as alcohol on the
user's behavior. Consequently, smoking is not always regarded
in a positive manner (Chassin, Presson, Sherman, & Kim,
2003; Piko, Bak, & Gibbons, 2007), leading to ``only'' 30%
of the Flemish university and college students smoking cigar-
ettes (Rosiers et al., 2014).
Future Research and Limitations
First of all, the first study did not take into account the smoking
and drinking behavior of the participants. Consequently, in a
future study, it would be relevant to find out if users and nonu-
sers perceive smokers and drinkers differently. Furthermore,
the first study measured the perceived unhealthiness and riski-
ness of the behavioral profiles, yet did not explicitly focus on
social riskiness. Also, the behavioral profiles of the first study
described an active lifestyle. Future research could verify if
men's perception of young women as a function of their smok-
ing and drinking behavior differs when other characteristics are
described. Moreover, we would also propose future studies to
focus on the quantity of smoking and drinking behavior, next to
the frequency. After all, the amount of alcohol and cigarettes
used on one occasion could also have a high impact on people's
impression, especially when considering a short-term sexual
relationship. In our second survey study, we only had a limited
number of young women who abstained from drinking or who
choose to smoke. Although the lower amount of nondrinkers
and smokers corresponds with recent studies (Lorant et al.,
2013; Rosiers et al., 2014), and special care was given to the
statistical assumptions, future studies should verify if the same
results are present in larger samples.
Finally, the findings indicate that female smoking and drink-
ing can operate as a short-term mating strategy. However, the
studies in this article are limited to exploring this hypothesis,
showing that female smoking and drinking functions as a per-
ceivable cue, affecting women's attractiveness. Moreover, it
also shows that women's smoking and drinking behavior cor-
responds with this cue. However, more research is necessary to
find out if this link between cigarette/alcohol use and short-
term mating is an actual signaling system, in which the cues are
meant to indicate a short-term mating orientation (STMO)
(Donath, 2007). Corresponding with research on luxury con-
sumption as a signaling system (Hudders, De Backer, Fisher, &
Vyncke, 2014; Wang & Griskevicius, 2014), studies verifying
if short-term mating motivations stimulate smoking and drink-
ing behavior in women are necessary. In addition, more
research is necessary to clarify if smoking and drinking is
rather intentional than unintentional, rather implicit than expli-
cit communicative signaling strategy. However, women's
smoking and drinking does not have to be conscious and delib-
erate for these behaviors to function as a sexually strategic
signal.
Conclusion and Implications
In conclusion, findings showed that smoking and (especially)
drinking can operate as a short-term mating strategy, function-
ing as a mating cue and bringing attractiveness benefits in
short-term mating contexts. As the traditional gender gap in
youth smoking and drinking is closing, and given the harmful-
ness of both behaviors to women, these findings are of interest
to social marketing professionals and institutions addressing
youth cigarette and alcohol use. Not only do these findings give
Vincke 9
insight into less obvious female behavioral motivations, it also
show that emphasizing physical or social risks (e.g., in social
marketing campaigns) in order to prevent smoking and drink-
ing might not always have the desired effect. Even more, it may
turn out to be contra productive.
