Introduction
Resilience, or the ability to maintain or regain mental health,
despite significant adversity (Cicchetti & Garmezy, 1993),
has thus far been studied primarily in children and adoles-
cents. Many types of adversity can be experienced by chil-
dren, including physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, as
well as neglect and exposure to family violence. All of these
types are subsumed under the general term of child maltreat-
ment (CM). CM has been shown to be a significant health
determinant, leading to increased mortality and morbidity,
including physical health problems, mental disorders, poor
academic performance, aggression, crime, suicidal behavior,
and decreased quality of life (Gilbert et al., 2009). Most
research conducted thus far on CM has been cross-sectional
in nature or has had follow-up of only a few years after the
time of CM. Little is known about the long-term effects of
CM or the factors that contribute to resilience in later life in
those with a history of CM.
The concept of resilience is not new, although there has
been a recent burgeoning of research interest in this area. In
fact, more than 85% of all research publications on resilience
have appeared in the last decade (Hjemdal, 2007). Early
research on resilience focused on the identification of particu-
lar qualities and personality traits, such as hardiness and self-
efficacy, which help people to overcome adversity (Cicchetti
& Garmezy, 1993). More recent research has focused on the
process by which the qualities of resilience are acquired over
time and on the natural fluctuations that occur across the life
span. The latter may depend on the balance of stressors and
protective, compensatory, or resilience factors. This recent
research has led to a shift in the predominant view of resil-
ience from that of an innate or inherited quality to one that is
more dynamic, contextual, and acquired. A recent conference
of resilience researchers defined resilience as "a dynamic pro-
cess in which psychological, social, environmental, and bio-
logical factors interact to make an individual, at any stage of
life, to develop, maintain or regain their mental health despite
exposure to adversity" (PreVAiL, 2011).
The more recent conceptualizations of resilience view it
as an interactive dynamic process that develops through a
repetitive process of disruption and reintegration in response
to adverse events (Richardson, 2002). Through this process,
it is postulated that psychological protective factors that
facilitate positive adaptation to subsequent adverse life
events develop, thereby promoting positive mental health,
which may wax and wane across the life span. Successful
adaptation to later life requires this resilience to face the mul-
tiple and almost inevitable challenges of this life stage, such
as those related to health, socioeconomic circumstances,
relationships, and employment status.
Previous research suggests that many elderly people view
themselves as having aged successfully, despite the presence
of chronic disease and disability (Depp, Vahia, & Jeste, 2010).

Resilience in Elderly Survivors
of Child Maltreatment
Danielle Rodin1 and Donna E. Stewart1
Abstract
Resilience is a multifaceted construct that refers to the positive adaptation of individuals, despite exposure to adversity.This
study of resilience in older individuals who have experienced adversity was conducted to deepen the understanding of the
factors that contribute to resilience in this population. This qualitative study used purposive and homogeneous sampling
criteria to recruit nine participants above the age of 65 with a past history of childhood maltreatment who were judged by
their health care professionals to be unusually resilient.Resilience was found to be highly evident in this sample,despite earlier
trauma and the subsequent challenges of old age.The authors found active engagement in relationships and in valued activities
to be the most often mentioned contributors to resilience in these older survivors of childhood maltreatment.These findings
have important implications for public policy and social interventions to preserve the well-being of older individuals who have
experienced adversity.

These findings suggest that resilience may persist or emerge in
the elderly, despite the multiple stressors associated with ill-
ness and health limitations (Montross et al., 2006). With the
demographic shift toward older age in developed countries, it
becomes particularly important to understand those factors
that contribute to successful aging. Those who have been
exposed to early life adversity, such as CM, may have acquired
resilience and/or may still be suffering from its sequelae in
later life (Widom, Dumont, & Czaja, 2007), thereby affecting
their adjustment to the losses of old age.
Successful Aging
The World Health Organization (WHO) describes active
aging as "the process of optimizing opportunities for health,
participation, and security in order to enhance quality of life
as people age" (WHO, 2002, p. 12). This refers to the adap-
tive process that allows individuals to achieve their own life
goals and to maintain competence as they age. The chal-
lenges of old age pass through what has been conceptualized
as the "lens" (Hochhalter, Smith, & Ory, 2011) of an indi-
vidual's personal resources, values, and attitudes, all of
which affect the outcome of adaptation. Successful aging
may depend on the preservation of the "building blocks" of
identity (Kaufman, 1986) as well as the capacity to adapt
flexibly to the challenges that threaten competence, well-
being, and social engagement.
The concepts of resiliency and survivorship have been
used in understanding the successful recovery from trau-
matic events, but have not been widely explored in elderly
survivors of CM. In one study of elderly Holocaust survi-
vors, a paradigm shift was identified as these individuals
aged, with their primary focus shifting from rebuilding their
lives to maintaining their competence (Greene & Graham,
2009). Other quantitative studies in different populations of
older people have identified characteristics that may contrib-
ute to resilience. These include sociodemographic factors
(Beutel, Glaesmer, Decker, Fischbeck, & Brahler, 2009;
Fiske, Wetherell, & Gatz, 2009), health and well-being
(Reichstadt, Depp, Palinkas, Folsom, & Jeste, 2007; Wells
2009), positive attitudes (Lamond et al., 2008), self-esteem
(Windle, Markland, & Woods, 2008), and a sense of mastery
(Low, Keating, & Gao, 2009; Montross et al., 2006).
Furthermore, embeddedness in a social community (Hildon,
Montgomery, Blane, Wiggins, & Netuveli, 2010), religious
affiliation (Costanzo, Ryff, & Singer, 2009; June, Segal,
Coolidge, & Klebe, 2009), and the presence of supportive
relationships (Beutel et al., 2009; Gergen, 2009) may con-
tribute to resilience in older individuals.
Gender differences in resilience in the elderly have
received only a small amount of research attention. A longi-
tudinal study of Israeli Jews aged 75 to 94 found that men
were more physically active, had better cognition, gave more
help to children, relied less on paid caretakers, and attended
synagogue more than women (Walter-Girtzburg, Shmotkin,
Blumstein, & Shorek, 2005). However, it is not known if
their lesser reliance on paid caregivers was a result of the
care they received from their wives and daughters, which
may have been less available to elderly women, many of
whom are widows. In a later study of rural Americans aged
65 and older, women reported fewer health problems that
interfered with daily functioning and were more likely than
men to report that relationships, frame of mind, participation
in activities and religion, and spiritual activities were impor-
tant contributions to successful aging (Stark-Wroblewski,
Edelbaum, & Bello, 2008).
Current Study
CM has been associated with a wide range of subsequent
psychological disturbances and psychiatric disorders in
childhood. These include attention deficit hyperactivity dis-
order, oppositional disorder, anxiety, mood, and substance
use disorders, and disturbances in affect regulation and
attachment (Affifi, Boman, Fleisher, & Sareen, 2009; Affifi
et al., 2008; Cicchetti & Toth, 2005; Fergusson, Boden, &
Horwood, 2008; Gilbert et al., 2009). CM is also associated
with an increased risk in adulthood of depression, anxiety,
substance abuse, personality disorders, and antisocial behav-
ior (Johnson et al., 2001; MacMillan et al., 2001; Widom
et al., 2007). In adults who experienced CM, resilience was
found in those who reported better perceived parental care,
adolescent peer relationships, and quality of adult love rela-
tionships (Collishaw et al., 2007).
Resilience research has the potential to elucidate the
mechanisms that contribute to successful adaptation, psy-
chological growth, and adverse mental health outcomes.
Some research has been conducted regarding the effects of
CM in childhood, but little has been known about their long-
term consequences in older adults. In particular, little is
known about the characteristics of older adults who have
achieved and maintained resilience, despite exposure to CM.
Such information may be of value to educators, health care
providers, and policy makers to promote resilience across
the life span. Greater understanding of individual and con-
textual risk factors, and of the social determinants of health
may lead to more effective prevention and treatment
interventions.
The present study will explore resilience in older indi-
viduals who have coped well with previous trauma, specifi-
cally CM, to gain an understanding of the factors contributing
to their resilience. Focusing on individuals with past adver-
sity who have demonstrated resilience may enhance our
understanding of this phenomenon and how it is altered by
the transformations of old age.
Method
Research Design
A qualitative research design was employed to explore what
factors or circumstances throughout their lives are considered
Rodin and Stewart 3
by older individuals, who had coped successfully with prior
CM, to have contributed to their resilience. A qualitative
approach was considered to be most useful in this context to
understand the experience and perceptions of such individuals
with regard to aging, and the factors they attributed to their
resiliency. Interview methodology of this kind generates undi-
luted, in-depth narratives (McKague & Verhoef, 2003), which
may reveal novel information about the study variables,
which could not be elicited by predetermined qualitative mea-
sures. Interviews also allow researchers to probe for clarifica-
tions on unique perspectives and experiences on potentially
sensitive issues. All interviews were digitally recorded and
transcribed. This project received ethics approval from the
University Health Network Research Ethics Board (Toronto,
Ontario, Canada).
Research Methods
Purposive and homogeneous sampling criteria were used to
recruit men and women above the age of 65 living in
Toronto, Canada, with a past history of CM, and who were
judged by their health care professionals to be remarkably
resilient. As the frequency of exposure to CM is comparable
in both sexes, (Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics, 2007),
we sought to include men and women in our sample.
Exclusion criteria included a history of any psychiatric ill-
ness. Ten health care workers (physicians and social work-
ers) at a large university teaching hospital were approached
to recommend patients in their practice who met study crite-
ria and who could be invited to participate. Most elderly
people have fairly regular contact with the health care sys-
tem and have built relationships with their health care pro-
viders over many years. The health care workers may be
aware of their past history of abuse and, being aware of their
physical and mental functioning, could assess their patients'
resilience. Although resilience has been defined differently
throughout the literature, this article adopted the definition
of resilience suggested by Cicchetti and Garmezy (1993) as
positive adaptation, despite exposure to adversity.
Health care professionals contacted potential participants
to request participation in the study and their willingness to
allow their contact information to be shared with the study
investigator. Recruitment was continued until saturation of the
themes was achieved. In qualitative data, it has been noted that
"five to eight data sources of sampling units will often suffice
for a homogenous sample" (Kuzel, 1999, p. 42).
All participants who granted permission to their health
care professional to be identified were contacted by the first
author and explained the purpose, methodology, and require-
ments of the study. Participants provided written, informed
consent to participate in the study and to audiotape the inter-
view. All potential participants who agreed to be contacted
regarding participation in the study provided such consent
and completed the interviews.
MeasurementTools
In-depth, semistructured interviews of 60 to 90 min in dura-
tion focused on the meaning, perception, and experience of
resilience and resilient processes throughout their lives fol-
lowing exposure to CM. Specific strategies were used to
enhance the rigor of data collection, including the use of an
interview guide with probes to elucidate emerging themes
and concepts, digital recording, and field notes.
Analysis
Qualitative data were organized and analyzed in iterative
phases of discovery, coding, and discounting using NVivo.
The analytic technique of constant comparison was applied
within and between interviews to refine the analysis (Taylor
& Bogdan, 1998). This technique involves open coding of
transcripts and field notes and grouping segments of text
into categories and subcategories.
Statements by participants were compared for similarities
under a theme and/or a concept within and between inter-
views. Constant comparison led to collapse and/or expansion
of the earlier categories. Analytic induction through an
emphasis on the search for negative cases allowed for testing
of emergent hypotheses. This methodology enhanced the
transferability of the findings, despite the small number of
studied cases, and helped to move the analysis from descrip-
tion to interpretation.
Results
A total of five women and four men were recruited for this
study, which allowed for a clear saturation level of the
themes to emerge. The demographics of the study popula-
tion are presented in Table 1, with pseudonyms used to refer
to the participants in the remainder of this article.
The interviews elicited rich histories of the lives of nine
remarkable individuals who have successfully overcome
CM and flourished in old age. These individuals varied in
age (ranging from 67 to 90 years old), education level, and
religion. They all experienced CM, although it varied in
nature and included physical abuse, emotional abuse,
neglect, and exposure to violence between their parents.
None of the respondents reported sexual abuse. In addition,
more than half of the respondents shared the experience of
living through hardships associated with World War II, in
which they lost loved ones, experienced scarcity and hunger,
and lived in fear for their safety. This additional trauma,
which we had not anticipated on recruitment, added to the
remarkable history of this group.
Each participant became emotionally distraught when
describing his or her CM maltreatment and how he or she
believed it affected him or her. However, they were all able
to reflect on their childhood with insight and describe how
4 SAGE Open
they traversed and survived this difficult period. Participants
retained a sense of perspective and even humor about their
past and present situations. They also often displayed play-
fulness in their responses to questions. When Michael, who
had advanced lymphoma, was asked whether he found it
helpful to make future plans, he chuckled and said, "I don't
plan anymore, they're planning for me!"
This article will focus on the most prominent contributors
to resilience that were identified as these individuals moved
through the life cycle to old age. Certain gender differences
were notable, in that the women emphasized relationships
and social interactions, whereas the men tended to place
greater emphasis on solitary activities. The participants
themselves also commented on the differences in resilience
that they perceived between men and women. Janis said that
she believed that, "probably the majority of women look to
other women for support, whereas men are not supposed to
look outside for help." Sam seemed to agree with Janis's line
of thinking when he said:
Women are too emotional. Gets 'em into trouble, like
my wife. Too much talk, talk, talk. Guys play sports or
take a hike, walk the dog. It's better. Action oriented.
Despite some gender differences, respondents identified
six broad themes as major contributors to resilience in the
face of prior trauma and in coping with the new challenges of
old age: social support, psychological attributes, financial
security, health, spirituality, and engagement. Most partici-
pants referred to these themes in their responses, but the
theme of engagement in their present life was most consis-
tently identified as important by the study participants.
All participants reported the experience of meaningful
social support during their childhood and in their adult life,
even during the period of CM. The theme of social support
emerged in their description of their relationships with their
own parents, romantic relationships and partnerships, teach-
ers, social networks and interactions, community integra-
tion, and in a sense of belonging. Many described childhood
support as molding their sense of resilience in adulthood.
Harriet, whose mother died when she was aged 4, describes
the perceived effect of her mother's nurturing:
I think the reason that I survived and that I seem to be
comparatively normal and stable and I managed to not
have any mental problems and to try and deal with my
background is that my mother, she was an orphan her-
self, was very beautiful and a very loving mother. She
always, apparently from what I hear, took wonderful
care of us. She sewed clothes for us and knitted and
was very, very attentive, so I think being loved like
that until the age of about three and a half was a tre-
mendous thing. I think it's something that . . . if a child
had this at a young age, it can carry them through life.
Because people experience more losses of loved ones as
they age, the sources of support can take different forms.
Sam identified his dogs as his major source of comfort and
resilience:
I've always had a dog, usually a German shepherd,
ever since I was a kid. I talk to my dog and he, or
sometimes it was a she, always understood. You know
they love you no matter what, and that counts for a lot.

They sense feelings, know when you're upset and
comfort you. You know I have a wife who is support-
ive, but not as supportive as my dog--don't tell
her that!
Many of the participants described psychological attri-
butes that they believed allowed them to be more resilient
than many of their peers, as they entered old age. These
included adaptive coping styles, inner strength, a positive
attitude, self-esteem, optimism, and acceptance of aging.
Harriet described the importance of inner strength and being
able to maintain a satisfying "inner life." She described what
resilience meant and continues to mean to her:
I think what resilience means to me is inner strength
and the ability to stand on your own two feet and deal
with things, not to lean on other people for support all
the time, not to be helpless. I've always been very
independent, I do all my own gardening, my husband
is very busy, so I sort of do all the mending and repair
things and fix things. I do the sort of man's work
around the house and I'm a woman, so I am sort of
independent.
Financial security was vital for many of the participants.
For example, Ruth, a housewife turned medical historian in
her later life, discussed how her financial security allows her
to concentrate her energies in areas that give her personal
satisfaction. For the past 8 years, Ruth had been writing a
medical biography, which involved extensive travel.
Referring to the support that her husband is able to provide,
she explained,
As long as we keep putting one foot in front of the
other and we have enough money to pay the mortgage,
we (can) be supportive of one another's projects. I
don't mean million dollar projects, but the fact is that
it cost money to do the book I did because I had to go
to Africa.
The participants in this study were still relatively healthy
and were able to successfully carry out most of their activi-
ties of daily living without assistance. However, many of the
participants expressed wariness regarding the possibility of
future physical limitations. Gordon, a retired physician who
experienced abandonment as a child, described his concerns
as follows:
Well my eyesight is going and that worries me because
so many of the things I enjoy doing I need my eyes for
and I've only got one of them now. So I do worry
about if the other one goes. I go out of my way to be
reasonably good with electronic gadgets and things, so
that I would be able to move onto portable books and
things like this . . . But that scares me. I would find it
difficult if I really lose my eyesight. And, you know,
my eye doctors can't tell me.
Some of the other participants had already experienced
significant health challenges. However, many explained that
this gave them a greater appreciation for the time they have
left. Harriet had already suffered from breast cancer and,
more recently, an acute dissecting aortic aneurysm. She
described her feelings surrounding these events:
Miraculously, absolutely miraculously, I survived with
all my mental faculties intact . . . And I'm at a pretty
wonderful stage in my life and I'm so thankful for
every day that I have with my husband and children
and grandchildren . . . I have great hope and faith that
I will live for another 5 or more years, so I still have
great hope for the future.
The importance of organized religion was dismissed by
many of the participants. However, the idea of spirituality
and maintaining a belief in a higher power was identified as
important for some. Harriet discussed the importance of faith
in maintaining resilience as she aged: "I think I've often
prayed and found my prayers were answered, which is amaz-
ing." Others, who conveyed a more ambiguous view of the
form that faith should take, still found it valuable. When
asked whether faith helped him cope, Michael, a Holocaust
survivor who spent his teenage years in Auschwitz, replied,
"Yes, you have to believe in something. Whether it's true or
not. If you don't believe in anything, you're a lost person.
You have to believe in something."
Engagement in relationships and valued activities was a
theme that most strongly emerged throughout the interviews
as the most salient factor in maintaining and promoting resil-
ience in this group of individuals. Engagement in meaning-
ful or challenging activities was emphasized by all of the
participants as vital to their sense of resilience as they aged.
As this theme has received little previous attention in the lit-
erature, we explored it in further detail in our analysis. This
theme was expanded and reorganized as the interviews pro-
gressed and the subthemes began to take form. Engagement
was conceptualized through the following five domains:
(a) engagement in valued activities, (b) generative identity,
(c) maintaining competence, (d) personal life investment,
and (e) desire to learn.
Engagement inValued Activities
As they entered old age, many individuals struggled with the
loss of loved ones, most often friends or a partner. One par-
ticipant, Janis, who was emotionally abused and abandoned
by her mother as a child, lost a much loved son when she
was middle-aged. She had built a new life with her husband
and raised her children, but was devastated when one of
her sons died tragically as a young adult in a hit-and-run
6 SAGE Open
accident caused by a drunk driver. Janis found that engage-
ment in valued activities was a vital way for her to channel
her emotions into energy that could benefit others and main-
tain her resilience in the face of this new traumatic experi-
ence. She talked about many of the resilient women whom
she met at Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), but it
was apparent that Janis is most certainly one of these women
herself:
Well I've been volunteering for MADD for many
years and if you want a group of people who are resil-
ient, there are just so many who have had to deal with
losing family members and doing something about it.
I know a lot of people who have gone on to do really
amazing things after losing a child. You know, like I
have, become involved in MADD.
Generative Identity
Debra was a successful health administrator throughout her
adult life. She talked about how success in her career played
a large role in her resilience throughout her adult life. As she
has grown older, however, she discussed how she derived
significant satisfaction and strength from mentoring others
in her field, particularly women:
I was very good at what I did and became internation-
ally known. I felt I was really contributing and people
liked me. Now that I'm pretty much retired, I still keep
active in my profession--it feels good. I sit on advi-
sory boards, advise junior people and research widely
in my field. I enjoy seeing so many successful woman
as it was very sexist in my day. We prevailed against
tremendous odds.
Janis also talked about how it was important for her own
resilience to be able to continue to teach others about issues
to which she has dedicated much of her adult life. She spent
much of her working life on advocacy surrounding drunk
driving, and described how she believes it continues to help
her deal with tragedies in her past and to feel engaged in the
future. She explains, "I go and talk to high school students.
It's a tough thing to do, but it's very cathartic, being able to
do that."
Maintaining Competence
Michael arrived in Canada penniless with his young family.
He talked about the pressures he felt to start working imme-
diately and earn a living. He had spent some time working
with a tailor as an afterschool job when he lived in Eastern
Europe, so he decided to open up a tailoring business. He
described the importance that maintaining his competence
has had for his happiness and resilience as he aged. Like
many of the participants, he has faced some limitations in
his functioning as he has grown older, but has learned to
adapt to many of these challenges. To this point, Michael
explained,
I was in the tailoring business and, not to brag about
it, but I had a partner and we were the best tailors in
town. I couldn't make a whole garment anymore, but
I can do an alteration, shorten a pair of pants or put on
a button. Now I do my profession as a hobby.
Michael also stressed the importance of knowing when to
ask for help as he aged and to continue to be able to care for
himself. He said, "I have confidence in myself. If I get help,
it's even better, but if not, I have confidence that I can help
myself." He talked about how it was important for him to
continue living in his house and to take care of maintenance
work around the house and the garden, as long as he is able
to do so.
Personal Life Investment
Irene is a Jewish Polish woman who survived the Holocaust
by escaping to Russia with her family. She immigrated to
North America in her early 20s with her husband and twin
infant sons. She described the determination that she and her
husband had to carve out a life for themselves and for their
children, which they were deprived of in Europe. This
became a major goal for Irene through much of her adult
life. She explained,
I look now at what we went through and I can't
believe we survived. I worked hard here, plus my hus-
band worked, so that my kids have a good education,
so that they have what we missed out on.
When Irene was in her 50s, her husband suffered a major
stroke. Caring for her husband and maintaining their home
became a personal life investment for Irene that gave her a
sense of meaning and purpose throughout her old age, even
after her children left the home. She boasted that when she
goes to her family doctor, he says to her, "Irene, you're
amazing. If not for you, your husband wouldn't be here any-
more." "It means a lot to me," she explained.
Gordon discussed how it has been important to develop
himself in different and more creative ways since his retire-
ment. He led a busy practice as a physician and now, in his
later life, has spent time on other hobbies and personal pas-
sions. He described how setting firm goals for himself has
helped him to remain resilient as he aged:
You know, whatever, whether it's studying medicine,
or whether it's writing a book, or building a house, or
at the moment, doing my family tree and learning
Spanish. I like setting myself a fairly concrete kind of
goal and I'm a bit rigid about it.
Rodin and Stewart 7
Desire to Learn
Morris worked as a medical sociologist and a professor for
many years, and described how he found his continued
involvement in academic work to be very therapeutic. He
discussed how his early life was profoundly transformed by
his access to books and institutions of higher learning:
At the end of the war, I was very fortunate in getting
access to university, which quite surprised me. So
when I found myself in university, it opened up a
whole world . . . it was really quite a different world.
It was a world of learning and scholarship and I flour-
ished. I don't think I would have done as well if I
hadn't gone to university . . . It gave me new perspec-
tives, new opportunities, new friendships, access to
values and ideas that had never occurred to me.
Morris talked at length about his career as a professor and
his research. When asked about how his retirement from uni-
versity life had affected him, he exclaimed, "No, I'm really
blessed because now I don't have to mark papers!" He
explained how he still maintained a voracious appetite for
learning and scholarship and that this has kept him fulfilled
throughout his old age. He found that his desire to learn con-
tinued to give him an outlet for intellectual development,
despite the challenges inherent in growing older:
I wake up in the morning and feel a great joy that I can
spend a whole day on whatever the project is that I'm
working on. I feel incredibly fortunate. My wife died
about 14 years ago of cancer, but before she died, she
said something interesting that surprised me. She said
she was glad she was going first. She didn't really
want to be a widow for years and years and years. And
I thought, that's very interesting. The notion of ending
up as a widow was a bother to her. She was a Scot and
a very independent woman. Now I didn't feel that
because I still have a tremendous joy in getting up in
the morning and reading and arguing and writing. If
you had said to me 50 years ago that I won't have to
go to work, I can read any book I want, I can get any
document I want from the library, I would have
thought that was absolutely crazy. But that's what I do.
And I can't tell you what a tremendous joy that is.
Discussion
Although most of the previous resilience literature has
focused on children and adolescents, our findings demon-
strate that resilience may be very evident in later life, despite
earlier life trauma and the subsequent challenges of old age.
The positive outlook, strong will, and effective coping abili-
ties of these individuals were pervasive throughout the inter-
views.
It is clear from the resilience literature and the data of our
study that psychological factors, economic stability, and
social support play major roles in enhancing resilience in
older individuals. All of our participants reported significant
social support in their developmental years that may have
contributed to their self-esteem and capacity for engagement
in later life. Although all valued the support of others, they
regarded their own competence and mastery as central to
their resilience. Religion or spirituality also was considered
by some but not all of the participants in this study to play an
important role in their resilience.
What stood out in our interviews with these exceptionally
resilient individuals was the importance that they gave to
their intellectual life and valued activities, many of which
related to their previous work and interests. Their desire to
learn and potential for growth remained very strong and inte-
gral to their resilience as they aged. They were fully engaged
in social, community, and intellectual life and remained psy-
chologically optimistic, despite sometimes life-threatening
medical problems. These participants responded to their dif-
ficult childhoods of abuse, maltreatment, and deprivation,
and to the subsequent challenges inherent in old age by
engaging in life more fully and pursuing goals, hobbies, and
activities.
These findings reinforce and add to earlier work on resil-
ience in the elderly and are consistent with Erikson's sugges-
tion that continuing psychological development across the
life span provides the basis for a resilient self and the accrual
of wisdom by later life (Erikson, 1963). He also emphasized
"generativity" or a concern for establishing and guiding the
next generation as a central step in the successful transition
in life to the final stage of integrity, consistent with the obser-
vations of several of our participants. Masten (1994) sug-
gested that resilience be viewed as the ability to maintain
competence across the life span.
We found that specific psychological characteristics, par-
ticularly those associated with self-reliance and the flexible
use of supportive relationships, were emphasized by the par-
ticipants in our study as contributing to their resilience.
These findings are consistent with an empirical analysis of a
large representative sample of older individuals in the United
Kingdom. That study led to the elucidation of a higher order
model that incorporates interpersonal control, self-esteem,
and personal competence as most useful in understanding
psychological resilience in old age (Windle et al., 2008).
More recently, a study of elderly Holocaust survivors found
that taking up a purpose and maintaining competence was
essential to resilience in old age in individuals who had ear-
lier experienced adversity (Greene & Graham, 2009).
Limitations
There are some limitations to our study. The sample, which
consisted of middle- to upper income Caucasians of European
origin who were all recruited from a university teaching hos-
pital in a large urban center, is not fully representative of the
8 SAGE Open
population of survivors of CM. Therefore, our findings may
not be generalizable to other racial or cultural groups, or other
settings. The sample was specifically selected for "remarkable
resilience" and thus may not be representative of resilience in
the general population of older individuals who have been
exposed to CM.
Conclusion
Our findings point to the importance of inner strength, social
relatedness, and the ongoing motivation to engage and to
learn as important contributors to resilience. Supporting these
qualities in elderly individuals in the community may help to
bolster their resilience and capacity to function autono-
mously. Retirement homes, nursing homes, and community
centers could help their clients flourish or at least maintain
their functioning by supporting their capacity for indepen-
dent functioning and by promoting creative engagement in
valued activities. These activities not only reflect resilience,
but also reinforce it socially, psychologically, and physically.
Creative expression promotes heightened sense of personal
control, and encourages individual expression as well as
social connectedness. It may even promote the preservation
of cognitive functioning (McFadden & Basting, 2010).
The "paradox of well-being," in which elderly individuals
feel satisfaction with their lives, despite the loss of loved
ones, the discomforts of illness, and the growing limitations
in physical functioning, was elegantly demonstrated by the
participants in this study. Their perspectives and insights
about their experience with successful aging are inspiring
and encourage us to consider whether the possibilities and
benefits from creative engagement in older age can contrib-
ute to a shift in our understanding and expectations of indi-
viduals at this life stage.
