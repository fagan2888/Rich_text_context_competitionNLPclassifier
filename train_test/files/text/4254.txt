Introduction
Qualitative research has a dual purpose. On one hand, it
seeks to uncover what reality may be, while on the other
hand determines how that reality has been arrived at. This
dual process provides opportunity for the application, as well
as the adaption, of various methods. These enable interpreta-
tion of wide-ranging data and information, sourced from
multiple perspectives, and assessed through multiple meth-
ods to be applied, enabling researchers to understand mean-
ing in the context of life setting scenarios. A key outcome of
such research is to understand the what, the why, and the how
within research settings, and to apply this to the broader
research agenda of both extant and emerging theory.
Grounded theory represents a key qualitative research
method. It identifies a range of essential elements that,
when combined, offer a consolidated framework within
which wide-ranging data are gathered, assessed, and subse-
quently used in developing theory, based on what has been
observed. These essential elements include the coding and
categorization of data, concurrent data collection and anal-
ysis, the writing of memos, theoretical sampling, constant
comparative analysis using inductive and abductive logic,
the application of theoretical sensitivity, the development
of intermediate coding practices and routines, the selection
of core categories from the data, and the application of
theoretical saturation.
Applying grounded theory in the manner identified in
this article results in the hypothesis that change manage-
ment in the nonprofit sector may necessitate the inclusion
of four key considerations that should be built into planned
organizational change programs. In the context of a single
case study approach, these include that reflection for both
the change agent and the change recipient should be
accounted for, that preexisting confidence and trust levels
in management are a necessary element, that a balanced
focus on both the individual and the organization must be
evident, and the sequencing of specified events before,
during, and after the change, impact change outcomes
(Rosenbaum, More, & Steane, 2016). The grounded theory
methodology applied to this research suggests that the
inclusion of these elements in existing change manage-
ment models may, with the aid of further research, support
the development of specific change management models
for application in this sector.

Applying Grounded Theory to
Investigating Change Management
in the Nonprofit Sector
David Rosenbaum1, A. M. Elizabeth More2, and Peter Steane3
Abstract
Grounded theory is well supported as a qualitative research method that historically responded to the epistemological
challenges of defining knowledge and determining how it has been acquired. While its historical and unique methodological
underpinnings remain consistent, its ongoing application and methods of execution continue to expand its use. The
consideration of using grounded theory by researchers embodies the need to explore the methodology and thereafter seek
to develop the method that reflects the researcher's skills, the research setting, and the research aims. This article sets out
a particular method of applying it to the study of change management using a rich single case study in the nonprofit sector.
Key findings are that nonprofit specific change management models may need to incorporate a focus on formal reflection
for change agents and change recipients, development of trust and confidence in the organization prior to the actual change,
focusing on the individual experience of change, and recognizing the sequencing of events from a planning perspective.

Qualitative Methodology and the
Grounded Theory Context
Many aspects of qualitative research continue to contest the
notion of what good research is and what it is not. In feeding
this ongoing dilemma, qualitative research appears to have
divided itself into two quite broad camps, one which seeks to
link its own legitimacy to the positivist world, and the other
which seeks to specifically extricate itself from this poten-
tially restrictive set of barriers and be differentiated by focus-
ing on an interpretivist approach. The former seeks to
legitimize itself in the eyes of quantitative researchers, and
the latter seeks to substantiate qualitative research as a valid
alternative, supportive rather than competitive, motivated to
achieve additional, and valuable, research outcomes.
Researchers have, over the years, identified the challenges of
such broad epistemological variations (Angen, 2000; Jardine,
1990; Sandelowski, 1993), and, while qualitative research
has grown in application and use (Cooper & White, 2012;
Cummings, Daellenbach, Davenport, & Campbell, 2013;
Kathleen M. Eisenhardt & Graebner, 2007; Locke, 2011;
Morse et al., 2009), debates concerning the methodological
paradigms between approaches, and questions about the
broader practical use of qualitative research continue (Bansal,
Bertels, Ewart, MacConnachie, & O'Brien, 2012; Denyer &
Tranfield, 2009).
Recognizing the important distinction between the meth-
odology of grounded theory, represented by the principles
embodied in these essential elements, and the methods of
grounded theory, as a prescriptive process of applying these
elements into a practical, prescriptive set of procedures to
generate and analyze data, underpins the central purpose of
this article. The fundamental aim of the research reported
here was to identify the extent to which change management
in the nonprofit sector displayed characteristics and features
that distinguished the process from change management in
the commercial sector, from which all contemporary change
management models originate. A qualitative research
approach was identified as relevant because (a) there was a
need to understand change based on interpreting relevant
processes in the context of everyday activities of those who
experienced it, and (b) to work within the settings of their
daily routines and work programs. Together, these pointed to
the applicability of grounded theory as the appropriate
method for pursuing these aims, especially given that sym-
bolic interactionism, which underpinned the development of
grounded theory, had been crucial to understanding and
interpreting patterns of human behavior (Chenitz & Swanson,
1986).
While grounded theory has developed along different lines
of execution and use since its first application (B. G. Glaser &
Strauss, 1970), there has been recognition of the ongoing
development and adaptation that each application of such
methodology makes to the original theory (Morse et al., 2009).
While variation in method, as distinct from methodology, is
being applied in the research described in this article, com-
monly accepted aspects of the recognized methods remain as
cornerstones (Tummers & Karsten, 2012). Consequently, the
research method applied here ensures the application of true
grounded theory as distinct from a descriptive or exploratory
research approach (Birks & Mills, 2011).
This article identifies a specific application of grounded
theory method to study change management in the nonprofit
sector, and in doing so, provides input into the development
of a range of prescriptive processes that may guide future
researchers and future applications of the methodology. This
is consistent with the views expressed by Strauss and Corbin
(Denzin & Lincoln, 1994) regarding the potential develop-
ment of grounded theory in the course of applying it to dif-
ferent research settings:
As with any general methodology, grounded theory's actual use
in practice has varied with the specifics of the area under study,
the purpose and focus of the research, the contingencies faced
during the project, and perhaps also the temperament and
particular gifts or weaknesses of the researcher. (p. 276)
Process Overview
As described in more detail throughout this article, the spe-
cific application of grounded theory to the study of change
management in the nonprofit sector, via a longitudinal case
study, was structured in a manner consistent with the princi-
ples developed by its founders (B. G. Glaser & Strauss,
1970), as well as those that underpinned variations to the
original application (B. G. Glaser, 2001).
Figure 1 identifies an overview of the processes devel-
oped and applied by the principal researcher where spe-
cific procedures become individualized through ongoing
applications of grounded theory to new research settings.
This further defines the range of tools that, when applied,
may lay another foundation stone in the bridge-building
exercise between a process that provides little by way of
prescription, and the broad criticism of grounded theory as
a means of escaping theory testing (Goldthorpe, 1997,
2000; Mjøset, 2005). To some extent, such criticism may
also be fueled by poor appreciation of the role of qualita-
tive research and its importance in identifying new inter-
pretations (Gadamer, 2004; Peshkin, 1993; Sanjek, 1990),
which a well-developed and well-applied grounded theory
research may offer.
This process of moving from the design phases to the col-
lection and analysis phases is detailed further in Tables 1 to 3.
Research Design
Table 1 identifies the various subprocesses involved during

methodology and methods.
Rosenbaum et al. 3
The design of the research focused on contributing to
change management theory through the use and application
of grounded theory, observing that such an approach focuses
the research on how change is perceived by those that are
affected by the process and recognizing that existing change
management models in use do not adequately capture the
complexity of the change process from the perspective of
change recipients (Balogun & Jenkins, 2003). The original
impetus for the research was the need to move beyond tradi-
tional methodology used in understanding change manage-
ment, given that anecdotal evidence revealed how a range of
characteristics of people working in this sector may affect
how change unfolds and is therefore managed.
This sees the principal researcher applying a constructiv-
ist approach to the application of grounded theory, where the
emphasis on data is predicated on personal attachment to the
research, the role that previous knowledge and experience
plays during the research process, and emphasizing the
researcher's role and actions (Bryant & Charmaz, 2007;
Denzin & Lincoln, 1994; Goulding, 2009; O'Reilly & Marx,
2012), the reality that data and analysis are social constructs
rather than pure objective facts (Bryant & Charmaz, 2007),
and the epistemological underpinning regarding how data
are constructed and interpreted (Fendt & Sachs, 2008).
The importance of understanding change through the lens
of those experiencing it was viewed as a pivotal approach,
especially in the context of studying change management
where historical approaches have viewed change from an
organizational perspective, with limited research regarding
the views, thoughts, and feelings of actors immersed in the
process (Fox-Wolfgramm, Boal, & Hunt, 1998; Oreg &
Berson, 2011; Oreg, Michel, & By, 2013; Smith & Graetz,
2011). In addition, in order to account for the impact of
change on organisational actors over time, a longitudinal
approach (van den Broek, Boselie, & Paauwe, 2013) was
adopted to enable views of their changing environment, and
their feelings toward these events, that would impact on the
success or otherwise of the change program to be assessed
(Bartunek, Rousseau, Rudolph, & DePalma, 2006).
Existing literature and its use remains one of the outstand-
ing issues in the ongoing debate between Glaser and Strauss'
original approach to grounded theory, and the approach sub-
sequently developed by Strauss (B. G. Glaser & Strauss,
1970; Strauss, 1987). Grounded theory espoused an approach
that suggested no engagement with existing literature on the
research topic prior to any forms of data collection. It was
reasoned that such engagement would inhibit the natural
emergence of categories from the empirical data (Dey, 2007;

and supported by other researchers (Corbin & Strauss, 1990;
Wiener, 2007) ensured an ongoing, well-defined debate with
grounded theory purists (Holton, 2007; Nathaniel, 2006)
who place the literature review at the end stages of the
research.
The approach adopted here was to enter the field with a
strong knowledge base of existing literature in the substan-
tive area of the research, namely, change management,
supported by an in-depth exposure to broad management
issues within the nonprofit sector, obtained from the princi-
pal researcher's consulting activities in that sector. This base
knowledge was further developed during the data analysis
phase as specific research-related issues developed, which
focused the attention of the researcher to different areas of
literature on related subject matters, designed to expand
knowledge in areas considered relevant. This also supported
the research question of what can be learned from a nonprofit

longitudinal qualitative case study regarding the manage-
ment of change, which points to key differentiating features
of existing, commercial-based models. An extensive litera-
ture review was undertaken on grounded theory as a method-
ology to enable the researcher to effectively design and
initiate an appropriate grounded theory method to answer
this question.
A single case study (Kathleen M. Eisenhardt, 1989;
Orlikowski & Hoffman, 1997; Raelin & Catalado, 2011) was
identified as relevant, given the need to source an organiza-
tional change program that enabled longitudinal analysis on
a before-the-change, during-the-change, and after-the-
change basis. This accounts for the temporal aspects of the
change program (Beer & Nohria, 2000; Buchanan et al.,
2005; Maimone & Sinclair, 2014; Pettigrew, Woodman, &
Cameron, 2001; Van de Ven & Poole, 1995; Whittle &
Stevens, 2013; Wilson, 1992).
The research was undertaken over a 3-year period in a
large nonprofit general hospital undergoing the implementa-
tion of an in-house designed E-Pathways system that sought
to replace an existing paper-based patient records process
with an integrated online pathways-based platform. The
research involved data analysis from 56 structured and semi-
structured interviews (Mossholder, Settoon, Harris, &
Armenakis, 1995; Rowley, 2012) and, for triangulation pur-
poses (Kathleen M. Eisenhardt, 1989), a range of hospital-
based documentation, as well as information gleaned from
attendance at a number of staff meetings, which the principal
researcher attended as a nonparticipant observer (Denzin &
Lincoln, 1994).
The software program Nvivo 10 was used as a tool to ana-
lyze the transcripts. As has been suggested by some research-
ers (Bryant & Charmaz, 2007), the software application was
not the central focus for developing the grounded theory.
Rather, the software was merely an aid, or tool, in the pro-
cess. Theory development resulted from intimate involve-
ment with the data, avoiding the possible risk of displacing
personal immersion in the data through a cognitive process,
with a detached software driven process that, if fully applied,
"extracts" themes from word usage and frequency patterns.
A heavy focus and reliance on the software application, for
purposes other than maintaining easier access and tracking of
large data volumes and cross referencing, could jeopardize
the quality of the developed grounded theory.
In this manner, the research deemphasized the role of soft-
ware in the process and stressed the fluidity and dynamic nature
of qualitative analysis (Morse et al., 2009). This was further
emphasized by appreciating that the outcomes of each inter-
view were dependent on a number of key attributes of the inter-
viewer, including preexisting knowledge and how that would
be applied, levels of sensitivity that are brought to the inter-
view, and the ability to apply empathy toward the interviewee
during the conduct of the interviews (Kvale, 1996), thereby
gaining their trust and eliciting meaningful data. This under-
pins what has been described as the "discovery tradition" of
field research and stressing the creativity involved in data inter-
pretation (Busi, 2013; Locke, 2011).
Data Collection Supported by Ongoing
Data Construction
Table 2 identifies the various subprocesses involved during
data collection and identifies the activity level for each, as
well as the linkages back to the broader grounded theory
methodology and methods.
Interviews were undertaken at the hospital's premises as
nurses and allied health staff were either commencing their
shifts or completing them. All interviews were conducted in
staff rooms, offices, hospital cafes, or vacant ward rooms,
depending on the shift that the interviewee was completing
or about to commence. With permission of each of the inter-
viewees, a recording device was used from which transcripts
were created and used for purposes of data analysis. In this
manner, rapport with interviewees ensued, and while the
pure neo-positivist approach to interviews was largely
rejected, in line with the principal researcher's epistemologi-
cal view of data gathering and data generation, the straddling
between a "romantic" and "constructionist" approach was
more evident (Rowley, 2012).
Interviews were semistructured, which maximized the
breadth of interactions between the researcher and the inter-
viewee (Denzin & Lincoln, 1994), and well supported in a
grounded theory methodology (Goulding, 2002). This
approach remains consistent with approaching interviewer
and interviewee interaction from a constructionist perspec-
tive (Rowley, 2012). In addition, in researching such an orga-
nizational process as change management, interview-based
approaches have been widely applied in qualitative studies
(Mossholder et al., 1995).
Interviewees included representatives from all ward nurs-
ing staff, ward nursing managers, allied health professionals,
managerial staff involved in designing the E-Pathways sys-
tem as well as those tasked with implementing the system,
including the internally designated change agent. Members
of the hospital's executive team, including the chief execu-
tive officer, were also interviewed. This wide source of inter-
views ensured that interview data were obtained from an
array of those who were impacted by the changes, directly
and indirectly. In keeping with theoretical sampling princi-
ples, these interviews developed an iterative framework as
data analysis informed ongoing interviews.
The areas covered by the contents of the semistructured
interviews, focused on the phases through which the organi-
zational changes associated with the E-Pathways implemen-
tation went through, as well as the areas within the hospital
from which the interviewees originated. In this manner, there
were a series of semistructured questions that reflected the
longitudinal nature of the research and related to the stages
of "before-the-change," "during-the-change," and "after-the-
change." In addition, there was a different focus of interview
6 SAGE Open
questions for different interviewee groups, namely, execu-
tive-level team members, manager-level team members, and
staff-level team members. Each group's semistructured inter-
views reflected their different levels of responsibility and
experience with regard the implementation, and therefore the
associated change program. In this manner, purpose and
structure were closely interlinked (Cassell, 2009).
Recognizing interviews as being the predominant source
of data (Denzin & Lincoln, 1994), in keeping with the tradi-
tions of grounded theory, the concept of data was widely
applied (B. G. Glaser, 2001) and related to data extracted
from interview transcripts, from organizational documenta-
tion, from attendance by the researcher at numerous hospital
staff and working party meetings as a nonparticipant observer,
and from general observation of hospital staff interactions
throughout the hospital during the period of the change pro-
gram. In this manner, data triangulation (Trent, 2012; van den
Broek et al., 2013) supported data analysis, which also
directed ongoing interviews.
Data Analysis
Table 3 identifies the various subprocesses involved during
data analysis and identifies the activity level for each, as well
as the linkages back to the broader grounded theory method-
ology and methods.
All interviews were recorded and transcribed using a pro-
fessional transcription service to cope with the volumes of
data that were obtained during the course of the interviews,
which resulted in 360 pages of interview data, all of which
provided the depth of rich descriptions and explanations to
support the emerging theory and much of the raw material
necessary in the discovery process (Bryant & Charmaz,
2007; Miles & Huberman, 1984; R. Walker, 1985). Interview
data also included the researcher's attendance at the numer-
ous staff and other in-house meetings attended as a nonpar-
ticipant observer, where recordings were also made of all
proceedings (with approval of participants and meeting
chairs). These transcripts were also prepared in a similar
fashion to the one-on-one interviews. Transcripts were fur-
ther enhanced by the inclusion of documentation reviews,
with the latter incorporated into WORD documents for ongo-
ing analysis. When combined, the interview data, the meet-
ing notes, and the documentation review notes resulted in
more than 400 pages of raw data to be applied in the overall
interpretation and theory development process.
Coding of data was undertaken using Nvivo software ver-
sions 9 and 10 (updates applied as available throughout the
research process). Using Nvivo terminology, Nodes (Codes)
were identified a posteriori, and in the process, descriptions
applied for each newly identified Node. These descriptions
laid the initial foundations for detailed memos that were used
in redefining the Nodes as more and more data were coded
that underpinned the constant comparison of data and Nodes.
This led to Nodes being initially created in large numbers as
more and more data were coded, followed by Node changes
and rationalization as previously coded data were reviewed,
Node relationships were identified, themes extracted and the
formation and definition of levels of Nodes that enabled the-
oretical sampling and, finally, theoretical saturation, leading
to theory development.
While memos provided the framework and glue that
enabled the process to evolve, as identified in recognized
grounded theory method (Birks & Mills, 2011; Bryant &
Charmaz, 2007; Corbin & Strauss, 1990), there was a heavy
reliance on the development of a detailed research log,
referred to by some as a research diary (Newbury, 2001), and
in other cases extended to be known as a reflective journal
(Ortlipp, 2008), as distinct from participant diaries which
often support data collection and interpretation (Jacelon &
Imperio, 2005). The principal researcher applied more of a
reflective component to its development and maintained this
through the theory development stage of the research, apply-
ing the research log in ways that identified his own experi-
ences and values. This approach supported the way chosen to
represent the research findings (Harrison, MacGibbon, &
Morton, 2001), while also utilizing the log to effectively
"think-through" the more challenging aspects of qualitative
research, and grounded theory more specifically, in areas of
constant comparison, theoretical saturation, theoretical sam-
pling, validity, and transparency.
The overall process has been detailed diagrammatically in
Figure 2 and focuses on a range of process issues. These
were designed to inform a prescriptive aspect to the "doing"
of grounded research, while maintaining the cognitive com-
ponent. Such a structured and integrated approach ensures
differentiation between grounded theory and a descriptive
exploratory research perspective (Birks & Mills, 2011).
Figure 2 identifies the bottom-up approach that was
developed in applying grounded theory (remembering the
use and application of Nvivo descriptors which were manda-
tory). An explanation of terms developed and used in this
process are as follows:
·
· LRM = Linkage Review Memos, being the memos
identified in grounded theory method. The term link-
age was introduced by the principal researcher to
ensure clarification regarding their use in theoretical
sampling and constant comparison.
·
· RL = Research Logs, being the document created that
identified an activity or observation for which detailed
ideas were documented with high levels of detail, and
supported by their levels of importance and action
points that required consideration.
·
· NIML1 and NIML2 = Node Interrelationship Map
Level 1, being the assessment of the first level Nodes
that resulted from the first level coding of interview
transcripts and other data gathering sources. These
were structured using a purpose designed Excel
spreadsheet format. When combined with the LRMs
and the RL, these developed into NIML2 (Node
Interrelationship Map Level 2), which operated at
Rosenbaum et al. 7
various levels including, supporting constant compar-
ison and theoretical saturation, given the emphasis on
bio-direction between them. These essential compo-
nents of grounded theory were, accordingly, applied
in this formal circular movement to eventually evolve
to a higher level, being the HLDC.
·
· HLDC = Higher Level Descriptive Characteristics,
being the result of the above interactions which sought
to identify the characteristics identified in the data,
structured in the form of Node Groupings (NG),
informed by the LRMs and the RL, and developed
into key aspects of theory which evolved inductively
from the data.
The process began with the Nvivo coded interview tran-
scripts ("NCIT"), which informed the Linkage Review
Memos ("LRM"). The LRMs were created from the begin-
ning of data collection, document reviews, and observational
opportunities. As informed by grounded theory application,
these became the linchpin of the research. The LRMs were
constantly updated by, and referenced in, the Research log
("RL"). The LRMs, supported by the RL evolved into two
levels of Node Interrelationship Maps ("NIML1" and
"NIML2"). Level 1 maps identified the first level of Node
relationships that were identified in the data and supported
by detailed comments made in the LRMs. These LRMs were
created around a four-level structure which sought to develop
the researcher's views around general thoughts regarding the
Nodes, the relationships between other existing Nodes, the
potential creation of new Nodes, and considerations regard-
ing further analysis in existing literature.
The NIML1 and supporting comments in the RL led to the
flow of information into the NIML2, which grouped Nodes
into broader categories that was supported by the ongoing
analysis of the data. Continued assessment of the LRMs in the
context of the RL identified the linkages between Nodes,

which became the foundations of the NIML2. This ongoing
iterative process enabled the creation of both higher level and
lower level Nodes, which underpinned theory development
through a foundational structuring process of Node Groupings
("NG") that linked a range of Nodes to their Higher Level
Descriptive Characteristics ("HLDC"). A secondary attach-
ment to a further list of potential Nodes in the NIML2 were
also identified in this process, and were used to reinforce the
theory through both positive and negative correlations. This
was identified in the LRMs throughout the process.
The structure in Figure 2 illustrates the links between data
and the construction of theory, via the use and application of
memos (LRMs and RL) and the iterative process of compar-
ing data with categories and categories with categories
(NIML1 and NIML2), in recognition of the importance of
constant comparative analysis as a cornerstone in true
grounded theory. As categories are developed and refined,
theoretical sampling provides further input into the process
to support theory creation (NG and HLDC). At this point in
the process, theoretical saturation of categories is achieved
when no further developments can be identified in category
linkages (NG) or category refinement (HLDC), supporting
the essence of grounded theory as developed, and reinforcing
the utility of the method.
This research method identifies the unique attributes of a
constructivist approach to grounded theory. It highlights
variations in the position of the researcher, where reality is
not independent of the researcher, and where multiple reali-
ties and nuances of data construction exist. This is distinct
from data collection, as well as the construction of theory
rather than the discovery of theory, and the earlier recogni-
tion of extant literature around the subject area (Aminian,
Kirkham, & Fenn, 2013).
Use of Literature
While grounded theory method is the focus of this article and
the processes identified in Figure 2, the use and timing of
literature in grounded theory research has been one of the
issues that has loomed large as a focal point of dissention
among the three broad grounded theory "camps" of its origi-
nal founders (B. G. Glaser & Strauss, 1970), its refiners
(Corbin & Strauss, 1990), and its revisionist (Charmaz,
2006). The use of existing literature in grounded theory has
been described as a "polemic" and "divisive" (Dunne, 2011)
issue among experienced researchers, and a potential for
confusion for less experienced researchers and those consid-
ering its use in PhD research.
This is a challenge of timing (Cutcliffe, 2000; McGhee,
Marland, & Atkinson, 2007), not of application. However, it
results in a range of theoretical and practical considerations.
In the context of the founders of grounded theory, the key
issue was the extent to which a review of existing literature
at the onset of the research would effectively inhibit the
emergence of categories naturally from the empirical data,
owing to the impact of extant theoretical frameworks and
their related hypothesis (Dunne, 2011). The approach
adopted by Corbin and Strauss (1990) placed less emphasis
on the process issues of grounded theory and viewed proce-
dures as tools that help the researcher to build theories
grounded in data. In this manner, the literature could support
the development of the research question. The approach
adopted by Charmaz (2006) was even more practical in that
it considered researchers having ideas about the literature
around the subject area as a possible vantage point which
would add value to the process of theory construction.
The approach adopted in the present research was
impacted by a range of factors including the professional
background of the principal researcher which involved prac-
tical management experience in change, as well as a practical
history in the management of change within the nonprofit
sector, and, specifically, within a hospital setting. This led to
the proposition of using literature during the process of data
analysis as well as during theory construction. As referenced
earlier, focused literature reviews were undertaken through-
out the use of the LRMs to inform the identification of Node
relationships (categories). Counteracting any possible nega-
tive impact of such early engagement with literature was a
process of reflexivity that was effectively built into both the
LRMs and the RL, an approach well referenced in the
grounded theory process literature (Heath, 2006; McGhee
et al., 2007; Robson, 2011).
Recommendations for Further
Research
As a single case study, the hypothesis developed should be
tested in further nonprofit settings in order that a more gen-
eralized application of the findings can be tested. To support
such an approach, further research, which could be under-
taken and is currently being considered, would include the
following elements:
·
· Alongitudinal grounded theory study in a second non-
profit hospital undergoing similar change in order,
magnitude, and type as was undertaken in this
research. Such a study would seek, in a similar man-
ner to the present study, to understand change from
the perspective of those experiencing it, with out-
comes being compared with those achieved in the
present study. This would provide clarity as to the
hypothesis derived in the present study and determine
both its veracity as well as potential other intervening
factors that could expand it.
·
· A longitudinal grounded theory study in a nonprofit
organization outside of the hospital sector in an orga-
nization that is undergoing major change of the order
of magnitude experienced in this present study. This
would provide clarity as to the extent to which the
hypothesis developed here is applicable to a broader
Rosenbaum et al. 9
nonprofit context or the possibility that it may be
more specific to a hospital setting.
·
· Finally, a longitudinal grounded theory study in a for-
profit organization within the hospital sector in an
organization undergoing similar change. Such a study
would seek to determine the extent to which the
hypothesis identified in the present study is in fact
unique to the nonprofit sector through a process that
has had limited application in previous change man-
agement case study research.
Conclusion
While this article identifies a specific approach to grounded
theory research in a unique application, it does so from the
perspective that methodology is different from method,
where the former remains true to the origins of grounded
theory, and the latter recognizes that each application of
grounded theory further develops it as a qualitative research
methodology. The approach developed in this research
responds to the prescriptive challenges of applying a set of
epistemological approaches to qualitative research, while
maintaining the core elements of grounded theory--namely,
constant comparative analysis, theoretical sampling, and
theoretical saturation.
The historical roots of grounded theory evolved from the
early dominance of research settings that reflected the
strong quantitative ideological framework. This dominance
saw qualitative methodologically based research viewed in
adverse terms (Johnson, Long, & White, 2001) and rele-
gated as subsidiary to more scientific based quantitative
methodologies. Responding to this positivist paradigm,
grounded theory developed as a means of generating theory
from real-world data, evolving over time, to incorporate a
wider application of methods, in a world that has since
come to value the addition to knowledge that qualitative
research can bring, resulting in part, from the rigor of anal-
ysis as well as the richness and depth of interpretation (D.
Walker & Myrick, 2006).
The grounded theory approach to both collecting and ana-
lyzing interview and related data supported an understanding
of how change recipients as well as change agents, involved
themselves in, and responded to, a wide range of organiza-
tional processes and dynamics that characterized the changes
at the hospital. As a recognized qualitative research method-
ology, its unique inductive underpinning supported a depth
of understanding through the thoughts, feelings, responses,
attitudes, and emotions of those involved in, and affected by
the processes, over its duration. In the context of a growing
appreciation in recent change management literature as to the
importance of the individuals in change, as distinct to just the
organizational focus, grounded theory supports the depth of
analysis and understanding to be achieved by seeing change
through the eyes of those who are experiencing it, planning
it, and managing it, and doing so in the context of an iterative
data analysis approach that is sensitive to the gradation
within that data and its meaning.
The research outcomes resulting from the application of
grounded theory methodology, and supported by the specif-
ics of the method identified in this article, to the study of a
single case study in the management of change in the non-
profit sector, supported the hypothesis identified earlier
regarding the identification of four key characteristics that
necessitated an increased focus in planned organizational
change. These were the inclusion of formal reflection time
for change agents and change recipients during the change
program, the development of trust and confidence in the
organization prior to the actual change commencing, ensur-
ing an appropriate focus on the individual experience of
change rather than an entirely organizational focus, and the
identification of a range of sequencing events necessary
throughout the change program. By outlining specific
grounded theory design characteristics focused on research-
ing change from the perspective of change recipients, this
study has further developed grounded theory as a research
method, while identifying a number of change management
activities that may underpin successful change management
within the nonprofit sector, thereby contributing to the theory
and practice of change, in a sector that has not been the sub-
ject of such research to date.
