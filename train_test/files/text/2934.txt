Traditionally, households have been seen as acting as a single unit when it comes to savings.
Although this might be correct for some parts of household savings, we question the correctness
of the unitary model with respect to non-mandatory retirement savings. Therefore we analyze
the intra-household allocation of retirement savings between partners in Germany taking an
individualistic approach.
First, the decision to save at all is analyzed using a seemingly unrelated bivariate probit model,
showing that the possession of retirement saving accounts among spouses is positively
correlated, hinting at a "crowding-in" of saving accounts. However, this could be only due to
some tax reasons. Thus, we analyze additionally the interaction of savings between spouses
using three-stage least squares, allowing for endogeneity between the spouse's savings. These
results additionally show a "crowding-in" of total retirement savings amounts between spouses,
probably due to some "peer effect". The unitary model of household decision making can thus
be rejected with respect to retirement savings.

1. Introduction
Originally, households have been seen as acting economically as a single unit. This unitary
model, implying a single decision making process among the individual household members,
was applied for the analysis of household decisions ranging from labor supply to overall
household savings. However, in the last years this simplifying approach has been questioned
and disproved by many researchers (for example Vermeulen (2005), Attanasio and Lechene
(2002) and Browning (1995), just to name some of them), because it neglects individual
preferences almost completely. Alternative approaches have been proposed, recognizing
household behavior as a result of a decision-making process reflecting different preferences
among the household members. These collective approaches can be further divided into
cooperative and non-cooperative models. In the first, spouses negotiate decisions taking each
other's preferences into account. In the second, each household member takes the other
members` behavior as given and maximizes his/her own utility.1 While the collective model
has been confirmed in a number of studies with respect to the labor supply decision at the
extensive as well as the intensive margin,2 evidence for the household decision-making process
with respect to savings is scarce.3 This may result from the fact that information on household
savings largely originates from panel surveys, only measuring overall household savings. With
data on individual retirement savings at hand, we will analyze the intra-household allocation of
retirement savings from a cross-sectional perspective, modelling each spouses decision
separately but allowing for mutual endogeneity at the same time. The question to be answered
in this article is not a theoretical one but a somewhat more empirical one. How does the intra-

2 See e.g. Garcia et al (2010), Bloemen et al. (2008) or Aronsson et al. (2001).
3 Browning (1995) found that with a higher share of the wife in household income the total household saving rate
declines. By contrast, Lee and Pocock (2007) conclude for South Korea that an increasing share of the wife's
relative earnings leads to increasing total household savings. Lee and Pocock (2007) are to our knowledge the
first to explicitly model and analyze the allocation of financial resources between spouses. Grabka et al. (2015)
examined the distribution of wealth between couples in Germany, concluding that the intra-household wealth
gap declines with the female taking financial decisions.
3
household allocation of retirement savings look like? And how are the spouse's savings related
to each other? Does one spouse decrease savings if the other one saves more if controlled for
common household statistics? Or does the other spouse also increase savings due to some
recognition or peer effect? Given that some retirement savings are saved by the aggregate
household by definition (e.g. real estate), we focus on saving accounts usually used to save for
old-age reasons which can ultimately be attributed to a specific household member. In order to
study the interaction between household members with regard to retirement savings in
Germany, we use the Panel on Household Finances (PHF) provided by the Bundesbank. This
data set allows us to analyze individual savings and simultaneously to consider the overall
household situation as well as the partner's or spouse's retirement savings. The remainder of
this article is structured as follows. First, the dataset is described in section 2.1. followed by the
outlining of the empirical strategy in section 2.2.. After showing some descriptive statistics, the
multivariate analysis with respect to the saving decision (section 3.2.) and saving amount
(section 3.3.) is presented, followed by some robustness analysis in section 3.4.. The article
finishes summarizing the results and presenting implications for further research.
2. Data and empirical strategy
2.1. The PHF dataset
The following analysis is based on the newly introduced "Panel on Household finances" (PHF)
in Germany.4 The PHF, conducted by the Bundesbank, is part of the Eurosystem's "Household
Finance and Consumption Survey" (HFCS). In addition to the common European-wide
questionnaire covering questions on household finance, wealth and consumption, the PHF puts
special emphasis on two further topics, namely savings and old-age provision. Therefore,

n_household_finances.html
4
detailed information on an individual level is collected through different types of saving
vehicles, as well as financial assets. This information is of special interest as it enables the
analysis of savings specially linked to old-age pension provision. Besides information about
individual retirement savings, the PHF also includes detailed household characteristics e.g.
household net income, children, etc. This rare combination allows us to analyze the interaction
between the retirement savings of spouses within the household context. The survey is designed
to be a full panel with a survey frequency of three years. So far, two waves have been conducted
in 2010/2011 and in 2014. We use both waves throughout the following analysis.
The problem of missing data caused by item non-response, generally present with surveys about
financial data, was coped with by using multiple imputation (m=5) to fill these missing values
and simultaneously considering the uncertainty of these imputations. Leading to five imputed
datasets this has to be considered while analyzing the data.5 However, for the purpose of
analyzing the interaction between spouses, we refrain from using the imputed observations and
stick to the original values, as the imputation procedure could eventually impose own
assumptions about the correlation between the spouses' savings in retirement accounts.
2.2. Empirical Strategy
In general, all saving vehicles can be used to transfer present income to the own retirement
period as e.g. saving accounts, private pension insurance, cash value life insurance, stocks, real
estate etc. However, the saving reason cannot always be clearly distinguished. As this article
puts special emphasis on retirement savings, only vehicles, which are directly linked to
retirement, are analyzed in the following sections. These vehicles consist of state-subsidized
private pension contracts (Riester or Rürup pensions),6 all kinds of voluntary occupational
5 For further information about the multiple imputation procedure in the PHF dataset and the appropriate analysis
see Zhu and Eisele (2013).
6 To facilitate the following sections, the term Riester pension will refer to both Riester as well as Rürup pension
plans, because they are not further distinguished in the dataset. Rürup pension or `Basis-Rente' refers to pension
plans designed for self-employed individuals with tax-deductible contributions up to 22,172 Euros in 2015.
5
pension schemes, private non-subsidized pension insurances and cash value life insurance.7
Occupational pensions of different types are summarized with the exception of direct pension
insurances financed by the employer. As the decision for this type of occupational pension, as
well as the contributions are made by the employer and not the employee, it can be regarded
rather as employer saving than as individual rational decision.
The research question raised in this article is whether households act as a unit when it comes to
retirement savings or whether these decisions are made independently on an individual level. If
both partners jointly determine their retirement savings, as proposed by the unitary model, one
could expect that due to transaction costs retirement savings would not be split up between the
spouses. More precisely, one spouse makes a saving contract for the total household, what could
be the case for example for cash value life insurances. However, due to subsidies or tax
exemptions for some contracts (Riester or occupational pension contracts), it could also be
rationale to split the savings between both spouses in order to maximize overall public subsidies
if the maximum subsidy or tax exemption is already reached by one spouse. In these cases both
spouses' savings would act as close substitutes and hence one would expect the savings of one
spouse to crowd out the savings of the other spouse holding all other factors constant.
On the contrary, one could also think of a "crowding-in" of retirement savings among both
spouses due to the so called "recognition effect" introduced by Cagan (1965). The reasoning
behind is an increasing awareness of the need for additional savings as one spouse starts to save
for retirement.8 This effect could further be enhanced by the fact that if one spouse decides to
7 This approach has the disadvantage of neglecting other saving instruments for retirement, especially
investments in real estate, which constitutes a relevant part of private household wealth (see e.g. Grabka and
Westermeier (2014), p. 159). However, with regard to the question of the interaction of individual retirement
savings within a household, savings in real estate become irrelevant as these savings are usually determined only
on the household level.
8 For example Börsch-Supan et al. (2012) found a positive correlation between the possession of an occupational
pension plan and a subsidized Riester or unsubsidized private pension plan for German households.
6
make a saving contract, the other spouse might get in touch with a financial advisor as well.9
Thus, this "recognition effect" could also be labelled as a peer effect. As mentioned earlier, the
possession of retirement saving contracts of both spouses does however not necessarily mean a
"crowding-in" of retirement savings, but could also be owed to tax reasons. For a "crowding-
in" to exist, we would additionally have to observe a positive correlation between each spouse's
savings.
Hence, we apply a two-stage estimation procedure in order to analyze the intra-household
composition of voluntary retirement savings for both the extensive margin (decision to save)
and the intensive margin (amount being saved) of retirement savings. In the first stage we
analyze the saving decision measured by a dummy variable equaling one if the individual is
saving for retirement. Considering the possibility of mutual dependence between each spouse's
decisions (correlated error terms), either positive in the case of a "crowding-in" of saving
accounts or negative for a "crowding-out" as implied by the basic unitary model, we estimate
both decisions simultaneously using a bivariate probit model. Both spouses share a common set
of household variables (e.g. household income, children, real estate property) while they differ
with respect to their individual educational and labor market characteristics. Thus, we estimate
a seemingly unrelated bivariate probit model based on each spouses' individual Xind
i as well as
common household socio-economic characteristics XHH as shown in Equation 1.10 The mutual
dependence of the error terms is reflected by the coefficient of  (rho).

9 Pfarr and Schneider (2011) show for Germany that being in contact with a financial advisor increases the
probability to possess a Riester pension contract as a sort of supplier-induced demand.
10 For an overview on the detailed methodology of bivariate probit models see Greene (2003), section 21.6.
7
The set of individual socio-demographic variables comprise of age, age squared, a dummy for
Eastern Germany, a dummy for an immigrant background11,whether the individual is married
or not and dummy variables covering various degrees of education. The set of labor market
characteristics covers variables for gross income (gross income, gross income squared), type of
employment (e.g. unemployed, civil servant, self-employed with or without employees),
employment situation (full-time, part-time, marginally or fixed-term employed etc.) and a set
of dummies covering the sector of employment12.
Labor market characteristics first determine the need for additional retirement savings. For
example civil-servants are members of a generous defined benefit system and thus do not need
to save using retirement saving accounts but can also use other more flexible saving vehicles.
On the contrary, for self-employed persons insurance in the statutory pension scheme is non-
mandatory, hence they have an additional demand for retirement saving accounts.
Having analyzed whether the decision to save at all is influenced by the partner's decision, we
turn our attention in the second stage to the question whether also the amount being saved is
influenced by the spouse's savings or not. This question is equal to asking whether the unitary
model is appropriate with regard to retirement savings or not. An observed "crowding-out"
between the spouse's saving amounts could be interpreted in favor of income pooling or the
unitary model or at least the collective model, whereas an observed "crowding-in" or no
observed endogeneity would present weak evidence for a more or less individual decision-
making process. Hence, we estimate the following set of equations (Eq. 2), where log 
denotes the logarithm of the yearly retirement savings of individual A, X
 is representing a
vector of socio-economic variables of the same individual as e.g. demographics, labor market
11 Individuals are defined as having an immigrant background if they either do not have a German citizenship or
received it sometime after birth.

entitlement at least for an occupational pension plan financed through deferred compensation.

each other.

These equations can be regarded as being determined simultaneously and hence the partner's
savings must be treated as endogenous variables. Considering this mutual endogeneity, we
estimate the coefficients of this set of equations using three-stage least squares.13
Three-stage least squares (3SLS) presents an extension of two-stage least squares and allows
for mutual dependence of the error terms between both equations. It combines two-stage least
squares estimates with a correction for the mutual dependence. The first two steps consist of
two-stage least squares estimations of each single equation and the estimation of the covariance
matrix of the error terms in the system of equations. In the last stage these estimates are used
to compute the Generalized least squares (GLS) estimator of the system.
Why to use the logarithm of savings and not nominal savings? Using the log of retirement
savings has two relevant properties. Given the lognormal distribution of individual savings,
coefficients are biased if we use the nominal values. Additionally, it restricts the analysis to
households with both spouses saving. Analyzing the existence of either a "crowding-in" or a
"crowding-out" of retirement savings between spouses, using observations with only one
person saving would be unrewarding.
13 For the exact properties of the three-stage least squares method see Wooldridge (2010), Chapter 8.

3. Results
In this section, the empirical estimates are presented first for the intra-household allocation of
voluntary retirement saving accounts as well as for the corresponding saving amounts. With the
focus lying on saving for retirement, the further analysis is restricted to households consisting
of individuals not receiving a pension yet, leaving us with 2251 households.14 In order to
analyze the allocation of saving amounts and whether a "crowding-in" of retirement savings, a
"crowding-out" or none of both exists, we restrict the sample in the second step to 781
households with both partners saving privately for retirement. In the multivariate analysis
sections, all equations are estimated separately for male and female spouses, where the first
equation or column always refers to the male spouse.
3.1. Descriptive Statistics
First, we present some descriptive statistics for the intra-household allocation of retirement
saving contracts and saving amounts.

Table 1 shows, that 57.6 percent of all men possess a retirement saving contract whereas this
fraction amounts to only 45.4 percent for their female partners. In 31.9 percent of all
households, neither the head of household nor his/her partner is saving for retirement at all. In

of the following multivariate analyses have been carried out for the subsample of married couples and have
proven robust.

about a third of all households, at least one partner has a retirement saving account, whereof
about 70 percent consist of households where only the male possesses a saving account. Finally,
in 35 percent of households both partners have individual retirement saving contracts.
Looking at the annual household retirement savings, it becomes obvious that households, where
only the male partner saves, are on average saving more than households where only the female
partner possesses a saving account. This can probably be explained by the fact that males earn
a higher gross income than their female partners, on average (see Table 5 in the Appendix for
summary statistics of all other variables).

Households with both partners saving, save on average more than just the average sum of both
cases where only one partner is saving. One might be tempted to conclude that this provides
evidence for a "crowding-in" of retirement savings among spouses, however, it could be the
case that households with both partners saving are earning a higher income and thus have higher
saving amounts.
The distribution of total household savings between spouses is shown in Figure 1 with respect
to the man's share of aggregate household gross income. An increasing share of gross
household income earned by the man does not necessarily imply a one by one increase in the
11
man's share of aggregate household retirement savings. Instead, only a significantly weaker
correlation between gross income share and savings share is observable.
Figure 1: Household saving and gross income distributions
Source: PHF 2010/2011 and 2014.
From Figure 2 in the Appendix it becomes obvious that patterns are different for unsubsidized
and tax exempted saving vehicles. While for tax exempted and subsidized saving vehicles
(Riester and occupational pension plans) the saving share clearly correlates to the share of gross
income, the saving share for unsubsidized contracts is nearly independent of the gross income
share.
After these purely descriptive results, we will now turn our attention to the multivariate analysis
first of the extensive and subsequently of the intensive margin of retirement savings, controlling
for all other possible influences.

3.2. Intra-household distribution of saving accounts
Estimating the intra-household allocation of retirement saving accounts as a first hint for the
intra-household allocation of retirement savings, one has to consider the possibility of one
spouse's decision to save privately for retirement not being independent of the other spouse's
decision. Therefore we estimate a seemingly unrelated bivariate probit model for a dummy
indicating the possession of retirement saving accounts, using individual socio-demographic
and labor market variables as well as common household variables as explanatory variables.
With focus on the intra-household allocation of retirement savings, we are primarily interested
in the estimated correlation of the error terms15, represented by  (rho) in Equation 1.16

15 One has to consider the possibility that correlated error terms might rather represent an ommitted variable bias
than correlated decisions. However, with our extensive set of explanatory variables we are confident that omitted
variable bias is hopefully negelectable here.

Interestingly, household equivalence net income17 is only a significant factor for the probability
of the male spouse of possessing a saving account. Likewise, individual gross income is only

14
weakly significant for the male partner. Surprisingly, for the female spouse neither individual
gross income nor household equivalence income is significant. The positive and highly
significant coefficient of rho provides evidence for the individual possession of a retirement
saving account being strongly correlated among partners even if controlled for both household
and individual labor market characteristics. This "crowding-in" of saving contracts among
household members, also found by Börsch-Supan et al. (2012) for German households
generally, is probably due to some recognition effect or peer effect as discussed in section 2.2.
However, this positive correlation might only be due to tax reasons and does not necessarily
have to increase household savings at all. For example Riester pension plans are subsidized via
a basic allowance of 154 Euro which is counted against the tax subsidy arising from the
exemption of contributions to the Riester pension account. For a non-working spouse it might
be rationale to open up an own account in order to get the basic allowance by just paying the
minimum annual contribution of 60 Euro. Additionally, for occupational as well as Riester
pension schemes there exists an upper ceiling of tax-deductible contributions. These ceilings
might provide incentives to split the household retirement savings between two contracts, if the
total saving amount exceeds this ceiling, and thus may lead to a "crowding-out" of the other
spouse's savings. Hence, in the next section we will turn our attention to the amount of
retirement savings and whether there exists a "crowding-in" or "crowding-out" of retirement
savings among spouses.
3.3. Crowding-in or crowding-out of spouse's retirement savings?
If saving amounts of the spouses and thus household retirement savings are simultaneously
determined, both equations outlined in section 3.2. have to be estimated controlling for
endogeneity. Thus we estimate the coefficients using the method of three-stage least squares.
Being interested in the effect of the spouse's savings on own savings only, we need to control
for all other possible influences carefully. Therefore, we include the same set of explanatory
15
variables used in the previous estimation of the intra-household allocation of retirement saving
contracts, as control variables. These control variables comprise of individual socio-
demographic and labor market characteristics including sectoral dummies as well as household
characteristics, who all might have an influence on the savings amount. With the focus on
studying the interaction between the spouses' savings, we use the logarithm of retirement
savings, reducing the sample to 781 households with both spouses voluntarily saving for
retirement.18

18 With not all couples being married, one could argue that saving behavior in non-married households differ
from married households. Thus, we additionally estimated the model only with married households (about 89
percent of the sample), which did not change the results.

Male spouses living in the Eastern part of Germany save significantly less than a comparable
person in the Western part. While for male spouses household net income plays a significant
role in determining retirement savings, for their female partners individual gross income seems
to be more important. Self-employed persons seem to save more whereas unemployed persons
and civil servants save less for retirement as one would have expected. Interestingly, education
or especially schooling only seems to increase savings of the male spouse, whereas only the
dummy for university entrance qualification is significant on a five percent significance level
for the female partner.
Controlling for all other variables potentially influencing the amount being saved, the
coefficient of our variable of interest, the logarithm of the other spouse's savings, is significant
for both spouses at the one percent significance level. The coefficient for the other spouse's
saving is fairly high for both spouses, with 0.431 for male and 0.356 for female spouses. With
17
respect to the dependent variable, the logarithm of savings, this coefficient can be interpreted
as the elasticity of retirement savings with respect to the savings of the partner. An additional
increase of one percent in retirement savings of one spouse leads to an increase in savings of
the other spouse of 0.431 or 0.356 percent respectively. This result shows that neither are both
savings decisions independent of each other, nor does the spouse's retirement savings substitute
each other. By contrast, there seems to exist a recognition or peer effect in savings also with
respect to the chosen saving amount.19
3.4. Robustness analysis
The following section conducts several robustness checks for the previous results regarding the
interaction between the partners' saving amounts. First, as we have seen from the previous
analysis, saving patterns are different for self-employed and civil servants. Therefore, we
estimate our simultaneous equations model excluding self-employed and civil servants, thus
only considering households consisting of employees and non-employed individuals. Using this
subsample, both spouses' savings still show positive and highly significant coefficients, as
shown in Table 6 in the Appendix. However, the estimated coefficients are smaller if self-
employed and civil servants are excluded.
Second, one might argue that non-working partners might either be restricted to adjust their
individual savings or might simply not have the opportunity for example for an occupational
pension plan. Thus we estimate our model using only the subsample of households with both
partners working at least part or fulltime (results are shown in Table 6). Using this subsample
confirms our results of the full sample analysis. Male savings are now even more heavily
influenced by female spouse's savings with an elasticity of 0.517 on a one percent significance
19 For example peer effects have been also shown to exist with repect to the take up of paternity leave by Dahle
et al. (2014).
18
level. The coefficient for the male spouse's savings also increases to 0.464 and is still significant
on a one percent level.
Another reason for concern might be the existence of differences in intra-household behavior
with respect to the type of saving contract. Subsidized contracts, either by direct subsidy
(Riester pension) or by tax exemption for contributions (Riester and occupational pension
plans) possess a ceiling for tax exemption and Riester pension plan additionally require a
minimum saving rate in order to qualify for the full subsidy. Thus, there may exist incentives
to shift savings from one partner to the other if the individual tax exemption ceiling for
contributions is reached. In order to analyze, whether there exist differences with respect to the
saving vehicles we estimate our model separately for somehow subsidized contracts (Riester
and occupational pension plans) and unsubsidized contracts (cash-value life insurance and
private unsubsidized pension plans). The results are presented in Table 7 in the Appendix and
reveal slightly different patterns for both types of contract. The female spouse's saving amount
to unsubsidized contracts significantly depends on male spouse's savings. By contrast, the
coefficient for female spouse's savings is only half as large but still significant on a five percent
level. Turning to tax-subsidized savings things reverse. Male spouse's savings are now
significantly influenced by the female spouse's savings. The coefficient for the male spouse's
savings is not significant for the female's savings amount anymore. The results for subsidized
contracts must however be handled with caution, as the number of observations shrinks to 278.
One restriction of the presented results of the simultaneous equation model might be that they
are based on pooled cross-sectional data so far. Maybe the dynamics of the reaction of
individual savings to some common household optimization process takes place with a lag and
is therefore not observable in cross-sectional data. Exploiting the panel structure of the two
19
waves of the PHF, we estimate a random-effects estimation for both spouses.20 The results are
shown in table 8 and confirm a "crowding in" of private retirement savings on a one percent
significance level. However, the coefficient for the other spouse's savings are smaller than in
the simultaneous equation model with pooled cross-sectional data.
20 Applying the hausman test the zero hypothesis could not be rejected, recommending the use of a random-
effects estimation.
20
4. Concluding remarks
We examined the intra-household allocation of retirement savings in Germany. First, we looked
at the allocation of retirement saving accounts within the household and found that, controlled
for other factors, possession of a saving account is positively correlated between spouses, giving
some evidence for a "crowding-in" of accounts. This might be due to some peer or recognition
effect, where the need to save for retirement becomes obvious if one spouse starts saving or as
a sort of supplier-induced demand because of the contact to an insurance agent. Furthermore,
there might exist tax reasons inducing a splitting up of household retirement savings among
spouses. Thus, a "crowding-in" of saving accounts does not necessarily provide evidence for a
"crowding-in" of savings at all and does not reject the unitary or collective household model.
Analyzing the interaction of saving amounts in households with both spouses saving and
allowing for endogeneity, revealed also the existence of a "crowding-in" of saving amounts.
These results show some evidence for a possible multiplier effect of fiscal incentives within
households, what has to be considered analyzing public policy with respect to retirement
savings.
Our findings give no evidence in support of the unitary household model with respect to
retirement savings. Instead, retirement saving decisions seem to take place on an individual
level, with a "crowding-in" by the partner's savings, induced probably by updated information
or preferences. However, the same could be true for the collective household model, where due
to new information the optimal household saving amount may be altered leading to both spouses
increasing their savings simultaneously. Or both spouses agree on a savings sharing rule, which
also imply mutually increasing savings in order to maintain a certain savings share. How these
empirical estimates fit into existing theoretical models and whether they favor a special
decision-making process among spouses must be left to further research at this point.
