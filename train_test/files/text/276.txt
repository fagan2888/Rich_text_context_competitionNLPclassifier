Abstract. To assess the prevalence and motives for illicit use of
prescription stimulants and alcohol and other drugs (AODs),
associated with these motives, the authors distributed a self-
administered Web survey TO a random sample of 9,161 under-
graduate college students. Of the study participants, 8.1%
reported lifetime and 5.4% reported past-year illicit use of pre-
scription stimulants. The most prevalent motives given for illic-
it use of prescription stimulants were to (1) help with concen-
tration, (2) increase alertness, and (3) provide a high. Although
men were more likely than women were to report illicit use of
prescription stimulants, the authors found no gender differences
in motives. Regardless of motive, illicit use of prescription
stimulants was associated with elevated rates of AOD use, and
number of motives endorsed and AOD use were positively relat-
ed. Students appear to be using these prescription drugs non-
medically, mainly to enhance performance or get high.
Key Words: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), col-
lege students, methylphenidate, motives, prescription stimulants
he illicit use of prescription stimulants in US college
student populations is well documented.1­4 Despite
the increased recognition of this form of drug abuse,
research describing the motives for the illicit use of pre-
scription stimulants is scarce. In a search of the extant liter-
ature on this topic, we found only 12 published reports
(summarized in Table 1).1,3,5­14 Just as research on the
motives for alcohol use has added to researchers' under-
standing of drinking behavior,15 we suggest that under-
standing the motives for the illicit use of prescription stim-
ulants will help provide insights into the potential short- and
long-term consequences from this behavior.
Our primary objective in the current study was to make a
systematic examination of the prevalence and motives that
undergraduate college students report for the illicit use of pre-
scription stimulants. A secondary objective was to examine
the associations between motives for the illicit use of pre-
scription stimulants and alcohol and other drug (AOD) use.
METHOD
The Institutional Review Board at the University of
Michigan approved the protocol for the present study and
all participating students gave informed consent. The study
was conducted during a 1-month period in March and April
of 2003, drawing on a total undergraduate population of
21,294 full-time students (10,860 women and 10,434 men).
Two drug-related surveys were being conducted at the same
time and we did not want to burden undergraduate students
with taking 2 similar surveys. Therefore, we surveyed the
entire population but this study was based on a random
sample of 19,278 students and the other study used the
remaining students. We sent the sample group an e-mail
message describing the study and inviting them to self-
administer the Student Life Survey (SLS) by using a unique
password and clicking on a link to access the Web survey.
The Web survey was maintained on an Internet site running
under the secure socket layer protocol to ensure privacy and
security. We sent 3 reminder e-mails to nonrespondents. By
participating in the survey, students became eligible for a
sweepstakes of 13 cash prizes ranging from $100 to $1,000.
At the time this research was conducted, Christian J. Teter was
a postdoctoral research fellow with the National Institute on Drug
Abuse, College of Pharmacy and Substance Abuse Research
Center at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where Sean
Esteban McCabe is an assistant research scientist, James A.
Cranford is a postdoctoral research fellow; Carol J. Boyd is
Director of the Substance Abuse Research Center and a professor
of Nursing and Women's Studies; and Sally K. Guthrie is a asso-
ciate professor of pharmacy in the College of Pharmacy and
Department of Psychiatry at the University of Michigan. Dr Teter
is now with Northeastern University, Bouvé College of Health
Sciences in Boston, Massachusetts, & McLean Hospital, Alcohol
and Drug Abuse Treatment Program in Belmont, Massachusetts.

Instrument
Researchers at the University of Michigan Substance
Abuse Research Center developed and pilot tested the SLS
in 1993, drawing from questionnaire items in the Monitor-
ing the Future (MTF) study,17 the CORE survey,18 and the
College Alcohol Study.19 Study design, procedures, and
reliability of measures in the SLS are described in more
detail elsewhere.20,21
Measures
We collected demographic information, including gen-
der, race or ethnicity, and class year. We also assessed illic-
it prescription stimulant use (ie, use of prescription stimu-
lants not prescribed by a doctor), licit prescription stimulant
use (ie, use of prescription stimulants prescribed by a doc-
tor), and AOD use. Finally, we asked participants about
their motivations for illicit use of prescription stimulants.
To assess the lifetime prevalence of the illicit use of pre-
scription stimulants, the following item was included in the
survey: "Sometimes people use prescription drugs that were
meant for other people, even when their own doctor has not
prescribed it for them. On how many occasions in your LIFE-
TIME have you used the following types of drugs, NOT pre-
scribed to you?" "Stimulant medication (eg, Ritalin,
Dexedrine, Adderall, Concerta)." Consistent with national
research,2 the response scale was: (1) never, (2) 1­2 occa-
sions, (3) 3­5 occasions, (4) 6­9 occasions, (5) 10­19 occa-
sions, (6) 20­39 occasions, and (7) 40+ occasions.
We used the following question to assess illicit use of
prescription stimulants during the past year: "On how many
occasions in the PAST 12 MONTHS have you used the fol-
lowing types of drugs, NOT prescribed to you?" "Stimulant
medication (eg, Ritalin, Dexedrine, Adderall, Concerta)."
The response scale was: (1) never, (2) 1­2 occasions, (3)
3­5 occasions, (4) 6­9 occasions, (5) 10­19 occasions, (6)
20­39 occasions, and (7) 40+ occasions.
If a student endorsed the LIFETIME illicit use of pre-
scription stimulants, we asked the following question on the
survey to assess the motives for this behavior: "Please pro-
vide the REASON(S) why you used a stimulant medication
not prescribed to you?" (Check all that apply). Based on
previous literature (see Table 1), the survey provided 6
fixed-item choices for the students to choose from, using
lifetime as the time frame of analysis. The items were: (1)
"Because it helps me concentrate," (2) "Because it helps
increase my alertness," (3) "Because it counteracts the
effects of other drugs," (4) "Because it gives me a high," (5)
"Other (Specify)" [open-ended text box], and (6) "Re-
fused." To provide an opportunity for students to choose
motives that were not represented in these items, we includ-
ed an open-ended text box in the Other (Specify) item that
asked respondents to list additional motives for the illicit
use of prescription stimulants. This open-ended question
also allowed us to determine whether the items we devel-
oped provided adequate coverage of possible motives for
the illicit use of prescription stimulants. The other items we
developed did indeed provide adequate coverage of possible
motives for the illicit use of prescription stimulants.
Data Analysis
To meet our objectives of determining the prevalence of
illicit use of prescription stimulants and examining students'
motives for this form of drug abuse, we established frequen-
cies for each fixed-item motive. Then we developed an index
of the number of motives each respondent endorsed to (1)
determine the average number of motives for illicit prescrip-
tion stimulant use and (2) assess whether or not providing
more motives for the illicit use of prescription stimulants
was associated with higher rates of AOD use. We used chi-
square analyses to examine differences in motives between
men and women and to assess differences in AOD use on the
basis of individual motives students gave for the illicit use of
prescription stimulants as well as the motives index.
Because of multiple comparisons, we adjusted alpha levels
(p < .001) to reduce the likelihood of Type I errors. Finally,
we compared the distribution in motives between those who
had endorsed illicit prescription stimulant use who were also
prescribed stimulants during their lifetime and those who
had illicitly used prescription stimulants without ever having
received a prescription for stimulant use.
We compared the distribution of the frequency ranges (ie,
1­2 occasions, 3­5 occasions, 6­9 occasions, etc.) as well
as the proportion of each motive within each frequency
range to explore whether reporting a specific motive was
associated with more frequent ingestion of illicit prescrip-
tion stimulants (eg, was reporting the use of prescription
stimulants to "get high" associated with more frequent pre-
scription stimulant ingestion?).
To identify other clinically significant motives for the
illicit use of prescription stimulants, we conducted a latent-
content analysis of the students' responses provided in the
Other (Specify) item. The process for analyzing these qual-
itative data involved 3 phases: During the first phase of the
content analysis, 2 of the authors read all of the responses
and individually identified dominant themes that emerged
from the students' responses. These 2 authors discussed and
reached consensus on the themes. After agreeing on the
themes, they established 13 categories that corresponded to
the themes. During the second phase, the authors estab-
lished indicators for each category. Hence, the indicators
became the operational definition for the category. During
the third phase, 2 independent and senior researchers used
the operational definitions for the respective categories to
code the students' responses into mutually exclusive cate-
gories. It is these data that are reported here. We defined
interrater agreement as the number of responses agreed
upon by 4 raters divided by the total number of responses
assessed. The 4 raters included the 2 authors who developed
the thematic categories and the 2 independent raters. We
used a random sample of 40 open-ended responses to obtain
an interrater agreement of 90% for the 4 raters.

MOTIVES FOR ILLICIT STIMULANT USE
RESULTS
Sample
The final sample consisted of 9,161 undergraduate stu-
dents. As the data in Table 2 indicate, the demographic char-
acteristics of the final sample closely resembled the charac-
teristics of the overall student population. However, the
final obtained sample included more undergraduate women
than in the overall student population based on chi-square
analysis (p < .001), which is consistent with national sur-
veys of college students,16 and slightly more White students
and fewer seniors relative to the overall student population
(p < .001).
Prevalence Rates and Motives for Use
More than 8.1% of the undergraduate student sample (n
= 689) reported the illicit use of prescription stimulants in
their lifetime, and 5.4% (n = 458) reported illicit use in the
past year; undergraduate men reported significantly higher
lifetime rates than did undergraduate women (9.3% vs
7.2%, p < .001). Lifetime rates were higher for White
(9.5%) and Hispanic (8.9%) students than for African-
American (2.7%), Asian (4.9%), or other racial student
groups (5.8%), 2(4, N = 8,460) = 55.08, p < .001.
The primary motives that students gave for using pre-
scription stimulants illicitly were (1) to help with concentra-
tion, (2) to increase alertness, and (3) to get high. We
observed no gender differences in motives for illicit use. The
frequencies for each motive and the index describing the
number of motives endorsed are presented in Table 3.
Approximately half the students who endorsed the illicit use
of prescription stimulants gave more than 1 motive for this
behavior. On average, students reported 1.65 ± 0.91 motives
(range 0­5, mode 1.0) for the illicit use of prescription stim-
ulants. Of the 689 students who endorsed the lifetime illicit
use of prescription stimulants, 31 did not provide a motive

for their behavior, 19 students chose the "Refused" catego-
ry, and 12 students did not provide any motive.
The proportion of each motive within a given frequency
range was relatively consistent (see Figure 1). For example,
using prescription stimulants "to help concentrate" accounted
for approximately 30% of the motives, regardless of the num-
ber of occasions of illicit stimulant use. However, the distrib-
ution in the actual frequency range of illicit prescription stim-
ulant use was skewed, with a steady decrease in the number
of students reporting more frequent use. For example, a total
of 254 students reported the illicit use of prescription stimu-
lants on 1 to 2 occasions, compared with 45 who reported 40
or more occasions. The data in Figure 1 do not represent those
31 students who did not provide a motive and therefore con-
sist of 658 students.
Approximately 14% (n = 97) of the illicit prescription
stimulant users also reported being prescribed stimulant
medication in their lifetime. We found no differences in any
of the motivations endorsed by those illicit users who were
also prescribed stimulants in their lifetime compared with
the illicit users who had never been prescribed stimulants.
For example, approximately 40% of those who endorsed
the illicit use of prescription stimulants provided "to get
high" as a motive, regardless of whether they had also been
legitimately prescribed stimulant medications.
Alcohol and Other Drug Use Behaviors
Chi-square analysis revealed significantly higher rates of
AOD use for those students who reported the illicit use of
prescription stimulants, compared with nonstimulant users
(see Table 4). Furthermore, regardless of the motive or
motives for the illicit use of prescription stimulants, the 689
students who endorsed these behaviors also reported signif-
icantly higher rates of AOD use in the recent past. For
example, only 1.6% of those who reported no illicit pre-
scription stimulant use had used cocaine in the past year,
whereas those who reported the illicit use of prescription
stimulants to help them concentrate, increase alertness, or
get high had past-year cocaine prevalence rates of 28.6%,
31.1%, and 35.4%, respectively. Data in Table 4 also show
that the "counteracts the effects of other drugs" and the "to
get high" motives were strongly associated with cocaine
and amphetamine use. Finally, AOD use was positively
related to the number of motives given for the illicit use of
prescription stimulants, particularly for cocaine, ecstasy,
and amphetamine use (See Table 5).
Face Validity and Content Analysis
Of the 689 students who reported the illicit use of pre-
scription stimulants, 10% did not choose any of the motiva-
tion items that we provided in the survey. This 10% con-
sisted of those students who chose the Other (Specify) only
(n = 39) and Refused (n = 19) categories as well as those
who provided no motive at all (n = 12). In other words, 90%
of the students chose at least 1 of the fixed items to explain
their illicit use of prescription stimulants. This suggests that
our initial coding scheme provided sufficient coverage of
the content domain regarding the motivations for the illicit
use of prescription stimulants.
Eighty-seven students gave 94 open-ended responses
concerning motives for the illicit use of prescription stimu-
lants. "Curiosity and experimentation" as well as "to study"
were the most frequently endorsed responses. In fact, more
than 20% of the students who responded to the open-ended
question reported they had illicitly used prescription stimu-
lants to enhance academic or work performance and nearly
20% provided curiosity or experimentation as their motive
for the illicit use of these agents.

Prevalence of Illicit Use of Stimulant Medications
In this study, we found that 8.1% of the undergraduate
sample of university students reported they had used pre-
scription stimulants illicitly in their lifetime and 5.4% had
done so in the past year. These prevalence rates are compara-
ble to college students nationally2 and to students at the Uni-
versity of Florida,22 but are lower than findings from other
studies conducted at small colleges.1­3 When comparing
prevalence rates between institutions, it is important to con-
sider that there are significant differences in AOD use rates
among student populations from different colleges and uni-
versities in the United States.16,23,24 Despite differences
between individual campuses, it may be the common features
of the college environment (eg, staying awake for extended
periods of time) that lead to higher rates of illicit use of pre-
scription stimulants. In fact, Babcock and Byrne1 speculated
that because stimulants such as methylphenidate delay the
need to sleep, this characteristic contributes to the likelihood

of experimentation in college students. Regardless of motive,
it appears that the illicit use of prescription stimulants is a
problem among undergraduate students at colleges and uni-
versities2 and therefore needs to be addressed both clinically
and through additional research efforts.
The prevalence rate we found in the present study was
considerably higher than the rates of illicit use of stimulants
reported in the general population.25 Wu and Schlenger,25
who used data from the National Household Survey on Drug
Abuse (1995­1998), found that less than 1% of the US
household population aged 12 and older reported nonmed-
ical use of stimulants in the past year. However, that study
specifically included stimulant anorexiants such as Fastin
and Ionamin, which make interpretation of the results more
difficult; they acknowledged that the motives for illicit psy-
chostimulant use warrant further investigation. In addition,
Johnston and colleagues2 found that college students report-
ed considerably higher rates of illicit use of methylphenidate
(Ritalin) in the past year than their same-age peers who were
not attending college. Collectively, these studies suggest that

the illicit use of prescription stimulants among college stu-
dents may be occurring at higher rates than among noncol-
lege populations.
Men reported illicit use of prescription stimulants more
often than women did, which is consistent with other studies
among college students.2,5 Nationally, gender differences
were more pronounced with college men endorsing the past
year nonmedical use of Ritalin (8.4%) at significantly higher
rates than were college women (3.9%).2 White and Hispanic
students reported higher lifetime rates of illicit stimulant use,
and these findings are consistent with racial differences in
heavy drinking16 and marijuana use.24
Motives for Illicit Use of Prescription Stimulants
Many students in our sample reported that they used pre-
scription stimulants to help with concentration, to increase
alertness, or to get high. This finding is in agreement with
the conceptual frameworks proposed previously.3,8,9,26,27
Kollins and associates8 posited that methylphenidate misuse
is a means of obtaining other forms of reinforcement (eg,
social interactions/partying, work, or studying) or as a
means of avoiding other negative consequence. During a
clinical study designed to determine whether reduced sleep
times would enhance the reinforcing effects of methylphen-
idate, Roehrs and associates26 found that performance-
enhancing and fatigue-altering effects mediated the prefer-
ence for methylphenidate. In a survey of college students,
motivations for the illicit use of prescription amphetamines
were attributed to "academic" and "recreational" purposes
and were similar to our findings that there were no gender
differences in motivations.5 In an early report on high
school students, the top 5 reasons given by nonmedical
users of amphetamines were: (1) to get more energy (69%),
(2) to stay awake (61%), (3) to experiment or see what it's
like (50%), (4) to feel good, get high (45%), and (5) to lose
weight (40%).27 However, that report included the nonmed-
ically supervised use of all amphetamines and not those
specifically used for the treatment of attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Finally, the use of methyl-
phenidate has been conceptualized as belonging to 1 of 2
categories--to stay alert and awake to study or party longer
and to induce euphoria.9 Overall, the results of our present
study provide evidence that support these conceptual frame-
works.
AOD Use Behaviors
According to our data, students who reported the illicit
use of prescription stimulants are engaging in significantly
higher rates of AOD use than are nonstimulant users. The
AOD use rates were similarly elevated among those who
reported illicit use of prescription stimulants, compared
with nonstimulant users regardless of the motives they gave
for this behavior. For example, compared with nonstimulant
users, the students who use prescription stimulants to help
them concentrate had similar rates of AOD use to those
using prescription stimulants to get high. This finding is
contrary to the notion that some students are using small
doses solely to study and are not engaging in excessive
risky behaviors. Despite these similarities in AOD use, the
relationship between the "counteracts" other drugs and "get
high" motives and illicit drug use (ie, cocaine and amphet-
amines) appeared to be particularly strong, which may
reflect a more extensive stimulant use profile for those stu-
dents who use illicit prescription stimulants to counteract
the effects of other drugs or to get high. Furthermore,
according to our findings, those endorsing more motives for
the illicit use of prescription stimulants may have higher
rates of AOD use. A similar relationship exists for alcohol
consumption in that those who are strongly motivated to
drink for various reasons (eg, increasing positive experi-
ences or avoiding negative experiences) are at heightened
risk for developing alcohol problems.15 This finding sug-
gests that, to some extent, motivations for illicit stimulant
use may generalize to other substances.
Finally, the frequency range of illicit use of prescription
stimulants seems to be independent of the motives given,
implying that those using prescription stimulants to con-
centrate and increase alertness are using these drugs at rates
similar to those using prescription stimulants to get high.
Face Validity and Content Analysis
Our fixed items thoroughly represented the motives
endorsed by students, which supports the face validity of
our items and suggests that the motivations identified from
previous literature are the most common in this population.
This finding indicates that our category scheme and the lit-
erature from which it was developed capture the majority of
important motives for the illicit use of prescription stimu-
lants. In addition, some motives emerged from the open-
ended item that might be clinically significant and impor-
tant for future research. For example, 17 students reported
that they used prescription stimulants from curiosity or
experimentally, and 88% of these students chose this motive
as the sole explanation for their illicit use of prescription
stimulants. The other common motive that surfaced during
the content analysis was to "enhance study or work perfor-
mance"; this motive should be considered for inclusion in
future surveys as separate from "helps me concentrate" or
"increases alertness" because these motives may or may not
be directly associated with academic or work performance.
Limitations and Strengths
We should note several limitations in this study before
readers assess the implications of our findings. Our sample
consists of students from a single campus, which limits the
generalizability of our results. In addition, our study sample
was drawn from a predominantly White student population
attending a large public university. Therefore, our findings
need to be compared with more diverse samples (both of
students attending college and young adults who are not
college students). Nonresponse may have introduced poten-
tial bias in the present study; however, these concerns were
somewhat reduced because the demographic characteristics
in the final obtained sample closely resembled the overall
260 JOURNAL OF AMERICAN COLLEGE HEALTH
TETER ET AL
student population. In addition, the rates of drug use in the
present study were comparable to rates found in other
national substance use surveys of college students.2,28 We
did not survey students about the quantity of prescription
stimulants they used illicitly per occasion. Also, we did not
collect information on the route of administration (ie,
intranasal or injection), which would have an important
impact on the long-term morbidity and mortality as well as
the abuse potential of stimulant medications.29,30
Several strengths of the present study are also notewor-
thy. Our measure of motives for the illicit use of prescrip-
tion stimulants was based on existing literature and appears
to capture the most important motivations in this college
sample. Further, our relatively large randomly selected sam-
ple provided us with an opportunity to examine the motives
for the illicit use of prescription stimulants in a high-risk
population (ie, college students). The large sample size
enabled us to obtain a substantial amount of qualitative data
that proved invaluable in assessing the validity of the items
we used to assess the illicit use of prescription stimulants.
From a more general perspective, our use of a Web design
is a novel feature, and our results highlight the usefulness of
this method for further research on illicit drug use among
college students.
Future Practice
Clinicians, particularly those working directly with col-
lege students (eg, pharmacists, nurses, and primary care
doctors working at college health clinics), should be aware
of nonabusable prescription medication alternatives for the
treatment of ADHD. For example, atomoxetine is a
nonabusable, noncontrolled substance that was recently
approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the
treatment of ADHD in children, adolescents, and adults.31
In addition, limited data are available suggesting that bupro-
pion may also be effective for treating the symptoms of
ADHD, although this use is not approved for this condi-
tion.32 However, despite the recent approval of atomoxetine
and the limited information available for bupropion, no
strong data are available that indicate that these drugs might
be as effective as stimulant medications for treating the
symptoms of ADHD. Therefore, these medications may be
especially useful in those patients at risk for abusing their
prescription stimulants and in those patients with a history
of substance abuse. The use of novel pharmaceutical deliv-
ery systems such as those used in Concerta or the methyl-
phenidate patch may limit the abuse liability of methyl-
phenidate by decreasing the rate of the drugs' delivery of
methylphenidate to the brain. In fact, a letter to the editor of
the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adoles-
cent Psychiatry33 described the difficulty of extracting
methylphenidate from the polymer in Concerta tablets, pro-
viding support that this approach may help curb the abuse
of prescription stimulants. Furthermore, the reinforcing
effects of methylphenidate have been partly attributed to
rapid changes in serum drug concentrations, which may
lead to fast dopamine increases in the central nervous sys-
tem.30 Parents, school officials, and healthcare workers need
to be educated on the potential for abuse with stimulant
medications, despite their proven efficacy in treating
ADHD. Prevention efforts might help curb the abuse of pre-
scription stimulants through screening and assessment.
Clinicians who work with college students may find it
useful to ask them about their motives for illicit use of pre-
scription stimulants because our results suggest that these
motives may indicate involvement with other substances.
Postintoxication depression and the onset of suicidal
ideation have been reported after the abuse of methyl-
phenidate,11 and these symptoms should be monitored
closely in any person suspected of abusing prescription
stimulants.
Future Research
Qualitative research is needed to assess the motives for
the illicit use of prescription stimulants in various popula-
tions, such as urban residents, those not attending college,
and those with diverse racial backgrounds. Further refine-
ment of the measure of motives for the illicit use of pre-
scription stimulants (eg, using a Likert-type rather than a
categorical response format) would facilitate psychometric
evaluation of this scale and allow for assessing the strength
of various motives for illicit use of prescription stimulants.
In addition, comparing the motives for use among those
abusing prescription stimulants by alternative routes of
administration (ie, intranasally or intravenously) and among
those using varying doses might help clarify different char-
acteristics of illicit users.
The long-term morbidity and mortality associated with
the illicit use of prescription stimulants should be examined.
In particular, studies that evaluate the routes of administra-
tion and what quantities are being used would be informative
in assessing the potential long-term consequences of use, as
would studies that review the concurrent abuse of prescrip-
tion stimulants and alcohol. For example, Massello and Car-
penter34 reported at least 1 fatality after the intranasal abuse
of methylphenidate coingested with alcohol. Longitudinal
data would provide evidence for the trajectories of the illicit
use of prescription stimulants for assessing the impact of this
problem over time and would be valuable in investigating
the developmental course and long-term impact of this prob-
lem in different populations. Studies should be conducted to
determine to what degree college health professionals, such
as primary care doctors and psychiatrists in campus health
clinics, write prescriptions for stimulant medications. Tar-
geting these health professionals may be an effective strategy
for education and prevention efforts. Finally, learning about
the quantities of stimulants being prescribed by healthcare
professionals may help identify whether these medications
are being made available in excessive amounts resulting in
increased rates of diversion.
Summary and Conclusions
College students use prescription stimulants illicitly for
many reasons. Our findings highlight the importance of

MOTIVES FOR ILLICIT STIMULANT USE
assessing the motives for the illicit use of prescription stim-
ulants and suggest that these motivations may be associated
with greater use of alcohol and other drugs, especially if the
student reports the illicit use of such stimulants to counter-
act the effect of other drugs or is using them to get high. In
addition, those students who provide multiple motives for
the illicit use of prescription stimulants may also be using
excessive amounts of AODs. Although the long-term mor-
bidity and mortality from these behaviors remain unknown,
the problem of prescription stimulant abuse exists in the
college population and should be addressed both clinically
and experimentally.
