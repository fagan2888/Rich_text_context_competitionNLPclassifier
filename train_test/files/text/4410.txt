Introduction
The introduction of anti-tumour necrosis factor
(TNF) monoclonal antibodies as therapeutic
agents in auto-inflammatory disorders has revo-
lutionized the medical management strategies of
these diseases and the health-related quality of
life of patients. In the case of inflammatory bowel
diseases [IBDs, which include Crohn's disease
(CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)], the use of
anti-TNF agents has led to a decrease in
hospitalization rates, risk of surgery and health-
related costs.1
However, and despite the anti-TNF success in the
treatment of many IBD patients, some of them do
not respond to the drug during the induction phase,
whereas others experience a loss of response later
during treatment.2 Accumulating evidence from the
literature suggests that the outcomes of CD and UC
patients on infliximab (IFX) are strongly related

Abstract
Background: Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)-based algorithms can be used to guide
infliximab (IFX) adjustments in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. This study aimed to
explore a rapid IFX-quantification test from a clinical perspective.
Methods: This manuscript describes a prospective cohort study involving 110 ulcerative colitis
(UC) patients on the maintenance phase of IFX. IFX trough levels were quantified using a rapid
quantification assay and a commonly-used reference kit.
Results: Irrespective of the assay used to measure IFX, its through levels were statistically
different between patients with and without endoscopic remission (Mayo endoscopic score
= 0), as well as between patients stratified by their faecal calprotectin (FC) levels. Despite
the fact that the two methods correlated well with each other [Spearman's rank correlation
coefficient = 0.843, p < 0.001; intraclass correlation coefficients = 0.857, 95% confidence
interval (CI): 0.791­0.903], there was a discernible systematic variation; values obtained with
the reference kit were on average 2.62 units higher than those obtained with the rapid assay.
Notwithstanding, 3 µg/ml was shown to be an acceptable cut-off to assess endoscopic status
and inflammatory burden levels using both assays. The percentage of patients that had a
positive outcome when the IFX concentration measured by the rapid assay ranked above 3 µg/
ml was 88% both for a Mayo endoscopic score  1 and for an FC concentration <250 µg/g.
Conclusions: Based on this study, we concluded that using the rapid IFX assessment system
with a 3 µg/ml threshold is a reliable alternative to the time-consuming enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays in patients on the maintenance phase of IFX.

with the levels of the drug found in the organism.3­10
From a physician's perspective, understanding the
reasons that lead to unresponsiveness is key to delin-
eate future therapeutic strategies, which can include
a dose intensification, a switch to another anti-
TNF agent, or adding immunosuppressive drugs
or steroids. In this context, the precise and accurate
measurement of the circulating drug levels, known
as therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), has a key
role. Several TDM-based algorithms and dash-
boards are being developed to assist the physician in
the therapeutic decision-making process.2,11­13
Moreover, TDM may also be useful to identify
cases with supra-therapeutic drug levels (which can
be de-escalated to prevent the appearance of adverse
effects), and has been proven as a cost-effective
strategy when compared with the traditional empir-
ical-based adjustment of drug dosage.14,15
Given the importance of TDM in patients on IFX,
one can easily find a number of different commer-
cial kits that can measure the concentration of this
agent from the patient's serum, most of them rely-
ing on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) approach. However, these kits have a turn-
around time of approximately 8 h, delaying the IFX
dose adjustment to the following infusion (usually
6­8 weeks later). A rapid IFX-quantification sys-
tem, which allows a fast (15 min) assessment of IFX
from a patient's serum, has been recently launched
in the market by the Bühlmann® company
(Schönenbuch, Switzerland). Not only does this
system allows an immediate adjustment of the IFX
dosage, but it also has the advantage of being a user-
friendly desktop device, which can be easily oper-
ated by any nurse, technician or physician without
the requirement of specific laboratory facilities.
We have recently validated the utilisation of the
Bühlmann® rapid assay in a laboratorial context,
and concluded that this kit constitutes a reliable
and fast alternative to the traditional ELISA
kits.16 In this study we aimed to take a step further
and to assess the clinical sensitivity and specificity
of this rapid assay, by addressing the existence
and interpretability of IFX cut-off values able to
guide the therapeutic decision-making process.
Material and methods
Cohort
UC patients on the maintenance phase of IFX
therapy were prospectively and consecutively
recruited from 10 different university and commu-
nity hospitals. Only patients older than 18 years
and with at least 14 weeks of IFX treatment were
invited to participate. Exclusion criteria included
history of malignancy in the previous 5 years,
opportunistic infections or demyelinating diseases;
existence of adenomatous polyps or known viral
infections; and pregnancy and breastfeeding.
This study was approved by the ethic committee
of all hospitals involved and by the Portuguese
Data Protection Authority. All patients enrolled
signed an informed written consent.
IFX-quantification assays
A total of 110 samples collected from the same
number of patients were assayed to determine their
serum trough IFX levels using two different com-
mercial kits: Quantum Blue® Infliximab:
Quantitative Lateral Flow Assay (Bühlmann,
Schönenbuch, Switzerland), hereafter referred to
as QB, and Level Infliximab M2920 kit (Sanquin,
Amsterdam, the Netherlands), hereafter referred to
as Sanquin. Both kits were used strictly following
manufacturers' instructions. The lower and upper
limits of quantification were 0.4 µg/ml and 20 µg/ml
for the QB assay, and 0.08 µg/ml (1:200) and 25
µg/ml (1:1500) for the Sanquin assay, respectively.
Whenever the results obtained were below or above
these limits of quantification, they were considered
to be at those same limits. Sanquin was chosen as
the reference test as it is a widely used kit in both
laboratorial and clinical contexts. All measure-
ments were carried out by the same researcher.
Assessment of disease outcomes
Disease status, including clinical evaluation,
endoscopic and histological activity, and quantifi-
cation of faecal calprotectin (FC), was assessed at
the same time as the IFX concentration (i.e.
immediately before an IFX infusion).
Clinical evaluation.Clinical remission was evalu-
ated according to the global Mayo score. Patients
were considered to be in clinical remission if their
global Mayo score was 2 and no individual sub-
score was above 1.
Endoscopic evaluation.Endoscopic activity was
evaluated using the Mayo endoscopic subscore:17
mucosal healing was defined as a Mayo endo-
scopic subscore equal to 0 or 1.

Histological evaluation.The presence of histologi-
cal inflammation was evaluated through the anal-
ysis of an average of two biopsy samples from the
sigmoid and the rectum. Samples were classified
following the Geboes score,18 and histological
remission was defined as a Geboes index 3.0.
All samples were the subject of a central reading
by two independent pathologists blinded to the
patients' disease status and endoscopic results.
Disagreements between pathologists were
resolved by a review including a third pathologist
(K. Geboes) and using a multiheaded micro-
scope, defining the final score.
Quantification of faecal calprotectin.Stool sam-
ples were collected and kept at 4°C (for a maxi-
mum of 48 h) until shipment to the central
laboratory (Department of Pharmacology and
Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine of University
of Porto, Portugal). FC was extracted from stools
within a maximum of 7 days after collection using
the `faecal sample preparation kit' (Roche Diag-
nostics, Germany) according to the instructions
provided by the manufacturer, and stored at
-80°C until quantification. FC concentration in
each sample was determined using the QB kit
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Statistical analysis
Categorical variables were described through
absolute (n) and relative (%) frequencies and
continuous variables were described as mean and
standard deviation, median, percentiles, and min-
imum/ maximum values when appropriate. All the
reported p-values were two-sided, and p-values
<0.05 were considered to be statistically signifi-
cant. The ability of the measured IFX concentra-
tions to assess the various disease outcomes was
evaluated by plotting Receiver Operating
Characteristic curves and computing the Area
Under the Curve. All data were arranged, pro-
cessed and analysed with SPSS® v.20.0 data
(Statistical Package for Social Sciences, IBM
Corp., Armonk, NY). Graphs were computed
with Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, Inc., CA,
USA).
Results
Characterization of the cohort and disease
outcomes
The main baseline characteristics of this
study's cohort are depicted in Table 1. Females
constituted 55% of the entire population, and
only 5% of all patients were current smokers. A
minority of patients (2%) had a proctitis diagno-
sis, whereas 49% of them had left-side colitis and
an equal percentage had extensive colitis. Overall
22% of the patients were azathioprine (AZA)
intolerant, whereas 59% and 23% were classified
as corticodependent and corticoresistant, respec-
tively. At the time of study inclusion, 61% and
9% of all patients were on AZA and steroids,
respectively.
The disease outcomes addressed during this study
are listed in Table 2. Regarding clinical evalua-
tion, the majority of patients (72%) had a global
Mayo score 2, and 69% of the entire population
were considered to be in clinical remission (i.e.
had a global Mayo score 2 and no individual
subscore >1). Moreover, 58% or 81% of all
patients were considered to be in mucosal healing
(endoscopic Mayo score = 0 or 1, respectively).
Regarding FC levels, 66% of the population were
below the threshold of 250 µg/g. Finally, the over-
all median [interquartile range (IQR)] of the IFX
trough levels was 6.59 µg/ml (3.03­14.66) using
the Sanquin kit, and 5.25 µg/ml (1.70­9.58) using
the rapid QB assay.

Analytical comparison between the two
different IFX-quantification methods
IFX through levels measured by the Sanquin and
QB levels were highly correlated [Spearman's
rank correlation coefficient = 0.843, p < 0.001;
intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.857,
95%CI:0.791­0.903],asshowninSupplementary
Figure 1. However, the mean difference and its CI
show that the concentrations obtained with the
Sanquin kit were, on average, higher than those
obtained with the QB (average difference = 2.62
µg/ml, 95% CI: 1.64­3.60). Finally, the Bland­
Altman plot shows that the difference between
values measured with both kits increases with the
increase in IFX concentrations, but is close to 0
for concentrations below 5 µg/ml (Supplementary
Figure 2).
Association between IFX trough levels and
outcomes
The medians of serum trough IFX concentra-
tions detected with each method for contrasting
disease outcomes (concerning clinical remission,
endoscopic Mayo score and FC levels) are repre-
sented in Figure 1. The results show that IFX
trough levels were higher in patients who had
positive outcomes irrespective of the assay used,
and these results were significant for endoscopic
remission (using endoscopic Mayo score = 0 as
the criterion for remission) and FC.
We then applied different IFX cut-offs (from
1­10) to the results obtained from each kit, and
assessed their ability to predict patient outcomes.
The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive
value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV),
accuracy and Kappa for each case are depicted
in Supplementary Table 1. A positive test was
defined as having an IFX level below the cut-off,
whereas the disease status was defined as having
a negative outcome (not being in clinical remis-
sion, having an endoscopic Mayo score >0 or
>1, or having an FC level >250 µg/g). NPV rep-
resents the percentage of patients who have a
positive outcome (no disease) among those who
have an IFX above the defined cut-off (negative
test result), whereas PPV represents the percent-
age of patients who have a negative outcome
(disease) among those that have an IFX below
the defined cut-off (positive test result).
Perceptively, the performance values vary widely
with the cut-off chosen and the outcome evaluated,
but are considerably similar for both kits when the
conditions mentioned are kept stable (i.e. same
cut-off and outcome). Figure 2 represents the accu-
racy (i.e. the sum of true positives and negatives) of
the results obtained with either QB or Sanquin in
terms of clinical status, endoscopic score and FC
level using different cut-offs. The results show that
Sanquin and QB have a very similar variation of the
accuracy along the different cut-offs. Overall, a
value of 3 µg/ml seems to be an acceptable cut-off
for QB, although lower values could be considered
in a few situations.
NPV has an important role in this context, as it
represents the percentage of patients who have an
IFX concentration above the cut-off and would
not benefit from a drug adjustment. And in fact,
74, 62, 83 and 86% of patients with an IFX
trough level >3 µg/ml measured by the Sanquin

kit are in clinical remission, have a Mayo endo-
scopic score of 0, have a Mayo endoscopic score
1, and have an FC level <250 µg/g, respectively,
whereas these values are 74, 65, 88 and 88% for
the QB kit.
When adjusting the IFX cut-off to evaluate clini-
cal status to 1 (with Sanquin) or 2 (with QB), the
percentage of patients that test above these values
and are, indeed, in clinical remission, is 71%
and 73%, respectively. This shows that although
accuracy can be higher, the NPV is slightly
smaller for these lower cut-offs. The same thing
occurs when one addresses endoscopic remis-
sion (using endoscopic Mayo score 1 as the
remission criterion) using IFX cut-offs <3 g/ml:
the accuracy is higher, but the NPV is lower. On
the other hand, the PPV (percentage of patients
that are below the IFX cut-off and could benefit
from an IFX dose adjustment) are consistently
lower than the NPVs, and for a cut-off of 3 µg/ml
vary from 23­50% with the Sanquin kit, and from
23­55% with the rapid QB kit.
To test whether the IFX values measured by these
kits could also be used to assess deep remission,
the Geboes index was considered as a criterion to
establish histological remission, and the sensitiv-
ity, specificity, PPV, NPV, accuracy and Kappa
for each cut-off concerning the occurrence of

deep remission (with or without the histological
criterion) are depicted in Supplementary Table 2.
Although a cut-off of 3 g/ml seems to be
acceptable to assess histological remission irre-
spective of the kit used, the identification of one
specific cut-off in what concerns deep remission
is hampered by the overall stability of accuracy
across the different cut-offs.
Qualitative comparison between the two
different IFX-quantification methods
A qualitative comparison of the assays for a cut-
off of 3 µg/ml is depicted in Table 3, and shows an
accuracy of 88% and a Kappa (standard error of
the mean) of 0.718 (0.070). In fact, the distribu-
tion of patients according to a 3 µg/ml cut-off is
rather similar between both methods, with only
13 patients (12.0%) being placed differently (they
have IFX levels <3 µg/ml when using the rapid
QB test, but above that cut-off when using the
Sanquin test).
Discussion
Several commercial kits and different protocols
have been optimized for an accurate determina-
tion of IFX levels from patient serum, but the
recent development of a rapid IFX assessment
test holds the promise of revolutionizing the
TDM-based therapeutic algorithms, by allowing
an immediate adjustment of the IFX dosage (as
opposed to delaying this intervention to the fol-
lowing infusion cycle). This study aimed to assess
the clinical sensitivity and specificity of this rapid
assay, by using it to measure samples from 110
patients, fully characterized regarding their clini-
cal, endoscopic and inflammatory burden status.

The overall results and the clinical stratification
obtained using different cut-offs were compared
with those obtained using an already validated
and widely used IFX-quantification kit (Sanquin).
The results reported here show that although the
concentrations obtained by the different methods
are strongly correlated, there is a systematic varia-
tion: the concentrations measured by the Sanquin
kit were, on average, 2.62 units higher than those
measured by the rapid QB test, which is consistent
with the median IFX values obtained with each
method for the entire population. The Sanquin
kit's bias towards measuring higher values when
compared with other kits has been noticed
before.16,19 Overall, other methodological com-
parisons involving two or more IFX-quantification
assays show that, most of the times, the assays
compare quite well against each other (even when
they are not ELISA-based), but systematic devia-
tions are rather common and are likely to result
from the fact that different assays use different
antibodies with varying IFX affinities.19­25
The association of IFX serum levels with disease
outcomes or inflammatory markers such as clinical
response, clinical remission, mucosal healing, endo-
scopic improvement and C-reactive protein levels
have been often reported.3,5,6,8­10,26 Accordingly,
our results show that IFX trough levels were signifi-
cantly lower when patients had an endoscopic Mayo
score 1 or an FC concentration 250 µg/g. A
similar pattern was found for clinical remission and
for an endoscopic Mayo score >0 (i.e. patients who
have a negative outcome had lower IFX trough lev-
els), although in this case the results were not sig-
nificant. This might be due to the small size of the
cohort, or to the fact that the patients analysed were
very stable, most of them (80%) in clinical remis-
sion according to the Montreal classification and
with over 14 weeks of IFX therapy (primary nonre-
sponders were excluded).
Given the systematic differences encountered in
the quantification, one would expect the two dif-
ferent methods to have different clinical cut-offs.
However, that is not the case: 3 µg/ml is an accept-
able threshold for both assays particularly in what
concerns assessment of endoscopic status and
inflammatory burden (measured by the FC lev-
els). Regarding clinical status, although 3 µg/ml
may be a satisfactory cut-off, values of 1 and 2 µg/
ml can be considered for the Sanquin and QB
assays, respectively. These cut-offs have a margin-
ally better accuracy and smaller NPV when com-
pared with 3 µg/ml. The same holds true for IFX
cut-offs of 1 and 2 µg/ml when addressing endo-
scopic activity using an endoscopic Mayo score
1 as criterion for remission: the accuracy raises
and the NPV drops when compared with those of
a cut-off of 3 µg/ml. Concerning deep remission,
however, the different cut-offs seem to behave
similarly and it is not easy to choose a single value.
This is likely related to the fact that deep remis-
sion is a composite endpoint, and therefore reflects
the different behaviours of its components.
The lack of impact of the systematic bias observed
in the optimal clinical cut-off is easily explained
by observing the Bland­Altman plot: in fact, this
plot shows that the differences encountered in the
values measured by both methods are particularly
close to 0 for IFX levels <5 µg/ml. In other words,
at levels as low as those considered for the clinical
threshold, the assays seem to behave in a similar
fashion. This is supported by the comparative
analysis of the assay's results, which shows that
for a threshold of 3 µg/ml, 88% of the patients fall
equally above or below the cut-off irrespective of
the method used.

In practical terms, a clinical cut-off should help a
physician decide whether a patient may benefit
from an IFX dose adjustment. A cut-off of 3 µg/ml
has considerably high NPVs, which means that it
can exclude patients from benefiting of an IFX
dose adjustment with a considerable degree of cer-
tainty. Conversely, the PPVs are rather low, which
means that having an IFX trough concentration
below the defined cut-off does not necessarily
imply having clinical activity, endoscopic lesions
or a high inflammatory burden. In other words,
not all patients with IFX levels below the cut-off
will benefit from a dose intensification, and such a
decision must be contextualized with other indica-
tors (such as symptomatology, presence of anti-
bodies to IFX and biomarkers).
The 3 µg/ml (or closer) cut-off has been often
referred to in the literature,3,26,27 but so have
lower8,27­29 and higher ones,7,8,10,27 showing that
cut-offs are deeply related to the method used
and outcome being assessed, and studies such as
these are absolutely necessary to validate thresh-
olds and explore their interpretability. One word
of caution should be added: our results were
derived from a UC patient cohort, and are there-
fore only applicable in the context of UC. In fact,
the literature shows several instances in which the
parallel analysis of CD and UC patients yields
different cut-offs or different behaviours of the
same cut-off.8,27,28
This study has several strengths that should be
noticed, namely its prospective design with a sys-
tematic and inclusive evaluation of the therapeu-
tic response; and the fact that all quantifications
were performed by the same researcher, and
therefore the user can be excluded as a source of
variation. On the other hand, and as a limitation,
one should point out that the sample size was
relatively small, although similar to that used in
analogous studies;5,6,8,20,28 and that the occur-
rence and amount of anti-IFX in the clinical sam-
ples was not taken into consideration.
In conclusion, we have explored the applicability
of IFX trough level cut-offs using a recently
launched rapid QB test and comparing it with a
widely used ELISA kit. Overall, both assays have
a good quantitative and qualitative agreement,
and a cut-off of 3 µg/ml seems to be appropriate,
namely when one is assessing the endoscopic sta-
tus (using an endoscopic Mayo score = 0 as the
criterion for remission) or the inflammatory
burden. Different cut-offs can be considered for
specific situations, and this ultimately depends on
whether the user wants to optimize the accuracy
or the NPV of the results.
