Abstract
Objective: To evaluate risk factors for venous thrombosis in patients undergoing chemotherapy
via peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC).
Methods: Data regarding age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking history, diagnosis, medical
history, family history of thrombosis, haemoglobin level, and white blood cell (WBC) and platelet
counts were prospectively collected from consecutively recruited patients. Patients were
evaluated using six thrombotic risk-assessment scales prior to PICC. Assessments of the general
venous system and the catheterized vein and limb were made. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was
diagnosed by colour Doppler ultrasonography. Thrombosis risk factors were identified by logistic
regression analysis.
Results: Thrombosis occurred in 12/188 patients (6.38%). Age >60 years, BMI >25 kg/m2 and
WBC >11.4 Â 109/l were identified as independent risk factors for thrombosis. The incidence of
thrombosis was 16.6% (12/72) in patients with one or more risk factors, and 55.5% (five of nine) in
those with two or more risk factors.
Conclusions: Age >60 years, BMI >25 kg/m2 and WBC >1.4 Â 109/l are major risk factors for
thrombosis in Chinese patients undergoing PICC chemotherapy.

with malignant tumours have an eightfold
higher risk of venous thrombosis than
patients without tumours,4 and this risk is
especially great during infection, antineo-
plastic therapy and the perioperative
period.5 Peripherally inserted central cath-
eters (PICC) also increase the risk of
thrombosis, since their length and large
diameter (relative to peripheral vein diam-
eter) can lead to blood backflow during
long-term catheterization.6,7 Prophylactic
anticoagulation therapy should be tailored
to individual patient risk profiles,8 but
studies of thrombotic risk factors have
generally been limited to those undergoing
plastic, orthopaedic, vascular or trauma
surgery and are mostly retrospective. A
prospective study of the risk of thrombosis
in outpatients undergoing chemotherapy
presented a simple assessment scale for
risk of thrombosis, but investigated central
venous catheters and subjects of multiple
ethnicities.9 Body mass index (BMI)
>35 kg/m2 was identified as a thrombotic
risk factor,9 but this BMI is rare in Asian
populations (including Chinese, Indian,
Japanese and Korean subjects).10 The aim
of the present prospective study, therefore,
was to determine thrombotic risk factors in
Chinese patients undergoing chemotherapy
via PICC.
Patients and methods
Study population
The study prospectively recruited all con-
secutive patients undergoing PICC chemo-
therapy in the Department of Surgical
Oncology, Second Affiliated Hospital of
Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China,
between December 2010 and August 2011.
The study was approved by the Institutional
Ethics Committee of Second Affiliated
Hospital of Zhejiang University. All patients
provided written informed consent prior to
enrolment.
Assessment scales
Patients were evaluated using six thrombotic
risk assessment scales prior to PICC:
chemotherapy-associated venous thrombo-
embolism (VTE);9 Davidson­Caprini Risk-
Assessment Model;11,12 Wells et al.;13 Yale
et al.;14 Mommertz et al.;15 and Caprini.16
Data including age, sex, BMI, disease cat-
egory, haemoglobin (Hb) level, platelet
count, white blood cell (WBC) count, fasting
blood sugar, medical history (including
thrombus, other relevant diseases, smoking,
diarrhoea17 and family history of thrombus)
were collected from each patient.
Assessments also included the condition of
the general venous system (varicose veins or
venous pain) and sites of catheterized vein
and catheterized limb. DVT was diagnosed
by colour Doppler ultrasonography (sensi-
tivity 97­100% and specificity 98­99% for
detecting proximal thrombus18,19).
Statistical analyses
Data were presented as n (%). Univariate 2
analysis was performed, with thrombosis as
the dependent variable and various risk
factors as independent variables. Logistic
regression analysis was performed on statis-
tically significant variables to identify the
major risk factors for thrombosis. All stat-
istical analyses were performed using SPSSÕ
version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)
for WindowsÕ, with P-value <0.05 con-
sidered as being statistically significant.
Results
The study included 188 consecutive patients
(40 male/148 female; mean age 51.4 Æ 18.3
years; range 29­73 years). Thrombosis
occurred in 12/188 patients (incidence
6.38%), and was located in the subclavian,
jugular, axillary, or upper limb vein of the
catheterized side in 10/12 patients, and the
femoral vein in two of 12 patients.
864 Journal of International Medical Research 42(3)
Thrombosis occurred within 2 weeks of
PICC in seven of 12 patients (58.33%), and
within 1 month of PICC in two of 12
patients (16.67%). In total, nine of 12 throm-
boses (75.0%) occurred before the end of the
second course of chemotherapy.
Demographic and clinical characteristics
of the patient population, stratified accord-
ing to the presence or absence of venous
thrombosis, are given in Table 1. There were
statistically significant associations between
venous thrombosis and age >60 years,
male sex, BMI >25 kg/m2, breast cancer,
Hb <100 g/l or use of red blood-cell growth
factor, WBC >11.4 Â 109/l, history of hyper-
tension, history of smoking and left upper
limb catheterization (P < 0.05 for each com-
parison, Table 1). Limb swelling was also
significantly associated with venous throm-
bosis (P < 0.001), but this was considered a
symptom rather than a risk factor.
Logistic regression analysis (Table 2)
indicated that age >60 years, BMI > 25 kg/
m2 and WBC >11.4 Â 109/l were major risk
factors for thrombosis in patients undergo-
ing PICC chemotherapy. The incidence of
thrombosis in patients with one or more of
these risk factors was 16.7% (12/72); in
patients with two or more risk factors the
incidence was 55.6% (five of nine patients).
Discussion
The incidence of venous thrombosis was
6.38% in the present study of PICC,
approximately three times that reported in
a study of central venous catheters.9 In
accordance with the findings of others,14
there was a significant correlation between
thrombosis and age >60 years in the present
study. It is thought that vascular endothelial
cells produce increasingly high levels of
procoagulants (such as von Willebrand
factor and plasminogen activator inhibitor-
1) with advancing age,20 resulting in hyper-
coagulation. Changes in gonadotropins also
predispose elderly people to thrombosis.20
Age >60 years is a risk factor in the
Davidson­Caprini Model11,12 and other
risk assessment scales.15
We identified a significant correlation
between thrombosis and BMI > 25 kg/m2.
BMI values in thrombosis risk assessment
scales vary between 25 and 35 kg/m2 or
higher,21,9 but the highest BMI value in the
present study was 27 kg/m2. BMI varies
greatly according to ethnic group.10
Obesity is a known risk factor for VTE11,12;
adipocytokines such as leptin and adiponec-
tin can enhance the activity of the coagula-
tion system and decrease fibrinolytic activity
by interfering with blood fat and sugar
tolerance-related metabolism.22­24
In accordance with the findings of
others,9 high WBC count (>11.4 Â 109/l)
was identified as a significant risk factor
for thrombosis in the present study. WBC-
derived tissue factor (TF) has a role in
pathological thrombosis,9,25 and large num-
bers of TF-containing microparticles can be
detected in the blood of patients with severe
infection, metastatic cancer or DVT.26,27
Female patients are known to have an
increased risk of thrombosis,28 and both
chemotherapy and estrin treatment can
increase the risk of thrombosis in patients
with breast cancer.29 TF is involved in
haemostasis and thrombosis,30,31 and TF
activity is related to hyperlipidaemia, smok-
ing and platelet count.32 It has been sug-
gested that hypertension can cause extensive
damage to vascular endothelial cells, leading
to excessive TF release that starts the cas-
cade reaction of extrinsic coagulation.33
Logistic regression analysis in the present
study revealed no significant associations
between thrombosis risk and sex, breast
cancer, history of smoking, platelet count
or hypertension. Both a personal and a
family history of thrombosis are risk-assess-
ment items in some scales,13,15 but there was
no significant relationship between throm-
bosis risk and these parameters in the cur-
rent study.

A study found that patients with three or
more thrombosis risk factors accounted for
>50% of 142 patients with DVT, whereas
those with two or more risk factors
accounted for >75%.34 In addition,
Anderson and Spencer35 reported that
patients with two or more risk factors
accounted for 76% of 1231 patients with
VTE, whereas patients with three or more
risk factors accounted for 39%. These data
indicate that thrombosis is often a conse-
quence of multiple risk factors, but the
actual number of risk factors is not a specific
predictor of thrombosis.
Common acquired thrombotic risk fac-
tors include trauma, surgery, malignant
tumours and the presence of antiphospholi-
pid antibodies.36 These factors are closely
associated with venous thrombosis in hyper-
tension, coronary heart disease, heart fail-
ure, diabetes mellitus, cerebral infarction
and smoking.37,38 Major genetic risk factors
include mutations in coagulation factor V
Leiden39,40 and prothrombin 20210A,41 and
defects in protein C and protein S.42
Thrombosis is thus a combined consequence
of acquired and hereditary thrombotic risk
factors.
The present study included only Chinese
patients undergoing PICC chemotherapy;
it is not possible to determine whether
the findings are applicable to the wider
population. Although we identified three
risk factors for thrombosis in patients
undergoing PICC chemotherapy, we believe
that comprehensive assessment of throm-
bosis risk is necessary.
In conclusion, this study identified age
>60 years, BMI >25 kg/m2 and WBC
>11.4 Â 109/l as risk factors for thrombosis
in Chinese patients undergoing PICC
chemotherapy. These patients are already
at high risk of VTE due to the presence of
three major risk factors (tumour, chemo-
therapy and PICC). Careful attention
should therefore be paid to patients with
one or more risk factors, including thorough
checking for signs and symptoms of DVT
and early symptoms of pulmonary embol-
ism. B-mode ultrasonography and pulmon-
ary angiography should be promptly
performed and low-dose or low-molecular-
weight heparin should be given to prevent
DVT when indicated.43
