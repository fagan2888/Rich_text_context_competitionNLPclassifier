Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in the evolution of the human
capacity for language. Such a project is necessarily interdisciplinary. However, that
interdisciplinarity brings with it a risk: terms with a technical meaning in their own field
are used wrongly or too loosely by those from other backgrounds. Unfortunately, this risk
has been realized in the case of language evolution, where many of the terms of social
evolution theory (reciprocal altruism, honest signaling, etc.) are incorrectly used in a way
that suggests that certain key fundamentals have been misunderstood. In particular the
distinction between proximate and ultimate explanations is often lost, with the result that
several claims made by those interested in language evolution are epistemically incoherent.
However, the correct application of social evolution theory provides simple, clear
explanations of why language most likely evolved and how the signals used in language ­
words ­ remain cheap yet arbitrary.

Introduction
In recent years much has been written about the evolution of the human capacity for
language, with significant progress on a number of issues, for example how evolution can
help explain language universals (e.g., Kirby and Hurford, 2002), how individuals negotiate
upon the meaning of signals (e.g., Galantucci, 2005), and how and why the human vocal
tract most likely evolved (e.g., Fitch, 2000). However, the social evolution of human
communicative behavior has remained at the stage of speculation, with several hypotheses
(e.g., Dessalles, 1998; Dessalles, 2000; Dunbar, 1997; Fitch, 2004; Hurford, 2007; Knight,
1998; Miller, 2000; Pinker, 2003; Ulbaek, 1998) but little data advanced. Worse, much of
The social evolution of language

this speculation misuses or misunderstands the key concepts and terms of social evolution
theory, and as a result a number of the positions taken are incoherent. The purpose of this
paper is twofold. First, to highlight a number of specific examples of such
misunderstandings; and second, to show that when social evolution theory is correctly
applied it produces simple, parsimonious explanations. As I hope to show with a range of
examples, there is a real need for such an analysis, for confusion within evolutionary
linguistics on matters of social evolution theory is remarkably commonplace.
In order to prepare the ground for the arguments to come, the next section makes
explicit a crucial distinction, between ultimate and proximate explanations (see Mayr,
1961; Tinbergen, 1963). I then turn to the question of why we should talk at all, and show
that a number of proposed answers to this question come from a misunderstanding of this
fundamental distinction between the ultimate and the proximate. Once this is made clear
then the question of why we should talk is answered straight-forwardly and very generally:
to influence the (future) behavior of others. I also address the other big question for any
social evolutionary analysis of communication; that of honesty. Why are human utterances
cheap yet reliable? What keeps the system stable? Contrary to a popular belief within
evolutionary linguistics (and in intellectual circles more generally) the handicap principle is
not the only candidate answer here. In fact, there are several others, and one in particular ­
that it is dishonest rather than honest signals that carry costs ­ seems very plausible in the
case of natural language. I outline the case for this explanation in the fourth section.
Ultimate and proximate explanations
The difference between ultimate and proximate explanations is a rich source of
possible confusion, and so should be clearly delineated at the outset. The difference is
typically explained as the difference between the how and the why: ultimate processes
explain why certain social behaviors exist, and proximate mechanisms explain how that
logic is enforced. This explanation risks confusion, however, since for some scholars
mechanistic descriptions of behavior are precisely what is sought (this is often the case in
Psychology) and are therefore given the status of why. The difference is may instead be
captured as the difference between process and product.
Ultimate explanations describe the processes by which the present set of behaviors
observed in a population arose and are maintained. It is here that terms like kin selection,
reciprocity and the like ­ the technical terminology of social evolution theory ­ find
meaningful use: as processes that explain the continued presence of behaviors (like
altruism) which would be otherwise unexpected under the laws of natural selection. Indeed,
such ultimate, process-driven explanations of social behavior are, essentially, the raison
d'etre of social evolution theory. In contrast, proximate explanations describe how the logic
of such processes is manifested in particular cases. So if we accept that some behavior of a
particular species is the result of, say, kin selection (an ultimate process), then to complete
the story we should also ask how the members of that species recognize kin and how they
discriminate their behavior accordingly (a proximate product of the ultimate process).
In fact, ultimate and proximate explanations can be further divided: the former
includes both function and phylogeny; the latter mechanism and ontogeny (Tinbergen,
1952). This four-way distinction, commonly known as the "four whys", is the
methodological foundation of contemporary ethology. The particular distinction that this
article draws attention to is that between function and mechanism. The other two whys are
The social evolution of language
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 5(4). 2007. -742-
concerned with developmental issues (of the species and of the organism) and are hence not
central to the points made here.
All of these explanations are desirable. Indeed, they complement each other.
Moreover, because the ultimate and the proximate are different types of explanation, they
cannot coherently be conflated. Ultimate explanations are not ­ not at all ­ hypotheses
about how the logic they describe is manifested. For example, we may state that peacocks
have large tails because of the handicap principle (Grafen, 1990; Zahavi, 1975; Zahavi and
Zahavi, 1997), whereby an organism pays cost as a guarantee of its honesty: only those
peacocks who are of sufficiently high quality can afford the largest, most cumbersome tails.
Yet this hypothesis makes no necessary statement whatsoever about peacock cognition,
except that such cognition must produce behaviors that approximate the underlying logic of
the process. In particular, a full representation of the process and notion of a handicap
(whatever that might mean in the case of peacocks) is unnecessary. The intentional
language (e.g., "The peacock wants the peahen to understand that he is of high-quality")
that is sometimes used to describe such behavior is, then, only as simple but justified
shorthand for the processes described by social evolution theory (Dennett, 1995; Grafen,
1999; Hamilton, 1964). Despite everyday meanings, this language is neutral on whether
and how the peacock can entertain desire (c.f. "...wants...") or comprehension (c.f.
"...understand..."). Rather, the terms are used exclusively as an anthropomorphized
shorthand to conveniently describe animal behavior. Of course, the logic of the handicap
principle must be manifested somehow, and a large part of that story presumably involves
the peacock brain, but ultimate explanations (like the handicap principle) can only be
neutral on this, because ultimate explanations are about process rather than product. The
two types of explanation are fundamentally different, and should not be confused or
conflated.
However, such confusion does often arise. To illustrate, consider recent work on the
evolution of cooperation in humans, and specifically the idea of strong reciprocity (Fehr
and Fischbacher, 2003; Fehr, Fischbacher, and Gächter, 2002; Gintis, 2000). Strong
reciprocity is defined as a combination of "a predisposition to reward others for
cooperative, norm-abiding behaviors... [and] a propensity to impose sanctions on others for
norm violations" (Fehr and Fischbacher, 2003, p.785). This is a proximate definition, and
as such cannot be a solution to the ultimate problem of why such behavior should persist in
the face of natural selection (West, Griffin, and Gardner, 2007). Another definition makes
it clear that strong reciprocity is a product and not a process: "a strong reciprocator is
predisposed to cooperate with others and punish non-cooperators, even when this behavior
cannot be justified in terms of extended kinship or reciprocal altruism" (Gintis, 2000, p.
169, italics added). Strong reciprocity is therefore, by its own definition, a hypothesis about
how cooperation might be manifested in humans. It is not, however, a hypothesis about why
cooperation exists at the ultimate level, for it does not describe any process that will
maintain the system's stability. This point is well-appreciated within social evolution
circles, but the same is not true of evolutionary linguistics, where strong reciprocity is
sometimes invoked to explain the large-scale cooperation that is plainly necessary for
language to flourish. Consider the following claim, made by a senior member of the
evolutionary linguistics community: "strong reciprocity shows how a weakness in
reciprocal altruism can be overcome" (Hurford, 2007, p. 477). Yet any "weakness" in
reciprocal altruism must be overcome by some other evolutionary process, not by the
The social evolution of language
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 5(4). 2007. -743-
product of that process. It is not enough to say that strong reciprocity will do the work
where reciprocity alone is insufficient, because such an explanation says nothing about why
such a set-up would be stable ­ which is precisely the problem that reciprocity is sought to
explain. The conflation of these two complimentary but different explanations is
epistemically incoherent.
This is not the only example, by any means. The next section surveys some of the
various hypotheses that have been proposed in response to the question of why humans
should talk to each other at all, and shows that conflation of proximate and ultimate
explanations is remarkably commonplace. However, when we keep the distinction clear
then a simple and very general answer presents itself: we talk to influence the future
behavior of others.
Why talk?
When we talk we pass information onto our conspecifics, some of which will be of
value and use to them. Yet talking carries production costs; if nothing else there is the
opportunity cost of the time spent in conversation (Maynard Smith and Harper, 1995).
Why, then, do we talk? Of course, communication most obviously allows us to coordinate
our behaviors with far more ease than otherwise, but our communicative instincts go far
beyond this. We have a "robust and passionate urge of some kind to communicate" (Bates,
1994, p. 139) with the result that a surprisingly large proportion of the time we spend in
conversation is spent on those relatively mundane and trivial matters that we call gossip
(Dunbar, Duncan, and Marriott, 1997). Why, then, are we such enthusiastic users of this
skill? This question may sound naive at first blush, but no evolutionary answer is
immediately forthcoming. Indeed, any real naivety here lies in "linguistic communism"
(Bourdieu, 1991, p. 43): the assumption that humans will simply talk to each other for no
reason other than the altruistic sharing of information. Correspondingly, several researchers
have correctly identified the matter of why we talk at all as a key question for evolutionary
linguistics (Dessalles, 1998; Hurford, 2007; Knight, 1998).
The well-known processes of kin selection and/or reciprocal altruism have both
been proposed as solutions, or partial-solutions, to this problem. (Reciprocal altruism is in
fact a misnamed theory, for it is not a type of altruism at all. On the contrary, what the
theory purports to explain is why superficially altruistic acts are in fact not altruistic. A
better term is reciprocity (West, Griffin, and Gardner, 2007), and I will use this hereafter).
On this line, large-scale communication is the result of a process whereby we share
information either with kin or with those whom we expect to return the favor. With regard
to natural language, the problem with the kin selection hypothesis is plain, and
acknowledged by the most complete argument presented in its favor: "the glaringly obvious
flaw in this hypothesis is that today, language is not used exclusively or even
predominantly to communicate among kin" (Fitch, 2004, p.292). Reciprocity is a more
popular explanation, endorsed by several researchers (e.g., Hurford, 2007; Knight, 1998;
Pinker, 2003; Ulbaek, 1998): "only under the extraordinary conditions of reciprocal
altruism can information-sharing take place without loss of fitness to the speaker" (Ulbaek,
1998, p. 41). In order to evaluate this claim, let us be clear exactly what it states: that our
willingness to talk is the result of, and is maintained by, a process whereby we exchange
conversation on a reciprocal basis. However, our conversational behavior does not support
this conclusion: if the donation of information were costly and the receipt of information
The social evolution of language
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 5(4). 2007. -744-
beneficial, as the reciprocity hypothesis supposes, then the cheating strategy ­ the defect
option in game-theoretic terms ­ would be to absorb the information offered by others and
not to speak at all (Dessalles, 1998, 2007). Yet such a strategy does not trigger anything
that looks like cheater detection: those that speak only occasionally are not excluded from
future conversations (on the contrary, those most likely to be excluded are those that talk a
great deal but do little in the way of listening, yet if speaking were altruistic then these
would be generous individuals indeed). The reciprocation argument depends upon the
exchange of acts in which one party ­ supposedly the speaker in this case ­ pays a cost in
order that the other party ­ the listener ­ receives a payoff. Yet if cheater detection is any
guide to the existence of such relationships then this does not occur in the case of
conversation.
Moreover, there are further reasons to suppose that speaking has benefits for the
speaker, even when unreciprocated. One is our anatomical divergence from other primates:
our vocal tract is significantly different to both our primate cousins and our ancestors,
mainly due to the descended larynx, while our ears are not. Although it has been argued
that the descended larynx is an adaptation for speech (e.g., Lieberman, 1984), the most
compelling explanation is that it evolved to exaggerate size, as it has in other species: a
descended larynx produces greater formant dispersion, which is negatively correlated with
size (Fitch, 1999, 2002). Vocalizations thus produce some payoff for the speaker, at least in
some contexts. As for ears, if information transfer were the function of language, then we
could reasonably expect our ears to have developed adaptations to better capture all the
input that they can, so that background chatter was no longer just noise but a set of many
distinct information sources (Miller, 2000). Yet this is not the case. Of course, these
thoughts are pure speculation, but the reasoning is certainly not fanciful. At the very least,
they are questions that must be addressed by those who suppose that talk is simply the
provision of useful information.
A computational model poses a similar question: if the payoff to communication
were simply that the listener gains information, then we should predict more true synonymy
and less homonymy (Hurford, 2003). The model works as follows. Agents send and receive
signals from one another and are evolved according to one of two possible selection
pressures: their fitness is defined either as their ability to signal their intended meaning
correctly, or as their ability to deduce intended meaning correctly. Under the first condition
the resulting language is free of true synonymy and rich in homonymy, just as we observe
in all natural languages. Under the second condition, however, the resulting language was
rich in synonymy and free of homonymy, a situation never observed among natural
languages. The emergent languages hence resemble real languages only when selection is
placed on the agent's productive capabilities, and not their receptive capabilities. This
suggests, like the anatomic observations above, that speaking is not the altruistic act of
information sharing that a naïve reading would suppose it to be. Instead, the speaker is
likely to have gained something from the interaction, just as the listener will have done. It
is therefore hard to conclude that the stability of speaking is dependent on reciprocation, a
process by which individual speech acts are costly but are maintained through a process of
exchange. On the contrary, they suggest that the speaker must receive some net payoff from
each speech act. In light of these arguments, and the lack of cheater detection discussed
above, reciprocation seems a highly unlikely explanation of our enthusiasm to converse
(Scott-Phillips, 2006).

One scholar similarly observes that "a human speech-community is not a personal
mutual aid network but is typically an extended group transcending the limits of affiliation
on the basis of residence, economic co-operation or kinship" (Knight, 1998, p. 75).
However, this observation is then followed by just the sort of error discussed earlier:
conflation of the proximate and the ultimate. Specifically, it is suggested that the problem
was overcome by a "profound coalitionary restructuring [of human sociality]". This is a
proximate explanation ­ the structure of human sociality is a product of natural selection,
not a process ­ and therefore it cannot answer the ultimate problem of why we should talk
to each other at all.
This is not an isolated example. Consider the suggestion that our syntactic abilities
are based upon the same cognitive mechanisms that must underpin reciprocal altruism
(Bickerton, 1998). The assumption here is that because reciprocity is about who did what to
whom and when, then there must be some cognitive representation of the corresponding
social calculus, and it is this representation that it is suggested was exapted for use in
syntax: "thematic analysis must have been selected-for long before the hominid-pongid
split" (Bickerton, 1998. p. 351, italics added). This is akin to saying that because ant
behavior can be explained in terms of kin selection then ants must have some of the
cognitive machinery required to do arithmetic (see also Dawkins, 1979). In fact, nothing of
the sort is entailed by these processes. (For the record, ants appear to recognize kin through
smell (Keller and Ross, 1998)). To repeat the previous section's leitmotif: social evolution
theories (kin selection, reciprocity, etc.) are utterly silent ­ can only be silent, by their very
nature ­ on how the logic they describe is actually enacted in any given example. Social
evolution theory may of course guide our intuitions in this regard, but no more than that.
Although it may indeed be the case some general social reasoning skills provided a pre-
adaptation for syntax (c.f. Seyfarth, Cheney, and Bergman, 2005) this is not a necessary
condition; it does not follow as a matter of course. Any such claim must do considerably
more than simply observe similarities in the structures of our theories of syntax and social
behavior.
If it is hard to envisage how reciprocity could occur without a representation of who
did what to whom and when, then ask the same question about, say, incest avoidance. Our
brains are not pre-wired to represent our family-tree. The evidence instead suggests that a
simple heuristic, namely "Do not have sex with anybody who grew up in the same
household as you", does the job to a high-enough degree of approximation (Shepher, 1971,
1983; Wolf, 1970, 1995). Similarly, if humans do engage in reciprocity, there is no reason
to suppose that it will not be based upon some similar heuristic (possibly, ironically
enough, one that makes use of linguistic markers like, say, accent (Nettle and Dunbar,
1997)). It is not the case that "of course, reciprocal altruism theory relies upon animals
having a capacity to remember, in detail, the past behavior of others" (Hurford, 2007, p.
425, italics added).
This conflation of the proximate and the ultimate, which, as observed in the
previous section, renders such claims technically incoherent, is not the only error that
evolutionary linguists have made with social evolution theory in general and reciprocity in
particular. Consider the following: "If we inform only those people who are likely to return
the favor, both of us can gain the benefits of trade..." (Pinker, 2003, p. 28). This is the
reciprocity hypothesis (c.f. "...benefits of trade..."). This is then followed by "...it seems
clear [though no data is offered ­ TSP] that we do use our faculties of social cognition to
The social evolution of language
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 5(4). 2007. -746-
ration our conversation to those with whom we have established a non-exploitative
relationship" (Pinker, 2003, p. 28). This is a more general statement, and not the same thing
as the reciprocity hypothesis, which specifically states, when it is used correctly, that we
exchange pieces of information with each other. One is tempted to conclude that at least
some of the popularity of the reciprocity idea is due to an imprecise, overly general use of
the term.
That is not to deny that the establishment of equitable relationships was an
important landmark in the phylogeny of the language faculty. It is just that such
relationships are unlikely to have arisen within the tight and specific constraints of
reciprocity. A more general explanation is more likely, and in the next section I will argue
for a major role for reputation. Before then, however, I wish to briefly comment on two of
the selfish suggestions as to why we talk without relying on reciprocation, both drawn from
the evolutionary psychology literature. Doing so will enable us to see more clearly that the
"incredibly boring" (Pinker and Bloom, 1990, p. 708) conclusion that language evolved
under a pressure to communicate complex propositions is most likely the correct one.
First is the thesis that gossip acts as a form of social glue in the same way that
grooming does in non-human primates (Dunbar, 1993, 1997). Although this certainly has a
degree of plausibility, two comments should be made. The first is that gossip/grooming is
by no means all that we use language for. We frequently talk to others even without any
desire to build or maintain social relationships. Indeed, we occasionally talk to people we
would like to break ties with. Second, and more pertinently, this hypothesis does not
explain why language need be as complex as it is: if social grooming was the sole function
of language then grunts could perform the same task, but instead we have a far more
cognitively complex and evolutionarily costly communicative mechanism (Pinker, 2003).
A second prominent idea is sexual selection. The suggestion that this process played
a prominent role in the evolution of language goes back as far as Darwin (1871) but it, too,
cannot tell the whole story, a fact acknowledged by its most prominent modern-day
advocate (Miller, 2000). After all, we use communication for far more than attracting
mates. That does not rule it out completely, of course. Neither do the following two
arguments, both of which have recently been argued to speak against the sexual selection
hypothesis (Fitch, 2004): first, that sexually selected traits are usually sexually dimorphic,
with the displaying sex (typically, but not necessarily, the male) expressing such traits
exclusively, or at least to a far greater degree, than the choosing sex (typically, but not
necessarily, the female); second, that sexually selected traits are not usually expressed until
puberty.
With regard to the first point, the degree to which we should expect to witness
sexual dimorphism is in large part determined by the mating system employed by the
species, and in particular the relative levels of parental investment in child rearing: the
more investment a parent has to make, the less likely they are to display sexually selected
traits (Andersson, 1994; Cartwright, 2000). In humans the norm includes a significant role
for paternal as well as maternal investment in the young. We should therefore expect both
sexes to display sexually selected traits. With regards to the second point, it may in fact be
argued that full linguistic competence does indeed not develop until puberty: language is, in
its widest sense, more than the ability to produce coherent grammatical utterances; it is also
the ability to use such utterances in socially appropriate ways, a skill that does not reach
adult levels of proficiency until the end of adolescence. Thus, this apparent criticism
The social evolution of language
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 5(4). 2007. -747-
becomes a strength of the sexual selection hypothesis; considered in its widest sense,
language does indeed develop fully only when sexual selection theory predicts that it will.
In conclusion, then, we may only be equivocal: sexual advertisement may, like
gossip, have a role to play. Yet still, these two possibilities (and any possible effects of kin
selection) do not at all exhaust the range of domains in which we speak. In short, we put
language to an indefinably large number of uses. This is true of many human traits: "hands
may be very good for throwing rocks, shooting arrows, and pressing triggers, but we not
infer that manipulability therefore arose as an adaptation for success in aggression" (Gould,
1991, p.53). Indeed; instead we simply conclude that such manipulability is an adaptive end
in its own right; a versatile tool with a wide range of applications. Similarly, we use a range
of linguistic devices ­ imperatives, declaratives, requests and the like ­ to fulfill a diverse
range of sociobiological functions, amongst them sexual advertisement and grooming.
What these functions have in common is that all involve the alteration of another's
behavior. Rather than claim that any single one is the function of language, we should
instead draw the general and banal conclusion that language evolved for the purposes of
communication (c.f. Pinker and Bloom, 1990); after all, the functional alteration of another
organism's behavior is precisely what it means to communicate (Maynard Smith and
Harper, 2003). In sum, language's great expressivity reflects its diverse selection pressures.
Does such a conclusion actually answer our initial question? We talk to influence
the behavior of others, but if that is the whole story then why should others pay attention to
our utterances? Indeed, what stops us from simply making claims without any substance,
simply so that others will believe them and act accordingly? In the conventional terms of
social evolution theory, how is honesty maintained in such a system? That question is the
focus of the next section.
Honesty
The theories discussed in the previous section ­ kin selection, reciprocal altruism,
etc. ­ are those used by social evolutionists to discuss animal social behavior in its many
forms, including communication. But communication also brings its own, unique problem,
and with it its own set of theories. That problem ­ honesty, or reliability ­ is arguably the
central problem for any evolved signaling system: if there is no mechanism by which
individual signals are kept honest then free-riders can invade. If one can gain through the
use of a dishonest signal without paying additional costs then we should expect natural
selection to favor such behavior. Consequently, signals will cease to be of value, since
receivers have no guarantee of veracity. Ultimately, dishonesty will produce listeners who
will not attend to signals and the system will collapse in an evolutionary retelling of
Aesop's fable of the boy who cried wolf.
Before we consider this matter for the case of human communication, a brief
terminological aside is merited. In its everyday use, honesty makes reference to the
relationship between a proposition and its truth value. This is roughly the meaning used in
social evolution theory, with the obvious but important caveat that here is its use is
necessarily metaphorical; it does not suppose that an animal must have "meanings" that are
either true or false. Rather, terms like honesty are, like the intentional verbs used to
describe animal social behavior more generally, a convenient shorthand that makes use of
an anthropomorphic gloss of the animal's behavior. We assign an "intended" "meaning" to
the behavior and this allows us to subject it to evolutionary analysis, but this does not at all
The social evolution of language
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 5(4). 2007. -748-
suppose that the animal necessarily has "intentions" or "meanings" in any psychologically
real sense. In many ways, this is the same point as the ultimate/proximate distinction
already discussed above; honesty is used within social evolution theory in an ultimate and
not proximate sense.
We may now ask what keeps human communication stable. That is, what prevents
dishonesty becoming so widespread that trust in others' utterances simply breaks down?
This question is surprisingly little addressed by language evolution researchers, mainly
because those who have thought about language in the context of social evolution theory
have, as discussed in the previous section, mainly argued that linguistic use can be
explained through reciprocity or kin selection, processes that address the problem of
honesty before it is asked. But if we accept that these are unlikely explanations of our
willingness to talk then we must look elsewhere for a Darwinian explanation of honesty.
Outside of social evolution theory it is sometimes thought that the handicap principle
(Grafen, 1990; Zahavi, 1975; Zahavi and Zahavi, 1997) is the only process by which cheap
signals may remain honest, but this is not the case: cost-free honesty does exist in nature,
and not just in humans. Many male passerines, for example sparrows, typically display
dominance badges on their plumage; the larger the badge, the greater the bird's RHP
(Resource Holding Potential; an indexical measure of all factors that influence fighting
ability (Parker, 1974)). However, there appears to be no cost associated with the badge, and
no obvious barrier to falsification (Rohwer, 1975; Whitfield, 1987).
What, then, are the alternative processes that may explain such a phenomenon?
Several have been identified by social evolution theorists (Maynard Smith and Harper,
2003):
· Indices ­ signals that cannot be faked, because the form of the signal is causally
related to the signal's meaning.
· Coordination games ­ where each party has a different preference for the outcome
of the interaction, but where an overriding common interest is shared (Maynard
Smith, 1994).
· Repeated interactions, or reputation ­ where individuals meet each other repeatedly
over time, it may be in both parties' longer term interests to be honest rather than
take whatever short-term payoff may be available through dishonesty (Silk, Kaldor,
and Boyd, 2000). Depending upon the specifics of the relationship, the most
optimal strategy may be generally honest with occasional deception (Axelrod, 1995;
Axelrod and Hamilton, 1981).
· Punishment of false signals ­ if dishonesty is punished then this obviously reduces
or nullifies any possible benefit (Clutton-Brock and Parker, 1995).
Of these, it is clear that indices cannot offer a solution to our question, since
linguistic form is unrelated to meaning. The handicap principle seems similarly unlikely:
utterances are metabolically cheap. What of the other three suggestions? A first
observation is that they are not strictly independent of one another. A loss of reputation, for
example, whilst ostensibly coming under the banner of repeated interactions, could also be
seen as a punishment. In fact, something very similar has been proposed as a solution to the
problem at hand.
The crucial idea behind this proposal is that costs are paid not by honest individuals
as a guarantee of their honesty (à la the handicap principle) but by dishonest individuals as
a punishment for their dishonesty (Lachmann, Számadó, and Bergstrom, 2001). In this
The social evolution of language
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 5(4). 2007. -749-
scenario, it is cheap and easy to deceive, but there are costs to be paid for doing so. In
game-theoretic terms, the costs are paid away from the equilibrium; they are paid by those
who deviate from the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). This contrasts with costly
signaling, in which the costs are paid at equilibrium; costs are paid as part of the ESS, and
the system works because those costs are correlated with that honesty. Consider the
paradigmatic example of costly signaling, the peacock's tail. Here, costs are paid by each
peacock; the greater the costs, the greater the guarantee, and honesty is guaranteed by those
very costs.
This is different to the dominance badges of sparrows because sparrows will pay
costs away from the equilibrium; in other words, if they deviate from honesty. The
sparrow's signal is one about RHP, and this is easily verified by other sparrows; they may
simply approach more closely or, at worst, initiate a fight. In this way, sparrows are
deterred from dishonest signaling; such behavior will result either in fights they are
unlikely to win (if they signal a higher RHP than is true), or in less sexual opportunities (if
they signal a lower RHP than is true). In the peacock example, however, the signal is one
about genetic quality, and the peahen cannot confirm this until they have sired and raised
the peacock's offspring. By this time, any sanctions the peahen may impose will be trivial
in comparison to the fitness payoff received by the peacock. Hence, the peacock must pay
some cost as a guarantee.
In other words, if signals can be verified with relative ease, and if there are costs
attached to being revealed as a liar, then cost-free signaling can be evolutionarily stable. In
situations where these conditions do not hold, we should expect signals to be costly.
Specifically, this will apply in interactions where the protagonists are unlikely to meet again
or when communicating about otherwise unverifiable information (Lachmann, Számadó, and
Bergstrom, 2001). Of course, dishonesty may still be the more appropriate strategy if the
expected payoff is sufficiently large that it outweighs the expected costs. In other words,
deception may still pay under certain circumstances, specifically when the benefits associated
with doing so outweigh the social costs that will follow.
Hence, honesty can be ensured if dishonesty is costly. One important implication of
this analysis is that it allows for signals to take an arbitrary form (ibid.). It has previously
been assumed by some language evolution researchers that signals cannot be arbitrary
because they are open to invasion from cheats: "resistance to deception has always selected
against conventional [arbitrary ­ TSP] signals ­ with the one puzzling exception of humans"
(Knight, 1998, p. 72, italics added). However, if the costs associated with a signal are
removed from the signal form ­ that is, when the costs are paid by the dishonest individual ­
then the requirement that signal form is causally related to meaning is removed with it.
Consider again the sparrow's badge of status; not only is it honest but it is also arbitrary.
Given the already discussed implausibility of other mechanisms that have been proposed to
explain the emergence of arbitrary symbolism, it is tempting to suggest that the imposition of
some form of cost for dishonest signaling is a necessary (but obviously not sufficient)
condition for such a process to take place.
I know of no attempts to test this idea with human subjects. In fact, evolutionary
linguistics has thus far shown little interest in Lachmann, Számadó and Bergstrom's work,
despite its evident power and plausibility. This is not due to a lack of exposure. The work
was published in a major journal (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences), and is
cited extensively elsewhere (41 times as of June 2007). However, it is not cited at all in the
The social evolution of language

collections of work that have arisen from the biannual conferences on the evolution of
language that have taken place since the article's publication (Cangelosi, Smith, and Smith,
2006; Tallerman, 2005; Wray, 2002), nor in an edited book whose explicit goal was to
"bring together... all the major perspectives on language evolution...", with each chapter
written by "key authorities..." so that "..together they cast the brightest light yet on
questions surrounding the origin and evolution of language" (Christiansen and Kirby, 2003,
p. 2). Despite these goals the problem of what maintains honesty is barely addressed and
where it is the most plausible and likely solution is not discussed. One inevitably wonders
if this neglect is simply because the explanatory power of the suggestion, and of social
evolution theory more generally, is yet to be realized by many language evolution
researchers.
Conclusions
I have sought to make three crucial points. First, I have made clear the distinction
between ultimate and proximate explanations of behavior: the first is concerned with the
process of evolution, the second with its product. These are different types of explanation
that, when used correctly, will support and reinforce each other. However, the two are often
conflated within the language evolution literature, a practice which leads to epistemically
incoherent claims.
Second, even when understood correctly, social evolution theory is often over-
applied in evolutionary linguistics. A specific example is reciprocity, which in many cases
appears to be used in a fuzzy way to refer to general social cognition. However, a brief
analysis of linguistic behavior shows that its specific claims ­ that speaking is costly when
unreciprocated ­ are highly unlikely to be true.
This conclusion opens up the question of honesty. Contrary to a common belief
outside social evolution, the handicap principle is not the only explanatory candidate here.
My third central point is therefore that one specific alternative ­ that individuals pay costs
for dishonesty ­ seems very plausible in the case of humans. Bafflingly, this suggestion has
not yet been taken up by the evolutionary linguistics community, despite significant
exposure elsewhere. The need to find an evolutionary explanation for honesty is doubly
important in the case of humans, since multilevel selection means that our individual fitness
will be affected not only by our own honesty but by the overall level of honesty in our
social group. The individuals of any group polluted by a high degree of dishonesty ­ or any
other socially divisive behavior ­ will lose faith in the notional social contract. This break-
up of socially-mediated cooperation will most likely lead to selection against the group in
question, in addition to the fitness costs paid by the individual members.
It is hard to escape the conclusion that social evolution theory has been too often
misused by language evolution researchers. This is regrettable, for when applied correctly it
is a powerful explanatory tool. It is hoped that this article has shown how that power might
be correctly applied to language.
