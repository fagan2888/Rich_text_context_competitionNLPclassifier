Abstract
Background: This study assessed the ease of use of tobramycin inhalation powder (TIP)
administered via T-326 inhaler versus tobramycin inhalation solution (TIS) and colistimethate
sodium (COLI), both administered via nebulizers, for the treatment of chronic pulmonary
Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).
Methods: A real-world, open-label, crossover, interventional phase IV study was conducted in
CF patients aged 6 years with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1
) 25% to 90%
predicted. Patients were assigned to one of the three treatment arms in Cycle 1; all patients
received TIP in Cycle 2. Each cycle consisted of 28 days on and 28 days off the treatment.
Results: A total of 60 patients [mean (standard deviation) age, 27.6 (8.4) years] were allocated
to three treatment arms [TIS/TIP (n = 14); COLI/TIP (n = 28); TIP/TIP (n = 18)] in Cycle 1. The
mean total administration time, which included device setup and cleaning, in Cycle 1 versus
Cycle 2 for TIS/TIP, COLI/TIP, and TIP/TIP arms were 37.0 versus 5.0 min, 16.4 versus 3.8
min, and 4.2 versus 3.4 min, respectively. The difference in mean total administration time
was significantly shorter in Cycle 2 than in Cycle 1 for TIS/TIP (p = 0.0112) and COLI/TIP (p =
0.0016) arms. Overall, 12 patients were found to have contaminated devices across the two
treatment cycles. In the TIP/TIP arm, no contamination of the T-326 inhaler was observed in
either cycle. Treatment satisfaction, assessed by the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire
for Medication and ACCEPT® questionnaire, was better overall for TIP compared with TIS and
COLI. There were no unexpected adverse events and most were mild or moderate in intensity.
Conclusion: The T-326 inhaler used to deliver TIP was easy to use, required shorter total
administration time, and was much less frequently contaminated than the nebulizers. The
safety findings observed for TIP were generally consistent with its established safety profile.

(COLI) is also indicated for treating chronic pul-
monary infection due to Pa in adult and pediatric
CF patients.5 The administration of nebulized
TIS and COLI for the treatment of Pa infection is
complex, time consuming, and places a high bur-
den on CF patients and their caregivers, posing a
significant challenge to treatment adherence.4,6,7
In addition, nebulizers require regular mainte-
nance, consisting of cleaning, disinfection, and
drying for each use to minimize microbial con-
tamination.8,9 Moreover, pathogens are com-
monly isolated from nebulizers and there is a
concern that the nebulizer equipment may con-
tribute to bacterial infection in the lower airways
of CF patients.2,9 Tobramycin inhalation powder
(TIP) has been developed for the suppressive
management of pulmonary infection due to Pa in
CF patients aged 6 years.10 TIP, delivered via
the T-326 inhaler, was reported to have a safety
and efficacy profile similar to that of TIS but with
a substantially simplified method of administra-
tion, which has translated into increased patient
convenience and adherence.6,11­13 This study was
designed to compare the ease of use of TIP admin-
istered via the T-326 inhaler (Novartis Pharma
AG, Basel, Switzerland) with TIS and COLI,
both administered via nebulizers. Furthermore,
the prevalence of microbial contamination of the
devices used was also compared in this study.
Methods
This open-label, crossover, interventional, phase
IV, 20-week trial was conducted at 22 centers in
the United Kingdom (8), Spain (5), Germany
(4), Switzerland (3), and Ireland (2). The study
protocol was reviewed by an independent ethics
committee/institutional review board for each
center and was conducted according to the ethi-
cal principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Written informed consent was obtained from
each patient or their representative (parent or
legal guardian). CF patients aged 6 years with
forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1
)
25% to 90% predicted were recruited if they
had documented use of either COLI, TIS, or TIP
for at least one cycle, and two positive cultures for
Pa (either sputum, deep cough throat swab, or
bronchoalveolar lavage), within the last 6 months.
Patients with a current or past history of
Burkholderia cepacia complex infection within
2 years prior to screening, hemoptysis >60 ml
within 30 days of Visit 2, serum creatinine level
2 mg/dl, or a history of hearing loss or chronic
tinnitus deemed clinically significant by the inves-
tigator, were excluded from the study.
Study design
The study consisted of 6 visits (Figure 1(a)) over
20 weeks. Patients were assigned to one of the
three treatment arms: COLI/TIP, TIS/TIP, or
TIP/TIP.
In Cycle 1, patients in the COLI/TIP arm received
nebulized COLI, 1 or 2 million units two or three
times per day depending on local treatment
guidelines for 56 days (no off-treatment period),
administered using the patient's usual nebulizer,
and patients in the TIS/TIP arm received nebu-
lized TIS, 300 mg twice daily for 28 days admin-
istered using the patient's usual nebulizer,
followed by 28 days off treatment. In Cycle 2 of
these two arms, and in both Cycles 1 and 2 of the
TIP/TIP arm, patients were treated with TIP,
112 mg (4 × 28 mg capsules) twice daily for 28
days followed by 28 days off treatment.
The three inhaled antibiotics were compared with
each other with respect to ease of use in Cycle 1
in a real-world setting. Cycle 2 allowed the direct
assessment of the `switch experience' from nebu-
lized antibiotics to TIP. The study was open-label
as blinding the delivery device for TIP was not
feasible, because a double-dummy design would
have imposed a great burden on the patients for
the feasibility of the study and conflict with meas-
urement of the primary endpoint (ease of use).
Efficacy and patient-reported outcomes
Ease of use was measured by the mean cumula-
tive time required to administer study treat-
ments, including device setup/preparation, drug
administration, and device cleaning (including
disinfection, where applicable). The readiness of
use of the study treatment was assessed as the
sum of the time of start to the time of comple-
tion of delivery device preparation and the time
of start to the time of completion of study treat-
ment preparation. In addition, patient's satisfac-
tion and acceptance of the treatment were
assessed14 by using the Treatment Satisfaction
Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) and
Chronic Treatment ACCEPTance (ACCEPT®)
questionnaire.15,16 Patients aged 13 years com-
pleted the questionnaires by themselves in their
local language in a quiet setting, and patients
J Greenwood, C Schwarz et al.
journals.sagepub.com/home/tar 251
aged <13 years completed the questionnaires
with the assistance of their parents or guardians.
A patient preference survey was also conducted
to evaluate the patients' experience in switching
from COLI or TIS to TIP.
Microbial contamination of the delivery device
with Pa and other pathogens was analyzed in
terms of light, moderate or heavy growth. The
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of
tobramycin and other selected antibiotics for Pa
isolated from patients' specimens was assessed.
The other efficacy measures evaluated were
change in sputum Pa density (log10
colony-form-
ing units (CFU)/g sputum), changes in clinical
laboratory results and lung function [FEV1
,
forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expira-
tory flow between 25­75% of FVC (FEF25­75%
)].
The delivery devices used by CF patients were
assessed for microbial contamination and swabs
were collected from four locations on the nebulizer

(mouthpiece, reservoir cup, filter, and tubing) and
from the mouthpiece of the T-326 inhaler.
Microbial contamination of the nebulizers was
assessed at Visits 2 and 3 (the start and end of the
first treatment period), Visits 4 and 5 (start and
end of the second treatment period) and Visit 6
(end of study or discontinuation visit). Patients on
TIP brought to their study visits the T-326 device
used in the last week of TIP treatment. No assess-
ment was required for the device at Visits 2 and 4,
when the patients started the TIP treatment peri-
ods. If patients used nebulizers for inhaling any
other medications they brought these nebulizers
to their study Visits 2 and 6 for testing. Sputum
specimens were collected from patients at clinic
visits [1 (screening), 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6] for quantita-
tive (CFUs) or semiquantitative culture of Pa
(light, moderate, or heavy growth) and semiquan-
titative culture for non-Pa pathogens. These
assessments were performed by a central labora-
tory. Cultures were performed on a variety of
media designed to maximize growth of the patho-
gens most commonly isolated from the sputum of
patients with CF. Cultures were evaluated after
24, 48, and 72 h.
Safety assessments
Safety evaluations consisted of the incidence and
intensity of all adverse events (AEs), including
cough, and serious AEs (SAEs) during both on-
and off-treatment periods; physical condition;
hematology and blood chemistry; urinalysis;
audiology; and body weight.
Sample size and statistical analysis
A sample size of 15 patients per arm had 91%
power to detect a difference in mean total admin-
istration time of 14 min as observed between TIS
and TIP in the EAGER study,6 assuming a stand-
ard deviation (SD) of difference of 15 min or less
and using a paired Student's t-test with a 0.05
two-sided significance level. These calculations
were performed a priori.
All data summaries and analyses were performed
primarily within the study arms as the character-
istics of the patients may vary among these arms.
Summary statistics were provided for the mean
total administration time per cycle by treatment
arm and for within-patient differences in mean
total administration time between treatments
(Cycle 2-Cycle 1) by treatment arm. Safety
analyses were based on descriptive statistics for
AEs, cough rates, inhalation-associated cough,
SAEs, airway reactivity, laboratory test results,
audiology (where assessed), and vital signs that
were summarized for each treatment and treat-
ment cycle by arm.
Results
Study population
Of the 60 patients enrolled, the majority (51
patients; 85%) completed the study and nine
patients (15%) discontinued the study. The rea-
sons for discontinuation are listed in Figure 1(b).
Patient baseline demographic and characteristics
were comparable across the treatment arms. The
mean age (SD) of the patient population was 27.6
years (±8.40; Table 1). A total of four pediatric
patients were enrolled, two patients each in the
age groups of 6­12 and 13­17 years.
Efficacy results
Ease of use.Ease of use was considered a com-
posite indicator of the speed, simplicity, and con-
venience of the study treatments. The mean total
administration time including the time required
to set up the delivery device, administer the drug,
and clean the delivery device was significantly
shorter in Cycle 2 (TIP treatment) than in Cycle
1 for theTIS/TIP and COLI/TIP arms (Table 2).
However, the cumulative administration time
between the treatment cycles remained similar for
the TIP/TIP arm (Table 2). The mean adminis-
tration time (excluding the setup, cleaning, and
disinfection times) was significantly shorter in
Cycle 2 than in Cycle 1 for all three treatment
arms [difference in mean administration time,
Cycle 2-Cycle 1: TIS/TIP, -9.8 (p = 0.0005);
COLI/TIP, -5.3 (p = 0.0001); TIP/TIP, -0.3 (p
= 0.0464)].
Microbial contamination of devices.A total of 12
patients were found to have contaminated devices
across the treatment cycles; 11 patients had
contaminated nebulizers and one patient had a
contaminatedT-326 inhaler (Table 3): COLI/TIP
arm, 9 (32.1%); TIS/TIP arm, 2 (14.3%); and
TIP/TIP arm, 1 (5.6%). In the COLI/TIP arm,
the majority of pathogens were isolated (only
once) from the devices that delivered COLI at
Visits 2 and 3. Except for one patient with Staphy-
lococcus aureus infection in the COLI/TIP arm, no
J Greenwood, C Schwarz et al.
journals.sagepub.com/home/tar 253
patient had the same pathogen isolated from the
delivery device and sputum at Visits 2 and 3. In
theTIP/TIP arm, no contamination was observed
in the T-326 inhaler during either Cycle 1 or 2.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa sputum density and
MIC.The absolute change in the number of Pa
CFUs in the sputum was assessed after a period
of up to 28 days of treatment. AtVisit 3 (Cycle 1),
the mean log reduction in Pa for the sum of all
biotypes was 1.4 log10
CFU in the TIS/TIP arm,
0.6 log10
CFU in the COLI/TIP arm, and 1.7
log10
CFU in the TIP/TIP arm. At Visit 5 (Cycle
2), the mean log reduction was slightly lower for
the TIS/TIP arm and was similar for the other
two arms. In general, the result of each biotype
was comparable with the result observed for the
sum of all biotypes.
Tobramycin MIC50
and MIC90
values showed
that there was a 1-fold dilution increase in the
tobramycin MICs at Visit 5 compared with Visit
3 for the TIS/TIP arm (MIC50
: 4 g/ml versus
2 g/ml; MIC90
: 512 g/ml versus 256 g/ml) and
the COLI/TIP arm (MIC50
: 4 g/ml versus 2 g/
ml; MIC90
: 32 g/ml versus 16 g/ml). In the TIP/
TIP arm, the MIC50
and MIC90
tobramycin val-
ues were stable up to Visit 5 (2 g/ml and 64 g/
ml, respectively) and were further decreased to
1 g/ml and 32 g/ml, respectively, at the end of
Visit 6.
Lung function.The assessment of lung function
was an exploratory efficacy endpoint. At Visit 3,
the mean FEV1
% predicted showed a relative
increase from baseline in theTIS/TIP (2.2%) and
COLI/TIP (3.9%) arms and a slight decrease
from baseline in theTIP/TIP arm (-2.8%). How-
ever, at Visit 5, the FEV1
% predicted remained
stable across the treatment arms, as compared
with Visit 4. No notable difference was observed
(p >0.05) in absolute change from pre-dose

TSQM, ACCEPT® and patient preference question-
naire results.The median scores for the TSQM
questionnaire were high in Cycle 1 and were
either sustained or further improved in Cycle 2
for the majority of domains, indicating treatment
satisfaction in patients receiving TIP (Table 4).
Improvements were reported in Cycle 2 in the
COLI/TIP arm for the effectiveness, convenience,
and global satisfaction domains; improvements
were also reported for convenience in the TIS/
TIP arm, although the scores for effectiveness
and global satisfaction decreased in Cycle 2 from
Cycle 1. Similar scores were reported between
cycles for the TIP/TIP arm with the exception of
a slight decrease in global satisfaction in Cycle 2
for the TIP/TIP arm.
Regarding the ACCEPT® questionnaire, in Cycle
2 the median scores for most of the domains were
mostly improved or sustained from Cycle 1. At
Visit 2 in the TIS/TIP arm, the median scores were
improved from Cycle 1 for the domains of medica-
tion inconvenience (10 units improvement), long-
term treatment (8.3 units improvement) and
regime constraints (10 units improvement). The
exception was that median scores decreased in
Cycle 2 for the domains of effectiveness and gen-
eral. In the COLI/TIP arm, the median scores were
improved from Cycle 1 for the domains of medica-
tion inconvenience (20 units improvement), long-
term treatment (12.5 units improvement) and
regime constraints (10 units improvement). In the
TIP/TIP arm, the median scores for most of the
domains were high and comparable between the
treatment cycles. Improvements were observed in
Cycle 2 for the domains of medication inconven-
ience (5 units improvement), regime constraints
(2.5 unit improvement), effectiveness (16.7 units
improvement) and general (8.3 units improve-
ment) (Table 4). Using a separate patient

preference questionnaire, the majority of the
patients showed either `strong' or `somewhat' pref-
erence to use TIP in the TIS/TIP (9 of 12 patients,
75.0%) and COLI/TIP (18 of 23 patients, 78.3%)
arms. `Strong' or `somewhat' preference for TIS
and COLI in the TIS/TIP and COLI/TIP arms
were 16.7% (2 of 12 patients) and 8.7% (2 of 23
patients), respectively (Table 5).
Safety results
Treatment-emergent AEs (on and off treatment)
were reported by 36 patients in Cycle 1 [(n/N,
%); TIS/TIP: 6/14, 42.9%; COLI/TIP: 19/28,
67.9%; TIP/TIP: 11/18, 61.1%] and by 30
patients (57.7%) overall in Cycle 2 (Table 6).
The mean post-inhalation cough rates were com-
parable between the cycles for the COLI/TIP arm
(0.56 at Visit 2 and 0.47 at Visit 3 versus 0.65 at
Visit 4 and 0.51 at Visit 5). However, for the TIP/
TIP arm, the post-inhalation cough rate was
reduced over time, with a low cough rate in Cycle
2 than in Cycle 1 (0.40 at Visit 4 and 0.33 at Visit
5 versus 0.53 at Visit 2 and 0.56 at Visit 3,
respectively).

Treatment-related AEs were reported in four
patients (one each in the TIS/TIP and COLI/TIP
arms and two in the TIP/TIP arm) in Cycle 1;
none was considered severe. In Cycle 2, eight
patients (15.4%) reported AEs that were sus-
pected to be treatment related; three were severe
(each with decreased FEV1
and an upper respira-
tory tract infection, abnormal acoustic stimula-
tion tests and tinnitus, and cough). Overall, four
patients discontinued the study treatment due to
SAEs; however, none of these events were sus-
pected to be treatment related.
The frequency of airway reactivity (i.e. decrease
of 20% in post-dose FEV1
% predicted com-
pared with the pre-dose value) from pre-dose to
15­45 min post-dose was low: one patient each at
Visits 2 and 3 in the COLI/TIP arm and one
patient at Visit 4 in the TIP/TIP arm.
Discussion
Despite recent advances in therapy and improve-
ments in median survival age, the treatment bur-
den of CF patients has increased, which is
primarily associated with the number of nebu-
lized medications.17­19 The complexity of nebu-
lized therapy leads to reduced adherence.20,21
Moreover, lack of adherence with therapy has
been considered an important cause for the
increased hospitalization and pulmonary exacer-
bations in CF patients.17,22 The ease of use of

inhalers is an important factor in encouraging
patient adherence with therapy, minimizing the
handling errors and improving satisfaction.17,23
The present study showed that patients took sig-
nificantly lower cumulative time to administer
TIP than COLI or TIS. This resulted in approxi-
mately 13­33 min of time saving per administra-
tion with the T-326 inhaler used for TIP
compared with nebulizers used for TIS and
COLI. Ease of T-326 inhaler use for administra-
tion of TIP and reduction in administration time
have been associated with improved adherence
and clinical outcomes.6 In general, treatment sat-
isfaction, as assessed by TSQM and ACCEPT®
questionnaires showed better results for TIP,
with higher scores for `convenience' and greater
acceptance for TIP, although there were decreases
in scores reported in Cycle 2 compared with
Cycle 1 in some of the domains for both the
TSQM and ACCEPT® questionnaires. These
patient-reported outcome measures were sup-
ported by the shorter cumulative administration
time for TIP and a comparable efficacy profile as
reported in other studies.11 Furthermore, when
assessing the patient's preference of inhaled ther-
apy, the majority of patients showed either
`strong' or `somewhat' treatment preference for
TIP in the TIS/TIP and COLI/TIP arms over the
nebulizers, which emphasizes the ease of use of
TIP over other nebulized drugs.
Several published studies have described frequent
contamination of home nebulizers with microor-
ganisms and reported that Pa constitutes the
major contaminant.2,8 In the present study, the
majority of pathogens were isolated from the neb-
ulizer used to administer COLI in Cycle 1. The
microbial contamination assessment suggested
that the T-326 inhaler used for TIP was much
less frequently contaminated, thus potentially
reducing the sources of infection in CF patients
compared with the nebulizers used for TIS or
COLI. These results advocate the use of T-326
inhaler over nebulizers.
Consistent with previous studies,11,12 sputum Pa
densities decreased in all the treatment arms.
Although the mean FEV1
% predicted at the end
of the on-treatment period in Cycle 1 showed a
decrease in the TIP arm, and increases in the
COLI and TIS arms, the mean FEV1
% predicted
by the end of the on-treatment period in Cycle 2
remained stable across the three arms. Overall,
TIP showed comparable efficacy with TIS and
COLI, which is in accordance with previous
publications.6,17,24,25
In addition, this study demonstrated that AEs
were comparable in all three treatment arms and
no unexpected safety events were reported.
Although cough is a common AE with inhaled
therapies,25,26 a clear trend was observed in the
decreased frequency of post-inhalation cough
over time from Cycle 1 to Cycle 2 in the TIP/TIP
arm. Moreover, most cough events were of mild
or moderate intensity in all the arms. Overall, TIP
was well tolerated and the safety findings observed
for TIP in this study were generally consistent
with its established safety profile.6,12,26
These results provide clinicians with further guid-
ance on the relative differences between the speed
and ease of use of inhalers and nebulizers as well
as evidence on the prevalence of microbial con-
tamination of the inhalation devices in the real-
world setting. However, this was an open-label,
non-randomized study, which carries the risk of
reporting bias, particularly for the patient-
reported outcomes. In addition, data on the neb-
ulizer type were not collected, and therefore,
results are applicable to nebulizers in general but
not necessarily to any specific nebulizer.
Conclusions
In summary, the T-326 inhaler used to deliver
TIP showed significantly shorter administra-
tion and cleaning times compared with nebuliz-
ers used for COLI and TIS, suggesting that
TIP is easy to use in CF patients treated for
pulmonary Pa infection. Ease of use was also
supported by the outcomes of the TSQM and
ACCEPT® questionnaires. Furthermore, the
T-326 inhaler was much less frequently con-
taminated than the nebulizers, thus potentially
reducing the sources of pathogenic bacteria in
CF patients. In addition, this study provides
further evidence on the efficacy of TIP as shown
by the sustained suppression of Pa and stability
in FEV1
% predicted.
