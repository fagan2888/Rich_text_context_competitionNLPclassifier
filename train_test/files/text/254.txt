Dynamic Paradigms for Human Mortality and Aging
Kenneth G. Manton
Center for Demographic Studies, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina,
Hawrd models are often appliedto mortality data ofhumans and other species so that the parameter estimates madefor
those models can be usedto make inferences about the biology, and comparative biology, ofagingprocesses. Enough longi-
tudinaldata on physiologicalandfunctionalchanges in humans now exist to know thatthe age trajectory ofthe physiologi-
cal state ofindividuals is multidimensiona~ stochastic, andplastic. Thus,. tofully assess the biological significance ofexist-
ing longitudinaldata on human aging and mortalityprocesses, multivariote stochasticprocess models mustbe developed
that are biologically detailedand valid. This requires assessing genetic mechanisms controlling human longevity andrates
ofaging, developing models ofhow those traits may have evolved, anddeveloping statistical methodsfor identifyinggene
environment interactions. This article examines the theoreticalbasisfor such models and the biological rationale oftheir
parametric structure. Several examples are given.
IN the past, the event ofhuman mortality and the physiologi-
cal processes of aging have been viewed as fundamentally
linked-so intimately so that mortality and the age at which
death occurs have been viewed as highly reliable and easily
measured proxies for the operation of senescent processes in
human populations (e.g" reference 1, chapter 7). This linkage is
commonly termed "the age dependence of mortality" and has
often been modeled as a Gompertz function (2,3). As the aver-
age length of life, or life expectancy, increases in many devel-
oped countries, this linkage has weakened, and the biological
relevance of specific parameters of the linkage has become less
certain. This is not simply due to the increased chance of sur-
viving to late ages, but also due to our rapidly increasing scien-
tific knowledge of senescent processes, and the recognition of
their greater than anticipated complexity and "plasticity" (4-8),
Practical breaks in this linkage are also evident in the recog-
nition by scientists, clinicians, and policy makers of the impor-
tance of adopting as a primary goal for biomedical research,
clinical medicine, and public health, increases in the overall
quality, as well as the quantity, of life. This goal is now also
recognized by global health authorities, such as the World
Health Organization (WHO), which are placing increased im-
portance on active-life expectancy as a primary popUlation
health objective for developing and developed countries (9).
This view represents a recent and fundamental change in global
health policy perspectives. The earlier WHO Health for All pro-
gram targets for the year 2000 had, in contrast, emphasized life
expectancy, rather than active-life expectancy (10).
In recognition of these changes, it is no longer sufficient for
models of population aging to describe only the age and gender
distribution of mortality and temporal changes in that distribu-
tion. More complete models of aging that recognize our grow-
ing knowledge of aging processes, the heterogeneity of those
processes across individuals, and the plasticity of the parame-
ters of those processes are needed. These requirements mean
developing mathematical representations of aging processes in
human popUlations that are far more general than the mono-
tonic hazard functions usually employed to describe the age de-
pendence of mortality and that can use direct measurements of
longitudinal changes in individuals.
MODELS OF THE AGE DEPENDENCE OF MORTALITY: BACKGROUND
The most commonly used model of the age dependence of
mortality in adult humans was developed by Benjamin
Gompertz in 1825. The Gompertz hazard function has been
useful in describing the adult mortality ofhumans from ages 30
to 85 years (11), and mortality at "late" ages for many animal
species (2,3). The model's utility was due both to the frequency
with which it successfully described the empirical age depen-
dency of adult mortality (2) and, more formally, its convenient
statistical and mathematical properties as one of three "extreme
value" failure distributions, i.e., distributions of times to lethal
events which are mathematically consistent with the age-related
operation ofchronic biological failure (disease) processes in in-
dividuals (12).
However, as human life expectancy increases, the Gompertz
hazard function becomes less useful as a population model of
mortality and aging because it does not describe the age depen-
dence ofhuman mortality above age 85, nor the extreme upper
tail of the survival curve in many experimental insect and ani-
mal populations (13). In humans, the per annum rate ofincrease
of mortality with age for a given birth cohort slows significantly
above age 85 (14). From an extensive series (11 companies) of
insurance data, it appears that mortality rates reach a plateau, a
maximum constant level, past age 95 with no actuarially credi-
ble evidence of human mortality rates exceeding 50% per
annum at any higher adult age (15).
One reason why the Gompertz function may fail to describe
human mortality at late ages is genetic or environmentally in-
duced persistent, individual differences in age-specific risks of
death (16). These are strongly expressed when mortality rates
reach levels that rapidly exhaust high-risk subgroups (17). Even
if the Gompertz function described the biological dependence
of mortality on age for individuals, the age trajectory of the av-
erage mortality risk in a risk-heterogeneous population would
not be Gompertz in form if individuals are systematically se-
lected out of the population by mortality related to risk factors.
In a risk-heterogeneous population, the simplest empirically
satisfactory model retaining the Gompertz (or related functions
such as the Weibull) hazard function at the individual level has
two components. One is a distribution of individual risk differ-
B247
B248 MANTON
ences. The other describes the age rate of increase of mortality
for an individual (16). Though a hazard model with two fixed
components may be flexible enough to describe the age depen-
dence of mortality at late ages (85+), it requires the biologically
questionable assumption that all individual risk differences are
constant over age (18).
Both components of such compound hazard functions repre-
sent effects of unobserved factors. The hazard component rep-
resents factors whose effects on mortality are distributed over
age, but homogeneous over individuals. The distribution of in-
dividual risk differences, in contrast, is assumed to be age in-
variant. These assumptions are sufficient to mathematically
identify the parameters of the two hazard components from
mortality data (i.e., times to death and the age specific popula-
tions at risk) if the components are independent. To mathemati-
cally identify the parameters of a model where individual risk
differences change with age, and to make precise statistical esti-
mates of parameters, however, requires data on changes in the
health state of individuals over time before death.
Sacher and Trucco (19) and Strehler and Mildvan (20) devel-
oped models where individual risks of death changed stochasti-
cally as persons experienced environmental stresses. They,
however, assumed individuals start in a physiologically homo-
geneous state, which is not consistent with significant, geneti-
cally determined manifest variation in the age-at-death distribu-
tion. Applications of these models, often to "period" (i.e.
cross-sectional) population mortality rates, involve the empiri-
cal fitting of the parameters of a Gompertz approximating form
(21). However, under biologically plausible conditions, these
models produce mortality trajectories quite different than the
Gompertz. For example, a constant hazard can be generated at
late ages (20):
When vitality has decreased to the point where it is simi-
lar to the average energy fluctuation, the rate of mortality
should become constant. Such a course is approached by
human mortality figures and is to be predicted on the basis
of the integration of the Maxwell-Boltzman equation from
large energies to zero.
In addition, expanded theories of the evolution of aging pre-
dict late life mortality plateaus (22). Thus, there are several the-
oretical bases on which to expect constant mortality rates, as
observed at late ages in many species (13).
Estimating the parameters of biologically realistic models of
human mortality and aging requires longitudinal data on the
physiological state of individuals and the stochastic evolution
of those states over time (23). The model must describe the ef-
fects on mortality of internal mechanisms of physiological
change with age operating under genetic constraints. It must
also show how genetically constrained processes evolve with
age as a result of the stochastic impact of environmental shocks,
and how the operation of physiological mechanisms evolve to
respond to and modify the organism's internal environment be-
cause of those shocks.
Simms (24) experimentally examined such processes. He
inferred the physiological state of rats at specific chronological
ages by observing the effects of a quantifiable physiological
stress (i.e., the loss of a fixed amount of blood) on survival.
The capacity to survive a given level of stress can be referred to
as the "vitality" of the organism. Vitality is generally repre-
sented as a unidimensional trait scaled in terms of the thermal
energy equivalents required to maintain the organism's home-
ostasis. Rosenberg and colleagues (25) estimated the activation
energy for entropy (i.e., the threshold at which system
failure-death-occurred due to protein denaturation) as 190
kcal/mol using a Weibull hazard (a second type of extreme
value distribution) function. Strehler and Mildvan (20) esti-
mated 34 kcal/mol using a Gompertz function. Thus, different
hazard functions and their underlying failure mechanisms can
produce quite different assessments of basic biological parame-
ters and the operation ofmechanisms.
Although vitality reflects the ability to restore physiological
homeostasis after a shock as a unidimensional trait, it does not
explicitly reflect the details of the effects of the structural com-
plexity of the organism's physiological mechanisms on mortal-
ity. For example, organisms with greater structural (anatomical
and biochemical) complexity might express a higher level of
stability to a wider range of small shocks to the system (e.g.,
man's adaptation to climatic variation). By contrast, they may
show greater instability and a more clearly defined lethal
threshold for large shocks that disturb homeostasis than do sim-
ple organisms (e.g., the ability of insects versus humans to tol-
erate large doses of ionizing radiation). Thus, mathematically,
there could be a trade-off among biological complexity, the
range of successful adaptation, and robustness, because biologi-
cal complexity implies a multicomponent system where failure
occurs due to the disruption of the organ system(s) most sensi-
tive to a given stress. The larger and the more functionally dif-
ferentiated the system ofinterdependent organs, the more ways
failure can be manifest; or, conversely, the more time for effec-
tive feedback and coordinated responses between organ sys-
tems, the more ways for failure to be averted.
Therefore, the question in modeling population aging pro-
cesses is one of how the structural and biological complexities
of an organism affect the age-related ability to resist adverse
changes in the environment. This suggests that we should
search for trajectories of mortality risk that are not monotonic
with age; that, within the life span of individuals, we should in-
clude structural complexity to allow for adaptations that can,
for significantperiods of time, increase the fitness/vitality of or-
ganisms (26).
One population model that can do this is based on the theo-
retical relation of mortality to basal metabolic rates (BMR).
Zuev and colleagues (27) argue that although BMR is generally
measured by O2
consumption, changes in other physiological
parameters (e.g., blood glucose, vital capacity), taken as ratios
to the value of those parameters in persons with the optimal
BMR at a reference age (say, 20 to 30 years of age), can be
viewed as an index of vitality. They estimated parameters from
the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) data
where age, height, weight, vital capacity, and fasting glucose
were used to measure the relative metabolic rate. They obtained
satisfactory fits of the age rate of change in the relative
metabolic rate in the MRFIT data which were then applied to
Swedish female mortality data for 1861 to 1991. It was possi-
ble to describe changes in the level of mortality over time as an
age-specific function of the relative metabolic rate as calibrated
from MRFIT data. This provides a way ofphysiologically pa-

rameterizing population mortality functions using ancillary,
though indirect, data on biological variation.
MODEL CONSTRUCTION
The Theoretical Basis ofa Multidimensional Nonlinear
Stochastic Model ofAging
A crucial factor in assessing a theory on how aging works is
the evaluation of the selective advantage offered by survival to
later ages, i.e., past reproductive ages. Two possible models are
(i) antagonistic pleiotropy and (ii) disposable soma (28,29).
Antagonistic pleiotropy (30) is based on principles of popula-
tion genetics. Because natural selection shapes the biological
adaptation of the organism to the environment, the decline in
the force of selection with age in adults suggests senescence
could be due to the accumulation of deleterious mutations oc-
curring late in life. Random mutation accumulation is a rela-
tively neutral process. The stronger postulate of antagonistic
pleiotropy,however, suggests that deleterious late effects are se-
lected because they have large positive consequences for sur-
vival during reproductive ages.
The disposable soma theory, derived from principles of phys-
iological ecology, involves assessing how an organism best al-
locates its finite energy reserves to meet necessary metabolic
tasks. Here it is the level of environmental risk that is central;
Le.,if mortality risk is high, there is little advantage in investing
heavily in somatic maintenance, but a great advantage to rapid
growth and reproduction. In contrast, in a low-mortality envi-
ronment, even the fairly costly maintenance mechanisms, e.g.,
the 2% of total energy estimated as needed for DNA error
surveillance (28), become a higher priority.
It is not necessary that these two models operate indepen-
dently. Often gene-environment interactions are important in
aging and chronic disease. For example, certain metabolic en-
zymes are not generated to any significant degree until the
chemical that they are designed to metabolize is present in the
environment (and, hence, in the organism). This forms the basis
of the science ofpharmacogenetics. The presence ofthese com-
pounds are triggers, or signals, to the genes encoding the me-
tabolizing enzyme to begin manufacturing it in physiologically
significantquantities (31).
An intriguing anomaly observed in both the U.S. and Britain
is that the likelihood of surviving to ages 100+ increased rapidly
for the birth cohorts ofthe 1840s and beyond. Perutz (32) found
that the British centenarian population grew 1% per year up to
the late 1940s and then began to grow at over 6% per year.
Fogel (33) argued that similar temporal patterns of morbidity
declines in the U.S. were related to improved nutrition and in-
creases in the body mass index (BMI). Perls (34) found that the
average health of survivors to ages 80+ is remarkably good,
often better than for persons aged 70 to 79. Such changes in
late-age survival and vitality were generally viewed as too rapid
to have occurred through evolutionary processes. Fogel and
Costa (35), as a consequence, promulgated a theory of "techno-
physio" evolution to explain rapid (relative to evolutionary
time) changes in life expectancies in the last three centuries of
human experience. In this model they argue that it is necessary
that the human (and human control of) environment has
"evolved" to a more benign (favoring survival to later ages)
state, rather than the profile of genes determining human
longevity evolving to any significant degree.
Under classical models of evolutionary, longevity trait selec-
tion changes in the genetic profile require a long time. There
are, however, alternate models where genetic change (or the
stimulation of the expression of latent gene profiles) may occur
more rapidly. Quite likely, gene-environment interactions, prob-
ably involving multiple genes, are involved. In these cases, it is
the long history of evolution that has produced wide genetic
variation in humans-a large proportion of which remains la-
tent until the appropriate environmental challenge stimulates its
phenotypic expression.
As Nebert (31) suggests about drug metabolizing enzymes
(DME),
Virtually all classes of DME's listed in Table 1 [not
shown] are present in prokaryotes as well as eukaryotes. It
therefore seems very likely that many DME's originated
during early evolution, in order to provide the organism
with metabolism of important endogenous molecules as
well as the breakdown of environmental chemicals uti-
lized for energy. Subsequently, the DME's in eukaryotes
probably diversified, in response to the adverse effects of
dietary pressures and other environmental chemicals. (p.
26)
Nebert proposes, as a very early chemical substrate, CS
2,
which is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes to car-
bonyl sulfide and CO2, Once sufficient levels of intracellular O2
were generated, it is argued that a P450 enzyme appeared to use
CS2
as an energy source. Purines, pyrimidines, and biogenic
amine-related compounds are likelyearlyendogenous substrates.
There have recently been identified cell regulatory mecha-
nisms that may maintain the latency of certain genes until ap-
propriate conditions allow their expression. For example, heat
shock protein 90 (Hsp90) has been suggested as a "capacitor"
for evolution. This is because Hsp90 both (i) controls inherently
unstable signal transducers, and (ii) handles cellular stress. In
the case of significant stress, the cell's Hsp90 content may
switch to deal with protein denaturation, thereby allowing an
ensemble of genetic traits previously held latent by Hsp90 to be
phenotypically expressed. This was shown in Drosophilawhen
temperatures were below 18 or above 30°C. This was argued to
be the "first evidence for an explicit molecular mechanism that
assists the process of evolutionary change in response to the en-
vironment" (36). Additionally, mitochrondial mutations are so
rapid, and repair mechanisms so inefficient (37), that their oc-
curence within individuals may cause chronic diseases and, in-
deed, may be the basis of a generalized senescence in the sense
of a reduced capacity of cells to generate energy to meet envi-
ronmental challenges (38,39). Thus, a major research challenge
is to develop a mathematical model parameterized to represent
such effects (i.e., genetic expression accelerated by environ-
mental interactions) within the limits of existing longitudinal
data. The limitations of existing data suggests it is necessary to
make extensive use of biological theory to identify the parame-
ters of such models. We describe biological principles below
that may be useful in this process.
Hormesis
Prior stochastic models have tended to describe individuals
as undifferentiated,homogenous units (20).An alternate formu-

repetoire of responses must be genetically programmed so they
are available to beinduced by stress.
To relate this to the logic of the Hsp90 mechanism, a sharp
change in ambient temperature requires Hsp90 to reduce pro-
tein denaturation. However, a major environmental shift, if per-
sistent, will require a significant genetic response, possibly
from a repetoire of latent genetic states, expressed when Hsp90
control is reduced, that may be adaptive for the new conditions.
Thus, changes in human longevity may be resident in the
human genome and stimulated by changes in environment.
HeatShockProteins
Examples of biologically adaptive response systems in hu-
mans are multifold and exist at the molecular as well as higher
levels of biological organization. For example, heat shock pro-
tein production is a highly biologically conserved cell defense
mechanism found in both higher and lower organisms that pro-
tects many cell structures and functions (41). For example,
Hsp72 (72 refers to the weight of the protein in kilodaltons), or
DNA K, is a "molecular chaperone" that preserves the topolog-
ical structure of proteins as they are produced by ribosomes.
Preservation ofthe topological structure of the protein molecule
is essential to its physiological function. Loss of structure im-
plies loss of function-denaturation-of the protein. Hsp72
helps preserve the three-dimensional topology of the protein
(and its function) in the face ofthennal, chemical, or other chal-
lenges to the cell and is essential to the organism's ability to
survive environmental stress.
Younger organisms can produce a larger excess of Hsp72
than required to meet the typical stress than can older organ-
isms (42). In Figure 1, the production of Hsp72 due to a heat-
shock stimulus is illustrated for old (having experienced 51
replications) and young (having experienced 18 replications)
cells.
Reduced production of Hsp72 in older cells (i.e., those hav-
ing undergone more cell divisions) is due to a transcriptional
constraint (43). This means that subsequent challenges to the
cell that would have been lethal can be tolerated after a prior
nonlethal exposure because of the excess Hsp72 existing in a
previously challenged cell (44). In older cells there is, however,
less Hsp72 reserve, possibly due to the greater demand for it in
older cells, i.e., a wider range of proteins need protection from
lation that explicitly acknowledges the structural complexity of
an organism is the principle of "hormesis" (40). Honnesis sug-
gests low-level stresses may increase the "vitality" of an organ-
ism, because, to respond to such stresses, internal communica-
tion (as in "feedback" loops) is necessary among multiple-
organ systems with such communication, inducing lags in
response. This arrangement has the advantage of permitting
responses to a wider range of environmental conditions, be-
cause it allows organs to have specialized functions. It has the
disadvantage that the organism has to resist the environmental
stress until a physiological response can be made.
Hormetic mechanisms can be described as the continuous
sensing of the state (y) of a system and the relating of informa-
tion (fy) from the sensor (S) to a preferred (ideal) state (x),
e=x-fy
where the discrepancy (e) is reduced by an effector (E) ex-
pressed as a transfer function (see below). The oscillatory be-
havior observed after a fixed input, 0, depends on how efficient
the effector (E) is in reducing (e) as information propagates
through the loop (40), i.e.,
fy---+(l1.y)---+(x*-fy+)---+(E)---+y*-+S---+fy*. (i)
t
°
In this sequence, the perception (j.y) by the organism of the
current state y is perturbed by an environmental shock, 0, defin-
ing a new preferred state, x*, which is related to the change in
the actual system state (l1.y). This produces a new perceived
state discrepancy (x*-fy+), which induces a system response
(E) to alter the actual system state, y*, that is then again sensed
(S), providing an updated perceived state (j.y*).
Such physiological systems are "under-damped" so response
time does not increase with changes in load. Such overcorrect-
ing contributes to hormesis. Stebbing (40) argues that this
serves adaptive evolutionary and gene-environmental response
purposes:
A control mechanism that responds maximally upon frrst
detecting a perturbation, or simply sustains a higher level
of counteraction than is essential to neutralize some
change in load, is likely to confer an advantage over oth-
ers that do not if the load then increases because it acts as
if the increase in load had been anticipated. On the other
hand, if, following the initial increase in load there is no
further increase in load, any tendency to overcorrect will
not put the organism at a disadvantage. One can easily see,
therefore, how such subtleties in the behavior of control
mechanisms might be selected for. (p. 546)
Structural complexity, therefore, induces a temporal lag be-
tween the stress and the organism's response to stress. A system
with lagged responses requires that energy be expended in
quanta, i.e., the response cannot be continuously varying be-
cause it is not instantaneous; the energy is expended in fixed
amounts adequate to respond to the levels of lethal stress en-
countered in an environment with a significant probability.
Thus, the quantal response must be, on average, larger than the
amount of energy required to meet the environmentally "typi-
cal" stress. In addition, to have the lag built into the system, a

denaturation (42), as well as possibly a decreased capability for
expressing it. In our prior discussion of Hsp90 we showed how
the adaptive response may induce significant multiple genetic
changes, as opposed to the activation of one specific enzyme
producing gene.
P450Enzymes
Another general biological response system in humans (and
many other species) that can increase the individual's fitness
after a "moderate" stress is the cytochrome P450 enzyme sys-
tem (45). P450 refers to hemeproteins (i.e., proteins containing
an iron atom) with a near ultraviolet maximum response at a
wave length of 450 nm (nanometers) for the Fell-CO complex
due to the "presence of an axial cysteinal thiolate ligand to the
heme iron," i.e., that the molecular signal based on response to
light energy is due to the response of a sulfur-containing amino
acid related in a particular structure with the iron atom (46).
This system is interesting because certain ofits elements are bi-
ologically primitive, i.e., they were started by "animal-plant"
warfare 1.4 billion years ago when plants began to develop new
stress metabolite phytoalexins to be less palatable to animals
(45). The evolution ofthis superfamily of enzymes is also inter-
esting in that it involves a second type of gene-environment in-
teraction dynamic for accelerating genetic evolution where
there is an interaction between the genetic adaptations of differ-
ent species, i.e., animal-plant "warfare" may represent coevolv-
ing molecular dynamics with the coevolutionary parts repre-
senting members of different kingdoms (45).
In the history of the evolution of the P450 enzyme system, as
may have been true for Hsp, there was also likely the develop-
ment of system redundancy, i.e., enzymes whose production, or
level of production, required an environmental cue for the in-
duction or activation of the transcription of enzymes from spe-
cific genes. Thus, there exists latent phenotypic variation in
human, and other species, in the P450 genetic code that can
help adaptation to novel environmental conditions. That adapta-
tion, which is an induced (i.e., not evolved) genetic and struc-
tural change, may increase the ''fitness'' or vitality of the organ-
ism within a specific environment after the stress is
experienced.
Examples of inducible P450 genes are those responsible for
enzymes involved in the stage I metabolic conversion of poly-
cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (e.g., two genes in the
CYPI family). These enzymes also vary in inducibility by gen-
der (47). Ifthe inducible enzymes influenced survival to very
late ages (e.g., increase expressions of antioxidants such as su-
peroxide dimutase), this could be a nonevolutionary basis for a
rapid increase in the expression of "genetic" potential for sur-
vival to late ages. Indeed, because both Fogel (33) and Perutz
(32) suggest that nutritional changes were significant in cohorts
born after 1840, producing a sixfold or greater chance of sur-
viving to age 100 in Britain and reducing chronic disease preva-
lence by about 6% per decade in the U.S., the gene-environ-
ment interaction of specific nutrients with inducible P450
enzymes may be partly responsible for observed health and
mortality changes.
ImmuneModulation
We have discussed two highly biologically conserved cellu-
lar systems (i.e., Hsp and P450 enzymes). A third system, of
much greater complexity, is currently a mainstay of many pub-
lic health efforts, i.e., the intentional programming of the human
immune system. Such functionally specialized cells and pro-
teins exist in complex multicellular organisms. In birds the sys-
tem is much less complex than in humans, i.e., the number of
cell types and chemical signals involved in human immune re-
sponses is larger. However, these more complex human mecha-
nisms still represent the principle of applying a small environ-
mental shock to stimulate a systemic reaction so that more
severe challenges in the future can be defended against, thereby
increasingthe vitality of the organism.
This has been successfully used against a number of viral
agents, some with chronic effects (e.g., poliomyelitis). Its use is
currently being explored in cancer therapy where there is a need
for a more complete understanding of the complexities of the
human immune system in order to invoke a successful immune
response to tumor cells. Some progress has been made in im-
munotherapy for human melanoma. More recently, employing
dendritic cells, progress against prevalent solid tumors has been
made. It is the structural complexity ofthe system that allows it
to adapt to such a wide range ofmicrobiological insults. Aging
here is generally defined by a loss of immune efficiency with
age. It is of interest, however, that supplementation with certain
vitamins can improve certain types of immune response at even
advanced ages, e.g., vitamins A, C, and E (48); vitamin E (49).
The effects of these three factors may be magnified, in both
positive and negative ways, by interactions between the various
systems. For example, Hsp60, a human protein, is similar to
Hsp65, a heat shock protein in bacteria. It is hypothesized that
certain destructive autoimmune responses might be triggered
by the organism's immune system mistaking Hsp60 for the bac-
terial Hsp65.
A Multidimensional QuadraticMortalityModelwith Stochastic
StateDynamics
What do these three examples of potential increases in fit-
ness with age imply for models of human aging and mortality?
They suggest that an organism's fitness can be increased, for
some time, by appropriate external stimuli, even at late ages.
Thus, the hazard function for humans cannot be a strictly
monotonic function of age. To successfully exploit a more com-
plex model, however, the mathematics requires that we have di-
rect data on state changes of the system. We, however, do not
need to have all state variables measured to significantly in-
crease our understanding of human aging. What is needed is a
sample of state variables, or their proxies, sufficiently rich to
trace the trajectory of the physiologically significant dimen-
sions of the state space over time/age. The number of variables
required to approximate these multidimensional state dynamics
may be small (e.g., 8 to 12) and some of the measures (e.g.,
blood glucose, vital capacity index, hematocrit, cholesterol,
body mass index) may be relatively easy to make. Ifso, the pos-
sibility of successfully modeling the stochastic age dynamics of
a multidimensional physiological system is greatly increased.
However, even in the best case, current data limitations dictate a
reliance on theoretical principles (e.g., hormesis).
The structure of a mortality model based on the principle of
hormesis suggests the minimum level of mortality is found at
the smallest possible exposure, which induces the fitness mech-
anism. A quadratic mortality function can approximate such
B252 MANTON
state variable-mortality relations (50). To determine the degree
to which state variables remain unobserved, a theoretically rea-
sonable age function is included with the quadratic function to
capture systemic unmeasured effects. Such a composite func-
tion might be(51,52),

in mortality. The Gompertz scale parameter is replaced by the
J-dimensional stochastic state variable process ~it · The parame-
ter ein equation ii behaves like a dynamic "residual;' adjusting
coefficients in J3 for systematic age variation not represented by
the dynamics of measured state variables, ~it · When e= 0.0,
the function is no longer age dependent, i.e., all mortality dif-
ferentials are explained by the vector ofJ measurements x. Thus
change in eindicates the success of the measured variables in
explaining the age trajectory of state variables.
Stochasticity, including that in the mortality function (ii) is
expressed as uncertainty about trajectories of~ijt. Trajectories
of ~ijt may be modeled as a multidimensional stochastic autore-
gressive process, with coefficients vector 'Yjandconstant Cj;
where stochasticity refers to the future uncertainty, eijt of the
state of the organism, i.e.,
(iii)
where superscript T denotes the transpose of the 'Yj vector.
One way to generalize (iii) is to define a new time "metame-
ter" to represent "evolutionary" changes in state variable dy-
namics or,
xijt=C/r)+"J~(T)Ji(t_l)+e*ijt (iv)
The J equations like (iv) describe both the vector dependence
of future on past age states of the system as well as on evolu-
tionary time. Evolutionary time is represented by the depen-
dence of the autoregressive coefficients C, and 'Yj on 'T. The J X
J coefficient matrix, r('T) , can represent both positive and nega-
tive feedback between state variables. In equation iv, the effect
ofstate variable values at a prior age (t - 1) on future values is
assumed to bea function of evolutionary time ('T).
A crucial factor for the model is determining the metric ofr,
'T could be represented by calendar years, numbers of cohorts,
by indicators for specific cohorts for which genetic variation is
being examined, or possibly as a genetic "distance" parameter.
The functional dependence of the state dynamic coefficients on
evolutionary time, 'T, depends on how fast genetic structures
evolve under natural selection and how fast trends in the envi-
ronment operate to induce manifestations of latent genetic vari-
ation resident in the human genome that has been biologically
conserved. Natural selection is often viewed as operating
slowly, sometimes taking millions of years, or operating over
thousands of cohorts. There are little data with sufficient time
variation to assess these effects. An exceptional case is the re-
cent study by Westendorp and Kirkwood (53) of 33,000 British
aristocrats born 740 to 1876, a span of 1,136 years. In that
study, they believed they showed evidence of antagonastic
pleiotropy in that females with many children, or children born
early, had poorer late age survival (54).
However, there are many genetic changes that have been in-
duced more rapidly. The issue is how to separate more rapid
evolutionary effects from gene-environment interactions. First,
one has to infer evolutionary effects from equation (iv). Given
available data, some cross-cohort variation can be examined.
These may suffice to identify gene-environment interactions
(e.g., changes in the late age survival of birth cohorts from, say,
1890 to 1990), but not evolutionary changes. That requires
treating 'T as a Bayesian parameter where the existence of a ge-
netic response to a "novel" environmental agent presumes the
existence of a genetic repertoire.
For example, AIDS emerged from an African source in the
1960s or 1970s. In Northern European populations there are
persons with resistance to the AIDS virus, implying a prior ex-
posure to a similar agent. The evidence from Northern
European populations (i.e., the high prevalence of a deletion
mutation of the CCRS allele) suggests this agent operated from
1200 to 4300 years ago, i.e., long before most historically
recorded infectious disease pandemics such as the bubonic
plagues (55). However, there are documented selection effects
of the influenza pandemic of 1917 (and of more recent flu epi-
demics) for the ability to resist specific flu viruses. The 1917
flu virus may have induced biological damage in survivors to
be manifest as chronic diseases at late ages at relatively recent
dates. Thus, the effects of the 1917 pandemic (and of streptoc-
cocal infections which may affect congestive heart disease rates
(56» could represent selection for genetic traits and chronic
disease effects on aging, i.e., both 'Y and 'T could have been al-
tered. There is evidence of other microbial-gene interactions
that produce chronic disease risks. For example, Lin and col-
leagues (57) suggested that the APOE-4 allele, which is related
to Alzheimer's disease risk, may operate by increasing suscepti-
bility to herpes simplex virus type 1 in certain regions of the
brain. Technologies to establish the evolutionary time scale for
such genetic effects by examining phenotypic dispersion across
species exist. For humans, maternal mitochrondrial DNA is
also useful to trace such effects.
Thus, if such markers can be tracked, then evolution may be
made a known parametric function of time, so 'T can be replaced
by a parametric function. With 'T constrained to specific values,
gene-environment effects will be easier to identify. However,
that will not fully capture gene-environment interactions, i.e.,
the genetic determinants of evolutionary time dependency in-
volve environmental effects for gene expression (i.e., as illus-
trated for Hsp, P450, and the immune system). That is, many
basic cellular defenses are highly biologically conserved and
exist in potential genetic form to increase the adaptive reper-
toire of individuals. This response latency can be reflected by
extending the state dynamic equation to include appropriate in-
teraction terms, or,
x ijt = CJ'T)+ "J~('T) X i(t-I) + tP~('T) gi(t-I)&) {'i(t-IJ+e**ijt (v)
where ® is the Kronecker product that defines the interactions
ofJ endogenous and K endogenous (environmental) risk fac-
tors, and l\J/'T) is the vector ofJ X K coefficients that apply to
the J X K interaction terms generated by the Kronecker prod-
uct. It also can be referred to as {( tP~('T».(Y(t-I)}or a vector of
environmentally altered coefficients of state changes, -!i(t-l);
which may change slowly due to evolutionary processes
('T), but rapidly due to environmental system changes (i.e.,

Yi(t-l))' This can also be viewed as three way interactions (i.e.,
\¥j·'T Yi (t-I))
where ~ is an unknown coefficient vector, 'T comes
from biological data, and Yitis directly measured. Viewed as
three-way interactions, this suggests strategies by which evolu-
tionary and gene-environment effects on survival might be
identified. By substituting equation v in the quadratic mortality
function we make survival an explicit function of the interac-
tion. If eis reduced by the introduction of the state dynamics
with the three way interaction, over the egenerated when equa-
tion iv is used to represent state dynamics, then we have evi-
dence of both evolutionary and gene-environment effects.
What this means for the age trajectory of mortality is shown
in Figure 2.
In Figure 2 the quadratic function is plotted, for each of four
ages (50, 59, 68, and 95 years). As age increases, the quadratic
function becomes steeper, i.e., there is a risk factor-age interac-
tion that increases mortality risk. At age 50, this interaction is
weak so that known risk factor variation dominates individual
differences in mortality. By age 95, currently unmeasured (pos-
sibly genetic) factors are important. Ifwe could successfully
measure all relevant state variables, and model their dynamics,
then ewould be reduced and the hazard at age 95 would be less
steep, i.e., more like the function at age 50. Ifall state variables
could be measured, then e= 0.0 and there would be no change
in the shape of the function with age. In studies of the 1982,
1984, and 1989 National Long-Term Care Surveys, functional
measures reduced e by 40% or more (52). However, the
quadratic function still increased rapidly with age, indicating
the presence of important latent factors. A model not including
ewould attribute that age change to observed risk factors,
which forces them to unrealistic mean values in attempting to
compensate for age variation. This distorts the relation of risk
factors to mortality and quickly (by age 60) produces biologi-
cally implausible behavior (58). The mortality of the population
is also a function of the stochastic state dynamics, i.e., coeffi-
cients in equation (ii) are functions of the state dynamic equa-
tions (i.e., iii, iv, or v) depending on what is assumed about the
dynamics and their genetic determinants.
DISCUSSION
We examined existing models (e.g., the Gompertz and
Weibull) of human mortality and aging and suggested the need
for models of human aging to be re-formulated in stochastic,
multidimensional, dynamic terms. We discussed plausible ex-
tensions (51) of existing theoretical models (20,21) to imple-
ment these dynamics and review their biological relevance
when such models were applied to both risk factors and to mul-
tidimensional disability data from the 1982 to 1994 National
Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS). For example, the effect of
unobserved risk factors were reduced by almost half when a
dynamic disability process was estimated and made part of the
model (52).
We reviewed how some of those models might be further ex-
tended to deal with evolutionary effects and time. The phe-
nomenon of mortality, and its dependence on age, is far more
complex biologically than is implied by standard hazard func-
tions. Work on more complete stochastic models of aging is
needed to integrate the wide range of findings about the dy-
namics of aging now emerging from experimental and epidemi-
ological studies.
