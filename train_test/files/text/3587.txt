Introduction: Why Examine the Pitfalls
of Visualization?
The rise of visualization's use on the Web, in social media, in
education, and in management calls for a systematic under-
standing of the limitations of graphic representations and of
potential mistakes that are committed when designing or
viewinginformationandknowledgevisualizations.Examining
the potential risks and common mistakes committed in the
interpretation and in the creation of visualization is relevant to
enhance scholar understanding of an important aspect of
visual literacy. In this article, the word visualization refers to
the graphic display of information and knowledge. From a
pragmatic point of view, a compilation and classification of
pitfalls of visuals can be used as an instructional tool, to pro-
vide a comprehensive list, a vocabulary and definition of rel-
evant terms related to the risks of visualization. Practitioners
could profit from such a classification by using it as a check-
list, against which they can test images and improve document
design, infographics, or digital images.
Despite the notable number of publications on the bene-
fits of using visual representations in a variety of fields
(Meyer, Höllerer, Jancsary, & Van Leeuwen, 2013), few
studies have systematically investigated the possible pitfalls
that exist when creating or interpreting visual representa-
tions. Some information visualization researchers, however,
have raised the issue and called to action: "Articles on limita-
tions and pitfalls [of visualization] are scarce. For the
advancement of the field, more such reports would be highly
beneficial" (van Vijk, 2006, p. 426). Presently, a clear over-
view and classification of the risks and disadvantages associ-
ated with visual depictions of information has not been
provided. Thus, as evaluated by Pauwels (2010), "Due to a
lack of integrative efforts, we are in danger of constantly
`reinventing' knowledge about the visual and its workings"
(in Meyer et al., 2013).
Such a synopsis could provide a comprehensive theoreti-
cal overview based on prior research findings, to assist
researchers in investigating systematically the effects and the
boundaries of visual representations of information (Eppler,
2006; Fong, Valerdi, & Srinivasam, 2007). This article aims
to provide an instructive schema that contains prior research
findings from a variety of fields related to visualization.
The goal of this article is to identify and classify the key
problematic issues and risks inherent in visual representations,

The Pitfalls of Visual Representations: A
Review and Classification of Common
Errors Made While Designing and
Interpreting Visualizations
Sabrina Bresciani1 and Martin J. Eppler1
Abstract
A large body of research has addressed the benefits of visualization, whereas the analysis of the pitfalls has not received
systematicattention.Weaimtoprovideanoverviewofthecommonpitfallsandpotentialdisadvantagesofvisualrepresentations
based on a multidisciplinary literature review. Subsequently, we develop a theoretically grounded classification of common
cognitive, emotional, and social risks of visualization and populate it with a comprehensive list of visualization pitfalls. The
aim of this research is not to diminish the potential of visualization, but rather to improve visual literacy by structuring our
understanding of the possible limitations of graphic representations.

as well as to provide a structure to guide work in visualization
production and quality assessment. We argue that this is an
important step in visualization research to use as a basis for the
future development of guidelines and rules for visualization
developers and users, and for instructors. To compile a list of
risks of visualization, we have screened studies from multiple
related research domains. We have focused on the visual repre-
sentation of information and thus did not analyze areas such as
fine arts, photography, film, or scientific imaging.
We structure the article by starting with a review of visual-
ization literature. In the third section, we provide a classifica-
tion populated with reported disadvantages of visualizations.
We then present examples of how to utilize the classification
for evaluating and improving graphic representations of
information. We end with the conclusions and an outlook for
future research.
Our aim with the present work is not to diminish the poten-
tial of visualization. It is rather an attempt to deepen and struc-
tureourunderstandingofitspossiblelimitationsandconstraints.
This is relevant not only to avoid or detect mistakes in the pro-
duction and interpretation of visualization applications, but
also as a teaching tool to foster visual literacy.
A Review of Literature
To survey the current state of research on the pitfalls of visu-
alization, we have analyzed 51 articles published in peer-
reviewed journals and books in 6 main fields of research
related to visual representations: (a) statistical graphic repre-
sentations, (b) visual literacy and visual communication, (c)
information visualization and human­computer interaction
(HCI), (d) management studies, and (e) cross-cultural studies
related to visualization. These fields have been selected for
their coverage of characteristics of visual representations.
Although several other fields have addressed the effects of
visualization--such as film studies, sociology, architecture,
or education--we have consciously chosen to set the bound-
aries of this classification to those areas that are closely
related to the graphical displays of information. In Table 1,
we have compiled a list of all the pitfalls of visualization
found in the research reviewed in these fields.Abrief descrip-
tion of each disadvantage is provided in the Table 2.
We witness the earliest and most comprehensive collec-
tions of visual representation pitfalls in the area of statistical
graphic representations. The main approach in this area has
been to showcase particularly bad examples of visualized sta-
tistical information and to learn from them. This has been
elegantly demonstrated in Edward Tufte's (1986, 1990, 1997,
2007) popular books in which he highlights numerous ways
in which visualization falls short of its potential. In his works,
he uses several anecdotal examples of graphics that fail to tell
the truth. He goes on to explain why and how they fail, for
example, by measuring their "lie factor" (given by the size of
the effect shown in the graph divided by the size of the actual
effect found in the data). Similarly, Wainer points out 10
typical pitfalls in visualizing information in his article, "How
to display data badly" (Wainer, 1984). His ironic counter-
recommendations are as follows: (a) Minimize the data den-
sity, (b) minimize the data­ink ratio, (c) ignore the visual
metaphor altogether, (d) only order matters, (e) graph data out
of context, (f) change scale in mid-axis, (g) ignore the impor-
tant, (h) jiggle the baseline, (i) Austria first! (ordering graph
items alphabetically), and (j) label illegibly, incompletely,
incorrectly, and ambiguously. Other similar publications in
the field, as the popular book, "How to Lie with Statistics"
(Huff, 1993), emphasize how information visualization can
be used to mislead.
In the fields of Visual Literacy and Visual Communication,
authors have discussed the heterogeneous interpretation of
visual material due to differing prior experience (Avgerinou
& Pettersson, 2011; Dwyer, 1972), including the knowledge
of visual conventions (Avgerinou, 2007), and different cul-
tural backgrounds (Avgerinou, 2007; Forsythe, 2011). At the
same time, Knox's (2007) study has shown emerging con-
ventions in visual design, whereas Machin and Van Leeuwen
(2007) have discussed the increasing institutionalization of
visual cues in global media (in Meyer et al., 2013).
In the rich and rapidly evolving domain of Information
Visualization, we can find a broad discussion on the proper-
ties of graphic representations and their positive use, but
fewer considerations of their potential drawbacks. In particu-
lar, Ware (2004) identifies the underlying mechanisms of
information visualization perception and brings to light
potential issues of visualization use, including change blind-
ness, wrong salience, wrong use of color, visual stress, cul-
tural differences, and breaking conventions. Conversely,
psychologist Kosslyn (2006) focuses on specific formats of
graphic design (e.g., pie charts, bar and line graphs) and dis-
cusses graphic representation dangers such as defocus (dis-
traction) and over-complexity. Van Vijk's (2006) "Views on
Visualization" is one of the few articles that explicitly con-
siders "consequences and limitations of visualization." He
finds that visualization can have high initial cost to be under-
stood (when new techniques are developed), is at times sub-
jective, and can be wrong and misleading. Cawthon and
Vande Moere (2007) studied the aesthetics of data visualiza-
tion and found that information visualizations may trigger
unwanted emotions or distractions. Few (2006) has exten-
sively addressed the pitfalls of graphic dashboards used in
organizations, addressing issues such as wrong use of color,
low accuracy, useless decoration, and so on. Also in the spe-
cific area of visual analytics (Thomas & Cook, 2005) and
collaborative visual analytics (Heer & Agrawala, 2008), the
positive and negative mechanisms underlying the effective-
ness of visualizations are examined. In the subdomain of
Visual Languages, researchers have examined disadvantages
of diagrams and of notations, as for example, unevenness
(Blackwell et al., 2001; Green & Petre, 1996) or over-
reliability appearance (Crilly, Blackwell, & Clarkson, 2006).
In the study of diagrams, authors have discussed the
Bresciani and Eppler 3
limitations and possible restrictions of a specific format, for
example, in the seminal study by Larkin and Simon (1987)
and in the study on visualization over-determinism by
(Shimoijma, 1996). In the related field of HCI, a few authors
have considered the potential drawbacks of interactive visu-
alizations, but only in the context of user interfaces--and
how they inform or confuse users (Shneiderman, 1998).
The recent stream of management focusing on boundary
objects and sociomaterial practices explores the potential
(and to a much lesser extent, the risks) of using visualization
in organizations (Buergi & Roos, 2003; Eppler, 2004; Eppler
& Burkhard, 2005; Eppler, Mengis, & Bresciani, 2008;
Henderson, 1995; Lurie & Mason, 2007; Meyer et al., 2013,
Al-Kassab, Ouertani, Schiuma, & Neely, 2014; Roos, Bart,
& Statler, 2004). These studies typically highlight visualiza-
tion advantages through case evidence. A subset of manage-
ment studies analyzes specifically the positive and negative
effects of visualization for collaboration (Ewenstein &
Whyte, 2007; Fong et al., 2007; Mengis, 2007; Nicolini,
2007; Oliver, 2007; Tversky, 2005; Whyte, Ewenstein,
Hales, & Tidd, 2007), also in computer-mediated settings
(DeSanctis & Gallupe, 1987). For instance, the political use
of images in collaborative setting may provide unequal pos-
sibilities to contribute to the discussion (Henderson, 1995;
Nicolini, 2007; Whyte et al., 2007), or it may affect the typi-
cal behavior of the discussants (Nicolini, 2007) who might
pay more attention to the visual rather than to the facial
expressions of the group participants.
Cross-cultural studies have also addressed the differing
interpretation of visual representations caused by cultural
variations: Already in 1966, Segall, Campbell, and
Herskovits (1966) have described the influence of culture
on visual perception. Nisbett (2003) and Nisbett and
Miyamoto (2005) have shown through eye-tracking studies
how Westerners and East Asians look at images differently,
with Westerners focusing on the main central objects and
East Asians paying attention also to the background. Chan,
Li, Diehl, and Terlutter (2007) have described cross-cultural
variations in consumers' response to emotional images. A
comprehensive review of cultural factors influencing the
reception of visual representations of information has
recently been published (Bresciani, 2014), which include,
among others, the different meaning of colors and symbols
across cultures, the appropriate use of visual humor in
diverse cultural setting, and reading direction (right to left
for Arabic and some Asian languages).
In total, we have identified more than 50 articles and
books that discuss the potential pitfalls of graphic represen-
tations of information and knowledge. We have consciously
not considered disadvantages related to the mere functional-
ities of specific visualization environments or software pack-
ages, instead concentrating our compilation of disadvantages
on a higher level of granularity (e.g., more conceptual short-
comings). From this literature review, a number of concepts
have emerged (see Table 1 for the complete list), with
differing levels of abstraction and scope. In the next section,
we cluster the results in a 3 × 2 classification.
Proposed Classification of Visualization Pitfalls
In this section, we propose a classification of visualization
errors or disadvantages to structure the many factors that can
make a graphic representation dysfunctional, and we populate
it with the pitfalls that we have found in the literature. A clas-
sification of the large quantity of concepts that we have col-
lected is necessary to structure them in an efficient and
relevant way, as well as to make them usable and accessible.
The classification that we propose, shown in the follow-
ing table (Table 1), is a matrix based on two causes of pit-
falls, the designer or the user, and three types of (negative)
effects: (a) cognitive, (b) emotional, and (c) social (Buergi &
Roos, 2003). The concepts we have collected from the litera-
ture are classified and referenced in the six resulting cells. A
short definition of each concept can be found in Table 2.
More specifically, the cause of a visualization problem
can be twofold: the encoding (that is, caused by the designer/
developer) or the decoding (that is, caused by the reader/
user; Avgerinou, 2007). In the latter case, the person who
reads the image makes a mistake in the interpretation (Tufte,
1986). The designer can intentionally or unintentionally
introduce mistakes or drawbacks in a visual representation.
Today's interactive technologies have substantially contrib-
uted to empowering everyone to become a designer and
swiftly create visual representations: The classification is
thus useful especially for non-professional creators of visual
representation who might not be familiar with design prin-
ciples. These digital technologies, especially when utilized
in social media platforms, allow users to both consume and
create visual representations: Nevertheless, the classification
is still valuable because a person can be either the user or the
creator of a specific visual representation at a given time
(although on a platform, a person can be both a user and a
developer but of different visuals). The distinction between
producer and user becomes even more meaningful when
images are shared on social media (Neher, 2013) because
different meaning can be attributed to the same visual by dif-
ferent users: It is thus important to find the origin of the
potential problems (that is, the visual or the viewer). The dis-
tinction between designer and user-induced mistakes is par-
ticularly valuable in pragmatic terms, as it can give immediate
insights for the producers and for the evaluators of visualiza-
tions, respectively. Visualization designers should look at the
encoding section of the schema in Table 1, while users should
pay attention to the pitfalls in the decoding section (or col-
umn) of the schema.
Conversely, the distinction between intentional and
manipulative (Huff, 1993; Tufte, 1986; Wainer, 1984) or
unintentional pitfall is at times difficult to classify, as it is not
always possible to discern intentionality by merely observ-
ing a visualization. Thus, intentionality cannot be used for

Table 2. List of Visual Representation Pitfalls With Brief Explanations.
Disadvantage Author(s) Description
Cognitive: Encoding
Ambiguity (Eppler & Burkhard, 2005; Tufte, 2007) Visual notations may contain unlabeled symbols that may
be ambiguous and thus difficult to interpret.
 Breaking conventions (Ware, 2004) A visualization may use different visual rules or symbols
than normally expected.
Confusion (Eppler & Burkhard, 2005; Few, 2006) Visualizations that do not have a clear overall logic or
accompanying text may confuse the viewers.
 Cost to make explicit (Larkin & Simon, 1987) "Diagrammatic representations typically display
information that is only implicit in sentential
representations and that therefore has to be
computed, sometimes at great cost, to make it explicit
for use" (Larkin & Simon, 1987).
 Cryptic encoding (Tufte, 1986) The visual format used to represent data may not be
universally understandable and confuse some audiences.
Defocused (Few, 2006; Kosslyn, 2006; Tufte, 1986; Ware,
2004)
Visualization may distract a person from the main goal
he or she tries to achieve or emphasize, at the same
time, using multiple items.
Hiding/obscuring (Few, 2006; Kosslyn, 2006; Tufte, 1986;
Wainer, 1984)
A visualization may hide important insights contained in
data by the way that data are represented graphically
(e.g., covarying height and width, changing the starting
point, or varying the aspect ratio, etc.).
Inconsistency (Cawthon & Vande Moere, 2007; Tufte, 1986) A visualization may make inconsistent use of certain
symbols, for example, changing their function or
meaning without signaling this change.
 Low accuracy (Few, 2006; Kosslyn, 2006; Tufte, 1986;
Wainer, 1984)
Visualization generally depicts information less precisely
than number and tables.
Misleading/Distorting (Tufte, 1986; van Wijk, 2006; Wainer, 1984) Some visualizations are drawn in a way that may lead to
incorrect conclusions.
 Misuse of figure ground (Tufte, 1986) The figure ground and layer contrasts are not illustrated
properly.
 Not respected gestalt
principles
(Tufte, 1986) Some visualizations do not group related information
(proximity principle) or do not represent the same
kind of information with the same symbols (similarity
principle).
Over-determinism (Shimoijma, 1996) A visualization is, by its nature, inherently more specific
than text in depicting concepts and relations.
Over/under-reliability
appearance
(Crilly, Blackwell, & Clarkson, 2006; Green
& Petre, 1996; Henderson, 1995; Whyte,
Ewenstein, Hales, & Tidd, 2007)
Highly polished visualizations might prevent users from
criticizing the content whereas more provisional
sketches encourage suggested revisions.
Over-complexity (Few, 2006; Kosslyn, 2006; Tversky, 2005) The visualization depicts elements in a more complex
manner than necessary.
Over-simplification (Eppler & Burkhard, 2005; Nicolini, 2007) Some graphic depictions leave out essential elements to
simplify information, which leads to a distortion of the
information.
Redundancy (Few, 2006; Tufte, 1986) In some graphic representations of information, the
information is visualized in superfluous ways that
clutter the visualization unnecessarily.
 Task-visualization fit (Al-Kassab, Ouertani, Schiuma, & Neely, 2014) The lack of an appropriate fit between the task and the
visual representation can be misleading.
Technology/template
driven
(Few, 2006; Tufte, 1986) Some visualizations are based on pre-defined forms or
templates that are not adequate for the communication
task at hand or the information to be represented.
 Time-consuming to
produce
(van Wijk, 2006) Producing a visualization may take a disproportional
amount of time for the information that is
communicated.

Disadvantage Author(s) Description
Unclear (Cawthon & Vande Moere, 2007) A graphic depiction may leave too much room for
interpretation regarding its purpose or main message.
Unevenness (Blackwell, 2001) A visualization can typically not be used in many different
ways. It may privilege some activities while making others
harder, thus constraining users' thoughts in one direction.
Cognitive: Decoding
 Change blindness (Ware, 2004) Important changes in pictures may go unnoticed by the
viewers.
 Channel thinking (Mengis, 2007) The visualization can direct thinking in an inappropriate
direction (caused by a metaphor or familiarity level).
 Depending on
perceptual skills
(Nisbett, 2003; Tufte, 1986; van Wijk, 2006) People see differently, depending on physical (e.g., color
blindness) and cultural factors (attention to foreground
or background).
 Difficult to understand (Buergi & Roos, 2003; Cawthon & Vande
Moere, 2007)
Some visualizations are inherently difficult to understand
because they depict many complex relationships that
may not be optimally represented.
 Focus on low relevance
items
(Lurie & Mason, 2007) Visual representations may accentuate biases in decision
making by increasing attention to particular attributes
or less diagnostic information.
 High requirement on
training and resources
(Chen, 2005; van Wijk, 2006) The use of certain images or visual applications requires
extensive training and support.
 Knowledge of visual
conventions
(Avgerinou, 2007; Knox, 2007; Machin & Van
Leeuwen, 2007)
Knowing the visual conventions (e.g., reading from left to
right or in a clockwise direction) is a learned skill, not
a natural ability.
Misuse (Eppler & Burkhard, 2005) A visualization may be used for a purpose for which it
was not intended or adequate.
Overload (Eppler & Burkhard, 2005; Eppler et al., 2006;
Tufte, 1997; Ware, 2004)
Some graphic depictions overload the senses of a viewer
by presenting too many visual elements at the same time.
Reification (Whyte et al., 2007) Tendency to consider an abstract concept as concrete,
for example, attributing properties of a material object
to that concept.
 Wrong salience (Al-Kassab et al., 2014; Few, 2006; Green &
Petre, 1996; Mengis, 2007; Ware, 2004)
The user concentrates on the wrong issue, for example,
on the tool or on the visual appearance, instead of on
the task.
Emotional: Encoding
Disturbing (Cawthon & Vande Moere, 2007; Tufte, 1990) Some images may cause emotional harm to the viewer
because of their shocking or repellent content.
Boring (Cawthon & Vande Moere, 2007) Some graphic representations are perceived as
uninteresting and do not help to focus attention for an
appropriate amount of time.
Ugly/unappealing (Cawthon & Vande Moere, 2007) Some graphic representations may reduce the
motivation to explore them in spite of their
informative content due to a sub-optimal, non-
aesthetic form.
 Wrong use of color (Few, 2006; Tufte, 1986; Wainer, 1984; Ware,
2004)
The inadequate use of colors or their combinations may
make an image confusing or unappealing.
Emotional: Decoding
 Visual stress (Ware, 2004) Some kind of patterns (striped or flickering) may cause
illness in the viewer.
 Personal likes and
dislikes
(Tversky, 2005) Some visualizations may get more attention than others,
not because of their importance, but because they fit
the cognitive preferences of a particular viewer.
 Prior knowledge and
experience
(Al-Kassab et al., 2014; Avgerinou &

Disadvantage Author(s) Description
Social: Encoding
 Affordance conflict (Nicolini, 2007) A visualization may signal the wrong kind of required
(inter-)activity to its viewers.
 Hierarchy, exercise of
power
(Ewenstein & Whyte, 2007; Henderson, 1995;
Nicolini, 2007; Whyte et al., 2007)
The political use of images in collaborative settings
by certain people may result in unequal possibilities
to contribute (e.g., through manipulative use of
visualization provisionality, facilitator choice, sequence
of contributions, etc.).
 Inhibit conversation (Nicolini, 2007; Oliver, 2007) Having one's contributions visualized (for example, in
a group context) may lead to participants being less
outspoken about certain issues.
 Rhythm of freezing and
unfreezing
(Whyte et al., 2007) A visualization may make a certain viewpoint or idea
too rigorous and too fixed, thus not leaving adequate
conditions to invent alternative views or options.
 Turn taking alteration (Eppler, 2004) Using a graphic representation to guide a team
conversation can affect the natural turn taking within
a group in favor of those who can directly change that
visualization.
 Unequal participation (Mengis, 2007) The use of visualizations in group contexts may lead to
unequal participation on behalf of the participants.
Social: Decoding
 Altered behavior (Eppler et al., 2006; Mengis, 2007; Nicolini,
2007)
The use of visuals in group interaction may affect the
typical behavior of the user.
 Cultural and cross-
cultural differences
(Al-Kassab et al., 2014; Avgerinou &
Pettersson, 2011; Bresciani, 2014; Ewenstein
& Whyte, 2007; Forsythe, 2011; Henderson,
1995; Nisbett, 2003; Segall, Campbell, &
Herskovits, 1966; Ware, 2004)
The meaning of symbols and colors is not universal,
and hence, some graphic representations may be
misinterpreted in other cultural contexts.
 Defocused from non-
verbal interaction
(DeSanctis & Gallupe, 1987) A group's focus on a central visualization on a board or
screen can take away the participants' attention from
their body language and gestures, which give important
information on how to interpret verbal contributions.
 Different perspectives (Heer & Agrawala, 2008) Different people look at issues from different points of
view (e.g., people from different organizational levels).
 Hiding differences of
opinion
(Eppler et al., 2006) The use of one visualization in a group context may hide
individual differences of opinion because of the need to
find one common representation.
 Recency effect (Nisbett, 2003; Tufte, 1986) The meaning of a visualization is not interpreted in a
vacuum but as part of a broader context that depends
on user's previous exposure.
 Time-consuming to
agree upon
(DeSanctis & Gallupe, 1987) Group discussion based on visualization requires more
time than verbal discussion.
Table 2. (continued)
classification purposes, as it is often impossible to determine
whether a designer or author has made a genuine mistake, or
whether he or she intended to mislead.
Considering the second criterion of the classification, the
effect of visualization drawbacks, we adopt the threefold dis-
tinction of cognitive, emotional, and social effects (Buergi &
Roos, 2003; Kernbach, Bresciani, & Eppler, 2015; Roos et al.,
2004). Similar categorizations include Norman's classification
of the design field (Norman, 2004): He distinguishes the vis-
ceral level (corresponding to emotions), the behavioral level
(corresponding to usability), and the reflective level (regarding
the meaning of things, or the self-image). This classification is
also consistent with social interdependency theory, developed
in the educational context, which distinguishes cognitive,
behavioral, and social dimensions (Johnson & Johnson, 2005).
Our proposed classification includes the often neglected
"social" effects of visualization following the emerging trend
on collaborative information visualization (Bresciani,
Blackwell, & Eppler, 2008; Keel, 2007) in which visuals are
considered supports for collaborative sense-making and under-
standing. Along the same line of thought, Heer and Agrawala
(2008) state that
8 SAGE Open
although most research to date assumes a single-user focus on
perceptual and cognitive processes, in practice, sensemaking is often
a social process involving parallelization of effort, discussion, and
consensus building. Thus, to fully support sensemaking, interactive
visualization should also support social interaction. (p. 49)
We can observe that in Table 1, the list of cognitive disad-
vantages is the most extensive section. Most of the studies
have focused on the cognitive effects of visualization,
neglecting its social or emotional consequences. In the con-
text of visualizing organizational strategy, Roos et al. (2004)
also confirmed this impression: "While social and emotional
modes of experience are involved in strategy process, in gen-
eral they are suppressed in favour of cognitive elements" (p.
551). The emotional category is referring to the most visceral
impact of visualization on the user's feelings, whereas the
social category includes disadvantages caused by the collab-
orative use of visualizations.
The categorization presented has implications for practice,
as it can support visualization users and producers to prevent,
reduce, or eliminate visualization threats. In this sense, it can
be used as a negative checklist. Designers as well as research-
ers are supported by having a comprehensive view of the most
common cognitive problems as well as the often overlooked
social and emotional issues that may exist when using graphic
representations of information. Visualization users can utilize
the table as an instrument to control or reflect on their own
potential biases as well as a designer's quality of work.
We do not claim that all the elements identified in the
table are always problematic. There may be instances where
one or several of the listed issues are productively used on
purpose. Visual ambiguity, for example, may lead to the cre-
ative re-interpretation of a graphic representation and thus
lead to new insights (Eppler et al., 2008). Another example
of a visualization risk that may provide a benefit is the shock-
ing or disturbing effect of a graphic or an emotionally exag-
gerated visualization that, as a benefit, would be remembered
for a long time (e.g., Figure 3). Furthermore, a high level of
complexity should not be considered negative in absolute
sense; rather, it depends on the familiarity and training of the
target audience. Table 2 provides a brief description of each
of the visualization pitfalls, based on the literature.
In the next section, we provide examples of the applica-
tion of the classification for the evaluation of visualizations.
Examples
The aforementioned classification can be used as a reference
point for evaluating and improving visualizations. To sim-
plify this task for practitioners, the classified list of pitfalls is
provided also in the pragmatic format of "Questions to Ask"
in the appendix, which can be used as a checklist by visual-
ization producers and users.
It is worth noticing that we do not expect to find issues
with all the characteristics listed in the classification when
looking at specific examples, but rather only with a few of
them for each analyzed image. We will provide two exam-
ples of visual representations that present problems, and we
will analyze the first from the point of view of the designer
(an encoding problem), and the second from the point of
view of the user (a decoding problem), following the cause-
related criteria proposed in the classification.
We start by analyzing Figure 1, reported and discussed by
Wainer (1984) and representing U.S. imports and exports,
taking the point of view of a designer who receives the task
of reviewing and improving the visual. We conduct an ana-
lytical evaluation of visualization problems based on the
classification (with each identified disadvantage reported
witin quotes), and we use the evaluation as a guideline to
describe the solutions to counteract the negative effects.
For this task, we need to consider the "encoding" section
of the classification, as we want to identify issues induced by
the designer (the left column of Table 1). The classification
can simply be used by considering the list of pitfalls, one by
one, against the visual representation to be analyzed. In the
proposed example (Figure 1), we find issues with "breaking
conventions" (which is the second listed issue in the classifi-
cation of pitfalls, based on Ware, 2004): Both the axes vary
between the two graphs. Specifically, the y-axis is doubled in
value in the graph on the right-hand side (US$3.000 million
compared with US$6.000 million): The reader would expect
the same scales on both graphs for comparison purposes.
Continuing with comparing the list of negatives with the
image, we see that there is "inconsistency" (Cawthon &
Vande Moere, 2007; Tufte, 1986): In fact, the colors indicat-
ing the imports and exports are inconsistent between the
right-hand side and left-hand side graph. In particular, in the
graph about China trades, the imports are depicted in black
and the exports in white, whereas in the graph on Taiwan
trades (on the right-hand side), the meaning of the color is
reversed. Next, we find a problem with "misleading/distort-
ing" information (Tufte, 1986; van Vijk, 2006; Wainer, 1984)
Figure 1. U.S. trade with China and Taiwan.

Bresciani and Eppler 9
Figure 2. Improved version of Figure 1.
because the colors used to represent trade to and from the
United States are inverted within the same graph without any
reason, thus misleading the reader. Proceeding with the list,
we can identify a "redundancy" (Few, 2006; Tufte, 1986) in
the visual representation, as the data refer to the same quanti-
ties (time and millions of dollars): Higher efficiency could be
achieved by depicting all the data on one single graph (to
optimize the so called "data-ink ratio" proposed by Tufte,
1986). In this specific image, we do not identify issues
related to emotional or social effects.
Given the specific disadvantages of this visualization identi-
fied through the schema, we can propose solutions to improve it.
As a first step, the axes should follow the convention of having
the same scale on both graphs. Similarly, the import and exports
should be depicted with consistent colors across the graphs. To
facilitate the comparison of the information provided, we can
avoid the redundancy of having two graphs and draw all the data
on one single chart. An improved representation, based on the
identified problems, is shown in Figure 2. We now have a com-
pletely different insight regarding the meaning of the data. First,
we swiftly notice that there is greater trade exchange occurring
with Taiwan than with China. Second, the dotted lines depict
exports, whereas the continuous lines represent imports; we can
see that the U.S. level of exports to China is greater than the
imports. The reverse is true for Taiwan, from which the United
Statesimportsmorethanitexports.Thesevisualinsightswerenot
available with the original version of the image.The classification
hasthushelpedinsystematicallyidentifyingissueswiththevisual
representation, which can then be addressed and solved.
We now take the point of view of the user to explain the
"decoding" section of the classification: We act as a common
reader of a visual representation found in a magazine or on the
Internet. We show how to read a visualization critically using
the proposed classification to be aware of pitfalls induced by
our reading of the image. As exemplary illustration, we con-
sider Figure 3, which represents civilian war casualties of the
20th century by country (Understandingusa, 2007).
Although there might be issues with the visualization
induced by the designer, in this paragraph, we focus on
differences in interpretation caused by the viewer. To do so,
we utilize the right-hand side column of the classification
(Table 1), which refers to decoding issues, and consider the
visualization pitfalls one by one. We do not identify issues
with change blindness or channel thinking, whereas we do
recognize that interpretation of this visual is based on "per-
ceptual skills" (Nisbett, 2003; Tufte, 1986; van Vijk, 2006)
and "prior knowledge and experience" (Avgerinou &
Pettersson, 2011; Chen, 2005): Some participants interpret
the concentric circles as an indication of the quantity of
civilian casualties by country, assuming that the larger the
circle is, the higher the number of deaths. However, if we
read the image carefully, we can see that the opposite is the
case: In the innermost circle (which is the smallest) are posi-
tioned countries that had more than 1,000,000 casualties,
whereas in the outermost circle, we find countries that wit-
nessed less than 5,000 deaths. This is the case because the
visual is developed on the metaphor of the shooting target;
thus, more points are scored when hitting the center.
However, users not familiar with shooting sports might find
it difficult to detect and understand the intended metaphor.
Second, we find an issue also with the emotional user-
induced effect of "personal likes and dislikes" (Tversky,
2005). In fact, different people may react differently to this
type of graphic representation depending on their gender and
sensitivity: The target superimposed on the image of a family
is a very strong choice.
Finally, the social user-induced issue of "cultural and
cross-cultural differences" (Avgerinou & Pettersson, 2011;
Bresciani, 2014; Ewenstein & Whyte, 2007; Forsythe, 2011;
Henderson, 1995; Nisbett, 2005; Segall et al., 1966; Ware,
2004) plays a role in the interpretation of this visualization,
as some cultures are less inclined to crude representations,
whereas others regularly use shocking visualizations to
attract the attention of readers (Chan et al., 2007).
Through the above examples, we aimed to show how the
classification of visual representations pitfalls can be used to
systematically analyze visual representations with regard to
their potential drawbacks.
Discussion/Theoretical Implications
Motivated by van Vijk's (2006) call to action to develop arti-
cles on the limitations and pitfalls of visualization for the
advancement of the field, and by the acknowledgment by the
academic community of the unprecedented rise in the use of
visuals (Meyer et al., 2013), we have provided a classifica-
tion of visualizations pitfalls. This contribution adds to the-
ory by aggregating the currently scattered knowledge on the
pitfalls of visual representation of information and can be
valuable for researchers in a number of domains from visual
literacy and graphic design to information visualization and
management. In particular, this work connects the different
domain of visualization around the central topic of visualiza-
tion negative effects.
10 SAGE Open
The errors made while creating or perceiving visualiza-
tions are not only aggregated and listed but also classified
into cognitive, emotional, and social negative effects: This
classification can thus act as a basis for the further systematic
investigation of visualizations' effects by providing a struc-
ture to guide work in visualization quality assessment.
It is also relevant to differentiate theoretically between
mistakes induced by the designer and the reader: It seems
particularly interesting to consider the mistakes in reading or
decoding visuals made by users to understand the boundaries
of visual representations' effectiveness.
The classification can be useful also for scholars in a vari-
ety of related disciplines including marketing, advertising,
film studies, photography, multimodal communication, and
journalism, among others.
Conclusion and Outlook
In this article, we have aimed to provide a first classification
of visualization pitfalls. We believe that an analytic and
comprehensive compilation of visualization pitfalls is crucial,
especially in the modern day context of the rising use of visu-
alization by non-experts, and because of the emergent use of
visualization in social media, the availability of new graphic
technologies, and new ways of generating and sharing pic-
tures. We have introduced a new classification of visualiza-
tion problems that can be used by visualization producers
(e.g., designers, analysts, software companies, statisticians,
consultancy companies, researchers, etc.) and in education
for increasing students' visual literacy, for both the produc-
tion and the critical interpretation of visualizations (Eppler,
2006).
The limitations of our work include the lack of scientific
testing for its comprehensiveness and usability. The next step
in this research is the testing of the schema, for instance,
through field experiments, comparing the performances of
designers and users in two conditions: participants who use
and participants who do not use the classification. We fore-
see that the current form of the classification can be subject
to ongoing revisions and additions. Furthermore, it would be

theoretically and pragmatically relevant to rank the pitfalls
according to how common or how severe they are: Scholars
could survey a sample of images to determine the occurrence
and severity of the pitfalls here identified. Many challenges
remain regarding the appropriate level of granularity of the
disadvantages, as well as how this can be taken into consid-
eration without excessively increasing the complexity of the
classification. Nevertheless, we believe that our categoriza-
tion is a first step toward a comprehensive formalization of
visualization risks, and that such work is needed to support
the information design, information visualization, and visual
communication community in developing valuable visual-
izations, and for the analytic assessment and measurement of
visualization quality. As Edward Tufte (1986, 1990, 1997)
has shown in his books, the world is filled with misleading,
unattractive, and confusing visualizations of information.
Strategies to avoid these pitfalls have not yet been compre-
hensively defined, and we hope that our first and provisional
classification is an initial step toward a more complete and
instructive analysis of the pitfalls of visualization.
Appendix
A Pragmatic Guide of Questions to Ask Regarding Visual Representation Pitfalls
Encoding (Designer-induced) Decoding (User-induced)
Cognitive The visualization may negatively affect the viewer's thinking The viewer may not get the meaning of the image
 Ambiguity: Can the visual be mistakenly interpreted in
different manners? Does it contain unlabeled arbitrary
symbols?
Breaking conventions: Does the visual break established
visual conventions (e.g., is time shown left to right)?
Confusion: Is the overall logic clear?
Cost to make explicit: Is it difficult/time-consuming for
users to make explicit the meaning of the visual?
Cryptic encoding: Is the format used to represent
information/knowledge universally understandable?
Defocused: Does the visual distract from the main
message?
Hiding/obscuring: Does the visual format hide actual data
(e.g., by changing a graph starting point)?
Inconsistency: Are symbols used consistently? For
example, Arrows should indicate either time or causality,
not both in the same graph.
Low accuracy: Does the visual present information in a
less accurate manner compared with tables or numbers?
Misleading/Distorting: Does the visual format lead to
wrong interpretations or conclusions?
Not respected gestalt principles: Are the Gestalt
principles respected (see Koffka, 1922)? For example, is it
clear which part of the visual is the background and which
is the foreground?
Over-determinism: Does the visual specify more
information than it should? For example, if the intending
meaning is "a person," is the visual unnecessarily specifying
the gender or ethnicity?
Over/under-reliability appearance: Is the visual
sketchy enough or polished enough for the intended
purpose? For example, if the aim is to discuss an idea,
is the visual appearing provisional enough to encourage
feedback?
Over-complexity: Is the visual depicting elements in a
more complex manner than necessary?
Over-simplification: does the visual leave out essential
information (maybe to simplify the message)?
Redundancy: is the same information presented more than
once in the same graph? For example, in a matrix are the
X and Y axes displaying the same criterion?
Change blindness: Look again at the picture paying
attention to the details: Do you notice any important
change in the pictures that you missed earlier?
 Channel thinking: Does the visual channel or direct your
thinking in an inappropriate direction?
 Depending on perceptual skills: Are you seeing a
picture differently from the average population due to
your physical or cultural background? For example, if you
are East Asians did you look primarily at the background?
If you are a Westerner, did you look only at the central
object?
 Difficult to understand: Do you find the image to be
hard to understand given your experience?
 Focus on low relevance items: Are you focusing on the
most relevant items of the image?
 High requirement on training and resources: Do
you have enough training or expertise to understand the
image?
 Knowledge of visual conventions: Are you familiar with
visual conventions (e.g., how to read maps, or which is
the expected reading pattern)?
 Misuse: are you interpreting and utilizing the image for a
task for which it was not intended?
 Overload: based on your experience do you feel that the
image has too many elements to be processed?
 Reification: are you mistakenly attributing properties of a
material object to a concept (e.g., when a visual metaphor
or diagram is used)? Are you treating an abstraction as if
it were a real thing because it is visualized?
 Wrong salience: Are you concentrating on the message
or are you being distracted by the tool or the visual
appearance?
 
 
 
 
 
(continued)
12 SAGE Open
Encoding (Designer-induced) Decoding (User-induced)
 Task-visualization fit: is the visual appropriate for
supporting the specific task?

 Technology/template driven: is the pre-defined template
or schema suitable for the task or message?

 Time-consuming to produce: Is it worth spending time
visualizing the information?

 Unclear: does the visual leave too much room for user's
interpretation of the message?

 Unevenness: Does the visual format constrain thought more
than necessary? For example, if a visual metaphor is utilized,
does it shape people thinking in a certain (unwanted) manner?

Emotional The visualization may cause inappropriate feelings in the viewer The viewer may suffer because of the image




Disturbing: Can the visual cause emotional harm to the
viewer because of its shocking content?
Boring: Is the visual banal and thus not able to attract the
attention of the viewer?
Ugly: Does the lack of aesthetics of the image reduce the
viewer's motivation to explore it?
Wrong use of color: Are colors used in adequate
combinations (see Duarte, 2008, chap. 7)? For example, are
red and green not used in the same image to differentiate
information (because they cannot be distinguished by people
with color deficiencies)? Is the image color combination
restricted enough not to create a childish rainbow effect?
Visual stress: Does the visual cause illness when viewing it
because of its patterns?
Personal likes and dislikes: Is the visual in line with your
preferences (in terms of colors, format, or design)?
Prior knowledge and experience: Does your previous
positive or experience with a visual influence the
willingness to use it?

Social The visualization may interfere with communication The viewer may be prone to miscommunication because of the
image
 Affordance conflict: Does the visual signal the wrong kind
of expected action to the viewer?
Hierarchy, exercise of power: Is the visualization used
politically to disincentive certain people from contributing
to the discussion (e.g., by making it too polished to invite
contributions)?
Inhibit conversation:When the visual is used, are
participants less outspoken (e.g., because their
contribution will be visualized publicly)?
Rhythm of freezing and unfreezing:Does the format or
appearance of the visualization make it appear too fixed
(or too provisional) for the specific task at hand?
Turn taking alteration: When a visual is used to guide a
group conversation, does the visual affect the natural turn
taking group behavior?
Unequal participation: When using a visual to facilitate
a conversation, do certain participants participate more
in the conversation (e.g., because they are more skilled in
modifying the visual)?
Altered behavior: Is the group interaction affected by the
use of the visual to facilitate the conversation?
 Cultural and cross-cultural differences: Depending
on the culture in which the visual was created, are
you interpreting the meaning of symbols and colors as
expected?
 Defocused from non-verbal interaction: When
using visualization in a group, are you focusing too
much of your attention on the visual at the expenses of
participants' body language and gestures?
 Different perspectives: Are all people looking at
the picture in the same manner (e.g., focusing on the
same aspects, based on their organizational level or job)?
 Hiding differences of opinion: When a visual is
developed in a group context, are differences of opinion
hidden for the need to find a common representation of
the discussed topics?
 Recency effect: Is your interpretation of the visual biased
by your recent experience?
 Time-consuming to agree: When a visual is used in
collaborative settings, is it taking more time to agree on
the content, compared with a purely verbal discussion?
