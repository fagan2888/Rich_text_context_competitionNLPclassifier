From First Drug Use to Drug Dependence:
Developmental Periods of Risk for
Dependence upon Marijuana,
Cocaine, and Alcohol
Fernando A. Wagner, Sc.D., and James C. Anthony, Ph.D.
The focal point of this paper is the transition from drug use to
drug dependence. We present new evidence on risk for
starting to use marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol, as well as
risks for progression from first drug use to the onset of drug
dependence, separately for each of these drugs. Data from the
National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) were analyzed. The
NCS had a representative sample of the United States
population ages 15­54 years (n  8,098). Survival analysis
techniques were used to provide age- and time-specific risk
estimates of initiating use of marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol,
as well as of becoming dependent on each drug. With respect
to risk of initiating use, estimated peak values for alcohol and
marijuana were found at age 18, about two years earlier than
the later peak in risk of initiating cocaine use. With respect to
risk of meeting criteria for the clinical dependence syndrome,
estimated peak values for alcohol and marijuana were found
at age 17­18. Peak values for cocaine dependence were found
at age 23­25. Once use began, cocaine dependence emerged
early and more explosively, with an estimated 5­6% of
cocaine users becoming cocaine dependent in the first year of
use. Most of the observed cases of cocaine dependence met
criteria for dependence within three years after initial cocaine
use. Whereas some 15­16% of cocaine users had developed
cocaine dependence within 10 years of first cocaine use, the
corresponding values were about 8% for marijuana users,
and 12­13% for alcohol users. The most novel findings of
this study document a noteworthy risk for quickly developing
cocaine dependence after initial cocaine use, with about one
in 16 to 20 cocaine users becoming dependent within the first
year of cocaine use. For marijuana and alcohol, there is a
more insidious onset of the drug dependence syndrome.

In an earlier report of evidence from the National Comor-
bidity Survey, our research group described some interest-
ing features about the comparative epidemiology of drug
dependence. For example, as a summary population aver-
age value for the estimated millions of Americans age 15­
54 years who had tried cocaine at least one time by the
early 1990s, about one in six had become dependent upon
cocaine (about 16­17%). Among persons who had tried

marijuana at least one time, about one in 11 had become
dependent upon it (about 9%). By comparison, among per-
sons who had tried alcoholic beverages at least once, about
one in 6 or 7, or 15%, had become alcohol dependent (An-
thony et al. 1994). In the present study, we extend this look
at the comparative epidemiology of drug dependence, but
here our focus is upon estimation of the age-specific and
time-specific risks of progression from first drug use to de-
pendence, separately for marijuana, cocaine, and (for com-
parison) alcoholic beverages (hereinafter, `alcohol').
Prior studies have conveyed estimates of age-specific
risk for first alcohol use and alcohol dependence, as
well as risk estimates for initiation of illicit use and de-
pendence on controlled drugs in general (e.g., Kandel
and Logan 1984; Eaton et al. 1989; Warner et al. 1995;
Chen and Kandel 1995; Johnson and Gerstein 1998;
Perkonigg et al. 1999; DeWit et al. 2000). The role of
early onset of drug use and progression to initial and
problematic use of other drugs also has been studied in
some detail (e.g., Kandel 1985; Anthony and Petronis
1995; Grant 1998; Grant and Dawson 1998). However,
what is especially novel about the present study is its
new look at both the cumulative and instantaneous risk
of drug dependence in relation to time elapsed since
first use of marijuana and cocaine, with alcohol for
comparison.
Whereas epidemiological studies of this type gener-
ally are regarded as valid sources of evidence, it is pos-
sible that some critics might call into question the valid-
ity or reliability of drug dependence assessments
obtained in large-sample survey research as compared
with what can be obtained via intensive clinical study
of smaller samples (e.g., see Anthony et al. 1985; Brugha
et al. 1999). Nonetheless, at least with respect to the
drug dependence syndromes, recent empirical research
provides evidence that epidemiologic studies can and
do provide generally valid and reliable estimates of the
occurrence of these conditions, as well as their corre-
sponding ages of onset (e.g., see Prusoff et al. 1988; Lan-
genbucher et al. 1994; Shillington et al. 1995; Wittchen
et al. 1989, 1998, 1999; Shillington and Clapp 2000). In
addition, the types of survival analysis we have per-
formed with respect to drug dependence in the present
study have many analogs in studies that other research
teams have completed with respect to psychiatric dis-
turbances outside the realm of drug dependence (Bres-
lau and Klein 1999; Prescott and Kendler 1999; Horwath
and Weissman 2000; Kessler et al. 2001).
In this paper, we study the risk of transition from
first drug use to drug dependence using two measures
of risk: the "cumulative probability" and the "instanta-
neous" hazard or time-specific risk of an event. De-
scribed briefly, the cumulative probability for an event
is the proportion of individuals in a population who ex-
perience the event up to or through a specified time
point or interval (e.g., the accumulated probability of
having initiated marijuana use by age 17). In contrast,
the instantaneous hazard or risk refers to the probabil-
ity of event occurrence within a particular interval of
time, given no prior event occurrence (Willet and
Singer 1993). In the latter, the risk of becoming depen-
dent on cocaine at age 25 is the proportion of respon-
dents who become dependent while age 25, among
those who had not become cocaine dependent up to
that age. As defined, these estimates summarize the ex-
perience of all persons in the study population.
So that the results of this study might be compared
with similar epidemiological evidence about other
mental and behavioral disturbances (e.g., major depres-
sion), we have depicted the risk of developing drug de-
pendence in two ways. First, we estimate the risk of de-
pendence on marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol for all
persons in the study population, without regard to their
use of each drug. The resulting curves are directly com-
parable to those that depict the developmental periods
of risk for major depression or other psychiatric distur-
bances (e.g., as offered by Eaton et al. 1989). Second, we
restrict the analyses to individuals who have used each
drug on at least one occasion, and we re-estimate the
risk of becoming drug dependent for every year after
first drug use. These results are more akin to post-expo-
sure induction or latency periods of risk, once a discrete
exposure has occurred. DeWit and colleagues (2000)
have presented similar evidence on alcohol, based upon
a survey in Canada, but made no attempt to compare
the experience of alcohol consumers with the experi-
ence of marijuana and cocaine users.
Evidence about the post-exposure periods of risk is
crucial whenever we seek to understand the epidemiol-
ogy of conditions for which a discrete exposure is re-
quired, whether the exposure involves an infection, a
toxin or a drug, irradiation, or a traumatic life event.
For this reason, in this paper we also show estimates on
the developmental periods of risk for first exposure,
measured as the age at which individuals start to use
marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol.
METHODS
The data for this study were gathered for the National
Comorbidity Survey (NCS). Detailed descriptions of
the NCS and its procedures for assessing drug depen-
dence are provided elsewhere (Anthony et al. 1994;
Kessler et al. 1994; Warner et al. 1995). In brief, the
study sample is a stratified multistage area probability
sample of community residents age 15 to 54 years in the
nonistitutionalized civilian population of the 48 cote-
rminous United States, and a supplemental sample rep-
resentative of students living in campus group housing.
Carefully trained interviewers collected the data under
close monitoring. The NCS achieved an 82.4% response
NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY 2002­VOL. 26, NO. 4 From First Drug Use to Drug Dependence 481
rate, with 8,098 participants. This paper, and the NCS,
fully comply with the Declaration of Helsinki and with
research ethics regulations adopted and promulgated
by the National Institutes of Health.
Data on illicit drug use and alcohol were obtained
via standardized questions adapted from the National
Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) and the
Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), a
structured diagnostic instrument administered by
trained interviewers (Robins et al. 1988; U.S. Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services 1993). Respon-
dents were asked the age at which they used each drug
for the first time. In addition, for each drug, respon-
dents were asked whether they had a particular prob-
lem or group of problems, and the age when problems
started. Regrettably, for tobacco use, the questions
asked for the age at which the respondent started to use
tobacco daily for a month. For this reason, it is not possi-
ble to study transitions from first tobacco use to depen-
dence in any detail. For many tobacco smokers, daily
smoking is a manifestation of tobacco dependence. In
addition, there were neither detailed questions about
routes of administration nor about separate dosage
forms (powder cocaine HCl, crack, hash oil); hence, this
study's estimates are averaged summary values across
all dosage forms and routes of administration.
Drug use initiation was made operational in relation
to each respondent's answers to the standardized sur-
vey question about the age at first use of each drug.
Drug dependence was assessed according to the Diag-
nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Re-
vised Third Edition, DSM-III-R diagnosis criteria
(American Psychiatric Association 1987), as made oper-
ational in the University of Michigan version of the
CIDI (UM-CIDI) described by Kessler et al. (1994). In
order to qualify for drug dependence, the respondent
had to report at least three separate manifestations of
dependence. The UM-CIDI assesses a range of clinical
features characteristic of drug withdrawal syndromes,
as well as behavioral manifestations of dependence
such as unsuccessful attempts to stop or cut down drug
use, continued use of drugs despite recognition of re-
lated physical, psychological and social problems, and
role performance impairment. Final diagnoses for this
study were derived via the CIDI algorithm and associ-
ated diagnostic computer programs, as were used in
the original NCS reports on drug dependence (World
Health Organization 1990; Cottler et al. 1991; Anthony
et al. 1994).
Appropriate statistical survey methods were used to
account for the complex survey design, such as cluster-
ing of respondents by sampling strata and unequal
probability of selection into the NCS sample. Survival
analysis methods were used to estimate the cumulative
probability of first marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol use.
We then estimated the risk for onset of use for each
drug, that is, the risk of first marijuana, cocaine, and al-
cohol use during a specified year, given no history of
using that drug up to that time interval. In these analy-
ses, age is expressed in terms of years since birth.
All survival analyses were performed using the
STATA software (Stata Corp. 1999), and included Ka-
plan-Meier estimates of the cumulative probability of
progression from first use to dependence on each drug.
For these analyses, we applied two developmental per-
spectives: (1) time was measured chronologically in
years since birth; (2) thereafter, the time scale was set as
years since first use of each drug. To enhance the graph-
ical display of the estimated risk, we used non-para-
metric smoothing techniques such as a median kernel
smoother with cubic splines.
Interpretation of evidence from survival analysis re-
quires answers to the following questions: (1) What is
the origin for the X axis? (2) What is the time scale along
the X axis? (3) What is the outcome event under investi-
gation? (4) What is the survival analysis estimate de-
picted on the Y axis? and (5) Are there any noteworthy
restrictions? In this study: (1) The origin first is speci-
fied as the birth year; next, it is specified as age at first
use of each drug. (2) The time scale is years of life. (3)
The outcome of interest is first occurrence of the depen-
dence syndrome (i.e., age at which the full set of criteria
for dependence first were met). (4) The survival analy-
sis estimates are (a) cumulative probability, and (b) age-
or time-specific risk of dependence upon each drug. (5)
In the analyses of risk among users, the non-users have
been excluded; otherwise, there are neither restrictions
nor exclusions from the NCS sample.
Traditional test statistics such as the 2 or t-test could
not be used to test for drug-related differences in the
risk of developing dependence due to the lack of inde-
pendence across responses (i.e., dependence on one
drug being correlated with dependence on another
drug). To address this issue, multivariate response pro-
file analyses were implemented via Generalized Esti-
mating Equations (GEE); the GEE robust p-values are
based on methods that take into account the multiple
intercorrelated responses (Liang and Zeger 1986; An-
drade et al. 1994; Diggle et al. 1995).
RESULTS
Figure 1 depicts the estimated age-specific risk for first
use of marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol as a function of
years since birth, with the estimates based upon data
from 3,940 marijuana users, 1,337 cocaine users, and
7,485 alcohol users in the total NCS sample of 8,098 re-
spondents. The peak risk for initiation of drug use was
estimated to occur at age 18 years for marijuana and al-
cohol, with peak risk for cocaine two years later (Figure
1). When studied in comparison with values for mari-
482 F.A. Wagner and J.C. Anthony NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY 2002­VOL. 26, NO. 4
juana and cocaine, the estimated risk for initiating alco-
hol use is seen to have higher values, with earlier occur-
rence, and is spread over a longer age span. An
additional feature of the data is the very small risk
value for ages beyond 25 years: it has been very uncom-
mon for Americans to start the use of these drugs in the
later years of life, as noted elsewhere (Anthony and
Helzer 1995; Chen and Kandel 1995). The developmen-
tal period of risk for starting to use marijuana, cocaine,
and alcohol is effectively completed by age 35­50 years.
Figure 2 shifts emphasis from initial drug use to the
onset of drug dependence, and depicts the estimated
risk for developing dependence upon marijuana, co-
caine, and alcohol, reflecting the experience of all per-
sons in the population so that developmental periods of
risk for drug dependence might be compared with sep-
arately published periods of risk for developing major
depression and other psychiatric disturbances. Here,
the denominator of `at risk' experience is defined in re-
lation to all people, without respect to their history of
drug-taking, and the numerator included 354 cases of
marijuana dependence, 220 cases of cocaine depen-
dence, and 1,212 cases of alcohol dependence in the to-
tal sample of 8,098 respondents. The highest risk value
is observed for dependence on alcohol at about age 20­
21 years; the peak risk value for marijuana dependence
appears slightly earlier, at about 17 years. The esti-
mated peak risk value for cocaine dependence occurred
some seven years later, at about age 24­26 years. For
marijuana dependence, the developmental period of
risk has virtually ended by age 30 years; very few cases
arise after this age. Not so with respect to cocaine de-
pendence, for which the period of risk extends to just
past age 35 years. However, new cases of alcohol de-
pendence are observed to arise through the middle
years of adult life, as observed elsewhere (e.g., see
Eaton et al. 1989).
Table 1 shifts focus to the experience of drug users,
and shows the estimated cumulative probability of
meeting criteria for dependence, among users of mari-
juana, cocaine, and alcohol, for specified age intervals.
For those who used marijuana at least once, the esti-
mated cumulative probability of becoming dependent
on marijuana by age 54 was 10% (95% CI, 9.0­11.1%).
Most cases of dependence on marijuana occurred when
users were age 15­25 years old. In fact, the cumulative
probability of developing dependence on marijuana re-
mained below 1% to age 14 years among users, but in-
creased sharply in the following 15 years and climbed
to 9% by age 30 years. On the other hand, among per-
sons who had used cocaine, the cumulative probability
of cocaine dependence by age 45 years was estimated to
be 21% (95% CI, 18.4­24.5%). The greatest increases in
the estimated cumulative probability of cocaine depen-
dence are seen to occur between ages 15 to 30, growing
from roughly 1% to 18% during this period, thereafter
with modest growth at lower rates. Starting from age 20
onward, the cumulative probability estimates for de-
pendence on cocaine exceeded values observed for de-
pendence on marijuana during the same developmental
interval. With respect to people who had used alcohol
at least once, the estimated cumulative probability of al-
cohol dependence by age of 55 years was about 20%
(95% CI, 18.6­21.1%). Most cases met criteria for depen-
dence on alcohol between ages 15 and 35 years.
Like Figure 2, Figure 3 presents a graphical display
of the developmental periods of risk for becoming de-
pendent upon marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol, but it
differs from Figure 2 in an important respect: Figure 3

val that separates one age stratum from the next age stratum.

conveys the experience of drug users only. When each
study base is restricted to persons who have used each
drug, the risk for cocaine dependence peaks at age 23­
25 years, somewhat later than estimated peaks for alco-
hol and marijuana dependence, which take place dur-
ing the teen years.
Figure 4 and its inset figure depict the estimated risk
of developing dependence, with a restriction to users of
each drug, and with a time scale that is set as years
elapsed since first drug use. The X-axes for the larger
figure and for the inset figure express number of years
since first use, but each Y axis depicts a different aspect
of the epidemiology of drug dependence. The Y axis in
the larger figure depicts the estimated drug-specific cu-
mulative probability of meeting dependence criteria
among individuals who had used each drug, by
elapsed time since first drug use. In contrast, the inset
figure depicts the estimated instantaneous or time-specific
risk of meeting dependence criteria for the first time.
Whereas values in the larger figure grow to show how
the estimated probability of becoming dependent accu-
mulates over time since the start of each drug user's ca-
reer of use, the inset figure shows the risk of becoming
dependent during each year since first use among those
who remained non-dependent to that year. While the
X-axes in both figures depict time elapsed since first
use, this does not mean that the use of the drug has fol-
lowed a specific pattern. As mentioned in the methods
section, no information is available to assess variation
in the dosages used over time and their relation to the
risk of becoming dependent on each drug. For example,
it is possible that a respondent had a first cocaine use
and continued using cocaine for one year without be-
coming dependent, stopped using cocaine for three
years, and then resumed cocaine use in a more intense
fashion that led him or her to meet full criteria of de-
pendence. The NCS data and the following analyses do
not allow disclosure of such differences in patterns of
drug involvement.
As reflected in both the larger figure and the inset,
there is continuing risk for experiencing cocaine depen-
dence a decade or more after initial cocaine use. Both the
larger figure and the inset show less explosive develop-
ment of marijuana dependence among marijuana users.
Whereas some 15­16% of cocaine users had developed
cocaine dependence within 10 years of first cocaine use,
the corresponding values are about 8% for marijuana us-
ers, and 12­13% for alcohol users (Figure 4).
Figure 4's inset clarifies that the emergence of mari-
juana and alcohol dependence is at roughly similar mag-
nitudes for the first few years after initial use of these
drugs. Thereafter, cases of alcohol dependence continue
to accumulate, but the risk of developing marijuana de-
pendence drops off, perhaps because illicit drug use
tends to be a more transient experience than alcohol use.
Some 10 years after first marijuana use, the instantaneous

risk of becoming marijuana dependent has reached val-
ues near zero and there is no more accumulation of new
cases. The estimated instantaneous risk of meeting crite-
ria for alcohol dependence is about one percent per year;
new cases continue to mount (Figure 4, inset).
The inset figure within Figure 4 shows that cocaine
dependence emerges quite early and explosively in the
initial years after first cocaine use; most of the observed
cases of cocaine dependence met criteria for depen-
dence within 1­3 years after initial cocaine use. An esti-
mated 5.5% of cocaine users developed cocaine depen-
dence within the first year of use; a corresponding
estimate of 2.5­3.0% was observed for the period from
1­3 years after initial cocaine use. Thereafter, the esti-
mated instantaneous risk of cocaine dependence drops
to about 1.5%, and subsequently to values between one-
half and one percent, or lower. Some years after first co-
caine use, the estimated instantaneous risk of cocaine
dependence generally is intermediate between the val-
ues reported for marijuana and alcohol.
During the initial year of use of marijuana, cocaine,
and alcohol, cocaine users were found to be about two
times more likely to develop cocaine dependence, com-
pared with the risk of alcohol dependence among alco-
hol users (odds ratio, OR,  1.90; 95% CI, 1.12­2.22;
GEE robust p  .018). In contrast, during the first year
of marijuana use, the risk of meeting criteria for mari-
juana dependence was not found to differ from the risk
of alcohol dependence (OR  1.04, 95% CI, 0.60­0.81;
GEE robust p  .88).
DISCUSSION
This report offers novel evidence about age- and time-
related developmental periods of risk for first drug use
and first drug dependence in the United States. It is of
interest that the risk for cocaine dependence among co-
caine users develops more explosively than the risk of
dependence among marijuana or alcohol users, as con-
firmed in GEE multivariate response profile analyses
that took into account the statistical interdependencies
of our three response variables. The risk of becoming al-
cohol dependent persists for decades after first alcohol
use, whereas there appears to be a shorter developmen-
tal period of risk for marijuana use and perhaps also for
cocaine use.
In order to appreciate this study's new empirical evi-
dence on the comparative epidemiology of cocaine,
marijuana, and alcohol, or to discuss the findings in de-
tail, readers may wish to know more about the study's
limitations. Population estimates of this type necessar-
ily require the use of survey research methods, with at-
tendant difficulties such as restriction of range to
household residents and the exclusion of homeless and
incarcerated individuals. Nevertheless, as illustrated in
the Epidemiologic Catchment Area studies, overall
population estimates for drug dependence do not tend
to change substantially when the experiences of non-
household residents are taken into account, except per-
haps when there is a specific focus on inner city popula-
tions. This is because the size of the U.S. household
population is much larger than the size of the non-
household population, and a large fraction of the popu-
lation lives outside of the inner city (e.g., see Anthony
and Helzer 1991).
Another limitation involves the assessment of clini-
cal syndromes of drug dependence and determination
of the ages at first drug use and first drug problems;
there is no bioassay for these syndromes nor for first
drug use. These circumstances necessitate reliance
upon self-reported information. As such, these assess-
ments are subject to all of the potential errors and biases
NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY 2002­VOL. 26, NO. 4 From First Drug Use to Drug Dependence 485
of recall and reporting that have been described in de-
tail elsewhere (e.g., see Anthony et al. 1985, 2000). Of
particular concern is that events studied might have
taken place some years before the NCS interviews were
conducted. In this context, accurate recall sometimes
represents a challenging cognitive task for both the
young and older adults. Nonetheless, during the years
of young and middle adulthood, it appears that age at
first use of illicit drugs is reported with reasonably high
coefficients of agreement (Prusoff et al. 1988; Wittchen
et al. 1989; Labouvie et al. 1997; Shillington and Clapp
2000). The NCS used a variety of measures to reduce
bias and to promote the respondent's commitment to
telling the truth, but the cost of portable computer-as-
sisted self-interviewing and programming was deemed
prohibitive at that time. Hence, we acknowledge a po-
tential limitation that can be overcome in future sur-
veys, which might show greater (or earlier) risks for
starting to use drugs and for becoming drug depen-
dent, to the extent that computer-assisted self-inter-
viewing promotes more complete and accurate report-
ing of illicit and sensitive matters (e.g., see Lessler and
O'Reilly 1997; Turner et al. 1998).
Another set of inter-related limitations involves the
question of reliability and validity of the National Co-
morbidity Survey diagnoses, already mentioned in our
introduction to this paper. This set of limitations has
been discussed quite thoroughly in past NCS papers
published in the Archives of General Psychiatry and else-
where (e.g., see Kessler et al. 1994, 1997; Anthony et al.
1994; Warner et al. 1995; Kessler and Mroczek 1996;
Wittchen 1996; Hasin et al. 1997; Pull et al. 1997; Lach-
ner et al. 1998; Wittchen et al. 1999). Here, we would
like to add a note of clarification: large-sample epidemi-
ological studies do not provide the same context for
studies of reliability and validity as one can create in a
smaller sample study where there might be multiple
opportunities for repeated assessment and increasingly
detailed diagnostic cross-examination. For large-sam-
ple epidemiological research, the research team gener-
ally must knock on doors of randomly selected house-
holds, and then follow disclosure and informed consent
procedures required to recruit a randomly selected
household member for the 1­2 h diagnostic assessment.
Even when the sampled community residents are will-
ing to complete an initial 1­2 h diagnostic assessment,
many of them are not willing to repeat the assessment
for the purposes of a reliability or validity study. Fur-
thermore, the participants willing to share more of their
time and effort for repeat assessments generally may
not be regarded as a random or representative sample
of all participants, and there is considerable uncertainty
about whether resulting reliability and validity esti-
mates actually hold for the population under study
(e.g., see Anthony et al. 1985; Wittchen et al. 1999). For
this reason, there are no definitive estimates of reliabil-
ity or validity of the NCS drug dependence diagnoses
that are based on thorough standardized clinical direct
examination and re-appraisal of a proper random sam-
ple of the NCS participants. It is necessary to turn to re-
liability and validity estimates from separately con-
ducted methodological studies in order to see that our
standardized drug dependence diagnoses in survey re-
search generally have substantially better reliability
and validity than the corresponding survey research di-
agnoses for other DSM Axis I disorder categories (e.g.,
see Anthony et al. 1985; Janca et al. 1992; Shillington et
al. 1995).
Some readers might not be aware of `sample space'
constraints upon the evidence; we must confess that
these observed values characterize experiences in the
U.S. household population during the last several de-
cades of the 20th century, and might have no generaliz-
ability to other people, other places, or other times. For
instance, the sampling scheme for the NCS did not in-
clude members of the population 55 years or over;
therefore, our analyses are not informative about the
risk of dependence on alcohol or other drugs for older
segments of the population. Based upon prospective
evidence from the NIMH Epidemiologic Catchment
Area research and other studies, the risk of developing
dependence on alcohol and other substances for the
first time after age 55 is quite low (e.g., Eaton et al.
1989), and the risk of starting to use marijuana or co-
caine after age 55 is vanishingly small (e.g., Anthony
and Helzer 1995). Hence, it is most likely that our study
estimates would not be altered to any great extent if
older respondents had been included within the NCS
epidemiological sampling frame.
The rate of transition from non-use to use and the
rate of transition from use to dependence are not fixed
pharmacological properties of cocaine, marijuana, or al-
cohol, and relatively little is known about `laws of epi-
demiology' that govern matters such as these. Unless
experimental laboratory studies have been misleading,
the transition rates experienced by community-dwell-
ing drug users are likely to have multiple determinants
such as `host' characteristics, as well as local variation
in availability of each drug, prevailing routes of admin-
istration, dosage forms, and daily doses. For example,
past and recent studies show that early onset of drug
use is a predictor of subsequent development of drug-
related problems (Anthony and Petronis 1995; Grant
1998; Grant and Dawson 1998; Hanna and Grant 1999),
and evidence from DeWit et al. (2000) links earlier onset
of alcohol use to greater cumulative risk of developing
alcohol dependence, while Obot et al. (2001) have
found that children of alcohol dependent parents are
more likely to be early onset users of alcohol and other
drugs. In addition, recent epidemiological evidence
converges with clinical and laboratory evidence in sup-
port of the idea that general repertoires of behavior
486 F.A. Wagner and J.C. Anthony NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY 2002­VOL. 26, NO. 4
might displace or prevent drug use (Johanson et al.
1996). If so, the above-mentioned circumstances of envi-
ronment and behavior are among the conditions and
processes that govern the transition rates. Elsewhere,
we have speculated and offered epidemiological evi-
dence that features of the neighborhood and work envi-
ronment impinge on risk of alcohol and drug use and
dependence, in addition to vulnerabilities linked with
psychiatric and behavioral disturbances such as mood
disorders and antisocial personality disorder, with so-
cial status, and with male sex (e.g., see Crum et al. 1995,
1996; Muntaner et al. 1995; Petronis and Anthony 2000;
Ritter and Anthony 1991; Anthony 1991; Crum et al.
1998; Anthony et al. 1994). Recent evidence from ge-
netic epidemiology confirms the role of inherited pre-
dispositions toward drug-taking and toward drug de-
pendence, once drug use begins, apparently more so for
men than for women (e.g., see Pickens et al. 1991; Lyons
et al. 1997; True et al. 1999; Tsuang et al. 1999; Kendler
et al. 2000; Xian et al. 2000).
The estimates of this study, and from prior popula-
tion studies of this type (e.g., Kandel and Logan 1984;
Eaton et al. 1989; DeWit et al. 1997, 2000), represent pop-
ulation averages over the experiences of all individuals
in the study populations, including the higher and lower
risk subgroups delineated in the aforementioned stud-
ies. As such, these estimates have some utility in clinical
practice and in research, akin to the utility of other aver-
aged values. These are `population norms' that clinicians
may use on a daily basis to guide decision-making about
the care and management of individual patients, that
public health workers can use to make decisions about
appropriate timing of prevention activities, and that sci-
entists may apply in planning for their future studies.
In future research, it should be possible to examine
these subgroup variations and markers of individual
vulnerability in more detail. In the past, most attention
in etiologic research on drug dependence has been
fixed upon risks of first drug use or first appearance of
drug dependence. The perspective advanced in this pa-
per is one that encourages greater attention to the tim-
ing of the transitions from first drug use to develop-
ment of drug dependence.
One clear application of this shift in perspective in-
volves genetically oriented twin studies. For the most
part, twin studies of drug dependence have sorted the
twin pairs into two groups: pairs that are discordant for
occurrence of drug dependence (one twin `positive' and
one twin `negative') versus pairs that are concordant
(both twins `positive' or both twins `negative'). Instead,
twin studies can re-define concordance with respect to
the time elapsed from first drug use to first drug depen-
dence (or first drug problem). Twins with exactly the
same elapsed time from first drug use to first depen-
dence are concordant; otherwise, they are discordant.
One advantage of this analytical approach to defining
concordance and discordance is to increase the number
of `discordant' twin pairs, with increasing precision of
study estimates and statistical power to detect environ-
mental influences upon vulnerability to drug depen-
dence. Determinants of lag time from first use to each
drug to first dependence may become an issue in twin
studies and other research on etiology of drug depen-
dence, just as `rapid' or slower transition from drug ex-
posure opportunities to actual first use has become an
issue for research on the causes of initial drug involve-
ment (e.g., see Van Etten and Anthony 1999; Wagner
and Anthony 2001).
In conclusion, estimates from this national survey
represent novel evidence concerning the drug-taking
experiences of the U.S. population. Analyses of time
elapsed from first drug use to first drug dependence
shed new light on these experiences. Directions for fu-
ture research include more careful study of sub-group
variation in the average values reported in this paper,
such as clarification of the mechanisms by which earlier
onset of drug use is associated with later increased risk
of drug dependence problems.
