Abstract
Background: Emerging evidence suggests that nonmedical use (NMU) of prescription attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications is rising, but many previous investigations have
used clinical or regionally based samples or limited their investigations to stimulants rather than to
medications specifically used to treat ADHD. Using an Internet-based epidemiological survey, this
paper advances understanding of the prevalence and correlates of NMU of medications used to
treat ADHD, sources of diverted medications, motivations for use, and consumption patterns.
Methods: The study used a self-administered Internet survey of civilian, noninstitutionalized adults
(N = 4,297) aged 18 to 49 in the United States. National-level estimates were created using
propensity scoring methods and weighting procedures using data from three nationally
representative probability surveys: a random-digit dialed telephone survey, the current U.S.
Census, and the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH).
Results: Past-year prevalence of NMU of ADHD medications was approximately 2%, with 4.3%
reported among those aged 18 to 25 and 1.3% among those aged 26 to 49. Most respondents
reporting NMU used on multiple occasions. Receipt of medications for ADHD was a significant
correlate of past-year NMU, though most nonmedical users never had a prescription. Among
persons who had never been prescribed medication to treat ADHD, friends or family members
were the most common source. Productivity was the most frequently endorsed reason for NMU.
Alcohol was the substance most commonly used in combination with ADHD drugs.
Conclusion: Because most prescription ADHD medications currently are highly regulated, policy
options for supply-side reduction of nonmedical use may include identifying those medications with
lower abuse liability for inclusion on insurance formularies. Patient and physician education
programs also may be useful tools to heighten awareness of intentional and unintentional diversion
of ADHD medications for nonmedical purposes.

Background
Clinician awareness of the presence and burden of atten-
tion deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has increased
in the United States and internationally [1-4]. In parallel,
prescribing of medication for ADHD has increased over
the past several years, particularly for adults [5,6]. Thus,
the number of youth and adult patients receiving pharma-
cologic ADHD treatment is growing, and treatment
includes a diverse range of stimulant and nonstimulant
medications. As the number of prescriptions increases, the
availability of these medications for diversion to nonmed-
ical use (NMU) also increases.
What is largely known about NMU of ADHD drugs is
derived from data sources that may not focus specifically
on ADHD medications or from samples with limited gen-
eralizability. Most of these investigations have grouped a
variety of prescription stimulants (e.g., methampheta-
mine, ADHD medications, anorectic drugs) as a broad
therapeutic class. A study that specifically identified the
NMU of prescription ADHD stimulants was conducted by
Kroutil and colleagues in 2006 using the 2002 National
Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) [7]. Except for
methamphetamine, however, the 2002 NSDUH asked
about NMU of specific stimulants only for the lifetime
period. Therefore, measurement of past-year NMU of
ADHD stimulants in the study was limited to persons who
had never used any other types of stimulant nonmedi-
cally. Based on these data, the past-year prevalence of
NMU of only ADHD stimulants was higher among young
adults aged 18 to 25 (1.3%) than among persons aged 12
to 17 (0.9%) or persons aged 26 or older (0.1%). The
demographic correlates also differed between stimulants
in general and ADHD stimulants. This suggests that infor-
mation about NMU of prescription stimulants may not be
applicable to NMU of ADHD-specific medications. How-
ever, limiting measurement of past-year NMU of ADHD
drugs to persons who exclusively misused these medica-
tions likely underestimated the true population preva-
lence, as it would have excluded persons who were
nonmedical users (NMUs) of both ADHD stimulants and
other stimulants in the past year. Further, NSDUH cap-
tures information on only a small subset of stimulant
medications used to treat ADHD and excludes the newer
classes of nonstimulant ADHD medications. Even for
ADHD medications that are considered to have lower
abuse potential, information about their use outside of
medical supervision or in doses exceeding a treatment reg-
imen would constitute problematic use due to potential
side effects or drug interactions.
Other studies have observed higher rates of stimulant mis-
use among those aged 18 to 25, college students, and
polydrug users [8-11]. Past studies examining polydrug
use typically define use of multiple drugs based on a sum-
mary of the number of different substances used at any
time in the past year. One notable exception that exam-
ined the co-occurrence of use of multiple substances was
a study conducted by McCabe and colleagues [11]. How-
ever, the sample was limited to college students at a single
university, and only the co-occurrence between alcohol
and prescription medications, including stimulants, was
investigated. More specific information is needed about
consumption patterns using a more diverse sample to
examine whether users are combining multiple drugs
within a single drug-using episode, and if so, which drugs
are used together with ADHD medications. This is signifi-
cant given the potential adverse health risks associated
with particular drug combinations involving ADHD med-
ications [12].
Compared to studies examining the prevalence and corre-
lates of nonmedical ADHD drug use, fewer studies have
specifically examined dimensions of access and motiva-
tion for NMU of ADHD medications. McCabe et al. [13]
reported that in a sample of middle and high school stu-
dents in the Midwest, over 23% of those with a prescrip-
tion for an ADHD medication were approached to sell,
trade, or give away their medications. This finding is con-
firmed in the 2005 NSDUH, which found that most per-
sons who used prescription stimulants (excluding
methamphetamine) nonmedically in the past year
received them from friends or relatives for free [14]. Some
studies have examined associations between NMU and
psychological factors, including ADHD status [15,16] to
identify possible motivations for use. For example, a clin-
ical case-control study by Wilens and colleagues [17]
based on ADHD diagnosis (N = 186) found that 36% of
the sample reported use for self-medication, 25% used
ADHD medications to get high, and 39% had unknown
motivation. A community-based study at a single univer-
sity found that nearly 25% of those with ADHD reported
use of their medications for recreational purposes [18].
Yet, much of the literature points to NMU of prescription
stimulants for performance enhancement. Teter et al.
[19], in a study at a large, midwestern university, found
that prescription stimulants were used primarily for per-
formance enhancement, although use for feelings of
euphoria (e.g., getting high) also was noted. These studies,
while primarily limited to regional populations, suggest
that peers are a common source of diverted medications
and that performance enhancement or self-medication
are important motivations for NMU.
Some of these investigations used large, epidemiological
surveillance systems (e.g., NSDUH) that offer considera-
ble breadth but may lack sufficient depth for examining,
in detail, more focused topics such as NMU of ADHD
medications. In contrast, a small but insightful number of
investigations focusing on patterns of diversion and moti-

vation for NMU of ADHD medications have relied on
small, regionally based or clinical samples [20,21]. The
costs and resources needed to recruit a sample large
enough to support reliable estimates of NMU of ADHD
medications could be an important barrier to designing
new national-level and international-level studies with
specific foci on ADHD medication NMU and diversion.
Internet surveys have emerged as an alternative data col-
lection method when in-person or telephone surveys
could be costly or time-consuming. Berrens et al. [22] list
several features of Internet surveys that make this design
well-suited for a study of diverted ADHD medication use,
including (1) low marginal costs because no interviewer
labor is involved in screening or interviewing, (2) the abil-
ity to use visual cues (e.g., pictures of medications) via the
Web to aid respondent recall, (3) rapid assembly of sam-
ples, and (4) rapid data collection from respondents with
less prevalent characteristics of interest [7,23]. Concerns
that have been cited about some Internet surveys focus on
the use of nonprobability samples [24]. However, these
concerns may be partly offset by an increased level of
access to the Internet by a broader range of socioeconomic
and demographic groups, particularly younger adults
[25,26], a subpopulation with higher rates of NMU of pre-
scription drugs. Internet recruitment can use a probability
sample to select respondents who then complete the inter-
view via a Web-based data collection system. However,
Internet market research panels have emerged as an ave-
nue for recruitment because a sample may be drawn from
a preexisting opt-in panel of possible respondents that
have agreed to complete regular online surveys. In this
regard, "opt-in panel" refers to a group of respondents
that have agreed to participate in multiple surveys, rather
than a single group of participants in a longitudinal study.
Two techniques that also have been used to increase the
confidence in findings from this approach include tar-
geted recruitment based on known demographic charac-
teristics of panel participants and use of propensity
weighting methods to approximate the results that would
have been obtained from a probability-based survey [27].
Yet, Internet panel data should be carefully evaluated for
bias, and regarded as an initial step in producing estimates
that shed preliminary insight into the nature and scope of
an emergent issue, or one about which little is known,
such as prescription drug abuse.
In light of these issues, this diversion study reports find-
ings using an existing opt-in Internet sample recruited
from the entire United States for the following purposes:
(1) provide estimates of NMU of ADHD medications by
identifying specific medications used in the treatment of
ADHD rather than using a general question about "pre-
scription stimulants" commonly used, (2) identify the
subpopulations (e.g., those with ADHD) at greatest risk
for NMU, (3) identify important sources of diverted med-
ications, (4) examine motivations for NMU, and (5) esti-
mate the patterns of alcohol and other drug use in
combination with ADHD medications.
Methods
Study sample and procedures
Participants were drawn from Harris Interactive's Harris
Poll Online (HPOL) panel, which consists of several mil-
lion members internationally who consented to be con-
tacted for public opinion surveys administered through
the Internet. Members are added to the database after they
have completed a two-stage registration process: first by
signing on to the HPOL Web site and then by responding
to a confirmation e-mail message providing a confidential
password. Data are collected through an encrypted, pass-
word-protected Web portal. Eligible panelists were nonin-
stitutionalized civilian adults aged 18 to 49 living in the
United States (50 states and the District of Columbia). A
minimum age of 18 was chosen because the time and
costs of obtaining active parental consent for minors
likely would have offset the benefits of online data collec-
tion. The maximum age was set at 49 to increase the effi-
ciency of the sampling design, taking into account the low
prevalence of NMU of prescription drugs among persons
aged 50 or older [23] and the number of respondents who
would be needed to generalize to this age group. Moreo-
ver, the NSDUH, which was used as a benchmark to post-
stratify the data, collapses ages 50 to 65 into a single cate-
gory rather than reporting age-specific data for this range.
The sample size was determined from prevalence rates of
NMU of ADHD stimulants estimated from Kroutil et al.
[7]. These estimates provided sample sizes for three targets
based on two broad age groupings (18 to 25 and 26 to
49), gender, and NMU of ADHD stimulants (lifetime and
past 3 years). These procedures favored the representation
of whites, males, and young adults to ensure adequate
numbers of nonmedical users (NMUs) in the final sam-
ple.
The survey was conducted during August 2005. Study
enrollment and consent involved a two-part process. First,
e-mail invitations describing the study were sent to panel
members who initially met eligibility criteria according to
data in the Harris Interactive (HI) database on panel
members' age group and country of residence. These crite-
ria were based on the NSDUH, which collects information
from residents of households, noninstitutional group
quarters (e.g., shelters, rooming houses, dormitories), and
civilians living on military bases. Persons excluded from
the survey include homeless persons who do not use shel-
ters, active-duty military personnel, and residents of insti-
tutional group quarters, such as prisons and long-term
hospitals. Respondents completed a short screener that
verified these characteristics. The screener also asked
Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2007, 2:32 http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/2/1/32

about respondents' military status, living situation, and
substance use history, including NMU of ADHD medica-
tions; target groups were filled according to screening
responses. For consistency with the NSDUH, active-duty
military personnel and residents of institutional group
quarters (e.g., long-term care facilities) were excluded
from the study. Eligible respondents (i.e., those whose tar-
get groups had not been filled) were routed to a more
detailed consent statement for participation in the full
survey. Respondents who otherwise would have been eli-
gible but whose target groups had already been filled did
not complete the full survey. The survey took an average
of 20 minutes to complete if respondents reported NMU.
A total of 295,414 e-mail invitations were sent out, and
11,200 responses were received, regardless of outcome, or
about 3.8% of the invitations. Of the 11,200 HPOL mem-
bers who responded, 4,541 met the eligibility criteria and
were needed for the study (i.e., their target groups had not
yet been filled). Among this latter group, 4,297 (94.6%)
completed the survey, and 244 (5.4%) declined to partic-
ipate or did not complete the survey by the close of data
collection.
Weighting procedures
We employed a two-part methodology to adjust for Inter-
net responses relative to the U.S. population of adults
aged 18 to 49. First, propensity scoring methods were
used to weight the data to approximate results for a prob-
ability-based telephone survey. Second, the data were fur-
ther weighted to match the U.S. target population
distribution by general demographic characteristics and to
match the distribution of past-month cigarette use and
past-month binge alcohol use estimated from 2003
NSDUH, which were the most current publicly available
data during the data processing phase of this study, in
2005 [28]. These procedures are discussed in further detail
below.
The first step in the weighting procedure involved propen-
sity scoring to reduce the bias attributable to collecting
data from only HPOL members. The propensity score was
included to adjust for self-selection into the online popu-
lation and the panel, as well as for survey nonresponse
that may not be explained by demographic differences. HI
periodically conducts parallel telephone and Web surveys
to measure attitudinal and behavioral variables that pre-
dict one's propensity to be online; the telephone survey is
based on random-digit dialing (RDD) probability sam-
pling. Using the combined telephone and Web surveys,
HI created a propensity score model [27] for online survey
response. Weights were created so that the weighted distri-
bution of the propensity score for Web respondents was
matched to the distribution for the RDD telephone
respondents. This approach caused the weighted distribu-
tion of the attitudinal and behavioral variables of Web
respondents to be aligned with those of the RDD tele-
phone respondents. In short, the propensity score adjust-
ment may make the Internet survey estimates more
comparable to those obtained from an RDD telephone
survey. It is similar to adjustments made in clinical and
observational studies to ensure that groups are balanced
on potentially confounding characteristics. In this case,
the effect of confounding by selection into the Internet
panel is adjusted using information from an RDD tele-
phone survey. The weighting targets for the telephone sur-
vey were derived from the Current Population Survey
conducted annually by the U.S. Census.
The second step was that the propensity score-adjusted
weights that RTI obtained from HI underwent further cal-
ibration using the generalized exponential model [29]
using data from the 2003 NSDUH; the 2003 NSDUH had
a weighted household screening response rate of 90.7%
and a weighted interview response rate of 77.4% [30]. We
used past-month cigarette use and past-month binge alco-
hol use from NSDUH as a benchmark in creating final
weights to make appropriate inferences to the noninstitu-
tionalized U.S. adult population aged 18 to 49. Both of
these variables are likely related to a respondent's proba-
bility of substance use and a respondent's likelihood of
being in a Web panel [31]. Age, gender, and highest edu-
cation also were included in the weight adjustment to
bring the weighted distribution of the Internet respond-
ents in line with the U.S. target population. This strategy
further aligned the Internet sample with the large, nation-
ally representative NSDUH on factors related to NMU of
prescription medications. Although a detailed accounting
of the propensity model is beyond the scope of the current
manuscript, this additional supplemental information is
freely available by contacting the primary author.
We also evaluated bias by comparing estimates in our sur-
vey with those for analogous variables in the 2005
NSDUH. Correspondence between the 2005 Diversion II
estimates and the 2005 NSDUH suggests that the propen-
sity model developed using 2003 NSDUH data, a follow-
up telephone survey, and the U.S. census successfully
reduced bias in the estimates, thus providing a large
degree of confidence in the resulting estimates.
Sample characteristics and correspondence with the 2005
NSDUH
Table 1 provides a demographic breakdown of the study
sample, including unweighted and weighted percentages.
Because our procedures targeted specified numbers of
NMUs, young adults and whites were overrepresented in
the survey; however, the final analysis weights of young
adults and whites reflect their representation in the U.S.
population aged 18 to 49.

Table 2 compares estimates from the 2005 diversion study
and the 2005 NSDUH, including significance tests and
effect sizes. We present effect sizes using Cohen's d [32]
because the combined samples of the NSDUH (N =
32,104) and diversion study (N = 4,297) had sufficiently
high power to classify even the smallest of differences as
statistically significant. Measures in Table 2 were not used
in our weight calibrations. Therefore, they indicate how
well our weighting procedures yielded estimates that are
comparable to a large, national probability survey. Of the
drug use items common to both studies, only the preva-
lence estimate for lifetime NMU of Cylert (pemoline) was
significantly different, though the effect size suggests that
this difference was relatively small.
Instrument and measures
Demographic and substance use items were based directly
on public-domain NSDUH questions to establish compa-
rability in the estimates between the two studies. NMU of
prescription drugs was defined as use without a prescrip-
tion or for the feeling or experience; examples of exact
question wordings in the diversion study are shown in the
appendix. Consistent with NSDUH, respondents were
asked about the most recent NMU, including NMU in the
12-month period prior to taking the survey (i.e., "past
year").
NSDUH asks about lifetime NMU of a subset of ADHD
medications but does not ask specifically about most
recent NMU of ADHD medications. Therefore, we
adapted NSDUH questions to ask about the most recent
NMU of a wider range of ADHD medications. Similar to
NSDUH, pictures of prescription pills were used to facili-
tate recall. For comparability with NSDUH, we asked
respondents about NMU of brand-name drugs followed
by their generic equivalents, or about NMU of specific
brand-name drugs only. In addition, we asked respond-
ents about NMU of a fictitious drug (Supraval) to gauge
the potential for indiscriminate reporting of NMU [33].
After completing the medication module, respondents
were asked the number of days in the past year they used
any ADHD medication.
NSDUH also does not capture information on ADHD
symptomatology. Therefore, we created items to capture
whether respondents reported ever receiving a diagnosis

of ADHD from a medical professional and whether they
ever received prescription medication for their condition.
Among respondents who reported that they had received
prescriptions for ADHD in the past year, we excluded four
who reported that they obtained some medications by
misrepresenting their symptoms or by going to doctors
with lenient prescribing practices. We defined remaining
respondents who received prescriptions for their ADHD
in the past year as having "legitimate" prescriptions
because they did not report NMU, or if they did, they did
not obtain their medications fraudulently from physi-
cians.
Using existing items from prior studies [28,34], respond-
ents with past-year NMU of ADHD medications were
asked to report ways in which they obtained these drugs
in that period. In addition, respondents who reported
past-year NMU were asked about drugs they used at the
same time or within a couple of hours of their NMU of
ADHD medications. Past-year NMUs also were asked the
primary reason for misusing these ADHD medications

Analysis
Descriptive statistics include prevalence estimates (per-
centages), the corresponding standard errors, and the esti-
mated numbers of persons in the population. These were
calculated by applying weights to generalize the answers
of the respondents to the population of U.S. civilian, non-
institutionalized adults aged 18 to 49. Statistical tests,
such as chi-squares, odds ratios, and corresponding 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were used to examine differ-
ences in the distribution of outcomes within demographic
and substance use subgroups. Bivariate associations are
presented because our primary interest was to identify vul-
nerable populations rather than build explanatory models
using multivariate statistical modeling approaches. How-
ever, we also estimated a single multivariable (i.e.,
adjusted) model using logistic regression. The independ-
ent variables included demographics, ADHD status, and
drug use history. We present the significance effect of each
characteristic after adjusting for potential confounders in
the model. All analyses used SUDAAN (Release 9.01) to
account for the sampling design by making appropriate
use of the calculated sample weights [36]. As this was not
a multistage design, no adjustments were necessary to cor-
rect the standard errors for the sampling of respondents
within strata.
Results
Prevalence of lifetime and past-year NMU
An estimated 7.1% of U.S. adults aged 18 to 49 used non-
medically any ADHD medication, which includes both
stimulants and nonstimulants, at least once in their life-
time, and 2% did so in the past year (Table 2); estimates
were comparable for ADHD stimulants. NMU of short-
acting forms of ADHD stimulants was more prevalent
than that of long-acting ones, both for lifetime (5.4% for
short-acting ADHD stimulants versus 2.1% for long-act-
ing) and past-year (1.6% versus 1.0%) periods. (See the
appendix for examples of how survey information was
obtained on NMU of short- and long-acting medications).
Many of the specific drug estimates for past-year NMU
(Table 3) should be interpreted cautiously because of
their imprecision, as shown by the magnitude of the
standard errors relative to the estimates. Most respondents
who reported past-year NMU reported such use on multi-
ple occasions Â­ an estimated 30% of past-year NMUs of
ADHD medications used on 1 or 2 days in the past year,
and 70% used on 3 or more days.
Past-year NMU in selected population subgroups
Bivariate data in Table 4 indicate that the most vulnerable
populations for NMU were those abusing illicit drugs Â­
including methamphetamine (OR = 48.3 for past-year
users versus nonusers), cocaine (OR = 26.4), marijuana
(OR = 7.3) Â­ and alcohol (binge drinking OR = 5.1). In
addition, 69.2% of NMUs reported binge drinking in the
past month, and 53.9% used marijuana in the past year,
but only 16% were past-year methamphetamine users
(data not shown).
Higher rates of NMU of ADHD medications also were
observed for those who self-reported that they had
received a legitimate prescription for ADHD medications
in the past year (OR = 22.1) or had received medications
in their lifetime but not in the past year (OR = 6.3).
Although ADHD apparently elevated the risk of NMU, 1.9
million of the 2.6 million persons aged 18 to 49 (73%)
who participated in NMU had never been diagnosed and
treated pharmacologically for ADHD. Further, fewer than
5% of past-year users who used ADHD medications non-
medically were prescribed ADHD medications in that
period.
NMU of ADHD medications was more prevalent among
young adults aged 18 to 25 (4.3%) than among adults
aged 26 to 49 (1.3%). No significant differences were
observed in key demographic subgroups, including gen-
der, race, student status, and insurance status.
Similar to the bivariate models, in the multivariate logistic
regression model, the likelihood of past-year NMU of
ADHD drugs was higher for past-year marijuana users and
binge drinkers than for their nonusing counterparts.
Receipt of ADHD medications in the past year or lifetime
also remained significantly associated with NMU of
ADHD drugs in the multivariate model. However, the
association for past-year methamphetamine use became
nonsignificant in the multivariate model, suggesting that
the strong bivariate association between methampheta-
mine use and NMU of ADHD drugs may be accounted for
largely by other demographic, psychosocial, and sub-
stance use characteristics. This could be due either to con-
founding in which NMU and methamphetamine use are
related to a third demographic or substance use factor, or
a mediational pathway in which the exogenous factors
influence methamphetamine use, which influences NMU
of ADHD medications. The effect of age also became non-
significant in the multivariate model, suggesting a possi-
ble mediational pathway in which age may influence
ADHD symptoms and substance use behaviors such as
binge alcohol use and marijuana or cocaine use. In turn,
other drug use and ADHD symptoms may influence the
likelihood of past-year NMU of ADHD medications.

Sources of diverted medications and motivations for NMU
Figure 1 presents findings on sources of diverted ADHD
medications for the NMUs who reported never having an
ADHD diagnosis and prescription. The 95% confidence
intervals also are presented to show the precision of the
estimates. The most common source among this group
was a friend or family member (66%) who gave away
some of their prescription. More than 34% of NMUs had
taken or stolen medications from friends, family, or other
sources. However, physicians also were a significant
source of diverted medications for this group, with nearly
20% of NMUs having obtained fraudulent prescriptions
by fabricating symptoms or presenting to doctors who
were known to "not ask too many questions." An esti-
mated 5% of NMUs without a legitimate need for a pre-
scription procured their medications over the Internet.

Principal motivations among past-year NMUs were pro-
ductivity (40%) and staying awake (23%) (Figure 2). Use
principally to "get high" (13%), for tension relief (10%),
or for fun, kicks, or excitement (5%) also were noted.
About 1% of past-year NMUs used ADHD medications
principally to facilitate alcohol use.
Past-year NMU of ADHD medications in combination with
selected drugs
Among those who had used ADHD medications nonmed-
ically in the past year, 68% also used alcohol, other pre-
scription medications, or illicit drugs at the same time or
within a couple of hours of their nonmedical ADHD med-
ication use (Figure 3). More than half (53%) of past-year
NMUs drank alcohol while using these medications, and
26% used marijuana. Nearly one in five past-year NMUs
aged 18 to 49, had used ADHD medications in combina-
tion with cocaine at least once in the past year.
Discussion
Despite media attention on the nonmedical use of pre-
scription ADHD medication [37], our understanding
about the characteristics of NMU remains relatively
underdeveloped compared to other substances such as

alcohol and tobacco. This study contributes new data on
a variety of issues related to NMU that provide insight into
the patterns of NMU of prescription ADHD medications
and associated risk factors in the United States. However,
results from our study are not directly comparable to
other data sources given that our study focuses on specific
types of ADHD drugs rather than on stimulants in general.
Most directly comparable is the study conducted by
Kroutil and colleagues [7] using the 2002 NSDUH. Based
on those data, the past-year prevalence of NMU of ADHD
stimulants was higher among young adults aged 18 to 25
(1.3%). This estimate is lower than our estimate of 4.3%
for those aged 18 to 25 for at least two reasons. First, the
current study covered a larger range of stimulant medica-
tions, including medications such as Adderall, than the
NSDUH. Also, the Kroutil et al. [7] study estimated NMU
of ADHD medications for persons who had not misused
other stimulants; that likely underestimated the preva-
lence of any NMU of ADHD medications.
Although not directly comparable because the estimates
are based on only stimulants, the 2005 NSDUH estimated
that 3.6% of persons aged 18 to 25 had used any stimu-
lant nonmedically in the past year. We also estimated the
past-year prevalence from the public use files of the
National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related
Conditions [38], which was found to be 1.7% among
those aged 18 to 25. Follow-up data for young adults from
the 2005 Monitoring the Future survey indicated that 5%
to 7% of young adults aged 19 to 24 used amphetamines

"not under a doctor's orders," and 2.9% to 5.5% did so for
Ritalin [39]. Results from the College Alcohol Study
revealed that the rate of past-year NMU of prescription
stimulants among college students was 4.1% [40], which
was similar to the 4.6% reported by students aged 18 to 25
in the current study.
Inspection of the prevalence rates from various commu-
nity-based investigations revealed that, even among repre-
sentative probability surveys, there is a wide degree of
variation, which may be due to differences in methodol-
ogy. For example, the NSDUH uses a definition of NMU
based on use without a doctor's prescription or "only for
the experience or feeling it caused." This final definition
resulted from methodological testing [23,41] to simplify
the concept of "nonmedical" use for NSDUH respond-
ents, some of whom are as young as 12. This definition
has been criticized for leaving open the possibility that
legitimate use may be reported by mistake [42]. However,
differences in prevalence estimates between surveys such
as the NSDUH and National Epidemiologic Survey on
Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) also may be
related to differences in mode of administration; NSDUH
questions about drug use are self-administered, but
NESARC is administered directly by interviewers. Other
research suggests that respondents may underreport sensi-
tive behaviors if asked directly by interviewers [43]. Nev-
ertheless, findings on the correlates of NMU of ADHD
medications from this study were largely consistent with
previous research, providing a degree of confidence in our
methods. In particular, we observed higher rates of NMU
among young adults aged 18 to 25 than among older age
groups, which parallels other national data [44,45].
There also is significant interest in the rates of NMU
among students. Recent studies suggest that young adults,
and particularly students, may account for much of the
NMU of prescription stimulants. For example, Herman-
Stahl et al. [9] found in analyses of NSDUH data that col-
lege students were at a greater risk of NMU of prescription
stimulants than their noncollege peers. Further, previous
college enrollment or graduation also was a significant
risk factor, suggesting that NMU of stimulants in general
may persist beyond college. However, the current study
found no statistically significant (P < .05) differences in
the rates of NMU of ADHD medications between young
adult students (4.6%) and young adult nonstudents
(4.2%), although we considered a broader range of medi-
cations and focused on ADHD drugs rather than on pre-
scription stimulants in general. It also should be noted
that our definition of student status included technical
students and did not distinguish between full-time and
part-time students. Thus, future studies should probe for
differences in NMU by student enrollment status, includ-
ing full-time, part-time, public, private, technical, and
community college.
Another important contribution of this study involves
examination of the patterns of polydrug use among
NMUs of ADHD medications. Binge alcohol use (69%)
and marijuana use (54%) were fairly common among
past-year NMUs, which also has been found in a previous
study [9]. Although most ADHD medications are classi-
fied as stimulants, only 16% of past-year NMUs of ADHD
medications also were past-year methamphetamine users.
In contrast, 46% of methamphetamine users commonly
misused prescription ADHD medications. One possible
explanation for this latter finding is that methampheta-
mine users may engage in NMU of ADHD stimulants as a
substitute when methamphetamine is unavailable. How-
ever, additional studies, using items that capture aspects
of substitution among methamphetamine users, are
needed to specifically test this assertion. Overall, NMU of
ADHD medications by methamphetamine users appears
to constitute a relatively small portion of the overall diver-
sion of ADHD medications in the United States, although
use of methamphetamine is a powerful risk factor for
NMU.
A significant strength of this study was that we also asked
about the concomitant use of ADHD medications with
other drugs and alcohol. We observed that approximately
68% of past-year NMUs had used at least one other sub-
stance either at the same time or within a couple of hours
of NMU of ADHD medications. Findings from McCabe et
al. [11] using a sample drawn from a single university
showed that most polydrug use involving alcohol and
prescription drugs occurred simultaneously rather than
on separate occasions. The high rate of alcohol use in
combination with NMU of ADHD drugs is alarming in
these studies, given that ADHD stimulants can counteract
the depressant effects of alcohol. This leaves open the pos-
sibility that persons who drink alcohol may be able to
prolong their drinking by also using stimulants, thereby
increasing their risk of alcohol poisoning. Findings from
the Drug Abuse Warning Network [46] indicate that over
2% of all emergency department visits involving alcohol
also involved prescription stimulants [46]. We also found
that nearly one in five NMUs of ADHD medications had
used them in combination with cocaine, which may
increase the risk of adverse cardiac events, given known
risks associated with cocaine use [47] and recent concerns
about potential cardiovascular risks associated with spe-
cific ADHD medications [48]. The issue of co-occurrence
is particularly germane because alcohol and other drugs
have the potential to affect the synaptic transmission pro-
duced by stimulant and nonstimulant ADHD medica-
tions, thus affecting regulation and causing adverse
immediate and long-term health consequences [49-51].

Recent research has found elevated rates of substance use
among those with ADHD [16,52]. Similarly, findings
from our study indicated that those who self-identified
that they had been diagnosed by a physician with ADHD
and had been prescribed medication were at increased risk
for NMU of ADHD medications. However, NMU by this
subpopulation constitutes a relatively small proportion
(less than 5%) of the total past-year NMU in the United
States. Further, interpretation of the association between
nonmedical use of ADHD medications and a history of
pharmacologic treatment for ADHD requires caution. Our
data are cross-sectional and preclude causal inferences,
such as concluding that prescribing medications with
potential abuse liability increases the likelihood of NMU.
Accumulating evidence from prospective research also
suggests that treatment of ADHD with stimulants in and
of itself does not confer additional liability to NMU of
ADHD stimulants or other substances [53,54].
One possible explanation for the relation between NMU
and an ADHD diagnosis or receipt of medications is that
some patients receiving pharmacological treatments may
be undermedicated or noncompliant with their pre-
scribed therapeutic dosage. Consequently, they may take
excessive quantities to self-medicate or overcompensate
for earlier noncompliance because of an increase in the
quantity and severity of untreated symptoms. However,
undermedication seems a less plausible explanation for
NMU in this study, as the question wording for NMU
primes the respondent to answer about use beyond the
therapeutic value of the drug as prescribed by a physician
or medical professional (see the appendix). However, pro-
ductivity (39.8%) was a commonly endorsed motivation
for NMU for all respondents, regardless of ADHD status.
Thus, it is possible that a proportion of NMUs who are
taking ADHD medications to be more productive may be
self-medicating ADHD symptoms. It is also possible that
a large proportion of those whose primary motivation for
NMU is productivity may actually meet the criteria for
ADHD, but have not received a formal medical diagnosis.
In contrast to self-medication, another prominent sub-
group of NMUs Â­ nearly 30% Â­ could be considered rec-
reational users whose principal motivations were tension
relief, euphoria, or thrill-seeking. Another possible expla-
nation linking ADHD and NMU is that an additional set
of vulnerability factors linked to NMU, such as co-occur-
ring psychiatric disorders, may increase the likelihood of
NMU of ADHD medications. We are conducting addi-
tional analyses to examine the complex issues related to
treatment status, ADHD symptoms, NMU, and motiva-
tions for use. Thus, additional research is needed with per-
sons being treated pharmacologically for ADHD to
compare NMU between those with and without psychiat-
ric comorbidity to identify the combination of risk factors
that can account for vulnerability to NMU.
Overall, these findings should be interpreted in light of
several considerations. First, the validity of self-reported
drug use among Internet respondents depends on their
willingness to answer truthfully about drug use in that
data collection mode and their ability to recall use of spe-
cific drugs within designated time frames. To aid in recall,
our online survey questionnaire supplied respondents
with reference dates to establish recall periods such as the
past 12 months and, where possible, made pictures of
medications available to respondents. We have also
shown that our findings are consistent with data from a
large national probability survey (NSDUH), as well as
with findings from other studies on NMU. Confidence in
our findings is also supported by the low prevalence of
self-reported NMU of the fictitious drug Supraval (life-
time: 0.11%; past year: 0.09%), suggesting that respond-
ents were able to discriminate between real and fictitious
drugs. Substance use data have been shown to be statisti-
cally comparable between data collection modes involv-
ing mail surveys and the Internet [55], as well as between
the Internet and telephone [56]. HI also conducts routine
screening of Internet IP addresses and conducts follow-
ups with members to ensure that each participant is not
using multiple e-mail accounts to opt into the panel. For
security reasons, each panelist is also assigned a unique
and confidential ID to ensure privacy. Together, these
findings strengthen our confidence in the accuracy of the
self-reports and use of the Internet recruitment design.
Although the convergence of our findings with those from
other studies does not rule out misreporting of drug use in
our data, it does not suggest a markedly greater misreport-
ing problem in our study than in others. Nevertheless, the
possibility of a mode effect does remain [57], and
researchers should be sensitive to its presence by compar-
ing estimates from other data sources to check for reliabil-
ity of the data.
Second, concerns about selection bias may arise from the
low overall number of responses relative to the number of
e-mail invitations that were sent and from our use of a
nonprobability Internet survey to estimate NMU. With
regard to the numbers responding, it should be noted that
this method differs from other survey research methods,
in that the current study did not employ numerous fol-
low-up attempts or refusal conversion efforts. Further,
bias is defined as the difference between the sample esti-
mate and the true population estimate. If the results from
other nationally representative data systems (e.g.,
NSDUH, NESARC) are used as the "true" gold standard
population estimates, then comparing our results as the
sample estimates to those found in other studies as the
population estimates reveals no appreciable degree of
bias. In addition to the studies noted above (e.g.,
NESARC, MTF), a direct comparison of estimates between
the current study and the 2005 NSDUH, the most meth-

odologically parallel study, for variables that were not
used in our weighting procedures suggests that we
reduced to a large degree the potential biases resulting
from the sample selection for the online survey. In addi-
tional analyses not shown, we also estimated parallel
regression models using the 2005 NSDUH and our Inter-
net sample. For the outcomes of past-year marijuana use
and past-month binge alcohol use, we observed high con-
sistency in the estimated odds ratios for common demo-
graphic characteristics measured in both studies. The
primary difference in the estimates for these variables was
that the width of the confidence interval around each esti-
mate was wider in the Internet study than in the NSDUH.
This could be expected given the differences in the sample
sizes between the NSDUH (N = 32,104) and our study (N
= 4,297). If bias existed in the propensity score algorithm
used to generate the sample weights, we would have
expected to observe differences in the estimates in addi-
tion to the confidence intervals. Epidemiologic studies of
NMU of ADHD drugs can suffer from other biases inher-
ent to sample selection, such as samples drawn from clin-
ical populations, local or regional samples, or samples of
demographic subgroups that are accessible for surveys
(e.g., students). Therefore, we believe that our study adds
to the base of knowledge about NMU of ADHD medica-
tions through its national focus and depth of coverage of
relevant issues.
We note that the value of the Internet panel design is
meant to complement, not replace a national probability
study. Internet surveys may be a promising approach for
conducting formative research or gathering information
on a focused topic for less time and expense than other
survey methods. Internet panels are burgeoning in many
countries around the world, and this study design is
appearing in the research literature with greater frequency.
For example, Schlenger et al. (2002) [58] used such an
approach to examine the psychological reaction to the ter-
rorist attacks of September 11, 2001, within weeks after
the event. Another study by West et al. (2006) [59] used
the Harris Interactive Online Poll, a panel with several
million members in 125 countries, to examine patterns of
smoking cessation. Their combined sample consisted of
2,009 participants from the United States, Canada, the
United Kingdom, and France. They compared characteris-
tics of cigarette smokers from a standing Internet panel
who were selected for the study to characteristics of smok-
ers in national data systems in each respective country and
found a high degree of correspondence on major demo-
graphic characteristics. In particular, the rapidity with
which Internet surveys can be conducted may open new
opportunities for cross-national studies of NMU of pre-
scription medications. Under careful methodological
rigor, this approach may be favorable to a small face-to-
face survey or a large telephone survey. Nevertheless,
results from an Internet design should be regarded as pre-
liminary estimates that should be replicated using
national probability samples.
Conclusion
Given these considerations, this research has important
implications for addiction research and policy. Future
studies, perhaps using longitudinal designs, should con-
sider examining factors that may be important for the ini-
tiation of NMU, progression to abuse or dependence, and
transitions to other drugs, such as methamphetamine.
These studies might examine the relevant contributions of
access to medications, attitudes toward use, and motiva-
tions for use as they relate to these varying trajectories over
time. Additional studies may also consider examining the
use of specific ADHD medication formulations, such as
long-acting versus short-acting medications, as well as the
prevalence of NMU formulations in relation to different
prescribing practices across various geographic areas.
In terms of public policy, regulatory options to discourage
diversion may be limited. In the United States, for exam-
ple, many of these medications are already under the
highest level of Federal regulation for legally approved
controlled substances (i.e., Schedule II under the Control-
led Substances Act). Nevertheless, about 20% of NMUs
obtained diverted ADHD medications directly from phy-
sicians, with a much smaller percentage (5%) obtaining
them from Internet pharmacies. Thus, further education
may be needed to aid physicians in recognizing when
patients are attempting to obtain ADHD medications
fraudulently. Legislation also may be needed to create
additional prescription drug monitoring programs at the
state level or stricter penalties for lax prescribing practices
for ADHD medications.
Formulation of medications also plays a significant role in
drug abuse [60]. Therefore, decisions about which medi-
cations are included in insurance providers' formularies
could affect ADHD medication prescribing practices and
could decrease the availability of those ADHD medica-
tions with greater abuse liability.
Consistent with other research, however, this current
study showed that persons with prescriptions for ADHD
medications were the leading source of diverted medica-
tions. For example, a study of ADHD stimulant diversion
among college students at a Midwestern university found
peers to be the most common sources of diverted prescrip-
tion ADHD stimulants [61]. Findings from the 2005
NSDUH also reported that the most recent stimulants
used nonmedically were provided by friends or relatives
[14]. About 35% of NMUs in our study who did not have
a prescription of their own were estimated to have stolen
ADHD medications. Thus, some people who have a pre-
Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2007, 2:32 http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/2/1/32

scription to treat ADHD may unknowingly be supplying
ADHD medications that are taken without their permis-
sion.
Because friends and family are important sources of
diverted medications, education of patients with prescrip-
tions for ADHD medications will be important in reduc-
ing the risk of NMU and deterring informal distribution to
family and friends. As such, intervention programs should
be developed to educate patients regarding the potential
for diversion, whether the medications are intentionally
shared or taken without the patient's knowledge.
Finally, the use of this Internet survey methodology may
be relevant to policy makers with limited budgets who are
seeking timely information on a relatively low-prevalence
phenomenon in a target population. Again, this method-
ology would not supplant national probability surveys. If
an external data source exists for use as a benchmark,
however, this data collection method could provide pol-
icy makers and planners with usable information in a rel-
atively short amount of time.

Appendix
The wordings of questions about lifetime NMU are shown
below. Respondents used "radio" buttons to indicate their
use or nonuse of each drug. Respondents were required to
enter an answer for every drug (which could include "Not
sure" or "Decline to answer") before the interview would
allow them to move on. The following is an excerpt from
the survey:
"Now we have some questions about drugs that people
are supposed to take only if they have a prescription from
a doctor.
We are only interested in your use of a drug if:
Â· the drug was not prescribed for you, or
Â· you pretended to have symptoms (or worse symptoms)
to get a prescription, or
Â· you took the drug only for the experience or feeling it
caused.
People sometimes take these medications to lose weight,
to stay awake, for attention deficit disorders, or other rea-
sons. We are not interested in the use of "over-the-coun-
ter" drugs such as Dexatrim, No Doz, Benadryl, or Nytol
that can be bought in drug stores or grocery stores without
a doctor's prescription.
The next pages contain pictures of some of the drugs we
will be asking you about. Please look carefully at the pic-
tures of these drugs before you answer the next questions.
[DRUG PICTURE SCREENS FOLLOWED] Please select
the "NEXT" button at the bottom of your screen to con-
tinue with the survey.
To identify past-year NMU, respondents were asked spe-
cifically, "How long has it been since you last used the
drugs shown below when they were not prescribed for you
or you took them only for the experience or feeling they
caused?" Respondents were shown only drugs that they
reported ever using nonmedically. Valid response choices
were (1)within the past 30 days Â­ that is, since MONFILL
(where "MONFILL" was calculated from the interview
date to define the 30-day reference period); (2)more than
30 days ago but within the past 12 months; (3)more than
12 month ago but within the past 3 years; and (4)more
than 3 years ago. Respondents who reported that they last
used an ADHD medication nonmedically "in the past 30
days" or "more than 30 days ago but within the past 12
months" were defined as past-year NMUs.
During the past 12 months, what is the main reason you
used [this drug/these drugs] without a doctor's prescrip-
tion or only for the experience or feeling [it/they] caused?
1) For fun, kicks, or excitement

2) To relax or relieve tension
3) To feel good or get high
4) To have a good time with friends
5) To help yourself be more productive
6) To stay awake
7) To fit in with a group you like
8) (IF PAST YEAR ALCOHOL USE REPORTED) To be able
to drink more alcohol
9) Some other reason
(NOTE: Respondents not asked to specify the "other" rea-
son.)

Questions on self-reported ADHD diagnosis and medica-
tions are shown below. Questions AD01 and AD02
appeared fairly early in the survey, but after questions
DR01 through DR13 about lifetime nonmedical use of
specific prescription medications. Question ADRXYR
appeared toward the end of the survey, after all questions
about nonmedical use of ADHD drugs, nonmedical use of
other stimulants, and problems associated with nonmed-
ical use of prescription drugs.
These next questions are about attention-deficit/hyperac-
tivity disorder, also known as ADD or ADHD.
AD01. Did a doctor or other medical professional ever tell
you that you had ADD or ADHD?
1 Yes
2 No
8 Not sure
9 Decline to answer
AD02. (If AD01 = 1) Did a doctor or other medical profes-
sional ever prescribe any medications for your ADD or
ADHD?
1 Yes
2 No
8 Not sure
9 Decline to answer
