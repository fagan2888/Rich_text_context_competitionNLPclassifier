Abstract
In a constantly changing environment, one of the conditions for adaptation is based on the visual
system's ability to realize predictions. In this context, a question that arises is the evolution of
the processes allowing anticipation with regard to the acquisition of knowledge relative to
specific situations. We sought to study this question by focusing on boundary extension, the
tendency to overestimate the scope of a previously perceived scene. We presented to novice,
beginner, and expert car drivers road scenes in the form of approach sequences constituting very
briefly displayed photographs (i.e., 250 milliseconds each), in order to determine the effect of
expertise at an early stage of scene perception. After three presentations, participants had to
judge whether a fourth photograph was the same, closer up, or further away than the third one.
When experts and beginners showed a classical boundary extension effect, novices presented no
directional memory distortion. Different hypotheses are discussed.

In a constantly changing environment, one of the conditions for adaptation is based on the
visual system's (VS) ability to realize predictions. Some of these predictions deal with the
likely future trajectory followed by a moving object, or the probable evolution of a dynamic
visual scene in which the observer is embedded, a phenomenon called representational
momentum (RM; Freyd & Finke, 1984; e.g., Hubbard, 2015; Didierjean, Ferrari, &
Bla
¨ ttler, 2014, for reviews). However, the predictions realized by the VS also concern areas

of the environment just outside the observer's visual field. This phenomenon is known as
boundary extension (BE; Intraub & Richardson, 1989; e.g., Intraub, 2012, for a review) and
refers to the tendency to overestimate the scope of a previously perceived scene, with the
observer's memory including information relative to the information likely to have been just
outside the original scene's boundaries.
While this phenomenon is often described as an error relative to the content of a
previously perceived scene, it nevertheless presents an important adaptive value; indeed, it
enables the VS to realize good predictions relative to the information present just beyond the
edges of a view (e.g., Intraub & Dickinson, 2008). Moreover, BE is observed both with
paradigms that simulate visual scanning--that is, with photographs presented for
durations commensurate with an eye fixation (250 milliseconds) and with retention
intervals imitating a saccade (42 milliseconds)--and with saccade-contingent paradigms in
which the phenomenon is tested after an actual saccade (e.g., Intraub & Dickinson, 2008).
Theoretically, this observation is significant as it suggests that anticipating the upcoming
layout plays a role in the process of visual integration. It also suggests that BE
participates in coherent and continuous representations of the surrounding world (e.g.,
Intraub & Dickinson, 2008), for instance, by priming the visual perception of the
upcoming layout (Gottesman, 2011). To account for the rapid deployment of BE, Intraub
and Dickinson (2008) suggested that the phenomenon should not result from an ad hoc
extrapolation process, but may be deployed during scene understanding, the detection of
layout automatically activating a larger spatial framework. Thus, this phenomenon has been
observed in various situations, such as situations in which one can expect good memory (e.g.,
with low memory loads, cf., Munger, Owens, & Conway, 2005), during the life span (Seamon,
Schleger, Heister, Landau, & Blumenthal, 2002), or in the haptic modality. In this last case,
BE has been observed in equivalent proportions between blindfolded-sighted subjects and a
blind-and-deaf observer, who was also considered as a ``haptic expert'' (Intraub, 2004). The
fact that BE has been generalized to other sensory modalities suggests that anticipating the
upcoming layout is a fundamental aspect of scene representation. More recently, Intraub,
Morelli, and Gagnier (2015) even suggested that observation of BE in different sensory
modalities underlies a unitary scene representation.
These observations led Intraub and her colleagues to develop an alternative model to
the traditional visual-cognitive model of scene perception, the Multisource model
(e.g., Intraub, 2012). Contrary to the traditional model that argues that scene perception
relies on a single source of information, that is, the visual input, the Multisource model
postulates that scene perception relies on different sources of information, with spatial
information at its core. This model is thus close to grounded cognition theories (e.g.,
Barsalou, 2008) insofar as it considers that the observer is part of the scene he or she
perceives. During perception, the egocentric framework generated by spatial information is
``filled in'' by other sources of information, such as visual and amodal information, the
function of the latter being to continue the textures and surfaces of the scene just beyond
the edges of the perceived view. Moreover, during the first fixation on a view, the rapid
identification of the semantic category (i.e., gist) to which the perceived scene belongs (e.g.,
Potter, 1976) activates conceptual and contextual knowledge that generate expectations
relative to its surroundings (Intraub, 2012). Thus, the extrapolation process would occur
during scene perception (e.g., Intraub & Dickinson, 2008) by continuing the surfaces and
textures of the scene just beyond the edges of the view in an amodal form (i.e., abstract).
When the stimulus disappears, the observer encounters difficulty in discriminating the
extrapolated information (abstract) from the visual information (concrete), resulting in
spatial layout extrapolation. In this regard, BE is apprehended as a source monitoring
2 i-Perception
error (Johnson, Hashtroudi, & Lindsay, 1993), in which a part of the internally driven
information is combined with external information.
According to the Multisource model (Intraub, 2012), top-down expectations derived from
conceptual and contextual knowledge would play a central role in spatial layout extrapolation.
While the literature stresses the importance of knowledge relative to the gist of the perceived
scene in the BE process, a question that arises is whether spatial layout extrapolation is
modulated by the knowledge the observer has of the perceived scenes. The cognitive
expertise paradigm seems relevant to address this question. Indeed, it permits variation in
the amount of information available in LTM by contrasting novices and experts in a
particular field. It is well known that expert knowledge modifies the perception of scenes
depicting the perceiver's field of expertise, experts processing these scenes more effectively
than novices (e.g., Didierjean & Gobet, 2008, for a review). This cognitive advantage
manifests itself, for instance, with a larger visual span (Reingold, Charness, Pomplun, &
Stampe, 2001), the activation of automatic and parallel encoding procedures (Reingold,
Charness, Schultetus, & Stampe, 2001), or the tendency to anticipate more than novices the
probable evolution of the perceived situations (e.g., Didierjean & Marme
` che, 2005).
In this study, we chose to compare the performances of novices and experts in the field of
car driving. In most domains, age covaries with expertise. In addition to the two groups of
subjects, we thus tested a third group of beginners belonging to the same novice age class.
If we obtain an effect of expertise on BE, this group will enable us to determine whether the
observed effect results from an effect of age or from an effect of the amount of information
available in LTM.1 Moreover, as semantic knowledge related to the perceived scene is
activated quickly after scene apparition (e.g., Davenport & Potter, 2004), we chose to test
the effect of expertise at an early stage of scene perception by presenting road scenes for short
presentation durations (250 milliseconds). To increase the ecological value of our stimuli, we
decided to present the scenes in the form of approach sequences, a choice motivated by the
fact that these sequences transmit the dynamic information acquired during real driving
situations better than the same stimuli presented in a static form. Indeed, expert
knowledge is often highly contextualized and influences behavior only in very ecological
situations (e.g., Didierjean et al., 2014). Consequently, we used an adapted version of the
camera distance paradigm (CDP; e.g., Intraub & Dickinson, 2008) developed by Munger
et al. (2005) to determine whether BE and RM are related phenomena. In Munger et al.'s
experiment, photographs were presented not in isolation, as in the classical version of the
paradigm, but with sequences designed in such a way as to elicit RM by depicting an induced
approach motion of the self. These sequences involved the display of three photographs that
remained on screen very briefly. Each photograph was displayed for 250 milliseconds,
followed by the presentation of a blank screen for 250 milliseconds (Figure 1).
Immediately after the end of the sequence, a fourth photograph appeared and the observer
was asked to judge whether this photograph was closer up, further away, or strictly the same
as the last photograph in the sequence. The authors found not an RM effect (which would
have manifested itself by remembering the last scene of the sequence as a closer up view)
but rather a BE effect, leading them to suggest that gist information within a scene is
processed before movement. They also observed variations of BE patterns on approach
sequences as a function of individual differences in BE ratings obtained with single
photographs. Indeed, the participants who extended boundaries with single photographs
showed a trend toward less BE with approach sequences, whereas participants who did
not extend boundaries (i.e., boundary restriction [the effect opposite to BE] or no
directional distortion) of photographs presented in isolation showed BE with approach
sequences. These observations suggest that BE is modulated by individual differences.

In this sense, one can wonder whether differences in expert knowledge may be a factor of
variation in spatial layout extrapolation.
Our first objective is to replicate the observations realized by Munger et al. (2005).
According to these authors, BE seems to occur before RM in this ``competitive'' situation
between both effects, and we expect a BE phenomenon in all expertise levels. Our second
objective is to test how BE is modulated by expert knowledge. Indeed, (a) as stated by the
Multisource model (Intraub, 2012) which postulates that knowledge plays a central role in
spatial layout extrapolation, and (b) as a result of the important amount of knowledge
available in experts' LTM (e.g., Didierjean & Gobet, 2008), we expect greater BE first in
experts and then in beginners.
Method
Participants
Fifty-six subjects took part in the experiment and were divided into two groups according to
their car driving expertise level:
­ 20 novices (mean age ¼ 19; SD ¼ 1 year 4 months) who were students at the University of
Franche-Comte
´ (France) and who had never taken driving lessons.
­ 20 beginners (mean age ¼ 21; SD ¼ 2 years) who were students at the University of
Franche-Comte
´ (France) and had had their driving licences for 2 years on average
(mean ¼ 23 months; SD ¼ 18 months).
Figure 1. Depiction of a trial. Each trial was initiated by a 600-millisecond central fixation point before the
approach sequence appeared on screen. The sequences constituted three briefly presented photographs, and
participants had to compare the scope of a fourth picture to the third.
4 i-Perception
­ 16 experts who were driving instructors (mean age ¼ 39; SD ¼ 9 years 1 month), and who
declared that they had been giving driving lessons for 10 years on average (SD ¼ 8 years).
The choice of car driving instructors was motivated by the fact that they spend a lot of
time on the road.
All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. None was informed of the
objectives of the experiment, and all of them gave their consent verbally.
Materials
The experiment was presented on a 15-inch-screen MacBook Pro computer and was run by
Psyscope software. During the experiment, participants were seated approximately 50 cm
from the computer screen.
Stimuli
Ten approach sequences constituting three photographs were created for this experiment.
Each photograph depicted road scenes perceived from the driver's viewpoint and began with
a wide-angle version of the scene before finishing with a close-up version of the same scene.
The second photograph (medium version) was realized by cropping the wide-angle version by
approximately 30%, and the third photograph of the sequence (close-up version) was realized
by cropping the medium version by about 30%. Each photograph was screen-centered and
measured 14 Â 10 cm. An additional sequence was presented during the familiarization phase.
Procedure
We used an adapted version of the CDP to approach sequences developed by Munger et al.
(2005). In this version of the paradigm, each of the photographs constituting the sequence
was displayed very briefly, for 250 milliseconds, and the ISIs also lasted 250 milliseconds
(cf. Figure 1). Two hundred and fifty milliseconds after the disappearance of the last
photograph of the sequence, a fourth photo appeared on screen. The subject's task was to
compare the scope of the fourth stimulus to that of the third, by indicating on a 5-point scale
whether this fourth photograph was strictly the same (0 value of the scale), a closer up version
(a little: À1; much: À2), or a wider angle version (a little: 1; much: 2) of the third photograph.
As in Munger et al.'s (2005) procedure, which did not use distractors (i.e., closer up and wider
angle versions of the third photograph during boundary rating), the test photograph was
always strictly the same as the third photograph and stayed on screen until the subject
validated his or her answer (e.g., Gagnier & Intraub, 2012, for a version of the CDP
without distractors). BE occurred when this photograph was judged to be closer up. Each
sequence was preceded by a central fixation point of 600 milliseconds. Participants were
exposed to the familiarization phase before individually completing 10 trials in a random order.
Results
Figure 2 represents the mean boundary ratings observed for each expertise level. To
determine whether a memory distortion occurred, we computed the .95 confidence
intervals (represented by error bars). If the mean boundary rating does not differ
significantly from zero, no directional memory distortion has occurred. However, a
significant negative value indicates that the observers' representation included more
Me
´ne
´trier et al. 5
background than the original picture, suggesting a BE effect. Conversely, a significant
positive value shows that the observers' memory included less background, demonstrating
a boundary restriction effect. The mean boundary ratings observed for each expertise level
are presented in Figure 2. While results indicate no directional distortion in novices, they
reveal a BE effect in beginners and experts.
An ANOVA computed on subjects' mean boundary ratings with Expertise as a between-
subjects factor indicated an effect of expertise, F(2, 53) ¼ 4.99, p ¼ .01, 2 ¼ .16. Planned
comparisons computed on novices' and beginners' mean boundary ratings indicated an
effect of Expertise, t(38) ¼ 2.09, p < .05, d ¼ .66. Besides, the comparison of beginners' and
experts' mean boundary ratings permitted us to ensure that the effect observed was not due to
age, a factor that covariates with expertise. The results showed equivalent mean boundary
ratings between these two groups of subjects, t(34) ¼ 0.926, ns.
Discussion
The principal objective of this study was to test the effect of expert knowledge on spatial
layout extrapolation. We proposed a BE task during which road scenes were presented in the
form of approach sequences to car drivers with different levels of expertise: novices,
beginners, and experts. The results of the present study partially corroborate Munger
et al.'s (2005) findings as they reveal a prevalence of BE and an absence of an RM-like
effect. Moreover, BE appeared to be sensitive to expert knowledge with beginners and
experts extrapolating spatial layout, whereas no directional memory distortion was
observed in novices. These results indicate that expert knowledge is a source of
expectations likely to modulate BE. Analogous to Munger et al.'s (2005) findings, one
possible explanation is that beginners and experts may have incorporated a part of the
larger spatial context perceived in the wide-angle version of the scene into their memory in
equivalent proportions. This may have resulted in a source monitoring error (Johnson et al.,
1993) in which the observers were unable to discriminate the contextual information acquired

confidence intervals (.95). Significant negative values indicate boundary extension.

at the beginning of the approach sequence from the visual information actually depicted in the
last photograph of the sequence. Given the contingencies of the BE task presented here, this
interpretation differs slightly from the explanation traditionally provided by the Multisource
model, which postulates that source monitoring errors causing BE result from a difficulty in
discriminating external (i.e., visual and concrete) information from internally driven
information (i.e., extrapolated information, which is abstract in nature). These observations
suggest that BE is explained by a source-monitoring error which, depending on the tasks or the
situations, may involve confusion between external and internal information in some cases and
in others, as in the present study, a confusion between two external (i.e., concrete) sources of
information.
The absence of directional memory distortion in novices can be linked to the
observations realized by Bla
¨ ttler, Ferrari, Didierjean, and Marme
` che (2011) in RM. In a
study that aimed to examine the effect of expertise on RM, the authors proposed a
classical RM task during which they presented simulated aircraft landing scenes to
novices and experts (i.e., expert pilots from the French Air Force). While experts
showed a classical RM effect, novices surprisingly showed no memory distortion. The
authors interpreted this result as reflecting the weight of specific knowledge in motion
extrapolation. They argued that while RM is a particularly robust phenomenon
(Hubbard, 2015) that has been observed in many different situations (but see Kerzel,
2003), in the vast majority of studies, the observers were not actually real novices
relative to the scenes presented. In their experiment, which used visual simulations based
on synthesized images of aircraft landing scenes seen from the pilot's viewpoint, novices
were ``true'' novices and the RM effect was not observed. However, in our study, the
accurate memory observed in novices can hardly be interpreted as a lack of semantic
knowledge relative to road scenes as these scenes are familiar to novices, at least as
passengers (e.g., Jordan & Hunsinger, 2008). As Me
´ ne
´ trier and Didierjean (2013)
observed BE in novices with still road photographs displayed for 5 seconds, it seems
more plausible to suppose that BE in novices has not had sufficient time to develop.
However, given that Munger et al. (2005) showed that BE is affected both by stimulus
type (still photograph vs. approach sequence) and the individual differences in BE ratings
with single photographs (i.e., baseline BE), this hypothesis must be treated with caution.
The mechanisms affecting BE in approach sequences (e.g., priming effect as a result of the
presentation of a wider-angle version of the to-be-memorised scene) deserve further
research, including the field of expertise. Indeed, one limitation of the present research
is that it did not include a baseline BE rating, as in Munger et al.'s study.
Thus, our findings suggest that expert knowledge modulates BE. The equivalent spatial
layout extrapolation observed in beginners and experts suggests that drivers quickly become
sensitive to the semantic information depicted by road scenes. The absence of directional
distortion in novices leads us to question whether they extrapolate spatial layout at a later
stage of scene perception, given that the scenes remained on screen only briefly (750
milliseconds). Indeed, using still road photos, Me
´ ne
´ trier and Didierjean (2013) observed BE
in driving novices at a later stage of scene perception (5 seconds). Moreover, in the present
experiment, novices verbally reported having perceived no difference between the last image of
the approach sequence and the test photograph. This might be explained by the perceptual
advantage classically observed in experts; that is, experts process the scenes depicting their field
of expertise more effectively than novices (e.g., Reingold, Charness, Schultetus, et al., 2001).
Analyzing the time course of BE may enable us to determine the evolution of the extrapolation
process during scene perception as a function of expertise, a question that seems all the more
relevant as BE occurs very quickly (e.g., Dickinson & Intraub, 2008).
Me
´ne
´trier et al. 7
In conclusion, this study suggests that expert knowledge is involved in BE. Indeed, BE was
observed only in car drivers. The effect of expertise on BE suggests that the amount of
knowledge available in LTM affects the spatial layout extrapolation process for scenes
depicting the field of expertise of the observer at an early stage of scene perception. One
question that arises from these observations, then, is whether BE requires more time to be
deployed in nondrivers. Analyzing the time course of the phenomenon may help to answer
this question. Moreover, an equivalent amount of BE was observed between beginners and
experts, suggesting that the advantages of specific knowledge on the perception of scenes
depicting the observer's field of expertise emerge quickly. Such a mechanism seems adaptive
in nature, enabling subjects to process the environment in which they are embedded
more effectively.

1. The effect of ageing on BE has been the subject of only a few studies, which have led to a pattern of
results that is not clear to date. Indeed, while Seamon et al.'s (2002) observations suggest that BE
would be enhanced in older people compared with young adults, Multhaup, Munger, and Smith
(2016) globally observed equivalent BE in young and older adults and, in some conditions, a
tendency for less BE in the elderly.
