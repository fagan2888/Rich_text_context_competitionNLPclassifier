What brands are US smokers
under 25 choosing?
It is well known that the most heavily
advertised brands tend to attract the younger
smoker market. In the USA the most heavily
advertised brands are Marlboro, Newport,
and Camel.1 2 Few analyses have delved into
the specific varieties popular among youth.
Do ``Lights'' or ``Full Flavors'' predominate?
To answer this question, data on the cigarette
brand preferences of smokers in the 2002 US
National Survey on Drug Use and Health
were analysed.
Using the on-line analysis feature of the
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data
Archive,3 cigarette brand used in the last 30
days was cross tabulated with the type of
cigarette (Full Flavor, Light, Ultra Light, self
reported) used in the past 30 days. Separate
analyses were conducted on three age
groups: 12­17 years (n = 2290), 18­25 years
(n = 7321), and 26+ years (n = 5238).
Analyses accounted for survey design char-
acteristics and percentages were weighted to
the US population.
Figure 1 shows the top five varieties in
each age group. Marlboro Lights were the
most popular brand style in all three age
categories. The popularity of Marlboro Full
Flavor (FF) decreased with age, as did
Newport FF. Marlboro Ultra-Light was not
as popular with the youngest respondents.
Overall, Marlboro brands held 50.6% of the
youngest smokers, 53.5% of the young adult
smokers, but only 37.8% of the older adult
smokers. The relationship of Newport use
with age was more striking--24.6% for 12­17
year olds, 17.8% of 18­25 year olds, and 7.0%
of 26+ year olds smoked Newports. Camel
Lights and Newport Lights varieties were
much more popular among youths than
among older smokers. Newport was the
dominant brand among African American
smokers under age 26. Among 12­17 year
olds, 54.1% smoked Newport FF and 13.5%
smoke Newport Lights, while among 18­25
year olds, 70.6% smoke Newport FF and 9.1%
smoke Newport Lights. By contrast, only
36.7% of African Americans over age 26
smoked Newport FF and 4.2% smoked
Newport Lights. Doral Lights and Basic FF
and Lights together accounted for 9% of the
adult market, yet were practically non-exis-
tent in the youth market (,1%).
It appears that Marlboro Light is the most
popular brand style among younger smokers
in the USA. Marlboro Full Flavor and
Newport Full Flavor are quite popular, with
Camel less so. Five of the top nine varieties in
all three age categories are Lights or Ultra-
Lights, though the specific varieties varied by
age. Discounted brands (Doral and Basic)
account for a sizable percentage of the adult
market but a miniscule percentage of the
youth market. The youth market in the USA
appears dominated by varieties of the major
advertised brands; other products make up a
more modest percentage of the market.
Conversely, the adult market is much more
diffuse, with the major varieties commanding
smaller overall percentages of the market.
Light varieties appear to be popular choices
for younger smokers. Similar investigations
in other countries could shed further light on
younger smokers' brand choices, particularly
in those countries that have banned descrip-
tors such as ``Light'' and ``Mild''.

Cigarette taxes and their
proposed uses: support among
smokers and non-smokers in
different income groups in Texas
The Texas Legislature is considering new
taxes, including a proposed $1 per pack tax
on cigarettes. In the past, various issues have
been raised in debates on this topic.1 2
Proponents cite evidence that increased taxes
deter young people from using tobacco3­5 and
argue that additional revenues can be used to
provide health care services for children
and to support smoking prevention pro-
grammes.6 7 Opponents argue that higher
tobacco taxes place an unfair burden on
smokers in low income groups.8­10
To gain insight into how Texans view new
cigarette taxes, data from a statewide tele-
phone survey (random digit dialling of work-
ing residential numbers) of 6345 adults were
analysed. The survey was conducted between
October and December 2004. Participants
were asked whether they support a $1 per
pack increase in cigarettes taxes. They were
also asked about the use of these taxes to
provide funds for children's health care and
programmes to prevent tobacco use among
young people. To learn how views differed
between those who use tobacco and those
who do not, as well as between those in
different income groups, participants were
also asked about their own tobacco use and
their household income.
About 6000 usable responses were avail-
able for different analyses. Current smokers
made up 17% of the sample, and 35% of
smokers reported household incomes below
$25 000 per year. Among all respondents,
65% favoured a $1 per pack increase in
cigarette taxes. Support for the $1 per pack
increase grows when the taxes are to be used
partly for preventing young people from
smoking (77%) or to help provide health
insurance for children in low income families
(75%). Smokers and non-smokers differed
notably in their opinions, and there were also
significant differences between income
groups, as shown in fig 1. Confidence
intervals are ¡2% or less except in the low
income group of smokers, where they are
approximately ¡5% because of the smaller
sample size.
Among non-smokers, support for a $1 per
pack tax rises significantly when its proposed
uses include smoking prevention and chil-
dren's health insurance. When the use is not
specified, higher income non-smokers are
more likely to favour the tax than low income
non-smokers (71% v 67%, p , 0.05). When a
specified use is smoking prevention, the level
of support is 82% among non-smokers in
both income groups. However, when a
specified use is health insurance for children
in low income families, support is weaker
among higher income non-smokers than
among low income non-smokers (77% v
83%, p , 0.01).
Among smokers, support for the $1 tax was
dramatically affected by its proposed use.
When the use was not specified, support was
low (17% and 23%) among higher and low
income groups. However, when smokers
considered proposed uses for smoking pre-
vention and children's health insurance,
levels of support among the higher and low
income groups, respectively, increased to 48%
and 59% with prevention use and to 53% and
67% with child health use. Interestingly,
when the proposed uses were for prevention
or health insurance for children in low
income families, support for a $1 tax was
significantly greater among smokers in the
low income group than among those in the
higher income group (p , 0.01).

What was ``light'' and ``mild'' is
now ``smooth'' and ``fine'': new
labelling of Australian cigarettes
We have just discovered (February 2005) a
new ``premium'' sideline of Australia's sec-
ond largest selling brand, Peter Jackson. The
new members of the Peter Jackson ``brand
family'' come in black, grey, and white packs,
respectively, labelled ``full flavour'', ``smooth
flavour'', and ``fine flavour''. We believe this
is an industry response to a looming ban on
``light'' and ``mild'' descriptors.
The Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission (ACCC) has investigated
whether ``light'' and ``mild'' descriptors
breach the Commonwealth Trade Practices
Act. It has told Parliament that it believes the
industry has been involved in misleading and
deceptive conduct, and that it is negotiating a
settlement with the three manufacturers.
We know that large numbers of Australian
smokers continue to believe that ``light'' and
``mild'' cigarettes provide relative health
benefits.1 Although product promotions are
now tightly restricted, Australian smokers
continue to be lured with what is probably
the largest and most complex variety in the
world of ``milds'' (the term Australian man-
ufacturers prefer),2 3 all designed to create a
compelling illusion of reduced harm.4
Major Australian brand families typically
have six notional strength variants, based on
Commonwealth labelling regulations: ``1 mg
or less'', ``2 mg or less'', ``4 mg or less'',
``8 mg or less'', ``12 mg or less'', and ``16 mg
or less''. Government mandated information
on the side of each pack includes notional tar,
nicotine, and carbon monoxide yields in
these six ``tar bands''. This is scheduled for
replacement by qualitative information in
March 2006, when new Commonwealth
labelling regulations come into force. The
industry also differentiates variants with
various ``mild'' descriptors and/or more pro-
minent use of the ``tar band'' figure. It is
unclear whether the industry will be able to
use notional tar figures once ``light'' and
``mild'' descriptors are prohibited.
Current industry conduct demonstrates
that tar yields are very important to it. The
most recent Australian Retail Tobacconist has a
cover advertisement for leading ``budget''
brand, Horizon, informing retailers:
Now your Horizon customers can get
their favourite brand in an exciting
new look pack. With new descriptors
and clearer numbers all our packs
are much easier to identify. Research
proves that your customers will find
the new pack more appealing and a
lot easier to recognize.5
Moreover, a number of brands are labelled
with notional tar yields not listed in the
labelling regulations. For example, Marlboro
Lights and Winfield Special Mild 6 are both
labelled as ``6 mg or less''. Trade promotional
material for Winfield Special Mild 6 indicated
that the ``6 mg or less'' notional tar yield was
intended to attract smokers of the ``8 mg or
less'' variant of Winfield interested in switch-
ing to a lower yield brand.6
The new Peter Jackson Select Blend varieties
push the envelope by combining innovative
verbal descriptors with non-prescribed notional
tar yields. ``Full flavour'' is labelled ``9 mg or
less'', ``smooth flavour'' is labelled ``6 mg or
less'', and ``fine flavour'' is labelled ``3 mg or
less''. The backs of the packs describe the
varieties as respectively delivering a ``rich, full-
flavoured smoking experience'', ``an extra
smooth smoking experience'', and ``a more
refined smoking experience''. This language
does not suggest gradation in risk as clearly as
``mild'',``extramild'',and``ultramild'',butlink-
ing these terms and visual imagery suggesting
differential experience to tar yields will build
belief that ``smooth'' and ``fine'' mean ``safer''.
If the industry can make ``smooth'' and
``fine'' effective replacements for ``light'' and
``mild'', we will lose some of the potential
public health benefit from prohibiting the
latter descriptors and removing ISO tar
yields. There is a strong need for improved
monitoring of industry responses to efforts to
end the ``lights'' and ``milds'' deception, as
well as for increased political will to prevent

Banning smoking in public places
This book is simultaneously depressing and
reassuring for people involved in the battle to
remove environmental tobacco smoke from
public places. The tactics used to oppose a
bylaw requiring all public places, including
bars, to be smoke-free in Greater Victoria in
Canada in the late 1990s are depressingly
familiar to those currently fighting for
smoke-free bars in Australia. On the other
hand, it is reassuring that the opposition does
not seem to have developed any new strate-
gies, their moves becoming increasingly
predictable.
For that reason, this is an excellent tool for
people trying to bring about tobacco control
through legislation and public policy and will
provide a good insight for people working in
other areas of public health. While the
players in this story are very specific to
Greater Victoria, Canada, the logistics of the
campaign strategy are almost universally
applicable. The tactics used to oppose tobacco
control are global and the lessons learned
from this campaign are worth sharing with
the international tobacco control community.
Smoke-free has been written by a journalist,
Barbara McLintock, so it is a comfortable,
easy to read story. Those who want more
academic details of the campaign, with
statistics, evaluation, and analysis, can find
that in journal articles published elsewhere.
The value of this book is the insight into the
power struggles and spheres of influence
which are the hidden drivers of legislative
change.
It also puts a human face on the battle and
reinforces the need to support staff given the
unenviable job of enforcing tobacco control
policies among people who do not want
them. I have to admit that I found the
description of the aggressive hostility against
the Capital Health Region staff, orchestrated
by some of the bar owners, confronting and
wondered what provision has been made in
Australia to deal with the possibility of such
tactics.
But it is those details which make the book
a very powerful blueprint for what is needed
to bring about effective policy change. The
growing acceptance of anti-smoking strate-
gies by the general community has not
removed all the heat from the issue and the
battle does not end with the passing of
legislation. The need for strong leadership
and a commitment to resources to enforce
the legislation once it is in place may well
continue for a number of years.
