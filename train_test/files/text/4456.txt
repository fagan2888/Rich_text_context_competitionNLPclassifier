Abstract
Objective: This study was performed to identify risk factors for postoperative rectovaginal
fistula (PRF) in patients with deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE).
Methods: Data were retrospectively obtained from the medical records of 104 patients with
DIE, and statistical analysis was used to detect risk factors for PRF.
Results: Five of 104 (4.8%) patients developed PRF from 5 to 16 days postoperatively. The
operative procedures included 84 (80.8%) superficial excisions, 6 (5.8%) full-thickness disc exci-
sions, and 14 (13.5%) bowel resections. Most lesions were located in the cul-de-sac, and the
mean lesion size was 2.6 cm (range, 0.5­7.0 cm). The univariate analysis showed that lesion
location, larger lesion size, and surgical technique were statistically significant risk factors for PRF.
Conclusion: Surgical procedures should be very carefully executed in patients with DIE lesions
of !4 cm.

Introduction
Endometriosis is a common benign gyneco-
logical condition that is defined as the pres-
ence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus
and affects about 10% to 15% of women of
childbearing age.1 About 5.3% to 12.0% of
patients with endometriosis2 develop deeply
infiltrating endometriosis (DIE), which is
characterized by a solid mass that is situated
deeper than 5 mm under the peritoneum
and mainly involves the rectum, bladder,
ureter, and uterosacral ligament.
Although some patients with endometri-
osis are asymptomatic, such as patients
with ureteral endometriosis,3 most patients
develop severe dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia,
rectorrhagia, diarrhea, and defecation
pain.4 All of these symptoms substantially
impair patients' psychological and social
function, and decrease their quality of life.
Besides the unbearable pain associated with
endometriosis, infertility is also a common
reason for affected women to consult clin-
ics.6,7 Up to 50% of infertile women report-
edly have endometriosis. Studies have
revealed that women with endometriosis
are at high risk for anxiety and depressive
symptoms.8,9
Because the pathogenesis of DIE is still
unclear10,11 and the European Society of
Human Reproduction and Embryology
guidelines clearly state that no specific med-
ication with which to resolve the disease-
related symptoms is available,12 complete
lesion excision is usually performed and
has been shown to notably improve
patients' quality of life.13,14 Thus, surgery
is considered the first-line and gold stan-
dard treatment for DIE.15,16 The surgical
procedure can be very complex because of
the high risk of bowel and urinary tract
involvement in this disease.17 The most
worrisome complication associated with
the surgical treatment of DIE is the devel-
opment of a postoperative rectovaginal fis-
tula (PRF), which is defined as an abnormal
connection between the rectum and
vagina.18 The reported occurrence rate of
PRF after surgical treatment of DIE
ranges from 2.9% to 10.6%.16,19 Patients
with PRF may require longer hospitaliza-
tion, experience slower recovery to work,
and have a higher risk of the need for mul-
tiple surgical repairs.
Studies of the risk factors for PRF have
not generated a consensus opinion to date,
although it has been reported that a higher
number of radical surgeries performed
increases the risk of PRF.2 However,
which factors may truly contribute to
PRF remains unclear.
Therefore, the aim of the current study
was to explore the clinical characteristics of
this postoperative complication and analyze
the risk factors for PRF in patients with
DIE in our single university-based tertiary
hospital.
Materials and methods
This retrospective cohort study involved
104 patients diagnosed with DIE from
January 2013 to October 2014 at the
Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of
Fudan University, Shanghai, China. This
study was approved by the institutional
ethics board of our hospital. All patients
who participated in the study provided
verbal informed consent.
The patients' medical records were
reviewed to obtain data on their presurgical
treatments and surgical information, demo-
graphics, body mass index (BMI), preoper-
ative and postoperative visual analogue
scale (VAS) score, and recovery
information.
Preoperative assessment
Records of the patients' rectovaginal exam-
ination, transvaginal ultrasonography, and
pelvic magnetic resonance imaging findings
were collected to assess the extension of the
Zheng et al. 853
DIE lesions. Colonoscopy was performed
in selected patients with severe bowel symp-
toms such as cyclic constipation, dyschezia,
or hematochezia.
Decisions regarding operations were
made cautiously and involved the whole
medical team, including gynecologic, gas-
trointestinal, and urological surgeons.
Because no standard criteria have been
established, the choice of the surgical tech-
nique depended on the surgeons' experience
and patients' preference. Generally, both
patients and doctors preferred the least
aggressive surgery that might remove most
of the lesion.
Surgical procedure
The operative route was either laparoscopy
or laparotomy according to the consensus of
the whole medical team. The different surgi-
cal techniques used were as followings:20
1. Simple lesion cut (SLC): superficial shav-
ing, excision, or shaving of serosal and
subserosal bowel endometriosis without
opening of the bowel wall.
2. Full-thickness disc excision (FDE): exci-
sion of bowel endometriosis with a small
opening followed by closure of the bowel
wall.
3. Bowel resection and anastomosis (BRA):
resection of a bowel segment affected by
endometriosis followed by stapling
together of the two remaining ends.
4. Ileostomy: resection of a bowel segment
followed by attachment of the small
intestine to the abdominal wall to
bypass the large intestine.
Diagnosis of DIE
The diagnosis of DIE was confirmed both
clinically and pathologically based on the
following criteria: 1) typical symptoms
(cyclic pelvic pain, infertility, etc.) and a
suspicious nodule with tenderness found
on physical examination, 2) a blue or
brown lesion infiltrating >5 mm beneath
the peritoneum as observed by at least
two experienced surgeons during the sur-
gery, and 3) confirmation of the diagnosis
of endometriosis by two independent gyne-
cological pathologists (N.Y. and Z.X.).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with
SPSS software, version 19.0 (IBM Corp.,
Armonk, NY, USA), and P value <0.05
was considered statistically significant.
Student's t test was performed for continu-
ous variables, and the chi-square test (or
Fisher's exact test when appropriate) was
performed for categorical variables.
Results
Clinical characteristics
The demographic characteristics, symp-
toms, and presurgical treatment of the 104
patients are summarized in Table 1. The
mean age was 35.1 Æ 6.2 years (range, 20­
52 years), and the mean BMI was 21.0
Æ 2.2 kg/m2 (range, 16.1­28.0 kg/m2). Most
patients complained of dysmenorrhea
(71/104, 68.27%), followed by tenesmus
(24/104, 23.08%), dyspareunia (17/104,
16.35%), and other symptoms. The mean
VAS score before surgery was 5.83 (range,
0­10). Most of the patients experienced
long-term symptoms; the mean duration of
symptoms was 36.4 months (range, 1­180
months). Eleven (10.58%) patients had
undergone a previous surgery for endome-
triosis, and 56/104 (53.8%) had received
conservative treatment before surgery,
including a gonadotropin-releasing hor-
mone agonist (GnRH-a) (17/104, 16.35%),
traditional Chinese medicine (19/104,
18.27%), and other treatments.

Surgical findings
In total, 99 (95.2%) patients underwent lap-
aroscopic surgery, 4 underwent laparotomy
because severe pelvic adhesion was pre-
dicted, and 3 underwent vaginal surgery
(among the latter, 2 underwent vaginally
assisted laparoscopic surgery). Three of 99
the laparoscopic procedures were converted
to laparotomy because of unexpectedly
severe pelvic adhesion. The mean operation
time was 148.4 minutes (range, 24­440 min)
with a mean blood loss of 195.9 ml (range,
20­1400 ml). The operative techniques
included 84 SLCs, 6 FDEs, 10 BRAs, and
4 ileostomies. An ovarian endometrioid
cyst was the most common accompanying
disease, with an occurrence rate of 46.1%
(48/104).
DIE lesions
The mean DIE lesion size was 2.6 cm
(range, 0.5­7.0 cm) as measured intraoper-
atively. The cul-de-sac was involved in all
patients; other common sites of involve-
ment were the rectum/intestine (23/104,
22.1%) and ureter (14/104, 13.5%).
Thirty-two patients (30.8%) had multiple
DIE lesions (Table 1). To investigate the
lesion locations in more detail, we divided
the cul-de-sac into a central area and a lat-
eral area coronally; the involving rate in
each area was 77% and 42%, respectively.
Univariate analysis of risk factors for PRF

The clinical characteristics of these patients
are summarized in Table 2. Thus, the
patient cohort was divided into those with
a PRF (Group A) and those without a PRF
(Group B). The results of the univariate
analysis are shown in Table 3. No differ-
ences in age, BMI, surgical type, or whether
the vaginal cuff was simultaneously cut
open were found between the two groups.
Significantly more patients in Group B than
A underwent SLC [83/99 (83.8%) and 1/5
(20.0%), respectively; P ¼ 0.005]. The per-
centage of DIE lesions located only in the
cul-de-sac was higher in Group B than A
[72/99 (72.7%) and 0/5 (0.0%), respectively;
v2 ¼13.164, P ¼ 0.004]. The mean lesion size
in Group A was significantly larger than
that in Group B [4.6 cm (range, 4­7 cm)
and 2.4 cm (range, 0.5­5 cm), respectively;
T ¼ 3.255, P ¼ 0.002].
Clinical characteristics of each patient
with PRF
Case 1: A 37-year-old woman (gravidity 1
parity 1) with a 75-month history of
dysmenorrhea underwent conservative
treatment including GnRH-a, oral contra-
ception, and MirenaV
R (Bayer Oy,
Guangzhou Branch, China) before surgery.
However, her VAS score before surgery still
reached 10. Laparoscopic surgery was per-
formed, and a 4-cm lesion was found at the
cul-de-sac, which also infiltrated the ureter.
laparoscopic superficial excision was per-
formed, and a 2- Â 1- Â 1-cm lesion was
left according to the patient's desire to pre-
serve the integrity of the intestine. However,
16 days postoperatively, she felt feces exit-
ing the vagina, and a rectovaginal fistula
was confirmed by computed tomography.
The patient underwent conservative treat-
ment for the fistula.
Case 2: A 40-year-old woman (gravidity
0, parity 0) with a 50-month history of
rectal bleeding underwent treatment with
GnRH-a and gestrinone before surgery.
Her preoperative VAS score was 10.
Colonoscopy showed a narrowed ring that
extended 8 cm up to the anus, and she there-
fore underwent open surgery. A 4-cm lesion
was identified at the cul-de-sac and was
infiltrating the intestine; thus, FDE was
performed. However, 8 days postoperative-
ly, feces appeared in the drainage bag. The
patient underwent a second surgery involv-
ing BRA þ ostomy.
Case 3: A 37-year-old woman (gravidity
2, parity 1) with a 10-month history of dif-
ficult defecation had undergone an
endometriosis-related surgery 2 years previ-
ously. Colonoscopy was performed before
surgery this time. A 5- Â 6-cm mass with an
anabrotic surface was identified 5 cm from
the anus. The pathologic examination con-
firmed chronic inflammation. Because of
technical difficulties, laparoscopic surgery
was converted to open surgery. The lesion
was 7 cm in size, located at the cul-de-sac as
well as the bilateral ureterosacral ligaments,
and infiltrated all layers of the sigmoid
colon. Thus, BRA was performed, and a
scleroid drainage tube was placed in the
pelvic cavity. Five days postoperatively,
the patient felt feces partially exiting the
vagina and developed a fever. A temporary
colostomy was established for 3 months,
and the patient completely recovered.
Case 4: A 47-year-old woman (gravidity
3, parity 1) had a >10-year history of dys-
menorrhea and had experienced dyschezia
for most recent 6 months. Five years previ-
ously, she had received a GnRH-a injection
6 months preoperatively, and the dysmen-
orrhea resolved. The patient had experi-
enced dyschezia during the most recent 6
months, but no positive findings were
revealed by preoperative colonoscopy this
time. A 3-cm lesion was detected at the
preoperative physical examination.
BRA þ ostomy was performed laparoscopi-
cally. During the surgery, a 4-cm lesion was
found at the cul-de-sac and was infiltrating

then developed a fever and discharge of
pale yellow fluid with a fecal odor from
the vagina. Conservative and symptomatic
treatments were performed until discharge
from the hospital.
Case 5: A 39-year-old woman (gravidity
1, parity 0) with a 6-year history of severe
dysmenorrhea underwent treatment with
oral contraceptives, 6 months of cyclic
GnRH-a injections, and traditional
Chinese medicine. However, her symptoms
were not relieved. Colonoscopy showed
chronic mucosal inflammation 15 cm from
the anus. Physical examination revealed a
4-cm lesion at the cul-de-sac, which was con-
sistent with the surgical findings. Seven days
after BRA, the patient felt feces exiting from
the vagina and developed a fever of 38.9C.
After 2 weeks of conservative treatment, she
was discharged with a healed PRF.

anti-progestogens, and GnRH-a, and
GnRH antagonists have been widely used
for endometriosis, there is no overwhelming
evidence to support the effects of any of
these medications.12,21 In the present
study, several medical therapies were per-
formed in 56 of 104 (53.8%) patients pre-
operatively, including GnRH-a injection,
oral contraception, gestrinone, danazol,
and MirenaV
R , but it seemed unlikely that
the patients benefited from these medical
therapies. To obtain long-term outcomes
of pain relief and fertility, surgery is still
regarded as the first-choice treatment for
DIE,22 especially for endometriosis that
has deeply infiltrated the bowel.23,24
However, postoperative complications
are a great challenge for surgeons and can
be divided into two categories: major and
minor complications. The former include
rectovaginal fistulas, bowel leakage, severe
infection, and large blood loss volumes,
while the latter include temporary intestinal
and urinary dysfunction and superficial
infection.25 Most patients with PRF experi-
ence malodorous vaginal discharge, fever,
and lower abdominal pain, which slow
their postoperative recovery while increas-
ing their costs and hospitalization dura-
tion.26 The reported incidence of PRF
among patients who have undergone DIE-
related surgeries ranges from 2.9% to
10.6%.2,27­29 In the present study, 5
(4.8%) of 104 patients who underwent sur-
gical treatment of DIE in our single tertiary
hospital developed PRF from 5 to 16 days
postoperatively.
Belghiti et al.29 found that DIE lesions
more commonly involved the vagina in
patients with than without PRF [8/9
(89%) vs. 55/189 (29%), respectively;
P<0.001]. In the present study, all lesions
were located at least in the cul-de-sac. For
those who developed PRF, the rectum and/
or ureter was also involved, while 72 of 99
(72.7%) patients without PRF had lesions
located only in the cul-de-sac (P ¼ 0.004).
Not enough evidence is yet available to con-
clude that the location of DIE lesions is an
independent risk factor for PRF.
Tarjanne et al.30 found that among
patients with DIE who underwent colorec-
tal resection, more major complications
occurred in patients with nodules of >4
than 4 cm [12/68 (10%) vs. 6/87 (7%),
respectively; P ¼ 0.04]. Interestingly, in the
present study, the univariate analysis
showed that a larger lesion size was a pos-
sible risk factor for PRF (P ¼ 0.002).
Inappropriate use of energy instruments
may reportedly increase the risk of PRF.
Darai et al.31 reported that two of six
PRFs developed as a result of electrocoagu-
lation. In the current study, although the
rate of using energy instruments was
higher in patients with than without PRF,
there was no significant difference between
the two groups [5/5 (100.0%) vs. 87/99
(87.8%), respectively].
No consensus regarding the choice of
surgical procedures in treating DIE has
yet been reached.32 All surgeries can be
divided into two categories: conservative
(including SLC and FDE) and radical
(BRA and/or ostomy).33,34 Whether conser-
vative surgeries would be more suitable for
bowel endometriosis is controversial.35
Although previous studies have shown
that radical surgeries could more substan-
tially improve patients' quality of life,26,36
they are associated with a greater risk of
postoperative complications. Mohr et al.37
reported that the complication rate of shav-
ing, disc excision, and segmental resection
was 6%, 23%, and 38%, respectively.
Kondo et al.38 and Maytham et al.39
showed similar results. However, Roman
et al.40 reported more postoperative compli-
cations in the conservative than radical sur-
gery group [25/51 (49.0%) vs. 10/24
(41.6%), respectively]. Koh et al.22 reported
similar findings for patients undergoing disc
resection; they found that segmental resec-
tion may not increase the risk of
860 Journal of International Medical Research 46(2)
complications [8/71 (11.3%) vs. 5/29
(17.2%), respectively]. In our cohort, the
univariate analysis revealed that conserva-
tive surgery was associated with a lower risk
of PRF (P ¼ 0.005).
Belghiti et al.28 reported that colpectomy
might increase the incidence of PRF
because the proportion of patients who
underwent colpectomy was higher in the
PRF group than in the control [8/9 (89%)
vs. 55/189 (29%), respectively; P<0.001]. In
the present study, we found that 4 of 5
(80.0%) patients with PRF had undergone
colpectomy, while only 46 of 99 (46.5%)
patients without PRF had undergone this
surgery. Although the difference between
the two groups was not statistically signifi-
cant, we still suggest that colpectomy
should be executed with great caution in
highly selected patients.
Jelenc et al.41 found that 2 of 52 patients
with DIE developed PRF and that both of
them had undergone concomitant vaginal
and rectal resection without protective
ileostomy. Whether a protective ileostomy
can truly prevent PRF remains unclear.
Moreover, a temporary colostomy would
be very invasive for patients with benign
disease.42 Milone et al.43 conducted a pro-
spective multicenter case-control study
involving 90 patients with bowel DIE.
More ileostomies were performed in
patients without than with complications
(18/68 vs. 4/22, respectively). In the present
study, we found that only one of four
patients who underwent BRA with prophy-
lactic ileostomy developed PRF.
Some scholars have mentioned that the
surgeon's experience may influence the
development of complications both intrao-
peratively and postoperatively. Dubernard
et al.19 reported that 9 of 58 (15.5%)
patients developed postoperative complica-
tions, which was a relatively higher rate
than in other studies. They considered
that a lack of experience in laparoscopic
colorectal resection for endometriosis was
a possible reason for this high rate.
Actually, when treating DIE, a multidisci-
plinary team comprising gynecologists,
urologists, and general surgeons should
work together in a specific center.44,45
Radiological assessment is also quite
important to assess the disease.46
Fortunately, all patients in our cohort
underwent their operations by the same sur-
gical team, which might have reduced bias
and allowed for consistency in the diagnosis
and management of DIE.
In summary, we suggest great caution in
treating patients with large DIE lesions.
Because of its retrospective nature, this
study has some inherent limitations such
as recall bias, selection bias, and others. A
prospective study with more patients will be
necessary to draw more solid conclusions.
Moreover, specialized centers with multidis-
ciplinary collaboration involving radiolog-
ists and a surgical team with an experienced
urological surgeon and/or gastrointestinal
surgeon would be quite essential in treating
patients with DIE. Additionally, adequate
communication before surgery should be
ensured, and patients should be fully
informed of the risk of potentially severe
complications such as PRF.
