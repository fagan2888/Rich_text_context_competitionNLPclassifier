Objectives: To assess cardiorespiratory fitness levels in
youth aged 12 to 19 years and to examine associations
between fitness and age, sex, race/ethnicity, and self-
reported physical activity in this age group.
Design: Cross-sectional study.
Setting: The National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey's mobile examination center, throughout the
United States from 1999-2002.
Participants: A representative sample of 4732 youth aged
12 to 19 years was examined; 3287 completed the tread-
mill test and were included in the analysis. The Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics conducted the survey.
Main Exposures: Age, sex, race/ethnicity, weight sta-
tus, self-reported physical activity, and television viewing.
Main Outcome Measure: Estimated maximal oxy-
gen uptake (V
 O2max
) determined by a submaximal
treadmill exercise test.
Results: Estimated V
 O2max
(mL·kg-1·min-1) was higher
inmales(mean±SE,46.4±0.4)thaninfemales(mean±SE,
38.7±0.3) but did not differ across race/ethnicity
groups. Among males, older participants had higher
V
 O2max
values, while in females, younger participants had
higher values. For both males and females, those in the
normal weight group had higher fitness levels than those
in the at risk for overweight and overweight groups. Ap-
proximately one third of both males and females failed
to meet recommended standards for cardiorespiratory
fitness.
Conclusions: In US youth, cardiorespiratory fitness is
lower in males and females who are overweight than in
those of normal weight, but fitness is not related to race/
ethnicity. Youth who have low levels of physical activ-
ity and high levels of sedentary behavior are also more
likely to have lower cardiorespiratory fitness.

IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS,
cardiorespiratory fitness is in-
versely associated with physi-
ologic risk factors for chronic
disease including high blood
pressure,1 hyperinsulinemia,2 fat mass,3
atherogenic lipid profile,4 insulin resis-
tance,5 hemostaticandinflammatorymark-
ers,6 and clustering of metabolic risk fac-
tors.7 Also, higher levels of fitness support
participation in sports and other physi-
cally demanding leisure activities. Attain-
ment of fitness standards is a common pre-
requisite for entry into occupations such
as law enforcement, firefighting, the mili-
tary, and many other jobs that involve
physically demanding labor.8,9
Between the 1950s and the 1980s, sur-
veys of physical fitness were conducted
regularly in the US population of children
and adolescents.10 During each of those 4
decades, the President's Council on Physi-
cal Fitness and Sports sponsored national
surveys of youth physical fitness.10,11 Also,
in the 1980s, the National Children and
Youth Fitness Study was conducted un-
der the auspices of the US Department of
Health and Human Services.12,13 Both the
National Children and Youth Fitness Study
and the various President's Council on
Physical Fitness and Sports surveys used
field measures of physical fitness.10,12,13 The
1966-1970 Health Examination Survey
Cycle III included a treadmill exercise test
for 12- to 17-year-olds to measure cardio-
respiratory fitness.14,15
Obesity rates in US children and ado-
lescents have increased dramatically since
the 1980s,16,17 and it seems likely that de-
creased physical activity is a major factor
explaining that trend.18,19 If contempo-
rary American youth are fatter and less ac-

tive than previous generations, it is possible that physi-
cal fitness has also declined in this population. A key
component of overall physical fitness is cardiorespira-
tory endurance.19 Between 1999 and 2002, the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES)
included a measure of cardiorespiratory fitness, which
was administered to participants between ages 12 and 49
years. The purpose of this article is to present findings
of NHANES for youth between ages 12 and 19 years.
Associations between cardiorespiratory fitness and
demographic characteristics will be reported as well as
associations with select self-reported physical activity
behaviors.
METHODS
SURVEY DESIGN AND STUDY POPULATION
The NHANES is designed to monitor the health and nutri-
tional status of the US civilian, noninstitutionalized popula-
tion. The surveys are conducted by the National Center for
Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention.20 Since 1999, a nationally representative sample has
been selected annually using a stratified multistage probabil-
ity cluster sample design. Data are released in 2-year periods
(eg, 1999-2000, 2001-2002). Mexican American and black in-
dividuals, adolescents aged 12 to 19 years, persons 60 years and
older, low-income white individuals, and pregnant women were
oversampled in 1999-2002 to allow for more precise estimates
for these groups. This report is based on data from the 1999-
2002 NHANES.21,22 The 1999-2002 NHANES protocol was ap-
proved by the National Center for Health Statistics institu-
tional review board, and written informed consent was obtained
from all participants 18 years and older. In addition to the con-
sent provided by parents or guardians, written informed as-
sent was also obtained for adolescents younger than 18 years.
SUBJECTS
The NHANES protocol consists of a household interview fol-
lowed by an examination at a mobile examination center. In
1999-2002, 4902 individuals aged 12 to 19 years were inter-
viewed at home, and of these, 4732 individuals (97%) were ex-
amined at the mobile examination center. Of those, 522 (11%)
were excluded from the fitness test for a variety of reasons, in-
cluding pregnancy, physical limitations, and cardiovascular and
asthma conditions or symptoms.23 Of those eligible to partici-
pate in the fitness test, 923 (20%) did not have their fitness level
estimated for a variety of reasons, including insufficient time
to conduct the test, refusal, equipment problems, prematurely
terminated tests because of safety concerns, and insufficient heart
rate response to classify fitness level (ie, the change in heart
rate between the 2 exercise stages was less than 8 beats/min).
Complete fitness data on 3287 individuals (69%) are included
in the present analyses. Sex, race/ethnicity, age, body mass in-
dex (BMI) (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height
in meters squared), and activity levels of this analytic sample
were comparable with the overall sample that was examined
in the mobile examination center (Table 1).
CARDIORESPIRATORY FITNESS TEST
Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed by a submaximal tread-
mill exercise test. The treadmill test consisted of a 2-minute
warm-up, followed by two 3-minute work stages, and a 2-minute
cooldown period. Blood pressure, rating of perceived exer-
tion,24 and heart rate were obtained during each of the stages.
The Jackson nonexercise test formula was used to predict each
participant's fitness level prior to the treadmill test, based on
his or her age, sex, BMI, and self-reported physical activity level.25
From this prediction, 1 of the 8 protocols was selected for each
participant.23 The goal of the test was to elicit a heart rate that
is approximately 80% of age-predicted maximum (220-age)
by the end of the second exercise stage.23
The main outcome of the cardiorespiratory fitness test is es-
timated maximal oxygen uptake (V
 O2max
). It was estimated by
extrapolation to an expected age-specific maximal heart rate us-
ing measured heart rate responses to the two 3-minute exercise
stages.26 It was assumed that the relationship between heart rate
and oxygen consumption is linear during treadmill exercise. Be-
cause true V
 O2max
values greater than 75 mL·kg-1·min-1 are quite
rare, we assumed such values to be overestimates and they were
coded as 75 mL·kg-1·min-1 in the analysis (n=29). Equipment
included a Quinton MedTrack ST65 Treadmill (Quinton, Deer-
field,Wis)andaColinSTBP-780AutomaticBloodPressureMoni-
tor (Colin Medical Instruments Corp, San Antonio, Tex) to mea-
sure heart rate and blood pressure. All technicians were trained
by exercise physiologists from the Cooper Institute, were moni-
tored twice a year, and participated in an annual retraining ses-
sion to assure quality control.

COVARIATES
Demographic Variables
Participants were placed in 4 age groups: 12 to 13, 14 to 15, 16
to 17, and 18 to 19 years of age. Self-reported information on
race and ethnicity was categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, Mexican American, and other. Because of the
small sample size of the "other" group, no separate estimates
were presented for persons classified as "other," but they are
included in the total population estimates. Measured weight
and height were used to calculate BMI. The 2000 Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention Growth Charts for the United
States were used to define normal weight, at risk for over-
weight, and overweight.27 Normal weight is defined as less than
the 85th percentile of BMI for age, at risk for overweight is de-
fined as at or higher than the 85th percentile but less than the
95th percentile of BMI for age, and overweight is defined as at
or higher than the 95th percentile of BMI for age.
Physical Activity Variables
Self-reported physical activity variables were dichotomized into
yes or no for activities performed during the last 30 days. The
activities included walking or biking as part of getting to and
from work, school, or errands; moderate-intensity physical ac-
tivities performed for at least 10 minutes that cause light sweat-
ing or slight to moderate increase in breathing or heart rate;
vigorous-intensity physical activities performed for at least 10
minutes that cause heavy sweating or large increases in breath-
ing or heart rate; and physical activities specifically designed
to strengthen muscles, such as lifting weights, push-ups, or sit-
ups. Additionally, participants were asked if their amount of
activity during the past 30 days was more, less, or about the
same as others of the same age and sex.
Sedentary activity questions differed by age group. Partici-
pants aged 16 to 19 years reported the amount of time on a typi-
cal day during the past 30 days that they spent sitting and watch-
ing television or videos or using a computer outside of work.
Children aged 12 to 15 years were asked about television view-
ing and computer use/computer games separately, in refer-
ence to the previous day. The 2 questions were summed. Re-
sponses were dichotomized into fewer than 3 hours and 3 or
more hours per day.
Participants were also asked to identify the type, frequency,
and duration of moderate and vigorous physical activities they
participatedinduringthepast30days.Allreportedactivitieswere
assigned a MET (metabolic equivalent unit) (1 MET=3.5 mL
O2
·kg-1·min-1) value based on reported intensity.28 The number
of times an activity was performed was multiplied by the num-
ber of minutes and the MET value. The total MET score was then
divided by 30 to obtain MET minutes per day for each reported
activity. To correct for gross errors, reported frequency and du-
ration higher than the 99th percentile (90 times per 30 days and
240 minutes each time, respectively) were coded to 90 and 240,
respectively, for the analysis. MET minutes of moderate to vig-
orous physical activity (MVPA) were calculated by totaling ac-
tivities with a MET value of 3 or more. MET minutes of vigorous
physical activity (VPA) were calculated by totaling the activities
with a MET value of 6 or more. Participants received a score of
zero if they did not report any individual activity and responded
no to participation in moderate physical activity or VPA during
the past 30 days (n=503 [15.3%] for MVPA; n=824 [25.1%] for
VPA). Participants were categorized into tertiles (low, interme-
diate, high) of MVPA and VPA for analyses.
Participants were classified into 2 fitness levels based on the
FITNESSGRAM Standards for Healthy Fitness Zone.29,30 Males
aged 12 to 19 years with a V
 O2max
of 42 mL·kg-1·min-1 or higher
were classified as meeting the FITNESSGRAM standards. Girls
aged 12 and 13 years with a V
 O2max
of 37 and 36 mL·kg-1·min-1,
respectively, were classified as meeting the FITNESSGRAM stan-
dards. Females aged 14 to 19 with a V
 O2max
of 35 mL·kg-1·min-1
or higher were classified as meeting the FITNESSGRAM stan-
dards.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
All analyses were conducted separately for males and females.
Means and deciles of estimated V
 O2max
were calculated for 4
age groups. One-way analyses of variance using estimated V
 O2max
as the dependent variable were conducted for demographic,
weight status, and physical activity variables and by tertiles of
MET minutes of physical activity. The trends of V
 O2max
by ter-
tiles of MET minutes of MVPA and VPA were also tested. Sample
weights were used to account for differential probabilities of
selection, noncoverage, and nonresponse to the examina-
tion.31 Standard errors were calculated using the Taylor series
linearization method. Statistical significance was defined as
=.05. Paired comparisons were done within each category
when the testing for analysis of variance was significant. The
Bonferroni method was used to adjust for multiple compari-
sons. Thus, for age group comparisons, =.008 was used and
for weight status, MVPA, and VPA, =.017 was used for sig-
nificance level. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS
for Windows32 and SUDAAN.33
RESULTS
Percentiles for estimated V
 O2max
are presented in Table 2
by sex and age group. Generally, among males, older par-
ticipants had higher V
 O2max
values, while in females,
younger participants had higher values.
Estimated V
 O2max
is presented by demographic groups,
weight status, and FITNESSGRAM categories in Table 3.
Estimated V
 O2max
was higher in males than females. In
males, estimated V
 O2max
was significantly lower in 12-
and 13-year-olds than in the other age groups. Males in
the normal weight group had significantly higher esti-
mated V
 O2max
than those in the at risk for overweight and
overweight groups, and a higher percentage of older males
(aged 14-19 years) than younger males (aged 12-13 years)
met the FITNESSGRAM standards. In females, esti-
mated V
 O2max
was significantly lower in older females
(aged 18-19 years) than in younger females (aged 12-13
years). Females in the normal weight group had higher
estimated V
 O2max
than the females in the at risk for over-
weight and overweight groups. There were no differ-
ences among the age groups for females meeting the
FITNESSGRAM standards.
Table 4 shows the comparison of the estimated V
 O2max
among physical activity variable categories. Males who
commuted through walking or biking, participated in
VPA, or did strengthening exercise during the past 30
days were fitter than males who did not report these ac-
tivities. Females who reported walking or biking during
the past 30 days were more fit than females who did not
report walking or biking. Males and females who re-
ported fewer than 3 hours of television, video, or com-
puter use per day had higher fitness levels compared with
those who participated in 3 or more hours. Those who
considered themselves to be more active than their peers

be less active or about the same as others. For both males
and females, there was a statistically significant positive
trend for higher levels of fitness with increasing tertiles
of both MVPA and VPA.

mill exercise test. An accepted criterion measure of car-
diorespiratory fitness is maximal oxygen consumption,
V
 O2max
, measured by gas exchange during performance
of exhaustive exercise. The submaximal treadmill test used
in NHANES involves applying the slope of the heart rate
response to submaximal exercise in estimating V
 O2max
,
a procedure that has been well validated.34 As such, the
data presented in this report provide a valid character-
ization of the cardiorespiratory fitness levels of contem-
porary American youth. This information is important
because it provides a basis for monitoring future trends
in physical fitness in the population of 12- to 19-year-
old youth in the United States. In addition, these data pro-
vide population norms against which individuals and
groups of youth can be compared.
National population-based surveys in the United States
have monitored body weight status in youth since 1963.35
Recent surveys have demonstrated a marked increase in
the prevalence of obesity in young people.17,36,37 In ad-
dition, many have suggested that physical fitness has de-
clined in American youth during this same period.38 Physi-
cal fitness was surveyed in representative samples of
American youth on several occasions between the late
1950s and mid 1980s.10,12,13 Unfortunately, the proce-
dures used to measure physical fitness varied from sur-
vey to survey, and none of the previous national surveys
used controlled testing procedures such as those used in
the present survey. Consequently, it is not possible to de-
termine whether there have been population-level changes
in fitness in American youth during the past several de-
cades. However, the present study includes some infor-
mation that may bear on this issue. As shown by the data
in Table 3, weight status was associated with fitness, with
overweight and at-risk-for-overweight males and fe-
males showing lower cardiorespiratory fitness than their
normal-weight peers. This suggests that population-
level increases in the prevalence of obesity are likely to
beassociatedwithdecreasedcardiorespiratoryfitness.This
would be expected when fitness is measured with a
weight-bearing task such as treadmill walking or run-
ning, because greater weight requires more energy to be
expended at any specified speed of movement. Nonethe-
less, a clear demonstration of a secular decline in physi-
cal fitness in American youth must await the result of fu-
ture surveys using methods comparable with those used
in this and/or earlier surveys.
One method for interpreting physical fitness levels of
youth is to apply criterion-referenced standards that are

linked to functional and/or health outcomes. Such an ap-
proach is used by FITNESSGRAM, a fitness testing pro-
gram that has been used by more than 18 000 schools
and school districts nationally. The criterion-referenced
standards used by FITNESSGRAM were developed by an
expert panel, and for cardiorespiratory fitness, the stan-
dards for maximal oxygen uptakes are 42 mL·kg-1·min-1
for males and 35 to 37 mL·kg-1·min-1 (depending on age)
for females.29 When these standards are applied to the
group measured in this study, approximately 65% of both
males and females meet the standards. This indicates that
roughly one third of US youth aged 12 to 19 years fail to
meet the levels of cardiorespiratory fitness deemed ap-
propriate by experts.
The findings presented in this report confirm the fre-
quently observed sex difference in cardiorespiratory en-
durance. Mean estimated V
 O2max
was approximately 17%
lower in girls than boys in the overall sample, and the
sex difference increased with increasing age from about
11% in 12- and 13-year-olds to more than 21% in 18- and
19-year-olds. These differences are comparable with those
reported in previous surveys.14,39 The widening sex dif-
ference with increasing age was due to countervailing age-
related differences in the 2 sexes. Fitness increased with
age in males but decreased with age in females, and these
changes were statistically significant in both sexes. This
may be explained by physical developmental factors, such
as sex-related changes in lean weight and fat weight dur-
ing puberty.40 However, some studies have shown that
the sex difference in physical activity levels widens dur-
ing adolescence, so it may be that rapidly declining physi-
cal activity in females may partially explain the age-
related trends in physical fitness.41,42
In this study, fitness did not differ across the 3 race/
ethnicity groups observed. Most previous national sur-
veys of fitness in children and youth did not report data
for race/ethnicity subgroups.10,12,13 However, 1 national
survey in the 1960s did find higher cardiorespiratory fit-
ness in black youth than white youth.14 That observa-
tion is inconsistent with the findings of most studies using
smaller samples that were not nationally representative.
Several of these studies have observed higher fitness in
white than black adolescents.2,43 The present study is
unique because the sampling protocol ensured that na-
tionally representative samples of non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic black, and Mexican American males and
females were included. The findings provide no indica-
tion that cardiorespiratory fitness varied across those 3
population subgroups in 1999-2002.
In general, youth who reported higher levels of physi-
cal activity had higher levels of cardiorespiratory fit-
ness. Those who reported participating in VPA during
the past 30 days and those who were in the upper tertile
of MET minutes per day of MVPA and VPA were more
fit than other participants. Although these findings sug-
gest that higher levels of physical activity result in higher
levels of fitness, the data are cross-sectional and the di-
rection of causality cannot be determined. It may be that
young people who have higher cardiorespiratory fitness
find it easier or more enjoyable to participate in physi-
cal activity. The only exception to the activity-fitness pat-
tern was for moderate physical activity in the past 30 days;
those who reported participating in moderate physical
activity during the past 30 days did not have higher fit-
ness levels than those who did not report such activity.
This may be due to inaccuracies in the classification and
reporting of moderate activity by children and youth or
to the fact that VPA explains more of the variance in fit-
ness than moderate activity.44 In addition to a positive
relationship between physical activity and fitness, we also
observed a negative relationship between sedentary ac-
tivity and fitness. Participants who reported 3 or more
hours per day of television, video, and computer use had
lower levels of fitness than those who reported less than
3 hours of these activities. This finding differs from pre-
vious studies that found no significant relationship be-
tween television watching and fitness.45,46 The inclusion
of other electronic media, in addition to television, in the
present study may provide a more accurate estimate of
the amount of time that children and youth spend in sed-
entary activity.
The findings of this study suggest that one third of
youth aged 12 to 19 years in the United States has low
levels of cardiorespiratory fitness. Low cardiorespira-
tory fitness, a strong and independent risk factor for car-
diovascular disease,47,48 is known to track from adoles-
cence to adulthood.49,50 Further, it has been shown that
low cardiorespiratory fitness in adolescence predicts adult
body fatness,51 large-artery stiffness,52 poor lipid pro-
files,53,54 and low physical activity levels.55 Accordingly,
because highly active youth tend to manifest higher lev-
els of cardiorespiratory fitness, several expert panels have
recommended that physicians counsel pediatric and ado-
lescent patients and their parents about the importance
of meeting current physical activity guidelines.19,56,57 Iden-
tifying youth who are at elevated risk for low cardiovas-
cular fitness is important because fitness testing is im-
practical in most clinical settings. The findings of this
study suggest that youth who have high BMI, low levels
of physical activity, and high levels of sedentary behav-
ior are likely to have low cardiorespiratory fitness.
Strengths of this study include the large sample size,
the racial and ethnic diversity of the participants, and the
use of a standardized testing protocol. The use of a sub-
maximal exercise test for estimating V
 O2max
is a poten-
tial weakness of this study, because submaximal tests are
less accurate than maximal exercise tests. However, maxi-
mal exercise tests are considered impractical for use in
population-based studies. Another potential limitation
is the response rate of 69%; however, as demonstrated
in Table 1, youth included in our study sample were de-
mographically comparable with the total sample exam-
ined in the mobile examination center.
CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, estimated V
 O2max
(mL·kg-1·min-1) was
higher in males than females and lower in overweight than
normal weight youth but not different across the 3 race/
ethnic groups observed (non-Hispanic black, Mexican
American, non-Hispanic white). More physically active
youth tended to manifest higher fitness levels than those
reporting less activity. Approximately one third of males

Announcement
Trial Registration Required. In concert with the Inter-
national Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE),
Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine will re-
quire, as a condition of consideration for publication,
registration of all trials in a public trials registry (such
as http://ClinicalTrials.gov). Trials must be registered
at or before the onset of patient enrollment. This policy
applies to any clinical trial starting enrollment after
July 1, 2005. For trials that began enrollment before this
date, registration will be required by September 13, 2005,
before considering the trial for publication. The trial
registration number should be supplied at the time of
submission.
For details about this new policy, and for informa-
tion on how the ICMJE defines a clinical trial, see the
editorials by DeAngelis et al in the September 8, 2004
(2004;292:1363-1364) and June 15, 2005 (2005;293:
2927-2929) issues of JAMA. Also see the Instructions to
