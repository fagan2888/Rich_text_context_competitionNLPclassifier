Measuring Business Sector Concentration
by an Infection Model
Abstract
Results from portfolio models for credit risk tell us that loan concentration
in certain industry sectors can substantially increase the value-at-risk (VaR).
The purpose of this paper is to analyze whether a tractable "infection model"
can provide a meaningful estimate of the impact of concentration risk on the
VaR. I apply rather parsimonious data requirements, which are comparable
to those for Moody's Binomial Expansion Technique (BET) and considerably
lower than for a multi-factor model.
The infection model extends the BET model by introducing default in-
fection into the hypothetical portfolio on which the real portfolio is mapped
in order to obtain a simple solution for the VaR. The infection probability is
calibrated for a range of typical values of input parameters, which capture the
concentration of a portfolio in industry sectors, default dependencies between
exposures and their credit quality.
The accuracy of the new model is measured for test portfolios with a re-
alistic industry-sector composition, obtained from the German central credit
register. I find that a carefully calibrated infection model provides a rea-
sonably close approximation to the VaR obtained from a multi-factor model
and outperforms by far the BET model. The simulation results suggest that
the calibrated infection model promises to provide a fit-for-purpose tool to
measure concentration risk in business sectors that could be useful for risk
managers and banking supervisors alike.

Non­technical Summary
Concentration risk in business sectors is widely perceived to be one of the most im-
portant causes of major problems in banks. The empirical challenges in estimating
asset correlations for a multi-factor model and the computational burden of calcu-
lating the value-at-risk of large credit portfolios by Monte Carlo simulations inspire
research for more tractable models which pose less severe data requirements.
The "Binomial Expansion Technique", developed by Moody's constitutes a simple
approach to measure risk in heterogeneous credit portfolios. As shown in this paper,
it fails, however, in producing a reasonably accurate value-at-risk in the presence of
material default correlations.
In this paper the infection model by Davis und Lo (2001) is applied and the param-
eter "infection probability" is determined in such a way that the loss distribution is
calibrated to that of a multi-factor model in the adverse 99.9% quantile of the loss
distribution. In this way the impact of the asset correlation on the value-at-risk is
captured by the infection probability.
The calibrated model allows to determine the value-at-risk of a credit portfolio based
on quite parsimonious data requirements and without the need to run Monte Carlo
simulations. The only input data which are required are the following four parame-
ters: the average default probability of a loan portfolio, sector­weighted average
intra­sector and inter­sector asset correlations, and the Hirschmann-Herfindahl-
Index, calculated from the aggregate sector exposures.
The evaluation of the calibrated infection model is based on relative errors in the
value-at-risk for a wide range of realistic default probabilities and asset correlations.
The median of these errors is only around 5% for a portfolio which reflects the aggre-
gated sector distribution of the German banking system. In this way the infection
model outperforms the"Binomial Expansion Technique"for which the corresponding
median error is 34%.

1. Introduction
The purpose of this paper is to develop a robust "tool" that sufficiently approxi-
mates the value-at-risk of loan portfolios which are concentrated in certain sectors.
In a portfolio of credit­risky exposures, such as bank loans, sector concentration risk
arises if the portfolio is unbalanced in exposures to certain sectors, which entails de-
pendencies between default events. In the following the focus is on industry sectors,
however, sectors can also be defined geographically, in which case the methodology
still applies.
The importance of concentration risk in loan portfolios has become evident in past
banking failures. Banks specializing in loans to economically weak industry sectors
or less developed regions have sustained significant losses. A well­known example is
the failure of the German Schmidt Bank in 2001. This bank was heavily concentrated
in a less­developed region, which was close to the former East German border and
characterized by a fragile and concentrated industry structure. Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision (2004) lists examples from other countries which highlight the
importance of prudently managing concentration risk.
The relevance of sector concentration risk is also recognized by financial supervisors,
although existing supervisory rules usually only govern single-name concentration,
for example, large exposure rules.1 Supervisory concerns are revealed, for exam-
ple, by the statement of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision that "risk
concentrations are arguably the single most important cause of major problems in
banks." 2
In the following it is assumed that default dependencies are sufficiently well described
by (linear) default correlations. For a portfolio with given default probabilities and
a given exposure distribution across names, sector concentration can be defined as
an interim state between two extremes "perfect sector concentration" and "perfect
sector diversification". Perfect sector concentration would be the (undesirable) case
in which, ceteris paribus no change in the sector allocation of at least one exposure
would increase the value-at-risk (VaR) of this portfolio. Conversely, perfect sector
diversification would be achieved with a portfolio in which no change in the sector
allocation of an individual exposure would decrease the VaR.

Sector concentration needs to be distinguished from "single-name concentration" or
granularity which is caused by an unbalanced distribution across single borrowers.
Single-name concentration has been comprehensively discussed in the literature on
granularity adjustments in a single risk factor model, closely linked to the develop-
ment of the New Basel Accord.3 This paper focuses, however, solely on sector con-
centration. For this purpose I further differentiate between intra­sector correlation
and inter­sector correlation. Intuitively, intra­sector correlation should generally
be the higher of the two correlations if the definition of sectors is meaningful. De-
pending on the model, a distinction also needs to be made between asset correlation,
which is the correlation of the unobservable, normalized asset returns, and default
correlation, which refers to the correlation of the default events of two borrowers.
Depending on the model applied, both correlation definitions will be necessary.
A key motivation for analyzing a new approach is the recognition that the"binomial
expansion technique" (BET) developed by Moody's does not provide sufficiently ac-
curate estimates of the VaR. This is shown in Section 2 using numerical examples
of VaR calculations for realistic levels of default correlations. This paper explores
how the deficiencies of the BET approach can be remedied by extending the model
to incorporate infectious defaults as inspired by Davis und Lo (2001). This model
condenses loss dependencies, which are usually modelled by sector correlations, into
an infection probability. The new model imposes rather parsimonious data require-
ments, which are comparable to those for the BET model and considerably lower
than for a multi­factor model. Therefore, the new model is not only transparent
but also tractable, in terms of both the required computational effort and the data
requirements.
In spite of its relatively simple structure, the infection model presented in this paper
may provide a good VaR approximation since it is calibrated exactly to the tail
of the loss distribution in the multi­factor model. This approach is expected to
deliver better results than a moment­matching methodology, which is also used,
for example, in the BET model, and which can easily fail to capture the true tail
behavior.
To verify its accuracy, I compare the VaR in the new infection model to the VaR
3The Second Consultative Paper on Basel II, published in January 2001, contained a (later
abandoned) proposal for a "granularity adjustment" of the risk-weight functions of the internal
ratings based (IRB) approach. See Gordy (2004) for an overview of recent academic work on this
subject.

calculated in a multi­factor model setting, in which various sectors constitute the
systematic factors for a set of test portfolios. These test portfolios comprise expo-
sure distributions across sectors which reflect the aggregate sector distribution of
corporate lending in the German banking system as well as sector distributions of
existing banks with more concentrated portfolios. Furthermore, the portfolios differ
in terms of default probabilities and asset correlations. The purpose of comparing
these two models is to determine, how much accuracy is lost by applying the infec-
tion model and whether it still provides a reasonably accurate, but technically much
more easily computable, VaR.
The idea of calibrating a model with a simple structure and closed-form solution to
the VaR is also pursued in recent work by Cespedes et al. (2005). However, their
approach comprises a single­factor model with a scaling factor which is calibrated to
capture diversification across sectors. The scaling factor is defined as a function of a
Herfindahl­Hirschman index4, based on the economic capital required in each sector
by a single­factor model. It does not capture individual estimates of intra­sector
and inter­sector correlations which feed into the infection model. Furthermore, the
infection model differentiates between the contribution of the level of the probability
of default (PD) and the impact of the asset correlations on the VaR. The Pykhtin
(2004) approach retains the multi­factor model but provides a closed-form solution
for the VaR which is based on a methodology previously employed by Wilde (2001)
for a VaR adjustment which accounts for single-name concentration. Pykhtin's
closed-form solution, however, is more complex than the proposal in this paper
and does not reduce the data requirements compared with a multi­factor model.
Instead of reducing the complexity of a multi­factor model, Witt (2004) comes from
the opposite direction and extends Moody's BET model to form the "correlated
binomial approach". However, his proposal requires estimates of default correlations
as inputs which are difficult to obtain in the real world.
If the infection model presented in this paper proves to be sufficiently accurate, it
could be used as a fit­for­purpose tool for risk managers in banks or for banking
supervisors. Risk managers may also find it useful as a benchmark for the results of
more sophisticated internal models.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the concept of the BET model
and shows the limitations of its accuracy in calculating VaR if default events are

correlated. The infection model is introduced and calibrated in Section 3. The
key parameter in the calibration procedure is the degree of default infection, which
is determined by minimizing the squared error in the VaR calculation over a wide
range of realistic input parameter values.
In Section 4, the model performance is evaluated by applying the calibrated infec-
tion model to a range of test portfolios. The purpose of these tests is to verify if
the calibrated model provides a valid VaR approximation over the entire relevant
parameter space. Section 5 summarizes and concludes.
2. Binomial Expansion Methodology
2.1. Model Setup
An important area where default correlation needs to be measured is the assessment
of credit risk in securitization structures such as CDOs and CLOs. Therefore, it
is not surprising that external rating agencies were among the first to develop a
suitable methodology for that purpose. The BET model developed by Moody's was
one of the first approaches and emerged as a market standard, not least because its
underlying principles are very transparent.5
The key idea of the BET model is to map the real portfolio into a hypothetical
homogenous portfolio that consists of loans sharing the same probability of default
(PD) and the same exposure volume and in which default events of all exposures
are pairwise independent. The number of defaults in this hypothetical portfolio is
binomially distributed so that the VaR can easily be determined. The calculation
of the VaR requires only two input parameters: the PD and the modified diversity
score, which is defined as the number of exposures in the hypothetical portfolio. The
mapping between the two portfolios is defined by matching the first two moments
of the portfolio loss distribution.
Let Ai,k
denote exposure k in sector i of the real portfolio, m the number of sectors,
n(i) the number of exposures in sector i, and D the modified diversity score. For ease
of presentation it is assumed that every exposure belongs to a different borrower,
5See Cifuentes et al. (1996), Cifuentes und O`Connor (1996), and Cifuentes und Wilcox (1998).

eliminating the need to differentiate between exposures and borrowers. Let A refer
to the total exposure, which is the same for both portfolios:
A =
m
i=1
n(i)
j=1
Ai,j
. (1)
The uniform exposure size in the hypothetical portfolio is given by A/D. It is
assumed that exposures in the same sector share the same PD. The average PD of
the exposures in the hypothetical portfolio, ¯
p, is calculated by setting the mean loss
of the real portfolio equal to the mean loss of the hypothetical portfolio, where LGD
denotes the loss given default:
m
i=1
n(i)
j=1
pi
· Ai,j
· LGD = D · ¯
p ·
A
D
· LGD. (2)
From (2) it follows that ¯
p equals the weighted average PD of the real portfolio:
¯
p =
m

· n(i)
j=1

. (3)
Let Ui,j
denote the indicator function that signals a default of exposure j in sector
i in the original portfolio and Uk
a default of the k-th exposure in the hypothetical
portfolio. Matching the variances of losses in the real and the hypothetical portfolio
provides an explicit expression for the modified diversity score:

· LGD ·

. (4)
Note that the value of the LGD parameter does not affect the result of the moment
matching because this parameter cancels out in (4) and (2).
It is assumed that the pairwise default correlation i,k
j,l
of two exposures k and l in
sectors i and j is the same within each sector (intra
i
, intra
j
) and between any two
sectors (inter):
For i  {1, ..., m} : i,k
j,l
=





1 : i = j and k = l
intra
i
: i = j and k = l
inter : i = j.
(5)
Let pi
denote the default probability, which is the same for all borrowers in sector
i. Then, from (4) it follows for the modified diversity score D that

Since the number of defaults in the hypothetical portfolio is binomially distributed,
calculation of the VaR for a confidence level of 99.9% requires the 99.9% percentile
of the binomial distribution with parameters D and ¯
p. Then, the VaR is computed
by multiplying this percentile by the average exposure size, A/D, and the LGD.

2.2. Evaluation of VaR Estimates from the BET Model
In the following I evaluate the accuracy of the BET model for a VaR calculation.
The "real" portfolio that is used as the benchmark comprises 1,000 credit­risky
exposures. It is homogeneous in terms of the notional amount (one currency unit),
the default probability (2%) and the pairwise asset correlation (either 0.0, 0.1 or
0.2). The last property implies a single­sector model.
The well­known single risk factor model is used as a benchmark. Default is trig-
gered if the unobservable, normalized asset value Xk
of exposure k falls below an
exogenous default threshold, -1(¯
p), where (.)-1 denotes the inverse of the cumu-
lative standard normal distribution function. The loss distribution is obtained by
sampling the model equation
Xk
=

 Y + 1 -  k
, (8)
in which Y denotes the systematic factor and k
a disturbance term which are both
independent and standard­normally distributed.
Table 1 compares VaR estimates obtained from Monte Carlo simulation with the
corresponding VaR estimates, based on the BET model. The number of exposures
in the hypothetical portfolio is given by the diversity score and the exposure size by
the ratio of the total exposure of the real portfolio divided by the diversity score.
The VaR estimate in the BET model is obtained by invoking (7). For an asset
correlation of 0.1, for example, the VaR estimate is calculated as 6 · 1, 000/63 and
rounded up to 95. The increasing asset correlation, therefore, has two consequences
which affect the VaR estimate in opposite directions. It reduces the diversity score
in the denominator of (7) which c. p. increases the VaR estimate. Since the inferred
number of defaults in the hypothetical portfolio decreases with a lower number of

The following table compares VaR estimates from Monte Carlo simulation,
V aRMC, based on a single risk factor model with VaR estimates from applying
the BET model, V aRBET . The confidence level is 99.9%. The portfolio com-
prises 1,000 credit­risky exposures and is homogeneous in terms of the notional
amount (one currency unit), the default probability (2%) and the pairwise asset
correlation (either 0.0, 0.1 or 0.2).

exposures D, VaR also c. p. decreases. The net effect, however, is always an increase
in the VaR estimate.
In the special case of uncorrelated default events, the BET model provides the correct
VaR of 35, as expected. If the asset correlation is increased to 0.1 and afterwards
to 0.2, the VaR estimate obtained from the BET model also increases. However, it
substantially underestimates the true VaR in both cases. For an asset correlation of
0.1, the VaR estimate from the BET model is 27% below its true value, and for an
asset correlation of 0.1, the shortfall increases to 35%. These results suggest that
the BET model does not provide a sufficiently accurate estimate to recommend its
application as a measure for sector­concentration risk. However, they say nothing
about how well the BET model performs in capturing granularity in the VaR.
7
3. The Infection Model
3.1. Model Setup
The key idea of the new model is to extend the BET model by introducing a new
type of default dependency into the hypothetical portfolio. This initially appears
to be counter­intuitive because the hypothetical model was constructed precisely in
order to be tractable through the assumption that default events are independent.
However, instead of mapping the real portfolio into a portfolio with independent ex-
posures, it is mapped into a portfolio with default dependencies which are judiciously
constructed in order to obtain an easy-to-calculate solution for the VaR.
The number of exposures in the hypothetical portfolio is given by the diversity score
D, as in the BET model. Let Z1
, ..., ZD
denote indicator variables signaling that an
exposure in the hypothetical portfolio has defaulted.
Following the approach by Davis und Lo (2001), it is assumed that any asset in
the hypothetical portfolio can either "autonomously" default or default because
it is "infected" by the default of another asset. Let Uautonom
j
and Uinfected
j,k
de-
note indicator functions which equal 1 if an "autonomous" default of exposure j
occurs or if exposure j is "infected" by exposure k. Uautonom
j
and Uinfected
j,k
are
independent for j, k  {1, ..., D} and j = k. Let Zj
be the indicator function
that signals a default of exposure j, either because it has "autonomously" de-
faulted or because it has been infected by the default of another exposure. Let
pj
= P Uautonom
j
= 1 denote the autonomous default probability in the hypotheti-
cal portfolio and qj,k
= P Uinfected
j,k
= 1 the probability that an infection can take
place, in this case triggered by a default of exposure k. The default indicator Zj
is
defined as follows:
Zj
= Uautonom
j
+ (1 - Uautonom
j
) 1 -
k,k=j
1 - Uautonom
k
· Uinfected
j,k
. (9)
It is assumed that all exposures in the hypothetical portfolio share the same au-
tonomous default probability and the same infection probability. The autonomous
default probability is determined as the exposure­weighted average of the default
probabilities in the real portfolio. Therefore, pj
= ¯
p and qj
= q for j  {1, ..., D}.
8
The probability of  defaults in the hypothetical portfolio is then given by6

f(; D, ¯

depends on five parameters: the loss given default, LGD, the total exposure A, the
diversity score D, the "autonomous" default probability ¯
p, and the probability of
infection q. Since LGD enters the loss distribution as a linear factor in the same
way as it enters the VaR in the BET model (see (7)), its value does not change the
outcome of a comparison between the two models. Therefore, LGD is set equal to
100% in the following.
Davis und Lo (2001) regard the estimation of q as the "main outstanding problem".
I do not attempt to estimate this parameter but instead to "calibrate" it such that
it delivers roughly the same VaR as a multi­factor model.
Since EL is generally easier to measure than higher moments or extreme quantiles
of the loss distribution, it seems natural to calibrate EL in the infection model such
that it matches EL in the original portfolio. In the BET framework, the EL of the
hypothetical portfolio corresponds with the EL of the real portfolio.

In the infection model the EL is given by8
ELIM = LGD · A · 1 - (1 - ¯
p)(1 - ¯
p · q)D-1 . (12)
As long as the autonomous default probability in the infection model is defined
by the average default probability ¯
p in the real portfolio, the EL generally differs

between both portfolios. The EL coincides only in the special case in which q equals
zero. In this trivial case, the infection model collapses to the binomial model.
In order to match EL for the infection model for positive values of q, it would be
necessary to adjust ¯
p depending on the parameter q. However, in the calibration
methodology q is not known ex ante but is the parameter which is determined at
the very end in order to achieve a match in the VaR of the multi-factor model and
the infection model. In principle it is possible to determine q and ¯
p simultaneously
by requiring that the VaR and the EL both be matched. However, due to numerical
problems I did not pursue this approach further. Instead, I focus on matching only
the VaR and accept a discrepancy in the EL.
3.2. Calibration of the Infection Model
The analysis of the BET model is carried out in two steps. The first step comprises
a linear regression in order to calibrate the infection parameter q, based on fictive
exposure distributions across sectors. This step is described in the following section.
The second step, described in Section 4, comprises an evaluation of the accuracy of
the calibrated model for portfolios with empirically observed exposure distributions
across sectors.
For a given portfolio and a parameter set of PDs and asset correlations, an optimal
value q can, in principle, be obtained by equating the VaR in the multi­factor model
with the VaR in the infection model and solving numerically for q. The solution q,
thus obtained, achieves a match in the adverse 99.9% quantile of the loss distribution
of both models. Since q depends on the portfolio characteristics, particularly the
exposure distribution across sectors and asset correlations, it is not possible to find a
unique q for all portfolios. However, intuition suggests that q depends on a limited
number of factors which sufficiently capture portfolio characteristics, such as the
distribution of exposures across sectors, correlation of default events, and default
probabilities. Therefore, in the following I apply a linear model to determine a proxy
of q for every portfolio, dependent on three systematic factors. This regression
model is given by
ln(q) = 0
+ 1
ln(HHI) + 2
ln(¯
p) + 3
ln(¯
intra) + 4
ln(¯
inter) + . (13)

HHI denotes the Hirschman-Herfindahl index, calculated as the sum of squared
relative exposure shares of the sectors in the portfolio. ¯
intra is the weighted­
average intra­sector asset correlation of all exposures, weighted by the total exposure
amounts to the individual sectors, ¯
inter the average inter­sector asset correlation,
and the idiosyncratic disturbance term. Note that here I use asset correlations as
explanatory variables instead of default correlations, which are necessary to calcu-
late the diversity score. However, the asset correlation i,j
can be transformed into
the default correlation i,j
by invoking the ratio

where 2
(.) denotes the cumulative distribution function of the bivariate normal
distribution.
The regression coefficients 0
, ..., 4
in (13) are estimated by minimizing the squared
differences between VaR for portfolios with different sector concentrations and vari-
ous typical parameter sets of ¯
intra, ¯
inter and ¯
p. The optimization is carried out by
a linear regression based on (13), in which q is replaced by the "optimal" q which
equates the VaR in both models for the respective parameter set.
In the special case of zero inter­sector correlation, the regression function has a
jump discontinuity. Therefore, I estimate the model separately under the restriction
4

The benchmark or "true" model is a multi­factor model in which the factors are
defined by business sectors. The normalized one­period asset return of borrower k
in sector i is defined by a single­factor model
Xi,k

(15)
where i,k
denotes the idiosyncratic disturbance term. The parameter r2
i
describes
the correlation between a borrower's normalized, unobservable asset return process
and the systematic risk factor Yi
. The sector­dependent systematic factor Yi
can
be written as a linear combination of m orthogonal factors. Borrower k in sector
i defaults if his normalized asset value process Xi,k
crosses an exogenous default
barrier -1(pi,k
) where pi,k
denotes the unconditional default probability.
The value of ri
is given by r2

exploiting the assumption that the LGD equals 100%.
The portfolios used for calibration comprise 2000 exposures of one euro each. These
fine-grained portfolios ensure that the impact of sector concentration is not limited
by the granularity of the portfolios. In order to get meaningful results from the
calibration exercise, I focus on a subset of the parameter space which captures the
relevant range of typical values for HHI, ¯
intra, ¯
inter, and ¯
p.
In terms of sector concentration I explore four portfolios with sectors of different
sizes. I start with the relatively concentrated portfolio 1 that comprises only three
sectors which have a relative share of 50%, 30%, and 20% of the total exposure. I
proceed to portfolios 2, 3, and 4 using the following algorithm. The sector size in
every new portfolio is determined by splitting every sector share of the old portfolio
into two sectors which contain one-third and two-thirds respectively. The resulting
composition of the portfolios is presented in Table 8 in the Appendix. The maximum
of 24 sectors in portfolio 4 is inspired by the two­digit GICS classification scheme
of CreditMetrics which is based on 24 industry groups.
Other vendor models, such as Moody's KMV, employ an even greater number of
sectors. However, increasing the number of sectors by adjusting the sector defini-
tion without changing the portfolio will decrease concentration in individual sectors
and increase correlation across sectors. Broadly speaking sector concentration risk
would be transformed into overall correlation risk. Since the focus is here on sector
concentration risk, higher numbers of factors are not considered. Another motiva-
tion for not considering more factors is the fact that fit­for­purpose tools such as
the infection model could be most valuable for regionally focused and medium­size
banks because such tools impose relatively parsimonious data requirements with a
limited number of sectors.
For the calibration exercise, uniform intra­sector correlations ¯
intra for all sectors
and also uniform inter­sector correlations ¯
inter are assumed. This specification is
12
motivated by balancing parsimony and accuracy but also by a requirement of the
infection model which needs correlation values on a sector­by­sector basis for the
calculation of the diversity score. In cases where this information is not available
to banks, supervisors may consider providing a rough estimate of an average asset
correlation based on their own experience. This value could also be used for the
calculation of the diversity score, thereby further reducing data requirements.
Defining a realistic range of typical asset correlations for the calibration exercise
is not straightforward. The results of numerous empirical studies which have been
carried out in recent years are quite diverse.9 It seems fair to summarize that a
generally accepted industry consensus about the range of asset correlations has not
emerged so far. However, the relatively broad range (between 0.05 and 0.4) appears
to cover all relevant values. The 15 pairs of asset correlations ¯
intra and ¯
inter which
are used for the calibration are listed in Table 2.10

Realistic PD values were taken from historical default rates observed for common
rating categories, in particular 0.03%, 0.2%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 5%. As common
intuition tells us that corporate loans have, on average, lower PDs than retail ex-
posures and also that systematic risk decreases with the default probability, PDs of
up to 5% are considered to be most relevant for the analysis.

sector asset correlations, a total of 360 parameter sets are considered. For every
parameter set the VaR is determined in the multi­factor model by simulation. Af-
terwards the optimal q is computed which generates roughly the same VaR in the
infection model. The linear regressions are carried out using the q values as "ob-
servations" of the dependent variable. The estimates of the regression coefficients
0

in (13) are summarized in Table 3 for the two cases with and without
inter­sector correlation. The regression coefficients are highly significant with one

exception. Since the coefficient of the intercept is insignificant in the case of zero
inter­sector correlation, this regression model is also estimated without intercept
with only marginal changes in the other coefficient estimates. The signs of the esti-
mated coefficients are as expected in all cases. The infection probability increases, as
expected, with sector concentration, measured by HHI, with the default probability
¯
p, and also with the asset correlations ¯
intra and ¯
inter.
The adjusted R2 of the regression estimation is 96% without inter­sector correlation
and 95% with inter­sector correlation. These results indicate that the explanatory
power of the regression models is sufficient to keep the calibration error from unex-
plained noise in the residuals within reasonable bounds.

4. Evaluation of the Infection Model
When evaluating the model, the calibrated model is applied to various test portfolios
in order to measure the accuracy of the VaR. For the test portfolios in the analyses
the distribution of exposures across sectors was constructed from credit register data
on real bank portfolios. This test is extremely important because of three different
sources of error which can distort the results of the calibration when applied to real
portfolios.
The first error component derives from a discrete diversity score and does not de-
pend, therefore, directly on the calibration procedure. The diversity score has to be
an integer since the loss distribution, defined by (10), is a discrete distribution. This
error decreases as the number of exposures increases in the portfolio.
The second error component depends on the unexplained variation in the regression
model, defined by (13). In order to reduce this error, various specifications of (13)
were tried until an adjusted R2 of 96% seemed satisfactory.
The third, and arguably most important, error component derives from the difference
between the parameter set of the real portfolio and the parameter sets used for
calibration. A realistic range of parameters was used in order to reduce this effect,
yet this difference still constitutes a potential source of error, especially with respect
to the sector concentration, measured by HHI.
To evaluate the accuracy of the model calibration, three test portfolios were used
with realistic sector distributions. The first test portfolio represents the overall
business­sector concentration of the German banking system, including branches
of foreign banks, on German corporate, non­financial borrowers. I consider this
to be a reasonable approximation of a balanced portfolio. This view is guided by
the intuition that banks' portfolios, on average, cannot be more diversified than
the average relative sector distribution of the national banking system. However,
a VaR-minimizing portfolio could be better diversified and could yield a different
and possibly more uniform distribution of exposures across sectors. Portfolio 1
was constructed by aggregating large corporate exposures11 from the loan portfolios
of 2224 German banks at the end of September 2004. The data were extracted
from the German central credit register, which collects commercial, industrial, and
11See sections 13 and 14 of the German Banking Act ("Kreditwesengesetz").
15
consumer loans. Since the credit register reports only national industry codes which
are compatible with the NACE classification scheme, the sector exposures were
mapped to the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). For every sector
the total exposure, aggregated over all banks in the sample, was scaled so that the
sum of all sectors is consistent with the hypothetical total volume of EUR 6,000,000.
The calibration accuracy is subsequently measured for two more concentrated test
portfolios which were constructed to resemble real bank portfolios with respect to
the HHI. The sector distribution of all three portfolios is shown in Table 4. With
HHI ranging from 17.6% for the first portfolio to 61.7% for the last, the portfolios
cover a relatively broad range of exposure concentrations in sectors.

Sector decomposition of the test portfolios
The following table presents the sector decomposition of test portfolios 1­3
according to the GICS classification scheme, together with the Herfindahl-
Hirschman index (HHI), based on the aggregated sector exposures.

J: Utilities 6.7% 4.5% 1.7%
HHI 17.6% 24.0% 61.7%
Little computational work is required to apply the calibrated infection model. The
VaR is determined as the 99.9% adverse percentile of the loss distribution defined by
(10). This calculation requires the parameter q which is determined from (13) with
estimates of the regression coefficients 0
, ..., 4
given in Table 3 and the portfolio­
dependent parameter values HHI, ¯
intra, ¯
inter, and ¯
p.
16
When analyzing each test portfolio, the parameter HHI is kept constant because
it is defined by the exposure distribution across sectors which is also constant for
each test portfolio. In order to increase the representativeness of the results ¯
p, ¯
intra,
and ¯
inter are varied in each test portfolio in the same range as for the calibration.
For 3 test portfolios, 6 PDs and 15 pairs of ¯
intra and ¯
inter, this produces 270 VaR
estimates for the multi­factor model, for the BET model, and for the infection model
respectively.
Table 5 shows descriptive statistics of the VaR for portfolios 1, 2, and 3. The
relatively strong increase in the HHI for portfolio 3 compared with portfolios 1 and
2 is mirrored by a strong increase of 66% and 48% in the VaR.

Table 6 shows descriptive statistics of the infection probabilities for the three test
portfolios. For each portfolio the median, standard deviation, and the 75% quantile
are reported for 90 tuples of default probabilities and intra­sector and inter­sector

more concentrated portfolio 3 the level and the dispersion of the infection probabil-
ities roughly double.

selected combinations of ¯
intra, ¯
inter, and ¯
p for portfolio 1. Column 4 of the table
contains the VaR (in percent), obtained from MC simulations, and the percentage
errors of the BET model and the infection model relative to the simulation-based

According to Table 9, the relative error in the VaR estimate is substantially lower
for the infection model than for the BET model. With few exceptions, it is below
10% and may be regarded as sufficiently small for practical purposes to measure
the impact of sector concentration on the VaR with the infection model. The re-
gions in which the infection model produces the highest relative errors in VaR are
characterized by low PDs in combination with relatively high asset correlations.
Figure 1 visualizes the percentage error in the VaR for two selected values of ¯
p,
namely 20bp and 2%. The inter­sector correlation is set to zero. Figure 1 shows
that in the infection model the relative errors increase with ¯
intra only for the lower
PD of 20 bp. For ¯
intra > 0.15 and ¯
pi
= 0.2% the approximation error exceeds the
10% boundary; however, this occurs relatively rarely in the 270 considered cases.
For the BET model the relative errors are considerably higher and increase with the
asset correlations, as expected.
Figure 2 differs from Figure 1 in that the inter­sector correlation is set to 5% instead
of zero. The results are qualitatively very similar to the case of zero inter­sector
correlation. Again, there is no monotonic relation between the intra­sector corre-
lation and the accuracy of the infection model. This suggests that the calibration
of the infection model achieves its purpose of accounting for changes in the asset
correlation. Only for relatively extreme combinations of low PDs and high asset
correlations, not shown in Figure 2, are peaks in the relative VaR errors observed.
This is different from the BET model, for which a positive relationship can overall
be observed between the asset correlation and the VaR error can be observed.

Figure 3 shows the approximation error in a heavily concentrated single­sector port-
folio. Again, the relative errors of the infection model appear to be relatively robust
against changes in the asset correlation.
Table 7 summarizes descriptive statistics of the absolute values of the relative VaR
errors. Results are presented for both models and for all three test portfolios, calcu-
lated from 90 tuples of ¯
intra, ¯
intra, and ¯
p for each portfolio. The gain in accuracy
by using the infection model instead of the BET model is considerable and amounts
to 28.8­31.8 percentage points for the median errors. For the infection model the
median error and also the other two statistics are considerably higher for portfolio 3
(which has the highest concentration) than for the other two portfolios. This may
at least partly be explained by the fact that the most concentrated portfolio is out­
of­sample in the sense that the highest HHI for the calibration was 38% compared
with a considerably higher value of 61.7% in portfolio 3. If portfolios with such a
concentrated sector distribution are relevant for practical purposes, a re­calibration
can be carried out based on more concentrated portfolios. With one exception,12,
12For the smallest parameter values, which means for ¯
intra = 0.05, ¯
inter = 0 and ¯
p = 0.03%,
both models achieve roughly the same accuracy.

replacing the BET model by the infection model substantially reduces the error in
the VaR. It is up to the practitioner to decide whether the results are sufficiently
accurate for his purposes given the "fit­for­purpose" character of the approach.
5. Summary and Conclusions
Results from portfolio models for credit risk tell us that exposure concentrations
in certain industry sectors can substantially increase the VaR. The purpose of this
paper is to analyze a tractable "infection model" that permits a meaningful estimate
of the impact of concentration risk on the VaR. The required input parameters ­
the sector­based Herfindahl­Hirschman index, the average (intra­sector and inter­
sector) asset correlations, weighted by total sector exposures, and the average default
probability in each sector ­ can be calculated from the data which are already
required to calculate a diversity score for the BET model. Therefore, the new
model imposes no additional data requirements compared with the BET model and
considerably fewer than a multi­factor model.
The infection model extends the Binomial Expansion Technique (BET) developed by
21
Moody's for the valuation of CDOs. The key idea is to introduce default infection for
the hypothetical portfolio on which the real portfolio is mapped in order to obtain
a simple solution for the VaR. The infection probability is calibrated for a range
of typical values of the input parameters to the VaR obtained from a multi­factor
model.
The accuracy of the new model and its calibration are measured for three test port-
folios. The exposure distributions across sectors of these portfolios are defined based
on information from the German public credit register. The first portfolio reflects the
average sector distribution of the German banking system whereas the second and
third portfolios are more concentrated and resemble those of real banks. The tests
also consider a broad range of realistic values of default probabilities and intra­sector
as well as inter­sector asset correlations. I find that a carefully calibrated model ap-
proximates the VaR obtained from a multi­factor model reasonably closely. The
highest errors are observed for combinations of very low default probabilities and
high asset correlations. With a reduction of roughly 30 percentage points in the
median of the relative VaR approximation errors, the infection model out­performs
by far the BET approach, which is dismissed for its lack of accuracy.
Future work will comprise further robustness checks, with attention given to the
heterogeneity of intra­sector correlations and PDs. A comparison of the specific
shape of the loss distribution implied by the infection model with alternatives is also
warranted. The loss distribution can be replaced by another distribution, for ex-
ample a beta­binomial distribution, and the additional parameter can be calibrated
similarly to q in the infection model.
Parsimonious data requirements constitute an important, practical advantage of the
infection model. Instead of a fully specified correlation matrix, it is sufficient to
provide an average intra­sector and an average inter­sector correlation as inputs.
From the evaluation of the calibrated infection model, it can be concluded that the
model offers a fit­for­purpose tool to measure concentration risk in business sectors.
It could be useful for risk managers in banks as well as banking supervisors, and may
be especially suited for application in regionally focused and medium­sized banks
because of its relatively sparse data requirements.
