ACUTE INTOXICATION FROM
carbon monoxide (CO) has
been reported to contribute to
more than 2000 poisoning
deaths annually in the United States.1-4
Common sources of CO poisoning in-
clude the operation of motor vehicles in
enclosed or semi-enclosed areas, mal-
functioning home heating systems, and
improperly vented combustion appli-
ances.2,5 Even in outdoor environ-
ments, combustion engine exhaust can
produce localized concentrations of CO
that are capable of producing uncon-
sciousness and death in minutes.6,7
National surveillance for CO-related
mortality was last updated over a de-
cade ago, when it was reported that the
annual rate of unintentional CO-
related deaths decreased in the United
States during 1979 through 1988.1 One

Context Carbon monoxide (CO) has been reported to contribute to more than 2000
poisoning deaths per year in the United States.
Objectives To evaluate the influence of national vehicle emissions policies and prac-
tices on CO-related mortality and to describe 31 years (1968-1998) of CO-related
deaths in the United States.
Design and Setting Longitudinal trend analysis using computerized death data from
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau population data,
and annual CO emissions estimates for light-duty vehicles provided by the US Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency.
Main Outcome Measure All deaths in the US for which non­fire-related CO poi-
soning was an underlying or contributing condition, classified by intent and mecha-
nism of death. Negative binomial regression was used to incorporate every year of
data into estimated percentage changes in CO emissions and mortality rates over time.
Results During 1968-1998, CO-related mortality rates in the United States declined
from 20.2 deaths to 8.8 deaths per 1 million person-years (an estimated decline of
57.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -62.4% to -52.6%). Following the introduction
of the catalytic converter to automobiles in 1975, CO emissions from automobiles
decreased by an estimated 76.3% of 1975 levels (95% CI, -82.0% to -70.4%) and
unintentional motor vehicle­related CO death rates declined from 4.0 to 0.9 deaths
per 1 million person-years (an estimated decline of 81.3%; 95% CI, -84.8% to
-77.0%). Rates of motor vehicle­related CO suicides declined from 10.0 to 4.9 deaths
per 1 million person-years (an estimated decline of 43.3%; 95% CI, -57.5% to
-24.3%). During 1975-1996, an annual decrease of 10 g/mile of estimated CO emis-
sions from automobiles was associated with a 21.3% decrease (95% CI, -24.2% to
-18.4%) in the annual unintentional motor vehicle­related CO death rate and a 5.9%
decrease (95%CI, -10.0% to -1.8%) in the annual rate of motor vehicle­related CO
suicides.
Conclusions If rates of unintentional CO-related deaths had remained at pre-1975
levels, an estimated additional 11700 motor vehicle­related CO poisoning deaths might
have occurred by 1998. This decline in death rates appears to be a public health ben-
efit associated with the enforcement of standards set by the 1970 Clean Air Act.

of automobile emissions standards set
by the 1970 Clean Air Act. To comply
with these standards, the first catalytic
converters were introduced for automo-
bileuseintheUnitedStatesin1975.This
improved the completeness of engine
combustion and reduced CO emis-
sions from passenger vehicles.8-11 How-
ever, an evaluation of the influence of
national vehicle emissions policies and
practices on trends in CO-related mor-
tality has not been undertaken. Exist-
ing surveillance reports have presented
mortality data only for periods follow-
ing the introduction of the catalytic con-
verter in 1975, leaving preregulatory
baseline rates of CO-related deaths
unestablished. In addition, multivari-
ate analyses have not been used to re-
late changes in national rates of CO-
relateddeathstoannualindicatorsofCO
emissions from automobiles. To ad-
dress these issues, we examine 31 years
(1968-1998) of national mortality and
motor vehicle emissions data and also
provide updated surveillance for CO-
related deaths in the United States.
METHODS
Data Source
Death certificates contain demo-
graphic and geographic information of
the decedent, as well as International
Classification of Diseases (ICD)12,13 codes
for up to 20 conditions that contrib-
uted to the death. All US death certifi-
cate information is compiled by the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics,
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
ventionintotheMultipleCauseofDeath
Mortality Data Tapes. These cause of
death codes are compiled in 2 forms: the
entity axis, which contains conditions
as stated on the death certificate; and the
record axis, which is edited by a com-
puter algorithm to revise some ICD
codes to best describe the overall medi-
cal certification portion of the death cer-
tificate.14 We identified 31 years (1968-
1998)ofCO-relateddeathsintherecord
axis portion of these data. The ICD,
Eighth Revision (ICD-8) was in effect for
the years 1968-1978, and the ICD, Ninth
Revision (ICD-9) was in effect for the
years 1979-1998.
Case Definition
We searched the data tapes for records
of all deaths during 1968 through 1998
containing the ICD 3-digit code N986
(toxic effect of CO) as a contributing
cause of death and identified 115987
deaths. A previous national surveil-
lance report used this case definition for
case ascertainment.1 In a slight depar-
ture from the previous report, we also
searched the data tapes for deaths where
N986 was not listed on the death cer-
tificate, but where ICD external cause of
injury codes (E-codes) exclusive to CO
poisoning (ICD-8=E874, E875, and
E952.1; or ICD-9=E868.3, E868.8,
E868.9, E952.1, and E982.1), or poi-
soning from motor vehicle exhaust
(ICD-8 = E873 or E952.0; or ICD-
9=E868.2, E952.0, and E982.0) were
listed on the death certificate. Since CO
is the only acutely poisonous gas in mo-
tor vehicle exhaust,8 we also consid-
ered these codes to indicate CO poison-
ing. This change in case definition led
to the inclusion of 716 additional deaths
duringthe31-yearperiodthatwouldnot
have otherwise been captured (716/
116703 or 0.6% of all CO-related
deaths).Asdatawereonlyavailablefrom
a 50% sample of death certificates for
1972, numbers of deaths for this year
were weighted by a factor of 2.15
Classification of Intent
and Mechanism of Death
We classified each CO-related death by
intent (unintentional, suicide, homi-
cide, intent undetermined, and other)
and mechanism (motor vehicle­
related,non­motorvehicle­related,and
mechanism undetermined), as defined
by the E-codes listed on the death rec-
ord(BOX 1).RecordscontainingE-codes

soning per se.1
Calculation of Death Rates
and Trend Analyses
We used US Census Bureau national
resident midpoint population esti-
mates for each year during 1968
through 1998 as denominators to cal-
culate all national rates and trend lines.
Log-linear negative binomial and Pois-
son regression analyses were used to es-
timate change, and 95% confidence in-
tervals (CIs) for change in rates during
the study period.16 Estimates of change
in mortality rates by intent and mecha-
nism of death were calculated for 1968-
1998, and for the 3 study periods of
1968-1978 (11 years), 1979-1988, and
1989-1998. As the year 1978 was the
final year of implementation of the
ICD-8 coding scheme, there was no
change in ICD coding within each of
these 3 study periods.
Examining the Influence
of National Vehicle Emissions
Policies and Practices
We calculated trends in annual esti-
mated CO emissions from automobiles
using data provided by the US Environ-
mentalProtectionAgency.During1968-
1996, the US Environmental Protec-
tion Agency collected vehicle model and
vehicle age­specific CO emission rate
measurementsfrom20000light-dutyve-
hiclesintheUnitedStates.Themeasure-
ment of CO emissions was undertaken
in a controlled setting during the cold
start of the motor vehicle and also dur-
ing 23 minutes of continuous station-
ary vehicle operation.17 This testing pro-
cedure resulted in estimates of total
vehicle emissions (specified as grams/
mile of CO per test mile) that are di-
rectly comparable across vehicles of dif-
ferentmakeandmodelyears.Weapplied
these emission rates (specific to vehicle
age and model-year, within calendar
year) to annual data on the composi-
tionoftheUSautomobilefleet18,19 topro-
duce annual estimates of CO emissions
per motor vehicle in the United States.
Trend lines of these emissions data
were calculated using a normally dis-
tributed linear regression model for the
periods 1968-1974 and 1975-1996.
Negativebinomialregressionmodelsad-
justing for the age, sex, and race of the
decedent were used to calculate corre-
sponding trends in rates of motor vehi-
cle­related CO deaths. The cutoff of
1975wasusedtoexamineanyeffectthat
theintroductionyearofthecatalyticcon-
verter may have had on these trends.
We also used negative binomial re-
gression models to directly examine as-
sociations between the annual auto-
mobile emissions estimates and annual
rates of motor vehicle­related CO poi-
soning deaths. To estimate the num-
ber of unintentional poisoning deaths
that would have occurred during 1975
to 1998 if unintentional CO-related
death rates remained at pre-1975 lev-
els, we calculated the average annual
rate of unintentional CO-related deaths
during 1968-1974, and then applied
this rate to US population estimates dur-
ing 1975-1998. SAS version 8 (SAS In-
stitute, Inc, Cary, NC) was used and the
a priori significance level for all statis-
tical tests was set at P.05.
Examining the Influence
of Hospital-Based Treatment
To determine whether better medical
treatment may have reduced mortality
from CO poisoning, we classified deaths
into 2 categories. First, deaths in home
or nonclinical settings were classified as
deaths without treatment. As these
deaths likely involved no medical care,
they could not have been prevented by
improvedhospital-basedtreatment.Sec-
ond, persons who died during hospital-
ization, who died during an outpatient
visit to an emergency department, or
who were dead on arrival at a hospital,
clinic, or medical center were classified
as deaths possibly following treatment.
We compared changes in the rate of
deaths without treatment and deaths
possiblyfollowingtreatment.Thisanaly-
sis was undertaken only for 1979 to
1998, the years when location-of-
death data were available on the death
certificates.
RESULTS
During 1968 through 1998, non­fire-
related CO poisoning was listed as a
contributing cause for 116703 deaths
(TABLE 1). Motor vehicles were men-
tioned as the mechanism in 70.6% of
these deaths. For every unintentional
CO-related death that occurred (33836
deaths), there were 2.2 CO-related sui-
cides (73940 deaths).
Trends by Mechanism
and Intent of Death
During 1968-1998, CO-related mortal-
ity rates in the United States declined by
57.8%. Declining trends in death rates
were observed across selected catego-
ries of intent and mechanism of death
(TABLE 2). However, greater declines
were observed in CO-related uninten-
tional death rates than suicide rates.
(Table 2 and FIGURE 1). The annual rate
of unintentional motor vehicle­related
deaths did not change during 1968-
1978,butthisratedeclinedduring1979-
1998. In comparison, unintentional
non­motor vehicle­related deaths de-
clined during each of the 3 study de-
cades. Trends in unintentional deaths of
undetermined mechanism more closely
resembled motor vehicle than non­
motor vehicle­related patterns of de-
cline. Annual rates of CO-related sui-
cides remained unchanged during the
1968-1978 period and increased dur-
ing 1979-1988. As a result, the major-
ity of the decline in CO-related sui-
cides that occurred during 1968-1998
is attributable to declines that occurred
during 1989-1998 (Table 2).

Trends by Age, Sex, and Race
Declining trends in CO-related uninten-
tional death rates were observed across
age, sex, and race categories and were
most pronounced in the 15- to 34-year-
old group (TABLE 3). This was the case
for both motor vehicle and non­motor
vehicle­related mechanisms of death.
Rates of unintentional deaths involving
motor vehicles declined least sharply
among persons aged 65 years and older.
Annual rates of CO-related suicides de-
creased across age and sex categories.
These declines were also greater among
women, who had lower baseline rates
than men. As with unintentional deaths,
decreasesinsuicidesinvolvingmotorve-
hicles were less pronounced among per-
sons aged 65 years and older.
Estimating the Influence
of Hospital-Based Treatment
During 1979 to 1998, CO-related mor-
tality rates declined by 66.7% (95% CI,
­64.7% to ­68.3%) in persons classi-
fiedashavingbeenpossiblytreatedprior
to death and by 47.3% (95% CI, -45.9%
to -48.8%) in persons classified as not
treated prior to death. As a result, the
proportion of all CO-related deaths that
occurred to persons who died possibly
following treatment decreased from
23.9% to 16.2% during this period. Per-
sons classified as possibly treated prior
to death composed 20.9% of all dece-
dents during 1979-1998, and declining
deathsinthisgroupaccountedfor30.7%
of the overall reduction in CO-related
deaths rates that occurred since 1979.
Estimating the Influence of Vehicle
Emissions Policies and Practices
Trends in unintentional motor vehicle­
related CO death rates, and CO emis-
sions from automobiles, follow nearly
parallel trajectories (FIGURE 2 and BOX
2).18-20 Declines in each of these trends
began in 1978, when 1975 and newer
model-year cars made up 34% of the US
passenger vehicle fleet.18 Annual rates
of CO-related suicides involving mo-
tor vehicles began to decline in 1988,
10 years following initial declines in CO
emissions estimates (Figure 2 inset).
During 1968-1974, CO emissions in-
creased by an estimated 2.0 g/mile (95%
CI,1.3-2.8)oranestimated2.2%of1968
levels(95%CI,1.4%-3.1%).Annualrates
of motor vehicle­related CO suicides
(14.6%; 95% CI, -33.3% to 96.8%) and
unintentional deaths (-1.2%; 95% CI,
-33.2% to 46.3%) did not change dur-
ing 1968-1974. However, during 1975-
1996, CO emissions decreased by an es-
timated 72.8 g/mile (95% CI, -78.2 to
-67.2)oranestimated76.3%of1975lev-
els (95% CI, -82.0% to -70.4%). Corre-
sponding rates of motor vehicle­
related CO suicides (the annual death
rate declined from 10.0 to 4.9, or by an
estimated 43.3%; 95% CI, -57.5% to
-24.3%) and unintentional deaths (the
annual death rate declined from 4.0 to
0.9, or by an estimated 81.3%; 95% CI,
-84.8% to -77.0%) also declined dur-
ing the post-1975 period. Annual rates
ofnon­motorvehicle­relatedCOdeaths
declined during both the 1968-1974
(-37.5%; 95% CI, -49.0% to -23.4%)
and1975-1998(­75.5%;95%CI,­78.5%
to -71.9%) periods.
During 1975-1996, an annual de-
crease of 10 g/mile of estimated CO
emissions from automobiles was asso-
ciated with a 21.3% decrease (95% CI,
­24.2% to ­18.4%) in the annual un-
intentional motor vehicle­related CO
death rate and a 5.9% decrease (95% CI,
­10.0% to ­1.8%) in the annual rate of
motor vehicle­related CO suicides.
We estimated that an additional
19008 unintentional deaths might have
occurred from 1975-1998 had annual
rates of CO-related deaths remained at
pre-1975 levels. Of these deaths, as es-
timated 11667 (61%) would have been
motor vehicle­related, 4551 (24%)
would have been non­motor vehicle­
related, and 2790 (15%) would have
been from an undetermined mecha-
nism of exposure.
COMMENT
During 1968-1998, the US annual rate
of non­fire-related CO poisoning deaths
declined by almost 60%. Unintentional
CO-related death rates remained un-
changed during 1968 to 1978 but then
declined by nearly 80% during the fol-
lowing 2 decades. Carbon monoxide­
related suicides decreased by 40%, with
nearly the entire decline occurring dur-
ing 1988 to 1998. Although more than
two thirds of the CO-related poisoning
deaths involved motor vehicles, signifi-
cant declines in both motor vehicle and
non­motor vehicle­related mortality
suggestthatseveralfactorsmayhavecon-

A lack of specificity in International Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision (ICD-8) and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) coding did not allow a
distinction of assault by poisoning using motor vehicle exhaust (homicides) from all homicides using gases and vapors; therefore, no homicides are classified as motor vehicle-related.
A lack of specificity in the ICD-8 intent undetermined category did not allow a distinction of poisoning from carbon monoxide from poisoning due to other gases and vapors. As a
result, in cases where N986 (toxic effect of carbon monoxide) was not listed on the death record as a contributing cause of death from 1968-1978 (237/45 481 or 0.5% of all
cases), carbon monoxide poisonings due to undetermined intent could not be identified.

tributed to the prevention of CO-
related deaths. Possible explanations in-
clude the increasing use of CO alarms in
homes, the increased safety of home ap-
pliances and consumer products, re-
duced CO emissions from automo-
biles,andareductionincase-fatalityrates
associated with improved medical treat-
ment of CO-exposed patients.
Interventions to Reduce
Exposure to CO
Of the CO-related poisoning deaths as-
sociatedwithconsumerproductsthatoc-
curredduring1993through1997,anav-
erage of 76% involved indoor heating
systems or heaters.5 Other consumer
products involved in CO-related deaths
includedcharcoalgrillsandburnedchar-
coal(10%),gaswaterheaters(4%),camp
stovesorlanterns(4%),gasrangesorov-
ens (4%), or other fuel-burning prod-
ucts (2%). Battery-operated residential
CO alarms did not become widely avail-
able in the United States until 1992,21
whenunintentionalnon­motorvehicle­
related deaths had already stabilized at
anannualrateofaround1deathpermil-
lion persons. As a result, increased use
of CO alarms cannot explain the ob-
served decline in non­motor vehicle­
relatedmortality,whichbeganmorethan
20 years earlier. However, the US Con-
sumer Product Safety Commission has
issued at least 8 hazard warnings re-
lated to CO leakage in home and mo-
bile home furnaces, resulting in subsi-
dized inspection and maintenance for
more than 500000 faulty home fur-
naces.22-30 Unvented gas space heaters
manufactured after 1982 were also
equipped with oxygen sensors that shut
off the system if the surrounding envi-
ronmentbecameoxygendepleted.31,32 In
addition, a voluntary standard for home
furnaces was introduced by the Ameri-
canNationalStandardsInstitutein1987,
requiring a blocked vent detection and
safety shutoff mechanism on the draft
hood of natural draft furnaces.33
Although these and other consumer
product­related interventions are note-
worthy, more than 70% of CO-related
deaths that occurred during the study
were motor vehicle­related. In 1970,
Congress established the Environmen-
tal Protection Agency and enacted the
Clean Air Act, setting strict automo-
tive emissions standards beginning with
the 1975 model year.9 To help achieve
these standards, the first catalytic con-
verters appeared for use in vehicles in
the United States in 1975, reducing CO
emissions by removing products of in-
complete combustion.8-10 The further
introduction of 3-way catalysts, on-
board computers, and oxygen sensors
in new vehicles occurred in 1981, when
new cars manufactured in the United
States were required to meet a CO emis-
sions standard that was 90% lower than
the 1970 standard. Thus, the newest
motor vehicles produce less than 5% of

comparison, statistically significant de-
clinesinnon­motorvehicle­relatedpoi-
soning deaths were evident during both
pre-1975 and post-1975 periods. Dur-
ing 1968 to 1996, an annual decrease of
10 g/mile of estimated CO emissions
from automobiles was associated with a
21.3%decreaseintheaverageannualun-
intentional motor vehicle­related CO
death rate, independent of the age, sex,
and race of the decedents.
Higher rates of CO poisoning deaths
may occur in countries where emis-
sion standards for motor vehicles have
not been implemented. In Great Brit-
ain, no decline in motor vehicle­
related CO deaths was evident until
1993, when catalytic converters first
were required.34,35 However, as of 1997,
suicide rates from motor vehicle ex-
haust gas in Australia continued to rise,
despitetheintroductionofcatalyticcon-
verterstotheAustralianautomobilefleet
in 1986.36 The United States set envi-
ronmental limits on CO emissions from
automobiles at 15.0 g/mile in 1975 and
reduced this standard to 3.4 g/mile for
automobiles manufactured in 1981 or
later.Standardsequivalentto15.0g/mile
and 3.4 g/mile were not established in
Australia until 1986 and 1997, respec-
tively, and may help explain the de-
cline in CO-related suicide rates ob-
served only in the United States.36
Improving Treatment
of CO-Exposed Patients
Improvements in hospital-based medi-
cal care for CO-poisoned patients may
also have influenced the decline in CO-
related death rates, as the proportion of
all CO-related deaths that occurred to
personsclassifiedaspossiblytreatedprior
to death decreased during the study.
However,onlyasmallproportionofCO-
related deaths occur at medical facili-
ties.37 Inthiscase,weestimatedthat21%
of all of the CO-related deaths that oc-
curred during 1979-1998 were possi-
bly treated prior to death. If all of the
deaths that were recorded as having oc-
curred in a hospital or clinical care set-
tingin1979hadbeenpreventedthrough
improved treatment, the CO-related
death rate that year would have de-
creasedby24%.Whileconsiderable,this
is smaller than the more than 50% de-
crease in the annual rate of CO-related
deaths that was observed since 1979.
Limitations
Due to the ecologic nature of this study,
we are limited in our ability to draw
causal inferences about the association
between individual exposures and CO-
related deaths. However, the concur-
rent decline in motor vehicle­related
emissionsandpoisoningdeathsthatonly
occurred following the first national in-
tervention to reduce CO in automobile
exhaust appears unlikely to be coinci-

CO indicates carbon monoxide. Due to the sparse data, the trend line for non­motor vehicle­related suicides
is not presented. Because linear regression models used every year of data to estimate the change in automo-
bile emissions over time, estimated changes in emissions for 1975-1996 may not exactly match calculations
based on only 1975 and 1996 data.
Box 2. Carbon Monoxide (CO) Emissions Control Timeline*
1970: Congress enacts Clean Air Act. CO emissions standard at 34.0 g/mile.
1975: Catalytic converter introduced on new passenger cars to meet new CO
emissions standard of 15 g/mile.
1978: The 1975 and newer model-year cars make up 34% of the US passenger
vehicle fleet.
1980: New passenger cars required to meet new CO emissions standard of 7.0 g/mile.
The 1975 and newer model-year cars make up 50% of US passenger vehicle fleet.
1981: New cars required to meet new CO emissions standard of 3.4 g/mile.
1990: The 1975 and newer model-year cars make up 91% of the US passenger
vehicle fleet.
1992: Standards setting emission limits for CO at temperatures less than ­7 °C are
established. Oxygenated gasoline is introduced in cities with high CO levels.

strate that alternative explanations did
not fit the data as well, individual-level
measures of exposure would be needed
to confirm these suggested etiologic
relationships. Other limitations associ-
ated with CO data from death certifi-
cates include the absence of circumstan-
tial detail, such as drug and alcohol use,
the inconsistent assignment of mecha-
nism, intent, and place of death, and the
inconsistent application of ICD codes by
nosologists.1 However, as national
awareness of CO as a source of fatal poi-
soningsincreasedduringthestudy,itap-
pearsunlikelythatatendencyawayfrom
coding CO as a contributing cause of
death could explain the observed de-
crease in CO-related death rates.
Conclusion
The federal regulation of motor vehicle
emissions was associated with the de-
cline in motor vehicle­related CO death
rates that occurred in the United States
after 1975. Similar to the rapid decline
in population blood lead levels that fol-
lowed the removal of lead from gaso-
line,38 an estimated 11700 uninten-
tional motor vehicle­related poisoning
deaths may have been averted since the
year of introduction of the catalytic con-
verter, reflecting what appears to be a
public health benefit associated with the
enforcement of the 1970 Clean Air Act.
However, exposure to CO remains a
leading cause of poisoning death, result-
ing in more than 1700 suicides and 500
unintentional deaths annually. Carbon

cur with newer vehicle models36 as the

creases over its useful life,39,40 in oxygen-
depleted environments,8 and during the

vention efforts, continued enforcement
of emissions standards, and the identi-
fication and prevention of ongoing
mechanisms of exposure remain impor-
tant to continued public health success.
