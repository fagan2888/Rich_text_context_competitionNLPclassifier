Rationale
International study has a long and robust history since the
first exchange took place between Holland and Oxford
University in England in 1190; however, it has only been in
the last 40 years that international study has increased sig-
nificantly from 800,000 to more than 4.5 million interna-
tional students worldwide (Hoffa, 2007; Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD], 2014).
Asian students from China, India, and Korea make up 53%
of all international students (OECD, 2014). Within this
group, China sends more students than any other country to
study in English-speaking countries including the United
States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada
(Choudaha, Chang, & Kono, 2013), with about 87% of
Chinese international students in the United States coming
from Mainland China and 13% from Taiwan (Institute of
International Education [IIE], 2014). In addition, because
students from Mainland China and Taiwan share many cul-
tural similarities, including values and language, they are
often grouped together for research purposes (Lin & Betz,
2009; K. T. Wang et al., 2012; C. Wang & Mallinckrodt,
2006; Wei, Liao, Heppner, Chao, & Ku, 2012).
Academically, there are more Chinese student-scholars,
including those from Mainland China and Taiwan, than any
other group of international students studying in the United
States (IIE, 2014). However, despite large and growing num-
bers of Chinese students studying in the United States, there
are relatively few studies that have focused on their specific
educational needs and required career support services. The
purpose of this study was to begin an exploration of the rela-
tionship between career goals and emotional adjustment in
Chinese international students.
Review of Literature
Acculturation and Other Challenges
There have been a number of studies examining the emo-
tional and psychological experiences of Chinese interna-
tional students. Many of these have focused on the idea of
acculturation and surrounding mental health issues.
Acculturation refers to the process of adopting the values and
behaviors of a new culture, often resulting in an internal bat-
tle between the heritage of their country of origin and the pull
to fit in with dominant American culture (Berry, 1980, 1997).

Career Aspirations and Emotional
Adjustment of Chinese International
Graduate Students
Deanna L. Cozart1 and Jay W. Rojewski1
Abstract
There are more Chinese student-scholars than any other group of international students studying in the United States. Despite
this, there are relatively few studies that have focused on specific educational needs and required career support services
for Chinese international students. This exploratory study was conducted to determine the relationship between career
aspirations and emotional adjustment of Chinese international students. Results from Chinese students were compared with
those of students from the United States. Relationships between the career aspirations and emotional adjustment of Chinese
and U.S. students did not reveal statistically significant differences. However, regression analysis indicated that social stress
was a statistically significant predictor of career aspirations for U.S. students. Chinese and U.S. students were more alike than
different on career aspirations and emotional adjustment, and observed educational similarities appeared to outweigh any
cultural differences that existed when determining these outcomes.

Each person must decide whether to accept or reject the host
community's cultural values and practices, while making
those same decisions about their home country's cultural val-
ues and practices (Yakushko, Backhaus, Watson, Ngaruiya,
& Gonzalez, 2008).
Berry (1980, 1997) developed one of the most commonly
used models that highlights possible acculturation outcomes.
The model lists four possible outcomes: integration, assimi-
lation, separation/segregation, and marginalization based on
how a person responds to two questions: "Is it considered to
be of value to maintain one's identity and characteristics?"
and "Is it considered to be of value to maintain relationship
with larger society?" Separation/segregation refers to an
individual decision to withdraw from norms of larger soci-
ety; a cultural identity from the home country is retained, but
within terms of a less value given to maintaining a relation-
ship to dominant society. For example, a Chinese immigrant
who moves into a Chinese neighborhood and continues only
speaking Chinese and interacting only with other Chinese in
the immediate vicinity could be viewed as experiencing sep-
aration/segregation. Marginalization is fixed upon individual
confusion and anxiety about personal cultural identity and
relationships to larger society. This is the most negative out-
come possible, where there is no retention of cultural identity
and there is no positive relationship with dominant society.
Assimilation on its own is similar to the old melting pot idea
that new immigrants should give up their personal cultural
identities in favor of greater, more dominant societal norms.
Immigrants who changed their names upon arriving in the
United States would be acting within the assimilation out-
come of acculturation. Thus, individual cultural identity is
lost, but a positive relationship to the dominant society is
established. The final outcome of assimilation is the most
positive and is referred to as integration. This type of accul-
turation results in the retention of cultural identity and a posi-
tive relationship to dominant society. Using this model,
integration is the best acculturation outcome for psychologi-
cal well-being because of the balance struck between the cul-
ture of the home country and that of the new one. Studies
have revealed acculturation as a predictor of mental health
scores, where the more positive an acculturation outcome,
the better the psychological well-being (Ogbu, 1992; Portes
& Rumbaut, 2006; Rahman & Rollock, 2004; Yakushko
et al., 2008).
When acculturation studies have examined Chinese inter-
national students, the results have been relatively similar and
conclusive. As with other international groups, the more
Chinese international students integrate into U.S. culture, the
more positive the mental health and social outcomes
(Lowinger, He, Lin, & Chang, 2014; Zhang & Goodson,
2011). Conversely, the more isolated Chinese international
students are and the less social support they receive, the more
difficulty they will have adjusting to life in the United States
(Dao, Lee, & Chang, 2007; K. T. Wang et al., 2012; C. Wang
& Mallinckrodt, 2006; Wei et al., 2007; Yan & Berliner,
2009; Zhang & Goodson, 2011). In addition, even though
Chinese international students believe they are as intelligent
as their United States counterparts (Lowinger et al., 2014; T.
Tan & Weidman, 2013), qualitative studies have revealed
Chinese students do experience concerns about becoming
"too Americanized" during the course of their international
study (Valdez, 2015; Yuan, 2011). This fear is another illus-
tration of the acculturative stress Chinese international stu-
dents can experience.
Further research investigating Chinese international stu-
dents has revealed other pervasive issues in addition to
acculturative ones. Attending school exclusively in the
English language can be particularly challenging for Chinese
international students, who may feel comfortable reading
and writing, but find listening and speaking increasingly
more difficult (Dao et al., 2007; Lowinger et al., 2014; Smith
& Khawaja, 2011; Yuan, 2011). English language issues can
compound stress in social and classroom interactions with
non-Chinese; the stress of such interactions have been well
documented for Chinese international students in both the
United States and the United Kingdom (Smith & Khawaja,
2011; Spencer-Oatey & Xiong, 2006; T. Tan & Weidman,
2013; Valdez, 2015; Yuan, 2011). English language frustra-
tions and difficulty interacting with non-Chinese culminates
in the classroom experience, where Chinese students have
reported experiencing culturally insensitive activities, such
as a choose your favorite U.S. celebrity game, and reported a
belief that U.S. faculty and students have a negative percep-
tion of Chinese students (Smith & Khawaja, 2011; T. Tan &
Weidman, 2013; Valdez, 2015). These perceptions were
somewhat confirmed as Li and Wang (2008) reported Asian
students in general receive less classroom attention from fac-
ulty and peers.
Career Decision Making of Chinese Students
In regard to career decisions of international students, the
literature is fairly consistent noting a lack of research on the
career development needs of minorities in general andAsians
in particular (Chang, Chen, Greenberger, Dooley, &
Heckhausen, 2006; Flores et al., 2006; Leung, Ivey, &
Suzuki, 1994). The studies conducted with students across
race/ethnicity typically find that self-efficacy and parental
expectations play the largest roles in shaping career aspira-
tions, especially in Chinese students (Y. B. Chung, 2002;
Fuligni & Witkow, 2004; Louie, 2004a, 2004b). What past
studies have failed to examine is the intersection of two
issues--that is, what happens when Chinese international
students must navigate their career aspirations while han-
dling the emotional challenges associated with international
study? Leong and Serafica (1995) noted that a solid theory
has yet to be advanced about how outside pressure affects
career goals and, ultimately, career decisions for Asian work-
ers. Furthermore, research has not examined how emotional
adjustment, which is defined as collective social stress,
Cozart and Rojewski 3
anxiety, depression, sense of inadequacy, self-esteem, and
self-reliance, affects the career aspirations of Asian students,
and specifically, Chinese international students (Reynolds &
Kamphaus, 2004).
Career aspirations, meaning an individual's career-related
ambitions or decisions under perfect circumstances, have
consistently shown over time to be strong predictors of occu-
pational attainment (Rojewski, 2005). Although we may
never understand fully the impact of emotional experiences
at school on Chinese students' career aspirations, we can
gain insights and look for patterns to better understand this
phenomenon. Therefore, exploring how Chinese students
balance the emotional issues surrounding acculturation with
the career pressure of international graduate study can help
educators and counselors better know how to support and
guide these students regarding future career decisions.
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the rela-
tionship between career aspirations and emotional adjust-
ment of Chinese international graduate students. To
understand whether the scores for these constructs and sub-
sequent analysis were unique to this population, it was also
important to evaluate United States students, meaning stu-
dents of different racial and ethnic backgrounds who were
born and maintain citizenship in the United States, on the
same measures. This group did not include any other interna-
tional students or Chinese American students. Chinese inter-
national graduate student or U.S. graduate student was an
individual enrolled for a minimum of three graduate credit
hours at a large public university in the southeastern United
States during the 2010 to 2011 academic year. The Emotional
Symptoms Index (ESI) of the Behavior Assessment System
for Children, 2nd Edition (BASC-2; Reynolds & Kamphaus,
2004) measured emotional adjustment, which included mea-
sures of social stress, anxiety, depression, sense of inade-
quacy, self-esteem, and self-reliance. The dependent variable,
career aspirations, referred to an individual's career-related
ambitions or decisions under ideal conditions (Rojewski,
2005). The primary research question framed the design and
analysis for this study as a regression analysis as we sought
to determine the best set of emotional adjustment variables to
explain the career aspirations of Chinese international and
U.S. graduate students.
Theoretical Framework
Social cognitive career theory (SCCT; Lent, Brown, &
Hackett, 1994) emphasizes that self-efficacy, outcome expec-
tations, and goals work in conjunction with other aspects of
each person, such as family background, socioeconomic sta-
tus, immigrant status, and ethnicity, to shape career goals. This
means that career development is ultimately a series of inter-
locking processes of interest development, choice, and perfor-
mance. SCCT is largely a derivative of Bandura's (1986)
social cognitive theory, which features the importance of indi-
viduals in facilitating their own occupations, interests, and
aspirations, as well as the factors that can enhance or detract
this facilitation. SCCT further postulates that positive career
development depends on individual experiences resulting
from interactions with the environment and personal factors
(Yakushko et al., 2008).
In the SCCT framework, self-efficacy refers to individual
appraisals of capabilities to take action and succeed toward a
specific goal, and it is a dynamic attribute that is always
changing (Lent, 2005; Lent et al., 1994). This construct is the
one that best fits with the idea of emotional adjustment in
SCCT, as emotional well-being is likely to influence indi-
vidual perceptions of their ability to work toward and achieve
personal goals. The second major component of SCCT is
outcome expectations, and it refers to the question "If I do
this, what will happen?" In other words, outcome expecta-
tions are the "imagined consequences of particular behav-
iors" (Lent et al., 1994, p. 83). In the case of this study,
outcome expectations are viewed as a manifestation of inter-
nal behavior factors, such as parents, peers, and the cross-
cultural experience influencing Chinese international
students. The final construct of SCCT asserts that goals are
an important piece of the self-regulation of behavior (Lent
et al., 1994). Lent et al. (1994) also identified three major
outcomes of goals: They organize and guide behavior; they
can sustain behavior over long periods of time, even without
external reinforcement; and their presence increases the like-
lihood that the individual will attain the desired outcomes.
SCCT (Lent et al., 1994) was applied in this study of
Chinese international students to provide a theoretical frame-
work for organizing variables such as career aspirations and
emotional adjustment in relationships (Mau & Bikos, 2000).
The three main components of SCCT--self-efficacy, out-
come expectations, and goal expectations--align well with
the constructs associated with this study. Self-efficacy relates
to emotional adjustment, outcome expectations relate to inter-
nal behavior factors that will be in play with emotional adjust-
ment, and goal expectations relate to career aspirations. A
model showing this alignment appears in Figure 1, where the
major constructs of SCCT each have an associated factor.
Another important consideration in the selection of a the-
oretical framework is its application to use with students
from ethnic or racial minorities in the United States. SCCT is
one of the only theories of career development that ade-
quately accounts for the role of the individual, which means
this theory allows and expects variation based on ethnicity.
For this reason, SCCT is the theoretical framework of choice
for many career-related studies involving students from eth-
nic or racial minorities in the United States (Kiang, Yip,
Gonzales-Backen, Witkow, & Fuligni, 2006; Mau & Bikos,
2000; Navarro, Flores, & Worthington, 2007; Yakushko
et al., 2008). In summary, SCCT (Lent et al., 1994) was
applied in a completed study of Chinese international stu-
dents to provide a theoretical framework for organizing vari-
ables such as career aspirations and emotional adjustment in
relationships.

Method
Research Design
A comparative correlational research design, using a group-
administered survey, was utilized for this study. Correlational
research identifies the relationship between two or more
variables from the same sample (Huberty & Petoskey, 1999).
Because this study was focused on determining the relation-
ship between career aspirations and emotional adjustment
for Chinese international graduate students, a correlational
research design was chosen where data were analyzed using
regression analysis.
Population and Sample
The abstract population for this study was composed of
Chinese international students attending institutions of
higher education in the United States. Chinese international
students refer to students pursuing graduate study in the
United States, but who maintain citizenship in China.
Graduate students were selected for this study, as the univer-
sity used for the sample included significantly more Chinese
international graduate students than undergraduate. To
understand differences experienced by international students
from U.S. ones, a comparison sample of U.S. graduate stu-
dents was also collected. U.S. students refer to students of
different ethnic and racial backgrounds, but who were born
and maintain citizenship in the United States. This group did
not include any additional international or Chinese American
students. Because of the cost and time challenges associated
with contacting all members of the abstract population, a
convenience sample of Chinese international students and
U.S. students enrolled at a large, southeastern university was
surveyed. Using Olejnik's (1984) guidelines, a sample size
of 66 participants was needed based on an estimated medium
effect size, an alpha level of .05, and statistical power of .70.
The two questionnaires used for this study were adminis-
tered to both Chinese and U.S. college students enrolled in
graduate degree programs at the university. Participants
completed the questionnaires in five different group admin-
istrations from October 2010 to February 2011. Surveys
were administered to U.S. graduate students in a graduate
statistics course and a graduate political science course, and
to Chinese international students at international coffee hour,
a dinner through university housing, and an open-call survey
event on campus. Each participant only attended one admin-
istration. The final sample size of Chinese students was
n = 24 and U.S. students was n = 46, for a total of 70 partici-
pants, once questionnaires containing incomplete responses,
extraneous international student responses, and outliers were
removed.
The gender distribution of participants from both Chinese
and U.S. student groups was similar, with each group of stu-
dents including half males and half females, even though this
is not representative of the university as a whole. This differ-
ence may be a result of the convenience sampling strategy
employed for this study. However, there was more variation
between the groups in terms of age, department of study, and
time at the university. The average age for Chinese students
participating in the study was 25.4 years (SD = 3.79), and
more than one third (n = 9) were students within the College
of Arts and Sciences. Other majors represented in Chinese
participants included, College of Education (n = 2), College
of Pharmacy (n = 2), School of Public and International
Affairs (n = 2), College of Agriculture and Environmental
Sciences (n = 3), College of Family and Consumer Science
(n = 1), College of Journalism (n = 3), School of Law (n = 1),
and the College of Veterinary Medicine (n = 1). Furthermore,
67% (n = 16) of participants had been in the United States for
less than 1 year. All Chinese students participating in the sur-
vey, except for one, had been studying at the university for
less than 3 years.
Of the U.S. students who completed surveys, the com-
bined average age was 28.74 (SD = 7.48), indicating a slightly
older group than the Chinese students. In terms of department
of study, U.S. students were more homogeneous than the
Chinese students. U.S. students who participated in the study
were mainly students within the College of Education and the

Instrument
This study required instruments that measured two different
variables--emotional adjustment and career aspirations.
There was not a single instrument that addressed both these
issues; therefore, multiple instruments were used. The
BASC-2 (Reynolds & Kamphaus, 2004) was used to mea-
sure emotional adjustment. The BASC-2 is comprised of five
different measures of behavior, including the Teacher Rating
scale (TRS), Parent Rating scale (PRS), Self-Report of
Personality (SRP), Structured Developmental History
(SDH), and Student Observation System (SOS). The mea-
sures can be used collectively or independently, and the SRP
has been used in many studies as a reliable method for deter-
mining the emotional condition of foreign students (Demaray,
Malecki, Davidson, Hodgson, & Rebus, 2005; Jung &
Stinnett, 2005; Z. Zhou, Peverly, Xin, Huang, & Wang,
2003). There are three different versions of the SRP specific
to children, adolescents, and college students. Only the SRP
for college-aged students was used because it included a spe-
cific form to measure emotional disturbance/adjustment,
which was the interest for this study. The SRP took about 20
to 30 min to complete, and included True/False and 4-point
Likert-type items with never, sometimes, often, or almost
always response options. Once completed, the college form
yielded four different composite scores: Internalizing
Problems, Inattention/Hyperactivity, Personal Adjustment,
and the ESI. Whereas all scores were tabulated, only the ESI
scores were analyzed, as they were the most directly related
to this study. The ESI is composed of the summative scores
from six different scales including social stress, anxiety,
depression, sense of inadequacy, self-esteem, and self-reli-
ance. The BASC-2 manual (Reynolds & Kamphaus, 2004)
provided reliability estimates for internal consistency and
test­retest reliability. Overall, internal consistency coeffi-
cients calculated by age range and gender for SRP scores
were reported in the middle .90s for the ESI, indicating the
coefficient was sufficiently reliable for testing emotional
adjustment (C. S. Tan, 2007). The SRP included three differ-
ent indexes to evaluate the validity of individual responses,
F, V, and L, each of which identified unlikely response pat-
terns by participants and questionably valid results. None of
the participants in this study had scores outside of the normal
range on any of these indexes. Cronbach's alpha values were
also calculated to show internal consistency of scores. These
values were .809 for all students together, .795 for Chinese
students, and .821 for U.S. students. Values greater than .70
are considered acceptable for social science research (Gall,
Gall, & Borg, 2007). Finally, the ESI from the SRP has suc-
cessfully been used in other studies to evaluate the emotional
well-being of foreign-born students from a non-diagnostic
approach, even though the instrument was normed using the
general U.S. population (Demaray et al., 2005; Jung &
Stinnett, 2005; Z. Zhou et al., 2003).
In addition to evaluating emotional adjustment, we also
examined career aspirations. Career aspirations were mea-
sured by an open-ended question included in the demo-
graphic questionnaire. Specifically, the question asked, "If
you were completely free to choose any job in any setting,
what job would you most like to have 10 years from now?"
without using any specific prompts or job lists. This question
allowed each participant to record a single career aspiration.
To quantify the open-ended responses about desired career,
answers were categorized as a continuous variable using
four-digit prestige codes from the Socioeconomic Index
(SEI; Nakao & Treas, 1992). The SEI includes 13 different
occupational groups that are further broken down into 504
separate occupations. The four-digit prestige codes range
from 17.07 (shoe machine operator) to 97.16 (physician),
with higher codes reflecting higher prestige occupations and
lower codes less prestigious ones. Reliability and validity
were addressed for the career aspirations instrument by con-
ducting a pilot study of eight international students who did
not overlap with the sample in the main study. The pilot
study served two purposes--one, it allowed for testing of the
career aspirations question, and two, it provided an opportu-
nity to become familiar with the coding and recording of
responses using the SEI and the BASC-2.
The student questionnaire also included questions regard-
ing degree level, age, major, length of time in the United
States, educational and occupational information for both
parents, and parental career aspirations. Although these
were not the focus of this study, the literature showed these
were important factors to consider when evaluating Chinese
international students (R. H. G. Chung, 2001; Lee, 2007;
Leung, Hou, Gati, & Li, 2011; Louie, 2004a, 2004b; Park,
2003; M. Zhou, 2009). Thus, these questions were included
to provide additional context for understanding and inter-
preting results.
Research Procedures
Permission to conduct this research was granted through the
institutional review board (IRB) at the university, and data
collection began in October of 2010. There were three survey
times for Chinese international students and two survey
times for U.S. students for a total of five different administra-
tions. Participants were recruited throughout this time period
and only participated in one administration. Data collection
was completed in February of 2011. Both groups of partici-
pants anonymously completed the BASC-2 and demographic
questionnaire, which included the career aspirations ques-
tion. A translator was available for Chinese students during
each survey administration to help with any language-based
questions, and all participants were reminded that if they
were uncomfortable or wanted to cease participation, they
could at any time.
6 SAGE Open
Data Analysis
Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to evaluate
each of the research questions. Analyses were completed
using the SPSS. Means and standard deviations were tabu-
lated to compare the career aspirations and emotional adjust-
ment between Chinese international and U.S. students.
Multiple regression analysis was also used to determine the
relationship between career aspirations and emotional adjust-
ment, as well as to determine which emotional adjustment
variables best explain career choice.
Results
Prestige scores for Chinese international students' career
aspirations ranged from 34.44 (housewife) to 97.16 (physi-
cian), whereas U.S. students ranged from 34.44 (housewife)
to 87.49 (biological science teacher). A majority of students
from both groups aspired to high prestige occupations. The
most common response across both groups was professor,
which has a prestige score of 86.98 when a specific field is
not identified. Chinese international students had a mean
prestige score of 78.76 (SD = 13.92); U.S. students reported
a mean prestige score of 77.62 (SD = 13.96). An independent
samples t test for group mean difference showed no statisti-
cally significant difference between Chinese international
and U.S. students' career aspirations.
Emotional adjustment scores were obtained by calculat-
ing a score for the ESI within the SRP form from the BASC-2
(Reynolds & Kamphaus, 2004); possible ESI scores range
from 22 to 100. Chinese international students scored an
average ESI score of 47.5 (SD = 6.3), whereas U.S. students
reported an average score of 45.9 (SD = 6.8). Scores falling
between 41 and 59 are considered average within the general
population. An independent samples t test for group mean
difference showed there was no statistically significant dif-
ference between Chinese and U.S. students' emotional
adjustment.
To determine the nature of the relationship between career
aspirations and ESI subscales, individual correlations were
calculated for each of the ESI subscales with each other and
then with career aspirations. Statistically significant relation-
ships were present for almost all of the emotional adjustment
subscales with each other in all three analyses. However,
there were no significant relationships found between each
of these variables and career aspirations. Social stress had
the highest correlation with career aspirations for U.S. stu-
dents (r = .251), whereas depression had the highest correla-
tion (r = .241) for Chinese international students.
The completed regression model for Chinese international
students of all the variables revealed an R2 = .210 and
adjusted R2 = -.068, indicating a minimal relationship
between emotional adjustment components and career aspi-
rations. The negative adjusted R2 value also indicated the
model included variables that were not helpful in predicting
career outcomes. The omnibus test of all independent vari-
ables was not statistically significant where F(6, 17) = 0.755,
p = .614 with  = .05. Calculated p values for the indepen-
dent variables to test their predictive value on career aspira-
tions showed that no ESI components were statistically
significant predictors of career aspirations. The completed
regression model for U.S. students of all the variables
revealed an R2 = .228 and adjusted R2 = .109, still indicating
a minimal relationship, but higher than the relationship seen
with Chinese international students. In addition, the omnibus
test of all independent variables was not statistically signifi-
cant where F(6, 39) = 1.915, p = .103 with  = .05. Calculated
p values for the independent variables revealed that social
stress (p = .011) was a statistically significant predictor of
career aspirations. Therefore, multiple regression analysis
for Chinese international and U.S. students together and sep-
arately found a minimal relationship between emotional
adjustment and career aspirations for this sample, but did
show social stress as a statistically significant predictor of
career aspirations for U.S. students. Complete regression sta-
tistics for both groups are presented in Table 1.
Discussion and Conclusion
Not unexpectedly, both Chinese international and U.S. grad-
uate students aspired to high prestige occupations, with most
students aspiring to be college professors in various subjects.
The emotional adjustment scores of both groups were con-
sistent with scores typically from the general population.
Statistically significant differences did not exist between
these groups on either career aspirations or emotional adjust-
ment; rather, both groups displayed striking similarities
given their divergent backgrounds and cultures. A strong
relationship was not present between career aspirations and
emotional adjustment, though Social Stress, one of the emo-
tional adjustment subscales, did have a small but statistically
significant predictive value on career aspirations for U.S.
students.
Given that previous studies have documented unique
emotional challenges faced by Chinese international stu-
dents, particularly in navigating a new culture (Tan &
Weidman, 2013; Yan & Berliner, 2009; Zhang & Goodson,
2011; Z. Zhou et al., 2003), it is surprising that Chinese inter-
national students in this study did not demonstrate any emo-
tional adjustment group differences when compared with
U.S. students. Although speculative, this lack of difference
may be attributed to the fact that all students were graduate
students with similar career goals, and as a result, any differ-
ences were mitigated. Undergraduate or high school students
may exhibit emotional adjustment differences simply due to
immaturity or lack of development whereas graduate stu-
dents have learned how to overcome or cope with emotional
issues through additional life experience (Luzzo, 2000). It is
also possible, as Hsu (2010) reported, that Chinese who
make the decision to attend school in the United States may
Cozart and Rojewski 7
be more "extroverted and open to experience" (p. 422) than
those students who choose to pursue graduate study within
China. If true, then those Chinese students included in this
sample may be closer to U.S. students in emotional adjust-
ment and career aspirations than expected.
A few studies have reported that the graduate school
experience can transcend other factors, such as socioeco-
nomic or immigrant status. Moss (2005) found socioeco-
nomic status and cultural capital were not statistically
significant predictors of graduate student achievement.
Fuligni and Witkow (2004) found that immigrant students
performed as well as United States-born students in postsec-
ondary settings regardless of type of degree pursued or grade
point average, with East Asian students having the most pos-
itive academic achievement. This is particularly interesting
given graduate school in and of itself is a stressful experi-
ence, particularly regarding academic performance, work,
and finances (Oswalt & Riddock, 2007)--stressors that cer-
tainly transcend cultural barriers. In any event, it appears that
the select groups of Chinese and U.S. students in this study
were more alike than different on the factors examined, and
for graduate students, educational similarities appear to out-
weigh cultural differences. This outcome is especially inter-
esting when considering the role of culture and education on
the development and implementation of career aspirations.
The lack of difference is also interesting given that a
majority of Chinese students in this study (66.7%, n = 16)
had been in the United States and at this specific university
for less than 1 year. Acculturation studies have revealed that
the first year is often the most difficult for an immigrant
adjusting to a new country and culture (Lo, 2010; Tong,
2010; Tsai, Ying, & Lee, 2000). Language barriers and dif-
ficulties finding a strong friendship community are further
challenges to the early immigrant experience (Chae & Foley,
2010; Hsu, 2010; Zhang, Mandl, & Wang, 2010), plus the
hardship of being away from family and friends. Other stud-
ies that have examined the experiences of Chinese interna-
tional students have also found "culture shock," language
differences, and interactions with non-Chinese students as
additional hurdles (Spencer-Oatey & Xiong, 2006; T. Tan &
Weidman, 2013; Valdez, 2015; Zhang & Goodson, 2011).
The challenges associated with the immigrant experience
would subsequently lead to the conclusion that members of
this group would have shown heightened emotional issues
simply given the nature of their current life stage and limited
time living in the United States. However, the results of this
study are consistent with the results of K. T. Wang et al.
(2012), who found the majority of Chinese international stu-
dents did not experience strong levels of mental stress during
their cultural transition into the United States.
The limitations of this study should also be acknowl-
edged, perhaps the greatest of which is the sample of stu-
dents. This was not a random sample, and the sample size
was smaller than one would expect in a regression analysis.
Furthermore, by only sampling one southeastern university
population, the study is limited by the responses from this
group and is less generalizable. The responses from students
at smaller colleges could be drastically different and more
stressful, in the same way student experiences in larger
Chinese communities may have been better due to more
community support. There is also the chance for bias given
that even though the instruments were tested with interna-
tional populations, they were not normed for use with
Chinese students. Chinese undergraduate students could also
offer greater variance in career goals than graduate students,
who often have more similar occupational ambitions.
Furthermore, it is possible that the lack of observable dif-
ference may have resulted from the low Chinese sample size
and sampling strategy. Because most participants were con-
tacted personally, the sample may have neglected to include

Chinese students who were more socially isolated, thus
skewing results to represent only more outgoing, well-
adjusted students (i.e., Chinese students having a more dif-
ficult time adjusting would not be as likely to attend an open
survey call). This would be consistent with the findings of
Zhang and Goodson (2011), who found no depressive or psy-
chological issues in Chinese international students who felt
they could successfully navigate U.S. culture and remained
connected in a community of other Chinese. Another possi-
ble explanation for Chinese responses is positive outreach
programs sponsored by the university that are designed to
help students make the transition to study in the United
States. For example, there are six different student organiza-
tions specifically dedicated to the needs of Chinese students
on campus, not to mention other services available to all
international students through the Office of International
Education and International Student Life, such as socials,
information sessions, and trips. However, because the
Chinese international students did not demonstrate any prob-
lems and inquiries to students' specific experiences were not
a part of this study, it certainly makes a compelling case for
future research to provide in-depth study of the experiences
these students have while studying in the United States.
In terms of career aspirations, the literature is fairly con-
sistent in noting that little research has been conducted on the
career development needs of minorities andAsians in particu-
lar (Chang et al., 2006; Flores et al., 2006; Leung et al., 1994).
The studies that have been conducted with students across
race/ethnicity typically find that self-efficacy and parental
expectations play the largest role in shaping aspirations (Y. B.
Chung, 2002; Fuligni & Witkow, 2004; Louie, 2004a, 2004b).
Furthermore, Liu (2009) reported acculturation was a statisti-
cally significant predictor of career self-efficacy for interna-
tional graduate students. Self-efficacy refers to individual
appraisals of capabilities to take action and succeed toward a
specific goal, and it is a dynamic attribute that is always
changing (Lent, 2005; Lent et al., 1994). This construct relates
to the idea of emotional adjustment, as emotional well-being
is likely to influence individual perceptions of their ability to
work toward and achieve personal goals.
Subsequently, given the results of other studies and the
nature of SCCT (Lent et al., 1994), we expected to find some
relationship between career aspirations and emotional adjust-
ment. The regression model found a minimal relationship
between these variables, showing that the aspects of emo-
tional adjustment accounted for roughly 10% of career aspira-
tions for domestic students and did not account for career
aspirations of Chinese students. This opens many more ques-
tions about what factors contribute to how these students
make career decisions. For example, what is the role of par-
ents in career decision making, particularly for Chinese inter-
national students? If parents were guiding students' career
aspirations, then career aspirations could lead to emotional
adjustment issues, ultimately making emotional adjustment
dependent on career aspirations--the inverse of how these
variables were explored in this study.
The supplemental information collected on the demo-
graphic questionnaire showed Chinese international stu-
dents' parents had higher than average occupational levels
than U.S. students, but U.S. students' parents had higher
educational attainment. Therefore, it is difficult to know
exactly how much influence parents were exerting in stu-
dents' decisions because parental relationships were not sig-
nificantly explored. This lack of information could cloud
results given parent­child relationships have been strong
career predictors in other studies (Chung, 2002; Y. B. Fuligni
& Witkow, 2004; Louie, 2004a, 2004b). Also, these results
confirm little about the group of students itself, whereby the
entire population of this study acts perhaps as an outlier
because of the homogeneous nature of graduate students.
Thus, whereas some career theories (e.g., Lent et al., 1994;
Super, 1990) suggest culture and emotional well-being should
play a significant role in career decision making, this study
showed that the educational similarities of graduate students
seemed to overshadow the influence of cultural and psycho-
logical differences.
Although this study was more exploratory than explana-
tory in terms of better understanding the relationship between
emotional adjustment and career decision making in Chinese
international students, it does open interesting avenues to
guide future research and practice. Because of the impor-
tance of personal relationships in recruiting participants, it
would be interesting to see similar questions about the expe-
riences of Chinese international graduate students through
qualitative research and focus on in-depth interviews with a
few students. This study would also be interesting to see
evaluating all international students, not just Chinese. In
terms of practice, it is important for career counselors and
educators to make sure Chinese students are not being over-
looked in terms of counseling and educational services that
are currently available. Literature has shown Asian students
receive less classroom attention from teachers and peers and
have less access to resources for psychological and career
needs, as well as face potentially negative perceptions by fac-
ulty and other university students (Kim & Yeh, 2002; Li &
Wang, 2008; Valdez, 2015); thus, it is important to be sure
Chinese students on college campuses have equal access to
services as their U.S. peers. Because social stress was a sig-
nificant predictor of career aspirations for all of the students
in this study, it is important for college administrators to be
aware of the social stress associated with graduate school and
to provide necessary resources to help mitigate any negative
effects this may have on graduate student performance.
