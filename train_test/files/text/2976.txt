Background: To forecast adult patient outcomes in the
management of hyperlipidemia using adult National
Health and Examination Survey III (NHANES III) popu-
lation statistics and National Cholesterol Education Pro-
gram (NCEP) guidelines for goals of therapy.
Methods: Review of the hyperlipidemia drug therapy
English-language medical literature with emphasis on
randomized controlled trials of more than 6 weeks'
duration published in the last 7 years, product package
inserts, US Food and Drug Administration submission
information, and NHANES III population statistics.
Data were extracted from studies of lipid-lowering
therapy to modify low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels
for primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart
disease. The data that were evaluated included sample
size, study design, therapeutic intervention, length of
study, percentage change in LDL levels, and patient
demographics.
Results: Cumulative frequency curves of the LDL dis-
tribution among the US adult population were con-
structed. The mean efficacy of drug therapy from quali-
fied studies was used to extrapolate the percentage of the
population expected to respond to the intervention and
to forecast the patient outcome.
Conclusions: A useful tool for clinicians was con-
structed to approximate the percentage of patients, based
on risk stratification, who would reach NCEP target goal
after a given pharmacotherapeutic intervention to de-
crease LDL levels.

CORONARY HEART disease
(CHD)istheleadingcause
of death in men and wom-
enintheUnitedStates.Al-
though CHD risk in wom-
en lags approximately 10 years behind that
of men, the incidence of CHD in women in-
creases progressively after menopause un-
til ultimately as many women as men die
of CHD.1 While gender is one differential
risk factor in the onset of CHD, strong evi-
dence exists that other risk factors contrib-
ute to the prevalence and incidence of
CHD.2-6 Risk factors identified as modifi-
able are cigarette smoking, hypertension,
low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) lev-
els, and diabetes mellitus. Risk factors iden-
tified as nonmodifiable are age and family
history of premature CHD. Both modifi-
able and nonmodifiable risk factors can be
present for many years before clinical CHD
develops. This long lead time presents an
opportunity to modify the risk factors to
avoid or delay morbidity and mortality.
However, a substantial investment in dis-
ease management is required before the
long-term benefits are realized.
Epidemiological evidence supports a
direct relationship between the level of to-
tal blood cholesterol, specifically low-
density lipoprotein (LDL) concentra-
tion, and the rate of CHD.3-5,7 In addition,
clinical trials have shown that a reduc-
tion in the LDL level leads to a reduction
in the number of CHD events.8-19 Re-
cently, several trials using angiographic as-
sessment have demonstrated that lower-
ing serum cholesterol levels slows
progression and produces regression of
coronary atherosclerosis in some pa-
tients.17,20-26 In 1993, the National Cho-
lesterol Education Program's (NCEP's) Ex-
pert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and
Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in
Adults1,2 updated its 1988 report on cho-
lesterol management and recommended
linking treatment decisions to the pa-
tient's risk for CHD. Nonlipid risk fac-
tors, such as cigarette smoking, hyperten-
sion, obesity, physical inactivity, and
diabetes mellitus, can be modified to help
reduce CHD risk. Although all risk fac-
tors contribute to the clinical condition of
CHD, the focus of this analysis is the modi-

METHODS
Many drug interventions are available to reduce LDL levels
in patients. Whether a patient reaches an NCEP target goal
for risk reduction from CHD depends on several factors, in-
cludingthepotencyofthedrugintervention,thestartingLDL
level of the patient, the target LDL level, genetic variations,
and potential differences in drug metabolism. For this evalu-
ation, appropriate patient identification strategies, interven-
tions, and counseling on lifestyle modifications are assumed
to have occurred; whatever benefit there was from diet and
counseling has been achieved; and the drug therapy is the
cause of further LDL reduction. The target goals for modifi-
cation of the LDL risk factor are defined by the second re-
port of the NCEP's Expert Panel1 and are stratified for pri-
mary prevention (patients without established CHD) and
secondary prevention (patients with established symptom-
atic CHD). Although there is evidence of the beneficial ef-
fects of reducing total cholesterol and/or increasing HDL lev-
els,27 total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratios or LDL-HDL
ratios were not included in the NCEP guidelines,1,2 and thus
were not evaluated in this analysis.
Patients were stratified by risk categories, and target
reductions in LDL concentration to reach treatment goals
were based on data from the National Health and Nutri-
tional Examination Survey III (NHANES III) (National Cen-
ter for Health Statistics, unpublished data, 1993) and NCEP
guidelines, which assume an LDL reduction of 10% with
diet therapy alone.1,28,29 Primary and secondary preven-
tion patients were assumed to respond to drug interven-
tion with a similar percentage decrease in LDL level.30
DATA ACQUISITION
A MEDLINE search was conducted of the English-
language medical literature published from 1984 to 1998,
with emphasis on articles published since 1991. The spe-
cific intent of the search was to gather data on drug thera-
pies classified as "major classes" by NCEP to evaluate the
effect of the drug therapy on LDL levels in patients. Data
on the response of different subgroups of patients, ie, those
with CHD vs a general population cohort, were reviewed
for evidence of a difference in LDL reduction.
Search terms included hyperlipidemia, hyperlipid-
emia/drug therapy, coronary heart disease, HMG-CoA
reductase inhibitors, niacin, and bile acid sequestrants. The
search was limited to the English language, human sub-
jects, randomized controlled trials, and drug therapy.
Articles meeting these criteria were reviewed for poten-
tial data extraction.
DATA EXTRACTION
Articles were reviewed by one reviewer (K.L.B.). A deter-
mination of study quality was made on the basis of scien-
tific rigor, study design, and publication in peer-reviewed
journals, with the exception of data reviewed by the Food
and Drug Administration as a component of the drug-
approval process. General principles for reporting results
of clinical trials in biomedical literature were applied to the
studies.31 Large studies with randomization, blinding of in-
vestigators, and parallel placebo control, or crossover de-
signs were preferred over small open-label studies. Data were
collected on sample size, LDL reduction, mean LDL reduc-
tion, drug therapy, serial measurements of LDL reduction
if a dose-titration study, and length of study. A weighted
mean LDL reduction was calculated and used as a variable
for the percentage of patients who reach target goal. The
weighted mean was calculated from the total number of pa-
tients per study, multiplied by the mean LDL reduction.
The number was summed with the result of similar calcu-
lations for other studies examining the same drug inter-
vention. The resultant number was divided by the total
(pooled) number of patients. An expert panel of practic-
ing clinical consultants consisting of a cardiologist, an in-
ternist, a family practitioner, 2 pharmacists, and a dieti-
cian reviewed the reference selection to validate an
appropriate representation of the literature. The physi-
cian consultants were selected from a list of consultants
maintained by the military services offices of the surgeons
general. The pharmacists and dietician were selected based
on clinical reputation within the Department of Defense.
Data from NHANES III (phase I) (1988-1991) were
obtained from the US Department of Health and Human
Services, Public Health Services. These data contained risk
factor information and LDL values for persons older than
20 years. The risk factors were stratified by presence of CHD,
2 or more risk factors without CHD, fewer than 2 risk fac-
tors without CHD, sex, and ethnicity. A cumulative fre-
quency curve of LDL values for each risk category was con-
structed (Figure). This curve was used to estimate the
percentage of patients expected to achieve the minimum
LDL reduction to meet the NCEP guidelines.
DATA SYNTHESIS
To forecast patient outcomes, a spreadsheet (Lotus 1-2-3,
release version 4.01 for Windows; Lotus Development Corp,
Cambridge, Mass) was constructed to determine the maxi-
mum LDL level a person may have and still reach NCEP
targets given the efficacy of a therapeutic intervention
(Table 1). The formula was as follows:
Maximum LDL Level =
100% (Target LDL Level)
% LDL Reduction
The mean percentage LDL reduction was obtained from
Table 2,32-93 and the maximum LDL level to reach NCEP
target was read from Table 1. This maximum LDL level was
then plotted in the Figure, the intersection of the LDL level
distribution curve was determined, and the cumulative per-
centage of patients reaching NCEP target for a particular
drug therapy was determined.
For example, from Table 2, the mean percentage of
LDL reduction for 20 mg of pravastatin sodium is 24.8%.
In Table 1, the 24.8% (round the percentage to the nearest
whole number) reduction in LDL corresponds to an ap-
proximate maximum LDL level of 4.45 mmol/L (172 mg/
dL) to reach the 3.36-mmol/L (130-mg/dL) target NCEP
LDL level. On the x-axis of the Figure, 4.45 mmol/L (172
mg/dL) is noted and, moving vertically, the intersection of
the "High-Risk Male" curve is determined. A horizontal line
is drawn to the y-axis and the cumulative percentage of high-
risk males who will achieve a target NCEP LDL level with
20 mg of pravastatin is noted to be approximately 87%. This
process was conducted for all drug interventions and pa-
tient stratifications reported in Table 3.

fication of LDL cholesterol levels. Modification of LDL
cholesterol levels are used by NCEP as a surrogate out-
come of decreased cardiac morbidity and mortality. The
purpose of this analysis is to approximate the number
of patients from a population perspective that would reach
NCEP target LDL levels based on drug intervention.
RESULTS
Published data from the clinical trials on the LDL reduc-
tion provided by a drug therapy, merged with data from
NHANES III, provide a useful scale for estimating the
percentage of a patient population who will reach the
target LDL level with a given therapy under ideal con-
ditions (Table 3).
The anticipated outcome varies based on the inter-
vention strategies for the patient risk category. While male
and female have some small numerical differences in the
percentage of population reaching target goal of therapy,
it cannot be determined at this time if this is a true dif-
ference, an artifact of the imprecise risk factor classifi-
cation of the NCEP guidelines, difference in drug therapy,
or some other reason. The studies included in our analy-
sis did not necessarily report data by sex of patients, and
some studies did not include women in their protocols.
In addition to directly reading forecast outcomes for
monotherapy from Table 3, it can also be used to fore-
cast the outcomes of combination therapy. When com-
bination therapy is required for lipid lowering, the LDL
reduction with drug therapy is additive within normal
dosing ranges.21,35,36,45-51,63,73,78,88,91,94-98 For example, 20 mg
of fluvastatin provides an approximate 20% LDL reduc-
tion as monotherapy.36,45-55 Niacin, 3 g, provides an ap-
proximate 21% LDL reduction as monotherapy.19,51,76
When these drugs are administered as combination
therapy, this combination provides approximately a 41%
LDL reduction.48,50,51 A 41% LDL reduction corresponds
to approximately 99% of both male and female patients
in the primary prevention categories reaching NCEP tar-
get LDL levels, and about 81% and 86% of male and fe-
male patients, respectively, in the secondary prevention
category reaching NCEP target LDL level.
COMMENT
Targeting the at-risk patients for prevention and treat-
ment is potentially more efficient than offering population-
wide efforts as evidenced by data from the Framingham
Study7 and the Helsinki Heart Study.10,99 Although the
NCEP patient stratification is not as precise as other strati-
fication models,100 the NCEP treatment guidelines are rela-
tively easy to use.
Patients with established CHD should be aggres-
sively treated to prevent further cardiac events. With the
exception of high-risk females, patients with estab-
lished CHD apparently have a lower mean LDL level than
do patients in most other cholesterol groups (Figure).
However, since the LDL target is lower than in the other
patient groups, the overall percentage of LDL reduction
required is greater. To reach the treatment goal in this
group, the use of a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coen-
zyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor is required. In

addition, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been
shown to decrease mortality in patients with CHD.14,24,101
Patients with 2 or more risk factors for CHD, but
without a diagnosis of CHD (primary prevention), gen-
erally do not need to be as aggressively treated as those
with established CHD. A wide range of therapeutic
interventions are available to the clinician.
Most patients with moderate primary hypercholes-
terolemia, with fewer than 2 risk factors, and without a
diagnosis of CHD or without heterozygous familial hy-
percholesterolemia can be effectively treated with virtu-
ally any intervention. Clinical judgment should dictate
whether diet therapy alone can reach treatment goals be-
fore initiating individualized drug therapy.
Patients who require a substantial reduction in LDL
may not achieve it with monotherapy. This is because
there is a diminishing return in LDL reduction expected
from increasing the dose of a drug (Table 2). The lipid-
lowering effects of many drugs, especially the HMG-
CoA reductase inhibitors, tend to follow a log-linear re-
lationship and reach a dose plateau. As the dose is
increased, less of a response is realized.32,79,91,102
In applying the results of this analysis, the limita-
tions of the methods and the extrapolation into clini-
cal practice must be considered. The first limitation is
the trials evaluated for inclusion in the analysis. Since
we primarily focused on randomized controlled trials
from 1991 to the present, earlier trials are underrepre-
sented. Seven years of clinical trials may not provide
sufficient patient sampling to draw conclusions since
some trials had very few patients. The second limita-
tion is using a mean percentage LDL reduction to esti-
mate the percentage of population who will reach tar-
get NCEP goal. In this study, we made the assumption
that the observed mean percentage of LDL reduction
approximated a true population mean percentage of
LDL reduction, and there are minimal deviations of
observations from the mean. The appropriateness of
using a mean percentage of LDL reduction increases as
the amount of deviation from the mean decreases. The
third limitation is the extrapolation of sex difference
from the studies. Many of the studies used in develop-
ing Table 3 are based on male-only data. We assumed
patients in either of the 3 NCEP risk categories
respond with a similar LDL level lowering with the
same drug therapy. It is not clear if both male and
female patients will have similar LDL level lowering
with the same drug therapy. In a recent review, Walsh
and Grady103 noted that women have been underrepre-
sented in clinical trials of the treatment of hyperlipid-
emia. The authors conclude that since the natural his-
tory of CHD differs in men and women, data from
studies in men should not simply be extrapolated to
women. A fourth limitation is that data were extracted
by one reviewer (K.L.B.). While this makes the extrac-
tion process consistent, perhaps a better method
would be to have 2 or more reviewers extract data
from each study, then compare for deviations between

CONCLUSION
Population data and drug efficacy data can be used to fore-
cast patient outcomes. This study used NCEP targets as
goals of therapy. Meeting LDL level goals is recognized
as a surrogate for a decrease in morbidity and mortality
from coronary disease. Forecasting methods as pre-
sented here can be used to assess the potential burden
of illness such as coronary artery disease in a popula-
tion. While this analysis focuses on hyperlipidemia, other
chronic disease states, such as hypertension, diabetes
mellitus, or acid-peptic disorders, may be amenable to
similar analysis depending on available data. Great po-
tential exists to use forecasting methods in cost-
effectiveness analysis and the development of disease-
state treatment guidelines.

*Data compiled from the National Health and Examination Survey III and clinical trials. Goal for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) reduction based on the National
Cholesterol Education Program recommendations. Numbers rounded to nearest whole number.
To evaluate combination therapy with this table, first find the mean percentage of LDL reduction for each drug regimen to be combined. Add together the mean
percentage of LDL reduction from each of the drug regimens. Use the sum of the mean percentage of LDL reductions and find this value in the mean percentage
of LDL reduction column. Move across the columns to find the percentage of the population optimally treated for each of the 6 patient stratification groups. For
example, if pravastatin, 10 mg/d (20% reduction) and colestipol, 5 g/d (15% reduction) are used for combination therapy, the total mean percentage of LDL
reduction would be 35%. For males, this percentage of LDL reduction corresponds to approximately 99% of the population with fewer than 2 risk factors,
approximately 99% of the population with 2 or more risk factors, or approximately 72% of the population with established coronary heart disease reaching the
target LDL level.
