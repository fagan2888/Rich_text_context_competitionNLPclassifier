Care Workers' Job Satisfaction

Purpose: This research applies a stress and support
conceptual model to investigate the effects of back-
ground characteristics, personal and job-related stres-
sors, and workplace support on direct care workers'
(DCW) job satisfaction. Design and Methods: Re-
searchers collected survey data from 644 DCWs in
49 long-term care (LTC) organizations. The DCWs
included nurse assistants in nursing homes, resident
assistants in assisted living facilities, and home care
aides in home health agencies. We examined the
influence of components of the LTC stress and support
model on DCW job satisfaction. Initially, we ran
a multiple regression analysis by entering individual-
level DCW predictors with job satisfaction as the
outcome. Subsequently, we used hierarchical
linear modeling to examine the influence of organi-
zational factors on DCW job satisfaction after
controlling for significant individual-level DCW vari-
ables. Results: Components of the model explained
51% of the variance in DCW job satisfaction. Back-
ground characteristics of DCWs were less important
than personal stressors (e.g., depression), job-related
stressors (e.g., continuing education), and social
support (e.g., interactions with others) in predicting
job satisfaction. Results from hierarchical linear model-
ing analysis showed that nursing homes compared to
the two other types of LTC organizations had lower
average DCW job satisfaction rates, as did organi-
zations offering lower minimum hourly rates and those
reporting turnover problems. Implications: Study
findings underscore the importance of targeting both
DCW-level and organizational-level factors to increase
DCW job satisfaction.
Key Words: Aides in nursing homes, Home health
agencies, Assisted living
Aside from family members, direct care workers
(DCWs) such as nurse assistants in nursing homes,
resident assistants in assisted living facilities, and
home care aides in home health agencies provide the
majority of hands-on care for chronically impaired
older adults. These workers in the long-term care
(LTC) industry help physically and cognitively
impaired individuals with tasks such as bathing,
dressing, toileting, and feeding, thus making them the
foundation of the LTC workforce. However, turnover
of DCWs ranges from 45% to more than 100% and
costs the industry nearly $4.1 billion annually (Harris-
Kojetin, Lipson, Fielding, Kiefer, & Stone, 2004).
Turnover among DCWs stems from a variety of
factors, key among which is job dissatisfaction
(Capitman, Leutz, Bishop, & Casler, 2004; Castle,
Degenholtz, & Rosen, 2006; Institute of Medicine,
2001; National Commission on Nursing Workforce
for Long Term Care, 2005; Nursing workforce:
Recruitment, 2001; Parsons, Simmons, Penn, &
Furlough, 2003; Wiener, 2003). Given the extent of
DCW turnover, gaining a better understanding of the
factors affecting job satisfaction is critical in order to
develop and implement workplace interventions to
enhance job satisfaction. Prior research studies on
the determinants of job satisfaction among DCWs
are sparse. Furthermore, they are limited by the
general absence of a conceptual framework to guide
the research or one that is narrow in scope, a failure
to consider both DCW-level and organizational-level
factors to simultaneously address the issue of nested
data, and the lack of inclusion of DCWs from
different types of LTC settings (Castle et al., 2006).
We designed this study to address these limitations.

It was guided by the LTC stress and support model,
and we collected data from DCWs in three major
sectors of the LTC industry and from study site
liaisons on organizational issues. Furthermore, we
used hierarchical linear modeling to identify organi-
zational effects on the study outcome while control-
ling for data obtained at the individual level from
DCWs.
Conceptual Model
The study's conceptual framework was adapted
from the stress process model, which examines the
common sources of stress and its negative impact on
family caregivers with impaired older relatives living
in home- and community-based settings (Aneshensel,
Pearlin, Mullan, Zarit, & Whitlatch, 1995;
Pearlin, Mullan, Semple, & Skaff, 1990; Zarit &
Whitlatch, 1992). The sources of stress and support
in that model were later adapted for use with DCWs
in nursing homes (Cohen-Mansfield & Noelker, 2000;
Noelker, Ejaz, Menne, & Jones, 2006) and then
DCWs in assisted living facilities and home health
agencies (Ejaz & Noelker, 2006). This adapted
LTC stress and support model was developed based
on the similarities in caregiving tasks by family
members and DCWs. Both provide the majority of
hands-on care for elders either in the community or
in LTC settings and perform tasks that involve
intensive physical and emotional labor (Noelker,
2001; Whitlatch, Schur, Noelker, Ejaz, & Looman,
2001). An important adaptation of the LTC stress
and support model is the inclusion of organizational
variables because, unlike family caregivers, DCWs
are employed by organizations with differing char-
acteristics and practices.
We did not use other conceptual models in the
study because of their limitations. One study used
a conceptual framework organized around staff
demographic characteristics, job characteristics,
and work environments to predict employee job
satisfaction, job commitment, and turnover intent in
a single type of LTC setting (Karsh, Booske, &
Sainfort, 2005). Another study on factors distinguish-
ing nursing home facilities with high and low DCW
turnover used job, organizational, and environmen-
tal factors at the organizational level but did not
include any individual-level DCW characteristics
(Brannon, Zinn, Mor, & Davis, 2002). Thus, the
proposed research responded to the need for a more
inclusive conceptual framework to empirically test
how individual-level DCW characteristics and stress-
ors as well as organizational characteristics and
management issues influence job satisfaction.
Elements of the Conceptual Model
At the DCW level, variables in the model (see
Figure 1) include the background characteristics of
the DCWs (A), their personal and job-related sources
of stress (B), and workplace support (C). At the
organizational level (D), the model includes charac-
teristics of the organizations (e.g., type of LTC
setting) and management issues (e.g., high DCW
turnover). The various sources of stress and support
at both the DCW and organizational levels influence
the study outcome (E), that is, DCW job satisfaction.
DCW Individual-Level Predictors of
Job Satisfaction
Background Characteristics.--Research on the
stress process has indicated that background and
contextual features have an important bearing on
outcomes (Aneshensel et al., 1995). A large portion
of the DCW workforce is composed of low-income,
unmarried minority women with dependent children
(Yamada, 2002). Consequently, we included age,
race, and marital status in the model.
Personal Stressors.--Because DCWs are the
lowest paid workers in the health care labor force,
financial and family worries are likely to be personal
sources of stress that can carry over to the work setting
(Stone & Weiner, 2001; Tellis-Nayak & Tellis-
Nayak, 1989). In addition, because the care DCWs
give to the frail elderly is physically and emotionally
demanding, over time it is likely to negatively affect
their physical and emotional health (Mutaner et al.,
2004; Noelker & Harel, 2000; Stone & Weiner, 2001).
Job-Related Stressors.--Stressors on the job in-
clude job design features such as the frequency of
scheduling changes (e.g., coming in early, staying
late, being called to work on a day off) and lack of
permanent assignments. Scheduling changes are
likely to disrupt the practice of permanent assign-
ment to residents or clients and are indicative of
short staffing and turnover problems, which in turn
impact overall job satisfaction. Another important
component of job-related stress is inadequate on-the-
job training. Such training includes orientation to
the job, peer mentoring, and continuing education.
Other job-related stressors investigated here are poor
pay and lack of benefits such as health insurance (U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, 2003,
2004; U.S. General Accounting Office, 2001).
Support in the Workplace.--Research has pro-
vided evidence that positive support can attenuate
the negative effects of stress (Bass, Noelker, &
Rechlin, 1996), whereas negative support can exac-
erbate stress (Krause, 1995). For example, DCWs
often hear racist and ethnic remarks made about
them by clients, families, and other staff (Berdes &
Eckert, 2001; 2007; Foner, 1994; Tellis-Nayak &
Tellis-Nayak, 1989). Using the LTC stress and
support model, we investigated the effects of DCW
Vol. 48, Special Issue I, 2008 61
perceptions of workplace racism and other negative
and positive interactions on job satisfaction.
Organizational-Level Predictors of DCW
Job Satisfaction
At the organizational level, a key background
characteristic is type of LTC setting. Examining
differences by type of LTC setting is important
because settings can significantly differ in their
structure and operation (Ejaz et al., 2006). For
example, DCWs in nursing homes work in a more
institutional setting compared to home care aides,
who provide care in a client's home. Research has also
shown that staffing patterns and working conditions
in for-profit facilities place greater demands on
nursing staff (Anderson, Issel, & McDaniel, 1997).
Other organizational features have the potential to
influence worker outcomes, including the availability
of resources that are affected by reimbursement
streams (i.e., Medicare, Medicaid, and private pay).
A study by Mor, Zinn, Angelelli, Teno, and Miller
(2004) indicated that organizations serving primarily
Medicaid and minority residents have fewer resources
(e.g., lower reimbursement rates under public pro-
grams), which can negatively impact staffing levels,
rate of pay, amount of staff training, and availability
of equipment and supplies. Another key organiza-
tional characteristic is the difficulty an organization
faces because of high DCW turnover rates (Harris-
Kojetin et al., 2004). Based on these prior studies, the
LTC stress and support model also included the
following organizational-level predictors: the percent-
age of minority and nonminority clients served; the
percentage of reimbursement under Medicare, Med-
icaid, and private pay; and the difficulty the organi-
zation reports with DCWs quitting or being fired.
Methods
Research Questions
The research addressed the following questions:
1. To what extent do DCW reports of personal and
job-related stress and workplace support predict
their job satisfaction?

and management issues predict DCW job satis-

level variables?
Site Selection
We developed a database of all nursing homes,
assisted living facilities, and home health agencies in
a five-county area of northeast Ohio by obtaining
information from various sources (e.g., the state's
Department of Health, the local area agency on
aging, and the state's assisted living association). The
comprehensive list included 75 home health agencies,
143 nursing homes, and 101 assisted living facilities,
for a total of 319 agencies. Because the list of LTC
facilities was obtained from state agencies, it excluded
organizations that were not certified or licensed (e.g.,
private home health agencies). Following the crea-
tion of a database of the 319 facilities, we contacted
these organizations to determine if they met the
criteria for inclusion in the study: (a) facilities with
more than 10 DCWs and (b) facilities that employed
their own DCWs and did not use only agency staff
or outside contractors. Of the 319 agencies in the
study area, we were able to obtain information from
217 (68%). Based on the information supplied by the
217 organizations, a total of 161 (29 home health
agencies, 40 assisted living facilities, and 92 nursing
homes) met the study criteria.
We determined that, in order to effectively address
Research Question 2, we would need a minimum of
30 organizations to investigate the effects of
organizational-level variables while controlling for
DCW-level variables (Kraemer & Thiemann, 1988).
We used proportionate random sampling techniques
(Cochran, 1977) to select a larger number of sites
than the minimum number required. This sampling
strategy allowed us to randomly select 8 home care
agencies, 13 assisted living facilities, and 25 nursing
homes, for a total of 46 sites.
In view of the project's restricted time frame for
site and sample recruitment and data collection, we
assumed a 100% refusal rate to ensure that the
replacement pool contained enough sites. Thus, we
contacted a total of 90 sites (see Table 1), and 41%
of those refused to participate. Refusals included
active and passive refusals, the latter referring to
cases in which facility administrators agreed to
participate but did not follow up with the research
team. Refusal rates differed by type of LTC setting.
Almost half (49%) of the nursing homes contacted
were refusals, whereas only one third (33%) of home
care agencies were. In the end, 46 facilities partici-
pated in the study. Ultimately, we added three
additional sites to boost the overall number of
DCWs in the sample (see ``Respondent Selection'').
Comparisons between participating and nonpartici-
pating sites revealed that sites did not differ on key
variables such as type of LTC setting, number of
clients/residents served, or the number of DCWs that
they employed.
Respondent Selection
We determined that, in order to have adequate
power of .80 or greater, with an effect size of .05 and
approximately 21 predictors in the model, we would
need a minimum sample size of 615 DCWs to
address Research Question 1 (Murphy & Myors,
1998). We used proportionate random sampling tech-
niques to recruit the required number of DCWs from
the respective sites.
Because of the limited time frame for data collec-
tion and in anticipation of a high DCW refusal rate,
we contacted a total of 1,058 DCWs (see Table 1).
Of these, 39% refused to participate. We completed
a total of 644 interviews, which was more than the
minimum number of DCWs required to address
Research Question 1. Challenges encountered in
contacting and interviewing DCWs included discon-
nected and wrong phone numbers and DCWs'
failure to keep interview appointments, despite the
fact that interviewers were willing to conduct
interviews at odd hours and in any place and time
convenient to the DCW.
Data Collection Procedures.--We collected two
types of data: (a) DCW-level data based on either
in-person or telephone interviews with workers and

survey completed by the site liaison (usually a human
resources director or the administrator). In cases
where the organizational survey was incomplete,
we contacted site liaisons to complete parts of the
instrument over the phone. All 49 organizations in
the study completed the survey.
Consent Procedures.--Prior to starting the in-
terview, we obtained informed consent from DCWs.
The institutional review board of the research
organization approved the consent procedures. The
average amount of time taken to complete an
interview was 50 min (SD = 34.58), and respondents
received $20.
Measures
Outcome Variable.--Job satisfaction was an
overall measure of satisfaction with various aspects
of a DCW job. The scale was originally developed
for use with DCWs in nursing homes (Kiefer et al.,
2005). Items are scored using a 4-point Likert scale,
with higher scores indicating higher job satisfaction
levels. We assessed the psychometrics of the scale in
two steps. First, we dropped 2 of the original 18
items because of insufficient variance in responses
(i.e., the criterion for exclusion was having less than
80%Â­20% response variance on an item). Second,
we entered the remaining 16 items into a factor
analysis using principal axis factoring and Varimax
rotation. It revealed a one-factor solution. Thus, we
used all 16 items (factor loadings .58Â­.80) to develop
the scale (Cronbach's a=.94). (See the Appendix for
the scale items.)
DCW Background Characteristics.--We used
single-item measures for the three DCW background
characteristics: age, race/ethnicity (nonminority = 0;
minority = 1), and marital status (unmarried = 0;
married = 1). We considered including the number
of months that the DCW had worked at the facility;
however, we excluded it from the analyses because
of its high correlation with the outcome variable.
DCW Personal Stressors.--We used five mea-
sures to assess DCW personal stressors. One
measure of perceived financial adequacy included
six items covering whether the DCW had sufficient
money to meet regular and unexpected obligations
(Cronbach's a = .81). The second measure is an
additive index of four items assessing worries about
family while at work (Cronbach's a = .75). The
health-related personal stressors included the Center
for Epidemiologic StudiesÂ­Depression scale (CES-D;
Radloff, 1977) and two single-item measures of
perceived change in emotional health and physical
health since becoming a DCW, scored as much
worse (0), worse (1), about the same (2), better (3),
or much better (4).
DCW Job-Related Stressors.--We examined
three components of job-related stress: (a) job design
features, (b) training issues, and (c) pay and benefits.
Job design features included a measure of scheduling
changes (how often in the past 2 months the DCW
had been asked to come in early, stay late, or work
on a scheduled day off) and a measure of the
frequency with which the DCW was permanently
assigned to clients. Three single-item measures on
training assessed perceived adequacy of job orienta-
tion to the facility, perceived adequacy of continuing
education at the facility, and usefulness of having
a mentor at the time of hire. With respect to pay and
benefits, we included a one-item measure of being
fairly compensated for the job along with four single-
item measures of whether the organization provided
the DCW with sick leave, paid holidays, a retirement
or pension plan, and paid health insurance.
DCW Job-Related Support.--We included three
measures of job-related support in the analysis. We
asked DCWs whether or not certain positive and
negative reactions were elicited when the DCW
interacted with other DCWs and with residents.
Positive items focused on feelings of respect, affec-
tion, and reassurance, whereas negative items queried
about feelings of anger, frustration, and guilt. How-
ever, we did not use positive items in the analysis
because of a lack of variance. We created one additive
index of total negative interactions on the job
(regardless of with whom the negative interactions
occurred) based on how many negative interactions
were reported. In addition, DCWs reported the
frequency of hearing racial or ethnic remarks made
by residents or other staff members. We also used
these two items on the frequency of racial or ethnic
remarks by residents or other staff as independent
measures of negative support.
Organizational Variables
Background Characteristics.--We created several
descriptive organizational variables for use in the
analyses. The variables included type of LTC setting
(assisted living/home health agency = 0; nursing
home = 1); profit status (not for profit = 0; for
profit = 1); percentage of minority residents/clients
served; and percentage of resident/client services
reimbursed through (a) Medicaid, (b) Medicare, or
(c) private pay.
Organizational Issues.--Based on the literature,
we included selected measures of organizational
issues. For example, the organizational survey
included information on the extent to which the
organization faced difficulties with turnover (4-point
64 The Gerontologist
scale ranging from no difficulty to a great deal of
difficulty) because of DCWs quitting or being fired,
and the minimum starting hourly rate of pay for
DCWs.
Data Analyses
Data analysis required several phases. In the first
phase, we used a correlation matrix of all DCW
independent variables in the model and the de-
pendent variable to check for multicollinearity.
Although an intercorrelation of .80 or higher is an
example of a cutoff value at which to begin
excluding predictors as being too similar (Stevens,
2002, p. 93), given the large number of predictors
being considered, we used a more conservative cutoff
of .50 for deciding to keep or exclude variables. The
correlation of the outcome with the predictors
retained in the analyses are included in Table 2.
In the second phase, we analyzed Research
Question 1 by using a hierarchical multiple linear
regression to determine the extent to which DCW
reports of personal stressors, job-related stressors,
and workplace support predicted DCW job satisfac-
tion. We entered DCW predictor variables in four
steps based on components of the LTC stress and
support model: (a) background characteristics, (b)
personal stressors, (c) job-related stressors, and (d)
job-related support variables.
In the third phase, we addressed Research
Question 2. In this phase, we used a two-level
hierarchical linear model (HLM) to determine the
extent to which organizational factors could predict
DCW job satisfaction after we controlled for the
effects of individual-level DCW predictors. We
considered HLM the most appropriate statistical
technique to use because study data were nested, in
that a number of DCWs from each study site
participated in the interviews.
We entered the significant predictor variables that
we had identified earlier (Research Question 1) in
Level 1 (individual- or DCW-level data) of the HLM
analyses. In Level 2 (organizational-level data), we
entered key organizational characteristics and man-
agement issues in the HLM analyses. We selected
organizational variables based on their importance
in the literature and used an iterative process to
select only those that emerged as consistently signifi-
cant. Due to the relatively small number of organ-
izations (49), we entered no more than four
organizational characteristics and management issues
(using a ratio of 1 variable to 10 cases/organizations)
at any one time in Level 2 of the HLM analyses.
Results
Background and Context
Table 3 shows the DCW-level variables, scoring,
ranges, means, and standard deviations. Approxi-
mately 6 out of 10 DCWs were minority, slightly
more than one third were married, and the average
age was 39 years. Eighty percent of all DCWs were
state-test nursing assistants, indicating that even
some home care aides and resident assistants had
completed nurse assistant training. The majority of
DCWs worked full time (77%), and the remaining
23% reported their work status as part time or ``as
needed.'' At the time of the interview, the mean
length of time that DCWs had been with their
current employers was 56 months (range = 0Â­84
months), or almost 5 years.
Worries about family while at work and partic-
ularly financial problems were widely reported by
the DCWs. The average score for perceived job-
related emotional health change since becoming
a DCW was higher (2.26) than the mean score for
physical health changes (1.98). Conversely, DCWs
had relatively high CES-D scores: 26% scored at
16 or above, which is indicative of clinical levels of
depressive symptoms.
On average, DCWs had been asked to make
changes to their work schedule five times within the

2 months prior to their interview. Also, DCWs
tended to perceive their job orientation and continu-
ing education as fairly useful. Almost 75% of DCWs
received paid holidays off, but only 49% received
fully paid health insurance. On average, a DCW
experienced one or two negative interactions with
other staff or residents out of a possible three
negative interactions. DCWs reported hearing racial/
ethnic remarks more frequently from residents than
from other staff.
Regarding organizational characteristics, Table 4
includes descriptive data on the three types of facili-
ties. There was good representation of for-profit and
nonprofit organizations (28 and 21, respectively).
The organizations served, on average, 21% minority
clients, although they ranged from serving no
minority clients/residents to more than 90% minor-
ity clients/residents. Reimbursement sources also
varied, with the average organization receiving about
40% of its reimbursement from Medicaid.
DCW Individual-Level Predictors of
Job Satisfaction
We entered 21 predictors in the hierarchical
multiple linear regression (Research Question 1).
The final model identified 12 significant predictors
of DCW job satisfaction with an adjusted R2 of .51
(p , .001). We examined the tolerance and variance
inflation factor (VIF) that focus on multicollinearity
among the predictors and found that they were
within acceptable limits (see Table 5). Background
characteristics of DCWs were entered first and,
although significant, they contributed little to the
final outcome. The largest changes occurred with
the inclusion of personal stressors (R2 change = .25,
p .001), the job-related stressors ( R2 change =
.20, p .001), and workplace support variables
(R2 change = .05, p .001). Thus, each step of the
hierarchical regression analysis resulted in significant
changes in the R2 value.
For the final model, in terms of background
characteristics that were entered first, only race of
the DCW predicted DCW job satisfaction, with
nonminorities reporting higher levels of job satisfac-
tion. Among the personal stressors that were entered
next, three variables were significant predictors of
DCW job satisfaction: physical health change since
becoming a DCW, emotional health change, and
CES-D score. DCWs who reported better physical
and emotional health since working as a DCW and
those who had lower depression scores were more
likely to have higher job satisfaction.

66 The Gerontologist
Among the job-related stressors that were entered
next, we identified significant predictors in relation
to scheduling changes, training issues, and pay and
benefits. Specifically, DCWs who perceived they had
better on-the-job training in terms of the usefulness
of continuing education and job orientation had
higher job satisfaction. In terms of pay and benefits,
DCWs who reported being fairly compensated for
their job, having a retirement/pension plan, and
having paid health insurance had higher job
satisfaction.
With respect to workplace support variables that
were entered last, racism and negative interactions
were significant predictors of DCW job satisfaction.
When DCWs reported hearing fewer racial or ethnic
remarks from other staff and experienced fewer
negative interactions at work, their job satisfaction
was higher.
Organizational-Level Variables
We included significant DCW-level predictors that
we identified in Phase 1 in Level 1 of the two-level
HLM model. The y-intercept (b0j
) estimated from
the Level 1 model represents the adjusted average job
satisfaction scores of the jth LTC facility. Because
the Level 1 predictors were group mean centered, the
adjusted average represented the job satisfaction
score for a typical DCW in a specific facility. We
treated this index of job satisfaction as the outcome
variable in Level 2 of the HLM analysis.
In Level 1 of the HLM analyses, all of the
individual-level predictors identified in the multiple
regression, except for race of DCW, emerged as
significant predictors of the adjusted average job
satisfaction level in a facility. With respect to
organizational factors identified in Level 2 of the
HLM analyses, the following were significant: type
of LTC facility (i.e., nursing home vs home health
agency and assisted living facility), difficulty with
turnover of DCWs, and minimum hourly rate of pay
for DCWs (see Table 6). Nursing homes had lower
adjusted average job satisfaction scores compared to
home health agencies and assisted living facilities.
Greater difficulty with DCWs quitting or being fired
had a negative relationship, whereas higher rates of
starting wages had a positive relationship with the
LTC facility's adjusted average DCW job satisfac-
tion score. The percentage of minority clients served
was not a significant predictor of the adjusted
average DCW job satisfaction score.
Discussion
TheLTCstress andsupport model,testedwithdata
from both DCWs and organizations, proved to be
a useful tool to explain DCW job satisfaction. Specific
components of the model had more explanatory
power than others. For example, Step 1 of the multiple
regression analysis identified only one background
characteristic (i.e., nonminority race) as a significant
predictor of DCW job satisfaction. However, because
race was not significant in the HLM analyses when we
entered the organizational-level variables, it suggests
that race and other DCW background characteristics
were not as important in predicting job satisfaction as
were other variables. In fact, the most powerful
predictors of DCW-level job dissatisfaction were the
personal and job-related stressors.
Among the personal stressors, physical and
emotional health changes since working as a DCW
and depression were significant. From a practice
perspective, LTC organizations need to be sensitive
to perceived changes in the health of DCWs.
Offering workplace health screening, employee
assistance, and health promotion programs may be
efficacious in addressing DCWs' personal stress in
order to enhance their job satisfaction.
In addition to personal stressors, a variety of job-
related stressors were significant predictors of job
dissatisfaction. They fell into the following catego-
ries: issues related to scheduling changes, training,
and pay and benefits. Organizations can alleviate
some job-related stress by offering better job
orientation and continuing education programs. In
fact, DCW-related findings from our study indicate
that DCWs want better training in specific content
areas and in the methods for providing training
(Menne, Ejaz, Noelker, & Jones, 2007).
Although LTC organizations are not always
amenable to offering better pay and benefits, it is
clear that feeling fairly compensated for the job and

receiving key benefits are significantly related to
DCW job satisfaction. Of all of the benefits included
in our study, two were significant: health insurance
and a retirement/pension plan. Other benefits such
as paid holidays and paid sick leave did not emerge
as significant. Because studies have suggested that
job satisfaction is related to turnover (Castle et al.,
2006), further research needs to be conducted
examining the business case for offering better wages
and benefits in relation to the cost of turnover.
In addition to addressing sources of job-related
stress, organizations can also focus on improving
communication patterns and relationships in the
workplace. Our findings suggest that perceptions of
racism by other staff and negative interactions with
staff and residents are likely to generate greater job
dissatisfaction. With respect to racism, our findings
support those of other studies in that DCWs were
more likely to condone racist remarks from residents
and clients because they believed that the elders were
too impaired to be maliciously racist (Berdes &
Eckert, 2001). Hence, racism from staff was a signif-
icant predictor of job satisfaction but racism from
residents was not, even though 70% of the DCWs in
our sample had heard residents and clients make
racist remarks. Thus, having sensitivity training on
racial and cultural differences; promoting effective
communication between residents, families, and staff
via newsletters, brochures, and discussion groups;
and having a no-tolerance policy on discrimination
are likely to enhance workplace support.
In terms of differences between organizations, it is
interesting to find that nursing homes had lower

Sample size decreased from 644 because of list-wise deletion. Both tolerance levels and VIF examine whether there is a strong
linear relationship between a predictor and the remaining predictors in a model. They do not examine the relationship of the
predictors with the outcome variable. Tolerance is the reciprocal of VIF (i.e., tolerance = 1 / VIF). VIF values that exceed 10 may
be a cause for concern with regard to multicollinearity (Stevens, 2002, p. 92). The rule of thumb with respect to tolerance is to
generally stay above .10 (10% unique variance) because .10 = 1/10 (with 10 being the cutoff value for VIF).

DCW job satisfaction levels compared to home health
agencies and assisted living facilities. Additionally,
organizations providing a higher minimum starting
rate of pay for DCWs and those not struggling with
turnover issues were more likely to have higher levels
of DCW job satisfaction. In a low-income population
of working women, the issue of pay is likely to be
linked to the alarming rates of DCW turnover in the
industry (Harris-Kojetin et al., 2004; U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services, 2003, 2004; U.S.
General Accounting Office, 2001).
The limitations of this study include the follow-
ing: (a) the inclusion of sites from a restricted
geographical area (five-county area in Ohio), (b) the
inability to obtain a random sample of DCWs due to
the challenges involved in contacting and completing
interviews with DCWs who volunteered to partici-
pate, and (c) the lack of longitudinal data to examine
cause and effect between variables in the model.
Thus, the findings from this study need to be viewed
with caution, particularly those regarding the differ-
ences between nursing homes and other LTC
organizations. We could not conduct a more in-
depth examination of the differences between the
three types of LTC settings in our sample because
there were fewer home health agencies and assisted
living facilities than nursing homes due to the
proportionate sampling techniques used in the study.
To examine the effect of organizational variables
while controlling for DCW individual-level factors
by type of LTC setting, HLM would require
a minimum of 30 organizations for each of the three
types of settings. Thus, future studies using larger
samples of organizations are required to effectively
address differences by type of setting.
Similarly, although DCWs in Ohio are likely to
have characteristics similar to other samples of
DCWs in terms of gender and income level, the
study questions and the conceptual model need to be
tested with larger, more generalizable samples.
One of the major strengths of the study lies in the
use of a conceptual model that supported using two
levels of data (i.e., DCW and organizational levels)
to predict job satisfaction. Other strengths include
the preliminary examination of three types of LTC
settings and the large sample of 644 DCWs who
completed in-depth interviews. Future research with
larger, more representative samples and a longitudi-
nal design can lead to further refinements in the LTC
stress and support model for examining the relation-
ship between job satisfaction and actual turnover
among DCWs.
