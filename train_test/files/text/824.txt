REGIONAL
VARIATION IN
HEALTH INSURANCE
COVERAGE
by Michael A. Morrisey and Gail A. Jensen
Prologue: Health care costs grew by 9.7 percent in 1987', topping
$500 million in overall spending. Insurance premiums continue to
rise (12 percent between 1987 and 1988). In an attempt to keep ris-
ing health costs under control, employers and insurance companies
have instituted mechanisms such as managed care, second surgical
opinions, and incentives to use generic drugs. Yet, the data show
that these efforts have been anything but uniform across the coun-
try. Indeed, in many areas, benefits and costs have expanded. "For
all the rhetoric we've heard, .. .the bulk [ofemployers] are sitting
on their hands," economist Michael Morrisey said. In this paper,
Morrisey and fellow economist GailJensen examine private insur-
ance coverage by region, trying to glean some insight into why use of
health services varies drastically across the United States. Ex-
plained Morrisey, "It strikes us that... some ofthe variation in
utilization across regions can be explained by differences in insur-
ance coverage." While the authors acknowledge that otherfactors
certainly play a role in explaining regional variations in health ser-
vices utilization, they raise this question ofinsurance coverage to en-
couragefurther work in this area, especially in developing reliable
data sets. Morrisey is a professor in the Department ofHealth Care
Organization at the University ofAlabama School ofPublic
Health, which hejoined in 1985. He previously worked at the
American Hospital Association's Hospital Research and Educa-
tional Trust in Chicago as a senior economist and earned a doctor-
ate in economics from the University ofWashington. Jensen, who
received a doctorate in economics from the University ofMinne-
sota, was affiliated with the University ofIllinois at Chicago at the
time this article was written. She has recently assumed a position as
associate professor at Wayne State University's Institute ofGer-
ontology. Jensen has also worked for the Hospital Research and
Educational Trust.

92 HEALTH AFFAIRS | Fall 1989
There is considerable variation in the use of health services across
regions of the United States. To explain this variation, researchers
have examined differences in sex, race, and age structure among
various regions as well as differences in income, health status, and the
availability of health resources.1 Yet, these factors have been unable to
explain much of the variation in hospital admission rates, length-of-stay,
or physician visits. Related studies of small area variations show that use
of services sometimes varies more by diagnosis than by region. These
studies suggest that systematic differences in physician practice styles may
partially explain the puzzle of regional variation. We suggest that varia-
tion in health insurance coverage offered by employers in different
regions of the country may partially explain the regional variation in use
of services.
The link between health insurance benefits and the use of health
services is well established. The RAND Health Insurance Experiment
found that full coverage (that is, no out-of-pocket payments) for a
uniformly wide range of health services resulted in annual health care
expenditures that averaged $177 higher than the expenditures for those
who paid half of the initial charges out-of-pocket.2 Hospital admission
rates were lower, and physician visits were fewer. The differences in use
rates increased as the amount of consumer out-of-pocket liability in-
creased. Further, health insurers, health maintenance organization
(HMO) advocates, and advocates of more price competition in health
care argue that changes in benefit offerings will further change use
patterns and reduce health care expenditures.
Somewhat surprisingly, little effort has been devoted to identifying the
effects of insurance coverage on the observed variations in regional
utilization. This has resulted in part from a lack of reliable insurance data
and data to link utilization with detailed information on coverage. This
article constitutes a first step toward such an analysis. We summarize the
extent of regional variation in health services utilization and then exam-
ine these differences in light of rather remarkable differences in the
extent of employer-sponsored health insurance coverage. To be sure,
other factors play major roles in explaining regional variation, yet our
results suggest that differences in the pattern of private insurance cover-
age are worthy of consideration as well.

It is readily apparent that the use of hospital-related services is greatest in
the Northeast. Discharges, length-of-stay, total days, and emergency
room/outpatient department use are all higher here than elsewhere.
Physician visits are also frequent in the Northeast. The West, in contrast,
has exceedingly low inpatient utilization but relatively high ambulatory
use. The South and Midwest generally are closer to the national averages
for all types of utilization, although inpatient use is higher in the South.
Insurance Coverage
Data on insurance coverage are drawn primarily from the Bureau of
Labor Statistics (BLS) Employee Benefits Surveys of 1981 and 1985. The
surveys provide estimates on the health benefits held by some 20.5
million full-time, permanent employees who worked in 43,000 establish-
ments. As such, the surveys are representative of private U.S. establish-
ments (excluding those in Alaska and Hawaii) that employ at least 50,
100, or 250 workers, depending on the industry. Small firms were ex-
cluded from the sample design. In general, these firms are less likely to
offer coverage and less likely to offer broad coverage. A sample of 1,505
and 1,509 establishments was surveyed by the BLS in 1981 and 1985,
respectively; 86 and 88 percent of firms responded.3 Also reported are

regional data from the 1986 Health Interview Survey (HIS) on the
uninsured and those covered by private plans and Medicaid, and regional
data from the 1977 National Medical Care Expenditure Survey on those
with insurance covering physician office visits. Unfortunately, more
recent data on physician visit coverage are not readily available.
We focus first on the Northeast and elaborate on the underlying issues.
We then relate the coverage to the pattern of utilization. The data for the
other regions are discussed more briefly.
The Northeast. It is apparent from Exhibit 2 that, among persons
under age sixty-five, the Northeast has the smallest percentage of unin-
sured under age sixty-five (10.7 percent) and the highest proportion of
privately insured (81.6 percent). Further, the vast majority of the cover-
age is fee-for-service and tends to include both basic and major medical
components. As a consequence, those insured face little in the way of out-
of-pocket payments for covered services.
Exhibit 3 summarizes regional patterns of private coverage and the
extent of cost sharing in some detail. Compared with other regions,
employers in the Northeast generally have made the fewest changes in
health benefits between 1981 and 1985. Health insurance for northeast-
erners in 1985 could best be characterized as comprehensive first-dollar
coverage for hospital care with the fewest incentives to seek alternative,
less-expensive outpatient care. In that year, as in 1981, more than four out
of five insured employees had fee-for-service insurance with comprehen-
sive hospital coverage (neither a deductible nor coinsurance applied for

hospital care). This was a greater proportion than in any other region.
This finding is perhaps not so surprising given that Blue Cross/Blue
Shield (BC/BS) plans have such a large market share in this area of the
country (40.2 percent of employees in 1985). BC/BS plans are primarily
combined basic/major medical plans rather than freestanding major
medical plans.4 The difference is that in combined plans, basic coverage

provides an initial extra layer of coverage in the event of hospitalization.
Basic benefits for hospital care typically do not require a deductible or
coinsurance. Rather, all hospitalization expenses are covered for a specific
number of days per year (usually 120 or 365); once the limit is reached,
coverage is picked up under the major medical portion of the plan and its
cost-sharing provisions then apply. Unlike the Blues, commercial and
self-insured plans tend to be freestanding major medical plans in which
hospital expenses, and most other categories of care, are subject to the
same deductible and coinsurance provisions.
Commercial insurance and HMOs both have small market shares in
the Northeast (20.4 percent and 5.9 percent, respectively, measured in
terms of employees covered). However, almost 30 percent of employees
could have joined an HMO had they wished to do so. Self-insurance,
while growing steadily over the period, is also less common in the
Northeast than elsewhere (with only a 33.5 percent market share).
Making HMOs available and self-insuring the fee-for-service plan are
steps usually adopted by employers to cut health benefit costs. However,
Blue Cross's large market share apparently has allowed them to negotiate
substantial discounts with hospitals, particularly in the Northeast. In
1977, the last year data were collected, the Blues' discount from hospital
charges averaged 11.6 percent in the Northeast. This was more than three
times the discount garnered in any other region.5 Further, with the sole
exception of Connecticut, states in this region do not tax BC/BS premi-
ums but do tax commercial premiums, usually at a rate of 2 percent.6 The
Blues' favored tax status gives them an added edge over commercial
competitors and weakens the advantages of self-insurance. (Self-insuring
exempts the firm's plan from premium taxation as well as compliance
with state insurance regulations and mandated benefits as a result of the
Employment Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, of 1974.) In
short, hospital discounts and favorable premium tax treatment of the
Blues in the Northeast likely have allowed them to bid successfully
against the promised savings of HMOs and the tax and state-mandated
benefits exemptions of self-insurance.
The incidence of premium sharing for medical insurance coverage in
the Northeast mirrors national trends. In 1985, approximately 35 percent
and 52 percent of employees faced individual or family coverage pre-
mium sharing, respectively. Differences in the time trends for individual
and family coverage premium sharing are startling, however. Between
1981 and 1985, nearly 20 percent more employees in the Northeast faced
individual premium sharing; by 1985 the average employee contribution
(among those required to contribute) was almost eleven dollars per
month, approximately 20 percent of the full premium cost. Family

VARIATION IN COVERAGE 97
coverage required an average monthly contribution of twenty-nine dol-
lars in 1985, also approximately 20 percent of the full premium. However,
there has been almost no increase in the percentage of employees facing
family plan premium sharing for medical insurance since 1981 in the
Northeast.
It is not at all apparent that increased employee premium sharing
controls employee compensation costs effectively. Clearly, it cuts health
benefit costs. However, if firms are in reasonably competitive labor
markets, other forms of compensation (wages or other benefits) must be
increased when premium sharing is introduced, or the better employees
in each job grade will seek employment elsewhere. To the extent that
payroll-based employer taxes (such as FICA and unemployment insur-
ance premiums) must then be paid on the increased wage payments, the
net effect may actually be an increase in employer labor costs. Premium
sharing simply forces employees to pay for insurance with before-tax
rather than after-tax dollars; hence, it is unlikely to be a cheaper method
of providing net compensation.
More importantly, within the health plan, shifting premium costs fails
to change the underlying incentives to use health services. To be effec-
tive, the premium sharing must be linked to the availability of multiple
plans--and the contributions tailored to provide an incentive for enroll-
ment in the less expensive plans. The limited BLS data, nationally and in
the Northeast, suggest that employers are not offering multiple-plan
coverage as rapidly as they are increasing the use of premium sharing. We
speculate that even fewer are carefully structuring the premium sharing
across plans.
As the RAND experiment demonstrated, coinsurance and deductibles
show greater promise of reducing the use of health services. By reducing
the use of marginal physician visits and hospital admissions, they gener-
ate claims savings that reduce the employer's compensation bill. Employ-
ers in the Northeast have increased major medical deductibles for both
individuals and families; however, average levels in this region are still
among the lowest in the country. The increases were 25.8 percent and
35.2 percent, respectively, over 1981-1985. The Consumer Price Index
(CPI, all items) increased by 18.3 percent, and the medical care compo-
nent of the CPI increased by 36.9 percent over the same period. Thus,
employers' increased deductibles, at best, reflect "running in place." The
level of coinsurance above the deductible underscores this lack of action.
The vast majority of employees nationwide continue to face an 80/20
coinsurance rule, a formula that has remained constant for many years.
Ironically, some employees have actually moved toward lower levels of
coinsurance--particularly in the Northeast. In 1985, 9.3 percent of em-

98 HEALTH AFFAIRS | Fall 1989
ployees paid less than 20 percent of an additional dollar of covered claims
expense. This was a 69 percent increase over 1981. At most, about half of
this increase can be attributed to the growth in HMO enrollment over the
period; HMOs rarely stipulate coinsurance. The remainder is due to the
restructuring of some northeastern fee-for-service plans to reduce copay-
ments.
Further, employers have added many new benefits over the period,
including extended care and home health coverage (both up by 20
percent over 1981 levels) and alcoholism treatment coverage (up by 71
percent). The prevalence of stop-loss coverage, which caps enrollees'
maximum out-of-pocket payments, was up by 33 percent. While there are
no definitive studies, there is evidence that on net these coverages
increase premiums.7 This suggests that the newly covered services have
not been major substitutes for hospital or physician services.
Finally, the region has tended to lag behind the rest of the country in its
use of special cost-control devices. Among fee-for-service enrollees, the
Northeast has the lowest percentage enrolled in plans with a separate
deductible for hospitalization (41 percent). It also has the lowest percent-
age of persons in plans containing incentives to use generic drugs (1.4
percent) or to use outpatient surgery (14.7 percent). Hospice care also is
least often covered in this region (20 percent). The two exceptions to this
pattern are more frequent coverage of second surgical opinions in the
Northeast (60.6 percent of enrollees had such coverage in 1985) and a
greater frequency of provisions disallowing nonemergency hospital ad-
missions on a weekend (8.1 percent). While it would be desirable to
consider other utilization review mechanisms, by 1984, only 5 percent of
conventional insurance plans, nationally, had preadmission certification.8
Thus, the Northeast has relatively few persons without some form of
insurance. Private hospital insurance tends to be generous, and deduct-
ibles and coinsurance features are among the lowest in the country. This
would lead a proponent of the insurance/utilization link to expect high
hospital utilization in the Northeast--a fact borne out in Exhibit 1.
Ambulatory coverage is higher in the Northeast than in the South and
lower than in the West, suggesting that ambulatory use here should be
between the extremes of these regions as well. Exhibit 1 confirms this
theory. The link between insurance and ambulatory use also implies that
the Northeast's physician visit rate should be below the Midwest's and
much closer to the South's; however, it is not. This may be attributable to
income and other factors; out-of-date physician visit coverage data; or
the relative absence of basic coverage (with its low front-end cost sharing)
in the Midwest compared to the Northeast, which outweighs the physi-
cian visit coverage, resulting in lower ambulatory use in the Midwest.

VARIATION IN COVERAGE 99
The West In striking contrast to the Northeast, the West has one of
the highest percentages of nonelderly without insurance (Exhibit 2).
Further, the West is well known for high enrollment in HMOs (17
percent). Another striking feature of this region is the large market share
of self-insurance (45.4 percent of employees). Unlike the Northeast,
coverage through the Blues is rare (only 9.4 percent), and fee-for-service
coverage, regardless of vendor, tends toward the "major medical only"
variety. This suggests that more western fee-for-service enrollees face
front-end cost sharing for hospital care, relative to their northeastern
counterparts. In the West, 58 percent of fee-for-service enrollees had free-
standing major medical coverage in 1985, compared to 16.7 percent in the
Northeast. Such coverage, by design, entails front-end cost sharing for
hospital care. Further, among western fee-for-service subscribers with
basic coverage, 18.3 percent had a separate deductible for a hospital stay
in 1985, compared with only 8.7 percent among northeasterners. Fee-for-
service cost sharing for hospital care is clearly the norm in the West rather
than the exception it is in the Northeast.
Major medical deductibles have increased more in the West than in
any other region (Exhibit 3). The percentage of western employees facing
premium sharing is about the same as that nationally; however, the size of
the workers. premium contribution (roughly 30 percent of either individ-
ual or family coverage) is substantially higher here than elsewhere.
Limits on subscribers' out-of-pocket payments and the presence of
special coverage, such as for chemical dependency treatment, extended
care, home health care, hospice care, and physical exams, are all more
common in the West than in other regions. This may result from the high
HMO enrollment, with its broad coverage. Also, competition with
HMOs may have spurred some fee-for-service plans to expand their
conventional coverage.
Lower hospital use in the West typically has been attributed to its large
HMO enrollment, as well; however, there is growing evidence to doubt
that view. Gail Wilensky and Louis Rossiter concluded that much of the
difference appears attributable to favorable selection into HMOs on the
part of nonhospital users.9 If they are correct, to what, then, does one
attribute the lower hospitalization and higher ambulatory utilization in
the West? Our data may provide a partial explanation. Relatively fewer
persons have insurance coverage, and there is extensive use of cost
sharing. Taken together with the most extensive insurance coverage of
ambulatory services found in any region, the expected pattern of utiliza-
tion is the one we observe.
This explanation, however, may go too far in ignoring the role HMOs
may play in reducing hospitalization. Will Manning and colleagues found

evidence that a large, long-established, well-run HMO (Group Health of
Puget Sound) did have lower utilization experience for a randomly
assigned population.10 Since the majority of large, long-established, and
well-run HMOs are found in the West, one cannot ignore their influence.
The South. As in the West, the South has a large proportion of persons
without insurance (19.2 percent). Similar to the Northeast, private cover-
age is almost exclusively fee-for-service. HMO coverage is growing fastest
in the South, however. Southerners are also most likely to be covered by a
self-insured plan. Further, employers in the South appear to rely heavily
on traditional cost containment tools. However, since they tend to use
combined basic and major medical coverage much more than do employ-
ers in the West, their fee-for-service incentives to control hospital use are
not as strong (Exhibit 2).
Nonetheless, cost sharing is extensive. Major medical deductibles are
the highest in the South and have grown more rapidly here than
anywhere except in the West. Also, among those with two-part basic/
major medical plans in 1985, close to one-quarter (more than in any other
region) face a separate deductible for hospitalization.
Restrictions on nonemergency hospital admissions are most common
here (10.6 percent of enrollees), as are incentive provisions for outpatient
surgery (32.6 percent of enrollees). Special coverage options, including
alcoholism treatment, drug abuse treatment, extended care, home health
care, hearing care, and physical exams, were least frequently provided in
the South in both 1981 and 1985.
The high proportion of uninsured and the extensive use of cost
containment mechanisms suggest low hospital use. This must be bal-
anced, however, by the prevalence of combined basic/major medical
coverage and, perhaps, the absence of long-established HMOs. Thus, it is
not surprising that the South's hospital use patterns lie between those of
the Northeast and the West (Exhibit 1). Because of high cost sharing on
outpatient as well as inpatient services and the relative absence of cover-
age for physician visits, the South's outpatient utilization should be and is
the lowest of any region.
The Midwest. The Midwest is similar to the Northeast in that the
proportion of persons under age sixty-five lacking hospital insurance is
low (10.9 percent). The Northeast and Midwest also have the lowest
deductibles for major medical expenses. If anything, the Midwest pro-
vides more coverage than the Northeast (Exhibit 3).
The major difference between the two regions appears to be the use of
combined basic/major medical coverage. While both exceed the national
average, only 64.3 percent of private enrollees have such coverage in the
Midwest, compared to 78.4 percent in the Northeast. From this, one

could expect inpatient utilization patterns in the Midwest to be similar to,
albeit somewhat lower than, those in the Northeast and higher than
those in the West. In addition, since the Midwest and Northeast provide
less ambulatory coverage than the West, one would expect lower physi-
cian visit rates in these regions than in the West. Finally, since ambulatory
coverage appears better in these regions than in the South, adjusted
physician visits per capita should be higher in these regions than in the
South. All three presumptions hold true (Exhibit 1).
The fly in this regional analysis is the ambulatory coverage and use
patterns between the Northeast and the Midwest. On the basis of the
(admittedly old) physician coverage variable, one would expect much
greater outpatient use in the Midwest relative to the Northeast. However,
such is clearly not the case. As we noted above, the most favorable
interpretation for the insurance hypothesis is that the less frequent use of
basic coverage (with its absence of front-end cost sharing) more than
offsets the lack of physician coverage in the Northeast. The least favor-
able interpretation is that the observation stands in refutation of the
insurance/utilization link.
Insights For Policymakers
The purpose of this article is to identify differences in private insurance
coverage by region and to speculate on the extent to which these
differences may help explain regional differences in use of health services.
It is clear from these data that the type of coverage and the extent of cost
sharing varies remarkably across regions. In general, the pattern of
insurance coverage is consistent with our speculation concerning differ-
ences in service. This is particularly true for inpatient use. The data
suggest that places with less complete coverage and more cost sharing for
inpatient care have lower hospital utilization. Places with greater incen-
tives for ambulatory use often, but not always, have higher ambulatory
visits per capita.
Our exercise, however, is only suggestive. We have but four regional
observations--and a host of insurance features. As any good number
cruncher knows, one can explain everything--and nothing--with more
independent variables than observations. We do hope that the apparent
association in these comparisons will lead to serious efforts to sort out the
intricacies and interactions of health insurance features--and other
factors--on the regional (and small area) variations in use of services. A
particularly important aspect of such an investigation is the role that local
utilization patterns themselves may have on the actual insurance benefits
offered in the area.

Nonetheless, the data suggest that policymakers must not go too far in
incorporating regional differences into health policy decisions. The dif-
ferences in regional utilization may be, in part, a function of conscious
decisions made by employers and employees. Further, these data suggest
that attempts to temper physician practice patterns must not ignore the
underlying incentives faced by patients. Even patients with employer-
sponsored coverage face some substantial differences in the range of
covered benefits and the extent of cost sharing.
Finally, the numbers offer some insight into Uwe Reinhardt's question
of why employer actions to control health benefits have not paid off.11
Apparently, employers have not done much. The data indicate that
benefits have expanded in most respects--at least through the mid-
1980s. Deductibles have increased but have only kept pace with medical
care cost increases. There have been few actual changes that provide new
incentives for employees to control their own use of services.
All is not as bleak as it appears, however. The suggestive evidence
reported here hints that insurance incentives can affect use of services.
The RAND study clearly shows cost savings associated with specific cost
sharing features.12 The recent work of Jack Zwanziger and Glenn Melnick
suggests that selective contracting can reduce the rates of increase in
health care costs.13 Finally, the work Paul Feldstein and colleagues have
done on utilization review suggests that at least some such mechanisms
may be effective in reducing health care costs.14
However, U.S. labor markets are competitive, and real wages will
increase as an aging population and limited immigration shrink the work
force. Any changes employers make to control the cost of health benefits
not only must save insurance claims costs, but must save enough that
workers can be compensated for the insurance loss with other benefits or
higher after-tax wages.
