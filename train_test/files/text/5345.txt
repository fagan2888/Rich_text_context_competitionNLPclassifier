Abstract
Objective: To study the relationship between tumour angiogenesis and expression of cyclo-
oxygenase (COX)-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A in human renal cell carcinoma.
Methods: Archival samples of primary human renal cell carcinoma tissue and surrounding normal
renal tissue (control samples) obtained from patients diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma were
analysed for COX-2 and VEGF-A expression by immunohistochemistry using specific monoclonal
antibodies. Tumour microvasculature was examined using factor VIII-related antigen antibody
staining.
Results: A total of 33 renal cell carcinoma and 12 control renal tissue specimens were included.
COX-2 and VEGF-A genes were overexpressed in tumour specimens compared with normal
epithelia. A significant correlation was found between COX-2 and VEGF-A expression. Microvessel
density was found to be increased in tumour tissues that expressed COX-2 and VEGF-A.
Conclusion: Microvessel density was increased in tumour tissues that expressed COX-2 and
VEGF-A, suggesting that COX-2 and VEGF-A are related to tumour angiogenesis in human renal cell
carcinoma.

Introduction
Renal cell carcinoma is one of the most
common urological malignancies world-
wide, with an incidence among cases of
urinary tumour ranking second only to
bladder cancer in China.1 The pathogenesis,
underlying mechanisms, and prognosis of
renal cell carcinoma remain poorly under-
stood, and current measures for its preven-
tion and treatment require further
investigation to develop a greater under-
standing of this disease.
The cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 gene, offi-
cially known as prostaglandin-endoperoxide
synthase 2 (prostaglandin G/H synthase and
cyclo-oxygenase; PTGS2), encodes an indu-
cible enzyme, typically with low or no
expression in normal tissues, but high
expression in pathological tissues. Previous
studies have shown that COX-2 participates
in tumour development and progression by
promoting cell proliferation, inhibiting cell
apoptosis, and promoting tumour angiogen-
esis.2,3 COX-2 expression is also shown to be
high in gastrointestinal and urinary cancer
tissues, and COX-2 has been shown to
induce tumour angiogenesis, and promote
tumour invasion and metastasis.4­8
Information regarding the role of COX-2
in the development of renal cell carcinoma,
however, is limited.
In the present study, tumour angiogenesis
and expression of COX-2 and vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A in
renal cell carcinoma were investigated
using immunohistochemical methods. The
role of COX-2 and VEGF-A in tumour
angiogenesis, and the related mechanisms,
were discussed.
Patients and methods
Study population and archived tissue
Paraffin-wax embedded specimens of renal
cell carcinoma tissue were randomly selected
from those collected and archived at The
Union Hospital of Fujian Medical
University, Fuzhou, China between
January 2006 and December 2010.
Following initial dissection, tissue samples
had been fixed overnight in paraformalde-
hyde then processed using standard paraffin-
wax embedding methods. All specimens
were reconfirmed by a pathologist. Tissue
samples were classified using the World
Health Organization (WHO) pathological
grading system9 and Robson pathological
staging system.10 Normal renal paraffin-wax
block tissue specimens were also selected
from archives, obtained from the healthy
tissue surrounding renal cell carcinoma
tissue in patients diagnosed with renal cell
carcinoma. These were pathologically con-
firmed and used as controls. There were no
inclusion or exclusion criteria. The study
was approved by The Union Hospital of
Fujian Medical University ethical review
committee and patients provided written or
verbal informed consent for their samples to
be included in the study.
Immunohistochemical detection of COX-2
and VEGF-A expression
Rabbit antihuman COX-2 monoclonal pri-
mary antibody, mouse antihuman VEGF-A
monoclonal primary antibody, and rabbit
antihuman factor VIII-related antigen pri-
mary antibody were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA,
Yang et al. 111
USA). Streptavidin­biotin­peroxidase com-
plex kit and benzidine chromogenic kit were
purchased from Fuzhou Maixin Bio-tech
(Fujian, China).
Archived paraffin block tissue specimens
were cut into 5 mm-thick sections. Heat
induced epitope retrieval was performed
prior to immunohistochemical staining by
deparaffinizing the sections with two
changes of xylene for 5 min each, then
rehydrating with two changes each of
100% ethanol (3 min each), 95% ethanol
and 80% ethanol (1 min each), with a final
rinse in distilled water. The slides were then
immersed for 20 min in a staining dish
containing 1 mM ethylenediaminetetra-
acetic acid (EDTA) buffer (with 0.05%
Tween 20), pH 8.0, preheated in a water
bath to 95­100C. The staining dish was
then removed from the water bath to room
temperature and the slides were allowed to
cool for 20 min. Sections were then rinsed
twice for 2 min each using 0.02 M phosphate
buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2) Tween.
Immunohistochemical detection was per-
formed following the manufacturers'
instructions. Briefly, sections were incubated
with normal goat serum for 30 min at room
temperature. The serum was discarded and
avidin blocking was then performed by
adding 0.05% avidin for 30 min at 37C.
The blocking solution was then discarded
and either rabbit antihuman COX-2 pri-
mary antibody (1: 200 dilution in 0.02 M
PBS, pH 7.2), mouse antihuman VEGF-A
primary antibody (1 : 200 dilution), or rabbit
antihuman factor VIII-related antigen pri-
mary antibody (1 : 200 dilution) were added,
and sections were incubated for 1 h at room
temperature. Sections were then washed
three times (5 min each) in PBS-Tween
followed by incubation with goat antimouse
or mouse antirabbit Immunoglobulin
G (1 : 400 dilution) for 30 min at 37C.
Sections were washed again three times
(5 min each) in PBS-Tween, and incubated
with streptavidin horseradish peroxidase for
30 min at 37C, followed by washing three
times (5 min each) time in PBS-Tween.
Slides were coloured using 3,30-diaminoben-
zidine (DAB), incubated in the dark at room
temperature for 10 min then washed with
distilled water. Slides were finally stained
with haematoxylin. PBS was used in place of
the primary antibody as a negative control.
Positive control slides were obtained from
Fuzhou Maixin Bio-tech Ltd.
For determination of COX-2 levels,
$ 1000 cells were counted per field of view
in 10 different high-power fields (400 Âmag-
nification). The percentage of COX-2-posi-
tive cells (with brown or dark brown
cytoplasm) was calculated for each field.
The sample was scored positive if the mean
percentage of 10 fields was !10% and
negative if the mean percentage was
<10%, in accordance with a previously
described method.11
The VEGF-A-positive cells with brown
stained particles in the cytoplasm were
counted in 10 different randomly selected
high-power fields (400 Âmagnification) per
slide.12 A total of 100 tumour cells/field were
counted and the percentage of cells with
positive cytoplasmic staining was calculated.
VEGF-A expression was considered to be
positive if the mean percentage of positive
cells was !10% and the mean percentage of
negative cells was <10%.
Microvessel density was calculated
according to a previously published
method.13 Briefly, brown-staining of endo-
thelial cell or endothelial cell clusters, clearly
separate from adjacent microvessels,
tumour cells, and other connective-tissue
elements, were considered as a single, count-
able microvessel. Vessels with diameter
greater than eight red blood cells or with
thick smooth muscle or hardened areas were
excluded. Five low-power fields (200 Âmag-
nification) with high microvessel density
were selected for microvessel counting
using a high-power lens (400 Âmagnifi-
cation). For each sample, microvessel
112 Journal of International Medical Research 43(1)
density was calculated as the mean of five
fields of view.
Statistical analyses
Data were presented as n incidence or
mean Æ SD. 2-test was used to assess
between-group differences and k-analysis
was used to assess the correlation between
COX-2 and VEGF-A expression levels. All
tests were performed using SPSSÕ software,
version 10.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA),
and a probability less than P < 0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant.
Results
Renal cell carcinoma tissue specimens from
33 patient cases were included (20 male and
13 female patients, aged 17À86 years, mean
age 54.3 years). On the basis of the WHO
pathological grading system, 11, 15 and
seven specimens were classified as grade
G1
, G2
, and G3
, respectively. On the basis
of the Robson pathological staging system,
four, 16, eight and five specimens were
classified as stage I, II, III, and IV, respect-
ively. Among the specimens, 20 cases were
clear cell carcinoma, eight were granular cell
carcinoma, and five cases were clear­granu-
lar mixed cell carcinoma.
A total of 12 cases of normal renal tissue
were pathologically confirmed and used as
controls. The selected specimens were from
eight male and four female patients, aged
26­77 years, with a mean age of 42.1 years.
On the basis of the WHO pathological
grading system, four, six and two specimens
were classified as grade G1
, G2
, and G3
, ,
respectively. On the basis of the Robson
pathological staging system, two, six, three
and one specimens were classified as stage I,
II, III, and IV, respectively. Among the
specimens, six cases were from patients with
clear cell carcinoma, three had granular cell
carcinoma, and three had clear­granular
mixed cell carcinoma.
COX-2 and VEGF-A expression in renal
cell carcinoma
Renal cell carcinoma COX-2 expression
appeared as brown or dark brown staining
that was mainly diffusely distributed in the
cytoplasm and in parts of the nucleus of
tumour cells, and sporadically distributed in
interstitial tissue. COX-2 expression was
either weakly positive or not expressed in
the stroma (Figure 1). VEGF-A expression
appeared as brown or dark-brown staining,
mainly in the cytoplasm and membrane of
the tumour cells, but also in the cytoplasm of
stromal vascular epithelial cells (Figure 2).
Normal renal tissues were lightly stained in
the collecting system or pink in the cyto-
plasm. The rate of COX-2 expression was
significantly higher (2 ¼ 7.77, P ¼ 0.005) in
the renal cell carcinoma tissue (63.6% [21/
33]) compared with the normal renal tissue
(16.7% [two of 12]) samples. The rate of
VEGF-A expression was also significantly
higher (2 ¼ 5.16, P ¼ 0.023) in the renal cell
carcinoma tissue (51.5% [17/33]) compared
with the normal renal tissue (8.3% [one of
12]) samples.

Correlation between COX-2 and VEGF-A
expression in renal cell carcinoma
In 21 renal cell carcinoma tissue samples
with positive COX-2 expression, 14 cases
(66.7%) showed positive VEGF-A expres-
sion. In 12 renal cell carcinoma tissue sam-
ples that scored negative for COX-2
expression, three cases (25.0%) showed
positive VEGF-A expression. The k-analysis
showed that expression of COX-2 and
VEGF-A in renal cell carcinoma tissue sam-
ples was closely correlated (k ¼ 0.389,
P ¼ 0.021; Table 1).
Relationship between microvessel density
and expression of COX-2 and VEGF-A in
renal cell carcinoma
Microvessel density was significantly higher
(t ¼ 5.30, P < 0.001) in renal cell carcinoma
tissue samples that scored positive for COX-
2 expression compared with those scoring
negative for COX-2 expression (57.80 Æ 8.26
versus 41.75 Æ 8.57, respectively).
Microvessel density was also significantly
higher (t ¼ 2.41, P < 0.022) in renal cell
carcinoma tissue samples that scored posi-
tive for VEGF-A expression compared with
those scoring negative for VEGF-A expres-
sion (55.76 Æ 9.24 versus 48.31 Æ 8.50,
respectively).
Discussion
Cyclo-oxygenase is an important rate-limit-
ing enzyme involved in the synthesis of
prostaglandins, which can metabolize
arachidonic acid into prostaglandin-related
products, thereby maintaining the body's
pathophysiological processes.14 Mammalian
COX includesatleast two typesof isoenzymes
(COX-1 and COX-2); of these, the inducible
COX-2 is widely studied in cancer research.
Studies have shown that COX-2 is only
minimally detected in normal tissues, but
can be rapidly produced when stimulated by
mitogens (such as cytokines, endotoxins, car-
cinogens and oncogenes), and is thus highly
expressed in tumours.15­18 In addition, COX-
2 can promote tumour development through
its many functions, as it is known to induce
carcinogen activation, stimulate cell prolifer-
ation, inhibit cell apoptosis, affect cell cycle,
suppress immunity, promote tumour angio-
genesis, and improve tumour adhesion and
metastasis.16,19­24
One study found that COX-2 expression
was significantly higher in renal tubular

epithelial neoplasia and renal cell carcinoma
than in normal kidney tissue and pyelo-
nephritis,25 and moderate to high COX-2
expression was reported in the renal tissues
of two out of three canines with renal cell
carcinoma,26 suggesting that increased
COX-2 expression may be related to the
occurrence of renal tumours. COX-2 expres-
sion has been shown to correlate positively
with tumour size, grade, and stage of renal
cell carcinoma.27 In addition, progression-
free survival is shown to be low in patients
with renal cancer and high COX-2 expres-
sion, and the survival rate of patients is
negatively correlated with tumour grade,
stage and COX-2 expression.28 Consistent
with the results of these published studies,
the present study showed that COX-2 was
overexpressed in 63.6% (21/33) of renal cell
carcinoma cases, which was significantly
higher than the rates of expression observed
in normal tissue. The present study results
suggest that COX-2 expression is related to
the pathogenesis of renal cancer.
It is thought that VEGF-A is the most
effective angiogenesis regulatory factor with
the highest specificity. VEGF-A is also one
of the determinants of tumour angiogenesis
that can efficiently and specifically have
mitogenic and chemotactic effects on endo-
thelial cells, induce angiogenesis and
ingrowth of host capillaries, and affect
tumour growth, invasion and metastasis.29
The pathological pattern of renal cell
carcinoma is reported to be associated with
VEGF-A expression.30 One study of 99
pathologically confirmed renal cell carcin-
oma cases found that COX-2 and VEGF-A
expression were positively correlated.31
COX-2 has been shown to upregulate
VEGF-A expression in urinary prostate
cancer cell lines, and inhibition of COX-2
expression can result in inhibition of VEGF
expression.24 Another study32 reported that
COX-2 can promote the synthesis of pros-
taglandins (such as prostaglandin E2 and
15-Deoxy-Á-12,14-prostaglandin J2) by
interaction with the relevant receptor.23
COX-2 can also induce upregulation of
VEGF expression by entering the nucleus
through nuclear receptors, disrupting the
regulation of VEGF expression, leading to
increased VEGF, and can induce tumour
angiogenesis.23,24,32 In the present study, the
VEGF-A expression rate was 51.5% (17/33)
of renal cell carcinoma cases, which was
significantly higher than the rate of expres-
sion in normal renal tissue surrounding the
carcinoma; further analysis showed that
COX-2 and VEGF-A expression were corre-
lated. Microvessel density in COX-2-posi-
tive or VEGF-A-positive renal cell
carcinoma cases was significantly higher
than in renal cell carcinoma cases that were
negative for COX-2 or VEGF-A (P < 0.03).
These findings suggest that COX-2 and
VEGF-A are both involved in tumour
angiogenesis.
The results of the present study may be
limited by the relatively small number of
samples and the type of tissues used as
controls. Further research is therefore
required to understand the proliferation,
invasion and metastatic mechanisms of
renal cell carcinoma.
Renal cell carcinoma is an archetypal
solid tumour with highly active angiogen-
esis, and a high level of vascularization.33­35
Because of its particular genetic properties
and heterogeneity, renal cell carcinoma is
extremely insensitive to conventional
chemotherapy and radiotherapy.36 Thus,
renal cell carcinoma is a popular target
tumour for clinical research relating related
to angiogenic suppressors.37 An investiga-
tion that used an in vitro and in vivo model
suggested that a combination of several
antiangiogenesis factors may be more effect-
ive than single factors alone in treating renal
cancer.37 Additional studies are necessary to
clarify the angiogenic mechanisms in renal
cell carcinoma and targeted antiangiogen-
esis therapy.38,39 The present study further
supports other evidence that COX-2 and
Yang et al. 115
VEGF-A expression is upregulated in renal
cell carcinoma, and suggests that microves-
sel density is increased in cancer tissues that
express COX-2 and VEGF-A. These results
provide additional information that will be
helpful in the development of preventative
and therapeutic options for renal cancer.
