sion models were performed using the propensity score­
matched cohorts. In these analyses, treatment with high-
dose ACE inhibitors and ARBs reduced mortality and CHF
readmissions more than the medium- and low-dose treat-
ments combined (Figure).
Comment. To our knowledge, this is the first study to
estimate the effect of different doses of ACE inhibitors
and ARBs on all-cause mortality and CHF readmission
in patients 65 years or older with a first CHF admission.
Unlike clinical trials, our study included a representa-
tive sample of unselected patients with CHF and re-
flects real-world clinical practice. We demonstrated that,
of over 43 000 patients with CHF, approximately one-
third were prescribed low doses of ACE inhibitors or ARBs.
Low-dose users had significantly greater all-cause mor-
tality and CHF readmissions. Both ACE inhibitors and
ARBs decreased mortality and the composite end point
in a dose-dependent manner, with high-dose users hav-
ing the best outcome. However, ACE inhibitors were more
effective than ARBs at reducing the composite end point.
Our results demonstrate that target doses of ACE inhibi-
tors or ARBs are reached in only one-third of patients with
CHF. Physicians should strive, whenever possible, to treat
patients with CHF with high doses of ACE inhibitors or
ARBs to improve outcomes.

Frequency of Prescription Pain Reliever
Nonmedical Use: 2002-2003
and 2009-2010
The public health consequences associated with the
nonmedical use of prescription pain relievers such
asoxycodone,hydrocodone,andmethadonehave
dramaticallyincreasedoverthelastdecade.1 In2009,15597
people died of overdoses involving these drugs--a 109%
increase since 2002.2 Prior studies examining prescrip-
tion pain reliever overdose deaths found that nonmedical
use was common among decedents before death.3,4 Na-
tional estimates of past-year nonmedical use of these drugs,
however, have remained stable since 2002.5,6 These esti-
matesincludethespectrumofnonmedicalusersfromthose
who used pain relievers once or twice to those who were
more frequent or chronic nonmedical users. This Re-
search Letter attempts to determine if the subset of chronic
nonmedical users of pain relievers--those using 200 days
or more in the past year--has increased since 2002, in par-
allel with fatal overdoses of these drugs. Understanding
trends in the frequency of nonmedical use can help iden-
tify populations at greatest risk for overdoses.
Methods. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health
(NSDUH), an annual survey of the noninstitutionalized,
civilian population 12 years and older, provides national
estimates of substance use in the United States. Informa-
tiononNSDUHsurveymethodologyhasbeenreportedelse-
where.6 Data from the NSDUH public use files were com-
bined for years 2002-2003 and 2009-2010 to improve the
detection of differences among specific subpopulations.
TheNSDUHdefinespast-yearnonmedicaluse(PYNMU)
of prescription pain relievers as use in the prior 12 months
without a prescription or use simply for the experience or
feeling it causes. Drugs in this category include prescrip-
tion opioid pain relievers and selected barbiturate combi-
nation products. Once respondents are identified as hav-
ing PYNMU, they are asked to state the number of days
they used pain relievers nonmedically in the past year.
Frequency of PYNMU of pain relievers was catego-
rized into the following 4 groups: 1 to 29 days, 30 to 99

days, 100 to 199 days, and 200 to 365 days of nonmedi-
cal use. Annual average estimates of PYNMU for 2002-
2003 and 2009-2010 were produced using SPSS version
19 Complex Samples (SPSS Inc) to account for sam-
pling methods and weighting in the NSDUH. These es-
timates were then converted to rates of PYNMU per 1000
people 12 years and older. Two-tailed t tests were used
to test significant differences between the periods in the
annual average rates of frequency of PYNMU overall, by
sex, and by age group. Statistical significance was deter-
mined at the P.05 level.
Results. There was a significant increase in PYNMU of
pain relievers of 200 to 365 days between 2002-2003 and
2009-2010 (Table). Any PYNMU and PYNMU of 1 to
29 days, 30 to 99 days, or 100 to 199 days did not in-
crease during the period. The total number of person-
days of PYNMU increased 35%, from 451031411 in 2002-
2003 to 612 829 084 in 2009-2010.
Annual average rates of any PYNMU and 200 to 365
days of PYNMU increased significantly among male re-
spondents between 2002-2003 and 2009-2010. Among
female respondents, any PYNMU did not change; a sig-
nificant decrease in 1 to 29 days of PYNMU was seen dur-
ing the 2 periods.
Among age groups, any PYNMU among people aged
12 to 17 years decreased during the periods. Both the 26
to 34 years and 50 years and older age groups had in-
creasesinanyPYNMU.Ratesof200to365daysofPYNMU
increased significantly among those aged 18 to 25 years,
26 to 34 years, and 35 to 49 years. PYNMU of 200 to 365
days among people 50 years and older more than doubled
but did not reach statistical significance (P = .08).
Comment. Between 2002-2003 and 2009-2010, the rate
of chronic nonmedical use--PYNMU of 200 days or
more--increased significantly (74.6%), while overall
PYNMU did not change. This finding is important be-
cause it parallels increases in overdose deaths, treat-
ment admissions, and other negative effects associated
with opioid pain relievers in recent years.1,7
Variation in annual average rates of PYNMU among
age groups and sex were also found. Some of the largest
increases in PYNMU of 200 to 365 days were among male
respondents (105.3%), and people aged 26 to 34 years
(81.0%) and 35 to 49 years (134.6%). This is consistent
with increases in overdose death rates for opioid pain re-
lievers seen among these groups between 2002 and 2009.8
An encouraging finding is the decrease in any PYNMU
among people aged 12 to 17 years.
The finding that nearly 0.4% of people 12 years and
older, almost 1 million people, reported using pain re-
lievers nonmedically for 200 days or more in 2009-
2010 and roughly 2%, or 4.6 million people, used them
for 30 days or more is concerning. The annual average
estimate of 613 million person-days of PYNMU implies

LESS IS MORE
Declines in Prostate Cancer Incidence After
Changes in Screening Recommendations
On August 5, 2008, the US Preventive Services
Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against
screening men 75 years or older for prostate can-
cer.1 For men younger than 75 years, the USPSTF main-
tained its previous recommendation: " . . . the evidence
is insufficient to recommend for or against routine screen-
ing for prostate cancer. . . "2(p915) (although this recom-
mendation was changed to "do not screen" younger men
in the 2011 guidelines). This study evaluates trends in
prostate cancer incidence following the release of the 2008
USPSTF recommendation. If the revised recommenda-
tion led to a decline in prostate cancer screening rates,
there should be a corresponding decline in the inci-
dence of early-stage tumors among men 75 and older rela-
tive to trends in the incidence of late-stage tumors and
early-stage tumors in younger men.
Methods. I measured trends in prostate cancer inci-
dence rates by age group using the Surveillance, Epide-
miology and End Results (SEER) 18 registry data, cov-
ering 28% of the US population. The SEER registries
collect information on all newly diagnosed cancer cases
in their respective catchment areas.
Prostate tumors were identified using International
Classification of Diseases for Oncology version 3 code 619.
I classified cases by stage at diagnosis using the derived
American Joint Committee on Cancer summary stage vari-
able: early (T1 or T2), late (T3 or T4), or unknown. I
grouped patients into 3 age categories (30-64 years, 65-74
years, and 75 years and older). I calculated incidence rates
per 100 000 persons, standardized within age categories
by age (in 5-year age groups), race (white, black, Ameri-
can Indian, or other), and ethnicity (Hispanic or not His-
panic) to the 2009 population. I used an unpaired t test
for proportions to assess the significance of differences
in rates between years. The data were analyzed in Stata
version 11 (StataCorp) statistical software.
Results. The data included 254 184 prostate cancer cases.
There were 198 417 early-stage cases, 34 695 late-stage
cases, and 21 072 cases of unknown stage. There were
109 053 cases (all stages) among men aged 30 to 64 years,
91 868 cases among men aged 65 to 74 years, and 53 263
cases among men 75 years and older.
The Figure displays the age and race/ethnicity-
adjusted incidence rates of early-stage tumors among men
aged 65 to 74 years (the upper line) and 75 years and
older (the lower line). The trend lines generally mirror
each other, but there is a sudden decrease in the inci-
dence of early-stage tumors among men 75 and older af-
ter the release of the revised USPSTF recommendation.
