Care Survey

Objectives. To understand declines in chronic disability prevalence in the U.S. elderly population, we examined cohort
changes in active life expectancy, a health measure relating population disability and longevity dynamics.
Methods. We computed active life expectancy and life expectancy using the six National Long-Term Care Surveys
done from 1982 to 2004 and linked to continuous-time Medicare service data for the same time period by using
a stochastic process model based on disability scores calculated using grade of membership analyses. We simultaneously
estimated continuous-time disability dynamic and mortality functions to calculate life tables for specific disability states
and for temporally changing mixtures of disability states.
Results. Disability dynamics, measured as changes in grade of membership scores, showed significant variation across
two birth cohorts followed for 24 years. Disability dynamics and disability-specific hazard functions were significantly
improved in the younger cohort (persons aged 65­74 in 1982).
Discussion. Our results, supporting the hypothesis of morbidity compression, indicate that younger cohorts of elderly
persons are living longer in better health. The methods describe individual disability transitions and mortality and other
factors associated with disability changes, making it possible to better evaluate interventions to promote future declines in
disability.
Key Words: Active life expectancy--Disability dynamics--Grade of membership--Fokker-Planck.
ACTIVE life expectancy (ALE) is often used to measure
the person-year burden of functional disability both in the
U.S. elderly population and for international comparisons of
developed countries with relatively high life expectancies and
aging populations (Robine & Michel, 2004; Robine, Romieu, &
Michel, 2003). The World Health Organization recommends
ALE as an important health measure for comparing developed
countries with aging populations because this measure better
reflects health status and quality-of-life issues that, in those
countries, may vary more than total life expectancy (LE).
Often ALE is calculated by using cross-sectional life table
methods (Sullivan, 1971) applied to demographic data on
mortality (e.g., national life tables) and age-specific disability
prevalence rates calculated from national health surveys. Cross-
sectional estimates of ALE calculated at several points in time
can be used to track changes in the overall performance of the
U.S. health care delivery system because they reflect the health
and functional status of the entire U.S. elderly population at
each date (e.g., Manton, Gu, & Lamb, 2006b; Mathers &
Robine, 1997; Robine & Michel, 2004). Measures of health
status other than disability can also be used to refine the
decomposition of total LE. For example, chronic morbidity and
acute health service use have been used as health state
identifiers, as have various types of institutional and long-
term care service use (Ogawa, 1982). Assuming the shape of
the population age trajectories of survival and disability
intensity remain similar over time, period changes in LE and
ALE may carry useful information about cohort health changes
(Goldstein & Wachter, 2006).
Another important issue in calculating ALE is how the health
or functional state (here defined in terms of loss of various self-
maintenance functions) is defined. Many analysts have used
simple disability measures (e.g., activities of daily living
[ADLs], instrumental ADLs [IADLs] based on counts of
disabilities made at specific points in time; Manton et al.,
2006b). Others have used various interview and subjective
expert elicitation procedures to determine the perceived utility
of being in a specific health-impaired state defined across
a 0 (death) to 1 (healthy) scale. Such procedures have been used
to calculate quality-adjusted life years, disability-adjusted life
years, and health-adjusted life years (e.g., A
¨ ija
¨nseppa
¨ et al.,
2005).
Much of the interest in ALE in the United States is
attributable to recent changes in adult LE. From 1954 to
1968, male LE in the United States declined due to increases in
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks. After 1968, male LE began
to increase due to declines in male CVD mortality. By 1980 it
became clear that the male LE increase was not a fluke--it was
due to persistent declines in both heart disease and stroke
mortality.
A general acceptance that disability declines were occurring
in the U.S. elderly population did not occur until data from the

S269
1994 National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS) became
available and were analyzed (Freedman & Soldo, 1994;
Manton, Corder, & Stallard, 1997; Singer & Manton, 1998).
Scientific acceptance that disability declines were occurring
internationally came even later (e.g., Robine et al., 2003). In
1983, a strategy was implemented to increase the normal
retirement age for Social Security from age 65, starting in 2003,
to age 67 by 2027. Recently it has been proposed that the
normal retirement age might be raised even further, for example
to age 69 in Britain (by 2050) and to age 73.2 in Japan (under
current survival conditions). Manton, Lowrimore, Ullian,
XiLiang, and Tolley (2007) estimated the effect of extending
the Social Security eligibility age coupled with the decline in
disability on workforce participation.
Though lacking detailed longitudinal health data in 1982,
some authors nonetheless argued that the health problems of
modern industrial societies at the third stage of the epidemi-
ological transition would be dominated by chronic degenerative
diseases (Omran, 1971) and a failure of medicine to effectively
treat chronic disease (McKinlay & McKinlay, 1977). Other
investigators suggested that the fundamental processes of
chronic disease were not being altered--only LE in disabled
states was being increased (Gruenberg, 1977; Kramer, 1980). In
contrast, Fries (1980) suggested that ALE was increasing more
rapidly than total LE, producing ``morbidity compression.''
Manton (1989) argued that morbidity and disability declines
and longevity increases were all processes positively correlated
in individuals so that there would be a dynamic (over time and
age) equilibrium of morbidity- and disability-free life span with
total longevity.
Unfortunately, nationally representative longitudinal data on
U.S. morbidity and disability in the elderly population only
began to become available in the 1980s (Feldman, 1983), so
empirical longitudinal tests of the different models could not be
done until the 1990s. Wilkins and Adams (1983) made early
estimates of ALE for Canada. Others who made ALE estimates
for the United States using other data, including longitudinal
data from local studies, include Crimmins and Saito (2001),
Guralnik, Land, Blazer, Fillenbaum, and Branch (1993), and
Branch and colleagues (1991).
Manton and Land (2000) calculated ALE measures by using
variants of the stochastic process procedures employed herein
(Manton, Stallard, & Liu, 1993; Manton, Stallard, & Singer,
1992) for the 1982 to 1994 NLTCS. That analysis, however,
did not explicitly deal with cross-cohort variation, because the
14-year time series (1982­1996) did not contain sufficient
longitudinal follow-up to make meaningful cross-cohort
comparisons. In general, those longitudinal results did point
to morbidity compression occurring in the U.S. elderly
population--a conclusion also strongly suggested by long-
term cross-sectional analyses made using the 1982 to 1999
NLTCS (Manton et al., 2006b). Selected studies showed
increases in ALE in other countries (Robine et al., 2003). For
example, in a 15-year study of morbidity compression,
morbidity expansion, and dynamic equilibrium in New
Zealand, the evidence supported the more general dynamic
equilibrium model (Graham, Blakely, Davis, Sporle, & Pearce,
2004). Jagger and colleagues (2007) in a British survey found
evidence suggesting the potential for significant future
morbidity compression.
We used data from the 1982 to 2004 NLTCS (and
individual mortality experience to 2006) here to estimate
cohort-specific changes in ALE and LE to determine whether
part of the decline in chronic disability prevalence (Manton &
Gu, 2001; Manton, Gu, & Lamb, 2006a) is attributable to
cohort differences as opposed to period effects due to, for
example, revisions of Medicare benefits. This makes the
linkage of NLTCS to individual continuous-time Medicare
expenditure and service use records important, both method-
ologically (e.g., the exact dates of death to be used in the
ALE calculations at advanced ages taken from Medicare
records are believed to be more accurate than the ages of
death from death certificates; Kestenbaum, 1992; Manton &
Gu, 2007) and because Medicare records (e.g., International
Classification of Diseases­9 diagnoses) contain significant
additional health and health service use information recorded
on a continuous-time basis to supplement the NLTCS
health data and to explicate the relation of changes in
Medicare and Medicaid use to ALE changes. For example,
Medicare records contain the exact dates of use of skilled
nursing facilities. Dates of diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease
and other dementing illnesses have been recorded in detail
since 1991.
Many benefit changes occurred in the Medicare and
Medicaid programs from 1982 to 2006. In 1983­1984,
a Medicare prospective payment system was introduced to
reimburse acute hospital stays; in 1989, Medicare regulations
regarding home health and skilled nursing facility use were
relaxed (e.g., Duggan v. Brown, 1988). In the Balanced Budget
Act of 1997 (refined in 1999), innovations were made in
Medicare reimbursement of home health agency and skilled
nursing facility benefits (e.g., a skilled nursing facility
prospective payment system was instituted that emphasized
the provision of rehabilitation services based on Resource
Utilization Groups, Version 3). In 2003, the Medicare
Modernization Act was passed, which set the stage for
payment for performance provisions and Medicare Part D--
payment for outpatient drug use. Because these benefit changes
target groups with different health states, the model must be
capable of describing temporal interactions in its dynamic
components.
Additionally, many health improvements occurred due to
period-specific public health interventions (e.g., the health
effects of reductions in smoking, initially stimulated by the
1962­1964 U.S. Surgeon General's reports, became strongly
manifest in the 1990s). Cutler, Landrum, and Stewart (2006)
attributed much of the recent decline in chronic disability to
the diffusion of medical advances in the treatment of major
circulatory diseases. Lichtenberg (2007) suggested that
advances in chemotherapy have contributed to recent (e.g.,
post-1990) declines in cancer mortality.
By determining cross-cohort differences in the disability and
mortality dynamics used to calculate ALE, experts can use
those differences in parameters to improve long-range forecasts
and projections and to better identify shift points in the
processes. By assessing cohort-specific contributions to dis-
ability, researchers will have a stronger empirical base on which
to examine the health mechanisms associated with recent U.S.
disability declines and to improve intervention strategies
(Manton, Lamb, & Gu, 2007).

DATA
The NLTCS is a large, nationally representative longitudinal
survey started in 1982. It was conducted again 2 years later in
1984 and then every 5 years to 2004. Interviewing was done in
two stages. In 1982, a sample large enough to identify about
6,000 chronically disabled (90þ days) individuals was
screened. In subsequent survey years, the sample was
maintained at roughly 20,000 persons. In later NLTCS, only
persons in the sample who had not previously expressed
chronic disability, or who were newly sampled, were screened.
All persons who had evidenced chronic disability in a prior
NLTCS, or who were in institutional residence, were
automatically ``screened in'' at all subsequent waves starting
in 1984; hence, both positive and negative changes in disability
can be assessed. For all persons identified as chronically
disabled, and for persons identified as being in a special
nondisabled sample drawn from persons who screened out as
not disabled (starting in 1994 and repeated in 1999 and 2004),
a detailed community residential or institutional interview was
conducted.
In each NLTCS from 1984 on, a supplementary sample was
drawn of Medicare enrollees who had passed age 65 and
become Medicare-eligible since the prior NLTCS. This
supplementary sample of 5,000 to 5,500 persons aged 65 to
69 roughly maintained the cross-sectional sample size of about
20,000 persons in the next NLTCS by ``replacing'' the loss of
a similar number of deaths at all ages occurring since the prior
wave. This also ensured that the entire Medicare elderly (65þ)
population was represented in each NLTCS. Starting in 1994,
oversamples of persons aged 95þ were drawn (i.e., N ¼ 540 in
1994; N ¼ 600 in 1999; N ¼ 1,584 in 2004). This improved the
precision of disability and mortality estimates at extreme ages
for which there were relatively few data on health transitions
and individual mortality risks but for which chronic disability
changes may play an important role in long-term (75-year)
forecasts of Medicare and Medicaid expenditures (Manton,
Lamb, et al., 2007).
The NLTCS screener and community interview sections on
disability measures and health conditions have been preserved
largely unchanged from 1982 to 2004. In addition, the basic
sample structure of the NLTCS has been maintained (i.e., the
173 primary sampling units drawn from the full set of 376
primary sampling units defined for the Current Population
Survey were used for all NLTCS). For those 173 primary
sampling units, a list sample of elderly Medicare enrollees
was drawn. Thus, 100% of persons drawn for any NLTCS
are linked to a continuous-time history of Medicare costs
and service use and, since 1991, International Classification
of Diseases­9 diagnoses on both Part A and Part B.
Screener response rates remained high (þ95%) across all
NLTCS until 2004. In 2004, the NLTCS response rate dropped
to 91% due to difficulty tracking persons aged 65 to 74 with
low levels of Medicare service use. To deal with possible
response rate bias in longitudinal disability rate estimates, the
Medicare service use and expenditure files, which are available
for 100% of the NLTCS sample (both respondents and non-
respondents) in all waves, were used to adjust for temporally
emergent bias in disability prevalence rate estimates. The
correlation of the increased 2004 nonresponse rate with
Medicare service use in 2004 is informative about the direction
of age-specific bias in disability prevalence estimates and can
be used to reduce such bias. The Medicare service use and cost
data adjustments were applied not only in 2004, but to all prior
waves of the survey to consistently adjust for bias in disability
rate estimates over time (Manton, et al., 2006a). We computed
the weights used for this analysis with the adjusted data.
METHODS
The NLTCS makes 27 measures of impairment in ADLs
(Katz, Ford, Moskowitz, Jackson, & Jaffe, 1963), IADLs
(Lawton & Brody, 1969), physical performance measures
(Nagi, 1976), and sensory function (vision). For each ADL and
IADL, a battery of ancillary traits is assessed. To track changes
in these measures, we used a multivariate procedure to identify
the K disability dimensions represented by those 27 variables
measured at six points in time (1982, 1984, 1989, 1994, 1999,
2004). This procedure reduces the effects of measurement error
by using the correlations (redundancy) of a relatively large
number of measures (dimensions) to define a smaller number of
more reliable dimensions.
We did this by using grade of membership (GoM)
procedures (Manton & Gu, 2007; Manton et al., 1993; Manton,
Stallard, & Woodbury, 1991; Manton, Woodbury, & Tolley,
1994; Stallard, 2005), whereby convexly constrained scores
(i.e., scores constrained to the range of 0­1 and to sum to 1 for
each person) were estimated for each of the K dimensions
(profiles or pure types) underlying the 27 measures. The
longitudinal (for the six NLTCS) GoM model equations (i.e.,
the cross-temporal measurement models) are as follows:
Probðxij
ðtÞ ¼ lÞ ¼

K

ðgik

time t (t ¼ 1, . . ., 6), ÆLj

kkjl
ðÁÞ ¼ 1 over all times of measure-
ment, and xij
(t)is the observed response vector.
Thus, a consistently (1982­2004) defined [bykkjl
(Á)] set of
disability dimensions was estimated using data from all six
NLTCS, within which the cross-time variation of the vector of
K functional scores g
~i
(t) for individuals was tracked (Abonyi,
Babuska, & Szeifert, 2001). The number of dimensions, K, was
determined by examining the difference in the likelihood

Erosheva, Fienberg, and Joutard (2007) derived a model that
they described as a latent class GoM model. Their estimation
was by Bayesian techniques; ours was by a frequency
approach. As they stated, ours is a continuous mixture rather
than a discrete mixture model. Because class membership in
our model is permitted to be partial, it is more parsimonious.

Instead of the 9 or 10 profiles Erosheva and colleagues selected
to describe NLTCS disability, we have usually found only 6 to
be necessary (e.g., Berkman, Singer & Manton, 1989).
To ensure that the meaning of institutional status remained
constant over time, we determined it from two variables. One is
residence type, where a person can be a resident in a group
dwelling. The second variable describes the disability state of
the person. Thus, a resident of an assisted living facility (ALF;
which emerged in large numbers in 1999) can be (a) in an
independent living situation and not disabled, (b) in an
independent living situation and disabled, (c) in a nursing
home bed (i.e., with health care available on a 24-hr basis). In
Table 1 we present the distribution of the population in these
different states in 1994, 1999, and 2004.
The proportion of people in ALFs in nursing home beds
grew dramatically from 1994 to 1999 (i.e., after the in-
troduction of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997). It grew
another 50% from 1999 to 2004 (from 0.81 million to 1.24
million cases). The proportion of ALF cases in nursing home
beds increased from 1999 to 2004, suggesting that the intensity
of care in ALFs was increasing. Thus, the definition of the
(nursing home bed) institutional population defined for Type 7,
by using two traits, was adjusted to reflect the rapid growth of
ALFs from 1994 to 2004.
The substance of the six community disability dimensions is
described by comparing values of the kkjl
relative to the cross-
NLTCS average probability for each of the 27 disability
measures (see, e.g., Berkman et al., 1989). In Table 2, estimates
of kkjl
are presented for each of six disability profiles, with
a short characterization of each presented as column headings.
In Table 2, many of the k coefficients estimated from the 1982
to 2004 data exactly match the results of the GoM analyses of
the 1982 to 1994 data presented in Manton and Land (2000). In
Table 2 we present coefficients (in parentheses) for only those k
estimates in Manton and Land that are not identical to the 1982
to 2004 results. There are very few substantial differences,
emphasizing the temporal stability of the GoM k estimates in
addition to their dimensional stability. This stability is con-
sistent with large-scale simulation studies of the ability of GoM
to accurately extract parametric structures from ``noisy'' high-
dimensional categorical data (Kovtun, Akushevich, Manton, &
Tolley, 2007). This is likely due to the simple structure
constraints (kkjl
set to convex space boundaries) imposed--
especially on the binary ADL and IADL variables.
Persons exactly like the first disability profile are not
chronically disabled and have no physical limitations (i.e., the
kkjl
in Table 2 indicates not needing help with any ADL or
IADL and no difficulty with any of the eight physical
activities).
The second and third disability profiles show little ADL or
IADL disability but manifest modest amounts of physical
impairment. The second profile has slightly less impairment
than the third. The fourth profile manifests primarily IADL
limitations, showing significant physical impairment only with
climbing stairs and holding a 10-lb. package. Profiles 5 and 6
show significant ADL impairment in addition to difficulty with
physical performance measures (Nagi, 1976), with the sixth
profile being the most frail. The sixth profile is the community
group most similar to institutional residents (seventh profile).
Though each of these profiles is substantively meaningful,
and can be viewed as quantitatively defined by a profile of
specific traits, the estimates of the mixing coefficients, the gik

are not probabilities of a case being exactly in one of the K
groups. Because the gik
s are bounded by 0 or 1, the disability
space defined by the kkjl
describes the boundaries of a convex
space as opposed to, for example, a cluster analysis, where the
kkjl
s define the centroids of groups with cases being both within
and external to the space bounded by the centroids. In cluster,
or latent class, analyses (Lazarsfeld & Henry, 1968), the
probabilities of being in a group are based on the distance of the
case to the centroid in the J-variable measurement space, where
the distances to the centroids on the measurements are normed
relative to the dispersion (and correlation) of the variables (e.g.,
Mahalanobis D2 statistic). In GoM, the convexity constraints
require the gik
to reconstruct the observed traits of the case as
a weighted sum of the profiles defining the convex space
boundaries. By defining a ``bounding'' convex space, the kkjl
s
have greater stability because a simpler parametric structure
(more kkjl
s are 0 or 1) is defined and gik
(t)s are strictly
constrained to the interior of the convex space.
The gik
(t)s, estimated by using maximum likelihood
procedures, can be used in extended Fokker-Planck equations
(Frank, 2005; Risken, 1996) to statistically estimate the dis-
ability dynamic and mortality parameters necessary for cohort
ALE calculations (Manton et al., 1992). The Fokker-Planck
equation describes changes with time of the population dis-
tribution of scores on the K disability profiles, where the
distribution changes as a function of fixed (e.g., age and elapsed
time) and stochastic (e.g., prior disability state and age- and
disability-specific mortality) effects. Fuzzy set scores are fre-
quently used as state variables in nonlinear stochastic process
models in engineering studies of complex, nonlinear systems.
The properties of the process in the original measurement
space can be shown to be preserved by the ancillary process
defined over the reduced dimension, filtered fuzzy state space
(Gutierrez, 1994).
To estimate the parameters of the Fokker-Planck equation we
use a generalization of the likelihood function in Manton and
Stallard (1988) that describes changes over time in the gik
(t)
estimated using the GoM model, where changes in the
distribution of the gik
(t) are also caused by systematic mortality
selection (i.e., the risk of loss of a given case due to mortality is
a systematic function of the gik
(t), time, and age). The data on
exact times to death are provided in the linked Medicare
records.
In the simplest case (i.e., for a Gaussian Markov process), the
likelihood function can be decomposed into three terms that
can be independently estimated (i.e., the ``initial'' fuzzy state
distribution, the auto-regressive process of the gik
(t), and
a quadratic mortality function). In the case of a process over the
convex space of GoM disability scores, interaction terms must
be added to the diffusion term (i.e., the process is no longer
Markovian, but is semi-Markovian; Frank, 2005; Manton et al.,
1992), with the diffusion process no longer Gaussian (i.e., it is
``anomalous'' with higher order moments and cumulants due to

dynamics. The hazard matrix, Qm
,
reflects the dependence of an individual's mortality risk on the
seven disability scores evaluated at time m for an individual
using Equation 2b. Because the first profile represents healthy
persons with no disabilities, it can be interpreted as the origin of
the K-dimensional disability space in Equations 2b and 3.
Statistical estimates of the parameters in Equations 2b and 3
(i.e., Q, D, and Æ) were used to calculate disability state-
specific life table parameters by successively (for each life table
age interval) calculating the five equations that define a cohort
life table whose parameters are conditioned on disability-
specific mortality selection and disability dynamics (Manton
et al., 1992, 1993). Life table functions and gik
(m)distributions
can be estimated for the total population--or for an individual
exactly starting in a given disability state at a selected age.
RESULTS
To estimate the cohort model and calculate disability-specific
life tables, one must organize the NLTCS and Medicare data on
a cohort basis; Table 3 illustrates this.
Each row in Table 3 represents a 5-year birth cohort with the
age of persons in the cohort at each survey. These 5-year
cohorts can be further aggregated to provide sufficient data for
a cohort to estimate the dynamics and mortality coefficients for
the disability­mortality process for which we calculated life
tables. We use the 5-year grouping in Table 3 for convenience
in presentation. One can see that, by 2004, the N for the group
aged 80 to 84 in 1982 was getting small (N ¼ 274 for persons
aged 102­106), so we grouped two 5-year cohorts for our
analyses to have better parameter estimates for advanced ages.
Using the average experience of all NLTCS cohorts born
1917 or earlier, followed for 24 years, we produced the LE
estimates in Table 4 using the life table model with disability
dynamics and an age-dependent specific hazard function. Those
estimates were close to the Social Security cohort LE estimated
for persons born in 1917 (Bell & Miller, 2002). Men aged 65 in
the NLTCS cohort model had an LE of 15.01 years compared
to 14.91 years for the Social Security life tables. The Social
Security period life table estimate for 1982, as expected, was
lower (i.e., 14.23 years). Thus, the NLTCS sample and linked
Medicare mortality data reproduced well official Social
Security Administration survival estimates for both men and
women.
To calculate LE for a cohort, one needs estimates of the age-
dependence parameter, h, and of the disability-dependent
cohort mortality function, Q. We estimated these parameters
(see Table 5) by using two different model specifications. First,
in Table 5 we estimated the value of h with no individual

variation in the gik
(m) represented. This was equivalent to
estimating a simple Gompertz function. Second, we estimated
a more complex model in which we generated the dynamics of
disability by using the transition equations in Equation 2b (i.e.,
the representation of disability as a constant [Gompertz
proportionality] factor was replaced by estimation of a disability
dynamic hazard matrix where the matrix of risk factor values at
each age for each individual was generated by a K-dimensional
disability dynamic model).
The addition of the disability dynamics (the set of K gik
(m)
estimated on a monthly basis) in the hazard function reduced
the unexplained variation in mortality due to age (h) for women
aged 65 to 74 (in 1982) by 2.78 (29.8%, t ¼ 24.6) and for
women aged 75 to 84 by 2.82 (27.2%, t ¼ 20.0). For men, the
effects of disability on the age trajectory of cohort mortality
were smaller (1.49 and 1.50) but still highly significant (ts ¼
13.3 and 7.1). Comparisons can be made across cohorts for men
and women both before and after adjusting for disability
dynamics. The h differences for both male and female cohorts
were similar in size (1.0 and 1.04 for women; 0.77 and 0.86 for
men) whether disability dynamics were adjusted or not and
were both highly significant. This suggests the effects of
disability on mortality independent of age are robust (i.e.,
reductions in h are large because much of the variation due to
age is accounted for by the dynamics of disability).
To describe disability-dependent mortality, it is also
necessary to examine the age-independent relation of the
gik
(m) to mortality (i.e., the matrix of risk coefficients Q driven
by disability dynamics). These are in Table 6.
For nondisabled men and women (i.e., Type 1, persons with
1 on the first nondisabled profile), the mortality coefficients
were the same for both cohorts (to the number of decimal places
presented), although the cohort-specific age-dependence pa-
rameter, h (in Table 5), with disability dynamics was modestly
higher for women (0.0655 and 0.0755 for women compared to
0.0624 and 0.0701 for men), indicating that female mortality
increases faster with age in both cohorts. For disabled women
(i.e., those with nonzero scores on Profiles 2 to 7), mortality, in
both cohorts, was generally lower than for men.
To complete the description of the linked (simultaneously
estimated) disability dynamic mortality processes, we need
estimates of the dynamic matrix, D (Equation 2b), to produce
disability-dependent cohort life tables. In Table 7 are male and
female 2-year (24-month) disability dynamic estimates (matrix

D) for two 10-year cohort groups, one aged 65 to 74 and the
other aged 75 to 84, in 1982. The D coefficients for the seven
equations were evaluated (for numerical convenience) as 2-year
disability transition (changes in the K scores) rates from age 75
to 77. The lower diagonal elements of the matrices represent an
average increase in a healthier state (i.e., state with a lower
index than the diagonal) at age 77; upper diagonal elements
represent loss of function by age 77.
The elements in the upper and lower triangular components
of the transition matrix can each be summed within cohorts to
get the net quantitative disability changes for these seven
disability profile scores. For the 65- to 74-year-old male cohort,
the average score of nondisabled men (Type 1) on the frail
profile (Type 6) increased 0.01 in 2 years, whereas the average
score of frail men (Type 6) on the nondisabled profile (Type 1)
increased 0.18. For the 75- to 84-year-old nondisabled male
cohort, the score for the frail (Type 6) profile increased 0.03,
whereas the score of frail men on the nondisabled profile
increased 0.16. For nondisabled women in the age 75 to 84
cohort, the average score on the frail profile increased 0.02,
whereas the ``frail women'' score on the nondisabled profile
increased 0.28. The imbalance favoring transitions to less
disabled states is, in part, due to the high mortality in the frail
states among persons who do not rapidly improve their
disability--especially at advanced ages (see Table 6 hazard
coefficients).
The diagonal values indicate the stability of each person's
state-specific score for ages 75 to 77 (e.g., the nondisabled
profile score for men aged 65­74 in 1982 was 0.93 over 2
years). This can be compared to the much less stable 0.57 for
frail men. For the 75- to 84-year-old male cohort, the score on
the frail profile remained 0.58. Nondisabled men maintained an
average score of 0.87 over 2 years (i.e., the older cohort had
a smaller [6.5%] chance of retaining good functional capacity).
For women, the score on the nondisabled profile was 0.90 for
the cohort aged 65 to 74 and 0.52 for frail women. For
nondisabled women aged 75 to 84, the score was 0.85 over
2 years, whereas the score for frail women was 0.27.
Persistence in intermediate disability states was roughly the
same for men and women in the 65 to 74 cohort. Men in the age
75 to 84 cohort had a higher persistence. Said differently,
female disability dynamics in the age 75 to 84 cohort were
greater than those for either the male cohort or for the age 65 to
74 female cohort. In the transition score estimates (the average
proportion of a specific disability state retained by an
individual--not the proportion of individuals in a homogenous
state), there is a greater chance of increasing the score on
nondisabled states and a lower persistence of residence in
institutions, net of mortality.
With the disability dynamics (D) and mortality (h and Q)
parameter estimates we calculated the cohort-specific life tables
for men and women in Table 8.
In Table 8 we present gender- and cohort-specific life tables,
starting at age 75 (in Table 9 the youngest cohort is first
observed at age 75 when the oldest cohorts are age 65) with the
average gik
(m) for each of the K profiles. For men the score on
Type 1 was always higher for the youngest cohort. For women
the Type 1 score at age 75 was higher for the older cohort and
then, at all later ages, was higher for the younger cohort. This is
due to the decline in institutional use by women in the younger
cohort. For Type 6 and Type 7 the youngest cohort had lower
gik
(m) scores (less severe disability) than the older cohort--for
men and for all women but those aged 75.
In Table 9 we present the LE for persons in each of the K
pure types. This differs from Table 8 in that, instead of
presenting the average gik
(m) at a specific age, we present the
integral of the survival curve in a given pure type K (gik
(m)¼1)
for persons in that disability state for all ages after age X.
Overall LE after age 75 was roughly three quarters of
a year greater for both the younger male and female cohorts.
Most of the differences between cohorts result from a longer
LE for the younger cohort in Type 1 (e.g., 1.03 years for men
and women).
A further comparison can be made with the life table
calculations by, for the same age, starting the population in
a given type (e.g., Type 1) and seeing how the LE and disability
distribution evolves after that age given the interaction over
time of age-specific disability dynamics diffusion and system-
atic mortality selection. This reflects a disability state de-
composition of the stochastic interactions of cohort disability
and mortality dynamics. This is shown in Table 10 for both

younger and older cohorts, where the life table populations are
started at age 75 in Type 1 (and, in Table 11, in Type 7). The
cohort comparisons show that, for men and women who were
initially nondisabled, the younger cohort had higher LE and
a greater likelihood of staying nondisabled.
For persons starting in Type 7, we found a different pattern in
Table 11 for men, with the older cohort having a higher
proportion found in institutions after age 85. The older male
cohort had a longer LE at age 75, but the younger cohort had
longer LE at older ages.
In Table 10, the fraction of the younger surviving male
cohort that was still in Type 1 after 15 years (age 90) was 0.736
and increased to 0.884 at age 100--perhaps reflecting the age
dependence of disability-specific mortality. For the older
cohort, the corresponding numbers were both lower (i.e.,
0.670 and 0.789). The same pattern occurred for women, but
the nondisabled scores were even lower (0.604 and 0.462) after
15 years (at age 90), rising to 0.798 and 0.537 at age 100. For
women, the older cohort had a longer LE at age 75 for those
starting in Type 7 and a greater likelihood of remaining in Type
7. This likely reflects changes in the use of nursing homes at
later ages due to factors such as the 1997 Balanced Budget Act.
As for men, the younger cohort had longer LE past age 80.
To visualize the relative age-specific cohort changes in ALE,
disabled LE, and total LE, we present in Figures 1, 2, and 3
changes in the proportion of life after age X expected to be lived
in three specific groups of disability states.
In Figure 1 (scores are summed) we show how the proportion
of LE at a specific age that is expected to be ALE (here defined
as the sum of the Type 1, 2, and 3 disability scores) changes for
pairs of male and female cohorts. For both genders, the
proportion of LE that is ALE is higher for the younger cohort.
Also noticeable is the improvement in the proportion of ALE at
ages 85 and older. This implies that there is (a) more morbidity
compression in the younger cohort with (b) a higher rate of
morbidity compression occurring at advanced ages in the
younger cohort. Thus, this model does not require assuming the
proportionality of either age- or cohort-specific mortality rates.
This is a very important result in evaluating the continuation of
chronic disability declines over the long run.
In Figure 2 we present the age-specific proportion of LE
expected to be lived in intermediate disability states (Types 4
and 5). For both younger male and female cohorts, this declines
after age 85. There is a greater tendency to enter extreme
disability states in the younger cohorts. This implies that the
dynamics of disability are changing in a fundamental way, with
a greater ability for rehabilitation of functional loss in persons

with many chronic diseases. This dynamic is operating more
vigorously at later ages, suggesting increased capacity for
reducing prevalence within the age ranges currently well
monitored. The older male cohort does not exhibit this
behavior.
In Figure 3 we examine how much of LE at a given age is
spent in highly impaired states (Types 6 and 7). This declines
dramatically for the younger female cohort.
These statistics can be used to determine if morbidity
compression is manifesting itself across cohorts--and across
age within cohorts. We examine these statistics in Table 12.
Morbidity compression is occurring across cohorts for males
and females at both ages 75 and 85. Morbidity compression is
evidenced by a ratio less than 1.0, is occurring across cohorts
for both male and females, and is occurring more rapidly at
later ages. The faster decline in morbidity compression at late
ages is also surprising, given that other authors argued that most
disability declines were at lower levels of impairment (IADLs).
The model can detect these nonlinear changes because it can
monitor the interaction of disability-specific mortality and
nonlinear (convexly constrained) disability dynamics.
DISCUSSION
ALE measures based on the Sullivan (1971) method are
useful in examining how health and function change in relation
to LE in a population. In Manton and colleagues (2006b), we
illustrated this for the period 1935 to 1999 with projections
made to 2080. To examine disability trajectories for individuals
in specific birth cohorts, however, requires different computa-
tions. In those calculations, birth cohorts are defined and
disability transitions are estimated simultaneously with age-
dependent mortality functions for individuals. With a cohort
model, it is possible to determine which biological and
socioeconomic mechanisms may be involved in forming
trajectories by relating the disability score distribution in
cohorts to other covariates for individuals (e.g., biomarkers,

education, and income; Manton & Gu, 2007). It is then possible
to discuss which factors covary with disability over time. This
also provides the necessary elements for examining the
behavior of the more general dynamic equilibrium models of
health and function (Manton, 1989).
We found several consistent findings in our cohort analyses.
First, it is clear, for both men and women, that the younger
cohort has greater longevity and can expect a greater proportion
of the life span to be spent in a nondisabled state. Second, the
longevity cohort difference is on the order of 0.7 to 1.0 years--
even when the effects of cohort differences in disability
dynamics are taken into account. Third, the shape of the within-
cohort hazard function differs between cohorts. Thus, there
appears to be a particular dynamic equilibrium across these two
cohorts where ALE increases faster than morbidity dependence,
with the rate of improvement declining (faster) at higher levels
of disability and at later ages. Though the 24 years of observa-
tion is limited in making cohort comparisons over broad elderly
age groups, there is sufficient information to suggest strong
cohort effects being manifest in this model of dynamic
equilibrium. Roughly 10 years of additional cohort follow-up
would be necessary to evaluate arguments that increased
obesity prevalence in World War II baby boom cohorts could
reverse the disability declines of the past 24 years. Such cohort
studies will be crucial to understanding what the aging of baby
boom cohorts will do to the long-term fiscal stability of the
Medicare and Medicaid systems due to cohort changes in health
and function (Manton, Lamb, et al., 2007).
