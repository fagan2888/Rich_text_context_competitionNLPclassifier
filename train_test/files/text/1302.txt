Abstract
Background: Although age-related loss of fat free mass (FFM) is well known, there is paucity of
data on national estimates, and on the differential influence of ethnicity on the decline in FFM with
increasing age. We determined whether age-related loss in FFM and fat free mass index (FFMI) vary
by gender and or ethnicity, using representative data from the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III).
Methods: Analyses were limited to 5,803 non-institutionalized, non-Hispanic Whites and African
Americans (Blacks) over the age of 40 years. Body density was calculated from the sum of 3-
skinfolds, and percent body fat estimated from body density. FFM was estimated by subtracting
body fat from body weight, while FFMI was defined as FFM (kilograms) divided by the square of
body height (meter2).
Results: Overall FFM and FFMI were significantly higher in black women than white women (P =
0.001; P = 0.001 respectively), but similar in black men compared to white men. Age-related decline
in FFM reached significance level earlier in black men (at age 65­69) than white men (at age 70­74),
and in black women (at age 70­74) than white women (at age 75­79). Similar decline in FFMI was
noted in men and in women. In multivariate analyses, FFM significantly associated with ethnicity (p
= 0.012) and with age (p < 0.001) in women, but only with age (p < 0.001) in men. In men and in
women, FFMI significantly associated with ethnicity (p < 0.001; p = 0.003 respectively) and with age
(p < 0.001; p = 0.004 respectively).
Conclusion: Age-related loss and decline in FFM and FFMI in older Americans is higher for black
men and women, than for white men and women. The development of focused population-based
preventive strategies is likely to improve functional independence in the aged.

Background
Advancing age is associated with a number of changes in
body composition. Notable among these changes is the
reduction in FFM, that occurs primarily as a result of losses
in skeletal muscle mass [1], a condition referred to as sar-
copenia. For example, older men aged 80 years or older
have 25 percent less leg muscle mass than young men
between the ages of 20 and 29[2]. FFM has been closely
linked with reduction in muscle strength in the aged. Fur-
ther, a greater reduction in both muscle mass and strength
have been reported in older nursing residents with history
of falls. Thus reduction in muscular strength is associated
with increased risk of falls and hip fracture, and preva-
lence of disabilities[3]. Independent of fall risk, low FFM
has been linked to higher rates of all-cause mortality in
women in the United States[4]. Therefore, losses in FFM
with advancing age have important health implications.
Higher FFM and lean mass to height ratio in Blacks than
Whites have been reported [5], but mostly in young non-
representative samples. There is limited information on
national estimates, and on the existence of differential
influence of ethnicity on the decline in FFM with increas-
ing age. Given the inverse association of FFM with all
cause mortality[6] and the reported higher FFM in Blacks,
lower mortality rates in Blacks would be expected. To the
converse, both all cause mortality[7] and FFM are know to
be higher in Blacks, suggesting that the relationship of
FFM with ethnicity and all cause mortality may be due to
reasons other than differences in absolute FFM. We
hypothesized that black men and women will have higher
degree of age-related decline in FFM and FFMI despite
higher mean values in Blacks, using data from NHANES
III. The characterization of changes in FFM across several
decades of life is crucial to our ability to reduce the burden
of sarcopenia, osteoporosis, falls and hip fracture, as well
as associated mortality.
Methods
In order to characterize FFM in older populations in the
U.S., we analyzed data from NHANES III. The data for
NHANES III were collected by the National Center for
Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention between 1988 and 1994, using a national
multistage, probability sample of the civilian non-institu-
tionalized population of the United States. The initial
NHANES III sample consisted of 33,994 individuals, 2
months to 99 years of age [8]. The survey design ensured
over-sampling of Blacks, and those 60 years and older.
Data were collected from each participant through face-to-
face interview, physical examination, and laboratory anal-
yses. The overall survey design and provisions for
informed consent have been previously detailed [8].
Subjects in the present study included 8,679 non-institu-
tionalized Whites and Blacks over the age of 40 years. Of
this number, complete data on anthropometric measure-
ments were only available for 5,803 persons. Age was cat-
egorized as decades of life up to the age of 79 years, while
persons ages 80 and older were separately grouped to
avoid over-stratification and loss of statistical power. We
also categorized age by increments of 5 years for the pur-
pose of graphical representations only.
Anthropometric measurements
Weight and standing height were determined according to
standardized procedures [9]. Weight was recorded to the
nearest 0.01 kg, while height was recorded to the nearest
0.1 cm. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight
in kg divided by height in meter squared (m2). Except for
a few measurements that were taken on the left side of the
body because of examinees' limitations, the rest of the
anthropometric measurements were taken on the right
side of the body using standard procedures and were
recorded to the nearest 0.1 mm [9]. All skinfolds were
measured using Holtain skinfold calipers on the right side
of the body. With the examinee standing erect and the
arms hanging freely at the sides, the triceps skinfold was
measured on the posterior surface at the midpoint of the
right upper arm. The suprailiac skinfold was measured at
a 45-degree angle at the marked iliac crest. Measurement
of the thigh skinfold was taken from a vertical line over
the quadriceps muscle at midline of the thigh, and half
way between the top of the patella and the inguinal crease
[9]. All examiners were trained in standard procedures for
obtaining measurements. Out-of-range measurements
were verified to differentiate errors in measurement from
high values for very small or very large examinees.
Because relevant anthropometric measurements were
available only for the triceps, suprailium and thigh, body
density was estimated from the sum of 3 skinfolds, (tri-
ceps, suprailium, and thigh) and age, based on the equa-
tion of Jackson and Pollock (body density = 1.0994921-
0.0009929 * (triceps + suprailium + thigh) + 0.0000023 *
(triceps + suprailium + thigh)**2 - 0.0001392 * (age))
[10], and percent body fat was estimated from the Brozek
equation (percent body fat=((4.570/body density) -
4.142) * 100) [11]. FFM was calculated by subtracting
body fat from body weight. Based on the analogy of BMI
and the high correlation between FFM and height, FFMI
was derived by dividing FFM (kg) by the square of height
(m2)[12].
Statistical analyses
Because our primary interest was in how ethnicity influ-
enced age-related differences or decline in FFM by gender,
initial analyses were conducted for each of the 4 demo-
graphic subgroups formed by the combination of sex and

ethnicity. Separate analyses were conducted for each dec-
ade of life beginning from the 4th to the 8th decade. Mean
values were calculated for FFM and FFMI. The 2 and t-test
statistics and 95 percent Confidence Interval were used to
determine statistical significance. A General Linear Regres-
sion Model for continuous variable response, using the
method of weighted least squares adapted to survey data
[13] was used to test the association between the depend-
ent variable (FFM) and independent variables (age, eth-
nicity and gender) each in a bivariate model. Similar
models were constructed for FFMI as a second dependent
variable. Estimates of individual regression coefficients
(the vector of beta values) and standard errors were com-
puted. Because of our interest in how ethnicity influenced
age-related changes in FFM in men and in women, we
tested for "ethnicity*gender" interaction (dependent vari-
able = ethnicity, gender, ethnicity*gender); and "ethnic-
ity*age" interaction (dependent variable = ethnicity, age
ethnicity*age). Because of the observed gender- and eth-
nicity interaction, and the differences in FFM and FFMI in
the initial analyses, final multiple regression models to
test for the associations of ethnicity and age, with FFM and
FFMI were conducted separately for each gender. The
model for FFM included adjustment for BMI. However,
because FFMI already adjusted for height, the regression
model for FFMI did not include height. This precaution
was taken to avoid co-linearity and the bias of structural
relationship between FFMI and height. All initial analyses
were performed using the Statistical Analysis System
(SAS) package [14]. Given the multistage complex survey
design of NHANES III, final analyses were conducted in
SUDAAN (Proc Descript; Proc Regression) to produce a
more robust variance estimate [15]. Sample weights were
included in the final analysis to account for over sampling
and non-response adjustment.
Results
Subject characteristics
A total of 4,072 Whites (2106 men and 1966 women) and
1731 Blacks (948 men and 783 women) were included in
the final analyses (Table 1). Although Blacks had overall
higher body weight, standing height and BMI compared
to Whites, these differences did not reach statistical signif-
icance. Among women, Blacks weighed more, were taller,
and had higher body mass index than white women. In
contrast, white men had higher waist-hip-ratio and triceps
skinfold than black men.
Ethnicity-based comparison
Collectively, mean FFM and FFMI were similar between
Blacks and Whites. However, when stratified by gender-
ethnicity, black women had higher FFM and FFMI than
White women (FFM difference: 2.88 ± 0.28 kg; p < 0.01)
and (FFMI difference: 0.91 ± 0.10 kg/m2; p < 0.01) (Table
1). The significantly higher FFM and FFMI in black
women persisted through all decades of life, except in the
8th decade or higher. Overall, Blacks weighed higher than
Whites (difference 5.53 ± 0.44 kg; p < 0.001) and this was
explained by higher values in black women (difference
10.35 ± 0.59 kg; p < 0.001) (Table 1).
Age-based comparison
Using age group 40 ­ 45 as the reference, we observed
exponential decline in FFM and body weight with
advancing age in men and in women. This decline varied
by gender and ethnicity (Figure 1). In Blacks and Whites

combined, both FFM and FFMI peaked earlier in men (at
age 51­54 yrs) than in women (at age 55­59 yrs). In black
men, the decline in FFM started about 5 years earlier (at
age 51­54 years) compared to white men (at age 55­59
years), and reached significance level at age 65­69 in
black men and age 70­74 in white men.
Although FFM peaked earlier in white women compared
to black women, statistically significant decline was
reached earlier in black women at age 70­74 (p = 0.025)
compared to age 75­79 in white women (p = 0.01). Initial
onset of decline in FFM occurred almost a decade after
that of men of similar ethnic background. In both white
and black women, decline in FFMI was also noted, but did
not attain significance level. Furthermore, decline in FFMI
was noted in black men starting at age 60­64 and reach-
ing significance at age 70­74 (p = 0.047). In white men,
decline started at age 70­74, and reached significant level
in the eight decade (of life (p < 0.01).
Multiple regression analyses
In multivariate analysis for the entire group including eth-
nicity, age and gender, while adjusting for BMI, FFM sig-
nificantly associated with ethnicity (p < 0.043), age (p <
0.001), and gender (p < 0.001). In separate analyses for
men and for women, FFM significantly associated with
ethnicity (p < 0.012) and age (p < 0.001) in women, but
only with age (p < 0.001) in men (Table 3). This con-
firmed our preliminary observation of higher FFM in
black women compared to white women, and significant
age-related changes in FFM. However, black and white
men were similar in FFM. Because FFMI was already
adjusted for height, the multivariate model for FFMI was
adjusted for body weight instead of BMI. The association
of FFMI with ethnicity, age and gender in the entire group
was similar to that observed for FFM (all p < 0.001). In
men and in women, FFMI significantly associated with
ethnicity (p < 0.001; p = 0.003 respectively) and with age
(p < 0.001; p = 0.004 respectively) (Table 3).
Discussion
Based on a representative national epidemiological data,
we observed significantly higher FFM and FFMI in black
compared to white women, but not between black and
white men. These differences were independent of body
weight. Important differences in age-related decline in
FFM and FFMI were also noted, starting earlier in black
men than white men, but earlier in white women than
black women despite a higher decline in black women.

white women, the decline attained significance level ear-
lier in black than white women. Overall, Blacks had
greater decline in FFM than Whites.
Chumlea and colleagues reported higher mean FFM in
black men and women compared to white men and
women respectively [16]. An inverse association of FFM
and FFMI with mortality has been reported [4]. It is not
known whether this association is driven by differences in
FFM and FFMI, or by dissimilarities in the onset of decline
of FFM and FFMI with increasing age. Because mortality
rates were reportedly higher for black men than for white
men, and for black women than white women, [7] mean
differences in FFM and FFMI are unlikely to significantly
contribute to FFM-related mortality rates in Blacks.
Although several causative factors are likely to be contrib-
utory to mortality rates in different populations, it is also
possible that age-related changes in FFM and FFMI are
important factors that must be considered in future stud-
ies on mortality and aging. Since clinical interventions to
attenuate age-dependent decline in FFM are now availa-
ble, longitudinal studies to examine the influence of age-
related decline in FFM and FFMI on mortality patterns is
imperative.
Because of the availability of more sophisticated measures
of body composition, there has been a great deal of debate
on the clinical utility of anthropometric measurements.
Our findings of ethnicity-related differences in FFM in this
study, is remarkably similar to recent estimates of FFM by
Chumlea et al who used bioelectrical impedance (BIA)
data from NHANES III [16]. Chumlea and colleagues pro-
vided the first national estimates of body composition as
reference, to compare other studies. In fact, the age spe-
cific estimates of FFM in the Chumlea's study are concord-
ant with our anthropometric estimates of FFM for white,
and for black men and women. The BIA estimates of FFM,
together with our anthropometric-derived FFM from the
NHANES III, are analogous to DEXA-derived estimates of
FFM by Gallagher et al [17]. The close approximation of
our estimates with data from studies that used DEXA to
estimate FFM supports the use of a generalized equation
from anthropometric measurements to estimate FFM in a
large representative sample, such as NHANES III, espe-
cially when adjusted for age. Despite the known method-
ological limitations associated with the use of generalized
equations, our study provides valuable data on national
estimates of FFM against which other future estimates
from more robust measures can be compared.
Ethnicity-based differences
Men of both ethnic groups were similar in mean FFM and
FFMI, whereas, black women had higher body weight,
FFM and FFMI than white women. Marshall et al and oth-
ers previously reported higher muscle mass in Blacks com-
pared to Whites [18,19]. Comparable to our observation
of -2.88 kg mean difference in FFM between white women
and black women in this study, Gallagher et al reported -
2.22 kg difference in FFM between these 2 groups of
women [17]. Also, Gasperino et al observed greater
appendicular muscle mass in black women relative to
white women [20]. While black women in our study were
significantly younger than white women, the presence of
differences in FFM that were maintained across several
decades of life, argue against differences in age as a likely
explanation for the higher FFM in black women. Though
Blacks in the study were slightly heavier, and anthropo-
metric measurements have been reported to over-estimate
body density at extremes of body fatness, we found no sta-
tistically significant difference in mean BMI (a measure of
body fatness) between white and black women. This sug-
gests that bias from differences in body fatness may not
explain the observed differences in FFM between the two
groups. Additionally, the final multiple regression model
confirmed the association of FFMI with ethnicity in men

and in women, and of FFM with ethnicity in women only
(Table 3).
Although, knowledge of the exact mechanisms leading to
ethnic differences in muscle mass remains rudimentary,
differences in androgenic activity have been suggested to
play an important role. For example, Dowling and Pi-
Sunyer reported higher levels of testosterone and sex hor-
mone binding globulin in obese black women compared
to obese white women [21]. Moreover, a 3- to 4-fold
higher allele frequency in the human myostatin gene
(GDF8 ­ a gene which codes for muscle mass) was
reported in Blacks compared to Whites [22]. Higher FFM
and FFMI in black women compared to white women
despite lower levels of physical activity (a major determi-
nant of FFM) lend additional support to the presence of
important contributing factors at the molecular level.
Age-related changes
FFM declined with advancing age starting earlier in black
men compared to white men, but earlier in white women
than black women (Figures 1). Using age as a continuous
variable, Regression analysis showed significant decline in
FFM and FFMI with increasing age in women (P < 0.001;

P = 0.004 respectively) after accounting for the influence
of body weight and ethnicity (Table 3). In a similarly
adjusted model for men, decline in FFM and FFMI were
associated with escalating age (P < 0.001; P < 0.001
respectively). This age-related decline in FFM and FFMI
were greater for black compared to white women. In men,
only FFMI (P < 0.001) but not FFM (P = 0.227) showed a
greater decline in black men than white men. Although
findings similar to some of our current observations have
been reported, as far as we know, we are first to report eth-
nicity-related differential decline in FFM and FFMI with
advancing age in the same study, using anthropometric
measurements from a nationally representative sample
(NHANES III). While our estimates of FFM for white men
below age 70 are in agreement with reports from the Fels
study by Guo and colleagues[23], our estimates for
women were slightly higher, but within reported margins
of error. Further, the onset of age-related decline in FFM at
about age 50 in white men and women in our study are in
concordance with the Fels study. The earlier onset of
decline in FFM in black men is particularly interesting,
given the similarity in mean body weight, standing height,
BMI, suprailiac skinfold and body density to that of white
men (Table 1). Similarly, white and black women did not
differ significantly with respect to mean standing height,
thigh skinfold and body density. Of note, is the observa-
tion of differential onset and decline in FFM and FFMI in
this study that appears to parallel mortality patterns for
the United States [7]. While underlying disease processes
could potentially explain this observation, it is also possi-
ble that age-related decline in FFM and FFMI compared to
absolute values may have more important implications
for health outcomes. Moreover, low levels of physical
activity in Blacks [24] may accelerate the process of sarco-
penia and unmask several age-related sub-clinical ill-
nesses. Alternatively, differential reduction in androgen
and testosterone, reduction in responsiveness to trophic
hormones [3], growth hormone [25], and insulin-like
growth factors [3] with escalating age may play important
roles. The relative increase in FFMI in white women is per-
haps related to increased risk of osteoporosis-related com-
pression fracture, reduction in standing height, and
relative increase in FFMI. Independent reports from
Schutz et al, and Hughes et al lend support to the observed
age-related changes in FFMI in white women [26,27].
While decline in FFM in women mirrored changes in body
weight, we found no consistent pattern of differential
weight decline between white men and black men. The
finding in women is particularly remarkable, since heavier
body weight requires higher FFM for support (Table 2).
Nonetheless, a greater reduction in body weight than can
be explained by losses in FFM might suggest a greater
reduction in absolute body fat with increasing age.
Although it is possible that FFMI may overcompensate for
standing height, the lack of significant correlation
between FFMI and standing height in this sample makes
this unlikely.
Within each ethnic group, the decline in FFM and FFMI
started earlier in men than women (Figure 1). This finding
is consistent with published reports from others who
showed linear decline in skeletal muscle mass with
advancing age[28,29]. Unfortunately, many of the previ-
ous studies lacked the ethnic stratification, sample size
and representativeness of the current study. Similar to our
findings of gender-based differential decline in FFM, a
Japanese study reported decreases in lean body mass in
Japanese men but not in women[30]. While our current
anthropometric estimates of FFM and FFMI from the
NHANES III study may be at variance with estimates from
a limited number of studies that showed loss of skeletal
muscle mass in the 3rd decade of life[17], several other
studies that used more robust methods to estimate skele-
tal muscle mass[31,32,23] support our current observa-
tions. Altogether, our study supports the presence of
higher mean FFM in black women than white women,
earlier onset of decline in FFM and FFMI in black men
than white men respectively (Figures 1 and 2), and greater
age-related decline in black men and women than in
white men and women. Additionally, it provides support
for the use of anthropometric measurements to estimate
FFM in large epidemiological studies.
Limitations
The observations from this study are subject to a number
of limitations. First, at extremes of BMI and body fat, there
is bias in the use of skinfold-thickness measurements to
estimate body density from which percent body fat is
determined. This concern is heightened in the aged
because of increased centripetal fat distribution. Fortu-
nately, Pollock's equation included adjustment for age
and the final regression model in our study was addition-
ally adjusted for BMI. While population-specific equa-
tions are appropriate alternatives and sometimes provide
more accurate estimates, they are limited in generalizabil-
ity. Though the equation used in the present study has
greater applicability to women than men, its selection was
based on the available anthropometric measurements in
the NHANES III data.
Because the Pollock equation was not derived from the
NHANES sample, it is possible that it may not predict
body density with the same degree of precision compared
to the original parent sample [33]. Further, the cross-sec-
tional nature of the NHANES III data makes it possible
that changes in FFM with advancing age may have been
underestimated, given known estimates from
longitudinal studies [34]. These concerns are minimized
by the similarities of our findings with that of studies

using Bioelectrical Impedance and DEXA to estimate FFM,
and therefore, may not reduce the significance of the pop-
ulation-based observation from the current study. Inter-,
intra-observer's and instrument bias appear unlikely in
the NHANES given the uniform procedural standards for
anthropometric measurements. Despite these limitations,
the use of anthropometric measurements to estimate FFM
and changes in FFM is simple, low cost, and has a predic-
tive value of within 3 to 4 percent for 70 percent of the
population [33,35] especially when adjusted for age.
Finally, the unique strengths of the study include large
sample size, standardized procedure for anthropometric
measurements and its applicability to the entire United
States population.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we provide additional support for the dif-
ferential effect of ethnicity on the loss of FFM and FFMI as
the population ages. Regardless of the explanation for
these differences, losses in muscle mass have several
important health consequences, and perhaps more so for
FFM decline. Most notable among these is increased func-
tional dependency and mortality. This underscores the
public health imperative of an ongoing epidemiological
surveillance of the variations in FFM. If properly imple-
mented, public health strategies may facilitate the design
of targeted optimization of functional independency as
the United States population ages.
