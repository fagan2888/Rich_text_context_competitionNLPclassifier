Abstract. A series of experiments measured the audiovisual stimulus onset asynchrony
(SOAAV
), yielding facilitative multisensory integration. We evaluated (1) the range of SOAAV
over which facilitation occurred when unisensory stimuli were weak; (2) whether the range
of SOAAV
producing facilitation supported the hypothesis that physiological simultaneity
of unisensory activity governs multisensory facilitation; and (3) whether AV multisensory
facilitation depended on relative stimulus intensity. We compared response-time distributions
to unisensory auditory (A) and visual (V) stimuli with those to AV stimuli over a wide range
(300 and 20 ms increments) of SOAAV
, across four conditions of varying stimulus intensity. In
condition 1, the intensity of unisensory stimuli was adjusted such that d  2. In condition 2,
V stimulus intensity was increased (d  4), while A stimulus intensity was as in condition 1.
In condition 3, A stimulus intensity was increased (d  4) while V stimulus intensity was
as in condition 1. In condition 4, both A and V stimulus intensities were increased to
clearly suprathreshold levels (d  4). Across all conditions of stimulus intensity, significant
multisensory facilitation occurred exclusively for simultaneously presented A and V stimuli. In
addition, facilitation increased as stimulus intensity increased, in disagreement with inverse
effectiveness. These results indicate that the requirements for facilitative multisensory
integration include both physical and physiological simultaneity.

1 Introduction
1.1
Multisensory integration
Meredith (2002) identified two classes of multisensory convergence: areal and neuronal. Areal conver-
gence occurs when unisensory neurons from different modalities merely coexist within a brain region
but do not interact. Neuronal convergence occurs when unisensory neurons from two or more modali-
ties make synaptic contact onto recipient "multisensory" neurons. Multisensory integration occurs
when the response of multisensory neurons to convergent unisensory input differs qualitatively and
quantitatively from that elicited by the individual unisensory inputs alone (Calvert, 2001).
1.2
The redundant signals effect
A well-known behavioral manifestation of facilitative multisensory integration is the decrease in
response time (RT) to pairings of unisensory stimuli presented over multiple sensory channels, where
RT to the multisensory combination is faster than to either unisensory signal alone. This enhancement in
the speed of processing has been termed the "redundant signals effect," or RSE (Miller, 1982). The RSE
is not an exclusively multisensory phenomenon because it also occurs when the redundant signals occur
within a single sensory modality (Iacoboni & Zaidel, 2003; Miller, 1986; Miniussi, Girelli, & Marzi,
1998; Molholm et al., 2002; Mordkoff & Yantis, 1991; Murray, Foxe, Higgins, Javitt, & Schroeder,
2001; Supek et al., 1999), but this paradigm has been widely employed in multisensory research.

Miller (1982) compared two models that could potentially account for the RSE: separate acti-
vation or "race" models and neural coactivation models. Race models assume that each unisensory
(redundant) signal is processed independently, such that on each trial the channel that processes the
stimulus most quickly, and thus initiates the overt response, "wins" the race.According to race models,
redundancy gains can result solely from statistical probability summation and no neural interaction
between the activated sensory channels is required (although such interactions are not ruled out). In
contrast, neural coactivation models posit that signals from each unisensory channel interact in order
to initiate the response. Coactivation across the two channels accumulates until a response criterion is
reached, which can occur before the same criterion is reached by activation within either individual
channel.
Miller (1982) derived a mathematical inequality describing the race model that specifies an upper
limit on the cumulative probability (CP) of obtaining speeded RT to redundant stimuli. Miller's ine-
quality asserts that the CP of obtaining the fastest responses to redundant signals must be less than or
equal to the CP of obtaining the fastest responses to individual stimuli. Specifically, the race model
states that for pairs of stimuli, i.e., auditory (A) and visual (V), at a given AV stimulus onset asyn-
chrony (SOAAV
), at a given response latency (t), that
CP(RT  t|AV)  CP(RT  t2SOAAV
|A) 1 CP(RT  t|V), (1)
where A is delayed relative to V, and
CP(RT  t|AV)  CP(RT  t|A) 1 CP(RT  t2SOAAV
|V), (2)
where V is delayed relative to A. CP(RT  t|AV) is the CP of obtaining an RT faster than time (t)
in response to the presentation of the A and V stimuli. This CP must be less than or equal to the
sum of the CPs of obtaining RTs faster than time in response to the individual unisensory stimuli,
CP(RT  t2SOAAV
|
A) 1 CP(RT  T
|
V) or CP(RT  t
|
A) 1 CP(RT  t2SOAAV
|
V). Violations of
Miller's inequality signify that probability summation cannot account for decreased RTs in response to
redundant signals and implies that neural coactivation has occurred. The evidence that neural coactiva-
tion is a causal mechanism for the AV RSE comes from numerous behavioral and electrophysiological
studies (Giard & Peronnet, 1999; Miller, 1982, 1986; Molholm et al., 2002, 2006; see, however, Otto
& Mamassian, 2012, for a challenge to this standard interpretation).
1.3
The "rules" of multisensory integration: Spatial, temporal, and intensive
Unisensory stimuli that are closely aligned in space (the "spatial rule") and time (the "temporal rule")
are more likely to produce multisensory response facilitation than are stimuli that are temporally and/
or spatially disparate, where the latter may even result in response suppression (Holmes & Spence,
2005; Meredith &Allman, 2009; Meredith & Stein, 1986; Meredith, Nemitz, & Stein, 1987). Response
facilitation may be especially robust for weak (i.e. near threshold) unisensory stimuli (the "inverse
effectiveness rule"). Inverse effectiveness is most conspicuous in the responses of multisensory neu-
rons in the superior colliculus (Meredith & Stein, 1986).
1.3.1
The inverse effectiveness rule
Results from both behavioral and electrophysiological studies have been interpreted to support the
inverse effectiveness rule (Callan, Callan, Kroos, & Vatikiotis-Bateson, 2001; Diederich & Colonius,
2004; Frassinetti, Bolognini, & Làdavas, 2002; Lakatos, Chen, O'Connell, Mills, & Schroeder, 2007;
Serino, Farnè, Rinaldesi, Haggard, & Làdavas, 2007; Senkowski, Saint-Amour, Höfle, & Foxe, 2011).
The generality of the inverse effectiveness rule has recently been questioned on the grounds that pre-
vious studies sampled an insufficient or incorrect range of stimulus intensities to critically test this
hypothesis (Holmes, 2007, 2009; Leavitt, Javitt, & Foxe, 2007; Ross, Saint-Amour, Leavitt, Javitt,
& Foxe, 2007). Studies employing a range of stimulus intensities, whose results have been described
as "generally consistent" with the inverse effectiveness rule (Lakatos et al., 2007), report maximal
multisensory facilitation at intermediate (not the lowest) levels of stimulus intensity. Other studies
(Senkowski et al., 2011), while testing a wide range of stimulus intensities, may still not have sampled
at the lowest end of the perceptible intensity continuum.
Simultaneity in multisensory facilitation 215
1.3.2
The temporal rule: Physiological simultaneity
Stimuli are intrinsically processed at different rates by different sensory modalities. For example,
human auditory evoked cortical potentials onset as early as 10 ms (Celesia & Puletti, 1971) whereas the
C1 component of the visual evoked potential, which reflects activity in early retinotopically mapped
visual areas (V1/V2), onsets much later at 45­60 ms (Clark & Hillyard, 1996; Foxe & Simpson, 2002;
Foxe et al., 2008; Jeffreys & Axford, 1972; Murray et al., 2001). In addition to processing speed dif-
ferences between sensory channels due to intrinsic factors such as unequal pathway length, dissimilar
axonal conduction velocity and/or variations in synaptic complexity, there is the variable influence
of stimulus intensity. Simple RT is inversely related to stimulus intensity, a phenomenon known as
Piéron's law (Jas
´kowski, 1985; Mansfield, 1973; Piéron, 1952; Prestrude, 1971; Roufs, 1963), and
intensity-dependent variations in the latency of neural activity occur in the primate visual system
(Barlow, Snodderly, & Swadlow, 1978; Maunsell et al., 1999) and in the auditory system of both cat
(Eggermont, 1998; Phillips, 1998) and human (Stufflebeam, Poeppel, Rowley, & Roberts, 1998).
There is general agreement that multisensory facilitation requires that the neural activity evoked
by unisensory stimuli converge synchronously onto multisensory coincidence detectors--that is, that
the unisensory inputs must exhibit physiological simultaneity (Hershenson, 1962; Miller, 1986; Raab,
1962). A direct example is that multisensory neurons in the cat's superior colliculus exhibit optimal
multisensory integration when the activity elicited by unisensory stimulation occurs at roughly the
same post-stimulus latency (Stein & Meredith, 1993). Likewise, human behavioral data indirectly sug-
gest that multisensory facilitation of simple RT occurs at stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) corre-
sponding to the difference in simple RT to the unisensory stimuli, where this RT difference is presumed
to reflect the difference in intrinsic processing speed (Diederich & Colonius, 2004; Hershenson, 1962;
Miller, 1986). If optimal multisensory facilitation requires the synchronous convergence of unisensory
signals onto a multisensory coincidence detector, and if the post-stimulus latency of evoked activity
depends on stimulus intensity, then changes in the relative intensities of the component unisensory
visual and auditory stimuli should cause systematic changes in the SOAAV
at which optimal multisen-
sory facilitation (neural coactivation) occurs.
1.4
The present experiment
We measure how the optimal SOAAV
for multisensory integration (as indexed by violations of the race
model) depends on both absolute and relative unisensory stimulus intensities. An evaluation of the
dependence of optimal SOAAV
on absolute stimulus intensity addresses the validity and generality of
the inverse effectiveness rule, while its dependence on relative stimulus intensity tests the predictions
of the strong version of the physiological simultaneity hypothesis.
2 Condition 1
Condition 1 measured the range of SOAAV
over which neural coactivation occurs for two relatively
weak unisensory stimuli.
2.1
Method
2.1.1
Participants
Participants (n 5 4; two male; mean age 5 31 years) possessed normal (or corrected to normal) vision
and normal hearing. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the Code of Ethics of the
World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for experiments involving humans. Prior to their
participation in the study, all participants provided written informed consent. All procedures were
approved by the institutional review board of North Dakota State University.
2.1.2
Stimuli and apparatus
Visual stimuli were circular Gabor patches which, when viewed from 114 cm, possessed a spatial
frequency of 1 cycles/degree and a Gaussian envelope with a standard deviation of 1°. Gabor patches
were centered at 2.25° eccentricity from fixation in the upper left visual quadrant (Figure 1). Stimuli
were presented on a CRT (mean luminance 5 60 cd/m2; monitor refresh rate 5 100 Hz). Gabor
contrast for individual participants ranged between 1% and 4% across all conditions (see individual
conditions for details). For condition 1, Gabor contrast ranged from 1.0% to 1.7%. Visual stimulus
duration was 100 ms.
216 Leone L M, McCourt M E
The auditory stimulus was a 1-KHz pure tone of variable loudness (range 5 31.1­49.0 dBA
) pre-
sented via a speaker approximately co-located with the visual stimuli. Auditory stimulus duration was
100 ms.
2.1.3
Procedure
2.1.3.1 Pretest. Prior to the experiment, all participants completed a pretest designed to equate
the detectability of the unisensory stimuli. The pretest paradigm was a single-interval go/no-go signal
detection task. Participants responded via button press as quickly and accurately as possible to the
detection of any A or V stimulus. Participants performed 15 blocks of trials for a total of 30 trials per
stimulus condition. Each block consisted of a total of 50 trials: 24 unisensory A stimuli (2  12 levels
of dB attenuation), 24 unisensory V stimuli (2  12 contrasts), and 2 catch (no-signal) trials.
Sensitivity (d) was calculated according to the equation d 5 ZH
2 ZFA
, where ZH
denotes the
Z-transformed hit rate (hits/signal trials) and ZFA
denotes the Z-transformed false-alarm rate (false
alarms/no-signal trials). Nonlinear least-squares regression to a logistic function interpolated stimulus
intensities yielding criterion performance (d  2).
2.1.3.2 Experiment. A single-interval go/no-go signal detection task was employed. Trials
commenced with the appearance of a fixation cross. After a variable interval (1,000­2,000 ms), the
first stimulus (S1) was presented. The second stimulus (S2) was presented following a variable SOA.
Participants responded via button press as quickly and accurately as possible to the detection of any
stimulus. RT was recorded to the nearest millisecond. Trials terminated after subject response or after
1,500 ms. Figure 2 illustrates the sequence of events in multisensory trials.
Participants completed a total of 34 blocks of 75 trials each, for a grand total of 2,550 trials. Each
block included 9 V trials, 9 A trials, 9 no-stimulus catch trials, and 3 AV trials at each of 16 SOAs
ranging (in 20-ms increments) from 2100 ms (AV) to 200 ms (VA). Each subject's RT distribu-
tion was trimmed to exclude outliers (e.g., 100 ms  RT  1,000 ms). The trimmed RT distributions
possessed nearly equal numbers of trials contributed by each subject and subsequent analyses in all
experimental conditions were conducted on RT distributions pooled across participants.
The intensities of the unisensory stimuli were adjusted (as necessary) after every 18 trials to ensure
a mean sensitivity of d  2, which corresponds to an 87% correct response rate in a two-alternative
forced-choice task, where 75% correct is typically taken as threshold performance. Thus, stimuli in con-
dition 1 were sufficiently strong that participants could reliably detect them, while sufficiently weak that
performance in this condition could be meaningfully contrasted to that observed in subsequent experi-
mental conditions where stimuli were highly suprathreshold (d  4; 99.9% correct response rate).
Figure 1. Visual stimuli were circular Gabor patches (1%­4% contrast) which possessed a spatial frequency of
1 cycle/degree and a Gaussian envelope with a standard deviation of 1°. Gabor patches were centered at 2.25°
eccentricity from fixation (cross) in the upper left visual quadrant. Scale bar 5 1°.
Simultaneity in multisensory facilitation 217
2.1.4
Data analysis
2.1.4.1 Multisensory response facilitation/inhibition. To test whether RTs to multisensory stimuli
were significantly faster (or slower) than RTs to unisensory stimuli, mean RT in all 16 SOAAV
conditions
was compared with the fastest (and slowest) mean unisensory RTs (A or V) using independent samples
t-tests.
2.1.4.2 Multisensory sensitivity enhancement. Mean sensitivity (d) at each SOAAV
was
calculated using a bootstrapping procedure (Foster & Bischof, 1991). Response distributions for each
SOAAV
condition (hits) were combined with an equal size sample taken at random from the no-signal
condition (false alarms). The distribution of hits and false alarms was exhaustively sampled (with
replacement, 1,000 iterations) to generate sampling distributions of d from which means and standard
errors were obtained.
2.1.4.3 Neural coactivation (Miller's inequality analysis). RT data were trimmed (100 ms  RT
 1,000 ms) and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) were created for each stimulus condition
(A, V, AV). Sampling distributions were bootstrapped by exhaustively resampling each CDF (with
replacement, 1,000 iterations). A sampling distribution of Miller's inequality values was generated
by subtracting the multisensory CDF predicted by probability summation, AVP
5 (A 1 V), from the
CDF observed for each multisensory condition at each iteration such that MIf
5 AV 2 AVP
,where MIf
indicates facilitative MI. This process yielded a mean value (and standard error) of Miller's inequality
for each SOAAV
. Figures 8(c) and (d), condition 4, provide a graphic illustration of CDF comparisons
between unisensory and simultaneous multisensory conditions.
2.2
Results and discussion
2.2.1
Multisensory response facilitation/inhibition
Mean RTs for condition 1 are plotted as a function of SOAAV
in Figure 3(a). While possessing equally
detectable stimulus intensities (d  2), mean RT to the unisensory A stimulus was nevertheless faster
(424.6 ms) than to the unisensory V stimulus (431.9 ms). This difference in RT did not reach sig-
nificance (t1831
5 21.206, p 5 0.228) and likely reflects the shorter latency of auditory versus visual
cortical responses (Celesia & Puletti, 1971; Jeffreys & Axford, 1972). To assess whether multisensory
stimulation produced response facilitation, mean RT in each AV condition was compared with that in
the fastest unisensory condition (A). Green bars identify those AV SOAs where results of independ-
ent samples t-tests indicated that significant multisensory response enhancement occurred. Significant
response facilitation occurred at SOAAV
values of 260, 240, 220, 0, 20, and 40 ms (t1303

p 5 0.004; t1303

stimulation might produce response inhibition, mean RT in AV conditions was compared with that in
the slowest unisensory condition (V). Red bars indicate that significant response inhibition occurred at
Figure 2. Multisensory trials commenced with the appearance of a fixation cross. After a variable interval
(1,000­2,000 ms) the first stimulus (S1) was presented. The second stimulus (S2) was presented following a
variable SOA. Participants responded via button press as quickly and accurately as possible to the detection of any
stimulus. Response time (RT) was recorded to the nearest millisecond. Trials terminated after subject response
or after 1,500 ms.

Multisensory sensitivity enhancement
If sensitivities to the unisensory A and V stimuli combine probabilistically then the sensitivity in
multisensory (AV) conditions (d

) should equal the quadratic sum of the unisensory sensitivities

.

Neural coactivation (Miller's inequality analysis)
Figure 5(a) spectrum codes the value of Miller's inequality as a function of RT and SOAAV
. Figure 5(b)
is a magnified view of the region exhibiting significant (p  0.05) violations of the race model (posi-
tive values). Noteworthy is that positive values of the inequality occur exclusively at an SOAAV
value
of 0 ms (physical simultaneity), across a range of RT (200­325 ms) with a peak value (0.0360) occur-
ring at 292 ms (Figure 5c).
3 Condition 2
Condition 2 was designed to reveal how changing the intensity of the V stimulus might influence its
integration with the relatively weak A stimulus. Specifically, we tested whether increasing the con-
trast of the V stimulus caused a change in the optimal SOAAV
for multisensory integration relative to
condition 1. If physiological simultaneity determines multisensory facilitation, then increasing the

intensity of the V stimulus (which increases the speed of visual processing and reduces mean RT to V
stimuli) should shift the optimal SOAAV
to more negative values such that, relative to condition 1, the
A stimulus will now need to be presented earlier in time with respect to the V stimulus. Conversely, the
optimal SOAAV
will remain unchanged if physical simultaneity is critical for multisensory integration.
3.1
Method
The participants in condition 2 were the same as in condition 1. The experimental methods and pro-
cedures were as in condition 1 except that V stimulus contrast was increased to levels producing a
criterion sensitivity of d  4 for each participant (contrast range 5 3.4%­4.0%). To ensure this cri-
terion sensitivity, d was calculated for unisensory A and V stimuli after every 18 trials throughout the
experiment and V stimulus contrast and A stimulus intensity were adjusted as necessary.
3.2
Results and discussion
3.2.1
Multisensory response facilitation/inhibition
Mean RTs in condition 2 are plotted as a function of SOAAV
in Figure 3(b). As expected, mean RT
to the unisensory V stimulus was now significantly faster (315.8 ms) than to the unisensory A stimu-
lus (450.0 ms) (t1984
5 225.158, p  0.001). This highly significant reversal in the relative speed
of responses to A and V stimuli reflects the approximately threefold increase in V stimulus contrast
relative to condition 1, and is an illustration of Piéron's law. To assess whether multisensory stimula-
tion produced response facilitation, mean RT in AV conditions was compared with that in the fastest
unisensory condition (V). The green bars indicate that significant response facilitation occurred at
SOAAV
values of 0 and 20 ms (t1597
5 22.272, p 5 0.023 and t1597
5 22.160, p 5 0.031, respectively).

Neural coactivation (Miller's inequality analysis)
Figure 6(a) spectrum codes the values of Miller's inequality as a function of RT and SOAAV
for condi-
tion 2. A magnified view of the region exhibiting significant (p  0.05) violations of the race model is
shown in Figure 6(b). As in condition 1, significant violations of Miller's inequality occurred for phys-
ically simultaneous A and V stimuli, as well as at an SOAAV
of 20 ms. At an SOAAV
of 0 ms (Figure 6c),
violations occurred for physically simultaneous stimuli across a range of RT (217­290 ms), with a
peak at 244 ms. The fact that the greatest violations of Miller's inequality occur when unisensory
stimuli are physically simultaneous is clearly incompatible with the strong version of the physiologi-
cal simultaneity hypothesis, which posits that neural coactivation should occur at an SOA that closely
corresponds to the difference in mean RT to the unisensory stimuli. The results of condition 2 also
clearly show that neural coactivation can occur when a more rapidly processed stimulus (V) precedes
a more slowly processed stimulus (A). The results of condition 2 are also inconsistent with the inverse
effectiveness rule, because increasing the intensity of the V stimulus actually increased the magnitude
of the violation of Miller's inequality (0.0360 vs. 0.0530 in conditions 1 and 2, respectively).
4 Condition 3
Condition 3 is complimentary to condition 2 and was designed to reveal how changing the intensity of
the A stimulus might influence its integration with a relatively weak V stimulus. Specifically, we tested
whether increasing the intensity (loudness) of the A stimulus caused a change in the optimal SOAAV
for
multisensory integration relative to condition 1. Again, if physiological simultaneity is necessary for
multisensory facilitation, then increasing the intensity of the A stimulus (which will increase the speed
of auditory processing and reduce mean RT to A stimuli) should shift the optimal SOAAV
for neural
coactivation to more positive values such that, relative to condition 1, the V stimulus would need to
be presented earlier with respect to the A stimulus. Conversely, the optimal SOAAV
will not change if
physical simultaneity determines multisensory integration.
4.1
Method
The participants in condition 3 were the same as in conditions 1 and 2. The experimental methods and
procedures were as in condition 1, except that A stimulus intensity was increased to levels producing a
criterion sensitivity d  4 (intensity range 5 44.5­49.0 dBA
). In order to ensure criterion sensitivity,
d was calculated for unisensory A and V stimuli after every 18 trials throughout the experiment and V
stimulus contrast and A stimulus intensity were adjusted as necessary.

Results and discussion
4.2.1
Multisensory response facilitation/inhibition
Mean RTs in condition 3 are plotted as a function of SOAAV
in Figure 3(c). As expected, mean RT to
the unisensory A stimulus (301.5 ms) was significantly faster than that to the unisensory V stimulus
(441.7 ms) (t1978
5 232.247, p  0.001). The significantly faster mean response to the intense A
stimulus in condition 3, relative to conditions 1 and 2, is another illustration of Piéron's law. To assess
whether multisensory stimulation produced response facilitation, mean RT in AV conditions was com-
pared with that in the fastest unisensory condition (A). Green bars indicate that significant response
facilitation occurred at SOAAV
values of 220 and 0 ms (t1619
5 22.340, p 5 0.019; t1616
5 24.145,
p  0.001, respectively). There was no multisensory response inhibition at any SOAAV
.

Neural coactivation (Miller's inequality analysis)
Figure 7(a) spectrum codes the values of Miller's inequality as a function of RT and SOAAV
for condi-
tion 3. A magnified view of the region exhibiting significant violations of the race model is shown in
Figure 7(b). At an SOAAV
of 0 ms (Figure 7c), positive values of Miller's inequality occur across a
range of RT (192­330 ms), with a peak at 288 ms. As in conditions 1 and 2, significant violations of
Miller's inequality occurred for physically simultaneous A and V stimuli, as well as at an SOAAV
of
220 and 240 ms. Once again, the fact that violations of Miller's inequality have the greatest mag-
nitude when unisensory stimuli are physically simultaneous is clearly incompatible with the strong
version of the physiological simultaneity hypothesis, and the results of condition 3 confirm that neu-
ral coactivation can occur when a more rapidly processed stimulus (A) precedes the more slowly

rule, because increasing the intensity of the A stimulus significantly increased the magnitude of the
violation of Miller's inequality (0.0360 vs. 0.1113 in conditions 1 and 3, respectively).
5 Condition 4
Finally, condition 4 tested whether increasing the intensities of both A and V stimuli to clearly suprath-
reshold levels (d  4) would result in a pattern of optimal SOAAV
for multisensory integration that
resembled that of condition 1.
5.1 Method
The participants in condition 4 were the same as in condition 1. The experimental paradigm replicated
condition 1 with the following exception. Both V and A stimuli were increased in intensity to levels
producing criterion sensitivities of d  4.
5.2 Results and discussion
5.2.1 Multisensory response facilitation/inhibition
Mean RTs in condition 4 are plotted as a function of SOAAV
in Figure 3(d). As in condition 1, mean
RT to the unisensory A stimulus was significantly faster (286.3 ms) than that to the unisensory V
stimulus (316.7 ms) (t2402
5 28.74, p  0.01). The significantly faster mean responses to the highly
suprathreshold A and V stimuli in condition 4, relative to condition 1 (t2121
5 228.338, p  0.01 and
t2112
5 226.030, p  0.01, respectively), again illustrate Piéron's law. To assess whether multisensory
stimulation produced response facilitation, mean RT in AV conditions was compared with that in the

5.2.2 Neural coactivation (Miller's inequality analysis)
Figure 8(a) spectrum codes the values of Miller's inequality as a function of RT and SOAAV
for condi-
tion 4. A magnified view of the region exhibiting significant violations of the race model is shown in
Figure 8(b). As in condition 3, positive values of Miller's inequality occurred for SOAAV
220 and 0
ms, a result that is incompatible with the strong version of the physiological simultaneity hypothesis.
At an SOAAV
of 0 ms, positive values of Miller's inequality occur across a range of RT (171­257 ms),
with a peak at 232 ms. The results of condition 4 are directly contradictory to the inverse effectiveness
rule, because increasing the intensity of both unisensory stimuli significantly increased the magnitude
of the violation of Miller's inequality (0.0360 vs. 0.1678 in conditions 1 and 4, respectively).
Figures 8(c) and (d) illustrate how the RT data were analyzed in order to compute values of
Miller's inequality and establish confidence intervals. CP distributions as a function of RT were con-
structed for the A (purple) and V (blue) unisensory stimulus conditions, and for their multisensory
combination, AVo
, at all values of SOAAV
(SOAAV
5 0 ms is shown in red). The sum of the CP distribu-
tions for the unisensory conditions (A 1 V) is the CP predicted by the race model (black). The value
of Miller's inequality is computed at each value of RT by subtraction: CP(AVo
) 2 CP(A 1 V). When
the CP of observed RT exceeds that predicted by the race model, the value of Miller's inequality is

dure (Foster & Bischof, 1991) where the AVo

6 General discussion
Taken together, the results of the four experimental conditions reveal that audiovisual multisensory
facilitation, as indexed by significant violations of the race model, occurs only over a narrow range of
stimulus onset asynchronies which invariably includes physical simultaneity. Manipulations of stimu-
lus intensity that changed the speed of unisensory processing, as revealed by significant alterations
of mean RT, had no influence on the range of SOAAV
over which multisensory interaction occurred.
Moreover, when the range of SOAAV
over which significant violations of the race model occurred did
extend beyond physical simultaneity (condition 2: 20 ms; condition 3: 220 and 240 ms; condition 4:
220 ms), the extension was such that the more rapidly processed stimulus needed to precede the more
slowly processed stimulus, a result that is, in fact, opposite to the strong version of the physiological
simultaneity hypothesis (Hershenson, 1962), which predicts that the more slowly processed stimulus
should need a "head start" in order to arrive at some central site simultaneously with a more rapidly
processed stimulus. It should be noted that violations of Miller's inequality at all non-zero SOAs were
smaller than those at simultaneity. Finally, there was a surprising lack of evidence for multisensory
facilitation with respect to sensitivity (d).
6.1
Inverse effectiveness
Although the rule of inverse effectiveness has sometimes been upheld as a universally observed char-
acteristic of multisensory integration (Lakatos et al., 2007; Meredith & Stein, 1986), a number of
studies have reported findings that are inconsistent with this rule (Lakatos et al., 2007; Ross et al.,
2007). Our results likewise do not support the inverse effectiveness rule because the magnitude of the
violations of Miller's inequality we observed generally increased with increasing stimulus intensity
(at SOAAV
5 0 ms: 0.0360, 0.0530, 0.1113, and 0.1678 in conditions 1­4, respectively). Our results
are, however, consistent with a reinterpretation (Holmes, 2007) of the results of Alvarado, Vaughan,
Stanford, and Stein (2007), who showed that whereas multisensory enhancement in neurons in the
cat's superior colliculus obeyed the rule of inverse effectiveness when analyzed in terms of relative
spike rate increase, they demonstrated the behavior we observe, viz., increasing effectiveness with
increasing stimulus intensity, when analyzed in terms of absolute spike rates. On the contrary, the
range of SOAAV
over which statistically significant decreases in simple mean RT occur is wider for the
weakest stimuli (condition 1) than for the other conditions (Figure 3), but increases in the time window
of integration is not what is typically meant by inverse effectiveness.
6.2
Intensity-adjusted latency coding
Although physiological activity resulting from two unisensory signals must simultaneously converge
on a multisensory "coincidence detector" for facilitative MI to occur, we find that such facilitation
occurs nearly exclusively for physically simultaneous multisensory occurrences, independent of fac-
tors that differentially affect unisensory processing time, such as stimulus intensity. This makes sense
from an ecological perspective, for if multisensory facilitation has aided survival, the advantage it
confers must be the enhanced processing of genuine physical events (e.g., the sights and sounds of
predators or prey which, because they have a common cause, are physically simultaneous), not merely
to physiological simultaneities some (potentially large) fraction of which are accidental. Although
the evolutionary advantage of this result is undeniable, the mechanism whereby it is accomplished is
unclear.
Consider the case in which facilitative MI occurs at a coincidence detector where the response
latencies for a given pair of simultaneously presented unisensory stimuli are exactly equal. Varying
the relative intensities (and hence the processing speed) of the physically simultaneous unisensory
stimuli will cause their physiological responses to convergence at this detector asynchronously, and
yet we find that physically simultaneous stimuli integrate despite variations in intensity. Conversely,
the physically asynchronous occurrence of two unisensory stimuli can, depending on their relative
intensity, result in spuriously coincident physiological responses that nevertheless fail to result in
Simultaneity in multisensory facilitation 225
facilitation. This suggests that the time of arrival at multisensory sites must be corrected for latency
differences caused by adventitious variations in stimulus intensity. In other words, the system must
"take account" of differences in physiological response latency that are unrelated to true unisensory
SOA in order to reject false correspondences. It is well known that neural networks can undergo Heb-
bian learning, wherein the strength of synaptic connections is modified based on experience. The bio-
physical bases of temporal coincidence detection could involve mechanisms of spike-time dependent
synaptic plasticity (Song, Miller, & Abbott, 2000) and/or synaptic scaling (Turrigiano, Leslie, Desai,
Rutherford, & Nelson, 1998). Our novel idea that synapses might additionally be "tuned" to particular
stimulus intensities is purely speculative. In short, however, physiological response simultaneity is a
necessary but not sufficient condition for facilitative MI.
One possible mechanism for achieving this outcome is shown in Figure 9. Assume a neural net-
work of AV coincidence detectors (labeled 1­5 in Figure 9) which integrate unisensory inputs (i.e.,
fire) exclusively when A and V inputs arrive synchronously, thus reflecting the necessary condition of
physiological simultaneity. The coincidence detectors receive input from both A and V sensory recep-
tors via delay lines and are thus place coded (Jeffress, 1948). A given afferent A or V signal ultimately
supplies input to the entire network of coincidence detectors at a continuum of latencies. In Jeffress'
(1948) theory of binaural sound localization, differences in the time of arrival of sound at the two
ears (the interaural time difference) result in physiological convergence that varies in location within
the network of coincidence detectors such that the spatial location of the sound source is read out by
the relative spatial location of the activated coincidence detector. This explanation can be adapted to
explain our results.
We begin by assuming that organisms have ubiquitous access to the physiological activity gener-
ated by genuinely simultaneous multisensory events in their environment, that is, that they have access
to ground truth. Thus, over the course of their development organisms will accrue robust Bayesian
priors with respect to multisensory convergence. The class of multisensory stimulation for which exact
latency/intensity information is known results from self-generated events. For example, tapping an
object with the hand (or a tool), or throwing a projectile whose impact with a nearby surface produces
both visual and auditory consequences, etc., produces afferent visual, auditory, and haptic/kinesthetic
signals of known common origin. Because these signals routinely vary in intensity, the latencies at
Figure 9. An illustration of how learned associations (Bayesian priors) between physical simultaneity and relative
stimulus intensity might be represented in a place-coded delay line network of coincidence detectors. Panels (a­c)
refer to situations where physically simultaneous A and V events vary in relative intensity. In panel (a), the A and
V inputs are of nominally equivalent relative intensity (denoted by the similar size of the delay lines, lettering,
and the circular input and synaptic symbols), and the afferent signals (coded red) converge synchronously on and
activate coincidence detector 3 (red). In panels (b) and (c), simultaneous A and V events vary in intensity. The
more intense stimulus (thick line) propagates through the network more rapidly than the less intense stimulus
(thin line), and their signals thus converge on coincidence detectors 1 or 5. Panel (d) illustrates two inputs of
nominal equivalent intensity where the visual stimulus is delayed in time of onset relative to the auditory stimulus
(represented here as added pathway length).

which these signals converge at multisensory coincidence detectors can, over repeated stimulation,
result in the accumulation of intensity-adjusted probability distributions that form the basis for com-
puting the posterior probability that any set of incoming multisensory signals have a common origin.
One way in which the Bayesian priors could be instantiated in a delay-line network is illustrated
in Figure 9.
Figures 9(a­c) refer to situations where physically simultaneous A and V events vary in relative
intensity. In Figure 9(a), the A and V inputs are of nominally equivalent relative intensity (denoted
by the similar size of the delay lines, lettering, and the circular input and synaptic symbols), and the
afferent signals (coded red) converge synchronously on and activate coincidence detector 3 (red). No
other coincidence detector receives simultaneous input. Figures 9(b) and (c) describe situations where
simultaneousAand V events vary in intensity. The more intense stimuli (thick lines) propagate through
the network more rapidly than the less intense stimuli (thin lines), and their signals thus converge on
coincidence detector 1 or 5. Because we are assuming that in each case the physical origin of the
afferent signals is known to have been common, physical stimulus synchrony can be disambiguated
and correctly read out by the network only if the coincidence detectors are trained (learn) to fire when
the constituent inputs possess the appropriate relative intensities. Thus, in Figure 9(d), two inputs of
nominal equivalent intensity are illustrated where the visual stimulus is delayed in time of onset rela-
tive to the auditory stimulus (represented here as added pathway length). Being of nominal equivalent
intensity, the two signals propagate through the network at similar speeds and converge on coincidence
detector 4. However, because this coincidence detector has "learned" that physically simultaneous A
and V events only converge at its location when they possess unequal intensities (intensity tuning is
indicated by the sizes of the circular synaptic contacts), it rejects this physiological simultaneity as
spurious and does not integrate. Animations demonstrating the four conditions of Figure 9 are avail-
able as a supplementary flash file.
