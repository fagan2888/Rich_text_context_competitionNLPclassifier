Objectives. This study examined nativity as a risk factor for poor physical and emotional health for an ethnically di-
verse population making the transition into retirement. The authors addressed whether the health disadvantage observed
for immigrants lessens with increased time spent in the country (supporting theories of assimilation) or increases with
duration of residence (supporting theories of cumulative disadvantage).
Methods. The sample was drawn from Waves 1 and 2 of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), an in-depth eco-
nomic, social, and health database of persons in midlife and beyond. The analyses were restricted to 9,912 native-born
and 1,031 foreign-born individuals.
Results. The data revealed that after socioeconomic factors were controlled, foreign-born individuals were at higher
risk of poor emotional health than their native-born counterparts. Although aging immigrants displayed worse health
than the native-born population, this disadvantage was mediated by duration of residence (young age at migration) and
socioeconomic incorporation.
Discussion. These findings extend our understanding of nativity and duration as risk factors for poor physical and
emotional health. Immigrants may overcome the nativity disadvantages found for emotional distress with increased du-
ration of residence, but the pattern becomes more complicated with the inclusion of race and Hispanic ethnicity.
N this study we considered an important dimension of
population diversity, nativity, in explaining health differ-
entials throughout the adult life course. Controlling for eco-
nomic and social resources, we examined the salience of
nativity with respect to self-reported health among an ethni-
cally diverse population poised for retirement. Regardless
of selection effects, adult immigrants report worse global
health than native-born persons. But, does that health disad-
vantage lessen or intensify with duration of residence? Ex-
ploring differences between two competing approaches of
assimilation enabled us to evaluate the potential positive
and negative contributions of duration of residence for the
health status of aging immigrants compared with that of na-
tive-born individuals.
We employed the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a
nationally representative sample of individuals nearing re-
tirement in the United States. This dataset is uniquely suited
to the proposed analyses for several reasons. First, it con-
tains detailed health, wealth, and labor force participation
information (Bound, Schoenbaum, & Waidmann, 1996).
Second, it provides information on nativity, including age at
migration, and indicators of social isolation. Most impor-
tant, the longitudinal design of HRS enables the isolation of
predictor variables at Time 1 and their relationship to health
outcomes at Time 2. Although not a perfect solution to the
difficulties associated with disentangling the health­wealth
nexus, this time order helps establish the asymmetry of a
causal relationship (Bohrnstedt & Knoke, 1988). Building
on previous HRS investigations, these data permit an analy-
sis of the ways in which demographic, social, and economic
characteristics indirectly and directly influence the general
well-being of persons approaching retirement (e.g., Kington
& Smith, 1997).
Individuals transitioning into retirement represent a
unique study population. They are approaching the end of
their working life, which represents not only changes in life-
style, but most likely the end of asset accumulation. In
terms of social networks, contacts are gained throughout the
life course, yet the pre-retirement years are critical for es-
tablishing patterns of reliance in later life. In the postretire-
ment years, when health may decline, preexisting social net-
works are crucial. In observing individuals approaching
retirement we were able to assess the resources transferred
into retirement. Most resource accumulation occurs during
the working years. Therefore, differentiation in financial re-
sources (whether by nativity or race/Hispanic ethnicity) ob-
served at this period may be indicative of future inequality
patterns and is likely to have serious health implications. By
focusing on this age group, we attempted to highlight pat-
terns of differentiation in resource access and health out-
comes, patterns likely to amplify as this group moves into
retirement and beyond.
Background
The ethnic composition of the immigrant stream into the
United States has changed dramatically over the past cen-
tury with recent concerns centering on its racial and ethnic
composition. Differences in education, occupational attain-
ment, and income associated with minority group member-
ship persist throughout the life course, placing individuals at
distinctly different risks of poverty and subsequent illness
(Williams & Collins, 1995). Evidence suggests that Blacks
I
S276 ANGEL ET AL.
and Hispanics are especially affected by involuntary labor
market exit or withdrawals, undermining their economic
well-being in later life (Crystal, Shea, & Krishnaswami,
1992; Flippen & Tienda, 2000). Documenting the interplay
among socioeconomic factors, nativity, and health status is
fundamental for understanding racial and ethnic disparities.
Research points to the increasing importance of sociocul-
tural characteristics in determining individual health status
and well-being, especially in light of increasing ethnic di-
versity in the United States (Pampel, 1998). Demographic
characteristics, such as advanced age, gender (female), and
marital status (nonmarried), are known proximate risk fac-
tors for poor self-health ratings (e.g., Maddox, 1962; Ver-
brugge, 1983). Socioeconomic factors, such as education,
income, and employment, are also very powerful determi-
nants (Feinstein, 1993). House, Landis, and Umberson
(1988), for example, found that social assets, such as pres-
ence of children in the household and friendship networks
in the community, are associated with good health (see also
Kawachi, Kennedy, & Glass, 1999).
Few investigations have examined the role of nativity in
explaining general health status (Findley, 1988). Foreign-
born persons appear to enjoy a mortality advantage over in-
dividuals born in the United States (Hummer, Rogers, Nam,
& LeClere, 1999; Markides & Coreil, 1986; Rosenwaike,
1987; Vega & Amaro, 1994; Vega et al., 1998; Weeks,
Rumbaut, & Ojeda, 1999). However, increased time spent
in the United States erases much of the mortality advantage
associated with nativity status. Individuals less acculturated
in terms of language proficiency and social mores (such as
immigrants) exhibit higher rates of social isolation and
compromised health (J. L. Angel & Angel, 1992; J. L. An-
gel, Angel, McClellan, & Markides, 1996; Kossoudji,
1989). Access to formal and informal support systems (e.g.,
the lay-referral network) may differ by nativity and in some
cases decrease immigrant access to assistance (LeClere,
Jensen, & Biddlecom, 1994). Consequently, immigrants
may be less likely or able than native-born individuals to
seek assistance, because they either lack health insurance
(R. J. Angel & Angel, 1996) or have no lay or professional
referral networks available. Nevertheless, few studies have
focused on the interaction between nativity, duration, and
race/Hispanic ethnicity as it affects health.
Immigrants, on average, report fewer financial resources,
including health insurance, than the native-born population,
which adversely affects their health through lowered social
class (Poston, 1994; Santiago & Muschkin, 1996; Tienda,
Jensen, & Bach, 1984; Zsembik, Drevenstedt, & McLane,
1997). Recent research has indicated that financial assets
are more important than sociocultural factors, such as nativ-
ity (Hao & Johnson, 2000). Several studies have shown that
immigrants often find themselves in lower paying, physi-
cally demanding, and dangerous occupations (Borjas &
Bronnars, 1990; Elkeles & Seifert, 1996). Specifically,
analyses of the 1985­86 National Health Interview Survey
revealed that the Mexican-origin foreign-born persons who
had fewer than 12 years of education and low family in-
comes (below $20,000) were more inclined to indicate
"fair" or "poor" health than were native-born persons (see
Loue & Bunce, 1999, for a review of the literature).
Immigrants face many challenges in their efforts to attain
economic integration. Even the racial and ethnic composi-
tion of immigrant streams affects the process of socioeco-
nomic inclusion, reinforcing health disparities (Williams &
Collins, 1995). As the proportion of Black and Hispanic im-
migrants grows, attempts to delineate the risk factors associ-
ated with nativity, independent of the risk factors associated
with race and ethnicity, become increasingly complex (Mar-
tin & Soldo, 1997). Several studies have suggested that the
process of assimilation has deleterious health consequences.
However, cultural assimilation differs depending on the na-
ture of the socioeconomic experience in the nation of origin
(Rumbaut, 1997). Migrants into the United States are favor-
ably selected from their origin populations (Lindstrom,
1994; Massey, 1994). Immigrants are positively selected for
young age, good general health, and high social capital
(Hummer et al., 1999; Smith & Edmonston, 1997; Tienda,
Jensen, & Bach, 1984). Positive selectivity explains find-
ings in which immigrants display health and economic ad-
vantages when compared with U.S. native-born individuals.
Cultural Assimilation or Cumulative Disadvantage?
Traditional views of immigrant assimilation into U.S. so-
ciety primarily focus on the process of linguistic and social
adaptation (Schlesinger, 1992). Relying upon the experi-
ence of the early 1900s, a period of high immigration from
Europe into the United States, such frameworks focus on
immigrants who are socially and linguistically diverse but
racially homogenous. Predicated on the assumptions that
the chief barrier to assimilation is linguistic and that over
time linguistic and cultural barriers between immigrants and
native-born persons will dissipate, these viewpoints suggest
that higher levels of integration are positively correlated
with time spent in the United States. Assimilation theory
suggests that differences in self-reported health between na-
tive- and foreign-born persons are functions of duration of
residence, that is, immigrants with long tenure in the United
States have health profiles indistinguishable from those of
native-born persons (Amaro, Whitaker, Coffman, & Heeren,
1990; Rogers, 1991; Samet, Schraag, Howard, Key, &
Pathak, 1982; Vega et al., 1998; Wei, Valdez, Mitchell,
Haffner, Stern, & Hazuda, 1996). Numerous studies have
interpreted the positive correlation between length of resi-
dence and socioeconomic incorporation as evidence to sup-
port the assimilation hypothesis (cf. Bean, Berg, & Van
Hook, 1996; Zsembik et al., 1997).
However, time spent in the United States has complex
and not always positive health consequences. Immigrants,
because of positive selectivity, initially demonstrate favor-
able health behaviors (Findley, 1988). Even if immigrants
engage in risky lifestyles and unhealthy behaviors, such as
cigarette smoking and excessive alcohol use, they may be
protected by the salubrious effects of a culture of origin that
reduces the risks associated with such behaviors (Finch,
Boardman, Kolody, & Vega, 2000; Rogers, 1991; Vega et
al., 1998). These countervailing forces of assimilation (neg-
ative) and selectivity (positive) take place in the context of
socioeconomic disadvantage (Elkeles & Seifert, 1996; San-
tiago & Muschkin, 1996).
Cumulative disadvantage, a perspective guided by con-
NATIVITY, ETHNICITY, AND HEALTH S277
flict theory, provides an alternative interpretation to the
health benefits of assimilation (Dowd & Bengtson, 1978).
This perspective focuses on persistent barriers to immigrant
adaptation. Immigrants are unlikely to lose their disadvan-
taged social or economic status. The negative effects of this
marginalization are cumulative and are likely to increase
with duration. Simply put, duration of residence correlates
not with increased integration but with exposure to the
detrimental effects of social and economic disadvantage.
The cumulative disadvantage and cultural assimilation ap-
proaches both emphasize economic factors, such as income,
education, and employment. These variables, often associ-
ated with membership in the lower classes, increase the risk
of poor health.
Related theoretical approaches concerning immigrant ad-
aptation focus on social capital (Portes, 1995), a widely ob-
served explanatory variable in personal health and well-being.
Some immigrants develop additional networks with in-
creased duration; for others, the process of acculturation is
assisted by social networks at the place of destination. Im-
migration disrupts access to location-specific ties and may
diminish access to formal and informal means of support in
the country of origin. Research has shown the ability of im-
migrants to develop new networks at their points of destina-
tion and the positive influence such networks have on health
and well-being (J. L. Angel & Angel, 1992; Portes & Rum-
baut, 1990). Studies on family reliance have underscored
the importance of age at migration, because elderly Mexi-
can immigrants arriving during childhood are less depen-
dent on their families than those immigrating in later life
(R. J. Angel, Angel, Lee, & Markides, 1999). This indicates
that although some forms of social capital may be positively
influenced by duration of residence, reliance on other forms
(such as kin networks) may be negatively influenced by du-
ration of residence.
Guided by these two perspectives, we considered a set of
three interrelated hypotheses:
1. Hypothesis 1: Immigrants approaching retirement tend
to display worse physical and emotional health than na-
tive-born individuals.
2. Hypothesis 2: Increased duration of residence mitigates
the negative effect of nativity on health.
3. Hypothesis 3: The ability of duration of residence to mit-
igate the immigrant disadvantage in health varies among
immigrants, with Blacks and Hispanics benefiting less
from increased duration than non-Hispanic Whites.
METHODS
Data were drawn from Waves 1 and 2 of the HRS. This
study, funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA),
contains longitudinal socioeconomic and health information
from a nationwide sample of Americans born between 1931
and 1941 and their spouses (Heeringa & Connor, 1995). Of
the entire population contacted through the HRS (N 
13,142), 12,652 completed Wave 1 interviews. Selective at-
trition between Waves 1 and 2 are as follows: (a) 231 de-
ceased; (b) 136 aged into the Assets and Health Dynamics
Survey (AHEAD); and (c) 689 lost to follow-up. Our analy-
ses included respondents who participated in Waves 1 and
2, yielding 11,596 valid observations. We restricted our
sample to 9,912 native-born and 1,031 foreign-born men
and women. For cell size consideration, we expanded the
category of individuals approaching retirement to include
168 spouses between the ages of 42 and 50. Although this
detracted from the nationally representative nature of the
HRS sample (because spouses are not randomly selected), it
enabled stronger comparative analyses of native- and for-
eign-born persons by race and ethnicity, which was the
chief focus of this study.
Measures
We viewed nativity not as a dichotomous status but rather
as a characteristic that affects the ways in which individuals
interact with social institutions. Previous research has indi-
cated that duration of residence often mitigates the influ-
ence of nativity for individuals. With increased duration of
residence, foreign-born individuals increase their opportuni-
ties to assimilate into American society. They are able to de-
velop coping strategies that improve their ability to interact
with social institutions, although such strategies are system-
atically tied to social location, cultural distance, and eco-
nomic position (Alba & Nee, 1997). The analyses divide
immigrants into three life course stages of migration for the-
oretical and statistical motivations. Life course stage of mi-
gration is likely to influence the relative economic welfare
of elderly immigrants (Zsembik et al., 1997). Late-life mi-
grants are more dependent upon family than are native-born
persons or those immigrating earlier in life and are less
likely to have private pensions and social security retire-
ment income (R. J. Angel et al., 1999). In our analyses, the
first life course stage of migration included respondents
who arrived in the United States prior to age 15 (childhood);
they may have an economic profile that resembles that of
native-born persons. The second stage included those who
arrived in the United States between ages 15 and 34 (young
adulthood); they have ample opportunity for economic inte-
gration. The third stage included individuals who arrived in
the United States at or after age 35 (mature adulthood); they
have less opportunity for social and economic assimilation.
In the statistical models, we relied on these age at migra-
tion categories. Supplemental analyses were conducted with
age at migration as a continuous variable and measured as
the proportion of life spent in the United States. Both mea-
sures yielded similar results across the independent vari-
ables. We believe the categorical approach best reflects the
nonlinear nature of the relationship between duration and
health. As mentioned earlier, the age structure of the sample
was relatively homogenous, with the vast majority of re-
spondents approximately 55 years old. Because of the trun-
cated age structure of the sample, life course stage of migra-
tion and duration of residence were functionally equivalent.
We measured socioeconomic status in three ways: eco-
nomic status, education, and employment disruption. In-
come reflected the financial resources of the respondent at
Time 1; the analyses compared individuals earning less than
$20,000 annually to those earning more than $20,000. Fi-
nancial assets reflected accumulated savings. We compared
individuals in the bottom third of reported nonhousing as-
sets (less than $10,075) to those in higher terciles. Similar
S278 ANGEL ET AL.
relative measures of economic status have been used in
other analyses of HRS data (Kington & Smith, 1997). Home
ownership was the third measure of economic status, repre-
senting the most common form of equity in the United
States. Individuals not owning a home were compared to
those who owned their home, regardless of mortgage status.
Response rates for each of the economic measures were in-
complete, and as a result, we included dummy variables in-
dicating missing data to preserve sample size.
Low education, a proximate risk factor for poor health,
was coded as a binary variable. Respondents without a high
school diploma or General Equivalency Diploma (GED)
were compared with those with at least a high school di-
ploma or GED (reference category).
Our measure of employment status focused on individu-
als who indicated they were unemployed, looking for work,
or laid off at Time 1 of the study. Individuals reporting any
of these employment difficulties were compared with those
who were gainfully employed or who were not identified as
seeking employment at Time 1.
Social connectedness measured the quality of the respon-
dent's perceived community integration at Time 1. Social
isolation was measured by reported familiarity with neigh-
bors, who reflect a potential source of informal support and
social integration. Here, as in measures of economic status,
response rates necessitated the inclusion of a dummy vari-
able for missing data for us to preserve sample size.
The demographic variables included age (measured con-
tinuously), gender, and marital status (unmarried). We cre-
ated two dummy variables indicating whether the respon-
dent was African American or Hispanic. To clarify the
direction of the relationship, we focused on independent
variables measured at Time 1 to predict health status re-
ported at Time 2.
Criterion Variables
Personal health, the dependent variable, is a complex and
multifaceted concept (R. J. Angel & Williams, 2000). Self-
assessed health generally reflects an individual's percep-
tions of his or her physical and emotional state, providing a
global indicator of well-being. Self-assessed health reports
do not always coincide with clinical evaluations (Maddox,
1962), but they are exceptionally robust in predicting mor-
tality (Idler & Benyamini, 1997), disability (Ferraro, Farmer,
& Wybraniec, 1997), expectations for health services (Wolin-
sky & Tierney, 1998), and psychological well-being (Buck-
ley, 1998).
Investigations of self-reported health across racial and
ethnic groups are complicated by the possibility of different
conceptions of subjective well-being (Johnson & Wolin-
sky, 1994; Jylha, Guralnik, Ferrucci, Jokela, & Heikkinen,
1998). Limited research has suggested that potential racial/
ethnic differences exist in the assessment of health (R. J.
Angel & Williams, 2000), potentially contributing to ob-
served group differentials in self-rated health (Williams &
Collins, 1995). However, similar predictors of self-reported
health status (socioeconomic status, marital status, etc.) op-
erate consistently across groups (Lillie-Blanton & Laveist,
1996). In meta-analyses, self-assessments of health (how-
ever conceptualized) were just as predictive of mortality for
racial/ethnic minorities as for non-Hispanic Whites (Idler &
Benyamini, 1997), a finding supported by McGee, Liao,
Cao, and Cooper (1999). Even though actors may perceive
their health differently, poor self-assessed health generates
adverse health outcomes consistently across groups, making
the identification of health risk factors, such as nativity, im-
portant.
In the HRS, two questions asked respondents to rate their
general physical and emotional health: first, "Would you
say your health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?"
and second, "How good do you feel or how stressed, anx-
ious, or depressed do you feel now?" As has been suggested
in previous investigations of immigrant health, we em-
ployed a dichotomous measure of self-rated health. Persons
reporting either fair or poor health were coded 1, and if they
identified themselves to be in excellent, very good, or good
health (reference category) they were coded 0. Respondents
reporting either fair or poor emotional health (i.e., emo-
tional distress) were coded 1 and were coded 0 if otherwise
(excellent, very good, or good health). Although the full ar-
ray of response categories facilitates a wider distribution of
responses, there is no reason to assume that the conceptual
distance between categories is equal (i.e., the data are ordi-
nal, not continuous). The response categories of fair and
poor represent mortality risks that are substantially higher
than those of any other response (Idler & Benyamini, 1997).
In our analyses, therefore, we employed logistic models to
determine proximate risk factors for poor physical and emo-
tional health (see J. L. Angel, Buckley, & Finch, in press;
Hendershot, 1988).
Besides using universal self-assessments of health, we
captured overall physical functioning by employing a modi-
fied version of the Katz, Ford, Moskowitz, Jackson, and
Joffe (1963) basic activities of daily living (ADL) summary
index. This measure, although less prevalent in our study
group, provides an excellent indicator of impaired daily
functioning. Respondents are asked to report any difficulty
in performing five basic activities of daily living, that is,
bathing, dressing, eating, walking across a room, and get-
ting in and out of bed. Because we employed binomial lo-
gistic regressions, we partitioned this variable into two cate-
gories: 1  "at least some ADL disability" and 0  "no
ADL difficulty."
The relationship between resources and self-rated physi-
cal and emotional health is complex. Are the poor more
likely to suffer ill health or are those in ill health more likely
to be poor? It is difficult to disentangle the specific effects
of wealth on health because of the effect of health on
wealth. In our analyses we used the panel aspect of our data
to minimize the endogeneity problem. The dependent vari-
ables for our models were measured at Wave 2 (1995),
whereas independent variables were either ascribed (i.e.,
gender, age, race) or measured at Wave 1 (1992). Measures
obtained in 1995 cannot go backward in time to affect mea-
sures that were obtained in 1992; therefore, the estimates of
the parameters were less affected by endogeneity bias be-
cause of the time ordering of our data (Davis, 1985). We did
not generalize about the total mutual, reciprocal effects
across the entire life course between health and socioeco-
nomic conditions but rather limited the analysis to isolating
NATIVITY, ETHNICITY, AND HEALTH S279
the net effects of particular independent variables on these
specific dependent variables for persons at this stage of the
life course.
RESULTS
Table 1 presents summary descriptive statistics and sam-
ple means for the independent variables used in the multi-
variate analyses. Each indicator was measured at baseline
and reflected one of three life domains: demographic struc-
ture, economic position, or social integration. These explan-
atory variables spanned a broad range of factors previous
investigators have clearly shown to be related to social con-
structions (self-rated) of health, either directly or indirectly
(R. J. Angel & Williams, 2000).
The data in Table 1 compare immigrants with native-born
persons and indicate that immigrants tended to be Hispanic
(52.9% vs 4.6%), reported low household income (50.8% vs
41.6%), had low nonhousing assets (28.9% vs 19%), and
were more likely to not own their home (65.4% vs 58.1%).
Immigrants had markedly lower levels of education (45.4%
vs 25.6%) and were also more likely than native-born indi-
viduals to have been laid off or unemployed (8.3% vs 4.7%)
at Wave 1. The immigrants' health disadvantage, in part, re-
flected their disadvantaged social class. Immigrants were
slightly more likely to have data missing on home owner-
ship, employment problems, and nonhousing assets but
were more likely to report data on the social isolation vari-
able.
Table 2 contrasts the native-born to foreign-born men and
women on five health measures. A profile of poor health
among foreign-born persons emerges. Foreign-born men
and women reported worse physical health and lower levels
of emotional well-being. Because of the age structure of the
population, only a small percentage of the sample had prob-
lems carrying out ADLs, but more of those who had diffi-
culties were immigrants. Overall, these data reveal that
compared with native-born men and women, foreign-born
men and women had worse health in 1995, consistent with
other studies assessing nativity differences in various health
outcomes (R. J. Angel & Angel, 1996; Santiago & Musch-
kin, 1996) and supporting our first hypothesis.
We examined the heterogeneity of the immigrant popula-
tion in terms of age at migration (Table 3) using the percent-
age distribution of racial and ethnic characteristics in the
immigrant subsample by age at migration. A large percent-
age of European immigrants (non-Hispanic Whites) moved
to the United States during childhood and early adulthood
(86.6%). Two-thirds of the Hispanics immigrated to the
United States early in the life course (prior to turning 35
years old). Conversely, more than half of other ethnic
groups identified in the HRS sample (i.e., Blacks, Asians/
other races) came to the United States after age 35.
The next step in our analysis was to contrast the health of
native-born respondents to those who immigrated in child-

hood, early adulthood, and midlife (Table 3). We calculated
a chi-square test for the gradient in proportions using the
formula given by Fleiss (1993, p. 148). For each of the three
variables shown in Table 4, the chi-square test results sup-
ported the hypothesis that the population proportions are or-
dered across the four categories of age at immigration, indi-
cating the degree of exposure to American society (i.e.,
native born, 0­14 years, 15­34 years, and 35 or more
years). The null hypothesis that the population proportions
are all equal across the four categories was rejected. In each
case, the test statistic was greater than the critical value at
the .05 level of statistical significance.
Table 4 displays the proportion reporting compromised
ADL function, poor physical health, and emotional distress
by estimated duration of residence. There was a monotonic
increase in poor health with duration. This linear pattern
was statistically significant. Rank ordering respondents
from native-born persons, early migrants, young adult mi-
grants, and late-life migrants, we found a compelling nega-
tive association between time spent in the United States and
poor health. Late-life immigrants were in worse health
when compared with native-born persons (37.8% vs 22.7%,
respectively), individuals who moved to the United States at
a younger age (26.4%), and those who moved in early adult-
hood (31.3%). A similar pattern was revealed for those late-
life immigrants reporting emotional distress, supporting our
second hypothesis.
Table 5 presents logistic regression results identifying the
net effect of socioeconomic predictors on health and daily
functioning. Each of the dependent variables (ADL limita-
tion, poor self-rated health, and emotional distress) was ana-
lyzed in a two-step process. Model 1 included age at mi-
gration and exogenous variables, with Model 2 adding
indicators of socioeconomic status and social integration.
The results show that age at migration affected each of the
three health outcomes; however, the effect declined dramat-
ically when we controlled for socioeconomic factors. In pre-
dicting ADL limitations, immigrants exhibited a higher risk
of disability regardless of life course stage of migration.
Childhood immigrants, young adult immigrants, and mid-
life immigrants were each significantly more likely than na-
tive-born individuals to report ADL disability, 86%, 64%,
and 99%, respectively. In terms of self-assessed health, a
similar pattern was revealed in Model 1, but the relative risk
was much stronger for young adult and midlife migrants,
with midlife migrants more than twice as likely to report
poor health than others. However, in Model 2, the effect of
migration disappeared. The results for emotional distress
were more consistent across Models 1 and 2. In both mod-
els, childhood migrants were statistically indistinguishable
from native-born persons. The effect of duration of resi-
dence was further shown by the higher risk associated with
midlife migration when compared with young adult migra-
tion. Midlife migrants were nearly three times more likely
to report emotional distress in Model 1 and nearly two times
more likely to report emotional distress in Model 2. Results
for emotional distress supported our second hypothesis be-
cause migrants with longer duration of residence exhibited
lower risk of poor health.
Our initial demographic measures, age, gender, and mari-
tal status, displayed consistent results across both models.
Interestingly, women were only at a statistically significant
risk for emotional distress, but only when we did not control
for socioeconomic variables. Gender did not influence the
relative risk for compromised ADLs or poor self-rated
health. Age exhibited an effect across our three dependent
variables and across Models 1 and 2. The odds ratios were
modest, but we note that age was measured continuously,
and therefore the cumulative effect may be substantial. Con-
trary to its effect on physical health, age decreased the risk
for emotional distress. The risk of being in poor health out-
side a marital union was substantial for all three dependent
variables in Model 1, with the nonmarried nearly twice as
likely to report ADL limitation, poor self-assessed health,
and emotional distress, respectively (odds ratio [OR] 2.18,
2.02, and 1.91). The nonmarriage effect declined markedly
when we controlled for socioeconomic indicators but re-
mained significant (OR 1.45, 1.38, and 1.32, respectively).
As expected, sociocultural variables substantially influ-
enced health. As noted previously, the addition of these
variables erased the effect of immigration for physical
health indicators. Two of our three measures of financial
wealth, low income and few assets, increased the log odds of
a respondent's reporting poor physical and emotional health.
The interpretation of these variables was complicated by
their highly correlated dummies for missing information.
Employment problems at Wave 1 increased the risk of poor
health assessments at Wave 2 but were not associated with
ADL limitation. This finding indicates that employment dif-
ficulties were not associated with objective physical limita-
tions. Last, social isolation, measured as unfamiliarity with
neighbors, exhibited a modest but consistent effect on health
across the three dependent variables. Socially isolated indi-
viduals were 30% more likely to have compromised ADLs,

15% more likely to report worse general health, and 17%
more likely to report emotional distress.
The observed disadvantage of being foreign born ap-
peared to be erased when socioeconomic characteristics
were controlled. Immigration generally, and duration of res-
idence specifically, did not appear to affect physical indica-
tors of health. However, our expectations concerning immi-
grant risk and the importance of duration were borne out
in the results on emotional distress. Midlife immigrants
reported substantially higher risk for emotional distress
(84%), whereas young adult migrants faced a moderate risk
(37%). Childhood immigrants, those with the longest dura-
tion of residence, resembled native-born individuals. The
composition of immigrants by race and Hispanic ethnicity
varied dramatically by age at migration. To further specify
our findings on duration, we next performed analyses in-
cluding race and ethnicity to address our third hypothesis.
Although the initial multivariate logistic regressions as-
sessed the impact of duration on health (physical and emo-
tional) and ADL disability after social resources were con-
trolled, they did not account for race. In the next analyses
(Table 6), we included terms for race (Black) and Hispanic
ethnicity and in the final stage tested interaction terms for
race and duration. In Model 1, it was clear that Black and
Hispanic respondents faced a statistically higher risk of
poor physical and emotional health, yet the inclusion of race
and Hispanic ethnicity did not substantively alter the results
in the previous table. Black respondents were 67% more
likely to report compromised ADLs, 63% more likely to re-
port poor self-rated health, and 23% more likely to report
emotional distress than non-Hispanic Whites. Hispanics
faced even higher health risks (74%, 113%, and 88%, re-
spectively).
To directly address our third hypothesis on the variation
of duration among immigrants, we added interaction effects
for midlife Black and Hispanic immigrants in Model 2. The
interaction effects were telling. Blacks coming to the United
States in midlife (with low duration of residence) were less
likely than native-born Blacks or longer term immigrants to
report poor physical and emotional health. The inclusion of
the interaction effects did not change the health risks associ-
ated with the rest of the model.
The models in Table 6 suggest a complicated picture.
Blacks and Hispanics were at significantly higher risk for
poor health than non-Hispanic Whites, with the exception of
recent Black immigrants. Models not including race may
conclude that the emotional health disadvantage for immi-
grants diminishes with increased duration, but this may not
be the case. Increased duration of residence may enable im-
migrants to acquire the socioeconomic rewards indicative of
native-born persons, explaining why the inclusion of socio-
economic indicators washes out the predictive values of age
at migration. At the same time, in comparison with native-
born persons, minority immigrants facing the disadvantages
associated with being Black in the United States may find
the barrier of race makes it more difficult to overcome the
status of being an immigrant.
DISCUSSION
This study highlights the complex interplay of nativity,
duration of residence, and race/ethnicity on health profiles.
The results are as anticipated in the first hypothesis; immi-
grants face a self-assessed health disadvantage. Nativity is a
proximate risk factor for ADL disability, poor physical
health, and emotional distress, but the effect largely oper-
ates through socioeconomic characteristics.

Our findings provide limited support for our second re-
search hypothesis, countering arguments that assimilation
into American society adversely affects health (Findley,
1988; Vega et al., 1998). We find a monotonic increase in the
proportion of immigrants reporting ADL disability and poor
physical and emotional health as a function of lower duration
of residence. Respondents immigrating early in life resemble
native-born individuals, whereas individuals immigrating in
young adulthood or midlife are significantly different. This
may be a result of lower health care access in their country of
origin than that for child immigrants and native-born persons.
Our third hypothesis is not strongly supported. It is clear
that in the United States, analyses of duration should take
into account the changing racial/ethnic composition of im-
migrants. The dramatic racial differences among immi-
grants across time may preclude a clear delineation of the
effects of duration. Race complicates the effects of duration
on emotional health. It may be the case that the adverse ef-
fects of race/ethnicity lessen the positive effects of assimila-
tion and integration associated with increased duration of
residence. Across our models, Blacks and Hispanics (both
native and foreign born) face a significant self-assessed
health disadvantage. Only further empirical analyses into
the relationship between duration as it relates to race and
Hispanic ethnicity will clarify these patterns.
Although intriguing, these results are preliminary. Two
major avenues for further work examining the salience of
nativity on health emerge. First, as data allow, investigators
should pursue more sophisticated longitudinal modeling
opportunities to assess the dynamic determinants of health
across time for aging non-Hispanic Whites, Blacks, and
Hispanics. Second, additional research should focus on the
precise delineation of issues such as economic assimilation
and social and family support, and on detailed analyses of
anticipated and actual monetary and nonmonetary remit-
tances to children, siblings, and elderly parents. Access to
structural supports, such as health insurance and supple-
mental medical insurance coverage (public and private),
could be more fully developed in studies emphasizing the
confluence of nativity and ethnicity on health as individuals
near retirement. Subsequent longitudinal analyses would
also benefit from assessment of the compositional effects of
income and tests of specific wealth thresholds on health.
This will illuminate the specific mechanisms through which
income affects health and, ultimately, shed light on the en-
dogenous relationship between income and physical well-
being profiles in the years prior and subsequent to retire-
ment. Models need to also explore the utility of household-
rather than individual-based analyses.
Although our findings are only a modest step toward un-
derstanding the intricate relationship between nativity and
health dynamics, they provide strong justification for con-
tinued research along these lines. Further work should ad-
dress these issues; the impact of Hispanic subgroups and
Asian Americans on these health outcomes would be partic-
ularly informative. Consistent with the literature, and as
these analyses demonstrate, when comparing health and
well-being researchers should not assume that risk factors
for poor health, such as nativity, act uniformly across racial
and ethnic groups.
