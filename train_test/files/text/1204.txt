Abstract
Objective: Recent reports suggest persistence of health disparities related to socio-
economic position (SEP). To understand if diet may be a contributor to these trends,
we examined secular trends in the association of diet and indicators of SEP from
1971­1975 to 1999­2002.
Design: We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
(NHANES) I (1971­1975), II (1976­1980), III (1988­1994) and 1999­2002 to
examine the independent associations of poverty income ratio (PIR) and education
with diet and biomarkers of diet and disease in 25­74-year-olds (n ¼ 36 600). We
used logistic and linear regression methods to adjust for multiple covariates and
survey design to examine these associations.
Results: A large PIR differential in the likelihood of reporting a fruit or all five food
groups and vitamin C intake, and an education differential in likelihood of obesity
and carbohydrate intake, was noted in 1971­1975 but narrowed in 1999­2002
(P , 0.007). The positive association of education with intake of a fruit, vegetable or
all five food groups, vitamins A and C, calcium and potassium intake remained
unchanged across surveys (P , 0.001). Similarly, the positive association of PIR with
the amount of foods and intakes of energy and potassium remained unchanged over
three decades (P , 0.001). The education and the PIR differential in energy density,
and the PIR differential in the likelihood of obesity, persisted over the period of the
four surveys (P , 0.001).
Conclusions: Persistence of unfavourable dietary and biomarker profiles in Americans
with low income and education suggests continued need for improvement in the
quality of diets of these high-risk groups.

Secular trends
Socio-economic status
Measures of socio-economic position (SEP) such as
education and family income have generally been shown
to relate inversely with mortality and morbidity1­4. Recent
reports suggest that the previously reported socio-
economic differential in all-cause, cardiovascular and
cancer mortality and healthy life expectancy in the USA
may be increasing over time5­9. Socio-economic disparities
in health may be attributable to income, access to quality
health care, environmental exposures, early
life environment, lifestyle, and health risk behaviours
including diet10­12.
Dietary factors contribute substantially to the burden of
preventable illnesses and premature deaths in the USA.
Diet is a health risk behaviour which has been shown to
relate to three of the leading causes of death in the USA
(coronary heart disease, certain cancers and stroke)1.
Diet also plays a major role in the development and
management of morbidities such as obesity, diabetes,
hypertension and osteoporosis1,13. Although it is generally
believed that in affluent societies higher SEP may be
associated with healthier dietary profiles, surprisingly little
has been published on changes in the association of SEP
and attributes of diet quality over time in the US
population. To understand whether diet may be one of
the explanatory variables for persistence of SEP disparity
in health, we examined secular trends in the independent
associations of two measures of SEP ­ education and
income ­ with self-reported dietary attributes and
biomarkers in the US population.

Materials and methods
We used data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Surveys (NHANES) I (1971­1975), II (1976­
1980), III (1988­1994) and 1999­2002, conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention14. The NHANES I, II
and III were multi-year surveys; beginning in 1999, the
NHANES became a continuous annual survey and these
data are being released for two years at a time. The sample
design for each survey is a stratified, multistage, national
probability sample of the USA. NHANES I and II sampled
subjects aged 1 to 74 years; NHANES III sampled ages 2
months and older; and NHANES 1999­2002 included all
ages. The survey procedures consisted of a household
interview of the sample person conducted by a trained
interviewer and a health examination in the mobile
examination centre (MEC). Weight and height measure-
ments, interview to collect a 24-hour dietary recall, and
blood and urine specimens were obtained in the MEC.
Survey response rates for examined (MEC) individuals for
NHANES I, II, III and 1999­2000 were 74, 73, 78 and 76%,
respectively14.
Information on measures of SEP
Education
Each NHANES collected information on the highest grade
of education completed by the survey respondent. Ease of
measurement, applicability to people not in the labour
force, stability over adult lifespan and the fact that health
status (or diet) does not influence level of education make
it a powerful and widely used indicator of SEP in US public
health research15,16. Due to unavailability of more detailed
education information in the NHANES 1999­2002 public
release dataset, in this study we operationalised the level
of education as ,12, 12 and .12 years.
Poverty income ratio
For each NHANES, the NCHS has computed a poverty
income ratio (PIR) based on the survey-year-specific
poverty threshold from the US Census Bureau14. The PIR is
a ratio of total family income to the poverty threshold for a
family of given characteristics specific to each survey. A PIR
of ,1 suggests that income is below the poverty level.
Although not without limitations, the PIR is a normative
construct as it assesses income in relation to need adjusting
for inflation. Various authors have argued that examining
PIR as just below or above poverty provides little
information about the relationship of income gradient
with health15,16. Therefore, we operationalised the PIR
variable as ,1.0, 1.0­1.99, 2.0­2.99, 3.0­3.99 and $4.0.
Dietary methods
All the NHANES collected dietary information using a 24-
hour dietary recall administered by a trained dietary
interviewer in the MEC14. Beginning with NHANES III,
trained dietary interviewers administered the 24-hour
recall using an automated, interactive format with built-in
probes to improve the quality of the recalls obtained. The
dietary recalls collected for the NHANES 1999­2000 and
2001 survey years used a computer-assisted dietary
interview which included a four-step multiple-pass
approach14. In NHANES 2002, the dietary data were
collected using a multiple-pass approach with dietary
recall methods that are part of the integrated US
Department of Agriculture and NHANES `What We Eat in
America' protocol14.
Dietary outcome variables
To obtain a comprehensive picture of secular changes in
diet and SEP associations, we examined two types of
dietary attribute in this study. The first group may be
considered to relate with reported quantity of food which in
turn may relate with energy intake and body weight, and
included total amount of reported foods and beverages,
energy content and energy density of the reported diet.
These variables are especially pertinent given recent
reports suggesting that the portion sizes consumed by
Americans have increased over the period of surveys
examined in this study17. The energy density of diets is
receiving considerable attention as a correlate of energy
intake and body weight18 ­22, and is also believed to have
changed over the past three decades. There is no consensus
on how energy density should be defined19 ­21. The
association of different energy density measures with
nutrient profiles and body weight varies depending on how
this variable is defined19 ­21. For example, the association of
energy and nutrient intake with energy density variables
that included beverages was not as strong as with energy
density variables derived from solid foods21, possibly due
to a different physiological mechanism of regulation of
beverage intake as suggested by Rolls et al.22. Therefore, in
the present study, we assessed dietary energy density (kcal
per g) of all foods and nutritive beverages (i.e. milk and
100% juices, but excluding all alcoholic and non-alcoholic
energy-yielding or non-energy-yielding beverages ­ e.g.
coffee, tea, sodas, juice drinks).
The second group of dietary variables included
foods/nutrients potentially related to health. Many
nutrients with known associations with health ­ vitamin
E, folate, dietary fibre and carotenoids ­ were not
available for all surveys; therefore the nutrients examined
were limited to those available in all surveys, and included
intakes of fat and saturated fat, carbohydrate, and the
micronutrients vitamins C and A, calcium and potassium.
Whether respondents mentioned any food from the fruit
or vegetable group (as defined below) and a summary
measure of overall diet quality ­ dietary diversity score
(DDS)23 ­ were also examined. The DDS, a relatively
simple measure of diet quality, was shown to relate with
mortality in the NHANES I epidemiologic follow-up study

cohort24 and with biomarkers in NHANES III25. The DDS
considers whether or not a food from each of the five
major food groups (fruit, vegetable, dairy, meat/alterna-
tive, and grain) was mentioned in the recall23. To compute
the DDS, foods reported in each survey were grouped into
one or more of the major food groups using methods
described previously23. The fruit group included all fresh,
frozen or canned fruits and 100% juices, but excluded fruit
drinks and fruit desserts such as fruit pies. The vegetable
group included all raw, canned and frozen vegetables and
juices. The grain group included all cereals, breads, pasta,
rice, etc., but excluded pastries, cookies, cakes and pies.
The meat group included eggs, meat, poultry, fish and
alternatives such as beans, nuts and seeds. The dairy
group included milk, yoghurt and cheese but excluded ice
cream and other dairy desserts. Foods in mixed dishes
were grouped into all the constituent food groups.
As an estimate of possible low energy reporting, a ratio of
reported energy intake (EI) to basal energy expenditure
(BEE) was also computed. The BEE was estimated using
age-, sex- and weight-specific equations developed by the
Dietary Reference Intakes committee26. We used an EI/BEE
ratio of ,1.2 to suggest low energy reporting in this study.
Biomarkers
We also examined trends in the association of SEP with
three biomarkers: body mass index (BMI), serum total
cholesterol (TC) and serum high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL-C). Serum HDL-C was not available for
NHANES I; these analyses included data from the latter
three surveys.
Analytic sample
For each of the four surveys, all non-pregnant, non-
lactating respondents aged 25­74 years, with a 24-hour
dietary recall (considered reliable by the NCHS) and with
information on PIR and education were included in the
analytic sample. The lower age cut-off of 25 years was
chosen because post-school education is usually com-
pleted by this age; the upper age cut-off of 74 years was
necessary because NHANES I and II did not include
respondents older than 74 years. The total sample size for
the four surveys was 36 600 (NHANES I ¼ 10 065; NHANES
II ¼ 9659; NHANES III ¼ 11 002; NHANES 1999­
2002 ¼ 5874).
Analytical methods
We used linear or logistic multiple regression models to
assess the independent association of education and PIR
with dietary and biomarker outcomes. Because of
differences in the distribution of a number of factors that
may be associated with reporting of food intake among
surveys, the regression models included gender, age, age2,
race (white, black, other), PIR (,1.0, 1.0­1.99, 2.0­2.99,
3.0­3.99, $4.0), years of education (,12, 12, .12) and
survey (NHANES I, NHANES II, NHANES III, NHANES
1999­2002) as independent variables with each dietary
attribute or biomarker as a continuous or binary outcome.
Regression models for predicting changes in the SEP­
biomarker associations also included smoking status,
alcohol use status and leisure-time physical activity as
covariates. The race/ethnicity categories available in
NHANES 1999­2002 differ markedly from race categories
in earlier surveys. NHANES I and II provide only white,
black and other categories. NHANES III provides both
race- and ethnicity-specific categories. However, NHANES
1999­2002 provides only ethnicity-specific categories
(non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic black, Mexican
American, Other Hispanic and All other). Therefore, we
categorised race as white, black and other as available in
NHANES I, II and III. For NHANES 1999­2002, we
grouped Mexican-Americans and other Hispanics with
non-Hispanic whites. These methods are similar to those
used by others27. To assess whether the association of
education or PIR with dietary attributes differed among the
four surveys, all models included two interaction terms:
PIR by survey and education by survey. If the interaction
term(s) was not significant, we examined the main effects
of education and PIR after exclusion of the interaction
term(s), across all surveys combined. A backwards
stepwise regression with an exclusion criterion of
P . 0.01 for the interaction was used to determine
which interactions remained in the model. The mean
estimates presented in the tables and figures are predictive
margins obtained from fully adjusted regression models28.
In tests for trend and interaction, survey, education and
PIR were modelled as continuous variables.
Because we combined the data from four surveys for
these analyses, our approach was to treat the data from the
four different surveys as independent samples from
different populations. Therefore, we weighted the data
in our analyses using the NCHS-assigned survey-specific
sample weights so as to produce estimates that
represented each population29. All statistical analyses
were adjusted for the sample weights and complex sample
design of the four national surveys by using SAS callable
SUDAAN, version 9.030. All P-values were two-sided.
Given the multiple tests of association done in this study
and the large sample size, we chose a conservative
criterion of P , 0.01 for finding statistical significance.
Although we present all results, the discussion is limited to
variables where the level of significance was P , 0.01.
Results
The percentage of those with ,12 years of education
decreased while the percentage with .12 years increased
during this period (Table 1). The percentage of the
population below a PIR of 1 and above a PIR of 4
increased from 1971­1975 to 1999­2002 (Table 1). Across
all surveys combined, a higher proportion of those in
lower PIR categories were female, non-white, aged 25­39

years and with ,12 years of education. Respondents with
,12 years of education were similarly more likely to be
non-white and in low PIR categories, but were more likely
to be aged 60­74 years (data not shown; available from
the authors on request).
Secular trends from 1971­1975 to 1999­2002 in the
various outcomes examined are presented in Table 2.
The percentage of the population with BMI . 30
kg m22, the covariate-adjusted means of serum HDL-C
concentration, reported amount of all foods and
beverages, energy density, and intakes of energy and
carbohydrate increased across surveys. However, the
adjusted means of serum TC concentration, total fat,
saturated fat, and the percentage reporting a DDS of 5
or a fruit in the recall declined from 1971­1975 to
1999­2002.

Interactions of PIR and education with survey
The interaction of education with survey was significant
for carbohydrate intake (P , 0.001) and likelihood of
obesity (P ¼ 0.007) (Fig. 1), suggesting a change in the
association of these variables with education across
surveys. Both of these variables were inversely
associated with education in earlier surveys, but not
the later surveys. The interaction of PIR with survey
(P , 0.001) was noted for the percentage reporting a
fruit or a DDS of 5, and energy-adjusted amount of
vitamin C (Fig. 2). In NHANES I and II, increasing PIR
was associated with higher percentage reporting a fruit
or all five food groups, and higher intake of vitamin C;
however, these PIR-related differences diminished or
disappeared in later surveys. The PIR by survey
interaction was also significant for serum TC
(P ¼ 0.001). Serum TC and PIR were positively
associated in NHANES II (P , 0.00 001); in all other
surveys, this association was not significant. (Table 4
provides only the main effect for this variable.) For all
other variables examined in this study, the interaction
terms were not significant (P . 0.01).
Main effects of education and PIR
Tables 3 and 4 present main effects only for those
variables where an interaction was not significant
(P . 0.01). Across all surveys combined, after adjust-
ment for PIR and or its interaction with survey year,
increasing education level was associated (P , 0.001)

Discussion
The data presented reveal that SEP differentials in self-
reported dietary attributes and biomarkers examined in this
study did not increase in the US population from 1971 to
2002. However, SEP differentials in most examined
outcomes persisted over three decades. Diminished SEP
differentials were seen for only a few of the outcomes and
may reflect population-wide shifts in intake (discussed
below). Therefore, while our findings do not support
increasing SEP differential in diet quality as a contributor to
the increasing SEP differential in mortality, they do suggest
the continued importance of diet in addressing education-
and income-related disparity in health of the US population.
The education differential inthe energy-adjusted amount
of carbohydrate and the PIR differential in mention of a fruit
or all five food groups (DDS of 5) and vitamin C intake,
noted in 1971­1980, declined from 1988 to 2002. The
narrowing of the education differential in carbohydrate
intake appears to reflect a population-wide increase in the
intake of this macronutrient rather than a selective change
by the low-education group. Similarly, narrowing of the
PIR-associated gap in mention of a fruit or all five food
groups does not appear to be due to gains by respondents
in low PIR categories, but rather because of lower reporting
of these food groups by higher PIR respondents in later
surveys. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility of
SEP differences in types of carbohydrates or of foods within
each of the five food groups, as our methods were not
sensitive to these differences. For example, it is possible
that, within a food group, food selections (such as fish vs.
hamburger, fresh fruits vs. canned fruits, or whole grains vs.
refined grains) may differ by SEP categories, and their
patterns of consumption may also have changed over time.
These possible SEP differences in quality of food choices
require further study.
In our study, both measures of SEP were independent
predictors of several dietary attributes. However, relative
to PIR as operationalised in this study, not only were
education differentials present for most of the examined
dietary and biomarker outcomes, but also the magnitude
of these differentials was larger. Although total energy
intake or amount of foods reported appeared to differ little
by education, the intake of micronutrients examined in the
study (vitamins A and C, potassium and calcium), and
mention of fruits, vegetables or overall diet quality (DDS),
were lower in Americans with a lower level of education in
all surveys. This suggests that in all surveys, food
selections reported by respondents with higher education
differed from those of respondents with lower education
level. Conversely, increasing PIR was accompanied by an
increase in total amount of reported foods and energy
intake, but not all micronutrients. Education and PIR are
known to be correlated. However, the two indicators are
able to capture different dimensions of dietary behaviours,
which may explain the different associations of education
and income with the outcomes examined in this study.
While income may be related to diet by affecting
purchasing ability for foods recommended in dietary
guidance, this gap can be somewhat narrowed by food
assistance programmes. The level of education, however,
can affect not only purchasing ability, but also may be
associated with exposure to and understanding of dietary
information, which in turn may relate to motivation for
acquisition of behaviours promoted in dietary guidance.
To close the education-related gaps in dietary quality, it is
important that dietary guidance-related messages be
simple and use media that are accessible to Americans
with a lower level of education. Moreover, food assistance
programmes should include nutrition education
components.
Reports from the Nationwide Food Consumption
Survey, 1977­1978 and NHANES II, 1976­1980 found
little variation in unadjusted dietary nutrient intakes by
household income or level of education31,32; although
other reports have provided evidence of a SEP differential
in dietary intakes33 ­42. Relatively few studies, however,
have examined time trends in the association of dietary
intake with SEP43 ­46. With one exception46, most of the
published reports on time trends in SEP and diet
association have studied populations in different Euro-
pean countries43 ­45. A comparison of our results with
findings from other studies is complicated by differences
in methods of dietary assessment, time period covered in
the trend analysis, operational forms of dietary variables
and measures of SEP, and analytic methodology. Despite
these differences, the results of most of these studies43 ­ 45
are concordant with the results reported here. The lack of
an association of dietary total and saturated fat intake with
measures of SEP in our study is in accord with other such
reports from Europe43,45 and the USA46. Data from the
Dutch National Food Consumption surveys revealed
persistence of socio-economic status-related differences
in micronutrient intake in the period from 1987 to 199744.
Conversely, using food consumption data from the UK,
James et al. concluded that the socio-economic gap in
consumption of fruits, vegetables and vitamin C widened
over the 15-year span from 1980 to 199512.
We found the strong PIR differential in the likelihood of
being obese to be unchanged from 1971­1975 to 1999­
2002; however, the education-related differential nar-
rowed in 1999­2002. Zhang and Wang also examined
trends in the association of education and obesity in 20­
60-year-olds using data from NHANES I to NHANES 1999­
2000, and found that the education differential in risk of
obesity had declined in the last survey47. We observed
similar trends, although Zhang and Wang did not formally
test for the change in the association of education with
obesity across surveys, nor did they adjust for the effects of
several known correlates of body weight.
James et al.12 and Drewnowski et al.48 have argued that
in affluent nations, the diet quality of lower-income

consumers compares unfavourably with that of higher-
income consumers because diets rich in protective
nutrients cost more. In an analysis of French diets, high
sugar and fat intakes were associated with lower overall
diet cost but higher energy density41. Thus, diets with high
energy density may be consumed in association with low
SEP and may be implicated in a higher risk of obesity in
these consumers. Our results are supportive of the notion
that low-SEP consumers have diets of higher energy
density. Education and PIR were independent predictors
of dietary energy density in all four surveys.
We would like to note the following limitations of our
study. First, the methods used to collect the 24-hour
dietary recall in NHANES have changed over the course of
the four surveys14. These include a change in methods
used by dietary interviewers to administer the 24-hour
recall, and use of multiple-pass and probing to improve
the recalls. Second, the database on nutrient composition
of foods has expanded and values of many nutrients may
have changed because of improved analytical techniques
and food sampling methods49. Third, the recalls obtained
in NHANES I and II were limited to weekdays, whereas
weekend days were included in later surveys14. Because
the NCHS did not conduct any bridging studies to
determine the systematic effect of changes in dietary
methodology on food and nutrient intakes, the confound-
ing of time effect with the method effect remains a
possibility. For these reasons, we urge caution in
interpretation of secular trends across surveys presented
in Table 2. Within each survey, however, the methods
used for data collected from all respondents in all potential
exposure categories of income or education were similar.
Therefore, while these data may be of limited value in
estimating survey effect, they are valid for an examination
of changes in the association of measures of SEP with
dietary attributes in these surveys. To our knowledge,
there are no data to help us examine the possibility that
change in methodology may differentially affect those
with different PIR or education.
We also note that because Hispanics were included with
whites in the NHANES I and II public release data, we
grouped them similarly in later surveys. Because the
distribution of Hispanics in the US population has changed
over the period of these surveys, this may have biased the
results of secular trends.
Measurement error has been recognised as a problem in
all methods of assessing dietary intake, including 24-hour
recalls used in the NHANES50,51. Low energy reporting has
been noted in NHANES II and NHANES III52 ­54, and is
more likely to occur in conjunction with low income and
low level of education55. In an attempt to explore this
issue, we examined trends in the association of PIR and
education with the ratio of reported EI to calculated BEE.
Using a ratio of ,1.2 to suggest low energy reporting, the
percentage of the population reporting EI/BEE of ,1.2
decreased over time; but we found no change in the
association of PIR or education with the odds of reporting
EI/BEE , 1.2 (data not shown). Given the increasing
media focus on the association of diet with health,
however, it is possible that patterns of reporting of
`nutritionally correct' foods may have changed over time,
and the type of reporting errors also may differ by
categories of exposure variables. The EI/BEE ratios are of
little value in examining these issues, which require
further investigation. Due to the lack of repeat measure-
ment of dietary intake in all surveys, we could not
compute usual dietary intakes per recent recommen-
dations56; therefore, we did not derive estimates of
prevalence of nutrient adequacy.
In conclusion, although the income and education
differentials in self-reported food and nutrient intake did
not increase over time, the persistence of such differences
over three decades suggests continued need for improve-
ment in the quality of diets of Americans with a low
income and education.
