Background: Russia has one of the world's fastest growing HIV epidemics and it has been largely
concentrated among injection drug users (IDU). St Petersburg, Russia's second largest city, is one of
the country's regions that has been most affected by the HIV epidemic. To monitor the current epidemic
situation, we sought to estimate recent HIV incidence among IDU in St Petersburg. Methods: In a
cross-sectional study of 691 IDU recruited during 2005­08, HIV incidence was estimated by two
methods: a retrospective cohort analysis and BED capture enzyme immunoassay (EIA) results.
Socio-demographic and behavioural correlates of incident infections and spatial patterns were
examined. Results: In the retrospective cohort analysis, the incidence rate was estimated to be
14.1/100 person-years [95% confidence interval (CI) 10.7­17.6]. Using results of BED EIA and two
correction formulas for known misclassification, incidence estimates were 23.9 (95% CI 17.8­30.1) and
25.5 (95% CI 18.9­32.0) per 100 person-years. Independent correlates of being recently infected
included current unemployment (P = 0.004) and not having injected drugs in the past 30 days
(P = 0.03). HIV incident cases were detected in all but one district in the city, with focal areas of trans-
mission observed to be expanding. Conclusions: High HIV incidence among IDU in St Petersburg attests
to continued growth of the epidemic. The need for expansion of HIV prevention interventions targeted
to vulnerable populations throughout the city is urgent. These results also suggest that the BED EIA
may over-estimate incidence even after correction for low specificity.

Introduction
The Russian Federation has experienced one of the fastest
growing HIV epidemics observed anywhere in the world.1
The number of officially registered people with HIV increased
from approximately 1000 to >438 000 during the 13-year
period from 1996 to 2008.2 The current estimate of
cumulative HIV cases in Russia is 940 000 with a possible
range of 630 000­1 300 000, and the estimated adult
prevalence now exceeds 1%.3 The epidemic has been largely
concentrated among injection drug users (IDU) who comprise
85% of the cumulative number of registered AIDS cases.1
HIV prevalence among IDU now exceeds 30% in several
cities in Russia.4­6 Currently, there is the potential for a
more generalized epidemic if transmission increases outside
of high-risk core groups.4,5 With an estimated adult HIV
prevalence now exceeding 1%, this seems increasingly
plausible.3 This situation of high prevalence among core
groups and increasing prevalence throughout the general
population indicates that monitoring the future course of the
HIV epidemic in Russia is an important priority.
Estimates of HIV incidence, the number of new infections
that occur during a specified time interval, are generally more
useful in monitoring epidemic trends than prevalence, though
prevalence estimates are more readily available and thus
commonly used. We are aware of only one study of HIV
incidence in Russia, conducted in 2002­03, which recruited
and followed 520 IDU in St Petersburg in a cohort study;
the reported incidence rate was 4.5/100 person-years.7 This
relatively high incidence is supported by prevalence data
showing an increase among IDU in St Petersburg from <5%
prior to 2001 to 30% in 2003 and 50% in 2006.8­10 The
scarcity of HIV incidence estimates may be due to the
logistical and financial difficulties in following high-risk popu-
lations for long periods of time, indeed a formidable task for
vulnerable populations most affected by HIV.
In recent years, several laboratory assays for detecting
incident HIV infections in cross-sectional samples have been
developed. One such assay is the BED capture enzyme im-
munoassay (EIA).11 By assessing antibody characteristics after
seroconversion, recent infections can be distinguished from
long-standing infections. In this particular assay, the
proportion of HIV-1 specific IgG antibody in total IgG is
measured with optical density (OD) readings. When used
on specimens confirmed to be HIV positive by other tests,
low OD readings tend to be found in people with recent
infections. It has been shown that false positive results occur
frequently with the BED EIA as some long-standing-infected

individuals may have low OD readings for a variety of
reasons and are thus misclassified. This low specificity of
BED EIA produces over-estimates of HIV incidence and has
called into question the utility of this assay for HIV incidence
estimation.12,13 However, more recent work has produced
correction formulas for use with BED EIA results that
adjust estimates for misclassification due to sensitivity and
specificity characteristics of the test.14,15 It has more recent-
ly been recognized that specificity of BED EIA may also
depend on time since infection and thus can vary across
populations by place, time and age groups;16 thus collecting
data to estimate specificity in study populations may be
useful for interpreting incidence estimates derived from
BED EIA results. The use of such tests and related for-
mulas has been applied in Africa, Western Europe and
North America,17­20 but to the best of our knowledge not
in Russia.
Monitoring trends in incidence among IDU in Russia is
necessary to understand the possible future course of the
epidemic, to assess and target current prevention and care
needs, and to plan future prevention interventions including
HIV vaccine research.21 The primary objective of the present
analysis was to provide an updated estimate of HIV incidence
among IDU in St Petersburg, Russia. Our secondary objective
was to describe the epidemiology of HIV incident infections
according to socio-demographic and behavioural correlates
and spatial patterns.
Methods
Setting and study population
This cross-sectional study recruited IDU in St Petersburg,
Russia from November 2005 through December 2008 as part
of a multisite research project known as Sexual Acquisition and
Transmission of HIV Cooperative Agreement Program
(SATHCAP).22 Eligibility for inclusion in the present analysis
included reporting a history of ever injecting drugs.
Participants were recruited into the study using respondent-
driven sampling, a chain referral sampling method that uses
dual incentives and structured coupon disbursement
procedures for peer referrals. Participants provided oral
consent for participation in the study and written consent
for blood storage. All study procedures were approved by in-
stitutional review boards at all participating sites.
Data collection and laboratory procedures
Participants completed structured interviews using computer
assisted survey interviewing technology. The interview
included questions about socio-demographic factors, injection
drug use histories and risk behaviours and HIV testing histories.
Participants provided blood specimens for HIV testing using
commercially licensed ELISA kits from Genscreen HIV
1/2 (BioRad, France) and/or Vironostika HIV Uni-Form II
plus 0 (Biomerieux, The Netherlands). Non-reactive
specimens were considered to be HIV negative. Specimens
that were reactive were confirmed with western blot assays
using New Lav Blot HIV-1 (BioRad, France).
All confirmed HIV-positive specimens with sufficient re-
maining sample were tested with Calypte HIV-1 BED
Incidence EIA according to package insert instructions
(CalypteÕ Biomedical Corporation. CalypteÕ HIV-1 BED
Incidence EIA, Cat. No. 98003 March 2007); a cut-off level
for OD of 0.8 was used to classify specimens as recent
infections.
Statistical analyses
Retrospective cohort
For our primary objective, HIV incidence was estimated using
two methods. First, survey data including information about
dates and results of past HIV tests were used to construct a
retrospective cohort. To be included in this analysis, partici-
pants had to self-report that their last HIV test was negative so
that the retrospective cohort consisted of a population that was
known to be uninfected at baseline. Individuals in this group
who were confirmed HIV positive at the enrolment study visit
were considered new cases of HIV during the retrospective
follow-up period. Assuming that HIV infections occurred at
random during the follow-up period, we used the mid-point
between the date of last reported negative HIV test and date of
enrolment to calculate follow-up time. For individuals who
remained HIV negative, follow-up times were calculated as
the duration of time between the date of last reported
negative HIV test and date of enrolment. The usual formula
for incidence rates of the number of new cases divided by the
total amount of person-time of follow-up was then applied to
these data. Similar methodology has been used to estimate HIV
incidence among male drug users in northern Thailand.23
BED EIA analysis
The second method for estimating incidence used the results of
the BED EIA. To be eligible for BED EIA testing, participants
had to test HIV positive on confirmatory western blot assay per
the testing protocol. Due to increasing recognition of the
frequency with which the BED EIA misclassifies long-standing
infections as recent (high frequency of false positive
results),12,13 corrected formulas for incidence estimation have
been developed that adjust for misclassification due to sensi-
tivity and specificity characteristics of the test.14,15 Spreadsheets
that facilitate computation of corrected HIV incidence
estimates are readily available from the assay developers
(B. Parekh, personal communication). In these corrected
formulas, we used an estimated mean seroconversion interval
of 155 days in accordance with package insert guidelines. We
also estimated specificity of the BED EIA for our study
population by comparing BED EIA results with self-reported
information about long-standing infections to determine a
proportion in our sample that was misclassified. Among
those who were confirmed HIV positive at enrolment and
reported past testing, those who reported an HIV-positive
diagnosis >155 days prior but were classified as recent
according to BED EIA results were considered false positive
results.
Correlates of incident infections
To address our second aim of describing the epidemiology of
incident infections, we defined incident infections as those that
were classified as recent by both BED EIA and self-report
(i.e. not reporting an HIV-positive diagnosis >155 days
prior). We excluded individuals for whom we had conflicting
or missing HIV incident results. The primary analysis of
interest was the comparison between HIV incident cases and
participants who were HIV negative. Using logistic regression,
we examined socio-demographic characteristics and injection-
related risks as possible correlates. Socio-demographic
variables included gender, age, education, employment,
primary mode of transportation and homelessness. Injection-
related risks included duration of use, type of drug injected
(assessed in the past 6 months to capture possible variation
over time), recent use, frequency of recent use and receptive
and distributive sharing of syringes and sharing of other drug
equipment (assessed in the past 30 days to increase validity of
614 European Journal of Public Health
recall). Covariates were dichotomized at a priori meaningful
cut-points. All covariates that were associated with HIV
incidence in univariate models using the P < 0.05 criterion
were then included in a multivariate model. Manual
backward selection was used to remove covariates that were
no longer significant at P < 0.05 level to arrive at the final, most
parsimonious model.
Spatial patterns
To describe spatial patterns of HIV incidence, self-reported
metro stations closest to place of residence were aggregated
to the district level for analysis. For each district, we mapped
the proportions of participants that were HIV negative, HIV
incident and HIV prevalent. Maps were created using ArcGIS/
ArcMap 9.3.1 software (ESRI Corp, Redlands, CA, USA). Using
likelihood ratio chi-square and Fisher's exact tests, we
compared the proportion of incident cases in each district to
the proportion of incident cases in all other districts combined
(e.g. the rest of the city). For this analysis, we excluded
prevalent cases and the denominators included only HIV
incident and negative cases.
Because we used RDS for recruitment of IDU, weighting
procedures may be used in analysis to adjust for recruitment
probabilities. Using a weighting procedure that took into
account our modified RDS methodology, we found that the
weighted and unweighted proportions for sex, age and HIV
status in this sample did not differ substantially: unweighted
estimates for proportions male <25 years of age and HIV
infected were 74, 33 and 50%, respectively, compared to
weighted estimates of 75, 32 and 49%, respectively.
Therefore, we used unweighted estimates for all subsequent
analyses.
Results
A total of 691 IDU was enrolled in this study from November
2005 to December 2008. A majority of participants was male
(73%) and the median age was 29 years (range 18­53). The
median duration of injection drug use was 8 years (range
1­36), and most participants reported injecting heroin
(90%). The median number of injection drug episodes in the
past 30 days was 20 (range 1­150), and a substantial
proportion of participants reported either receptive or dis-
tributive syringe sharing in the past 30 days (31 and 30%,
respectively). At enrolment, 301 were confirmed to be HIV
positive for a sample prevalence of 43.6%.
Retrospective cohort
At the study visit, 540 (78%) individuals reported a previous
HIV test date, of whom 322 reported their last test was negative
and were thus eligible for inclusion in the retrospective cohort
analysis. Of the 322, 65 tested positive at the enrolment study
visit and the total amount of retrospective person-time since
their last negative test and enrolment was 102.4 years. Using
the mid-point assumption, these individuals contributed
51.2 person-years to follow-up for incidence estimation.
Among the 257 individuals who remained HIV negative, the
total amount of person-time between date of last negative
test and enrolment was 408.7 years. HIV incidence was
estimated to be 14.1 (65/[51.2 + 408.7]) per 100 person years
[95% confidence interval (CI) 10.7­17.6].
BED EIA analysis
Of the 301 participants who were confirmed HIV positive at
the enrolment study visit, 297 had sufficient specimen available
and thus were tested with BED EIA. Of these, 58 were classified
as recent infections. Using these results and two correction
formulas for test performance including low specificity
provided in an Excel spreadsheet by assay developers
(B. Parekh, personal communication), we calculated HIV
incidence estimates of 23.9 (95% CI 19.4­31.7) and
25.5 (95% CI 18.9­32.0) per 100 person-years. In a separate
calculation, to estimate specificity of BED EIA for this study
population, we considered 112 individuals who were
confirmed HIV positive and reported past HIV testing, of
whom 58 reported long-standing infections by self-reporting
an HIV-positive diagnosis >155 days prior. Of those, 10 were
classified as recent infections by BED EIA for a false positive
rate of 17.2% (95% CI 8.9­29.1). We then excluded these
known false positives (n = 10) from the 58 that were
classified as recent infections by BED EIA, and used the
correction formulas for HIV incidence considering 48 individ-
uals recently infected; HIV incidence estimates were
18.7 (95% CI 13.4­24.0) and 20.0 (95% CI 14.3­25.6) per
100 person-years.
Correlates of incident infections
To describe the epidemiology of incident infections, 677 par-
ticipants were included in the analysis (14 participants whose
HIV status could not be determined were excluded, 10 because
of conflicting BED EIA results and self-reported information
and 4 because of insufficient specimen for BED EIA testing).
Compared to HIV-negative participants (n = 390), those who
were classified recent infections (n = 48) were significantly
more likely to report not having any university education
(P = 0.026), not currently being employed (P = 0.017) and
not having injected drugs in the past 30 days (P = 0.039)
(table 1). In the multivariate model, not currently being
employed (OR = 3.4, 95% CI 1.5­7.9, P = 0.004) and not
having injected drugs in the past 30 days (OR = 2.8, 95% CI
1.1­7.1, P = 0.03) remained significantly associated with HIV
incidence. Because the association between not having injected
drugs in the past 30 days and incident infection was
unexpected, post hoc analyses were conducted on the seven
participants who were classified as recently infected and
reported not injecting in the past 30 days. Of these, four
were male and three were female, five reported injection
drug use in the past 6 months, two reported having a sex
partner who was an IDU (one male, one female), three
reported non-injection drug use in the past 30 days and
none were MSM. One person reported being aware of
HIV-positive serostatus due to a recent HIV test.
Spatial patterns
Of 677 participants with valid HIV status as described above,
670 participants reported a valid metro stop closest to their
place of residence and were thus included in spatial mapping.
Participants were enrolled from 12 out of 15 city districts.
In these 12 districts, the mean (SD) and median number
of participants were 52 (44) and 45, respectively; the range
was 14­155. Spatial mapping showed participants classified as
recently infected in 11 of these 12 city districts, with
the greatest proportions classified as recently infected in
the eastern (Krasnogvardeisky, 18.5%) and central
(Vasilyostorvsky, 20.0% and Kirovsky, 18.5%) districts of the
city (figure 1). Only Kirovsky district had a significantly higher
proportion of incident HIV cases compared to the rest of the
city (P = 0.04, P > 0.05 for all other comparisons).
Discussion
Our findings reveal a very high HIV incidence rate among IDU
in St Petersburg Russia, indicating that this vulnerable
population remains at the core of HIV acquisition and
HIV incidence among IDU in Russia 615
transmission. Though our analysis revealed a range of possible
estimates, from 14.1 to 25.5 new cases per 100 person-years
(see below for discussion of this range), each of our estimates
remain above acceptable standards in light of evidence that
HIV prevention approaches for IDU have proven effective in
reversing HIV epidemics in other parts of the world.24,25 This
remarkably high estimate of HIV incidence is worrisome for
the future course of the epidemic among IDU in Russia.
Comparison of our conservative estimate of 14.1/100 person-
years to the previous estimate of 4.5/100 person-years
in 2002­037 suggests the epidemic is continuing to expand.
Though it is difficult to directly compare these estimates
because of different study designs and estimation method-
ologies (the earlier lower incidence may have been influenced
by prevention counselling provided to participants during the
prospective cohort study), our estimates are evidence of
continued HIV transmission during a time when other parts
of the world have been able to contain the HIV epidemic among
IDU. Thus, expansion of prevention efforts is urgently needed
in St Petersburg. Our finding that participants who were
unemployed were significantly more likely to be recently
infected suggests that economically marginalized IDU may be
at greater risk for HIV; future studies should investigate the
degree to which economic vulnerability is associated with
unsafe drug behaviours or being in a risky social network. In
the meantime, HIV prevention efforts should focus on this
highly vulnerable group. The only behavioural correlate we
identified was not having injected in the past 30 days. This
finding was unexpected and is not readily explainable. One
possible explanation is that individuals may suspect their
infection in the absence of HIV testing and reduce risk
behaviours to prevent transmission. Another possible explan-
ation is that individuals who inject sporadically and have
periods of stopping and re-starting are at greater risk for
infection. This finding could also be the result of type I statis-
tical error in which the null hypothesis of no association is
incorrectly rejected. Future work should seek to confirm or
refute this finding.
Geographic spread of HIV throughout the city is another
key finding of our study. Data from 2002 to 2003 showed

significant clusters of incident cases in several central and
eastern districts of the city (in Petrogradsky and on the
border between Krasnogvardeisky and Nevsky, respectively).26
Our analysis also revealed a high proportion of incident cases
in these areas, but we further observed incident cases spread
more widely throughout the city in the vast majority of
districts (11 of 12) from which we recruited participants, and
new clusters eastward and southward in the Vasilyostrovsky
and Kirovsky districts. Taken together, these data suggest
that focal areas of HIV transmission are expanding
throughout the city.
This analysis served another important purpose: it allowed
us to compare HIV estimates in a cross-sectional sample
between traditional retrospective cohort methods and a more
recently developed serological assay. Even after adjusting for
test performance, our estimates derived from the BED EIA
were substantially higher (80%) than retrospective cohort
estimation. This is likely due to high frequency of misclassifi-
cation of the BED EIA of long-standing infections as recently
infected. High rates of false positive BED results have not been
uncommon, and our estimated false positive rate of 17% fell
within the range of estimates observed in other locations
(1.7% in South Africa,19 5.2% in Zimbabwe,14 32.2% in
Rwanda and Zambia17). The discrepancy in estimates derived
from different methods could also be due to bias in the
retrospective cohort estimate if, for example, recently
infected individuals were systematically excluded from that
analysis because they did not report a previous HIV test.
While it is known that all three of these methods (two
correction formulas and the cohort method) contain sources
of error,27 a strength in using multiple methods as we have
done here is to produce a range of estimates that can achieve
more plausible results.
This study has several limitations that are important to
consider. First, the clade of HIV circulating among IDUs in
St Petersburg, subtype Afsu
,28 is different from those used in
the development of BED. Although the assay was designed to
overcome problems associated with different subtypes,11 its
sensitivity and specificity for subtype Afsu
is unknown.
Second, our study is subject to limitations that are inherent
in the use of self-reported information regarding HIV testing
histories including dates and results. In this setting where
HIV testing coverage is sub-optimal and often not
voluntary,10 infrequent testing and inaccurate reporting
could influence our results. Our results could be biased if
those who had never had an HIV test (22% of the sample)
differed systematically from those who had been previously
tested with respect to HIV status and examine covariates.
Third, our findings are limited by our relatively small
sample size. Use of the BED EIA for incidence estimation is
recommended for use with large samples;12 thus our findings
from a sample of 691 individuals produced a wide range of
estimates for the false positive rate and did not permit
estimation of how specificity varies for sub-populations16 or
direct estimation of the mean seroconversion period, another
important parameter for incidence estimation using BED
EIA.14 However, our calculation of 95% CI for incidence
estimates account for the size of our sample and still reflect

high incidence estimates even at the lower bounds of
confidence. Given the limitations associated with each
method, a major strength of this analysis was the use of
multiple methods to provide a range of estimates.
We conclude that the BED EIA may be a useful tool for
estimating HIV incidence in cross-sectional studies when
additional information to calculate adjustment parameters
and measures of test performance is available. Further
research is needed to critically assess the utility of the BED
EIA in Russia. Much more pressing, the high estimates of
incidence by all methods underscore the urgent need for
expanded prevention efforts, both primary and secondary, to
reduce the high HIV transmission in this setting, and
prevention efforts will need to be widespread throughout the
city. Methods of harm reduction that have been shown to
reduce HIV transmission in IDU populations include
increased syringe access, drug treatment and expanded
anti-retroviral therapy. These programmes are not currently
widely available in Russia.29,30 We hope that our research
findings will be used to prompt prevention efforts on the
scale needed to reverse one of the world's most rapidly
escalating HIV epidemics.

Key points
 Russia has experienced one of the fastest growing HIV
epidemics anywhere in the world, and it is
concentrated among injection drug users (IDU).
 Our findings reveal a very high HIV incidence rate
among IDU in St Petersburg Russia, estimated to be
between 14 and 25 new cases per 100 person-years.
 Currently there is an urgent need for expanded
prevention efforts, both primary and secondary, to
reduce the high HIV transmission in this setting.
Given that we identified focal areas of transmission
to be expanding and limited behavioural risk factors,
these efforts need to be widespread.
