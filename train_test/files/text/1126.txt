ABSTRACT
Aims Behavioral genetic research has suggested that sibling effects on smok-
ing may reflect social rather than genetic processes. We utilize a genetically
informative sample of adolescents to test this proposition, focusing on sibling
relationship processes (social connectedness) shown to be influential in studies
of deviancy.
Design A combined twin-sibling design was employed to disentangle genetic
and non-genetic effects.
Participants We utilized a sample of 1421 adolescent sibling pairs participat-
ing in the US National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health).
These sibling pairs represent a spectrum of genetic relatedness and include
monozygotic twins, dizygotic twins, biological siblings, half-siblings and unre-
lated siblings.
Measurements Participants completed self-report questionnaires on smoking
behavior, quality of relationship with their sibling (social connectedness) and
peer and parental smoking.
Findings Main effects of both shared environment and genetics were found on
adolescent smoking frequency. Social connectedness between siblings moder-
ated shared environmental influences on smoking frequency at each time
period, as well as on change in smoking frequency. Shared environmental
effects were more pronounced when siblings reported high levels of social con-
nectedness. These environmental sibling effects on smoking were significant
after controlling for parent and peer smoking.
Conclusions This report extends prior research on sibling effects on smoking
by identifying specific relationship dynamics that underlie transmission of risk
within sibships and providing evidence that such relationship dynamics repre-
sent social rather than genetic processes.

INTRODUCTION
Although it is often acknowledged that sibling smoking is
a notable interpersonal risk factor for initiation and use of
tobacco (Flay et al. 1999), the effects of sibling smoking
have received less empirical effort than other interper-
sonal risk factors, especially parental and peer influences.
Recent research has begun to shed light on the potential
importance of sibling effects on tobacco use and argue for
more intensive examinations of how siblings influence
each other (Rajan et al. 2003; Vink et al. 2003). Of special
note is that direct comparisons have indicated that sibling
smoking is typically a stronger risk factor for youth
tobacco use than parental smoking, as concluded
recently in an exhaustive review of family studies (Ave-
nevoli & Merikangas 2003). This has been shown, for

example, in an epidemiological sample of adolescents and
young adults, in which older sibling smoking was dem-
onstrated to be more influential than parent smoking
(Boyle et al. 2001). In an elegant developmental design,
Duncan et al. (1996) have shown that older siblings influ-
enced not only the level of younger sibling smoking but
also their rate of use over multiple assessments. This
influence was unique to siblings and not found for par-
ents in this study, indicating that siblings may exert devel-
opmental effects pertaining to trajectories of use that are
independent of (and more robust than) parental factors.
There is thus growing recognition that sibling effects on
smoking are robust and worthy of studying in greater
detail (Avenevoli & Merikangas 2003), and there have
been calls for theory-driven research on sibling influ-
ences on smoking in adolescence (Darling & Cumsille
2003).
Recognizing the robust association between siblings
for tobacco use, and especially sibling similarity for tra-
jectories or progression of use over time, is a critical first
step to establish the potential importance of sibling effects
on smoking. A second step is to uncover the mechanisms
underlying sibling resemblance as these may provide
social or behavioral targets for such efforts in order to
inform prevention and intervention programs (Boyle
et al. 2001). Siblings share a number of factors--includ-
ing genetic relatedness--that could account for their sim-
ilarity for smoking. However, the classic twin method has
revealed repeatedly that shared (or common) environ-
mental factors--factors that promote similarity among
siblings independent of genetic relatedness--are strong
for initiation of smoking in adolescence as well as pro-
gression to higher levels of smoking intensity, and in
some cases are of greater magnitude than genetic effects
(see Li et al. 2003). This is a remarkable finding, in that
the detection of substantial and replicable shared envi-
ronmental effects is typically lacking in behavioral
genetic research (Dick & Rose 2002; Rende 2004). It is
especially noteworthy as the twin studies have come from
multiple cultures and yet converged on the same theme.
For example, a large population-based sample of Dutch
twins revealed that initiation of tobacco use was influ-
enced more strongly by shared environmental rather
than genetic factors (Koopmans et al. 1999) and that
these familial effects influenced initiation of both smok-
ing and alcohol use (Koopmans et al. 1997). A study of
adolescent twin pairs in Minnesota found that adolescent
initiation of substance use--including tobacco use--was
primarily explained by shared environmental rather than
genetic factors (Han et al. 1999), and additional studies
of US samples continue to show shared environmental as
well as genetic effects on adolescent smoking (McGue
et al. 2000; Rende et al. 2004). Using data from the Viet-
nam EraTwin Registry, True et al. (1997) revealed shared
environmental as well as genetic effects on smoking ini-
tiation. Madden et al. (1999) analyzed twin data collected
in Australia, Sweden and Finland, and suggested that the
familial factors influencing smoking initiation were
unique and independent of genetic effects that are asso-
ciated with persistence. Retrospective adult accounts of
early smoking behavior in a cohort of nearly 1300 adult
twins revealed that age of first use of tobacco (and alco-
hol) was primarily the result of shared environmental fac-
tors (Stallings et al. 1999). A study of twins reared apart
and reared together, derived from the population-based
Swedish Twin Registry, also suggested that shared envi-
ronmental effects may extend beyond smoking initiation
and influence the progression to regular tobacco use as
well (Kendler et al. 2000). Overall, therefore, twin studies
of adolescent and adult populations, drawn from numer-
ous countries, have all converged on the finding that
shared environmental effects are a critical etiological fac-
tor for initiation of smoking and perhaps escalation of
tobacco use, which echoes the claim that genetically
informative designs can sometimes provide the strongest
evidence of social effects because they include controls for
confounding genetic influences (e.g. Rutter et al. 2001).
The behavioral genetic findings reviewed above sug-
gest that sibling resemblance involves systematic social
influences that make siblings similar in addition to
genetic effects. What is especially intriguing is that twin
methodology has also implicated direct social contact
between siblings as a critical mechanism underlying the
shared environmental effects on smoking initiation. In a
landmark study, Kendler & Gardner (1998) examined
threeclassesof similarityof environmentalexperiencesin
childhood and adolescence in a sample of adult twin
pairs: childhood treatment, similitude and co-socializa-
tion (or social contact between members of the twin pair
in adulthood). Only co-socialization between twins pre-
dicted twin resemblance for smoking initiation, and these
effects were rather specific in that co-socialization was
not associated with similarity for other psychiatric disor-
ders. Kendler et al. (1999) have also shown that fre-
quency of social contact in adulthood predicts twin
resemblance for nicotine dependence as well as smoking
initiation. One limitation of this work is that it is based on
retrospective accounts of adult twin pairs, which dimin-
ishes the opportunity to examine whether social contact
actually coincides with early use of tobacco.
Evidence of sibling effects (which have been defined as
social influences within sibships that are associated with
behavioral outcomes; Rowe & Gulley 1992) on tobacco
use dovetails with heightened interest in sibling influ-
ences on deviancy in adolescence. Although sibling
effects on deviancy have been suspected for over two
decades, recently they have come to the forefront in a
number of studies (see Slomkowski et al. 2001). Of most

relevance for the study of sibling effects on smoking is the
existence of theoretical models postulating in more detail
the social processes between siblings that may affect ado-
lescent behavior. We have presented a theoretical model
(Slomkowski et al. 1997, 2001) that proposes a number
of social reinforcement behaviors that may underlie an
older sibling's influence on a younger sibling, the appar-
ent `mode of transmission' most probably implicated for
smoking (Duncan et al. 1996; Boyle et al. 2001; Burns
et al. 2002), as reviewed earlier. Critical to this model is
the idea that siblings may positively reinforce deviant
behavior, especially in adolescence, if the siblings enjoy
spending time together. In support of this model, we have
shown that affective quality of the sibling relationship is a
robust predictor of delinquent activity in adolescence
(Slomkowski et al. 2001), replicating and extending sim-
ilar findings reported a decade earlier by Rowe & Gulley
(1992). Of particular note is that the effect of having
an older sibling who engaged in delinquent activity
was highly dependent on relationship quality with the
younger sibling, such that a warm and supportive rela-
tionship with a delinquent older sibling represented the
highest risk for a younger sibling. Furthermore, these
`sibling effects' were shown to extend over a 4-year
period, such that having a warm relationship with a
delinquent older sibling in early adolescence was highly
predictive of younger sibling delinquency later in middle
adolescence, even after controlling for initial levels of
younger sibling delinquency.
It is likely that these social processes are not specific to
deviant behavior per se, but rather extend to a broad
range of adolescent activity including substance use.
Indeed, Rowe & Gulley (1992) demonstrated that
warmth between siblings, time spent together and having
mutual friends were predictive of substance use in adoles-
cence. To date, however, systematic investigation of such
social influence variables and their association with
tobacco use in adolescence has not been conducted. In
this paper, we utilize a unique sample of siblings partici-
pating in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health (Add Health). The Add Health sample includes a
genetically informative subsample of monozygotic twins
(MZ), dizygotic twins (DZ), full biological siblings (FS),
half-siblings (HS) and biologically unrelated siblings (US)
living together in the same household. Such a genetically
informative sample is powerful in elucidating social
effects, such as those we propose to exist for sibling influ-
ence on smoking, because of the ability to control for the
effects of genetic similarity (Rutter et al. 2001). In this
paper, we examine the role of sibling relationship quality
in contributing to sibling similarity on smoking, espe-
cially as a social effect independent of genetic influence
on smoking. Moreover, we provide controls for both
parental and peer smoking to demonstrate the unique
influence of sibling relationship quality on tobacco use in
adolescence.
METHODS
Sample
The data were obtained from the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), an ongoing
study designed to assess the health status of adolescents
and explore the causes of adolescent health-related
behaviors (see Resnick et al. 1997). Permission was
granted by the original study's Principal Investigators for
use of the data and human subjects approval was
obtained from the hospital Institutional Review Board.
Participants consisted of 20 747 adolescents who
were drawn originally from a national school survey of
90 118 American adolescents. Participants completed
in-home interviews administered between April and
December of 1995 (Wave 1); a follow-up interview was
conducted 1 year later (Wave 2). Adolescents were
selected randomly and stratified by gender and grades 7­
12 from 80 high schools and 52 feeder middle schools.
These high schools were chosen from an original sample
of all United States high schools that included an 11th
grade and enrolled 30 or more students. To ensure that
they were nationally representative, the 80 high schools
were selected systematically from the original sampling
frame, with stratification by region, urbanicity, ethnicity,
school type and school size.
Within this larger sample, a subsample of families
contributed more than one adolescent to the study. Spe-
cifically, a genetically informative subsample of sibling
pairs was ascertained, reflecting a range of genetic relat-
edness from 100% (monozygotic twins) to 0% (biologi-
cally unrelated siblings). Determination of twin zygosity
was based primarily on twins' and parents' reports of
how physically similar the twins were to one another. For
89 same-sex twins for whom zygosity remained uncer-
tain, DNA genetic markers were used to decide zygosity.
Monozygotic (MZ) pairs were identical for five or more
genetic markers; dizygotic (DZ) pairs differed by one or
more markers. The other types of siblings were catego-
rized according to information about the household
structure in the home interview, and included full sib-
lings (FS), half-siblings (HS) and biologically unrelated
siblings (US).
The present analyses data used specifically from
1421 sibling pairs, i.e. 2842 individuals (average
age = 15.5 years, SD = 1.71). These pairs comprised 448
sister pairs, 428 brother pairs and 545 female­male
pairs. By sibling type, the sample sizes were: twins, 403
pairs (141 MZ pairs and 262 DZ pairs); full-siblings, 672

pairs; half-siblings, 165 pairs; and biologically unrelated
siblings, 181 pairs.
Procedures and measures
Study interviewers read and recorded responses for items
deemed to be minimally intrusive or sensitive. To maxi-
mize confidentiality, self-reported items deemed to be
highly sensitive were presented on a laptop computer
using audio-computer assisted interview technology.
Adolescents were asked the standard question per-
taining to number of days smoked over the past 30 days
on each measurement occasion (Lloyd-Richardson et al.
2002). We examined individual differences on this vari-
able, utilizing data at each wave, with transformation to
approximate a normal distribution. Self-report was also
used to determine if parents smoked as well as the num-
ber of peers who smoke.
Sibling relationship quality was assessed using well-
studied and standardized items derived from prior
research on sibling effects on substance use (Rowe & Gul-
ley 1992). The particular items include, on a Likert scale,
ratings of how much time siblings spend together, how
much affection they feel for each other, and the extent to
which they have mutual friends. These are the funda-
mental constructs that comprise adolescent siblings' level
of positivity in their relationship (Slomkowski et al. 1997,
2001; Slomkowski & Manke 2004). As expected from
previous research, principal components analysis of
these items revealed a robust single-factor solution repre-
senting a latent trait of `sibling social connectedness',
with internal consistency (alpha) being 0.91.
Analytical strategy
For genetic analyses, sibling pairs were categorized based
on their level of genetic relatedness (R). MZ twins were
assigned a genetic relatedness correlation of 1.0, reflect-
ing their 100% shared genotype. Unrelated siblings (UR)
raised in the same family (e.g. step-siblings, children from
successive adoptions, an adopted child or a biological
child of the adoptive parents) were assigned 0.0 because
they are genetically unrelated. DZ twins and full siblings
(FS), who share 50% of their genetic material, were
assigned 0.50; half siblings (HS) were assigned 0.25.
Multiple levels of genetic relatedness are incorporated
into DeFries­Fulker regression models (DF) that can be
used to estimate heritability (h2) and shared environmen-
tal (c2) estimates (DeFries & Fulker 1985, 1988; Cherny
et al. 1992; Rende 1993, 1999; Rende et al. 1993; Rodg-
ers & McGue 1994; Rende & Plomin 1995; Rende &
Slomkowski 2004). The basic DF model predicts one sib-
ling's phenotype (smoking frequency) from the cosib-
ling's as follows:
(1) SF1 = b0
+ b1
SF2 + b2
R + b3
(R × SF2) + e
The dependent variable is sibling 1's smoking frequency
(SF1). The independent variables are: (a) the second sib-
ling's smoking frequency (SF2), (b) the sibling pair's coef-
ficient of genetic relatedness (R) and (c) the interaction
between the second sibling's score and the coefficient of
genetic relatedness (SF2 × R). The intercept (0
) and an
error term (e) are also included.
The unstandardized beta-weight on the SF2 variable
(b1
) estimates shared environment variance (c2). The
unstandardized beta weight on the interaction term (b3
)
estimates heritability (h2). For these DF analyses, and for
all subsequent DF analyses, all pairs were double-entered
so that the SF of each member of the sibling pair was
placed once in the dependent variable (i.e. SF1) and once
in the independent variable (i.e. SF2). In order to adjust
the significance tests for the double entry, the standard
errors of the parameter estimates were increased by a
multiplicative constant (i.e. 1.41) because a standard
error is based on the square root of the sample size.
Of particular interest for this paper is a modification
of the basic DF model presented above. This model can be
expanded to include additional covariates that can also
serve as variables for interactive terms with the main
effects of the latent traits reflecting heritable and shared
environmental influences (Rende et al. 1993). Thus, we
expanded this basic model to incorporate sibling social
connectedness (SC) to determine the extent to which it
conditioned both genetic and shared environmental
influences, as indicated below in the expansion of
equation 1:
(2) SF1 = b0
+ b1
SF2 + b2
R + b3
SC2 + b4
(R × SF2) +
b5
(R × SC2) + b6
(SC2 × SF2) + b7
(R × SC2 × SF2) + e
The interaction term (SC2 × SF2) reflects moderation
of the shared environmental component by the sibling
social connectedness variable. The final triple interac-
tion term indicates moderation of heritability by sibling
social connectedness. In this model, sibling 2's report of
social connectedness is used to predict sibling 1's smok-
ing frequency to reduce collinearity (see Rowe & Gulley
1992; Slomkowski et al. 2001); the double entry proce-
dure is again used with the resultant correction for
sample size. Further extensions of this model were used
to predict changes in frequency of tobacco use from
Wave 1 to Wave 2, as well as control for parental and
peer smoking.
Prior to presenting results of the expanded DF regres-
sion model, we present correlations stratified by median
split of the social connectedness variable (based on an
average of each sibling's response), as well as estimates of
heritability and shared environment also stratified by sib-
ling social contact. These data provide a descriptive

picture of the effects of sibling social contact which are
then tested for significance by the expanded DF model.
RESULTS
We first present, in Table 1, the intraclass correlations for
the five sibling groups (MZ, DZ, FS, HS, US) for past 30-
day smoking behavior at each time-point, stratified by the
median split on sibling social connectedness. There are
two detectable patterns of findings here. One pattern is
that there is some conformity between the magnitude of
sibling resemblance (intraclass correlation) and genetic
relatedness, suggesting some influence of genetic factors.
However, the differences between each level of genetic
relatedeness (e.g. MZ versus DZ; FS versus HS) are smaller
than would be predicted based on genetic relatedness
alone, implying that shared (or common) environmental
factors also promote sibling similarity independent of
genetic effects. A second pattern is that sibling correla-
tions for all sibling groups are lower under the condition
of low social connectedness, implying that social con-
nectedness influenced overall level of sibling resemblance
for smoking.
These patterns form the basis for applying the basic DF
model (eqn 1) separately to the high and low social con-
tact groups. Table 2 presents these summary statistics for
each time-point. The parameters for both genetic and
shared environmental effects are significant at each time-
point, suggesting that both are influential for frequency
of smoking in adolescence. However, although heritabil-
ity does not change as a function of social connectedness,
there is a notable difference in shared environmental
effects, which are stronger under the higher social con-
nectedness condition.
We next applied the expanded DF model (eqn 2) to test
for the significance of the interaction terms reflecting
moderation of the shared environment component, and
heritability, respectively, by sibling social connectedness.
Although social connectedness did not moderate herita-
bility at Wave 1 (b7
= 0.01, NS) or Wave 2 (b7
= 0.00, NS),
it was a significant moderator of the shared environmen-
tal effect at both Wave 1 (b6
= 0.05, P < 0.01) and Wave 2
(b6
= 0.03, P < 0.05).
We further expanded the DF model (eqn 2) to predict
smoking frequency at Wave 2 after controlling for prior
smoking at Wave 1 (i.e. change in smoking frequency).
We continue to observe that social connectedness signif-
icantly moderated the shared environmental effect
(b6
= 0.19, P < 0.01), but not heritability of smoking fre-
quency (b7
= 0.04, NS). Given that Wave 1 and Wave 2
smoking frequencies were highly correlated (r = 0.73),
we attempted to determine if the significance of this find-
ing reflected prediction of initiation of smoking (i.e. ado-
lescents who never smoked as of Wave 1 engaging in
some cigarette use by Wave 2) or escalation of smoking
intensity (i.e. increases in smoking frequency from Wave
1 to Wave 2 within the subgroup of smokers at Wave 1).
About 43% of the sample reported never trying a ciga-
rette at Wave 1, and approximately 17% of these individ-
uals initiated smoking at Wave 2. Sibling social
connectedness moderated the prediction of smoking ini-
tiation at Wave 2 from co-sibling smoking at Wave 1
(b6
= 0.23, P < 0.05) but did not moderate change signif-
icantly in smoking frequency for those who had already
begun smoking at Wave 1.
The models presented above were re-run including
separate controls for parental and peer smoking, respec-
tively. The parameters presented in these tables did not
change substantially. For example, although the stan-
dardized coefficient reflecting moderation of shared envi-
ronment by social connectedness dropped from 0.21 to
0.13 at Wave 2 after controlling for parent and peer
smoking, this term was still highly significant (P < 0.01).

sibling social connectedness continued to be a significant
moderator of the shared environmental influence on
smoking frequency at each time-point, as well as on
change in smoking frequency.
Finally, we considered effects of sibling gender compo-
sition and sibling birth order in our models. Given the
complexity of our models in this report (i.e. the use of tri-
ple interaction terms), we have limited power to expand
the analytical framework further to test for gender com-
position effects. Thus, it was not surprising that we did
not find significant effects of gender composition on the
conditional association between social connectedness
and sibling smoking in the expanded model that also
included zygosity. Given the possibility of low power to
detect gender composition effects, we dropped zygosity
from the model in order to examine if sibling social
connectedness moderated sibling similarity based
differentially on gender composition. In these models, a
significant interaction term was found for same-sex (both
brother and sister pairs) but not mixed-sex pairs. Similar
models were also run to examine the effects of birth order;
the described moderating effect of social connectedness
on sibling similarity was found for both older-to-younger
and younger-to-older prediction.
DISCUSSION
Recent research has converged on the conclusion that
sibling influence is substantial for smoking, especially
in adolescence. Behavioral genetic studies have sug-
gested that social factors may play an important role in
this process, with sibling social contact being one key
influence. This paper extends this notion in an impor-
tant way by combining a genetically informative design
with measures of smoking frequency in adolescence
along with indicators of sibling social connectedness.
Overall, we were able to demonstrate that sibling social
connectedness indeed influenced frequency of smoking
in adolescence, and that such sibling effects reflect
social influence rather than the influence of genetic
similarity.
Much of the previous work on sibling influence on
smoking has relied on traditional family study methods
focused on full biological siblings (see Avenevoli & Meri-
kangas 2003). This type of method is critical for indicat-
ing that sibling influence on smoking is notable, but
confounds genetic and environmental influence and thus
cannot yield information on the mechanisms underlying
sibling similarity. Our paper has focused on social con-
nectedness between siblings, which has been proposed as
a potential social influence on smoking in both epidemi-
ological (Boyle et al. 2001) and genetic epidemiological
research (Kendler & Gardner 1998; Kendler et al. 1999).
We have transported a theoretical model that has been
well tested in the etiology of deviant behavior
(Slomkowski et al. 2001) and in this paper have shown it
to be valid for smoking in adolescence. The critical addi-
tion of this report, however, is the demonstration that sib-
ling social connectedness is a significant moderator of the
shared environmental effect on smoking in adolescence.
This can be achieved only by genetically informative
designs (Rutter et al. 2001), such as that offered in the
Add Health Study. We believe these data provide a com-
pelling argument that the sibling relationship is an
important breeding ground for social behaviors that
influence use of cigarettes in adolescence, which comple-
ments other studies that argue that peer and parental
influences also represent part of the shared environmen-
tal effects on smoking (White et al. 2003). Such an argu-
ment is bolstered by our finding that sibling social
connectedness moderated the shared environmental
effect on change in smoking behavior over a 1-year
period, particularly initiation of smoking rather than
change in smoking frequency. Our models did not sup-
port gene­environment interaction effects between expo-
sure to sibling smoking and genetic relatedness, although
it may be that such effects would be more detectable once
the sample ages and begins to manifest higher levels of
smoking intensity. Furthermore, as sibling social con-
nectedness did not appear to reflect genetic effects, there
was no evidence of gene-environment correlation. How-
ever, it may be that there are underlying individual traits
that serve to drive both sibling behavior and smoking
(such as dimensions of personality) that would reflect
gene­environment correlations that contribute to sibling
effects on smoking.
In this report, we have provided controls for parent
and peer smoking in order to demonstrate that sibling
effects on smoking are robust and can be detected. We
have performed this, in part, to highlight the importance
of including siblings in interpersonal models of smoking
behavior. Conceptually, however, we agree with theoreti-
cal perspectives that argue for examining connections
across relationships in order to understand more fully
how social influences converge to promote risk for smok-
ing in adolescence (Darling & Cumsille 2003). For exam-
ple, we have argued that parental factors set a familial
climate via which sibling influences on deviancy emerge
and blossom during the transition to adolescence
(Slomkowski et al. 2001), and a similar argument could
be made for the early stages of smoking behavior. Fur-
thermore, our construct of sibling social connectedness
includes having mutual friends, thus linking sibling and
peer influences, which are thought of typically as sepa-
rate constructs in the literature on adolescent smoking.
Further work needs to be done to examine how the
salient interpersonal relationships may come together to

promote risk for smoking in adolescence. That said, how-
ever, we would still argue that unique aspects of sibling
influence need to be examined in detail in order to gain
insight into the way that siblings may function to connect
intrafamilial (parental) and extrafamilial (peer) influ-
ences on smoking.
The Add Health data set includes two measurement
periods separated by a 1-year interval. Although this pro-
vides a small window on change in smoking over time, we
did find that sibling social connectedness represented a
social influence on change in smoking frequency, and
especially on initiation of smoking. Further study of this
sample will provide more opportunity to examine the
extent to which sibling influence extends across time and
is predictive of more substantial progression in smoking
behaviors (e.g. progression from experimentation to reg-
ular smoking). No differences were found based on
sibling birth order, similar to recent studies on sibling
similarity for smoking (Vink et al. 2003). However, as it is
possible that some of the youngest siblings in the sample
may eventually initiate smoking, there may be interest-
ing effects of exposure to older sibling smoking that we
could not detect with the present data. For example, in
our work on deviancy, we have shown that having a
warm, supportive relationship with an older delinquent
sibling is associated with younger sibling deviancy 4
years later, once the younger siblings enter a period of
heightened risk for delinquent behavior (Slomkowski
et al. 2001). Further follow-up of the Add Health sample
may permit more insight into how sibling social connect-
edness influences smoking trajectories in younger sib-
lings and the extent to which they may extend beyond
smoking initiation. In addition, similar to other recent
studies of sibling resemblance for smoking (Vink et al.
2003), it appears that same-sex siblings provide more
influential social environments for smoking than mixed-
sex sibling pairs.
Three limitations of this study warrant mention. First,
given the broad goals of the study, smoking behavior of
the adolescents relied upon self-report questionnaires
with rather brief, albeit standard, items. We have relied
on the self-report of smoking frequency over a 30-day
period in our models, although it is recognized that more
comprehensive assessment of smoking would be ideal.
We do note that there is increasing recognition that
behavioral genetic studies of smoking should incorporate
more detailed measures of smoking (White et al. 2003)
rather than rely on simple dichotomies (e.g. smoke versus
not smoke), and in this regard the focus on smoking fre-
quency is in line with this proposal. Secondly, although
the sample size is substantial, it is still relatively small to
pursue some issues, such as gender composition effects
on the conditional association between sibling social con-
nectedness and sibling smoking after controlling for
genetic relatedness. Thirdly, the sampling frame (two
waves of data separated by a 1-year period) is rather nar-
row and does not permit full investigation of sibling
effects on progression of smoking. However, follow-up
study of this sample will eventually permit such questions
to be addressed.
In summary, we have provided evidence that sibling
influence on smoking functions as a social risk factor,
after controlling for genetic effects. As discussed by
McGue et al. (2000) and Boyle et al. (2001), prevention
and intervention aimed at reducing early smoking
behaviors could capitalize on the demonstration of
shared environmental effects (`pure' environmental
effects not confounded by genetic similarity) as well as
demonstrated sibling effects, the two constructs which
have been merged in this report. A number of social pro-
cess mechanisms could underlie what we have referred to
as sibling effects on smoking, especially those that have
been shown to be important for the development of devi-
ancy. These include processes such as direct reinforce-
ment for deviant behaviors, modeling of deviancy and
integration of mutual deviant peers in social networks
(e.g. Slomkowski et al. 1997, 2001). A next step in this
line of research will be the application of methods that
can capture the nuances of specific social processes that
underlie sibling effects on smoking, such as utilizing
intensive methodologies that can capture social influence
in real time and across social settings. More detail on the
actual social interactive mechanisms that form the foun-
dation of sibling effects on smoking may provide specific
targets for prevention and intervention programs aimed
at reducing both initial use of tobacco as well as early
stages of progression.
