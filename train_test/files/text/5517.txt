Introduction
Genome-wide association studies show a robust association
of a region near the tumour suppressor locus CDKN2A/B
with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes
(T2D).1,2 CDKN2A codes for p16INK4a and its alternative
reading frame transcript variant p14ARF (p19ARF in mice),
whereas CDKN2B codes for p15INK4b. p16INK4a and p15INK4b
are cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, controlling
cell cycle progression, whereas p14ARF modulates the cell
cycle by initiating p53-dependent cell cycle arrest.2 We pre-
viously showed that p16INK4a affects the inflammatory phe-
notype of murine3 and human4 macrophages.
Obesity, hallmarked by excessive adipose tissue (AT)
expansion, is a risk factor for CVD and T2D. The human
body contains different AT depots, located beneath the
skin (subcutaneous AT (scAT)) and in the abdominal cav-
ity surrounding the internal organs (visceral AT (vAT)). In

Abstract
The genomic CDKN2A/B locus, encoding p16INK4a among others, is linked to an increased risk for cardiovascular disease
and type 2 diabetes. Obesity is a risk factor for both cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. p16INK4a is a cell cycle
regulator and tumour suppressor. Whether it plays a role in adipose tissue formation is unknown. p16INK4a knock-down
in 3T3/L1 preadipocytes or p16INK4a deficiency in mouse embryonic fibroblasts enhanced adipogenesis, suggesting a role
for p16INK4a in adipose tissue formation. p16INK4a-deficient mice developed more epicardial adipose tissue in response
to the adipogenic peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma agonist rosiglitazone. Additionally, adipose tissue
around the aorta from p16INK4a-deficient mice displayed enhanced rosiglitazone-induced gene expression of adipogenic
markers and stem cell antigen, a marker of bone marrow-derived precursor cells. Mice transplanted with p16INK4a-
deficient bone marrow had more epicardial adipose tissue compared to controls when fed a high-fat diet. In humans,
p16INK4a gene expression was enriched in epicardial adipose tissue compared to other adipose tissue depots. Moreover,
epicardial adipose tissue from obese humans displayed increased expression of stem cell antigen compared to lean
controls, supporting a bone marrow origin of epicardial adipose tissue. These results show that p16INK4a modulates
epicardial adipose tissue development, providing a potential mechanistic link between the genetic association of the
CDKN2A/B locus and cardiovascular disease risk.

addition, AT is found in different locations surrounding
blood vessels, named perivascular AT (pvAT), thought to
play a role in CVD.5 A specific type of pvAT called epicar-
dial AT (ecAT) surrounds the coronary arteries of the heart.
ecAT is fat located between the myocardium and visceral
pericardium, that is, onto the myocardium. More distally,
pericardial adipose tissue (pcAT) is the fat depot outside
the visceral pericardium, that is, within the pericardial sac.
Although pvAT is thought to develop from its own precur-
sors, it shares many similarities between white and brown
AT (bAT).6 Besides structural support, pvAT is being
increasingly appreciated as an active modulator of vascu-
lar tone and function. Given the close role of pvAT with
obesity, it may be an important link between the metabolic
syndrome and atherosclerosis.6
During adipogenesis, cell cycle regulation contributes
to adipocyte formation.7 During adipogenesis, precursor
cells go through 1 or 2 rounds of cells division, a process
called mitotic clonal expansion. However, the potential
role of cell cycle mediators does not entirely depend on
this clonal mechanism. It has been shown, for example,
that CDK4, whose function is controlled by p16INK4a,
directly interacts and activates the master adipogenic regu-
lator peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma
(PPAR) besides its role in the cell cycle.8 Currently, it
is unknown whether CDKN2A/B gene products play a
role in adipogenesis. We therefore investigated whether
p16INK4a is involved in adipogenesis and AT formation.
Experimental procedures
Cell culture
3T3-L1 cells were cultured in growth medium containing
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Paris,
France) and 10% foetal calf serum (GE healthcare, Lille,
France). For differentiation, fully confluent cell monolay-
ers were incubated for 48
h in medium containing 10%
HyClone Cosmic Calf Serum (GE Healthcare, Lille,
France), methylisobutylxanthine (0.5
mM), insulin (5
M)
and dexamethasone (1M). Hereafter, adipocytes were cul-
tured in post-differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified
Eagle's medium, 10% HyClone Cosmic Calf Serum, 5M
insulin). Small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments were
performed overnight in pre-confluent 3T3/L1 cells using
siRNA for CDKN2A [043107-00-005; Thermo Scientific
(ON-TARGET plus SMART pool siRNA)], control
[D-001810-10-20; Thermo Scientific (ON-TARGET plus
non-targeting pool siRNA), Villebon-sur-Yvette, France]
or PPAR [L-040712-00-0005, Thermo Scientific
(ON-TARGET plus SMART pool siRNA)] using
INTERFERin reagent (Polyplus-transfection) according
to manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiency
was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(qPCR). Treatments with the CDK4 inhibitor (PD0332991)
were done using 1µM of PD0332991 in non-differentiated
3T3-L1, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as vehicle.
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were derived from
13.5-day-old wild-type and p16-/-embryos and plated in six-
well plates (300,000
cells/well). Adipocyte differentiation
was initiated after 2days of confluence. MEFs were differen-
tiated with AmnioMAX-C100 medium (Invitrogen, Paris,
France), 7.5% AmnioMAX-C100 supplement (Invitrogen,
Paris, France), 7.5% foetal calf serum, 0.5
mM 3-isobutyl-
1-methylxanthine, 1M dexamethasone, 5M insulin. From
days 3 to 8, cells were incubated with medium supplemented
with 5
M insulin and 1
M rosiglitazone. At different time
points, cells were lysed and homogenized for RNAisolation,
or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with Oil Red
O. All experiments were performed at least in triplicate.
Flow cytometry
3T3-L1 (1×106 to 1×107) were trypsinized, centrifuged
at 850g for 5min and resuspended in 0.5mL of 4°C phos-
phate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in cold 70% ethanol
for 30min, and washed twice in PBS by centrifugation at
850g for 5min. Fixed cells were treated with 5µg/mL of
DNase-free RNase A (Sigma, Lesquin, France) and incu-
bated in 20µg/mL of propidium iodide (PI, sigma,
Lesquin, France) for 15
min at room temperature. DNA
content frequency was acquired using a FACS Canto II
flow cytometer equipped with the FACS Diva software
(BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Cell dou-
blets were excluded from the analysis using doublet dis-
crimination gating method: FSC-A/SSC-A gate followed
by a PI-A/PI-W gate. Cell cycle distribution was analysed
using FACSDiva6.0 (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR, USA).
Mice
p16INK4a-deficient (p16-/-) mice on a C67BL/6J back-
ground were kindly provided by P. Krimpenfort
(Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam). Female mice
were treated with rosiglitazone (15
mg/kg) for 5
weeks.
For bone marrow transplantation, 8-week-old female
ldlr-/- mice were lethally irradiated (8 Gy) and tail vein
injected the next day with 107 bone marrow cells isolated
from 8-week-old p16-/- or littermate control (p16+/+) donor
mice. Mice received autoclaved acidified water (pH
=
2)
supplemented with neomycin (100
mg/L) (Cat.N1142,
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and polymyxin B
sulphate (60,000
U/L) (Cat.21850029, Invitrogen, Paris,
France) 1
week before and 4
weeks after transplantation.
Mice were studied 6
weeks post-transplantation allowing
complete repopulation by the donor bone marrow. To
ensure that donor bone marrow efficiently replaced the
resident blood cell population, DNA was extracted
from whole blood with an Illustra blood kit (GE Health-
care, Lille, France). PCR was performed with the forward

5-GCA-GTG-TTG-CAG-TTT-GAA-CCC-3 and reverse
5-TGT-GGC-AAC-TGA-TTC-AGT-TTG-3 primers,
yielding products of different lengths depending on the
genotype, separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and quantified
with the Gel Doc XR system (Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-
Coquette, France). Over 95% of host blood cells were
from donor origin. All protocols were conducted with the
approval of the ethical review boards of the Pasteur
Institute, Lille, France (CEEA 13/2010) and Maastricht
University, Maastricht, The Netherlands (DEC 2007-117).
RNA extraction and analysis
Total RNA was obtained from tissues using the guanidini-
umthiocyanate (GSCN)/phenol/chloroform extraction
method and from cells using EXTRACT-ALL (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Villebon-sur-Yvette, France), DNase-I
treated and complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated
using cDNAreverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems,
Villebon-sur-Yvette, France). Real-time qPCR detection
was conducted on a Stratagene Mx3005P (Agilent tech-
nologies) using Brilliant II SYBR Green reagent (Agilent
Technologies, Les Ulis, France) and specific primers.

pvAT measurements
Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation and the heart
of each animal was rinsed with PBS and fixed with 4%
phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde (pH
=
7.4). Serial
10-µm-thick sections were cut and lipid deposition was
quantitatively analysed by Oil red-O staining.
Human adipose tissue collection
ScAT and vAT were obtained as previously described4
(Table 1). The study was approved by the ethics committee
of the CHRU of Lille, France, under the ABOS and
OMENTOB frameworks. None of the patients had clinical
symptoms of systemic inflammation or malignancies.
Human ecAT and pcAT was obtained from patients under-
going cardiac surgery for coronary artery by-pass graft at
the Lille University Regional Hospital (Table 2). The study
was approved by the local Patient Protection Committee
(Lille, France) and patients gave informed consent. ecAT
is defined as the fat located between the myocardium and
visceral pericardium, that is, onto the myocardium. pcAT
is defined as the fat depot outside the visceral pericardium,
that is, within the pericardial sac.

Results
p16INK4a knock-down (Supplemental Figure 1) in 3T3-L1
cells using siRNA targeting CDKN2A increased cell divi-
sion during clonal expansion (Figure 1(a)) and concomi-
tantly enhanced adipogenesis, illustrated by enhanced
lipid accumulation (Figure 1(b)) and increased expression
of adipogenic genes such as PPAR, c/ebp, adiponectin
and perilipin (Figure 1(c)). Inhibiting CDK4 activity with
the pharmacological inhibitor PD0332991 or simultane-
ously knocking down PPAR with siRNA blunted the
effects of p16INK4a knock-down (Figure 1(b) and (c)).
Given the key role of PPAR in adipogenesis,7 we tested
whether p16INK4a deficiency affects adipogenic differentia-
tion of MEFs. Indeed, primary p16-/- MEFs displayed
increased adipogenesis upon PPAR activation compared
to MEFs from p16+/+ littermates, evidenced by enhanced
expression of PPAR (Figure 2(a)), c/ebp (Figure 2(b)),
adiponectin (Figure 2(c)) and perilipin (Figure 2(d)) at
several time points of adipogenic differentiation. These
data demonstrate that p16INK4a deficiency increases adipo-
genesis via a CDK4-PPAR-dependent pathway.
To assess a role of p16INK4a in AT formation in vivo, we
analysed AT depots from p16+/+ and p16-/- mice. Neither
scAT, gonadal AT [ovarian AT (oAT) or ecAT] nor bAT
weight was different between the genotypes in either male
or female mice (Supplemental Figure 2Aand B). Moreover,
the weight of scAT and ecAT from p16+/+ and p16-/- mice
did not change upon feeding a high-fat diet (data not
shown), suggesting that p16 deficiency has no major
impact on adipogenesis in vivo under these conditions.
Since our results show that the effect of p16INK4a deficiency
on adipogenesis in vitro depends on PPAR, we assessed
the effect of rosiglitazone on AT depots from p16+/+ and
p16-/- mice. Rosiglitazone treatment induced bAT forma-
tion equally in p16+/+ and p16-/- mice, while oAT or scAT
were unaffected (Supplemental Figure 2C). Since recent
studies show that AT surrounding the murine heart is
induced by PPAR activation,9 perivascular AT was ana-
lysed. Rosiglitazone induced the appearance of adipocytes
at the aortic valve area, that is, aortic pvAT which anatomi-
cally corresponds to human ecAT located between the
myocardium and visceral pericardium (Figure 3(a) and
(b)). Interestingly, pvAT surface was significantly larger in
p16-/- mice than in wild-type littermates (Figure 3(a) and
(b)). Since these murineAT depots were too small to obtain
enough mRNA for reliable qPCR analysis, mRNA was
measured in thoracic aortas with their surrounding pvAT.
Rosiglitazone-treated p16-/- mice expressed higher levels
of adipogenic genes such as PPAR (Figure 3(c)) and per-
ilipin (Figure 3(d)), in pvAT from thoracic aortas com-
pared to littermate controls. Expression of the macrophage
marker F4/80 was unaltered (Figure 3(e)), indicating that
p16INK4a deficiency does not influence pvAT macrophage
content. Mesenchymal stem cell precursors especially
reside in the perivascular region.10 Moreover, rosiglitazone
has been shown to contribute to murine peripheral adipo-
genesis by promoting recruitment of SCA-1-positive bone
marrow-derived progenitor cells,11 prompting us to meas-
ure SCA-1 expression. Interestingly, while SCA-1 expres-
sion was unaffected by rosiglitazone treatment in other

ATs (Supplemental Figure 3A­C), SCA-1 mRNA was
induced by rosiglitazone in pvAT from thoracic aortas and
this induction was markedly enhanced in p16-/- mice
(Figure 3(f)). Therefore, we next investigated the contribu-
tion of bone marrow p16INK4a deficiency on pvAT develop-
ment. The mice were fed a western-type diet as a
physiologically relevant stimulus of pvAT development.
Bone marrow-restricted p16INK4a deficiency resulted in
enhanced formation of aortic pvAT (Figure 4(a) and (b)).
Mice transplanted with p16INK4a-deficient bone marrow
displayed slightly lower body weight gain compared with
controls. However, this difference did not reach statistical
significance (Supplemental Figure 4A). In addition, oAT
was lower in mice transplanted with p16INK4a-deficient
bone marrow (Supplemental Figure 4B), arguing that
increased adipogenesis is restricted to the aortic region in
these animals. Thus, our results show that p16INK4a defi-
ciency in bone marrow cells enhances western diet-induced
pvAT formation in mice.
Finally, we investigated gene expression of p16INK4a in
scAT, vAT, pcAT and ecAT isolated from human subjects.
Compared to the other AT depots, p16INK4a expression is
especially high in ecAT (Figure 5(a)), explaining why
ecAT is more sensitive to modulation by p16INK4a than
other ATs. Although SCA-1 has no human ortholog, the
neighbouring SCA-2 gene is conserved in humans and
may have similar functions.12 Interestingly, SCA-2
expression is higher in ecAT from obese patients com-
pared to lean controls (Figure 5(b)), while its expression
is not influenced by obesity in other AT depots (Figure
5(c) to (e)).
Discussion
Although the link between CDKN2A and CVD and T2D
was discovered in 2007,1,2 it remained unclear via which
pathways this locus influences CVD. Our results show that
p16INK4a plays a role in mitotic clonal expansion-mediated
adipogenesis and in the development of murine pvAT
close to the heart.
We show for the first time a functional role for p16INK4a
in adipocyte differentiation, likely due to an enhancement
of mitotic clonal expansion, crucial for adipogenesis of
murine cells.13 Although the employed siRNA targeting
CDKN2A knocks down both p16INK4a and p19ARF, our
data show that the effects of CDKN2A knock-down
depend on CDK4 activity, which is controlled by p16INK4a
but not p19ARF.14 Moreover, similar results were obtained
using primary MEFs from mice specifically lacking
p16INK4a. CDK4 was shown to promote adipogenesis
through PPAR activation.8 In line, our data show that the
effects of CDKN2A knock-down depend on PPAR. In
addition, CDK4 was recently shown to potentiate insulin
signalling in adipocytes, thereby inhibiting lipolysis and
enhancing lipogenesis.15 Therefore, we cannot exclude
that metabolic changes are at least partially involved in
the enhanced adipogenesis after p16INK4a knock-down.
In vivo, p16INK4a deficiency did not affect rosiglitazone-
induced adipogenesis in bAT, vAT or scAT. Interestingly,
p16INK4a deficiency increased the formation of pvAT sur-
rounding the aortic root. In addition, by performing bone
marrow transplantation, we found increased pvAT forma-
tion in mice transplanted with p16INK4a-deficient bone
marrow fed a high-fat high-cholesterol diet. We did not
observe increased body weight or oAT, suggesting that the
effects of p16INK4a deficiency are specific for pvAT forma-
tion. The origin of adipocyte precursor cells currently
remains subject of debate and conflicting data exist
whether or not adipocyte progenitors derive from hemat-
opoietic cells.16 In support of a bone marrow origin of at
least some adipocytes, is the fact that adipogenesis in
white AT depots occurs in close proximity to the vascula-
ture without sharing a common progenitor with vascular
cells.16 To our knowledge, the potential hematopoietic ori-
gin of pvAT has not yet been investigated. Although our
study was not designed to univocally identify a bone mar-
row origin of pvAT, our results suggest that increased adi-
pogenesis caused by p16INK4a deficiency in bone marrow
cells contributes to aortic pvAT formation.

In human ecAT, p16INK4a mRNA is more abundant than
in other AT depots. This result suggests that ecAT may be,
more than other AT depots, sensitive to p16INK4a function or
regulation. Interestingly, SCA-2 gene expression was higher
in ecAT isolated from obese compared to lean individuals.
In line, murine aortic pvAT from p16-/- mice displayed
higher SCA-1 mRNAlevels than wild-type controls. Murine
SCA-1 is a surface molecule associated with stem cells
thought to function as a co-signalling molecule with roles in
haematopoiesis, bone formation and muscle homeostasis.12
SCA-1 does not have a clear human ortholog since the
region encoding this and five additional related genes has
been deleted through evolution. However, the region flank-
ing this deleted 500
kb are conserved in humans and it is
possible that at least some of the important roles of SCA-1
in murine development are taken over by one or a number of
human-related proteins,12 such as SCA-2. However, it
remains to be determined whether SCA-2 shares the same
role in bone marrow stem cells as SCA-1 in mice.
The development of fat covering the human heart and
aorta is thought to contribute to CVD. These fat depots,
which are in direct contact with the epicardium and the
arteries, are a source of free fatty acids, adipokines, and
inflammatory cytokines.5 ecAT is thus believed to directly
interact with cardiomyocytes and the coronary vasculature
through paracrine signalling. Recent epidemiological stud-
ies have linked ecAT volume with CVD, such as atrial
fibrillation and coronary atherosclerosis.5
In conclusion, our results shed light on the potential
role of p16INK4a in pvAT development. Given the known
association of pvAT with CVD, our data provide a new
mechanism to explain one of the most profound GWAS
associations for CVD risk.
