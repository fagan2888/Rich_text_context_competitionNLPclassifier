Abstract: Many studies have reported that during high fertility points in the menstrual
cycle, women demonstrate increased preference for men with masculinized faces and
bodies. In this study, we analyzed whether appetitive aggression in men serves as an
additional signal for a favored partner choice. Appetitive aggression describes the intrinsic
motivation to act violently even when not being threatened. This study evaluated the
responses of 1212 women to one of four descriptions regarding a soldier´s experience after
returning from war. The four vignettes included trauma related symptoms with high or low
appetitive aggression, or no trauma related symptoms with high or low appetitive
aggression. Participants rated their desirability for the soldier in regards to potential long-
term and short-term relationships. Results indicate that women preferred a soldier high in
appetitive aggression as a short-term mate but not as a long-term relationship. This
preference for the "warrior" was higher for women in their fertile window of the menstrual
cycle. We conclude that women in their fertile window prefer men exhibiting higher
appetitive aggression as a short-term partner, revealing appetitive aggression in men may
serve as a signal for a higher genetic fitness.

lamentations of their women!
Khitan General: [Cheers]...That is good.
(From the movie: "Conan the Barbarian", 1982)
Evolution may have favored those who go to war (Elbert, Weierstall, and Schauer,
2010; Jones, 2008). If so, it is reasonable to assume that the partner preference of women
might have been decisive in this process. Indeed, it has frequently been noted that women
can be interested in "bad boys" (Urbaniak and Kilmann, 2006), dominant men (Sadalla,
Kenrick, and Vershure, 1987), or self-confident men in uniform (Hewitt and German,
1987). The parental investment of women is significantly higher than the investment of
men (Trivers, 1972). Therefore, women need to be selective when choosing a mating
partner. Apart from a man's resources, his signals of good gene quality (i.e., heritable
fitness) are essential in the selection process. Facial and body symmetry and a variety of
masculine physical and behavioral traits constitute male signals of good heritable condition
(Thornhill and Gangestad, 2008). For example, women find males with deeper voices
(Feinberg, Jones, Little, Burt, and Perrett, 2005), muscular bodies (Frederick and Haselton,
2007) and dominant behavior more attractive (Sadalla et al., 1987). However, the
preferences also depend on the time perspective of the relationship: Women maximize their
reproductive success if they choose a more masculine man as a short-term mate and a man
with a relatively more feminine face and a warmer, more agreeable personality (Fink and
Penton-Voak, 2002) as a stable long-term partner (Kruger, 2006). Consequently, men with
more masculine faces and bodies (Frederick and Haselton, 2007; Rhodes, Simmons, and
Peters, 2005) and more dominant behavior (Snyder, Kirkpatrick, and Barrett, 2008) have
greater success in short-term, but not in long-term, mating. Men who are warm, kind and
willing to invest considerable resources in their offspring are preferred as long-term mates
(Li, Bailey, Kenrick, and Linsenmeier, 2002). Utilization of this worthwhile strategy results
in both better genes in terms of assertiveness and more dynamic provision for the offspring.
Archer and Thanzami (2009) found in a sample of Indian men that young males who
perceive themselves as more attractive to women are more aggressive. Aggressive behavior
comes in two different types, a reactive­impulsive form which is thought to counter threat
and an appetitive form which results from the intrinsic rewarding properties of cues related
to violence, hunting, and combat (Elbert et al., 2010; Weierstall, Schaal, Schalinski,
Dusingizemung, and Elbert, 2011). Appetitive aggression is thus "motivated out of itself
from hunt and power: it is the aggression of the considerate aggressor, the hunter, the one
in power and it is the form of aggression hitherto seldom scientifically examined."
(Allwood, Bell-Dolan, and Husain, 2002; Elbert et al., 2010). We predict that appetitive
aggressiveness may signal heritable fitness in men. Therefore, we expect for women to
prefer men with sizeable scores in appetitive aggression as short-term, but not long-term,
mates.
In line with the aspect of reproduction, women's mate preferences change across the
menstrual cycle, and they are more selective during estrus than during other points in the
menstrual cycle. During their fertile period, women may particularly attend to men with
signals of "good genes" and select them as a short-term mate as opposed to a stable, long-
term partner (Thornhill and Gangestad, 2008). For example, women in their fertile window
Female attraction to appetitive-aggressive men

show differences in preferences when compared to women at non-fertile moments in their
cycles. Such differences include a preference for the scent of highly dominant men
(Havlicek, Roberts, and Flegr, 2005), more masculine male faces (Johnston, Hagel,
Franklin, Fink, and Grammer, 2001; Penton-Voak and Perrett, 2000; Penton-Voak et al.,
1999), men with lower pitched voices (Puts, 2005), and higher social presence and
intrasexual competitiveness as short-term mates (Gangestad, Simpson, Cousins, Garver-
Apgar, and Christensen, 2004). If appetitive aggression is a cue for heritable fitness in men,
we expect that women in their fertile period, compared to women in their non-fertile phase
of their menstrual cycle, will prefer men who experience pleasure in being violent as short-
term mates.
However, combatants that go to war or hunt are also exposed to a large number of
traumatic stressors that render them vulnerable to developing posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD; Elbert, Rockstroh, Kolassa, Schauer, and Neuner, 2006) and other forms of
psychopathology (Allwood et al., 2002; Elbert et al., 2009; Kolassa and Elbert, 2007;
Schaal and Elbert, 2006; Schaal, Jacob, Dusingizemungu, and Elbert, 2010). In line with
the hypothesis of an increased fitness of men who have a propensity to behave cruelly,
Weierstall and colleagues (2011; 2012) found evidence in various combatant populations
that appetitive aggression can be a resilience factor against PTSD. But how appealing are
men with trauma-related symptoms to women? Past research revealed an association
between PTSD symptoms and intimate relationship problems, such as discord, physical and
psychological aggression perpetration (Taft, Watkins, Stafford, Street, and Monson, 2011)
as well as partner's distress (Renshaw and Campbell, 2011). For the partners of traumatized
individuals, it is hard to deal with the altered behavior of the affected person. Men with
untreated and treated PTSD had significantly less sexual functioning in the domains of
desire, arousal, orgasm, activity and satisfaction compared to healthy controls (Kotler et al.,
2000). A study with 90 male combat veterans revealed that 80% experienced clinically
relevant sexual problems, mainly either impotence or premature ejaculation (Letourneau,
Schewe, and Frueh, 1997). Patients with PTSD show an elevated tonic level of cortisol
compared with traumatized controls without PTSD (McFarlane, Barton, Yehuda, and
Wittert, 2011; Steudte et al., 2011). Moore et al. (2011) found evidence that women rated
the faces of men having lower levels of cortisol as more attractive than the faces of men
with higher cortisol levels. This preference is higher during the fertile window of the
menstrual cycle compared to the luteal cycle phase. Persons with PTSD suffer in different
areas of their lives due to psychological illness. Because of their sexual difficulties and
relationship problems, we predicted that men with trauma symptoms would be less
attractive as either stable long-term partners or short-term partners for women.
In this study we examine the effect of fictional descriptions of different single men
on women. All single men were soldiers returning from war with different reactions to
violent experiences. Female participants had to evaluate the desirability of a soldier as a
long-term and short-term mate.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Female attraction to appetitive-aggressive men

1586 German women completed an online survey. Three control questions at the
end of the study checked whether the participant had read, understood and memorized the
description in detail. They had to pick one of four possible answers. The correct answer
was the exact wording from the text (see appendix). Women who did not correctly answer
all three questions were excluded from the data set. One thousand two hundred and twelve
women (mean age = 25.54 years, SD = 8.22) were in the final sample. Sixty six percent
were students, 24.8% employed, 5% in professional training and 3.8% job seeking. Seven
hundred thirty four women were in a relationship (e.g., married) and 476 were single. One
hundred fifty five women were mothers. Six hundred and six women used oral
contraceptives and 598 did not, and 8 did not respond to that question. Participants received
no financial compensation. All participants gave informed consent. The ethical review
board of the University of Konstanz approved the study.
Stimulus Material
Participants read a fictional scenario with the following content:
Germany becomes a target of a series of terrorist attacks of
Al Qaeda II with the consequence of increasing the number
of German military troops in Afghanistan. After a long, but
successful war, the combatants returned back home. One of
the returning soldiers is Wilko.
We chose the name "Wilko," an uncommon name in Germany, to ensure that
participants have no personal connection to this name. The fictional war scenario appeared
in this study because war is a situation in which traumatization is societally more accepted,
if not even anticipated, and appetitively violent experiences occur without necessarily
precipitating moral condemnation. Germany is not currently at war, thus requiring the
provision of a fictional scenario. We named the enemy Al Qaida II, because Al Qaida is a
well know terrorist group. It is generally agreed that this terrorist group poses a serious
danger to civilians and that it would be morally acceptable to use force in order to counter
this threat.
A description of Wilko followed (see appendix). Wilko was characterized as either
being high (conditions 1 and 2) or low (conditions 3 and 4) in appetitive aggression.
According to the descriptions, he would either have (conditions 1 and 3) or not have
(conditions 2 and 4) trauma symptoms. The descriptions were validated in a pretest sample
of 51 women (Age: M ± SD = 29.20 ± 10.01). Participants received a written explanation
about the disorder PTSD and appetitive aggression. Then they read one of four possible
Wilko descriptions. They had to decide if Wilko has PTSD, and if he is appetitively
aggressive on a 6-point Likert scale from 1 "not at all" to 6 "most intensive." The Wilko
descriptions were in conformity with the underlying constructs. The two descriptions of
Wilko with trauma symptoms were rated higher in PTSD symptoms than the two
descriptions of Wilko without trauma symptoms (trauma symptoms: M ± SD = 4.69 ± 1.05,
no trauma symptoms: M ± SD = 1.84 ± 1.17, t49
= 9.13, p < .001, d = 2.48), but had no
effect on the perception of Wilko as appetitively aggressive. The two descriptions of Wilko
with high appetitive aggression were rated higher in appetitive aggression than the two
descriptions of Wilko with low appetitive aggression (high appetitive aggression: M ± SD =
Female attraction to appetitive-aggressive men
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(1). 2013. -252-
4.07 ± 1.54, low appetitive aggression: M ± SD = 1.64 ± 0.91, t40.66
= 6.89, p < .001, d =
1.92), but had no effect on the PTSD perception of Wilko.
Measures
Attractiveness for different kinds of relationships. Participants had to consider
Wilko in terms of different kinds of desired relationships (date, steady boyfriend, life
partner, platonic friend, sexual affair, one night stand) on 7-point Likert scale from 0 "not
at all" to 6 "most intensive." For the factor desirability as a long-term mate, we
summarized the evaluation for Wilko desirability as a life partner and desirability as a
steady boyfriend. We summarized the evaluation for Wilko´s desirability as a sexual affair,
desirability as a one-night stand and the evaluation as "sexually attractive" (see next point
characterization) into the factor desirability as a short-term mate.
Characterization of the single man. Women rated the soldier along dimensions that
corresponded to those identified by Sadalla et al. (1987) using a 7-point semantic
differential which consists of the following adjectives: dominant/submissive, sexually
attractive/sexually unattractive, soft/hard, feminine/masculine, rugged/delicate,
tough/tender, bad/good, warm/cold, nice/awful, pleasant/unpleasant, friendly/aggressive,
unintelligent/intelligent, and healthy/ill. We used the rating "healthy/ill" as a manipulation
check for trauma symptoms and the mean value of the ratings for "submissive/dominant,
feminine/masculine, and friendly/aggressive" as manipulation check for appetitive
aggression.
Menstrual Cycle Analysis. To calculate the fertile window of each women, we took
into consideration the first day of her last menstrual cycle and the typical cycle length (M ±
SD = 27.51 ± 3.64). We estimated the fertile window of each woman, using an ovulation
calculator (http://www.umrechnung.org/eisprung-bestimmen-berechnen/zyklus-
eisprungkalender-fruchtbare-tage.htm). This calculator, based on medical data reported by
Wilcox, Duncan, Weinberg, Trussel, and Beired (2001), assumes a fertile window from day
12-17 in a 28 days cycle (women who have longer cycles tend to ovulate later in cycle).
The luteal phase was assumed to be 14 days, but we subtracted 13 days from the usual
cycle length to estimate the cycle day of ovulation as 13 days provide a less biased estimate
of the mean ovulation day (Trussell, Rodriguez, and Ellertson, 1998). We divided the
participants into three groups: fertile group - women who are in the follicular phase of their
cycle (n = 119), non-fertile group - women who are in other phases of their cycle (n = 440)
and oral contraceptives group - women who take oral contraceptives (n = 589). The
frequency distribution of fertile women in the different conditions was the following: 32
women received the description of Wilko with trauma symptoms and high appetitive
aggression, 26 women received the description of Wilko without trauma symptoms and
high appetitive aggression, 34 women received the trauma symptoms and low appetitive
aggression condition and 27 women received the condition without trauma symptoms and
low appetitive aggression of Wilko.
Procedure
The online-survey was conducted for five months, using the software Unipark
(www.unipark.de). It started with the informed consent, after which demographic variables
Female attraction to appetitive-aggressive men
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(1). 2013. -253-
were ascertained. Women had to indicate (a) the first day of their last menstruation, (b) the
use of birth control pills and (c) their typical cycle length. It was their task first to read the
terror attack/war scenario carefully and to try to visualize this situation as vividly as
possible. Then they were randomly assigned to one of the four possible characterizations of
Wilko and given the task to read and imagine the described veteran (nminimum
= 287, nmaximum
=
317 in every group). After that, they received the task to imagine being single and
meeting the single Wilko. Participants rated the desirability of Wilko for different
relationships and his characterization. Next, participants were asked to answer three control
questions concerning the written description. Four different response options were offered
for each question from which only one was the correct response. Participants could not go
back to the description of Wilko. Only participants providing three correct answers were
included in the final analyses.
Results
Manipulation Check
First we performed a manipulation check to prove whether the Wilko descriptions
were in conformity with the underlying constructs. Therefore, we analyzed the rating for
the dependent variable "healthy/ ill" for the single man with a 2 (trauma symptoms) x 2
(appetitively aggressive experiences of Wilko) between-groups ANOVA. For the variable
"health/illness," we found a significant main effect for the factor "traumatization of Wilko"
(F1,1212
= 130.65, p < .001, 2 = .098) but no main effect of the factor "appetitive aggression
of Wilko" and no interaction of either factor (p > .05). Women rated men presenting with
trauma symptoms as more ill than men without trauma symptoms (trauma symptoms: M ±
SD = 3.4 ± 1.54, no trauma symptoms: M ± SD = 2.4 ± 1.45). Then we analyzed the
dependent variable "appetitive aggression" for the single man with a 2 (trauma symptoms)
x 2 (appetitively aggressive experiences of Wilko) between-groups ANOVA. For the
variable "aggression/masculinity/dominance," we saw a significant main effect for the
factor "appetitive aggression of Wilko" (F1,1212
= 383.27, p <. 001, 2 = .24), but not a main
effect of the factor "traumatization of Wilko" and no significant interaction. Women rated
men high in appetitive aggression higher in aggression, masculinity and dominance than
men low in appetitive aggression (high appetitive aggression: M ± SD = 3.92 ± 0.83, low
appetitive aggression: M ± SD = 3.00 ± 0.97).
Results for ratings of long-term mate attractiveness
We analyzed the dependent variables "desirable as a long-term mate" for the single
man with a 2 (trauma symptoms of Wilko) x 2 (appetitively aggressive experiences of
Wilko) between-groups ANOVA. We found a significant main effect for the factor
"appetitively aggressive experiences" (F1,1208
= 79.22, p < .001, 2 = .07). Women rated a
man with fewer appetitively aggressive experiences as more desirable as a long-term mate
than a man who enjoys aggressive behavior. We found no significant main effect for the
factor "trauma symptoms of Wilko" and no significant interaction of the factors trauma
symptoms x appetitively aggressive experiences (see Figure 1). Women judged the
desirability of a long-term-mate of a man low in appetitive aggression higher if the man is
Female attraction to appetitive-aggressive men

not traumatized, compared to a man with trauma symptoms (man with trauma
symptoms/low appetitive aggression: M ± SD = 1.95 ± 1.56, man without trauma
symptoms/low appetitive aggression: M ± SD = 2.26 ± 1.74, t605.03
= 2.26, p = .024, d = .18)
Results for ratings of short-term mate attractiveness
We analyzed the dependent variables "desirable as a short-term mate" for the single
man with a 2 (trauma symptoms of Wilko) x 2 (appetitively aggressive experiences of
Wilko) between-groups ANOVA. For the factor "appetitively aggressive experiences," we
obtained a significant main effect (F1,1208
= 8.67, p = .003, 2 = .007). There was no
significant main effect for the factor trauma symptoms and no significant interaction of the
factors trauma symptoms x appetitively aggressive experiences. Women rated a man high
in appetitively aggressive experiences as more desirable as a short-term mate than a man
who does not enjoy aggressive behavior, but only if the man has no trauma symptoms (t599
= 2.55, p = .011, d = .21). The difference in the desirability of men with trauma symptoms
in regard to their appetitive aggression (high/low) is not significant (see Figure 1).

Note: Mean coefficients and standard errors for the men with or without trauma symptoms and with low or
high appetitive aggression in regard to their desirability as a long-term mate and short-term mate.
The effect of the menstrual cycle on long-term mate attractiveness rating
To detect whether women in different cycle phases and under artificial hormone
influence (oral contraceptives) favor different types of men as long-term mates, we
calculated a 2 (appetitive aggression) x 2 (trauma symptoms) x 3 (fertile/not fertile/oral
contraceptives) ANOVA with unequal cell frequencies. The type III computation of the
sum of squares was chosen. We found a main effect of the factor appetitive aggression
(F1,1136
= 52.05, p < .001, 2 = .044), but no other significant main effects or interactions
(see Figure 2). The difference between women in their fertile window and women not in
their fertile window for the man without trauma symptoms and high in appetitive
Female attraction to appetitive-aggressive men

aggression was not significant (t = 1.67, p = .097).

Note: Mean coefficients and standard errors for the different men in regard to their desirability as a long-term
mate. Rated by women in their fertile period (dark grey bars), non-fertile phase of their cycle (middle grey

The effect of the menstrual cycle and of oral contraceptives on short-term mate
attractiveness rating
To detect whether women in different cycle phases and under artificial hormone
influences (oral contraceptives) favor different types of men as short-term mates, we
calculated a 2 (appetitive aggression) x 2 (trauma symptoms) x 3 (fertile/no fertile/oral
contraceptives) ANOVA with unequal cell frequencies, and the type III computation of the
sum of squares was chosen. We found a main effect of the factor appetitive aggression
(F1,1135
= 19.03, p < .001, 2=.016) and a main effect of the factor fertile (F1,1135
= 5.31, p =
.005, 2 = .009) but no main effect for the factor trauma. We found a significant appetitive
aggression x fertile interaction (F2,1135
= 5.71, p = .003, 2 = .010) and a significant trauma x
appetitive aggression x fertile interaction (F2,1135
= 3.53, p = .029, 2 = .006) but no trauma
x fertile nor appetitive aggression x trauma interactions (see Figure 3).
Using a t-test for independent samples, we compared women in their fertile period
of the cycle to those not in their fertile window on their ratings of the condition no trauma
symptoms and high appetitive aggression of Wilko. We found a significant difference.
Women in their fertile phase of the menstrual cycle found a man with high appetitive
aggression more appealing as a short-term mate than women who are not in their fertile
window (fertile group: M ± SD = 3.74 ± 1.60, non- fertile group: M ± SD = 2.27 ± 1.71, t141
= 3.88, p <.001, d = .88).

Discussion
Results suggest that men high in appetitive aggression scores are sexually preferred
by women as short-term mates over those with a low score, particularly when the selector is
in her fertile phase of the menstrual cycle. This result coincides with other studies
demonstrating that typical, well-marked male attributes such as dominance and masculine
facial features are sexually preferred by women in their fertile window (e.g., Havlicek et
al., 2005; Penton-Voak and Perrett, 2000). When ovulating, women seem particularly
selective and sensitive for a range of distinct markers of male features (Thornhill and
Gangestad, 2008). This study indicates that not only the physical appearance but also
behavioral traits ­ in this case, appetitive aggression in combination with no trauma
symptoms ­ constitute signals for presumed genetic male fitness. Men who seek dominance
and find pleasure in aggression are not a profitable option for a stable relationship because
they pose a threat to the family, demonstrate less parental investment and engage in extra-
pair copulation (Marlowe, 1999). Consequently, as predicted, women in our study prefer
men with low appetitive aggression as a long-term mate. Instead of a more aggressive man,
a kinder, more sensitive man, might be a better option for a long-term mate (Buss and
Barnes, 1986; Li et al., 2002).
While men high in appetitive aggression are deemed the least attractive potential
long-term mates, regardless of the presence or absence of trauma symptoms, the presence
of trauma symptoms mediates the attractiveness of the men with low appetitive aggression.
Trauma symptoms in men with low appetitive aggression are evaluated as less attractive for
long-term relationships compared to men lacking trauma symptoms and low in appetitive
Female attraction to appetitive-aggressive men

aggression. Traumatized men with higher appetitive aggression scores are found to be as
attractive as similarly highly appetitively aggressive men lacking trauma symptoms. Men
behaving less brutally during war are seemingly perceived as more sensitive and are
therefore preferred. Appetitively aggressive men prove to be so strongly unattractive to
women for stable long-term relationships that additional trauma symptoms have no further
influence on the perception of a soldier. All in all, men without trauma symptoms and low
in appetitive aggression are the most preferred options among the ex-combatants as long-
term mates.
In this study women were tested once during their menstrual cycle. A within-
subjects design, in which the same women are tested multiple times at different points of
their cycle, might produce even greater effects owing to the control of inter-individual
variations. Another restriction of this study is that we did not ask the women if they cycled
regularly. Wilcox et al. (2001) showed that the likelihood of conception differ between
women with regular cycles and women with irregular cycles. Therefore it might be useful
to validate fertility hormone levels in future studies. Fictional descriptions of the different
types of men we presented may limit the information value of our findings. However, the
investigation of desirability of real men with/without expression of traumatization and
low/high appetitive aggression might be distorted by many confounding variables. The
advantage of this study is the standardization of the stimulus material, a large sample size
and control questions ensuring participant attention to detail.
Conclusion
The present investigation indicates that appetitive aggression in men may serve as a
signal for high genetic fitness. Appetitive aggression enhanced the desirability of a short-
term mate especially for women in their fertile window. Men with a combination of high
appetitive aggression and lacking trauma symptoms are the most desirable option as short-
term mates. However, aggressiveness decreased the desirability as a long-term mate,
whereas a partner with a low drive for aggressive behavior may be the better option.

Appendix
Scenarios:
Wilko, condition1 (with trauma symptoms, high appetitive aggression):
Wilko is a very friendly, caring and attractive young man. He was trained in close
combat and sent to the northeast of Afghanistan. After his return from the war zone, many
things are different. Wilko is vigilant and careful. At night he often wakes, bathed in sweat.
He becomes frightened when he hears unexpected noises, he is easily irritated and
sometimes has trouble concentrating. Wilko only talks to his closest relatives about his war
experiences. He fondly remembers the time when he hunted and defeated the enemy in
close combat. He wanted to defend his country, his family and future generations. The
memory of the bloody injuries and pain that he inflicted on the enemy, confirms him in his
self-image of being a good combatant.
Wilko, condition 2 (without trauma symptoms, high appetitive aggression):
Wilko is a very friendly, caring and attractive young man. He was trained in close
combat and sent to the northeast of Afghanistan. After his return from the war zone his
behavior returns to its normal civilian routine. Wilko has integrated himself back into
everyday life very quickly and sets himself new goals for his profession and private life. He
is balanced and able to sleep well, despite unpleasant memories. He particularly enjoys
spending time with friends and takes pleasure in a range of different activities. Wilko only
talks to his closest relatives about his war experiences. He fondly remembers the time when
he hunted and defeated the enemy in close combat. He wanted to defend his country, his
family and future generations. The memory of the bloody injuries and pain that he inflicted
the enemy, confirms him in his self-image of being a good combatant.
Wilko, condition 3 (with trauma symptoms, low appetitive aggression):
Wilko is a very friendly, caring and attractive young man. He was trained in close
combat and sent to the northeast of Afghanistan. After his return from the war zone many
things were different. Wilko is vigilant and careful. At night he often wakes up bathed in
sweat. He becomes frightened when he hears unexpected noises, he is irritated easily and
sometimes has trouble concentrating. Wilko only talks to his closest relatives about his war
experiences. When he speaks about it, it is obvious that he only fought because that was his
job and he had to follow orders. He had to defend his country, his family and future
generations, and he had to act in accordance to this duty. He would prefer to erase the
memories of the bloody injuries and pain that he inflicted upon the enemy.
Wilko, condition 4 (without trauma symptoms, low appetitive aggression):
Wilko is a very friendly, caring and attractive young man. He was trained in close
combat and sent to the northeast of Afghanistan. After his return from the war zone his
behavior returns to its normal civilian routine. Wilko has integrated himself back into
everyday life very quickly and sets himself new goals for his profession and private life. He
is balanced and able to sleep well, despite unpleasant memories. He particularly enjoys
