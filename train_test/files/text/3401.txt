Introduction
Disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR)
describes a cluster of post-conflict interventions that is
focused on collecting arms, neutralizing combatants, reinte-
grating legitimate ex-combatants into the armed forces or
civilian life, and preventing a return to armed conflict (Pugel,
2009). DDR has been used and has achieved some level of
success in mitigating armed conflicts and sustaining peace in
many conflict-ridden countries, including Rwanda, DR
Congo, Uganda, Ethiopia, Somalia, Sierra Leone, Liberia,
Russia, India, and Bosnia-Herzegovina (Banholzer, 2014;
Blattman & Annan, 2008; Muggah, 2009; Pietz, 2004;
Rolston, 2007). In 2009, the Nigerian government under late
President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua established the Niger Delta
Amnesty Program (NDAP), which is Nigeria's version of
DDR, in an effort to mitigate the violence that had racked the
region since the early 2000s.
The violence in the region is a result of many related factors,
especially what Michael Ross (1999, 2001) calls the "resource
curse" debacle, which describes a rentier culture where
resource-rich countries like Nigeria condition themselves
(or are conditioned) to depend exclusively on rents and royal-
ties from a natural resource such as oil as a result of which they
lose (or withhold) the initiative to govern responsibly, includ-
ing failing to initiate programs for the economic and social
development of their countries or people. Ross (1999) suggests
that the resource curse has inspired violence in the delta through
its "repression" and "modernization" effects. In terms of the
former, the Nigerian government through its direct control of
huge oil assets is able to bankroll excessive military expendi-
tures that are deployed aggressively against opposition to oil
excavation or the warped distribution of oil revenue, inspiring
defiance among a segment of the population. In terms of the
modernization effect, oil revenue/profit forces the state and its
corporate allies to focus on energy sector jobs to the detriment
of other sectors, especially agriculture thereby making poverty,

The Niger Delta Amnesty Program: The
Challenges of Transitioning From Peace
Settlements to Long-Term Peace
Benjamin A. Okonofua1,2
Abstract
The armed conflict between militias and government forces in Nigeria's Niger Delta region has spanned for more than two
decades, defying all solutions. A disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) program was established in August
2015 in effort to end the violence and has remained in place. It is a radically different approach from past approaches that
displayed zero tolerance to all political challenges to oil production or the allocation of oil profits. The approach appeared to
be immediately successful in that it forced a ceasefire, engaged militants in planned programs to rehabilitate and reintegrate
them into civilian society, and opened up the oil wells (many of which had been shut due to the crisis) with the effect of
increasing government revenue, which depends 85% on oil exports. Yet, few studies have attempted to understand the
dynamics within the country that are responsible for the design and implementation of this broad policy shift or to understand
whether and how the current initiative is able to end the conflict and institute peace beyond the short term. This study,
therefore, is important because it provides a critical perspective that anticipates and explains emerging issues with the Niger
Delta Amnesty Program, which have implications for DDR adaptation and implementation all over the world. Ultimately, the
research demonstrates how the DDR program both transforms the Niger Delta conflict and becomes embroiled in intense
contestations not only about the mechanism for transforming the targeted population but also whether and how the program
incorporates women who are being deprioritized by the program.

unemployment, and food insufficiency mobilizing logics of
cult gangs and politicians, leading to large scale violence.
Thus, oil and gas wealth has become a curse in Nigeria
due to the social, economic, and political instability as well
as policy failures they engender (Robinson, 2006). For
example, from 1970 to 1999, oil constituted between 21%
and 48% of gross domestic product (GDP) and generated
about $231 billion USD for the Nigerian economy.. Between
2000 and 2004, oil accounted for 79.5% of total government
revenue and about 97% of foreign exchange (United Nations
Development Programme, 2006). Yet, the increase in oil
wealth did not translate into improved standard of living for
Nigerians, especially people of the Niger Delta. Instead,
increases in poverty and inequality rates coincide with the
discovery of oil and with increases in oil production and oil
earnings. According to Sala-i-Martin and Subramanian
(2003), in 1965 when oil revenue was about $33 per capita,
GDP per capita was $245. But in 2000 when oil revenue had
increased to $325 per capita, GDP per capita remained at the
1965 value of $245. Similarly, in terms of purchasing power
parity (PPP), Nigeria's per capita GDP was $1,113 in 1970
but had fallen to $1,084 by 2000. Higgins (2009) argues that
evidence such as this leads to the conclusion that Nigeria had
suffered from the "resource curse." Waste, corruption, fiscal
irresponsibility, political instability, and poor policy formu-
lation and implementation had become the legacies of the
country's globally acclaimed oil wealth and the veneer of the
protracted violence in the delta region.
The issue of resource curse also encapsulates the tension
between environmental security, resources, politics, and vio-
lence in the delta. Generally, interest in the environment and
conflict concatenates around two antiquated ideas: demo-
graphically induced scarcity and environmental agency.
Since the 1990s, there has been a dramatic increase in inter-
est in the environment as a source of political conflict and as
the Cold War security problematic (M. Watts, Okonta, &
Kemedi, 2004). Interest in these issues peaked after the pub-
lication of Tad Homer-Dixon's (1999) "Environment,
Scarcity and Violence," Robert Kaplan's (2000) "The
Coming Anarchy," and Michael Klare's (2001) "Resource
Wars." These works and many others which focus on the
environment raise questions concerning environmental deg-
radation, rehabilitation, and conservation. For example,
Kaplan in "The Coming Anarchy" suggested that Africa is
affected by severe environmental changes that results from
improper exploitation of natural resource wealth. These
changes or "eco-demographic" pressures from oil spills,
have impoverished, undernourished, and encouraged ordi-
nary people, many of whom were displaced from farmlands,
to engage in egregious acts of violence.
Similarly, Khan (1994), Karl (1997), and Coronil (1997)
have examined polities dominated by oil revenue and the
mechanisms through which rent-seeking produce what M.
Watts et al. (2004) call "petrol regimes." M. Watts et al. (2004),
for example, observe that oil rent in Nigeria have historically
sustained a "parasitic ruling elite" and enabled the state to
fraudulently purchase political consent from exploited minori-
ties while maintaining the "delicate northern hegemony within
a competitive multi-ethnic polity" (p. 4). Consent is obtained
through a derivation principle that distributes oil rents and roy-
alties to states, and this is complicated by massive institutional
corruption. Related to this is Paul Collier's (2000) "predation"
argument in which he suggests that oil-resource dependency
encourages and enables powerful people to prey on oil assets
and oil revenue, becoming the basis of the protracted violence
in the delta. It is the opportunity or feasibility of predation by
both governments and militias that inspires violence and
ensures that conflicts are never fully resolved.
Finally, ethnicity, particularly the mobilization of ethnic
identity has frequently added fuel to the delta conflict.
Studies by Mamdani (2000) and M. Watts et al. (2004) sug-
gest a relationship between Nigeria's post-colonial political
structure and the Niger Delta violence. The studies highlight
the role that a large (and expanding) federal government,
severely weakened states, over-indulged ethnic majorities,
and marginalized ethnic minorities play in the delta conflict.
For example, Mamdani suggests that cultural indigeneity has
become the basis of ethnicity and identifies the multiple
ways by which ethnicity is invented and reinvented within
the arena of oil politics, often leading to conflict. M. Watts
et al. suggest that local forms of community and the mobili-
zation of ethnic identity within these communities have been
critical components of the social relations of oil extraction.
The way that these relations are forged, negotiated, and
reconfigured (including land use and reform, customary
laws, territoriality, contact with oil companies, and forms of
identification: ethnicity, gender, age, chieftaincy, and clan-
ship) and particularly linkages to forms of traditional author-
ity and locally specific forms of capitalist development, have
played important roles in the delta's conflict landscape.
The above factors as well as others produced a new type of
resistance movement in the delta. Whereas in the past, resis-
tance to oil production took the form of ideological struggle,
aimed at both deconstructing and reconstructing mainstream
ideas about the state, the delta's people and resources, and the
logics of oil wealth appropriation and distribution; the new
resistance movement is existentialist, showcasing not just the
visceral antipathy of the people toward the governance
motions of the state but also the location of militias, their
sponsors, and members in the entrenched, convoluted rent-
seeking distributional coalitions that privilege individuals and
groups that are proximate to the political state. Unlike the past
resistance that was led by intellectuals like the late Kenule
Saro-Wiwa, the Ogoni playwright and activist who was judi-
cially murdered by the Sani Abacha military junta, and which
targeted the state, oil majors, and the broader system of mer-
cantile capitalism, the new resistance is led by cult gangs in
alliance with politicians and target the state, oil majors, rival
cult gangs, and anyone who poses a threat to their clandestine
interests. Irrespective of who the target of the new resistance
Okonofua 3
is, the armed struggle produced, within relatively brief com-
pass, countless deaths as well as unquantifiable economic and
social losses (Okonofua, 2011, 2013).
Considering the above and in response to the apparent
intractibility of the violence, the government of President
Yar'Adua believed that the continued deployment of soldiers
and reliance on force to subdue opposition to the prevailing
oil regime, including the system of production (that indis-
criminately pollutes the delta ecology), allocation of oil min-
ing rights (that discriminates against delta communities), and
distribution of oil revenues and profits (that increased the
visceral hate for oil majors and the government among local
people), would be ineffectual. In place of force, the govern-
ment established the NDAP: a comprehensive system of dia-
logue, rehabilitation, and development. Specifically, the
NDAP will demilitarize the Niger Delta by encouraging
militias to surrender their arms and weapons, break the links
between fighters and their militias, reintegrate fighters into
civil society by providing them with appropriate social skills,
provide direly needed but sorely lacking social and economic
infrastructure for the entire region, and restore full oil pro-
duction activities in the Niger Delta to avoid the looming
national economic disaster. The NDAP commenced on
August 6, 2009, and was expected to and has been eagerly
touted as helping to end or significantly reduce the violence
(Ajibola, 2015; Ikoh & Ukpong, 2013; Oluduro & Oluduro,
2012; Sayne, 2013). But the question is, has the NDAP truly
ended or significantly reduced the violence?
From the start, the program was conceptualized as a one-
stop shop for all activities related to restoring peace to the
troubled region. With this broad agenda, however, came enor-
mous ambiguity about the specific purposes, processes,
mechanisms, and expected outcomes of the program. The
ambiguity or lack of clarity was exacerbated by the govern-
ment's apparent failure to incorporate mechanisms or a strat-
egyforassessingtheprogram'sperformanceandeffectiveness,
which is a major deficit considering that ambiguous strategic
planning throughout a programming and implementation
cycle may undermine desired outcomes (Pugel, 2009). This
study is conceived as a sort of post-hoc corrective of this defi-
cit by using survey results of program participants as proxy to
systematically assess the performance of the NDAP. This will
reveal existing gaps between outputs and outcomes, if they
exist. More specifically, the study moves beyond what Pugel
(2009:70) describes as the "paradigmatic benchmark of DDR
success," which determines DDR success by whether or not a
state relapses into war, to focus on whether the program
addresses the conditions of dual or multiple sovereignty
(Tilly, 1973) that gave rise to the violence in the first place.
There are several reasons why this approach is important.
First, research in social psychology and anthropology shows
congruence between reintegration success and several factors,
including exposure to violence (Dyregrov, Jested, & Rundle,
2002; Husain et al., 1998), age (Richards, Archibald, Bah, &
Vincent, 2003), and gender (Mazurana, McKay, Carlson, &
Kasper, 2002). Beyond these, however, scholars who have
reviewed the literature on demobilization and reintegration are
yet to find systematic theories about the conditions under
which some combatants but not others will give up their arms
and reintegrate into civilian life (Humphreys & Weinstein,
2009). In particular, most efforts to engage the Niger Delta
violence have been largely partisan, sensational, emotional,
and lacking in empirical and theoretical depth; making it
almost impossible to contextualize both the violence and the
NDAP or to give the issues theoretical nuance. This study uses
John Paul Lederach's (1997) conflict transformation theory to
explain the extent (and conditions) of the NDAP success as
well as to frame the general conditions and contributions of
DDR interventions in building peace in conflicted African
communities.
Second, while selective amnesties like the NDAP are used
indiscriminately to form terms of peace settlements and to
keep societies racked by armed conflict from slipping back
into conflict (Collier et al., 2003; Doyle & Sambanis, 2000;
Muggah, 2009), there is great skepticism about their perfor-
mance in the broader scheme of things, especially given the
potential for uneven, short term, and/or unsystematic fund-
ing and engagement of these programs. Because of these
concerns, there is clearly the need for a thoughtful examina-
tion of the NDAP to document what elements operating
within or outside of the program contributed to the observed
outcomes, which can provide lessons that may support or
improve the implementation of this or similar programs. This
would offer the best opportunity, yet, for developing distinc-
tive theoretical and practical approaches required to effec-
tively end resource-based conflicts, build sustainable peace,
and enable the integrated development of communities
affected by armed conflict all over Africa.
Finally, the violence, which appeared to abate immedi-
ately following the implementation of the NDAP, has steadily
resurfaced, especially in the offshore and many believe that
with the outcome of Nigeria's 2015 presidential election,
which did not favor Goodluck Jonathan, the incumbent who
is from the region, the violence will resurface on a grand
scale. It has, with the Niger Delta Avengers blowing up pipe-
lines and sabotaging oil assets, critically impacting the coun-
try's oil output. Yet, the NDAP was conceptualized and
idealized as the long-term solution for the delta "problem"
that will survive any presidential administration. In addition,
managers of the program as well as top officials of the
Nigerian government have been enthusiastically celebrating
the "wonderful" successes of the program, which others,
especially opponents of the Jonathan government criticize as
a huge drain on the country's resources and incapable of
delivering the type of outcomes attributed to it. Considering
the above, but especially the vast contributions of time,
money, and resources invested by the Nigerian government
and other stakeholders in efforts to entrench long-standing
peace in the delta, this study is tremendously important as it
offers a means to understand how and where the investments
4 SAGE Open
are being applied as well as whether or not the intervention is
achieving the impact in the community that the government
and other stakeholders desire.
Theoretical Framing
This analysis of the NDAP may be discussed theoretically
under the sign of conflict transformation. The theory offers a
framework to discuss not only the cause(s) of the Niger Delta
conflict but also the appropriate mechanisms for changing
the complex conflict dynamics of the delta. Using this
approach, it is trite to perceive the NDAP as being wedged in
the middle of a major conceptual rift: a historical legacy of
ecological abuse mixed with structural violence that has
spurred enormous rage, protests, and violence, and the need
for order in light of contemporary realities, especially dwin-
dling oil revenue and the potential impact of the delta vio-
lence on Nigeria's economic and political stability. For the
NDAP to produce long-standing peace, it must anticipate and
engage the host of forces, including crescive structural fis-
sures that gave rise to the conflict in the first place.
Conflict transformation theory is relatively new in the field
of peacebuilding. However, the core of the theory draws on
many of the familiar concepts of conflict management and
conflict resolution. Because of its ideological linkage to these,
conflict transformation is not entirely seen as a new approach
but as a re-conceptualization of the field to make it more rele-
vant to contemporary conflict situations (Miall, 2004). This
re-conceptualization is imperative due to changes in the nature
of contemporary conflicts. For example, most contemporary
conflicts occur within national boundaries impelled asymmet-
rically by structural conditions, including inequities of power
and resource appropriation and distribution. Also, as Smith
(2004) observes, many contemporary conflicts are protracted
and marked by sporadic periods of violence and peace. In this
case, conflict occurs in waves--rising precipitously until some
accommodation is reached and then falling off dramatically
(almost to the point that there is a marked absence of conflict)
and then rising again. Protracted conflicts not only upset social
equilibriums but also ultimately distort society, creating com-
plex emergencies.
The conflict transformation approach embodies three dis-
tinct theoretical motions: conflict management (Bloomfield
& Reilly, 1998), conflict resolution (Deutsch & Coleman,
2000), and conflict transformation (Lederach, 1995). Conflict
management has been defined by Bloomfield and Reilly
(1998) as the
positive and constructive handling of difference and divergence.
Rather than advocating methods for removing conflict . . .
addresses the more realistic question of managing conflict: how
to deal with it in a constructive way, how to bring opposing sides
together in a cooperative process, how to design a practical,
achievable, cooperative system for the constructive management
of differences. (p. 18)
For theorists and practitioners working within this tradi-
tion, violent conflicts result from differences in values and
interests embedded within the structure of society. Because
these differences are entrenched within macro and micro
social structures--historical experiences, institutional rela-
tionships, resource appropriation and distribution, existing
power coalitions, racism/ethnicity/tribalism, egos, and so
on--they cannot be eradicated. The best society can do is to
manage the conflict and prevent it from escalating in such a
way that it potentially disrupts the smooth running of society.
Occasionally, as Miall (2004) points out, it may be possible
to arrive at a historic compromise resulting in the temporary
abandonment or suspension of violence to allow peace to
thrive temporarily. The goal of conflict management, there-
fore, is to achieve political settlements leveraging the
resources of certain key actors that are powerful enough to
exert pressure on the conflicting parties to settle or to guide
the inevitable conflict into appropriate channels.
Conflict resolution theory, unlike conflict management
theory, focuses on intervention by skilled but powerless third
parties operating outside of the political system who enable
conflicting parties to understand, explore, analyze, question,
reframe, and synthesize their positions and interests. Theorists
working within this tradition denounce the systemic approach
of conflict management theorists as ineffectual and incapable
of resolving conflicts because they ignore the communal and
identity depths from which conflicts spring. They argue that
people involved in identity-based conflicts are often unwilling
to negotiate compromise; instead, the roots of the conflict
must be explored to evolve creative resolutions that the con-
flicting parties may have missed due to their previously
entrenched positions. Therefore, conflict resolution essentially
involves helping the parties of conflict to transition from zero-
sum destructive engagements to positive-sum outcomes
(Deutsch & Coleman, 2000). Lederach (2003) has criticized
this approach because of the sense of "definitiveness" or
"finality" about it and because its language "implies finding a
solution to a problem." Thus, instead of building "something
that is desired," it fixates on "ending something that is not
desired" (p.17). Conflict transformation focuses on how to
build the type of peace that all stakeholders desire.Thus, con-
flict transformation extends conflict management and conflict
resolution theories beyond the mere reframing of positions
and the identification of positive outcomes to include concern
with creating a new system, process, or approach that consoli-
dates and leverages the gains from ending a conflict into build-
ing peace. Defined by Lederach (2003) as envisioning and
responding to "the ebb and flow of social conflict as life-giv-
ing opportunities for creating constructive change processes
that reduce violence, increase justice in direct interaction and
social structures, and respond to real-life problems in human
relationships" (p. 18), it investigates the nature of the conflict-
ing parties, including their operational structures, historical
experiences, and relationships that extend conflicts beyond
Okonofua 5
specific sites. According to Miall (2004), it is a "process of
engaging with and transforming the relationships, interests,
discourses, and, if necessary, the very constitution of society
that supports the continuation of violent conflict." By interro-
gating and affecting these domains (i.e., both episodes of con-
flict such as the actual fighting and the epicenter of conflict
such as the web of relational patterns, including the history of
lived episodes from which new episodes of conflict emerge),
conflicts may be transformed from their virulent, destructive
form to situations amenable to all conflicting parties.
I use the principle components of the conflict transforma-
tion theory to evaluate the NDAP in order to determine
whether it is able to transcend the delta's conflict episodes and
interrogate the epicenter or the core of the conflict. The enor-
mity of the forces at play in the delta, especially the region's
strategic importance to global energy production and the costs
of the NDAP intervention, demands this type of assessment.
Literature Review
Origin of the NDAP
The Niger Delta region, the heart of Nigeria's oil production
activities, is one of the most diverse regions in the world in
terms of human, animal, and plant life (Okonofua, 2013). The
region covers a distance of about 270 miles along the Atlantic
Coast and stretches for about 120 miles inland, and is
described as the largest wetland in Africa and the second larg-
est in the world after the Mississippi. The region also contains
the largest oil deposits in Africa and some of the highest qual-
ity oil in the world. It is the delta's oil, which indubitably has
unprecedented economic and geo-strategic significance and
value (M. Watts et al., 2004) and associated relationships,
especially being the mainstay of the Nigerian economy (Ikein,
1990; Khan, 1994; P. Watts, 2000) that dominated discussions
about the region, at least, until the early 2000s.
Since 1956 when oil was first discovered in commercial
quantities in Oloibiri, a small rural community in Bayelsa
state, an estimated US$1 trillion has been generated from oil
exports not including the many billions generated clandes-
tinely from the illegal trade in stolen crude (Okonofua, 2013).
Yet, the region is one of the most polluted in the world with
daily oil spills, the size of the Exxon-Valdez oil disaster in the
United States as well as effluent deliberately discharged into
the environment, polluting the delta's ecology and killing
fauna, fish species, and land animals and dramatically reduc-
ing the region's limited stock of arable land. This situation has
dislocated millions of local peoples from the local industry
(typically farming and fishing) and displaced millions more
who are forced to migrate to cities where they have limited
skills and resources to survive. Thrust correspondingly into
artificial dependent and unproductive relationships in urban
shanties and hyperghettoized neighborhoods, millions of the
delta's people, who are some of the poorest people in the
world, have developed low self-worth and fatalistic attitudes
that lend themselves to the violent defiance of constituted
authority. On some occasions, the defiance has acted out as
manipulative violence against social objects, especially per-
sons in identical conditions of miserable poverty. Thus, it is
the unremitting economic, political, social, and environmen-
tal marginality of the people that is the veneer for the militia
violence in the Niger Delta. The fight, arguably over control
of oil resources, lucrative oil contracts, illicit patronages, and
correspondingly stupendous wealth, has come to replace the
delta's significance as an oil-bearing region in global head-
lines and in discussions about the region.
Between 2002 and 2009, the Delta became what John
Keane (1996) calls a "zone of violence," which describes a
gradual but precipitous slide into what the U.S. State
Department calls "political chaos." M. Watts et al. (2004)
argue that the chaos strikes at the heart of Nigeria's politi-
cal future; a future blighted by unmitigated environmental
disaster, dilapidated infrastructure, unremitting poverty
and disease, huge debt burden, and legacy of mismanage-
ment and corruption. The human costs of the conflict,
including loss of life, socio-economic disparity, rising gen-
der inequality, educational decline, high levels of poverty
and disease, and many less tangible costs, have been very
high. Also, because of the violence, an estimated 750,000
barrels of crude oil out of the nation's daily supply of 2.2
million barrels were shut in, and more than 300,000 bpd
(or barrels per day) were deliberately discharged into the
environment, further depleting the fragile eco-system of
the Niger Delta.
It was ostensibly to cut the oil losses and the corresponding
steep decline in revenue that the Nigerian government, under
the leadership of late President Shehu Musa Yar'Adua inaugu-
rated the NDAP. The president's move may have been nothing
more than a pacifist strategy designed only to guarantee access
to the delta oil wells, shore up oil revenues, and mitigate some
of the human costs of the conflict, and not toward any mean-
ingful long-term solution to the violence. In exchange for a sur-
render of arms and a pledge to end the fighting, combatants
were to receive amnesty (or freedom from prosecution), reha-
bilitation, and reintegration into civilian society. In addition,
the government was to institute an elaborate program of politi-
cal and social reforms and economic reconstruction, a huge
departure from its prior zero tolerance policy to all legitimate or
illegitimate challenges to the authority of the political state.
The government's reversal of its policy of non-negotiation,
which may have been informed by mounting evidence (Collier,
Hoeffler, & Rohner, 2006; Humphreys & Weinstein, 2009;
Lederach, 1997; Muggah, 2009; Ukeje, Odebiyi, Sesay, &
Aina, 2009) that traditional approaches and instruments for
dealing with intra-state armed conflicts are inadequate or too
ill-suited to effectively address the multifaceted causes of these
conflicts, especially in deeply divided states like Nigeria, is
certainly refreshing, but opens up debate about what specific
interventions may now be applied successfully to reverse the
delta violence.

DDR Interventions and the Challenge of
Peacebuilding
Although many organizations, including multilateral and
bilateral agencies, continue to prioritize democracy and gover-
nance as key to long-term stability in Africa, many shorter
term mechanisms for conflict prevention and peacebuilding
are assuming growing importance (Muggah, 2009). Selective
amnesties, smart sanctions, and interventions such as DDR are
increasingly being used to form terms for peace, to keep post-
conflict societies from slipping back into conflict, and to stim-
ulate economic growth and development (Doyle & Sambanis,
2000). Paradoxically, as investments in such conflict preven-
tion and peacebuilding initiatives are growing, there are
increasing doubts about whether they are capable of achieving
the outcomes desired or the successes attributed to them. For
example, critics claim that DDR programs are too often nar-
rowly conceived, inflexible, technocratic, bureaucratic, and
detached from the political transition or broader recovery and
reconstruction strategies (Muggah, 2009). Because of these
concerns, scholars seek more evidence that DDR can achieve
what is expected and often is ascribed to it. Although Collier
and Hoeffler (2004), Berdala (1996), and Muggah (2009)
argue that the chances for DDR success increase when they
are undertaken in collaboration between national governments
and national and international agencies, the reality is that
many interventions are planned and implemented locally or
nationally without input from critical segments of society.
From a political economy perspective, DDR encapsulates
the strategic and bureaucratic priorities of the security and
development sectors of a state. Because of this, Nigeria's
adoption of DDR to solve the perennial Niger Delta violence
ought to stimulate discourse about the policy priorities of the
Nigerian government and particularly its political class or
governing elites toward genuinely addressing the structural
challenges of the delta. If according to Duffield (2007), DDR
is at the heart of neo-liberal forms of power and governance,
how is the Nigerian government using the NDAP to alter the
conflict dynamics of the delta, including providing visibility
for a government that is mostly absent except when extract-
ing rent or as part of a "broader `Weberian' project of secur-
ing the legitimate control of force" from combatants on
behalf of the state (Muggah, 2009, p. 2)?
Contemporary DDR approaches typically consist of a
series of carefully designed and phased activities aimed at
creating a suitable environment that would encourage stabil-
ity and development. Advocates of DDR believe that the
three components of the program (disarmament, demobiliza-
tion, and reintegration) interlock and are mutually reinforcing
activities. Disarmament has been defined as the collection of
small arms, ammunition, explosives, and light and heavy
weapons from combatants and at times from civilians with
the goal of reducing the number of weapons in circulation
(Nillson, 2005; United Nations [UN], 1999). Because the
relinquishing of weapons, which are typically tied to the
identity of the combatant is often traumatic for combatants,
the disarmament process is first and foremost a confidence-
building exercise (Hithcock, 2004). DDR advocates argue
that disarmament is a critically important component of
peacebuilding, but emphasize the generation of visible and
tangible evidence of success in terms of arms and munitions
collected. Yet, they recognize that this component alone is
incapable of providing the desired outcomes and must be
complemented with parallel activities such as demobilization,
reintegration, economic reconstruction, confidence and secu-
rity enhancing activities, and the promotion of democracy
and the rule of law (Muggah, 2009; Spear, 2006). Although,
disarmament when undertaken with concrete verification
mechanisms and when arms are actually destroyed has the
potential for building confidence in the peace process among
belligerents, it is more beneficial for ex-combatants due to
improved socio-economic and political conditions to abandon
their desire to acquire weapons to press their demands.
Demobilization on its own, like disarmament, can poten-
tially generate unintentional security dilemmas (Collier &
Hoeffler, 2004). Demobilization is seen as the process of dis-
connecting combatants from their armed groups or units or
significantly reducing the number of combatants serving in
armed units (Berdala, 1996; Hithcock, 2004; Nillson, 2005)
with the objective of giving back to the state its monopoly of
violence. Governments emerging from war frequently demo-
bilize ex-combatants from their militias before reintegrating
them into the military or civilian communities. Yet, demobi-
lization is often misunderstood and implemented as a substi-
tute for disarmament. Thus, when governments have
disarmed ex-combatants, they have construed this as demo-
bilizing them when, in fact, the ex-combatant remained
firmly imbedded in their organizations and the structures
used by these organizations to create violence. In this sense,
it becomes even more challenging for the state to achieve full
reintegration of ex-combatants because reintegration may
only occur after ex-combatants have been disarmed and
demobilized from their prior militias or from the individuals
that were part of those militias. There is high possibility that
ex-combatants who remained partially organized within their
existing command structures can play the role of peace spoil-
ers as happened in Sierra Leone in 2000. In some cases,
Knight and Ozerdam (2004) suggested that ex-combatants
unintentionally reinforced latent command structures, espe-
cially when precautions to prevent this from happening were
not adopted in advance. In contrast, if ex-combatants were
too hastily demobilized especially when the process failed to
adequately dismantle command and control structures as
happened in Angola, they could trigger insecurity in the
communities of return (Spear, 2006).
Reintegration, which is defined as the political, economic,
and social integration of ex-combatants, their families, and pri-
mary support network into civil society (Nillson, 2005), is a
critically important component of DDR interventions and takes
several forms: political integration (in which ex-combatants,
Okonofua 7
their families, and support structure become part of the deci-
sion-making process of their communities); economic integra-
tion (in which ex-combatants, their families, and support
system are enabled to develop their livelihoods); social integra-
tion (in which local communities accept ex-combatants, their
families, and primary support system as members of the com-
munity). Muggah (2009) argues that the challenges accompa-
nying reintegration into either category are immense.
Depending on the context, the process is often heavily politi-
cized and the absorptive capacities of communities for civilian
reintegration are often greatly limited (Azam, Bevan, & Collier,
1994). Conventional DDR, therefore, envisions a continuum
that extends from a narrow minimalist (establishing security) to
a broad maximalist (incorporating development) perspective
(Jennings, 2008). The minimalist approach, according to
Muggah (2009), is "focused on expedience, where the program
aspires less to creating a lasting impact on the lives of ex-com-
batants and more to time-limited gains" (p. 23) such as remov-
ing weapons, cantoning ex-combatants, and generally fulfilling
the terms of peace agreements. Although the broad strategic
goals of the minimalist approach includes reducing the likeli-
hood that war will occur, the micro objectives focus on de-link-
ing the command and control of armed groups. In contrast, the
maximalist approach "implies a more ambitious, transforma-
tive reintegrative agenda" (Muggah, 2009, p. 23) to include
more ambitious interventions. They seek not only to rehabili-
tate ex-combatants but also to reinforce public institutions and
their legitimacy by promoting markets, property rights, and
socio-economic and political infrastructures. Maximalist
approaches are able to achieve the goals partly by redressing
distortions in state spending and promoting policies and activi-
ties that stimulate economic growth and enhance human capac-
ities and endowments.
But despite the great enthusiasm about DDR, especially
its utility in conflict prevention or post-conflict intervention,
a body of critical literature that questions and challenges core
DDR assumptions is emerging (Jennings, 2008; Pouligny,
2004). A major concern is that DDR glosses over the com-
plexity of conflict and programs or interventions are artifi-
cially grafted onto volatile conflict and post-conflict
societies. Case studies (Humphreys & Weinstein, 2009;
Pugel, 2009), for example, demonstrate the genuine risks
that accompany the imposition of DDR interventions from
the top, especially if they are divorced from the political,
social, and economic context in which violence or conflict is
imbedded. Muggah (2009) suggests that DDR is "too often
resorted to in a knee-jerk fashion and launched in such a way
that it is isolated from the broader clutch of processes associ-
ated with governance, state consolidation and economic
recovery" (p. 3). Apart from this, critics also quarrel with the
conceptual dimensions of certain aspects of DDR, especially
the aspect that concerns the reintegration of former combat-
ants (Jennings, 2008; Pouligny, 2004; Willibald, 2006). They
contend that generic approaches to reintegration are inade-
quate for dealing with the heterogeneous and differentiated
motivations of armed groups, which is why combatant-cen-
tric approaches to reintegration, like the NDAP, misfire com-
pletely. Thus, these critics who specifically target the rational
choice models and monetary incentives, such as payments to
combatants that dominate the field, argue that DDR invest-
ments should be directed, instead, to more inclusive or area-
based programs that focus on employment, infrastructural
development, and economic growth.
Finally, critics and practitioners worry that DDR lacks
clear benchmarks or metrics to determine success. Muggah
(2009) argues that while this is also true of other develop-
ment interventions initiated by multilateral and bilateral con-
tributors in complex environments, the "fact that DDR deals
specifically with weapons and armed groups suggests an
extra layer of caution is warranted" (p. 3). This extra layer of
caution is warranted more so in the Nigerian context, where
the intervention was imposed from the top with little or no
contribution from below and considering the multiple ambi-
guities associated with its conceptualization, implementa-
tion, and management.
The Challenge of DDR in Nigeria
Although the Nigerian government has been commended for
reversing the obtuse policy of non-engagement with insur-
gents that stood for more than five decades and through 11
administrations, there is great circumspection that the
Nigerian government's DDR program is capable of engaging
the wider context of the conflict. In fact, there are strong
indications that the government's conceptualization and
implementation of the DDR program is on all fours with his-
torical criticisms of DDR interventions broadly speaking
(see Humphreys & Weinstein, 2009; Jennings, 2008;
Muggah, 2009; Pouligny, 2004; Pugel, 2009). For instance,
the government's framing and conceptualization of DDR and
economic reconstruction is ambiguous and contradicts theo-
ries of peacebuilding (Collier, 2001; Collier et al., 2006;
Knight & Ozerdam, 2004; Lederach, 1997, 2003, 2005;
Reychler, 2008; Spear, 2005; M. Watts et al., 2004). The lack
of conceptual clarity about program goals or processes has
the potential to confuse program implementers, ultimately
producing negative outcomes (Reychler, 2008). Because of
this, the NDAP may be incapable of delivering peace beyond
the short term.
For example, the government's framework for disarma-
ment and demobilization was inadequately specified. It was
articulated as the return of arms and the dissolution of armed
groups. One problem with this simplistic conceptualization
is that it did not properly anticipate or articulate potential
risks with disarming and demobilizing ex-militants. As
scholars observe, it is common for ex-combatants to rearm
themselves to take advantage of expanding political opportu-
nities (Alden, 2002; Gamba, 2003; Mehlum & Ragner, 2002;
Spear, 2006) and fighters who did not enter DDR may recruit
rearmed former fighters to cause trouble (Mehlum & Ragner,
8 SAGE Open
2002). This was the case in the Republic of Congo where a
Ninja splinter group led by Frederic Bitsangou Ntumi refused
to demobilize, going on to recruit many ex-Ninjas who had
earlier been demobilized and using them to attack Brazzaville
("Rebels Cut Train Service to Coast," 2004). Ex-combatants
may also recreate disbanded armed groups and commence
post-war hostilities (Gamba, 2003; Spear, 2006). This was
the case in Nicaragua in the 1990s where demobilized Contra
rebels and the Sandinistas (government soldiers) recreated
parallel armed groups (Recontras and Recompas) from the
ashes of their old organizations to, first force the government
to give them reintegration assistance, and then to fight each
other (Spencer, 1997). There is also the potential for ex-com-
batants to sell their military skills to armed actors involved in
armed conflicts in foreign countries. This was the case in
Angola and Sierra Leone where demobilized soldiers of the
South African Defense Force (SADF) fought as mercenaries
in civil wars in Angola and Sierra Leone (Kingma, 1999).
Similarly, ex-fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA)
have fought in Macedonia. Apart from these, there is the
potential for ex-combatants to demobilize and reintegrate
into organized criminality (Alden, 2002; Call & Stanley,
2003; Mehlum & Ragner, 2002). This was the case in
Mozambique where after the signing of the 1992 Rome
Agreement, ex-combatants transformed their clandestine
military structures into dynamic criminal organizations
(Alden, 2002). Because of these shortcomings, it is likely
that the disarmament and demobilization of ex-combatants
in the Niger Delta may be incapable of contributing anything
of value to the peace process, unless disarmament and demo-
bilization are adequately conceptualized.
Similarly, the government's conceptualization of reinte-
gration was problematic as there was much ambiguity about
what reintegration would entail as with the proposed stages or
phases of the implementation. For example, should reintegra-
tion stop at economic reintegration or should it include social
and political reintegration? Economic reintegration, which
was the main focus of the government is important because
unemployment and poverty are central to the Niger Delta
conflict. More than 75% of Niger Delta youths are unem-
ployed and almost half of these youths are unemployable
because they lack skills applicable to modern industry
(Okonta & Douglas, 2003; Osaghae, Ikelegbe, Olarinmoye,
& Okhonmina, 2007; Saliu, Luqman, & Abdulahi, 2007; P.
Watts, 2009). Therefore, the economic reintegration of ex-
militants through vocational training and job creation schemes
is important to the peace process. Also very important is their
social and political integration, but this aspect appeared to
have been deprioritized by the government. Yet, because of
their tendency toward violence such as rape, physical abuse,
mutilation, kidnapping, murder, and so on, the return of ex-
combatants is capable of triggering anxiety and insecurity in
their communities of return (Knight & Ozerdam, 2004;
Nillson, 2005; Spear, 2005). Moreover, ex-combatants have
been shown to display difficulties in reconciling with their
communities especially in cases where such communities
were intensely victimized during the conflict. This was the
case in Angola where ex-combatants belonging to the Jonas
Savimbi National Union for the Total Independence ofAngola
(UNITA) engaged host communities in violence following
the implementation of DDR (Nillson, 2005).
Also, after being disarmed and demobilized, some catego-
ries of ex-combatants (especially women, children, and dis-
abled ex-combatants) constitute a weak and marginalized
group in need of economic, psychological, and social assis-
tance (Nillson, 2005). This situation is often exacerbated by
wartime illnesses that continue to plague ex-combatants in
post-conflict periods. This was the case in Uganda and Ethiopia
where a large portion of the demobilized combatants were
HIV/AIDS positive (King, 2000). Similarly, the war between
Ethiopia and Eritrea produced about 18,000 disabled ex-com-
batants in Ethiopia alone (Colletta, Kostner, & Wiederhofer,
2004; Collier, 1994). Apart from these, there is also the need to
pay serious attention to political reintegration as the failure to
incorporate ex-combatants into the political mainstream can
provoke violence. This was the case in Mozambique where
demobilized guerrilla fighters from the Mozambican National
Resistance (RENAMO) were shut out of the political process
and reacted with violence (Nillson, 2005). These reintegration
challenges provide the rationale for understanding how reinte-
gration is conceptualized and implemented in this DDR pro-
gram and whether these have any impact in altering the conflict
landscape of the Niger Delta. This study has the potential to
develop a useful definition of reintegration that encapsulates
the entire complex of economic, social, and political reintegra-
tion and that potentially roadmaps the effective reintegration of
ex-combatants in the Niger Delta.
Finally, studies of the Niger Delta conflict implicate eco-
nomic cleavages (i.e., poverty, unemployment, etc.) for the
conflict (Okonta & Douglas, 2003; Osaghae, 1998; Osaghae
et al., 2007; Saliu et al., 2007; P. Watts, 2009; M. Watts et al.,
2004). Yet, the government's economic reconstruction plan
is expressed fully as activities for ex-militants rather than as
targeted macro outcomes. This minimalist approach
(Muggah, 2009) that ignores the wider context of the conflict
may have little impact in reducing the conflict related risks
or in positively altering the conflict dynamics. Moreover, the
parlous economic conditions of Niger Delta people are
caused and exacerbated by the indiscriminate oil excavation
procedures by oil companies that pollute the Niger Delta
ecology, killing animal and fish species and rendering the
soil infertile. Yet, the conceptualization of economic recon-
struction was ominously silent on how economic reconstruc-
tion will be performed, what specific projects will be
undertaken, and how the revenues bases of communities and
people which were disrupted both by oil production and the
resulting violence will be regenerated.
Considering the above and in the light of suggestions by
Howard Wolpe and Steve McDonald in their 2008 article
"Democracy and Peace-Building: Rethinking the Conventional
Okonofua 9
Wisdom" that imposing peace settlements and democratic
institutions by themselves cannot prevent conflict; instead,
"interest-based negotiation" in which parties to the conflict
develop a common understanding of shared interests and vision
is the safest guarantee to building solid personal and institu-
tional relationships and lasting peace, this study examines the
NDAP to determine whether it has succeeded in altering the
delta's conflict dynamics and established long-term peace.
Method
The peacebuilding literature generally asserts the influence
of DDR programs in ending conflicts and entrenching peace.
Yet, the literature appears to be silent about the specific
aspect(s) of DDR that contributes peace. This study attempts
to fill this gap. The prospective study began in the fall of
2010 and focused on two categories of principal actors: com-
batants who entered the NDAP and those who did not. A
baseline sample of 346 combatants was drawn from combat-
ants who entered the NDAP (n = 224) and combatants who
did not enter the NDAP (n = 122) through face-to-face com-
puter-assisted interviews. In-depth interviews with important
stakeholders, including government officials, community
leaders, academics, activists, and non-governmental organi-
zations (NGOs), as well as secondary open source data com-
prising interviews conducted with managers of the NDAP,
oil executives, and combatants complemented the surveys.
Only the survey data acquired at baseline of combatants who
entered the NDAP (n = 224) are analyzed in this study. This
sample comprises of 224 adults from the delta region who
self-identify as former combatants and entered the NDAP
between 2009 and 2011, including 201 adult males and 23
adult females, out of which 86 were married, 75 have chil-
dren younger than age 17, and 166 were ethnic Ijaws.
Dependent variables. The dependent variables for this study are
"DISARMED," "DEMOBILIZED," "REINTEGRATED,"
FUTVIOL," "LONGTERM," and "TRANSFORMED."
"DISARMED" uses the question "Do you anticipate a future
need to acquire more weapons to pursue your objectives?" to
measure the success of the disarmament program. The measure
takes a value of 1 = "disarmed" for all those who say they will
not need to acquire more weapons to pursue their objectives,
and 0 = "not disarmed" for all other responses. DEMOBI-
LIZED measures links among militants or between militants
and their organizations. The question asked, "Who do you
spend most of your time with?" Responses of "family mem-
ber," "friend," "neighbor," and "no one/keep to myself" were
coded 1 = demobilized, and response of "member of militant
organization" was coded 0 = not demobilized. The measure
also measures the degree of social reintegration among former
combatants. If they spend most of their time with erstwhile
members of their group compared with non-members, includ-
ing family, non-combatant friends, neighbors, and so on, they
will be considered socially reintegrated. REINTEGRATED
measures whether respondents had reintegrated economically
by looking at their post-NDAP employment status. The mea-
sure is coded 1 = reintegrated if the respondent is employed
"full-time," "part-time," or is "self-employed" and 0 = not rein-
tegrated if she or he is "unemployed." FUTVIOL measures
whether respondents will use violence in the future to protest
grievances. Specifically, the question asked, "Considering the
ongoing amnesty program, how likely are you to continue to
use violence to pursue your objectives?" Responses of "very
likely" and "likely" were coded 0 = not transformed, and
responses of "unlikely" and "very unlikely" were coded as 1 =
transformed. LONGTERM measures respondents' perception
that the NDAP will entrench peace in the long term (10+ years)
as against the short term and midterm (1-9 years) or that the
program will fail. Responses were dichotomously coded as 1 =
succeed and 0 = fail. TRANSFORMED measures the degree of
transformation in individual fighters. The question asked, "In
your opinion, what is the most effective way to deal with oil-
related community problems?" Responses of "approaching
government officials," "approaching traditional rulers,"
"approaching oil company officials," "dialogue and negotia-
tion," "peaceful protests," and "litigation" were coded 0 =
transformed, and 1 = not transformed for responses of "taking
up arms to fight," "destroying government property," and
"destroying oil infrastructure."
Independent variables. Several indicator variables were used
in the regressions, including whether respondents entered the
NDAP, ethnicity, community exposure to pollution, length of
involvement in militancy (TIMEINV), benefits enjoyed as
members of militant groups (INGROUP), and state of resi-
dence. Additional independent control variables included
dichotomous measures for gender and marital status.
Analysis. For this study, SPSS v22 logistic regression analysis
estimating a linear trend from the observations for each person
and then modeling the intercepts and, particularly, the slopes
in a regression on individual- and community-level character-
istics was used to test the main hypotheses. The operations are
performed hierarchically and framed in terms of the effect of
adding predictor variables to a base equation. The base equa-
tion regresses the outcome variables on several predictor vari-
ables in phases or steps and then evaluates the amount of the
incremental explained variance by subtracting the squared
multiple correlation in the base equation from the squared
multiple correlation in the expanded equations. The difference
in the squared multiple correlations is the amount of incremen-
tal explained variance due to the additional predictors.
Results
Tables 1 and 2 present the results of this study. Due to con-
cerns with space and brevity, only the final models are pre-
sented, but it should be understood that the hierarchical
operations for each outcome variable generated three results
10 SAGE Open
corresponding to the variables included in each phase of the
operation. For all outcome variables, the final models, which
include outputs for all of the independent variables are the best
models based on the simultaneous measure of sensitivity (true
positive) and specificity (true negative) for all possible cutoff
points. In addition, I present both the Beta values, which are in
log odds and predict the outcome variable from the predictor
variable and their exponential values , which are in brackets
and are the odd ratios for the predictors. Although Beta tells
the amount of the increase (or decrease if the sign of the coef-
ficient is negative) in the predicted log odds of the outcome
variables, the  reports the odds ratio for the predictors.
Table 1 presents results for the first 3 outcome variables
for the study: DISARMED (which measures disarmament),
DEMOBILIZED (which measures both demobilization and
social reintegration), and REINTEGRATED (which mea-
sures economic reintegration). All outcome variables are
predicted from seven independent variables: STATE (state
of residence), MARRIED (marital status), COMEXPO
(community exposure to oil pollution), INGROUP (com-
paring conditions outside to militias), TIMEINV (time
spent in militias), ETHNICITY, and GENDER. The results
for disarmament shows that MARRIED, INGROUP, and
TIMEINV are significant predictors of successful disarma-
ment. Thus, married ex-combatants and ex-combatants
who had spent more than 5 years (compared with those who
had spent less than 5 years) in their militias have signifi-
cantly lower odds of rearming themselves in pursuit of their
objectives, controlling for all other variables. Conversely,
ex-combatants who feel they are worse off outside the mili-
tias than inside have significantly higher odds of rearming
themselves to pursue their objectives. State of residence,
community exposure to pollution, ethnicity, and gender do
not contribute anything of significance to the model.

In terms of demobilization, married ex-combatants as
well as ex-combatants who spent more than 5 years in mili-
tias have significantly higher odds than unmarried ex-com-
batants and those who have spent less than 5 years in militias
to demobilize and reintegrate into civilian society.
Conversely, ex-combatants who feel worse off outside than
inside the militias and females have significantly lower odds
of demobilizing and reintegrating into civilian society, con-
trolling for all other factors. Finally, married ex-combatants
have significantly higher odds of reintegrating economically
(i.e., getting a job) than unmarried ex-combatants, control-
ling for all other variables. All other variables in the model
are not significant and contribute nothing to the model.
Table 2 above presents the results of the last set of outcome
variables: FUTVIOL, LONGTERM, and TRANSFORMED;
all a function of participating in the NDAP. The results, which
are presented below are very illuminating. In terms of ex-com-
batants potential future resort to violence, the results show that
married ex-combatants had significantly lower odds than
unmarried ex-combatants to revert to violence, controlling for
all other variables. Similarly, ex-combatants who had spent
more than 5 years in their militias had significantly lower odds
of reverting to violence in the future than ex-combatants who
had spent less than 5 years in militias, controlling for all other
variables. All other variables were not significant and, there-
fore, cannot contribute to toward the prediction of ex-combat-
ants future recourse to violence.
The result for the outcome variable LONGTERM, which
measures ex-combatants conviction that the NDAP will be
able to achieve long-term peace for the region, is also illumi-
nating. Of all seven predictor variables, only INGROUP,
TIMEINV, and ETHNICITY are significant predictors. Thus,
ex-combatants who feel they are worse off outside the militias
than inside them and non-Ijaw ethnicities in the delta have
significantly higher odds of believing that the NDAP will not
be able to achieve long-term peace for the delta, controlling
for all other variables in the model. Conversely, ex-combat-
ants who had spent more than 5 years in their militias have
significantly lower odds of believing that the NDAP will fail
to achieve long-term peace in the delta compared with ex-
combatant who had spent less than 5 years in militias prior to
entering the NDAP.
The survey results also have very interesting findings in
terms of the overall transformative character of the NDAP.
The odds that ex-combatants will continue to espouse violence
for the settlement or resolution of disputes with the state/oil
companies are significantly lower for married ex-combatant
than singles, for ex-combatants who had spent more than 5
years in militancy than those who had spent less than 5 years,
and for ex-combatants who are ethnic Ijaw than other Niger
Delta ethnic nationalities, controlling for all other variables.
Conversely, ex-combatants who feel they are worse off out-
side the militias than inside them have significantly higher
odds of continuing to espouse violence for conflict/dispute
resolution, controlling for all other variables in the model.
Discussion
The primary purpose of this study is to examine the NDAP to
determine whether or how well it contributes to establishing
long-lasting peace in the Niger Delta. My interest in the
Niger Delta peace process stems from the observed negative
effects of prolonged violence on Niger Delta communities as
well as earlier interest by researchers in the program and
non-program effects of DDR on protracted conflicts. For
example, Humphreys and Weinstein (2009) focused on the
individual-level determinants of demobilization and reinte-
gration in Sierra Leone, showing that wealth, education, age,
gender, and ideology were significant determinants of suc-
cessful demobilization and reintegration in that country.
Similarly, Pugel (2009) assessed the impact of DDR on post-
conflict reintegration and demobilization in Liberia and
found significant empirical evidence to support the conclu-
sion that former combatants who entered the Liberian DDR
program and completed a course of reintegration training,
reintegrated more successfully than former combatants who
chose not to enter the program but reintegrated on their own.
Although these studies yielded useful results, they both
focused on demobilization and reintegration. DDR as con-
ceptualized by the UN and acknowledged by scholars,
including Humphreys and Weinstein (2009) and Pugel
(2009) involves three related activities: disarmament, demo-
bilization, and reintegration. Understanding DDR outcomes
can only be complete if all aspects are examined.
The literature depicts DDR as an important effective strat-
egy for ending protracted armed conflicts or for preventing a
return to conflict in post-conflict societies (Doyle & Sambanis,
2000). Studies of post-conflict demobilization and reintegra-
tion show that ex-combatants who enter DDR programs are
more likely to remain non-violent than ex-combatants who dis-
armed, demobilized, and reintegrated on their own (Humphreys
& Weinstein, 2009; Pugel, 2009). Yet, there is skepticism that
DDR achieves what is increasingly been ascribed to it. Critics
argue that DDR programs are too often narrowly conceived,
inflexible, technocratic, bureaucratic, and detached from the
political transition or broader recovery and reconstruction strat-
egies (Muggah, 2009). As a result of concerns such as these,
policy planners seek more evidence that DDR programs are
effective at ending protracted conflict and establishing peace in
the long term. More importantly, policy makers seek informa-
tion about what aspects of DDR, either alone or acting in con-
cert with other program and non-program factors, account for
DDR outcomes. This study is one response to that quest.
The results of the study are consistent with widespread
views about the status of the Niger Delta violence and schol-
arly views about the NDAP. Without doubt, the NDAP within
relatively short time affected the violence in many positive
ways and its achievements have continued to be asserted by
former and present managers of the program and by academ-
ics (Ajibola, 2015). But, if it is considered that as much as
60.7% of this study's respondents believe that the NDAP will
12 SAGE Open
be unable to entrench long-standing peace, 90.6% are unem-
ployed, and 82.6% believe that the current unemployment
situation in the delta is worse than before the NDAP was
instituted, then, program managers and the government must
exercise caution in touting the success of the NDAP.
Moreover, 99% of this study's respondents admitted that
their organizations only submitted a fraction of their arms,
which means that the militias continue to maintain the ability
to engage in armed violence despite participating in the
NDAP and receiving all of the benefits of participation,
including monthly reintegration stipends and huge oil pipe-
line security contracts from the state. If this is analyzed in
relation to the fact that the NDAP deliberately routes the pay-
ment of reintegration allowances or stipends through the
militias (Okonofua, 2011, 2013), effectively rendering the
demobilization aspects of the program defective from the
start, then, the weakness of the NDAP in terms of its ability
to entrench long-term peace should become glaring.
The result of the logistic regression is consistent with the
above but goes a step further to illuminate certain aspects of
the NDAP, especially revealing the type of combatants that
are more likely to disarm, demobilize, and reintegrate than
others. It also shows the type of ex-combatants that are more
or less likely to view the NDAP as potentially a long-term
success and capable of transforming ex-combatants from
purveyors of violence to individuals vested in peace settle-
ments and peace processes. Perhaps, this is the main contri-
bution of this research, which will enable scholars, policy
makers, program managers, and DDR intervention analysts
to target intervention to particular vulnerable groups. The
results particularly suggests that DDR participants should
not be considered as symmetric but asymmetric, in which
case certain individuals, cohorts, or groups may have more
capacity than others to internalize DDR processes and have
their behavior modified accordingly.
More specifically, the results for disarmament or the likeli-
hood that participants will acquire more weapons in future to
pursue their objectives show strongly that married ex-combat-
ants as well as ex-combatants who had more than 5 years'
experience in militancy are more likely to disarm than others.
This is not surprising; many ex-combatants have detailed the
very treacherous conditions under which combatants lived in
the swamps of the Niger Delta during the peak stages of the
violence (Okonofua, 2013). The mean conditions of the camps
and the uncertainties involved in their violent campaigns
against a brutal Nigerian Army must exert a huge toll on com-
batants and their families. The tolls are heavier, however, for
married combatants who are alienated from their wives (or hus-
bands) and children. Thus, this category of former fighters is
more likely to seize opportunities for peaceful settlements and
to not desire to rearm in pursuit of some future objectives. It is
also not surprising that the people who are more likely to rearm
themselves are ex-combatants who enjoyed better conditions
as militants than they are getting from the NDAP. For instance,
after John Togo, the leader of the Niger Delta Liberation Front
(NDLF) entered the NDAP, he discovered that he was better off
(economically) as a fighter than as an ex-combatant. Because
he lacked direct contact with the leadership of the political
state, he was deprioritized from the intricate patronage coali-
tion that had been formed to strengthen relations between cer-
tain influential ex-combatants and top Nigerian officials. He
promptly left the program, rearmed his group, and began to
engage security forces in hostilities. This is consistent with the
literature where ex-combatants have rearmed themselves and
broken the terms of peace accords due to their desire for mate-
rial gain (Alden, 2002; Gamba, 2003; Mehlum & Ragner,
2002; Spear, 2006).
The observed disarmament pattern is similar to the
observed pattern for demobilization. The study finds that
married ex-combatants and combatants who had spent more
than 5 years in militias are more likely to disarm than unmar-
ried ex-combatants and ex-combatants who joined militias
less than 5 years before entering the NDAP. Also, ex-combat-
ants who feel that conditions within their militias (where they
had considerable opportunities to make huge sums of money
through kidnapping for ransom, crude oil theft, and other
criminal enterprises) were better than the post-NDAP condi-
tions as well as female ex-combatants are less likely to demo-
bilize and reintegrate into civilian society than others.As with
John Togo, many ex-combatants, particularly those in the
smaller organizations, were deprioritized in the patron­client
system of the NDAP. The NDAP privileged relations with the
more influential insurgents such as Mujahid Asari-Dokubo,
Ateke Tom, and Government Ekpemupolo (Tom Polo) over
relations with some less influential militia commanders. The
more influential militia commanders became beneficiaries of
huge security contracts and made more money from engaging
the peace than from continuing to fight. Thus, unless ex-com-
batants are able to replace the war incomes that they lose from
embracing peace, they are more likely to maintain their for-
mer command structures and to resume fighting at the slight-
est provocation. Moreover, because the NDAP did not
explicitly seek to delink or disconnect former fighters from
their erstwhile groups as scholars recommend (Berdala, 1996;
Hithcock, 2004; Nillson, 2005), but in fact maintained these
groups, it unwittingly created conditions unfavorable to the
effective demobilization of ex-combatants.
Even more worrisome than the above is the fact that the
NDAP, from the very beginning, appeared to deprioritize
women in the scheme of things. In the first phase, the NDAP
admitted only 133 (0.6%) women out of the 20,192 ex-com-
batants who entered the program. The small number of
women admitted into the program is certainly not reflective
of the rate of participation of women in militancy in the
region or of women's involvement in civil wars generally
(Nillson, 2005; Ortega, 2009). For instance, about 30% of
the Sandinista army in Nicaragua and between 25% and 30%
of the guerillas in El Salvador were women. Thus, the find-
ing that female ex-combatants are less likely to demobilize
and reintegrate into Niger Delta communities may be
Okonofua 13
suggestive of the fact that the NDAP deprioritizes women
who are also likely to receive less reintegration support than
males. There are several likely reasons for this. First, female
combatants are not considered to pose the same level of
threats as male combatants. As a result, men have always
been given priority in terms of reintegration assistance
(Colletta et al., 2004; IPRI, 2002; Nillson, 2005). Second,
female combatants in the Niger Delta live in masculinized
societies with gendered institutions and symbolic systems.
As a result, female ex-combatants are often alienated for
breaching "societal norms," which do not glorify women
warriors. Because of this, many female ex-combatants are
reluctant to disclose their status and fail to reintegrate through
DDR. Instead, they often reintegrate into prostitution and
drug addiction, or reemerge as mercenaries in another con-
flict (Bernard et al., 2003). Third, female ex-combatants may
be constrained by gender-specific obstacles in the post-con-
flict period because they tend to have less access to knowl-
edge, skills, information, resources, work opportunities, and
support structures than males (Nillson, 2005). Because of
these gender-specific discriminations, female ex-combatants
often feel empowered by war and may not want to return to
their traditional roles, which in most instances affirms men's
gender power over women. Yet, the failure to accommodate
women in DDR programs and to effectively demobilize and
reintegrate them into society may create unanticipated con-
sequences as was the case in Eritrea where the divorce rate
for married ex-combatants rose to 27% (King, 2000) or in
Chad, Namibia, and Nicaragua where domestic violence rate
involving female ex-combatants spiked significantly.
For economic reintegration, the study finds that married
ex-combatants are more likely to gain employment than
unmarried ex-combatants. Perhaps this is so because they
benefit from scale, which in this case means that married for-
mer fighters are likely to have much larger social networks
(when their spouses' networks are factored) for getting a job.
This expanded network may open doors that unmarried ex-
combatants are unable to access and with such economic
access, married ex-combatants are less likely to want to
return to insurgency. The reintegration challenges of Niger
Delta ex-combatants are not novel in themselves. Azam et al.
(1994) showed that reintegration programs are often heavily
politicized leading to the marginalization of groups crucial to
the peace process. For example, the failure to accommodate
the interests of RENAMO dissidents in Mozambique spurred
another round of fighting even after the peace agreement had
been signed (Nillson, 2005). Not only has this program
defect prevented the proper absorption of potential spoilers
into the program but has also given ex-combatants the oppor-
tunity to reorganize latent command structures as happened
in Sierra Leone in 2000. And as Knight and Ozerdam (2004)
have argued, even where ex-combatants did not intentionally
set out to reorganize latent command structures, the fact that
program managers and influential politicians were deliber-
ately creating bottlenecks for would-be repentant combatants
was an incentive to reorganize and reactivate violence.
In terms of ex-combatants' overall assessment of the
NDAP, the results also show some interesting dynamics.
For instance, ex-combatants who identified as ethnic Ijaw
are more likely to hold favorable views of the NDAP, spe-
cifically believing that the NDAP will succeed in establish-
ing long-term peace in the delta, although they are less
likely to be transformed by the NDAP than members of
other ethnicities. This finding suggests that Ijaw former
fighters, because they share ethnicity with ex-President
Goodluck Jonathan, have been the main beneficiaries of the
NDAP. The top managers of the program, from Timi Alaibe
(the pioneer coordinator of the program) to Kingsley Kuku
(the immediate past program coordinator) are mainly Ijaw
who are also the dominant ethnic group in the region and in
the NDAP. Thus, they are more likely to view the program
as a success. However, because Ijaw communities continue
to experience the negative effects of oil production, includ-
ing poverty and unemployment disproportionate to their
role in generating much of the nation's wealth, Ijaw former
fighters are less likely to be transformed by the NDAP.
Thus, if the program is discontinued, Ijaw former fighters
are more likely than other groups to revert to violence to
pursue their goals.
Finally, like the first set of variables tested, marital status,
time invested in militias, and ex-combatants perception of their
situation outside of their militias compared with situations
within their militias are important factors to consider in assess-
ing the overall performance of the NDAP. In context, this would
suggest as, indeed, Lederach (1997) has urged that a more holis-
tic approach that accounts for conditions in the community (i.e.,
poverty, pollution, disenfranchisement, etc.) must be adopted to
gain any credible, long-term benefit from the NDAP.
Conclusion
The NDAP was instituted at a time of great social, political,
and economic ferment and trepidation. Since its inception, the
program has had measured impact on the violence, helping to
bring about the fragile peace existing in the region today. The
peace is fragile because while the NDAP drastically reduced
the onshore violence in the delta, the violence shifted to the
offshore where oil assets are daily being sabotaged by former
fighters and fighters who refused to enter the program includ-
ing new parties that entered the violence after the adoption of
the NDAP, particularly after the 2015 presidential election.
This study validates the little success achieved by the NDAP
but shows that the potential for violence to return is high. If
violence returns, many former fighters who are presently par-
ticipating in the NDAP will get involved, especially the more
inexperienced former fighters, women, unemployed former
fighters, and those who benefitted more from waging than
engaging the NDAP-induced peace.
