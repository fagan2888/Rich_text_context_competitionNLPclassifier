Objectives. This study examines the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and selected measures of functional
illness and whether the relationship between BMI and these outcomes is stronger in advanced ages.
Methods. Four measures of functional illness were examined in a national, longitudinal survey of noninstitutionalized
adults. Tobit and Poisson models were used to estimate cross-sectional and longitudinal specifications.
Results. BMI was related to functional illness but not in a linear form: Both obese and underweight persons manifested
higher levels of functional illness on most outcomes during the baseline survey. Results from the change analyses, however,
revealed that obesity was associated with more days hospitalized or ill in bed and an increase in functional limitations.
Discussion. Obesity is associated with functional illness, but there is no evidence from these data that this relationship is
stronger for older adults. Rather, the effect of obesity on some measures of functional illness is greater in the younger and
middle ages.
A LARGE and growing body of research links excess body
1~\ weight with morbidity and mortality over the life course.
Numerous studies have shown that obesity is associated with
greater risk of disease including hypertension (Willett &
Manson, 1995), diabetes mellitus (Anderson & Kannel, 1992),
cardiovascular disease (Rich-Edwards, Manson, Hennekens, &
Buring, 1995), and osteoarthritis (Hart & Spector, 1993).
Dozens of studies also point to obesity leading to higher mor-
tality risk (e.g., Andres, Muller, & Sorkin, 1993; National
Institutes of Health, 1985; Tayback, Kumanyika, & Chee,
1990). The most recent studies have helped to clarify the condi-
tions under which the risks of morbidity and mortality are high-
est for obesity as well as the mechanisms for the deleterious
effects (Clark & Mungai, 1997; Diehr et al., 1998). There have
also been vigorous debates as to whether the relationship be-
tween body mass index (BMI) and either illness or mortality is
linear, j-shaped, or u-shaped (Sorkin, Muller, & Andres, 1994;
Troiano, Frongillo, Sobal, & Levitsky, 1996; Willett & Manson,
1995).
While scores of studies have examined the link between obe-
sity and both morbidity and mortality, relatively little research
has examined the relationship between obesity and functional
illness. This is surprising, given that physical disability and
functional illness are often key variables influencing health-
related quality of life and mortality risk (Wilson & Cleary,
1995). The present research is designed to address this gap in
the literature by examining whether excess body weight affects
functional illness and if the effect is greater in later life. Build-
ing on Parsons (1972), we define functional illness as a general-
ized reduction in the capacity of an individual to perform his or
her roles.
Obesity and Functional Illness
Decades of research in several disciplines have helped to
identify the origins of functional illness (Katz, Ford, Moskowitz,
Jackson, & Jaffe, 1963; Nagi, 1965, 1976; Parsons, 1951).
Research has proliferated in recent years examining the predic-
tors of disability (Palmore & Burchett, 1997), functional de-
cline (Manton, 1988; Mor et al., 1989), mobility maintenance
(Guralnik et al., 1993), and active life expectancy (Crimmins,
Hayward, & Saito, 1996). While many of these studies have
yielded important contributions for understanding trajectories
of functional illness, most studies--even the more recent ones
--have not examined the influence of body weight (Foley et al.,
1990; House et al., 1990; House et al., 1994; Mor et al., 1989;
Mutchler & Burr, 1991; Ross & Wu, 1995, 1996; Verbrugge &
Jette, 1994). At the same time, there is a modest but growing set
of studies that examine the relationship between obesity and
various indicators of function. Unfortunately, findings across
these studies are not consistent. Some of these studies show
that obesity is related to impaired function (Ferraro, Farmer, &
Wybraniec, 1997; Galanos, Pieper, Cornoni-Huntley, Bales,
& Fillenbaum, 1994; Keil et al., 1989; Launer, Harris, Rumpel,
& Madans, 1994), whereas others find no such link (G. A.
Kaplan, Strawbridge, Camacho, & Cohen, 1993; Lawrence &
Jette, 1996).
There are at least three biological mechanisms for expecting
a link between excessive body weight and functional illness.
First, excessive weight may add physical stress to the skeleton
and weight-bearing joints, thereby increasing the likelihood of
osteoarthritis and impairing function (Hart & Spector, 1993).
Second, excessive weight may promote insulin resistance and
hyperglycemia, which, in turn, will promote glycation of pro-
teins and DNA in soft connective tissue (Modan et al., 1988;
Pratley, Coon, Rogus, & Goldberg, 1995; Reaven, 1988;
Supiano et al., 1993). These changes are often associated with
inflammatory responses in the connective tissue of the joints
and arteries leading to functional illness (Cerami, 1985;
Walford, Harris, & Weindruch, 1987). Third, excessive weight
may lead to a pattern of blood lipids that will promote athero-
S339
S340 FERRARO AND BOOTH
genesis and thereby decrease ability to function normally (N.
M. Kaplan, 1989; Stevens, Gautam, & Keil, 1993).
Most of the studies that find a link between BMI and func-
tional illness are longitudinal analyses, and some are derived
from the same data set. For instance, Crimmins and Saito
(1993) used the Longitudinal Study on Aging and found that
overweight people were more likely to show deterioration on
some measures of functional illness but not on others. Lawrence
and Jette (1996) used the same data set and did not detect any
direct effects of BMI on several indicators of functional limita-
tion and disability. Among those that do find an association be-
tween body mass and functional illness, most focus on the
effects of obesity (e.g., Ferraro et al., 1997; Keil et al., 1989).
Galanos and colleagues (1994), however, found that both high
and low BMI values were associated with higher functional im-
pairment. This suggests that the relationship between BMI and
functional illness is more complex than a simple linear relation-
ship. Age differences are also important to consider.
BMI and Functional Illness in Life Course Perspective
Many of the studies cited above were conducted on samples
of limited age ranges (e.g., 70+: Crimmins & Saito, 1993;
Lawrence & Jette, 1996; 65+: Galanos et al., 1994; G. A. Kaplan
et al., 1993). Although this cannot explain all the inconsistency
in the literature, it may provide insight when considered with
samples that are not so constrained by age. Galanos and col-
leagues (1994) studied an older sample and found both low and
high BMI associated with functional illness measures including
activities of daily living (ADLs), the Fries disability scale, and
the Rosow-Breslau scale. Studies of older participants that treat
BMI in a linear form find either no effect on functional illness
(G. A. Kaplan et al., 1993; Lawrence & Jette, 1996) or modest
relationships on selected indicators of functional ability
(Crimmins & Saito, 1993). On the other hand, the few studies
that find an effect of obesity on function consider a wider age
range and use either BMI in a linear form or a variable to dis-
tinguish obese persons (Ferraro et al., 1997; Launer et al., 1994).
These findings suggest two reasons why a life course perspec-
tive may be useful for studying BMI and functional illness.
First, body weight typically changes over the life course:
BMI increases with age through the adult years, but levels or
declines in older adulthood (Cornoni-Huntley et al., 1991).
Willett and colleagues (1995) found that very few women be-
tween the ages of 30 and 55 who were followed for 14 years
experienced weight loss; most gained weight. By contrast,
weight loss in adulthood is more likely in later life as energy in-
take decreases because of loss of appetite, illness, or depression
(Blazer, 1989, 1993; Dutta & Hadley, 1995; Evans, 1995;
Gurland, Dean, & Cross, 1983; Meltzer & Everhart, 1995;
Sobal, 1995; Williamson, 1995). From another perspective,
weight loss and low weight in older ages are more likely to be
consequences of disease or its treatment (Losonczy et al.,
1995). It appears that if only a linear relationship between BMI
and functional illness is considered on an older sample, the ef-
fects associated with low BMI and high BMI may cancel one
another.
Second, a life course perspective may be helpful because
there is debate about whether the effects of body weight on
health are constant over the life course. Obesity is a risk factor
for health problems, but is obesity more likely to be consequen-
tial to health at certain stages of the life course? According to
cumulative disadvantage theory, the effects of risk factors accu-
mulate over the life course (Dannefer, 1987, 1988; Merton,
1968; O'Rand, 1996; Ross & Wu, 1996). From this perspec-
tive, it is important to recognize that the consequences of many
health practices are long term rather than immediate. It may
take years before excessive weight actually influences disabil-
ity, and the later years may be the point at which the lifelong
consequences of excessive weight will have their greatest ef-
fect. On the other hand, studies of mortality have shown that
obesity is significant in younger adults, but not older--suggest-
ing that the risk of excess weight on health and mortality in the
later years has been exaggerated (Andres et al., 1993; Lindsted
& Singh, 1997). Andres (1995) concluded that "those who
either maintain their weight or, better, gain small amounts of
weight, show the lowest mortality" (p. 69).
For the present study, two main hypotheses are formulated.
First, we hypothesized that obese persons will manifest higher
levels of functional illness than will those of normal weight.
Second, we hypothesized that the effect of obesity on func-
tional illness will be stronger among older respondents than
among younger respondents. This hypothesis anticipates that
age and obesity interact in shaping functional illness.
METHOD
Sample
This study makes use of data from Americans' Changing
Lives (ACL), a longitudinal survey of 3,617 adults from the
noninstitutionalized population of the continental United States.
Respondents were 25 years of age or older and were initially
interviewed in 1986. The study sample was selected with a mul-
tistage area probability sample design and oversampled Black
and older (60+) respondents at twice the rate of non-Black and
younger persons (1,162 persons oversampled). The survey had
a response rate of "70% among sampled households and 68%
among sampled individuals (multiple individuals being in-
terviewed in some households)" (House et al., 1994, p. 216).
(Poststratification weights are available to approximate the U.S.
population of the time.)
An attempt was made in 1989 to contact all respondents
from the first survey, hereafter referred to as Wave 1 (Wl). Of
the original sample, 2,869 participants (79.32%) responded to
the second wave of the study (W2). There were 165 deaths
recorded (4.56%) and 583 Wl respondents either refused to
participate or were untraceable (16.12%). Because 20.71% of
the respondents dropped from the survey as a result of death,
refusal to participate, or inability to trace for follow-up, selec-
tion bias modeling is used for the multivariate analysis of
change between surveys (Heckman, 1979).
Measures
Dependent variables.--Functional illness is defined as a
generalized reduction in the capacity of an individual to per-
form his or her roles (Parsons, 1972). Four variables are used as
indicators: functional impairment, functional limitation, days ill
in bed, and days spent in the hospital. The first measure is a
four-category Guttman scale of self-reported impairment, rang-
ing from 1 (no major functional impairments) to 4 (currently in
BODYMASS INDEXAND FUNCTIONAL ILLNESS S341
bed or chair and/or high difficulty bathing). A total of 3,060
(76.7%) Wl respondents reported no major functional impair-
ment, and 2,352 of the W2 respondents (76.9%) reported no
functional impairment.
The second measure is self-reported overall functional limi-
tation: "How much are your daily activities limited in any way
by your health or health-related problems?" Responses ranged
from 1 (not at all) to 5 (a great deal; House, 1990). A total of
2,597 (79.6%) Wl respondents reported no functional limita-
tion, and 1,737 (66.9%) W2 respondents reported no functional
limitation.
Days ill in bed was assessed by asking, "On about how many
days during the past 3 months did you stay in bed all or most of
the day?" Hospitalization was assessed by asking, "Have you
been a patient in a hospital, overnight or longer, at any time
during the past 6 months?" (House, 1990). These two variables
were coded identically, ranging from 0 to 8 (reported values for
0-5; 6 = 6-9; 7 = 10-14; 8 = 15+). Some caution is necessary
when using these variables in cross-sectional analyses because
of the retrospective nature of the question. Because noninstitu-
tionalized Americans were sampled, those people who were
hospitalized at the time of the survey are not represented.
As expected, the distributions for days in bed or nights hos-
pitalized are skewed: 3,000 Wl respondents (83.0%) and 1,948
W2 respondents (64.9%) reported no days ill in bed within the
last 3 months. Further, 3,346 Wl respondents (92.6%) and
2,584 W2 respondents (77.2%) reported no hospitalization
within the past 6 months.
Independent variables.--Body mass index (BMI) is used to
measure obesity. Height and weight were self-reported in
inches and pounds and were converted to meters and kilograms.
BMI was calculated with the Quetelet Index (kilograms/
meters2). Self-reported weight and height measures are closely
related to physical measurements but may underestimate the
occurrence of obesity because of a tendency of short persons to
overreport height and for heavy persons to underreport weight
(Black, Taylor, & Coster, 1998; Bowman & DeLucia, 1992;
Kuskowska-Wolk, Bergstrom, & Bostrom, 1992). Women who
gave birth 1 year before Wl or between waves were omitted
from the analysis.
BMI is measured continuously for each respondent and is
analyzed both continuously and categorically. The categorical
form of BMI relies on obesity defined as having a BMI of 30
or greater, regardless of age or sex (Andres et al., 1993;
Tayback et al., 1990). Whereas the focus of the present re-
search is investigating the link between obesity and functional
illness, previous research shows the importance of considering
underweight as well (Galanos et al., 1994). This is not to as-
sume that underweight increases functional illness, unless the
underweight is severe and includes malnutrition. Slight under-
weight may be associated with good health outcomes
(Edwards et al., 1998; Lass, Sohal, Weindruch, Forster, &
Sohal, 1998). Rather, there are two reasons for including un-
derweight in multivariate models. First, a growing body of re-
search shows that the relationship between BMI and the risk of
illness and mortality is nonlinear (Troiano et al., 1996; Willett
& Manson, 1995). Second, weight loss in later life may be cor-
related with functional illness--both caused by disease or its
treatment (e.g., Losonczy et al., 1995). Including underweight
controls for those respondents who experienced a weight loss
due to disease. Underweight is defined as <19 BMI for women
and <20 BMI for men (American Public Health Association,
1992; Bray, 1983).
Table 1 presents Ms and SDs for all variables across three
categories of BMI. It is clear from Table 1 that the extremes of
BMI (i.e., underweight and obesity) were associated with
higher disability, thus manifesting a nonlinear relationship with
the dependent variables. Therefore, binary variables for both
underweight and obesity are used in most multivariate analyses
(reference group of normal weight). Alternative cut points for
BMI were used to define underweight and obese persons in
penultimate cross-sectional and longitudinal models (e.g., 1 SD

Notes: Weighted data; number of cases varies because of missing data (2,860
cases reinterviewed at W2). Body weight categories are denned according to
the American Public Health Association (1992) and Bray (1983). Underweight
women have a body mass index (BMI) <19, and underweight men have a BMI
<20. Obese women and men have a BMI >30. W = wave.

± M of BMI and overall vs gender-specific cut points; see
Chong, Klein, Plepys, & Troiano, 1998). The results of those
analyses are similar to those presented below.
Respondents were asked whether they had experienced 1 or
more of 10 diseases in the past year. These conditions were cat-
egorized into chronic, but nonserious, conditions (i.e., arthritis,
foot problems, lung problems, broken bones, and urine control)
and serious conditions (i.e., high blood pressure, heart attack,
cancer, diabetes, and stroke). Following the procedures of
Ferraro and Farmer (1996), the chronic (nonserious) and seri-
ous conditions were summed separately. (Penultimate models
substituting the sum of all diseases as well as separate dummy
variables for each disease were estimated with similar results.
The serious/chronic distinction was maintained as the most par-
simonious and explanatory approach to examine the link be-
tween morbidity and functional illness.)
Income was coded categorically from 1 (<$5,000) to 10
(>$80,000). Education reflects years of schooling and ranges
from 1 (0-11) to 4 (16 or more). Occupational prestige was
measured with the Duncan Socioeconomic Index.
Functional illness involves not only an inability to perform
physical activities but a limitation in social functioning as well
(Parsons, 1972; Verbrugge & Jette, 1994). Whereas ample so-
cial support may help a person cope with functional illness, it is
appropriate to control for social support. A social support index
was created by combining four questions (e.g., how much
friends and relatives care and love you, a = .59; House, 1990).
Respondents were asked about three recreational activities
involving physical activity (gardening, active sports, and walk-
ing). Given that gardening and active sports are less common
forms of activity in the ACL, especially among older people,
recreational walking was selected as a measure of physical ac-
tivity. Responses ranged from 1 (never) to 4 (often). The mea-
surement of the remaining variables is fairly straightforward
and described in Table 1.
Descriptive information for the variables is presented in
Table 1 based on the sample weighted to U.S. proportions.
Unweighted data are used in the multivariate analysis because
the focus of this research is hypothesis testing rather than de-
scriptive analysis (Winship & Radbill, 1994). Additional vari-
ables were considered in preliminary analyses but deleted from
further consideration because they were not significant predic-
tors (i.e., living alone, BMI in continuous form, and living in
the south). Small amounts of missing data on various items
(<2%) were imputed to Ms defined by sex, race, and age (Little
& Schenker, 1995).
Analytic Plan
Tests of hypotheses involve cross-sectional and longitudinal
specifications. For the longitudinal analyses of functional im-
pairment and functional limitation, residualized change analyses
were performed (W2 variable regressed on the parallel Wl vari-
able and the covariates). Days in bed and nights hospitalized are
count variables referring to what transpired in the 3- and 6-
month time periods prior to the survey; thus, residualized change
models are not appropriate. Rather, the longitudinal analyses for
these outcomes are based on lagged-effects models of body
weight on functional illness (i.e., corresponding Wl dependent
variable not included when predicting the W2 outcome).
Given the skewed distributions of the four measures of func-
tional illness, we used tobit models to estimate models for func-
tional impairment and limitation and used Poisson models to
estimate models for the count variables of days ill in bed and
nights hospitalized (Long, 1997). The prevalence of functional
illness among younger persons (25-64) in the ACL ranges from
7% (hospitalization) to 26% (functional limitation).
Selection bias models were used to account for attrition in the
analysis of the W2 data. In a longitudinal study such as ACL,
adverse selection processes could influence sample estimates of
predictor variables leading to bias in the estimates of the true re-
lationship between independent variables and functional illness.
This concern may be even more important for the present analy-
sis given that 748 Wl respondents (20.68%) did not participate
in the follow-up (death, refusal, or inability to trace). Thus, se-
lection bias models, originally developed by Heckman (1979),
were used to correct parameter estimates for differential selec-
tivity by W2 (Winship & Mare, 1992). The procedure involves
first estimating a probit model of the retention/attrition process
and creating a hazard rate instrument (X) based on the inverse
Mills ratio to express the likelihood of remaining in the study.
The second step is to estimate the model of interest including
the hazard rate instrument as an independent variable (Berk &
Ray, 1982; Stolzenberg & Relies, 1997). This two-step approach
has been extended to incorporate two hazard rate instruments for
different forms of attrition (Maddala, 1983) and is conveniently
handled in LIMDEP (Greene, 1995). The results presented
below were derived with LIMDEP.
The test of the second hypothesis is predicated on a multi-
plicative model; we created an interaction term to determine if
the relationship between obesity and functional illness is
stronger among older people. Finally, age was broken down
into three categories and similar regression equations were then
estimated. This strategy was used in order to examine if the in-
fluence of BMI on functional illness varied by age and to aid
interpretation of the tests of interaction effects.
RESULTS
The analysis began with BMI in its continuous form for
cross-sectional and longitudinal models of functional illness,
but BMI was not significantly related to most of the functional
illness measures. If there is a relationship between BMI and
functional illness, it appears that it will not be easily detected
under the assumption of a linear relationship. Thus, we under-
took two sets of analyses. First, dummy variables for obesity
and underweight were examined in cross-sectional and longitu-
dinal models. Second, parallel regression models were exam-
ined using BMI-squared and BMI-cubed variables. The results
from both procedures were consistent with the results of
Galanos et al. (1994) showing that relationship between BMI
and functional illness is not linear: Both obese and underweight
persons manifest higher levels of functional illness on most in-
dicators (see also Table 1). The results reported below are based
on the categorical form of BMI because of ease of interpreta-
tion, especially the interpretation of interaction terms between
age and body weight.
Cross-SectionalAnalysis
The results from Model I (additive model) shown in Table 2
indicate that being either obese or underweight is associated
with higher levels of functional impairment. Further, the older
BODYMASS INDEXAND FUNCTIONAL ILLNESS S343
the person, the more extensive the functional impairment.
Model II adds the interaction term for age and obesity. While
the product term is significant at/? < .05, the main effect for
obese is nonsignificant, and the difference in the log likelihood
function between Models I and II is nonsignificant (2.78;
Jaccard, Turrisi, & Wan, 1990). Thus, the interaction model
does not provide a better fit than the additive model (see also
footnote c of Table 2). In Models I and II, chronic conditions
and serious or life-threatening conditions are both significantly
related to functional impairment. Functional impairment is also
higher for unemployed and low-income persons.
Results for self-reported functional limitation show that both
obese and underweight participants have greater functional limi-
tations. After controlling for morbidity and the other variables,

there are no age differences on this functional illness measure,
and the interaction of age and obese is nonsignificant. African
American and male respondents reported lower levels of func-
tional limitation. Most other relationships are similar to what
was observed with impairment except that income has a
stronger association with functional Limitation.
When examining days that have been spent ill in bed, the
Poisson models reveal some intriguing differences from the
first two outcomes. Those people who reported more days ill in
bed at Wl tended to be younger and either obese or under-
weight. Although age and obesity do not interact in shaping
days ill in bed, there is a significant interaction of age and un-
derweight: Older, underweight people have disproportionately
fewer days ill in bed. Both types of morbidity are related to
days ill in bed during the past 3 months, and more days are
likely among women, those lacking social support, and unem-
ployed respondents. More days ill in bed are also more likely
among more educated respondents, presumably because of a
stronger inclination to rest and protect one's health (consistent
with other ACL studies; House et al., 1994).
Although many similarities exist, models for hospital nights
were different in a few ways from the estimates for days spent
ill in bed. Obesity was associated with fewer nights hospital-
ized, but underweight was associated with more nights. Age
was negatively related, albeit weakly, to nights hospitalized.
The Age X Obesity variable was nonsignificant, but an interac-
tion of Age X Underweight was significant and positive: Older
underweight persons have more nights in the hospital. We inter-
pret this in light of the sequelae of morbidity, especially serious
illness, involving medications, loss of appetite, and physical
function (Meltzer & Everhart, 1995; Sobal, 1995; Williamson,
1995). Persons with higher incomes, women, and nonsmokers
have lower rates of hospitalization, and married persons are less
likely to be hospitalized. Hospitalization was more likely for re-
spondents reporting higher occupational prestige and more fre-
quent recreational walking, perhaps reflecting more active
health-protective profiles.
LongitudinalAnalysis
The first step in the longitudinal analysis was estimating at-
trition between Wl and W2. Models were first estimated for all
sources of attrition and then separately for mortality (n = 166)
and all other reasons (including refusals and inability to trace,
n = 582, not distinguished in ACL). Probit models for mortality
reveal that deaths were more likely among respondents who
were older, were men, and reported less income. (Self-rated
health was also included in the equation but was nonsignificant;
p > .05.) The equation for all other forms of nonresponse attri-
tion showed that refusals and inability to trace were more likely
among respondents who were younger, were men, were urban
residents, reported less income, and were missing on income at
Wl (DeMaio, 1980; Smith, 1984). The probit coefficients were
then used to create selection variables for mortality and attrition
due to nonresponse and adjust estimates of change (Maddala,
1983).
Table 3 presents the results of the longitudinal analyses in
the measures of functional illness (all independent variables are
measured at baseline). Obesity does not predict change in func-
tional impairment, but underweight respondents were more
likely to become impaired by W2. There are no age differences
in functional impairment by W2, but those with more morbid-
ity also manifested increased impairment. Only the death selec-
tion variable (X) was significant; those who died would have
manifested increased functional illness by W2 if they had re-
mained in the analysis. There was no evidence of age interact-
ing with either obesity or underweight in shaping functional
impairment.
The predictors of change in functional limitation were differ-
ent from functional impairment in several respects. Obese re-
spondents became more disabled over time on this measure, but
there was no significant increase in functional limitations for
underweight respondents. The effects due to morbidity and em-
ployment status were parallel to those for functional impair-
ment. The effects due to selection were nonsignificant. Age did
not interact with either obesity or underweight in models of
change in functional limitation.
Obesity is nonsignificant in Model I for days ill in bed, and
the relationship with underweight is modest. As in the cross-
sectional analysis, age is negatively related to days ill in bed at
W2. Note, however, when adding the interaction term for age
and obesity in Model II that age is significant along with the in-
teraction term (difference in the log likelihood between the
models is significant). Obese and younger persons had more
days ill in bed at W2, but obese young people are prone to par-
ticularly high rates of days ill in bed. More days ill in bed at
W2 were also more likely among respondents who had higher
morbidity and education and less occupational prestige and so-
cial support. Women reported more days ill in bed as did urban
residents, those not married or employed, and past smokers.
Selection processes did not significantly influence the results.
Model I for overnight hospitalization shows that BMI does
not predict hospitalization, but age does. Model II, however,
shows that age and overweight interact. Both obese and older
people are more likely to be hospitalized, but obese older people
actually have a lower risk of hospitalization--the higherriskof
hospitalization for obese people shrinks in later life. For both
measures of functional illness days (in bed or the hospital), it ap-
pears that younger obese people are the ones who suffer the
highest risk. Most of the remaining significant relationships in
this model are consistent with the literature: Hospitalization was
more likely for persons with more morbidity, men, persons in a
lower social class, urban residents, those with limited social sup-
port, and nonworking persons.
To assess the robustness of the results, we performed supple-
mentary cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses substituting
10 separate dummy variables of the illnesses for the separate
counts of chronic and serious illness. The coefficients for obe-
sity and underweight were very similar across the analyses, and
the pattern of significance was identical in the 16 equations. As
anticipated, each time an illness was significant, it was posi-
tively associated with functional illness. Of the 10 illnesses con-
sidered, high blood pressure and arthritis were nonsignificant in
selected cross-sectional analyses; high blood pressure, arthritis,
cancer, and bone problems were nonsignificant in selected lon-
gitudinal analyses. Stated differently, heart attack, diabetes,
stroke, foot problems, lung problems, and urine control were
significantly associated with the functional illness measures in
all of the cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses.
The final phase of the analysis was to examine the relation-
ships between the independent and dependent variables across

three broad age categories (<44; 45-64; 65+). Parallel models
were estimated, and the difference of slopes across age groups
were tested for obesity and underweight. These analyses (not
presented) generally confirmed the full sample analyses and
may be summarized as follows. First, obesity manifested
stronger relationships than did underweight on most measures
of functional illness among young and middle-aged respondents.
Second, body weight was not associated with W2 functional ill-
ness outcomes for older adults, but obesity was associated with
increased functional illness at W2 among younger adults on
three of the four functional illness measures. Third, most of the
significant relationships between underweight and functional
illness in the age-group analyses were observed among older
respondents. There is limited evidence from the age-group anal-
yses that obesity is a major risk factor for functional illness
among elders, but there is ample evidence to implicate obesity
as a serious risk factor for functional illness among younger
and middle-aged adults.
DISCUSSION
This research focused on two basic research questions. The
first is whether obesity is related to functional illness. Results
from the ACL survey show that it is but that both underweight
and obese persons manifest higher levels of functional illness.
These results support the research conducted by Galanos and
colleagues (1994) showing that the two extremes of BMI are at
greater risk of functional impairment (see also Black, Sciacca,
& Coster, 1994). The relationships were substantial in the cross-
sectional analyses, but also manifest in the change analysis on
selected measures. If only a linear relationship between BMI
and functional illness is tested, then it is quite likely that the re-
lationship will be weak or nonexistent. Indeed, when treated
linearly for this analysis, BMI is not significantly related to
most measures of functional illness. This can explain some of
the inconsistency in the previous literature because several of
the studies reported using BMI in its linear form only. On the
other hand, when categorical forms of BMI representing the
tails of the distribution or polynomials are used, BMI is associ-
ated with functional illness. The implication is clear for future
research: The relationship between BMI and many health out-
comes is probably not linear. Additional research is needed to
specify the form of the relationship across various health status
indicators.
The second research question asks if the relationship be-
tween obesity and functional illness is stronger with age. An in-
teraction term for obesity and age was tested in cross-sectional
and longitudinal analyses to answer this question. The interac-
tion term was significant in only two of the eight equations. For
the most part, the relationship between obesity and functional
illness was not conditional on age. Obesity was associated with
more functional illness, and this relationship held for younger
and older persons alike. The two instances where the Age X
Obesity interaction was significant were days ill in bed and
nights hospitalized at W2. In both instances, the relationship was
such that obese older respondents had lower rates of functional
illness. Obesity was associated with greater functional illness
risk, but the effect of obesity was greatest for younger respon-
dents, not older ones (Andres, 1995). Thus, there was no sup-
port for the hypothesis that the functional illness risk from obe-
sity is greater in later life.
There arefindingsin the literature that may help explain why
functional illness risks are higher for younger obese persons but
not for older obese persons. First, some have argued that body
weight, either overweight or underweight, is not as consequen-
tial to health among older people because morbidity is more
consequential at this life stage (Andres, 1995; Clark & Mungai,
1997; Van Itallie & Abraham, 1985). Second, although obesity
is a major risk factor for a host of diseases, there are a few ex-
ceptions to this rule. Fractures of the hip are less common
among obese older people--especially older women--appar-
ently because of higher bone mass associated with more weight
bearing, the role of adipose tissue in softening falls, or higher
endogenous estrogen levels (Grisso et al., 1997; Willett &
Manson, 1995). Third, older people tend to lose weight when
they experience health problems (Launer et al, 1994); thus, hav-
ing a higher BMI may act as a protective "buffer" during the
weight loss period (Diehr et al., 1998). Although these mecha-
nisms may help to explain the findings from ACL, future re-
search is needed to determine which, if any, can explain why
functional illness risk is higher for young obese than older
obese persons. Key to explicating these relationships may be
knowledge of how long obesity and morbidity are present over
the life course. Unfortunately, the ACL survey does not permit
such analyses.
Findings from the ACL are helpful in showing that middle
adulthood is when obesity seems most related to functional ill-
ness. It should be recalled that the middle adult years are also
when most people gain weight (Anderson & Kannel, 1992;
Launer et al., 1994; Stevens et al., 1993). Results from the ACL
show that excess body weight in these ages is associated with
more functional illness: There is a consequence for weight
gained during these ages.
There are three limitations to this research that merit consid-
eration. First, the functional illness measures in the ACL are
fairly basic; ADLs and instrumental activities of daily living
(IADLs) are more thorough and concrete measures of physical
function. Second, whereas only self-reported height and weight
are available, the results may be a conservative estimate of as-
sociation between obesity and functional illness (Bowman &
DeLucia, 1992). Third, as noted above, the only BMI measures
were of current weight and height self-reported at the time of
interview. Both previous research and cumulative disadvantage
theory lead to expectations that lifelong obesity would have the
strongest effects on health (Johnston, 1985). Future research
measuring when the weight gain occurred during the life course
may help further explain how obesity may lead to greater func-
tional illness.
Given the limited follow-up period in the ACL (less than 3
years), future research that either follows respondents for longer
periods of time or collects retrospective data on weight should
be most beneficial for enhancing our understanding about the
relationship between body weight and health. Although there is
no evidence from this investigation to support cumulative dis-
advantage theory, it remains a promising framework for the
topic if coupled with weight history data.
In sum, there is clear support for the first hypothesis associ-
ating obesity with greater functional illness but no evidence to
support the second hypothesis that obese older adults are at
higher risk of functional illness. The ACL data show that the
relationship between obesity and functional illness is, for the
BODYMASS INDEXAND FUNCTIONAL ILLNESS S347
most part, constant over the live course. In the few instances
where the relationship between obesity and functional illness
was conditional on age, the relationship was stronger among
younger and middle-aged respondents--parallel to the find-
ings on mortality (Andres, 1995). These results underscore the
importance of weight loss among obese young persons and
preventing weight gain in middle age in order to minimize
functional illness.
