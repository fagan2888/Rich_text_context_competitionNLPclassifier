Abstract
Recently, we proposed that the aftereffects of adapting to facial age are consistent with a
renormalization of the perceived age (e.g., so that after adapting to a younger or older age, all
ages appear slightly older or younger, respectively). This conclusion has been challenged by arguing
that the aftereffects can also be accounted for by an alternative model based on repulsion (in
which facial ages above or below the adapting age are biased away from the adaptor). However, we
show here that this challenge was based on allowing the fitted functions to take on values which
are implausible and incompatible across the different adapting conditions. When the fits are
constrained or interpreted in terms of standard assumptions about normalization and repulsion,
then the two analyses both agree in pointing to a pattern of renormalization in age aftereffects.

alternatives to this representation are a norm-based code, in which individual faces are
represented relative to how they deviate from an average or prototype, which is therefore
special; and an exemplar or multichannel code, in which each face is encoded by mechanisms
tuned to the absolute characteristics defining the face, with no face special (Valentine, Lewis,
& Hills, 2015). These alternatives predict very different patterns of aftereffects (Rhodes et al.,
2005; Webster & MacLeod, 2011). Yet distinguishing between them is difficult, partly because
these patterns depend on sampling the aftereffects at multiple levels along a face dimension.
Recently, we took advantage of the fact that facial age is among the few facial dimensions
that observers can readily scale (by assigning a perceived age) and used this to assess how
adaptation to one age affects the appearance of all others (O'Neil, Mac, Rhodes, & Webster,
2014). We found that the aftereffects for young and old faces were characterized by
approximately uniform shifts, while middle-aged faces judged as a norm for age produced
little aftereffect. We concluded from this pattern that adaptation to facial age is consistent
with a simple norm-based code. Storrs (2015) challenges this conclusion, arguing that the
aftereffects we reported are equally or better described by a pattern of local repulsion
predicted by a multichannel model. Here, we show that her analyses were based on
allowing the curve fits for repulsion to take on unrealistic and inconsistent values for the
underlying mechanisms. When the curve fits are constrained by conventional assumptions
about the channel models, then normalization provides a better account of the age
aftereffects, supporting our original claims.
To understand this debate, consider how the pattern of aftereffects differs for
normalization (norm-based coding) and repulsion (multichannel) as commonly construed
(e.g., Pond et al., 2013; Storrs & Arnold, 2015; Zhao, Series, Hancock, & Bednar, 2011).
The differences were illustrated in Figure 1 of O'Neil et al. (2014). For normalization, the
hallmark characteristics are:
(a) Aftereffects of similar size and in the same direction for all faces including the adapting
face, consistent with a shift in the appearance of the adapting face toward the norm.
Thus when adapting to a young face, all faces should look older.
(b) No aftereffect when adapting to the norm.
(c) Asymmetries in the aftereffects, such that adapting to an older or younger face alters the
norm, while adapting to the norm does not bias the perceived age of old and young faces.
For repulsion, the defining pattern is:
(a) Changes in opposite directions for faces on opposite sides of the adapting level. Faces
younger than the adapt age should appear even younger, and faces older than the adapt
age should appear even older.
(b) No change in the perceived age of the adapting level itself.
(c) A similar pattern at all adapting levels, and thus no asymmetries in the aftereffects
between different ages.
In our original report, we evaluated these alternatives by comparing regression lines fit to
the age estimates before or after adaptation. Normalization predicts approximately constant
shifts in the judgments, changing the intercept but not the slope of the function, while
adapting to the norm should produce neither a slope nor intercept change. Moreover,
normalization predicts the intercept changes should be in opposite directions for young
and old adaptors. This is the pattern we tested for and found. The perceptual expansion

produced by repulsion instead predicts a steepening of the slope and predicts that intercepts
would always be shifted and in the same direction (toward more negative values) for all three
adapt levels, a pattern we did not find (see Figure 1). The size of these linear shifts obviously
depends on the magnitude and bandwidth of the adaptation. Yet the aftereffects for repulsion
never predict the pattern we observed of opposite shifts in the intercepts after adaptation to
young versus old faces. From this we again conclude that the observed aftereffects are
consistent with the pattern predicted by normalization while inconsistent with the pattern
predicted by repulsion and that our original analyses based on testing the slopes and
intercepts were sufficient to distinguish between the alternative models.
In her commentary, Storrs raises several critiques of our work. One is that we did not
evaluate the aftereffects directly (i.e., the changes in the age ratings before and after
adaptation) but instead focused on the absolute ages under the different conditions.
However, this misrepresents what we did. While our regression fits were based on the
absolute perceived ages, the analyses we conducted explicitly assessed whether the slopes
Figure 1. Blue lines: Intercepts of linear regression lines fit to GD curves with different standard deviations.
All GDs were adjusted for a peak aftereffect ofÆ2.4, and spanned an age range from 18 to 89, with zero
crossings at the young (Y), Middle (M), or old (O) adapting ages. Black lines: intercept shifts for a uniform

or intercepts of the regression lines changed with adaptation. This is necessarily an
assessment of the aftereffect (of the change between pre- and postadapt settings) and one
which is equivalent to asking whether the aftereffect itself was constant across age (i.e., a
change in the intercept without a change in slope, the basic effect we found).
A second critique was that our analysis did not provide a fair test of a repulsion model. To
pursue this, Storrs instead compared how well the aftereffects were fit by a linear function
versus a Gaussian derivative (GD). Her choice of the GD was reasonable for simulating
repulsion but allowing the function to take on any values is not. In particular, Storrs
separately fit each adapting condition with a function that was free to vary in its
amplitude, bandwidth, and zero-crossing. To see why this is a problem, consider first the
fits she obtained to the young adapting age (Figure 2(a), green dashed line). Here, observers
were adapted to faces in their 30's, but the best fit occurs when the repulsion is centered not
on the adapt age, but instead crosses zero at an `age' of negative 5 years (4 decades from the
adapt level), and also has a very broad standard deviation (48 years). What should we
conclude from this? First, we argue that Storrs' analysis is not testing a viable model of
adaptation. If it were, then the conclusion would be that when adapting to the age of
young adults, the sensitivity losses were largest in channels tuned to an impossibly younger
age--to how old we looked before our parents met. Her analysis is instead an exercise in
curve fitting, in which the parameter values are not constrained to have a mechanistic
interpretation. Second, Storrs' argument is that this curve provides as good an estimate of
the aftereffects as a linear fit. However, this is not because very different functions fit the data
as well, but because the two fitted functions she estimated are in fact very similar over the
finite span of adult ages (18­89) at which the aftereffects were actually measured. As
Figure 2(a) shows, a GD function with very broad tuning and a very remote zero-crossing
approximates a linear change over the range of interest. In this regard it is not surprising that
an arbitrary GD can fit the data at least as well, because it includes an approximation to
locally linear effects as a possible solution. In fact this is the reason her repulsion fit predicts
the positive intercept change we reported for the young adapt condition--because over the
range of physically possible ages the repulsion is all in the same direction. Finally, the fact
that this roughly linear effect best describes the aftereffects also for the GD curve shows that
Storrs' own analysis yields the essential pattern of aftereffects predicted by normalization.
Specifically, both the GD and linear curve fits predict that adapting to faces in their 30's
biases all adult ages--including the adapting age--to appear older.
A similar problem occurs for the older adapting age (Figure 2(c)). Here again the best-
fitting GD function does not have a zero crossing at the adapt level (65), but is shifted now to
older ages (79; a difference as large as the age differences between our adapting conditions),
and the function again predicts aftereffects broadly similar to the pattern predicted by
normalization (i.e., after adapting to older faces, almost all faces--including the adapt
faces--appear younger). In this case, the tuning is narrower (SD ¼ 27) and the fits are not
as well captured by a constant change at all ages, a point noted in our original paper. Yet
the still very broad and consistent direction of the predicted aftereffects is again closer to the
hallmark pattern of normalization than repulsion.
The middle-age adapt condition reveals a further flaw in Storrs' analysis, which arises
because she fit each of the three adapting conditions independently (Figure 2(b)). Here again
the zero-crossing for the best-fitting GD curve is displaced from the expected null at the
adapting level (47 vs. 57). Yet more importantly, in this case, the bandwidth of the function is
now much narrower (6.5). This leads to fits for the GD functions which are internally
inconsistent as a model of the aftereffects. While the bandwidths of channels could
plausibly vary at different stimulus levels, they cannot simultaneously be so broad

that young and old adapt ages induce strong aftereffects in middle-ages (and each other), yet
so narrow that middle-age adaptation does not induce complementary repulsion on the
young and old ages. However, as curve fits, this asymmetry between the aftereffects for
middle ages versus young and old ages once more follows the pattern of aftereffects
expected by normalization. As her fitted GD functions predict, adapting to the young or
old faces biased middle-ages, while adapting to this norm did not produce corresponding
biases in the appearance of the young or old ages. Thus while Storrs argues that her analysis
contradicts our conclusions, simple inspection of the fitted functions shows that she has
instead confirmed that the aftereffects for all three adapt conditions follow the standard
pattern predicted for normalization, and not for repulsion.

What if we instead compare viable models of normalization versus repulsion, by
constraining the fitted functions to embody the characteristics that define conventional
implementations of these models? For repulsion, we used the GD function but forced the
null to coincide with the adapting level to reflect the hallmark of typical repulsion
aftereffects. Further, we required the strength and spread of the adaptation to be the same
at each adapting level, to preclude the implausibly large asymmetries in Storrs' independent
curve fits. This left two free parameters controlling the magnitude and bandwidth of the GD
function. For normalization, we assumed a very simple model in which there is no adaptation
to the norm, while adapting to younger or older ages produces a constant bias at all test ages.
Consistent with evidence from distortion aftereffects (Susilo, McKone, & Edwards, 2010), we
further required that the strength of the aftereffect increase in proportion to how far the adapt
age was from the norm. This leaves only a single free parameter controlling the magnitude of
the aftereffect. Fits from the two models are plotted in Figure 2 as the red (normalization) and
blue (repulsion) curves. Despite fewer degrees of freedom, the model of normalization provides
significantly better fits to the aftereffects than the model of repulsion (RMS error ¼ 2.66 for
normalization and 2.90 for repulsion, vs. 3.08 for no model). This was assessed with a
Wilcoxon-signed rank test of the relative errors for the two models, which makes minimal
assumptions and does not penalize the repulsion model for having more free parameters (across
all three adapt conditions combined: z ¼ 3.06, p ¼ .002). The normalization model also
outperformed the repulsion model for both the younger (RMS error ¼ 2.14 for
normalization and 2.63 for repulsion, vs. 2.79 for no model; z ¼ 3.42, p < .001) and older
(RMS error ¼ 2.78 for normalization and 3.09 for repulsion, vs. 3.45 for no model; z ¼ 2.14,
p ¼ .033) adapt conditions, while the two models did not differ from each other for the middle-
age adapt (RMS error ¼ 2.96 for normalization and 2.91 for repulsion; z ¼ 0.187, p ¼ .853), for
which normalization equals the prediction for no aftereffects. Thus, this analysis again confirms
that the aftereffects are better described by normalization than repulsion, at least when based
on standard and viable forms of these aftereffects.
The adaptation effects we measured were weak and it remains possible that elaborations of
either model might better describe the actual pattern of age aftereffects (e.g., Elliott,
Georgeson, & Webster, 2011). In fact, the normalization and repulsion models differ only
quantitatively and seamlessly in properties such as the number and bandwidth of the
mechanisms (Webster & MacLeod, 2011). However, the point we emphasize is that any
model comparisons should be based on realizable neural models, and not on curve fits in
which the parameters are allowed to take on implausible or impossible values for the
underlying adapted mechanisms. When the aftereffects are fit or interpreted in this way,
then both our analyses and Storrs' own are better captured by normalization.
