Spatial Demands of Concurrent Tasks
Can Compromise Spatial Learning of a
Virtual Environment: Implications for
Active Input Control
George Sandamas1 and Nigel Foreman1
Abstract
While active explorers in a real-world environment typically remember more about its spatial layout than participants who
passively observe that exploration, this does not reliably occur when the exploration takes place in a virtual environment
(VE). We argue that this may be because an active explorer in a VE is effectively performing a secondary interfering
concurrent task by virtue of having to operate a manual input device to control their virtual displacements. Six groups of
participants explored a virtual room containing six distributed objects, either actively or passively while performing
concurrent tasks that were simple (such as card turning) or that made more complex cognitive and motoric demands
comparable with those typically imposed by input device control. Tested for their memory for virtual object locations,
passive controls (with no concurrent task) demonstrated the best spatial learning, arithmetically (but not significantly)
better than the active group. Passive groups given complex concurrent tasks performed as poorly as the active group. A
concurrent articulatory suppression task reduced memory for object names but not spatial location memory. It was
concluded that spatial demands imposed by input device control should be minimized when training or testing spatial
memory in VEs, and should be recognized as competing for cognitive capacity in spatial working memory.

Introduction
Studies of human memory and spatial cognition have
benefited from the use of virtual environments (VEs;
Gamberini, 2000), for example, where real-world
exploration is limited by practical circumstances or where
the manipulation of experimental variables is impossible
given the constraints of the real world (e.g., Foreman,
Stanton-Fraser, Wilson, Duffy, & Parnell, 2005; Stanton,
Wilson, & Foreman, 2003; Wilson & Peruch, 2002).
Environments used to train and assess aspects of memory
have ranged from single rooms containing a few objects in
an otherwise empty space (Sandamas & Foreman, 2003;
Wilson, 1998) to more complex environments, such as
homes, schools, hospitals, office blocks, and shopping malls
(e.g., Brooks, Attree, Rose, Clifford, & Leadbetter, 1999;
Foreman, Sandamas, & Newson, 2004; Foreman et al.,
2005) to a part of a city (Maguire et al., 1998). A major
consideration in the use of VEs for psychological research
is that learning in a VE results in the acquisition of
representations of space that are (at least, functionally)
similar or equivalent to those acquired from real-world
exploratory experience (e.g., Foreman et al., 2005;
McComas, Dulberg, & Latter, 1997; Wilson & Peruch,
2002).
However, there is controversy over the degree to which
virtual and real environmental exploration is affected by the
active or passive status of participants. The usual finding in
real-world studies is that active engagement confers better
spatial learning for adults and children. Vehicle passengers
tend to learn less than drivers about the spatial layout of a
town (Appleyard, 1970; Hart & Berzok, 1982) and real-
world spatial learning is generally better in children after
active than passive learning (Foreman, Foreman,
Cummings, & Owens, 1990; Gibson, 1966; Herman &
Siegel, 1978).
Spatial learning in VEs, however, does not appear to be
reliably affected by the active or passive status of the
participant, and active status has sometimes been found to
be a disadvantage. This apparent anomaly was first
evidenced by Arthur (1996). Wilson and Peruch (2002,
Experiment 1) conducted a study in which participants
either actively explored a virtual environment or passively

observed an active participant's exploration, and then
attempted to remember the locations of four targets.
Surprisingly, subsequent orientation and way-finding
measures found more accurate judgments for passive
observers than active ones. In a second experiment, using a
within-subject design, Wilson and Peruch (2002) found no
difference between active and passive participants.
Sandamas and Foreman (2007) found that passive
participants were more accurate on a subsequent object
placement task than active participants whose
displacements they observed.
A possible explanation for these phenomena is that in
some situations working memory (WM) can become
overloaded and the performance of active participants is
compromised by the imposition of having to use an
unfamiliar input device to interface with the computer
(Sandamas & Foreman, 2007). The impact on
performance of having to operate an input device has been
generally overlooked in VE (or other) research, possibly
because device operation (whether mouse, joystick,
keyboard, or tailored device) has been regarded as non-
challenging. It has not been regarded as demanding a
significant amount of cognitive capacity, in the same way
that when a real-world environment is explored on foot,
bipedal locomotion is not considered a parallel task as it is
so familiar, automatic, and requires no training.
Nevertheless, this cannot be assumed to apply to the
manual guidance of virtual exploration. Indeed, it is
interesting that the manual movements required to operate
an input device and interface with software--especially 3-
D environment software--are similar to those required by
those tasks commonly used as concurrent tasks to disrupt
spatial learning in real-world spatial learning including
map learning (cf. Coluccia, 2008; Garden, Cornoldi, &
Logie, 2002). Baddeley (1993) has previously emphasized
that training and task familiarity must be crucial factors in
determining the extent to which concurrent tasks interfere
with each other. In terms of spatial learning, there is
evidence for such a model, since Sandamas, Foreman, and
Coulson (2009) restored the advantage that active
explorers should theoretically have by giving participants
greater time to familiarize themselves with the input
device. Active participants in this situation were more
accurate on the same object placement task as in
Sandamas and Foreman (2007) than passive participants,
indicating that extra training with the input device helps
alleviate the concurrent demand on WM caused by using
such a device.
Clearly, the model adopted here, which is the same as
that adopted by Coluccia (2008), Garden et al. (2002), and
Baddeley (1993), makes no assumptions about where in
WM the bottleneck or information overload occurs--it
might, for example, occur in a visual, spatial, or motoric
memory store, or at central executive level. Nevertheless, it
makes a clear prediction that the greater the spatial load
applied via a concurrent task, the less spatial information is
likely to be obtained from simultaneous exploration of a
VE.
This approach is standard, the dual-task approach being
the most commonly used paradigm for gauging resource
demands on WM (Guttentag, 1989) and has reliably
indicated that as the demands of concurrent tasks increase,
performance on a central task diminishes. For instance,
Garden et al. (2002, Experiment 1) found that both spatial
tapping and articulatory suppression tasks interfered with
the primary task of route learning from a segmented map.
Coluccia, Bosco, and Brandimonte (2007) found that map
learning, as demonstrated through map drawing, was
impaired when participants performed the same concurrent
spatial tapping task as Garden et al. (2002), but not when
performing a concurrent articulatory suppression task. Their
findings were interpreted as supporting their hypothesis that
visuo-spatial WM is implicated in spatial learning from
maps.
The present study tested both active and passive groups
for their memory for the layout of a virtual room containing
six objects. While observing a pre-recorded exploration
session, each passive group was challenged with a
simultaneous concurrent task, tasks varying according to
their spatial demands. Active explorers of VEs were
expected not to show any advantage over passive observers
due to the extra load placed on WM by having to operate an
input device (aka perform a concurrent spatial task).
Furthermore, to examine whether the spatial loading of a
concurrent task could be manipulated to negatively impact
to a lesser or greater degree on passive observers, different
concurrent tasks were carefully selected for their degree of
spatial demand. These required simple hand/finger
movements with no spatial sophistication (simple card
turning), hand/finger movements requiring spatial decisions
(sequential compass-point card-sorting), or hand/finger
movements to tap keyboard keys in a prescribed order
(mimicking the complex movements made by active
participants using keyboard keys to guide their virtual
spatial displacements). A final secondary task was also used
that was entirely non-spatial, or not spatially demanding, in
which condition spatial learning was expected to remain
unaffected. This was a verbal task (articulatory
suppression), which may rely on the WM phonological
loop, and while not affecting spatial memory per se was
anticipated to reduce memory for the names of objects
encountered within the VE.
Method
Participants
One hundred and fifty undergraduate participants (60 male,
90 female), aged between 18 and 54 years, with a mean of
23 years and a SD of 5.5, were recruited from the
undergraduate population and awarded course credits for
participation.

Apparatus and Procedure
All participants except those in the Active condition (see
below) watched a pre-recorded exploration of the VE made
by a confederate participant prior to the start of the
experiment. The VE was modeled using SuperScape VRT
3.0 software and constructed to represent a large room in
which six objects were arranged at floor level. These were a
flower in a pot, computer monitor, bottle, road traffic cone,
triangular road sign, and gramophone (see Figure 1). The
floor was green in color and the walls were lilac. One wall
had gray cupboards against it and another had windows and
wall-mounted radiators (see Figure 1). The confederate was
allowed to move freely about the environment, using four
keyboard keys to direct their displacements (forward, back,
left rotate, right rotate), and was requested to visit each of
the floor-level objects twice, but in an unsystematic way. A
visit was defined as moving close to an object so that it
occupied the entire screen. The room was devoid of any
other objects such as tables or chairs (see Figure 1). The VE
was displayed for all participants on a 21-inch monitor. The
entire exploration lasted 140 s. The route was recorded
using HyperCam 2 digital recording freeware. Participants
in the active condition each explored the VE for 140 s,
using the same input device and visiting each object twice
as the confederate had done. All participants were simply
instructed to "get to know the layout of the VE."
Each participant was allocated to one of the following
six conditions:
(1) Controls: These passive participants watched the
recording of the confederate's exploration of the VE
with no additional task.
(2) Simple card-sorting: Using a standard pack of
playing cards, participants were asked to pick up each
card in turn, turn it over, and place it face down next
to the original pack while viewing the recorded VE
exploration. Participants were asked to maintain a
turnover speed of approximately one card per second
without pause. They were asked to start turning cards
prior to the commencement of the recording.
(3) Complex card-sorting: The same standard pack of
cards was used as for the simple card-sorting
condition. However, participants in this group were
asked to pick up the first card and place it directly
above the pack. The next card was placed to the right
of the pack, the next beneath the pack, and the fourth
to the left of the pack; in other words, participants
placed the cards around the pack in a clockwise
direction to four compass points. This sequence (up-
right-down-left) was then repeated until the video
sequence ended. Participants were allowed a short
practice session prior to the commencement of the
recording to ensure that they understood and were
able to carry out the instructions.
(4) Verbal task (Articulatory suppression): Participants
were asked to repeat the days of the week, starting
with Monday, out loud at a rate of approximately one
per second, while viewing the recording.
(5) Spatial tapping: Participants were asked to
repeatedly tap a 12-key sequence on the number
keypad of a computer QWERTY keyboard, starting
with the 1 in the bottom left corner, at a rate of one
per second following a predefined Boustrophedon
sequence of 123654789654. Participants' keystrokes
were displayed on a separate computer screen to that
on which the VE was displayed so that their
performance could be monitored. If participants'
keystrokes became too slow--less than approximately
one every 2 s--or erratic, the experimenter gave them
a verbal prompt. This happened on only two
occasions. This task has been used previously by
Garden et al. (2002) and Coluccia (2008).
(6) Active: Participants explored the VE for 140 s using
the keyboard arrow keys to control displacements.
They were required to visit each object in the VE
twice. A visit was defined as moving close to an
object so that it occupied the entire screen.
Assessing Spatial Memory
At the end of the video sequence, each participant was
taken to a table several meters from the video screen, and
given a sheet of paper on which was depicted a birds eye
screen shot of the room layout but with only one of the
floor objects depicted (the road traffic cone). Colors were
authentic, exactly as those in the VE. Participants were
asked to indicate the positions of the missing floor objects
by drawing five crosses and to label each cross with the
name of the object. Where an object name was not recalled,
this was recorded and the participant was reminded of the
identity of the object and was asked to guess its location by
labeling one of the unlabeled crosses. This procedure was
necessary so that each participant had 5 scores for the

Siegel, 1978) and virtual (Brunswick, Martin, & Marzano,

studies.
Results
Performance was assessed along two factors, one spatial
(object location) and one non-spatial (object name). The
spatial measure (placement error) was calculated by placing
a transparent acetate sheet, on which all of the six floor
objects were depicted, over the floor plan on which
participants had indicated where they thought the object
positions were and measuring the distances between
participant-placed objects and the objects' original
positions. Thus, five error distances in millimeters were
obtained for each participant. From these, average
placement error scores were calculated. The non-spatial
measure was based simply on participants' memory for the
names objects encountered within the VE; as indicated
above, this was recorded when participants were making
their placement judgments.
Average Placement Error Scores
Average Placement Error (APE) scores were entered into a
two-way, 6  2 (Condition  Gender) Analysis of Variance
(ANOVA). There was no gender difference, F(1, 138) =
.29; p = .60, 2
p
 = .002, nor any significant Condition 
Gender interaction, F(5, 138) = .20; p = .96, 2
p
 = .007.
However, conditions did differ significantly, F(5, 138) =
3.42; p = .006, 2
p
 = .11. Tukey's post hoc comparisons
showed that complex card-sorting (p = .018) and spatial
tapping (p = .044) participants performed significantly
worse than controls. All other comparisons were non-
significant at p = .05 (see Table 1).
Figure 2 above shows placement error (in mm) in order
of magnitude by condition.
Memory for Objects
Memory for the names of the objects encountered was
initially entered as a dependent variable (DV) in the two-
way ANOVA, as used above with APE scores; however,
Levene's test for homogeneity of variance was highly
significant (p < .001) and the data were highly negatively
skewed; therefore, the following non-parametric treatment
of the data was conducted.
As can be seen from Figure 3 above, only the median
score (3.0) for participants in the verbal (articulatory
suppression) condition was markedly lower than
participants in the other conditions all of whom scored 5.0.
Table 2 shows the spread of data (frequencies) for object
memory by condition. Examination of the figures shows the
negative skew of the data in that most participants
remembered all of the objects they encountered within the
VE. The exception was the verbal (articulatory suppression)
condition. Participants' object memory data were subjected
to a KruskalWallis analysis with condition as the
independent variable. The result was significant, 2(5, N =
150) = 44.37, p < .001.
Discussion
This study set out to further explore the idea that the spatial
learning of active participants in virtual studies may be
negatively affected by the imposition of having to use an
input device and also that this imposition can be replicated
by having passive participants perform a spatially
demanding concurrent task. To some extent the findings
have supported this notion and the hypothesis that spatial
learning would be negatively affected by a spatially
demanding concurrent task but not by a non-spatially
demanding one was supported. Participants in the complex
card-sorting and spatial tapping conditions were
significantly worse than those in the control group, making
significantly greater placement errors, whilst participants in
the simple card-sorting and verbal conditions performed at
an equivalent level. These findings concur with previous
research, which indicates that a spatially demanding
secondary task interferes with effective spatial learning
about an environment (e.g., Coluccia, 2008; Coluccia et al.,
2007; Garden et al., 2002) while a non-spatially demanding

one does not (e.g., Coluccia, 2008; Coluccia et al., 2007).
Moreover, as hypothesized, participants in the verbal
(articulatory suppression) condition remembered
significantly fewer object names than participants in the
control group and all other groups but were no worse at
remembering object positions, illustrating perhaps a
6 SAGE Open
dissociation between spatial and sematic memory and that
the verbal and spatial concurrent tasks in the current study
selectively disrupt WM as in the studies of Coluccia et al.
(2007), Coluccia (2008), and others.
Participants were carefully observed for evidence of
their shifting attention overtly from the screen to the
concurrent task, though no evidence was seen of this
systematically. Unsurprisingly, the keyboard-tapping task
was most prone to this, seen occasionally in some
participants, although this task has been successfully used
as a concurrent task in previous comparable real-world
studies (Coluccia, 2008; Garden et al., 2002). Moreover,
while both of the complex concurrent tasks suppressed
performance on the spatial memory measure, no obvious
overt shifts of attention could be detected for the complex
card-sorting task. Future work could use measures of
performance on concurrent tasks (including speed-accuracy
trade-off) that could provide further evidence for the
distribution of attention and cognitive capacity among the
primary and concurrent tasks. For present purposes, it was
clear that participants in all conditions were engaged with
the tasks given to them.
Of particular interest here, however, is how
participants in the active condition performed compared
with the other groups. As discussed above, based on the
findings of previous real-world studies such as Foreman
et al. (1990), Gibson (1966), Herman and Siegel (1978),
and others, one would expect participants who actively
explored the environment to have an advantage in terms
of spatial learning over passive observers. This
advantage, however, is not reliably found in virtual
studies (e.g., Arthur, 1996; Sandamas & Foreman, 2007;
Wilson & Peruch, 2002), and here participants in the
active condition were no better than passive controls and
performed at a level equivalent to that of participants
undertaking a spatially demanding concurrent task.
Although not fully congruent with our hypotheses, as
active participants were arithmetically worse (but not
statistically significantly worse) than passive controls,
these findings still provide additional evidence to that of
Sandamas et al. (2009) in support of the notion that
spatial learning in VEs is disrupted by the imposition of
using an input device to explore and that any advantage
that active explorers of a VE might have is compromised
by this. We accept that the present complex concurrent
tasks may have made greater demands on cognitive
capacity than the operation of an input device. However,
the pattern of current results strongly suggests that in
VE-based training and testing, active participants are
prevented from taking advantage of their active status,
by virtue of having to use up some visuo-spatial WM
capacity in input device control. This is further suggested
by the results of Sandamas et al. (2009) who found that
additional training with an input device restored the
active advantage in children, indicating that the extra
training reduced input device demands on WM.

The result poses questions regarding the degree of
spatial-motor disruption that occurs in the performance of
familiar real-world tasks, where an active advantage over
passive exploratory experience is usually obtained. For
example, the motor movements made in controlling a
motor vehicle (depressing pedals, steering, and operating
gears) might also be expected to disrupt spatial learning,
yet anecdotally (see Hart & Berzok, 1982), drivers
typically obtain more spatial information than a passive
passenger. It is likely that in well-trained motor tasks, the
impact of spatial-motor movements is reduced. Driving
becomes an automatic behavior, except when conscious
attention is required to modify a sub-program, as when
traffic suddenly slows and a driver has to react. It is likely
that at moments when such distractions occur, spatial
information cannot be processed. Likewise, a novice
driver is unlikely to acquire as much spatial information
after driving a route in an unfamiliar town as an
experienced motorist.
The present data are also of interest in relation to
previous studies in which children with disabling conditions
were able to find their way around school buildings after a
period of virtual exploration (Foreman et al., 2005). In
some cases, children unable to operate an input device were
trained by having them observe the displacements of an
active explorer, who took instructions but operated the input
device on their behalf. Far from disadvantaging the disabled
children, it is likely that they were allowed more cognitive
capacity to apply to the learning of the environment and
would have been disadvantaged by having to operate an
unfamiliar input device. This clearly has wider training
implications.
In summary, this study was conducted to further
investigate the suggestion of Sandamas and Foreman (2007)
that active explorers of VEs do not demonstrate the expected
advantage in spatial learning over passive observers due to
the added demands on WM of having to use an unfamiliar
input device to interface with the computer. Sandamas et al.
(2009) addressed this problem by giving participants extra
time to familiarize themselves with the input device. They
found that this restored the expected advantage for activity
and proposed that this was because the extra training reduced
input device demands on WM. Here we have approached the
problem using the concurrent task paradigm and found that
concurrent tasks with a spatial element, estimated to load
Sandamas and Foreman 7
WM at least to the same extent as using an unfamiliar input
device, can disrupt spatial learning of a VE layout thereby
lending further support to the initial proposition of Sandamas
and Foreman (2007).
Although the current findings are congruent with our own
previous research findings regarding spatial learning in VEs
and the research findings of others regarding spatial learning
with other media and the implication of WM (see above),
further research is currently underway in which our procedures
are being refined to address the possible criticism of the current
findings that they may not dissociate all of the WM
components implicated in the observed effects. For instance,
both complex spatial tasks involve elements of planning and
decision making (arguably Central Executive functions) not
present in simpler and non-spatial tasks. It may also be
possible to dissociate visual working memory from spatial
working memory with refinements of the current approach,
using VEs, to determine where within the WM system
information bottlenecks occur.
