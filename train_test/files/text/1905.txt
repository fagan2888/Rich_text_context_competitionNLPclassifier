Infection with Toxoplasma gondii can lead to congeni-
tal and acquired disease, resulting in loss of vision and
neurologic illness. We tested sera collected in the National
Health and Examination Survey (NHANES) from
1999­2000 for T. gondii­specific immunoglobulin G anti-
bodies and compared these results with results from sera
obtained in the NHANES III survey (1988­1994). NHANES
collects data on a nationally representative sample of the
U.S. civilian population. Of 4,234 persons 12­49 years of
age in NHANES 1999­2000, 15.8% (age-adjusted, 95%
confidence limits [CL] 13.5, 18.1) were antibody positive;
among women (n = 2,221) 14.9% (age-adjusted, 95% CL
12.5, 17.4) were antibody positive. T. gondii antibody
prevalence was higher among non-Hispanic black persons
than among non-Hispanic white persons (age-adjusted
prevalence 19.2% vs. 12.1%, p = 0.003) and increased with
age. No statistically significant differences were found
between T. gondii antibody prevalence in NHANES
1999­2000, and NHANES III. T. gondii antibody preva-
lence has remained stable over the past 10 years in the
United States.
Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous protozoan parasite of
warm-blooded animals. However, only members of the
cat family (Felidae) are definitive hosts for the organism,
which is shed in their feces for several weeks after the
organism has completed a sexual cycle in their intestinal
epithelial cells. Infection in humans generally occurs either
by ingesting viable tissue cysts in raw or undercooked
meat or by ingesting oocysts shed in the feces of a cat.
After acute infection, T. gondii continues to exist in tissue
cysts in humans, particularly in the muscles and brain.
However, in people with immunodeficiencies such as
AIDS or malignancies, rupture of cysts results in disease
reactivation, including encephalitis or disseminated toxo-
plasmosis. Immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies to T. gondii
appear early, reach a peak within 6 months after infection,
and are detectable for life.
When a pregnant woman is infected for the first time,
and the infection spreads to the fetus, congenital T. gondii
infection may be clinically apparent in the neonate in the
first months of life or later during infancy, childhood, or
adolescence (i.e., cause neurologic or eye damage) or may
remain subclinical. An estimated 400 to 4,000 cases of
congenital toxoplasmosis occur each year in the United
States (1). In an analysis of data from a large HIV-infected
cohort, toxoplasmosis was found to be the most frequent
severe neurologic infection among persons with AIDS in
the United States, even after the advent of highly active
antiretroviral therapy (2).
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
estimates that one half of T. gondii infections in the United
States are caused by ingestion of raw or undercooked
infected meat (3). A community-based study in Maryland,
comparing persons who did not eat meat with those who
did eat meat, supports the USDA estimate (4). In 1999,
Mead and colleagues estimated that of the 750 deaths
caused by toxoplasmosis each year, one half were the
result of eating raw or undercooked meat, making toxo-
plasmosis the third leading cause of foodborne deaths (5).
To present the prevalence of infection in the U.S. pop-
ulation, we report the Toxoplasma-specific IgG results of
the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) con-
ducted in 1999­2000 and compare the prevalence of
Toxoplasma IgG antibody seropositivity during these years
to the prevalence observed previously in NHANES III
1988­1994. In the NHANES III national probability sam-
ple, 22.5% of 17,658 persons >12 years of age had
Toxoplasma-specific IgG antibodies, indicating that they
had been infected with the organism (published prevalence
was age-adjusted to the 1980 U.S. population; prevalence
for same population age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. popula-
tion is 23.6%) (6).

tive sample of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized popu-
lation, selected with a stratified, multistage, probability
cluster design. Data are collected on health measures and
conditions through household interviews, standardized
physical examinations, and blood samples obtained at
mobile examination centers. The procedures followed to
select the sample and conduct the interviews and examina-
tions are similar to those of previous NHANES surveys
(6). The continual NHANES is released in 2-year group-
ings (cycles). Two or more years of data are necessary to
have adequate sample sizes for subgroup analyses. This
report is based on the first 2 years of the continual
NHANES (1999­2000).
Serum samples were available for testing for T. gondii
antibodies from a nationally representative sample of per-
sons 6­49 years of age in NHANES 1999­2000 and from
persons >12 years of age in NHANES III. To compare
NHANES 1999­2000 with NHANES III, the principal
analyses are limited to the overlapping age groups (i.e.,
12­49 years of age) and stratified on variables previously
examined in NHANES III (6). Age was grouped as 12­19,
20­29, 30­39, and 40­49 years. In NHANES III, serum
specimens were also available from a limited number of
children 6­11 years of age (n = 1,819, 48% of children
sampled in this age range). Although the NHANES III data
in this 6­11 year age group cannot be considered national-
ly representative because of the low response rate, we
present the previously calculated prevalence (6) for this
group in our results because these are the only U.S. data
available for this age.
Race/ethnicity was defined as self-reported non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or Mexican American
(in NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2000, oversampling
of Mexican Americans was conducted to ensure adequate
sample size for this group). In NHANES 1999­2000, the
race/ethnicity variable used was the one most consistent
with the NHANES III race/ethnicity coding. The
NHANES 1999­2000 sample size was not sufficient to
stratify by other racial and ethnic groups; however, these
groups were included in the estimates given for the total
study population.
Informed consent was obtained from patients or their
parents or guardians, and human subjects review guide-
lines of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services were followed in the conduct of this research.
Laboratory Testing
NHANES 1999­2000 specimens were tested by using
the Platelia Toxo-G enzyme immunoassay kit (BioRad,
Hercules, CA), according to the manufacturer's instruc-
tions. Results were reported in international units (IU);
samples with >10 IU were considered positive for T.
gondii IgG antibodies. NHANES III serum specimens had
been tested with the same kit, however >6 IU was used as
a cutoff for seropositivity. As a result of minor changes in
the kit, the company changed the IU cutoff value for kits
used to test the 1999­2000 sera. However, test positivity
should be considered to be equivalent for both studies,
regardless of the cutoff values.
Statistical Analysis
Prevalence estimates were weighted to represent the
U.S. population, to account for oversampling in specific
demographic subgroups, and to account for nonresponses
to the household survey and to the physical examination.
Estimates and standard errors were calculated by using
SUDAAN (7). Standard errors for NHANES 1999­2000
were estimated by means of the delete 1 jackknife (JK1)
method (8). In previous NHANES surveys, the Taylor
series linearization method was used to estimate standard
errors. These standard errors account for the sample
weights and complex sample design. Prevalence estimates
were age-adjusted by the direct method to the 2000 U.S.
population for both NHANES III and NHANES
1999­2000 when seroprevalence was compared across
population subgroups. Ninety-five percent confidence
intervals were calculated by using a t-statistic; p values test-
ing the significance of the difference in prevalence between
NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2000 were obtained by
using a t-statistic with the combined standard error.
Results
Of the 4,875 persons 12­49 years of age who were
selected for NHANES 1999­2000, a total of 4,602
(94.4%) persons were interviewed and underwent physi-
cian examination; of these, 4,234 persons (86.9% of those
selected) had serum specimens tested for T. gondii anti-
bodies. In NHANES 1999­2000, the percentage of those
tested for T. gondii IgG antibodies among those examined
did not vary by race/ethnicity, sex, or country of birth.
Some variability existed, but no consistent trend, with age
in the percentage of persons with sera tested among those
examined (range 91% to 94%). Of the 4,234 persons test-
ed for T. gondii IgG antibodies, 638 (15.8%, age-adjusted,
95% confidence limits [CL] 13.5, 18.1) were antibody pos-
itive. Among women (n=2,221), 14.9% (age-adjusted,
95% CL, 12.5, 17.4) were antibody positive. T. gondii anti-
body prevalence for men was similar to that for women
(age-adjusted, 16.7% vs. 14.9%, respectively, p=0.28),
higher among non-Hispanic blacks than among non-
Hispanic whites (age-adjusted, 19.2% vs. 12.1%,
p=0.003), and higher as age increased (Table). The T.
gondii antibody prevalence was also higher in Mexican
Americans than in non-Hispanic whites, but the difference
was not statistically significant (16.8% vs. 12.1%,
p=0.051). In NHANES III, the age-adjusted seropreva-

SYNOPSES
lence was similar for men and women and higher in
Mexican Americans than in non-Hispanic whites in the
12­49 year age range.
No significant differences were found between
NHANES 1999­2000 and NHANES III T. gondii antibody
prevalences overall or in any of the sex, race, or age cate-
gories (Table, comparing values horizontally by rows). In
NHANES 1999­2000, children 6­11 years of age had a T.
gondii antibody prevalence of 8.0% (95% CL 4.5, 11.5, N =
855) (data not shown in table). In NHANES III, the anti-
body prevalence for children 6­11 years of age was 5.2%
(6), however, as noted in Methods, this estimate may be
subject to nonresponse error (data not shown in table).
The T. gondii antibody prevalence was higher in persons
born outside the United States than in U.S.-born persons for
both NHANES 1999­2000 and NHANES III (age-adjust-
ed, 32.8% vs. 12.2% and 27.9% vs. 14.1%, respectively,
Table), but among persons born outside the United States
seroprevalence did not differ significantly between
NHANES 1999­2000 and NHANES III (p>0.05). In addi-
tion, the percentage of persons that were born outside the
United States was not significantly different in NHANES
1999­2000 (16.3%, 95% CL 11.8%, 20.7%) compared with
the percentage of persons born outside the United States in
NHANES III (13.3%, 95% CL 10.9%, 15.7%) (p > 0.05).
Discussion
We found an overall T. gondii IgG antibody prevalence
of 15.8% among persons 12­49 years of age in
1999­2000, indicating that approximately 1 in 6 persons in
this age group was infected with T. gondii. No significant
changes in T. gondii seroprevalence occurred between
1988­1994 and 1999­2000 for the U.S. population as a
whole or for any of the subgroups we examined. We had
speculated that changes in meat production with lower lev-
els of T. gondii in meat (9) might result in a reduction in
the prevalence of T. gondii infection in the population.
Perhaps the time was not sufficient for changes in meat
production and consumption habits to have had an impact,
or perhaps the expected declines in T. gondii infection
occurred before NHANES III. The prevalence of T. gondii
infection declined in U.S. military recruits, when 1965
data were compared with 1989 data (10) and in countries
in Europe, such as France and Belgium, during similar
periods (11).
Predicting future trends in T. gondii prevalence in the
United States is difficult because we do not have a nation-
al estimate of what proportion of T. gondii infections are
attributable to undercooked meat exposure or to cat feces,
soil, or water exposure. A large European case-control
study that examined these factors showed that under-
cooked meat accounted for the largest portion of risk for T.
gondii infection (30%­63%, depending on location) (12).
However, until researchers examine the risk factors for T.
gondii infection in a case-control study throughout the
United States, the most important U.S. risk factors and
how to best focus preventive education messages will not
be determined.
In NHANES 1999­2000, the T. gondii antibody preva-
lence was higher among non-Hispanic black persons than
non-Hispanic white persons. This finding may reflect
immigration patterns from countries with higher rates of T.

gondii infection or soil exposure and culinary practices
among these different populations. The seroprevalence
among persons born outside the United States tended to be
higher in NHANES 1999­2000 than in NHANES III, and
the percentage of persons born outside the United States
tended to be higher in NHANES 1999­2000 than
NHANES III, but these findings were not statistically sig-
nificant. Clearly, in both NHANES III and NHANES
1999­2000 the seroprevalence is higher among persons
not born in the United States than in U.S.-born persons.
The NHANES 1999­2000 sample population is not large
enough to stratify racial/ethnic groups by foreign-birth sta-
tus and obtain accurate estimates; however, in a multivari-
ate analysis reported previously that used NHANES III
data (6), being born outside the United States was a signif-
icant risk factor for T. gondii seropositivity. However,
race/ethnicity did not increase risk (using white non-
Hispanic persons as the reference group).
NHANES gives representative estimates of prevalence
for the U.S. population but is not designed to evaluate local
T. gondii prevalence levels. Studies have indicated that T.
gondii prevalence varies greatly in the United States
(10,13,14); this local variation is most likely related to
culinary practices, the ability of oocysts to survive in dif-
ferent climates, and the levels of immigration from areas
of the world in which T. gondii infection is highly endem-
ic. Nevertheless, NHANES produces useful surveillance
data for tracking T. gondii prevalence over time in the
United States. We will continue to monitor trends in this
nationally representative survey.
