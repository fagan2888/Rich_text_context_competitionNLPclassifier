Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the radiosensitivity effect of CpG oligodeoxyribonucleotide (ODN) 7909
on human epidermoid cancer strain-2 (Hep-2) cells in vitro and discuss the potential for improved
radiotherapy treatment in patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.
Methods: Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 expression was assessed in Hep-2 cells using Western blots
and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Cell Counting Kit-8 was used to detect
Hep-2 cell viability at 24 and 48 h following treatment with different CpG ODN7909 concen-
trations. Cellular colonization was evaluated using microscopy. Cell cycle distribution and
apoptosis rate was determined with flow cytometry. Interleukin (IL)-12 and tumour necrosis
factor (TNF)-a concentrations were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Results: Hep-2 cells were found to express TLR9, and CpG ODN7909 treatment suppressed
Hep-2 cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Cell survival curve analyses revealed a
sensitivity enhancement ratio of the mean death dose of 1.225 for CpG ODN7909 plus irradi-
ation versus irradiation alone. Furthermore, the population of Gap 2/mitotic-phase cells, apo-
ptosis rate and secreted IL-12 and TNF-a levels were significantly increased in Hep-2 cells treated
with CpG ODN7909 plus irradiation versus IR alone.
Conclusion: CpG ODN7909 enhanced the radiosensitivity of Hep-2 cells in vitro.

Introduction
Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma
(LSCC), a highly aggressive malignancy
with 5-year overall survival of approximately
61%, is one of the most common malignant
otolaryngology tumours and ranks second
among cancers derived from epithelial cells
in the head and neck.1­3 Radiotherapy is a
clinically important treatment method for
patients with LSCC, however, the mode of
LSCC treatment is changing and increasing
numbers of clinicians focus on how to pre-
serve the function and original structure of
the larynx. Recent years have seen a trend
toward improved post-treatment voice qual-
ity in patients with early-stage LSCC treated
with external radiation.4­7
Radiotherapy is not only an adjuvant
treatment following surgery, but also an
important treatment for patients with local-
ly advanced LSCC who can't undergo sur-
gical resection or who have a strong desire
to protect the larynx.8,9 Various studies
have shown that irradiation (IR) combined
with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs,
such as cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu),
may achieve better results compared with
IR alone.10­13 Nevertheless, there remains
a risk of recurrence and metastasis in
some patients with LSCC, for whom the
efficacy of re-irradiation is poor and radia-
tion resistance is prone to occur, resulting in
reduced quality of life and shorter life
span.14 Hence, there is an urgent need to
explore an effective radiosensitizer in the
treatment of the patients with LSCC.
Recent studies have indicated that syn-
thetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing
unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine
motifs (CpG ODNs) may induce anti-
tumour responses as immunoadjuvants in
combination with other therapies, via inter-
acting with toll-like receptors (TLRs) that
play a fundamental role in the innate
immune system.15­17 Moreover, a previous
study by the present authors suggested that
TLR9, recognized by CpG ODN7909, is also
expressed in human non-small cell lung cancer
(A549) cells, and CpG ODN7909 was shown
to potentiate X-ray-induced inhibition of pro-
liferation in this cell line.18 Nevertheless, the
role of CpG ODN7909 on the radiosensitivity
of human epidermoid cancer strain 2 (Hep-2)
cells, a human laryngeal carcinoma-derived
cell line, remains unclear.
In the present study, TLR9 expression,
and the role of CpG ODN7909 on Hep-2
cell radiosensitivity, was assessed. The effects
of CpG ODN7909 on cytokine secretion,
cellular proliferation, cell cycle distribution
and apoptosis was also investigated in the
Hep-2 cells.
Materials and methods
Cell culture and CpG ODN7909
Hep-2 cells purchased from the Chinese
Type Culture Collection (CTCC; Wuhan,
China) were maintained in the following
culture medium: Minimum essential
medium (MEM; BioWest, Loire Valley,
France) supplemented with 10% foetal
bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, ThermoFisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), 100 U/ml
penicillin G, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin at
37C in a humidified atmosphere of 95%
air and 5% CO2
. CpG ODN7909 (50-
TCGTCGTTTTGTCGTTTTGTCGTT-30)
was obtained from Shanghai Sangon
Biological Engineering Technology and
Services Limited Company (Sangon,
Shanghai, China), dissolved in phosphate
buffer saline (PBS; 0.01 M, pH 7.4) and
maintained at ­20C until use.
Western blotting
Whole cells were lysed in protein lysis
buffer with 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl
fluoride. Total proteins were harvested
by centrifugation (14 000 g for 15 min at
4C), and protein concentrations were
2010 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
determined by the Bradford Assay. Briefly,
equal amounts of proteins (50 mg) were
separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate-
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and trans-
ferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (EMD
Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Membranes
were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin
(BSA) and then incubated overnight at 4C
with monoclonal mouse anti-TLR9 antibody
(1:1 000 dilution; Cell Signalling Technology,
Beverly, MA, USA) and glyceraldehyde-3-
phosphate dehydrogenase primary antibody
(GAPDH;1:5000 dilution; Cell Signalling
Technology, Beverly, MA, USA). After
three washes with Tris-buffered saline
Tween-20 (TBS-T; pH 7.6; 20 mM Tris-
HCl, 150 mM NaCl and 0.1 % Tween 20),
the membrane was incubated with horserad-
ish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-
rabbit IgG (1:5 000 dilution; Kaiji, Jiangsu
China) at room temperature for 1 h. The
membrane was finally washed three times
with TBS-T. TLR9 protein levels were
expressed as the optical density value of the
target protein/GAPDH using a G:BOX
ChemiXR5 gel doc system with Gel-Pro32
software (Syngene, Cambridge, UK).
Reverse transcription (RT) polymerase
chain reaction (PCR)
Total RNA was extracted from 5 Â 106
Hep-2 cells using TRIzolV
R Reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), then
reverse transcribed to cDNA using a
PrimeScriptTM RT Master Mix (TaKaRa,
Dalian, China) according to the manufac-
turers' instructions. The cDNA was then
amplified using the following TLR9
primer sequences: 50-GCAAAGTGGGCG
AGATGAGGAT-30 (forward) and 50-GA
GTGAGCGGAAG AAGATGC-30
(reverse), with AccuPowerV
R 2X GreenstarTM
qPCR Master Mix (Bioneer Corporation,
Daejeon, South Korea). PCR was preformed
using the LightCyclerV
R 480 system (Roche
Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) with the
following thermal-cycling conditions: 5 min
at 95C for pre-denaturation, followed by 32
cycles of 30 s at 95C for denaturation, 30 s at
56C for annealing, 45 s at 72C for elonga-
tion, and a final extension at 72C for 10 min.
The 578 bp reaction product was resolved by
electrophoresis using a 1.5% agarose gel,
stained with ethidium bromide, and photo-
graphed using an ultraviolet transilluminator.
Radiation exposure
Hep-2 cells were exposed to 6 MV X-rays
using a linear accelerator (Varian Medical
Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA) under the
source-to-skin distance of 100 cm, with a
dose rate of 2.0 Gy/min. Graded irradiated
doses, ranging from 0 to 10 Gy, were used
in Hep-2 clonogenic survival assays. For all
other experiments, 10 Gy radiation was
employed.
Detection of cell viability via cell counting
kit-8 (CCK-8)
Each well of 96-well plates were seeded with
6 Â 103 Hep-2 cells in 100 ml of culture
medium. Various concentrations of CpG
ODN7909 (0, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 60 mg/ml)
were added, and the cells incubated for 24
or 48 h at 37C. Following CpG ODN7909
treatment, 10 ml of CCK-8 reagent (Dojindo
Laboratories, Kami Mashiki-gun, Japan)
was added to each well, and the cells incu-
bated for a further 3 h at 37C in the dark.
Optical densities were then measured at 450
nm, and cell viability of CpG-treated cells
was calculated as a proportion of the
untreated cells, as follows: absorbance of
CpG-treated cells/absorbance of untreated
cells (0 mg/ml CpG ODN7909)Â 100. Hep-
2 cells were then seeded as before, and equal-
ly randomized into four groups, comprising:
control group, CpG ODN7909-treated
group (CpG group), irradiation group (IR
group), and CpG ODN7909 þ irradiation
group (CpG þ IR group). Based on the
Wang et al. 2011
initial cell viability results, Hep-2 cells in the
CpG and CpG þ IR groups were treated
with CpG ODN7909 at a final concentration
of 10 mg/ml, and cells in all groups were cul-
tured for 24 h. Following 24 h culture at
37C, cells in the IR and CpG þ IR groups
were then exposed to 10 Gy radiation.
A further 24 or 48 h following irradiation,
cell viability was determined in all cells using
the CCK-8 assay. All experiments were per-
formed three times for each condition.
Clonogenic survival assay
Hep-2 cells were divided into two treatment
groups and incubated for 24 h with or with-
out CpG ODN7909 at a final concentration
of 10 mg/ml. Cells were then irradiated with
varying IR doses of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 Gy,
and harvested using 0.05% trypsin-EDTA
solution for 1­2 min at 37C. Cells were
then re-seeded into 60 mm dishes at 500­
3 000 cells per dish, as previously
described,19 in triplicate. Following incuba-
tion for 14 days, colonies were stained with
crystal violet and fixed in methanol. The
number of stained colonies (not less than
50 cells) was imaged and counted manually
under a microscope. The clonogenic surviv-
al fraction (%) was calculated as follows:
(irradiated cell colony numbers/unirradi-
ated cell colony numbers) Â 100. The radio-
biological parameters (D0
, N, Dq
) were
analysed with a single-hit multi-target
model. D0
is the radiation dose that can
reduce survival by a factor of 1/e in the
exponential region of the curve, N is the
extrapolation number or zero-dose extrap-
olate, Dq
is the quasithreshold dose,
Dq
¼ D0
Â ln N.20
Cell cycle and apoptosis analysed
by flow cytometry
Hep-2 cells, growing in logarithmic phase in
six-well plates, were divided into four treat-
ment groups (control group, CpG group,
IR group, and CpG þ IR group) as above.
After 24 and 48 h exposure to 10 Gy radi-
ation (IR groups only), cells of each group
were harvested. The cell cycle distribution
(proportion of cells in Gap 2/Mitotic phase
[G2/M]) was detected by measuring the
DNA content stained with propidium
iodide (PI; BD Biosciences, San Jose,
USA) in the presence of RNase, according
to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly,
at 24 or 48 h post irradiation, Hep-2 cells
were harvested using 0.05% trypsin-EDTA
and centrifuged at 233 g at room tempera-
ture for 5 min. The cells were then fixed
with 70% cold ethanol overnight at
­20C, then incubated with 500 ml of stain-
ing solution (containing 200 ml of RNase/
PI) at room temperature for 15 min in the
dark prior to flow cytometry. The propor-
tion of apoptotic cells was determined using
an annexin V fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC) apoptosis detection kit (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, USA). Briefly, har-
vested cell pellets were resuspended in
190 ml binding buffer and stained with 5 ml
of annexin V FITC and 5 ml of PI staining
solution for 30 min at room temperature in
the dark. Cell cycle and apoptosis were
evaluated by flow cytometry using a
FACScanTM system with CellQuestTM soft-
ware, version 3.3 (Becton Dickinson,
Mountain View, CA, USA), according to
the manufacturer's instructions. The pro-
portion of cells in G2/M phase was calcu-
lated as: (number of cells in G2/M phase/
total number of cells) Â 100. Apoptosis rate
(%) was calculated as previously
described:21 (number of apoptotic cells/
total number of cells) Â 100.
Measurement of interleukin (IL)-12 and
tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a release
Hep-2 cells divided into four treatment
groups were cultured in six-well plates and
treated as above. At 24 or 48 h post-
radiation, the cell culture supernatants
2012 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
were collected and stored at ­80C. Human
IL-12 ValukineTM enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay (ELISA) kit and Human
TNF-alpha ValukineTM ELISA Kit (R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) were
used to measure secreted IL-12 and TNF-
a levels, respectively.
Statistical analyses
GraphPad Prism software, version 5.0
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA)
was used for data analyses and graph pro-
duction. All data are presented as mean
Æ SD of at least three independent experi-
ments. A single-hit multi-target model was
used to fit colony counts to a clonogenic
survival curve. Differences in cell viability,
flow cytometric analyses or secreted cyto-
kine levels between the treatment groups
were determined by one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) using Tukey's honest
significant difference (HSD) multiple com-
parisons test. The two treatment groups in
the clonogenic survival assay were analysed
using Student's t-test. A P-value <0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
Expression of TLR9 in Hep-2 cells
Western blots and RT-PCR results showed
that TLR9 was expressed in Hep-2 cells.
The optical density value of TLR9/
GAPDH was 0.55 (Figure 1a), and RT-
PCR revealed a product of 578 bp, which
corresponded to the expected TLR9 frag-
ment size (Figure 1b).
Cell viability
In Hep-2 cells treated with CpG ODN7909
at 0, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 60 mg/ml, cell viability
was shown to be inhibited in a dose-and
time-dependent manner (P <0.01), dis-
played by a gradually increasing inhibitory
effect with increasing CpG ODN7909 con-
centrations and lower cell viability at the
higher concentrations between 24 and 48 h
(Figure 2a). In Hep-2 cells with or without

CpG ODN7909 treatment at 10 mg/ml,
and with or without 10 Gy irradiation, cell
viability decreased progressively with a sta-
tistically significant difference between the
groups (F ¼ 60.980, P <0.01 at 24 h and
F ¼ 80.159, P <0.01 at 48 h; Figure 2b).
Compared with the control group, cell via-
bility in the IR group was significantly
lower (P <0.01 at both 24 and 48 h). Cell
viability was also significantly lower in the
CpG þ IR group compared with IR alone
(P <0.01 at both 24 and 48 h). There was no
statistically significant difference in cell via-
bility between the control group and Hep-2
cells treated with CpG ODN7909 alone
(P ¼ 0.205 at 24 h and P ¼ 0.061 at 48 h;
Figure 2b).
Clonogenic survival analysis
Hep-2 cell dose-survival curves were fitted
using a single-hit multi-target model
(Figure 3). In Hep-2 cells treated with
CpG ODN7909 plus IR, there were mark-
edly lower values (P <0.05) for mean death
dose (D0
), quasi field dose (Dq
), extrapola-
tion number (N) and a narrower initial
shoulder than in cells treated with IR
alone, and the sensitivity enhancement
ratio (SER)D0
was 1.225. These results

enhancing effects in Hep-2 cells (Figure 3
and Table 1).
Cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase
Proportions of Hep-2 cells in G2/M phase
cell cycle arrest were significantly different
between the four treatment groups
(untreated control, CpG ODN 7909 only,
IR only, or CpG ODN 7909 plus IR;
F ¼ 55.211, P <0.01 at 24 h and
F ¼ 191.341, P <0.01 at 48 h; Figure 4a
and b). Compared with the control group,
a significant increase in the percentage of
Hep-2 cells in the G2/M phase was
observed in the CpG group (P <0.05 at
both 24 and 48 h) and the IR group
(P <0.05 and P <0.01 at both 24 and
48 h). Moreover, at 24 and 48 h following
IR, the percentage of cells in G2/M phase
was significantly higher in the CpG þ IR
group than in the IR alone group
(P <0.01 at both 24 and 48 h; Figure 4a
and b).
Increase of IR-induced cellular apoptosis
Significant differences were observed in
Hep-2 cell apoptosis index between the
four treatment groups (F ¼ 454.198,
P <0.01 at 24 h and F ¼ 301.354, P <0.01
at 48 h; Figure 5a and b). Compared with
the control group, the Hep-2 cell apoptosis
index was significantly increased in the IR
group (P <0.01 at 24 and 48 h) and the
CpG þ IR group (P <0.01 at 24 and
48 h). Moreover, the proportion of apopto-
tic cells was significantly higher in Hep-2
cells treated with CpG ODN 7909 plus IR
versus IR alone (P <0.01 at 24 and 48 h).
The cellular apoptosis index remained sim-
ilar between the control group and cells
treated with CpG ODN 7909 alone

ment groups (F ¼ 13.166, P <0.01 at 24 h
and F ¼ 16.047, P<0.01 at 48 h).

tion between the four treatment groups
(F ¼ 18,843, P <0.01 at 24 h and

degree of synergy with conventional
remedies for malignant tumours.22­25 In
the past, TLR9 was mainly reported to be
expressed in various immune cells, includ-
ing dendritic cells.26 More recently, increas-
ing evidence has shown that TLR9 is
also expressed in tumour tissues, which
display higher levels of TLR9 than normal
tissues.27,28 For example, TLR9 mRNA
expression was found to be higher in non-
small cell lung carcinoma than in normal
lung tissue,29 and TLR9 expression was
higher in laryngeal squamous cell carcino-
ma tumour tissue compared with adjacent
normal tissues at the gene and protein
level.30 Furthermore, this change in TLR9
was positively correlated with clinical
stage.30 The presence of TLR9 has also
been reported at the mRNA and protein
level in Hep-2 cell lines by means of
RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry.31
Similarly, the present study also showed
that TLR9 was expressed in Hep-2 cells,
which might be involved in enhancing the
radiosensitivity shown in the present study,
possibly via mediation of CpG ODN7909
intracellular signal transduction.
The occurrence, infiltration and metasta-
ses of tumours is related to cell prolifera-
tion, and CCK-8 can be used to evaluate
cell proliferation dynamics.32 The present
results showed a decrease in CCK-8 after
Hep-2 cells were exposed to CpG
ODN7909 for 24 and 48 h, indicating that
cellular viability was inhibited, and this
inhibition was shown to be in a dose-

shown to significantly enhance the decrease
in cell viability compared with 10 Gy X-ray
radiation alone. Consistent with the present
results, the authors previously published
study demonstrated that CpG ODN1826
alone could delay the growth of Lewis
lung carcinoma in mice, and the combined
inhibitory effect of CpG ODN1826 and
X-ray on Lewis lung cancer was greater
than X-ray radiation alone.33 The present
study also employed clonogenic survival
analysis to investigate the role of CpG
ODN7909 on radiation sensitivity in Hep-
2 cells, and showed that CpG ODN7909
combined with radiation was able to signif-
icantly inhibit Hep-2 cell colony formation.
Compared with the IR group, D0
of the
combined treatment group was 1.545 Gy
versus 1.892 Gy, the N value was 2.112
versus 4.394, and Dq value was 1.155
versus 2.801, indicating that CpG
ODN7909 could enhance the in vitro sensi-
tivity of Hep-2 cells to X-rays.
Cell cycle distribution is well docu-
mented to relate to radiosensitivity, with
cells being the most sensitive to radiation
during the G2/M phase and the least sensi-
tive at the end of S phase.34 Therefore,
mediating cell cycle progression into G2/
M phase would be an effective approach
to increase the radiosensitivity of tumours.
CpG ODN has been reported to directly act
on the human lung carcinoma cell line 95D
by promoting cancer cells to move into the
G2/M phase, and the signalling pathway
was shown to be mediated by TLR9.35
Consistent with these results, the present
study showed that CpG ODN7909 signifi-
cantly potentiated X-ray induced cell-cycle
arrest, and the number of cells arrested at
G2
/M phase was significantly increased in
cells treated with CpG ODN7909 and
X-ray combined, compared with X-ray alone.
Apoptosis induced by irradiation is vital
in the use of X-rays to eliminate tumour
cells, and it is widely recognized that
irradiation-induced apoptosis may be used
for assessing the sensitivity of tumour cells
to irradiation, with an increased apoptotic
rate indicating higher tumour cell radiosen-
sitivity.36 In the present study, CpG
ODN7909 alone at 10 mg/ml could not
directly induce cellular apoptosis, but the
apoptotic index was significantly increased
when CpG ODN7909 was combined with
radiation. The mechanism may be that
CpG ODN7909 combined with radiation
altered the cell cycle distribution, with
cell arrest at G2/M phase, in which the
cells were more sensitive to radiation
and were more likely to enter the apoptotic
pathway.
Furthermore, the present study showed
that at 24 and 48 h following irradiation,
IL-12 and TNF-a secretion by Hep-2 cells
was significantly increased in cells treated
with CpG ODN7909 and X-rays combined
compared with X-rays alone. IL-12 is
known to play a significant role in inhibit-
ing tumour development and metastasis,37
and TNF-a is a cell factor with strong direct
antitumour activity, that is reported to be
closely involved with radiation sensitivity.38
TNF-a has been shown to inhibit the pro-
liferation of various tumour cells, and to
induce apoptosis.39,40 One study showed
that IL-12 and TNF-a could be up-
regulated in the human glioma cell line
(CHG-5) when these cells were treated
with a combination of CpG ODN and
ß-rays, which apparently inhibited cell clo-
nogenic survival.41 Similarly, the present
results showed that secretion of IL-12 and
TNF-a had an increasing trend following
treatment with CpG ODN7909. The secre-
tion of IL-12 and TNF-a was increased
more significantly following treatment
with CpG ODN7909 and X-rays combined.
The present authors hypothesize that Hep-2
cells can secrete these factors through
autocrine mechanisms, and these factors
may participate in improving the roles
of CpG ODN7909 on radiosensitivity of
tumour cells.
Wang et al. 2019
In conclusion, the present results showed
that CpG ODN7909 combined with X-ray
radiation decreased cellular clonogenic
survival and increased cellular apoptosis,
percentage of cells at G2/M phase and
secretion of specific cytokines, compared
with X-ray radiation alone, suggesting
that CpG ODN7909 could enhance the
radiosensitivity of Hep-2 cells in vitro.
These results may provide a clinical per-
spective for improvement of radiotherapy
treatment effects in patients with LSCC.
However, the precise mechanisms by
which TLR9 may mediate signal transduc-
tion pathways related to radiosensitivity
remain unclear, and require further studies.
