Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental
disorders that are often diagnosed in early childhood.
Although early diagnosis and identification of the develop-
mental disorder is common, the exact causes of ASD are
still generally unknown and multi-faceted (Tchaconas &
Adesman, 2013). The rates of diagnosing ASD are rapidly
growing among individuals across continents, races, ethnic
backgrounds, and socio-economic statuses (Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, 2012). ASD is character-
ized by communication difficulties, repetitive behaviors,
and impairments in social interaction (American Psychiatric
Association, 2000; National Institute of Neurological
Disorders and Stroke, 2012). Although these three impair-
ments occur in children diagnosed with ASD, they exist in
varying degrees, and not every child on the spectrum has the
same challenges. Despite these variations, difficulty or
delayed language is often a core component of ASD and can
have a significant effect on various aspects of a child's life.
Communication has a multi-modal presence and affects
an individual's ability to function in their environment. It is
estimated that 25% of children with ASD could be classified
as nonverbal or unable to express their daily needs (Scott,
Clark, & Brady, 2000). The National Research Council
(2001) identified developing spontaneous communication as
an important skill for children with ASD, highlighting the
significance of communication skills for children on the
spectrum. Children with ASD are often mainstreamed in
classrooms (No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, 2002) where
they may not be provided with the individual attention neces-
sary to help them be successful in school. Communication
impairment is a key factor in the child's ability to learn. The
classroom has been a common setting where communication
interventions for children with ASD are often applied, and in
the past 50 years, different types of interventions have been
implemented in an effort to meet the varying and complex
communication needs of children with ASD.

User-Centered Design and Augmentative
and Alternative Communication Apps
for Children With Autism Spectrum
Disorders

Abstract
Communication difficulties are among the most frequent characteristics of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).
Lack of communication can have a significant impact on the child's life. Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC)
apps are a common form of AAC interventions that involve a combination of affordable technology with software that
can be utilized to assist with communication. While AAC apps have been found to have some impact on improving the
communication skills of children with ASD, current research exploring this topic is still limited. Focusing on the design
process of AAC apps may provide better insight into improving clinical outcomes and user success. The user-centered design
process incorporates a continuous cycle of user feedback to help inform and improve the functions and the capabilities of the
technology, and it is an essential component in AAC app development. This article outlines how the user-centered design
process could be adopted for the development of AAC apps for children with ASD.

Communication Needs of Persons With Severe Disabilities,
1992). AAC interventions can range from no tech to high
tech and can vary greatly based on their intended purpose.
The first attempts in augmenting the communication ability
of individuals with ASD began in a non-technological man-
ner, with pictures and symbols. Since the 1970s, parents and
special education teachers encouraged the use of sign lan-
guage and symbols to communicate (Mirenda & Erickson,
2000). In the 1980s, the use of photographs and line draw-
ings became the symbols of choice (Ogletree & Harn, 2001),
and the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS)
was developed as a multi-phase AAC intervention to help
individuals with ASD communicate (Bondy & Frost, 2001).
Picture-based communication approaches (such as PECS),
were preferred because pictures are not transient and stay in
the visual field for a longer processing time. Research stud-
ies have demonstrated the value of PECS, showing that utili-
zation of the system improved functional aspects of
communication and communication initiations in children
with ASD (Carr & Felce, 2007; Flippin, Reszka, & Watson,
2010; Ganz, Davis, Lund, Goodwyn, & Simpson, 2012;
Ostryn, Wolfe, & Rusch, 2008).
Despite the benefits of PECS, there were barriers that
could be improved upon. For instance, the number of pic-
tures needed as a child's language base grew, and the time
consumed to create and store these laminated images began
to place logistical limits on the value of PECS. In utilizing
this system, it could be difficult to maintain the increasing
number of images, and instructors had no way to track these
images and monitor the progress of a child. Out of this need
and the improving technological capabilities, AAC tech-
nologies have emerged as tools to help address the com-
munication challenges that many individuals with autism
experience (Lubas, Mitchell, & De Leo, 2014; Shane et al.,
2012). The first use of AAC technologies came in the form
of AAC devices, instruments with pre-loaded software
existing strictly for communication purposes. By the early
1990s, AAC devices were introduced into classrooms
(Hourcade, Pilotte, West, & Parette, 2004; Ogletree &
Harn, 2001), and their presence could be seen as an attempt
to use technology to improve on current communication
interventions. AAC devices were intended to replace
printed pictures, but despite this intention, they were
extremely expensive, difficult to program or personalize,
not flexible enough to accommodate needs, and stigmatiz-
ing (Shane et al., 2012). Despite their technological
improvement, there were still several barriers that pre-
vented individuals from using these systems on a regular
basis. These challenges could impede both parents and
school systems from adopting this technology. While it
seemed that parents and special education teachers believed
that AAC devices were the solution for children with mini-
mal communication skills, they would need to find funding
and learn the skills to use them (De Leo, Gonzales, Battagiri,
& Leroy, 2011).
In an effort to harness the value of an AAC device, but to
produce a more convenient and affordable tool, AAC apps
were created. AAC apps involve the combination of afford-
able technology with software that can be utilized to assist
with communication (Lubas et al., 2014). Smartphones and
tablets are types of technology that have multiple functions
(such as the ability to be used as a phone or computer) but
can be utilized to assist with communication. As technology
continues to grow and becomes more affordable, so does the
use and function of AAC apps. In February 2014, the Apple
Store had listed more than 250 apps under the keyword
"AAC" ranging from free to a maximum of a few hundred
dollars. In Apple's fiscal 2013, they reportedly sold 150 mil-
lion iPhones, and 71 million iPads, both of which demon-
strate increases since 2012 (Apple Store, 2014). As
technology continues to become more affordable and avail-
able, its presence is greatly increasing in society today. It is
not uncommon for individuals or families to have several
mobile devices, and the function of these devices continue to
serve multiple purposes, increasing the opportunity for the
use of AAC apps.
Impact of AAC Interventions
Despite the increasing presence of AAC apps, even with the
availability of a technological solution that is easy to use,
affordable, and flexible, a large number of individuals with
communication needs are still not learning how to communi-
cate (Mirenda, 2001). With the continued growth of AAC
apps, there is a need to examine the impact of these interven-
tions. Currently, some research supports the value of AAC
technologies, as Lal (2010) found that children who are min-
imally verbal will increase language skills when using AAC
technologies. Studies have also verified the long-term out-
comes of AAC use, demonstrating improvements in the
users' functional communication (Hunt-Berg, 2005; Lund &
Light, 2006). A recent meta-analysis by Ganz, Earles-
Vollrath, et al. (2012) found that research evidence supports
the overall impact of AAC technologies on targeted behav-
ioral outcomes, primarily communication skills. It seems
possible that such technology is providing movement in the
right direction; however, these interventions have not had the
impact on children with ASD that they were anticipated to
have (Mirenda, 2001). Although research has shown support
for the use of AAC technologies for children with ASD
(Ganz, Earles-Vollrath et al., 2012; Hunt-Berg, 2005; Lal,
2010; Lund & Light, 2006), it is also important to address
that current AAC research for individuals with autism is
lacking and may not be sufficient enough to inform the
impact of AAC use on communicative capabilities (Mirenda,
2001). The research in the field that has been conducted is
often comprised of single subject designs, and also lacks
thorough descriptions of the participant demographics and
environmental context of AAC use (Ganz, Earles-Vollrath,
et al., 2012; Nunes, 2008; Pennington, Marshall, & Goldbart,
Lubas et al. 3
2007). In addition to this, current studies are often done in
controlled and "ideal settings," which could impede transla-
tion of findings to real-world settings (Lund & Light, 2007).
Despite the increase in available apps for AAC, there is a
significant lack of attention given to the process of app
development. In particular, it is essential that developers use
technology to create new interventions that improve on past
work, and not just re-create past interventions in the form of
an app (Light & McNaughton, 2012). A potential response to
these obstacles are to develop AAC apps through a user-cen-
tered design approach, with the intended users providing
feedback throughout the software development process. If
the proposed users (such as nonverbal children with ASD)
would be unable to participate in the design process, this
approach can also use proxies, individuals authorized to rep-
resent or speak on behalf of another person. Often when soft-
ware (such as an app) is being developed, the intended users
do not have a role in the design process, and this can signifi-
cantly impair the value of software. Implementing user feed-
back throughout the software design process can have an
impact on the user's comfort level with the technology, atti-
tude toward the technology, and ultimately influence their
competency and success. A user-centered design approach
can be an important mechanism for increasing the positive
outcomes of AAC app use. In the following sections, we
present an overview of the different steps in a user-centered
design process, and provide a step-by-step example of an
AAC app that was created through this design approach.
Method of User-Centered Design
User needs are a fundamental aspect of any product. The
user-centered design approach involves the creation of a
product that incorporates user-centered activities throughout
the entire development process. This process involves iden-
tifying the intended users, their capabilities, needs, and
expectations. A user-centered design addresses the envi-
sioned goals that are to be met by the user through the soft-
ware interaction, the tasks needed to achieve the goals, and
also the environments (both physical and social) that the user
interacts with in order to achieve such (Hall, 2001). For this
insight to be achieved, users must participate in the develop-
ment process both through designing and testing the new
technology.
One of the central components in the user-centered design
is the use of prototype creation. Prototyping is a quick way to
incorporate user feedback into the design process. Prototypes
can vary on their fidelity level (how close they are to the
actual product). Conceptual prototypes can start off low in
fidelity, but allow users to provide feedback on the cognitive
and visual aspects of a design. The initial prototype for the
user-centered design often first involves a paper version.
This approach is recommended due to its simplicity and fast
turn around. A paper prototype allows individuals to contrib-
ute regardless of their technological capabilities, where an
operational design could be limiting if not everyone had a
basic understanding of the technological system being used.
Another benefit is that changes can be made quickly on
paper, and that starting with a paper prototype allows indi-
viduals the freedom to be more critical (Andrews et al., 2012;
Klee, 2000). Conceptual prototypes can increase fidelity
through the creation of "mock-ups" that present a more
dynamic visual representation of the final product, but one
that is still not operational. Operational prototypes, high in
fidelity, can then be created to allow users to test the func-
tionality of the product. The user-centered design process
does not specifically dictate how many and what types of
prototypes must be created, but requires that user involve-
ment occurs at every level of product development.
A user-centered design can be an extremely valuable
approach to AAC app development, as it allows the user to
provide feedback and input throughout the development pro-
cess. The method of a user-centered design is characterized
by a multi-stage process that allows input and feedback, as
the developers create the product (Andrews, et al., 2012; De
Leo et al., 2011; De Leo & Leroy, 2008). This approach has
been used with success in different types of technological
products such as website development (Andrews et al.,
2012), the creation of virtual environments (Fidopaistis,
Rizzo, & Rolland, 2010), and in interactive health technolo-
gies (Dabbs et al., 2009).
AAC Apps and the User-Centered Design
When specifically addressing AAC app development, there
are additional considerations of the design process. After the
developers determine the intended users of the app (if the app
will be age specific, diagnosis specific, or can be used across
different demographics), a group of users can work with
developers to inform the design. An initial determination will
need to be made in the method of communication, as an AAC
app can vary in this aspect. Text-based input methods allow
for the creation of messages through typing or combining
words. This method results in a strong and clear content of
messages, but can be a slow process for communication.
Graphic-based methods allow for the creation of messages
through combining symbols and images, and can often then
be translated into speech. This type of communication affords
individuals who lack language literacy the ability to commu-
nicate; however, the content and clarity of messages are often
limiting (Gonzales, Leroy, & De Leo, 2009). There are pros
and cons of both input methods, and a combination of the two
can also be used. Determining the modality of communica-
tion is an important step in AAC app development, and such
decision should be based on the capabilities of the intended
user. From there, interviews should take place with users or
relevant professionals who can inform the initial design idea.
Then, a multi-stage prototype and user testing process occurs
to receive continual user feedback on features and capabilities
of the software. The steps involved in this process are as
4 SAGE Open
follows: (a) determine the intended user of the software; (b)
interviewing users (or proxies) to inform the initial design; (c)
creation of the prototype; (d) a multi-stage process of user (or
proxy) prototype testing; and (e) creation of a final product.
The user-centered design process integrates feedback from
the user (or proxies) at every stage in the development of the
software; this process is displayed in Figure 1.
The user-centered design process is linear; however, the
concept is multi-dimensional. Depending on the product and
user population, the process should be adapted to the context
of the purpose and type of software being developed. In the
following section, we will provide a step-by-step example of
the user-centered (by proxy) design process used to develop
an AAC app for children with communication impairments
as a result of ASD. Specific considerations of the user-cen-
tered design as it relates to an AAC app for children ASD
will also be addressed.
An AAC App Designed Through the User
Centered by Proxy Design
To further demonstrate the user-centered by proxy design,
this process will be illustrated by addressing the develop-
ment of an AAC app, called I Click I Talk.1 The five-step
process in the user-centered design approach is explained in
detail in the following sections.
Step 1: Identify intended user. The first step in the user-cen-
tered design process is to identify the user of the software.
The intended users of this specific AAC app are children
with communication impairments due to ASD. In this case,
because the intended users have severe communication
impairments, this design approach requires a proxy, as the
children with severe ASD are unable to verbally communi-
cate their feedback. In the case of this software development,
special education teachers, parents, and therapists were used
as proxies to the target population. A child with severe ASD
would utilize an AAC app with assistance from an adult (typ-
ically a teacher, parent, or therapist); therefore, it was rea-
sonable to consider that these adults would be a valuable
source of information during the design process. In addition
to identifying features that would benefit the children, prox-
ies could also inform aspects that affected their own user
interface with the app.
Step 2: Interviews to inform the initial design. The initial design
of an AAC app should be created after obtaining feedback
from parents, therapists, and teachers regarding their needs
and desired functions of a communication app for children
with ASD. Throughout this process, individuals can identify
many unique needs and desired capabilities of the software.
Based on the initial interviews of I Click I Talk, it was clear
that an app with several customizable features would be ben-
eficial, as every child with ASD and their learning environ-
ment is unique. An example of the importance of
customization is first reflected in the communication method
of the app. It was initially determined that a graphic-based
communication method would be used in the app, as children
with severe communication impairments would not initially
be able to communicate through text only. However, soft-
ware should be adaptable to multiple purposes and custom-
ized features should be considered to adapt for different user
needs. Therefore, after the feedback, a combination of
graphic- and text-based input methods were utilized to pro-
vide an optimal learning environment for language develop-
ment for each individual user. With the users, goals, and
basic communication method identified, the next step in the
development process was to create prototypes to continue to
inform and improve on the design.
Steps 3 and 4: Prototype creation and user (by proxy) test-
ing.Steps 3 and 4 were combined in discussion, because
they involve an integrative loop of prototype development
and user testing. From the information obtained in the initial
interviews a prototype was created, and then special educa-
tion teachers from public and private schools throughout
North America reviewed this prototype to provide feedback
that led to the continuous refinement of the software through
semi-structured interviews. The software was developed
over an iterative process of several interactive prototyping
stages, with users or proxies visually reviewing and then
eventually testing the software throughout the development.
The first prototype (Figure 2) created was a simple paper
drawing of the communication screen that the child and adult
would most often interface with when using the app. The
paper prototype showed the general layout of the app, with
the lists of word and image categories present on the left-
hand side, a central display of images for a child to choose
from (based on the category selected), and a sentence strip
Figure 1. Steps in the user-centered design process.
Lubas et al. 5
where these images could be moved after they were selected
for communication.
After each prototype continued to progress, user feedback
was utilized to inform the next version. The paper prototype
was adjusted several times to reflect proxy feedback, and
then a mock-up was created. The mock-up (seen in Figure 3)
consisted of a series of photographic images of screens and
interfaces. This was a non-functional series of photographic
images of the layout for the app. The mock-up was another
conceptual prototype; however, it offered increased fidelity
of the intended layout.
After the proxies provided feedback on the mock-up, an
operational prototype was created, where proxies began to
demo the app. The operational prototype was refined several
times based on feedback, again through semi-structured
interviews. Overall, the feedback provided by the teachers
during the design process was twofold. First, they offered
design assistance from their perspective, addressing the need
for an AAC app to optimize the use of their time, by allowing
for multiple children to utilize the same app, yet still allow
for individual customization. Second, teachers served as
proxy users for the children with autism, addressing the
strengths and limitations of the children they work with.
Table 1 serves as summary of key features of I Click I Talk
that developed out of the user centered by proxy design.
Step 5: Final product. The result of this user-centered design
approach was a highly customizable app, allowing individual
users to select features based on their unique needs and pur-
poses. After a final product is created, developers can some-
times overlook a very important aspect of the process, which
is addressing the dissemination and evaluation of the prod-
uct. In the first step of disseminating the product, the app was
made available to purchase online through avenues such as
the Apple and Android stores. In addition to the mechanism
to purchase the app, in this instance an auxiliary website was
created to serve as a user support to the software. The goal of
the auxiliary website was to provide information on the fea-
tures of the app. The website also provides information on
using the software, video tutorials, and offers a contact
source for those who would be interested in additional train-
ing. A local dissemination approach was also enacted, as the
developers reached out to local school districts and agencies
that provided services for children with ASD. Local trainings
were offered to assist teachers and other professionals in
learning the features of I Click I Talk.
Although evaluation is not a distinct step in the process of
the user-centered design, it can also be useful to address. It is
important that efforts be made to verify the benefit of this
approach. An attempt (although unsuccessful) to evaluate
this app was made. A web-based survey was developed to
assess user feedback for I Click I Talk. The survey was made
available through the app website and its Facebook page for
approximately 4 months from January to April 2013.
Participation in the survey was voluntary, and served as an
opportunity for the purchaser of the app to provide direct
feedback regarding the design and capabilities of the soft-
ware. The results of the survey could not be considered con-
clusive due to the small sample size. Despite the survey
being made available for 4 months, it was only completed by
10 participants (over 3,000 copies of the app have been sold,
therefore the completed surveys reflect less than 1% of
users).
Discussion
Although more evaluative studies on the clinical outcomes
of AAC apps are needed, research has pointed toward the
importance of the user and technology interface in regard to
this relationship. In the research that has shown communica-
tive improvements, Lund and Light (2007) suggest that
although studies have evaluated the clinical efficiency of
AAC technologies, many studies validate AAC use under the
ideal and controlled circumstances. Studies have revealed
general improvements in communication through the use of
AAC technologies, but research has also found that improve-
ments are not equal across all individuals, and suggests that
some benefit from AAC use more than others (Lund & Light,
2006). In an effort to further examine the impact of AAC
technologies, Lund and Light looked at factors that influ-
enced positive outcomes on AAC use. Through their research
they identified three general themes that improved outcomes
of AAC use: social support, personal characteristics (of the
user), and services. Social support has had a positive influ-
encing role in AAC outcomes through the role of parents and
educators who can encourage the use of the technology.
Personal characteristics were also found to be associated
with outcomes, primarily in the sense that the users' attitudes
and positive expectations influenced the success of the indi-
vidual user. Finally, the influencing role of services refers to
additional training methods of the technology that are avail-
able for families and facilitators to improve their interface

6 SAGE Open
with the software. These three distinct themes found by Lund
and Light (2007) point to one commonality, the importance
of user and software interaction.
In light of the current limitations in AAC research, the
design process may be an important avenue that can help
lead to the creation of valuable AAC apps. Light and
McNaughton (2013) suggest that current AAC delivery
comes from a skewed focus of over-emphasizing the service
delivery system and not users. This is an important point to
address, as the user-centered design process allows the users
(or proxies) to inform capabilities of AAC apps that they
desire, and also attempts to increase the user's competency
in interacting with the technology. The mere presence of
technology is not a simple solution in directly improving
AAC outcomes (Light & McNaughton, 2013), yet if
approached correctly it can be a useful avenue to further
engage and highlight the needs of the user. Feature matching
is a significant component of AAC use (Beukelman &
Mirenda, 2013), and utilizing the process of a user-centered
design approach in developing an AAC app for children with
ASD can bring to light important considerations in matching
the design process to specific user populations. This process
can also address the need for making new AAC apps flexible
enough to be customized for every child's unique learning
needs. Gosnell, Costello, and Shane (2011) highlight the
importance of using a clinical framework when selecting the
Table 1. Features of I Click I Talk That Resulted From the User-Centered Design Process.
Feature Description
Multi-student user Teachers or professionals can choose a multi-student user, and manage several students from one app. Even if
managing several students from one app, each student to be customized based on individual needs.
Navigation set-up The app users can choose to customize features of basic navigation design. Users can choose the order and
placement of word categories, whether or not they utilize the sentence strip, and adjust the overall layout.
Customization of
symbols and images
The app features a system of highly customizable system of images. Images within I Click I Talk can be
customized based on the needs, interest, and preferences of the child. Images can include text or no text, they
can be clipart or real pictures, and this option is up to the changing need of the child. Images from the internet
or personal photographs can be uploaded; users also have access to a web library of images. Images can be re-
sized (for those with visual impairments) and cropped.
Ability to create
activities
User's can create their own activities or games to be used within the app. This feature allows teachers to
develop educational lessons within the app to further facilitate teaching language skills.
User-focused website An auxiliary website outlining features and uses of the app. The website also offers video training tutorials for
several features such as image manipulation, creating activities, interacting with the main interface, and the
image use analysis to just name a few.
Audio Ability to use recorded voice only (this serves an important purpose as feedback from speech and language
pathologists addressed that computer-generated audio can sometimes compromise the meaning of the
language). This feature also allows the app to be used in foreign languages (Figure 4).

appropriate communication apps, given the large number of
available apps. This concept further lends itself to the impor-
tance that the creation of new AAC apps serve as meaningful
additions based on user needs, which again can be addressed
by a user-centered design process. In addition to the primary
user's needs, AAC apps for children with autism can also be
used by teachers, parents, and applied behavior analysis
(ABA) therapists, so it is important to include their feedback
at all levels, as they assist the child with utilizing the soft-
ware. Figure 5 adapts the user-centered design approach spe-
cifically to the context of designing communication software
for children with ASD.
When creating AAC apps for children with autism, con-
sideration should include a multi-disciplinary approach to
user-centered design. Different types of specialists (thera-
pists and teachers) and parents should be used to inform the
design process. It is also important for communication-based
software to have the ability to be used in a variety of settings
in the child's life, as a child with severe communication
impairments would need to utilize AAC apps in home,
school, and recreational settings. As the setting may vary, the
AAC app will likely be utilized by more than one type of
assisting adult, which is why it is important that feedback be
provided from various types of professionals and parents. In
addition to the use of AAC apps by both professionals and
parents of children with ASD, it also important to acknowl-
edge that these technologies are utilized all over the world.
Therefore, the user-centered design process should provide
the opportunity for AAC apps to be used by individuals who
speak different languages, and to even allow for customiza-
tion of regional language needs. After users or proxies have
informed the software design process, the goal of the final
product should be to serve a current unmet need in AAC
apps. Once finalized, developers must then consider how to
disseminate and market their product, and what type of aux-
iliary tool will be provided to assist in the use of their AAC
app. Although this article and several others promote the
user-centered design approach as a valuable method of prod-
uct development (Andrews et al., 2012; Park, 2012; Waller,
Balandi, O'Mara, & Judson, 2005); more research must be
done to determine this and evaluation of such software
should be conducted.
With an attempt at evaluation, it was found that it was
difficult to collect feedback from app users after they have
purchased the app; therefore, future app development might
consider the use of data collection built within the app, or
other features to track app usage. The low response rate
(n = 10) of this survey could have occurred out of many
reasons. First the sampling approach used. App users would
only have been aware of this survey if they utilized the
Facebook page or website, as a link to the survey was only
available on these pages and not directly available on the
app (if users purchased the app more than 2 years ago, they
may not be still actively utilizing the website). Another sig-
nificant barrier in obtaining results from this survey could
be the lack of interest. It is common for professionals (such
as speech­language pathologists, or special education
teachers) to change the AAC apps they are using frequently.
When a consumer buys an app, they are limited to the cre-
ated capabilities of it, meaning that after the app is on the
market developers often do not take feedback and make
changes or improvements. Because of this, when a profes-
sional buys an app if it does not fully meet their needs, they
may quickly move on to another. This potentially speaks to
the importance of developers to take user feedback into
consideration during the design process, as after a final
product is created it will be too late. Although the survey
was not successful in obtaining feedback after the develop-
ment of I Click I Talk, future research on AAC apps should
attempt to assess the impact of the user-centered design on

Conclusion
With the increasing presence of affordable AAC apps, it is
important that new apps are created with a purpose, rather
than continuing to flood the market. When creating AAC
apps for children with ASD, a user-centered by proxy
design can help shed light on the needs for an app that does
not currently exist, or highlight features that are currently
effective. As technology becomes increasingly accessible,
there are opportunities for non-software developers to cre-
ate their own apps, and there are several apps on the market
that have been created by teachers and parents of children
with ASD (Light & McNaughton, 2012). This can be a sig-
nificant benefit in the market; however, just as professional
software developers; parents and other non-professionals
could benefit from the user-centered design approach. It is
a significant strength that there are several AAC apps avail-
able to choose from, and many different groups of individu-
als who have created such. However, a challenge with this
is that it can be difficult for parents and professionals to
choose the appropriate app (if any) to meet their child's
need (Bradshaw, 2013). It is not necessary that more apps
need to be available for unique AAC users, it is that current
apps must be better designed to maximize communication
improvements for a wide range of users with diverse needs
(Light & McNaughton, 2012). Utilizing a user-centered
design approach can allow parents and professionals to pro-
vide their insight and feedback into the new AAC apps
being developed to address any current unmet needs on the
market. Until more research is conducted on the outcomes
of AAC apps for children with ASD, the user-centered
design process may be a good approach in improving AAC
apps and attempting to bridge the gap of user interface with
the software. Successful AAC use not only involves the
availability of technology, but must also address feature
matching, and appropriate instructional approaches.
Therefore, the use of a design process that takes into
account both user and instructor needs can be a very valu-
able process when informing future software.
