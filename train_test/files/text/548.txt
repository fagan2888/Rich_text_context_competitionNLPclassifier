RECENT three decades have witnessed China's magnifi-
cent economic development in the reform era.Although
rapid industrialization and urbanization improved many of
the country's citizens' standards of living (1), the ensuing
unwelcomed environmental effects have led to a legitimate
public health and environmental justice concern (2).Among
a variety of environmental risks in China, outdoor air pollu-
tion is one of the most worrying and is among the worst in
the world with 7 of the 10 most air-polluted cities found in
China (3,4). Despite frequent media coverage and increas-
ing scholarly writings on China's air pollution threats,
comprehensive analysis of the air pollution and health link
is not adequate. A handful of studies (5­7) relied on eco-
logical time-series data to evaluate the effects of air pollu-
tion on aggregate health in China. There is a need for
greater clarity on health effects at the individual level.
Moreover, in order to detect chronic effects of air pollution
on health, it is essential to conduct prospective studies using
longitudinal surveys to characterize how exposure to air
pollution is subsequently linked to health and mortality.
This type of research has emerged in the West (8­11),
although still inadequate in general and much lacking in
China (12).
Although adverse health effects of air pollutants appear
to affect all age groups (13­16), there has been a recent call
for a focus on air pollution research in the elderly popula-
tion as they are the principal group at risk for morbidity and
mortality and are particularly vulnerable to air pollutants
(17). With the aging trends sweeping across developing and
developed societies including China, healthy longevity is
becoming a growingly important goal for older adults, their
families, and the society as a whole. Hence, modifiable
environmental factors of health, mortality or life expectancy
(LE), and health expectancy (HE; the average lifetime that a
person can expect to live without a health condition) should
be rigorously investigated in different settings with results
disseminated to the public, environmental activists, and
policy makers.

Background. Outdoor air pollution is one of the most worrying environmental threats China faces today. Comprehen-
sive and quantitative analyses of the health consequences of air pollution in China are lacking. This study reports age- and
sex-specific life expectancy and health expectancies (HEs) corresponding to different levels of air pollution based on
associations between air pollution and individual risks for a host of health conditions and mortality net of individual- and
community-level confounders.
Methods. This is a multilevel prospective cohort study based a nationally representative sample of Chinese elders. The
main outcome measures in this study include life expectancy estimated from mortality and HEs based on five health
conditions including activity of daily living, instrumental activity of daily living, cognitive status, self-rated health, and
chronic conditions.
Results. Net of the controls, exposure to outdoor air pollution corresponded to subsequent reductions of life
expectancy and HEs for all five health conditions. These detrimental pollution effects were stronger for women. The gap
in life expectancy between areas with good air quality and moderately heavily polluted areas was 3.78 years for women
of age 65 and 0.93 years for men. The differences in HEs at age 65 were also large, ranging from 1.47 years for HE for
good self-rated health in men to 5.20 years for activity of daily living disability-free HE in women.
Conclusions. Air pollution has devastating health impacts on Chinese elders reducing longevity and shortening HEs.
Women are more vulnerable than men. More strict air policy should be implemented to pursue sustainable development
in China.

Using data from a nationally representative longitudinal
survey recently conducted in China, this study reports gender-
specific LE and HEs at different ages corresponding to dif-
ferent levels of air pollution based on the associations
between community-level air pollution and individual risks
for a host of health conditions and mortality. Many previous
studies of environmental epidemiology have focused on
acute pulmonary or respiratory diseases (18­23). To the
best of our knowledge, this study is one of the first few
nationally representative studies using prospective multilevel
design to quantify the mid- or long-term effects of outdoor
air pollution on age- and sex-specific LE and HEs in China.
Methods
Study Population
Data used in this study are from the third and fourth
waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Health Longevity Survey
(CLHLS) in 2002 and 2005. The CLHLS, which initiated in
1998, only included seniors aged 80 years or above for the
first two waves, covered 22 provinces in China where more
than 85% of the national population resided. Starting from
2002, the third wave of the CLHLS added younger elders
aged 65­79 years in addition to those followed-up respon-
dents. The CLHLS aimed to interview all centenarians in
the sampled counties or cities with informed consents. Lists of
centenarians were obtained from the local aging institutes.
For each centenarian interviewed, one octogenarian, one
nonagenarian, one septuagenarian, and one person aged
65­69 years were randomly chosen to be interviewed based
on a random code assigned to the sampled centenarian. If
the random code assigned to a centenarian was an odd
number, one female elder from each of four age groups was
interviewed. Otherwise, four male elders were interviewed.
The ages of the targeted persons aged 65­99 years were pre-
designated to match the last digit of the random code of the
sampled centenarian. If there were no such appropriate tar-
geted persons available in the village or street of the sam-
pled centenarian, the CLHLS team recruited respondents
from nearby villages, towns, streets, or city districts. The
CLHLS is representative of the elderly population in Main-
land China because the respondents are randomly sampled,
and the distributions of key variables are comparable to
those reported in other national surveys, such as the National
Health Service Survey and the Sampling Survey of the
Aged Population in Urban­Rural China (24). The CLHLS
data include a weight variable reflecting the sampling
design and ensuring the weighted sample distributions to
match those in the population in the 22 sampled provinces
in terms of age, sex, and urban­rural residence. Therefore,
weight is always applied when we estimate the distributable
frequencies or means for the whole sample. Excluding
those centenarians aged 106 years or older whose self-
reported age is less reliable (25), the 2002 wave interviewed
15,797 respondents aged 65­105 years, including 9,004
women and 6, 793 men. Excluding those who died or were
lost to follow-up during the 2002­2005 period, 7,858
women and 5,944 men survived to the 2005 wave. All infor-
mation was obtained through in-home interviews. System-
atic assessments of the CLHLS indicate that the data quality
is high (24,26,27).
Measurements
Air pollution was measured by the Air Pollution Index
(API) at the prefecture or city level, shared by individuals
and communities within the same prefecture or city. API is
widely used in environmental research as a measure of the
general air pollution (28­30). The China National Environ-
mental Monitoring Center calculates API to assess the con-
centration of five pollutants: sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen
dioxide (NO2), particulate matter less than 10 microns in
diameter (PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3)
(31). These five pollutants are among the most common air
pollutants found in China as well as in other developing
countries (32­34). Air quality of a community is then cate-
gorized into seven ordinal air pollution levels (APL) with
lower scores indicating better air quality: excellent (API 0­50),
good (API 50­100), slightly polluted (API 100­150),
lightly polluted (API 150­200), moderately polluted (API
200­250), moderately heavily polluted (API 250­300), and
heavily polluted (API  300). We obtained these APL data
in 1995 from the Chinese Natural Resources Database (35).
The detailed procedures of calculating theAPI and converting
them to the APL are listed in the Appendix. We focus on
1995 to capture air pollution exposure because it was the
only year during the 1990s that the APL data were publi-
cally accessible and also because health consequences of air
pollution exposure likely take time to manifest. Research
has shown that air pollution could yield significant mid- or
long-term effects on health or mortality (11); but the time
lag or latency period has not been well taken into account in
the current literature of air pollution epidemiology, which is
more focused on acute or short-term health impacts of air
pollution.
Based on the CLHLS sample of survivors in 2005, age- to
sex-specific death rates by the level of air pollution were
estimated from sex-stratified proportional Cox hazard
models. The CLHLS collected the interview date of the
follow-up wave in 2005 for those survivors and the date at
death for those who died during the follow-up. With these
death rates, we used conventional method to construct life
tables (36) and obtain the age- and sex-specific LEs. As
shown in Figure 1, the overall age- and sex-specific death
rates and LEs in the CLHLS data sets from 2002 to 2005 are
considerably similar to those in the 2000 census. The drop-off
of congruence with Census 2000 after aged 94 years in both
genders was likely due to age exaggeration in the 2000 Census
in this age group (27).
AIR POLLUTION AND HEALTHY AGING IN CHINA 1221
AIR POLLUTION AND HEALTHY AGING IN CHINA 3
Health conditions were measured by five self-reported
variables capturing several key dimensions of health in later
life: Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Instrumental Activi-
ties of Daily Living (IADL), cognitive impairment, self-
rated health (SRH), and chronic disease conditions. ADL
refers to the following basic personal-care activities: (a)
bathing, (b) dressing, (c) eating, (d) indoor transferring, (e)
toileting, and (f) continence. Because the ADL distribution
was highly skewed in this sample, with 66% reporting no
difficulty performing any of these activities, we dichoto-
mized it into "disabled" (having at least one ADL limita-
tion) and "no limitation," with the latter as the reference
category.
IADL refers to the following activities: (a) visiting neigh-
bors, (b) shopping, (c) cooking, (d) washing clothes, (e)
walking one kilometer, (f) lifting 5 kg, (g) crouching and
standing up three times, and (h) taking public transportation.
Choices for each item were: "able to do without help," "need
some help," and "need full help." In a similar vein, we
dichotomized IADL into disabled (having at least one IADL
limitation) and nondisabled.
Cognitive impairment was measured by the Mini-Mental
Status Examination (37), covering the following aspects of
cognitive functioning: orientation, registration, duplication
and design, calculation, recall, naming, and language, with
a total score ranging from 0 to 30. It was adapted to the
cultural and socioeconomic circumstances in China (38).
Following previous work (37,39), we classified the respon-
dents into cognitive impaired (score <18) and cognitive
unimpaired (score 18). Different from the traditional one
used in the Western nations (37), this cut-off point arguably
better captures the cognitive function of the Chinese elderly
population considering more than 85% of Chinese old
adults aged 65 years or older did not receive more than
6 years of education (39).
Self-rated health has been shown to be an effective mea-
sure of individual health status and has a strong predictive
power of comorbidity and mortality (40). It is assessed by a
general question: "In general, would you say your health is:
(1) very good, (2) good, (3) so so, (4) bad, or (5) very bad?"
To account for distributional skew, we combined the self-
rated health responses into the following two categories:
"poor" (combining [3] to [5]) and "good" (combining [1]
and [2]), with the latter as the reference category.
The CLHLS collected information on more than 20 chronic
conditions (eg, cardiovascular diseases, pneumonia, and
arthritis). For this analysis, chronic disease was operational-
ized as having at least one disease (coded 1) compared with
no disease (coded 0). The validity of this measure has been
confirmed elsewhere (27).
Sullivan's method was employed to estimate the five
HEs, namely LEs free of a specific health condition (eg,
functional disability or cognitive impairment), which have
drawn increasing attention in aging studies (41). The formula
(42) for calculating HEs is as below:
HE
h
x x x
x
x x
x L x L h
l l
 
= =

where HEx
represents HE at age x; lx
indicates the number of
living persons in the life table at age x; Lx
is person-years
lived at age x; hx
is the prevalence of a healthy state (eg,
ADL active) at age x; and Lh
x
is person-years lived in a
healthy state at age x. Using the Sullivan method, expected
LE in IADL or ADL disability-free, cognitive impairment-
free, good or very good self-rated health, and disease-free
states were calculated by applying the corresponding cross-
sectional age- to sex-specific prevalence rates in 2002 to
the person-years lived in different age categories derived
from period life tables from 2002 to 2005.
Statistical Analysis
Two sex-specific models were fit for all the dependent
variables including mortality and the five health outcomes.
Model I controlled for age and APL only and Model II added

a number of socioeconomic controls, marital status, health
practice variables, and per capita gross domestic product at the
contextual level (ie, county or city district). In the survival
analysis of the longitudinal data of the CLHLS from 2002 to
2005, where death was the outcome variable, age was catego-
rized into seven 5-year groups to account for the nonlinearity of
the age effect on mortality. For the five health outcomes,
multilevel logistic regression analyses of the cross-sectional
data of the CLHLS in 2002 were performed to estimate the
prevalence rates and effects of the predictors. Given that the
sampling weight variable in the CLHLS data set is calculated
based on the age- to sex-urban/rural residence-specific distri-
bution of the population and does not capture other important
compositional variables (eg, marital status, living arrange-
ment), we did not apply sample weights in the regression anal-
yses. Research has indicated that inclusion of variables
related to sample selection in the regression produces unbi-
ased coefficients without weights; additionally, weighted
regression results are likely to enlarge the standard errors
(43,44). All analyses were conducted using STATA 10.1.
Results
Sample statistics are shown in Table 1. The overall death
rate in the 3-year follow-up is 14%. The averageAPL across
all the prefectures and cities is 3.3, indicating slight pollu-
tion (see Appendix). Table 2 presents results of survival
analysis. Air pollution is a significant risk factor of mortal-
ity for women with one higher level of air pollution corre-
sponding to a 13% increase in mortality risk, independent of
individual-level sociodemographic factors or community-
level per capital gross domestic product (see model II).
Air pollution did not appear relevant for men's mortality
risk. Table 3 shows coefficients of multilevel logistic mod-

els of health conditions. For both men and women, air
pollution strongly increases odds of having health prob-
lems. For example, in women, one level higher in air pollu-
tion is associated with an 11% increase in the odds of being
IADL-disabled, 47% for ADL disability, 15% for cognitive
impairment, 17% for self-rated poor health, and 7% for having
at least one chronic condition. The corresponding figures in

men are 15%, 42%, 23%, 10%, and 8%, respectively (see
model II in Table 3). The effects are all positive and net of
multilevel controls.
Table 4 illustrates sex-specific LEs estimated by survival
analyses for each age stratum. Two areas of different pollution
levels were compared, one with an APL of two representing
areas of relatively good air quality and an APL of six denoting
moderately heavily polluted areas. Based on model I, in the
absolute value, LEs in women in areas of good air quality
(APL = 2) were from 0.9 years at age 100 to 3.8 years at age
65 greater than those living in moderately heavily polluted
areas (APL = 6). The corresponding figures were much
smaller in men: 0.9 years at age 65 and 0.2 years at age 100,
respectively. However, proportionally speaking, the detri-
mental effects of air pollution were greater in groups older
than 85 years of age. These patterns continued to hold after
other sociodemographic covariates were accounted for (see
model II).
Table 5 shows reductions in HEs linked to air pollu-
tion. For example, in the absolute value, the gap in HEs
for ADL in women between areas with good air quality
and moderately heavily polluted areas was 5.2 years at
age 65 and 2.8 years at age 85. Reductions in HEs related
to air pollution based on other outcomes were smaller
although also notable. These patterns are graphically illus-
trated in Figures 2 and 3, where the stronger effects of air
pollution on women are visible for most outcomes. Our
ad hoc analyses further showed that these effects were net
of demographics, psychosocial factors, health practice,
and community-level per capital gross domestic product
(data not shown).
Discussion
Although the link between air pollution and health is well
recognized (45), quantifying prospective health consequences
of air pollution has been difficult (7). Most epidemiological

studies of air pollution rely on ecological data focusing on
mortality and cardiovascular, respiratory, and pulmonary
conditions. Hence, causality in this link remains elusive and
pollution effects on other health outcomes are largely
unknown. The literature is particularly thin in China--a
rapidly developing country that has been exhibiting large-
scale environmental deterioration concomitant with an
unprecedented continued economic miracle.
To our knowledge, the present study is the first to report
prospective and contextual effects of outdoor air pollution

on LE and HE in China, using a recently collected nation-
ally representative sample of older adults. Net of a range of
control variables, exposure to outdoor air pollution led to a
reduction of LE and greater reductions of HE. These detri-
mental pollution effects seemed to be stronger for women
than men, although for men, the pollution effect on LE was
in the same direction, and the pollution effects on HEs were
remarkable as well. The largest gap in LE between areas
with good air quality and moderately heavily polluted areas
was about 4 years for women of age 65, and the correspond-
ing largest gap in HE was 5 years based on ADL for women
of age 65. Proportionally speaking, the pollution effects
were greater among the oldest old (aged 85 years or older).
Adding up to the population level, these human and health
costs can be tremendous. Clearly, the detrimental health
effects of environmental pollution in China need to be
urgently addressed.
The stronger contextual effect of outdoor air pollution on
women's health is consistent with evidence that women's
health and behavior are more responsive to a host of resi-
dential environmental factors reported in the neighborhood
effects on health research (46). It is also consistent with
growing evidence of interaction between gender and air
pollution in affecting respiratory health (47). The finding
from the present study indicates that women's greater sus-
ceptibility to air pollution is not limited in respiratory health
but also applicable to a wide range of conditions prevalent
among the elderly population. Both biological and nonbio-
logical mediators of this gender/sex gap have been pro-
posed. For example, women's smaller lung size and airway
diameter may lead to increased airway reactivity and exac-
erbate particulate deposition (48,49). As to nonbiological
factors, gender differences in socioeconomic status and
stress experiences (50,51) and other sociodemographic factors
such as marital status (52) may help explain the gendered
responses to air pollution (47). In addition, residence-based
pollution exposure may be captured more accurately for
women than for men considering that women tend to spend
more time near home being more likely to be caregivers and
less likely to have full-time jobs (46,53). These explana-
tions remain largely speculative, however. Most studies in
the neighborhood effects on health literature have not spe-
cifically investigated gender modification of neighborhood
effects; rather, they simply control for gender in regression
analyses (54,55). Arguably, compared with adjustment for
gender/sex, reporting gender/sex-stratified results can better
reveal different associations in the pollution-health link
between men and women. Air pollution epidemiology
should incorporate more detailed gender/sex analysis in the
future (47).
Another modification factor of the pollution-health link
is age. It is not surprising that older elders are more vulner-
able to air pollution compared with younger elders due to
their impaired physiological functioning and cumulative
exposure to air pollution (17). The same pattern may well
hold true when older adults are compared with younger-
and middle-aged adults. Therefore, in a society aging fast,
the dire health consequences of air pollution observed today
likely gets exacerbated over time. In other words, the
human and health costs of air pollution currently experi-
enced likely foreshadow a more devastating picture in the
foreseeable future.
Among health outcomes examined, ADL stuck out show-
ing the largest pollution-induced reductions in HE for both
men and women. This finding is novel. Compared with
other health conditions, ADL is the most debilitating condi-
tion that entails daily care giving and is often shortly fol-
lowed by mortality. Mechanisms underlying the particularly
strong ADL-pollution link need to be elucidated.
This study is limited in several ways. Misclassification of
pollution exposure is unavoidable given uncounted residential
mobility, which may underestimate the pollution effects.
With a relatively short follow-up period (ie, 3 years), this study
cannot detect longer-term pollution effects. In addition,

relative impacts of the five different components of air pol-
lution on individuals' mortality risk and health outcomes
were not distinguished. A study conducted in the United
States showed that particulates were the most damaging
pollution, whereas ozone and other pollutants had much
smaller effects (56). This finding seems to suggest air quality
standards should be more targeted on controlling the ambient
particulate levels. It can be expected that this pattern also

holds in China. However, evidence is not readily available
on this hypothesis, and the present study is not equipped to
examine this issue either. In other words, this study cannot
provide evidence-based policy recommendation as to which
aspect of air pollution should be prioritized to ameliorate.
That said, insofar as many pollutants are highly correlated
and often share common sources (56,57), mandatory sig-
nificant reductions in emissions from many sources should
be implemented to reduce air pollution in densely populated
and rapidly developing China.
In conclusion, this study highlights the prospective and
contextual effects of exposure to outdoor air pollution on
morbidity, mortality, LE, and HE in China. Evidence is clear
to support policies and programs developed and imple-
mented to address high levels of air pollution in China to
reduce pollution-induced burden of morbidity and mortality.
Despite its remarkable economic growth and overarching
improvement in standard of living in the reform era, China
has suffered significant environmental degradation, grow-
ing health disparities, and mounting public dissatisfaction
with equity issues in recent years (2,58). To halt this down-
ward trend, perhaps one viable solution is to ameliorate air
quality to impede one pathway leading to slower health
gain and greater health inequality recently looming large
in China.

Appendix
Air Pollution Index (API) definition and classification
The China National Environmental Monitoring Center
(CNEMC) collects information to construct the API based
on five atmospheric pollutants: sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen
dioxide (NO2), particulate matter smaller than 10 micrometer
in aerodynamic diameter (PM10), carbon monoxide (CO),
and ozone (O3)(31). The CNEMC measures pollutants quite
differently: SO2, NO2, and PM10 concentrations are mea-
sured daily, whereas CO and O3 are measured hourly be-
cause they are more harmful. The final API value is
calculated by day. The CNEMC uses the following proce-
dure to estimate the API. First, a sub-API is calculated daily
for each of five pollutants according to the criteria shown
in Table A using the formula: ( )
U L
i L i L
U L
I I
I I C C
C C
-

,
where Ii is the API for pollutant i; Ci is the observed daily/
hourly concentration of the ith pollutant; CU and CL are two
table values (Table 1) of upper and lower neighboring cate-
gories of the category that Ci belongs to; and IU and IL are
the corresponding upper and lower API values in Table A
(column 1). For example, if the observed SO2 concentration
is 0.925 mg per cubic meter for a given day, which is
between 0.800 mg per cubic meter and 1.600 mg per cubic
meter in column 2 in Table A, then its API should be
between 200 and 300 (column 1). Using the above formula
we get
2
SO
I = 200 + [(300­200)/(1.6­0.8)] × (0.925 × 0.8) =
215.625. The final daily API score of a city/area is assigned
by the highest API score among five pollutants. Second, the
final daily API was then converted into an air pollution level
(APL) with seven categories (or levels) scoring from 1 to 7:
excellent (API 0­50), good (API 50­100), slightly polluted
(API 100­150), lightly polluted (API 150­200), moderately
polluted (API 200­250), moderately heavily polluted (API
250­300), and heavily polluted (API  300) (see Table B).
For above example, its APL is 5. Third, the yearly average
APL is calculated by adding all daily APL scores in a given
year and dividing 365 for each pollutant. In the case when a
city/area has several monitoring sites, the APL score of that
city/area is the simple average of all sites.
