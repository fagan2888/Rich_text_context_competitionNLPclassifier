Abstract
Background: We evaluated the contributions of teen alcohol use to the formation and continuation of new and
existing friendships while in turn estimating the influence of friend drinking on individuals' regular use and heavy
drinking.
Method: Longitudinal network analysis was used to assess the mutual influences between teen drinking and
social networks among adolescents in two large Add Health schools where full network data was collected three
times. Friendship processes were disaggregated into the formation of new friendships and the continuation of
existing friendships in a joint model isolating friendship selection and friend influences.
Results: Friends have a modest influence on one another when selection is controlled. Selection is more
complicated than prior studies suggest, and is only related to new friendships and not their duration in the
largest school. Alcohol use predicts decreasing popularity in some cases, and popularity does not predict alcohol
consumption.
Conclusion: Intervention efforts should continue pursuing strategies that mitigate negative peer influences. The
development of socializing opportunities that facilitate relationship opportunities to select on healthy behaviors also
appears promising. Future work preventing teen substance use should incorporate longitudinal network assessments
to determine whether programs promote protective peer relationships in addition to how treatment effects diffuse
through social networks.
Introduction
Friends and peers are key to whether, when, and how much
adolescents drink alcohol [1-3] and are therefore central to prevention
[4-7]. By 12th grade nearly 50% of teens report being frequently with
others drinking to get high, 75% indicate that one or more friends
drink until drunk routinely [8], and over 80% drink to have a good
time with friends [9]. Because drinking impairs cognitive functioning
and judgment [10], promotes risky behaviors [11-13], and leads to
accidents and mortality [14], understanding how friendships shape--
and are shaped by--drinking is a critical public health issue [8].
In service to programmatic efforts to reduce teen drinking,
researchers have sought to determine the magnitude of friend influence
[15] by linking friends' drinking to individual drinking [16]. One
central challenge has been the inherent difficulty in accounting for
friend selection, the process by which peers become friends, when
estimating friend influence [17,18]. Without accounting for selection,
it is impossible to accurately determine whether one's drinking is
influenced by how much friends drink, or whether one's drinking
reflects homophily [19]--the extent to which "birds of a feather flock
together" [20]. Individuals may seek out others who drink like they
do, or select into environments where drinkers socialize together [21],
rather than adjusting behaviors to be more like those of friends' [22,23].
Longitudinalsocialnetworkanalysisusingmethods[24]todecompose
teen alcohol use into separate selection and influence components finds
roles for both processes [25]. Although there is disagreement about when
selection and influence each emerge in importance over adolescence,
both factors contribute to the correlation between friendship networks
and alcohol use [26-28]. We extend this novel line of research by jointly
estimating the contributions of friendships to adolescents' drinking, and
how alcohol use contributes to whether new friendships form and existing
friendships continue [21,29].
We use network analysis because self-reports are unreliable and
inflate influence estimates [30,31]. Social network measures capture
connections between each adolescent and other students based upon
reported friendships, directly capturing the friendship patterns of all
youth in the same school [32,33]. Because all adolescents in a school are
assessed, each reports on his or her own behavior, so friend estimates
are not subject to the "same-source bias" problem that confounds
influence estimates in traditional observational studies [34].
We assess how alcohol use contributes to drinking homophily with
both individual drinking behavior and friendship selection modeled as
mutually influencing processes to account for the inherent endogeneity
of influence and selection [18,23]. We assess the roles of teen popularity
(receiving friendship nominations), sociability (nominating friends),
and friend influence (average friend alcohol use) on drinking alcohol,
while controlling for selection [35]. Simultaneously, we assess the role
of drinking in connecting adolescents to one another via new and
existing friendships, and thus in shaping the friendship network as
individual and friend drinking changes over time.

Methods
Participants
We use National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health's (Add
Health) wave 1 in-school survey (observation point 1), and the wave
1 and 2 in-home surveys (observation points 2 and 3) for up to three
observation points. Add Health is a cluster stratified longitudinal study
of 7-12th grade students in 1994. Add Health researchers obtained
parent and child consent and provide de-identified data to other
researchers under approved security protocols [36]. All procedures
for this study, including data security protocols for working with
the restricted de-identified data, were approved by the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln IRB.
We use a subset of the 16 schools where friendship data was
collected at each observation point. Of these 16 schools, two are mid-
sized or larger (n>1000), and 14 are small (n<300). We analyze network
data from the two largest schools, because the other smaller schools
were either special education or middle schools, or because a network
sampling error at observation 2 restricted participants to nominating
only one female and one male friend rather than up to 5 of each (about
5% in the schools we use and over 50% in other schools; we include an
indicator for this subset of students). The resulting sample was 2,296
adolescents; 1,531 in the large, racially heterogeneous high school,
which is commonly referred to as "Jefferson High School", and 765 in
the middle-sized predominantly white high school, commonly referred
to as "Sunshine High School" [37]. Sunshine was 7% nonwhite, and
Jefferson was 6% white, 23% black, 39% Hispanic, and 32% Asian.
The network response rates are acceptable for social network analysis
[38]. Approximately 65-97% of teens provided information on at least
one friend within the network at each wave, and 86% provided at least
one nomination at 2+ waves. Missing data were handled within the
estimation procedure with the composition change method developed
for longitudinal network models [39], so that all youth were included in
the analysis and allowed to enter the study later or leave.The sample was
limited to youth with at least two drinking observations, and missing
drinking/attribute data is model imputed using standard procedures
[38,40].
The close friendship network
The close friendship network matrix captures the system and
structure of relationships among adolescents at each observation point
and so plays two roles in our models: it is both a primary endogenous
variable for modeling selection, and it captures the relationships
necessaryforestimatingfriendinfluence[41].Networksareconstructed
from up to five male and five female friend nominations from the
school roster at each wave separately. The nomination question, with
male nominations as the example, was worded as "List your closest
male friends. List your best male friend first, then your next best friend,
and so on. Girls may include boys who are friends and boyfriends."
Alcohol use
Alcohol use frequency predicts and is predicted by the friendship
network. It is based on the question, "During the last 12 months, on
how many days did you drink alcohol?" This item is a standard intensity
assessment measured on a seven-point scale with values for never
drinks, once or twice in the last year, once a month or less, 2­3 days
a month, 1­2 days a week, 3 to 5 days a week, and every day or almost
every day [22]. Due to sparse distributions in the upper categories, we
top-coded alcohol use at the sixth category. Drinking similarity, which
ranges between 0 (dissimilar) to 1 (perfectly similar), in the network is
modest between friends: 0.55 (Sunshine) and 0.61 (Jefferson). In order
to understand how close friendship is linked to heavier drinking, we
also model drunkenness frequency (friend similarity: 0.65 [Sunshine]
and 0.75 [Jefferson]) with the same categories as for alcohol use, from
the following question: "During the past twelve months, how often did
you get drunk?"
Control variables
Female is included to reflect sex-stratification in adolescent
friendships [42], grade level and race/ethnic background [43,44], which
is captured in the model with an indicator for whether or not dyads are
ofthesamerace/ethnicbackgroundintheselectionmodel,andbyblack,
Hispanic, and Asian indicators in the behavioral model (Jefferson) or
an indicator for non-white (Sunshine) in the selection model, are all
included. Adolescents self-stratify socioeconomically [45], so parent
education (observation 2) is included as: did not graduate from high
school, graduated from high school, some higher education, graduated
from college, and obtained advanced schooling.
Three additional factors related to alcohol use are included. The
first, drawn from observation 2, is parent drinks alcohol (1=never to
6=nearly every day). Parents model alcohol use [46] and friend-parent
similarity is higher than chance [47]. Because access may support
alcohol use selectivity, whether alcohol is easy to get (observation 2) is
measured from the question "Is alcohol easily available to you in your
home?" Finally, whether the youth is a regular smoker (ever smoked at
least one cigarette a day for at least 30 days) is a time-varying covariate
that influences friend selection [48] and is correlated with alcohol use
[9,11]. The final control is a time-varying (observations 1 and 2) off-list
nominations count capturing close friendships outside of school.
Statistical analysis strategy
The analysis uses Snijders and colleagues' [24,35,41] stochastic
actor-based (SAB) network model. Parameters reflect changes in
network statistics and drinking across waves using a method of
moment's estimator summarizing network-behavior configuration
changes between observations. Agent-based simulations update
parameters, estimate uncertainties, and provide an interpretational
framework. The data-constrained simulation model decomposes
network changes into sequential transitions in either one tie or
drinking for a randomly selected adolescent. Change opportunities are
governed by rate parameters determining the simulation steps needed
to reproduce changes in the observed data between observations.
Friendship selection captures friendships over time. This model
dimension specifies network structure and attributes on change/
stability in friendship status [49]. Selection is operationalized with four
parameters to discriminate between the different ways that drinking
affects friendships. The alter effect captures the extent to which teens
are chosen as friends based on their alcohol use (popularity) and the ego
effect reflects whether drinking is related to nominating more friends
(sociability). The ego-alter interaction term, the primary selection
effect, is a dyadic effect expressing an increasing logit of friendships
among higher drinkers. This effect is included first as a baseline term
capturing the presence of a friendship or not. It is then disaggregated
to reflect (b) the formation of new friendships, and (c) the continuation
of existing friendships [29]. Other included network controls/statistics
appear in (Table 1).
The friend influence model is similar to ordinal logistic regression
[50]. In addition to background controls, we include the following
parameters (see Table 1): In degree expresses how many friendship
nominations an adolescent received and measures popularity [51]. Out

degree records nominations of friends, reflecting sociability. Average
alter is the average alcohol use of the adolescent's friends and is the
primary social influence measure [35]. Main effects for control variables
and parameters for the alcohol use distribution are also included.
Results
Descriptive statistics
Descriptive statistics are presented in Tables 2 and 3. Alcohol use
and drunkenness means are stable over time, and are slightly higher
in Sunshine than Jefferson, even though similar proportions of youth
report that alcohol is easy to get. Supplementary analyses indicate
that approximately 40-50% of adolescents increased/decreased their
regular alcohol use in both schools, but only 30% either increased/
decreased the frequency with which they got drunk. The average
number of friends nominated in Sunshine decreased from nearly 6
at observation 1 to 3.5 at observation 3, and from 3.6 to fewer than
2 in Jefferson Table 3. Jaccard distances indicate that the amount of

(Tables 2 and 3).
Regular alcohol use
Focal alcohol use influence and selection parameters are presented
in Table 4 for average effects across schools, by school, and with t-ratios
comparing Sunshine and Jefferson (full results available online).
Average results were estimated by combining both schools into a single
analysis with both schools joined into a multigroup sequential analysis
[53]. Coefficients are logits.
The first panel contains results from two models with selection and
influence estimated independently. The three inferences are first that
drinking is differentially related to popularity by school; it is related
to increased popularity in Sunshine (b=.35), but lower popularity in
Jefferson (b=-0.057; t=3.57). In Sunshine, for example, each level of
alcohol use increases the odds of receiving a friendship nomination by
4% (exp[.035]=1.04). Second, drinking frequency predicts friendship
selection. Two adolescents with drinking levels one unit above the
mean have friendship odds 11% larger (exp [0.104]=1.11) than for two
teens with average drinking. Third, average alter in the influence model
indicates that higher friend use is associated with increasing individual
use. For example, in Sunshine, the odds that a teen with average use
but whose friends are on average 1-unit above the mean has odds
of increasing use that are 30% larger (exp (0.266)=1.3) than if those
friends also had average use (Table 4).
Model 3 disaggregates the ego-alter selection term into differences
in the formation of new friendships and continuation of already
existing relationships. Drinking predicts forming new friendships and
friendship continuation in Sunshine, but only friendship continuation
in Jefferson. This pattern persists in Model 4 where influence is

controlled. Notably the influence term is similar to the Model 2 results
(panel 1), indicating that influence is not strongly biased by selection.
Consistency in selection similarly suggests that influence and selection
both matter substantively but are largely statistically independent.
Model 5 add the measures of in degrees (popularity) and out
degrees (sociability) to the influence model, along with measures of
network closure to the selection model (see Table 1). Control variables
appear in Model 6. Selection and influence results are consistent across
models. Drinking is related to popularity (alter) in Sunshine but not
Jefferson, new friendships in Sunshine but not Jefferson (ego-alter,
new), continuation of existing friendships in both schools (ego-alter,
old), and that influence is an important process in both. Drinking
selection is never related to increased friend nominations (sociability),
and neither popularity (in degree) nor sociability (out degree) predicts
drinking changes, indicating that popularity does not predict drinking
changes, or that being socially active predicts use.
Drunkenness model results
A parallel model series is shown in Table 5 for drunkenness
frequency. The results are similar to alcohol use frequency, but also have
important differences. First, drunkenness is never related to popularity
in Sunshine, suggesting some nonlinearity in the returns to drinking in
that setting, and even greater associated negativity in Jefferson. Second,
drinking selection in both schools reflects the tendency for heavier
drinkers to form new friendships, but is not related to old friendship
continuation. Third, individual drunkenness changes are subject to
friend influences, just as with drinking frequency. Notably, there are
fewer significant effects in Jefferson, mostly as a result of decreasing
precision with increasingly complicated models. E.g., the size of
the ego-alter interaction (new) is the same across schools, but is not
significant in Jefferson. The influence effect is also of similar size in
the joint analysis and is statistically significant due to greater precision
(Table 5).
Discussion
Adolescent drinking, like other behaviors, predicts friendships,
but is also influenced by those relationships [54,55]. We accounted
for selection when estimating friend influences on drinking, but also
extended prior selection research [26-28] by assessing how drinking
leads to new friendships and the continuation of existing friendships.

Prior studies have generally not distinguished between friendship
formation and continuation [21,29], limiting our understanding
about how drinking contributes to friendship selection and thus how
adolescent social networks are configured.
The inability of prior research to satisfactorily address selection
has fostered numerous criticism that selection, when unaccounted for,
biases influence estimates [23,41]. When interventions are designed
around faulty inferences, the social processes they seek to modify are
likely to be ineffective. However, our findings suggest that influence
and selection are largely independent of one another. Though
more research is needed to determine if this finding is generalizable
across schools [25], an important implication is that peer influence
is a viable intervention lever in some schools even when drinking is
simultaneously a basis of friendships.
Most studies assume that selection operates the same for new or
existingfriendships[26-28].Onecontributionofourstudyisthefinding
that alcohol selection does not have the same relationship with new
versus existing friendships. We found that drinking is less consistently
related to continuing existing friendships and is instead more strongly
related to forming new friendships. Drinking behaviors in friendship
selection do not operate the way most research conceptualizes them
and may in fact largely reflect the opportunities that arise through
partying rather than a strong preference for drinkers to befriend one
another [56]. To the extent that partying reflects novelty and sensation-
seeking [57], friendships based on partying would exhibit the pattern
we have found: new friendships, but not their continuation. Efforts to
channel adolescents into exciting but safer environments may support
the creation of new and supportive friendships that protect teens from
substance use [58].
In so far as selection is less interpersonal and more environmental,
the more amenable it will be to intervention ­ which is an important
finding because prior studies assume that selection is not amenable to
intervention. Future work clarifying whether selection operates at the
dyad-level or is based on drinking as a "social focus" that organizes
social opportunities [59], is thus warranted. Emphasis on friend
influence as a policy lever and concern that friend selection is dyadic
and not amenable to intervention may have created a false sense that
peer selection does not represent a promising avenue for intervention.
Our findings suggest that future inventions should continue pursuing
strategies that mitigate negative peer influences, while also developing
socializing opportunities fostering opportunities to select on healthy
behaviors.
Our results also have implications for peer counseling, peer
education, and peer-led interventions [60], which have been developed
to mixed success [61-64]. Peer-guided approaches typically seek to
leverage social network information, such as popularity, to incorporate
positive peer influence processes into their design [65]. We found that
drinking does not strongly increase popularity, and may damage it as
in the large, heavily minority school. Moreover, we found no evidence
that drinking is responsive to popularity.
Understanding the local social dynamics of drinking is important
as some network processes, such as popularity, differ across schools
and population subgroups [66]. The between-school differences likely
reflect different attitudes about drinking in majority and minority
settings [67,68]. In general, white teens drink more than minority
youth [69,70], and the challenges of acquiring alcohol relative to other
substances in different settings may decrease its `social value' [71] and
therefore the implications it has for socially connecting youth to one
another and in fostering popularity. Variation in the role of drinking
in promoting popularity and incorporating peer leaders into programs
may have disparate implications in different schools where the social
status rewards of drinking differ.
Despite limitations (e.g., only two schools), this study makes
important contributions to understanding the social context of
teen alcohol use. Future work assessing programmatic efforts to
prevent teen substance use should incorporate longitudinal network
assessments. Friend selection and influence processes are relatively
independent when network and behavior change are considered
together. Determining how alcohol reduction programs can help teens
socialize in venues that foster relationships supportive of positive health
behaviors, while also using social networks to encourage positive rather
than negative behaviors like drinking, remains to be done. Elucidating
these joint processes is critical for ascertaining how programs can be
better leveraged to further improve prevention of teen drinking.
