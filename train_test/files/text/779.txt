Using data representative of the U.S. working population, this research explores age norms for
promotional expectations and assesses whether or not they carry with them psychological
consequences. Findings reveal some degree of normativity in promotion expectations during
two age brackets of the work life span, and they are consistent across assorted structural
features. Normative expectations, however, were not associated with job well-being when
other relevant factors were included in the analysis. Current job conditions were most clearly
linked to well-being.

Organizational case studies have recently docu-
mented what is implied in the dialogue above from
Sloan Wilson's 1955 novel, The Man in the Gray
Flannel Suit. "Social timetables" consisting of so-
cially recognized "appropriate ages and schedules of
role events across the life span" (Nydegger, 1986a, p.
710) appear to provide normative definitions of ca-
reer progress. In general, these studies suggest that
workers share judgments of age-related career pro-
gress (Lawrence, 1984; Sofer, 1970); they may use
this awareness to gauge their own and others' ad-
vancement accordingly (Kanter, 1977); and time-
tables may be used by superiors in evaluating em-
ployee performance (Lawrence, 1988). Lawrence, for
instance, found that "deviation" from these norma-
tive timetables "is associated with performance rat-
ings" (1988, p. 331).
1The data utilized in this study were made available by the Inter-
University Consortium for Political and Social Research. Support for the
original data collection of the Quality of Employment Survey was provided
by the Employee Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor.
Original investigators were Robert Quinn and Graham Staines. Neither they
nor the Consortium bear any responsibility for the analyses or interpreta-
tion presented here.

The consistency of findings across these studies is
impressive. Nevertheless, generalizability is limited
by their firm-specific data and by a predominant
emphasis on managerial workers. The question of
how much consensus regarding career timetables
exists across features of the American work land-
scape remains unanswered.
The present study addresses these issues. It draws
on national data for a comparative assessment of
mobility-related age norms. Using data from the
Quality of Employment Survey, which was designed
to be representative of the U.S. working population,
I investigated the existence of age norms for job
promotions. Specifically, my aims were to see if
there are "social timetables" for future promotions,
to examine the variability of these timetables across
selected structural features of the working world
(e.g., Calasanti, 1988), and finally to assess whether
or not these timetables carry with them psychologi-
cal consequences (e.g., Lawrence, 1984; Neugarten,
1979).
Background
The question of whether findings of perceived
timetables indicate the presence of age norms has
been the subject of some debate. Still at issue are the
conceptualization and measurement of norms, and
their existence and status as an explanatory property
in life-course transitions (Marini, 1984; also see use-
ful overviews by Hagestad & Neugarten, 1985, and
Hagestad, 1990).
The sociocultural (Hagestad & Neugarten, 1985)
conceptualization of age norms has tended to take
one of two forms. Marini's (1984, p. 232) "strong"
version states that norms are composed of collective
Vol. 36, No. 2,1996 189
consensus and reinforcing sanctions; hence, mea-
surement must include both components. A second,
"weaker" version of age norms is found in Law-
rence's (1988, p. 313) conceptualization of organiza-
tionally based age norms as "widely shared judg-
ments of the standard or typical ages of individuals
holding each role or status." They constitute "shared
frames of reference" (Newcomb, 1950, p. 266), and
thus would be part of the symbolic world views of
organizational workers.
Lawrence's formulation is akin to recent work
within the study of culture, which has provided fresh
and useful conceptualizations of cultural compo-
nents such as norms. Swidler (1986, p. 273), for in-
stance, views culture as a "'tool kit' of symbols,
stories, rituals, and world views," and a similar ap-
proach is used by Buchmann (1989), who draws upon
Bourdieu's theoretical framework to examine the
transition into adulthood. My investigation follows
their approach, and hence uses this "weaker" con-
ceptualization. Accordingly, while it may well be true
that these norms are accompanied by sanctions, in
this perspective sanctions are not the defining condi-
tion of norms.
Analytical Framework
Studies have shown that shared judgments of typi-
cal ages for holding particular organizational posi-
tions do exist (e.g., Kanter, 1977; Lawrence, 1984,
1988; Sofer, 1970). Lawrence (1988) argues that these
norms are generated by existing age distributions
among positions. In turn, shifts in the distribution
are likely to result in workers taking note and "devel-
oping] age-based promotional expectations that fit
their observations" (1988, p. 314). Promotional ex-
pectations refer to individual anticipations of upward
moves within an organization, while age-based pro-
motional expectations are those attached to particu-
lar ages or an age range.
The present analysis explores the possibility of
studying age norms through individuals' expectations
for promotion, important life-course phenomena be-
cause often "subjective expectations of one's oppor-
tunities in the future structure the individual's lines of
conduct" (Buchmann, 1989, p. 36). Age norms are
operationalized here as age-related shared expecta-
tions regarding when promotions should be re-
ceived. This definition allows for different ap-
proaches in examining whether or not age norms
exist. For instance, there may be age-related patterns
for the time-frame in which promotions are expected
(e.g., expecting the next promotion in one year or 10
years). If all workers expect their next promotion
within the same time period, then it would be difficult
to speak of age norms in this sense. Such may be the
case given the emphasis on organizational mobility
(e.g., Kanter, 1977, see ch. 6); employees want, and
perhaps expect, promotions sooner rather than later.
Such attitudes suggest a near-term promotion expec-
tation hypothesis. Thus:
Hypothesis 1: Workers, regardless of age, will ex-
pect a promotion within a relatively short time span.
If expected timing of promotion varies by age,
however, then another hypothesis is suggested. Pat-
terns surrounding expected age at next promotion
may emerge. If some age categories are identified as
likely times for promotion while others are not, it
would suggest the presence of age norms. Hence,
my second hypothesis is as follows:
Hypothesis 2: Promotions may be more antici-
pated in some age range(s) than in others.
A second general issue addressed in this study is
potential variation in age norms (Marini, 1984). A
variety of factors may differentiate age norms for
promotional expectations. Industry, organization
size, and job categories are three structural features
of the work world which prior work suggests as
pertinent (e.g., Dannefer, 1987; Kaufman & Spiler-
man, 1982; Lawrence, 1988, p. 331). Varied age distri-
butions across the forementioned structural features
may give rise to diverse age-based promotional ex-
pectations (Lawrence, 1988, p. 314). Where opportu-
nity for advancement extends further through the
life span, and, hence, is reflected in the age distribu-
tion, then we will find older age norms for promo-
tional expectations. It is beyond the scope of this
investigation to offer detailed hypotheses for all
three structural features examined here, but in line
with the reasoning set forth above, the following
hypothesis is proposed:
Hypothesis 3: Promotions may be more antici-
pated in later age ranges in large versus small
organizations.
Prior studies have suggested that if age norms
comprise a timetable against which people may mea-
sure themselves, then such comparison may carry
psychological consequences (Neugarten, 1979;
Neugarten, Moore, & Lowe, 1968). While firm-
specific data reveal some evidence of this (e.g., Law-
rence, 1984), it would be useful to examine the im-
pact of being "off-time" regarding one's promotion
expectations with data from a larger sample of work-
ers than has been used previously. Moreover, initial
findings (Lawrence, 1984) introduced limited con-
trols for other factors which may influence well-
being. For instance, promotions (e.g., Rosenbaum,
1984) and current job characteristics (e.g., Kalleberg,
1977) are two work features thought to be linked to
psychological outcomes. Hence, I compare the nor-
mative factor of being off-time against these other,
"structural" components (e.g., Hagestad, 1990) rela-
tive to well-being. Dannefer (1984, p. 110) suggests
that the specific aging phenomenon of midlife psy-
chosocial development -- a topic of increasing im-
portance for aging researchers -- would be a useful
test case for this approach.
Because of my interest in the workplace, I exam-
ined selected facets of psychological well-being on
the job. Two heavily researched constructs relevant
to descriptions of midlife (e.g., Farrell & Rosenberg,
1981; Levinson, Darrow, Klein, Levinson, & McKee,
1978) are job satisfaction and job involvement (e.g.,
Kalleberg, 1977; Kalleberg & Loscocco, 1983;
190 The Gerontologist
Lorence & Mortimer, 1985). Also, in light of the
midlife "aspiration-achievement gap" (Brim, 1976), I
have included a third measure representing respon-
dents' satisfaction with their career mobility to date.
There are two stages to the following investigation.
First, I present a descriptive analysis of the age-
distribution of promotional expectations, including
potential age variation by the aforementioned fac-
tors. The second stage examines the connection be-
tween promotional expectations and job well-being
among middle-aged men.
Methods
The data chosen for this project were drawn from
the 1972-73 Quality of Employment Survey (QES).
The QES data were meant to be representative of the
U.S. working population, as individuals at least 16
years of age or older who were working for pay at
least 20 hours per week were selected (Quinn &
Shepard, 1974, p. 7).
The sample (N = 1,455) was selected through a
multistage sampling technique used by the Univer-
sity of Michigan's Survey Research Center (Quinn &
Shepard, 1974) to select national probability samples
of dwellings. Data for this study, however, are drawn
only from the males (n = 833) in the sample because
of past differences in men's and women's work and
career experience (e.g., Treiman, 1985).
Measures
Time to Next Promotion. -- This measure is an
ordinal variable representing the time period within
which a respondent expects to receive his next
promotion.
Age-based Promotional Expectation. -- This calcu-
lates the expected age at next promotion for each
man by adding the time to next promotion, in aver-
age number of years, to his present age (for a more
complete discussion of this construction, see Ap-
pendix B).
Age Norms Regarding Future Promotions. -- This
construct was defined earlier as shared expectations
of when promotions will be received. Critical issues
involved in the measurement of age norms, how-
ever, are establishing age boundaries and the
amount of agreement required before we speak of
consensus (Lawrence, 1988, p. 319). For the present
study, 5-year age ranges are formed to allow a de-
tailed assessment of age-based distributions consist-
ing of the proportion of men who expect to be in a
given age group at next promotion. Agreement will
be gauged by inspecting modal frequencies (Jacob-
sen & Van der Voordt, 1980, p. 471; see Note 1).
Organizational Size. --This is a self-reported mea-
sure, in ordinal categories, of the approximate num-
ber of employees where respondent works.
Industry and Job Category. -- These are catego-
rized using the 1970 Census industry and occupation
codes, respectively.
Number of Promotions. --A self-reported measure
asking how many job changes respondent consid-
ered to be moves to a higher level position is used.
Job Rewards. -- Prior research suggests that two
types of job rewards -- intrinsic and extrinsic -- are
especially critical regarding psychological outcomes
(e.g., Kalleberg, 1977; Kalleberg & Loscocco, 1983;
Lashbrook, 1992). These measures are indices com-
prising summed items asking the respondent, "How
true you feel each is of your job?" with a 4-point
response scale ranging from "This is not at all true of
my job" to "This is very true of my job." Intrinsic
rewards are measured by the following three items:
"opportunity to develop abilities," "work is interest-
ing," and "freedom to decide how work is done."
Extrinsic reward items include pay and security.
Job Challenge. -- This is measured by an index
comprising the following items descriptive of one's
job: "keep learning new things," "requires high
skill," "allows doing a variety of different things,"
"allows one to use learned skills and knowledge."
Duncan's SES. --Available in the original data, this
measure assigns a status score to each occupational
title based on a function of income and education.
Psychological Variables
Job Satisfaction. -- I use a standard measure of job
satisfaction which is an index composed of four
questions regarding the job in general (Lincoln &
Kalleberg, 1985). Included are questions asking how
satisfied in general is the worker, would he take the
same job again, would he recommend it to a friend,
and how well does it measure up to what he thought.
Except for the general satisfaction item, the ques-
tions are all answered on a 4-point Likert scale.
Job Involvement. -- This is measured by a 3-item
index similar to that used in earlier research (e.g.,
Lorence & Mortimer, 1985). Items included are ques-
tions asking how involved one is in work, whether
time drags at work, and how interesting is the work.
Career Satisfaction. --This is a composite measure
formulated by the original investigators. It is made
up of responses to three statements scored with a 4-
point Likert scale ("not at all true" - "very true"):
"chances for promotion are good," "promotions are
handled fairly," and "employer is concerned with
giving everyone a chance to get ahead." All three
indices are constructed additively with no weighting
or other manipulation; a high score indicates a
higher state of that dimension.

Results
The Age Distribution of Promotional Expectations
Time to next expected promotion is broken down
by age group in Table 1. The first hypothesis is re-
jected since the expectation of near-term promotion
is not constant, but exhibits a substantial linear de-
cline with increasing age. Conversely, at the oppo-
site extreme, the percentage of men who do not
expect one for 20 years, or never, increases linearly.
The majority of men below age 35 expect their next
promotion soon, whereas many of those age 50 or
above do not expect another in all likelihood. It
should be noted, however, that even among these
older men, some are expecting a near-term promo-
tion (e.g., 12% of those 50-54). Middle-aged men,
defined here relative to work life as those between
the ages of 35 and 50, represent a transitional group.
Especially among those in their late 30s, roughly
equal proportions either expect their next promo-
tion within 3 years or not for another 20 years, if at all.
The first column of Table 2 presents the distribu-
tion of the expected ages at time of next promotion.
This distribution does not reveal an all-or-nothing
clustering at certain ages, but it does indicate two
discernible peaks, one at ages 25-34, the other at 45-
49. In the overall distribution across 10 age catego-
ries, slightly less than one-half (46.5%) expected a
promotion within these three categories: 25-29, 30-
34, 45-49.
Some problematic issues arise in evaluating the
second hypothesis, however. Table 2 also presents
the actual age distribution of the sample which al-
lows some assessment of whether the age-based
patterns regarding expected promotion timing are,
to any degree, an artifact of the sample. A partial
answer was supplied by information in Table 1,
which established that the timing of when one ex-
pects his next promotion is not uniform across age
categories. Had this been the case, then the age-
based promotional expectation pattern would in-
deed have been simply a consequence of the actual
age distribution of the sample.
A closer comparison of the two distributions in
Table 2 is also instructive. For instance, 15.5% of the
sample is between the ages of 30 to 34, but only 9.4%
will be between the ages of 35 and 39 when they
expect to receive their next promotion. Moreover,
some of the latter percentage is likely made up of
men younger than age 30, and from Table 1 it is seen
that almost one-third of those ages 30 to 34 expect
either to not ever receive a promotion or not until
they are in their 50s. Likewise, the number who
expect a promotion at ages 45 to 49 exceed those
men ages 40 to 44 by nearly 20% (12.7% vs 10.6%),
thus indicating that this age category is drawing siz-
able numbers of expectancies from other age
groups.
Some similarities between the two distributions do
exist, however, since some respondents expect a
promotion soon, hence contributing to proportions
in the same or next immediate age category. In sum,
there seems to be qualified support for the second
hypothesis, but another issue warrants discussion.
The distribution of age-based promotional expec-
tations found in Table 2 does not control for eligibil-
ity, i.e., those over 35 could not have chosen ages 25
to 29 as a time for their next promotion. Thus, the
initial simple presentation may actually understate
the consensus in certain age categories. To address
this possibility, the sample is broken into two
groups: those 30 years of age or younger and those
over 30 plus those under age 30 whose age at next
expected promotion is 35 or over. The aim is to arrive
at more accurate estimates of those who actually
selected a given expected age from those who poten-
tially could have. For instance, as noted above, the
men over 30 could not have said they expected their
next promotion before age 30, but it is not the case
that some of the younger respondents could not
have selected later age ranges.
As suspected, when calculations are based on the
more eligible pool of respondents, results in the first
column of Table 3 show heightened agreement con-
cerning age at next expected promotion in the same
categories -- ages 25 to 34 and 45 to 49 -- as noted in
the original distribution in Table 2. In addition, the

peak at ages 45-49 seems due primarily to those
workers under age 30 expecting another promotion
at this time given its proportional increase among the
younger vs older workers. This further reinforces the
earlier tentative conclusion that initial results in Ta-
ble 2 were not simply an artifact of the sample's age
distribution.
Structural Variations in Timing of Promotional
Expectations
Table 4 reveals that across different-sized organiza-
tions, the distribution of expected age at time of next
promotion is quite similar to the original findings
shown in Table 2. Among those working in small- to
medium-sized organizations, the highest propor-
tions are again reported in the two contiguous
groups making up the 25 to 34 age range, while for
those in large organizations, the modal categories
are 30 to 39. The latter distribution also exhibits a less
pronounced decline after age 34 as compared to
small- and medium-sized organizations. Indeed,
one-quarter of the men working in the largest organi-
zations expect to receive their next promotion in
their late 30s and early 40s. Within small- and
medium-sized organizations, the proportion of men
who expect a promotion during the 45-49 age period
increases as it did for the sample at large. In light of
these findings, the third hypothesis receives sup-
port, but the percentage of those in the 45-49 age
period was anticipated to be larger among those
working in large organizations vs small and medium.
Table 4 reveals some age-distribution variation
among industry types, but, again, there is a fair
degree of consistency in age-based patterns (see
Note 2). With the exceptions of the construction
industry and services, the modal age range is 30 to 34.
However, an equal percentage within the transporta-
tion, communication, and utility industries expects
to receive their next promotion when they are 25 to
29. Similar to the original distribution, many of the

industries exhibit a decrease in the percentage of
men who expect their next promotion either in their
late 30s or early 40s followed by an upturn in the
proportion who expect to be promoted in the sec-
ond half of their 40s. Taken together, if expectations
are any indication of opportunity, then those work-
ers in larger organizations and select industries (e.g.,
services and government) may have more opportuni-
ties available to them further into their work career,
and therefore respondents expect promotions later
in their working lives. This also provides some sup-
port for my third hypothesis.
Job category is the third structural feature used in
this comparative assessment (see Note 3). Table 5
shows that, once more, peaks in promotion expect-
ancies are found in the age categories of 25-34 and
45-49 across many of these occupational classifica-
tions. However, among operatives and nonfarm la-
borers, the modal response is located in the 20 to 24
age bracket, suggesting, as was the case for construc-
tion workers, that opportunities come earlier. An
opposite trend, however, is displayed for managers
and administrators since their modal category is the
55 to 59 age group, making it reasonable to postulate
that more opportunity is available to men in these
positions and extends later into one's career. This
finding would also be in accordance with the reason-
ing underlying the third hypothesis (see Note 4).
Psychological Consequences
The descriptive data revealed two age periods in
which men expect promotions. The first was earlier
in the work career (ages 25-34), while the second
tends to fall during midcareer (ages 45-49). If expec-
tations are at all indicative of opportunities, this latter
period may represent one's last chances for further
promotion. Rosenbaum's (1984, see especially ch. 3)
case study of a major firm presents evidence that this
is indeed the case for some workers. In addition,
ages 45 to 50 represent a more general age norm
concerning "when most men hold their top job"
(Neugarten et al., 1968, p. 24; more recent corrobo-
ration is found in Zepelin, Sills, & Heath, 1986-87;
however, they report some expansion of the age
range).
In light of the findings from this study and others,
it is reasonable to consider the midlife period of
one's work career (ages 35 to 50) as representing a
potential watershed. As much is shown in Table 2,
wherein clearly the normative expectation for men
under age 35 is to be promoted soon (3 years or less),
while that for those older than age 50 is to never
expect another promotion again. These findings sug-
gest that younger men would provide an interesting
comparison group to midlife men in analyzing the
connection between normative expectations and
well-being.
Despite the hypothesized role that career dy-
namics may play in midlife men's psychosocial devel-
opment (e.g., Brim, 1976; Farrell & Rosenberg, 1981;
Levinson et al., 1978), its lack of careful delineation
suggests by its omission an uncritical acceptance of
midlife men's similarity in career experience and
psychological response, i.e., most if not all men
endure psychological difficulty as a result of evaluat-
ing their career progress compared to their aspira-
tions (e.g., Kalleberg & Loscocco, 1983). This may be
attributed in part to the influence of a developmental
psychological perspective (Dannefer, 1984). How-
ever, the anticipated "naturalness" of midlife experi-
ence precludes studying those structural and cultural
dynamics surrounding career mobility, dynamics
which Dannefer's (1984, p. 110) sociogenic approach
proposes "may operate directly to produce [varied
psychological outcomes] in the middle years." I turn
now to a preliminary examination of these ideas.
Clearly, for younger men to be "off time" regard-
ing one's promotional expectations is to never ex-
pect another, but it is more ambiguous for middle-
aged men, as Table 1 reveals. To examine this
normative factor using regression analysis and com-
pare younger to middle-aged men, a dummy variable
is created by coding those men who expected their
next promotion in more than 20 years or never as " 1 "
and all others as "0." This indicator is included to-
gether with other structural measures such as num-

The Gerontologist
ber of promotions received and selected job charac-
teristics. The model is limited because my aim is not a
full specification of the influences on particular job
well-being measures, but a comparative examination
of hypothesized influences. Table 6 presents de-
scriptive information and correlations for these mea-
sures. Among middle-aged men, there is little associ-
ation between the normative factor of "off time"
promotional expectations and the measures of well-
being, while for younger men there appears to be a
moderate association. Moreover, among middle-
aged men, the positive sign of the coefficient be-
tween the normative factor and job satisfaction
means that those men who do not expect another
promotion are higher in job satisfaction.
Table 7 presents the results of the regression analy-
sis of the three dependent measures (see Note 5).
Not expecting another promotion is not significantly
associated with any of the three well-being variables.
Clearly, among middle-aged men, the results under-
score the importance of more proximate job condi-
tions, especially the intrinsic rewards associated with
the job, for all three measures of well-being. For
younger men, the normative factor of being "off
time" is significantly associated with job involvement
and career satisfaction. However, when other vari-
ables are introduced into the model its connection to
job involvement disappears, but it remains a signifi-
cant factor for career satisfaction, if slightly reduced.
Intrinsic rewards stand out once again as the most
powerful influence related to these measures of job
well-being.
Discussion
Findings support the existence of some degree of
normativity in promotion expectations in that some

age categories are characterized by more consensus
than others. One-third of the respondents expect
advancement within the contiguous age categories
of 25 to 29 and 30 to 34. There is an additional period
-- ages 45-49 -- where more agreement is found
compared to the remaining age brackets. Since these
patterns are based on expectations, and hence re-
flect what is in people's consciousness, they clearly
suggest the existence of age norms regarding pro-
motion expectations. At the same time, it is impor-
tant to note that there is not overwhelming consen-
sus, especially when compared to other studies of
career-related age norms (e.g., Lawrence, 1984,
1988). It is, perhaps, not surprising that age norms
appear to be stronger and more visible in the context
of specific organizations which tend to develop their
own culture.
Despite some variation, the age distribution is sur-
prisingly consistent across the structural features ex-
amined here. This contrasts with Nydegger's (1986b)
conjecture that "there are no general timetables of
the worklife" (p. 144). In fact, results here are in line
with data on actual promotion patterns (Rosenbaum,
1984; see especially ch. 3).
The second part of the analysis gauged the relative
association of one particular normative facet (i.e., if
one was "off-time" regarding his promotional expec-
tations) with job well-being compared with other
selected structural features also found to be linked to
psychological outcomes. The mobility-related vari-
ables, both the structural measure of number of
promotions and the normative indicator of expecta-
tions for future promotion, exhibited no statistically
significant association with the three job well-being
measures for middle-aged men. While the mobility-
related measures exhibited some direct impact on
the career satisfaction of younger men, covariance is
present among the normative factor of being off-
time in one's promotional expectations, job charac-
teristics, and well-being. Hence, the prior variable's
influence may be even stronger than demonstrated
here. A similar effect, if less pronounced for middle-
aged men compared to the younger men, may be
operating given some of the correlation coefficients.
Consideration of these links between mobility and
current job characteristics warrants further testing
with appropriate statistical techniques to see
whether or not mobility-related influences might be
mediated through more immediate job conditions
(e.g., Lashbrook, 1992). Kanter's (1977) ethnographic
study reinforces this lead as she notes that "auton-
omy and independence, growth and a sense of chal-
lenge, the chance to learn [are] earned through in-
creasing hierarchical position" (p. 131). Hence,
mobility-related influences may operate more indi-
rectly than originally proposed by Dannefer (1984).
The strongest associations with well-being definitely
were found in such characteristics of the job, repre-
sented here by the measures of intrinsic and extrinsic
rewards and job challenge, thus reinforcing earlier
conclusions established by Kalleberg (1977) and
Kohn (e.g., Kohn & Schooler, 1973).
Previous findings regarding the psychological con-
sequences of normative assessments are mixed (e.g.,
Lawrence, 1984; Rook, Catalano, & Dooley, 1989).
Comparing the regression results from the two age
groups suggests that when there is strong evidence
of a normative time-frame for one's next expected
promotion, then being "off time" is likely to influ-
ence job well-being. As noted earlier, such a clear
normative timeframe for promotion did not exist for
middle-aged men. Many of these men may have
adjusted to their career prospects, despite the
gloomier midlife scenarios. It is possible that those
who feel they are settled in their jobs and do not
expect future movement actually feel some content-
ment because such a settled position is preferred.
Secondary analyses of existing data sets pose
noted limitations (Kiecolt & Nathan, 1985). Thus, this
study, despite using more extensive data, must still
be seen as exploratory since the analysis was framed
around some measures which were not part of the
original investigators' purposes. Also, the original
design relied on self-report measures regarding
mobility-related concerns among others, the accu-
racy of which may be questionable (e.g., Lawrence,
1988; Rosenbaum, 1984). However, in light of the
correspondence noted above between these find-
ings and some of Rosenbaum's results, this may not
be as much of a problem as thought. Finally, an
additional limitation involves the cross-sectional nat-
ure of the data. The age-based promotional expecta-
tion rates reported here were gained by asking re-
spondents of varying ages when they expect their
next promotion. Age patterns are inferred from the
resulting distribution. Longitudinal data would, of
course, be more desirable, or at the very least an
extended prospective design which might ask indi-
viduals if and when they expect promotions (not just
their next one) to be forthcoming during their work
lives. Studies designed to address specifically the
issues examined here would undoubtedly shed more
light on these phenomena. While additional quanti-
tative investigations would be useful, so too would
more qualitative studies given the importance of
expectations in the symbolic horizons of the actor.

Notes
1. Jacobsen and Van der Voordt (1980) also offer some
statistical guidelines for assessing modal frequencies.
However, they point out (pp. 471-472) that when there are
a large number of response categories, the proportion
which may signify a norm is likely to be lower than "when
there are only two or three such categories." Given the
numerous age categories in the present analysis, it is un-
likely that a clear majority of responses will fall in one age
range. Thus, the requirements for establishing age norms
will likely have to be less stringent than their proposed
guidelines.
2. All possible industries found in the data are not in-
cluded here. Some industries had too few cases (agricul-
ture and fisheries [n = 12]; mining [n = 5]; and finance
and insurance [n = 29]) for the results to be conclusive in
even a preliminary fashion.
3. For the same reasons as above, I only report data on
those job categories that had at least 30 respondents. Omit-
ted from this analysis are sales workers, transport equip-
ment operatives, farmers and farm managers, farm laborers
and farm foremen, and private household workers.
4. It is beyond the reach of this study to provide in-
depth comparisons of the distributions of expected age at
time of next promotion across these structural features
against their actual age distributions. Based on the earlier
discussion of these issues in the text, it seems unlikely that
the expected age distributions across these structural fea-
tures would simply be artifacts of actual age. The actual age
distributions for these features are presented in Appendix
C for examination.
5. Variables are entered in a hierarchical fashion with
the general control variable of Duncan SES entered first.
Results displayed include those effects net of the control
variable. This strategy allows me to first examine the main
target variables of "behind time" expectations and promo-
tions, while next introducing other factors in what is essen-
tially a logic of elaboration.
Partial plots of residuals were inspected to ensure the
appropriateness of regression analysis with these vari-
ables. Generally, no severe departures from the assump-
tions required for regression were indicated. One excep-
tion was the promotion variable. However, various
transformations did not successfully overcome this limita-
tion. Because any such transformation makes substantive
interpretation of the results difficult, plus the fact that
coefficients and R2 remained stable through such attempts,
I deemed it best to enter this variable unaltered.
Appendix B
Constructing the measure of individual age-based pro-
motional expectations began with this Quality of Employ-
ment Survey item: "How many years or months do you
think it will be before you are given a chance to take on a
job at a higher level where you now work?" Responses
were chosen from the following ordinal set of time spans:
1. Less than a month.
2. One to 3 months.
3. More than 3 months, up to 12 months.
4. More than one year, up to and including 3 years.
5. More than 3 years, up to and including 5 years.
6. More than 5 years, up to and including 10 years.
7. More than 10 years, up to and including 20 years.
8. More than 20 years; never.
The first three categories were collapsed into one repre-
senting the time span of up to one year. Similar to previous
age norm research (Zepelin et al., 1986-87), each of the
remaining time spans is converted to single years by taking
its midpoint response and rounding upwards if necessary.
Vol. 36, No. 2,1996 197
Using this strategy, response numbers one through seven
were reassigned the following values:
1-3 = 1
4 = 2
5 = 4
6 = 8
7 = 15
These values are then added to the respondents' ages to
generate an age-based promotional expectation (e.g., if
the respondent was 37, and he said he expected his next
promotion more than 5 years from now, up to and includ-
ing 10, 8 is added to his age, resulting in an expectation for
promotion at the age of 45.
The last original category is admittedly problematic since
it contains two separate responses: "More than 20 years;
never." Dropping these responses because of their ambig-
uous nature, however, results in losing much information
(46.6% of the respondents gave this response). While a
time period of 20 years or more clearly makes little sense
for older respondents (e.g., if a 50-year-old man expects a
promotion in 20 years, the resulting age norm would be
70), it is still feasible that younger men who selected this
response (and they are many: 24.3% of the men under age
40 selected this response) did not mean that they "never"
expect a promotion.
I utilize a compromise solution whereby I have assigned
this last category the value of 25, but then dropped any
respondents whose age-based expectation is over 65. This
way I am able to retain some potentially meaningful infor-
mation and not lose nearly half of the sample.
