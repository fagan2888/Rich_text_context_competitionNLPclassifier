Abstract
Background: Little is known about the influence of psychosocial factors on diabetes mellitus. The
aim of this study was to improve understanding of the association between two psychosocial
factors- sense of control and social support- and diabetes mellitus.
Methods: The authors analyzed data from 2,592 U.S. households in the 1995 survey of the Aging,
Status, and the Sense of Control study. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine
whether sense of personal control and social support were associated with DM and whether
gender, race, and Hispanic ethnicity modified these associations.
Results: After adjusting for age, obesity, and socioeconomic position, a one point increase in sense
of control (i.e., a stronger sense of control) was associated a significant reduction in risk of diabetes
mellitus (odds ratio = 0.67, 95% confidence interval: 0.47, 0.95). A weak social support system was
associated with a non-significant risk of diabetes (odds ratio = 1.32, 95% confidence interval: 0.93,
1.89). No effect modification was detected.
Conclusion: Sense of control deserves greater attention as a predictor of diabetes mellitus.
Further studies of the contribution of psychosocial factors to diabetes mellitus should assess the
temporal nature of this relationship.
Background
Over the past thirty years, psychosocial variables have
emerged as important risk factors for cardiovascular dis-
ease [1] but similar attention has not been paid to their
potential contribution to diabetes mellitus (DM). Previ-
ous research of psychosocial characteristics related to DM
has focused largely on their role in the management of the
illness [2]. Factors such as anger, hostility, depression,
lack of social support, and locus of control have been
associated with coronary heart disease incidence and mor-
tality [3-6]. Because type 2 DM shares many risk factors
with cardiovascular impairment, it seems plausible that
some of these same psychosocial factors may impact one's
risk for developing DM.

Type 2 DM, which accounts for 90%­95% of the total DM
prevalence in the United States, is associated with obesity
and physical inactivity [7], largely preventable risk factors,
which have been linked to a sense of control [8,9] and to
social support [9,10]. Sense of control is the belief that
one can and does master, control, and shape one's own
life, and is related to self-efficacy and locus of control [11].
Sense of control may provide empowerment to synthesize
health-promoting behaviors into a coherent lifestyle,
thereby reducing one's risk for a number of diseases [11].
Social support is the perception of existing within social
embeddedness; that is, having friends or family who may
provide comfort and assistance [12]. Social support may
improve psychological well-being and is directly associ-
ated with physical health [13]. There is a large body of evi-
dence that documents lower risk of depression and
psychological distress for individuals with a high degree
of social support [14]. Likewise, social support has been
linked with cardiovascular disease [15-18].
In the present study, we examined whether a strong sense
of personal control and strong social support were associ-
ated with a reduced self-reported prevalence of DM in a
U.S. population. In addition, we examined whether these
relationships were modified by sociodemographic charac-
teristics including gender, race, or Hispanic ethnicity con-
sidering DM affects a disproportionate number of
minorities in the U.S.
Methods
This study used data from the Aging, Status, and Sense of
Control (ASOC) survey, a representative national tele-
phone survey of 2,592 English-speaking respondents aged
18 to 95, with an oversample of those aged 60 and older.
The ASOC study, conducted in 1995, examined the rela-
tionship between age and changes in the sense of control
over one's own life. The Survey Research Laboratory of the
University of Illinois conducted data collection, and the
National Institute on Aging funded the study (R01
AG12393, PI: John Mirowsky). A prescreened random-
digit dialing method was used to decrease the probability
of contacting a business or nonworking number and to
decrease the standard errors compared with the Mitofsky-
Waksberg method, while producing a sample with similar
demographic profile [19].
English-speaking persons age 18 or older were eligible to
participate in the survey, and two subsamples were
devised to produce an 80% oversample of persons age 60
or older. In the main sample, the adult with the most
recent birthday was selected as a participant. In the other
sample, the person aged 60 years or older with the most
recent birthday was selected to participate. Interviews
were completed with 71.6% of contacted, eligible per-
sons, resulting in 2,592 participants ranging in age from
18 to 95. Respondents were asked about their physical
health, including activities of daily living; mental health,
including anxiety and enjoyment of life; health behaviors;
use of health care services; sense of control over their lives;
social support and participation in community activities;
and social hardship, including assault and extended
unemployment. Table 1 demonstrates the comparability
of the ASOC study population with the general U.S. pop-
ulation, using 1995 demographic statistics from the U.S.
Census Bureau [20].
Respondents who answered the following question with
an affirmative response were considered diabetics: "Have
you ever been diagnosed or told by a doctor that you have
diabetes?" Types 1 and 2 DM were not distinguished and
additionally age of onset was not ascertained. Social sup-
port was conceptually defined as resources provided by
other persons [21], including emotional and instrumental
support. Emotional support includes the things that indi-
viduals do to make a person feel connected, loved, and
cared for, while instrumental support refers to the type of
assistance that others provide [22]. To measure emotional
support, respondents were asked, "How much do you
agree with the statements: 'I have someone I can turn to
for support and understanding when things get rough,'
and 'I have someone I can really talk to.' To measure
instrumental support, respondents were asked, "How
much do you agree with the statements, 'I have someone
who would help me out with things, like give me a ride,
watch the kids or house, or fix something,' and 'I have
someone who would take care of me if I were sick."
Responses were coded 1= strongly agree, 2 = agree, 3 = dis-
agree, 4 = strongly disagree; and the mean response served
as an index of social support. A low score indicates a high
degree of social support. This index was found to have a
coefficient alpha in the ASOC study population of 0.85
[23].
A personal control scale created by Mirowsky & Ross [24]
was used to measure sense of control. Responses to the
following four perceived control questions were coded 2
= strongly agree, 1 = agree, 0 = neutral, -1 = disagree, -2 =
strongly disagree:

(2) "I can do just about anything I really set my mind to"
Control over bad
(3) "My misfortunes are the result of mistakes I have
made"
(4) "I am responsible for my failures"
Responses to the following four perceived powerlessness
questions are coded 2 = strongly disagree, 1 = disagree, 0
= neutral, -1 = agree, -2 = strongly agree.
Powerlessness over good
(1) "The really good things that happen to me are mostly
luck"
(2) "There's no sense planning a lot­if something good is
going to happen, it will"
Powerlessness over bad
(3) "Most of my problems are due to bad breaks"
(4) "I have little control over the bad things that happen
to me"
The sense of control scale was calculated as a mean score
of the responses to these eight questions, with a high score
indicating a strong sense of control. This index was found
to have a coefficient alpha in the ASOC study population
of 0.68 [24].
Self-reported sociodemographic characteristics of
respondents included sex, age, race, ethnicity, and socioe-
conomic position. Age was analyzed as a continuous var-
iable, coded in years. Race was categorized as White,
African American, and other (including Asian or Pacific
Islander, Native Americans, and those who responded
"other"). Ethnicity was dichotomized as either Hispanic
or not Hispanic. Because race was not mutually exclusive
for Hispanic ethnicity, both race and ethnicity variables
were included in the analysis. Body mass index (BMI) was
calculated using self-reported height and weight values
and were dichotomized into obese ( 30 kg/m2) or not
obese (< 30 kg/m2), based on clinical guidelines estab-
lished by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
[25]. Socioeconomic position was operationalized by
education, and ascertained by asking respondents, "What
is the highest grade or year in school that you have com-
pleted?" This variable was categorized as (1) less than high
school, (2) high school completed or some college com-
pleted, and (3) college completed or more than a college
education.
Because the ASOC survey oversampled adults age 60 years
and older by a factor of 1.8, weights were applied to the
data. The weight was the inverse of the sampling probabil-
ity, which was 1 if the respondent was younger than 60
and 1/1.8 if the participant was age 60 or older. In order
to retain the correct total number of survey respondents, a
final weighting variable was created by using the initial
weighting variable divided by the average weight for the
entire sample. This weighting factor was utilized in all
analyses to bring the study sample into alignment with
the target population.
Logistic regression models were created, with DM status
regressed on each psychosocial variable separately,
adjusted for sex, age, and obesity status. To assess for effect
modification, these models were then stratified by race,
ethnicity and gender, and interaction terms were also cre-
ated. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were cal-
culated for each factor.
The software program SPSS version 14.0 was used to man-
age data and conduct the analyses. The type I error rate
was set at the  =.05 level. This study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board at the University of Texas
Health Science Center at Houston.
Results
Five percent of the study population, or 131 participants,
reported a DM diagnosis. DM was more prevalent in Afri-
can Americans, obese participants, respondents over the
age of 60, and those who were either disabled or retired
from employment (Table 2). A higher sense of control
and a stronger social support system were inversely asso-
ciated with DM status.
The odds ratios for the effect of each psychosocial variable
regressed on DM status, adjusted for age, obesity status,
and socioeconomic position, are shown in Table 3. For
every one point increase in the sense of control scale (or a
stronger sense of control) the odds of having DM were
reduced by 33 percent (95% CI: 0.47­0.95). For every one
point increase in the social support scale (or a weaker
social support system), the odds of having DM increased
by 32 percent (95% CI: 0.93­1.89), although the CI indi-
cates that this point estimate is imprecise and results are
not statistically significant. Stratification by gender, race,
and ethnicity showed no evidence of effect modification.
Furthermore, interaction terms for these models were not
statistically significant (results not shown). We also found
no interaction between sense of control and social sup-
port.
Conclusion
Our findings show that, after adjusting for covariates, hav-
ing a strong sense of control was significantly protective

against DM. Few studies have previously examined these
psychosocial variables as independent correlates for DM.
More often, psychosocial factors have been investigated
among diabetics in the context of self-management. For
example, sense of control has been identified as a predic-
tor of metabolic control among diabetics [26,27], as has
social support [28]. DM-specific social support and self-
efficacy have been shown to correlate with an improved
health related quality of life [29]. Among those studies
that have considered psychosocial risk factors for DM, one
found effort-reward imbalance related to work environ-
ments to be associated with type 2 DM incidence among
men only [30]. In contrast, another study found an asso-
ciation between both low decision latitude at work and
low sense of coherence with type 2 DM only among
women [31].
A low sense of control may result in a compromised abil-
ity to deal with environmental or psychological stressors
[32]. In response to stress, the hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenal (HPA) axis secretes cortisol, an overabundance of
which may contribute to insulin resistance [33]. Addition-
ally, persons with a low sense of control may be less likely
to engage in healthy behavior.
Limitations of this study should be considered in inter-
preting the results. People without telephones were not
included in the ASOC survey, and it is likely that those

individuals would be of low socioeconomic position,
which is associated with DM [34]. In a study that exam-
ined the potential coverage bias in telephone surveys,
investigators who used data from the NHANES III found
that those respondents without a telephone were more
likely to be both obese and diabetic [35]. This selection
bias has the potential to underestimate the association
between psychosocial factors and DM.
Measurement of the outcome was based on respondents'
self-reports of DM status. In general, the prevalence of DM
in the ASOC study population (5%) is similar to estimates
based on self-report from both the National Health Inter-
view Survey and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
System [36,37]. Additionally, undiagnosed DM was not
assessed. One study that used laboratory testing to verify
DM diagnosis found the prevalence of undiagnosed DM
to be 2.7% [38]. This bias also has the potential to under-
estimate the associations of interest if the disease nega-
tively affects one's sense of control or ability to maintain
one's social contacts. It was also not possible to distin-
guish type I and type 2 DM in the ASOC survey. Although
they share some risk factors, type 1 and type 2 DM gener-
ally have different characteristics and courses. However,
because of the low prevalence of type 1 DM in the general
U.S. population (roughly 5%­10% of all DM) [7], and the
population-based nature of this study sample, the ambi-
guity of the type of DM is unlikely to bias the point esti-
mates. Finally, because this study utilized cross-sectional
data (and prevalence instead of incidence), no determina-
tions of causality are possible. Although it may be reason-
able to assume that adverse psychosocial factors are risks
for DM, it is also possible that the reverse is true. Future
research should include longitudinal studies to assess
temporality of the influence of psychosocial factors on the
incidence of DM. In addition, future research may focus
on diagnostic criteria, as opposed to self-reported preva-
lence, as evidence for DM. Distinguishing between levels
of received and perceived support with incidence of DM
might also provide valuable associations.
Over the last twenty years, DM has emerged as an epi-
demic in the United States [7]. It is estimated that the
number of adults in the U.S. with diagnosed DM (includ-
ing gestational DM) has risen 61% since 1991, and it is
further projected to at least double by the year 2050
[7,36]. The observed association of sense of control and
DM prevalence in this study is suggestive of the contribu-
tion of an adverse psychological environment in under-
standing the epidemiology of this condition and warrants
further investigation. Particular attention in future
research should be paid to the temporal nature of these
factors and the incidence of type 2 DM.
