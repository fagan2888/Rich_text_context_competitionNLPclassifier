Redneck Identity and Redneck Humor
Popular culture has aided the reworking of a redneck dis-
course that historically signified poor rural White southern-
ers (Jarosz & Lawson, 2002). Solidified by comedian Jeff
Foxworthy in the 1990s, the term redneck has been reinter-
preted as an identity salient to a mass audience (Hartigan,
1997). When redneck is used as a self-description or as a way
of indicating otherness, it becomes a means of establishing
identity boundaries. To expand research exploring the
nuances of whiteness, this article seeks to illuminate how,
and why, redneck identity is being constructed in this humor.
Specifically, I seek to address three interrelated questions.
Research Question 1: How is redneck defined according
to Foxworthy humor?
Research Question 2: How does this humor construct the
boundaries between the redneck and non-redneck?
Research Question 3: Do the boundaries utilized in this
humor help us understand the production and mainte-
nance of a more normative, mainstream whiteness?
To address these questions, I conducted a semiotics-
inspired narrative analysis of more than 300 Foxworthy red-
neck jokes derived from his comedy routine and posted on
the Internet site Country Humor (Foxworthy, 1991, 2004).
My analysis is organized around four broad themes that per-
meate these jokes: lifestyle and fashion, rural living, sex and
gender, and poverty. I explore the textual and social codes
used to define redneck identity and construct the boundaries
between the redneck and the non-redneck. I locate this proj-
ect within whiteness studies literature and conceptualize the
analysis via boundary theory and the notion of symbolic
pollution.
However, it is important to recognize that although
Foxworthy's redneck humor provides an important and
influential interpretation of redneck identity, I am not sug-
gesting that his humor should be viewed as the final, authori-
tative word on the issue. There are many facets to redneck
identity and the term has a long history. Indeed, although it
appears to have originated in the British Isles, the first known
recorded use of the term in the United States was in an 1830
travel book by A. Royall, titled Southern Tour (Goad, 1998;
Huber & Drowne, 2001; Webb, 2005). Royall used the term
redneck to describe a group of Presbyterians in Fayetteville,
North Carolina (Goad, 1998). By the 1890s, redneck was
broadly used to describe rural White laborers in theAmerican
south, as it had become associated with the effects of long
hours of laboring in the sun (Huber & Drowne, 2001;

Jeff Foxworthy's Redneck Humor
and the Boundaries of Middle-Class
American Whiteness
J. David Thomas1
Abstract
Recent studies examine the use of rhetorical boundaries to produce intra-racial othering within whiteness. I expand this
project by exploring the textual and social codes in Jeff Foxworthy humor that demarcate the boundaries between the
redneck and the non-redneck. Such boundaries are complex, porous fault-lines that use symbolic pollution embedded in
humor to stigmatize White outsiders. Social codes referencing symbolic pollution establish boundaries to define and insulate
a normative, mainstream White identity from the intra-racial threat of redneck identity. This project provides a novel
addition to whiteness studies by taking redneck humor analytically seriously and concludes by drawing comparisons between
codes found in Foxworthy humor and those levied against rural Whites during the eugenics era.

Roebuck & Hickson, 1982). The term might have also been
reinforced by a vitamin deficiency called pellagra, which
causes the neck and other parts of the body to redden.
Roebuck and Hickson (1982) state that rural southern Whites
frequently suffered from ill health due to poor diets and a
general lack of medical care. Pellagra was common through-
out the southern United States, especially in the 1930s, when
many believe that redneck became a nationally recognized
term (Eisiminger, 1984).
In states such as West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, south-
ern Illinois, and Indiana, the term redneck also became syn-
onymous with unionization and its radical politics (Huber,
1994). Rednecks would wear red bandanas around their
necks as a sign of solidarity, particularly while striking. The
term redneck was both embraced and used pejoratively to
describe members of the United Mine Workers of America,
as well as their rural background (Huber, 1994).
Redneck took on more currency in popular culture in the
1970s, particularly through the influence of country music.
With songs including Johnny Russell's Rednecks, White
Socks and Blue Ribbon Beer, the Bellamy Brothers Redneck
Girl, and David Allen Coe's Longhaired Redneck, it entered
America's popular lexicon and began to transcend its asso-
ciation with a strictly southern rurality. When Foxworthy's
redneck humor first arrived in the early 1990s, redneck was
a nationally recognized term, and this humor has no doubt
had a significant impact on reshaping its meaning in the pop-
ular imagination. It is explicitly to that end that this article is
focused. What kind of redneck is being constructed in this
humor? What identity boundaries are being negotiated, and
does this speak to mainstream whiteness?
Whiteness, Boundary Theory, and
Symbolic Pollution
Whiteness studies are designed to exam and expose the "ter-
ritory of white" to bring it under critical analysis (Ignatiev &
Garvey, 1996; Jacobson, 1999; Lipsitz, 1998, 2011; Painter,
2010; Perkinson, 2004; Roediger, 1991, 2006). The rapid
growth of whiteness studies and the sheer number of disci-
plines impacted has been remarkable. Arnesen (2001) argues
that "few branches of the humanities and social sciences
have escaped the increasing gravitational pull of `whiteness
studies'" (p. 4). The study of whiteness has been dominated
by the "systemic racism camp," which focuses on the role of
power and structural inequality (Foster, 2009; Roediger,
1991). The systemic racism camp associates White identity
predominantly with privilege and oppression (Harris, 1993;
Lucal, 1996; McIntosh, 1989; Pence & Fields, 1999;
Wiegman, 1999). Perhaps, the most ambitious analysis of
whiteness in this tradition is Painter's (2010) tome The
History of White People. Painter (2010) ultimately roots the
origins of whiteness--and by extension the "white race"--in
the labels and perceptions of social elites, yet acknowledges
the socially situational nuances of whiteness, particularly
through how it has been impacted by class and gender. One
of the fundamental assumptions of whiteness studies is that
White racial identity and its associated privileges are largely
invisible, particularly to White individuals. As Perkinson
(2004) states, "White America is largely unconscious and
mute, unable to address the question of its identity as white.
Power does not normally have to give an account of its own
basis of operation" (p. 1). As such, exploring White identity
and exposing White privilege serves as foundational theo-
retical concerns in this field. Perkinson (2004) notes that
such exposure must occur on multiple levels--from the
operation of structural privilege, to the organization of cul-
tural habit, to the face-to-face politics of personal power.
With this focus on power and privilege, whiteness does not
represent a color as much as it represents a condition " . . . a
structured advantage that channels unfair gains and unjust
enrichments to whites . . . " (Lipsitz, 2011, p. 3).
Of course, whiteness studies are not without critics. The
most well-known critique of whiteness studies comes from
historian Eric Arnesen (2001). Arnesen argues that whiteness
studies scholars in general, and labor historians working
within the framework of whiteness studies in particular,
engage in serious methodological and conceptual flaws--
particularly conceptual inflation, conceptual substitution,
and analytical overreach (Arnesen, 2001). Arnesen argues
that whiteness studies scholars inaccurately equate whiteness
with White supremacy, but that the two concepts are not nec-
essarily equivalent. Arnesen (2001) worries that whiteness
studies scholars " . . . reduce a complex, many faceted racial-
ization process to the matter of `becoming white'" (p. 17).
However, the claim that whiteness studies scholars are over-
simplifying a complex process is not a fair or accurate accu-
sation, for exploring complexity and nuance in racial identity
is a significant feature of whiteness studies. Jacobson (1999)
perhaps put it best when he noted,
The contest over whiteness--its definition, its internal
hierarchies, its proper boundaries, and its rightful claimants--
has been critical to American culture throughout the nation's
history, and it has been a fairly untidy affair. (p. 5)
One of the many interesting discoveries of whiteness
studies scholars is the historical flexibility of White racial
identity. For example, throughout much of U.S. history,
many light-skinned immigrants of eastern and southern
European descent, the Irish, and even poor rural Whites,
were often not viewed as fully White and did not always
receive the benefits of whiteness (Painter, 2010). Roediger
(2006) notes how in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
southern and eastern European immigrants in particular were
frequently racialized as "in-between" peoples; they neither
experienced the full racism of people of color, nor experi-
ence full inclusion as White Americans. Yet, many scholars
have concluded that the epistemological and ontological
Thomas 3
assumptions of the systemic racism camp in whiteness stud-
ies have greatly limited the study of White identity (Ching &
Creed, 1997; Eichstedt, 2001; Giroux, 1997; Winders, 2003).
Recent work within a stricter social constructionist tradition
has challenged the systemic racism camp for its tendency to
reify and essentialize whiteness (Bonnett, 1998; Eichstedt,
2001; Foster, 2009; Jarosz & Lawson, 2002; Trainor, 2002;
Weis & Lombardo, 2002). Twine and Gallagher (2007) argue
that whiteness studies are moving toward a "third wave,"
seeking to unify salient aspects of both the systemic racism
and constructionist approach. They state,
While whiteness often is synonymous with regimes of terror,
genocide and white supremacy, a third wave perspective on
whiteness rejects the implicit assumption that whiteness is
only an unconditional, universal and equally experienced
location of privilege and power. (Twine & Gallagher, 2007,
p. 7)
A core conceptual distinction between the systemic and
constructionist approach centers on the boundaries of White
identity. In the systemic approach, whiteness is believed to
be primarily or even exclusively established through a con-
frontation with blackness (Ignatiev & Garvey, 1996; Lipsitz,
2011; Perkinson, 2004). However, many constructionists are
now exploring how factors such as geographic region, gen-
der, and socio-economic status establish gradations within
White identity. For example, the labels White trash and hill-
billy highlight the stratified social terrain of White identity
by illustrating a tradition of contempt and intra-racial other-
ing (Harkins, 2004; Hartigan, 2005, 1997; Mason, 2005;
Wilson, 2002; Winders, 2003). By analyzing how these
labels are used to mark certain White identities as Other even
as they remain White as such, we can broaden our conceptual
understanding of the formation and maintenance of White
identity. It is precisely this process of intra-racial othering
that this article seeks to explore through the boundaries con-
structed in this humor.
In the redneck humor of Jeff Foxworthy, certain Whites
are marked as Other through the use of symbolic pollution.
Max Weber (1946) was the first prominent social theorist to
note how individuals occupying lower statuses are often per-
ceived as dirty and that interacting with members from lower
status groups can lead to impurity. However, Mary Douglas
(1990) was the first theorist to explore thoroughly the sym-
bolic construction and use of the concept "dirt." Douglas
(1990) argues,
If we can abstract pathogenicity and hygiene from our notion of
dirt, we are left with the old definition of dirt as a matter out of
place . . . It implies two conditions: a set of ordered relations and
a contravention of that order . . . This idea of dirt takes us straight
into the field of symbolism and promises a link-up of symbolic
systems of purity . . . In short, our pollution behavior is the
reaction which condemns any object or idea likely to confuse or
contradict cherished classifications. (p. 155)
Because the notion of social disorder is important for
understanding symbolic pollution, the application of sym-
bolic pollution to a social group implies their challenge to
some normative aspect of that social order (Bean, 1981;
Douglas, 1966, 1990). As Smith-Rosenberg (1990) argues,
"People who hold dangerously ambiguous roles are seen
as antisocial: `dirt, obscenity, and lawlessness' character-
ize them" (p. 165). I contend that redneck identity is a
dangerously ambiguous identity because it is a low status
identity occupied by Whites. This ambiguity poses an
intra-racial threat because it challenges important assump-
tions and beliefs related to normative whiteness, including
White supremacy, American individualism, and meritoc-
racy. Beliefs and values about dirt, garbage, or trash are
consistently used to make claims and counter-claims
about the character of one's status and identity (Douglas,
1966; Hartigan, 2005), and thus, the accusation of being
dirty is " . . . itself a weapon" for clarifying and strength-
ening social structure (Douglas, 1966, p. 107). Redneck
identity is associated with symbolic pollution because it
stands outside of conventional whiteness and, thus, threat-
ens cherished concepts important to mainstream White
identity. In the course of this intra-racial othering, sym-
bolic pollution becomes the principal means of establish-
ing boundaries between us/them, and in the process
racializes the White Other via similar mechanisms used to
racialize minorities (Jarosz & Lawson, 2002). In this
unique contribution to the study of redneck identity and
White intra-racial othering, I argue below that it is through
frequent reference to symbolic pollution that Foxworthy
humor actually constructs a particular type of pop culture
redneck identity. Through this analysis, I will locate these
references to symbolic pollution and explore what they
mean for the construction of contemporary redneck iden-
tity as well as whiteness.
Data and Method
The data consist of Foxworthy redneck jokes posted on the
website Country Humor. Jeff Foxworthy released the com-
edy album You Might Be a Redneck If . . . in 1993, ushering
in a new era for the social construction of redneck identity.
Foxworthy and Foxworthy-inspired redneck humor are cul-
tural narratives articulating norms, values, beliefs, and life-
styles about this identity (Foxworthy, 1991, 2004). With
material spanning over 25 years, Foxworthy has become the
largest selling comedy recording artist in history. At the time
of this analysis, Country Humor had 300 of Foxworthy's You
Might Be a Redneck If jokes derived from his stand-up and
printed material. I employed narrative analysis and incorpo-
rated semiotic concepts to give denotative and connotative
readings of these jokes, exploring both literal, "common
sense" references in this humor as well as the humor's more
symbolic meanings. My denotative and connotative readings
explore specific codes embedded in these jokes.
4 SAGE Open
Communication is in part composed of employing and
interpreting culturally available codes (Barker, 2003;
Chandler, 2002). Codes serve as a key, or set of instructions,
for translating a message (Barthes & Duisit, 1975; Chandler,
2002; Jameson, 1977; White & Taket, 2000). They often take
the form of binary oppositions that structure both the prag-
matic use and symbolic meaning of language (Chandler,
2002). Codes help simplify phenomena to make it easier to
communicate experiences (Gombrich, 1982). Although
codes might not directly determine the meaning of a text,
they do constrain meaning so as to push for a preferred read-
ing (Hall, 1980). Different types of codes can be important
for different levels of analysis (Merrill, 2007). Indeed, most
texts have a multitude of interacting codes, and analysis
often involves considering these codes and their inter-rela-
tionships (Jakobson, 1971).
One type of code is the textual code (Chandler, 2002).
Textual codes help to facilitate literary or communicative tra-
ditions. For example, some textual codes that can help struc-
ture the narrative genre include destinator/receiver, subject/
object, and assistant/traitors (White & Taket, 2000). While
textual codes can provide structure so as to conform to a par-
ticular genre, the text might also contain other codes that
reflect the narrator's cultural values, attitudes, beliefs,
assumptions, and practices. These codes can be referred to as
social codes (Chandler, 2002). Social codes convey bodily,
behavioral, verbal, and commodity-based dimensions of
social life (Chandler, 2002). Hence, textual codes are more
specific to genre structure, whereas social codes communi-
cate broader aspects of collective existence.
Textual and social codes help inform this analysis in two
ways. First, I focus on the textual code subject/object because
this is a fundamental component of Foxworthy's redneck
humor. The code subject/object is essential to understanding
what does and does not constitute redneck identity in this
humor. Also, this code is important because it highlights how
Foxworthy jokes can be viewed as elementary narratives.
Narratives often follow an initial state  disruption  new
state sequence (Franzosi, 1998), and Foxworthy jokes unfold
in a similarly linear pattern. The typical structure of a
Foxworthy redneck joke is,
If you [pause] have a half-built truck engine in the front yard of
your trailer home [pause] you might be a redneck.
Therefore, you can be determined to be the subject, a half-
built truck engine in the front yard of your trailer home a
composite of social codes, and redneck the object. The humor-
ous message of the joke is partially predicated on the collapse
of the code subject/object. The initial state of the linear narra-
tive sequence is the absence of a redneck identity, which can
be viewed as the preferred state. The disruption occurs during
the gist of the joke, which presents a culturally compacted
image of redneck identity referencing one or more social
codes. The new state of the narrative is the association of
oneself, one's relatives, friends, acquaintances, or at least a
generalized other, with this new identity of redneck. When the
binary collapses, threatening either your or another associ-
ate's identity, the juxtaposition of incompatible ideas has
occurred and laughter ensues (Meyer, 2000).
Social codes referencing symbolic pollution (i.e., pollu-
tion codes) also provide important elements of the humor-
ous message. This particular type of social code is important
for understanding the cultural connotations found in this
humor. Pollution codes establish symbolic boundaries
between types of people. Such pollution codes often take
form in the binaries cleanliness/dirtiness, civilized/uncivi-
lized, ordered/unordered, moral/immoral, and others. For
example, the pollution code cleanliness/dirtiness is signi-
fied when a joke states that you might be a redneck if the
Salvation Army "declines your mattress." In this particular
example, the pollution code cleanliness/dirtiness is used to
construct redneck identity as dirty, and then, it becomes
associated with all the negative connotations such dirtiness
entails. Therefore, pollution codes specify the multitude of
ways in which status hierarchies are being implicitly con-
structed in redneck humor. These pollution codes generally
focus on one of two patterns: excess or inappropriate juxta-
position. These two patterns conform to what one would
expect concerning the nature of humor (Gross, 2007;
Lengbeyer, 2005; Shifman, 2007). Through the two pat-
terns of excess and incongruent juxtaposition, these pollu-
tion codes contaminate common systems of classification
in modern, mainstream, White American social life. As
illustrated below, the operation of these two patterns of
humor use divergent paths yet arrive at the same destina-
tion, the marking of redneck identity as a polluted identity
outside the realm of normative whiteness.
Analysis: Pollution Codes in Foxworthy
Redneck Humor
Through exploration of pollution codes implied in Foxworthy
redneck humor, this analysis illuminates but one way intra-
racial othering occurs within White identity formation. There
are four expansive themes permeating these jokes: lifestyle
and fashion, rural living, sex and gender, and poverty. These
themes and the pollution codes found therein are offered as
representative of the themes and pollution codes found
throughout this humor.
Lifestyle and Fashion
Foxworthy humor establishes boundaries to convey the char-
acter of redneck identity. This humor often employs cultural
and biological differences to separate rednecks from norma-
tive whiteness. Employing many pollution codes simultane-
ously, these codes intersect and fuse so that any one joke can
signify multiple means of pollution. Associating redneck
identity with lack of hygiene occurs in the jokes below in
Thomas 5
part through an association with the codes culture/nature,
cleanliness/dirtiness, and cultivated/trashy. As revealed in
these jokes, rednecks are constructed as prone to bodily
infestation by insects, animals, and/or diseases.
You might be a redneck if:
Chiggers are included on your list of top 5 hygiene concerns.
Birds are attracted to your beard.
You have ever bathed with flea and tick soap.
You think that Campho-Phenique is a miracle drug.
Because the human body is a key component of racialized
rhetoric, it is often a site of contention over definitions of
civilized/uncivilized (Hartigan, 2005). These particular jokes
take the culture/nature binary to the level of the physical
organism; the living body is constructed as the site that is
polluted. However, it is not simply nature's infestation of the
body that threatens the boundary between culture and nature.
We also see bodily excretions and waste threaten this bound-
ary. Human excrement is tabooed in all cultures because it
threatens the fundamental distinction between "me and not
me" (Keskpaik, 2001, p. 315). Urine, feces, grease, and spit-
tle emerge in this humor as human excretions associated with
redneck identity. We see these references as well as others in
the jokes below.
You might be a redneck if:
Someone in your family says "Cum'n heer an'lookit this afore I
flush it."
Exxon and Conoco have offered you royalties for your hair.
You use lava soap more than three times a day.
These jokes illustrate the intersection of pollution codes in
this humor. The association of rednecks with feces and
grease is clear in these jokes, thus connecting redneck
identity with human excretions. Yet, in the first joke, it is
not simply the reference to human excrement that identi-
fies the redneck, it is also the speech pattern. This speech
pattern intersects with those pollution codes associating
redneck identity with laziness, rusticity, and a lack of edu-
cation. We also see the intersection of human excretions, a
lack of education, and immorality in the jokes addressing
redneck tobacco use.
You might be a redneck if:
You keep a spit cup on the ironing board.
Your family reunion features a chewing tobacco spit-off.
You participate in the "who can spit tobacco the farthest"
contest.
Redman Chewing Tobacco sends you a Christmas card.
The focus on redneck spittle highlights the dirty, disgusting
behavior of redneck tobacco use. Instead of simply associat-
ing redneck tobacco use with secondhand smoke, the focus
on chew spotlights disgusting, tobacco-laden saliva. This
focus unifies human excretions with poor lifestyle choice,
irresponsibility, and immorality. Below, we also see a more
direct relationship between rednecks and dirt through jokes
portraying the unclean living conditions and habits of
rednecks.
You might be a redneck if:
You keep a can of RAID on the kitchen table.
The Salvation Army declines your mattress.
Going to the laundromat means cleaning out the back of the
truck.
You clean your fingernails with a stick.
You prefer car keys to Q-tips.
In these jokes we see dirty, pest-infested living conditions
intersecting with poor behavioral habits and lack of intelli-
gence, or at least common sense. Poor hygiene and squalid
living conditions stand in symbolic opposition to cleanliness,
which is associated with order, civilization, and morality
(Bean, 1981). Order, civilization, and morality are chal-
lenged by another stereotype that targets the moral fabric of
redneck identity: excessive alcohol use. The image of a
drunken and abusive redneck demonstrates how immorality
and excess serve as a central explanation for their misfor-
tune. In the jokes below the use of alcoholic imagery solidi-
fies the relationship between immorality and redneck
behavioral patterns.
You might be a redneck if:
You actually made a pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight with
Alan Jackson.
You're a lite beer drinker, because you start drinking when it
gets light.
You've ever parked a Camero in a tree.
You've ever put a six-pack in a casket right before they closed it.
The first joke in this set combines alcoholism with a domi-
nant theme: rurality. The lyrics of famous country musician
6 SAGE Open
Alan Jackson serves as a bridge between alcoholic excess
and rural Americans. In addition, the jokes discussing drink-
ing when it is light and getting into drinking and driving acci-
dents illustrate how this excessive, polluted behavior is a
lifestyle choice that can lead to dire consequences. The last
joke illustrates how this poor lifestyle choice then transitions
into an unsavory death ritual.
You might be a redneck if:
You can't take a bath because beer is iced down in your tub.
Jack Daniels makes your list of most admired people.
You ever got too drunk to fish.
Your beer can collection is considered a tourist attraction in
your home town.
The first joke in this set illustrates how alcohol interrupts
important purity rituals. The denotative reading is that the
redneck is unable to clean themselves; the beer is literally in
the way. A connotative reading can relate cleanliness to
purity, and the redneck's inability to bath symbolically refer-
ences how alcohol serves to pollute redneck identity. Yet, in
the jokes above, it is not simply the consumption of alcohol
that serves as a means of pollution; it is the association of
redneck identity with excessive alcohol use. It is not the con-
tent of the joke but rather the relationship between the con-
tent and a proclivity toward excessiveness that is key here.
The proclivity toward excessiveness proves to be a funda-
mental way of differentiating the redneck from the non-red-
neck in much of this humor. This supports Zuesse's (1974)
contention that it is gradations within categories rather than
between categories that often differentiates the socially
acceptable from the symbolically polluted.
Another example of this emphasis on gradations within
categories involves hunting and fishing. As per the jokes
below, it is not the act of hunting and fishing that marks one's
identity as redneck; it is taking behaviors associated with
hunting and fishing to bizarre extremes. An emphasis on
excess draws the recipient of the joke's attention to a lack of
self-control. A lack of self-control is associated with child-
ishness, primitiveness, and immorality and helps explain
why rednecks make poor lifestyle choices. Therefore, this
humor suggests that although a redneck/non-redneck might
engage in the same activity, redneck behaviors lack taste and
self-control.
You might be a redneck if:
You have the local taxidermist's number on speed dial.
You owe the taxidermist more than your annual income.
You've ever filled your deer tag on the golf course.
There is a stuffed possum anywhere in your house.
You own a homemade fur coat.
You'd rather catch bass than get some (if you can't guess . . . )
We also see the intersection of the pollution codes poor/rich,
pre-modern/modern, and virility/impotence in the jokes
above. To illustrate, rather than hunting for sport or hunting
big game, these jokes construct rednecks as hunting for util-
ity, such as producing clothing, or hunting small game for
decoration. Hunting for utility and hunting small game (rac-
coons, rabbits, possums) symbolically pollutes redneck iden-
tity by associating it with pre-modern living conditions,
poverty, and/or a lack of style. The third joke also confounds
civilized/uncivilized by implying that the redneck went hunt-
ing and shot a deer on a golf course, or was golfing, had a
gun, and shot a deer in the process. In either instance, the
collapse of the boundary between golf, which is traditionally
viewed as an upper-middle- or upper-class sport, and hunting
provides a key source of the humorous message. The sugges-
tion is that rednecks do not know how to support or maintain
important social boundaries--in this case, the boundary
between upper-class golf and hunting. In addition, the last
joke above draws redneck sexuality and virility into ques-
tion, a theme that will be explored later, after we take a closer
look at rurality.
Polluted Rural Spaces: Living in the Outskirts
In the code culture/nature, the rustic character of redneck
identity is directly connected with nature. This connection
locates redneck identity outside of civilization, as made
explicit in the following jokes.
You might be a redneck if:
Directions to your house include "Turn off the paved road."
Getting a package from your post office requires a full tank of
gas in the truck.
Rustics live "out" in the countryside, boondocks, boonies,
sticks, and so forth, rather than "in" the city (Ching &Creed,
1997). The association between the binary in/out and the
binary urban/rural draws our attention to the connection
between rusticity and outness. Living in figurative outness
is living external to the bounds of modern society, external
to contemporary cultural norms (Ching & Creed, 1997). In
the culture/nature binary, this humor uses nature as a means
of symbolic pollution. Yet, outside of this humor the reverse
is often true, where civilization is constructed as dirty or
corrupt and nature as pure or pristine. There is much schol-
arly work that deals with the ideological implications of
this binary for the American political system and public
policy (Davis, 1988; Dyer, 1987; Furedi, 2008; Haer, 1952;
Thomas 7
Knoke & Henry, 1977). However, this ideological battle
often misses some broader implications of the culture/
nature binary. Kaika (2004) notes how the struggle between
"good water" and "bad water" is analogous to the differ-
ence between "good nature" and "bad nature." Good water
is clean, processed, controlled, and commodified. Bad
water is dirty, gray, metabolized, non-processed, and non-
commodified. Bad water is found in rivers, streams, creeks,
rainwater, sewage, and so forth, and is understood as dele-
terious to the human body if consumed. Good water occurs
through a process of technological and cultural transforma-
tion. Good water is used for drinking, cleaning, swimming,
and religious services. Water is "good" after it has been
transformed by human technology and culture (Kaika,
2004). Likewise, only after nature has been transformed--
for example, from a dangerous wilderness to a national
park--does it provide enough safety and security to be
enjoyed as "pristine." Associating an identity with "good
nature" or "bad nature" is one means of marking status in
modernity (Kaika, 2004). Members of higher statuses might
enjoy "good nature" by going to a ski resort, or taking a
weekend fishing trip to a public or private lake. Good
nature is good because it has the semblance of order; it is
under the will and domain of humankind. However bad
nature is unwieldy and dangerous; it violates boundaries
and is void of culture.
In Foxworthy humor, the breakdown of the culture/nature
and order/disorder binaries also occurs through the break-
down of the inside and outside of the home. Living condi-
tions is a prominent means of associating redneck identity
with symbolic pollution. The jokes below highlight the dis-
tinction between culture/inside and nature/outside.
You might be a redneck if:
You have to go down to the creek to take a bath.
You have to go outside to get something `out of the fridge.'
The best way to keep things cold is to leave 'em in the shade.
Your classes at school were canceled because the path to the
restroom was flooded.
The unification of civilization with order and nature with dis-
order is most visible in jokes referencing the redneck home.
Kaika (2004) argues that "the idea of the house as a means of
separating the inside from the outside, nature from human
beings, the public from the private sphere, has existed since
antiquity" (p. 265). In the process of imbuing the home with
cultural and ideological meaning "nature" is extracted and
then selectively allowed back in after being produced, puri-
fied, and commodified (Kaika, 2004). In Foxworthy humor,
the breakdown of the binaries inside/outside and culture/
nature serves to pollute redneck identity.
You might be a redneck if:
You've ever raked leaves in your kitchen.
You've ever used a weedeater indoors.
Going to the bathroom at night involves shoes and a flashlight.
You have flowers planted in a bathroom appliance in your front
yard.
This binary culture/nature, and rurality more broadly, also
serves as an important explanation for another commonly
assumed redneck characteristic: racism.
You might be a redneck if:
There is a sheet hanging in your closet and a gun rack hanging
in your truck.
Jarosz and Lawson (2002) argue that middle-class Whites
associate extreme forms of racism with rural Whites in an
attempt to free themselves from being implicated in institu-
tional racism. By insisting that racism is a core quality of
rednecks, middle-class Whites disassociate themselves from
racism by locating it in the primitive and pre-modern aspects
of White American culture. This reinforces the notion that
racism is only a problem because of a particular kind of
White identity. Therefore, rednecks free normative middle-
class whiteness of its complicity in racist practices (Jarosz &
Lawson, 2002). Moreover, the lack of education, being pre-
modern, a primitive lifestyle and ensuing racist sentiments
all intersect with an association to southern regionalism.
You might be a redneck if:
You are still holding onto Confederate money because you think
the South will rise again.
You have started a petition to change the national anthem to
"Georgia on My Mind."
More than one living relative is named after a Southern Civil
War general.
The construction of redneck identity as pre-modern, rustic,
out-of-touch, and often racist and regionalist creates a pol-
luted identity that establishes boundaries for a more main-
stream White identity. Yet, although the racist and regionalist
sentiments associated with redneck identity help quell a
more normative whiteness's complicity in racist practices,
there is perhaps no better theme that illustrates the construc-
tion of degenerate whiteness than themes involving sexual
and gender taboo. I now explore how taboo sexual and gen-
der behavior represents a major dimension of regressive
whiteness in this humor.
8 SAGE Open
Polluted Sexual and Gendered Practices
Taboos are important means of boundary work, giving form
to formlessness and explicitly delineating the divine from
the human elements of social life (Levine, 1986; Zuesse,
1974). Taboo sexual behavior is particularly threatening to
multiple culturally valued boundaries (Davies, 1982). In
popular culture, rustic sexual expression often takes the
form of homosexual rape, incest, or bestiality (Ching &
Creed, 1997). In this humor, homosexual rape manifests in
reference to the 1972 film Deliverance. Hartigan (2005)
argues that the film Deliverance unfolds in a narrational
tension between nature and culture. In one particular scene,
the viewer witnesses the homosexual rape of one of the
main characters. The rape was committed by one of several
poor, rural Whites, all of whom were carrying firearms.
Below, this homosexual rape reemerges to serve the pur-
pose of polluting redneck identity.
You might be a redneck if:
You think the mountain men in Deliverance were just
"misunderstood."
This particular joke also seems to poke fun at political cor-
rectness. Stating that the mountain men were simply misun-
derstood, combined with quotations indicating irony,
suggests a sarcastic play on the notions of cultural relativ-
ism and/or cultural sensitivity. Such irony is often meant to
imply the opposite: that, this violent, homosexual rape is
indicative of something more essential, be it cultural, or
individual pathology. However, incest is a much more prev-
alent taboo in this humor than is homosexual rape. In popu-
lar culture, incest is understood as typical redneck behavior
and, therefore, rednecks are perceived as coming from a
gene puddle instead of a gene pool (Goad, 1998). Indeed,
incest serves as a key biological explanation for why red-
neck identity fails to conform to the standards of a more
normative whiteness, and this biological explanation is one
of the most transparent ways redneck identity is racialized.
Following this tradition of racialization through an empha-
sis on incest, sexuality is constructed as a "family affair" in
this humor.
You might be a redneck if:
You view the next family reunion as a chance to meet girls.
You can't get married to your sweetheart because there is a law
against it.
You stand under the mistletoe at Christmas and wait for Granny
and cousin Sue-Ellen to walk by.
You go Christmas shopping for your mom, sister, and girlfriend,
and you only need to buy one gift.
These jokes suggest not only do rednecks freely engage in
incestuous relations but also such relationships are common,
culturally acceptable, and even expected. By transgressing
the incest taboo, the redneck is violating both the under-
standing of what helps make one human as well as what
helps connect humans to the divine (Levine, 1986; Zuesse,
1974). In this way, the actual sex act is one means of pollu-
tion, its outcome (inbred offspring) is another means of pol-
lution, and the culture that supports this behavior is perceived
as dysfunctional, degenerate, and immoral.
You might be a redneck if:
Your brother-in-law is also your uncle.
Your family tree doesn't have any branches.
Your gene pool doesn't have a "deep end."
You dated your daddy's current wife in high school.
You have to scratch your sister's name out of the message: "for
a good time call . . . because you feel guilty about putting it
there."
The use of incestuous relationships as a means of polluting
redneck identity offers a much-needed explanation for the
very existence of such an identity. Why are there White peo-
ple who are poor and live in rural areas? Why are they not
moving out of these areas and out of poverty? Their very exis-
tence challenges the legitimacy of American meritocracy.
Their inability to conform to White middle-class norms
demands explanation and incest offers a powerful one. This
biological explanation conferring genetic weakness combines
to reinforce, and be reinforced by, poor behavior and lack of
self-control to explain the existence of such an identity.
Another common theme concerning redneck sexual
behavior is a lack of male romance and chivalry. As Davies
(1982) notes, the strength of taboos often lies less in content
than in structure, in the separation of categories and in the
keeping apart of like and unlike elements. While associating
redneck sexuality with homosexual rape or incest is more
extreme than lack of male romance or chivalry, it is still used
as a means of polluting redneck identity. Male sexual behav-
ior and mating patterns are constructed as uncultivated,
insufficiently romantic, and trashy.
You might be a redneck if:
Your idea of talking during sex is "Ain't no cars coming, baby!"
After making love you ask your date to roll down the window.
"Honey? Are the lights out? Is the door locked? Is the parking
brake set?" is what you hear right before you and your wife/girl
make love.
Thomas 9
These jokes pollute redneck identity by attacking their chiv-
alry toward their partners. Courting and romance can be seen
as an important means of separating the civilized man from
the primitive man. Such jokes imply that rednecks are not
really "men" because they lack the desire, the means, or the
knowledge to properly court their partners or engage in
romantic love making. Attacking the romantic virtue of
"primitive males" has deep historical roots. For example,
African American male sexuality was constructed as primi-
tive and lacking in chivalrous virtue by the antebellum south-
ern aristocracy (Bay, 2000). Considering the historical
association of the term redneck with the American south,
such jokes might reflect deeply embedded attitudes that
established boundaries between southern gentlemen and
unrefined rednecks.
Nonetheless, in contemporary popular culture, redneck
identity is also understood as a traditional and masculine
identity. The masculinity of redneck identity often intersects
with alcoholism, an abusive disposition toward women, and
the support of traditional gender roles.
You might be a redneck if:
You think "loading the dishwasher" means getting your wife
drunk.
In this humor, masculinity is more often constructed as a
characteristic of redneck women. Redneck women are con-
structed as grossly masculine and lacking in feminine virtue.
Indeed, rather than focusing on redneck identity as a means
of enforcing traditional gender roles, most jokes focus on
how the feminine is polluted by the masculine in redneck
identity. Femininity is polluted by constructing the wife as a
manual laborer, as well as through behavior traditionally
viewed as unbecoming of women.
You might be a redneck if:
Your wife can climb a tree faster than your cat.
Your wife wants to stop at the gas station to see if they've got the
new Darrell Waltrip Budweiser wall clock.
Your wife's best pair of shoes is steel-toed Red Wings.
Your wife's job requires her to wear an orange vest.
Symbolic pollution is often associated with mundane, physi-
cal work, and materiality (Bean, 1981). These last two jokes
specifically focus on how being working class and working
in manual labor pollutes the feminine in redneck identity.
These jokes expressly address "your wife," and then associ-
ate "your wife" with a masculine trait. Therefore, you know
you might be a redneck if "your wife" possesses overtly mas-
culine, working class traits. Consequently, this humor uses
"symbolic touching" (Levine, 1986, p. 982) to pollute male
redneck identity by associating it with redneck femininity. In
addition, while working class manual labor pollutes redneck
femininity, so does an association with what is beautiful ver-
sus what is ugly. Polluted appearances are unattractive and
tacky. Because redneck identity is a polluted identity, and
redneck femininity is polluted by working class masculinity,
then redneck women are, through symbolic touching,
unattractive.
You might be a redneck if:
Your wife's hairdo has ever been ruined by a ceiling fan.
Your wife weighs more than your refrigerator.
Your wife has a beer belly and you find it attractive.
The lack of self-discipline and being old fashioned are also
sources of pollution. The first joke establishes a sense of the
redneck woman's "big hair," an old fashioned hairstyle taken
to an extreme in this particular joke. Likewise, in the second
joke all the cultural stereotypes associated with being over-
weight serve to pollute redneck women, such as being lazy,
lacking self-discipline, and being immoral. Also, the last
joke in this set offers a good example of how most jokes
targeting redneck women are often still geared toward a male
audience. It is not just that your wife has a beer belly--a
stereotypically male phenomenon, and that the belly pollutes
her identity. It is also that you find it attractive. In other
words, feminine identity being polluted by masculine iden-
tity is not the only pollution code. It is also polluting those
men who choose such women, and it is often the men who
are the primary targets of the joke. Therefore, the impact of
these pollution codes is dependent upon a firm dichotomy
between man/woman and masculine/feminine. Any acts or
characteristics that threaten these binaries are a menace to
culturally valued boundaries, and thus, can serve as possible
sites of pollution.
Another means of polluting redneck femininity with mas-
culine traits is by associating redneck femininity with
tobacco use and alcoholism.
You might be a redneck if:
Your mom gives you tips on how to sneak booze into sporting
events.
Your mother doesn't remove the Marlboro from her lips before
telling the State Trooper to kiss her ass.
Your mother keeps a spit cup on the ironing board.
The tobacco chewers in your family aren't just men.
Such jokes challenge redneck femininity by associating red-
neck women with two characteristics that strongly define
10 SAGE Open
redneck masculinity: alcohol and tobacco use. Yet, these
jokes also pollute redneck femininity by implicitly challeng-
ing the redneck woman's ability to perform a most cherished
traditional cultural role, that of mother. Tobacco and alcohol
are not only a masculine redneck trait, excessive alcohol and
tobacco use are seen as immoral regardless of one's gender.
The sneaking of alcohol into sporting events implies a dispo-
sition toward criminality, drunkenness, or both. Likewise,
the three jokes discussing tobacco use also entail an uncouth
disposition and criminality. Such jokes imply that masculin-
ity is not the only danger associated with redneck femininity.
Redneck femininity is also dangerous to a man's ability to
form and/or maintain a wholesome family life. And, this
highlights an interesting component of Foxworthy's redneck
humor that I would like to make explicit: namely, the unspo-
ken gender scripts related to work and family life. This
humor operates with restrictive and traditional gender role
assumptions. It is essentialist, as the masculine/feminine
exists as an innate, natural binary. This humor is predicated
on the notion that femininity is inherently soft and emotive.
It presupposes the existence of clear boundaries and scripts
that are rooted in very traditional and conservative percep-
tions of gender. These traditional and conservative percep-
tions might reflect the educational distance and class-based
assumptions of redneck and mainstream whiteness, because
it is through their working class jobs, alcohol and tobacco
use, and comfort or embrace of violence, that redneck women
transgress acceptable gendered boundaries. As such, the
transgression of these boundaries not only pollutes their
identity but also pollutes the identities of those redneck
males associated with them.
Last, I conclude this analysis of Foxworthy redneck jokes
by exploring how poverty, education, and status intertwine
and serve as a primary means of polluting redneck identity.
The Pollution of Poverty
Trash is related to poverty both literally and figuratively.
Trash is related to poverty literally because poverty often
forces people to exploit what others have discarded as
"trash." Poverty is figuratively associated with trash through
labels such as White trash and other rhetorical means of sym-
bolic pollution. Trash is physically relocated to the periphery
of civilization, marking the boundary where civilization ends
and nature begins (Keskpaik, 2001). Similarly, by associat-
ing redneck identity with literal and figurative trash, red-
necks are symbolically removed from mainstream culture.
You might be a redneck if:
Your coffee table used to be a cable spool.
Your stereo speakers used to belong to the Drive-in Theater.
You come home from the garbage dump with more than you went
with.
You buy your wife tube socks at the flea market.
You think "taking out the trash" means taking your in-laws to a
movie.
In the first four jokes above, we see how the boundary
between literal and figurative trash often breaks down in
social practice. The first three jokes connect redneck identity
with literal trash, things that have been discarded. The first
two jokes can also be read in reference to immoral and/or
criminal behavior, because the cable spool and speakers
might have been stolen. The connection between redneck
identity and literal trash also associates redneck identity with
figurative trash. The transition from literal to figurative trash
is complete in the last joke relating trash to "in-laws."
Things that are socially and symbolically "discarded" are
also "physically relocated" (Keskpaik, 2001, p. 321).
Material objects that are physically relocated to special sites
become trash. For example, the placement of a computer
next to a garbage bin designates that computer, no matter
how new or functional, as "trash," again highlighting how
pollution leads to infection through contact (Levine, 1986).
Trash is on the periphery, and similarly trailer parks are on
the periphery of American culture. The trailer park, as a
social code, is so polluted that U.S. culture has a unique term
for individuals who live in trailer homes: trailer trash. The
jokes below show how redneck identity is polluted by an
association with trailers and trailer trash.
You might be a redneck if:
Yer mom calls ya over t'help, cause she has a flat tire . . . on her
house.
You own a home that is mobile and 5 cars that aren't.
You replace a flat tire on your truck with a tire from your house.
Your home has more miles on it than your car.
Your richest relative invites you over to his new home to help
him remove the wheels and skirt.
The theme emphasized in these particular jokes is the dichot-
omy between home and mobility. Because trailer trash live in
"mobile" homes, they lack roots in community, and hence
are placeless. The mobile home replaces having deep roots in
a community with being a vagabond or tramp. In the jokes
above, we also see the juxtaposition of mobile homes and
broken down vehicles. The cultural image of the redneck
lawn littered with broken down vehicles is a powerful one.
Trash marks the external boundaries of culture (Keskpaik,
2001) and the association between redneck identity and trash
often occurs through this focus on the state and character of
redneck vehicles. We see the connection between redneck
identity and trash more explicitly in the jokes below through
the direct focus on the pitiful state of redneck vehicles.
Thomas 11
You might be a redneck if:
There are four or more cars up on blocks in the front yard.
Fewer than half of your cars run.
You have a rag for a gas cap (on a car that does not run).
You have a color coordinating rope that ties down your car
hood.
This literal and figurative association makes special sense
considering the impact automobiles have had on American
culture over the course of the 20th century. Automobiles are
symbols ofAmerican freedom and individuality, and the type
and state of one's vehicle can be viewed as a status symbol.
For the redneck, the automobile serves as a prime example of
their polluted, lowly status.
You might be a redneck if:
The blue book value of your truck goes up and down depending
on how much gas it has in it.
The taillight covers of your car are made of red tape.
Your vehicle has a two-tone paint job--primer red and primer
gray.
You have a Hefty bag on the passenger side window of your car.
The image of the redneck trailer home on the outskirts of
town and physically resembling a junk yard uses two impor-
tant American cultural symbols, the automobile and the
home, as a means of polluting redneck identity. This utilizes
the often porous boundary between literal and figurative
trash, and in the process establishes a polluted identity that
conflates poverty with lifestyle choice, laziness, and immo-
rality. This conflation marks redneck identity as a low status.
Yet, some jokes deal specifically with status by focusing on
the boundary between high culture and low culture, and con-
necting redneck identity with low culture. The low status of
redneck identity is explained in part by cultural primitive-
ness. The redneck's lack of cultural refinement speaks
directly to their low social status as they are constructed as
having base interests and base cultural knowledge. These
particular jokes highlight how rednecks lack economic,
social, and cultural capital. Redneck cultural knowledge is
understood as limited, base, and inadequate. The jokes below
are structured with an explicit schism between high culture
and low culture.
You might be a redneck if:
You consider pork and beans to be a gourmet food.
You think a turtleneck is a key ingredient for soup.
You think the French Riviera is a foreign car.
You think that Dom Perignon is a mafia leader.
You consider a six-pack and a bug-zapper high-quality
entertainment.
In these jokes, the juxtaposition of incongruent cultural
objects or knowledge is used to elicit humor. Cultural objects
such as turtlenecks or Dom Perignon are falsely associated
with food and people. These jokes reinforce the claim that
status is associated with bodily dimensions (Elis, 1994;
Hartigan, 2005) because redneck cultural knowledge is con-
structed as base knowledge, related to food, the human body,
and generally vulgar entertainment. This is not surprising
considering that tabooed behavior frequently clusters around
base activities that are "most in need of `culturizing' and
humanizing" (Zuesse, 1974, p. 493).
Redneck poverty is also explained by lack of education,
which is often associated with the lack of innate intelligence.
Redneck breeding patterns are seen as having created an
identity that lacks a "genetic deep end." "Bad breeding" has
been a consistent theme explaining rural White poverty since
the eugenics era at the turn of the 20th century (Hartigan,
2005; Wray, 2006). Through a focus on genetic deficiency
and bad breeding, redneck identity moves away from an
individual lifestyle choice and instead becomes a reflection
of broader systemic degeneracy based in family structure,
family behavior, and biology. The jokes below touch upon
themes of degenerate family structure and irresponsible fam-
ily behavior.
You might be a redneck if:
The most commonly heard phrase at your family reunion is
"What the hell are you looking at, Shithead?"
You were shooting pool when any of your kids were born.
Your Junior/Senior Prom had a Daycare.
You've ever climbed a water tower with a bucket of paint to
defend your sister's honor.
The lack of innate intelligence and educational attainment is
constructed as a cause and consequence of redneck degen-
eracy. Genetic inbreeding and limited education become
confounding factors that explain both why redneck identity
exists and how it is fundamentally different from a more nor-
mative, mainstream whiteness. For example,
You might be a redneck if:
Your dad walks you to school because you're in the same
grade.
You think a subdivision is part of a math problem.
12 SAGE Open
You think the stock market has a fence around it.
The fifth grade is referred to as "your senior year."
During your senior year you and your mother had homeroom
together.
Idiocy--rooted in an innate deficiency and a lack of educa-
tional attainment--is the common theme in this humor. This
lack of intelligence and common sense produces and then is
reinforced by poor parenting skills on the part of both red-
neck mother and father. As explored in the previous section,
the redneck woman is constructed as a danger to the tradi-
tional family because she is overly masculine, uses alcohol
and tobacco, is potentially violent and/or criminal, and lacks
acceptable parenting skills. We see such themes recurring in
jokes more specifically targeting redneck parenting skills.
You might be a redneck if:
Your kids take a siphon hose to "Show and Tell."
Your kids are going hungry tonight because you just had to have
those Yosemite Sam mudflaps.
Your father encourages you to quit school because Larry has an
opening on the lube rack.
Redneck degeneracy is understood as the natural outcome
of limited parenting skills, intelligence, and education, cou-
pled with cultural primitiveness and baseness. This in turn
justifies the low status and poverty associated with redneck
identity. The social construction of rural Whites as degener-
ate is not a new phenomenon. Many of the pollution codes in
this humor that are used to construct the image of the degen-
erate redneck are similar to the pollution codes used to con-
struct the image of the dangerous rural White during the
eugenics era. This stigmatized identity was infused into
mainstream White understanding of the rural White Other.
Discussion
I have offered a semiotics-inspired narrative analysis of the
social construction of rednecks in Foxworthy and Foxworthy-
inspired humor. I conducted this narrative analysis with a
focus on three interrelated research questions. First, how is
this concept redneck defined according to this humor?
Second, in the process of defining redneck identity, how are
the boundaries between redneck/non-redneck being negoti-
ated? Last, does the rhetorical boundary redneck help us
understand the production and maintenance of normative,
mainstream whiteness? This humor uses pollution codes to
construct redneck identity as degenerate and primitive.
Pollution codes such as cleanliness/dirtiness, civilized/
uncivilized, ordered/unordered, and moral/immoral establish
the boundaries necessary to articulate how rednecks exist on
the "outside," in conflict with mainstream, White American
middle-class identity. The boundary between the redneck
and the non-redneck is at times a complex, porous fault-line
that defines a normative whiteness by using pollution codes
to stigmatize White outsiders through the use of humor. By
constructing this boundary between the redneck/non-redneck
and marking redneck identity as polluted this more norma-
tive, mainstream whiteness is insulated and protected from
intra-racial threats. For example, the very existence of poor
rural Whites threatens any lingering attitudes of White
supremacy, and therefore, these poor rural Whites must be
accounted for and their social condition justified. Likewise, a
persistent underclass of poor rural Whites challenge cher-
ished notions of American individualism and meritocracy,
and therefore, the existence of a persistent underclass must
be explained away with behavioral or biological factors.
Finally, enduring institutional racism also threatensAmerican
individualism and meritocracy, and therefore, redneck iden-
tity serves as a necessary scapegoat for many Whites who try
to reconcile a "color-blind" society (Bonilla-Silva, 2003)
with the continuing existence of racism in the United States.
In the end, the most striking and profound means of pol-
luting redneck identity in this humor comes by way of the
code culture/nature.
The line demarcating culture/nature, and the association
of poor rural Whites with nature, is an old association. For
example, a series of studies in the early 20th century by the
U.S. Eugenics Records Office (ERO) sought to demonstrate
scientifically that a large number of rural Whites were genet-
ically defective (Wray & Newitz, 1997). This eugenics
movement was perhaps the most influential outgrowth of
Social Darwinism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries
and greatly influenced social policy and popular attitudes
(McReynolds, 1997; Rafter, 1992). Family names such as
"The Jukes" and "The Kallikaks" entered popular culture to
illustrate the poor, dirty, alcoholic, and criminally and sexu-
ally perverse nature of many rural people (Wray & Newitz,
1997; Rafter, 1992). Eugenics ideology at the turn of the 20th
century interpreted the White underclass as either a direct
revolt against, or simply the lack of, civilization (Hartigan,
2005; Wray, 2006). While focusing on the presumed genetic
deficiencies of rural society they supported "aggressive
interventions to stop further declines in the quantity and
quality of rural people" (McReynolds, 1997, p. 300). In
eugenics ideology, the concept of biological "fitness" was
associated with class and status distinctions, so that poor
gene pool quality created a discernable qualitative difference
between urban and rural people (McReynolds, 1997, pp.
306-307). The eugenics movement was modernist and urban,
and the White underclass represented a racial poison threat-
ening both the purity of the White race as well as modernity
itself (Hartigan, 2005). Stereotypes of rural poor Whites as
incestuous and sexually promiscuous, violent, alcoholic,
lazy, and stupid remain to this day (Wray & Newitz, 1997, p.
2). While during the eugenics era the degeneracy of poor
Thomas 13
rural Whites threatened the legitimacy of White supremacy
and the perceived future of the White race, today poor rural
Whites continue to serve as instruments in the construction
of a mainstream, middle-class whiteness. Today, redneck
humor is infused with pollution codes that create social dis-
tance between the redneck/non-redneck rooted in these
bodily and behavioral distinctions. These pollution codes are
the practical work of boundary production, and although the
outcome of their use is less "dangerous" to poor rural Whites
than during the eugenics era, they still signify a process of
intra-racial othering within White identity formation. Over
the course of the 20th century, the response to poor rural
Whites who threatened modernity and its normative, White
middle-class identity went from a project of forced steriliza-
tion to a humor industry.
Conclusion
I have argued that Foxworthy's redneck humor helps police
the boundaries of mainstream American whiteness by target-
ing and polluting the redneck other. However, like much
complex social phenomena, humor can serve multiple, some-
times contradictory functions simultaneously (Meyer, 2000).
Although beyond the scope of this article, an interesting
question to consider is what other functions might this humor
serve? Can it be viewed as transformative or even libera-
tional for rural White Americans? Can it provide ample
social room to introduce "play" into the social imaginary,
allowing serious social issues to be addressed in non-threat-
ening ways? The fact that this humor is often predicated not
on content, but explicitly on excess, might actually be the
vehicle by which it can be viewed as liberating to rural
Americans, as they can be assured that their "moderation"
saves them from potential stigmatization. Perhaps this humor
even serves to alleviate the status anxiety of upwardly mobile
rural Americans? Although these questions are outside of the
purview of this particular analysis, they all provide interest-
ing potential avenues for future research into redneck humor.
In conclusion, my analysis adds to the literature exploring
the stratified terrain of whiteness via a novel analysis of pol-
lution codes imbedded in Foxworthy redneck humor. Lahiji
and Friedman (1997) argue that modernity emerges from the
belief that man is fundamentally a clean body. Accordingly,
the pre-modern man is an unclean body. I argue the rhetorical
boundary demarcating the redneck from the non-redneck is,
in the end, the line between a modern, middle-class whiteness
and a pre-modern White rusticity. We see references to the
poor breeding habits of individuals who live in rural areas.
Sexual and gendered deviance lays the groundwork for dys-
functional families that in turn reinforce immoral and trashy
behavior. In this way, a normative, mainstream whiteness is
co-constructed alongside redneck degeneracy by targeting the
redneck as a White Other. This White outsider fails to live up
to the socio-cultural expectations of modern American white-
ness, thus distinguishing and protecting modern American
whiteness from intra-racial threats to its normative identity.
The boundaries between rednecks and non-rednecks call into
question the popular assumption that White identity is a
homogeneous identity, constructed solely in opposition to
racial minorities (McIntosh, 1989; Morrison, 1992; Winders,
2003). Instead, whiteness is also constructed in opposition to
"redness" (Jarosz & Lawson, 2002), a status identity coupled
with those negative characteristics associated with pre-mod-
ern rusticity.
