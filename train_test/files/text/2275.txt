Objective: To evaluate the prevalence, demographic and
clinical correlates, and specificity of classes of psycho-
tropic medications indicated for mental disorders.
Design: Cross-sectional survey.
Setting: Direct household interviews of combined house-
hold and school samples representative of the general
population of adolescents in the United States.
Participants: Ten thousand one hundred twenty-three
adolescents aged 13 to 18 years who participated in the
National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement.
Main Exposures: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) (DSM-IV) mental dis-
orders and neurodevelopmental disorders.
Outcome Measure: Psychotropic medication use in the
past 12 months.
Results: Among youth with any DSM-IV mental disor-
der, 14.2% reported that they had been treated with a psy-
chotropic medication in the past 12 months. Strong as-
sociations emerged between specific disorders and classes
of medications with evidence for efficacy. Antidepres-
sants were most frequently used among those with
primary mood disorders (14.1%); stimulant use was
most common among those with attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (20.4%); and antipsychotic use was
infrequent and mostly seen among those with serious de-
velopmental disorders. Less than 2.5% of adolescents with-
out a 12-month mental disorder had been prescribed psy-
chotropic medications, and most had evidence of
psychological distress or impairment reflected in a pre-
vious mental disorder, subthreshold condition, or de-
velopmental disorder. Appropriate medication use was
significantly more frequent among those in treatment in
the mental health specialty sector than general medi-
cine or other settings.
Conclusions: These findings challenge recent con-
cerns over widespread overmedication and misuse of psy-
chotropic medications in US youth. In fact, these data
highlight the need for greater recognition and appropri-
ate treatment of youth with mental health disorders.

SUBSTANTIAL CONCERN HAS BEEN
raised about inappropriate
prescribing of psychotropic
medications to children and
adolescents.1-4 However, these
criticisms have been primarily based on
anecdotal reports,1-3 studies of small un-
representative clinical samples,4 and sec-
ondary analyses of large databases on pre-
scription drug use that lack detailed clinical
informationaboutindividualpatients.5-9 Al-
though there has been a striking increase
in prescriptions for psychotropic medica-
tionsinyouthoverthepastdecade,10,11 there
is a lack of empirical data on patterns of
medication use among youth with spe-
cific mental disorders. Without system-
atic clinical assessments, it is not possible
to evaluate relationships between commu-
nity psychotropic prescribing practices and
psychiatric disorders.
Previous reports on medication treat-
ment patterns among youth with spe-
cific disorders in community samples of
specific regions of the United States12-15
have generated widely variable rates of
medication use for attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (eg,
7.0%-72.2%13,14,16-18) and depression
(7.4%-31.0%10,19,20) primarily because of
methodologic and sample differences.
However, to our knowledge, no previ-
ous study has examined patterns of spe-
cific classes of psychotropic medication
use among youth across the full range
of common mental disorders and ser-
vice sectors in a large nationally repre-
sentative sample of adolescents.

Evaluation of patterns of inappropriate medication pre-
scription relies on empirical evidence that includes infor-
mation on both clinical diagnosis of specific disorders and
specific medications. In the present study, we examine
medicationoveruse,definedasprescriptionstoyouthwith-
outdisorders,andmisuse,definedasprescriptionstoyouth
for conditions for which they are not indicated. Even
though there is still insufficient evidence to establish clini-
cal practice guidelines for all child and adolescent mental
disorders,21 a growing body of well-controlled clinical trial
data can be used to establish medication treatment guide-
lines for several specific disorders including ADHD,15,22-25
bipolar disorder,26-28 major depressive disorder,27,29-31 anxi-
ety,32,33 conduct disorder and other behavior disor-
ders,34,35 obsessive-compulsive disorder,36 and autism spec-
trum and developmental disorders.37
This article reports on patterns of psychotropic medi-
cationuseamongyouthwithspecificmentaldisordersdur-
ing the past year in data from the National Comorbidity
Survey Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A), a nationally rep-
resentative sample of US adolescents based on direct in-
terviews. The aims of this study were to (1) present em-
pirical data on psychotropic medication use among youth
with specific mental disorders who received mental health
services; (2) assess the association between specific pri-
mary disorders and the use of medications that are indi-
cated for that disorder; and (3) examine sociodemo-
graphic and clinical correlates of specific classes of
medication among youth with specific mental disorders.
These results were used to examine the extent of medi-
cation overuse and misuse in US adolescents.
METHODS
SAMPLE AND PROCEDURE
The NCS-A is a nationally representative survey of 10 123 ado-
lescents aged 13 to 18 years in the continental United States con-
ducted between February 2001 and January 2004.38,39 The back-
ground, measures, design, and clinical validity of the NCS-A are
described elsewhere.40,41 The survey was based on a dual-frame
design that included a household sample (n=879 adolescents;
response rate 85.9%) and a school sample (n=9244; response
rate 74.7%). Adolescents were directly interviewed by profes-
sional interviewers coordinated by the Institute for Social Re-
search at the University of Michigan. Parents (or surrogates) were
mailed a self-administered questionnaire that included informa-
tion on adolescent sociodemographic characteristics, develop-
mental background, mental and physical health, and service use.
The parent self-administered questionnaire was completed by
6483 parents, yielding an overall conditional response rate of
83.3%. The recruitment and consent procedures were ap-
proved by the human subjects committees of both Harvard Medi-
cal School and the University of Michigan.
MEASURES
Sociodemographic Characteristics
The sample was weighted to provide a nationally representa-
tive sample of households and schools based on the most re-
cent US census. Sociodemographic variables assessed in the
NCS-A include respondent age in years, sex, race/ethnicity, par-
ent education, parental marital status, urbanicity, region, and
family income. Approximately one-half of the sample was male
(51.3%) and the mean (SE) age was 15.2 (0.1) years. The sample
was predominantly non-Hispanic white (65.6%). A great ma-
jority (84.5%) of the adolescents had parents who had com-
pleted at least high school, and more than three-fourths (78.6%)
of the sample lived with currently married or cohabiting par-
ents. A relatively small proportion (14.9%) of adolescents lived
in rural areas, and 18.1% of adolescents lived in the Northeast
region; 23.3%, in the Midwest; 36.0%, in the South; and 22.6%,
in the West. The poverty index ratio was calculated as the ra-
tio of family income divided by the poverty line based on fam-
ily size; 14.7% of the adolescents resided in poor families (1.5
times poverty index ratio).
Diagnostic Assessment
Adolescents were administered a modified version of the World
Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic In-
terview version 3.0, a fully structured interview administered
by trained lay interviewers.41 Computerized algorithms were
developed to generate Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Men-
tal Disorders (Fourth Edition) (DSM-IV) diagnoses. Major classes
of past-year disorders assessed in the Composite International
Diagnostic Interview included mood disorders, anxiety disor-
ders, eating disorders, behavior disorders, and substance use
disorders. Severity of disorders based on the presence of sub-
jective distress and impairment was also assessed. A parent com-
pleted a developmental and health history that included nu-
merous medical conditions, developmental disorders, and
learning disabilities, as well as the criteria for ADHD and be-
havior disorders. A hierarchical classification of disorders was
also established to characterize those youth with multiple dis-
orders.42 Adolescents with multiple disorders were assigned to
the highest-ordered diagnostic category (ie, primary disor-
der). Adolescents were also asked about their parents' symp-
toms and treatment for mental disorders in a separate section
of the interview. Diagnostic procedures are described in more
detail in previous publications.38,39
Mental Health Service Use
A separate interview module was administered to both the ado-
lescents and parents that collected information on service use
for emotional behavior disorders during the past 12 months.
Specific sectors included mental health specialty outpatient
(community mental health center, partial hospitalization or day
treatment program, or drug or alcohol clinic) with a mental
health professional (psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker,
or family counselor) or inpatient care visits (overnight hospi-
talization or emergency department visits), general medical vis-
its (pediatrician or family physician), and services from other
sectors (human services, school services, complementary and
alternative medicine, and juvenile justice).
Psychotropic Medication Use
Respondents' past-year psychotropic medication use for be-
havioral or emotional problems was assessed at the direct in-
terview through a list of 215 generic and proprietary names of
commonly used psychotropic medications. The specific names
of medications were checked from the actual prescription bottles
by the interviewer, when available. Psychotropic medications
were divided into broad classes (antidepressants, stimulants,
anxiolytics, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotics). Use of these
medications for nonpsychiatric indications was not included
in these analyses.

ANALYSIS PROCEDURES
The data were weighted to adjust for the differential probability
of selection of respondents within the school and household
samples, differential nonresponse, and residual differences be-
tween the sample and the US population and the full NCS-A
sample on the cross-classification of sociodemographic vari-
ables.40,41 Cross-tabulations were used to calculate the preva-
lence of each of the major classes of psychotropic medications
among adolescents with 12-month mental disorders, classes of
mental disorder, the number of classes of disorder, suicidality,
and a series of neurological or neurodevelopmental disorders.
Logistic regression analyses were used to examine sociodemo-
graphic and clinical correlates of use of common classes of psy-
chotropic drug within each disorder and disorder class. Models
simultaneously adjusted for adolescent demographics and par-
ent characteristics. Results were adjusted for design effects using
the Taylor series method in SUDAAN version 10 (RTI Interna-
tional). Statistical significance was based on 2-sided design-
based tests evaluated at a .05 level of significance.

ders, suicidality, and neurodevelopmental disorders as-
sessed in this study. The last column shows the proportion
who had received specialty mental health treatment. A
total of 24.9% of youth had received mental health ser-
vices during the past 12 months, with significant vari-
ability by DSM disorders.9
Among those with any DSM-IV mental disorder, 14.2%
reported that they had been treated with a psychotropic
medication. Adolescents with ADHD had the highest
prevalence of medication use (31.0%) followed by those
with mood disorders (19.7%), eating disorders (19.3%),
behavior disorders (19.3%), substance use disorders
(14.4%), and anxiety disorders (11.6%). Prevalence rates
of use of antipsychotic medications (1.0%), mood stabi-
lizers (0.7%), and anxiolytics (1.3%) among those with
a mental disorder were very low. The highest rates of psy-
chotropic medication use were observed among those with
a developmental disorder/autism (42.0%) or self-
reported suicidality (27.1%). There was a direct in-
crease in the proportions of youth with medication use
by the number of classes of disorders, with rates of 9.5%,
19.4%, and 26.0% for those with 1, 2, and 3 or more dis-
orders, respectively. Only 2.5% of adolescents without a
12-month DSM-IV disorder had been prescribed psycho-
tropic medications. Of these, 78% had evidence of psy-
chological distress or impairment reflected in a lifetime
history of mental disorders, subthreshold conditions, or
developmental disorders (data not shown). Not shown
here, 26.9% (SE = 0.8) of youth had also taken nonpsy-
chotropic prescribed medications during the past 7 days.
Table 2 presents the prevalence rates of past-year use
of the 3 major classes of psychotropic medications among
participants with primary diagnoses classified hierarchi-
cally to control for comorbidity among the past-year dis-
orders reported in Table 1. Antidepressants were most
frequently used among those with a primary mood dis-
order (depression, 11.8%; bipolar disorder, 16.0%) fol-
lowed by those with a primary anxiety disorder (4.5%).
Only 1.3% of those with no 12-month DSM-IV disorder
reported antidepressant use during the past year.
Stimulant use was most common among those with
ADHD (20.4%). A small proportion of youth with a be-
havior disorder without ADHD had received stimulants
(6.6%), and only 0.8% of those without a DSM-IV disor-
der reported stimulant use. Very small proportions of those
with DSM-IV disorders or other neuropsychiatric disor-
ders reported antipsychotic prescription use. Two per-
cent of those with a developmental disorder or learning
disability, 1.7% of those with bipolar disorder, and 1.8%
of those with a behavior disorder reported antipsychotic
use during the past 12 months. Only 0.1% of those with-
out a disorder reported antipsychotic prescriptions.
CORRELATES OF PSYCHOTROPIC
MEDICATION USE
Sociodemographic and clinical correlates of the major
classes of psychotropic medication use among youth with
the primary target disorders are presented in Table 3.
When simultaneously controlling for adolescent and par-
ent demographic characteristics and number of classes
of disorder, the rates of psychotropic medication use de-
creased with age among those with all 3 sets of indi-
cated disorders, particularly for stimulants among those
with ADHD. Both groups of older adolescents had sig-
nificantly lower rates of stimulant use than those in the
early adolescent age group (ages 13-14 years). There were
significantly lower prevalence rates of psychotropic medi-
cation use among ethnic minority youth than among white
youth with any of the 3 disorders and primary medica-
tion classes. Similarly, ethnic minority youth with ADHD
tended to use fewer stimulants than white youth with
ADHD. Antidepressant use among those with depres-
sion was more common among females than males,
whereas males with ADHD were more likely to receive
stimulants than females. Family income was inversely as-
sociated with antidepressant use. Adolescents whose par-
ents had not completed high school reported more stimu-
lant use than those with higher parental education levels.
Severity and suicidality were significantly associated
with greater rates of antidepressant medication use, and
those with more severe bipolar disorder or neurodevel-
opmental disorders had greater rates of antipsychotic use.
The association between specific disorders and indi-
cated classes of medication was significantly lower for
the general medical or other treatment sectors than the
mental health specialty sector for all 3 classes of medi-
cations. Approximately 25% of antidepressant prescrip-
tions among youth with a major mood disorder oc-
curred in the mental health sector compared with 11.5%
in general medicine and 0.3% in other sectors. Stimu-
lants among those with ADHD were prescribed signifi-
cantly more often by a mental health specialist (32.7%)
than by a clinician in the general medical sector (21.1%)
or other treatment sectors (3.8%). Similarly, 4.5% of an-
tipsychotic medications were prescribed to those with in-
dicated conditions by a mental health specialist com-

COMMENT
This study provides the first evaluation, to our knowl-
edge, of the prevalence, sociodemographic and clinical
correlates, and appropriate use of psychotropic medica-
tions with specific mental disorders in a nationally rep-
resentative sample of adolescents with comprehensive
evaluations of psychiatric disorders. The results chal-
lenge recent concerns over widespread overmedication
and misuse of prescribed psychotropic medications in US
adolescents.2-4 Therewasnocompellingevidenceforeither
misuse or overuse of psychotropic medications. Only
14.2% of youth with a mental disorder during the past
year reported psychotropic use, and the majority who had
been prescribed medications, particularly those who re-
ceived treatment in specialty mental health settings, had
a mental disorder with severe consequences and impair-
ment, functional impairment, suicidality, or associated
behavioral and developmental difficulties. When neu-
rodevelopmental disorders, lifetime history, and sub-
threshold conditions are considered, there are few youths

treated with psychotropic medications who did not have
a serious behavioral, cognitive, or emotional distur-
bance. The match between specific disorders and indi-
cated medications should also diminish criticism of medi-
cation misuse.
We also found little evidence to support claims of prac-
titioner overuse of medications in US adolescents. The ma-
jority of the pharmacologically treated youth without a re-
cent disorder had evidence of psychological distress or
impairment reflected in a previous mental disorder, sub-
threshold condition, or neurodevelopmental disorder. If
diagnostic information were available regarding schizo-
phrenia and related psychotic disorders and obsessive-
compulsive disorder, it is likely that an even smaller per-
centage of adolescents would be found to have no objective
mental health need for psychotropic treatment.
The efficacy of antidepressants for adolescent major
depressive disorder is supported by both clinical trials
andmeta-analyses.43 Depressedadolescentsaremorelikely
to respond to an antidepressant medication than to cog-
nitive behavioral therapy,44 the psychotherapy with the
strongest empirical evidence.45 Consistent with epide-
miological studies of major depressive disorder in adults,20
however, only a small minority of adolescents with a de-
pressive disorder were treated with antidepressants. Treat-
ment with antidepressants was strongly related to the pres-
ence of serious signs of depression, such as suicidality,
and severe impairment or distress. This suggests that an-
tidepressant use tends to be concentrated among those
young people with the greatest clinical need.
Across all of the disorders, ADHD was the condition
most likely to be treated with psychotropic medication,
especially stimulants. However, despite unequivocal ex-
perimental evidence of efficacy,23 a substantial majority
of adolescents with ADHD did not receive stimulants in
the past year. Even among those who were treated in the
specialty mental health sector, only about one-third of
adolescents with ADHD received stimulants. Similar re-
sults have been reported from research with youth un-
der treatment46 and in community samples.16,18
School-based services play a large role in the delivery
of mental health care to young people with ADHD.9,47 Be-
cause symptoms of ADHD are often contextually driven
and become particularly evident in high-demand set-
tings, such as the classroom, teachers are well posi-
tioned to assess treatment response.15 In the present study,
however, adolescents with ADHD who received mental
health care in schools or other settings outside of the spe-
cialty and general medical sectors were significantly less
likely to receive stimulant medications. Inadequate men-
tal health assessments, concerns over parental re-
sponses to a referral for medication evaluation, and philo-
sophical differences concerning the appropriate roles of
psychosocial and pharmacological treatments may con-
tribute to the low rate of stimulant use outside of the spe-
cialty mental health and general medical sectors.

Antipsychotic use was uncommon among all of the
assessed disorders. Youth with neurodevelopmental
disorders and bipolar disorder had the highest rates of
antipsychotic use, followed by a very small proportion
of adolescents with ADHD or disruptive behavior
disorders. Clinical trials support a role for second-
generation antipsychotics in the treatment of bipolar
disorder in youths and irritability, including aggressive
and self-injurious behavior, associated with autistic dis-
order.28,48 Without information concerning schizophre-
nia and related psychotic disorders and symptoms or
the clinical intent of the psychotropic prescribing, how-
ever, it is difficult to evaluate the appropriateness of
these prescribing practices. Nevertheless, increasing
rates of antipsychotic treatment of young people49 and
common adverse metabolic effects50 contribute to con-
cerns over antipsychotic prescribing patterns to young
people.42,49,51
This study advances knowledge on the patterns of psy-
chotropic medication use in a nationally representative
sample of adolescents with well-characterized DSM-IV
mental disorders and clinical correlates. Previous esti-
mates of psychotropic medication use from pharmacy and
insurancestatisticsarenotbasedonrepresentativesamples
of the population nor do they include comprehensive as-
sessment of current mental disorders. Limitations of the
present study include the lack of information on health
insurance that may influence treatment options and the
timing of the data collection that was completed in 2004
that may not represent current prescribing practices. How-
ever, this concern is offset by the close approximation
of the rates of antidepressant treatment52 and medica-
tion use among those in treatment for ADHD16 in our
study with those in a more recent national survey and
the finding from pharmacologic and services databases
that the use of most psychotropic medications peaked
around the study period.53-55 Finally, because our study
was restricted to adolescents, we cannot address recent
concerns of psychotropic medication use among chil-
dren under age 12 years.
A substantial proportion of youth with mental disor-
ders receive services, although relatively few are treated
in the specialty mental health service sector.9 The sig-
nificant difference in appropriate medication use be-
tween the mental health specialty and other treatment
sectors suggests that mental disorders are underrecog-
nized in the general medical sector and that appropriate
psychotropic medications are underprescribed. Prob-
lems with access to the specialty mental health sector pose
an enduring challenge to program planners and policy
makers. Mental health care of young people within
schools, juvenile justice, and primary care settings is of-
ten inaccessible, fragmented, and of uneven quality.56,57
Many regions of the country have only limited access to
child and adolescent psychiatrists58,59 and few nonspe-
cialists have sufficient knowledge and experience in the
full range of effective treatments. Progress in delivering
evidence-based treatments to a larger share of adoles-
cents with common mental disorders will likely require
coordinated interventions at the patient, parent, clini-
cian, and health care system levels.
