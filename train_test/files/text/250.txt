Home Health Care

Objective. This article explores whether the formal home health care (HHC) market is equitable or manifests un-
explained racial disparities in use.
Methods. The database is the 1994 National Long Term Care Survey. We estimate logit regression models with a race
dummy variable, race interaction terms, and stratification by race. We apply the Oaxaca decomposition technique to
quantify whether the observed racial gap in formal HHC use is explained by racial differences in predisposing, enabling,
need, and environmental characteristics.
Results. We find numerous unique racial patterns in HHC use. Blacks with diabetes and low income have higher
probabilities of HHC use than their White counterparts. Black older persons have a 25% higher chance of using HHC than
Whites. Our Oaxaca analysis indicates that racial differences in predisposing, enabling, need, and environmental
characteristics account for the racial gap in use of HHC.
Discussion. We find that the HHC market is equitable, enhancing availability, aceptability, and accessibility of care for
older Black persons. Thus, the racial differences that we find are not racial disparities.
DISTINCT racial patterns in older persons' use of both
institutional and community-based health care services
are well documented (Wallace, Levy-Storms, Kington, &
Andersen, 1998). In this article, we explore whether formal
home health care (HHC) use among older persons varies by
race, and if so, then we seek to explain why this differential use
occurs. We assess the use of HHC as an integral part of
community health care rather than as one component of the
spectrum of long-term care, as is done by Wallace and
colleagues (1995, 1998), and we delineate the use of HHC in
the context of the broader literature of racial differences in
community care to highlight that this market differs from other
alternatives. Thus, discussion of racial patterns of use for
alternative types of community health care provides important
contextual background for our focus on HHC.
Owing partly to limited financial access to nursing homes
and cultural preferences (Falcone & Broyles, 1994), older
Blacks are less likely to use nursing homes and more likely to
live in the community with chronic conditions and disabilities
that exceed those of older Whites (Wallace et al., 1998; White-
Means, 2000). However, lower use of skilled nursing facilities
by Blacks is not counterbalanced by higher use of HHC
services (Cagney & Agree, 1999). Further, noninstitutionalized
older disabled Blacks are less likely to use other community-
based services such physician services and prescription
medications (White-Means, 2000). Differential use of in-home
assistive devices is also found, with Whites more likely to use
home modification devices and Blacks more likely to use
portable devices (Rubin & White-Means, 2001).
What explains these distinct racial patterns in health services
use? Racial differences in physician services use and prescription
medication are not fully explained by racial differences in average
income or socioeconomic or health characteristics (White-Means,
2000). Researchers (Wallace, 1990; Wallace et al., 1998; White-
Means, 2000) note that racial differences are explained by three
factors: availability, accessibility, and acceptability. Problems of
availability arise from the lack of close geographic proximity to
services and/or segregation in the use of services. Lack of
knowledge about available services and limited referrals to
auxiliary services lead to gaps in accessibility. Patient dissatis-
faction, culturally insensitive care, and unfavorable provider­
patient interactions lead to problems of acceptability.
The Institute of Medicine (2002) distinguishes between racial
differences and disparities. It reports that some racial differences
in health care use can be expected and are acceptable, including
differences due to clinical need, patient preferences, and the
appropriateness of particular interventions. But if differences
are due to characteristics of the health care system, provider
discrimination, or incorrect or deficient patient information, then
these differences are considered racial disparities in care. Thus,
differences in use, reflecting such factors as stereotyping, biases,
and uncertainty regarding treatment efficacy by race, limited
supplies of racial/ethnic minority health care providers, and poor
patient­provider communication and trust, are seen as dispar-
ities. We seek to determine whether the racial differences in HHC
use are acceptable differences (and thus equitable) or actually
reflect disparities, as defined by the Institute of Medicine. If the
differences found are disparities, then we would expect to find
divergences in availability, accessibility, and acceptability in
HHC use. So, disparities are seen as differentials that are not
explained by either socioeconomic or health characteristics.
We define formal HHC as market-purchased services pro-
vided in the patient's home, including both Medicare-financed
care associated with subacute care and community-based care

that meets needs associated with activities of daily living (ADLs)
and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Our
comparison focuses on use versus nonuse of community-based
HHC and whether the comparative use is equitable by race. The
dichotomous dependent variable indicates whether an older
Black or White person who lives in the community uses HHC or
not. Nonusers of HHC may use informal care support or various
alternate formal (purchased or market-supplied) health care
services or no care, as distinguished by Wallace et al. (1998),
who also explore nursing home users.
We hypothesize that HHC is an equitable market. If it
achieves the three criteria of availability, accessibility, and
acceptability, then this would suggest that HHC represents an
equitable market. HHC is more available to the home bound
than other community-based care because it does not require
transportation (Rubin, White-Means, & Feagin, 2003). Acces-
sibility is broadened by Medicare and by the relatively low
price of HHC. Medicare is the largest single HHC payer (about
40%; National Association of Home Care [NAHC], 2000),
covering HHC under Part A with no out-of-pocket charges and
under Part B with a $100 deductible. Other federal programs
and Medicaid also pay for some HHC for the poor or medically
indigent (NAHC, 2000; Shi & Singh, 1998). Also, the
culturally diverse workforce of HHC (35% are Black and
10% Hispanic) may be more acceptable to diverse groups of
older persons than nonhome community-based care and may be
perceived to be more culturally sensitive (Stone & Wiener,
2001). As this low-paid workforce is economically disadvan-
taged, cultural and class barriers tend to be minimized.
Additionally, because of the relatively low start-up cost of
a home health agency (approximately $150,000), many
agencies are owned by ethnic minorities and are more likely
to serve communities where a higher proportion of ethnic
minorities reside (Brown, 1998).
Data from national surveys tend to support the hypothesis of
HHC as an equitable market. Indeed, Blacks are more likely to
use HHC than Whites (Mui & Burnette, 1994; Wallace et al.,
1998). In contrast, regression analysis provides equivocal
support for the role of race in increasing home health use.
Freedman (1999) reports that non-Whites are significantly more
likely to use more HHC services and also to use them for longer
terms. This higher intensity of use is associated with the greater
likelihood that Blacks postpone use and remain in the
community longer with chronic conditions (Cagney & Agree,
1999). Although the coefficients are insignificant, Picone and
Wilson (1999) find higher Medicare home health agency use
rates for Blacks, but they conclude that socioeconomic factors
are not strong determinants compared to health status. Similarly,
Miller and colleagues (1996), who do not find racial differences,
find that overall health and functional status, as well as
Medicaid use, are primary predictors of service use. In contrast,
Wallace and colleagues (1998) note that African Americans are
less likely than non-Latino Whites to use HHC, with HHC use
more likely for those of advanced age, women and single
women, and those with more formal education, higher ADLs,
stroke or heart conditions, low income, and Medicaid.
Research Questions
This study makes important contributions to a growing
literature on racial disparities in health care. The broad research
objective is to discover whether HHC provides an equitable
health care market for Blacks. We determine empirically based
answers to two specific questions: (a) Are there distinct racial
patterns in the use and determinants of use of HHC? (b) What is
the role of racial differences in need, predisposing conditions,
enabling factors, and environmental factors in explaining
observed racial differences in HHC use?
METHODS
Data
The database is the 1994 National Long-Term Care Survey
(NLTCS), a repeated panel survey designed to estimate chronic
disability status, functional problems, and institutionalization
rates of older persons and their use of community-based
in-home long-term care. The NLTCS provides nationally
representative data on the prevalence and patterns of functional
limitations, medical conditions, and recent medical problems
for Medicare-enrolled Americans aged 65 and older. It also
includes data on health services use, out-of-pocket expendi-
tures, financial resources, and sociodemographic characteristics
of older persons and their families. The 1994 NLTCS sample is
the fourth panel and includes living respondents from previous
panels, despite constancy or changes in their disability level
(Manton, Corder, & Stallard, 1997). The 1994 dataset is
supplemented with additional persons meeting the impaired
status screening criteria from those who were previously
screened but not interviewed because at that time they did not
meet the impaired status criteria or reached age 65 after the
1989 cutoff. The addition of an oversample of persons aged 95
and older and a ``healthy'' sample not meeting the ``impaired''
status criteria is unique to the 1994 NLTCS to enhance the
national representativeness of the data.
Detailed questions are asked if persons meet screening
criteria for chronic ADL and IADL disability. However, many
carried over were previously chronically disabled but in 1994
had no ADL and/or IADL disabilities so that the sample shows
many people with no current ADLs or IADLs (Liu, Manton, &
Aragon, 2000). In contrast to some analyses (e.g., Liu et al.,
2000), we include going outside as an ADL, because it is
grouped as an ADL in the NLTCS screener definitions. The
NLTCS screener includes limitations in walking around inside
and also going outside as ADLs; this ADL definition may result
in relatively high prevalence of ADLs compared with IADLs.
The NLTCS includes 5,089 noninstitutionalized older per-
sons in the detailed community interviews, of whom 4,740
are non-Hispanic Whites and non-Hispanic Blacks; our study
sample includes 3,448 non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic
Black complete reporters (participants who provided data for all
variables). Similar to other survey research data, it has missing
data on family income (25%) and education (5%). Typically,
persons at upper and lower incomes are least likely to report
income or education or both, resulting in patterns of data loss
that are nonrandom or systematic. Thus, the factors explaining
the likelihood of missing data are unrelated to the current
study's exploration of the use of home care.
With a sample of complete reporters, we lose some statistical
power, but this does not lead to inaccurate parameter estimates.
First, statistical tests (Kromrey & Hines, 1994; Switzer, Roth,
& Switzer, 1998) indicate that in cases where no more than
HOME CARE: IS THERE EQUITY? S221
30% of the data are missing (as is true for our sample), accurate
parameter estimates are generated. Second, standard estimation
procedures restricted to the available observations yield valid
inferences when the process that generates the missing data is
independent of the observed and unobserved data values
(Rotnitzky & Wypij, 1994). As the data indicate that it is
equally likely that Blacks and Whites have missing income data
(27.19% vs 24.3%) and that home health users and nonusers
have missing income data (26.81% vs 24.11%), we have further
confirmation of lack of bias in the parameter estimates using the
available observations. Thus, our analysis uses a sample of
3,448 persons, with 3,136 White non-Hispanic and 312 Black
non-Hispanic participants, as described in Table 1.
Analytic Design
To examine our first research question, we use three
regression strategies: one with a race dummy variable, a second
with race interaction terms, and a third stratified by race. For the
second research question, we apply the Oaxaca decomposition
technique (Oaxaca, 1973), quantifying the percentage of the
observed racial gap in HHC use explained by racial differences.
This approach can contribute to our understanding because
it questions whether an identified racial difference in home
health use is what we should observe. As the health status of
community-residing older Blacks is significantly lower than that
of Whites, the Oaxaca approach can help to answer whether we
should similarly find differences in home health use, with
significantly higher use by Blacks, and if not, then why not?
We first estimate logistic regression models of HHC use, in-
cluding a race dummy variable (Model I) and also race interaction
terms (Model II). Next, we estimate logistic regressions of
HHC use, stratified by race. The measure of HHC use is a
dichtomous variable that equals 1 if paid home services are
provided by a helping organization (i.e., a home health agency or
other business provider) and 0 otherwise. The NLTCS allows
respondents to define a helping organization as any organization
that provides in-home assistance, by describing their relationship
to each in-home caregiver (or helper). If any caregiver was from
a helping organization, the respondent was coded as having
HHC.
Our choice of explanatory variables and conceptual frame-
work are guided by the Andersen model (1995) and previous
research on HHC use. The Anderson model suggests that medical
use patterns are influenced by (a) predisposing conditions, (b)
enabling factors, (c) environmental factors, and (d) need. Our
measures of predisposing conditions are gender, age, marital
status, education, and three quantifiable behavioral character-
istics (whether the respondent currently smokes, exercises or
plays sports regularly, and/or drinks alcoholic beverages one to
three times a month or less frequently; Cutler & Sheiner, 1994;
Newman, Struyk, Wright, & Rice, 1990).
Our measures of enabling factors are income, income squared,
health insurance status (Medicare only, Medicare plus supple-
ments, or Medicare and Medicaid dual eligibility), number of
adults living in the home, and use of home-delivered meals. We
utilize income squared because previous research (White-
Means, 1997) documents a nonmonotonic relationship between
home health use and income. Home-delivered meals, part of
community-based nutrition programs in Title VII of the Older
Americans Act and part of community-based in-home care, may
enhance nutrition and forestall institutionalization (Shi & Singh,
1998). As home-delivered meals are not part of standard home
care and are not covered by Medicare, we view use of home-
delivered meals as an enabling factor that facilitates living in the
community.
Similar to previous research (Picone & Wilson, 1999), we
include two proxy measures for geographic environment: urban
(respondents living in cities of 50,000 or more residents or their
suburbs) and South. We also include measures of (a) whether
the state has a large Medicaid home- and community-based care
waiver program to reflect financial support for HHC services
(Sloan, Picone, & Hoerger, 1997) and (b) the number of primary
care physicians per 1,000 residents by state to measure
underservice by physicians. State Medicaid waiver program
funding of HHC greater than the median of $142.4 million
indicates a high level of funding, whereas funding less than or
equal to $142.4 million indicates a low level of funding.
We examine HHC need with the five most prevalent chronic
health conditions in the NLTCS and the ADLs and IADLs used
as screening criteria in the NLTCS. The five chronic conditions
are (a) joint diseases (rheumatism, paralysis, and arthritis),
(b) diabetes, (c) heart conditions, (d) hypertension, and (e)
breathing disorders (bronchitis, pneumonia, flu, emphysema,
and asthma). Although persons in the sample may have one or
more of these conditions, we enter each condition as a separate
variable in our regressions. The simultaneous impact of multiple
conditions can be explored by summing the impacts of
individual conditions. We include the number of ADLs and
IADLs as measures of disability (Cutler & Sheiner, 1994;
Newman et al., 1990; Picone & Wilson, 1999; Sloan et al.,
1997). As data on severity of health conditions are unavailable
in the NLTCS database, use of continuous measures of ADLs
and IADLs provides an approach to a proxy for severity. The
nine ADLs are limitations with eating, getting in and out of
bed, getting in and out of chairs, walking around inside, going
outside, dressing, bathing, toileting, and controlling bowel
movement/urination; and the seven IADLs are limitations with
meal preparation, laundry, light housework, grocery shopping,
managing money, taking medicine, and making telephone calls.
The general form of our logit regression models is as follows:
HHC ¼ a þ b1
DG þ b2
PH þ b3
EN þ b4
EF þ b5
HS
þ b6
ADL þ b7
IADL þ e ð1Þ
where DG ¼ a vector of demograhic and sociostructural
variables (gender, age, marital status, education), PH ¼ a vector
of health behaviors (smoking, exercise, and alcohol consump-
tion practices), EN ¼ a vector of enabling factors (income,
income squared, health insurance status, number of potential
caregivers living in the home, and home-delivered meal use),
EF ¼ a vector of environmental factors (urban, South, under-
service by physicians, and residence in a state with high- or low-
funded Medicaid waiver programs), HS ¼ a vector of chronic
health conditions (joint diseases, diabetes, heart conditions,
hypertension, and breathing disorders), ADL ¼ number of
ADLs, IADL ¼ number of IADLs, and e ¼ error term.
We use three regression strategies to examine our first re-
search question. We begin with regression models that include
race dummy variables (Model I) and race interaction terms
(Model II), because they are most directly comparable with
WHITE-MEANS AND RUBIN
S222
previous research. If the race dummy variable is statistically
significant, then race has a unique and independent influence on
HHC use, given the role of other regression variables. The
interactive model explores whether the impact of other
independent variables on HHC use varies by race. Finally,
using models stratified by race, we explore differences in
estimated b coefficients and marginals (to measure impact of
change in the independent variable on the probability of HHC
use) for Blacks and Whites. We seek to determine whether
independent variables impact HHC use differently for those of
different races. We explore whether factors found significant
in the unstratified data are significant in the stratified
models and whether they are significant for both Blacks and
Whites.

HOME CARE: IS THERE EQUITY? S223
For our second research question, we explore the role of
racial differences in need, predisposing conditions, enabling
factors, and environmental factors in explaining the observed
racial difference in HHC use. If the variables included in our
model do not fully account for racial differences in HHC use,
then other nonmeasured factors are assumed to account for
these differences. A priori, we expect Blacks' relatively lower
health levels to be associated with greater HHC use compared
with Whites. We also predict that the magnitude of the racial
gap in HHC use directly corresponds with the size of the racial
gap in variables included in the model.
Our methodology for the second research question is
application of the Oaxaca decomposition technique. The
Oaxaca technique is used to quantify the percentage of the
observed racial gap in HHC use explained by racial differences
in the predisposing, enabling, need, and measured environ-
mental characteristics. This technique is a standard approach in
labor economics to determine the extent of wage discrimina-
tion. It was originally applied to log-linear models of wage
compensation and later to nonlinear logit, probit, and bivariate
probit discrimination models (Hinks & Watson, 2001; Mo-
hanty, 2002). With use of this technique, the total racial gap
in HHC use is the difference in the probability that Whites
and Blacks use HHC services: (PW
À PB
). PW
À PB
is equal
to F(Xw, ßw) À F(Xb, ßb), where ßw and ßb ¼ regression
coefficients for Whites and Blacks, Xw and Xb ¼ characteristics
of Whites and Blacks, and F ¼ the cumulative logistic prob-
ability function: 1/[1 þ eÀ(aþbXi)]. The total gap emphasized in
the Oaxaca technique can also be expressed as
½FðXw; ßwÞ À FðXb; ßwÞ þ ½FðXb; ßwÞ À FðXb; ßbÞ : ð2Þ
The first term of the above equation measures the gap in the
probability of HHC use that is explained by racial differences in
characteristics, that is, acceptable differences in use. The gap
explained by racial differences uses the regression coefficients
for Whites and examines how the probability of HHC use
varies when these regression coefficients are paired with the
characteristics of Whites versus the characteristics of Blacks.
The unexplained gap (i.e., disparity) is the difference in the
probability of use of HHC by Blacks assuming their own
characteristics (Xb) and using the regression coefficients of
Blacks (ßb) and the probability of use of HHC by Blacks
assuming their own characteristics and the coefficients (ßw) of
Whites.
If unexplained differences in service use are found, they may
be due to either unmeasured demand side or supply side factors,
including racial differences in the knowledge about or
preferences for HHC use, barriers to formal medical care, or
possibly discrimination in the provision of HHC (i.e., factors in
the health delivery system that influence accessibility, avail-
ability, and acceptablity of services). If the Oaxaca technique
reveals unexplained differences in services use, then an
important next step of investigation would be to seek data
sources that allow identification of the causal factors among the
unmeasured variables. However, if application of the Oaxaca
technique reveals no unexplained differences in HHC service
use, then an equitable market with acceptable racial differences
is indicated. An additional caveat in the use of the Oaxaca
decomposition approach is that measurement errors may also
generate unexplained racial variation in the use of HHC. If
regression variables are systematically measured with error by
race, for example, self-reported diseases, then the systematic
differences would appear as components of the unexplained
gap in service use.
RESULTS
Sample Characteristics
Table 1 presents the study sample characteristics by race.
About 16.2% of Whites and 20.2% of Blacks used HHC, or
Blacks had a 25% greater chance of utilizing HHC. The sample
includes 91% non-Hispanic Whites and 9% non-Hispanic
Blacks, with similar mean ages of 78 and gender distribution
(63% female). Whereas 40% of Whites live in medium or large
cities and 35% are in the South, more than half of Blacks live in
medium or large cities, and two thirds live in the South. Fully
70% of Whites, but only 29% of Blacks, have Medicare
plus supplemental health insurance coverage, a striking racial
differential. Blacks are much more likely than Whites to have
only Medicare coverage (30.7% vs 17.3%) and 3.5 times more
likely than Whites to be dually eligible (36.7% vs 10.4%). These
racial insurance status differences correspond to differences
in education and income. The average income is slightly over
$21,000 for Whites and only $13,000 for Blacks; about 70% of
Whites have at least a ninth grade education compared with 39%
for Blacks. Preferences for preventive health and wellness differ
for the two racial groups. Whites are more likely than Blacks to
report drinking one to two times a week (15% vs 5%) and also
getting exercise or playing sports regularly (23% vs 14%), but
Blacks are slightly more likely to smoke (13% vs 10%).
The ability of older persons with chronic illnesses to remain
in the community is affected by the availability of caregivers
(measured by the number of other adults in the household) and
nonhousehold support services (measured by use of home-
delivered meals). The number of other adults living in the home
differs by race, with Blacks having an average of slightly over
two, while Whites average only one and a half. The data indicate
differences in the use of home-delivered meals (7.3% of Blacks
vs 4.8% of Whites). Blacks are more likely than Whites to live in
states with high physician/population ratios (6.63 vs. 5.00), with
high Medicaid waiver programs (25% vs 8%), and also with
small Medicaid waiver programs (12% vs 3%).
Blacks report the presence of chronic health conditions more
frequently than do Whites, with the exception of breathing
disorders. The presence of heart conditions is reported by
Blacks and Whites with similar frequency (28%). However,
Blacks report joint disease, diabetes, and hypertension more
frequently. Blacks average more ADLs than Whites (1.78 vs
1.38) and report more IADLs (averaging 1.08 vs 0.81). About
56% of Blacks report four or more ADLs (compared with 47%
of Whites), and 29.4% report one or more IADLs (compared
with 26.5% of Whites). Note that for both Blacks and Whites,
ADL prevalence is higher than IADL prevalence. Based on the
NLTCS screener criteria, this is not unexpected, as suggested in
the data description section above. The prevalence for difficulty
in getting around inside is 33.1%, and the prevalence for
difficulty in getting around outside is only 3.9% (3.9% for
Whites and 3.8% for Blacks). Thus, the results might be slightly

skewed by including difficulty getting around outside as an
ADL rather than an IADL.
Racial Patterns in Use of Formal HHC
Table 2 reports two models analyzing the logistic regression
results for HHC use by Blacks and Whites. Model I includes
a race dummy variable, and Model II also includes race
interaction terms. Chronic medicial conditions, ADLs, IADLs,
and enabling, environmental, and sociodemographic factors
influence HHC use.
In both Model I and Model II, heart condition is the chronic
condition most likely to lead to HHC use. Older persons with
more ADLs and IADLs have greater HHC use, and both
income and income squared are statistically significant.
Interestingly, there is a nonmonotonic relationship between
income and HHC use. First, HHC use decreases as income
increases; then, for those with higher incomes, increases in
income are associated with increases in the probability of HHC
use. It appears that HHC use is U-shaped with respect to
income, as has been found for nursing home care (Headen,
1993; Morrow-Howell & Proctor, 1994). Those participating in
meals programs are more likely to use HHC. However, as
the number of persons living in the household increases, the
probability of HHC use decreases. Dual eligibility increases the
likelihood of HHC use, a likelihood that varies with the extent
of state funding available for Medicaid community waiver
programs. Women and persons who are older and have more
formal years of education are more likely to use HHC, but those
who are married are less likely to use HHC. The regression
indicates that the variable of race is statistically insignificant in
influencing HHC use.
The role of race is further explored in Model II with race
interaction terms. Each variable that was significant in Model
I remains significant in the full interaction model, and the
variables interacting race and diabetes and race and income are
also significant. Thus, if Blacks have diabetes, they are more
likely to use HHC than White diabetic individuals and also more
likely than Blacks who have other major chronic conditions.
Further, when we examine Blacks and Whites who have the
same income, Blacks are more likely than Whites to use HHC.
Table 3 presents the results of our stratified logistic regressions
of the use of formal care by race and the marginals for signifi-
cant coefficients. The influence of race on some independent
variables, as reported in Table 2, allows us to estimate the
regressions separately, although a Chow test indicates that race
does not affect the impact of all independent variables on the
dependent variable. With the exception of the marginals for the
income and income-squared terms, in the reported logistic
regressions, the marginal is exp(ÀaÀbx)*bi
/[1þexp(ÀaÀbx)]2,
where bi
¼ the regression coefficient for the variable for which
a marginal is reported. Thus, Table 3 reports the marginal effects
of the significant independent variables on the probabilities of
HHC use, that is, the percentage point differences in the
probability of HHC use when the regression variable changes
by 1 unit. For regression variables that are dichotomous, the
marginal is the percentage point difference in the probability of
HHC use when the regression variable has a value of 1.
Computing the marginals for the income and income-squared
terms is complicated because we use an interactive term (in-
come squared) in a nonlinear regression model, that is, logistic
regression (Ai & Norton, 2003; Norton, Wang, & Ai, 2003).
Thus, the marginal for income is (b2
þ 2b4
x2
) * exp(Àa À bx)/
[1 þ exp(Àa À bx)]2, where b2
¼ the estimated coefficient of the
income term, b4
¼ the coefficient of the squared income term,
and x2
¼ the mean of the income variable.
Marginals are comparable with reporting odds ratios, but
they are more straightforwardly comprehended. Whereas odds
ratios provide data on the relative increased probability of use,
marginals provide data on the absolute increased probability of
use. Odds ratios indicate the effect of a unit increase of the
independent variable on the odds of an event [(probability of
HHC use)/(1 À probability of HHC use)], but marginals report
the effect of a unit increase in the independent variable on the
probability of HHC use.
The results in Table 3 indicate that despite the difference in
sample size for the Black and White samples, there are unique
racial patterns in HHC use. As suggested in the interactive
model, among Blacks, diabetes increases the probability of
using HHC by 10%; among Whites, heart conditions are
associated with higher probabilities (4.5%) of HHC use. ADL
disability affects HHC use for both Blacks and Whites.
The direct effect of each additional ADL is to increase the
probability of HHC use by 4.3% for Whites and by 4.6% for
Blacks. For both racial groups, participation in delivered meals
programs is associated with a greater likelihood of using HHC,
with greater probability of 24% for Blacks and 12% for Whites.
Several impacts are unique among Whites. More IADLs are
associated with greater HHC use, with each additional IADL
increasing the probability of HHC use by slightly less than 1%;
each year of age increases the probability of HHC use by 0.25%;
women have a slightly (3%) higher probability of HHC use; more
education increases the likelihood of HHC use by 3%; and
married status reduces the likelihood of HHC use by 6%. Three
enabling/environmental characteristics also influence HHC use
among Whites. Dual eligibility increases the probability of use by
8% in states with high Medicaid community waiver programs
and by 7% in states with low Medicaid community waiver
programs. There is a nonmonotonic relationship between income
and HHC use. At lower income levels, each $1,000 increase in
income decreases the probability of HHC use by 1.7%, but higher
income (above $49,500) increases the probability of using HHC.
For each person living in the house, the probability of HHC use
decreases 3.5%.
Explained and Unexplained Racial Patterns
in the Use of HHC
We apply the Oaxaca technique to determine how much of
the racial differential in the probability of using HHC is
explained by racial differences in medical and socioeconomic
characteristics. We calculate the difference between the
probability that Whites would use HHC assuming their own
actual characteristics (0.1554) and the probability that Whites
would use HHC assuming they have the characteristics of
Blacks (0.1984), as measured by [F(Xw, ßw) À F(Xb, ßw)]. This
calculated differential probability is (0.1554 À 0.1984) or
À0.0430, which is approximately the actual racial gap in HHC
use (0.162 À 0.202). Thus, the Oaxaca decomposition suggests
that differences solely in the medical, socioeconomic, enabling,
HOME CARE: IS THERE EQUITY? S225
and environmental characteristics of Blacks and Whites
should lead to the observed racial gap in HHC use. Expressed
differently, we find that HHC is indeed an equitable health care
market.
DISCUSSION
Consistent with our prediction that HHC provides an
equitable community-based health care market, the raw data
indicate that in 1994, Blacks were more likely to use HHC than

WHITE-MEANS AND RUBIN
S226
Whites. In this study, we find that predisposing, enabling,
environmental, and need factors influence the use of HHC by
both Blacks and Whites. Blacks have a 25% higher probability
of using HHC than Whites. We find that racial differences in
chronic conditions and socioeconomic factors fully predict this
greater likelihood of HHC use among Blacks. This finding
supports our hypothesis that HHC use is equitable by race.
Older Black patients who live in the community with health
conditions that are more extensive than those of White patients
(possibly due to lower use of nursing home care and earlier-
than-average release from hospitals) are absorbed by the HHC
market, which presents few barriers to access.
What do these results mean when other research (e.g.,
Wallace and colleagues 1998) finds that racial differences
persist? The highlight of our findings is that HHC provides
a uniquely equitable market. Similar to other research, our
descriptive statistics (see Table 1) note a racial difference in
HHC use, with Blacks having greater use. However, using our
regression model and an expanded set of variables relative to
those of Wallace and colleagues (1998), we find that racial
differences in these sample characteristics explain racial
differences in use of HHC among community-based older
persons. Thus, the racial differences we identify in HHC are not
racial disparities (Institute of Medicine, 2002) and do not reflect
divergences in availability, accessibility, and acceptability.
As described in previous research (Hodgson & Cohen, 1999;
Wallace et al., 1998), chronic conditions (e.g., need) signif-
icantly influence HHC use, and those with the most impact vary
by race. Diabetes is most reported by black HHC users,
whereas a heart condition is most reported by Whites. These
findings indicate that health policies or policy changes that
differentially affect HHC use by chronic condition may also
have unintended differential racial impacts. For example, the
1997 Balanced Budget Act, disallowing venipuncture as a sole
qualifier for HHC coverage by Medicare, possibly imposed
a greater burden on Blacks than Whites, because venipuncture
patients are primarily diabetic. Research indicates that loss of
HHC among disqualified venipuncture patients reduced their
bathing and dressing assistance, requiring them to do more for
themselves (Rubin et al., 2003). Thus, an unintended effect of
the Balanced Budget Act, decreasing access to a service more
heavily used by Blacks, possibly reduced the racial differential
in HHC use. This legislation may even have reversed the prior
trend of relatively higher HHC use among Blacks, and its
impact is worthy of further investigation.
ADL limitations increase HHC use for Blacks and Whites,
although by different percentages, which is consistent with
previous research (Kemper, 1992; Wallace et al., 1998; White-
Means, 1997) noting the central role of disability level in
affecting HHC use. The unique role that meals programs play in
increasing use of HHC needs further exploration. A remaining
question is why HHC differs from other health care services
for older persons. Examining the differential impacts of race
and chronic conditions on older persons' use of assistive
devices, Rubin and White-Means (2001) find a 50% unex-
plained underuse gap for Blacks. White-Means (2000) finds

HOME CARE: IS THERE EQUITY? S227
unexplained underutilization of medical services and pre-
scription drugs for Blacks. For HHC, we find higher use
among Blacks and no unexplained use differential.
It is important to note that whereas the NLTCS involves
a complex sampling method, it is nonetheless nationally rep-
resentative. The NLTCS has only a minimal research design
effect of sampling (maybe 10%). Therefore, use of SUDAAN
in regression analysis to adjust standard errors for underesti-
mation of the true variation is considered unnecessary. Further,
putting the SUDAAN model on top of the regression would
possibly portray an inaccurate degree of precision (K. Manton,
personal communication, 2004). This is in contrast to the
procedures necessary for numerous other complex survey
design data sources where the sampling technique leads to
substantive correlation among observations, necessitating the
use of weights.
We predict use of HHC at one point in time and show that this
cross-sectional view of HHC use indicates equity. Analyzing
HHC use within a dynamic modeling framework remains an
interesting area for future research. For example, it is unclear
whether Blacks are more likely than Whites to use HHC for
extended periods or with more or less continuity than Whites.
These are also additional components of equity of care that are
beyond the scope of this article.
Another area for future research is the importance of
including detailed measures of variation in support at the
community level, comparable with the enabling variables that
Bradley and colleagues (2002) label ``availability of support.''
We are unable to incorporate these variables analytically,
because although we have individual data, the NLTCS lacks
detailed community-level variables, giving our research
imperfect measures of the community variables of Bradley
and colleagues. Inclusion of these community support variables
would address significant differences at the small area level.
Although our data suggest there are not unexplained racial
differences in HHC use, we are unable to determine whether there
are racial differences in the types and quality of HHC received,
because different types of HHC are not delineated in the data.
Thus, further research is still warranted to understand whether
there is equity in terms of quality of care provided by different
types of helping organizations. In addition, questions of how
racial differences in household and family formation affect HHC
use and whether the actual intrahousehold relationships are
important deserve future investigation. Our results indicate that
being married and also the number of other adults in the
household are significant for Whites but not for Blacks.
The relationship between HHC use and cultural differences is
another area for prospective research. Culture, expressed in
group values and beliefs, may affect the selection among long-
term care options and between institutional and noninstitutional
choices (Thornton & White-Means, 2000; Wallace et. al.,
1998). Thus, measured racial differences may embody cultural
influences that are implicit rather than explicit. Explicit
measures of knowledge and cultural preferences for receipt of
HHC versus other health care services, personal experiences of
discriminaton when interacting with the health care system or
with the HHC services market, and charactersistics of patients'
community health care systems are further issues needing
investigation. These analyses would provide input for effective
public policy measures to address racial disparities in use of
health care services and enable replication of the equity in use
that our data indicate is provided by the HHC market.
