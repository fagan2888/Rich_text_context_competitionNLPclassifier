PHYSICAL INACTIVITY IS CON-
nected to an increase in obe-
sity and the associated mor-
bidity and chronic diseases
among youth.1-4 Expert opinion5-8 and
empirical studies9 suggest that chil-
dren need a minimum of 60 minutes of
moderate-to-vigorous physical activ-
ity (MVPA) per day, a standard pro-
posed by the US Department of Agri-
culture.10
How many youth meet this stan-
dard is unclear. Most population-
based surveys have relied on self-
report data with questionable validity,
and studies that have used objective
measures of physical activity have
typically involved small samples.
Accelerometers provide objective
measurement of physical activity and
the feasibility of collecting accelerom-
eter data on large samples has been
demonstrated.11 To describe patterns
and demographic determinants of
physical activity relative to recom-
mended guidelines, our study used
data from the National Institute of
Child Health and Human Develop-
ment (NICHD) Study of Early Child
Care and Youth Development birth
cohort, a large sample of US children
from 10 geographic locations. Moni-
tored physical activity data were col-
lected longitudinally beginning in
2000 when children were 9 years old
until they were 15 years old.
METHODS
Study Population
The NICHD Study of Early Child Care
and Youth Development is a multisite
study originally designed to determine
the effects of nonmaternal care on the
development of children. Participants
were recruited in 1991 from desig-
nated community hospitals at 10 uni-
versity-based data collection sites: (1)
Little Rock, Arkansas; (2) Irvine, Cali-
fornia; (3) Lawrence, Kansas; (4) Bos-
ton, Massachusetts; (5) Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania; (6) Pittsburgh, Pennsyl-
vania; (7) Charlottesville, Virginia; (8)
Seattle, Washington; (9) Hickory and

Context Decreased physical activity plays a critical role in the increase in childhood
obesity. Although at least 60 minutes per day of moderate-to-vigorous physical ac-
tivity (MVPA) is recommended, few longitudinal studies have determined the recent
patterns of physical activity of youth.
Objective To determine the patterns and determinants of MVPA of youth followed
from ages 9 to 15 years.
Design, Setting, and Participants Longitudinal descriptive analyses of the 1032
participants in the 1991-2007 National Institute of Child Health and Human Devel-
opment Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development birth cohort from 10 study
sites who had accelerometer-determined minutes of MVPA at ages 9 (year 2000), 11
(2002), 12 (2003), and 15 (2006) years. Participants included boys (517 [50.1%]) and
girls (515 [49.9%]); 76.6% white (n=791); and 24.5% (n=231) lived in low-income
families.
Main Outcome Measure Mean MVPA minutes per day, determined by 4 to 7 days
of monitored activity.
Results At age 9 years, children engaged in MVPA approximately 3 hours per day
on both weekends and weekdays. Weekday MVPA decreased by 38 minutes per year,
while weekend MVPA decreased by 41 minutes per year. By age 15 years, adoles-
cents were only engaging in MVPA for 49 minutes per weekday and 35 minutes per
weekend day. Boys were more active than girls, spending 18 and 13 more minutes
per day in MVPA on the weekdays and weekends, respectively. The rate of decrease
in MVPA was the same for boys and girls. The estimated age at which girls crossed
below the recommended 60 minutes of MVPA per day was approximately 13.1 years
for weekday activity compared with boys at 14.7 years, and for weekend activity, girls
crossed below the recommended 60 minutes of MVPA at 12.6 years compared with
boys at 13.4 years.
Conclusion In this study cohort, measured physical activity decreased significantly
between ages 9 and 15 years.

Madison, Wisconsin. Recruitment and
selectionproceduresaredescribedinde-
tail12 and study procedures are de-
scribed on the study Web site (http:
//secc.rti.org). Children were followed
from birth to 15 years with a common
study protocol, including interview,
home, school, and neighborhood ob-
servations. For all study data collection
protocols, including the accelerom-
eter, human subjects institutional re-
view boards at each university and the
data coordinating center approved vol-
untary, written informed consents from
participating families. All children gave
verbal or implied assent by wearing the
monitor. At age 9 year assessments, only
2 of the site institutional review boards
did not require assent.
Healthy newborns, discharged within
1 week of birth, of English-speaking
mothers were recruited. When the tar-
get child was 2 weeks old, attempts were
made to contact 3015 families who met
eligibility criteria to enlist their partici-
pation (FIGURE 1). Of 1526 families
scheduled, 1364 families actually com-
pleted the 1-month home visit and be-
came study participants. There were no
significant differences between these
1364 families and the 1990 US popu-
lation13 based on ethnicity (80.3% white
in US population vs 80.4% in cohort)
and household income (household in-
come information available for 1273
families; $36 520 in US population and
$37 948 in cohort). The NICHD Study
of Early Child Care and Youth Devel-
opment cohort had a slightly higher
percentage of married couple family
households than the US population
(76.7% vs 74.2%, P=.04).
Between age 1 month and 9 years, ap-
proximately 20% of the original cohort
was lost to follow-up, with moving and
lack of time the major reasons for attri-
tion (Figure 1). Dropouts were more
likely to have lower maternal education
(P.001)andbenonwhite(P=.03).Re-
tention in the sample of higher income
and white individuals might be ex-
pected to bias toward higher activity lev-
els. Between ages 9 and 15 years, the co-
hort lost an additional 8%. Differential
dropout as a function of sex, family in-
come, maternal education, or race/
ethnicity was not found between the
ages of 9 to 15 years, but children with
lower body mass index (BMI, calcu-
lated as weight in kilograms divided
by height in meters squared) at age 9
years were more likely to remain in the
sample (P=.01). Retention of children
with lower BMI might be expected to
bias toward higher levels of activity.
When we compared 9-year-old chil-
dren with activity data at age 15 years
with 9-year-old children without data at
age 15 years, we found no difference be-
tween the 2 groups in terms of their dis-
tributions of activity across the entire
range of physical activity recorded at
age 9 years. This implies we did not lose
the most active youth between the ages
of 9 and 15 years.
Height and Weight
Height and weight data were obtained
when children were 9, 11, 12, and 15
years. Height was measured following
a standardized procedure with chil-
dren standing with shoes off, feet to-
gether, and their backs to a calibrated
7-foot measuring stick fastened to a
wall. Weight was measured following
a standardized procedure using a phy-
sician's 2-beam scale. Body mass in-
dex was calculated as indicated above.
Body mass index was converted to BMI
percentile to obtain the relative posi-
tion of the child's BMI number among
children of the same sex and age.14
Demographic and Child
Characteristics
Child sex and race/ethnicity defined by
the mother were recorded at 1 month.
Race/ethnicity was defined as white or
nonwhite (black, Hispanic, Asian, and
other) and was collected to compare the
characteristics of the study sample with
the eligible population and because eth-
nicity is associated with patterns of use
of child care. Maternal education in
years was obtained by interview at 1
month. Family income collected from
parents when the child was 9 years was
converted to an income-to-needs ratio
based on federal poverty levels for each
family size (ratio of 2.0 is consid-
ered low income).15 Data collection sites
were grouped by region (Northeast:

Monitored Physical Activity
The amount of physical activity each
child engaged in across a typical week
was measured by using an accelerom-
eter(ComputerScienceApplicationsInc,
Shalimar, Florida) set so that it re-
corded minute-by-minute movement
counts. Accelerometer-determined
physical activity was offered to the en-
tirecohortatages9,11,12,and15years.
Participationinwearingthemonitorwas
high(80.1%at9years,81.6%at11years,
70.7%at12years,and68.9%at15years).
At9years,95.4%ofchildrenwhoagreed
towearmonitorshadatleast4validdays
of data; the comparable numbers at ages
11, 12, and 15 years were 96.0%, 93.0%,
and 86.9% (Figure 1). The 2 reasons
most often given for refusing to wear the
monitors were inconvenience and con-
cernsfortheappearancearoundthewaist
of the 1.51.5 inch monitor. The
slightly lower participation of adoles-
cents wearing the monitor has been
noted in other studies.16
Participants wore the monitor on a
belt around the waist during waking
hours for 7 days, including 2 weekend
days and 5 weekdays, excluding show-
ering, bathing, water sports, or con-
tact sports. These constraints on wear-
ing the monitor (common to all
accelerometer studies) resulted from
manufacturers' suggestions and safety
concerns (eg, possible bruising or in-
jury). Decisions about when to re-
move monitors were made by partici-
pants and coaches. Information from
participant activity logs and patterns of
observed counts indicate that the de-
gree of underestimation of overall ac-
tivity was minimal, and only for a few
children during 1 or 2 days of the total
activity recorded.
The number of counts recorded by
the accelerometer was used to esti-
mate the energy expended in moder-
ate (3.0-5.9 metabolic equivalent tasks
[METs]), vigorous (6.0-8.9 METs), and
very vigorous (9.0 METs) activity,
based on the age-specific equation of
Freedson et al17:
METs=[2.757  (0.0015  count)
- (0.08957  age in years) - (0.000038
 count  age in years)].
Accelerometer data were down-
loaded to the same computer used to
initialize them. A complete day of ac-
tivity data was defined as extending
from the first nonzero accelerometer
count after 5 AM until one of the fol-
lowing criteria was met: (1) 60 con-
secutive minutes of zero counts after 9
PM; (2) 30 consecutive minutes of zero
counts after 10 PM; or (3) the last non-
zero count before midnight, which-
ever came first. Once the number of
minutes for any given day was calcu-
lated, the total number of accelerom-
eter counts was computed; then in-
valid days (too short a measurement
time, implausible total count for the
time recorded, zero counts, or any rec-
ord shorter than 4 days) were flagged
for removal. Rules for removal were
based on patterns observed from vi-
sual inspection of the data for 9-year-
old children.
After calculating the total number of
minutes spent wearing the monitor and
number of minutes spent in moder-
ate, vigorous, or very vigorous activ-
ity, these minutes were summed to rep-
resent the total amount of time each
child spent each day in MVPA. The
mean minutes per day of MVPA was
calculated and used as the index of total
activity for each day the monitor was
worn. Mean minutes were then com-
puted for weekdays and for weekends.
Between-day intraclass reliability co-
efficients were calculated following the
procedures outlined in Baumgart-
ner.18 Four-day reliabilities for min-
utes of MVPA averaged 0.73, 7-day re-
liabilities averaged 0.81, and 2-weekend
day reliabilities averaged 0.54 across
ages 9, 11, 12, and 15 years. Although
the estimated reliabilities for weekend
MVPA are only moderate, the method
used to produce the estimates was not
optimal in that data collected on Sat-
urdays was compared with data col-
lected on Sundays and the structure of
activity in most US households tends
to be different on those 2 weekend days.
Because the data collected from par-
ticipants indicates no less consistency
in compliance with protocols for wear-
ing of accelerometers on weekdays and
weekends, it is likely that the week-
end data are as valid an indicator of
weekend physical activity (on aver-
age) as the weekday data are as an in-
dicator of weekday activity.
Statistical Procedures
All statistical analyses were conducted
by using SAS version 9.1.3 (SAS Insti-
tute Inc, Cary, North Carolina) and all
hypotheses were tested using 2-sided
tests. Significant differences between
children who had activity data and those
who did not were determined for all cat-
egorical variables using 2 tests and
Fisher exact test when cell counts were
small. Differences in continuous vari-
ables between these groups were deter-
mined using t tests assuming unequal
variance or the Kruskal-Wallis test.19
For descriptive purposes, minutes of
MVPA on weekdays and weekend days
were categorized as follows: less than
one-half hour, one-half to 1 hour, 1 to
2 hours, and more than 2 hours. This
permitted calculation of the percent-
age meeting the 60-minute guideline
and easily understood intervals reflect-
ing the range of MVPA over the ages
measured.
To examine weekday and weekend
patterns of MVPA longitudinally from
ages 9 to 15 years and to explore the
effects of demographic factors on ac-
tivity, 5 quadratic growth curve mod-
els20 were constructed for both week-
days and weekends by using PROC
MIXED (SAS Institute Inc). This al-
lowed the calculation of a mean trajec-
tory of weekday and weekend min-
utes of MVPA as well as the estimation
of each child's weekday and weekend
trajectory. All models used restricted
maximum likelihood estimates, which
results in a less biased estimate be-

cause both fixed and random effects are
treated as unknowns. We tested the
baseline model with a homoscedastic
error structure against the baseline
model with a heteroscedastic error
structure by using the likelihood ratio
test and determined that the heteros-
cedastic error structure improved the
model fit for both the weekday and
weekends (P.001). As a result, all
models were run assuming unequal re-
sidual variance and an unstructured co-
variance matrix.
The first (baseline) models were qua-
dratic models with age treated as a con-
tinuous variable. The weekday model
can be expressed as:
yij
=
0
 u0j
 (
1
 u1j
)(centered
ageij
)  
2
(centered ageij
)2  rij
where yij
is the expected mean week-
day minutes of MVPA at time i for child
j; centered ageij
is the child's age cen-
tered at the age 9 year assessment for
child j at time i; 
0
is the mean week-
day minutes of MVPA at the age 9 year
assessment (fixed intercept); u0j
is the
random intercept for child j; 
1
is the
linear rate of change in mean weekday
minutes of MVPA (fixed slope); u1j
is
the random linear slope for child j; 
2
is the acceleration in the change of mean
weekday minutes of MVPA (fixed ac-
celeration); and rij
is the residual term
for child j at time i.
The weekend model can be ex-
pressed as:
yij
=
0
 u0j
 
1
(centered ageij

2
(centered ageij

and differs from the weekday model in
that 
0
represents the mean weekend
minutes of MVPA at the age 9 year as-
sessment (fixed intercept) and 
2
rep-
resents the acceleration in the change
of mean weekend minutes of MVPA
(fixed acceleration). We were unable to
treat age as a random effect in the week-
end models because the intercept and
slope were highly correlated and the
variance of the centered age param-
eter was not significant, leading to con-
vergence problems. The high negative
correlation between the intercept and
linear slope indicated that the rate of
decline in mean weekend minutes of
MVPA was greater for those children
who had more minutes of MVPA on the
weekends at age 9 years.
Model 2 added sex as a fixed covar-
iate predicting intercepts and linear
slopes. Model 3 replaced sex with low
income status at age 9 years as the
covariate predicting the intercepts and
linear slopes. Model 4 examined the
combined predictive ability of sex, low
income, mother's education, race/
ethnicity, region, BMI percentile, low
income by sex interaction, low in-
come by BMI percentile interaction, and
low income by region interaction all
predicting the intercepts and linear
slopes. Model 5 examined whether sex
moderated any of the findings from
model 4 by adding interactions with sex
to all the terms in model 4; only 1 of
the interactions was significant and
model fit was not improved (data not
shown). For all models, continuous co-
variates were centered: mother's edu-
cation was centered at the mean edu-
cation level and BMI percentile was
grand mean centered. All interaction
variables were calculated by using the
centered variables.21 At each time point,
children who had valid accelerometer
data were excluded from the growth
curve model if they were missing data
on any of the covariates included in the
model. As a result, the number of chil-
dren included varies across the models.
Correlations between the estimated
random effects from the baseline model
(model 1) for weekday and weekend in-
terceptsandweekdayslopewerealsoex-
amined. Paired t tests were used to test
for mean differences between the week-
day and weekend intercepts for the first
3 models (baseline, sex, and income).

Activity Results
FIGURE 2 shows the distribution of
mean minutes of MVPA for moni-
tored physical activity during the week
and on weekends. Both the mean min-
utes of MVPA and the range of min-
utes spent in MVPA decreased as chil-
dren moved into adolescence. TABLE 2
shows the mean minutes of weekday
and weekend MVPA for boys, girls, and
the sample combined. At 9 years, chil-
dren engaged in MVPA approximately
3 hours per day on both weekdays and
weekends. By 15 years, adolescents
were only engaging in MVPA for 49
minutes per weekday and 35 minutes
per weekend day.
The percentage of children who met
the recommended activity guidelines of
60 minutes of MVPA per day on week-
days and weekends decreased from 9
years to 15 years (TABLE 3). At 9 and
11 years, almost all children met the
guidelines, but by 15 years, only 31%
and 17% met guidelines on weekdays
and weekends, respectively.
Results of Growth Curve Analyses
TABLE 4 and TABLE 5 provide the sig-
nificant findings for the growth curve
models describing weekday and week-

day and weekend MVPA showed signifi-

minutes per year, respectively; how-

ever, the significant quadratic effect
shows that the rate of decline leveled off
as children entered adolescence. There
was a high negative correlation (-0.93)
between the weekday intercept and the
linear slope at 9 years, indicating that
childrenwhoweremoreactiveat9years
tended to decrease activity more rap-
idly over time. At 9 years, children spent
more time in MVPA on the weekdays
than they did on the weekends (mean
[SD] difference, 2.22 [21.54]; 95% con-
fidence interval [CI], 0.89-3.55; t(1012)
=3.28; P=.001), but children who were
more active during the week also tended
to be more active on the weekend
(r=0.59).
Boys spent more time in MVPA at 9
years than girls did (190 vs 172 min-
utes per weekday, and 185 vs 172 min-
utes per weekend, respectively), but the
linear decrease in MVPA on the week-
daysandweekendswasthesameforboth
boys and girls (model 2). At age 9 years,
boys were more active on the weekdays
than they were on the weekends (mean
[SD] difference, 4.49 [22.09]; 95% CI,
2.56-6.41; t(506)
=4.57; P.001), al-
though girls were equally active during
the week and on weekends (mean [SD]
difference, -0.29 [19.51]; 95% CI, -1.99
to 1.42; t(505)
=-0.33; P=.74). As shown
in FIGURE 3, girls were below the rec-
ommended 60 minutes of MVPA on
weekdays at approximately 13.1 years
(95% CI, 12.9-13.3) compared with
boys at 14.7 years (95% CI, 14.3-
15.3); and for weekend activity, girls
were below the recommended 60 min-
utes of MVPA at 12.6 years (95% CI,
12.3-12.8) compared with boys at 13.4
years (95% CI, 13.2-13.7).
As model 3 indicates, children from
low-income families were more active
at age 9 years on weekdays than were
children from higher-income families
(188 vs 178 minutes per weekday); no
differences were found for weekend ac-
tivity. Income status was unrelated to
changes in weekday or weekend activ-
ity. Both children from low-income and
higher-income families spent more time
in MVPA at age 9 years on weekdays
than on weekends (low-income fami-
lies: mean [SD] difference, 4.04 [22.34];
95% CI, 1.13-6.96; t(227)

and higher-income families: mean [SD]
difference, 2.29 [20.49]; 95% CI, 0.77-
3.81; t(697)
=2.95; P=.003).
When all covariates were considered
simultaneously (model 4), boys, chil-
dren from low-income families,
and children with lower BMI percen-
tiles were shown to be significantly
more active at 9 years on both week-
days and weekends. Sex was the stron-

decrease from the approximate mean
BMI percentile of 65 was associated
with an additional less than 1 minute
per day per year decrease in MVPA.
Regional differences accounted for an
additional decrease in weekday MVPA
of less than 4 minutes per day per
year.
COMMENT
In our longitudinal study where physi-
cal activity was carefully measured
using accelerometers from ages 9 to 15
years in a large geographically diverse
population of US children, we ob-
served a steep decrease in MVPA with
age. At 9 years, almost all children were
well above the recommended 60 min-
utes of MVPA on both weekdays and
weekends, but by 15 years only 31%
met the guidelines on weekdays and
only 17% on weekends. Although age
and sex were the most important de-
terminants of MVPA from 9 to 15 years,
low family income, lower BMI percen-
tile, and residing in the Midwest or
South also significantly increased the

rate of decline in MVPA. Nonetheless,
when differences for income, BMI per-
centile, and geographic region were
translated into minutes per day per year,
the magnitude of effect was small. Each
of these effects was linked to a de-
crease in MVPA of less than 4 minutes
per day per year on the weekdays and
less than 5 minutes per day per year on
the weekends.
DecreasinglevelsofMVPAhavebeen
showninotherstudies.Themostrecent
NationalHealthandNutritionalExami-
nation Survey (NHANES) data22 using
accelerometer-measuredphysicalactiv-
ity in a representative US sample also
revealedthatphysicalactivitydecreases
dramaticallyacrossagegroupsbetween
childhood and adolescence and con-
tinues to decrease into adulthood. For
example, using a higher cutoff of METs
required to determine MVPA, the
NHANES results showed that 42% of
children aged 6 to 11 years obtained the
recommended 60 minutes per day of
physical activity, whereas only 8% of
adolescentsachievedthisgoal.22 Among
adults, adherence to the recommenda-
tion to obtain 30 minutes per day of
physical activity is less than 5%.22 In
addition, earlier cross-sectional stud-
ies conducted on smaller samples of
both US and European youth docu-
menteddecreasingactivitywithincreas-
ing age, with evidence indicating that
boys are more active than girls.23-28 The
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention Youth Risk Behavior Surveys
andotherlargesamplestudiesthatmea-
sure physical activity using self-
report29,30 also find activity to decrease
with age, but the overall amount of
MVPA reported in these studies tends
to be much higher than accelerometer-
based studies.
A particular strength of our study lies
in the repeated examination and longi-
tudinal analysis of physical activity dur-
ing both weekdays and weekend days at
ages 9, 11, 12, and 15 years for a cohort
bornwhentheobesityepidemicwaswell
under way. Another strength derives
from our use of objective accelerometer
measurement of physical activity in a
much larger sample with a higher mean
adherence rate for wearing the monitor
over 7 days (55%) than the recent
NHANES study (26%).22
Our study has limitations. First, our
sample is not nationally representa-
tive because the study sites were se-
lected on the basis of National Insti-
tutes of Health review; therefore, the
findings are not fully generalizable to
the US population. That said, the re-
cruited sample closely matched the US
population at the time of initial recruit-
ment with regard to income and race/
ethnicity. Moreover, the sample was di-
verseinethnicity,socioeconomicstatus,
and household membership. Unfortu-
nately, there were relatively small num-
bers of certain racial/ethnic minori-
ties, limiting the ability to analyze
subsamples.
Second, an unavoidable bias is due
to the fact that accelerometers tend to
underestimate activity of youth who fre-
quently engage in contact sports or
swimming because the accelerometer
is not worn at these times. Whether the
numbers of such children increase with
age is unknown, but this factor is un-
likely to account for the dramatic de-
crease in overall activity noted. Chil-
dren would have had to engage in
contact sports for a significant num-
ber of hours every monitored day to in-
fluence the results for overall activity.
Third, separating age from secular
trends in longitudinal data is techni-
cally difficult. Because of the historic
timing of data collection for this study
(ie, during the rapid escalation of obe-
sity in the United States), it is possible
that declining trajectories in MVPA may
represent a secular rather than a devel-
opmental phenomenon. However, ac-
celerometer data collected as part of the
NHANES cross-sectional study in a
single year (2003) showed similar pat-
terns of decline in physical activity in
children between ages 6 to 11 years and
ages 15 to 19 years.
A fourth potential limitation per-
tains to the uncertain reliability of week-
end MVPA data. Because the pattern of

decline on weekends mirrors the pat-
tern of decline observed on weekdays,
it appears that the weekend measure is
a valid indicator. Generally speaking,
children appear to be slightly less ac-
tive on weekends than on weekdays,
suggesting that families may not be en-
couraging children to engage in active
play or that weekend competing pri-
orities result in less activity.
Accelerometers are a new method to
measure physical activity for public
health purposes. The technology has
continued to develop and has im-
proved since our study was initiated in
2000. There is no single accepted pro-
tocol across studies for setting acceler-
ometer-based cutoff points for MVPA.31
The study by Pate et al32 found that ap-
plying different cutoff points resulted in
significant differences in the classifica-
tion of sixth grade girls meeting the 60-
minuterecommendation(estimatesvar-
ied from 1% to 11% to 87.7%,
respectively, depending on whether the
cutoff points were 4.6 MET, 3.8 MET,
or 3.0 MET). In our study, we used the
3.0 MET cutoff, reflecting the most lib-
eral cutoff point. However, striking de-
creases in activity were observed from
9 to 15 years. Overall, by 15 years, a mi-
nority of adolescents were meeting the
recommended 60 minutes per day of
MVPA, even by the most liberal stan-
dard. Other than the study by Strong
et al,9 there is limited data substantiat-
ing the 60-minute recommendation in
terms of important clinical outcomes.
Thus, one task for future research in this
area is to examine the amount of MVPA
required to affect child health out-
comes.
More research is also needed to
understand the reasons for such sub-
stantial decreases in youth activity. Fur-
ther study and more precise descrip-
tions of the immediate activity
environment,suchaswhetheryouthare
located in urban, suburban, or rural
areas; availability of safe places to be
active; and quality of school-based
physical education may explain
some of the individual and regional
differences noted in this and other
studies.
The data in our cohort confirm a sig-
nificant decrease of activity from ages
9 to 15 years in the United States. This
decrease augurs poorly for levels of
physical activity in US adults and po-
tentially for health over the course of
a lifetime. Consequently, there is a need
for program and policy action as early
as possible at the family, community,
school, health care, and governmental
levels to address the problem of de-
creasing physical activity with increas-
ing age.4
