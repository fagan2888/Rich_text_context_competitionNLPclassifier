Article
In the last decade, research supporting associations between
adolescent and adult attachment models, general psychoso-
cial adaptation, and disposition to distress in nonclinical
samples has flourished (Fortuna & Roisman, 2008;
Mallinckrodt & Wei, 2005). Specifically, attachment insecu-
rity in both adolescence and adulthood has been concurrently
linked to symptoms of psychopathology. However, few stud-
ies have examined longitudinal models linking these vari-
ables (Lee & Hankin, 2009), thus limiting our understanding
of the developmental precursors to adult adaptation. This
study thus tested the long-term influence of attachment inse-
curity toward parents and peers in adolescence and toward
romantic partners in young adulthood on the development of
adult psychopathology. Furthermore, although theoretical
models indicate that associations between earlier attachment
models and later adaptation lie in the specific emotion regu-
lation strategies adopted by individuals to deal with distress
(Carlson & Sroufe, 1995; Chaplin & Cole, 2005; DeKlyen &
Greenberg, 2008), this assumption has yet to be empirically
tested. Accordingly, the main objective of this study was to
investigate associations between attachment insecurity in
adolescence and young adulthood and global symptoms of
psychopathology in later adulthood. We further tested the
role of emotion regulation strategies as mediators of these
longitudinal associations.
Attachment Theory: Childhood,
Adolescence, and Young Adulthood
According to attachment theory, internal working models
developed in response to the quality of repeated attachment-
related parent­child interactions influence the child's expec-
tations and beliefs about the self, others, and the environment
(Bolwby, 1988; Bretherton, 1987; Main, Kaplan, & Cassidy,
1985). The classic work of Ainsworth (Ainsworth, Blehar,
Waters, & Wall, 1978) identified three attachment catego-
ries: secure, insecure-avoidant, and insecure-ambivalent,
based on child separation­reunion behavior with the primary
caregiver. Children who have experienced interactions with a
sensitive caregiver who consistently responds to their attach-
ment needs are more likely to develop a secure attachment
model consisting of self-representations of competency and
perceptions of others as dependable and available in times of
need (Bretherton, 1987).

Attachment and Emotion Regulation
Strategies in Predicting Adult
Psychopathology
Katherine Pascuzzo1, Ellen Moss1,
and Chantal Cyr1
Abstract
This study tested a 10-year longitudinal model examining the role of adolescent attachment, adult romantic attachment, and
emotion regulation strategies on adult symptoms of psychopathology. Fifty individuals completed a measure of attachment
security to parents and peers at age 14, measures of romantic attachment and emotion regulation at age 22, and a measure
of psychopathology at age 24. Results revealed that attachment insecurity to parents in adolescence was associated with
greater symptoms of psychopathology in adulthood, and emotion-focused strategies partially mediated this association.
Anxious romantic attachment was also related to psychopathology, an association that was fully mediated by emotion-
focused strategies. The long-term mechanism involved in the association between earlier attachment and future adaptation
will be discussed.

Children with an insecure-avoidant attachment relation-
ship with their primary caregiver have learned that express-
ing distress or the need for proximity in stressful situations is
likely to evoke rejection from their caregiver. To protect
themselves from this possible rejection, avoidant children
inhibit attachment-related behaviors, such as the expression
of negative emotions and proximity seeking (Main &
Cassidy, 1988). Based on their experiences, avoidant chil-
dren may view others as untrustworthy and develop positive
but unrealistic self-perceptions, with an excessive focus on
their ability to overcome difficult situations on their own.
Insecure-ambivalent children, however, have experienced
inconsistent or unpredictable caregiving, leading them to
worry about the availability of their attachment figure to
respond to their manifestations of distress. In response to their
caregiving experiences, ambivalent children learn to exagger-
ate and intensify distress signals to maintain parental proxim-
ity (Main & Cassidy, 1988). Accordingly, these children may
develop self-perceptions as being helpless and unlovable,
and view others as being unreliable.
Main and Solomon (1990) later identified a fourth attach-
ment pattern, which they called insecure-disorganized.
Disorganized child attachment is believed to develop in the
presence of frightening or frightened parental behavior
(Madigan, Moran, Schuengel, Otten, & Pederson, 2007).
According to Main and Hesse (1990), disorganized children
are caught at the heart of an important dilemma in which
their source of comfort also represents their source of fear.
Consequently, these children show confused and contradic-
tory withdrawal and approach behaviors toward their attach-
ment figure when distressed. Children with disorganized
attachment describe themselves the most negatively of all
the attachment groups, show the highest level of affect dys-
regulation, and lack organized and coherent attachment strat-
egies for seeking parental proximity in times of distress
(Main & Solomon, 1990).
Similar systems exist for classifying adolescent attachment
models, using both categorical and continuous dimensions of
security (see Main & Goldwyn, 1985, for details on the Adult
Attachment Interview), while others rely solely on continuous
scales of security (e.g., Armsden & Greenberg, 1987).
Accordingly, a more secure adolescent is likely to be involved
in a goal-corrected parent­teen relationship, which allows for
increased independence from parents to attain normative age-
appropriate social goals (e.g., development of social relation-
ships with peers, greater exploration of a larger environment,
etc.) while still maintaining contact with parents through open
communication (Allen, 2008; Armsden & Greenberg, 1987;
Kobak & Duemmler, 1994). However, greater adolescent
attachment insecurity toward parents, in general, is marked by
feelings of resentment and alienation, as well as emotional
detachment (Armsden & Greenberg, 1987).
Although parents remain the adolescent's primary attach-
ment figure, close peers increasingly fulfill certain attachment
needs during this crucial developmental period (Allen, 2008;
Armsden & Greenberg, 1987; Zeifman & Hazan, 2008). In
line with this idea, Zeifman and Hazan (2008), who investi-
gated participants'(aged 6 to 17) preferred attachment figure
relating to the four components of attachment (i.e., proximity
seeking, safe haven, separation distress, and secure base),
reported that nearly all sample participants preferred spend-
ing time with peers over parents. Moreover, between the ages
of 8 and 14, participants increasingly preferred receiving
comfort and emotional support from peers, although parents
remained the primary sources of separation distress and
bases of security. By late adolescence, the authors noted that
romantic partners were identified as the overall preferred
attachment figures. During late adolescence and early adult-
hood, there is thus a subsequent restructuring of the attach-
ment hierarchy with romantic partners becoming the most
sought-out attachment figures (Hazan & Shaver, 1987;
Zeifman & Hazan, 2008).
Adult romantic attachment can be measured along two
orthogonal dimensions, which assess feelings and thoughts
toward romantic partners in general, that is, avoidance of inti-
macy and anxiety over abandonment (Brennan, Clark, &
Shaver, 1998). Avoidantly attached individuals generally dis-
trust their romantic partners and are uncomfortable with inti-
macy, whereas anxiously attached individuals are preoccupied
by thoughts of abandonment by their partners. Taken together,
parents, peers, and romantic partners represent important
attachment figures at specific phases of development.
Attachment and Psychopathology
In addition to influencing one's perceptions of self and oth-
ers, internal working models of early attachment relation-
ships influence the individuals' resilience and vulnerability
to stressful life events, consequently affecting their well-
being and mental health (Bolwby, 1988). Insecure adult
attachment models have been found to be associated with
more inflexible perceptions of self (Lopez, 1996), as well as
more negative and distorted views and expectations of others
(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2008). Based on these distorted cog-
nitive models, individuals may perceive and experience dif-
ficult and stressful events in a more negative manner (e.g.,
anger, hurt, disappointment, sadness, jealousy, helplessness),
potentially exacerbating their experience of distress (Collins,
1996). In line with this idea, attachment security during
childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood has been
shown to be a protective factor against psychopathology and
related symptoms such as anxiety, depression, dissociation,
and antisocial behaviors (Davila, Ramsay, Stroud, &
Steinberg, 2005; Dozier, Stovall-McClough, & Albus, 2008).
In contrast, internalized representations of self and others
developed in response to insensitive caregiving are thought
to increase the risk of developmental maladaptation across
the life span (DeKlyen & Greenberg, 2008; Moss, Bureau,
St-Laurent, & Tarabulsy, 2011). Therefore, although attach-
ment insecurity is not considered a disorder in and of itself, it
Pascuzzo et al. 3
is viewed as an important risk factor for adult psychopathol-
ogy, including symptoms of anxiety, depression, dissocia-
tion, and antisocial behaviors (Bolwby, 1988; Davila et al.,
2005; Dozier et al., 2008).
Adolescence is a particularly interesting developmental
phase to study with respect to attachment insecurity and psy-
chopathology given that, as previously stated, different
attachment figures (i.e., parents and peers) play an active
role in the teen's life (Armsden & Greenberg, 1987; Zeifman
& Hazan, 2008). Concurrent and prospective studies with
adolescent samples have already linked attachment insecu-
rity to higher instances of depression and behavior problems
(Laible, Carlo, & Raffaelli, 2000; Lee & Hankin, 2009). For
example, Lee and Hankin (2009) found that both anxious
and avoidant attachment orientations to parents and close
peers in adolescence predicted prospective increases in
depressive and anxiety symptoms over a 5-month period.
However, this study was limited in that it did not assess the
independent contribution of attachment security to parents
and peers, but rather used a global attachment score. In two
other studies that included independent parent and peer
scores, both attachment relationships were found to be con-
currently associated with psychopathology: General insecu-
rity was associated with greater depression and anxiety
(Muris, Meesters, van Melick, & Zwambag, 2001), whereas
security was related to greater overall adjustment (i.e.,
greater sympathy and lower aggression and depression;
Laible et al., 2000) in adolescence. In these two studies, the
contribution of attachment to parents and to peers in relation
to psychopathology was similar. However, in a study by
Wilkinson and Walford (2001), the authors found that only
adolescent attachment security to parents, not to peers, was
related to lower distress. Taken together, study findings are
somewhat inconsistent with respect to the distinct influence
of attachment insecurity to parents and peers on the develop-
ment of symptoms of psychopathology. Moreover, given the
cross-sectional nature of these studies, our understanding of
the longitudinal influence of these specific relationships on
later adult psychopathology is limited.
Associations between greater attachment insecurity in
adulthood and general psychopathology have also been
investigated, although findings differ across studies. Some
studies report that both the anxious and avoidant attachment
orientations are positively correlated with internalizing,
externalizing, and overall symptom severity (Fortuna &
Roisman, 2008; Mallinckrodt & Wei, 2005). Others find
stronger associations with symptoms of psychopathology for
the anxious dimension than for the avoidant, particularly
when internalizing symptoms (i.e., anxiety, depression) are
measured as outcomes (Brenning, Soenens, Braet, &
Bosmans, 2011; Lopez, Mauricio, Gormley, Simko, &
Berger, 2001; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2007).
In summary, at both adolescence and adulthood, attach-
ment insecurity has been linked to various symptoms of
psychopathology. However, no study to date has examined
associations across these two developmental periods.
Moreover, there are inconsistencies in the adolescent litera-
ture concerning the relative influence of attachment to par-
ents versus peers and, in the adult literature, of anxious
versus avoidant orientations on outcome measures. In addi-
tion, most studies have focused on the association between
attachment and symptoms of depression and anxiety (Lee
& Hankin, 2009; Lopez et al., 2001; Muris et al., 2001),
despite the fact that the assessment of global symptoms of
psychopathology, versus specific disorders, may be particu-
larly appropriate when studying nonclinical populations.
Attachment, Emotion Regulation
Strategies, and Psychopathology
Attachment theory provides a strong framework for under-
standing associations between the quality of primary caregiver­
child relationships and mental and psychological well-being
over time. Within this framework, it would seem that emotion
regulation strategies represent important contributors to this
association. Specifically, based on attachment theory, the par-
ent­child relationship influences the development of emotion
regulation strategies thought to be important for later adult
adaptation (Bowlby, 1982; DeKlyen & Greenberg, 2008).
According to Thompson (1994), "Emotion regulation con-
sists of the extrinsic and intrinsic processes responsible for
monitoring, evaluating, and modifying emotional reactions,
especially their intensive and temporal features, to accom-
plish one's goals" (p. 28-29). Based on attachment theory,
individuals adopt specific emotion regulation strategies to
accomplish their goal of dealing with distress that is in accor-
dance with their internal working model of attachment
(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2007, 2008). When faced with distress
or stressful situations, individuals will rely on these strategies
to regulate their emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. For
example, individuals with an avoidant attachment are more
likely to use deactivating strategies to deal with stress-related
situations, which include denial of emotion-related thoughts
and information, as well as suppression of emotional expres-
sivity (Kobak, Cole, Ferenz-Gillies, Fleming, & Gamble,
1993; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2007, 2008). Avoidant individu-
als adopt these strategies to maintain their attachment system
deactivated because activation of this system would cause
them to relive past or present experiences of distress in
response to a distant and rejecting attachment figure
(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2007). Fear, anxiety, anger, sadness,
shame, guilt, and distress are especially inhibited as they
relate to feelings of vulnerability, contradicting the avoidant
individual's self-perceptions of competency, superiority, and
strength (Hesse, 1999). Although denial of emotional states
and inhibition of emotional expressivity are adaptive for
avoidant individuals in the short term, over time, they can
potentially contribute to psychopathology, including anxiety
disorders (Zeijlmans van Emmichoven, van IJzendoorn, de
Ruiter, & Brosschot, 2003), eating disorders (Ward et al.,
4 SAGE Open
2001), and antisocial behaviors (Rosenstein & Horowitz,
1996), given that negative emotions are not openly communi-
cated and accurately evaluated but are rather suppressed
(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2007).
However, anxiously attached individuals are more inclined
to use hyperactivating strategies, which include exaggeration
of threats, over-dependence on the attachment figure, and
hypervigilance to cues of danger and abandonment, when
faced with stress-related situations (Mikulincer & Florian,
1995; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2007, 2008). Focusing on poten-
tially negative cues and emotions causes these individuals to
link negative experiences together so that one negative
thought leads to a string of others (Mikulincer & Shaver,
2008). The anxiously attached individual is therefore caught
in a vicious cycle whereby his or her attention to negative
information leads to negative thoughts and ruminations,
which in turn intensifies their feelings of anxiety, and thus
their focus on potentially negative cues. Although the use of
hyperactivating and emotion-focused strategies (e.g., self-
blame, self-criticism, ruminations, focus on negative emo-
tions, and feelings of helplessness) by anxiously attached
individuals is somewhat effective for maintaining the atten-
tion of attachment figures, these strategies may serve to inten-
sify negative feelings, such as anger, helplessness, and stress,
which have been found to contribute to the development of
symptoms of psychopathology, including depression and
anxiety disorders (Cantazaro & Wei, 2010; Hankin &
Abramson, 2001; Lopez et al., 2001).
Given that insecure attachment models have been shown
to be related to symptoms of psychopathology, and that these
models promote the use of specific emotion regulation strate-
gies associated with qualitative differences in attachment
relationships (e.g., avoidantly attached individuals avoid
expressing their emotions at all cost, while anxiously attached
individuals are intensively focused on their negative emo-
tions), these strategies may be important mediating variables
explaining the association between earlier attachment insecu-
rity and adult functioning (Carlson & Sroufe, 1995; Chaplin
& Cole, 2005; DeKlyen & Greenberg, 2008). In line with this
idea, problematic strategies such as emotional reactivity and
difficulties in identifying and communicating feelings (Lopez
et al., 2001; Mallinckrodt & Wei, 2005; Wei, Heppner, &
Mallinckrodt, 2003) have already been identified as media-
tors of the association between insecure attachment and psy-
chopathology, particularly depression and anxiety. However,
these studies are limited in that samples were restricted to
specific populations (undergraduates) and relied on concur-
rent data only. For example, using a sample of undergradu-
ates, Wei et al. (2003) found that the perceived ability to
overcome difficulties fully mediated the association between
attachment anxiety and psychological distress (including anx-
iety and depression symptoms), whereas it only partially
mediated the relationship between avoidant attachment and
distress. Similarly, Lopez et al. (2001) reported that ineffec-
tive strategies (i.e., strong emotional responses, impulsivity,
and distortions) partially mediated the positive association
between anxious attachment and distress (combined depres-
sion and anxiety), whereas avoidant attachment was not a pre-
dictor of distress. Overall, reviewed studies, although
cross-sectional, indicate that the association between attach-
ment insecurity and psychopathology is indirect and may be
mediated by different emotion regulation strategies. Not only
will we attempt to replicate these concurrent mediation mod-
els using longitudinal data, but we will also test these models
using diverse measures of attachment throughout develop-
ment (toward parents and peers in adolescence and toward
romantic partners in young adulthood).
The Current Study
Despite the evidence for concurrent associations between
insecure attachment and psychopathology at adolescence
and young adulthood (Fortuna & Roisman, 2008; Lee &
Hankin, 2009; Lopez et al., 2001; Mallinckrodt & Wei, 2005;
Muris et al., 2001), to our knowledge, no study has tested a
developmental model across these periods. In this study,
attachment was evaluated at two different time points (Time
1: 14 years of age, and Time 2: 22 years of age) and in rela-
tion to three distinct attachment figures (Time 1: parents and
peers; Time 2: romantic partners). Given that the sample was
nonclinical, a global index of symptoms of psychopathology
was used as the outcome variable. The use of a normative
rather than clinical sample is better suited for assessing the
potential long-term associations between earlier attachment
and later psychopathology as the presence of other potential
influential variables, such as low family socio-economic sta-
tus, parental psychopathology, and/or substance abuse in
high-risk samples, can make it difficult to tease apart the
unique influence of early insecurity on later functioning.
The first objective of this study was to test a longitudinal
model evaluating the relative contribution of attachment
insecurity toward parents and peers during adolescence
(Time 1), anxious and avoidant romantic attachment orienta-
tions in young adulthood (Time 2), and emotion regulation
strategies in young adulthood (Time 2) to self-reported
symptoms of psychopathology in adulthood (Time 3). Based
on past empirical evidence (Lee & Hankin, 2009; Muris
et al., 2001), we expected greater insecurity at both Time 1
and Time 2 to be associated with greater symptoms of psy-
chopathology. In line with the findings of Wilkinson and
Walford (2001), we also expected adolescent attachment to
parents to be more strongly related to adult psychopathology
than adolescent attachment to peers. This hypothesis is also
supported by the theoretical assumption that internal work-
ing models are based more prominently on caregiving expe-
riences with parents rather than peers (Bolwby, 1988).
Given that emotion regulation strategies have also been
linked to psychopathology (Lopez et al., 2001; Mallinckrodt
& Wei, 2005), we expected attachment-related emotion regu-
lation strategies, specifically emotion-focused strategies and
Pascuzzo et al. 5
emotional expressivity, to be related to adult symptoms of
psychopathology. More precisely, we predicted that greater
use of emotion-focused strategies (i.e., self-blame, rumina-
tions, focus on negative emotions) and lower emotional
expressivity (i.e., tendency to outwardly display and com-
municate emotions) would be related to greater symptoms of
psychopathology.
The second study objective was to test mediation models
in which attachment orientations (in adolescence and adult-
hood) would be related to later adult psychopathology via the
use of emotion regulation strategies. Specifically, we
expected that greater insecurity to parents and peers would
be associated with greater symptoms of psychopathology in
adulthood via the use of greater emotion-focused strategies
and lower emotional expressivity. Based on the hyperactivat-
ing and deactivating strategies of the anxious and avoidant
attachment models, respectively, we also expected romantic
attachment in adulthood to be related to greater symptoms of
psychopathology via the use of emotion-focused strategies
for the anxiously attached and via the use of lower emotional
expressivity for the avoidantly attached.
Method
Participants
Participants were 50 young adults (33 women and 17 men;
M age = 23.5, SD = .88) taking part in an ongoing longitudi-
nal study of developmental adaptation as a function of the
parent­child relationship (see Moss, Smolla, Cyr, Dubois-
Comtois, Mazzarello, & Berthiaume, 2006). Participants
were part of a larger community sample that had been ini-
tially recruited through various daycares in diverse socio-
economic areas of Montreal, Canada. The original
longitudinal study began when children were 4 years of age.
The present study included data collected from adolescence,
that is, when participants were 14, 22, and 24 years of age,
respectively, referred to in this article as Time 1 (T1), Time 2
(T2), and Time 3 (T3).
At Time 1 (M age = 13.7 years, SD = .64, n = 79, 45 girls),
10% of families reported earning less than $20,000 (figures
represent Canadian dollars), 37% between $20,000 and
$50,000, and 53% reported earning $50,000 and above.
Seventy percent of the participants'mothers obtained college-
or university-level training, and 32% of the sample adoles-
cents were living in a mother-headed single-parent family. At
Time 2 (M age = 21.5 years, SD = 0.81, n = 66, 43 young
women), 50% of young adults reported earning less than
$10,000, 45% between $10,000 and $30,000, and 5%
reported earning $30,000 and above. Thirty-two percent of
the participants had completed a high school degree, and the
rest had some college- or university-level training. Seventy-
three percent of the sample participants were still living with
their families, whereas the rest where living on their own. At
Time 3 (M age = 23.5 years, SD = .88, N = 50, 33 young
women), 22% of young adults reported earning less than
$10,000, 48% between $10,000 and $30,000, and 30%
reported earning $30,000 and above. Twenty-five percent of
the participants had completed a high school degree, and the
rest had some college- or university-level training. Forty-two
percent of the sample participants were still living with their
families of origin, whereas the rest were living on their own.
At T1, the sample included 79 participants. From T1 to
T2, 13 (16.5%) were lost to attrition: 5 never responded to
repeated contacts initiated by the project staff, 2 no longer
had valid phone numbers, 1 moved away, 4 refused to par-
ticipate, and 1 accepted participation but did not show up to
the laboratory visit. Out of the 66 participants who com-
pleted T2 measures, 10 participants had to be dropped from
analyses due to incomplete attachment and emotion regula-
tion data sets (no differences on socio-demographic variables
were found between these 10 participants and the remaining
56). From T2 to T3, six participants were lost to attrition
(never responded to repeated contacts initiated by the project
staff).ANOVAs and chi-square analyses of socio-demographic
variables (age, gender, and family income) and main vari-
ables (adolescent attachment to parents and peers at T1 and
adult attachment and emotion regulation strategies at Time
2) comparing the final study sample of 50 participants with
the 29 who were lost to attrition or dropped from Time 1 to
Time 3 revealed no significant differences. Moreover, addi-
tional analysis (ANOVAs and chi-square) revealed no sig-
nificant differences in age, gender, and family income at
initial assessment (when children were 4 years of age; n =
186) between the 50 participants who remained in the longi-
tudinal project and the 136 who were lost over 20 years.
Procedure
Time 1.An initial phone call informing participants of the
adolescent phase of the longitudinal study was followed by a
laboratory visit for each adolescent during which the Inven-
tory of Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA; Armsden &
Greenberg, 1987) questionnaire was completed. Mothers of
participants completed a socio-demographic questionnaire
sent to them by mail.
Time 2. Participants were contacted by phone and invited to
the first of two laboratory visits (approximately 1 month
apart), during which a socio-demographic questionnaire and
the Experiences in Close Relationships (ECR; Brennan et al.,
1998) measure were completed. During the second laboratory
visit, participants completed the two emotion regulation mea-
sures: the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS;
Endler & Parker, 1994) and the Emotional Expressivity Scale
(EES; Kring, Smith, & Neale, 1994). The emotion-focused
subscale of the CISS was chosen given its positive anticipated
overlap with the hyperactivating strategy of anxiously
attached individuals, while the EES was chosen for its nega-
tive anticipated association with the deactivating strategy of
6 SAGE Open
the avoidantly attached. Participants also completed a modi-
fied version of the Life Event Questionnaire (Norbeck, 1984)
to account for the presence of stressful life events throughout
development.
Time 3. Participants were contacted by phone and asked to
complete questionnaires that would be sent to them by mail.
These included a socio-demographic questionnaire, the
Symptom Checklist 90­Revised (SCL-90-R; Derogatis,
1983), and a modified versions of the Life Event Question-
naire (Norbeck, 1984) to account for the presence of stressful
life events since the last laboratory assessment.
Measures
Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA).The IPPA
(Armsden & Greenberg, 1987) is a 24-item self-reported
questionnaire evaluating adolescents' positive and negative
perceptions of affective and cognitive dimensions of their
relationships with their parents and peers (e.g., my parents/
my friends accept me as I am; if my parents/friends know
something is bothering me, they ask me about it). Partici-
pants rated each item on a 4-point scale ranging from 1
("almost always true") to 4 ("almost never true"). Ratings
were then summed, generating two global indices of attach-
ment insecurity: 1 for parents (12 items; alpha current study
= .83) and the other for peers (12 items: alpha current study
= .84). A high global score reflected a high level of attach-
ment insecurity. The IPPA has excellent psychometric quali-
ties (average internal consistency and test­retest reliability
scores: .90) and is widely used within adolescent attachment
research (see Allen, Porter, McFarland, McElhaney, &
Marsh, 2007; Smith, Calam, & Bolton 2009; Tambelli,
Laghi, Odorisio, & Notari, 2012).
Experiences in Close Relationships (ECR).The self-reported
ECR (Brennan et al., 1998) consists of 36 items, which mea-
sure romantic attachment along two dimensions: avoidance
of intimacy (18 items: alpha current study = .90; for exam-
ple, I prefer not to show a partner how I feel deep down) and
anxiety over abandonment (18 items: alpha current study =
.90; for example, I worry about being abandoned). Partici-
pants responded to each item using a 7-point scale from 1
("strongly disagree") to 7 ("strongly agree"), rating the
extent to which each item is descriptive of how they usually
feel and behave in romantic relationships. Ratings were then
averaged to compute scores for each dimension. High scores
reflected more anxious and avoidant attachment orientations.
The ECR is well-validated and widely used within the adult
attachment literature (for a review, see Mikulincer & Shaver,
2007; Chapter 10).
Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS).The CISS
(Endler & Parker, 1994) is a 48-item self-administered ques-
tionnaire, which assesses four strategies of coping styles:
task-focused, emotion-focused, distraction, and social diver-
sion. For the present study, only data obtained for the
emotion-focused scale (16 items: alpha current study = .87)
were included in the present study, as the others did not per-
tain to our research questions. Specifically, emotion-focused
regulation refers to strategies that monitor emotional distress
in response to a stressful situation (e.g., I blame myself for
not knowing what to do; I focus on the insufficient resources
at my disposal to deal with the problem; I get angry with
myself; I get angry with others). Respondents rated each
item on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 ("not at all") to 5
("very much"). Ratings were then summed to compute a
total score. A high score reflected greater use of the strategy.
The CISS has good internal consistency with alpha coeffi-
cients ranging from .76 to .91 (Endler & Parker, 1994). Fur-
thermore, this measure is widely used as a measure of
emotion regulation (see Benoit, Bouthillier, Moss, Rousseau,
& Brunet, 2010; Mc Elroy & Hevey, 2014).
Emotional Expressivity Scale (EES).The EES (Kring et al.,
1994) is a 17-item self-report questionnaire measuring the
extent to which people outwardly display their emotions
(alpha current study = .93). Respondents rated each item (e.g.,
I display my emotions to other people; other people believe
me to be very emotional) on a 6-point scale ranging from 1
("strongly disagree") to 6 ("strongly agree"). Ratings were
then summed to compute a total score. A high score reflected
greater emotional expressivity. Reliability studies (Kring
et al., 1994) show the EES to be internally consistent with an
alpha coefficient of .91. Kring et al. reported a 4-week test­
retest correlation of .90. As a result, the EES has been used in
numerous studies for assessing emotion regulation (see Ben-
oit et al., 2010; Niles, Haltom, Mulvenna, Lieberman, &
Stanton, 2014; Vogel, Wade, & Hackler, 2008).
The Symptom Checklist 90­Revised (SCL-90-R).The SCL-
90-R (Derogatis, 1983) is a psychiatric self-report inventory.
The 90 items included in the questionnaire were scored on a
5-point scale from 0 ("not at all") to 4 ("extremely"), indicat-
ing the rate of occurrence of the 90 symptoms in the last 7
days. Symptoms can be classified into nine dimensions
including somatization, obsessive­compulsive, interpersonal
sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety,
paranoid ideation, and psychoticism. The questionnaire also
generates a global severity score, representing the average
rating for the 90 items (alpha current study = .96). This
global score was used in the analyses as an index of general
experience of symptoms of psychopathology (correlation
coefficients among SCL-90-R scales in the current study
ranging from .39 to .77). A high global score reflected more
symptoms of psychopathology. This scale is particularly use-
ful for nonclinical patients who may be less symptomatic of
specific disorders. Accordingly, the measure had been vali-
dated with adult nonclinical patients (Derogatis, 1983),
which represents the sample of the current article.

Stressful life events.A modified version of the Life Event
Questionnaire (Norbeck, 1984) was created for the purpose
of the current study (72 items at T2; 40 items at T3). Partici-
pants indicated whether or not they experienced the specified
event, in what year, whether it was a positive or negative
experience, and the amount of impact the event had on his or
her life ranging from 0 ("no effect") to 3 ("great effect"). The
following events were retained for the purpose of the present
study as these events can be expected to influence one's
experience of psychopathology: (a) sickness of a close
friend, family member, and/or of the self, (b) death of a close
friend or family member, (c) parental divorce or separation,
(d) the experience of a break-up.
Socio-demographic questionnaire.This 10-item questionnaire
was created by the research team to assess participants'
demographic information pertaining to the self and the fam-
ily (e.g., age, gender, income, education).
Results
Preliminary Analyses
Preliminary correlation analyses performed to identify pos-
sible covariates such as age, years of education, and income
level in relation to the global psychopathology index revealed
no significant associations (rs between -.20 and -.17). Given
past findings showing consistent associations between gen-
der and the prevalence of symptoms of psychopathology
(Barlow, 2002), a t-test was conducted to assess differences
between men and women on the global psychopathology
index. Results revealed no significant association between
gender and psychopathology, t(48) = 1.24 n.s. Furthermore,
to assess the possible influence of stressful life events on
adult symptoms of psychopathology, a risk index was cre-
ated based on the presence (1) or absence (0) of stressful life
events as reported at T2 and T3 (events reported at T2 and T3
were summed). Correlation analyses revealed no significant
associations (r = .25, p = .08) between risk and psychopa-
thology. Therefore, socio-economic variables, gender, and
risk were not controlled for in subsequent analyses.
Correlation analyses were then conducted between the
independent (adolescent and young adult attachment, and
emotion regulation strategies) and dependent (global index
of psychopathology) variables. Table 1 presents correlation
coefficients as well as means, standard deviations, and range
for study variables. Results show insecure adolescent
attachment toward parents, anxious romantic attachment,
and emotion-focused regulation strategies to be positively
related to adult symptoms of psychopathology. Adolescent
attachment to peers, avoidant attachment, and emotional
expressivity were not.
Attachment and emotion regulation strategies as predictors of
adult psychopathology.In line with our first hypothesis, we
tested a complete longitudinal model to assess the long-term
associations between adolescent and young adult attach-
ment, emotion regulation strategies, and adult symptoms of
psychopathology. A multiple regression analysis was there-
fore performed with adolescent attachment to parents and
peers, anxious and avoidant romantic attachment orienta-
tions, emotion-focused regulation strategies, and emotional
expressivity as predictors of global index of psychopathol-
ogy. Results (see Table 2) revealed that adolescent attach-
ment to parents and emotion-focused regulation strategies in
young adulthood made a significant unique contribution to
the prediction of adult psychopathology (explaining 19%
and 14% of the variance, respectively), whereas adolescent
attachment to peers, anxious and avoidant romantic attach-
ment, and emotional expressivity did not.
Association between adolescent attachment to parents, emotion-
focused strategies, and adult psychopathology. In line with our
second objective and given the previously described signifi-
cant findings, we next tested the role of emotion-focused
regulation strategies as a mediator of the association between

insecure adolescent attachment to parents and adult psycho-
pathology. According to Baron and Kenny's (1986) recom-
mendations, all three conditions for testing such a model
were met (see Figure 1): (a) The independent variable (ado-
lescent attachment to parents) was related to the dependent
variable (psychopathology), Path c: R2 = .41, F(1, 48) =
32.69, p < .01,  = .64; (b) the independent variable was
related to the mediator (emotion-focused strategies), Path a:
R2 = .10, F(1, 48) = 5.04, p < .01,  = .31; and (c) the
mediator was related to the dependent variable, controlling
for the independent variable, Path b: R2 = .17, F(1, 47) =
19.24, p < .01,  = .44.
A final hierarchical regression with adult psychopathol-
ogy symptoms as the dependent variable was then conducted
with emotion-focused strategies entered in Step 1 and ado-
lescent attachment insecurity to parents in Step 2. Results
(see Table 3 and Figure 1) showed that, when taking into
account the variance explained by emotion-focused strate-
gies, adolescent attachment insecurity to parents remained a
significant predictor of adult psychopathology, Path c': R2
= .23, F(1, 47) = 25.37, p < .01, d = .30. We further tested the
significance of the mediated path using Preacher and Hayes's
(2004) bootstrapping methodology for indirect effects. This
procedure is based on 1,000 bootstrap resamples to describe

the confidence intervals (CIs) for indirect effects in a manner
that makes no assumptions about the distribution of the indi-
rect effects. Interpretation of the bootstrap data is accom-
plished by determining whether zero is contained within the
95% CI (thus revealing a lack of significance). Results
revealed an indirect effect of .0080 and a bias-corrected
bootstrap 95% CI [.0011, .0166], indicating a significant
decrease in the effect of adolescent attachment to parents on
adult psychopathology, through the use of emotion-focused
strategies. The use of emotion-focused strategies is therefore
considered to be a partial mediator of the association between
adolescent attachment to parents and adult symptoms of
psychopathology.
Association between young adult anxious attachment, emotion-
focused strategies, and adult psychopathology.Although anx-
ious romantic attachment was not identified as a significant
predictor in the tested longitudinal model described above,
correlational analyses did reveal anxious romantic attach-
ment to be positively linked to emotion-focused strategies
and to symptoms of psychopathology. In line with our origi-
nal hypothesis, we thus tested a model in which emotion-
focused regulation strategies mediated the association
between anxious attachment orientation in young adulthood
and adult psychopathology. According to Baron and Kenny's
(1986) recommendations, all three conditions for testing
such a model were met (see Figure 2): (a) The independent
variable (anxious attachment) was related to the dependent
variable (psychopathology), Path c: R2 = .21, F(1, 48) =
12.94, p < .01,  = .46; (b) the independent variable was
related to the mediator (emotion-focused strategies), Path a:
R2 = .26, F(1, 48) = 17.12, p < .01,  = .51; and (c) the
mediator was related to the dependent variable, controlling
for the independent variable, Path b: R2 = .17, F(1, 47) =
13.05, p < .01,  = .48.
A final hierarchical regression with adult symptoms of
psychopathology as the dependent variable was thus con-
ducted with emotion-focused strategies entered in Step 1 and
anxious attachment in Step 2. Results (see Table 4 and Figure
2) showed that, when taking into account the variance
explained by emotion-focused strategies, anxious attachment
was no longer significantly related to adult psychopathology,
Path c': R2 = .03, F(1, 47) = 2.58, n.s. We further tested the
significance of the mediated path using Preacher and Hayes's
(2004) bootstrapping methodology for indirect effects based
on 1,000 bootstrap resamples. Results revealed an indirect
effect of .0992 and a bias-corrected bootstrap 95% CI [.0350,
.1771], indicating a significant decrease in the effect of anx-
ious attachment on adult psychopathology. The use of emo-
tion-focused strategies is therefore a complete mediator of
the association between anxious attachment orientation in
young adulthood and adult symptoms of psychopathology.
Discussion
The overall objective of the present study was to (a) test a
longitudinal model depicting the impact of attachment to
parents and peers in adolescence and to romantic partners in
young adulthood, on adult self-reported symptoms of psy-
chopathology, and (b) test the theoretical assumption that
specific emotion regulation strategies, that is, emotion-
focused strategies and emotional expressivity, mediate asso-
ciations between attachment insecurity (in adolescence and
young adulthood) and adult symptoms of psychopathology.
In doing so, our goal was to identify the mechanism through
which earlier attachment relationships influenced the experi-
ence of adult symptoms of psychopathology. As expected,
our results revealed that greater attachment insecurity toward
parents in adolescence predicted greater symptoms of psy-
chopathology in adulthood, 10 years later. Further analysis
of this link revealed the partial mediating role of emotion-
focused strategies. In addition, emotion-focused strategies
fully mediated the positive association between anxious
attachment in young adulthood and adult psychopathology.
These findings and their implications are discussed in greater
detail in the following sections.
Adolescent Attachment and Emotion-Focused
Strategies as Predictors of Adult Symptoms of
Psychopathology

insecure attachment and psychopathology in adolescence

(Fortuna & Roisman, 2008; Lopez et al., 2001), the current
study is the first to longitudinally investigate this relation
across these two developmental periods (10-year lag).
Specifically, we found greater parent­adolescent attachment
insecurity to be associated with greater self-reported psycho-
pathology in adulthood. Findings of this study therefore
extend the existing concurrent literature by showing that
attachment insecurity toward parents continues to be related
to symptoms of psychopathology into the adult years. As
expected, emotion-focused regulation strategies were also
related to adult symptoms of psychopathology. We interpret
these results as suggesting that, by resorting to emotion-
focused strategies, including self-blame, ruminative
thoughts, and feelings of helplessness in dealing with dis-
tress, negative emotions are not dealt with constructively.
Rather than thinking of the problem in a more benign manner
and finding appropriate solutions, individuals who use
emotion-focused strategies become enveloped in the stress-
ful situation, focused on the negative emotions associated
with it, and overcome with feelings of helplessness
(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2008). These strategies can thus serve
to exacerbate one's experience of negative emotions, con-
tributing to the experience of symptoms of psychopathology
in adulthood. Therefore, in accordance with our findings,
emotion-focused strategies play a crucial and direct role in
the presence of adult psychopathology.
We also found that, in addition to being related to adult
symptoms of psychopathology 2 years later, emotion-focused
strategies were also partial mediators of the association
between insecure parent­adolescent attachment and adult

symptoms of psychopathology. Our results are in line with
those of previous studies showing that ineffective strategies
mediate concurrent associations between insecure attach-
ment and psychological distress (Lopez et al., 2001;
Mallinckrodt & Wei, 2005). Nevertheless, emotion-focused
strategies were only partial mediators, such that insecure
attachment to parents in adolescence remained associated to
adult psychopathology 10 years later. We interpret our results
as providing evidence that internal working models associ-
ated with insecure attachment relationships toward parents
predispose the individual to experience symptoms of psy-
chopathology in adulthood (Davila et al., 2005; Dozier et al.,
2008). Despite the fact that other attachment figures, namely,
peers and romantic partners, may fulfill important attach-
ment needs in later life (Allen, 2008), internal working mod-
els are primarily constructed from attachment-related
experiences with parents in childhood and adolescence,
when the individual is most vulnerable (Bowlby, 1982).
These representational models form the basis for expecta-
tions and beliefs concerning the self and others as well as
basic self-regulatory processes, which contribute to later
symptoms of psychopathology (Bolwby, 1988; Main et al.,
1985). During adolescence, in particular, when coping with
developmental challenges are an inherent part of the parent­
teen relationship, the quality of dyadic interactions may rein-
force the teen's internal working model regarding his or her
ability to overcome difficult situations and the supportive-
ness and reliability of others (Dozier et al., 2008).
Anxious Romantic Attachment, Emotion-Focused
Strategies, and Adult Psychopathology
Supported by results of past empirical studies, our initial find-
ings suggested that anxious romantic attachment in young
adulthood was related to greater self-reported symptoms of
psychopathology, 2 years later (Fortuna & Roisman, 2008;
Lopez et al., 2001; Mallinckrodt & Wei, 2005). Anxiously
attached individuals are guided by negative working models
of self and the world (Brennan et al., 1998; Collins & Read,
1990), that is, beliefs of being unworthy of receiving love and
consistent support from their attachment figures. These indi-
viduals also fear partner abandonment and experience intense
negative emotions in attachment-related contexts. Our results
therefore suggest that these self-deprecating models may con-
tribute to the experience of symptoms of psychopathology in
adulthood.
However, our results further showed that anxious romantic
attachment influenced the experience of symptoms of psy-
chopathology via the use of emotion-focused strategies.
Although we acknowledge that we did not control for earlier
psychopathology, this study is nevertheless the first to dem-
onstrate this indirect link using a 2-year delay, reinforcing the
importance of the proposed model. These results are also in
line with findings from previous studies (Cooper, Shaver, &
Collins, 1998), suggesting that anxiously attached individuals
may be caught in a vicious cycle whereby their negative
views of self, coupled with their fears of partner abandon-
ment, may lead them to be hypervigilant to negative cues and
vulnerable to experiencing distress. To deal with these nega-
tive feelings, anxiously attached individuals may resort to
emotion-focused strategies that include ruminations, self-
blame, and feelings of helplessness in overcoming difficult
situations alone (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2007, 2008), which
can lead to greater feelings of distress and thus increases in
self-reported symptoms of psychopathology over time.
Adolescent Attachment to Peers and Avoidant
Attachment in Adulthood
In our study, adolescent attachment insecurity toward peers
was unrelated to adult symptoms of psychopathology.
Although this null finding may reflect a lack of power, it is
concordant with that of Wilkinson and Walford (2001), who
also failed to identify such an association using a concurrent
design with a much larger sample (N = 404). This suggests
that the concurrent association between attachment insecu-
rity toward peers and symptoms of psychopathology demon-
strated in a few studies (Laible et al., 2000; Lee & Hankin,
2009; Muris et al., 2001; Wilkinson, 2010) may not be main-
tained over time. Unlike attachment relationships with par-
ents, which are enduring features of one's life (Allen, 2008),
attachment relationships with peers are more fleeting, with
the formation of new friendships and the dissolution of oth-
ers. Whereas adolescents' friendships may contribute to alle-
viating or exacerbating symptoms of psychopathology in
adolescence, this association is unlikely to carry over into
adulthood. Additional studies with larger samples are thus
necessary to provide support for the theoretical idea that the
quality of attachment experiences with the most important
caregiving figures, usually parents, is most predictive of the
individual's internal working model and future adaptation
(Bretherton, 1987).
In line with the findings of Lopez et al. (2001), our results
showed no relation between avoidant romantic attachment
orientation in young adulthood and the global index of psy-
chopathology. Past research has shown that avoidance is
related to the development of symptoms of psychopathology
only under extreme conditions of stress (Berant, Mikulincer,
& Florian, 2001; Ein-Dor, Doron, Solomon, Mikulincer, &
Shaver, 2010). Given our low-risk sample, the likelihood of
our participants experiencing high levels of stress was lim-
ited, which may explain our nonsignificant findings. The
lack of findings may also be attributed to under-reporting of
symptoms of psychopathology by avoidantly attached indi-
viduals given their strategy of minimization of distress sig-
nals (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2007, 2008). Wei et al. (2003)
suggested that these individuals may not report distress on
simple measures with high face validity, as the one used in
the present study. The authors found that when multiple mea-
sures of psychopathology were used, a positive association
12 SAGE Open
between avoidant attachment and psychological distress was
more likely to be detected. Future studies using multiple
measures of psychopathology are thus needed to clarify our
lack of a significant association.
Emotional Expressivity and Symptoms of
Psychopathology
Contrary to the expectation that a lack of emotional expres-
sivity would be associated with greater symptoms of psycho-
pathology 2 years later, the tendency to express emotions
was unrelated to psychopathology in the present study.
Again, these null findings may be attributed to the rather lim-
ited sample size of the current study. In fact, past studies
have shown associations between lower emotional expres-
sivity and greater prevalence of psychiatric disorders (i.e.,
alcohol and drug dependence, and depression; Corcos &
Speranza, 2003), and higher emotional expressivity and
fewer symptoms of psychological distress (Vogel et al.,
2008). Using the same EES as the one used in the present
study, Vogel et al. (2008) found that greater emotional
expressivity was negatively associated with psychological
distress when assessed concurrently in a large sample of
undergraduate students. The authors proposed that highly
distressed individuals may be less likely to openly express
their emotions, given their expectation that communicating
emotions may cause them to experience even greater unpleas-
ant feelings (Vogel et al., 2008). In light of the results from
the Vogel et al. study, and those of the present study, we sug-
gest that, whereas emotional expressivity and psychopathol-
ogy may be concurrently related, the tendency to express
emotions may not buffer against future experience of symp-
toms of psychopathology. However, we interpret this null
finding with caution given the restricted sample size of the
current study.
Study Limitations
Several study limitations should be noted. First, owing to our
limited sample size, the present study may have been under-
powered, and thus, all null findings should be interpreted
with caution. Moreover, we recognized the higher proportion
of women in our sample such that study findings may be
more applicable to women than men. Further studies with
larger samples in which women and men are equally repre-
sented are necessary to confirm study results. Second, ado-
lescent attachment security to parents and peers was assessed
along a continuous dimension of insecurity, whereas adult
attachment was assessed along the anxious and avoidant
dimensions. Given this discrepancy, we were unable to
assess the long-term association of anxious and avoidant
attachment insecurity in adolescence and adulthood. A third
limitation of the present study is that all study variables were
self-reported, which may have engendered under-reporting
of symptoms by avoidantly attached individuals and
over-reporting by anxiously attached individuals. Moreover,
individuals who endorsed emotion-focused regulation strate-
gies may also have been more likely to over-report symp-
toms, given their focus on distress. Future studies should use
various measures for assessing symptoms of psychopathol-
ogy to correct for this possible bias. Last, given that we could
not control for psychopathology symptoms in adolescence,
we cannot rule out the possibility that self-reported symp-
toms in adulthood were persisting symptoms from the ado-
lescent period. Replication studies of current findings should
include an earlier measure of psychopathology to address
this limitation. Nevertheless, our sample consisted of a nor-
mative population, reducing the likelihood that our results
are an artifact of severe and persistent psychopathology.
Conclusion
In summary, findings from this study extend the investiga-
tion of adult adaptation by presenting new longitudinal asso-
ciations spanning a 10-year period, that is, between the ages
of 14 and 24. Specifically, results highlight the association
between an insecure attachment to parents in adolescence
and greater symptoms of psychopathology in adulthood.
These results therefore make an important contribution to the
existing attachment literature in showing, from a develop-
mental perspective, that adolescents' negative expectations
and views within the context of an insecure relationship with
parents are directly related to greater symptoms of psychopa-
thology in adulthood, 10 years later. By identifying this
developmental model, our results suggest that adolescent
attachment to parents and the use of emotion-focused strate-
gies in young adulthood may be important mechanisms to
target in reducing symptoms of psychopathology in adult-
hood. For example, our findings directly support the theo-
retical framework of Emotion-Focused Couples Therapy
(EFT; Johnson, 2004). This attachment-based intervention
approach aims at improving couples' negative interactions
through changes in emotion regulation strategies. In a recent
article by Dalgleish et al. (2014), the authors found that more
anxiously attached individuals showed greater improve-
ments in marital satisfaction following EFT. Accordingly, by
providing anxiously attached individuals with more adaptive
strategies for regulating their distress, these individuals are
more likely to show increased psychosocial functioning. The
results of the present article are also in line with the
Attachment Based Family Therapy by Diamond, Siqueland,
and Diamond (2003), which focuses on improving the qual-
ity of the parent­adolescent attachment relationship for
depressed and suicidal adolescents. Taken together, based on
our findings, prevention and intervention programs centered
on fostering more secure parent­adolescent attachment rela-
tionships as well as more adaptive emotion regulation strate-
gies in adulthood are crucial for thwarting or improving the
experience of symptoms of psychopathology in the future.
Nonetheless, the replication of our findings with larger
Pascuzzo et al. 13
samples using a pre/post-test experimental design is neces-
sary to corroborate study conclusions.
