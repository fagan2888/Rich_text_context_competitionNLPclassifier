Tax Subsidies For Health
Insurance: Costs And
Benefits
Even the most effective tax subsidies would cost almost $40
billion a year and cover only 30 percent of the uninsured.
by Jonathan Gruber and Larry Levitt
PROLOGUE: There is growing support across the political
spectrum--from Rep. Dick Armey (R-TX) on the right to Rep.
Pete Stark (D-CA) on the left--for using federal tax credits as
a sensible way to expand health insurance coverage. Tax
credits would support the voluntary purchase of private
insurance. However, a key question is how much broadened
coverage the federal government could anticipate through this
approach. In this paper Jonathan Gruber and Larry Levitt,
using a new microsimulation model developed specifically for
this purpose, assert that the ability of tax subsidies to greatly
reduce the number of uninsured persons remains uncertain and
unproven. But they also write that if Congress decides to
pursue the expansion of coverage through changes in tax
policy, some approaches are distinctly better than others are
from the standpoint of sound public policy.

Institute of Technology and also directs the Program on

efficiency of current systems that deliver health care to the
indigent, and the economics of smoking. Levitt directs the

ABSTRACT: The continued rise in the uninsured population has led to consider-
able interest in tax-based policies to raise the level of insurance coverage. Using
a detailed microsimulation model for evaluating these policies, we find that
while tax subsidies could significantly increase insurance coverage, even very
generous tax policies could not cover more than a sizable minority of the
uninsured population. For example, a generous refundable credit that costs
$13 billion per year would reduce the ranks of the uninsured by only four million
persons. We also find that the efficiency of tax policies, in terms of the cost per
newly insured, inevitably would fall as more of the uninsured were covered.
Despite an economic boom that has had only one inter-
ruption in fifteen years and low levels of health care cost
increases, uninsurance rates in the United States continue to
rise. This has motivated considerable policy discussion at both the
federal and state levels. At the federal level, it was one of the factors
that led the Clinton administration to promote comprehensive
health system reform. The policy focus has now shifted to incre-
mental reforms, particularly to the idea of using the tax system to
subsidize individuals' purchase of insurance. This would provide
financial benefits to individual coverage holders that are now en-
joyed only by the self-employed or those with employer-sponsored
coverage. Also, tax subsidies for buying insurance would rely on the
private insurance system rather than on a government-sponsored
program that might carry stigma for some people. Finally, it can be
seen as providing a tax cut rather than creating a more politically
controversial new spending program.
Yet while the tax-equity argument is compelling--especially
given the estimated $100 billion in yearly federal tax subsidies for
the purchase of employer-sponsored health coverage--tax subsi-
dies' ability to meaningfully reduce the number of uninsured per-
sons remains uncertain and unproven. Moreover, the spectrum of
tax-based approaches that has been proposed is quite broad, rang-
ing from deductibility of insurance costs for individuals to refund-
able tax credits that might cover most or all of the cost of a typical
health insurance policy.
In this paper we assess the potential implications of a range of
tax-based approaches using a new microsimulation model devel-
oped specifically for this purpose. We examine how various charac-
teristics of these proposals are likely to affect the overall cost to the
federal government, the number of uninsured persons who would
gain coverage, which income groups would benefit from the subsi-
dies, and how those who now have employer-sponsored coverage
would be affected.
n Background. Health insurance is now subsidized through the
tax code in four ways. First, and most importantly, employers' pay-

ments toward health insurance are excluded from employees' tax-
able income. Second, those who spend more than 7.5 percent of their
incomes on health care and health insurance can deduct the excess
expenditures on their income tax returns. Third, workers in firms
with a group health insurance plan that qualifies under Section 125
of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) code can make before-tax
premium contributions. Finally, the self-employed can deduct from
their income tax a portion of their insurance expenditures, currently
60 percent but rising to 100 percent by 2003.
Persons who are not self-employed but who are not offered health
insurance by their employers remain outside the current scheme of
tax subsidies. In addition, much of the spending on insurance, even
by those whose employer spending is tax-subsidized, is through
nonsubsidized employee contributions. Using the model described
below we calculate that roughly 16 percent of the nonelderly popu-
lation is not eligible for a tax subsidy for health insurance at some
point in time.
n Methodology. In this paper we model a variety of approaches
to expand tax subsidies, to consider their impact on health insur-
ance coverage and costs. We use a detailed microsimulation model,
based on the February/March 1997 Current Population Survey
(CPS) and augmented with data from a variety of sources on health
insurance costs in the group and nongroup markets. The central
feature of this model is consideration of a wide variety of behavioral
responses to tax subsidies, such as the extent to which (1) the
uninsured would purchase insurance if it were subsidized; (2) those
now holding nongroup insurance would take up the subsidy; (3)
firms would drop group coverage or reduce their premium contribu-
tions if nongroup coverage were subsidized; (4) those who hold
group insurance would switch to nongroup insurance if it were
subsidized; and (5) those whose employers raise contributions
would drop their group insurance and become uninsured.1 For this
analysis we consider the following types of policies.
Refundable tax credit for nongroup insurance. We first consider the
availability of a tax credit for the purchase of insurance that covers
insurance costs up to $1,000 for singles and $2,000 for families (the
"base" policy). This credit covers about 43 percent of the premiums
of a typical nongroup policy for an uninsured individual and about
31 percent of the premiums for a typical uninsured family. This
credit is refundable; that is, if the amount of the credit claimed
exceeds the individual's tax liability, he or she can receive a refund
for the difference. This is particularly important because 45 percent
of the uninsured do not pay any taxes against which a subsidy could
be applied. We assume that the availability of this credit is income-

limited; the full amount of the credit is available only to joint filers
with taxable incomes of $75,000 or less, phasing out to zero credit at
taxable incomes of $100,000; for single filers, the limits are $45,000
and $60,000, respectively. It is available only for non-employer-
sponsored insurance, so that it cannot be used toward the purchase
of employer health insurance premiums, but it is available to all
persons, even those whose employers offer health insurance.
Nonrefundablecredit for nongroup insurance. This policy is identical to
the base policy except that the credit is not refundable, so individu-
als can only claim it up to the level of their existing tax liabilities.
Deduction for nongroup insuranceexpenditures. We next consider using
instead of a tax credit an unlimited deduction for the costs of non-
group insurance. This parallels the tax treatment of employer-spon-
sored insurance, except that the costs of that insurance also are
shielded from payroll taxation.
Refundable credit for nongroup insurance restricted to those not offered
insurance. This policy is identical to the base policy but is restricted
to those who are not offered nongroup insurance. This approach
imposes significant administrative and enforcement difficulties but
has the potential to target the tax subsidies more precisely to per-
sons who otherwise would be uninsured.
Refundable credit for any insurance expenditure. Finally, we consider a
policy that is identical to the base policy but applies to any individ-
ual insurance expenditure, not just to nongroup policy purchases.
Thus, persons can use this credit against the cost of their share of
employer-sponsored insurance premiums.
Costs And Coverage Under The Base Policy
n Aggregate impacts. Using our microsimulation model we show
the impacts of the base policy on the total cost of the policy; the
take-up of the subsidy by various groups, categorized by their pre-
subsidy insurance status; and the net change in the size of these
groups from before to after the subsidy (Exhibit 1). We explore in
particular, for the employer-insured, the avenues that lead to the net
change in this group.
The total cost of using the base policy would be $13.3 billion per
year (in 1999 dollars). Almost 18.4 million persons would take up the
subsidy (8.2 percent of the total nonelderly population). Of those
taking it up, 4.7 million would be previously uninsured, 8.6 million
would be previously covered by nongroup insurance, 4.7 million
would be previously covered by employer-sponsored insurance, and
0.4 million would be previously covered by Medicaid. On net, the
number of uninsured persons would fall by slightly more than four
million, the number of persons with nongroup insurance would rise

by 9.8 million, and the number of persons with employer-sponsored
insurance would fall by 5.4 million. This latter change would be
made up of 1.1 million persons whose firms stopped offering group
insurance and who moved to the nongroup market; 0.1 million per-
sons whose firms stopped offering insurance and who became unin-
sured; 3.6 million persons who switched from group to nongroup
insurance; and 0.6 million persons who became uninsured because
their firms raised the employee share of insurance premiums and
who decided to drop coverage.
While the base policy would lower the number of uninsured
persons, it also would induce a shift from employer to nongroup
coverage. Moreover, almost half of those taking up the subsidy would
be persons who were already purchasing nongroup insurance. As a
result, the net cost of the policy per newly insured person would be
almost $3,300, which is substantial when compared with average
employer-based insurance costs of $1,860 per person in our sample
and nongroup insurance costs of $2,100. That is, because of imper-
fect targeting, the government would pay about 50 percent more
than the cost of the typical nongroup policy per newly insured person.
It is interesting to note that most of the cost of imperfect target-
ing of this subsidy would arise through take-up by those with non-
group insurance, not through dropping group coverage or switching
to nongroup insurance by those with job-based insurance. Although
persons with employer insurance who dropped or switched insur-

ance would cost the government money through their take-up of the
subsidy, they also would save the government revenues by dropping
their currently tax-subsidized employer coverage. For example, for
those workers whose firms dropped their health insurance cover-
age, we assume that their wages would rise because their employer
would no longer be paying for health insurance and could therefore
afford higher wages. These higher wages would then be taxed, rais-
ing new revenues and offsetting the cost of their take-up of the new
insurance subsidy. For those who switched from group to nongroup
insurance, we assume that the cost savings to the employer would
be passed back to workers in the form of higher wages (although not
specifically to the switching employees), once again raising reve-
nues. Revenues also would rise because employers would react to
this base policy to some extent by lowering their pretax contributions
for health insurance and again raise wages to compensate for this.
n Distributional impacts. Given the strong correlation between
insurance status and income, it is important to consider not just the
aggregate impacts of the base-policy subsidy, but its distributional
implications as well. Exhibit 2 shows the distributional effects of
the policy for different segments of the population relative to the
federal poverty level ($17,274 for a family of four). For each group we
show the net cost and the percentage of costs attributable to the
group; the subsidy take-up in absolute and percentage (relative to
group size before the policy impact) terms; the change in the unin-
sured in absolute and percentage terms; and the cost per newly
insured person (that is, total dollars spent on that group relative to
the reduction in the uninsured).
First, we find that the lowest income group, which contains 45
percent of the uninsured, would receive about 26 percent of the net
spending on this policy. Only about 1.3 million of the uninsured in
this group would gain coverage, which is about one-third of the
total number of uninsured who would gain coverage across all in-

come groups. Overall, this policy is more efficient for this subgroup
than for the full population, with a cost of $2,739 per newly insured
person. This is primarily because there would be few persons with
nongroup insurance taking up the policy in this income range, rela-
tive to the number of uninsured persons taking it up.
Second, those with incomes between 100 percent and 200 per-
cent of poverty, a group that contains another 30 percent of the
uninsured, would receive about 30 percent of the net spending from
this policy, and about 1.6 million fewer persons in this group would
be uninsured.
Third, persons with incomes between 200 and 300 percent of
poverty would receive almost 20 percent of the net spending from
the policy, but the number of uninsured persons would fall by only
0.7 million. As a result, spending would be less efficient for this
group, with a cost per newly insured person of more than $3,500.
Finally, persons with incomes above 300 percent of poverty would
receive 24 percent of the net spending of this policy, but the number
of uninsured persons would change only slightly, mostly because so
few persons in this income group are uninsured. As a result, spend-
ing would be much less efficient at these higher income levels.
Thus, a majority of spending (56 percent) under this policy would
be targeted to those with incomes below 200 percent of the poverty
level, and three-quarters would be targeted to those with incomes
below 300 percent of poverty. But the spending for those above 300
percent of poverty would be very inefficient: A total of $3.3 billion
would be spent on this group to reduce the number of uninsured
persons by only 400,000.
Costs And Coverage Under Alternative Policies
The base policy mimicks a number of proposed tax subsidies; how-
ever, a host of alternative structures have been proposed. We cannot
do justice in this limited space to the full variety of alternatives
available to policymakers, so we consider several alternative ap-
proaches to provide a flavor of how the effects of tax policy change
as the structure of a program is altered.
n Making the credit nonrefundable. One option that would
greatly lower costs and simplify administration is to make the sub-
sidy nonrefundable. However, this would severely limit the benefits
of this subsidy for the uninsured, more than 60 percent of whom
have tax liabilities of less than $1,000 (and therefore can only par-
tially benefit from a nonrefundable credit).
A nonrefundable $1,000/$2,000 tax credit would indeed lower
the costs of the subsidy, which would fall to almost half the cost of
the refundable base-policy credit (Exhibit 3). But the impact on the

size of the uninsured population would fall even more, with fewer
than two million uninsured persons gaining coverage (only 4.3 per-
cent of the uninsured). As a result, the cost per newly insured per-
son ($3,827) would be even higher than with the refundable credit
($3,296), largely because such a high share of the dollars would be
going to the previously nongroup- or employer-insured. Moreover,
the distributional consequences of this approach are much less at-
tractive. Only 23 percent of the spending through this policy would
go to those with incomes below 20 percent of the poverty line.
There are a number of political and administrative arguments
against refundability, most significantly the question of whether net
tax refunds to low-income families are hidden forms of "welfare"
payments. But the results here speak clearly: Refundability is criti-
cal for appropriate targeting of tax incentives to low-income per-
sons who are uninsured.
n Using a deduction. Another alternative that could limit costs
further is to use a tax deduction rather than a credit, but this ap-
proach has problems similar to those of nonrefundability in reaching
the uninsured. Moreover, of the half of the uninsured who do pay
taxes, 90 percent are in the 15 percent tax bracket, so a subsidy in
the form of a deduction would be worth relatively little to them.
In our microsimulation model we assume that an unlimited de-
duction of nongroup health insurance costs is an "above-the-line"
deduction that would be available to all taxpayers, not just to those
who itemize their deductions. The costs of this policy (only $870
million per year) would be dramatically lower than those of the
alternatives. But its impact on insurance coverage would be much
more modest, with only 250,000 uninsured persons gaining cover-

age. This is because there would be only a modest overall take-up of
this subsidy by the uninsured to begin with (600,000 persons), and
much of this would then be offset by firms' dropping group coverage
and reduced coverage because of firm contribution reductions. Esti-
mating with precision the change in the number of uninsured per-
sons in the range around zero is difficult, but it is clear that the
effects of a deduction on both costs and coverage would likely be
minimal. At the same time, this policy would have much worse
distributional characteristics: Less than 30 percent of the benefits
would accrue to persons with incomes below 200 percent of the
poverty line.
Note that the cost that would arise from this policy would not be
the result of take-up by the previously employer-insured. The gov-
ernment would actually make money on this population, because
the government revenue from higher wages as a result of firms'
dropping coverage and reducing contributions would outweigh the
government's cost of subsidy take-up. Rather, the inefficiency
would arise primarily from the fact that three-quarters of those who
would take up this subsidy would already have nongroup insurance.
n Limiting the credit to those not offered coverage. One way
to better target the subsidy may be to limit the refundable
$1,000/$2,000 credit to those who are not eligible for employer-
sponsored insurance. There are of course difficult administrative
issues associated with implementing and enforcing such a policy.2
But the advantage is that being offered insurance by one's employer
is closely related to being covered by insurance, so this policy pro-
vides a device for better targeting subsidy dollars to the currently
uninsured.
The total cost of this option is much lower than that of the base
policy, only $6.2 billion per year, although the number of newly
insured persons would fall as well (to 2.1 million) (Exhibit 3). The
efficiency of this alternative would be somewhat better than in the
base case, at $2,930 per newly insured person. This increase in effi-
ciency arises from the lower take-up of this policy by persons with
nongroup insurance, since many of them are offered employer-based
insurance. On the other hand, firms' dropping group coverage would
cause a much larger increase in the uninsured pool. We estimate
that firms would drop 3.2 million persons from their insurance rolls,
and 630,000 of them would remain uninsured.
This policy is somewhat more distributionally attractive than the
base policy, with more than two-thirds of the benefits accruing to
persons with incomes below 200 percent of poverty. These modest
distributional gains, however, must be balanced against the costs
and difficulty of enforcing this administratively awkward restric-

tion (which we have not accounted for in our estimates).
n Expanding the subsidy to apply to all insurance spending.
An alternative direction is to expand from the base-case subsidiza-
tion of just nongroup premiums to subsidization of all spending on
insurance, even the employee portion of employer-sponsored cover-
age. On the one hand, this would greatly increase costs, as more than
70 percent of the employer-insured pay some or all of their premi-
ums, and all of these costs would now be paid by the government.
On the other hand, the CPS reports that almost 40 percent of the
uninsured are offered group health insurance, and a large subsidy
would essentially make insurance free for this population, with dra-
matic impacts. Moreover, there would be neither firms dropping
group insurance nor employees switching to nongroup insurance
under a policy such as this.
The cost of this policy would indeed be substantial: $62.2 billion
per year (Exhibit 3). On the other hand, the impact on the uninsured
would be equally dramatic, with more than 12.4 million uninsured
gaining coverage. Overall, however, this is the least efficient of the
policies considered, with a cost of more than $5,000 per newly
insured person.
Expanding the subsidy would have a very broad reach, with more
than 127 million persons taking it up. This group would of course be
predominantly made up of the employer-insured, who would take
up the subsidy to cover their share of premiums. Indeed, a major
difference between this and the policy options mentioned earlier is
that the number of employer-insured persons would be rising, not
falling, which may be of intrinsic value to some policymakers.
This policy alternative is less distributionally attractive than a
refundable credit would be, but it spends a higher share of its dollars
at the bottom of the income distribution than does the nonrefund-
able credit or deduction. (Only 36.5 percent of the spending is on
those below 200 percent of poverty.) It is worth noting, however,
that the inefficiency of this policy comes more from its scale than
from its structure. As we show in the next section, the cost per
newly insured person from this approach would not be appreciably
higher than the cost from the base policy, which would provide
higher levels of coverage to the uninsured.
n Changing the scale of the subsidy. While we have chosen a
credit of $1,000 for singles and $2,000 for families as our base-case
policy, one could consider less or more generous alternatives as well.
Thus, we now consider first halving, then doubling, the generosity
of this policy. We find that smaller credits cover fewer people but do
so in a more targeted way. For example, with a credit of $500 for
singles and $1,000 for families, we estimate that costs would be only

30 percent of those of the base case, but the reduction in the unin-
sured would be almost half as large. As a result, spending per newly
insured person would be only $2,239, well below even average group
costs per person. On the other hand, with a credit of $2,000 for
singles and $4,000 for families, which would approximate the full
cost of insurance for these populations, we estimate that costs
would rise almost threefold, but the number of newly insured per-
sons would almost double, so that spending per newly insured
would rise to $4,915 per person. At the same time, the small credit
would cover only 2.1 million newly insured persons, whereas the
larger credit would cover more than 7.7 million.
The smaller subsidy also would target its spending more directly
to the poor, with more than 60 percent of the dollars flowing to
those with incomes below 200 percent of poverty. On the other
hand, the $2,000/$4,000 credit would spend less than half of its
dollars on those with incomes below 200 percent of poverty. This
worsening of the distributional impacts as generosity rises reflects
the dramatic increase in take-up by both the (relatively high in-
come) nongroup-insured and the employer-insured.
Thus, there is a clear trade-off as the generosity of the tax credit is
changed. Modest credits cannot deliver a very large change in the
uninsured population, but the newly insured persons who are cov-
ered tend to be those with the lowest incomes. Very large tax credits
can induce substantial changes in the uninsured population, but
only at a very steep cost per newly insured person.
n Easing liquidity constraints. A key issue in implementing tax
credits is the mismatch between the flow of tax subsidies and the
flow of insurance premium payments. Low-income households that
would like to take advantage of tax credits during a given year, but
that only receive their credit the next spring, may face liquidity
problems. If the government can find a solution to this timing mis-
match, it could increase the propensity of the uninsured to take up
tax subsidies. A variety of analysts have proposed solutions to this
problem, such as paying tax credits directly to insurers.3 But our
track record with the earned income tax credit (EITC) suggests
caution in assuming that this problem can easily be overcome: Al-
though persons can claim their EITC throughout the year, and pre-
sumably for many it would be of some value to do so, more than 99
percent of claimants receive the credit as a lump sum the next spring.4

population, but only at a very steep cost per newly insured person."

We have assumed that liquidity constraints reduce take-up in
our base-case calculations; however, it is important to assess the
impact of easing these constraints by assuming that the government
would solve the liquidity problem. As shown in Exhibit 3, easing
liquidity constraints would increase by $1.4 billion the cost of the
base policy (absent any additional interest or other costs to the
government of easing these constraints) and would insure an addi-
tional 1.4 million persons, for a total of 5.5 million newly insured
persons. This implies a substantial increase in the efficiency of the
policy, with a cost of only $2,683 per newly insured person. More-
over, the impacts of easing liquidity constraints would also be
heightened for larger tax credits. With a $2,000/$4,000 credit, the
costs would increase by $6 billion per year, but the number of newly
insured persons would rise to more than twelve million.
Weighing The Pros And Cons
Federal policymakers continue to look to tax policy as a politically
attractive vehicle for addressing the problems of the uninsured in
the United States, so the implications of alternative approaches to
tax subsidization must be carefully assessed. Although the effects of
any major change in health care financing cannot be estimated with
perfect precision, simulation analyses using common assumptions
are particularly useful for comparing the effects of alternative pro-
posals. Our approach in analyzing alternative tax-based mecha-
nisms for covering the uninsured in this way is similar to a recent
series of analyses carried out by a Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation
project to study incremental health reform.5
n Summary of findings. Several clear conclusions follow from
our analysis. First, it is difficult to design a tax policy that insures a
large number of new persons at a modest cost per person. The base
policy considered here is more generous than are many of the pro-
posals being considered by federal policymakers, and yet it still
would subsidize less than half of the estimated cost of typical non-
group insurance. Although it would decrease the number of unin-
sured persons by an estimated four million (less than 10 percent of
the uninsured population), the average cost per newly insured per-
son would be $3,300. Raising the value of the credit would insure
more people but also would raise the cost per newly insured person.
Second, there are clearly more and less efficient ways to cover a
given number of uninsured persons. We find in particular that non-
refundable credits would be much more expensive per uninsured
person covered and would cover fewer of the uninsured. We also
find that policies that can match the timing of tax subsidies with the
timing of insurance payments could improve both the scope and the

efficiency of tax policy.
Third, different approaches to tax subsidies vary also in how
effective they are at targeting resources to those with low incomes.
For example, a policy that would target refundable credits of $1,000
to singles and $2,000 to families would provide 56 percent of its
benefits to persons with incomes below 200 percent of poverty. In
contrast, a policy that allowed people to deduct nongroup insurance
premiums would provide less than 30 percent of its benefits to
people in that income group, and a credit that was not refundable
would target an even smaller portion of aid to them.
Finally, tax-based subsidies--particularly those whose subsidies
are most generous--would likely lead to reductions in the number
of persons with employer-based coverage. For example, we estimate
that the base-case policy would reduce the number of persons with
employer coverage by 5.4 million. Most of these (3.6 million) would
switch from employer to nongroup insurance because they would
find the new tax subsidies more attractive than their current situ-
ations. However, the remainder would either be dropped from their
firms' insurance rolls or become uninsured because their employers
increased the amount that employees must pay for insurance. Poli-
cies that mitigate firms' dropping coverage or employees' switching
to nongroup insurance tend to cost more in total and also per newly
covered person.
n Potential impact of insurance market reforms. If there are
pooling advantages to having individuals obtain their insurance
through the workplace, then this is a potential concern with policies
targeted only to nongroup coverage. Our analysis, in fact, assumes
that policies in the individual market are universally available (at
health risk­adjusted prices). While such "guaranteed issue" in the
individual market is required in some states, most states allow in-
surers to exclude people who are in poor health, which could reduce
take-up rates. State or federal regulators could accompany tax sub-
sidies with individual market regulations to limit such practices,
but these regulations are controversial. Also, the net impact of insur-
ance market reforms in the context of tax subsidies is uncertain,
because it would raise costs for the most healthy persons and lower
them for the least healthy.
On the other hand, doubling the size of the nongroup insurance
market (as we estimate would occur in the base policy) could
"Most states allow insurers to exclude people who are in poor
health, which could reduce take-up rates."

greatly improve the functioning of this market, in terms of both
administrative efficiency and reduced adverse selection. Also, non-
group insurance plans might design policies targeted specifically to
the available level of the credit, further increasing take-up from
what is modeled here (although take-up might be for plans with less
generous benefits than are typical today). Moreover, delinking in-
surance from the workplace could improve the functioning of the
labor market by reducing insurance-induced immobility across jobs,
or "job lock."
Although tax policy shows promise as a means of pro-
viding health insurance to some of the uninsured, covering
substantial numbers of uninsured persons will require very
large expenditures, both overall and per newly covered person. Even
the most effective tax policy considered here--a $2,000/$4,000
credit accompanied by a solution to liquidity problems--would
cost almost $40 billion per year and cover only 30 percent of the
uninsured. Thus, tax policy can likely be most useful as one part of
an overall strategy to address uninsurance in the United States,
rather than as a solution in and of itself.
