United States Population

Abstract--Serum vitamin C has been inversely associated with blood pressure in several epidemiologic studies, but little
is known about effect of other antioxidant vitamins. We examined the relation between serum vitamins A, C, and E,
-carotene, and -carotene levels and blood pressure among 15 317 men and women 20 years of age who participated
in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Blood pressure was characterized as the average of 6
measurements obtained over 2 visits by trained observers and hypertension was defined as blood pressure 140/
90 mm Hg and/or taking antihypertensive medications. In multivariate models, a 1 SD difference in vitamin A (16.2
g/dL) and vitamin E (20.4 g/dL) was associated with a 43% (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.34 to 1.53) and 18% (OR, 1.18;
95% CI, 1.09 to 1.27) higher odds of hypertension, respectively. A 1 SD difference in -carotene (0.47 g/dL) and
-carotene (496 g/dL) was associated with a 16% (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.94) and 11% (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82
to 0.97) lower odds of hypertension, respectively. In addition, serum vitamins A and E were positively and significantly
associated with both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, whereas -carotene and -carotene were inversely and
significantly associated with systolic and vitamin C associated with diastolic blood pressure in multivariate linear
regression analyses. These findings indicate that antioxidant vitamins may be important in the underlying cause and
prevention of hypertension. Further studies in this important area are warranted. (Hypertension. 2002;40:810-816.)

Experimental studies have demonstrated that oxidation of
LDL plays an important role in the development and
progression of atherosclerosis in animal models.1­3 Observa-
tional epidemiologic studies have also documented an inverse
association between increased intake of antioxidant vitamins
such as vitamin E, -carotene, and vitamin C and reduced
morbidity and mortality rates from coronary heart disease.1­6
However, results from several recently published, large,
randomized, controlled clinical trials, which provide the best
evidence for a causal relation, do not support the hypothesis
that vitamin E or -carotene supplementation has a protective
effect on coronary heart disease or cardiovascular disease as
whole.7­9 Given the wide use of antioxidant vitamins in the
US general population, it is important to examine the bene-
ficial as well as potential adverse effects of vitamin supple-
mentation in this context.
Observational epidemiologic studies have suggested an
inverse association between dietary intake or serum level of
vitamin C and blood pressure (BP).10­15 Several small and
short-term clinical trials in which the effect of vitamin C
supplements on BP was examined have yielded inconsistent
findings.16­19 There are sparse data on the relation between
other antioxidant vitamins and BP in human populations.20­22
We took advantage of a large representative sample of the US
general population to examine the relation of serum antioxi-
dant vitamins, including vitamins A, C, and E, -carotene,
and -carotene to BP. We hypothesized that serum levels of
antioxidant vitamins might be inversely related to BP levels
as well as risk of hypertension.
Methods
Study Participants
The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) was conducted by the National Center for Health
Statistics between 1988 and 1994. The details of study participants
and study methods have been published elsewhere.23 In brief, a
stratified multistage probability design was used to obtain a repre-
sentative sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized US general
population.23 The design included oversampling of the very young,
the elderly, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican-Americans to im-
prove the precision of estimates in these groups. A total of 18 825
persons 20 years of age participated in NHANES III. For the
current analysis, participants were excluded if their self-reported
race/ethnicity was not non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or
Mexican-American (n715). Participants were also excluded from
the analysis if there was a lack of data on BP (n348) or serum
antioxidant vitamin levels (n2445). A total of 6755 non-Hispanic
whites, 4250 non-Hispanic blacks, and 4312 Mexican-Americans
20 years of age met the inclusion criteria and were included in the
current analysis. In addition, 2544 participants who were currently
taking antihypertensive medications were further excluded from the

variable.
Measurements
The NHANES III data collection included a standardized home
interview followed by a detailed physical examination in a mobile
examination center or the participant's home. Information on a wide
variety of sociodemographic, medical history, nutritional history,
and family history questions, such as self-reported age, race/ethnic-
ity, gender, years of education completed, history of smoking,
diabetes, and hypertension, use of antihypertensive medication,
alcohol consumption, use of vitamin supplements, and 24-hour
dietary recall, were obtained during the home interview.23
BP was measured 3 times during the home interview and during
the subsequent evaluation at the mobile examination center by
trained observers using a standard protocol.23 BP for individual
participants was calculated as the average of all available systolic
and diastolic readings. Hypertension was defined as the presence of
a mean systolic BP 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP 90 mm Hg
and/or use of antihypertensive medication. Body weight and height
were measured according to a standard protocol, and body mass
index was calculated as an index for obesity.
A blood sample was collected at the second visit. Serum levels of
antioxidant vitamins, including vitamin A, -carotene, -carotene,
vitamin C, and vitamin E were measured at the National Center for
Environmental Health of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (Atlanta, Ga) by isocratic high-performance liquid
chromatography.24
Statistical Analyses
Mean values for age, BP, body mass index, dietary nutrient intake,
serum antioxidant vitamins, and other continuous variables, as well
as percentages for gender, race/ethnicity, and other categoric vari-
ables, were calculated by hypertension status. The statistical signif-
icance of differences was examined by means of Student t test
(continuous variables) and the 2 test (categoric variables). The
agreement between serum level of vitamins and supplement use or
dietary intake was assessed by Pearson correlation coefficients (r).
Bivariate relations were explored by plotting each serum antiox-
idant vitamin versus BP, which does not impose any statistical
modeling assumptions on the associations. The linearity of the
association was tested by means of correlation analysis. Linear
regression analysis was used to assess the association between serum
antioxidant vitamin levels and BP. Logistic regression analysis was
used to explore the relation between serum antioxidant vitamin levels
and odds of hypertension. Estimated regression coefficients or odds
ratios are reported as the difference in BP (mm Hg) or odds of
hypertension associated with a 1 SD increment in serum antioxidant
vitamin levels. Confounding of the association between BP and
antioxidant vitamin levels was evaluated by adding possible con-
founders to the models. Two final models, age-, gender-, and
race-adjusted model and multivariate-adjusted model (additional
adjustment for education, alcohol consumption, and body mass
index, dietary intake of sodium, potassium, saturated fat, and total
energy) are presented. All statistical analyses were performed with
the use of Stata software, which included functions for the analysis
of complex survey data.25
Results
The general characteristics of study participants by hyperten-
sion status are presented in Table 1. On average, normoten-
sives were 20 years younger than hypertensives. The percent-
ages of male and non-Hispanic whites were similar between
the two groups, whereas normotensives had a lower propor-
tion of non-Hispanic blacks and a higher proportion of high
school graduates and participants who consumed alcohol at
least once per week. The prevalence of self-reported history
of diabetes was significantly higher in hypertensives than in
normotensives. As expected, normotensives had a lower
mean body mass index and systolic and diastolic BP than
their hypertensive counterparts. Normotensives reported a
higher intake of dietary saturated fat and a lower intake of
sodium and potassium compared with hypertensives. Mean

serum levels of antioxidant vitamins, including vitamins A,
C, and E, and -carotene, were significantly lower in normo-
tensives compared with hypertensives.
The self-reported vitamin supplement use during the past
month was significantly correlated with serum levels of
vitamin A (r0.13), vitamin C (r0.31), vitamin E (r0.32),
-carotene (r0.15), and -carotene (r0.18) among study
participants. Dietary intake of vitamins from 24-hour recall
was also significantly associated with serum levels of vitamin
A (r0.09), vitamin C (r0.23), vitamin E (r0.04),
-carotene (r0.19), and -carotene (r0.16).
Antioxidant Vitamins and Hypertension
Table 2 depicts the odds ratios and 95% CIs for hypertension
associated with 1 SD difference in level of serum vitamin A
(16.2 g/dL), -carotene (4.8 g/dL), -carotene (20.4
g/dL), vitamin C (0.47 mg/dL), and vitamin E (496 g/dL).
After adjustment for age, gender, and race/ethnicity, serum
vitamins A and E were significantly associated with a higher
odds of hypertension, whereas serum -carotene, -carotene,
and vitamin C were significantly associated with a lower odds
of hypertension. After additional adjustment for education,
alcohol consumption, body mass index, history of diabetes,
dietary intake of sodium, potassium, saturated fat, and total
energy, the relation between level of serum antioxidant
vitamins and odds of hypertension remained significant,
except for serum vitamin C. The odds ratio of hypertension
associated with serum vitamin C was diminished and became
nonsignificant in the multivariate-adjusted model. The rela-
tion between serum antioxidant vitamins and hypertension
was consistent among subgroups defined by age, gender, and
race/ethnicity (Table 3).

and E remained positively and significantly associated with
systolic and diastolic BP. In addition, -carotene and
-carotene were inversely and significantly associated with
systolic BP, whereas vitamin C was inversely and signifi-
cantly associated with diastolic BP in multivariate-adjusted
models.
Table 5 shows multivariate-adjusted differences in systolic
and diastolic BP associated with a 1 SD difference in level of
serum antioxidant vitamins among specified subgroups by
age, gender, race/ethnicity, and hypertension status. Serum
vitamin A was positively and significantly associated with
both systolic and diastolic BP in each subgroup, except in
participants with hypertension. Serum -carotene was in-
versely and significantly related to systolic BP among most of
the subgroups. Serum -carotene was inversely related to
both systolic and diastolic BP in participants who were
younger than 60 years, in women and in whites, and was
related to systolic BP in men and in normotensives. Serum
vitamin C was inversely associated with diastolic BP in
participants who were younger than 60 years, in men and
women, and in hypertensives and normotensives. In addition,
serum vitamin C was inversely and significantly associated
with both systolic and diastolic BP among blacks. Serum
vitamin E was positively associated with both systolic and
diastolic BP among most of the subgroups.
Discussion
Our study is one of the first to identify a significant and
inverse relation between serum levels of -carotene and
-carotene and risk of hypertension. It is also one of the first
to recognize a significant and positive relation between serum
levels of vitamin A and E and risk of hypertension in a human
population. These relations were independent of age, gender,
race, and other important risk factors for hypertension. In
addition, our study identified a significant inverse relation
between serum vitamin C and diastolic BP. These results
suggest that antioxidant vitamins may play an important role
in the underlying cause and prevention of hypertension. As
such, they have important public health and clinical
implications.
Hypertension, a major risk factor for coronary heart dis-
ease, stroke, congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease,
and peripheral vascular disease, affects as many as 50 million
adult Americans.26 More than $34.4 billion is spent annually
for medications, office visits, and laboratory tests related to
treatment of hypertension in the US population.27 Epidemio-
logic studies and clinical trials have demonstrated that nutri-
tional factors play an important role in the underlying cause
and prevention of hypertension.28 The findings from our
study provide new insights regarding the potential role of
various antioxidant vitamins in modulating BP.
Experimental studies in animal models suggest that oxida-
tive stress may be important in the pathogenesis of hyperten-
sion or in the underlying cause of arterial damage related to
hypertension.29,30 However, there are scarce data in the
relation between oxidative stress or antioxidants and BP in
human populations. In cross-sectional studies, higher serum
levels or dietary intake of vitamin C have been consistently
and significantly related to lower systolic and diastolic BP
among middle-aged or elderly populations.10­15 However,
there was insufficient attention to confounding effects by
other dietary factors in most of these studies.31 Several small

clinical trials that have tested the effect of vitamin C
supplementation on BP have yielded inconsistent find-
ings.16­19 For example, Fotherby and colleagues17 found that
BP was not reduced after supplementation with 500 mg
vitamin C per day for 3 months in a double-blind,
randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study. However,
daytime levels of ambulatory systolic BP was slightly but
significantly reduced, by 2.0 mm Hg (95% CI, 0 to
3.9 mm Hg), in the vitamin C supplementation phase
compared with the placebo control phase. Our study
identified an inverse association between serum vitamin C
level and risk of hypertension and BP in age, gender, and
race-adjusted analyses. After further adjustment for other
risk factors including dietary nutrients, serum vitamin C
level was only significantly related to diastolic BP. Fur-
thermore, our study indicated that serum vitamin C level
was significantly related to both systolic and diastolic BP
in blacks who had a lower mean level of serum vitamin C.
These findings might imply that low intake of dietary
vitamin C related to increased risk of hypertension.
To the best our knowledge, the present study is the first to
have examined the relation between serum carotene levels
and BP in a human population. Our study identified an
inverse relation between serum levels of -carotene and
-carotene and risk of hypertension and systolic BP. In a
randomized crossover trial conducted in 21 hypertensive
patients, a combination of antioxidants consisting of 200 mg
of zinc sulfate, 500 mg of vitamin C, 600 mg of -tocopherol,
and 30 mg of -carotene per day significantly lowered
systolic BP.32 However, in a larger randomized controlled

trial conducted in 297 participants, combined antioxidant
vitamin capsules providing 400 IU vitamin E, 500 mg vitamin
C, and 6 mg -carotene per day did not reduce BP during a
2- to 4-month period of intervention.33 Future studies are
required to confirm our findings and to examine the indepen-
dent effect of carotene on BP.
Our study is one of the first to report a strong, independent,
and positive association between higher serum vitamin A
level and increased risk of hypertension and BP in a large
population sample. The association was consistent across age,
gender, and race groups. This finding is in conflict with the
results from two previous reports. In the First National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey population, a significant
decrease in dietary intake of vitamin A was identified in
hypertensives compared with normotensives.34 In addition, a
significant decrease in plasma vitamin A level was reported
in 105 hypertensive patients compared with 100 normoten-
sive controls.29 In the NHANES III study population, we have
also identified a positive and significant association between
serum vitamin A level and risk of chronic kidney disease.35
Serum level of vitamin E was significantly and positively
related with both systolic and diastolic BP in our study.
Experimental studies have shown that vitamin E decreases
BP in animal models.36,37 However, data from human popu-
lations are more inconsistent. For example, epidemiologic
studies have reported that serum level of vitamin E is
reduced29 or is no different38 in hypertensive patients com-
pared with normotensive control subjects. Palumbo et al20
found that vitamin E supplementation had no effect on BP in
treated hypertensive patients in a randomized, controlled,
open trial. Our findings of a positive and independent relation
between serum vitamin E and BP call for further investigation
in this important area.
Several large clinical trials, which examined the effect of
-carotene or vitamin E supplements on risk of cardiovascu-
lar disease, have reported negative results.7­9 For example,
Yusuf and colleagues9 summarized 4 major clinical trials of
vitamin E supplementation with a total of 26 020 participants
in the treatment group and 25 980 participants in the placebo
control group. The relative risk of cardiovascular disease
associated with vitamin E supplementation was 0.97, with a
95% CI from 0.92 to 1.02 (P0.27). The recently completed
Heart Protection Study indicates that antioxidant vitamin
supplementation (650 mg vitamin E, 250 mg vitamin C, and
20 mg -carotene) does not reduce risk of cardiovascular
disease among 20 500 participants during 5 years of follow-
up.39,40 Our study raises new concerns on vitamin A and E
supplement use in the general population.
Our findings are noteworthy because they are based on
experience in a large, representative sample of the US general
population, where careful measurement of BP and serum
vitamin levels allowed for more reliable assessment of the
association, and it was possible to adjust for consumption of
dietary nutrient and other important covariables. However,
the cross-sectional study design used in NHANES III hinders
making inferences regarding causality between antioxidant
vitamins and BP. For instance, we cannot establish the
temporal relation between serum levels of antioxidant vita-
mins and BP. In addition, oversampling some subgroups and
imperfect response rates may affect the representation of the
sample. Furthermore, serum level of antioxidant vitamins
may be a marker for other confounding factors. If the relation
between antioxidant vitamins and risk of hypertension is
confirmed in large cohort studies, then randomized, con-
trolled trials with sufficient sample size and intervention
duration will be needed to test for causality.
Perspectives
Our study findings indicate that vitamin C, -carotene, and
-carotene are inversely associated with BP, whereas vita-
mins A and E are positively associated with BP. These
relations are stronger in normotensive and younger partici-
pants. These findings suggest that antioxidant vitamins may
play an important role in the underlying cause and prevention
of hypertension. With increased recognition of oxidative
stress in the pathogenesis of hypertension and wide use of
antioxidant vitamins in the general population, further inves-
tigations are warranted in this important area.
