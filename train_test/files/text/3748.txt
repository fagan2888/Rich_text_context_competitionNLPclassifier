Abstract
Objective: To investigate the role of positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) in evaluating the feasibility of skin-sparing mastectomy in patients with
locally-advanced breast cancer (LABC) who will undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) by
evaluating the sensitivity and specificity of PET and MRI compared with skin biopsy results before
and after NAC treatment.
Methods: Patients with LABC who were treated with NAC between November 2013 and
November 2015 were included in this study. Demographic, clinical, radiological and histopatho-
logical features of the patients were recorded.
Results: A total of 30 patients were included in the study with a mean age of 52.6 years (range, 35­
70 years). Sensitivity and specificity for detecting skin involvement in LABC was 100%/10% (62%/
85%) with MRI and 60%/80% (12%/92%) with PET before (after) NAC, respectively. When
radiological skin involvement was assessed in relation to the final histopathological results, the
preNAC PET results and histopathological skin involvement were not significantly different; and
there was no difference between postNAC MRI and histopathological skin involvement.
Conclusions: As preNAC PETand postNAC MRI more accurately determined skin involvement,
it might be possible to use these two radiological evaluation methods together to assess patient
suitability for skin-sparing mastectomy in selected patients.

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common cancer
among women.1 Although the frequency of
breast cancer is increasing, the rates of
mortality are decreasing in developed coun-
tries but are increasing in low-to-middle
income countries.2 The most important rea-
sons for this increase in frequency are the
widespread use of screening mammography
combined with increased life span, changes
in reproductive functions, environmental
factors, lack of exercise, stress, and
increased consumption of products contain-
ing additives.2 Locally-advanced breast
cancer (LABC) accounts for 5­15% of
newly diagnosed breast cancers in developed
countries.2 In the low-to-middle income
countries, the LABC rate is over 50%.3
LABC is a heterogeneous group of patients
in terms of staging and the risk of local/
regional and systemic recurrence is high.4
LABC includes clinical stage IIB (T3N0M0)
and stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC.5 The high
rate of systemic metastases in LABC
patients results in treatment being initiated
with chemotherapy.5 In the last 20 years,
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has
begun to be applied as a standard treatment
in patients with LABC.5,6 With the new
generation of chemotherapeutic agents, the
complete pathological response rate has
reached 30%.7 The application of chemo-
therapy prior to surgical treatment has the
advantage of determining the sensitivity of
the tumour to chemotherapy and allows the
tumour to shrink and facilitates breast-
conserving surgery in selected cases.5,8 The
most important disadvantages of NAC are
tumour progression and the difficulty of
surgical treatment in chemotherapy-insensi-
tive patients.8 In previous studies, NAC
showed partial responses in 70­80% and
complete clinical responses in 15­20% of
patients with stage IIIA and IIIB disease.9­14
Factors such as complete resolution of skin
swelling as a result of chemotherapy, resi-
dual mass < 5 cm (appropriate breast/
tumour ratio), no skin or thorax wall inva-
sion, no suspected widespread microcalcifi-
cation and multicentricity on
mammography, tumour being unifocal or
multifocal, having no contraindications for
radiotherapy and the patient requesting
breast-conserving surgery were considered
for breast-conserving surgery.15 In patients
with skin involvement in LABC, it has been
found that the involvement regressed and
completely resolved following chemother-
apy.16 If this regression, which can be con-
firmed by histopathological examination,
could be predicted before NAC, then
skin-sparing mastectomy and/or prosthesis
may be applied to patients in whom mast-
ectomy was planned after NAC therapy.
In cases where breast-conserving surgery is
not performed due to multifocal and multi-
centric disease, oncoplastic surgeries per-
formed via this method had positive findings
and reliable oncological results were
reported.16
Radiological imaging methods are able to
successfully assess skin involvement.17 In
particular, dynamic contrast-enhanced mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI) and onco-
logical positron emission tomography (PET)
are widely used to evaluate treatment
response and to help plan surgery in patients
with LABC treated with NAC.18­21
This study investigated the role of PET
and MRI in evaluating the feasibility of
skin-sparing mastectomy in patients with
LABC who will undergo NAC by evaluating
the sensitivity and specificity of PET and

Patients and methods
Study population
This prospective observational study
enrolled consecutive patients with LABC
who were due to be treated with NAC in the
Department of General Surgery, Faculty of
Medicine, Bezmialem Vakif University,
Istanbul, Turkey between November 2013
and November 2015. Demographic, clinical,
radiological and histopathological features
of the patients were recorded. The exclusion
criteria were as follows: (i) patients who did
not accept skin-sparing mastectomy;
(ii) patients who did not agree to participate
in the study; (iii) patients who definitely had
skin involvement or those who were
suspected of having skin involvement after
NAC; (iv) patients who had preNAC satel-
lite skin lesions.
Ethics committee approval for this study
was obtained from the local Ethics
Committee of the Faculty of Medicine,
Bezmialem Vakif University, Istanbul,
Turkey (no. 71306642/050-01-04/262).
Patients who agreed to participate in the
study provided written informed consent. All
study procedures were carried out in accord-
ance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Pretreatment evaluation
Patients with LABC who had stage IIB­IIIC
disease underwent a full physical
examination and radiological investigations
(mammography, ultrasonography, MRI). A
pathological diagnosis was made using a
routine core biopsy. PET/computed tomo-
graphy (PET/CT) was undertaken to inves-
tigate the presence of systemic metastases.
All fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT
examinations were performed using a PET/
CT scanner combined with 16-multi-detec-
tor computed tomography (Biograph 16
PET/CT system; Siemens Medical
Solutions, Knoxville, USA). Patients were
instructed to fast for 5h before the scan, and
blood glucose was measured immediately
before an intraven-ous injection of 4.0 MBq/
kg body weight FDG. No patients showed a
blood glucose level >160 mg/dl. Static
emission images were obtained approxi-
mately 60 min after the FDG injection. For
attenuation correc-tion and anatomical
localization, helical CT scans from the top
of the head to the bottom of the feet were
obtained. Immediately after completion of
the CT, PET images of the region from the
head to the mid-thigh were acquired for
3 min per bed position. Attenuation-cor-
rected PET images were reconstructed with
an ordered-subset expectation maximization
iterative reconstruction algorithm (18 sub-
sets, 2 iterations).22 SUVmax values were
calculated as described previously.23 In
patients with suspected clinical or radiolo-
gical skin involvement, an additional skin
biopsy was performed and the presence of
tumour was recorded. Two dimensional
regions of interest were placed in areas of
tracer uptake and measures of 18F-fluoro-
deoxyglucose accumulation were recorded,
including SUVmax, SUVmean. A back-
ground SUVmax was also measured for
each examination.24 A SUVmax cut-off
value for skin involvement of 5 has been
previously suggested.25 However, this cut-
off value has not been proven to be applic-
able to all patients. When an elevated FDG
uptake was demonstrated on the PET scan,
this suggested skin involvement, so it was
better to compare scans before and after
NAC.
Systemic treatment and response
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was adminis-
tered using regimens containing taxane and
anthracycline every 3 weeks as described as
follows. Six cycles of the TAC regimen
(75 mg/m2 docetaxel; 50 mg/m2 doxorubicin;
628 Journal of International Medical Research 46(2)
500 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide; all adminis-
tered intravenously every 3 weeks) or four
cycles of the AC regimen (60 mg/m2 doxo-
rubicin; 600 mg m2 cyclophosphamide; all
administered intravenously every 3 weeks)
and four courses of docetaxel (100 mg/m2
administered intravenously every 3 weeks)
were applied. Trastuzumab was added to the
regimens for the treatment of patients with
tumours that were positive for human epi-
dermal growth factor receptor 2 receptor
(HER2). Patients received 6 mg/kg trastuzu-
mab intravenously every 3 weeks concomi-
tantly with all chemotherapy cycles, starting
with a loading dose of 8 mg/kg trastuzumab
intravenously on day 1 of the first AC
regimen. If chemotherapy was discontinued
early, the missed trastuzumab cycles were
given postoperatively. Total pre- and post-
operative duration of trastuzumab treat-
ment was 1 year.
Pathological complete response to
chemotherapy (pCR) was defined as com-
plete resolution of the tumour both in the
breast and axilla. Partial response (pPR) was
defined as ! 30% shrinkage of the largest
diameter of the tumour. Minimal regression
or stabilization of the tumour was defined as
unresponsiveness to chemotherapy. Routine
radiotherapy and hormone therapy in hor-
mone receptor-positive patients were
applied following surgery.
Receptor immunohistochemistry
Routine immunohistochemistry was per-
formed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
breast cancer tissues. Oestrogen receptor
(ER) (Clone SP1; Thermo Fisher Scientific
Inc., Rockford, IL, USA) and progesterone
receptor (PR) (Clone SP2; Thermo Fisher
Scientific Inc.) status was considered as posi-
tive if> 10% of tumour cells showed staining.
An immunohistochemical score of 3 þ or
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
(INFORM HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe
Cocktail Assay; Ventana Medical Systems,
Tuscon, Arizona, USA) for HER2 was
accepted as HER2 positivity.
A mindbomb E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1
(MIB-1) clone (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark)
was used for the immunohistochemical ana-
lysis of Ki-67. Immunohistochemical staining
was quantitatively evaluated by light micros-
copy, in which the entire tissue section was
scanned at low-power magnification (Â10) to
determine areas with the highest number of
positive nuclei (hot-spots) within the invasive
component. Ki-67 was expressed as the per-
centage of cells positive for MIB-1 among a
total of at least 1000 malignant cells at high-
power magnification (Â40). Nuclear staining
of the tumour cells was considered negative
if 14% were stained for Ki-67 and as posi-
tive if> 14% were stained for KI-67.
The final pathological response was
assessed using the Miller­Payne grading
system, in which pathological response is
divided into five grades based on a
comparison of tumour cellularity between
the preNAC core biopsy and a definitive
surgical specimen. The Miller­Payne grad-
ing system is as follows: grade 1: no change
or some minor alteration in individual
malignant cells, but no reduction in overall
cellularity; grade 2: a minor loss of tumour
cells, but overall cellularity remains high
with up to 30% reduction of cellularity;
grade 3: between an estimated 30% and
90% reduction in tumour cellularity; grade
4: a marked disappearance of > 90% of
tumour cells such that only small clusters
or widely dispersed individual cells remain
(almost pCR); and grade 5: no invasive
malignant cells identifiable in sections from
the site of the tumour (pCR).
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
the SPSSÕ statistical package, version 16.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. Descriptive statistical methods
(mean, number, percentage, median) were
Malya et al. 629
used to evaluate the data. For survival
analyses, the time between the first patho-
logical diagnosis of the tumour and the
local/regional first recurrence of the disease
was calculated as local recurrence-free sur-
vival and time to local/regional recurrence
of the disease or distant organ metastasis
was calculated as disease-free survival.
Follow-up time was defined as the time
between first pathological diagnosis date
and the last appointment date for the
patient. Survival calculations were under-
taken using the Kaplan­Meier method. The
log-rank univariate analysis test was used to
investigate tumour and patient characteris-
tics; and the effects of skin involvement on
local and systemic recurrence. The effects of
multiple factors on skin involvement were
investigated by Cox regression test in
multivariate analyses and the proportional
differences between the groups were calcu-
lated using 2-test (Continuity Correction,
Fisher's Exact Test). The relationship
between skin involvement in PET and
MRI findings with histopathological skin
involvement was assessed using McNemar's
test. A P-value 0.05 was considered statis-
tically significant.
Results
A total of 30 patients with LABC were
enrolled in the study (mean age, 52.6 years;
range, 35­70 years). The detailed character-
istics of the tumours are presented in
Table 1. Complete response rates following
NAC were five (16.7%), two (6.7%) and
three (10.0%) patients when using PET,
MRI and histopathology, respectively.
According to the presence of tumour recep-
tors, 10 (33.3%) patients were evaluated
as luminal A, nine (30.0%) were evaluated
as luminal B, six (20.0%) were evaluated as
HER2-enriched and five (16.7%) were eval-
uated as triple-negative. Eighteen (60.0%)
patients were surgically treated with classical
mastectomy, 10 (33.3%) with breast-
conserving surgery and two (6.7%) with
skin-sparing mastectomy.
The presence of skin involvement before
and after NAC was assessed by PET and
MRI (Table 2). Patients with clinical and
radiological evidence of skin involvement
were confirmed using a skin biopsy before
NAC was undertaken. After NAC, skin
involvement was recorded in surgical speci-
mens using a histopathological examination.
There was skin involvement in 14 (46.7%)
patients on PET scans before NAC and in
three (10.0%) patients on PET scans after
NAC. Skin involvement was recorded in 29
(96.7%) patients on MRI scans before NAC
and in 12 (40.0%) on MRI scans after NAC.
The final histopathological examinations
found skin involvement in 16 (53.3%)
patients.
When radiological skin involvement was
assessed in relation to the final histopatho-
logical results, the preNAC PET results and
histopathological skin involvement were not
significantly different (Table 3). PostNAC
PET and histopathological skin involvement
were significantly different (P ¼ 0.001).
PreNAC MRI and histopathological skin
involvement were also significantly different
(P ¼ 0.001), but there was no significant
difference between postNAC MRI and
histopathological skin involvement. These
results suggest that preNAC PET and
postNAC MRI more accurately identified
skin involvement than postNAC PET and
preNAC MRI. Table 4 presents the sensi-
tivity, specificity, positive predictive value
(PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV)
of preNAC PET, postNAC PET, preNAC
MRI and postNAC MRI for predicting skin
involvement.
There was no significant relationship
between preNAC multifocality and skin
involvement (data not shown). Regression
of skin involvement was observed with the
increase of radiological and pathological
response given to neoadjuvant therapy
(data not shown). Seven of 18 patients who
630 Journal of International Medical Research 46(2)
underwent classical mastectomy were histo-
pathologically negative for skin involvement
following surgery. Skin involvement was
histopathologically negative in six of 10
patients who underwent breast-conserving
surgery and in one of two patients who
underwent skin-sparing mastectomy.
Systemic and axillary recurrence was
observed during follow-up in the one patient
with skin involvement who underwent skin-
sparing mastectomy. This patient's preNAC
MRI and PET scans identified skin

The mean duration of follow-up was 22.4
months. Local recurrence was observed in
five (16.7%) patients. Both local and sys-
temic recurrence occurred in one of these
patients. Axillary recurrence occurred in
three patients (10.0%). There was no sig-
nificant relationship between postNAC
MRI and PET or histopathological skin
involvement and local or systemic recur-
rence (data not shown). There was no
significant relationship between local and
systemic recurrence and the type of surgery
undertaken (data not shown). There was no
significant relationship between the presence
of ER, PR, HER2 receptors or Ki-67 pro-
tein and histopathological skin involvement
(data not shown). As the Ki-67 values of
patients are different and as it is not related
to skin involvement, the Ki-67 data are not
presented in Table 1.
Discussion
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is accepted as
the standard treatment approach in LABC.8
Evaluation of the response to NAC in
LABC is traditionally performed by ultra-
sonography or mammography. However,
with these methods, it is not always possible
to distinguish residual tumour from fibrosis.
At present, 18F-FDG PET/CT and MRI are
frequently used in clinical practice. Several
studies suggest the combined use of MRI
and PET for the prediction of histopatho-
logical complete response after NAC.24­29
Determination of the presence and extent
of residual tumour after NAC is also
important in planning the surgical approach
to be performed. Effective use of preopera-
tive imaging methods allows appropriate
surgery to be planned and successfully
applied to the patient.30 However, consider-
ation should be given to which imaging
method is more accurate at this stage.31,32 A
previous study that compared the efficacy of
MRI to determine the histopathological
response to NAC concluded that its sensi-
tivity was 68% and specificity was 91%.33 In
this present study, these values were 100%/
10% for MRI before NAC and 62%/85%
for MRI after NAC, respectively. A previ-
ous study that investigated the efficacy of
PET for predicting the histopathological
response to NAC concluded that the

PET may be able to demonstrate the pres-
ence of viable tumour cells more effectively,
but it may be difficult to differentiate
between the presence of inflammation and
tumour cells. MRI can produce a false
`complete response' result when, despite
tumour cell destruction by the chemother-
apy, a residual tumour cell population
remains. According to these results, consid-
ering the high sensitivity specivity and
positive predictive value of PET before
NAC and of MRI after NAC, it may be
appropriate to use the two modalities
together for effective and appropriate pre-
operative planning.
Skin-sparing mastectomy has become
widely used in recent years, especially in
patients undergoing prophylactic mastec-
tomy or those with early-stage breast
cancer. It was first described by Freeman
in 196235 and modified by Toth and Lappert
in 1991.36 Using this method, as much skin
as possible is spared while the nipple areola
complex is resected with breast tissue.
Sparing the natural skin covering also
increases the aesthetic success of the recon-
struction methods. However, there are still
concerns about its success for oncological
outcomes and its negative effects on local
and systemic recurrence when compared
with standard mastectomy.37,38 However,
studies have shown that breast-conserving
mastectomy and classical mastectomy have
similar local and systemic recurrence
rates.16,39 Despite the controversial applica-
tion of skin-sparing mastectomy, especially
in advanced breast cancer, successful results
of recent applications in this group of
patients have been reported.39 A previous
study that compared skin-sparing mastec-
tomy and classical mastectomy demon-
strated no significant difference in the
local, regional, and systemic recurrence
rates between these two techniques despite
the fact that the local recurrence rate
increases with increased stage.40 Similarly,
another study that evaluated skin-sparing
mastectomy in LABC found that irrespect-
ive of the histopathological complete
response rate, skin-sparing mastectomy
was not associated with high local recur-
rence.41 In NAC-treated patients undergo-
ing breast-conserving surgery and classical
mastectomy, both surgeries showed similar
results for local recurrence.11,12 Prospective
studies that investigate the effect of different
surgical techniques over longer follow-up
periods may lead to more accurate findings.
Predicting histopathological complete
response, demonstrating axillary nodal
involvement, and measuring biological mar-
kers have been widely applied in studies that
have aimed to determine the effectiveness of
the radiological methods used in the evalu-
ation of treatment response after NAC.42
However, to the best of our knowledge, no
studies have specifically investigated the
effectiveness of various radiological evalu-
ation methods for predicting skin involve-
ment. In this present study, the role of PET
and MRI for identifying skin involvement
preNAC and postNAC was investigated in
order to demonstrate the feasibility of using
skin-sparing mastectomy. When these mod-
alities were evaluated separately before and
after NAC, it was concluded that preNAC
PET and postNAC MRI more accurately
identified skin involvement.
This present study had several limita-
tions. First, the number of patients was
small. Secondly, the follow-up period was
relatively short. Extending the follow-up
period would allow for a more reliable
evaluation of local and systemic recurrence
rates to be made.
In conclusion, preNAC PET and
postNAC MRI more accurately determined
skin involvement, so it might be possible to
use these two radiological evaluation meth-
ods together to assess patient suitability
