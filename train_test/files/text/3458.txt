Introduction
Although lifetime employment was once commonplace, it
is declining in the 21st century. Social, economic, and polit-
ical forces have aligned to make labor more precarious
(Kalleberg, 2009, p. 8). Phenomena such as the economic
crisis and the change from a manufacturing to a service and
high-technology economy have resulted in the curtailment
of salaries, downsized privileges, uncertain career expecta-
tions, job losses, and job insecurity (see, for example,
Büchtemann & Quack, 1989; Standing, 1999, 2014). These
phenomena have increased the precarity of workers. The
demand for increased flexibility and the reduction of labor
costs have led employers to seek a more flexible workforce
(Kalleberg, 2001; Skorstad & Ramsdal, 2012). By hiring
temporary workers, employers gain organizational flexibil-
ity (Smith, 1997). This flexibility has resulted in precarious
labor relations in which people, especially those in the most
vulnerable groups such as migrants, younger and older
workers, and less-educated workers, are at risk of slipping
into a permanent state of precarity.
The retrenchment of social security and the dominant
neoliberal ideology in recent decades contributed to policies
in which unemployment benefits are made unattractive and
hard to qualify for. These policies promote paid labor as a
fundamental need that makes us happy, defines us, and gives
us satisfaction, suggesting that those who belong to the
precariat have only themselves to blame (Standing, 2011).
Research shows that precarious workers feel powerless to
change their work (Ashford, Lee, & Bobko, 1989) and their
governmental relations (Standing, 2011). The above-men-
tioned changes have far-reaching consequences for precari-
ous workers (see, for example, Standing, 2011), as they
restrain their social, economic, and psychological needs.
A body of research has examined how precarious workers
perceive their uncertainty (e.g., Schmidt, 1999) and obliga-
tions (Robinson, Kraatz, & Rousseau, 1994) and the effects
of their precarious labor situation on their social, psychologi-
cal, and economic well-being (e.g., Benach, Vives, Tarafa,
Delclos, & Muntaner, 2016; Bosmans, Hardonk, De Cuyper,
& Vanroelen, 2016). There is also a body of research on how
a government's labor market and social security policies
contribute to precarity through precarious work relations
(see, for example, Rodgers, 2004). There is, however, no
research on the social, psychological, and economic needs of
those who belong to the precariat.

A Job and a Sufficient Income Is Not
Enough: The Needs of the Dutch
Precariat
Hafid Ballafkih1, Joop Zinsmeister1, and Martha Meerman1
Abstract
Although lifetime employment was once commonplace, the situation has changed dramatically over the last century. The
group of precarious workers has increased, and with it, the size of the precariat. Although there is a body of research on how
precarious workers perceive the effect of their precarity on their social, psychological, and economic well-being, there is no
research on the needs of precarious workers. In this article, we report the findings of an exploratory study about precarious
worker's needs. The findings show that the precariat has a diversity of needs, ranging from the need for a higher income to
the need for a change in the discourse on self-reliance. Most of the needs are targeted toward the government and are not
only related to labor. This is, however, contradictory to the ideology of downsizing the welfare state, in which governments
focus on creating more temporary or steppingstone jobs. The needs show that the measures orientated toward the labor
market are insufficient because they meet only a marginal part of the needs of the precariat.

2 SAGE Open
Wilthagen and Tros (2004) argued in the debate on flexi-
bility and security that the needs of employers and workers
should be deliberately synchronized to enhance the flexibil-
ity of workers and the labor markets and enhance the security
of workers in and outside the labor market (p. 169). To com-
bine flexibility and security, a greater insight into the needs
of the precariat is necessary. Understanding their needs is
important because their needs reveal what workers want and
what stops them from satisfying their needs.
We realized that an understanding of precarious workers'
needs would contribute to the debate on the labor flexibility
and social security of the precariat and offer an insight into
the needs that the precariat and precarious workers have
toward the government and employers by focusing on their
labor-related needs. This study, therefore, addressed the fol-
lowing research question: What are the social, economic, and
psychological needs of the precariat regarding labor?
This exploratory research focused on the precariat in an
urban area in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. In the following
sections, we elaborate theoretically on the precariat, precari-
ous workers, and their needs. We end the section with a brief
overview of the social security and legislation systems of the
Netherlands to provide insight into the Dutch context.
Precariat, Precarity, and the Changed
Needs
Identifying a single factor or mechanism that explains the rise
of the precariat and precarious labor is not easy, as work and
work relations are highly diversified and finely woven into
different social, political, and economic systems. Research
from several disciplines on nonstandard employment, includ-
ing precarious work, shows that employment diversification,
the erosion of security that was embedded in labor laws and
collective labor agreements, and the changed status of work-
ers in general (Frade, Darmon, & Laparra, 2004) have
increased precarious work and the precariat (Standing, 1999).
The debate on precarious work, however, is dominated by
globalization, neoliberalism, efficiency, cutbacks in the wel-
fare state, shifting responsibilities (from collective to indi-
vidual responsibility), and commodification.All these aspects
have made the life of workers more insecure.
Research (see, for example, Siegmann & Schiphorst,
2016; Standing, 1999) shows that workers face insecurity
through changing work and governmental relations. Some of
the new relations are perceived by researchers as permanent
changes, whereas others argue that the changes are not per-
manent and that they have adverse effects on employees'
security (see, for example, Vulkan, 2012).
In western societies, social security systems were devel-
oped to offer individuals different forms of security by
sharing insecurities and risks as a society. The idea of soli-
darity--sharing risks and insecurities--has decreased over
time; these days, risks and insecurity are increasingly being
transferred to workers (Standing, 2011). A tremendous
body of research (see, for example, Kalleberg, 2009, 2013;
Rodgers, 2004) shows that work has become much more
precarious, primarily in countries where dismissing perma-
nent workers is subject to greater legal constraints (Rodgers,
2004).
Labor rights, as argued by Standing (2014), resulted in a
fictitious decommodification of labor that made workers
dependent on wage labor (p. 967). In the resulting recom-
modification (i.e., treating labor power as a commodity that
can be bought and sold), governments played an ambiguous
role. Workers were exposed to the flexibility of employers'
needs and were expected by governments to market their
own labor. Governments enforced self-responsibility by cut-
ting back and placing conditions on social benefits, reducing
social protection and being anti-collective.
The combined effects of social and labor security retrench-
ment changed the relations between workers and employers
and between workers and government. Theories on human
needs (e.g., Doyal & Gough, 1991) argue that environmental
factors affect the needs and the role in how needs are
expressed in behavior. One could contend that those who
belong to the precariat, as argued by Standing (2011), func-
tion poorly because their needs are not fulfilled (see, for
example, Doyal & Gough, 1991). Standing (2011) asserted
that the precariat is able to identify what it wishes to combat
and what it wants to construct, hinting at the changed needs.
Precariat and Precarious Workers1
Standing (2011) argued that the precariat is a nascent class, if
not a settled and slowly increasing class.2 Others, such as
Allen (2014), argue that the precariat is a bogus concept and
deny that it exists as a separate entity from the rest of the
working class. However, he does recognize the existence of
the precarity that results from new labor relations. The pre-
cariat is defined by its members'economic opportunities and
life chances, which are mainly formed around employment-
related factors (Breen, 2002; Standing, 2011) that distinguish
the employment relation from the ordinary employment rela-
tions of the working class (Erikson & Goldthorpe, 1992).
Due to the insecurity of labor, which originates from unbal-
anced labor contracts,3 specific exchanges become more dif-
fuse, which results in experiences of hardship, insecurity,
and unyielding material constraints for employees (Breen,
2002; Erikson & Goldthorpe, 1992).
Precarious workers have existed for as long as paid labor
has existed, and in several countries around the world, precar-
ity is widespread. The debate about precarious work has re-
emerged due to the growing awareness of the growth of
nonstandard forms of work and the deterioration of labor rela-
tions (Kalleberg, 2009; Rodgers & Rodgers, 1989).According
to Kalleberg (2009), the restructuring of work on a global
scale, the centralization of the service sector, layoffs as a
restructuring strategy, and weak labor ideologies has made
precarity pervasive and generalized to all sectors and jobs.
Ballafkih et al. 3
Precarious workers who belong to the precariat are the
flexi workers, the unemployed, and the detached (Standing,
1999). These groups lack an occupational identity or narra-
tive, as they are flexible in terms of the type of labor they
perform, which results in them experiencing both employ-
ment and job insecurity (Standing, 2014). Precarious work
in general refers to employment that falls below a standard
norm (atypical). This type of work leads to insecurity, eco-
nomic and social inequality, and instability at both the
individual and the collective levels, in which the social and
economic risks are transferred to the individual worker
(see, for example, Beck, 2000; Breen, 1997; Standing,
1999, 2011).
The heterogeneity of nonstandard forms of work--such
as temporary, fixed-term, casual, self-employment, and on-
call and part-time work--does not necessarily imply precari-
ous work or the precarious character of work (Olsthoorn,
2014). Insufficient income to ensure well-being is a more
important factor in the experience of precarity (Büchtemann
& Quack, 1989). The nonstandard forms of employment
increasingly go hand in hand with low wages (minimum
wage), a lack of fringe benefits and protection from unfair
dismissal (e.g., due to redundancy), and low-quality jobs.
The term "working poor" was initially used in non-west-
ern European countries. These days, the term is prominent in
all countries (see, for example, Lansley & Reed, 2013). An
increasing proportion of paid workers in Europe who live on
or marginally above the poverty threshold experience diffi-
culties in making ends meet (Standing, 2011). The cutbacks
in unemployment benefits, if they qualify for additional ben-
efits at all, create difficulties for those who hold nonstandard
jobs. Although the "working poor" are highly correlated with
the precariat and precarity, it is incorrect to equate these
groups (Standing, 2011).
Because of the different definitions and measurement
(see, for example, Olsthoorn, 2014), for this research, we
defined precarious workers as those who are paid a minimum
wage, who perform temporary work with no prospect of a
long-term contract (2 years or more), or who are unemployed
and looking for paid work.4
Needs of the Precariat
The precariat faces many uncertainties, as asserted by, for
example, Standing (2011). Psychological research shows
that certainty and security are two of the basic needs of
human beings (see, for example, Doyal & Gough, 1991;
Herzberg, Mausner, & Snyderman, 1993). In this study, we
consider needs to be the essential or very important require-
ments or requisites the precariat has regarding labor.
Research conducted over the last two decades leaves little
doubt about the effect of subjective insecurity on social, eco-
nomic, physical, and psychological well-being (see, for
example, Breen, 1997; Rodgers, 2004; Sjöberg, 2010;
Vulkan, 2012). The most important latent aspects related to
precarity are the higher risk of unemployment, obtaining pre-
carious contracts, low wages (Schmid, 2010), economized
social services, poverty, and alienation (Standing, 2011).
These aspects indicate that the precariat and precarious
workers score low on the satisfaction of such fundamental
human needs5 as participation, protection, and security.
The recent debate on precarious work is mainly focused
on latent and manifest work-related job insecurity needs. Job
insecurity is experienced when job situations are threatened
due to the powerlessness of workers to keep a preferred job
or a job that generates sufficient income to generate viable
outcomes.
Research (Sjöberg, 2010; Vulkan, 2012) has shown that
expected unemployment (job insecurity) is likely to be as
distressing as actual unemployment. Research has also
shown that unemployment has a destructive effect on the
social, economic, and psychological well-being of workers.
Unemployed people have higher levels of psychological dis-
tress (Henwood & Miles, 1987) and depression (see, for
example, Jahoda, 1982), as not all of their needs are satisfied
or have reached an internal equilibrium.
One of the dominant theories on well-being is Jahoda's
(1982) latent deprivation theory. This theory provides insight
into the benefits that people miss out on when they are unem-
ployed. The precariat is characterized by unemployment. As
Standing (2011) puts it, it is a part of their life. Furthermore,
performing precarious work can be just as damaging in latent
deprivation terms as unemployment (see, for example,
Prause & Dooley, 2001). This makes the theory useful
because the benefits reflect the needs.
Based on the theory, it can be argued that paid work pro-
vides both manifest benefits (associated with needs related
to income) and latent benefits (associated with meeting
social and psychological needs). Both types of benefits fos-
ter manifest and latent needs. Jahoda (1984) stated that
individuals ". . . have deep-seated needs for structuring
their time use and perspective, for enlarging their social
horizon, for participating in collective enterprises where
they can feel useful, for knowing they have a recognised
place in society, and for being active . . ." (p. 298). The
manifest benefits are required to satisfy the basic needs,
which make manifest benefits the main reason why people
perform paid work. The latent benefits arise when people
are engaged in paid work, and these benefits are needed to
satisfy social and psychological well-being. Jahoda (1981)
argues that employment imposes a time structure, creates
shared experiences and contacts, gives goals and purpose,
provides personal status and identity, and enforces activity.
These latent "objective" consequences of employment help
explain way paid work is socially and psychologically sup-
portive. She argues that even when the unemployed are
paid liberally, they do not enjoy their "leisure" because they
losetheirself-respectandtheirsenseoftime.Unemployment
reduces individuals' control over their life situation and life
direction (Fryer, 1987).
4 SAGE Open
The precariat (which mostly consists of unemployed peo-
ple) and precarious workers (flexi workers) lack both mani-
fest and latent benefits, which makes it harder for them to
satisfy certain needs that are related to and dependent on paid
work.
Jahoda (1982) has provided insight into the effects of
unemployment on social psychology. She argued that employ-
ment fulfills manifest and latent functions that meet basic
human needs. She also argued that manifest needs play a role
but that the latent factors explain the main effect on mental
well-being. The manifest factors are those that are related to
the employment terms associated with having a paid job, such
as a salary, a contract, and fringe benefits. The latent need
factors are those that are experienced as a result of employ-
ment, such as time structure, social contact, sharing of com-
mongoals,status,andactivity.Thisimpliesthatunemployment
and job insecurity erode manifest and latent needs.
Other theorists have studied several aspects of insecurity
and developed theories to explain the motivation of people to
work (e.g., Herzberg et al., 1993). Herzberg's two-factor
theory is one of the most widely used theories regarding
workers' needs. The theory incorporates two need­experi-
ence dimensions that refer to first-level factors (objective
aspect) and second-level factors (subjective meaning of an
individual; Herzberg et al., 1993). The job satisfaction fac-
tors are divided into hygiene and motivation factors. The
hygiene factors relate to supervision, interpersonal relations,
physical working conditions, salary, company policy and
administration, and security. Herzberg et al. (1993) defined
job security as "those features of the job situation which lead
to assurance for continued employment, either within the
same company or within the same type of work or profes-
sion" (p. 41). The motivation factors include achievement,
recognition, the work itself, responsibility, and advancement.
These factors lead to positive job attitudes, as they are needed
for self-actualization. Although these factors tell us some-
thing about the needs of those who hold jobs, they also give
us insight into the factors that are important to the precariat
and those who perform precarious labor.
Organizational behaviorists and psychological theorists
on security have shown that humans face essential and exis-
tential insecurities. A basic need provided by society or the
opportunity to fulfill a basic need is essential for humans to
improve their security. Due to external events and pressures
that generate existential insecurities, the precariat and pre-
carious workers are likely to formulate needs that will reduce
the existential insecurities. Given the distinct forms of inse-
curity, the needs will also be related to improving collective,
corporate, and individual security.
In addition to these organizational behaviorists and psy-
chological theorists, Standing (2011), a labor market theo-
rist, contended that those who face precarity lack the seven
forms of labor-related security (p. 10), namely, labor market
security (adequate income-earning opportunities), employ-
ment security (protection against arbitrary dismissal), job
security (ability and opportunity to retain a niche in employ-
ment), work security (protection against accidents and ill-
ness at work), skill reproduction security (opportunity to
acquire skills), income security (assurance of an adequate
and stable income), and representation security (possessing
a collective voice in the labor market).6 These forms of
security reveal the needs of the precariat. These security
forms, supported by the motivation theories of Herzberg
et al. (1993) and Jahoda (1982), were used as a coding
framework in this research.
The Dutch Context
To understand the needs, here we give a brief overview of the
Dutch social security and labor market systems.7 We focus
on the new Participation Act to understand the legal and
labor context of the precariat in the Netherlands.
The structural unemployment of the last decade has
increased the pressure on governmental spending on social
benefits in the Netherlands. The rising costs have led to a
debate about the tenability of the safety net that is offered to
those who receive social benefits. The debate resulted in a
cutback in social benefits that led to "workfare" policies, in
which a large proportion of those dependent on welfare
assistance were required to perform paid or unpaid labor. The
changes also indicate a shift in public opinion on social ben-
efits for those who are or become unemployed.
These workfare policies were supplemented by a retrench-
ment of employment protection laws. The retrenchment was
mainly prompted by the dominant neoclassical economists'
view that more employment could be created if employers
were subject to fewer such laws.
The government aims for a flexicurity model (see, for
example, Wilthagen & Tros, 2004) that primarily improves
the flexibility of the labor market using a "reflexive" labor
law strategy. This strategy is obtained, defined, and modified
in a constant dialogue with the stakeholders, namely, govern-
ment, trade unions, and employers' organizations. The dia-
logue, however, is dominated by a neoliberal ideology. The
social welfare system still offers security but in a reduced
form, leading to more precarity.
The Dutch government aims to achieve the participation
of all citizens through its new "flex law," which is intended
to minimize the gap between those with flexible and those
with permanent contracts. After 2 years, a temporary con-
tract must be converted into a permanent contract. The gov-
ernment hopes that this measure will improve labor market
effects by improving the legal position of employees
(strengthening the position of flex workers), simplifying dis-
missal and reforming unemployment benefits by reducing
their maximum duration.
Along with the flex law, the government also introduced
the Participation Act,8 which promotes work for unem-
ployed, low-skilled, and disabled persons through subsidies
to employers.9 It requires people to perform, according to
Ballafkih et al. 5
their ability, either unpaid work (volunteer work) or socially
useful work (work in addition to labor that does not displace
existing labor) to receive or to apply for social benefits.
It is argued that although these policy initiatives are
quickly phased-in as responses to the crisis, they reflect a
more fundamental reorientation in managing and dealing
with the risks of unemployment (see, for example, Van
Berkel & Van der Aa, 2015).
The Act aims to recalibrate responsibilities between gov-
ernment and citizens. The line of thought in this Act is that
labor, care, and social support are first and foremost the
responsibility of citizens. In this responsibility discourse
(social compulsion), citizens are prospected as individuals
who are self-responsible for their labor participation. This
runs the risk that citizens respond with counter-responsibility
claims (Verhoeven & Tonkens, 2013) and an increase of dis-
trust in the government (Standing, 1999). Those who belong
to the precariat are particularly likely to respond in this man-
ner because they have certain unmet social, psychological,
and economic needs that diminish their self-responsibility.
Although the effects of the flex law and the Participation
Act have not yet been measured, anecdotal evidence sug-
gests that employers terminate temporary contracts just
before the 2 years are up, and that people are not eager to
perform unpaid, socially useful work in return for the social
benefits they receive.
Method
We conducted this exploratory research in an urban area of
Amsterdam. The area has higher levels of unemployment,
poverty, and ethnic diversity than most other urban areas in
the Netherlands. We chose this area because of the increased
likelihood of finding people who belong to the precariat.
However, getting them to participate in the research was dif-
ficult. They were suspicious because they did not see any
benefits for themselves. We often heard "What's in it for
me?" or "If you [the researcher] have a job for me, you're
welcome." The possibility that we were collaborating with
the local government also deterred people from participating
in the research. Due to this suspicion, mainly of government
and government-related organizations, we used existing
groups for focus group meetings. Using focus groups changes
the participants'role from an individual to a collective voice,
which is likely to make them feel more comfortable about
discussing their needs.
Because most of the participants in the groups knew each
other, we thought it likely that some of them would feel
inhibited about speaking freely due to group dynamics, hier-
archy, and power. To reduce this possibility, the groups were
led through an open discussion by a skilled researcher, who
was instructed to generate a rich discussion that involved all
participants. However, not all participants and groups spoke
freely. Some participants showed signs of inhibition (e.g.,
asking for confirmation from other members).
Due to the distrust and the anticipated inhibition, we made
the focus groups as simple and as accessible as possible (free
of obligations and no registration, because not all partici-
pants felt comfortable about giving their family names).
Participants and Procedures
Given the diversity and the broad definition of the precariat,
several focus groups were needed to produce valid results.
All of the groups had different backgrounds, interests, and
storylines. The heterogeneity and exploratory character of
the research led to 29 focus groups, because saturation was
hard to research. The 29 groups consisted of 343 participants,
of whom 180 were men and 163 were women, representing
31 different nationalities. The groups consisted of 12 (SD =
4.1) participants on average and were made up of employed
(precarious workers) and unemployed workers, such as
cleaners, artists, temporary workers, working students and
housewives, of different ages, ethnic backgrounds, legal resi-
dency status, and education levels.
The focus groups were held in February and May 2015.
Each meeting lasted 60­120 min, although not all of the time
was spent talking about the subject. After planning the focus
groups with the key figures, one researcher and one assistant
researcher conducted the groups.The researcher was instructed
to use the prestructured open-ended questions and only to
probe during the discussion when clarity or focus was needed.
The majority of the focus groups were audio-recorded.
Unfortunately, some of the participants did not give permis-
sion to record the focus groups, mainly because of the vulner-
abilityofrecordedvoices(e.g.,thefocusgroupwithMoroccan
women argued that recorded voices are vulnerable in the age
of the Internet). Therefore, we used the reports of and the
notes taken during those focus groups in our analysis. The
audio-recordings of the other focus groups were transcribed.
Data Analysis Method
We used the concepts from the literature to code the tran-
scripts to grasp the needs of the precariat in a grounded the-
ory approach (e.g., Charmaz, 2014). We tried to maximize
the reliability (stability, accuracy, and reproducibility) of this
research by following the guidelines of Krippendorff (2012).
We attempted to maximize reproducibility by having the
transcripts coded and analyzed by two researchers sepa-
rately. The codes and related quotations were analyzed and
organized into needs. After coding, the researchers com-
pared and discussed the differences in findings and interpre-
tations. The findings on which the researchers disagreed
were omitted. Ultimately, a picture of the needs emerged,
and they were discussed by a group of researchers who par-
ticipated as moderators.
However, it is important to note that the needs identified
in this article were raised by the participants but were not
mentioned in all of the focus groups. For some of the needs,
6 SAGE Open
there was a high level of agreement within and across the
groups, and some of the needs were addressed by all groups
(e.g., the need for a higher income), whereas other needs
were only expressed in a particular group. Because of the
exploratory character of the research, we decided to report
all of the needs in this article.
Results Analysis
The Need for Transparency and Trust
One of the most striking needs discussed is the need for
transparency. The respondents said that they needed the gov-
ernment to be clear about what it expects from those who
belong to the precariat, how people can take care of them-
selves without the support of the government, and what the
participation society means besides cutting costs. A respon-
dent who talked about the support of the government said,
We need the government. We cannot do everything by ourselves.
Who is going to repair the asphalt [road], can you do it yourself?
Who's going to pay the hospitals? . . . We pay [Taxes] for
everything [but cannot realized by our self's].
Respondent who talked about clarity said,
Being forced to take part in the "participation society" gives me
the feeling of cost cutting measures [because it is not clear way
we should participate] . . . Participation [society] is just a money
issue.
The data show that it was not clear to the respondents
what the reforms entail and why the responsibility for an
income and labor has been shifted to those who cannot find
or hold a paid job. A respondent said,
The situation we are in now [without work in a participation
society] is the result of bad government policy. What I hear is
that in a participation society, as citizen, I have not only to bear
up the consequences of this policy [responsible for getting a job]
but also build-up this policy on my own without getting any
penny [help] or getting something back for it.
Most of the participants were skeptical about the transpar-
ency of the government; the results show widespread mis-
trust of the local government and politics in general. This
mistrust is fed by the consequences of the regulations and the
way the government checks up on those who receive social
benefits. The respondents said that they need a relationship
with the local government that is based on trust rather than
distrust. The new regulations were viewed by the respon-
dentsasanindicationofdistrustratherthantrust.Furthermore,
the respondents'distrust of the government is fed by its strict
discipline. The respondents experienced the strict discipline
as a paralyzing force that causes counterproductive behavior
regarding the participation society. A respondent who talked
about discipline and transparency said,
In the "participatory society," the government appears to
function on the basis of a business model based on money
making, cost / benefit considerations . . . which again means
even more control [policy]. It [policy/rules of the government]
kills initiatives of citizens . . . initiatives aimed at meaningful/
useful work, that contribute to the neighborhood, are in conflict
with the government's vision.
The cutbacks in social benefits and the government's with-
drawal from public services in the Netherlands as a mean of
reforming the welfare state into a "participation society," in
which the tasks and responsibilities are partly shifted to the
market, society, and mainly the people themselves, seem to
have caused a lack of clarity. This made the role and the poli-
cies of the government unclear to the respondents.
The Need for Help and Understanding
The respondents said that the local government does not know
or understand their needs. They also said that governmental
agencies are keener on applying inflexible rules than under-
standing their needs. Understanding would lead to a looser
interpretation of regulations. They emphasized that agencies
should turn a blind eye to some rules to make it possible for
people to become active rather than be paralyzed by regula-
tions. This is necessary to give the precariat the opportunity to
get out of the downward spiral they believe they are in. It was
argued that the regulations and methods of enforcement pave
the way to the isolation of certain groups within the precariat.
There was, in general, a feeling that they (and their situation)
were not understood and could not make themselves under-
stood, which gave them the feeling of powerlessness and alien-
ation. One of the participants who expressed a feeling of lack of
understanding, frustration, powerlessness, and alienation
regarding the government (politicians and politics)10 said,
I intend to find a political party [because I'm not heard/
understood] . . . I could be a member of or vote for the party, but
it will do nothing for you now and it will do nothing for you in
the future [it will not listen to your needs when elected].
The respondents said that they need help from the govern-
ment to get out of socially and economically undesirable
situations. The need to solve the problems that cause the
undesirable situations is considered by the respondents to be
a necessary condition to leaving the precariat. One of the par-
ticipants who wanted to be clear that help is needed to solve
his social situation to be able to look for a paid job, which
would probably get him out of his precarious situation, said,
My wife is very sick and she is no longer going to get better.
Nobody is going to care for her . . . Nobody will take care of her
. . . I do everything that is needed. [That is the reason I'm not
looking for a paid job] . . . Yes, I have the feeling that I can do
everything I want, but sometimes I do not know what to do.
Sometimes I want to go away from home, because it is very hard
[to live in the situation I'm in].

The Need for a Higher and Stable Income
The participants stated that they need a higher income and
more tax benefits to make a "normal" living. The wages they
receive when performing paid work or the benefits they
receive from the state are considered insufficient to lead a
normal lifestyle. They also said that their wages are barely
sufficient to pay their fixed expenses (rent, gas, water, elec-
tricity, and health insurance). The need for a higher income
was driven by the desire to live without having to worry
about the basic necessities of life (e.g., food, clothes, and
rent) and to also be able to afford to do things (e.g., visit an
amusement park) during their leisure time, to have a finan-
cial buffer (to cover, for example, repairing home appliances
or the car), and to save for the future (e.g., nest egg and
retirement).
The respondents also needed a stable income. The income
of respondents who had paid jobs depended mainly on the
number of hours they worked. This caused fluctuations in
their incomes, which gave them a feeling of insecurity since
it is hard to plan a financial situation with a low and fluctuat-
ing income. They need stability to cope with daily expenses
and thereby reduce their financial worries. One of the partici-
pants who made an argument about the need for a higher and
more stable income to be able to stop worrying about his
financial situation, said,
The fixed income is important because we have a lot of expenses.
Everything is expensive. With two children we cannot, for
example, go to the Efteling [an amusement park] during the
school holidays. A fixed income is needed to be sure that we
have security, and that we do not have to worry about them
[expenses]. The amount we earn is never enough, but we have to
cover our fixed costs plus a bonus to be able to do something
during leisure time and [save] for the future.
The Need for Realistic Job Demands and Equally
Distributed Jobs
The participants also reported a need for more realistic job
demands. Employers demand more work experience and
qualifications than are actually needed to cope with the jobs
they offer, according to the participants. These high demands
reduce their likelihood of being hired since they have little to
no experience or a lower qualification. Younger participants
in particular said that they were not able to get jobs as they
lacked work experience and that if they were not given
access to jobs, they were not likely to gain any experience in
any one profession. This results in younger workers gaining
fragmented work experience, which in the long run is likely
to limit their labor market entry (see, for example, Standing,
1999). A participant who talked about job demands said,
Employers want someone who is 17 years old, with several
qualifications and a lot of work experience [not realistic]. A
decade ago this was not the case at all.
Besides realistic demands, the participants also said that
they needed jobs that are equally distributed geographically
(i.e., jobs that are not concentrated in one area) and that
match their capabilities and needs. They argued that jobs that
match their capabilities and needs are probably available
somewhere else in the Netherlands but not in the area in
which they live. Applying for jobs in the surrounding areas
involves costs (e.g., traveling expenses) and inconveniences
(e.g., traveling time). This, in combination with a low
income, seems to prevent them from applying for jobs out-
side the area they live in. A respondent said,
The problem is that there is not always work available in towns
people live in. [ . . . ]. The problem is that not all traveling
expenses are compensated. Some people have a lot of travel
expenses [high expense given the low income] that are not
compensated, so it is also not attractive [for people] to look for
work outside the home area [towns].
The Need for "Real" Jobs and Contracts
The participants stated their need for "real" labor contracts
and jobs. A real contract offers a fixed and sufficient number
of working hours to earn an adequate salary, according to the
respondents. Most of the respondents who received social
benefits said that they wanted a paid job but hesitated when
receiving an offer of a "nonreal" job. The local government
has several labor programs in which it offers jobs it considers
gateways to real jobs. Those who receive social benefits
must participate in those programs or have their benefits cut.
Sacrificing the security of social benefits for a temporary job
(e.g., a labor market reintegration job) causes insecurity and
stress, because reapplying for social benefits takes time and
effort. Temporary "paid" jobs are considered to be nonreal
jobs as they offer insufficient income (mostly equal to social
benefits) and insufficient career prospects and are, therefore,
not favored. It is, as one participant said, "work for nothing."
One of the participants said that the jobs they get or have to
perform are not "real jobs" in the sense that they only get a
small reward compared with the social benefits:
In accordance with the social benefits office, since we all receive
social benefits, we need to get started [attending the programme],
but we get very little money for it [to perform the job]. We work
for a packet of cigarettes. This means that we are not rewarded
for the work we do, so there is no motivation to do this work.
The Need for Equal Access
The participants need equal access to jobs with the same
amount of effort as those who are less likely to be discrimi-
nated. There was a general feeling among both younger and
older respondents, but especially among younger immi-
grants, of not having equal opportunities to get a job. They
face discrimination in the labor market when applying for
jobs. The feeling of unequal access and fewer opportunities
8 SAGE Open
seems to have discouraged most of the respondents from
applying over and over again. One of the participants who
described the frustration and the inequality said,
There are many companies who only hire Dutch people instead
of other people with a different background [such as immigrants].
If that changes, then we could find a job more easily.
The Need for Protection and Access to Good Jobs
A group of participants who worked in the cleaning industry
said that they felt exploited and needed more protection.
Their contracts, in their opinion, offer insufficient protection
against exploitation. They said that they face work stress due
to work tasks and the fear of having extra work hours cut.
Most of them had part-time contracts because the employer
had not offered them full-time contracts. This, in combina-
tion with a minimum wage, resulted in most participants,
especially those with only one household income, having
several jobs. This increased the stress and reduced their lei-
sure time (e.g., time lost during transitions). One of the par-
ticipants stated,
I work in the hospital [doing housekeeping]. It is a part-time job,
besides my cleaning job [also part-time]. People [who work for
the cleaning company] work in different locations and different
jobs; sometimes they work here [the cleaning job on this
location] for just two hours. We get a small contract [part-time
contract]. The employer spreads his risk. With these small
contracts we remain flexible [to the employer].
The respondents argued a need for access to good jobs.
Most of the precarious workers, especially the immigrants,
held or were offered jobs that can be considered bad jobs
(low income, low autonomy, hard work, low status).
According to the participants, higher quality jobs are jobs
that offer pleasure, pay overtime and sick days,11 compensate
for seasonal work, and enable a good work­life balance. One
of the participants, who saw how people in his immediate
vicinity struggled a bad work­life balance in a low-quality
job, said,
[ . . . ] work also contributes to your happiness in life. Some
people are working so hard because they work for a minimum
wage, they are almost completely wrecked. People return so
tired to their homes that they almost cannot do anything after
work. Some people are so proud that they don't receive benefits.
That keeps them going: working. The toll they pay is high,
because they wreck themselves. The work ethic of working hard
does not always make you happy. People who are at the bottom
suffer heavily.
Educational Needs
One of the needs the participants mentioned is the need for
education to develop themselves so that they can enter or
re-enter the labor market, increase their labor market
opportunities, increase their income, and improve their
career prospects. The participants said that they wanted to
learn new skills, as well as update their skills and have
them certified, for example, by getting a diploma or certifi-
cate for the work they have done (e.g., driving a forklift).
Most of the participants performed activities, such as vol-
untary work, that contributed, in their opinion, to their
development. They said that they believe that volunteer
work is necessary to build work experience and to learn the
new skills that employers are looking for. This is driven by
the need to build their resumes, as it is very important for
resumes to be updated and upgraded. However, most of the
participants, especially those belonging to minorities, face
difficulties getting an internship during their education.
Among the foreign participants, there was also a need for
free language education. They consider language lessons a
necessity to enable them to participate in the labor market to
get out of the precariat. Language lessons are free of charge
to those who receive social benefits but not to those who
have paid jobs, who, therefore, must pay for the training,
which is a burden because most of them work for the mini-
mum wage. One respondent said the following:
We need education. I'm obliged to take Dutch language lessons,
and that is fine, but I have to pay for the lessons myself. We need
free education. I actually work for almost nothing [and thus
cannot afford the lesson].
The need for free education concerns not only language
lessons. Because of rising education costs, the participants,
especially the women, were concerned about the education
of their children. They worried about the costs and the debts
their spouses have to take on to be able to study and find
more labor market opportunities. One of the participants said
the following:
In the near future, children [from the precariat] who want to
study will have a debt [to the government] of 50,000 euros after
their study. In the near future, studying will only be affordable
for the elite and no longer for people who just have a low
income.
Social and Psychological Needs
The participants without paid jobs reported a need for social
interaction. Most of them were looking for work because they
missed social interaction. Paid work, in one respondent's
opinion, gives them "work power" (strength from work), a
routine, a daily aim, access to social interaction, and sociabil-
ity. Some of the participants said that without work, they are
bored, feel purposeless, and idle. Those with paid jobs noted
that they needed a good work­life balance, as most of them
held contracts that did not offer such a balance.
In one of the groups, a participant stated that psycho-
logical help is needed by those who lose their jobs, espe-
cially those who have worked for several years. They said
Ballafkih et al. 9
that losing a job has serious psychological consequences
(see, for example, Gallo, Bradley, Siegel, & Kasl, 2000).
The safety net should provide those who lose their jobs
with new aims and new social relations. One participant
commented on how losing a job had psychological
consequences:
It is also so depressing for the people who have become
unemployed. Some people cannot handle the burden of
unemployment, especially if they have always worked. Slowly,
they become depressed. And some people do crazy things
[commit suicide]. Losing a job is depressing.
The Need for a Change in Discourse and
Representation
The change to a participation society has changed the dis-
course on citizens' reliance on the state. The discourse pro-
motes the idea that the precariat is sufficiently capable of
grasping opportunities that will lead to labor. The discourse
on the precariat's ability to fulfill its work- and labor-related
needs is based on false premises, according to the respon-
dents. They said that the government has unrealistic (too
much) faith in the abilities of the precariat to arrange its own
labor. The respondents said that a change in the discourse
will help to reframe the government's assumptions about the
self-reliance of the precariat: therefore a need for a change in
the self-reliance discourse.
Most of the participants also said that they need a positive
discourse on unemployment and the receipt of social bene-
fits. Their arguments revealed a feeling of inferiority that
was caused, in their opinion, by negative discourses. They
generally felt that they were being disparaged by society, by
the tone of politicians, and by the way they were treated. In
the main, and especially in the populist discourse, people
who receive social benefits are portrayed as potential cheats,
lazy citizens, and villains who take advantage of those who
have jobs. The precarious workers need the state and politi-
cians to change this discourse:
The government aims for full employment as the standard [by
promoting the participation in society and policy]; therefore
they [the authorities] are sending out a message that is related to
the work ethic. The ethic that you have to work otherwise you
are piteous, or don't count [as a fully-fledged citizen] [ . . . ] That
is the label that people [who don't have a job] get.
Along with the need for a change in the discourse, the
respondents also said that they need to be represented by the
government. Especially those who are not likely to find a
paid job have a higher need for government representation.
This involves taking action with regard to the labor market
by, for example, stimulating employers to hire people from
the precariat. The government, in their opinion, should repre-
sent the precariat in the labor market by arranging and pro-
tecting the precariat's interests.
Conclusion and Discussion
This exploratory research revealed a range of needs that are
related to labor. Several needs are associated with the desire
to have a sufficient and stable income to live an untroubled
life. The precariat needs an adequate salary from labor, full
employment according to one's means and needs, equal
access to jobs, equal distribution of jobs, and availability of
suitable jobs of acceptable quality. It also needs protection
against exploitation (e.g., unsociable hours, insufficient
hours to accomplish work tasks, and unpaid overtime) and
short-term "empty" contracts that do not offer any prospect
of a career, a higher income, or personal growth.
Most of the needs, including those regarding labor,
income, and education, are considered the responsibility of
the government. The emphasized needs contradict, to a cer-
tain extent, the shift the Dutch government is aiming for:
more individual responsibilities and fewer responsibilities
for the government. The needs of the precariat show that the
new roles and responsibilities are not clear to them; in addi-
tion, the government is blamed for not fulfilling several
needs. The precariat does not seem to consider that other
institutions, for example, trade unions (see also Park, 2016),
could help them to satisfy some of their needs (e.g., the need
for protection, access to jobs, and representation).
The needs of precarious workers show that they are not
able to create their own social and financial safety nets.
They do not seem to have the power to change their posi-
tion toward employers and the government, that is, to
change the new relationship. Their needs also show that the
precariat is mentally insecure, stressed, un- and over-
employed, alienated, and motivated by fear (see also, for
example, Standing, 2011). Their needs point toward a com-
plex role of the government: the role of facilitator and
mediator at both the individual and the collective levels.
The mismatch of expectations, the strict enforcement of
rules, and the shifting responsibilities seem to increase the
distrust and alienation of the precariat. This bolsters the
argument of Standing (1999) that the precariat distrusts the
government and is alienated from society.
The respondents emphasized several manifest needs,
although most of the needs are not directly related to labor.
The needs of the precariat and precarious workers are not the
same as the needs of people who do not belong to the pre-
cariat (see, for example, Jahoda, 1982). However, some of
the needs of the precariat show similarities with the latent
consequences of unemployment described by Jahoda (1982).
The needs of the precariat clearly indicate that they particu-
larly lack the social and psychological consequences that are
related to employment. These consequences are evident in
the needs for social and psychological help, a higher and
stable income, "real" jobs and contracts, protection, and
access to good jobs. The needs of the precariat are unique in
that they involve more than the social and psychological con-
sequences of unemployment described by Jahoda. The needs
10 SAGE Open
show the economic (e.g., sufficient income), political (e.g.,
trust in the government), and institutional (e.g., unrepre-
sented by nongovernmental institutions like the unions) con-
sequences of belonging to the precariat. These consequences
are clearly displayed in the need for change in the discourse,
transparency of the government, and the need for political
representation. Furthermore, the needs of the precariat are
imbued with attempts to find an untroubled way of living.
Most of the needs are related to escaping the poverty trap
rather than the unemployment trap.
The needs show that political measures to reduce the pre-
cariat as a social class must be tailored to the people in a
particular area (e.g., free language lessons in areas with a
high density of immigrants or more jobs in areas blighted by
structural unemployment). The needs also show that mea-
sures such as promoting self-employment, creating tempo-
rary, steppingstone, and work-reintegration jobs are likely to
be insufficient, because these measures solve only a marginal
part of the needs: these measures are mainly aimed at fulfill-
ing only one need. Furthermore, the social, psychological
and economic related needs of those in the precariat are not
likely to be solved with a one-size-fits-all policy.
Although employers are held accountable for some of the
needs, the precariat believes that the government should
force employers to change their employment policies through
labor market policies that are based on the needs of the pre-
cariat. The propagated "participatory society" with its labor
market flexibility and self-reliance could be improved by
incorporating social and economic aimed needs into policies.
This will improve the flexibility of the modern labor market.
By protecting (e.g., rights, including workplace rights based
on the needs) and empowering (e.g., through free education
to make them less vulnerable) them it is less likely that they
will be trapped in to precarity; they also will benefit from the
flexibility. The governments need to satisfy the needs of the
precariat by supporting and investing in the needs.
The Dutch flexicurity model, however, mainly concerns
the flexibility of labor and the prevention of unemployment.
Given the needs, it can be argued that the current model
accounts only marginally for the conditions and conse-
quences of flexicurity. A pluralistic risk management strat-
egy in which responsibilities for all labor market groups are
shared by government and social partners is needed to
improve the model, and thereby the conditions and conse-
quences for the precariat who need new forms of security
(see also Van Berkel & Van der Aa, 2015). In this strategy,
unions are the most obvious social partner to defend the
rights of the precariat in the broad sense (see also, for exam-
ple, Thornley, Jefferys, & Appay, 2010).
Despite the effort of unions to reduce precarious work, and
so precarity, the steady rise of such types of employment rela-
tions shows that the union have not succeeded in curbing the
trend (Keune, 2013) by mainly represent and defend mainly
the interests of their members. They are not reaching those in
insecure work, including those who need representation and
protection (e.g., Franks, 2016; Keune, 2015). They are still
locked into a more traditional model of supporting only the
organized workforce. Given needs such as protection (e.g., the
right to a sufficient living wage, degrading treatment, and pro-
tection against unemployment) and representation (e.g., sup-
port human and workplace rights despite the political discourse
and climate), the unions also have a role to play in the improve-
ment of workplace right. As argued by Keune (2015), they
also need to oppose the existing system, represent, and protect
the interest of a society at large, foremost the weaker groups
such as the precariat even if they are not a member of a union.
Limitations and Suggestions for Further Research
This exploratory research was conducted in an urban area.
The findings indicate that the needs of the precariat are
affected by the area they live in. To a certain extent, this lim-
its the findings of this research. Research in different areas
and in countries with higher and lower unemployment and
poverty rates and different local government approaches
could improve on the findings reported in this article.
The drawback to making the focus groups accessible and
free of obligations was that several participants turned up
late and/or left the meetings early. Using the findings of this
article as a starting point could improve our understanding of
their labor-related needs.

Notes
 1. To our knowledge, there are no general or European definitions
of precarious workers. There are, however, several definitions
of precarious workers that are based on empirical or norma-
tive standards. There are, for several reasons (Frade et al.,
2004), cross-national differences in the meaning of precarious
employment (Frade et al., 2004; Rodgers & Rodgers, 1989).
 2. The "working class" is a term that has dominated the socio-
logical debate on labor (see, for example, Wright, 2002). This
classification has become too ambiguous--if it has ever been
unambiguous--to describe labor-related classes nowadays.
The ambiguity can be attributed to the fading of categories in
which people are less likely to be attributed to one of the exist-
ing classes.
 3. An unbalanced labor contract is a contract in which the power
is not equally distributed; in the worst case, it is a destructive
contract.
 4. Unemployment is a state that many of the precarious workers
enter and leave during their working lives.

rights.

government, and governmental agencies. During the focus
groups, we mostly talked about the local government since
the respondents have to deal with several local government
agencies.
