Abstract
Introduction: Leptin has been suspected to contribute to the development of osteoarthritis (OA). However, this
hypothesis has not been tested in large-scale hand OA cohorts. Our study aimed to determine whether there is a
cross-sectional relationship between serum leptin levels and hand OA in a population-based sample of US adults.
Method: We used the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), a national cross-
sectional population-based survey, to study the relationship between hand OA and serum leptin concentration. We
applied previously established classification criteria for hand OA. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis were excluded.
Potential confounders included sex, body mass index, the presence of polyarticular OA, diabetes, and total
cholesterol. We estimated unadjusted mean leptin concentration by hand OA status and by all confounders. We
further developed a linear regression model to assess mean leptin levels, adjusted for appropriate confounders.
Results: Of 2,477 subjects in the NHANES III sample that had a hand examination and did not have rheumatoid
arthritis, 1,056 (42.6%) had a leptin measurement and were included in the analysis. Subjects with and without
leptin measurement had similar demographic characteristics. We did not find any significant differences in mean
serum leptin levels in subjects with symptomatic hand OA (7.38 ng/ml in males (95% confidence interval (CI) =
5.31, 9.46) and 21.55 ng/ml in females (95% CI = 17.08, 26.02)), asymptomatic hand OA (6.69 ng/ml in males (95%
CI = 5.19, 8.18) and 17.09 ng/ml in females (95% CI = 15.00, 19.18)), and no hand OA (8.22 ng/ml in males (95% CI
= 7.47, 8.97) and 20.77 ng/ml in females (95% CI = 18.01, 23.53)) in the unadjusted analysis. In a multivariable linear
regression model that included variables of hand OA status, age, race/ethnicity, and obesity status, we found no
statistically significant association between serum leptin and hand OA status.
Conclusions: In this cross-sectional study of a large representative US cohort, we did not find any evidence to
support the hypothesis that serum leptin is associated with hand OA.
Introduction
Hand osteoarthritis (OA) is a common joint disease
worldwide, resulting in weakened grip strength and sig-
nificant functional disability [1]. As nonweight-bearing
joints, the hand is a useful target for the study of non-
mechanical risk factors for OA pathogenesis [2-10].
Obesity has been observed to have associations with
OA development in nonweight-bearing joints as well as
in weight-bearing joints [11-14]. Adipokine hormones
such as leptin have long been thought to contribute to
OA pathogenesis directly, independent of the mechani-
cal effect of obesity [3,4,11,15]. Leptin, a small polypep-
tide, is predominantly produced in white adipose tissue
and regulates food intake and energy expenditure. Lep-
tin has also been increasingly recognized to play a role
in inflammation, angiogenesis, as well as cartilage and

bone metabolism, and thus has been implicated in the
development of osteoarthritis [3,15-18].
Studies have suggested a possible relationship between
leptin and OA of weight-bearing joints [15,16]. How-
ever, there have been few studies of nonweight-bearing
joints - such as the hand joints - to examine nonmecha-
nical risk factors for OA. Leptin was not associated with
hand OA progression in a recent study of fewer than
300 subjects [19]. To date, no study has examined the
cross-sectional association between leptin and hand OA
in a population-based sample. The objective of our
study was to determine whether a cross-sectional rela-
tionship exists between leptin and OA in a US popula-
tion-based sample of adults at least 60 years of age.
Materials and methods
Study sample
We used data from the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), a national
cross-sectional population-based survey conducted from
1988 to 1994 to assess the health and nutrition of the
non-institutionalized US population. Survey data, which
include demographics, health status, health disorders,
and behaviors among others, were collected by house-
hold interviews. Physical examinations and blood draws
were also performed by physicians at mobile examina-
tion centers. For this analysis we used data from the
demographic file [20], the examination file [21], and the
serum leptin file [22]. Our analysis was restricted to
subjects surveyed from 1991 to 1994 and age 60 years
or older because NHANES III conducted the hand
examination only on these subjects.
NHANES III subjects were randomly assigned to be
tested for leptin [22]. Subjects with rheumatoid arthritis
were excluded from the analysis, based on clinical infor-
mation collected at the physician interview, examination
and criteria used by Dillon, Rasch and colleagues
[23,24]. Institutional Review Board approval was not
necessary because the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey is a publically available database.
Data elements
Assessment of hand osteoarthritis
We applied a previously developed algorithm for defin-
ing hand OA in the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey. Dillon and colleagues developed a
definition of hand OA in the National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey database that is modeled on
the American College of Rheumatology definition [23].
The American College of Rheumatology criteria and the
NHANES III definition differ slightly, as shown in Table
1[23]. We defined asymptomatic hand OA as cases ful-
filling criteria 2 to 4 but not criterion 1. In the group
without hand OA, subjects did not have symptoms or
physical examination evidence of hand OA. Hand radio-
graphs were not released from NHANES III for analysis.
Leptin
Human studies have shown that leptin levels probably
peak between 12 midnight and 2:30 am, and are lowest
between noon and early afternoon [25]. In NHANES III,
leptin was measured in the morning after an 8-hour
overnight fast. Leptin has been shown to remain stable
when stored frozen for many years [26-29]. The labora-
tory analysis for serum leptin was performed by Linco
Research, Inc. (St. Louis, MO, USA) using a radioimmu-
noassay with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against highly
purified recombinant human leptin. Detectable concen-
trations of the assay range from 0.5 to 100 fg/l. Within-
assay and between-assay reliability coefficients of varia-
tions range from 3.4 to 8.3% for radioimmunoassay and
from 3.6 to 6.2% for western blot [22].
Potential confounders
We hypothesized that age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass
index (BMI), the presence of polyarticular OA, diabetes,
and total cholesterol may confound the relationship
between leptin and hand OA. We thus accounted for

these variables in the analysis. Age was classified into
three groups; 60 to 69 years, 70 to 79 years, and 80+
years. We classified a subject's race/ethnicity as non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, or other.
We classified BMI as normal (< 25 kg/m2), overweight
(25 to 29.99 kg/m2), and obese ( 30 kg/m2). Polyarticu-
lar OA was defined as the presence of radiographic knee
OA with a Kellgren-Lawrence grade  2 in at least one
knee in addition to having either symptomatic hand OA
or asymptomatic hand OA. Total cholesterol was classi-
fied as desirable (< 200), borderline high (200 to 239),
and high ( 240).
Statistical analysis
To ensure that the sample of subjects with a leptin
measurement did not differ from the sample of sub-
jects without a leptin measurement, we compared
potential confounders for those with a leptin measure-
ment and for those without a leptin measurement. The
remaining analyses were performed on those with a
hand examination and a leptin measurement. We cal-
culated percentages by hand OA status for all potential
confounders. We estimated unadjusted mean leptin
levels by hand OA status and the other potential con-
founders stratified by sex. We stratified analyses of lep-
tin by sex because the mean and variance of serum
leptin concentration was much greater among females
than in males. We further applied linear regression to
estimate the adjusted mean leptin by hand OA status
stratified by sex. To fit the most parsimonious model,
we only included potential confounders in the final
model if they reached statistical significance at an
alpha level of 0.05. We used SAS statistical software
(version 9.2; SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina,
U.S.A.) to perform all analyses. To account for the
complex multistage survey design and to obtain esti-
mates representative of the non-institutionalized US
population, we used survey procedures within SAS and
weighted the analyses using the appropriate survey
sampling weight.
Results
Of the 2,589 subjects who had interviews and hand
examinations, examination data were complete in 2,498.
Nineteen patients with rheumatoid arthritis were
excluded. Of 2,477 subjects that were eligible for the
analysis, 1,056 (42.6%) had a serum leptin measurement
and comprised our sample. Subjects with leptin mea-
surements and those who did not have leptin measure-
ments were similar with respect to demographic factors
(age, sex, race, BMI) (see Additional file 1). Among
those in our final sample, hand OA was symptomatic in
90 patients (8.5%), asymptomatic in 376 patients
(35.6%), and not present in 590 patients (55.9%).
The mean age of the final sample was 70.3 ± 8.2 years
and the mean BMI of the final sample was 26.4 ± 4.9
kg/m2. Subjects with hand OA (both symptomatic and
asymptomatic) were more likely to be female than those
without hand OA. Subjects with symptomatic hand OA
were more likely to be overweight (45%) and obese
(25%) than those with asymptomatic hand OA (39%
overweight and 16% obese). Detailed data on the demo-
graphic and clinical characteristics of our sample strati-
fied by hand OA status are shown in Table 2.
Unadjusted mean leptin levels stratified by sex and all
potential confounders are shown in Table 3. Among
males, the unadjusted mean leptin level did not vary
substantially by hand OA status. Those with no hand
OA had a mean leptin of 8.22 (95% confidence interval
(CI) = 7.47, 8.97) compared with 7.38 (95% CI = 5.31,
9.46) for those with symptomatic hand OA and 6.69
(95% CI = 5.19, 8.18) for those with asymptomatic hand
OA. Among females, the unadjusted mean leptin did
vary slightly by hand OA status, with those with asymp-
tomatic hand OA having the lowest mean leptin at
17.09 (95% CI = 15.00, 19.18). However, all of the 95%
CIs overlapped. The mean leptin for females with symp-
tomatic hand OA was 21.55 (95% CI = 17.08, 26.02) and
for no hand OA was 20.77 (95% CI = 18.01, 23.53).
Mean leptin levels increased as BMI increased for both
males and females.
Results of the linear regression showed similar find-
ings to the unadjusted analysis. The final model
included hand OA status, age, and obesity status. Race/
ethnicity, diabetes, polyarticular OA, and total choles-
terol were not included in the final model. Among
males, the adjusted mean leptin for those with sympto-
matic hand OA was 8.88 (95% CI = 7.08, 10.67) com-
pared with 8.21 (95% CI = 6.62, 9.80) for those with
asymptomatic hand OA and 9.40 (95% CI = 8.59, 10.21)
for those with no hand OA. Similarly, among females,
the adjusted mean leptin for those with symptomatic
hand OA was 21.89 (95% CI = 18.70, 25.07) compared
with 20.13 (95% CI = 18.32, 21.95) for those with
asymptomatic hand OA and 23.09 (95% CI = 21.83,
24.34) for those with no hand OA (Table 4). None of
these differences in adjusted mean leptin levels was sta-
tistically significant (all P > 0.05).
Discussion
The present study used data from NHANES III to
describe the cross-sectional relationship between leptin
and hand OA. The study did not provide evidence to
support the hypothesis that hand OA is associated with
increased serum leptin level. Stratified and multivariable
analyses did not show evidence of a difference in leptin
levels in the symptomatic hand OA, asymptomatic hand
OA, and no hand OA groups. The multivariable

analyses adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, BMI status, and
the presence of polyarticular OA as indicated by radio-
graphic knee OA, diabetes status, and serum cholesterol.
Our analyses have several important strengths.
NHANES III has a large sample size, making it unlikely
that we simply missed an effect due to chance. Also,
selection bias is unlikely because the NHANES III sam-
ple was representative of the US population. Lastly,
since we accounted for the complex sample design and
used the sampling weights, the estimates are representa-
tive of the US population [22].
The study also has limitations. A possible explanation
for our null result is that the association between hand
OA and leptin is complex and cannot be assessed using
a cross-sectional sample. Leptin may be associated with
hand OA at one time point of its development only.
However, in the longitudinal study carried out by Yusuf
and colleagues, serum leptin was not found to be asso-
ciated with hand OA progression in 6-year follow-up of
248 participants [19]. The paper by Yusuf and colleagues
used a longitudinal design with a radiographic case defi-
nition [19]. In the present cross-sectional study, we
measured hand OA by an algorithm that incorporates
symptoms and physical examination. These two
approaches are complementary, and neither supports an
association between serum leptin and hand OA.
Another explanation for the null result is the possible
misclassification of hand OA in NHANES III. There is
no gold standard for the diagnosis of hand OA. Our use
of the classification criteria suggested by Dillon and col-
leagues could have resulted in misclassification. Many
patients with early or developing OA start with pain,
followed by delayed onset of bony enlargement for
months or years. Using our criteria, these subjects
would be categorized as having no OA. Misclassification
of this sort would tend to bias associations toward the
null and could indeed play a role in our negative
findings.
As expected, our results confirmed that leptin is asso-
ciated with gender and BMI status, consistent with prior
animal and human studies [30-33]. These findings pro-
vide face validity for the leptin measurements. Our
study is the largest population-based confirmation of
such a relationship in humans, with prior studies in the

Conclusions
We did not find a cross-sectional association between
hand OA and serum leptin in our sample. Prospective
studies are needed to further evaluate the possibility
that elevated leptin levels predate the onset or progres-
sion of clinically apparent hand OA.
