Article
There is a long history of research on the heritability of
social behavior (e.g., Loehlin, 1992; Riemann, Angleitner,
& Strelau, 1997). Advances in molecular biology have
enabled a much more informed study of the impact of spe-
cific genes on social behavior. Limited research, however,
has attempted to link specific genes to psychological pro-
cesses involved in social cognition, and none of this research
has examined the role of specific genes in facial age dis-
crimination. The current research examines the relationship
between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within
two genes associated with social behavior and cognition,
that is, rs53576 located in the oxytocin receptor gene (here-
after OXTR) and rs3796863 located in the cluster of differ-
entiation 38 gene (hereafter CD38), and the ability of young
adults to discriminate facial aging in sets of faces ranging
from 1 to 22 years of age.
Oxytocin, OXTR, and CD38
Oxytocin is a neurohypophysial hormone and nonapeptide
neurotransmitterproducedinthehypothalamus.Oxytocinergic
physiology is associated with a range of social behavior, affili-
ation, and bonding (e.g.,Bakermans-Kranenburg & van
Ijzendoorn, 2008; Feldman, 2012; Meyer-Lindenberg, Domes,
Kirsch, & Heinrichs, 2011; Parker et al., 2014).
The OXTR gene encodes a G protein-coupled receptor to
which oxytocin binds (Gimpl & Fahrenholz, 2001).
Specifically, the OXTR SNP rs53576, located within intron 3
of OXTR, is associated with sensitivity to social stimuli and
social behavior. Young adults with the OXTR GG genotype
tend to be more responsive to infant cries (Riem, Pieper, Out,
Bakermans-Kranenburg, & van Ijzendoorn, 2010), exhibit
more maternal sensitivity to toddlers (Bakermans-Kranenburg
& van Ijzendoorn, 2008), and show greater interest in infant
faces (Marsh et al., 2012) than those with theAAorAG geno-
types. They are also better able to infer emotional states from
the eyes (Rodrigues, Saslow, Garcia, John, & Keltner, 2009)
and are more sociable (Tost et al., 2010).
Whereas the OXTR gene encodes the receptor to which
oxytocin binds, the enzyme encoded by the CD38 gene--
ADP-ribosyl cyclase--facilitates the secretion of oxytocin
via the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores (Jin et al.,
2007; Lerer et al., 2010). Little research has been conducted
on the social cognitive correlates of CD38 expression. Mice

Perception of Facial Aging and Its
Relationship to Two Single Nucleotide
Polymorphisms (OXTR rs53576, CD38
rs3796863)
Thomas J. Gross1, Thomas F. Gross1, and Susan Blauth1
Abstract
Oxytocin is associated with social behavior. In humans, several studies have assessed the relationship between social
behavior and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)--rs53576--within the gene encoding the oxytocin receptor (OXTR).
Fewer studies have assessed the relationship between human sociability and the SNP rs3796863 found within the cluster
of differentiation 38 (CD38) gene, whose product has been found to facilitate the secretion of oxytocin. This research
examines whether these polymorphisms are associated with facial age discrimination. Young adults (N = 43) were genotyped
at both the OXTR and CD38 loci. They discriminated aging in 1- to 4-, 5- to 8-, 9- to 12-, 13- to 17-, and 18- to 22-year-old
male and female faces. Participants with the OXTR GG and the CD38 CC genotypes discriminated facial aging better than
those possessing at least one A allele at either locus. These polymorphisms appear to be associated with social information
processing involved in facial age discrimination.

without functional copies of the CD38 gene show poor
maternal nurturing and social amnesia (Higashida et al.,
2011; Jin et al., 2007). Among individuals exhibiting autism
spectrum behavior, the C allele of the human CD38 SNP
rs3796863 has been found to be overrepresented statistically
(Munsue et al., 2010). In addition, this allele has been associ-
ated with reduced CD38 messenger RNA (mRNA) expres-
sioninculturedlymphoblastoidcellsderivedfromindividuals
with Autistic Spectrum Disorder and their unaffected parents
(Lerer et al., 2010). Young adults who possess the rs3796863
CC genotype also tend to respond slower to social stimuli
and are less inclined to touch infants than those with the AC
or AA genotypes (Feldman et al., 2012; Sauer, Montag,
Wörner, Kirsch, & Reuter, 2012).
Facial Aging and Age Perception
Distinct changes occur in faces between infancy and early
adulthood that give them a more mature appearance (Berry
& Zebrowitz-McArthur, 1988). With age, the face elongates
and becomes less rounded. There is a decrease in the size of
the forehead and eyes relative to the face and an increase in
the relative size and angularity of the chin. The placement of
the eyes moves above the face's midline, the nose becomes
more pronounced and elongated, and skin becomes coarser
and more varied in color.
Ecological theorists (e.g., McArthur & Baron, 1983;
Zebrowitz & Montepare, 2006, 2008) argue that our response
to these facial features has a biological basis and is rooted in
our evolutionary past. How others perceive and respond to
these features is associated with a number of social conse-
quences. Youthful faces are perceived as cuter and evoke
more physical attraction than older faces (Alley, 1988; Gross,
1997; Karraker & Stern, 1990; Stephan & Langlois, 1984).
Immature faces are also perceived as more helpless and
dependent than mature faces (Berry & Zebrowitz-McArthur,
1988; Friedman & Zebrowitz, 1992; Gross, 1997). From an
evolutionary and ecological perspective (e.g., Eibl-
Eibesfeldt, 1989; Mark, Shaw, & Pittenger, 1988; McArthur
& Baron, 1983; Zebrowitz & Montepare, 2006, 2008), it is
presumed that our response to faces is adaptive and stems
from social selective pressures encountered in the course of
human evolution. We ensure the survival of our young by
having a genome that has been fine-tuned to bring about per-
ceptual skills allowing us to recognize immature faces as
young and in need of succor, nurturance, and protection
(Schaschl et al., 2015; Vargas-Pinilla et al., 2015).
Evidence of a biological basis for age perception and
associating mental and physical states with facial age comes
from several sources. Perception of immaturity in faces
occurs very early in life. By 4 months of age, children are
sensitive to the facial features associated with aging (Kramer,
Zebrowitz, San Giovanni, & Sherak, 1995; McCall &
Kennedy, 1980; Montepare, Zebrowitz-McArthur, 1989).
The perception of youthfulness in young faces and its
association with dependence is also found across cultures
(e.g., Zebrowitz, Montepare, & Lee, 1993). Furthermore,
particular groups of individuals are deficient in their ability
to perceive facial aging. Gross (2002) noted that, compared
with neuro-typical children, those with autism had difficulty
discriminating aging in nonhuman faces.
Overview and Hypotheses
The accurate perception of facial age is important to social
interaction and, perhaps, even survival. Little research, how-
ever, has examined factors associated with sensitivity to facial
aging. Given genetic influence on social behavior (Knafo &
Plomin, 2006), it is reasonable to assume that the physiology
associated with specific genes might influence the more explic-
itly defined social cognitive processes associated with facial
age perception. To date, no one has examined a genetic basis
for sensitivity to facial aging and facial age discrimination.
In the current study, young adults participated in a task of
social cognition that required the detection of aging in sets of
faces. In addition to completing the age discrimination task,
participants provided buccal cell samples that were subse-
quently genotyped at the OXTR rs53576 and CD38 rs3796863
loci. Both OXTR and CD38 loci have been associated with
oxytocinergic signaling and social functioning. Based on past
research, it was hypothesized that participants with the GG
genotype of OXTR or the AA/AC genotype of CD38 would
perform better on the age discrimination task than partici-
pants possessing the OXTR GA/AA or CD38 CC genotypes.
Given the ecological importance of detecting aging in very
young faces and a presumed biological disposition for doing
so, it was predicted that individuals possessing the GG geno-
type of OXTR or the AA/AC genotype of CD38 would more
accurately identify aging in younger rather than older faces
compared with participants with alternative genotypes.
Method
Participants
Prior to beginning this study and based on similar studies
(Marsh et al., 2012; Sauer et al., 2012), we anticipated the
need to recruit between 40 and 45 participants. Our sample
consisted of nine male (two Asian-, two Hispanic-, five
Caucasian Americans; M = 20.7 years, SD = 1.82) and 34
female (one Asian-, two African-, seven Hispanic-, 24
Caucasian Americans; M = 20.8 years, SD = 1.41) young
adults. The distribution of participant genotypes at the OXTR
and CD38 loci is shown in Table 1. Based on the convention
of prior studies (e.g., Marsh et al., 2012; Sauer et al., 2012),
data from participants with the OXTR GA/AA and CD38
CA/AA genotypes were combined for analyses.
Neither OXTR nor CD38 allele frequencies deviated from
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium--chi-square goodness of fit:
2(1)
OXTR
= 0.69, p = .41; 2(1)
CD38
= 0.03, p = .87. With
Gross et al. 3
respect to the two genotyped loci, alleles segregated inde-
pendently within the sampled population--chi-square test of
independence: 2(1) = 0.72, p = .40. Participants were treated
in accordance with ethical standards established by the
American Psychological Association and received $10.00
for their participation.
Facial Age Perception Task
Participants were asked to respond to 10 facial age sets. Half
of the face sets consisted of male and half of female faces.
For both male and female faces, one set consisted of faces
that were aged from 1 to 4, 5 to 8, 9 to 12, 13 to 17, and 18 to
22 years.
To construct each set, full face, color photographs were
obtained of the same four individuals as they appeared at a
younger (e.g., 5 years old) and older (e.g., 8 years old) age.
Faces had no adornment, a pleasant expression, and closed
mouths. Photographs of the four younger and four older faces
were morphed into composite prototypical images of the
younger and older face. These younger and older prototypical
faces were then morphed across 28 steps to create the 10 sets
of 29 faces that, within each set, gradually changed from the
youngest to the oldest face. Photographs were framed in oval
masks to eliminate hair and clothing (Figure 1). This proce-
dure for studying facial aging was adapted from previous
methodology used to assess discrimination of social proper-
ties of the face (e.g., ethnicity, gender; for example, Corneille,
Huart, Becquart, & Brédart, 2004; Ng, Ciaramitaro, Anstis,
Boynton, & Fine, 2006).1
Participants were assessed individually. Using a computer
program developed in PsyScope (Cohen, MacWhinney,
Flatt, & Provost, 1993), participants were shown, one set at a
time, 10 sets of 29 faces. Stimuli were presented on a com-
puter console. At the start of each trial, faces were randomly
placed into an array of 29, 4.5 × 5 cm windows. Participants
were directed to examine the faces in the array and to mouse-
click on the face that appeared the youngest. After clicking
on a face, the face was removed from the array and the par-
ticipant was instructed to, again, select the youngest appear-
ing face from the remaining 28. Participants continued in this
fashion until all 29 faces in the set had been selected. The
computer program recorded the order in which faces were
selected and the amount of time that it took participants to
make their selections. Upon completing one set, another set
of faces was presented on screen. Male and female face sets
alternated between trials. The age of the face sets varied ran-
domly across presentations. Each participant responded to
each of the 10 face sets.
Genotyping
Immediately preceding or following the administration of
the facial age discrimination task, participants rinsed their
mouths thoroughly with 40 mL of bottled water. They then
vigorously swished 10 mL of a .9% (m/v) saline solution
about the mouth for 30 s before depositing it into a conical
tube that was placed immediately on ice.
DNA was isolated from 200 µL of resuspended buccal
cells obtained following an initial pelleting of 1 mL of the 10
mL saline rinse obtained from participants. DNA isolation
was conducted using a QIAamp DNABlood Mini kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA) within 2 hr of sample collection for all partici-
pants. Genotypic calls were generated using TaqMan SNP
Genotyping Assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA)
specific to each locus, either OXTR (C__3290335) or CD38
(C__1216944_10). Genotypic assignments for each partici-
pant were verified in duplicate at both loci. Reactions were
conducted using a Type-it Fast Probe PCR Kit (Qiagen) in a
Bio-Rad C1000 thermal cycler equipped with a CFX96 opti-
cal reaction module (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Individual
PCR reactions contained 1x Type-it Fast SNP Probe PCR
Master Mix, 1x TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay, approxi-
mately20ngofparticipantgenomicDNA,and.5xQ-Solution.
Each reaction was conducted in a total volume of 25 µL.
Thermal cycling conditions consisted of an initial step of 5
min at 95°C followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C, then 30 s
at 60°C. Fluorometric readings for each reaction were
acquired after every cycle. Genotypes were assigned using
the CFX Manager software (Bio-Rad).
Quantification of Salivary 17-Estradiol
Several previous studies examining individual differences
within the OXTR and CD38 genes have attempted to control
for inter-subject variability in female sex hormone levels
(Marsh et al., 2012; Sauer et al., 2012). Because some research
(e.g., Mareckova et al., 2014; Miyahara, Morita, Yamaguchi,
Nonaka, & Maeda, 2000) has found that estradiol concentra-
tion in females may influence sensitivity to faces and it was
anticipated that many participants in our sample would be
female, salivary estradiol concentration (pg/mL) was assessed
for each participant and used as a covariate in our analyses.
Participants provided approximately 2 mL of saliva by way of
passive drool immediately prior or subsequent to their com-
pletion of the facial age discrimination task. Saliva collection
and sample storage were in accordance with methods detailed
by Salimetrics. Samples were assayed at the Arizona State
University Institute for Interdisciplinary Salivary Bioscience

Results
Age Discrimination Accuracy
Age discrimination scores were Spearman rank order corre-
lation coefficients reflecting the degree of correspondence
between the actual ranking (youngest to oldest) and the par-
ticipant's rankings for each facial age set. Initial analyses of
these data failed to find significant effects or interactions
involving participant gender, so participant gender was
excluded from further analyses.
A 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 ANOVA with two between-subjects fac-
tors (OXTR genotype: GG or AG/AA; and, CD38 geno-
type: CC or AC/AA) and two within-subject factors (face
gender: male or female; and, face age: 1-4, 5-8, 9-12,
13-17, 18-22 years of age) was conducted on age discrimi-
nation scores. Including estradiol concentration as a
covariate had no appreciable effect on outcomes. The
results reported are for analyses without estradiol as a
covariate. The F-statistics for the analyses with estradiol
as a covariate are indicated in brackets. The least signifi-
cant difference (LSD) test was used in post hoc analyses
of mean differences.
Analyses revealed significant main effects for OXTR geno-
type, F(1, 39) = 5.37 [6.02], MSE = .22, p = .03, p
2 = .17, and
CD38 genotype, F(1, 39) = 7.76 [7.95], MSE = .22, p = .008,
p
2 = .17. A significant main effect was found for face gender,
F(1, 39) = 38.91 [37.91], MSE = .12, p < .001, p
2 = .49, and
face age, F(4, 156) = 14.5 [14.5], MSE = .1, p < .001, p
2 = .27.
A significant interaction was also obtained between face gen-
der and face age, F(4, 156) = 10.2 [10.2], MSE = .1, p < .001,
p
2 = .21.
Participants with the OXTR GG genotype demonstrated sig-
nificantly better facial age discrimination (M = .73, SD = .16)
than participants with the AA or AG genotype (M = .62, SD =
.16). Participants with the CD38 CC genotype performed better
(M = .74, SD = .14) on the face discrimination task than partici-
pants with either the AC or AA genotypes (M = .61, SD = .17).
Male faces were discriminated better (M = .79, SD = .14) than
female faces (M = .57, SD = .24). For female faces, the 1- to
4-year-old faces were discriminated better than the 5- to 8-year-
old faces which were discriminated better than the older faces.
The age of male faces did not significantly influence facial age
discrimination (Figure 2).
Response Time
In addition to the accuracy with which participants identi-
fied aging in stimulus sets, the amount of time participants'
spent discriminating aging in each of the facial age sets was
recorded by the PsyScope program with millisecond resolu-
tion. There was a significant relationship between partici-
pants' overall age discrimination accuracy (the sum of the
10 age discrimination scores) and the overall amount of

the lower right hand corner) over 28 steps into a 4-year-old male face.

time participants took to make judgments about facial age,
r(41) = .41, p = .006. Participants who performed better on
the age discrimination task took more time discriminating
aging in facial age sets.
As with the accuracy analysis, response time data expressed
in minutes to set completion were subjected to 2 × 2 × 2 × 5
ANOVA with two between-group factors (OXTR genotype:
GG or AG/AA; and CD38 genotype: CC or AC/AA) and two
within-subject factors (face gender: male or female; and face
age: 1-4, 5-8, 9-12, 13-17, 18-22 years).Again, F-statistics with
estradiol as a covariate are included in brackets and LSD tests
were used in post hoc analyses of mean differences. A signifi-
cant main effect was obtained for face gender, F(1, 39) = 7.36
[7.2], MSE = .36, p = .01, p
2 = .16. A marginal effect was
obtained for face age, F(4, 156) = 2.4 [2.45], MSE = .68,
p = .052, p
2 = .06. Participants spent more time discriminating
aging in female faces (M = 2.46, SD = 1.15) than in male faces
(M = 2.29, SD = 1.08). Participants spent less time discriminat-
ing aging in the 1- to 4-year-old faces (M = 2.23, SD = 1.04) and
5- to 8-year-old faces (M = 2.26, SD = 1.18) compared with the
9- to 12-year-old faces (M = 2.58, SD = 1.31).
Marginal interactions were found between OXTR and
CD38, F(1, 39) = 3.52 [3.2], MSE = 11.83, p = .06, p
2 = .08
(Table 2), and between CD38 and face age, F(4, 156) = 2.2
[2.2], MSE = .68, p = .07, p
2 = .05 (Figure 3). Participants
possessing both OXTR AG/AA and CD38 AC/AA genotypes
tended to take less time discriminating facial aging than did
participants with either genotype in isolation. Participants with
the CD38 CC genotype spent more time discriminating aging
in the 9- to 12-year-old faces (M = 2.8, SD = 1.48) relative to
those with the AC/AA genotype (M = 2.35, SD = 1.12). Those
with the CC genotype also took more time to discriminate 1- to
4- (M = 2.28, SD = 1.26) and 5- to 8- (M = 2.11, SD = 1.19)
year-old faces relative to the 9- to 12- (M = 2,8, SD = 1.48)
year-old faces and more time to discriminate 13- to 17-year-old
faces (M = 2.52, SD = 1.51) relative to 5- to 8-year-old faces. In
contrast, those with the AC/AA genotype did not statistically
differ in the amount of time they spent discriminating faces
from different age groups.
Discussion
As anticipated, SNPs within the OXTR and CD38 genes
were significantly associated with young adults' perfor-
mance on the facial age discrimination task. These relation-
ships were found for both accuracy and response rate. The
response rate and accuracy measures identified the same
alleles (i.e., OXTRA, CD38A) as conferring relative impair-
ment on the facial age discrimination task. Although this
assignment of allele risk is internally consistent, it is at odds
with most literature regarding the CD38 locus (Feldman
et al., 2012; Lerer et al., 2010; Sauer et al., 2012).
Participants found some facial age sets to be more difficult to
discriminate than others. Notably, they were less accurate when
discriminating aging in older female faces. Presumably due to
increased task difficulty, participants took more time making
judgments about female faces and 9- to 12-year-old faces (i.e.,
faces that, with 18- to 22-year-old faces, were least accurately

discriminated) relative to 1- to 4- and 5- to 8-year-old faces. The
increased challenge of discriminating female faces, and older
ones in particular, may reflect the earlier maturation of female
relative to male faces (e.g., Ferrario, Sforza, Poggio, & Schmitz,
1998; Mellion, Behrents, & Johnston, 2013). Older female faces
may have appeared more similar with respect to age-differenti-
ating features. In addition, mathematically averaged faces are
perceived as more attractive than individual images used to gen-
erate them (Rhodes, Sumich, & Byatt, 1999; Valentine, Darling,
& Donnelly, 2004). Because attractive female faces tend to
retain youthful features (Cunningham, 1986), it is possible that
the female face stimuli reflected an atypically low rate of aging
that decreased discrimination accuracy.
Young children's faces are perceived as helpless and
dependent (Berry & Zebrowitz-McArthur, 1988; Gross,
1997). Assuming that sensitivity to youthful features is, in
part, based in our biology and has adaptive social conse-
quences, it was anticipated that individuals having genotypes
favoring sociability would perform better when discriminat-
ing younger rather than older faces.
Although both OXTR GG and CD38 CC genotypes
were significantly associated with better discrimination
accuracy, contrary to what was anticipated, there was no
Genotype × Facial Age interaction. This suggests that
individuals with the OXTR GG and CD38 CC genotypes
possess more generalizable (rather than age-specific)
information-processing skills (e.g., scan rates, perceptual
disembedding, memory) or specific social information-
processing skills (e.g., increased sensitivity to facial fea-
tures and/or configurations) (Richler, Cheung, & Gauthier,
2011) that sensitize them to facial aging across a wide
range of ages rather than only to younger faces and those
typically in greatest need of care.
An interaction between OXTR and CD38 on the rate of
responding was observed in two trending interactions.
Participants possessing both OXTR GA/AA and CD38 CA/
AAgenotypes (i.e., at least one risk allele at both loci) tended
to complete the facial age discrimination task more rapidly
than those possessing either genotype in isolation. In addi-
tion, a CD38 × Facial Age interaction was detected, in which
CD38 CC participants spent more time discriminating 9- to
12-year-old faces (the more difficult facial age discrimina-
tion) compared with those with the CA/AA genotype at this
locus, whose rate of responding did not significantly differ
across any of the facial age groups.
These findings are in accordance with those noted by
Sauer et al. (2012), who observed CD38 CA/AA participants
responding more rapidly than those of CC genotype on an
extended version of the Hariri Emotional Face Task (Hariri,
Tessitore, Mattay, Fera, & Weinberger, 2002). As this para-
digm involves a simple one target, two probe match to sam-
ple, it is understandable that the authors were unable to find
significant effects for CD38 genotype on response accuracy,
an outcome they themselves attributed to a strong ceiling
effect. Notably, no ceiling effect was found in the present
study, for which distinct main effects of the CD38 genotype
upon facial recognition accuracy were observed.
In contrast to the Sauer et al. (2012) finding, the present
research suggests a beneficial role for the CD38 CC geno-
type, potentially by way of its impact upon participants' rate
of responding. Although Sauer et al. suggest that longer
response latency to social stimuli is indicative of relative
impairment on a face recognition task, the present study
found no such relationship. In fact, a significant, moderate
correlation was noted between rate of responding and
response accuracy. Those who took more time to make facial
age judgments discriminated facial aging better.
Although it remains to be substantiated by further
research, it is possible that those possessing risk alleles, as
assigned within the context of this study, failed to recognize
and compensate for the relative ambiguity of facial age in
certain stimulus sets. This interpretation is particularly com-
pelling when considering trends evident in participants' age
discrimination accuracy when these data are collapsed across
stimulus gender and both genetic polymorphisms. Notably, a
statistically significant decrease in facial age discrimination
accuracy is present in responses to the 9- to 12-year-old con-
dition relative to the 1- to 4-year-old and 5- to 8-year-old
conditions. It is thus possible that individuals with the CD38
CC genotype were uniquely in a position to perceive and
respond to this presumed change in difficulty (i.e., by slow-
ing down) in a way that facilitated a consistent, more accu-
rate pattern of age discrimination across all age levels.
The present study was not without limitations. We note
our small sample size relative to sample sizes found in con-
temporary genetic association studies. Nonetheless, we
believe this study highlights an interesting question and pos-
sible explanations regarding the relationship between genetic
foundations and social cognition.
We are also unable to fully account for the apparent
advantages afforded by the CD38 CC genotype within the
context of our research task. Although social cognition is
central to facial age perception, related research assessing
the CD38 locus in relation to social functioning has consis-
tently identified the C allele and particularly the CC geno-
type as conferring risk (e.g., Feldman et al., 2012; Lerer
et al., 2010; Munsue et al., 2010).
Such "allele flips" (i.e., study-to-study variations in indi-
cating which allele is associated with risk) are not uncommon
across different association studies of oxytocinergic genes
(Michalska et al., 2014; Parker et al., 2014) and are thought to
arise due to genetic heterogeneity between the sampled popu-
lations (e.g., diverging haplotypes, differing allele frequen-
cies) as well as discordant environmental factors between
populations (Clarke & Cardon, 2010). It is unclear to what
extent our sample may have differed from previous studies
along these parameters and we cannot exclude their potential
impact upon our assignment of allele risk.
It may then be premature to assign risk to the CD38 CC
variant. Feldman et al. (2012), for example, noted that
Gross et al. 7
parents with the CD38 CC genotype had lower levels of
plasma oxytocin and touched their infants less than parents
with alternate genotypes. However, the relationship between
plasma and cerebrospinal fluid oxytocin concentrations is
unclear (Winslow, Noble, Lyons, Sterk, & Insel, 2003). As
plasma oxytocin is excluded from the central nervous system
by the blood-brain barrier, its relationship to CD38 variation,
although demonstrated, may have inconsistent bearing upon
human social behavior and cognition.
The findings demonstrated by Lerer et al. (2010) in autis-
tic children and their parents, however, may suggest a some-
what counter intuitive explanation of CD38's role in facial
age perception. Individuals with autism exhibit strength in
specific aspects of visual information processing, being
adept at identifying fine detail in complex figures and sepa-
rating figure from ground (de Jonge, Kemner, & van
Engeland, 2006; Happé & Frith, 2006). As our paradigm
assessed participants' ability to make subtle discriminations
within the context of a single stimulus set, it may have dis-
proportionately favored individuals (i.e., those of CD38 CC
genotype) possessing greater aptitude for these feature-
focused, information-processing skills.
Conclusion
This research has suggested a relationship between two SNPs,
OXTR rs53576 and CD38 rs3796863, associated with oxyto-
cinergic signaling and facial age discrimination. For OXTR,
allele assignments identified in this study are consistent with
those made in previous studies linking this polymorphism to
social behavior. For CD38, a gene less studied in relation to
social cognition, the risk allele identified in this study is differ-
ent from that identified previously. We have argued that, given
the lack of research on the CD38 gene and its social behavioral/
cognitive correlates, it may be premature to conclusively state
which allele of the CD38 SNP examined here is protective of
facial age discrimination ability. Nonetheless, it would appear
that facial age discrimination is one of a growing number of
human social behaviors and cognitive processes appreciated as
being impacted by oxytocinergic physiology and genes.

Note
1. Corrected split-half reliability coefficients were calculated
for the current procedure and ranged from r = .78 to .88. The
validity of the task was assessed by having students (N = 57)
estimate the age of faces within morphed sets of 29 faces.
Faces were presented randomly and one at a time. Correlations
between estimated ages and actual rank order of faces in sets
ranged between r = .56 to .989 with a median value of r = .935.
