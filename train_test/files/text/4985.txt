[D]uring the past two hundred years we have thought little
about the institutional design of democracy. Since the great
explosion of institutional thinking, when the present
democratic institutions were invented ­ and they were
invented ­ there has been almost no institutional creativity.

Introduction
Political scientists often distinguish between two visions of
democracy: "proportional" and "majoritarian" (Powell,
2000). Many authors also believe that it would be good to
find a compromise between these two ideals. As institu-
tional designs for achieving this compromise, some point
towards electoral systems (Carey and Hix, 2011; Shugart,
2001), others towards presidentialism (Cheibub, 2009:
1383­1384; Colomer and Negretto, 2005) and still others
towards specific versions of bicameralism (Ganghof, 2014;
Stone, 2008). This article presents a proposal which seeks
to combine elements of all three options.
In brief, I propose a form of mixed-member electoral
system in which voters elect two types of legislators, only
one of which possesses the right to dismiss the cabinet in a
no-confidence vote. Voters have a single vote to make two
simultaneous choices: one about the proportional composi-
tion of the parliament and one about the two top parties
forming a majoritarian "confidence chamber" within par-
liament. Only the majority in the confidence chamber has
the power to dismiss the cabinet in a vote of no-confidence.
The system virtually guarantees the feasibility of stable
one-party cabinets governing like minority cabinets in the
proportional legislature.
The paper proceeds in four parts. I first clarify the mean-
ing of the two visions, majoritarian and proportional, then
review existing compromise designs, sketch my own origi-
nal proposal and finally illustrate the proposed design with
data from Germany.
The two visions of democracy
The conceptual distinction between the "majoritarian" and
"proportional" visions of democracy is well-established but
Combining proportional and
majoritarian democracy:
An institutional design proposal

Abstract
The article proposes a new way to combine the "proportional" and "majoritarian" visions of democracy. The proposal
blends elements of mixed electoral systems, parliamentarism, presidentialism and bicameralism. Voters are given a single
vote to make two simultaneous choices: one about the proportional composition of the legislature and one about the
two top parties forming a majoritarian "confidence chamber" embedded within the legislature. Only the majority in this
chamber has the power to dismiss the cabinet in a vote of no-confidence. The proposed system virtually guarantees
the feasibility of identifiable and stable one-party cabinets governing with shifting, issue-specific majorities in a highly
proportional legislature. It is illustrated with respect to the 2013 federal election in Germany.

needs clarification. In the so-called "majoritarian" ideal,
voters can make a clear choice between two parties, one of
which forms a stable majority cabinet that can be held
responsible for its performance in office (Powell, 2000). In
terms of voter support, however, this model is only majori-
tarian in a perfect "Duvergerian" equilibrium; that is, when
voters are deterred from voting for third candidates, poten-
tial third candidates are deterred from entering the competi-
tion and the same two-party system exists in every district.
Real-world versions of this vision, often based on plurality
rule (first-past-the-post), typically allow a minority of vot-
ers to rule over a majority. In UK parliamentary elections,
for example, which follow first-past-the-post rule, a party
can win only 36.8 percent of the vote, as the Conservative
Party did in 2015, and yet win 50.9 percent of the seats.
The proportional vision has a commonsensical version
that focuses on the ideal of proportional representation
(PR) combined with legislative majority rule. This combi-
nation is much more likely to empower an actual majority
of voters (McGann, 2006). Powell's (2000) proportional
vision goes further, though, and also requires that parlia-
mentary parties have proportional influence on legislation.
He sketches two different specifications of this idea
(Ganghof, 2015). One is super-majoritarian in that parties
form oversized portfolio or legislative coalitions. The other
is majoritarian in that different minimal-winning coalitions
are built on different issues (Powell, 2000: 256, n.9).
Proportional influence then means that all parties get some
influence on at least some issues. It is this latter version of
the proportional vision on which I focus here (see also
Ward and Weale, 2010).1
Existing compromise designs
In purely parliamentary systems the obvious starting point
for a compromise between the majoritarian and propor-
tional ideals is the electoral system. For instance, if parties
in a proportional system are induced to form two compet-
ing pre-electoral coalitions, voters can then elect a party
that represents their views and more or less directly select
one of two cabinets. Mixed-member proportional (MMP)
systems and systems with a majority bonus can be inter-
preted in terms of this type of balancing (Shugart, 2001).
However, the degree of (mechanical) proportionality is
typically limited in this approach, because a very high
number of parties and a multi-dimensional structure of
party positions make the formation of two comprehensive
pre-election blocs less likely (Ganghof et al., 2015).
Moreover, recent elections in MMPcountries like Germany
show that limited departures from pure proportionality
such as a five percent legal threshold of representation
might not be sufficient to achieve the goals of the "majori-
tarian" vision (see below).
Presidential systems might also achieve a compromise.
The popular election of a fixed-term president is inherently
disproportional and virtually guarantees that voters will be
able to identify cabinet alternatives as well as ensures cabi-
net stability (Cheibub, 2009). The legislature, on the other
hand, can be elected proportionally to fairly represent the
position of the (issue-specific) median voter (Colomer and
Negretto, 2005). The downside of presidentialism, how-
ever, is its negative effect on the programmatic capacities
of political parties (Samuels and Shugart, 2010). Due to the
institutional separation between the legislature and the pop-
ularly elected executive, a party loses control over its presi-
dential candidate and ­ if the candidate is successful ­ over
the elected president. Hence, while the legislature may be
proportionally elected, the parties therein might not have
the capacity to deliver programmatic representation.
This problem of presidentialism can be avoided by shift-
ing the locus of power separation into the legislature. In
Australia, in particular, we find bicameral systems in which
the upper house has the same democratic legitimacy as the
lower house, as well as an absolute veto over legislation,
but no right to dismiss the cabinet. This renders it possible
to make the lower house a "majoritarian" confidence cham-
ber and the institutionally separated upper house a propor-
tional legislature (Ganghof, 2014). However, this model
does also have some downsides. Since lower house mem-
bers in Australia are elected in single-member districts
(based on alternative vote (AV) systems), single-party
majorities at the national or state levels are far from guaran-
teed. Moreover, bicameralism implies that overall propor-
tionality may be limited by a small size of the upper house.
Third, if the upper house is used for PR, its capacity to
deliver territorial representation tends to be reduced.
The proposal
My proposal modifies the Australian solution by combin-
ing it with a mixed-member electoral system.2 The idea is
to make the confidence-conferring, majoritarian part of
the legislature not a separate chamber but a differentiated
chamber within a highly proportional legislature (see
Figure 1). What the proposed system shares with
Australian bicameralism is that the cabinet survives inde-
pendently from one of two equally legitimate parts of the
legislature. I therefore refer to it as "semi-parliamentary"
(Ganghof, 2016).
Voting rules
There is one district for the entire parliament and voters
have one vote to choose between party lists. They can rank
as many lists as they like in order of preference. Their votes
are counted twice. First, voters' first preferences determine
the proportional composition of parliament ­ with no or
only a low legal threshold. Second, voters' rankings are
used to determine the two parties with the greatest support,
based on a modified AV system. The parties with the least
Ganghof 3
first-place votes are iteratively eliminated, and their votes
are transferred to each voter's second-most preferred party,
third-most preferred party, and so on. In contrast to a nor-
mal AV system, the process does not stop when one party
has received more than 50 percent of the votes, but contin-
ues until all but two parties are eliminated. Only these two
top parties receive "confidence seats" in proportion to their
final vote shares in the AV contest. One of these two parties
gets all of the seats it receives based on the proportional
count as confidence seats and thereby determines the size
of the "confidence chamber".
Table 1 illustrates the procedure with a fictitious exam-
ple of a 100-member legislature. The first column shows
eight parties A to H, the second column their proportionally
allocated seats. After the elimination of all but the top two
parties, the winning party B has gained 57 percent of the
votes, the runner-up A 43 percent. Given its proportional
vote share of first preferences, B gets 23 seats overall, all of
which are "confidence seats". A's confidence seats are
determined based on its two-party vote share, so that it gets
17 seats (43/57 × 23 = 17.4).3 The confidence chamber thus
comprises 40 members.4 In order to maintain proportional-
ity in the legislature, parties receive top-up seats. For par-
ties C to H, all of their seats are top-up seats. Party A, the
opposition party in the confidence chamber, receives both
confidence and top-up seats.5
The system allows voters to confer two mandates. With
their first preferences they confer a mandate on the fairly
determined legislative majority, which might change from
issue to issue. Analytically, we may think of this as a man-
date for the issue-specific median party. However, not all
voters engage in pure proximity voting, so that the median
party in parliament does not necessarily represent the
median voter. In any case, the moral legitimacy of the leg-
islative mandate does not depend on spatial preference
locations, but on the fairness (proportionality) of the
procedure and ultimately on the value of political equality
(e.g. McGann, 2006).
Based on voters' fuller preference rankings, a mandate
to form the cabinet is conferred to the winner of the AV
contest. Given the fairness argument for PR, the moral
legitimacy of this additional contest must largely be based
on instrumental considerations, such as facilitating issue-
specific decision-making (Ward and Weale, 2010) or
achieving accountability (Powell, 2000). The voting
method for the confidence chamber should, nevertheless,
be as fair as practically feasible. AV is preferable to plural-
ity rule in that no votes are wasted and the winner com-
mands an absolute majority of the votes in the final count.
I do not have the space to systematically compare AV to
alternatives such as approval voting, the Coombs rule or the
Borda count, but want to highlight three attractive proper-
ties of AV: first, a party with an absolute majority of first-
preferences votes will always be selected as the winner;
second, voters can submit incomplete preference rankings
without being discriminated against (cf. Emerson, 2013);
and third, a manipulation of the outcome via strategic vot-
ing would require a rather high level of sophistication
(Grofman and Feld, 2004: 652).
The proposed system also aims at combining different
ideals of accountability. First, the prime minister and the
cabinet are accountable to the majority in the confidence
chambers. If the AV contest selected the government with-
out giving the strongest opposition party seats in the confi-
dence chamber, the governing party's control over the
cabinet would be reduced (as it is in a presidential system).
With the presence of the opposition party, the cabinet's
position cannot move too far away from its party without
risking defections and a successful no-confidence vote.
Second, the legislature as a whole is also charged with the
task of controlling the cabinet. Since this cabinet is likely to
have minority status in the legislature, this task can be more
meaningfully pursued than in the pure majoritarian vision
(Stone, 2008). Third, relatively pure PR allows for the easy
entry of new parties, which provides a way to keep all
existing parliamentary parties accountable (McGann,
2013).
One concern about the proposed system should be men-
tioned. The proliferation of small parties may be greater
than under a pure PR parliamentary system, everything else
being equal, because voters can use their second preference
to choose the cabinet. It would, therefore, be possible that a
rather small (centrist) party can form the government. In
the example in Table 1, the winning party B is only the
second-largest party in the proportional vote. I have argued
that this is justifiable, since the winning party (1) needs
absolute majority support in the final count of the AV con-
test and (2) must build majority coalitions in the propor-
tional parliament to pass legislation. If voters themselves
do not come to see it this way, though, perceived legitimacy
may suffer. This is an important point for further

consideration. Note, however, that if this were indeed a
problem, it would be possible to choose a higher legal
threshold for the proportional count. A semi-parliamentary
system is more flexible than a pure parliamentary system in
that it sets two distinct thresholds (cf. Ganghof, 2016): in
this case, a legal threshold of representation for the propor-
tional count and an implicit threshold of confidence author-
ity in the AV contest.
Inter-institutional rules
From the perspective of legislative decision-making, one
might hope that the outcome of the AV contest is centrist, so
that cabinet's policy position is identical or close to that of
the median legislative party on the most important issue
dimension(s). This would likely make it easier for the cabinet
to win the majority support of the proportional parliament at
large to pass legislation. A centrist outcome is far from guar-
anteed, however. For one thing, even in a one-dimensional
space and with pure proximity voting, the outcome of theAV
contest may systematically diverge from the median voter
(McGann et al., 2002). For another, complications like mul-
tidimensionality, party identification, valence advantages,
candidate characteristics or directional voting might all con-
tribute to (moderately) non-centrist cabinets (McDonald
et al., 2012). This outcome might be desirable, if the majori-
tarian vision is meant to give voters a clear choice between
alternatives. Yet it also implies that the two mandates can
conflict. I will briefly sketch institutional rules that might
contribute to achieving a reasonable balance between them,
but other solutions also exist (Stone, 2008).
The legislature as a whole and the confidence chamber
should both have the right to initiate and amend legisla-
tion. The legislature must certainly possess a veto over all
(non-budgetary) legislation. It might be denied a veto
over the annual budget, as this veto could be turned into a
de facto no-confidence vote. This problem should not be
overstated, however, because the opposition party in the
confidence chamber is unlikely to have a majority in the
proportional legislature. Most upper houses in Australia
do possess a budget veto: the Australian Senate as well as
the Legislative Councils in South Australia, Western
Australia and Tasmania.6
The confidence chamber, and hence the cabinet, might
also be given a veto over legislation to protect its core pro-
gram ­ as is, of course, the case for the lower houses in
Australian bicameralism. However, it is not entirely clear
that this is necessary. Given the PR-based legitimacy of an
issue-specific legislative majority, we might want the gov-
ernment to take its preferences into account. A partial sub-
stituteforthecabinet'svetopowercouldbeits(unavoidable)
dissolution power. If the cabinet loses confidence in the
confidence chamber and no new cabinet can be formed
(which is likely), the entire parliament has to be dissolved
and new elections held. This implies that the cabinet can
virtually always threaten to dissolve the entire parliament if
legislation is passed ­ or vetoed ­ in ways that undermine
its core program. This dissolution threat allows the cabinet
to defend its policies against the median parliamentary
party, if public opinion is favorable to these policies (Becher
and Christiansen, 2015).
Of course, veto and dissolution powers are blunt instru-
ments to solve a conflict of mandates. A complementary
rule would be to allow the cabinet (or its majority in the
confidence chamber) to refer only the conflicted issue
back to the voters.An analogous solution has been adopted
in New South Wales, where a popular referendum, initi-
ated by the lower house, is the only way to resolve bicam-
eral deadlock on a particular bill. If the cabinet is given a
veto over legislation, the legislative majority should prob-
ably also be able to initiate a referendum on a deadlocked
proposal. Giving both agents this power would give
greater bargaining strength to whichever agent's position
is deemed closer to the issue-specific median voter. Given
the inherent uncertainty of a referendum, both agents
would generally have strong incentives to compromise
and avoid the referendum.

In the past, this system balanced elements of the two visions
reasonably well (Shugart, 2001). It limited the number of
parties and helped to organize them into two competing
blocs, while also achieving a high degree of empirical pro-
portionality. Moreover, it allowed party elites to generally
avoid Grand Coalitions of the major parties. Recently,
though, elections have failed to approximate either of the
two visions.
Consider the latest federal election of 2013 (Poguntke
and von Dem Berge, 2014). Figure 2 shows parties' prefer-
ences in two dimensions based on the 2014 Chapel Hill sur-
vey. The boldfaced labels indicate parties that gained
parliamentary representation; parties with less than two
percent of the vote are excluded. Almost 17 percent of the
German voters wasted their votes by selecting parties that
did not pass the threshold. The most important of these par-
ties were the Liberals (FDP), the Euro-skeptic Alternative
for Germany (AfD) and the Pirate Party.7 Despite this sub-
stantial disproportionality, though, crucial goals of the
majoritarian vision were not achieved. Voters could not
identify competing cabinet options before the election, as
there were no broad pre-electoral alliances. The election
resulted in a Grand Coalition of Christian and Social
Democrats, controlling 80 percent of the seats in Bundestag;
this was the second Grand Coalition in the last three federal
elections. The opposition currently exists only on the left
and does not represent a feasible alternative government.
With the system proposed here, the five percent thresh-
old could have been abolished or significantly reduced.
This would have led to a fairer and more multidimensional
representation of voter preferences in the legislative pro-
cess. The AfD would have represented the Euro-skeptic
position on the right (on the EU dimension not shown in the
Figure), the Liberals would have stood for the combination
of economic and social liberalism. At the same time, voters
could have directly chosen a stable one-party cabinet. The
Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) would probably have
won the AV contest. They could thus have governed with
flexible, issue-specific majorities. Where the CDU was not
the issue-specific median party, the party that was could
have initiated policy change against the government or
vetoed legislation.
In the particular example, the proposed system would
probably have reduced the bargaining strength of the
Social Democrats, who would likely have lost their veto
player status as a cabinet party. But this is not due to any
systematic bias. To the contrary, Germany's Social
Democrats seem disadvantaged under the current system,
because a center-left portfolio coalition that includes the
Left Party is opposed by important parts of both parties.
Social Democrats have thus been torn between the incen-
tive to capture the median voter and the effort to maintain
a leftist profile in order to limit electoral losses and facili-
tate a center-left portfolio coalition. This sort of asymmet-
ric coordination failure would be less consequential in the
proposed system. Since the Social Democrats would not
need a coalition partner to get into office, they would be
free to pursue an office-oriented strategy of median cap-
ture; and if they did win office, the Left Party would be
free to support a Social Democratic cabinet on a selective,
issue-specific basis.
Prima facie, it might seem that the proposed system
would be unstable, as the opposition parties could coordi-
nate to change it (if constitutional amendment rules and
their combined seat share allow this). However, a party like
the Social Democrats might well prefer the chance of form-
ing a one-party government some of the time to being a
junior cabinet party most of the time; and the smaller oppo-
sition parties might benefit from greater issue-specific leg-
islative influence without having to assume responsibility
for the entire government program. Stability would also
increase if voters came to value the system and threatened
to sanction reforms.
Conclusion
It might seem unlikely that established democracies would
consider the kind of system proposed here, but this should
not keep us from further analyzing its positive and norma-
tive advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, elements of
such a system might be worth considering in efforts to
democratize complex systems like the European Union.
Given the partisan fragmentation of the European
Parliament, a purely parliamentary system of government
would be unlikely to give European voters a clear choice
between alternative mandates. It is more likely to lead to a
permanent Grand Coalition. This is partly why the direct
election of a European president often appears to be the
only viable path to meaningful democratization (cf. Hix,
2014: 195). Yet a switch to presidentialism would likely

have a strongly negative long-term effect on the emergence
of programmatic European parties ­ and thus on the EU's
overall democratic capacity. If we want to give European
voters a clear choice without undermining programmatic
parties and PR, adequately Europeanized elements of the
semi-parliamentary system proposed here might be worth
considering. But this is the topic for another paper.

Notes
1. Since both ideals just sketched are majoritarian, I prefer to
distinguish between the polar visions of "simple majori-
tarianism" and "complex majoritarianism" (Ganghof, 2015;
Ganghof et al., 2015). The former aims at keeping the pro-
cess of majority formation cognitively simple for voters,
even at the price of accepting a larger gap between ideal and
reality. The latter accepts a great deal of complexity from
the start: multiple parties, multiple dimensions and multiple
coalitions. The terminology is not important, though. The
core question here is how identifiable, stable and responsible
cabinets, on the one hand, might be reconciled with PR and
multidimensional, issue-specific decision-making, on the
other.
2. The proposal also resembles the Swiss system of govern-
ment in some ways and promises to mitigate one of its main
downsides: voters' inability to identify and choose between
competing cabinet options (Ganghof, 2014: 657­658).
3. The seat share of the runner-up should be rounded down to
avoid ties. The total number of confidence seats might also
be required to be uneven.
4. Note that the size of the confidence committee should be
fixed by the party with the smaller ratio between its total
seats and its vote share in the AV contest. In Table 1, the ratio
is 0.4 for B (23/57) and 0.63 for A (27/43). Now imagine that
A wins the AV contest against B 60 to 40 and the two parties
get 30 and 18 seats, respectively, in the proportional count.
The ratio would then be larger for the winning party A (30/60
or 0.5 versus 18/40 or 0.45). If A's seats fixed the size of the
confidence committee in this case, B's number of confidence
seats would be 20, which is greater than B's total seats. This
is why B should get all of its 18 seats as confidence seats and
A should get 27 confidence seats plus three top-up seats. I
thank Joachim Behnke for alerting me to this issue.
5. Similarly, in Australia parties in parliament organize in
single parliamentary groups, even though only one part of
the equally legitimate legislators, those sitting in the lower
house, have the right to participate in the no-confidence vote.
6. If the legislature as a whole is denied a veto over the annual
budget, the confidence chamber must possess this veto right.
7. The AfD has subsequently lost its prominent Euro-skeptic
wing and developed a more distinctly xenophobic profile.
