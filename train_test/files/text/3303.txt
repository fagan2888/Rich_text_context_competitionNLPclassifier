Agreement Between HEDIS Performance
Assessments in the VA and Medicare
Advantage: Is Quality in the Eye of the
Beholder?

Abstract
Medicare Advantage (MA) plans and the Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system assess quality of care using standardized
Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) performance measures. Little is known, however, about the
relative accuracy of quality indicators for persons receiving care in more than one health care system. Among Veterans
dually enrolled in an MA plan, we examined the agreement between MA and VA HEDIS assessments. Our study tested
the hypothesis that private health plans underreport quality of care relative to a fully integrated delivery system utilizing
a comprehensive electronic health record. Despite assessing the same individuals using identical measure specifications,
reported VA performance was significantly better than reported MA performance for all 12 HEDIS measures. The VA's
performance advantage ranged from 9.8% (glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c] < 7.0% in diabetes) to 54.7% (blood pressure
< 140/90 mm Hg in diabetes). The overall agreement between VA and MA HEDIS assessments ranged from 38.5% to 62.6%.
Performance rates derived from VA and MA aggregate data were 1.6% to 14.3% higher than those reported by VA alone.
This analysis suggests that neither MA plans nor the VA fully capture quality of care information for dually enrolled persons.
However, the VA's system-wide electronic health record may allow for more complete capture of quality information across
multiple providers and settings.

Introduction
Medicare Advantage (MA) plans and the Veterans Affairs (VA)
health care system assess quality of care using, among other
things, standardized Healthcare Effectiveness Data and
Information Set (HEDIS) performance measures. Performance
data are publicly reported and influence health plan and pro-
vider payments, so have material consequences. Little is known,
however, about the relative accuracy of HEDIS data for persons
receiving care in more than one health care system.
Quality of care performance data in the VA often exceeds
that reported from private health care settings generally, and
MAplans specifically.1,2 The differences may partially result
from dissimilar documentation of care in the data sources
used for calculating performance rates. Private plans typi-
cally generate performance data using insurance claims or
abstracted charts, which may fail to capture the entirety of a
patient's care compared with VA's comprehensive electronic
health record (EHR).3-5 Furthermore, the VA by law cannot
bill MA plans for services.6 Therefore, MA plans that rely
on claims to measure quality may have limited ability to
track care processes that occur in the VA. We examined the
agreement between MA and VA quality assessments for a
group of dually enrolled Veterans. Our study tested the
hypothesis that private health plans underreport quality of
care relative to fully integrated delivery systems utilizing a
comprehensive EHR.

Methods
We identified dually enrolled individuals sampled for the
same MA HEDIS and VA External Peer Review Program
(EPRP) HEDIS comparator indicator in either 2008 or 2009.
We compared performance rates reported by MA plans and
VA and assessed agreement using McNemar test for mar-
ginal homogeneity. The unit of analysis was the patient. We
also conducted stratified analyses for individuals having at
least 10 MA outpatient encounters in the measurement year.
Results
The number of individuals sampled for measurement by both
systems in the same year ranged from 249 (cholesterol con-
trol in coronary heart disease) to 600 (HbA1c testing in dia-
betes) (Table 1). Reported VA performance was significantly
better than reported MA performance for all 12 measures,
with VA's performance advantage ranging from 9.8% (glyco-
sylated hemoglobin [HbA1c] < 7.0% in diabetes) to 54.7%
(blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg in diabetes). The overall
agreement ranged from 38.5% to 62.6%. Performance rates
derived from VAand MAaggregate data were 1.6% to 14.3%
higher than those reported by VA alone.
In sensitivity analyses limited to individuals having at
least 10 MA outpatient encounters, the VA reported better
performance than MA for 11 of the 12 measures (ranging
from 9.9% to 35.9%), and overall agreement between VA
and MA assessment improved only modestly (ranging from
48.5% to 78.7%) (Table 2).
Discussion
The VA classified significantly more patients as having met
outpatient performance targets than did MA plans despite
assessing the same individuals using identical measure
specifications. We observed similar degrees of disagreement
for both processes of care and intermediate outcomes.
MA plans primarily use claims-based methods to assess
process measures; intermediate outcome assessment typi-
cally requires additional chart review. Pawlson and col-
leagues noted that claims underreport quality relative to
approaches using both claims and chart review.5 In addition,
plans typically collect quality information from heteroge-
neous providers in their networks. The VA's system-wide
EHR may allow for more complete capture of quality infor-
mation across multiple providers and settings.3,7 In addition,
the VA often includes clinical reminders for providers to
document adherence to clinical performance metrics, even
when care occurs in non-VA settings.8
Among persons enrolled in both systems, performance rates
that integrate information from both VA and MA sources were
higher than rates considering information from either system
alone.Although we did not validate reported performance rates

from either system, our findings suggest that neither MA plans
nor the VA fully capture quality of care information for dually
enrolled persons. However, the VA may be positioned to report
substantially better clinical performance because its documen-
tation is more complete. Further studies should compare the
accuracy of publicly reported quality data from insurers and
integrated delivery systems, particularly for individuals
enrolled in multiple health systems.
