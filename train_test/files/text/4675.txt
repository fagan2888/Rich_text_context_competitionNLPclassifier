ABSTRACT
The present study delineates the large-scale, organic
responses of growth in the dorsal pallium to targeted
genetic ablations of the principal PP (preplate) neurons of
the neocortex. Ganciclovir treatment during prenatal
development [from E11 (embryonic age 11) to E13] of
mice selectively killed cells with shared S-phase vulner-
ability and targeted expression of a GPT [golli promoter
transgene; GPT linked to HSV-TK (herpes simplex virus-
thymidine kinase), t-eGFP and lacZ reporters] localized in
PP neurons and their intermediate progenitor neuroblasts.
The volume, area and thickness of the pallium were
measured in an E12­P4 (postnatal age 4) longitudinal study
with comparisons between ablated (HSV-TK+/0) and control
(HSV-TK0/0) littermates. The extent of ablations was also
systematically varied, and the effect on physical growth
was assessed in an E18 cross-sectional study. The
morphological evidence obtained in the present study
supports the conclusion that genetically targeted ablations
delay the settlement of the principal PP neurons of the
dorsal pallium. This leads to progressive and substantial
reductions of growth, despite compensatory responses that
rapidly replace the ablated cells. These growth defects
originate from inductive cellular interactions in the
proliferative matrix of the ventricular zone of the pallium,
but are amplified by subsequent morphogenic and trophic
cellular interactions. The defects persist during the course
of prenatal and postnatal development to demonstrate a
constrained dose­response relationship with the extent of
specific killing of GPT neurons. The defects propagate
simultaneously in both the horizontal and vertical
cytoarchitectural dimensions of the developing pallium,
an outcome that produces a localized shortfall of volume in
the telencephalic vesicles.
Key words: forebrain growth, morphogenesis, neocortex,
pathogenesis, preplate, targeted ablation.
INTRODUCTION
The evolution of mammalian forebrain is dominated by the
development of neocortex within the dorsal pallium (hereafter
referred to as pallium). Early­generated PP (preplate) neurons
are leading cells in this assembly, which links the phylogeny
and ontogeny of neo-, juxtallo- and allo-cortex in the
telencephalic marginal and mantle zones (Marin-Padilla,
1971, 1998). The principal PP neurons are believed to serve
as a transient framework for the morphogenesis of neocortex
via radial migration, laminar framing and guidance of afferent
ingrowth (Luskin and Shatz, 1985; Ghosh and Shatz, 1993;
Allendoerfer and Shatz, 1994; McConnell et al., 1994; Molnar
and Blakemore, 1995; Ogawa et al., 1995; Valverde et al., 1995;

Super and Uylings, 2001; Sarnat and Flores-Sarnat, 2002; Xie
et al., 2002, 2009). They mould features of the vertical and the
horizontal cytoarchitecture that are the structural foundations
for the actions of mature neocortex (Jones, 1988).

Evidence based on the purported ablation of PP neurons
plays an important role in this conceptual framework.
However, these findings entail persistent issues with regard
to the selectivity of ablations, the dearth of quantitative
estimates of specific cell killing and the lack of systematic
assessments of the impact of ablations on fundamental
aspects of the phenotype such as forebrain growth. Our
recent investigations address these issues by a powerful
combination of molecular biological and neurochemical
methods for the specific identification and reasonably
selective ablation of the principal PP neurons in transgenic
mice (Landry et al., 1998; Xie et al., 2002, 2009; Jacobs et al.,
2007). The proximal GPT (golli promoter transgene) of the
MBP (myelin basic protein) gene exhibits early and restricted
expression in cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb and sensory
ganglia. It can drive the expression of useful reporter genes,
including HSV-TK (herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase), for
the structural identification of the principal PP neurons and
their neuroblasts (hereafter referred to collectively as GPT
cells). The GPT neurons match the morphological properties of
the principal PP neurons because they proliferate from GPT-
expressing intermediate progenitors confined to the dorsal
pallial VZ (ventricular zone), undergo radial migration with a
neurogenetic pattern of `outside-in' settlement in the
marginal and mantle zones, emit the earliest corticofugal
pioneer axons and tend to show shorter periods of survival
than cortical plate neurons.
When GPT drives the co-expression of HSV-TK, the prodrug
ganciclovir can be converted into toxic nucleotide analogues
that disrupt DNA synthesis in genetically targeted GPT
progenitors. This initiates apoptosis in their daughter
GPT cells (neurons and/or neuroblasts), which complete
mitotic division after shared S-phase vulnerability (Moolten,
1986; Xie et al., 2009). Such treatments produce specific,
transient and additive killing of as much as 90% of the
normal complement of GPT cells. As shown in the initial
qualitative survey of the ablation phenotype, the developing
pallium presents a wide array of cell disarrangements that
eventually result in retarded vertical growth and mild
dyslamination, early defects that may be exacerbated by
late-onset hydrocephalus (Xie et al., 2002). A subsequent
quantitative analysis reveals the remarkable reorganization of
pallial GPT neurons and neuroblasts in the ablation
phenotype, which responds to their induced apoptosis by
compensatory reconstitution of VZ progenitors, delayed
settlement of GPT replacement neurons with a near-normal
restoration of their total complement and failed emission of
pioneer corticofugal axons (Xie et al., 2009). We now deploy a
quantitative analysis of the large-scale regional organization
of the pallium in the ablation phenotype, in order to test the
hypothesis that the ablation of GPT cells impairs vertical, but
not horizontal, growth within the pallium and its neocortical
derivative. The developmental expansion of the pallium and
its parts is compared in time series between littermate control
and genetically targeted mice with equivalent exposures to
ganciclovir during the early fetal period of generation of GPT
cells. For the first time, the number of ganciclovir treatments
and the ages at ganciclovir exposure are also varied
systematically to determine whether the phenotypic growth
defects of the ablation exhibit a dose­response relationship
with the extent of specific GPT cell killing.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Many of the methods used here were described fully in
previous reports (Landry et al., 1998; Xie et al., 2002, 2009;
Jacobs et al., 2007). New observations were obtained from
119 mice (74 HSV-TK+/0 experimentals; 45 HSV-TK0/0 controls)
randomly selected from 24 timed pregnancies [day of
mating5E0.5 (embryonic age 0.5; as defined by common
use; technically, mice at ages greater than E7 are fetuses
because the heart displays co-ordinated contraction), day of
birth5P1 (postnatal age 1)]. Data from males and females
were equivalent and pooled. Mice were housed in the UCLA
School of Medicine vivarium, and procedures were conducted
as per the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals.
Generation and ablation of transgenic mice
Establishment and histological identification of
genotypes
Transgenic genotypes were produced using the proximal GPT for
the MBP gene to drive expression of linked, non-native reporter
transgenes for HSV-TK and lacZ galactosidase (lacZ; Landry et al.,
1998; Xie et al., 2002, 2009). The GPT element inserted into all
mice was a fragment containing 1.1 kb upstream of the golli
transcription start site plus 0.2 kb downstream into the first
exon of the MBP gene. Only one transgenic line was studied.
Double transgenics were generated by crossing hemizygous
HSV-TK and homozygous lacZ mice to produce HSV-TK+/0/lacZ+/+
(experimental) and HSV-TK0/0/lacZ+/+ (control, wild-type) mice.
Cross-validation of genotypes by PCR
The GPT/HSV-TK transgene was identified in founder breeders
and all experimental mice by PCR using the MGTB sense
primer 59-CTGAGCTTCACGACCCCGGAACATAGT (within GPT)
and the HSV-TK3P antisense primer 39-GTCATGCTGCCCATA-
AGGTATCGCG. The GPT/lacZ transgene was identified in all
mice using the MGTB sense primer and the b-galactosidase
antisense primer 39-CTCATCCGCCACATATCCTGATCTTCC. For
PCR amplification, a 25 ml reaction was assembled containing
200 ng of genomic DNA, 10 pmol of primer, 4 mM MgCl2
,
0.2 mM dNTPs, PCR buffer (Promega) and 1.25 units of Taq
DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.). After
denaturation, PCR products were analysed on 1% agarose TAE
(Tris/acetate/EDTA) gel. As in previous reports (Landry et al.,
1998; Xie et al., 2002; Jacobs et al., 2007), the HSV-TK

reporter in experimental mice was 0.6 kb and the lacZ
b-galactosidase reporter in all mice was 1.1 kb.
Ganciclovir treatments
Ganciclovir (Cytovene-IVTM, Roche Laboratories, Nuffy, NJ,
U.S.A.) was diluted to 0.25 mg/ml water vehicle. For large
ablations in the main treatment group, pregnant dams received
two intraperitoneal injections of ganciclovir (20 mg/g of body
weight) on E11 and E12 (four injections at 10­12 h intervals;
Xie et al., 2002, 2009). For smaller ablations to assess serial
lesion effects, pregnant dams received ganciclovir treatments
on the following schedules: three injections on E11­E12, two
injections on E11, E12, E13, E14, E15 or E17, one injection on
E11, one injection on E12 and one injection on E11 (genotypes,
treatment ages and ganciclovir treatment schedules shown in
Figure 9). Treatment age groups were selected due to positive
expression of HSV-TK in pallial VZ progenitors of unablated
experimental mice on E11­E13 (Xie et al., 2009). Experimental
mice that received vehicle instead of ganciclovir on E11­E12, or
ganciclovir on E14­E17, had no damage. All mice were alive at
delivery as shown by spontaneous movement.
Histological preparations
Tissue processing
Pregnant dams were anaesthetized with halothane and
terminated by cervical dislocation to obtain fetal tissue on
E12­16 and E18. Fetuses were delivered, brains dissected and
tissues immersed in 0.9% (w/v) NaCl and 4% (w/v) para-
formaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS fixative. Postpartum mice were
anaesthetized with halothane and perfused transcardially with
fixative to obtain tissue on P1 and P4. Tissues were immersion-
fixed for 1 h at 4°C, cryoprotected for 24 h in 30% (w/v) sucrose,
frozen in OCTTM, sectioned serially at 20 mm thickness in the
coronal plane and mounted on subbed glass slides. The section
interval was 400 mm along the rostrocaudal axis of the forebrain.
Mice were terminated mainly on two age schedules designed
to establish (i) a longitudinal time series for assessment of the
development of the phenotypic features of the ablations and
(ii) a late cross-sectional index age for assessment of persistent
ablation defects. For (i), mice from one small treatment group
(two ganciclovir injections on E11) were terminated on E12
and mice from the main treatment group (four ganciclovir
injections on E11 and E12) were terminated on E13­16, E18, P1
and P4 for the time series from E12 to P4. For (ii), mice from all
treatment groups were terminated at E18 as the index age in
order to obtain measurements after the substantial accumula-
tion of growth defects, but before the later advent of
potentially complicating processes of myelination in all mice
and hydrocephalus in mice with severe ablations.
lacZ b-galactosidase histochemistry
Mounted sections were treated in 0.01% sodium deoxycho-
late, 0.02% Nonidet P40, 2 mM MgCl2
and 0.1 M NaHPO4
(pH
7.3) for 10 min at room temperature (25°C) and then
incubated in X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-D-galac-
toside) labelling solution [2 mM MgCl2
, 5 mM K3
Fe(CN)6
, 5
mM K4
Fe(CN)6
plus 0.1 M NaHPO4
, pH 7.3, 0.01% sodium
deoxycholate, 0.02% Nonidet P40 and 8 mg/ml X-gal] for 6­
16 h at 37°C followed by a PBS stop-bath. Method specificity
of labelling of GPT neurons was confirmed by omission of X-
gal treatment in `control' sections from each case. Labelled
sections were used for co-localization experiments and
counterstained in some cases with Neutral Red (Figure 5;
ten cases), which optimized photomacroscopy, and/or Harris
haematoxylin (regressive method; all cases), for improved
high-contrast recognition of degenerating cells, mitotic
profiles and pallial laminae.
Other background materials
Additional serial sections were obtained from many of the
cases and used for a variety of modern multiple labelling
studies included in our previous report (cf. Xie et al., 2009, for
details of specimen production and measurement). LacZ-
labelled cells in control and ablated mice were compared for
determining the impact of ganciclovir treatment on the
densities of GPT neurons, while pyknosis and TUNEL (terminal
deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end label-
ling) labelled cells were compared for assessing the impact of
ganciclovir treatment on the densities of apoptotic cells.
Sections obtained from other control and ablated mice of
comparable ages were also used for double-labelling studies
to cross-validate the developmental patterns of expression of
lacZ and HSV-TK reporters in GPT neurons. Finally, sections
from other control and ablated mice were used for double-
labelling studies to determine the ages when GPT neurons
and neuroblasts were generated, as shown by incorporation
of BrdU (bromodeoxyuridine). Data from these studies were
used to quantitatively estimate by ablation group (but not by
case within each ablation group) the extent of specific cell
killing during the initial phase of the ablation, which divided
ablation groups on the basis of ratio instead of nominal scale
values for parametric statistical analyses.
Morphological analysis
Histological differences were assessed by comparisons
between and within genotype, treatment and age groups.
Observations were obtained by light microscopy with bright-
field transmission illumination (Zeiss Ultraphot IIIB and Leica
DMRXA microscopes). Data were recorded by analogue film
and digital photography, as well as by camera lucida
mapping.
Trends observed by qualitative methods were pursued by
quantitative measurements, mainly volumetric, horizontal
areal and vertical linear indices of the pallium and its parts, to
assess the statistical reliability of differences between groups.
Measurements were obtained bilaterally from each case in
each group (115 total measured cases; 72 ablated mice; 43

control mice). Developmental patterns of co-extensive
pallium and neocortex were bilaterally symmetric in all
groups, so measurements were averaged across hemispheres
in each case. The pallium had a lateral-to-medial horizontal
neurogenetic gradient reflected in the vertical extent and
density of neocortical GPT neurons, so sampling sites for
vertical linear indices were selected from its flat-mapped
centre where measurements approximated averages from
lateral and medial limits. Lateral and medial boundaries of
neocortex within pallium were denoted by distinct breaks in
densities of labelled GPT neurons near the cingulum and
rhinal sulcus, while ventricular and pial surfaces were
proximal and distal boundaries for volumetric and horizontal
areal measurements (Figures 3 and 5). The laminar distri-
bution of haematoxylin-stained cell bodies between
ventricular and pial surfaces denoted the boundaries of each
component for vertical linear measurements. Some, but not
all, ablated mice had pallial scars, which obliterated all
laminar boundaries. These scars contained few if any GPT or
non-GPT neurons, so they were measured as a separate
part of total values obtained for volumetric and horizontal
areal indices. Sampling sites selected for vertical linear
measurements were always in unscarred pallium to assure
homologous locations, well-lateral to scars, between groups.
Design considerations and scales of measurements
The logical status of variables and the nature of their
measurements merited close consideration because of the
central role of statistical analyses in the present study.
Dependent variables based on volume, area and thickness
were ratio scale measurements used to estimate the growth of
pallium. Ablation first served as a dependent variable to
estimate the specific killing of GPT neurons during and shortly
after ganciclovir treatment. For convenience, independent
variables are denoted in italics in the remainder of this paper.
ablation was used subsequently as an intervening, independ-
ent variable to probe the relationship between the magnitudes
of specific killing of GPT neurons and pallial growth.
Depending on the requirements of statistical analyses, ablation
could be characterized by ratio or ordinal scale values. Age was
an independent variable tested for the influence on the
generation of ablations and pallial growth. It was characterized
by ratio scale measurements.
Volumetric measurements
The series of sections from each case was drawn by camera
lucida at a total projected magnification of 665 [E12­E14
groups; 64 zoom objective, NA (numerical aperature)50.09] or
632.5 (E15­P4 groups; 62 zoom objective, NA50.05;
Figure 3). The boundaries of the pallium with neocortex on
each tissue section, including scars when present, were marked,
based on microscopic observations of lacZ and haematoxylin-
stained cells, and then measured bilaterally by planimetry
(Teledyne Post planimeter; Figure 5, lines A-A9-B9-B). Areal
values were expanded by section interval to estimate total
volume, scar volume (when present) and unscarred volume of
pallium, with a shrinkage correction of 10% in each of the
three measured dimensions. Values were averaged across
cerebral hemispheres for each case and then averaged
across cases for each genotype, treatment and termination
age group. Grouped data for each time series were compared
statistically, mainly by two-way ANOVAs and pairwise Student's
t tests with fixed values of Pa
(probability of type I error) ,0.01
and ,0.05 respectively [one-tailed tests; the latter demon-
strated graphically by non-overlapping means¡S.E.M.
(X¡S.E.M.)] as the criteria of reliable differences between
groups (Ferguson, 1971; UCLA Statistics Online Computational
Resource). The volumes of VZ/SVZ [the combined VZ and SVZ
(subventricular zone)], which incorporated the pallial proliferat-
ive matrices, were measured and compared in the same fashion.
Pallial volume was further divided in each case in order to
uncover regional differences in growth. For lateral versus me-
dial comparisons, the boundary between the lateral and
medial pallium was the dorsomedial peak of neocortex. This
landmark had a relatively fixed position throughout develop-
ment, and was associated with scars, when present, in ablated
mice. For anterior versus posterior comparisons, the boundary
between the anterior and the posterior pallium was a midsection
in each series. This boundary varied with age, had no surface
landmark and was often associated with the midpoint of scars in
ablated mice. The time series of grouped data were compared
statistically by three-way ANOVAs and pairwise Student's t tests
with fixed values of Pa
,0.01 and Pa
,0.05 respectively (one-
tailed tests) as the criteria of reliable differences between groups
(Ferguson, 1971) (StatPlus, 2008; http://www.analystsoft.com).
For brevity, only the decisions based on these analyses, with
ranges of statistical values and their appropriate degrees of
freedom (df), are detailed below.
Horizontal areal measurements
The length of the pial boundary of the pallium associated
with neocortex was measured on each camera lucida drawing
from the series of sections obtained from each case (Alvin
Plan Measure; Figure 5, lines A-A9). Linear values were
expanded by section interval to estimate pallial total area,
scar area (when present) and unscarred area, with a shrinkage
correction of 10% in each of the two measured dimensions.
Values were averaged across cerebral hemispheres for each
case and then averaged across cases for each genotype,
treatment and termination age group. Grouped data for each
time series were compared statistically, as detailed above. VZ/
SVZ areas were measured and compared in the same fashion
using the length of the ventricular boundary of the pallium
underlying neocortex (Figure 5, lines B-B9).
Vertical thickness measurements
The thicknesses of the pallium and its laminar components
were measured by direct microscopic observations of a

sampling line placed between, and orthogonal to, the pial and
ventricular surfaces (6391 total magnification; 625 object-
ive, NA50.65) of a midsection in the series obtained from
each case (Figure 5, lines C-C9). Linear values were expanded
by a shrinkage correction of 10% in the measured dimension.
Values were averaged across cerebral hemispheres for each
case and then averaged across cases for each genotype,
treatment and termination age group. Grouped data for each
time series were compared statistically, as detailed above.
Cell densities were also measured in the developing laminar
components of the pallium. Intercepts of cells with nuclear
profiles were detected by light microscopy (640 objective,
NA50.90, 61000 total magnification). For each laminar
component, cell intercepts were counted along a measurement
line (143 mm) placed horizontally to the vertical sampling line in
a midsection from each case. Values were expanded by a
shrinkage correction of 10% in the measured dimension, and an
Abercrombie correction of 0.8 consistent with a 20 mm section
thickness and an average nuclear diameter of 5 mm (Guillery,
2002). Values were extrapolated to yield cell density per mm of
tissue measured, averaged across cerebral hemispheres for each
case, and then averaged across cases for each genotype,
treatment and age group. Grouped data for each time series
were compared statistically, as detailed above.
RESULTS
Characterization of ablations
GPT cells in the dorsal pallium proved to be the exclusive
targets for specific killing. Neocortical GPT neurons were
normally generated by neuroblasts (intermediate progenitor
cells that also expressed GPT) with restricted locations in the
pallial VZ on E11­E13 (40% on E11, 50% on E12 and 10% on
E13 for total GPT neuron complement; Xie et al., 2009). The
initial ablation phenotype, as defined by transient excesses of
apoptotic GPT cells (Van Cruchten and Van den Broek, 2002;
D'Herde et al., 2003), was observed only in experimental mice
with ganciclovir treatments on E11­E13, in accord with a
genetically targeted attack on GPT intermediate progenitors.
All mice that met these three necessary and sufficient
conditions had an ablation, while all mice that failed to meet
even one condition had no ablation. Thus the occurrence of
the ablation phenotype was reliably determined by three
independent variables and/or their interactions: genotype,
ganciclovir treatment and age at treatment.
Longitudinal comparisons of control and ablated mice
showed that the full expression of the pallial ablation
phenotype was generated in three sequential phases of
apoptosis and accumulation of GPT neurons (Xie et al., 2009).
The first phase of massive early­onset apoptosis in the
ventricular and mantle zones occurred during and shortly
after ganciclovir treatments on E11­E13, coincident with
suppressed accumulation of GPT neurons in the mantle zone.
A second phase of middle-onset apoptosis restored normal
background levels of cell death on E14­E16, coincident with
reconstitution of the VZ and replacement of GPT neurons in
the mantle zone. The third phase of late-onset apoptosis
resumed moderately elevated levels of cell death, coincident
with slow dissolution of GPT neurons in the mantle zone after
E16. Growth defects, which were inherent to the full ablation
phenotype, began in the first phase and progressed
thereafter. They involved both GPT and non-GPT cells.
The effective combinations of genotype, ganciclovir
treatment and age at treatment had a dose­response
relationship with the initial, transient reductions of pallial
GPT neurons, concomitant with their specific killing, in
ablated mice (Xie et al., 2009). Treatments at 12 h intervals
produced additive serial ablations. Each treatment reduced the
accumulation of viable GPT neurons in the subsequent 12 h
period to 10% of GPT neurons normally generated by the cohort
of GPT neuroblasts available at the beginning of the period,
as shown by BrdU incorporation (i.e. at this stage of the
ablation phenotype, the principal constraint on the extent of
specific killing was the number of vulnerable target cells
present at the age of ganciclovir exposure). As shown by
pyknosis and TUNEL, the simultaneous accumulation of killed
cells doubled the proportion of `missing' GPT cells
(2690%5180%). These observations showed that the
genetically targeted ablation was a selective attack on GPT
intermediate progenitors, which gave rise by asymmetric cell
division to daughter GPT neuroblasts and GPT neurons
(Smart, 1973; Chenn and McConnell, 1995; Pontious et al.,
2008). As derivative values calculated from these observa-
tions, ablated mice with two E11 treatments and E12
termination had a predicted 90% reduction of GPT neurons
normally present on E12. Ablated mice with four E11­E12
treatments and E13 termination had a predicted 90%
reduction of GPT neurons normally present on E13. Ablated
mice with four E11­E12 treatments and E14 termination had
a predicted 81% (90%690%) reduction of the original
complement of GPT neurons normally present on E14 (after
proliferative exhaustion of normal GPT neuroblasts on E13).
For the longitudinal study, data were pooled and ablated mice
at all termination ages were considered to have minimum
permanent 81% reductions of original (but not replacement
or permanent total) complements of GPT neurons. For the
cross-sectional study, permanent reductions of original
complements of GPT neurons in ablation groups were: 81%
(four E11­E12 treatments), 70% (three E11­E12 treatments),
45% (two E12 treatments), 41% (one E11 treatment and one
E12 treatment), 36% (two E11 treatments), 18% (one E11
treatment) and 9% (two E13 treatments). The derivative
predictions were cross-validated by direct observations from
four key groups of mice. Average densities of GPT neurons
were expanded by volumes of unscarred neocortex and then
compared between control and ablated mice terminated at
ages during and shortly after ganciclovir treatment. After two
ganciclovir treatments on E11, ablated mice terminated on

E12 had an 84% reduction in the complement of GPT neurons
normally present on E12. After four treatments on E11­E12,
ablated mice terminated on E13 had an 83% reduction in the
complement of GPT neurons normally present on E13. After
four treatments on E11­E12, ablated mice terminated on E14
had a 56% reduction due to replacement of GPT neurons
killed on E11, absence of GPT neurons killed on E12 (45%) and
delayed settlement of GPT neurons normally generated on E13
(10%). After two treatments on E12, ablated mice terminated
on E14 had a 54% reduction due to unablated GPT neurons
generated on E11, absence of GPT neurons killed on E12 (45%)
and delayed settlement of GPT neurons normally generated on
E13 (10%). Minor differences between predicted and observed
neuron reductions at 24 h after the end of ganciclovir
treatments were due to misclassification of cells in early
stages of apoptosis. By E14, most of the specifically killed
apoptotic cells were cleared from the pallium.
Longitudinal study of growth reduction in the
dorsal pallium of ablated mice
The most important results of the present paper are shown in
Figures 1(A)­1(C), where pallial volume, area (at the pial
surface) and thickness were plotted against age groups and
compared between ablation groups in the longitudinal study.
Two-way ANOVAs demonstrated the overall statistical
significance of both ablation [F569.1­288.2, degrees of
freedom (df)51,64; Pa
,0.01] and age (F561.9­305.8;
df57,64; Pa
,0.01) main effects, and the ablation6age
interaction (F532.2­110.5; df57,64; Pa
,0.01), on volume,
area and thickness between E12 and P4. Growth of all
dependent variables occurred as an additive function of age
in control and ablated mice, regardless of the source of
volume and area measurements in total (scarred plus
unscarred) or unscarred pallium (Figures 1A and 1B). Within
the additive function of age in ablated mice, pallial growth
was also progressively reduced regardless of scar inclusion.
Graphic comparisons at each age level showed statistically
reliable differences between control and ablated mice for the
cumulative growth of all three dependent variables on and
after E13 (Figures 1A­1C; Student's t tests; df56­8;
Pa
,0.05). No reliable differences were obtained between
cerebral hemispheres on any of these measurements.
The graphs also demonstrate that statistical requirements
of homogeneity of variance and linearity were fulfilled for all
dependent variables in the tested study period. Thus ANOVA
coefficients of determination for volume (control versus
ablated total pallium R250.82; control versus ablated
unscarred pallium R250.79) represented the total propor-
tions of variance due to ablation and age main effects, and
the ablation6age interaction. Slightly greater R2 values
were obtained for surface area (control versus ablated total
pallium R250.89; control versus ablated unscarred pal-
lium R250.85) and thickness (control versus ablated pallium
R250.91). These robust values revealed the sufficiency of a
linear model with two main effects to account for the
differences observed between the groups.
The trends for all three dependent variables had early
deflections (`hinge regions') that reflected stalled growth, but
not tissue loss, in the ablated pallium between E11 and E13,
coincident with the first phase of apoptosis associated with
the specific killing of GPT neurons (Figure 1). Late deflections
reflected a second period of stalled growth of volume and
area in the ablated pallium between E15 and E16, near the
close of the second phase of suppressed apoptosis associated
with the restoration of GPT neurons. The relatively small scale
of these deflections did not hamper linear regression of
dependent variables with age, which generated predicted E11
`pretreatment' values and slopes, a useful single-value
indicator of growth rate.
Quantitative volume defects
Pallial volume in control mice increased from 0.46¡0.10 mm3
(X¡S.E.M.) to 13.32¡0.62 mm3 between E12 and P4, a
measured cumulative growth of 2796% (calculated from P4­
E12/E12 values; Figure 1A). Volume was reliably correlated
with age (Pearson product­moment correlation coefficient
r50.95; df536; Pa
,0.05) with a growth rate (identical with
the slope of the linear regression equation) of 1.10 mm3/day.
The predicted E11 volume (0.36 mm3) yielded a cumulative
growth of 3600% (P4­E11/E11 values).
Pallial total volume in ablated mice increased from
0.36¡0.04 to 7.04¡0.86 mm3 between E12 and P4, a
measured cumulative growth of 1856%. The total volume was
reliably correlated with age (r50.89; df538; Pa
,0.05) with a
growth rate of 0.52 mm3/day, less than half of the control
value. The predicted E11 total volume (0.36 mm3, the
predicted E11 control value) yielded a cumulative growth of
1856% in ablated mice. At P4, the predicted total volume in
ablated mice was 52% of the control value, similar to an
observed reduction to 53% (i.e. a 47% growth shortfall).
Pallial unscarred volume in ablated mice increased from
0.36¡0.04 to 5.86¡0.84 mm3 between E12 and P4, a
measured cumulative growth of 1528%. Unscarred volume
was reliably correlated with age (r50.87; df538; Pa
,0.05)
with a growth rate of 0.44 mm3/day, less than half of the
control value. The predicted E11 unscarred volume (0.36 mm3)
yielded a cumulative growth of 1528% in ablated mice. At P4,
the predicted unscarred volume in ablated mice was 42% of the
control value, similar to an observed reduction to 44% (a 56%
growth shortfall).
Scars were observed in all ablated, and no control, mice in
the longitudinal study on and after E13. Pallial scar volume
increased from 0.06¡0.01 to 1.18¡0.09 mm3 between E13
and P4, a cumulative growth of 1867%. The scar growth rate
was 0.08 mm3/day, less than 20% of the growth rate in
adjacent, unscarred pallium. Scars were less than 10% of
pallial total volume until P1, with rapid expansion to 17%
on P4.

Quantitative area defects
Pallial area in control mice increased from 3.5¡0.4 to
24.6¡1.4 mm2 between E12 and P4, a measured cumulative
growth of 603% (Figure 1B). Area was reliably correlated
with age (r50.94; df536; Pa
,0.05) with a growth rate of
1.6 mm2/day. The predicted E11 area (2.8 mm2) yielded a
cumulative growth of 779%.
Pallial total area in ablated mice increased from 2.9¡0.3
to 19.3¡2.1 mm2 between E12 and P4, a measured
cumulative growth of 566%. Total area was reliably
correlated with age (r50.92; df538; Pa
,0.05) with a growth
rate of 1.2 mm2/day, 75% of the control value. The predicted
E11 total area (2.8 mm2) yielded a cumulative growth of
589% in ablated mice. At P4, the predicted total area in
ablated mice was 76% of the control value, similar to an
observed reduction to 78% (a 22% growth shortfall).
Pallial unscarred area in ablated mice increased from
2.8¡0.3 to 14.6¡1.8 mm2 between E12 and P4, a measured
cumulative growth of 421%. Unscarred area was reliably
correlated with age (r50.89; df538; Pa
,0.05) with a growth
rate of 0.9 mm2/day, 56% of the control value. The predicted
E11 unscarred area (2.8 mm2) yielded a cumulative growth of
421% in ablated mice. At P4, the predicted unscarred area in
ablated mice was 54% of the control value, which
approximated an observed reduction to 59% (a 41% growth
shortfall).
Pallial scar area increased from 0.1¡0.01 to 4.7¡0.5 mm2
between E13 and P4, an overall measured growth of 4600%.
The scar area growth rate of 0.34 mm2/day was 38% of the
growth rate in adjacent, unscarred pallium. Scars were less
than 20% of the pallial total area in ablated mice until P1,
followed by expansion to 25% on P4.
Quantitative thickness defects
Pallial thickness in control mice increased from 0.20¡0.02 to
1.12¡0.01 mm between E12 and P4, a measured cumulative
growth of 460% (Figure 1C). Thickness was reliably correlated
with age (r50.98; df536; Pa
,0.05) with a growth rate of
0.08 mm/day. The predicted E11 thickness (0.19 mm) yielded a
cumulative growth of 489%.
Pallial thickness in ablated mice increased from 0.19¡0.01
to 0.72¡0.04 mm between E12­P4, a measured cumulative
growth of 279%. Thickness was reliably correlated with age
(r50.94; df538; Pa
,0.05) with a growth rate of 0.04 mm/day,
50% of the control value. The predicted E11 thickness (0.19 mm)
yielded a cumulative growth of 279% in ablated mice. At P4, the
predicted thickness in ablated mice was 57% of the control
value, identical with an observed reduction to 57% (a 43%
growth shortfall).
The thicknesses of scarred and unscarred pallium in ablated
mice were comparable from E11 to P1. Scars thinned to
approx. 75% of values in adjacent, unscarred pallium between
P1 and P4.
Interrelationships of volume, area and thickness
The dependent variables of pallial volume, area and thickness
were measured by different methods, but all three expanded
on the same time course in control and ablated mice, and
demonstrated comparable levels of growth reductions for
Figure 1 Mean volume (A), surface area (at pial interface) (B) and
thickness (C) (X¡S.E.M.) of the dorsal pallium in wild-type (control) and
ablated mice plotted as a function of age from E12 to P4
These results represent the longitudinal time-series study where four
ganciclovir treatments were administered on E11­E12. For ablated mice in
(A) and (B), the upper trends represent X+S.E.M. total (scarred plus unscarred)
volumes and surface areas, whereas the lower trends represent X2S.E.M.
unscarred volumes and surface areas. Shaded areas between upper and lower
trends for ablated mice represent scarred dorsal pallium. Two-way ANOVAs dem-
onstrate the statistical reliability of ablation and age main effects, and the
ablation6age interaction, for overall comparisons between control and
ablated mice during this developmental period on each measure of volume,
surface area and thickness (Pa
,0.01, one-tailed tests). Student's t tests and
non-overlapped X+S.E.M. demonstrate the statistical reliability of differ-
ences between pairwise contrasts of data from individual age groups
(Pa
,0.05, one-tailed tests).

unscarred pallium in ablated mice. Reliable intercorrelations
were observed between the dependent variables, which
indicated their high degree of internal validity between E12
and P4. For pallium in control mice, the values for r50.97
(volume versus area), 0.95 (volume versus thickness) and 0.95
(area versus thickness) (df536; Pa
,0.05). For total pallium in
ablated mice, respective values for r50.98, 0.85 and 0.88
(df538; Pa
,0.05). For unscarred pallium in ablated mice,
respective values for r50.98, 0.82 and 0.83 (df538;
Pa
,0.05). Under the present conditions, each dependent
variable could have served as a useful surrogate for the other
two dependent variables. Within spatial constraints (i.e.
pallium developed as a curved, truncated, conical hemisec-
tion, not a flat, semicircular plate), volume was an
approximate product of surface area and thickness. In
ablated mice, surface area was a better predictor than
thickness of total and unscarred volume, indicative of a slight
dissociation of dependent variables.
Interrelationships of horizontal regionalization and
volume
The pallium of rodents has a lateral-to-medial neurogenetic
gradient of development (Bayer and Altman, 1991). Gradient
influence on the growth of unscarred pallium in ablated mice
was tested by addition of a third independent variable, site
(horizontal regionalization in medial versus lateral divisions)
to the ANOVA linear model, which had main effects of site
(df51124), age (df57124) and ablation (df51124) as well
as interactions of site6age (df57,124), site6ablation
(df51,124), age6ablation (df57,124) and site6age6abla-
tion (df57,124). Results are shown in Figures 2(A) and 2-(B).
Three-way ANOVA revealed the overall statistical significance
of all main effects and interactions on pallial unscarred
volume between E12 and P4 (F53.9­524.7; Pa
,0.01), with
preferential reduction of growth in the medial pallium of
older ablated mice (Figures 3 and 4).
The graphs demonstrated that statistical requirements of
homogeneity of variance and linearity were approximated for
the dependent variable and tested study period. The adjusted,
unbiased R2 coefficient of determination for pallial unscarred
volume in the three-way ANOVA was 0.94, which represented
the total proportion of variance due to the full complement
of main effects and interactions. Relative to the R2 for
unscarred volume in the two-variable linear model (0.79), the
three-variable linear model provided a modest gain in
sufficiency at the cost of inordinate complexity. For the
most part, the simpler two-variable linear model was
adequate for present needs. However, it was interesting to
note that crucial site6ablation and site6age6ablation
interactions of the three-way ANOVA were not statistically
reliable when used to test anterior­posterior neurogenetic
gradients (Figures 2C and 2D; Pa
.0.01), negative results
consistent with a suspected absence of such gradients in the
pallium (Bayer and Altman, 1991).
Physical recognition of growth defects
The occurrence of pallial growth defects in ablated mice was
readily detected in the physical evidence obtained from tissue
sections employed for measurements. Figure 3 is a composite
of serial sections reconstructed from control (wild-type) and
ablated mice from E12­P4, where pallium was designated in
each section. It is notoriously difficult for human observers to
assess numerical magnitudes of volume differences based
solely on visual inspection, but pallial volume in each series
for both groups clearly increased with age. Furthermore,
pallial volume in each series from a control mouse was
greater than the volume from an ablated mouse of the same
age. Finally, pallial surface area and thickness varied in
association with pallial total volume throughout the
composite, so representative observations were congruent
with quantitative measurements. The reconstructions also
indicated that same-age control and ablated mice could not
be reliably distinguished by simple visual comparisons of
volumes occupied by telencephalic hemispheres. Ablated mice
showed no gross microcephaly or microtelencephaly, even
though relative volumes of lateral ventricles increased after
E18 as a sign of progressive hydrocephalus.
Figure 4 is a composite of average surface area measure-
ments reconstructed from control and ablated mice from
E12­P4. Mapped measurements from serial sections were
centred and aligned on the dorsomedial peaks of the pallium.
This protocol did not accurately reflect the posterior
divergence of supratentorial portions of telencephalic vesicles
from the midline (Valverde, 1998), but it better represented
the narrow alignment of scars, when present, between medial
and lateral pallial divisions. Pallial superficial (pial) and deep
(ventricular) areas were aligned and superimposed, with scars
designated in ablated mice. In flat maps, pallial areas
increased with age in both groups, although the extent of
growth was reduced in the ablated group. Once more, graphic
results agreed with quantitative measurements. They clearly
showed the spatial association between scars and the central
region of the pallial VZ in ablated mice, with gross expansion
of the VZ after E18, and scars after P1.
Serial section and flat map reconstructions allowed
judicious selection of representative sections for tests of
additional, perhaps more efficient, measurements. Selection
based on a criterion of maximum section size within each
serial reconstruction supported the measurement of depend-
ent variables for height (dorsal­ventral axis) and width
(medial­lateral axis) of telencephalic vesicles, while the
number of sections in each serial reconstruction allowed
the measurement of a dependent variable for length
(anterior­posterior axis) as the third spatial dimension (results
not shown). Two-way ANOVAs demonstrated the overall
statistical significance of ablation and age main effects, and
the ablation6age interaction, on height, width and length
of telencephalic vesicles between E12 and P4 (F57.6­809.7;
df as in previous two-way ANOVAs; Pa
,0.01). Growth was a
reliable function of age in both groups, but less growth
occurred in ablated mice. However, side-by-side examinations

of superficial aspects of telencephalic vesicles, in whole brains
or serial section reconstructions, presented a paradox because
there were no apparent differences between same-age control
and ablated mice. The relatively small average reductions in
ablated mice (5­10%) accounted for the discrepancy.
Selection based on a criterion of minimum pallial thickness
had photomicrographic results shown in Figures 5(A) and 5(B)
for E14 mice. Pallial areas outlined in control mice were greater
than areas outlined in same-age ablated mice. Pallial lengths at
the pial surfaces in control mice were greater than lengths in
ablated mice. Pallial thicknesses in control mice were greater
than thicknesses in ablated mice. Taken together, these
macroscopic results corresponded to the results of quantitative
measurements. But these specimens also uncovered the
distribution and density of GPT neurons within the pallium,
shown here during their second phase of replacement and
apparent excess density when viewed next to same-age control
tissue. This pallial pattern of replacement GPT neurons
presented a second paradox because, compared with E14 control
mice, the average measured density of GPT neurons/mm3 of
pallium was only 17% greater, and the total complement of
pallial GPT neurons was 57% less, in E14 ablated mice. Large-
scale growth defects and dyslamination accounted for the
discrepancies.
Laminar distribution of vertical growth defects
The vertical organizations of pallial laminae were equivalent in
control and ablated mice. Some laminae were developmentally
transient, and their compositions were transformed with age.
VZ/SVZ was considered to be a unitary neuroepithelial matrix,
where thickness ultimately decreased with age due to
proliferative exhaustion. By E18, a periventricular ependymal
cell layer (post-mitotic) was separated from a paraventricular
SVZ (mitotic) in control and ablated mice. The IZ (intermediate
zone) contained cells migrating towards distal neocortical
destinations throughout the E12­P4 study period. In older
control mice, it also contained commissural (corpus callosum)
and decussated (particularly subcallosal corticostriatal) fibres,
which did not form in the severely ablated mice used for the
Figure 2 Mean volumes of unscarred dorsal pallium (X¡S.E.M.) of the dorsal pallium in wild-type (control) and ablated mice plotted as
a function of site and age from E12 to P4
These results represent the longitudinal time-series study where four ganciclovir treatments were administered on E11­E12. Patterns
of development for unscarred dorsal pallium are compared between the medial (A) versus the lateral (B) dorsal pallium, divided at the
anatomical landmark of its dorsomedial peak. Three-way ANOVA demonstrates the statistical reliability of site, age and ablation main
effects, site6age, site6ablation and age6ablation interactions and the site6age6ablation interaction (Pa
,0.01, one-tailed
tests) for this comparison. Patterns of development for unscarred dorsal pallium are also compared between the anterior (C) versus
the posterior (D) dorsal pallium, divided at the axial midsection of the telencephalic vesicle. Three-way ANOVA fails to demonstrate the
statistical reliability of a site main effect or any of its interactions for this comparison (Pa
.0.01, one-tailed tests). Student's t tests and
non-overlapped X+S.E.M. demonstrate the statistical reliability of differences between pairwise contrasts of data from individual age
groups (Pa
,0.05, one-tailed tests).

longitudinal study. The PP, as defined by settled GPT neurons,
was slowly infiltrated by cortical plate neurons from E13­E15
(Figures 5A and 5B), then persisted mainly as an SP (subplate)
deep to the layer VI fibre band (Altman's channel II) (Bayer and
Altman, 1991). The cortical plate consisted of early­formed
proximal [CP/P (cortical plate/proximal division); infragranular
layers V and VIA] and late-formed distal divisions [CP/D (cortical
plate/distal division); granular and supragranular layers IV­II].
Growth defects of the dependent variable thickness were
detected in all laminae of unscarred pallium in ablated mice

These results represent the longitudinal time-series study where four ganciclovir treatments were administered on E11­E12. Each
reconstruction of regularly spaced and often overlapped serial sections proceeds from rostral to caudal along the neuraxis, with
longitudinal alignment on the dorsomedial peak of the dorsal pallium in each section. Each reconstruction is from a single case that
approximated the average values of pallial volume, surface area and thickness for its ablation and age group. The dorsal pallium is
depicted as solid black in each section. Developmental effects are shown by differences in the vertical sequences, with superimposed
ablation effects shown by differences in horizontal pairs from same-age littermates. Paired reconstructions are arranged as mirror
images to best uncover ablation-associated asymmetry (note the mirrored directional legends for wild-type versus ablated mice).
Growth of the dorsal pallium is associated with age in both control and ablated mice. However, the extent of growth is greater in
control than in ablated mice throughout this developmental sequence. Directional legends: R, rostral; C, caudal; M, medial; L, lateral;
V, ventral; D, dorsal.

Figure 4 Surface area maps (light grey) from serial section reconstructions in the coronal plane of the dorsal pallium in wild-type
(control; left) and ablated (right) mice from E12 (top) to P4 (bottom)
These results represent the longitudinal time-series study where four ganciclovir treatments were administered on E11­E12. Each
serial reconstruction proceeds from rostral to caudal along the neuraxis (rostral vertical scale value50), with longitudinal alignment
on the dorsomedial peak of the pallium in each section (horizontal scale value50). Each reconstruction is a compilation of the
mean¡S.E.M. (X¡S.E.M.) length of the measured surfaces of comparable, axially positioned sections drawn from all cases in each
ablation and age group (three to five mice per group). Representative sections were available in each case for each group at positions
anterior to the level of the dark horizontal line on each map. Surface area maps (dark grey) from the dorsal pallial VZ/SVZ are
similarly generated and aligned. In ablated mice, surface area maps for pallial scars (black) are similarly generated and aligned. In
ablated mice, the total surface area of the dorsal pallium included scarred and unscarred values summed across the sections. The
unscarred surface area of the dorsal pallium excluded the scars from the summation. Developmental effects are shown by differences
in vertical sequences, with superimposed ablation effects shown by differences in horizontal pairs from the same-age control and

in the longitudinal study. Figures 6(A)­6(F) show laminar
thicknesses for unscarred pallium in control and ablated mice.
Two-way ANOVAs demonstrated the overall statistical
significance of ablation and age main effects, and the
ablation6age interaction, on the thickness of each lamina
between E12­P4 (F516.2­388.9; df as in previous two-way
ANOVAs; Pa
,0.01). Thickness increased with age for all
laminae in control and ablated mice except the VZ/SVZ, where
thickness increased then decreased with age due to early
elaboration and subsequent exhaustion of the proliferative
matrix (Figure 6A). Growth of the thickness of all laminae was
progressively reduced in ablated mice. Relative magnitudes of
differences of laminar thickness between control and ablated
mice were always least in the marginal zone, and greatest in
the IZ after E18. Most trends for laminar thickness had
significant departures from the linearity assumption used by
ANOVA models. The model was robust with regard to such
violations, and its results were, for the most part, validated
graphically by reliable differences between same-age control
and ablated mice. Yet, such non-linear trends precluded
comparisons of ANOVA coefficients of determination and
growth rates obtained by linear regression.
Defective laminar growth was associated with increased
cell density in the unscarred pallium of ablated mice. Within
the neocortex proper (PP/SP, CP/P and CP/D), the majority
of the cells were neurons derived from the underlying VZ/SVZ
for the E12­P4 study period. Thus, persistent excess density
reflected defective growth of the neuropil, not the somatic
cellular, tissue compartment. Figures 7(A)­7(F) show laminar
cell densities of unscarred pallium for control and ablated
mice in the longitudinal study. Two-way ANOVAs demon-
strated the overall statistical significance of ablation and age
main effects, and the ablation6age interaction, on laminar
cell densities between E12 and P4 (F515.8­1000.9; df as in
previous two-way ANOVAs; Pa
,0.01). Cell densities were
often U-shaped functions of age in control and ablated mice.
Cell densities in ablated mice attained reliably greater peak
values, followed by slower decreases, than cell densities in
control mice. The sequence of early, nonlinear changes of cell
densities in VZ/SVZ, IZ and PP/SP of ablated mice reflected
early compensatory changes of the proliferative matrix,
which resulted from the generation, then replacement, of
killed GPT cells. Impaired entrance, outgrowth and elabora-
tion of axons and dendrites reduced subsequent growth in
the neuropil compartment of ablated mice, which led to
higher cell densities in its more mature laminar components
and, for the most part, obscured the columnar organization
of sensory neocortex as seen on and after E18 in control mice.
As for laminar thickness, many trends for cell density
departed from the ANOVA assumption of linearity, so
comparisons of ANOVA coefficients of determination and
growth rates from linear regression were not pursued.

Ablation effects are shown by differences between the representative sections, arranged as mirror images to best uncover
asymmetry. In each panel, line C-C9 represents the thickness of dorsal pallium. Line A-A9 represents the surface length (at the pial
interface) used to calculate the surface areas for dorsal pallium from serial section reconstructions. Line B-B9 represents the surface
length (at the lateral ventricular lumen) used to calculate the surface areas for VZ/SVZ of pallium from serial section reconstructions.
Line A-A9-B-B9 represents the perimeter used for planimetric calculation of volumes of pallium from serial section reconstructions. All
of these lengths and areas are greater in the control mouse than in the ablated mouse. The density of GPT neurons in the dorsal pallium
appears to be greater in the ablated mouse than in the control mouse; however, estimates of total frequencies of GPT neurons in the
dorsal pallium as a whole are nearly equivalent in the ablated and control mice. Scale bar, 50 mm.

surface areas of the dorsal pallium and its VZ/SVZ is associated with age in both control and ablated mice. However, the extent of
growth is greater in control than in ablated mice throughout this developmental sequence. Note the central placement of scars at
the dorsomedial peak of the pallium in ablated mice throughout the sequence, and the dramatic expansion of scars after P1.

Longitudinal study of growth reductions in VZ/
SVZ of the dorsal pallium in ablated mice
VZ/SVZ was the main proliferative neuroepitehlial matrix for
the pallium. Pallial defects in ablated mice originated from this
matrix because the ablation was directed against proliferating
GPT neuroblasts that were entirely located therein. This
component also deserved close attention because the vent-
ricular surface area of VZ/SVZ was an important contributor to
measurements of pallial volume. Figures 8(A)-8(C) shows
dependent variables of volume, area (ventricular/deep surface)
and thickness of VZ/SVZ plotted against age groups and
compared between ablation groups for the longitudinal study.

These results represent the longitudinal time-series study where four ganciclovir treatments were administered on E11­E12. Each
lamina has a distinct pattern of development. The break in the trends depicted in (D) represents a shift in the disposition of GPT
neurons from the unilaminar PP stage of neocortex to the trilaminar immature stage of neocortex. Two-way ANOVAs demonstrate
the statistical reliability of ablation and age main effects, and the ablation6age interaction, for overall comparisons of thickness
between control and ablated mice in all laminae for this developmental period (Pa

overlapped X+S.E.M. demonstrate the statistical reliability of differences between pairwise contrasts of data from individual age
groups for each lamina (Pa
,0.05, one-tailed tests). The thickness of VZ/SVZ decreases with age in control and ablated mice due to
exhaustion of the proliferative matrices (A). The thickness of IZ increases with age in control and ablated mice due to the outward
radial migration of newly proliferated neurons into the neocortex followed by the establishment of axonal projections (B). The
thickness of all other laminae increases with age in control and ablated mice due to the migration/settlement of neurons,
establishment of axonal projections/terminal fields and outgrowth of neuronal dendrites/local axons (C­F). With increasing age, the
thickness of all laminae in control mice tends to become greater than that in ablated mice. These differences are least apparent from
E12 to P4 in the marginal zone (C), and most apparent in the late IZ (B). MZ: marginal zone (C); PP/SP: preplate/sublate (D).

Two-way ANOVAs demonstrated the overall statistical
significance of ablation and age main effects, and the
ablation6age interaction, on the volume, area and thickness
of pallial VZ/SVZ between E12 and P4 (F510.3­125.9; df as in
previous two-way ANOVAs; Pa
,0.01), except for the ablation
main effect on VZ/SVZ total area (F50.2; df51,64; Pa
.0.01).
Growth of all dependent variables usually occurred as non-
linear U-shaped functions of age in control and ablated mice,
which reflected the expansion and subsequent exhaustion of
the proliferative matrix, and the migratory exit of newly
generated, non-mitotic neurons. This characterization did not
apply to growth of VZ/SVZ total and unscarred areas in
Figure 7 Corrected mean density (X¡S.E.M.) of cells in the various laminae constituting the unscarred dorsal pallium in wild-type
(control) and ablated mice plotted as a function of age from E12 to P4
These results represent the longitudinal time-series study where four ganciclovir treatments were administered on E11­E12. Each
lamina has a distinct pattern of development. The break in the trends depicted in (D) represents a shift in the disposition of GPT
neurons from the unilaminar PP stage of neocortex to the trilaminar immature stage of neocortex. Two-way ANOVAs demonstrated
the statistical reliability of ablation and age main effects, and the ablation6age interaction, for overall comparisons of cell density
between control and ablated mice in all laminae for this developmental period (Pa

overlapped X+S.E.M. demonstrate the statistical reliability of differences between pairwise contrasts of data from individual age
groups for each lamina (Pa
,0.05, one-tailed tests). The cell density of VZ/SVZ decreases with age in control and ablated mice due to
the exhaustion of the proliferative matrices (A). The cell density of IZ increases and then decreases with age in control and ablated
mice due to the outward radial migration of newly proliferated neurons into the neocortex (B). The cell density of all other laminae
tends to increase and then decrease with age in control and ablated mice due to the early migration and settlement of neurons,
followed by the later expansion of the neuropil and axonal projections. The cell density of all laminae in ablated mice tends to
become greater than in control mice. These differences are least apparent in the marginal zone (C) and are most apparent in the VZ/
SVZ (A) for the entire E12­P4 period of development. MZ, marginal zone (C); PP/SP, preplate/sublate (D).

ablated mice after E18, when progressive hydrocephalus
stretched the ventricular surface (Figure 8B) and destroyed
the ependymal cell layer. Compared with control mice, VZ/
SVZ growth was reliably reduced in ablated mice, and
reductions became progressively more severe with age.
Graphic comparisons between control and ablated mice at
each age level showed reliable differences between groups,
which were usually statistically significant for all three
dependent variables on and after E12. These differences
preceded by one day (24 h) the set of related, reliable
reductions for volume, area and thickness in the pallium as a
whole (Student's t tests; df56­8; Pa
,0.05).
As for comparable dependent variables for the pallium, the
trends for all three dependent variables in the VZ/SVZ in
ablated mice had early deflections that reflected stalled
growth, but not tissue loss, between E11 and E13. Late
deflections also occurred between E15 and E16 for volumes
and surface areas in ablated mice, which might have reflected
a residual defect in the final separation of SVZ from VZ
(Figure 8; Bayer and Altman, 1991). Trends obtained for all
dependent variables in the VZ/SVZ from E12­P4 departed
significantly from the assumption of linearity used by ANOVA
models, so ANOVA coefficients of determination and growth
rates from linear regression were not calculated for the full
study period. However, the assumption of linearity was better
approximated between E12 and E18, the principal period of
proliferation for pallial neurons and the limited age range
employed for further analysis.
Quantitative volume defects in VZ/SVZ
VZ/SVZ volume in control mice increased from 0.28¡0.04
mm3 (X¡S.E.M.) to 1.60¡0.52 mm3 between E12 and E18, a
measured cumulative growth of 471% (calculated from E18-
E12/E12 values; Figure 8A). Volume was reliably correlated
with age (r50.79; df526; Pa
,0.05) with a growth rate of
0.24 mm3/day. The predicted E11 volume (0.18 mm3) yielded
a cumulative growth of 789% (E18­E11/E11 values). VZ/SVZ
total volume in ablated mice increased from 0.20¡0.02 to
0.90¡0.10 mm3 between E12 and E18, a measured cumula-
tive growth of 350%. The total volume was reliably correlated
with age (r50.77; df528; Pa
,0.05) with a growth rate of
0.12 mm3/day, half of the control value. The predicted E11
total volume (0.18 mm3, the predicted E11 control value)
yielded a cumulative growth of 400% in ablated mice. At E18,
the predicted total volume in ablated mice was 51% of the
control value, consistent with an observed reduction to 56%
(i.e. a 44% growth shortfall).
VZ/SVZ unscarred volume in ablated mice increased from
0.20¡0.02 to 0.79¡0.13 mm3 between E12 and E18, a
measured cumulative growth of 295%. Unscarred volume was
reliably correlated with age (r50.73; df528; Pa
,0.05) with a
growth rate of 0.10 mm3/day, less than half of the control
value. The predicted E11 unscarred volume (0.18 mm3)
yielded a cumulative growth of 339% in ablated mice. At E18,
the predicted unscarred volume in ablated mice was 43%
of the control value, nearly identical with an observed
reduction to 44% (a 56% growth shortfall).

and thickness (C) (X¡S.E.M.) of the VZ/SVZ of the dorsal pallium in wild-
type (control) and ablated mice plotted as a function of age from E12 to
P4
These results represent the longitudinal time-series study where four
ganciclovir treatments were administered on E11­E12. For ablated mice in
(A) and (B), the upper trends represent X+S.E.M. total (scarred plus unscarred)
volumes and surface areas, whereas the lower trends represent X2S.E.M.
unscarred volumes and surface areas. Shaded areas between upper and lower
trends for ablated mice represent scarred VZ/SVZ in the dorsal pallium. Two-
way ANOVAs demonstrate the statistical reliability of ablation and age main
effects, and the ablation6age interaction, for most overall comparisons
between control and ablated mice during this developmental period on each
measure of volume, surface area and thickness (Pa
,0.01, one-tailed tests).
The assumption of linearity was met from E12 to E18, corresponding to the
activity of the proliferative matrix, but was not fulfilled for the entire period.
Student's t tests and non-overlapped X+S.E.M. demonstrate the statistical
reliability of differences between pairwise contrasts of data from individual
age groups (Pa
,0.05, one-tailed tests).

VZ/SVZ scars were observed on and after E13 in all ablated,
and no control, mice in the longitudinal study. Scar volume
increased from 0.02¡0.01 to 0.11¡0.02 mm3 from E13­P1,
a cumulative growth of 450%. The scar volume growth rate
of 0.01 mm3/day was less than 10% of the growth rate for
adjacent, unscarred VZ/SVZ. Scars were less than 10% of VZ/
SVZ volume throughout the full E12­P4 study period.
Quantitative area defects in VZ/SVZ
VZ/SVZ area in control mice increased from 1.90¡0.20 to
3.30¡0.36 mm2 between E12 and E18, a measured
cumulative growth of 73% (Figure 8B). Area was reliably
correlated with age (r50.56; df526; Pa
,0.05) with a growth
rate of 0.30 mm2/day. The predicted E11 area (1.36 mm2)
yielded a cumulative growth of 142%.
Figure 9 Mean volume (A, B), surface area (at the pial interface and lateral ventricular lumen respectively; C, D) and thickness (E, F;
X¡S.E.M.) of the dorsal pallium (A, C, E) and the VZ/SVZ of the dorsal pallium (B, D, F) in wild-type (control) and ablated mice
plotted for various ablation groups terminated on E18
These results represent the cross-sectional study where genotypes, ages at ganciclovir treatment, frequency of ganciclovir treatments
and calculated percentage extent of GPT cell loss are displayed on the x-axis. For ablated mice (A­D), the upper bar limits represent
X+S.E.M. total (scarred plus unscarred) volumes and surface areas, whereas the lower bar limits represent X2S.E.M. unscarred
volumes and surface areas respectively. Shaded areas between upper and lower bar limits for ablated mice represent scarred dorsal
pallium or its scarred VZ/SVZ. One-way ANOVAs demonstrate the statistical reliability of the ablation effect for overall comparisons
of each measure of volume, area and thickness between control and ablated mice at this developmental benchmark (Pa
,0.01, one-
tailed test). White bars represent the `control' cluster of groups [wild-type (WT) controls], black bars represent the `mild ablation'
cluster of groups and grey bars represent the `severe ablation' cluster of groups. One-way ANOVAs demonstrated
the statistical reliability of most differences between these clusters on the various measures (see the Results section for
exceptions; Pa
,0.01, one-tailed tests). The control cluster typically had greater values than the mild and severe ablation clusters. The
mild ablation cluster typically had greater values than the severe ablation cluster. Student's t tests and non-overlapped X+S.E.M.
demonstrate the statistical reliability of differences between pairwise contrasts of grouped data (Pa
,0.05, one-tailed tests).

VZ/SVZ total area in ablated mice increased from
1.40¡0.20 to 2.76¡0.26 mm2 between E12­E18, a cumu-
lative growth of 97%. Total area was reliably correlated with
age (r50.71; df528; Pa
,0.05) with a growth rate of 0.28
mm2/day, slightly less than the control value. The predicted
E11 total area (1.36 mm2) yielded a cumulative growth of
102% in ablated mice. At E18, the predicted total area in
ablated mice was 72% of the control value, slightly less than
an observed reduction to 82% (an 18% growth shortfall,
considerably reduced by the initiation of hydrocephalic
expansion).
The VZ/SVZ unscarred area in ablated mice increased from
1.36¡0.26 to 2.16¡0.36 mm2 between E12 and E18, a
cumulative growth of 59%. Unscarred area was reliably
correlated with age (r50.53; df528; Pa
,0.05) with a growth
rate of 0.16 mm2/day, less than 60% of the control value. The
predicted E11 unscarred area (1.36 mm2) yielded a cumulative
growth of 59% in ablated mice. At E18, the predicted
unscarred area in ablated mice was 41% of the control value,
considerably less than an observed reduction to 66% (a 34%
growth shortfall, modestly reduced by the initiation of
hydrocephalic expansion).
Figure 10 Surface area maps (light grey) from serial section reconstructions in the coronal plane of the dorsal pallium in wild-type
(control; left) and ablated (right) mice plotted for various ablation groups terminated on E18
These results represent the cross-sectional study. Each serial reconstruction is produced as in Figure 4, and proceeds from rostral to
caudal along the neuraxis (rostral vertical scale value50), with longitudinal alignment on the dorsomedial peak of the pallium in
each section (horizontal scale value50). Each reconstruction is a compilation of the mean¡S.E.M. (X¡S.E.M.) length of the
measured surfaces of comparable, axially positioned sections drawn from all cases in each ablation and age group (3­10 mice per
group). Representative sections were available in each case for each group at positions anterior to the level of the dark horizontal
line on each map. Surface area maps (dark grey) from the dorsal pallial VZ/SVZ are similarly generated and aligned. In ablated mice,
surface area maps for pallial scars (black) are similarly generated and aligned. In ablated mice, the total surface area of dorsal
pallium included scarred and unscarred values summed across the sections. The unscarred surface area of the dorsal pallium
excluded the scars from the summation. Developmental effects are shown by differences in vertical sequences, with superimposed
ablation effects shown by differences in horizontal pairs from same-age control and ablated groups. Paired reconstructions are
arranged as mirror images to best uncover ablation-associated asymmetry. The ablated groups tend to have smaller surface areas
when compared with the control group. Groups in the severe ablation cluster (right-hand side maps) tend to have smaller surface
areas when compared with mice in the mild ablation and control clusters (left-hand side maps).

Scar area increased from 0.10¡0.02 to 0.60¡0.10 mm2
between E13 and E18, a cumulative growth of 500%. The scar
area growth rate of 0.07 mm2/day was less than 44% of the
growth rate for adjacent, unscarred VZ/SVZ. Scars were less
than 22% of VZ/SVZ total area in ablated mice until P1,
followed by expansion to 33% on P4.
Quantitative thickness defects in the VZ/SVZ
VZ/SVZ thickness in control mice increased from
0.123¡0.007 to 0.189¡0.005 mm between E12 and E18, a
cumulative growth of 54% (Figure 8C). Thickness was reliably
correlated with age (r50.77; df526; Pa
,0.05) with a growth
rate of 0.009 mm/day. The predicted E11 thickness (0.110 mm)
yielded a cumulative growth of 72%.
VZ/SVZ thickness in ablated mice increased from
0.110¡0.003 to 0.152¡0.006 mm between E12 and E18, a
cumulative growth of 38%. Thickness was reliably correlated
with age (r50.61; df528; Pa
,0.05) with a growth rate of
0.006 mm/day, less than 66% of the control value. The
predicted E11 thickness (0.110 mm) yielded a cumulative
growth of 38% in ablated mice. At E18, the predicted
thickness in ablated mice was 63% of the control value,
somewhat less than an observed reduction to 80% (a 20%
growth shortfall).
Interrelationships of volume, area and thickness in VZ/SVZ
VZ/SVZ volume, area and thickness had reliable intercorrela-
tions between the dependent variables, which demonstrated
their substantial internal validity from E12 to E18. For VZ/SVZ
in control mice, the values for r50.79 (volume versus area),
0.71 (volume versus thickness) and 0.55 (area versus
thickness; df526; Pa
,0.05). For total VZ/SVZ in ablated
mice, the respective values for r50.86, 0.62 and 0.49 (df528;
Pa
,0.05). For unscarred VZ/SVZ in ablated mice, the
respective values for r50.49, 0.75 and 0.59 (df528;
Pa
,0.05). For each pair of dependent variables, intercorrela-
tions were less for VZ/SVZ than for whole pallium, whether
considered for E12­E18 or E12­P4 periods.
Interrelationships between growth in VZ/SVZ and pallium
Reliable intercorrelations were observed between related
dependent variables for the VZ/SVZ and pallium during the
E12­E18 period. VZ/SVZ and pallium volumes were reliably
correlated in control mice (r50.96; df526), VZ/SVZ and
pallium total volumes were reliably correlated in ablated mice
(r50.92; df528), and VZ/SVZ and pallium unscarred volumes
were reliably correlated in ablated mice (r50.89; df528;
Pa
,0.05). Similar results were obtained for VZ/SVZ area and
thickness despite their weaker correlations with age.
Respectively comparable values for areas were r50.80
(df526; control areas); r50.92 (df528; ablated total areas);
and r50.89 (df528; ablated unscarred areas; Pa
,0.05).
Finally, VZ/SVZ and pallium thicknesses were reliably
correlated in control mice (r50.81; df526) and in ablated
mice (r50.73; df528; Pa
,0.05). Between E12 and E18 in
control and ablated mice, the pallium and its VZ/SVZ
accumulated the proliferative output of VZ/SVZ from the
preceding day of maturation, which accounted for their
comparable and coincidental relative growth.
VZ/SVZ was the predominant component of pallium during
the early study period, but was reduced to a minor
contribution near its end. VZ/SVZ typically retained its
proportional developmental relationships with pallium
despite ablation. At E12 in control mice, the average VZ/
SVZ volume was 61% of the average pallial volume and
decreased to 7% by P4. At E12 in ablated mice, volumes for
total and unscarred VZ/SVZ were 56% of volumes of total and
unscarred pallium and decreased to 5% at P4. At E12 in
control mice, VZ/SVZ area was 54% of pallial area and
decreased to 13% at P4. At E12 in ablated mice, areas for
total and unscarred VZ/SVZ were 48 and 50% respectively of
areas for total and unscarred pallium, decreased with age
until after E18 and then expanded by progressive hydro-
cephalus to 46 and 41% at P4. At E12 in control mice, VZ/SVZ
thickness was 60% of pallial thickness and decreased to 7%
by P4. At E12 in ablated mice, VZ/SVZ thickness was 58% of
pallial thickness and decreased to 6% at P4.
Cross-sectional study of growth reduction in
dorsal pallium and VZ/SVZ of ablated mice
The final opportunity to observe the developmental effects
of the ablation of GPT neurons on growth, unalloyed by
myelination and hydrocephalus, occurred on E18 after all
ablated mice in the various ganciclovir treatment groups
entered the third phase of secondary, late-onset apoptosis.
Mice in the control group had significantly greater volume,
area and thickness of both pallium and VZ/SVZ than mice
pooled across ablation groups, regardless of the presence or
absence of scars (Figure 9; Student's t tests; df535;
Pa
,0.05). Thus all effective genetically targeted ablations
of GPT neurons had a persistent, negative impact on pallial
growth, as in the longitudinal study. However, experimental
mice with ganciclovir treatments on E14, E15 and E17 had
ineffective (i.e. no) ablations. Their values were closely
comparable with those of the control group on all measures,
so they were excluded from further analysis.
The ablation phenotype was predicated on the specific
killing of GPT cells, which was now shifted explicitly to the
status of a ratio scale-independent variable in order to assess
its association with downstream indicators of physical growth
(dependent variables of volume, area and thickness of the
pallium and its VZ/SVZ). When cases were grouped on the basis
of derived percentage reductions of GPT neurons (i.e. the
original, total complement of GPT neurons normally generated
on E11­E13), one-way ANOVAs demonstrated that the
quantified ablation effect still had a reliable, negative, overall
impact on the E18 values attained by all dependent variables
(F55.68­26.72; df57,29; Pa
,0.01) except the total VZ/SVZ

surface area (F53.16; df57,29; Pa
.0.01). The overall ablation
effect was sufficiently robust to permit linear regression
between the treatment groups, including the zero baseline
value of the control group. Derived percentage reductions of
GPT neurons were reliably but negatively correlated with the
values attained by all dependent variables (i.e. less reduction
produced more growth; for volume, area and thickness for
pallium and VZ/SVZ, the range of values for r was 20.35 to
20.84; df535; Pa
,0.05). The overall dose­response relation-
ships between the magnitudes of ablations and subsequent
cumulative growth generated correlations that accounted for
substantial portions of variance obtained for all pallial and VZ/
SVZ dependent variables (the range of values for r2 was 0.43­
0.71) except for VZ/SVZ total area (r250.13).
Unlike the E11­E13 stage of GPT cell killing by ganciclovir
treatment, this later dose­response relationship had addi-
tional constraints as shown in Figure 9. By E18, similar
outcomes in different treatment groups formed three natural,
step-like clusters for all dependent variables: a `control'
cluster (composed of the wild-type control group) with the
largest values, a `mild ablation' cluster (composed of
experimental groups with single ganciclovir treatments on
E11 and E12, one ganciclovir treatment on E11 and two
ganciclovir treatments on E13) with intermediate values, and
a `severe ablation' cluster (composed of experimental groups
with four ganciclovir treatments on E11­E12, three ganci-
clovir treatments on E11­E12, two ganciclovir treatments on
E12 and two ganciclovir treatments on E11) with the least
values. One-way ANOVAs revealed a reliable ablation effect
between the three clusters for all dependent variables in
pallium and VZ/SVZ (F510.19­69.66; df52,34; Pa
,0.01).
Also, statistically reliable differences were obtained in
contrasts between the control and severe ablation clusters,
the control and mild ablation clusters, and the mild and
severe ablation clusters for all dependent variables (Student's
t tests; df524, 19 and 25 respectively; Pa
,0.05), except for
the contrast of mild and severe ablation clusters for VZ/SVZ
total surface area (Pa
.0.05). However, unreliable or marginal
differences were obtained from between-group contrasts
within the severe and mild ablation clusters (Pa
.0.05). As
expected, the stochastic cluster arrangement indicated that
genetically targeted ablations were, in fact, serial lesions,
where the timing and sequence of the specific killing of GPT
cells, as well as the intervening percentage reduction of
GPT neurons, influenced downstream growth. This was
particularly evident in the ablation group with ganciclovir
intertreament intervals greater than 24 h on E11­E12, where
a severe ablation of GPT neurons (41% reduction) produced
mild growth defects.
The ordered relationships between ablation groups and
growth reductions in pallium observed at E18 were also
demonstrated in anatomical maps. Selected because it
addresses directly the issue of horizontal growth defects,
Figure 10 shows the averaged, flat-mapped surface areas
of the pallium, its VZ/SVZ and, when present, its scars, for the
groups studied at E18. Compared with the control group,
the mild ablation groups had modest and comparable
reductions in pallial and VZ/SVZ areas. The severe ablation
groups had greater reductions than both the control and mild
ablation groups. Scars were also more common and extensive
in severe ablation groups, with large scars found in
association with large ablations.
DISCUSSION
The present study centres on an anatomical entity, the dorsal
pallium, defined first and foremost by a neurochemical
property, the localization of GPT-expressing cells (GPT
neuroblasts and neurons). GPT is unusual for its early and
continued expression during cell lineage progression from
neuroblast to neuron stages (and its absence in other
preceding or concurrent precursors invulnerable to the
present genetically targeted ablation), as well as its wide
horizontal extent in the pallial proliferative matrix (Osheroff
and Hatten, 2009; Xie et al., 2009). It provides a novel,
modern view of one of the largest structural components in
mammalian brain consistent with the organizational scheme
of Marin-Padilla (1971, 1998). Evidence based on this
molecular marker characterizes the most dynamic phase of
pallial morphogenesis in mice, but may not be strictly
comparable with earlier reports based on different criteria for
anatomical boundaries. Nevertheless, measurements of
length, width and height of telencephalic vesicles in control
mice match corresponding values from same-age examples of
normal fetal mice shown by Kaufman (1992). External
validation of these measurements for P4 control mice also
occurs in Valverde's (1998) masterful Golgi study of P5­P7
mice. Our values are 10% less than those of Valverde, with
such slight differences most probably due to the effects of
cryoprotection, fixation and age. Since the new measure-
ments of the pallial volume are reasonably accurate, revised
estimates of full, hemispheric complements of 2.56105
dorsal pallial GPT neurons in control mice and 2.36105 dorsal
pallial GPT neurons in severely ablated mice are calculated
from peak developmental densities of viable GPT neurons
normalized for pallial volume, with the difference due to the
lost proliferative output of VZ scars (Xie et al., 2009).
Genetically targeted ablation of GPT cells persistently
eliminates up to 81% of the original complement of GPT
neurons. The subsequent, comparable peak values dem-
onstrate a near-normal restoration of GPT neurons tightly
packed into an unscarred pallium of reduced size in ablated
mice. The ablation is remarkable because the targeted cell
population is transiently reduced, but not permanently
suppressed.
The evidence obtained by the present study proves beyond
reasonable doubt that genetically targeted ablation of GPT
cells results in progressive and substantial reductions of
pallial growth in prenatal mice, despite compensatory

responses that rapidly replace the ablated cells (Xie et al.,
2009). Furthermore, these growth defects originate from
the proliferative matrix of the pallial VZ, in accord with the
rationale of the mechanism of action of the genetically
targeted ablation (Xie et al., 2002, 2009). Finally, these growth
defects accumulate during prenatal and postnatal development
in a constrained dose­response relationship with the extent of
specific killing of GPT neurons, concordant with the
purported specificity of action of the genetically targeted
ablation (Xie et al., 2002, 2009). GPT neurons are, in fact, the
principal PP neurons, and developmental delays caused by
their early, specific killing and regeneration trigger a cascade
of subsequent defects in PP, immature and mature stages of
neocortex, the main derivative of the proliferative matrix
of the pallial VZ (Bayer and Altman, 1991). These defects
uncover biologically significant aspects of neocortical
morphogenesis (determinants of organic growth and form)
that are often neglected or inadequately characterized
(Jacobson, 1970; Price and Willshaw, 2000).
The hypothesis that the ablation of GPT cells impairs
vertical, but not horizontal, growth within the pallium and its
neocortical part must be rejected. The evidence obtained by
this investigation proves beyond reasonable doubt that
growth falters in the horizontal surface area at both the
pial and ventricular borders (as well as in the vertical
thickness) of the pallium in ablated mice. Simultaneous
growth defects in both the horizontal and vertical cytoarch-
itectural dimensions combine to produce a localized shortfall
of dorsal pallial volume in the telencephalic vesicles. These
findings expand and explain ambiguous, less detailed signs of
impaired forebrain growth reported after ablation of GPT
cells (Xie et al., 2002, 2009) and ablation of PP neurons,
purportedly with spared progenitors (Ghosh and Shatz, 1993).
Three aspects of the present study are unusual and merit
further attention.
Detection of organic growth defects after
genetically targeted ablation
Modern combinations of molecular biology and neurochem-
istry such as genetically targeted ablation can provide a
genuine experimental `dissection' of embryological develop-
ment through the selective elimination or enhancement of its
cellular elements (Xie et al., 2002; Jacobs et al., 2009). These
experiments are predicated on the subsequent, accurate
recognition of alterations in phenotype. In practice, large-
scale organic differences in structural phenotype can be
difficult to identify and thus may be overlooked even by
experienced investigators. As shown here, cursory examina-
tion is inadequate if it leads to paradoxical and potentially
misleading results. We resort to antique, but not antiquated,
methods of macroscopic morphometry from haematoxylin-
counterstained serial section reconstructions to solve this
problem by detection of pallial growth defects, and their
place within a developing organic context, in ablated mice.
Serial section reconstructions at appropriate low magnifi-
cations allow all aspects of an organ to be viewed
simultaneously and as a whole. Structural differences greater
than 20­25% are usually needed for immediate recognition
of revised phenotype. Instead, barely perceptible growth
defects of less than 10% are evenly distributed across all
three spatial dimensions of the ablated telencephalic vesicle.
Such a widespread distribution of defects sustains the
co-ordination of telencephalic and neurocranial growth, a
pivotal outcome for successful prenatal development and live
birth of ablated mice. Nevertheless, mapping and measure-
ment reveal more substantial differences limited to the dorsal
pallial part of the telencephalic vesicle. The volume, area and
thickness of control pallium have distinct growth rates
and levels of cumulative physical growth due to the different
spatial dimensions that contribute to each dependent
variable. These indices retain distinct, but suppressed, growth
rates and levels of cumulative physical growth in ablated
unscarred pallium. All three dependent variables have
comparable growth defects relative to their physical
magnitude despite measurement by independent means.
This normalization for spatial dimensional scaling uncovers
a common shortfall of growth, approx. 50% of its potential in
control pallium, which propagates simultaneously as hori-
zontal and vertical defects in ablated pallium, as shown by
high intercorrelations of its volume, area and thickness.
In control mice, short-lived GPT intermediate progenitor
cells in the pallial VZ are the exclusive source of its GPT
neurons (Landry et al., 1998; Xie et al., 2002, 2009; Jacobs
et al., 2007). Between E11 and E13, these cells migrate
radially in an `outside-in' pattern and settle as the principal
constituent neurons of PP neocortex. Between E13 and E15,
they are infiltrated and dispersed by proximal, inverted
settlement of early cortical plate neurons (destined for layers
V and VI) to form trilaminar immature neocortex. By E16,
physical separation of principal PP neurons settled in
marginal zone versus cortical plate (i.e. true cleavage)
proceeds with distal, inverted settlement of cortical plate
neurons (destined for layers II­IV) to form hexalaminar
mature neocortex (Bayer and Altman, 1990, 1991). In ablated
mice, cellular lamination is normally ordered in PP, immature
and mature stages of neocortex. Dyslamination consists of
horizontal and vertical growth defects distributed across all
laminae, which are characteristically thin, densely cellular and
obscurely bordered by projection axons and afferent terminal
fields. The delayed settlement and tight packing of a near-
normal complement of GPT neurons into this smaller ablated
neocortex merely emphasize the presence of the middle
lamina of principal PP neurons as usually found during its
immature stage (Luskin and Shatz, 1985; Xie et al., 2009).
Similar growth defects, with thin lamination and tight cell
packing, are also distributed across the subcortical laminae of
pallium.
Growth defects in the pallial VZ precede and are highly
intercorrelated with subsequent growth defects in more distal
pallial laminae. During the first phase of ablation, VZ growth

stalls due to ganciclovir-induced cell killing, which evokes a
profound structural reorganization of new GPT cells and
mitotic precursors in pallial VZ. As dying cells down-size the
original periventricular mitotic array, newly generated
mitotic cells reconstitute as a paraventricular mitotic array
(e.g. a thickened, porous plate akin to later-formed SVZ;
Smart, 1973; Noctor et al., 2001; Xie et al., 2009). Despite its
horizontal and vertical compaction, the reconstituted matrix
increases cell density in the VZ, with a concomitant increase
in proliferative output sufficient to compensate for killed GPT
cells during the second phase of the ablation. The
reconstituted matrix maintains the normal sequence of
generation for PP, proximal and distal cortical plate neurons,
and replenishes by de novo proliferation the normal
complement of GPT neurons. The compensatory response is
necessary for the resumption of pallial growth, which
indicates that principal PP neurons are essential building
blocks for the physical foundation of the neocortical
assembly (Ghosh and Shatz, 1993). The subsequent cost of
growth reduction indicates that the VZ proliferative matrix
encodes, at least in part, the physical dimensions of the
pallium (Rakic, 2005). The original VZ template is reduced by
specific cell killing in ablated mice. The `gathering up' of
the reconstituted matrix limits the outward spread of the
regenerated VZ template, diminishes the mobility of precursor
and progenitor cells within it and translates into a horizontal
growth defect in the somatic compartment of its neocortical
derivatives (Walsh and Cepko, 1993). Concurrent destruction
of radial fibres contributes to horizontal and vertical growth
defects in the somatic and neuropil tissue compartments.
Dying GPT neuroblasts lose their radial fibres. RC2-immuno-
reactive radial fibres, believed to originate from neuronal
precursors but not intermediate progenitors at this stage of
development (Misson et al., 1988; Hasling et al., 2003;
Molyneaux et al., 2007), are then grossly reduced as
ganciclovir-invulnerable, non-GPT-expressing precursors are
recruited toward production of GPT neuroblasts. The
decimation and disarray of the radial fibre network impair
the distal disaggregation of settling neurons and reduce their
migratory trajectory, but do not block radial migration or
alter the normal settlement sequences of PP and cortical
plate neurons.
Interaction of development and genetically
targeted ablation in growth defects
If the only effect of genetically targeted ablation is
permanent elimination of principal PP neurons, then pallial
growth defects at P4 should be negligible because principal
PP neurons normally account for only 1­2% of neocortical
neurons at that age. Instead, the pattern of substantial,
progressive reduction of growth in the ablated pallium
indicates that the initial defect introduced by the specific
killing of GPT cells is amplified by subsequent, faulty cellular
interactions. Large-scale biological processes such as assem-
bly of mammalian neocortex are obviously the developmental
product of many concerted factors (Waddington, 1956; Debat
and David, 2001). We use a composite ablation6age
interaction in a robust, two-factor statistical model to
represent their cumulative effect. However, a stereotyped
sequence of faulty, interrelated cellular interactions, where
each step contributes to the composite interaction, is also
beginning to emerge. The natural occurrence of both the
composite interaction and the sequence of its component
cellular interactions is best observed during the in situ
development of whole brain, since many of the component
cellular interactions may be unavailable or inoperative in
more restricted cell and tissue models.
As outlined above, specific killing of GPT cells produces
only a few immediate changes, which occur mainly in pallial
VZ. Excess dying GPT cells are temporarily stranded there, and
their radial fibres are destroyed. These abnormal circum-
stances down-size and decelerate horizontal and vertical pallial
growth within somatic and neuropil tissue compartments.
Of greater importance, they also initiate a maturational delay
for the settlement of principal PP neurons and introduce
a morphogenetic discontinuity into the radial fibre network.
Their destructive impact persists in the statistical model as the
ablation main effect, which subtracts across age groups from
constructive development normally represented by the age
main effect.
The ablation main effect triggers subsequent defects of
inductive, morphogenic and tropic cellular interactions
(Edelman, 1988), which join the composite ablation6age
interaction that increasingly subtracts between age groups
from the age main effect. The earliest fault in the sequence is
the distortion of a close-proximity, inductive interaction
between dying GPT cells and non-GPT precursors in the VZ,
which accelerates and prolongs precursor differentiation
toward an intermediate progenitor, replacement GPT neuro-
blasts. This compensatory recruitment is accompanied by
faulty morphogenic interactions that reconstitute the VZ
proliferative array and further disrupt the radial fibre
network (Xie et al., 2002, 2009). Reduction of horizontal
and vertical growth arises from the restriction of the
replacement VZ template, and the constriction of its physical
translation into neocortex, as mediated by replacement PP
neurons. The onset of these faults, and the ablation main
effect, coincide with and are reflected by the early E12­E13
growth deflection.
A faulty morphogenic interaction next takes place, most
likely between the degenerated radial fibre network and the
delayed replacement GPT neurons, which then fail to emit
long projection axons (Xie et al., 2009). These pioneer axons
normally guide neocortical penetration of long afferent,
particularly thalamocortical, axons (Molnar and Blakemore,
1995; Molnar et al., 1998; Hevner et al., 2002; Jacobs et al.,
2007). In their absence, thalamocortical projections, most
notably `specific' thalamic relay connections for sensory
systems, do not penetrate neocortical targets in an orderly
fashion to elaborate characteristic terminal fields, usually
initiated in immature neocortex (Auladell et al., 2000;

Lopez-Bendito and Molnar, 2003). The onset of this defect
coincides with and is reflected by the late E15­E16 growth
deflection. The defect also extends to include associational
and commissural corticocortical projections. Reduction of
horizontal and vertical growth arises from the decreased
frequency of axons in the neuropil tissue compartment and
fibre tracts.
A faulty trophic interaction then occurs between the
impoverished terminal fields of long axonal projections and
neurons in mature neocortex, which curtail the outgrowth
and branching of their dendrites and local axonal collaterals
(Adams et al., 1997; Xie et al., 2009). Reduction of horizontal
and vertical growth arises from the decreased frequency of
neuronal processes in the neuropil tissue compartment. A
final faulty trophic interaction proceeds between the
inadequate synaptic connectivity conveyed by axons (afferent
projection and local fibers) and neocortical neurons, which
accelerates the pace of neuronal apoptosis and reduces
growth in the somatic and neuropil tissue compartments
during the third phase of the ablation (Cowan et al., 1984; Xie
et al., 2002, 2009). It is interesting to note that this phase is
accompanied by gross neuronal degeneration in subcortical
sites, such as claustrum, normally predominated by reciprocal
connections with neocortex.
This is not a full and exhaustive account of all abnormal
cellular interactions that can take place in the ablated
pallium, where the normal pattern of gradual, smooth and
linear physical growth is largely maintained but progressively
decelerated. In normal forebrain, such extensive, sequential
interactions may buffer, regulate and synchronize develop-
ment. In ablated forebrain, sequential cellular interactions
underlie a constructive compensation that sustains pallial
development, but sets in motion destructive consequences
that limit its long-term success. In any event, the pathogenic
amplification achieved by composite interaction shows that
even modest delays of 24­48 h in the settlement of principal
PP neurons can lead to many, if not all, of the same
devastating structural defects claimed to be due to their
selective, permanent elimination (Ghosh and Shatz, 1993).
Persistence of growth defects after genetically
targeted ablation
Specifically killed GPT cells are clearly the nexus and
intervening variable between experimental conditions (geno-
type, ganciclovir treatment and age at ganciclovir treatment)
that cause genetically targeted ablation and its long-term
phenotypic expression (Xie et al., 2002, 2009). We delineate a
previously uncharted, immediate dose­response relationship
between the ablation conditions and killed GPT neurons.
Contingent on this outcome, a subsequent dose­response
relationship unfolds between killed GPT neurons and
persistent pallial growth defects. Both dose­response rela-
tionships are important demonstrations of the specificity of
the genetically targeted ablation. However, the second
relationship is technically constrained in at least three
respects.
First, values for the independent variable, killed GPT
neurons, are derived as a constant for each ablation group,
not measured for each case within a group (although such
observations prove to be feasible, and consistent with derived
predicted values). In view of this limitation, all between-case,
within-group variance of dependent variables is currently
included in statistical error terms. This conservative solution
underestimates the variance that should properly be
attributed to killed GPT neurons. It also precludes multiple
regression and factor analyses.
Secondly, the trigger episodes for the killing of GPT
neurons are superimposed on normal morphogenetic pro-
cesses, which require time to marshal the combination of
constructive and destructive recovery mechanisms that lead
to continued development and persistent, progressive growth
defects. Extension of the post-ablation survival period allows
the amplification of growth defects through sequential
developmental interactions, but their increasing complexity
tends to dilute the dose­response relationship between killed
GPT neurons and growth defects. The step-like, stochastic
clustering of outcomes for ablation groups with different
levels of killed GPT cells suggests that some faulty cellular
interactions do not contribute significantly to growth defects
unless a minimum level of prior damage is attained (e.g. a
threshold effect), while some faulty cellular interactions fail
completely if a minimum level of prior damage is surpassed
(e.g. a ceiling effect). Thus it is reasonable to propose that the
`severe ablation' cluster represents the full expression of
the true ablation phenotype, while the `mild ablation' cluster
represents an intermediate version of the same ablation
phenotype.
Thirdly, the genetically targeted ablation used in our
longitudinal studies is actually a serial lesion of GPT cells
related to each ganciclovir treatment, which further
contributes to the clustered outcomes of different ablation
groups (Finger et al., 1973). The sequence and timing of
episodic killing of GPT neurons recruit distinct levels of de-
fective interactions. GPT intermediate progenitors have a
short cell cycle of approx. 10 h and generate six to seven
cohorts of GPT neurons over a period of approx. 72 h (Xie
et al., 2009). Killing of two or more consecutive, early cohorts
of GPT neurons (36­81% losses of original complement), with
minimum delays of 24 h for settlement of replacements, yields
the catastrophic outcome of groups in the severe ablation
cluster. In contrast, killing of a single early cohort of
GPT neurons (18% loss) or two non-consecutive cohorts
of GPT neurons (41% loss), with a minimum delay of 12 h for
settlement of replacements, yields the survivable outcome of
groups in the mild ablation cluster. Groups in the severe
ablation cluster have impaired pioneer axons and afferent
projections, which appear to be largely intact in groups in the
mild ablation cluster. This difference suggests that cellular
interactions underlying the outgrowth of sufficient pioneer
axons for afferent guidance can tolerate short, but not long,

delays of settlement of replacement GPT neurons, which
constitute the permissive benefit actually obtained from the
plasticity of precursors in the ablated VZ. The killing of two
consecutive, late cohorts of GPT neurons on E13 (9% loss)
leads to a mild ablation outcome because cellular interactions
underlying the outgrowth of sufficient pioneer axons occur
mostly before the cells are attacked.
We focus on the unscarred pallium of ablated mice because
it retains sufficient structural integrity to preserve at least
some functional role in neural processing and transmission.
Yet, the pallium of severely ablated mice often has a second
structural component composed of scar tissue. As shown
previously (Xie et al., 2009) and now in extensive maps of the
ablated neocortical surface, these scars arise as a product of
non-specific bystander killing related to the early, avascular
arrangement of a limited site marking the pallial boundaries
of distribution for the anterior and middle cerebral arteries
(Marin-Padilla, 1985). Scars, when present, do not alter the
conclusions of the present study, since measurements based
on total pallium (scarred plus unscarred tissue) and unscarred
pallium yield consistent and comparable results. However,
scars exhibit a low level of growth distinct from adjacent
unscarred tissue. They fill a benign but non-essential gap in
the development of ablated pallium until the late advent of
hydrocephalus, after which the cellular fabric of both scarred
and unscarred tissue is so compromised as to be unable to
resist extreme thinning and ultimately fatal disruption (Xie
et al., 2002).
Taken together, the new evidence shows that genetically
targeted ablations of the principal PP neurons can cost up to
half of the growth potential of the dorsal pallium in mice, a
species with modest neocortical evolution. It is certain that
such losses produce significant functional impairments
consistent with the principle of mass action and the high
degree of cytoarchitectural organization normally achieved in
neocortex (Lashley, 1929; Jones, 1988). The apparent absence
of neurological seizures is not surprising due to the global
distribution, symmetric localization and insular nature of
impoverished synaptic connectivity in the ablated neocortical
phenotype (Cepeda et al., 2010). Because of the extensive
evolutionary elaboration of neocortex, a structural loss in
humans comparable with the severe ablation phenotype is
likely to result in gross microtelencephaly, with marginal
chances for fetal survival to birth (Jones, 1997; Striedter,
2005). However, structural loss in humans comparable with
the mild ablation intermediate phenotype is more likely to
result in survival. If asymmetrically biased to locations in one
hemisphere, such mild forms of damage could distort the
radial fibre network and contribute to the laminar alteration
of cell density, neuronal disarray and pyramidal neuron
misorientation found in clinical cases of (neo)cortical
dysplasia associated with intractable pediatric epilepsy
(Andre et al., 2007). It has not escaped our notice that such
early defects are unpromising candidates for amelioration by
stem cell replacement therapies, since even modest delays of
settlement of well-sited, intrinsically generated replacements
for principal PP neurons, derived from the same cell lineage
as the original killed cells, lead to faulty cellular interactions
and progressive growth defects in a comparable neocortical
phenotype now characterized after genetically targeted
ablation.
