Introduction
Lung cancer represents the leading cause of can-
cer-related mortality worldwide, accounting for
1.2 million deaths each year. Locally advanced or
stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is
the most advanced stage at which cure may be
achieved. Whether the disease is treated by sur-
gery or chemoradiotherapy is determined based
on tumor pathology and the presence of tumor
extension and lymph node invasion. For patients
with resectable NSCLC, randomized trials have
shown that treating the disease with the combina-
tion of adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy
and surgery improves survival compared with sur-
gery alone.1
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can theoretically
reduce tumor volumes and control micrometa-
static diffusion, which may eventually improve
tumor resectability.
Lung cancers are supplied primarily by the bron-
chial artery,2 as well as by the subclavian artery.
Compared with conventional intravenous chemo-
therapy, bronchial arterial infusion (BAI) chemo-
therapy increases the local concentrations of
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy by bronchial
arterial infusion in patients with
unresectable stage III squamous cell lung
cancer

Abstract
Background: We investigated the effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy administered via
bronchial arterial infusion (BAI) on unresectable stage III lung squamous cell carcinoma
(SCC).
Methods: This was a single-arm retrospective study of chemotherapy with gemcitabine plus
cisplatin (GP) administered via BAI to patients with unresectable lung SCC. Data regarding the
post-treatment response rate, downstage rate, and surgery rate, as well as progression-free
survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), quality of life, and post-BAI side effects were collected.
Results: A total of 36 patients were enrolled in this study between August 2010 and May 2014.
The response rate was 72.2%, and the downstage rate was 22.2%. Among the patients who
were downstaged, 16 (44.4%) patients were because of their T stage, and 5 (13.9%) patients
were downstaged due to to their N stage. The surgery rate was 52.8%, the 1-year survival rate
was 75.4%, and the 2-year survival rate was 52.1%. The median PFS was 14.0 months [95%
confidence interval (CI): 8.6­19.4], and the median OS was 25.0 months (95% CI: 19.1­30.9).
The quality of life was significantly improved, and the chemotherapy was well tolerated.
Conclusions: Compared with intravenous neoadjuvant chemotherapy, BAI chemotherapy
significantly improved the surgery rate, prolonged PFS and OS, and improved the quality of life
in patients with unresectable stage III lung SCC.

chemotherapeutic agents by delivering these
drugs directly into lung cancer tissues via the
bronchial artery, making maximum reductions in
tumor size possible and thus increasing the treat-
ment options available for patients with NSCLC.
In this study, we administered neoadjuvant BAI
chemotherapy to stage III lung squamous cell car-
cinoma (SCC) patients whose tumors were
deemed unresectable by their surgeons before
treatment and investigated whether these patients'
tumors were resectable after BAI. Treatment side
effects, survival, and the patients' quality of life
were also assessed.
Materials and methods
Patient population
A total of 39 patients with unresectable stage III
SCC who may have been able to undergo radical
resection after two cycles of BAI chemotherapy
and who were treated in Shanghai Pulmonary
Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine
between August 2010 and May 2014 were
enrolled in this study. This study was approved
by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Pulmonary
Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine
(ethics approval no. K16-309). All the patients
had signed informed consent (informed consent
of study FK1210). All the patients underwent
thoracic computed tomography angiography
(CTA) prior to beginning chemotherapy. The
patients also underwent additional routine pre-
treatment evaluations such as abdominal ultra-
sonography or computed tomography (CT),
brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or head
CT, cardiopulmonary function testing and whole-
body radionuclide bone scans. The patients were
staged in accordance with the seventh edition of
the TNM classification system.
The following patients were included in the
study: patients who were treatment naïve; patients
with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
Performance Status (ECOG PS) score 0­2;
patients with an ability to tolerate BAI chemo-
therapy; patients with pathologically or cytologi-
cally confirmed stage IIIa or IIIb SCC; patients
deemed to have unresectable disease at the time
of diagnosis because their tumor exhibited bulky
lymph nodes on the ipsilateral side of the medi-
astinum (N2) disease (as determined by endo-
bronchial ultrasonography-guided transbronchial
needle aspiration biopsy, n = 3; or by CT, in
which the tumor was found to have a short-axis
diameter >1.5 cm, n = 1) or vital organ invasion;
patients with normal blood test results, as well as
patients with normal liver and kidney function,
normal ECG results, and normal blood gas analy-
sis results; patients with measurable solid lung
lesion(s) (as demonstrated by lung radiographic
imaging) that could be used to assess treatment
efficacy; and patients expected to survive more
than 6 months.
A total of 39 patients were enrolled in this study
(sample size justification: because this was a ret-
rospective study, the sample size was based on the
number of incoming patients that met the inclu-
sion criteria. As it took longer to identify patients
who met the eligibility requirements, 39 patients
between August 2010 and May 2014 were
enrolled in this study). Three of them were
excluded because of pre-existing heart disease or
an inability to complete chemotherapy. Thus, 36
patients were eligible for the study, whose popu-
lation comprised one female and 35 males with
the median age of 61 (39­78 years). Of these, 25
patients had stage IIIa disease, and 11 patients
had stage IIIb disease (Table 1).
Treatment regimen
The chemotherapy treatment regimen, which
consisted of gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GP), was
administered in accordance with the following
schedule: gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 BAI on day 1
and intravenous infusion on day 8) and cisplatin
(75 mg/m2 BAI on day 1 and intravenous infusion
on day 2) every 3 weeks. Each patient was sched-
uled to receive two cycles of BAI chemotherapy,
after which treatment efficacy was evaluated to
determine whether the patient should undergo
surgery or continue receiving chemotherapy or
radiotherapy.
BAI chemotherapy was administered under local
anesthesia. Femoral artery catheterization was
performed using a modified Seldinger percutane-
ous technique. After successful selective bronchial
artery intubation and bronchial arteriography, the
chemotherapy drugs were slowly injected.
Follow up
Treatment-related side effects and ECOG PS
scores were recorded during chemotherapy. After
two cycles of chemotherapy, chest CT, brain MRI,
J Zhu, H-p Zhang et al.

an isotope bone scan and an abdominal ultrasound
were performed, and treatment efficacy was
defined based patient responsiveness and disease
status according to the Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) scale, which is
categorized as follows: complete response (CR):
disappearance of all target lesions, any pathological
lymph nodes (whether target or nontarget) must
have reduction in short axis to <10 mm; partial
response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum
of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference
the baseline sum diameters; stable disease (SD):
neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor
sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease
(PD), taking as reference the smallest sum diame-
ters while on study; and PD: at least a 20% increase
in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as
reference the smallest sum on study (this includes
the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In
addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum
must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at
least 5 mm (note: the appearance of one or more
new lesions is also considered progression). Based
on patient outcomes, the downstage rate, surgery
rate, progression-free survival (PFS), overall
survival (OS), and ECOG PS were determined,
and treatment toxicity was documented.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were used for the baseline
clinical characteristics. Enumeration data were
described by percentage or rate. OS was defined
from the day of diagnosis to the day of death
from any cause, and PFS was defined from the
day of diagnosis to the day of progression or
death. Kaplan­Meier estimates were used to
obtain the median survival time and the corre-
sponding 95% confidence interval (CI). All sta-
tistical analyses were conducted using SPSS
software for Windows (version 21.0, SPSS Inc.,
United States of America).

showed that disease control was achieved in
91.7% of patients (Figures 1 and 2), including 26
(72.2%) patients who displayed a PR to treat-
ment and 7 (19.5%) patients who were found to
have SD. Three patients (8.3%) displayed PD
(with local progression). The response rate was
72.2%. BAI chemotherapy attenuated vascular
invasion, shrank lymph nodes and resulted in
eight patients' (22.2%) diseases being down-
staged. Sixteen (44.4%) patients were down-
staged with respect to their T stage, and five
(13.9%) patients were downstaged with respect
to their N stage. We discussed the above cases
with the appropriate surgeons, after which a total
19 patients (52.8%) underwent surgery (lobec-
tomy: n = 18; pneumonectomy: n = 1) (Tables 2
and 3). Patients who were not suitable for surgery
continued to receive intravenous chemotherapy
with or without radiotherapy.
The date of the last follow up was 31 December
2016 (mean follow-up time 47 months), and

none of the patients were lost to follow up. At the
end of the follow up, 23 patients had died.
Survival time
The median PFS and OS for all patients were
14.0 months (95% CI: 8.6­19.4) and 25.0
months (95% CI: 19.1­30.9), respectively. The
1-year survival rate was 75.4%, and the 2-year
survival rate was 52.1%. At the end of the follow-
up period, 11 patients (30.6%) were not found to
have PD, and 13 (36.1%) patients were still alive.
The median OS for patients with subsequent sur-
gery and nonsurgery were 29.1 months and 21.4
months (p = 0.032), respectively.
Changes in symptoms
After treatment, ECOG PS scores improved in
21 (58.3%) patients, did not change in 14
(38.9%) patients, and worsened in 1 (2.8%)
patient. Regarding symptom improvement, 31
(86.1%) patients showed improvements in cough
and sputum production, 10 (27.8%) patients
showed improvements in shortness of breath, two
(5.5%) patients showed improvement in upper
extremity edema and eight (22.2%) patients
showed improvement in bloody sputum produc-
tion. In contrast, one (2.8%) patient displayed
worsening symptoms. These results demonstrate
that BAI chemotherapy significantly improved
patient quality of life.
Safety
In general, the toxicity and side effects of BAI
chemotherapy were mild (Table 4), and no grade
IV toxic effects were observed. The most com-
mon side effects were grade I leukopenia (6/36,
16.7%) and anorexia (6/36, 16.7%). Moreover,
one patient experienced grade III leukopenia,
neutropenia, and nausea. The overall incidence
of side effects was low, and BAI chemotherapy
was well tolerated. Neither BAI-related bleeding
episodes or deaths nor BAI-related paraplegia
was noted.
Discussion
Because metastasis of adenocarcinomas is more
common,3 subsequent treatments using small
molecular-targeted drugs could be implemented,4
and the drug for SCC was less and the drug for
SCC was less than for adenocarcinoma; in this

study, we chose SCC but did not include adeno-
carcinoma. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy could
be used in stage III lung cancer, but in the Arrieta
et al.5 study, only 21.1% of the patients under-
went surgery after concurrent chemoradiother-
apy. Considering which treatment caused
radioactive pneumonia and mortality, we chose
the BAI as a preoperative induction method,
anticipating the increased probability of surgery.
The regimen consisting of GP is a standard com-
bination used for the treatment of SCC6,7 and
has a longer PFS than other cytotoxic platinum
regimens. Thus, we used GP as the BAI chemo-
therapy regimen in this study.
BAI chemotherapy significantly prolonged PFS
and OS in patients with stage III lung SCC. An
OS of at least 25 months is clinically significant.
Pless et al.8 showed that the PFS was 11.6
months, and the OS was 26.2 months in patients
with stage IIIa lung cancer (no patients with
stage IIIb lung cancer were enrolled in the study)
after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, results similar
to those of our study.
WJTOG99039 (WJTOG 9903 is the abbreviation
of a clinical trial which compared concurrent
chemoradiotherapy with chemotherapy along
before surgery in patients with pathologically con-
firmed N2 stage IIIA nonsmall cell lung cancer)
displayed a 21% of downstage rate in cases in
which induction chemotherapy was administered
to NSCLC patients with N2 invasion. In our
study, the downstage rate was 22.2% after two
cycles of BAI chemotherapy. Specifically, 16
(44.4%) patients were downstaged with respect
to their T stage and five (13.9%) patients were
downstaged with respect to their N stage. Thus,
19 (52.8%) patients who were previously thought
to have unresectable or marginally resectable dis-
ease underwent complete resections. The surgery
rate in our study was 52.8%, a rate much higher
than those of other neoadjuvant treatment stud-
ies. At the end of the 5-year follow-up period, 11
patients had SD, and 13 patients were alive. In
Kocher et al.'s study,10 the surgery rate was 34%
for patients with unresectable stage IIIa and IIIb
lung cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
and radiotherapy. Notably, BAI chemotherapy
resulted in more T-stage downstaging than
N-stage downstaging, suggesting that T4 disease
with tumor extension into vital organs or blood
vessel involvement may be an indication for neo-
adjuvant BAI chemotherapy.

Pless et al.11 showed that radiotherapy did not
enhance the benefits of induction chemotherapy
followed by surgery, so we did not use BAI chem-
otherapy followed by radiotherapy in our study.
During chemotherapy with BAI, blood vessels
supplying the tumor must be precisely located,12
as blood vessel location is a prerequisite for effec-
tive BAI treatment. Nakanishi13 conducted a
study involving patients with stage III­IV NSCLC
who were unable to tolerate conventional chemo-
therapy. Those authors found the PFS was 6.5
months and the OS was 17.4 months after BAI
chemotherapy. Those survival times were shorter
than the PFS and OS of our study because that
study enrolled patients with stage IV disease. Our
study demonstrated that all the patients who dis-
played significantly prolonged OS were those who
were referred for surgery after BAI and those who
underwent radical tumor resection, indicating that
surgery played a vital role in extending OS. Hence,
we believe that an important consideration with
respect to BAI chemotherapy is whether the ther-
apy will improve a patient's chances of being able
to undergo surgery. We advise against administer-
ing simple BAI chemotherapy in patients with
stage IV lung cancer because tumor shrinkage
alone had little effect on survival in these patients.
Wang et al.14 showed that BAI plus hyperfraction-
ated radiotherapy was effective for the treatment
of advanced cancer. Adjuvant chemotherapy after
surgery is effective, but radiotherapy does not
increase the efficacy of this treatment.15
Among patients who underwent BAI chemother-
apy, their quality of life was improved and 58.3%
of patients showed improvement in their ECOG
PS score, a change related to significant tumor
shrinkage. Symptoms induced by local tumor
compression and other systemic symptoms
(including symptoms induced by tumor-related
superior vena cava, recurrent laryngeal nerve, tra-
chea, and heart compression) also subsequently
improved. BAI chemotherapy even showed effi-
cacy in the treatment of metastatic lung tumors.16
However, as is the case with other types of chemo-
therapy, BAI chemotherapy also resulted in wors-
ening symptoms in some patients (2.8%), although
symptom worsening associated with BAI occurred
less often than symptom worsening associated
with conventional intravenous chemotherapy.
BAI chemotherapy was well tolerated. None of the
patients in this study required suspensions or
delays of their BAI chemotherapy because of treat-
ment side effects, and no grade IV toxicity was
observed. These findings are probably attributable
to the fact that the local concentrations of chemo-
therapy drugs, that is, the concentrations of chem-
otherapy drugs in the tumor, were high, which
resulted in reduced systemic concentrations of the
drugs. Nakanishi et al.17 also showed that patients
with advanced NSCLC who were unable to toler-
ate intravenous chemotherapy may tolerate BAI
chemotherapy. Furthermore, advances in surgical
techniques have reduced the incidence of surgical
complications after BAI chemotherapy. No BAI-
related side effects were noted in this study. All
patients underwent CTA before beginning BAI to
ensure that they experienced the best possible
treatment outcome. Paraplegia is considered a
severe side effect of BAI. However, because much
attention was devoted to the position of the cathe-
ter, there were no cases of paraplegia in our study.
Therefore, adequate preoperative preparation and
experienced operators can improve the efficacy
and safety of the BAI procedure. If other cancer
centers also have much experience of chemother-
apy, and interventional departments employ oper-
ators who are experienced with selective bronchial
artery intubation and bronchial arteriography,
then BAI can be performed reliably.
This study revealed that BAI chemotherapy sig-
nificantly increased the surgery rate, prolonged
PFS and OS, and improved quality of life in
patients with unresectable stage III lung SCC
compared with intravenous neoadjuvant chemo-
therapy in the same group of patients. BAI
resulted in more T-stage downstaging than
N-stage downstaging, suggesting that we must
choose more suitable patients when considering
BAI chemotherapy as a neoadjuvant treatment.
However, further research is needed to investi-
gate whether BAI chemotherapy is as effective as
neoadjuvant therapy with respect to NSCLC
treatment. The role of radiotherapy in neoadju-
vant therapy is still unclear. NSCLC patients can
usually tolerate the toxicity of BAI combined with
other treatments, such as radiotherapy.18 The
effect of the combination of radiotherapy and
BAI chemotherapy must also be studied further.
In addition, the sample size in our study was
small, in part because BAI chemotherapy requires
a specific route of administration and is more
expensive than conventional intravenous chemo-
therapy. Studies with a larger sample size and
longer follow-up period are needed for the per-
formance of a better efficacy evaluation and to
J Zhu, H-p Zhang et al.

determine the survival benefits offered by BAI
chemotherapy.
