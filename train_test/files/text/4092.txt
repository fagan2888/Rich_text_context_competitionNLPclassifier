By 2030, one in five Americans will be 65 or older, with an
estimated 2 to 7 million of those individuals identifying
themselves as gay or lesbian (Grant, 2010). Reports have
shown that little is known about the health care needs of
older gay men and lesbians (Anetzberger, Ishler, Mostade, &
Blair, 2004; Simone & Appelbaum, 2011) and that gay men
and lesbians are an understudied population worthy of fur-
ther attention (Fredriksen-Goldsen & Muraco, 2010; Institute
of Medicine, 2011). Understanding the scope of gay men's
aging is further complicated by the U.S. Census Bureau
National Population Estimates (2010) not providing statistics
estimating the number of gay men living in the United States.
The "Healthy People 2020" (U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services, 2011) report addresses the health dis-
parities of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered (LGBT)
individuals linked to societal stigma, discrimination, and
denial of many civil and basic human rights. The report also
states that discrimination against LGBT persons has been
associated with high rates of psychiatric disorders, substance
abuse, and suicide. The minority stress model (Brooks, 1981)
undergirds the premise that gay men may find aging particu-
larly difficult (Meyer, 1995a, 1995b). Older gay men might
have less social support, while experiencing stigmatization
and internalized homophobia. Older gay men have also wit-
nessed the devastating effects of the AIDS epidemic, either
as long-term survivors of the disease themselves or experi-
encing the loss of life partners, close friends, and others
within their community to the illness. While older gay men
share with their heterosexual counterparts common concerns
related to aging, declining health, and the need for future
care, there is evidence to suggest that they have unique chal-
lenges related to self-perception, provider relationships,
sociocultural support systems, and medical­legal bureau-
cracy (Christensen, 2005; Slevin, 2008; Smolinski & Colon,
2006). The purpose of this study was to explore the experi-
ences of aging among gay men to further explain the phe-
nomenon of gay male aging in contemporary terms, to put
those experiences into a historically relevant context, and to
expand upon previous findings on aging within the gay male
population. Historical context is of particular relevance here
as it may influence how study participants may perceive their
experiences of being gay and aging. At the time of the collec-
tion of data for this study, Don't Ask, Don't Tell military
policy had been repealed, employer-based same-sex benefits
among private as well as governmental entities continued to
expand, and same-sex marriage was legal in six states includ-
ing Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, Maine,
New Hampshire, as well as the District of Columbia.
Literature Review
As an area of scholarly inquiry, the phenomenon of gay aging
is relatively new (Fredriksen-Goldsen & Muraco, 2010;

Optimistically Engaging in the Present:
Experiences of Aging Among Gay Men
Eric A. Fenkl1 and Beth L. Rodgers2
Abstract
This study explores the experiences of aging among gay men to further explain the phenomenon of gay male aging in
contemporary terms, to put those experiences into a historically relevant context, and to expand upon previous findings
on aging within the gay male population. Nineteen self-identifying gay men from a metropolitan area in South Florida were
interviewed. The data collected were analyzed using grounded theory method. Findings from the study indicated that a great
deal of optimism was revealed by the participants of the study in spite of their past adversarial experiences related to their
sexuality and current challenges related to gay male sexuality and aging. Based on these findings, professionals working with
an older population should consider the supportive environments that can most benefit this population in the community
and even consider partnering with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) oriented organizations to better serve the
needs of their clients.

homosexuality considered taboo as recently as 50 years ago
and homosexuality as a classification of a psychiatric disor-
der only removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders (DSM) in 1973 (Spitzer, 1981),
Cruikshank (1991) noted that it has only been since the late
1970s that gerontologists felt free to pursue any interest in
gay subjects. Prior to the 1970s, the stigma related to homo-
sexuality was so great, and with the origins of homosexuality
still classified as a psychiatric disorder and illegal in many
jurisdictions, many social scientists were reluctant to pursue
research for fear of being themselves identified as homosex-
ual or having ties to homosexuality. Needless to say, chang-
ing demographics, public policy, and societal attitudes
continue to alter the current perception of the aging experi-
ences of gay men. From a legal perspective, sodomy laws
were only invalidated as recently as 2003 by the U.S.
Supreme Court decision of Lawrence v. Texas (2003).
Although progress has been made in social policy, legal
bureaucracy, and public sentiment, particularly as it relates to
changing attitudes toward marriage equality, older individu-
als who identify as gay continue to be a population that often
is stigmatized for both their increasing age and their sexual
orientation (Brotman et al., 2007; Brown, Alley, Sarosy,
Quarto, & Cook, 2001; Jackson, 2008).
As previously documented in a comprehensive review
(Fenkl, 2012), five domains have been identified (Fredriksen-
Goldsen & Muraco, 2010) for organizing the literature on
gay aging: (a) psychosocial adjustment to aging, (b) identity
development, (c) social support, (d) health, and (e) aging-
related community needs and services. Regarding psychoso-
cial adjustment to aging, Price (2005) noted that the sexuality
of older people, and gays and lesbians in particular, has been
largely overlooked resulting in the particular experiences,
needs, and concerns of older gay adults being unrecognized
from policy, practice, and research perspectives. Other
authors have argued that the contemporary image of gay men
may favor younger adults (Acquaviva, de Vries, & Quam,
2006; Anetzberger et al., 2004; Fox, 2007). In spite of the
common observation of the gay community as explicitly
youth oriented, hypothetical predictions of inferior psycho-
social adjustment to aging among gay men have been largely
unfounded. In fact, significant findings over the course of
multiple studies have revealed encouraging conclusions.
While the earlier findings of both Bennett and Thompson
(1980) and Berger (1984) clearly refuted the idea that older
gay men were disengaged from the social aspects of the gay
community and experienced especially negative mental
health consequences of aging (Bennett & Thompson, 1980;
Berger, 1984), other research studies have consistently dem-
onstrated that gay men might even fare better than their het-
erosexual counterparts with regard to being prepared to
accept the realities of aging (Brown et al., 2001; Butler,
2004; Friend, 1991; Quam & Whitford, 1992) as a result of
having successfully overcome adversity in younger years. It
is also equally important to acknowledge that the positive
attitudes toward aging and the lessening of mental health
issues among older gay men can likely be attributed to the
increasing acceptance of LGBT persons and the greater self-
acceptance among gay men as a result of coming out.
Identity development was the focus of studies conducted
by both Peacock (2000) and Beard and Hissam (2002). Based
on Erikson's (1959) developmental stages as a theoretical
framework, these authors suggested that the traditional sched-
ules of developmental issues addressed across the life span
for heterosexuals may not realistically apply to gay men.
Speaking to the differences that may prevail between gay
men and their heterosexual counterparts as well as between
and among gay men, the authors found that recognizing that
older gay men may not be at the traditional developmental
stage as their heterosexual age peers was as important as rec-
ognizing that older men who have lived openly gay lives may
be at a different developmental stage from their gay male
counterparts who have lived most of their lives closeted.
These findings were further underscored by Lee (2004), who
suggested that Karp's (1988) framework used for the exami-
nation of identity development in the aging process was het-
erosexist and not applicable to gay men.
The significance of a social support network for aging
populations is readily familiar to professionals working
across the spectrum of health care. However, it has been sug-
gested that social support is of particular importance to popu-
lations that have been marginalized or who might otherwise
perceive an isolated existence due to a lack of familial ties or
support (Beeler, Rawls, Herdt, & Cohler, 1999; Christian &
Keefe, 1997; Kochman, 1997). Shippy, Cantor, and Brennan
(2004) suggested that previous research has shown that the
needs of older gay men are no different than those of their
heterosexual counterparts. Other research studies point to the
AIDS epidemic as a contributing factor in the further isola-
tion of many gay men. This isolation ultimately resulted in
the provision of care and social support to friends and part-
ners becoming a major focus of the gay community
(Fredriksen, 1999; Shippy et al., 2004).
Perhaps as a result of the AIDS epidemic, matters of
health appear to play a significant role among the aging gay
male population. In a critical review of the medical literature
related to the older HIV-positive adult, Martin, Fain, and
Klotz (2008) reported that approximately 25% of new HIV
infections were occurring in adults over the age of 50 years.
Robinson, Petty, Patton, and Kang (2008) argued that aging
with HIV can be confusing and may include times of grief,
despondency, and loneliness. Advances in antiretroviral ther-
apy are increasing survival and longevity for people living
with HIV. Vance, Moneyham, Fordham, and Struzick (2008)
asserted that depression and suicidal ideation represent sig-
nificant problems for many older adults living with HIV who
also may be particularly vulnerable to the influences of age-
ism and stigma, loneliness and decreased social support,
neurological changes, declining health, fatigue, changes in
appearance, and financial distress.

Individuals approaching retirement, both gay and hetero-
sexual, are likely to anticipate the financial and health care
challenges that lie ahead. However, the challenges facing
gay men have been compounded by the institutionalized het-
erosexism that exists within the systems of health care, gov-
ernment, and society. Institutionalized heterosexism refers to
an ideological system that denies, denigrates, and stigma-
tizes any nonheterosexual form of behavior, identity, rela-
tionship, or community (Butler, 2004; Cahill & South, 2002;
Chandler et al., 2005; Fannin, 2006; Herek, 1990a, 1990b).
As with institutional racism and sexism, heterosexism per-
vades societal customs and institutions. Operating through a
dual process of invisibility and stigma, the primary conse-
quence of heterosexism is marginalization for those not part
of the mainstream heterosexual culture. This marginalization
precludes the individual members of the gay community
from real or perceived meaningful participation in society
and perpetuates, among the marginalized, the perception that
their individual needs are not being recognized or met.
Method
The method of grounded theory (Charmaz, 2006; Glaser,
1978; Glaser & Strauss, 1967) was used in this study to
construct a substantive theory of the experience of aging
among gay men. Grounded theory focuses on the perspec-
tives of study participants in regard to their experiences
with a phenomenon rather than applying an existing theory
to those experiences. Existing theories might be applicable
to specific aspects of the experience of aging among gay
males but would not address the processes of aging that
may be uniquely specific to this population. Grounded the-
ory results in a substantive theory that reflects and is
grounded in the experiences of the participants in the study
and can expand existing theoretical approaches to the
phenomenon.
This study was conducted in a metropolitan area in South
Florida with a large population of men who identify as gay.
Although it has been historically difficult to estimate the
actual size of any gay population, recently released data from
the 2012 census designates the city of Fort Lauderdale as
having the highest concentration of same-sex couple house-
holds in the country with 2.8% of all households. After
obtaining approval from the Institutional Review Board of
the investigator's university, the researcher distributed flyers
at a variety of locations in the area that were frequented by
gay men including churches, clinics, nightclubs, community
centers, and local retail establishments.
The investigator conducted 19 face-to-face interviews
with those who responded and who gave their informed con-
sent to participate in the study. Eligibility criteria included
male participants between the ages of 55 and 70 who
self-identified as gay. Interviews of approximately 60 to 90
min in length were conducted with each participant in a pri-
vate location of the participant's choice. Following each
audio-recorded interview, the recording was transcribed ver-
batim by a transcriptionist skilled in the confidential han-
dling of research transcripts. The investigator checked each
transcript for accuracy by comparing it with the original
audio recording. NVivo 8.0 software was used for data man-
agement and the analysis proceeded from initial open, sub-
stantive coding through category construction. Using the
constant comparative analysis approach described by Glaser
and Strauss (1967), Glaser (1978), and Charmaz (2006), the
process of analysis began with open, substantive coding. In
this first stage, code words or phrases were used to capture
the substantive content of each idea presented in the data.
More than one code was assigned if necessary to capture as
many ideas as possible without premature closure. When
appropriate, codes were the actual words used by the partici-
pants. The next phase of analysis involved working with the
initial codes to identify categories of similar content and
ideas. Using the constant comparative analysis process that
is the hallmark of grounded theory, the researcher compared
content within codes and codes with other codes to identify
similarities and develop a system of categories that captured
the experiences of the participants. These categories next
were examined to determine patterns and consistent ideas in
the categories as well as to identify areas of overlap of con-
flict. The categories were continually reworked until a con-
cise system of categories was developed that captured the
experiences of the participants in a clear, meaningful, and
parsimonious way. The final stage of analysis involved the
identification of the core variable that illustrated the Basic
Sociopsychological Process present in the experiences of the
participants. This was accomplished by reviewing the cate-
gories, examining the content within categories, and ulti-
mately determining the core or unifying thread that tied the
categories together. While this analysis process is described
here as occurring in stages, the actual work of analysis is
iterative and involved the researcher continuously reexamin-
ing the raw data, exploring questions in the data and the
analysis, challenging his own conceptions, and ultimately
arriving at a core variable and category system that is based
in the experiences of the participants and that captures those
experiences in a meaningful way.
The researcher utilized a number of strategies to enhance
the rigor of the research throughout all of the steps of the
process. Throughout the research, the investigator main-
tained an audit trail (Lincoln & Guba, 1985) to document all
of the aspects of the study and ensure that the findings were
based in the words and experiences of the participants and
not the ideas of the researcher (Glaser, 1978; Lincoln &
Guba, 1985). The audit trail consisted of the actual research
data along with memos regarding theoretical insights gener-
ated during analysis and field notes documenting the condi-
tions of the interview and the researcher's initial impressions.
Using these materials as documentation of the research pro-
cess, the researcher engaged in extensive peer review and
debriefing with the coauthor in which analytic ideas and

Findings
The findings of this study were developed from 490 pages of
interview transcripts obtained from 19 self-identifying gay
male study participants (Table 1). It is important to note that
the study participants were for the most part White (89.4%)
with the majority reporting having a college degree (63.1%),
However, socioeconomically, the sample was not as homo-
geneous with study participants reporting a wide range of
income levels. Overall, participants of the study perceived
their experiences of aging to be overwhelmingly optimistic
Fenkl and Rodgers 5
in spite of the adversities they have encountered in the past
and the realities of aging that they currently face or anticipate
encountering in the future. "Optimistically engaging in the
present," as a core category and basic social process, is the
culmination of three social processes that have developed
over the course of the participants' lives, either through a
learned or serendipitous process, that involve resolving
adversity, negotiating the realities of aging, and developing
resources (Figure 1). Resolving adversity refers to the social
process of coming to terms with and/or overcoming issues in
one's life that were challenging such as the stigma related to
one's sexual orientation. Negotiating the realities of aging
refers to the process of being cognizant of those elements of
aging that one may encounter as one ages and cannot realisti-
cally change. Developing resources refers to the process of
recognizing what can be done to improve one's life and the
experience of aging, whether as an internal process of self-
perception or attitude toward aging or as an external process
of seeking out resources available in the community. The
process of resolving adversity has meaning and applicability
for the study participants because of the unique challenges
they reported encountering in their lives, not exclusively, but
often related to the stigmatization and victimization of indi-
viduals identifying as or perceived as being gay. It should be
further noted that the sample of men who participated in this
study may be representative of a subset of the gay male pop-
ulation that, by virtue of their willingness to participate in
such a study and self-identify as gay, may in fact be more
well adjusted in terms of their perceptions of self and self
worth and have a more positive outlook on life than a sample
of men who are not willing to self-identify as gay outside of
their own social network.
Resolving adversity involves the study participants
resolving the past and utilizing the knowledge, strength, and
wisdom that come from such resolution in the present. When
asked to describe their experiences of aging, study partici-
pants would often begin by saying that they did not think
about themselves as aging. Instead, they began by describing
the resolution of past conflicts and coming to terms with self
and self-acceptance as part of their aging experience. One
participant, who reported being retired as a high school crisis
counselor and being long-term partnered, described his satis-
faction with life in the present, as well as the internalized
homophobia he struggled with as a young man. He went on
to describe how he resolved his conflict with his sexual ori-
entation and how that may have contributed to his personal
and professional development:
Oh, I feel like I've had a very good life. Yeah. I wish that I didn't
have the issues earlier on from like 14 to 25 of not accepting
myself, because really that's what it was. I just could not accept
that I was gay. I just thought I was a sick individual. And our
society supported that, because it was 1950s, 1960s, you know,
so that was like a lot of waste of energy also. But, I guess it made
me more observant about people and it made me study more
about psychology and it made me become a psychologist.
This study participant described how, in part, resolving
the internal conflict he had with his sexual orientation took
the form of learning to accept himself as a gay man. His
acceptance of self as a gay man fostered an interest in psy-
chology and that interest developed into a professional
endeavor as a school psychologist. In turn, his chosen profes-
sion put him in a position to help other young people who
struggled with their own sexual orientation, and provided
him with greater career and personal satisfaction knowing he
could make a difference in others' lives.
The process of negotiating realities is the second of the
three processes that emerged as foundational to the basic
social process of optimistically engaging in the present.
Negotiating realities involves the interplay between the chal-
lenges anticipated by all individuals as they get older--such
as financial burdens, declining health and health care, loss of
independence, retirement, and the need for care in older
age--and the challenges the study participants may encoun-
ter that are more consistent with a gay male culture. Those
challenges include an overemphasis on appearance and
youth, isolation due to lack of familial or social support, and
vulnerability to homophobia and victimization. Negotiating
realities is characterized by study participants acknowledg-
ing changes as they related to aging, including how aging has
influenced their perceptions of self and getting older and the
possibility of declining health. One study participant, age 62,
a nurse who also was a well-known female impersonator in
the community, was interviewed shortly after having a
below-the-knee amputation as a consequence of a diabetic
infection. He described his perception of health and health
care and aging as a gay male:
When you're young you don't really worry about health care.
You know, it's just not on the top of your priority list. Being
older and gay you kind of learn that the future is very unsure
because, you know, so many gay people are alienated from
friends and family because they are gay, and that the older they
get, it's much more frightening to think that they're gonna be
alone. So, prepare, tell, people, especially gay people because
they have that tendency of not doing that because they live the
carefree life all their life, that this is part of their way of living,
prepare, prepare, 'cause you don't know, and it's not easy being,

a charity case now when I'm used to asking people for help and
now I have to survive. So that's a big change in my life right now
is that I have to ask people for help.
Although study participants described the realities related
to aging in terms of what they perceived to be the challenges
confronting them as they age, they generally did so with an
optimistic perspective. However, optimistically engaging in
the present requires more than just an optimistic perspective;
it also involves resources that facilitate the successful nego-
tiation of the realities of aging. Study participants described
a variety of resources that facilitated that process.
The process of developing resources, third of the three
processes, emerged as another important category of the
basic social process of optimistically engaging in the present.
The process of developing resources has meaning and appli-
cability for the study participants as the resources were
developed over the course of a lifetime and were often devel-
oped in response to having to resolve the adversities they
encountered, either as individuals or as members of a poten-
tially stigmatized population. The development of these
resources and their usefulness in application to the chal-
lenges of aging contribute to the basic social process of opti-
mistically engaging in the present and are inherently
connected with the processes of resolving adversity and
negotiating realities. Study participants described a variety
of resources. These resources included being active in the
community, having a sense of faith or spirituality, having
feelings of acceptance both of oneself and by one's commu-
nity, seeking out gay-friendly health care providers, main-
taining a positive outlook on life, having a strong social
support network, being satisfied with one's life, having a
positive perception of self, and acknowledging the signifi-
cance of being partnered. One participant, aged 67, described
faith and spirituality in terms of the unique opportunity he
perceived gay men to have over their heterosexual counter-
parts from a more secular angle:
I want to be 80 and I want to be enjoying life. I see a lot of
spiritual groups. I see a lot of weeklong retreats, a lot of, you
know, organizations that are doing positive things for the gay
community and people are involved with, and I think all of that
is because we are demanding more. We're demanding that life
be good, we're demanding that we're fulfilled in this world. And
because of that, all these things are popping up that will allow
people to get together and discuss issues like that and, you know,
the straight world may have that, but I think the straight world
has it probably through religious organizations. And because so
many gay people aren't tied into specific religious organizations,
I think we're freer to create the secular organizations that treat
our spiritual needs.
Again, this participant provides further insight into how
gay men perceive themselves in the aging process and subse-
quently describes how their needs in advanced age can be
met in a more culturally competent approach. Cultural
competence is also relevant to the health care needs of older
gay men. When asked about health care, most study partici-
pants described being most comfortable with what they
described as "gay friendly" providers. Gay-friendly provid-
ers were providers that were either gay themselves or provid-
ers that served a population of gay men. Gay-friendly
providers were perceived as being more open to discussion
related to gay male sexual health and more aware of the psy-
chosocial challenges that may be specific to older gay men
such as loss of a partner. Table 2 provides an overview of the
specific categories and components that emerged as part of
the process of optimistically engaging in the present. These
categories and components are relevant and particularly
helpful as a framework for assessing the needs of older adults
who identify as gay, as well as relevant for other older adults.
Implications for Research and Practice
The population of self-identifying older gay men is growing.
This is the result of both the growing population of older
adults in general as well as the growing visibility of people
who identify as gay (Cahill, South, & Spade, 2000; Grant,
2010; Price, 2005). As the older gay community grows in
both size and visibility, so too will the need for an evidence-
based understanding of the issues that are unique to this popu-
lation. The findings of this qualitative study are unique to the
particular time and place in which the study data was col-
lected and no claims can be asserted with regard to the gener-
alizability of these findings to other samples of gay men in
other geographic area. However, these findings do in fact
reinforce the argument that sexual minorities such as gay men
are more optimistic about their lives when living in an envi-
ronment that is supportive, more inclusive, and less stigmatiz-
ing. In spite of the optimism that was evident in participants
in this study, it is important to note that LGBT Americans are
recognized by The U.S. Department of Health and Human

Services (2011) as one of six groups affected by health dis-
parities. In addition, there are long-lasting effects on the indi-
vidual and the community from frequent experiences of
violence and victimization, as well as struggling with issues
of acceptance, personal, family, and societal (Simone &

large is not necessarily so. In terms of research, perhaps the
greatest threat to the health of lesbian, gay, and bisexual
Americans is the lack of scientific information about their
health and the lack of knowledge related to LGBT patient
centered outcomes. While the findings of this study contrib-
ute to an increased understanding of the health and psychoso-
cial needs of gay men in a geographic location that is
welcoming to gay men and provides a supportive environ-
ment, both through the resources available and the sheer num-
ber of gay men living in the geographical area, further similar
research is warranted that targets more diverse gay male pop-
ulations in less supportive environments, particularly among
men who are not openly gay and live closeted lives. Such
research is likely to reveal a myriad of findings related to gay
male aging experiences. This is important as the expansion of
the knowledge base to include groups who have been over-
looked, such as gay men, provides health care professionals
with a heightened awareness of the challenges encountered
by such groups, and is foundational to culturally appropriate
and individualized care. It is also important to note that in
spite of the optimism revealed in the findings here, stigma
stills plays a prominent role in the delivery of LGBT health
care. The potential stigmatization that older gay men encoun-
ter in health care settings can be decreased when health care
professionals have a greater understanding of the life experi-
ences and perspectives that this population brings into the
health care setting. This is a pivotal point as the local health
care environment determines one's experiences and is highly
variable. For example, the findings of the study presented in
this article demonstrated that the sample population preferred
gay-friendly health care providers and thrived in a supportive
social environment. Gay men who are not comfortable dis-
closing their sexual orientation to health care providers may
be at risk of not receiving an appropriate health care screen-
ing. In addition, participants of this study reported concerns
related to physical changes, financial status, isolation, loss of
independence, and sexual relations and functioning. This
greater understanding of the superimposed conditions that
accompany aging among gay men is imperative for health
care and other professionals across a spectrum of practice.
Based on these findings, strategies for addressing sexual ori-
entation with clients that promote feelings of acceptance and
understanding should be considered, as disclosure of one's
sexual identity is often related to perceived safety, and the
pervasive expectation of gender conformity on the part of
health care professionals can be alienating. In addition,
assessments that may be of concern to older gay male clients
such as alterations in physical appearance, perceptions of
feeling isolated or lonely, relationship status, and sexual func-
tioning and satisfaction should be considered. Equally impor-
tant is the assessment of caregiver-role stress of the older gay
male client. As this population ages, the likelihood that they
will find themselves in a caregiver role is also likely to
increase, particularly for those who have been long-term part-
nered. Within the context of this study, agencies and organiza-
tions were identified that were geared specifically toward the
needs of older LGBT individuals. Based on these findings,
professionals working with an older population should con-
sider the supportive environments that can most benefit this
population in the community, and even consider partnering
with these organizations to better serve the needs of their cli-
ents (Rosenfeld, Bartlam, & Smith, 2012). These interven-
tions would include an understanding of the resources that are
available in the community that can facilitate peer support as
well as the referral to agencies and organizations that are best
suited to meeting the needs of an older gay population.
