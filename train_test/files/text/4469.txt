Background The efficacy of diabetes genetic risk testing to motivate behavior
change for diabetes prevention is currently unknown.
Purpose This paper presents key issues in the design and implementation of one of
the first randomized trials (The Genetic Counseling/Lifestyle Change (GC/LC) Study
for Diabetes Prevention) to test whether knowledge of diabetes genetic risk can
motivate patients to adopt healthier behaviors.
Methods Because individuals may react differently to receiving `higher' vs `lower'
genetic risk results, we designed a 3-arm parallel group study to separately test the
hypotheses that: (1) patients receiving `higher' diabetes genetic risk results will
increase healthy behaviors compared to untested controls, and (2) patients
receiving `lower' diabetes genetic risk results will decrease healthy behaviors
compared to untested controls. In this paper we describe several challenges to
implementing this study, including: (1) the application of a novel diabetes risk score
derived from genetic epidemiology studies to a clinical population, (2) the use of
the principle of Mendelian randomization to efficiently exclude `average' diabetes
genetic risk patients from the intervention, and (3) the development of a diabetes
genetic risk counseling intervention that maintained the ethical need to motivate
behavior change in both `higher' and `lower' diabetes genetic risk result recipients.
Results Diabetes genetic risk scores were developed by aggregating the results of
36 diabetes-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms. Relative risk for type 2
diabetes was calculated using Framingham Offspring Study outcomes, grouped by
quartiles into `higher', `average' (middle two quartiles) and `lower' genetic risk.
From these relative risks, revised absolute risks were estimated using the overall
absolute risk for the study group. For study efficiency, we excluded all patients
receiving 'average' diabetes risk results from the subsequent intervention. This post-
randomization allocation strategy was justified because genotype represents a
random allocation of parental alleles (`Mendelian randomization'). Finally, because
it would be unethical to discourage participants to participate in diabetes
prevention behaviors, we designed our two diabetes genetic risk counseling
interventions (for `higher' and `lower' result recipients) so that both groups would
be motivated despite receiving opposing results.

Limitations For this initial assessment of the clinical implementation of genetic risk
testing we assessed intermediate outcomes of attendance at a 12-week diabetes
prevention course and changes in self-reported motivation. If effective, longer term
studies with larger sample sizes will be needed to assess whether knowledge of
diabetes genetic risk can help patients prevent diabetes.
Conclusions We designed a randomized clinical trial designed to explore the
motivational impact of disclosing both higher than average and lower than average
genetic risk for type 2 diabetes. This design allowed exploration of both increased
risk and false reassurance, and has implications for future studies in translational
genomics. Clinical Trials 2011; 8: 609­615. http://ctj.sagepub.com
Introduction
The contribution of heritable factors to the devel-
opment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been estimated
to be as high as 40% [1]. With continuing advances
in `next-generation' genetic sequencing technolo-
gies, increased ability to identify rare risk loci, and
the identification of alternative heritable factors
(such as copy number variation, epigenetic marks),
we are now poised on the threshold of applying
personalized genetic risk information to the clinical
management of diabetes [2,3]. Given the increased
costs, uncertain efficacy, and potential for adverse
impact of such testing, randomized clinical trials
are needed for rigorous evaluation of the impact of
applied genetic testing on patient behavior and on
clinical management [4­6].
One potential role for diabetes genetic testing
may be to motivate patients to adopt healthy
behaviors to prevent T2D [7]. Lifestyle modification
(such as increased exercise and sustained dietary
changes to achieve >7% weight loss) has been
conclusively demonstrated in several studies to
significantly reduce T2D incidence among patients
at increased phenotypic risk [8­10]. However,
translation of these results into clinical practice
has been limited by difficulty in motivating
patients to adopt and sustain the behavioral
changes necessary to prevent diabetes [11,12].
Recent advances in genetic epidemiology have
now identified over three dozen loci associated
with increased T2D risk [13]. It is not known
whether communicating personal diabetes genetic
risk information can be used in clinical practice to
increase and sustain patient motivation effectively.
Conversely, genetic risk assessment of phenotypi-
cally at-risk patients raises the paradox that testing
often identifies individuals at relatively low genetic
risk [14]. Such `lower' genetic risk information
could inappropriately reassure individuals who
would clearly benefit from lifestyle changes based
on phenotype.
We designed a randomized clinical trial--The
Genetic Counseling/Lifestyle Change (GC/LC)
Study for Diabetes Prevention--to evaluate the
impact of T2D genetic counseling on behavior
change among patients who are aware that they are
at increased phenotypic risk for diabetes. Funded by
the National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive
and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), our study is specifi-
cally designed to test two separate hypotheses in
comparison to individuals randomized to no
genetic testing: (1) individuals with `higher' diabe-
tes genetic risk would be more motivated to sustain
lifestyle changes; and (2) individuals with 'lower'
diabetes genetic risk would be less motivated to
sustain lifestyle changes.
In this report, we describe important study
design decisions related to: (1) implementing an
individualized diabetes genetic risk score, (2) creat-
ing an allocation scheme based on the novel
application of `Mendelian randomization' to
exclude the majority of individuals who fall into a
relatively narrow `average' diabetes genetic risk
range, and (3) designing an ethical genetic coun-
seling intervention to motivate participants regard-
less of their genetic risk score.
Methods
Patient eligibility and recruitment
We enrolled patients at high risk for T2D based on
phenotypic criteria by identifying individuals in
our clinical network with the metabolic syndrome
(MetS; defined as meeting at least three of five
of the following clinical criteria: fasting glucose
! 100 mg/dL, waist circumference > 35 in (women)
or > 40 in (men), HDL cholesterol < 50 mg/dL
(women) or < 40 mg/dL (men), triglycerides
!150 mg/dL, and blood pressure ! 130/85 mmHg
or prescribed antihypertensive medication) [15].
Patients in this source population were predomi-
nantly white (79%), with mean age 56.5
(Æ14) years, and evenly divided between men and
women. National data indicate that patients with
MetS have a 3- to almost 30-fold increased diabetes
incidence compared to similar patients without
MetS [16,17]. MetS has similar sensitivity (but lower

Clinical Trials 2011; 8: 609­615 http://ctj.sagepub.com
specificity) than the more burdensome oral glucose
tolerance test [18] for identifying individuals at risk
for T2D and has the distinct advantages of using
readily available clinical measures and of identify-
ing a larger at-risk patient population (47 million in
the US with MetS [19]), making this approach more
readily applicable to the `real world' setting.
Potentially eligible study participants were iden-
tified initially through automated medical record
review using a previously validated algorithm that
had 73% sensitivity and 91% specificity for identi-
fying patients with MetS [20]. Eligibility of poten-
tial participants was then verified using a manual
medical record review and, with permission from
the patient's primary care provider, confirmed via a
brief telephone screen.
Study schema--Phase 1
Our protocol was implemented in two phases
(Figure 1). In Phase 1, we enrolled and consented
eligible participants to the GC/LC Study. At this
first visit, all participants completed baseline sur-
veys to assess baseline diabetes risk perception and
current motivation to change diabetes-related
health behaviors. After survey completion, partic-
ipants were randomized in a 4:1 ratio to diabetes
genetic risk testing vs no testing. The larger
proportion of participants allocated to genetic
testing was necessary in order to identify sufficient
numbers of patients in the top and bottom risk
quartiles (`higher' and `lower' diabetes genetic
risk) for the more resource-intensive Phase 2.
Participants found to have `average' diabetes
genetic risk results after genotyping were excluded
from Phase 2. These individuals received their
diabetes genetic test results directly from the
principal investigator and were advised to follow
up with their primary care physicians to address
modifiable risk factors.
Study schema--Phase 2
Participants allocated to Phase 2 included the
`higher' and `lower' diabetes genetic risk result
recipients (intervention patients) and the
untested controls. These patients returned for a
second research visit once genotyping was com-
pleted (3­4 weeks after first research visit). At this
visit, intervention patients received their diabetes
genetic risk results and underwent a 15-min
individual diabetes genetic risk counseling ses-
sion. After the counseling session, intervention
patients completed the repeat survey and were
scheduled for the 12-week diabetes prevention
course. Control patients attending the second
research visit completed the repeat survey and
were scheduled for the 12-week prevention
course. In the weeks following completion of
the curriculum, participants returned for their
third and final research visit and completed the
third survey. Thus, apart from the diabetes
genetic risk counseling session, intervention and
control patients in Phase 2 received identical
exposure to diabetes risk education and to study
staff over the approximately 4 months of their
study participation.
Creating a diabetes genetic risk score
For the GC/LC Study we used 36 validated single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) independently
associated with T2D [13]. At each locus, an

individual can have 0, 1, or 2 risk-associated alleles.
We created a single diabetes genotype risk score by
summing up the total number of risk alleles (range
0­72). Prior research has shown that for risk
ranking simple summing provides substantially
similar results as various approaches that weight
individual alleles according to effect size [21].
To calculate each participant's diabetes genetic
risk status, we first determined relative diabetes
genetic risks based on the Framingham Offspring
Study. This longitudinal cohort with biennial
research visits represents a well-phenotyped popu-
lation similar to the patients in our clinical network
[13,22]. After excluding patients with diabetes at
baseline, there were 3471 genotyped individuals in
the Framingham Offspring Study who were fol-
lowed for a mean of 8.2 (Æ 1.0) years in whom 446
cases of diabetes were diagnosed [13]. Among
patients with genotype risk scores > 38 (`higher'
risk), 17.9% developed diabetes (46% relative
increase compared to `average' risk, scores 34­38).
Among patients with genotype risk scores < 34
(``lower'' risk), 9.9% developed diabetes (18% rela-
tive decrease compared to `average' risk patients).
The `higher' and `lower' groups each comprised
approximately 25% of the genotyped population
(Table 1). These results were unchanged when the
analysis was restricted to participants meeting
criteria for MetS (n ¼ 1263).
For the GC/LC Study, we provided our study
participants with an overall estimate of their risk
for developing diabetes that combined their known
phenotypic risk (based on MetS) with their mea-
sured genetic risk (derived from the Framingham
Offspring Study data). Phenotypic risk for our study
cohort was determined using data from our own
hospital primary care practices [20]. Based on an
analysis of 3-year diabetes incidence among
patients with MetS, we estimated an 11% risk of
developing diabetes over the next 3 years for our
overall study population. Applying the relative
risks determined using the Framingham Offspring
Study data (46% relative increase for the `higher'
and 18% relative decrease for the `lower' risk
groups), we estimated that patients with `higher'
genetic risk results had a 3-year diabetes risk of 17%
and patients with `lower' genetic risk results had a
3-year diabetes risk of 9%.
Mendelian randomization and post-randomization
allocation
Since roughly 50% of genotyped individuals fall
within the relatively narrow numeric range of
`average' genetic risk, we chose a post-randomiza-
tion allocation strategy that excluded `average'
genetic risk patients in order to substantially
reduce the size and cost of Phase 2 (two further
research visits and the 12-week diabetes prevention
group sessions) without reducing the trial's power
to test our two study hypotheses. The rationale for
this post-randomization allocation was based on
the concept of `Mendelian randomization.'
In classic clinical trial design, post-randomiza-
tion allocation to study arm is forbidden because
the criteria used for allocation may introduce
confounding and thereby undermine the benefit
of randomization. Mendelian randomization is a
term coined to describe the concept that a given
individual's genotype represents the random allo-
cation of paternal and maternal alleles [23]. This
concept has been used to support observational
data analyses [24­26]. The GC/LC Study represents
one of the first examples of this concept being used
to increase the efficiency of a randomized trial.
Since the genetic factors (in this case, alleles
associated with diabetes) are not believed to be
causally associated with the primary study out-
comes (such as program attendance behavior), the
diabetes genotype risk score acts as an instrumental
variable that was assigned randomly at gametogen-
esis. In this context, post-randomization allocation
to study arm does not undermine the random
allocation of risk SNPs within study arms.
Design of genetic counseling intervention
The goals of the 15-min genetic counseling session
were to explain the basic concept of genetic testing,
present participants with their diabetes genotype
score, and explain how their test results modified
their phenotypically estimated risk. Participants
received a one-page printed report that listed their
results for each SNP tested and their total score. The
score was also interpreted as conveying `higher' or
`lower' diabetes genetic risk. This report was used as

the basis for `personalized' diabetes genetic risk
counseling. To graphically represent risk to the
intervention patients, we first presented a diagram
to illustrate the combined influence of genetic
(non-modifiable) and environmental (modifiable)
factors. The added risk information generated from
the genetic testing results was communicated to
patients using the visual concept of a balance scale,
in which the individual's 3-year absolute diabetes
risk was either increased or decreased based on the
additional information provided by their diabetes
genetic risk assessment (for example, the scale
tipped from 11% absolute 3-year risk to 17%
absolute risk among patients with `higher' genetic
risk results). The initial development of the coun-
seling session and visual materials was piloted using
cognitive interviews with individuals who would
have met eligibility criteria for the main study [27].
A key ethical consideration in our intervention
development was that the diabetes genetic risk
counseling session should be designed to avoid
discouraging phenotypically and genetically high-
risk patients from participating in a diabetes pre-
vention program. Thus, the genetic counseling
intervention had to be structured so that both
`higher' and `lower' diabetes genetic risk result
recipients would be motivated to make behavior
changes. Accordingly, `higher' diabetes risk result
disclosure focused on the need to adopt lifestyle
changes to counterbalance the increased diabetes
genetic risk, whereas `lower' diabetes risk result
disclosure emphasized the greater relative contri-
bution of modifiable, non-genetic risk factors to
the individual's overall risk for diabetes. The goal
was to avoid discouraging `higher' diabetes risk
recipients who might feel a sense of genetic fatal-
ism while avoiding in `lower' diabetes genetic
risk recipients the sense of being protected from
developing diabetes [28].
Choice of study outcomes
For rigorous assessment of the efficacy of the
genetic testing and counseling, all participants in
Phase 2 were enrolled into a 12-week Group
Lifestyle Balance diabetes prevention curriculum
modeled after the Diabetes Prevention Program.
This format was developed by Seidel et al. and first
implemented in patients with MetS [29]. The cur-
riculum provided educational content (such as
identifying healthy eating habits, planning an exer-
cise program) and also used motivational tools
(dietary logs, weekly weigh-ins) to initiate behavior
changes associated with diabetes prevention. Each
12-week program was conducted by clinical staff
who were unaware of participants' genetic risk test
results. Although we could not blind patients to
their randomization status--genetic testing or no
testing--we instructed the group session educators
to request that participants did not disclose their
results to the group. To assess the adequacy of
masking, we asked the group leaders to predict
allocation status for all group participants after
completion of the 12-week curriculum.
Our primary study outcomes were the number of
12-week program sessions attended (behavior) and
changes in self-reported readiness to adopt the
behavioral changes recommended by the diabetes
prevention program (motivation). Secondary out-
comes included objective measures of weight
change before and after the 12-week session and
number of weekly exercise and dietary log books
turned in during the 12-week session.
Surveys administered at the baseline and
follow-up research visits included: Diabetes Risk
Perception [30], Stage of Change for a Low Fat Diet
[31], Stage of Change for Exercise [32], and Stage of
Change for Weight Loss [33]. The three Stage of
Change instruments are each validated measures
designed to assess motivation by classifying respon-
dents into one of five stages (precontemplation,
contemplation, preparation, action, or mainte-
nance) for each of the three behavioral domains
(following a low-fat diet, exercising, and losing
weight) related to diabetes prevention. For exam-
ple, the Stage of Change for Exercise instrument
asks: `Please describe your current exercise behav-
ior,' with five choices [Currently, I do not exercise
and I do not intend to start exercising in the next 6
months; Currently, I do not exercise but I am
thinking about starting to exercise in the next 6
months; Currently, I exercise some but not regu-
larly; Currently, I exercise regularly but I have only
begun doing so within the last 6 months; and
Currently, I exercise regularly and have done so for
longer than 6 months] corresponding to the five
stages of change.
Sample size and power calculation
A sample size of 90 participants (30 `higher', 30
`lower' diabetes genetic risk and 30 controls) was
planned to allow sufficient power to demonstrate
clinically meaningful results across both behavioral
and self-reported outcomes of interest. Based on
the prior experience of our diabetes center in
delivering 12-week diabetes prevention courses,
we also accounted for a 10% loss-to-follow-up rate
when calculating power. Assuming the mean
number of visits among controls was 8.5 based on
prior experience at our center (unpublished data)
and the standard deviation was 2, the study was of
sufficient sample size to detect a 20% difference
(1.7 difference in number of visits between

comparison groups) with 97% power with two-
sided probability of 0.05 or less. The change in
motivation for each patient was categorized as
increased, no change, and decreased, based on
responses to each of the three Stages of Change
instruments (low fat diet, exercise, weight loss). The
study had 90% power to show a difference between
55% positive change vs 90% positive change in
motivation between arms and 80% power to show a
difference between 60% positive change vs 90%
positive change in motivation.
Given the relatively small study size, our analysis
plan included provision to control for any differ-
ences in baseline characteristics using multivariate
modeling when examining outcomes by allocation
status.
Discussion
We had to address both ethical and logistic design
considerations when implementing a randomized
trial of diabetes genetic risk testing and counseling
among patients at increased phenotypic risk for
type 2 diabetes.
Although there are no published clinical trials
of diabetes genetic risk testing, several prior stud-
ies have examined whether family history can
motivate lifestyle change. These small studies
focused on intermediate or surrogate endpoints
and have shown mixed results [6,34,35]. Because
individuals perceive `personal' genetic risk differ-
ently to their family history [27], it was important
to assess the impact of such testing using a rigorous
controlled study design. Moreover, unlike family
history, where the response is either `yes' (with
varying degrees of increased risk) or `no' (perceived
as `no increased risk'), diabetes genetic risk test-
ing can return not only `increased' but also
`decreased' risk results. For this reason, we deter-
mined that it was necessary to assess both the
potential benefit (improved motivation) and
potential risk (false reassurance or genetic fatalism)
from such testing.
In designing our study, we made the following
important decisions with the goal of maximizing
the validity and generalizability of our results:
1) We randomized to genetic testing vs no genetic
testing to capture the most relevant clinical
question, which is: `Among patients willing to
be tested, will testing have a clinical impact?'
2) We separately evaluated the impact of `higher'
and `lower' diabetes genetic risk results relative
to the untested controls to disentangle the
potentially counteracting impact of these differ-
ent results on the overall impact of testing.
3) We used post-randomization allocation justified
by the concept of Mendelian randomization to
efficiently exclude nearly 50% of tested patients
with `average' results from the resource-inten-
sive Phase 2.
4) We created a clinically implementable diabetes
relative risk score based on the most up-to-date
set of genetic variants associated with type 2
diabetes as of July 2010. This was achieved
by combining relative genetic risk calculated
from a finely phenotyped research cohort
(Framingham) with a phenotypic risk estima-
tion calculated from the clinical population
from which research patients were recruited.
5) We created a genetic counseling intervention
that in its relative brevity and explicit commu-
nication goals is responsive to the time demands
and limited resources that would be expected in
the real world setting.
6) We tailored our genetic counseling intervention
so as not to undermine motivation in patients at
high phenotypic risk for diabetes.
Randomized clinical trials have convincingly
shown that increased physical activity and dietary
modifications leading to sustained weight loss sig-
nificantly reduce diabetes risk among patients with
pre-diabetes or MetS. However, successful clinical
implementation of these lifestyle changes has been
limited. Given the ongoing diabetes epidemic,
interventions to increase adoption of healthy life-
style changes among high risk patients are urgently
needed. In this `dawn of the genomic era' [36,37], it
is imperative to establish the evidence base to guide
the clinical application of genetic testing for
common chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes
[38] given the rise of direct-to-consumer advertising
by commercial companies [39], the eagerness with
which many clinicians embrace new technology,
and the increased cost of additional testing. The GC/
LC Study was designed to begin establishing this
evidence base for future practice.
