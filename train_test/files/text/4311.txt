Children and adolescents who greatly deviate from societal
expectations for age appropriate behavior are part of every
community. Such children may be considered to have an
emotional or behavioral disorder, usually categorized either
using the classification system of the schools or the mental
health system. The Individuals With Disabilities Education
Improvement Act (IDEIA), 2004, 20 U.S.C. § 1401 (3)(A)(i)
defines emotional disturbance by both the presence of mal-
adaptive behavior and negative educational impact as crite-
ria. Descriptors of the disability include an inability to learn
that cannot be explained by other factors; an inability to
build satisfactory relationships with peers and teachers; inap-
propriate behavior or feelings under normal circumstances; a
general pervasive mood of unhappiness or depression; and
the tendency to develop physical symptoms or fears associ-
ated with school or personal problems, 34 C.F.R. § 300.8(c)
(4)(i)(A-E). In order for a student to be found eligible for an
Individualized Educational Plan (IEP), at least one of the
indicators must be present, must be serious, extend over
time, and have a negative impact on the child's educational
progress. In contrast, mental health professionals utilize the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th
ed., text rev.; DSM-IV-TR;American PsychiatricAssociation,
2000) to classify children with mental disorders. The DSM-
IV-TR system is multiaxial covering a broader range of diag-
noses, including severity levels and etiology, than IDEIA.
As schools and mental health organizations use different
classification systems to identify children who need their
respective services, it is therefore possible for children who
have a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis to be found ineligible for
school-based special education services due to the absence of
a negative impact on educational progress. It is very difficult
to separate the literature clearly based on the distinct but
overlapping nosological systems. The relevant difference
when discussing education outcomes is the IDEIA require-
ment that emotional or behavioral problems have a negative
impact on educational achievement. While it is true that
schools are bound by law to use the IDEIA definitions, it is
also true that children with emotional problems not covered
by IDEIA exist. For the purpose of this study, both children
with emotional and behavioral disabilities classified by
either IDEIA or the DSM series will be referred to as children
with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD).
Notwithstanding identification by IDEIA of some chil-
dren and adolescents who have significant mental health
concerns, there remain unmet needs of children and adoles-
cents with behavior problems in schools who are either iden-
tified by DSM criteria alone or are not identified at all. The

Adult Outcomes for Children and
Adolescents With EBD: Understanding
Parents' Perspectives
Martha Ellen Wynne1, Ashley E. Ausikaitis1, and Mary Satchwell1
Abstract
Little is known about the adult outcomes for children with an emotional/behavioral disorder (EBD). The present study
examines the perspectives of 34 parents regarding the adult outcomes for their children who experienced emotional and
behavioral problems in their youth. Participants completed an online survey containing questions about their child's behavioral
characteristics, educational experiences, and adjustment to adulthood as well as questions about the stress they experienced
as a parent of a child with EBD. Both quantitative and qualitative measures were used to assess parents' perceptions of factors
affecting their child's successful or unsuccessful adult outcomes. Remaining in school was related to positive adult outcomes,
while exclusionary disciplinary experiences such as suspension and expulsion were related to negative adult outcomes.
The relationship of results to the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act's goals for adult functioning and
implications for both parents and practitioners serving students with EBD are discussed.

prevalence of mental health problems serious enough to war-
rant a DSM diagnosis in children and adolescents is 25% and
between 3% and 17% actually are diagnosed as having a
serious emotional disturbance (Costello, Egger, & Angold,
2005; Roberts, Roberts, & Wenyaw, 2009). However, less
than 1% of the population of school-aged youth receive spe-
cial education services for EBD (Planty et al., 2008).
It is the goal of all public education to promote the healthy
social development and academic achievement of students
so that children will grow into independent, productive, law-
abiding, and contributing members of society (Brighouse,
2006; Public Schools of North Carolina State Board of
Education, n.d.; Rothstein & Jacobsen, 2006, 2009). While
families from diverse cultures and socioeconomic levels may
interpret independence or economic productivity differently
within their cultural context, broadly stated, all groups
endorse transitioning from childhood dependence to assum-
ing an adult role in the culture. These same goals for transi-
tion to adulthood have been recognized for children with
disabilities, and these universal goals were made explicit in
the most recent reauthorization of IDEIA. However, despite
progress since the passage of initial federal special education
legislation in 1975, students with disabilities have lagged
behind typically developing peers in achieving adult inde-
pendence. In recognition of this situation, Congressional
findings in the preamble to the 2004 reauthorization of
Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) reaffirm
and reinforce that the purpose of Special Education is to pre-
pare students for "further education, employment, and inde-
pendent living," 20 U.S.C. § 1400(d)(1)(A). In addition,
Congress noted that "providing effective transition services
to promote successful post-school employment or education
is an important measure of accountability for children with
disabilities" 20 U.S.C. § 1400(c)(14).
Although these goals historically have been present in
law, the 2004 reauthorization put particular emphasis on
transition services to improve overall outcomes in these
areas. Much previous research has focused on single out-
come measures that report graduation rates (U. S. Department
of Education, 2008) or employment outcomes (Zigmond,
2006), rather than multidimensional measures of adult func-
tioning (K. H. Armstrong, Dedrick, & Greenbaum, 2003).
The aforementioned research has led to a general consensus
that outcomes for EBD students in young adulthood are not
positive, confirming the necessity of Congressional intent to
strengthen transition services to improve adult functioning in
the community through postsecondary education, employ-
ment, and independent living.
Although disability legislation under IDEIA includes
transition services for students with EBD by teaching skills
needed for independent functioning in young adulthood,
nevertheless, the educational experiences that these students
receive often are negative. Since the passage of the Safe
Schools Act of 1994 (20 U.S.C. 5961), exclusionary prac-
tices such as suspension and expulsion increasingly have
been used as schools adopt "zero tolerance" approaches to
discipline. Such practices have been found to be arbitrarily
delivered in many cases and to be used disproportionately
often for children with disabilities and minority students,
particularly African American males (Aud, KewalRamani, &
Frohlich, 2011; Skiba, 2002; Skiba, Eckes, & Brown, 2010;
Skiba & Rausch, 2006). For example, 47% of students with
EBD have been suspended or expelled in elementary or mid-
dle school, while 73% have been suspended or expelled in
high school (SRI International, 2006; Wagner, Kutash,
Duchnowski, Epstein, & Sumi, 2005). In comparison, in
2005, the U.S. expulsion rate for general education students
in grades K-12 was estimated at 2.1 per 1,000 students
(0.21%; Gilliam, 2005). Considering high school students
alone, more recent data indicated the overall expulsion rate
for general education students is approximately 3% (Stillwell,
Sable, & Plotts, 2011) whereas for high school students with
EBD, the rate is 73% (Wagner et al., 2006).
Students affected by these and other negative school
experiences are more likely to drop out before comple-
ting high school, and students with EBDs have been found
to have the highest drop-out rate (55.9%) among stud-
ents receiving special education or general education (U.S.
Department of Education, 2003; U.S. Department of
Education, Office of Special Education Programs, 2007).
Approximately 61% of students labeled EBD drop out of
school and only 32% graduate compared to 75% of students
graduating nationally in the United States (U.S. Department
of Education, 2004, 2008; U.S. Public Health Service,
2001). Furthermore, high-stakes testing mandated by the
No Child Left Behind Act of 2002 was predicted to con-
tinue to increase the overall drop-out rate (Schargel, 2003,
2011) and that has indeed been borne out by other research-
ers (McNeil, Coppola, Radigan, & Vasquez Heilig, 2008).
In 2001, nearly 45% of the one million individuals taking
the General Educational Development (GED) high school
equivalency test self-reported mental health concerns as
contributing to their school failure and dropping out (Koller
& Bertel, 2006). Historically, relatively few students with
EBD have gone on to postsecondary education (Rogers &
Rogers, 2001) and this trend appears to be continuing, with
approximately one third of students with mental health
problems pursuing any postsecondary educational program,
20% enrolling in 2-year community colleges and fewer
than 6% entering 4-year colleges according to the National
Longitudinal Transition Study­2 (Government
Accountability Office [GAO], 2008; Wagner et al., 2005).
Other postschool outcomes are also poor for students with
EBD. There are high rates of unstable employment, unem-
ployment, poverty, restricted social networks in the commu-
nity, and criminal behavior in students with EBD who do not
continue to postsecondary education (Bradley, Doolittle, &
Bartolotta, 2008; Janz & Banbury, 2009; Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration, 2008). When
students with EBD reach the age at which transition to
Wynne et al. 3
adulthood begins, their rates of substance abuse and criminal
activity rise to well above the norm as has been shown for
over a decade (Greenbaum et al., 1996; Janz & Banbury,
2009; Wald & Losen, 2003).
As two decades of research indicate, children and ado-
lescents with EBD have both negative school experiences
and poor young adult outcomes despite normal or near-
normal cognitive functioning. To improve outcomes for
students who have experienced severe problems in school,
home­school­community collaboration is even more
important than it is for typical students according to the
National Association of School Psychologists (NASP;
Quinn & Lee, 2007). In addition, major U.S. initiatives
have long recognized the crucial role parental involvement
plays in improving schools in both general and special
education settings (No Child Left Behind Act, 2002; Sailor,
2002) and this continues to be true (K. J. Anderson &
Minke, 2007; Mandell & Murray, 2009). However, in order
for effective parent­school partnerships and collaboration
to develop, trust and nurturance are essential. Trust is nec-
essary for the home­school relationship to flourish; while
nurturance involves treating all team members with
warmth and recognizing the unique expertise that each
brings to the table. A nurturing communication style is
devoid of judgment and negative stereotyping between
school and community partners (Eagle, Dowd-Eagle, &
Sheridan, 2008). For parents to trust school professionals
they must feel that school professionals understand their
unique perspectives and experiences with their children.
Unfortunately, parents of students with EBD may be
avoidant of contact with the school because past interactions
may have been contentious and challenging (Wang, Dishion,
Stormshak, & Willett, 2011). Although accusations are coun-
terproductive and raise tension, professionals tend to blame
parents for children's behavior problems (Hinshaw, 2005) to
such a degree that as a group, parents of children with EBD
are viewed unidimensionally as either inadequate caregivers
or directly contributory to their children's problems (Home,
2008; Northey, Wells, Silverman, & Bailey, 2003). However,
little research has examined the ecological impact a child
with EBD has on the family and the family's functioning
(Wang et al., 2011). Children and adolescents who fit either
the IDEIA or DSM definitions of emotional and behavioral
problems present challenging behavior problems for their
parents (M. I. Armstrong, Birnie-Lefcovitch, & Ungar, 2005;
Olive & Liu, 2005). Parents of a child with EBD experience
extra strain (Scharlach et al., 2006; Taylor-Richardson,
Heflinger, & Brown, 2006), more challenges in meeting both
family and work demands (Rosenzweig, Brennan, & Ogilvie,
2002), and more parenting stress than parents of normally
developing children (M. I. Armstrong et al., 2005; Williford,
Calkins, & Keane, 2007).
Furthermore, studies have shown that children with
emotional and behavioral problems are costly to raise and
educate, for society in general, and presumably, for parents
as well (Cohen, Miller, & Rossman, 1994; Loeber, Burke,
Lahey, Winters, & Zera, 2000). For example, more than 12
years ago Cohen (1998) found that the cost to society of a
single high-risk youth dropping out of school and engaging
in criminal behavior ranged between US$1.7 and US$2.3
million dollars; this figure would be approximately US$2.4
to US$3.3 million in 2012. In comparison with other
disabilities, emotional and behavioral problems are the
most expensive concerns to treat in North America (J. A.
Anderson, McIntyre, Rotto, & Robertson, 2002; Bradley
et al., 2008); and use of public services throughout youth
and adulthood by children with behavior problems is 10
times higher than for children with no conduct problems
(Foster & Jones, 2005). Studies show that in addition to
relational and overall stress, having a child with an emo-
tional disability includes significant economic burden (M. I.
Armstrong et al., 2005). Low-income families are particu-
larly vulnerable to out of pocket expenses for their child
with emotional disabilities (Newacheck, Inkelas, & Kim,
2004). In addition to creating an economic burden on the
family, perceived financial strain also has a negative impact
on children across many domains, including use of positive
parenting practices, a child's self-esteem (Reichman,
Corman, & Noonan, 2008), use of mental health services
(Brannan, Heflinger, & Foster, 2003; Costello, Compton,
Keeler, & Angold, 2003), and increased behavioral prob-
lems including impulsivity, antisocial behavior, and depres-
sion (Ryan, Boxmeyer, & Lochman, 2009; Wadsworth,
Raviv, Compas, & Connor-Smith, 2005). These relation-
ships between perceived financial strain and negative out-
comes apply to families across all-income levels.
Parents are charged with the primary responsibility of car-
ing for their children. Federal law as delineated by the
Supreme Court of the United States regards parents as the
first and best advocates for their children (Winkelman v.
Parma City School District, 2007), but many school person-
nel view parents of students with EBD as difficult to work
with and often blame them for their children's problems
(Hinshaw, 2005; Home, 2008). Children spend most of their
time in school with teachers or at home with parents and par-
ents have valuable information that is necessary to gain a
broader understanding of the child. According to both IDEIA
(2004) and independent research on home­school collabora-
tion, parents should have an equal role in decision-making
processes for effective home­school collaboration to achieve
positive outcomes for children (Christenson & Thurlow,
2004). If children are having problems in school, home­
school collaboration is even more important than for typi-
cally developing children (Quinn & Lee, 2007). Therefore,
gaining the parents' perspective is invaluable to education
professionals serving children with EBD.
Research has not examined parent perspectives on out-
comes for adult children with EBD in regard to achieving
IDEIA transition goals. The IDEIA goals of postsecondary
education, independent living, and financial independence
4 SAGE Open
are realistically attainable for this population, more so than
for children with severe cognitive and physical disabilities.
Little attention has been given to whether or not children
with EBD do achieve these goals as young adults, the degree
of caregiving strain experienced by parents while raising
children with EBD, the relationship between parental finan-
cial strain and young adult outcome, and parent attributions
relating to their children's success or lack of success as
adults. In addition, as much of the literature on children with
EBD explicitly addresses low­socioeconomic status (SES)
families, it is important to consider the experiences of par-
ents who had adequate access to financial resources for child
rearing to filter out the direct effects of poverty on attainment
of IDEIA goals. This study examines the relationship
between adult outcomes for children with EBD and IDEIA
transition goals, as well as parental strain, financial impact,
and parental attributions of their child's adult outcome for
families who are not beset by a large number of social and
economic problems
Research Questions
Research Questions 1: How do adult children's outcomes
compare with IDEIA goals of post­high school educa-
tion, employment, and independent living from the
parents' perspective?
Research Questions 2: How stressful do parents find car-
ing for a child/adolescent with emotional and behav-
ioral problems at differing ages?
Research Questions 3: Does perceived parental financial
strain affect the child's adult outcome?
Research Questions 4: To what do parents attribute their
adult child's success or lack of success?
Method
Participant Characteristics
Participants included 34 parents of children 18 or older who
experienced moderate to severe emotional or behavioral
problems in childhood or adolescence. The respondents were
overwhelmingly female, with 31 females and 3 males, 85%
Caucasian, and had a median age range of 50 to 55 years.
The parents' median educational level fell within the "col-
lege graduate" range and 7 of the respondents received grad-
uate or professional degrees. During their children's school
years, the SES of the respondents was more normally distrib-
uted than education, with 28% of respondents describing
themselves as working class or below, 36% as middle class,
and 28% as upper-middle class, with 8% as "very poor/
unemployed." By the time the child graduated from high
school, 28% described themselves as working class or below,
30% as middle class, and 42% as upper-middle class with no
respondent endorsing "very poor/unemployed."
Sampling Procedures
Recruitment of parents of children with EBD for research is
particularly challenging due to the stigma associated with this
disability. It can be difficult for researchers to locate adequate
samples of adults who experienced EBD as children/adoles-
cents or their parents. Having an "invisible disability," the
stigma of mental illness, and negative stereotyping of parents
of children with EBD (Marsh, 2004) contribute to the diffi-
culty in finding participants for follow-up studies. The devel-
opment of online support forums for parents of children with
EBD created a space where family members could communi-
cate with others with similar child-rearing experiences away
from the judgment of the public eye. The existence of these
forums also gave researchers access to a national pool of par-
ticipants that heretofore would have been very difficult to
contact. There are advantages to studying parents who are
online support group members including wide geographic
sampling frame, anonymity, and ease of data collection
through online survey techniques.
Because the numbers of parents of adults who experi-
enced emotional and behavioral problems as children is a
small part of the population of parents of all children with
disabilities, invitations were posted on three online parent
forums frequented by parents of children, adolescents, and
young adults with emotional and behavioral problems to
recruit participants. The anonymity of both the participants
and the names of the websites was guaranteed to obtain the
approval of both the website owners and the institutional
review board (IRB) at the sponsoring university. Participants
volunteered by clicking on an active link on an invitation that
took them to the consent form approved by the IRB. Upon
accepting the terms of the consent, the participants were
directed to the anonymous survey.As parent participants vol-
unteered for inclusion in the study by completing a survey,
and because the number of parents with qualifying children
who visited the support group sites during the 30 days the
survey was available is unknown, there is no way to calculate
the response rate for the survey. Furthermore, as with all
anonymous surveys, there is no way to verify that nonre-
sponders are comparable with responders.
Parents rated their adult children on many dimensions,
including their perception of whether the child's transition to
adulthood was successful or unsuccessful (description
below). To be included in this study, an adult child must have
been rated in the highest two categories (successful/extremely
successful) or in the lowest two categories (unsuccessful/
extremely unsuccessful) on the 7-point index and have con-
gruent parental verbal descriptions of the adult child's cur-
rent status. As there were 17 parents who rated their adult
child in the successful groups and 43 who rated their child in
the unsuccessful groups, 17 were randomly drawn by com-
puter from the 43 in the unsuccessful groups to provide a
total sample size of 34 parents.

Measures and Constructs
Survey Instrument. The measures below were operational-
ized in a survey particularly designed to address the
research questions in this study. In addition to the indices
described below, parents also provided information
regarding their adult child's type of education--general
or special; presence of a behavior intervention plan; high-
est educational level completed; parent rating of child
behavior; presence of DSM diagnoses; and mental health
services obtained by parents outside of school settings. In
addition, parents supplied demographic information
about themselves. Parents rated their child's behavior at
three separate stages, including preschool, elementary/
middle school, and high school, to detect differences
throughout the child's development. The Caregiver Strain
Questionnaire (CGSQ) was included in its entirety,
although in the survey document, it was presented to
respondents as a matrix that was not designated by spe-
cific name to avoid bias.
Definition of "Successful" and "Unsuccessful."The revision of
IDEIA in 2004 highlights the importance of students in spe-
cial education pursuing the same goals of postsecondary
education, employment, and independent living as typical
young adults. Not only are these goals applicable to students
in general and special education, but they also largely tran-
scend racial, cultural, and language differences in that chang-
ing one's status from that of a dependent child to an
independent adult is not only present in groups within the
United States but also internationally (Arnett, 2001).
Although the exact formulation of "success" might vary
across groups, in the United States, most parents hope their
children will complete their education, obtain employment,
and assume adult functions commensurate with their abili-
ties. Therefore, achieving the goals of postsecondary educa-
tion, employment, and independent living in some form may
be assumed to be part of a parental definition of "successful"
transition to adulthood; however, for young adults with
childhood EBD, it was unknown what definitions of being
"successful" adults their parents would hold. Experienced
parents should be able to determine their child's attainment
of various developmental milestones that mark adulthood
and are encompassed by IDEIA goals within the context of
the severity of the adult's child/adolescent problems and
their own cultural expectations. Given the belief that parents
are valuable sources of information about their child's over-
all functioning, their subjective ratings and open-ended
descriptions of their child's success or lack of success were
obtained. We wanted parents to evaluate their adult child's
adjustment to adulthood with "all things considered" because
no a priori list of criteria or examples of success or lack of
success would be universally applicable to this very diverse
sample of adults who experienced EBD as children. An
implicit purpose of this study was to determine how a
"successful" adult or an "unsuccessful" adult with childhood
EBD is described from the perspective of the child's parent.
To address this aim in a comprehensive manner, three types
of parent measures of successful and unsuccessful adjust-
ment to adulthood were used: a 7-point index that ranged
from "extremely successful" to "extremely unsuccessful," a
dichotomous forced choice (successful­unsuccessful), and a
qualitative narrative question that was used to verify what
parents meant by "success" or "lack of success" and to what
they attributed their child's successful or unsuccessful adult
outcome.
The CGSQ.The CGSQ (Brannan, Heflinger, & Bickman,
1997) contains 21 items. The responses range from 1 (not at
all a problem) to 5 (very much a problem). To account for
possible differences in the strain at various times in the
child's development, parents were asked to rate their child at
three ages: preschool, elementary/middle school, and high
school. An aggregated mean score was obtained for each par-
ent based on their recollection of stress throughout the child's
development. The CGSQ has been factor analyzed, and the
resulting indices were evaluated for internal consistency in
this sample using Cronbach's alpha. Consistent with the lit-
erature, high Cronbach's alpha measures were obtained. The
alphas, means, and standard deviations for the factors are as
follows: Objective Caregiver Strain,  = .94, x = 3.26, SD =
.928; Internalized Subjective Strain,  = .88, x = 3.15, SD =
.946; and Externalized Subjective Strain,  = .80, x = 2.04,
SD = 1.017. In addition to the three factors identified by
Brannan et al. (1997), a fourth index was constructed to mea-
sure financial stain using two items from the CGSQ related
to financial consequences of caring for a child with behavior
problems (4. Family member having to do without things;
and 7. Financial strain). This index, which yielded an  = .89,
x = 2.26, SD = 1.085, was constructed in response to the
unanticipated very high level of parent purchased mental
health services and was analyzed separately from the original
indices.
Educational Attainment.Parents were asked to report their
child's highest grade completed; whether the child com-
pleted high school, and if so, whether a diploma or GED was
obtained; and whether their child had pursued any postsec-
ondary education. The responses were coded into three cat-
egories: dropping out of school before graduation, completing
high school, and attaining postsecondary education.
Employment Status.Employment was coded as "full-time,"
"part-time," or "unemployed." In the qualitative data, there
were apparent differences in the meaning of "unemployed"
with some parents characterizing their adult child as cur-
rently (but temporarily) unemployed while others indicated
that unemployment was a chronic state in which the adult
child was "unemployable." However, for quantitative analy-
ses, these were combined into one category.
6 SAGE Open
Index of Positive Activity. To capture the wide range of experi-
ences described by parents for quantitative data analyses, an
index was created to include both postsecondary education
and employment in a single measure of the degree to which
these adults were "positively occupying" their time. Those
who were working full-time, attending school full-time, or
attending school at least part-time while working at least
part-time were considered to be fully positively occupied.
Those adult children who were only working part-time, only
attending school part-time, or were stay-at-home parents
without part-time employment were considered to be par-
tially positively occupied. Finally, those who were unem-
ployed, not attending school, incarcerated, or whose
whereabouts were unknown were considered to be not posi-
tively occupied.
Residential Status. Responses detailing an adult child's living
situation were coded as being independent, dependent on the
parent, dependent on others, or a negative residential out-
come. Parents who described their child as paying his or her
own rent were coded as independent; those who stated that
their child lived with them and did not contribute to costs of
living were coded as dependent on their parent; those who
stated that their child lived with a spouse, significant other,
or roommate and did not contribute to costs of living were
coded as dependent on others; while those who specified that
their adult child was homeless, incarcerated, transient living
with peers and abusing substances, or whose location was
unknown were coded as a negative residential outcome.
Financial Independence. Parents indicated whether their child
was totally financially independent; partially independent
and receiving minor assistance (from them, a spouse, or from
another individual), partially independent and receiving
major assistance (from them, a spouse, another individual, or
from Social Security Supplementary Income [SSI]); or
whether the child was totally dependent on the parent or the
state.
Index of Independent Living. This index combined residential
living situation and financial independence to create a single
measure of attainment of two important IDEIA goals for
adult independence. All degrees of residential status and
financial independence were assigned weights which were
combined to yield a 7-point scale ranging from totally depen-
dent to totally independent. Each adult child was assigned a
score on the resulting 7-point scale to represent his or her
overall adult independence.
Study Design
Various methodologies have been used to attempt to ass-
ess outcomes, including prospective longitudinal, cross-
sectional, and retrospective methods. Prospective designs are
superior but generally, they are not feasible due to high
attrition rates, residential mobility of the sample, cost, and
time; therefore, retrospective studies have been utilized
despite methodological limitations (Brewin, Andrews, &
Gotlib, 1993). For the present study, a retrospective approach
was selected.
The design technique of using online surveys is advanta-
geous for accessing individuals who may otherwise not vol-
unteer to participate in a study dealing with sensitive
information (McCabe, 2004; Pealer, Weiler, Pigg, Miller, &
Dorman, 2001; Tourangeau, Couper, & Steiger, 2001). A fur-
ther advantage of online surveys is that they often produce
more candid answers than intrusive methods such as face-to-
face interviewing (Kiernan, Kiernan, Oyler, & Gilles, 2005;
Olsen, Wygant, & Brown, 2004). In this study, parents were
able to participate anonymously, which may have allowed
them to feel more comfortable discussing their children's dif-
ficult problems than otherwise would have been the case
(Colvin, Chenoweth, Bold, & Harding, 2004).

Preliminary Analyses.To clarify parent perceptions of the
behavior of their developing child, they were asked prelimi-
nary questions about their child's behavior at ages 3 to 5.
Despite clear differences in parental ratings of adult adjust-
ment, as young children, these adults were equally problem-
atic in many areas of functioning, and no statistically
significant differences were found. The successful and
unsuccessful groups were equivalent on the following early
childhood measures of severity indicating that both groups
had significant emotional or behavioral problems by school
entry: presence of DSM diagnosis, age at which problematic
behaviors were first noticed by the respondent, attendance in
general prekindergarten programs, and their need for or use
of early intervention services. The common behavior prob-
lems in both samples included opposition and defiance at
home, mood swings, "meltdowns," anxiety, specific fears
and phobias, overdependence for age, and language delays.
Therefore, these groups appear to be appropriately matched
to make comparisons in their outcomes as adults.
Demographic Analyses.Demographic information for the
adult children is depicted in Table 1. The majority of the
sample of adult children is below age 25 and ranges from 18
to above 35, with a mean of 23 years, and a median of 21
years. When compared with the male­female distribution in
the general population, the sample contains an excess of
females (61.8%) which was found to be statistically signifi-
cantly different from the general population. However, as the
number of boys with emotional and behavioral problems
exceeds the number of girls (Baillargeon et al., 2007; Lahey
et al., 1999; Wagner et al., 2005; Zoccolillo, 1993) the excess
of girls in the sample does not reflect the underlying
Wynne et al. 7
population. This may be due to the fact that, in this sample,
females were more likely than males to be rated as successful
and all individuals rated as either "successful" or "very suc-
cessful" were included in analyses. The adult children are
slightly more diverse than their parents but the children also
are predominantly Caucasian. Despite majority racial status
of both parents and adult children and most parents reporting
at least adequate financial resources by their child's high
school graduation, there is a wide variance in educational
outcomes, ranging from an adult child who was expelled
from the fifth grade to an adult child with a graduate degree.
As reported in Table 1, two adults completed eighth grade or
below, 9 completed some high school, 13 completed the 12th
grade, and10 adults completed some postsecondary educa-
tion, with 3 graduating from 4-year colleges and 1 adult
obtaining a graduate degree.
Research Question 1: How do Adult Children's
Outcomes Compare With IDEIA Goals of
Post­High School Education, Employment, and
Independent Living?
Several survey items that were used to measure adult child
participants' progress on the IDEIA goals of post­high
school education, employment, and independent living are
displayed in Table 2. Responses to the education items were
analyzed in a number of ways to yield a better picture of the
adult children's education, both past and present. When com-
pared with dropping out, high school graduation alone did
not yield a significant relationship with adjustment to adult-
hood, either successful or unsuccessful, 2(1) = 3.11, p = .08.
However, there was a statistically significant relationship
between three levels of education attainment, (dropping out,
high school completion, and postsecondary education) and
successful outcome, 2(2) = 5.84 p = .05. Students with
higher levels of education were more likely to be rated as
successful by their parents, F(2, 31) = 3.22, p = .05. In post
hoc analyses using Bonferroni, only the paired differences
between dropping out and postsecondary education were sig-
nificant, p = .016.
Neither having an IEP nor a Behavioral Intervention Plan
(BIP) was significantly associated with success. However,
students who were expelled from high school were signifi-
cantly more likely to be unsuccessful as adults, 2(1) = 3.74,
p = .05. It should be noted that no student who was rated as
successful was expelled from high school and the overall
expulsion rate for this sample was 16% in comparison with a
general education high school expulsion rate of approxi-
mately 3% (Stillwell et al., 2011).
As with educational achievement, adult children's attain-
ment of IDEIA goals related to employment yielded a posi-
tive relationship between employment status and parent
rating of adjustment to adulthood. Higher levels of employ-
ment were significantly associated with a more successful
adjustment to adulthood, 2(3) = 17.65, p = .001. To account
for adult children who were completing postsecondary edu-
cation, those parents who reported that their child was a full-
time student were differentiated from those who specified
that their child was unemployed. At the time of the study,
only three adult children were both unemployed and full-
time college students; all three were characterized by their
parents as achieving a successful adjustment to adulthood.

shown in Table 3. An analysis of the Index of Positive
Activity was used to examine the adult child's current com-
bined education and employment status. A significant rela-
tionship was found between positively occupying time and
successful adjustment to adulthood, 2(2) = 20.57, p = .001.
Thirteen of the 14 adult children who were fully positively
occupied were rated as successful, while 13 out of 14 adult
children not positively occupied were rated as unsuccessful.
Adult children's current residential situation was ana-
lyzed in a number of ways to capture parents' descriptions of
their child's independent living status. A significant relation-
ship was found between independent living status and suc-
cessful adjustment to adulthood, 2(3) = 13.91, p < .01. Of
the 20 adult children who lived in an independent residential
setting, 19 were characterized as making a successful adjust-
ment to adulthood. None of the 6 adult children who were in
a negative residential setting were described by their parent
as successful.
Greater financial independence was significantly related
to successful adjustment to adulthood, 2(3) = 17.14, p <
.001. Of the 17 adult children who were totally dependent, 15
were described as unsuccessful. In contrast, however, of the
6 adult children who were totally independent, 5 were char-
acterized as being successful while 1 was characterized by
the parent as being unsuccessful apparently due to continu-
ing alcohol abuse, unemployment, and arrest record. In addi-
tion, her financial independence was attributed to spousal
support.
Financial independence was taken into account as well as
residential status when determining an adult child's status on
the Independent Living Index.Aunivariate analysis of variance
of this index indicated that, taken together, residential and
financial independence were significantly associated with
more successful outcomes as adults, F(1, 34) = 23.51, p < .001.
Research Question 2: How Stressful Do Parents
Find Caring for a Child/Adolescent With
Emotional and Behavioral Problems?
The original caregiver strain indices, Objective Caregiver
Strain, Internalized Subjective Strain, and Externalized
Subjective Strain are displayed in Table 4. These results were
evaluated together using MANOVA. The assumption of
homogeneity of variance was met (Box's M = 21.236, p =
.068). Parents of children described as unsuccessful reported
more strain on each subscale than those whose children were
described as successful. The overall F(4, 21) = 5.95, p =
.002, was significant and two of three univariate Fs were sig-
nificant and the third approached significance: Objective,
F(1, 25) = 6.21, p =.02; Internalized, F(1, 25) = 13.28, p =
.001; and Externalized, F(1, 25) = 2.82, p = .10.
In addition to the CGSQ, stress levels that were experi-
enced by parents include reported impact on the parents'
physical and mental health due to raising a child with EBD.
Results of a univariate ANOVA indicated that parents of
unsuccessful adult children reported a more negative impact
on their own mental health as the child was growing up, F(1,
26) = 11.00, p = .003. Although reported impact on physical
health was also rated more negatively by parents of unsuc-
cessful adult children, it was not statistically significant.

Research Question 3: Does Parental Financial
Strain Impact the Child's Adult Outcome?
As shown in Table 4, two items of the CGSQ asked parents
about the degree to which they experienced financial "strain"
as a parent of a child with EBD. There were significant dif-
ferences between the groups, which were evaluated using
MANOVA. The assumption of homogeneity of variances
was not met (Box's M = 13.723, p = .006). Parents of chil-
dren described as unsuccessful reported more financial dis-
tress on each item than those whose children were successful.
The overall F(2, 23) = 6.73, p = .005, was significant and
both of the univariate Fs were significant: Strain, F(1, 25) =
10.39, p = .004; and Deprivation, F(1, 25) = 11.66, p = .002.
Results from other survey items suggest that both groups
of parents tried to purchase as many services outside the
school as possible because private service utilization was
high in both groups but not significantly different. Both
groups frequently obtained mental health assessments (86%
unsuccessful and 77% successful, respectively). Both groups
utilized residential treatment via parental placement at a high
rate (47% unsuccessful and 53% successful) indicating many
parents purchased services that would cause strain in most
family financial situations. Twenty-six of 34 (76.5%) adults
were treated in a Residential Treatment Center (RTC) at
some point during their school years. However, those who
had been treated in an RTC were no more or less likely to be
successful as adults.
While the long-term adult outcomes of treatment in an
RTC were inconclusive for this sample, the prevalence of its
use as a form of treatment provides an indirect measure of
severity of individuals' problems: 15 of 17 unsuccessful
adults and 11 of 17 successful adults received residential
treatment. This finding suggests that the level of severity of
problems was very high and that parents sought independent
interventions frequently.
There was a significant difference in type of placement:
When all involuntary placements were compared with
voluntary parental placements, the difference was significant,
2(1) = 4.51, p = .03. Successful adults were only placed out-
side the home by parents whereas unsuccessful adults were
placed outside the home by other agencies, particularly by the
courts.
Research Question 4: To What Do Parents
Attribute Their Adult Child's Success or Lack of
Success?
Parents were asked, using an open-ended response format, to
describe factors to which they attributed their child's suc-
cessful or unsuccessful adjustment to adulthood. Tables 5
and 6 depict their responses.
As can be seen in Table 5, parents most often attribute
their child's successful adjustment to adulthood to factors
within the child such as intelligence, talent, positive attitude,
maturity, motivation, or work ethic, and factors within the
parent or family environment such as family support, finan-
cial assistance, and forced independence or tough love. In
addition, mental health services were mentioned by parents
as aiding in their child's positive adjustment. Few parents
(6.4%) cited education or school-based services as helping
their child achieve a positive adult outcome.
The data in Table 6 show that parents most often attribute
their child's unsuccessful adjustment to adulthood to factors
within the child such as emotional problems, stubbornness,
impulsivity, opposition, defiance, poor coping skills, an
inability to hold a job, lack of respect for authority figures,
negative life choices, risky sexual behaviors, poor judgment,
ignorance of stated rules, noncompliance with medication or
treatment, substance abuse, or other symptoms of a mental
illness or specific conditions included in their DSM diagno-
ses. Nearly 10% of parents cited poor school supports, a lack
of education, or negative school environment as contributing
to their child's unsuccessful adult outcome.
Discussion
In an era when the graduation rate for students with EBD
is less than 50% (GAO, 2008), the most important finding
of this study is staying in school through postsecondary

education contributes to adult success of those who were
identified as children/adolescents with EBD. The IDEIA
goal of postsecondary education was associated with par-
ent perception of success, and to some, this might seem to
be an obvious relationship. While graduating from high
school alone was not associated with success in this study,
perhaps because the majority of these students completed
12th grade thus restricting the variance, dropping out of
high school and pursuing postsecondary education were
clearly important predictors of unsuccessful and success-
ful adult outcomes, respectively. In this sample, there was
a 68% high school completion rate and a 29% participa-
tion in postsecondary education suggesting that these par-
ents went to great lengths to keep their children engaged
in education. Thus, even in a small sample, the results are
congruent with IDEIA's emphasis on postsecondary edu-
cation apparently because those engaged in postsecondary
education were more likely to be rated as successful by
their parents. However, as students with behavioral prob-
lems in general are much more likely to drop out or be
expelled from high school, achieving the IDEIA goal of
postsecondary education (that should be attainable for this
group of students based on cognitive ability) deserves
more attention than current educational policies support.
IEP transition plans for high school students with EBD
should be tied to postsecondary educational goals stress-
ing specific skills that will lead to improved employment
opportunities.
In contrast, another important finding was the relationship
of expulsion and unsuccessful outcomes. Expulsion is an
extremely negative predictor of success of students with
EBD. No student in this study who was expelled was rated as
successful in adulthood despite majority status and adequate
social capital of his or her family. It is generally known that
students with EBD are more likely to violate school rules, be
suspended, and eventually expelled from school. In this
study, use of punitive discipline was not associated with pos-
itive outcomes.
Adult Adjustment and IDEIA Goals
Successful adjustment to adulthood was significantly
related to employment status as well as independent living
and financial independence. Considering all of the parent
ratings, 10 of 31 (32%) adult children were employed full-
time and an additional 5 (16%) were employed part-time.
Furthermore, only 14 adults (41%) were considered to be
"fully positively occupied," suggesting that many students
with EBD leave high school unprepared for either employ-
ment or postsecondary education.Although 20 adults (59%)
were living independently, only 6 (18%) adult children
were described as being fully financially independent. This
suggests that while there is clearly a positive benefit to
achieving the IDEIA goal of postsecondary employment
and independent living, a large majority of adult children in
this sample have not achieved financial independence.
Given that the adult children were all reported to be of nor-
mal or high-average cognitive functioning, it is not surpris-
ing that the majority attained independent living status,
meaning they can successfully manage and care for them-
selves. However, the contrast between percentage that
attained independent living and the percentage that attained
financial independence indicates that they may not be
achieving their full potential.
These findings are even more troubling when one consid-
ers that these adults have parents with at least average edu-
cational and SES levels and the sample includes more
individuals with majority status than those generally
depicted in the literature or than would be expected in a ran-
dom sample of parents of all students with EBD. If the
young adult children of parents with this level of social capi-
tal experience problems fully occupying themselves either
with full-time work or postsecondary education, it is diffi-
cult to imagine that young adults with EBD in childhood
who have less well-educated and resourced parents would
fare better or even as well. Thus, the somewhat positive
skew of the current sample probably depicts a picture that is
optimistic compared with the underlying group of adults
who had EBD during childhood/adolescence. This strongly
suggests that even higher levels of negative adult outcomes
in children with EBD than shown in this study are likely in
the population. Furthermore, at the time these data were col-
lected, the economy had begun to deteriorate, which proba-
bly would depress outcomes for all young adults, with
childhood EBD or not. Future studies could include a more
diverse sample in the study to verify these results as well as
take changing economic conditions into account.
Parental Strain
Not surprisingly, parents whose adult children were unsuccess-
ful reported higher levels of strain during their child-rearing
Wynne et al. 11
years in all measured spheres and more negative effects on
their mental health. It is easy to understand why having a child
with serious emotional and behavioral problems of long dura-
tion would be stressful for any parent (Long, Gurka, &
Blackman, 2008). Causality cannot be established, but parents
of the adult children who did not improve year after year and
therefore were still unsuccessful reported significantly more
strain than parents of the successful adult children, who experi-
enced equivalent problems as young children. Conversely, see-
ing a child/adolescent on an improving trajectory leading
eventually to a parent rating of successful or highly successful
obviously could reduce perceived stress. It is possible that the
adults' current outcome affected parents' recall of their strain.
Attempts were made to guard against this bias, however, by
asking parents to reflect on strain at three levels of child devel-
opment. Nevertheless, as many of the unsuccessful adult chil-
dren remain under their parents'care, or at least are financially
dependent, parents may have reported current as well as his-
toric strain.
Financial Strain
In a similar pattern to parental strain, parents of unsuccessful
adult children reported significantly more perceived finan-
cial strain during their child's youth than parents of success-
ful adult children. This relationship existed despite the
parents reporting equivalent incomes and parental purchase
of costly mental health services and residential treatment
was high in both groups. However, "financial strain" is sub-
jective and it is possible that parents whose intervention
attempts were not succeeding stretched their family budgets
further than parents of successful adults by trying to provide
all possible interventions. In addition, while there was no
significant difference in the rate of residential placement
among the adult children, it is possible when residential
placements failed to produce improvement, the parents per-
ceived more financial strain due to anticipating the need to
purchase additional services.
Parent Attributions of Success or Lack of Success
Parents commonly attributed both successful and unsuccess-
ful adjustment in adulthood to factors internal to the child.
Even though one third of the adult children had IEPs as
youth, less than 10% of the parents mentioned school ser-
vices as affecting outcomes. This result may be somewhat
discouraging to professionals who are working with this
population of students and are attempting to provide inter-
ventions that will foster positive growth and development
within the child's home or school environment. However,
knowing that parents feel that internal characteristics are
very important to determining adult outcomes for this group
of children, professionals can try to adapt and design inter-
ventions that capitalize on positive individual traits and alle-
viate the effects of negative personal characteristics.
Implications and Future Research
Despite the stigma associated with being identified as a stu-
dent with EBD under IDEIA, qualifying for special educa-
tion may serve as a protective function for students who are
more likely than average to violate school rules. Increasing
school identification of students with DSM diagnoses under
IDEIA criteria may be beneficial because an IEP provides
legal protection against arbitrary disciplinary actions as well
as access to transition planning. Consequently, it is possible
that the presence of an IEP alone would have protected the
unsuccessful students from expulsion and thereby increased
their chances for success. In this study, however, the pres-
ence of an IEP was not directly related to successful or
unsuccessful adult outcomes perhaps due to the time period
in which these adult children were in school.
In this study, no successful student was expelled, making
it clear that expulsion is connected to negative outcomes for
this sample. School staff should work to develop preventive
strategies such as positive behavioral interventions and sup-
ports that would bring student behavior to acceptable levels
and obviate the need to use highly punitive measures such as
expulsion.
Online parent samples can be problematic as parent par-
ticipants may be better educated and more affluent than the
population of parents of children with EBD in general; fur-
thermore, participating parents must be computer literate and
have access to a computer. While it is true that the sample in
this study is positively skewed in terms of educational and
SES level, we wanted to investigate the achievement of
IDEIA 2004 goals in a sample of parents of adult children
who experienced EBD as children/adolescents under the
condition of having family resources and a level of parent
education that are higher than other samples of parents of
students with EBD. The rationale was that if the children of
parents who were financially stable and reasonably well-
educated did not fare well, it is unlikely that outcomes would
be better if the parents had lacked access to education, were
poor, and were undergoing many stresses in addition to par-
enting a child with EBD. If the adult children had done
exceptionally well, then there would be a confound with
their parents' resources. As only 17% of the adult children
rated by the entire sample were considered "successful" or
"very successful," the design is not confounded. Based on
the findings from this study, it would be beneficial for addi-
tional research to examine the adult outcomes for a larger
sample of children that is more racially and socioeconomi-
cally diverse for purposes of comparison. Additional focus
should be given to school-based services and whether or not
preventive measures or appropriate special education ser-
vices would produce positive outcomes for this population.
Finally, as shown by the current study, the percentage of stu-
dents with EBD who actually receive specialized services
in school is small compared with the numbers of children
and adolescents who experience significant emotional and
12 SAGE Open
behavioral problems. Therefore, it would be important for
future studies of children with emotional and behavioral
problems to include children with DSM diagnoses in addi-
tion to students found eligible for special education services
under IDEIA.
