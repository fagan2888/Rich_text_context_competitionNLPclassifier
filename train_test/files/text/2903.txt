Abstract:
A number of recent studies find evidence for the existence of a persistent perfor-
mance gap between multinational enterprises (MNE) and their domestic competi-
tors. Therefore, the question arises whether successful firms become MNEs or
whether going abroad improves home market performance. This paper investi-
gates to what extent MNEs have superior performance characteristics, both prior
to and after they have switched from national to multinational activities. In the first
case results are quite clear: Future multinationals outperform domestic firms. Since
self-selection occurs, an endogenous treatment approach is necessary for comparing
ex-post performance of firms. Using probit estimates of the decision to become a
MNE, Heckman's (1978) treatment model is applied to account for potential endo-
geneity issues. The results suggest that after switching, both productivity and wage
growth are higher for newly founded MNEs than for national firms. Employment
growth is superior before switching but does not exhibit significantly higher ex-post
growth rates. Moreover, capital intensities at multinationals evolve towards the use
of capital.

This paper investigates to what extent a regime change from national to multina-
tional activities (switching) affects home market performance of parent firms rela-
tive to purely national firms in Germany. The analysis is conducted both prior to
and after firms have gone multinational. In order to assess a broad range of firm
attributes, I have constructed five different performance measures: 1) firm size; 2)
total factor productivity (TFP); 3) labour productivity; 4) average wage per firm; 5)
capital intensities. Since multinationals do not arise randomly ­ only good firms
accept the risk to invest abroad ­ Heckman's (1978) treatment model is used to
account for potential endogeneity issues in the ex-post analysis.
Theoretical predictions are clear cut if ex-ante (before switching) performance
differences between switchers and nationals are considered. When starting up or ac-
quiring foreign affiliates, firms need to overcome legal, cultural, and social barriers.
Only good firms are able to cope with this kind of fixed costs and, thus, self-select
into foreign markets. Whether the regime change from national to multinational
activities also improves home market performance after switching is less obvious.
If there is no other alternative to serve foreign markets besides the set-up or ac-
quisition of an affiliate (horizontal perspective), becoming a MNE would have no
negative or even positive effects on domestic operations. If, in contrast, the purpose
of a multinational's foundation is to vertically divide its production process, per-
formance measures could rise or decline. The question whether investing abroad
improves home market performance or not is therefore essentially an empirical is-
sue.
My findings provide clear evidence throughout the following points: During the
years prior to the regime change, switchers exhibit higher performance attributes
in levels, i.e. they are larger in size, pay higher wages, produce with higher
capital intensities, and they are more productive. These results are confirmed
by a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test on the equality of performance
distributions. For all firm characteristics, distribution functions for nationals lie
to the left of those for switchers. In terms of growth rates, significant ex-ante
differences between newly founded MNEs and national firms can only be found
with respect to the size of the operation. After the regime change, both productivity
and wage growth are higher for switchers than for nationals. Capital intensities at
multinationals evolve towards the use of capital, and switching does not affect firm
size. Moreover, the implementation of Heckman's (1978) endogenous treatment
estimator suggests that self-selection matters. Though results are somewhat mixed
here, I find evidence that TFP growth in the first year after going multinational,
labour productivity in the first and second period after becoming a MNE, and
capital intensities for the whole sample period are significantly influenced by
selectivity issues.
Nicht technische Zusammenfassung
Die vorliegende Arbeit untersucht, inwiefern sich der ¨

Deutschland im Vergleich zu rein national agierenden Firmen auswirkt. Die Unter-
suchung analysiert sowohl den Zeitraum vor dem ¨
Ubergang als auch die Jahre nach
dem Regimewechsel. Um dabei eine m¨
oglichst umfassende Auswahl von firmenbe-
zogenen Eigenschaften abzudecken, werden f¨
unf verschiedene betriebliche Charak-
teristika evaluiert: 1. die Firmengr¨

3. die Arbeitsproduktivit¨

zur Anwendung.
Betrachtet man ex-ante (vor dem ¨
Ubergang zu einem MNU) Unterschiede zwis-
chen national und international agierenden Unternehmen, so ergeben sich klar
umrissene theoretische Aussagen. Die Gr¨
undung oder der Erwerb ausl¨
andischer
Tochterunternehmen macht eine ¨
Uberwindung rechtlicher, kultureller und sozialer
Hindernisse notwendig. Da nur erfolgreiche Firmen dazu in der Lage sind, mit
derartigen Fixkosten umzugehen, kommt es zur Selbstselektion solcher Firmen in
ausl¨
andische M¨
arkte. Ob ein Regimewechsel von nationalen zu multinationalen
Aktivit¨
aten auch nach dem ¨
Ubergang zu besseren Betriebsergebnissen auf dem
Heimatmarkt f¨
uhrt, ist weniger offensichtlich. Besteht die einzige Alternative einen
Auslandsmarkt zu beliefern darin, vor Ort ein Tochterunternehmen zu gr¨
unden oder
zu erwerben, so sollte sich dies nicht negativ oder im g¨
unstigsten Fall sogar positiv
auf das heimische Unternehmen auswirken. Falls andererseits ein multinationales
Unternehmen zum Zwecke der vertikalen Zergliederung des Produktionsprozesses
gegr¨
undet wird, kann dies die Charakteristika des Mutterunternehmens sowohl pos-
itiv als auch negativ beeinflussen. Die Frage, ob Auslandsinvestitionen die Leis-
tungsf¨

empirische Problemstellung.

Going Multinational: What are the effects on
home market performance?
1 Introduction
Foreign direct investments (FDI) of domestic firms have attracted the interest of
both the general public and politicians. The abrupt increase of multinational activ-
ities towards the end of the 20th century has raised concerns that domestic firms'
foreign operations negatively affect home economies. Most managers and business
leaders do not share this opinion. They consider international expansions of do-
mestic firms as an important channel to enhance competitiveness. Economists can
contribute to the heated political debate by evaluating performance characteristics
of multinational enterprises (MNEs) relative to purely domestic firms. Since multi-
nationals do not arise randomly ­ only good firms accept the risk to invest abroad ­
selectivity issues need to be taken into account.
In this paper, I investigate to what extent MNEs have superior performance at-
tributes, both prior to and after they have switched from national to multinational
activities. For this purpose the following questions are posed: How much better
are multinationals? Do only successful firms invest abroad? And do MNEs grow
faster than national companies? To answer the first question I discuss differences
between domestic firms, newly founded multinationals, and existing MNEs. The
second and the third topics are covered by a comparison of new multinationals and
national firms before, at the time of, and after switching. To assess a broad range
of firm attributes, I have constructed five different performance measures: 1) firm
size; 2) total factor productivity (TFP); 3) labour productivity; 4) average wage per
firm; 5) capital intensities. Selectivity problems necessitate applying an endoge-
nous treatment approach for the evaluation of ex-post performance characteristics.
Therefore, using probit estimates of the decision to become a MNE, Heckman's
(1978) treatment model is used to account for potential endogeneity issues.
Theoretical predictions are clear cut if ex-ante (before switching) performance

differences are considered. When starting up or acquiring foreign affiliates, firms
need to overcome legal, cultural, and social barriers. Only good firms are able
to cope with this kind of fixed costs and, thus, self-select into foreign markets.
Whether the regime change from national to multinational activities also improves
home market performance after switching is less obvious. Theoretical models in
this respect are ambiguous. If there is no other alternative to serve foreign markets
besides the set-up or acquisition of an affiliate (horizontal perspective), becoming
a MNE would have no negative or even positive effects on domestic operations.
If, in contrast, the purpose of a multinational's foundation is to vertically divide
its production process, performance measures could rise or decline. Firm size, for
example, is expected to suffer from cost-saving motives. An overall gain in com-
petitiveness through cost reductions, on the other hand, may increase the number
of employees at the parent location. The possible co-existence of market seeking
and cost-reducing forces also makes predictions about the effect of switching on
domestic productivity ambiguous. Learning effects due to new technological and
managerial inputs may play a positive role. Contrariwise, the efforts of restructur-
ing a newly founded multi-plant enterprise could be accompanied by productivity
losses at the domestic operation. Similar pros and cons can be discussed for all
performance measures, and I proceed with a more extensive discussion of these is-
sues in chapter 7.1. The crucial point, however, is that whether investing abroad
improves home market performance or not is, in the end, an empirical question.
My findings provide clear evidence throughout the following points: During the
years prior to the regime change, switchers exhibit higher performance attributes
in levels, i.e. they are larger in size, pay higher wages, produce with higher cap-
ital intensities, and they are more productive. These results are confirmed by a
two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test on the equality of performance distri-
butions. For all firm characteristics, distribution functions for nationals lie to the
left of those for switchers. In terms of growth rates, significant ex-ante differences
between newly founded MNEs and national firms can only be found with respect
to the size of the operation. After the regime change, both productivity and wage
growth are higher for switchers than for nationals. Capital intensities at multina-
tionals evolve towards the use of capital, and switching does not affect firm size.
Moreover, the implementation of Heckman's (1978) endogenous treatment estima-
tor suggests that self-selection matters. Though results are somewhat mixed here,
I find evidence that TFP growth in the first year after going multinational, labour
productivity in the first and second period after becoming a MNE, and capital inten-
2
sities for the whole sample period are significantly influenced by selectivity issues.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Starting point is a brief
summary of the existing literature. An overview of the data and a short discussion
of the different performance measures is provided in section 3. Section 4 compares
existing MNEs and switchers. Then I offer a detailed discussion of ex-ante differ-
ences in levels and growth rates, also including a set of Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.
The determinants of the switching decision are derived within a probit framework in
chapter 6, and ex-post performance differences are discussed in section 7. Section 8
concludes the paper.
2 Related Literature
In a theoretical model Helpman, Melitz and Yeaple (2004) describe the relationship
between firm productivity and the engagement in different stages of international
trade. Highly productive firms become multinationals (MNEs), less productive
companies serve foreign markets by exports, and the least productive firms stay
on their domestic markets. Based on these predictions, Girma, Kneller and Pisu
(2005) present an empirical investigation for the UK using the concept of statis-
tical dominance. They clearly confirm that productivity distributions are ordered
according to the Helpman et al. (2005) paper. Girma et al. (2005) also try to test
for "marginal firms", i.e. they evaluate productivity differences between first-time
exporters and nationals, on the one hand, and newly founded, foreign owned MNEs
(non-UK MNEs) and domestic producers, on the other. In their investigations some
weak evidence of self selection for newly founded (foreign) MNEs and even weaker
support of superior productivity for marginal exporters is found. In a similar study,
Arnold and Hussinger (2005b) test the Helpman et al. (2005) setting for a sample of
German manufacturers. Comparing the productivity distributions of purely national
companies, domestic exporters, and firms with outward investment, their results ex-
hibit clear support for the predictions of the theoretical model. In another recent
study, Tomiura (2004) turns to a sample of 118 thousand Japanese manufacturers
in order to conduct a productivity comparison between outsourcing, exporting, and
FDI. He concludes that FDI firms are more productive than foreign outsourcing
firms, which are equally productive as exporters and clearly more productive than
domestic firms.
Earlier research mainly focuses on partial tests of the relationship suggested by
Helpman et al. (2005). Starting with the comparison of exporters and nationals,
3
Clerides, Lach and Tybout (1998) ask whether learning by exporting is of impor-
tance. Their empirical investigations show that more efficient firms become ex-
porters, but that there is no backward link between previous exporting activities
and the firms' cost structures. A study with German data is Arnold and Hussinger
(2005a). It is based on firm level data for the manufacturing sector in Germany and
tries to reveal the causal relationship between export status and productivity. As in
most other studies on this topic, Arnold and Hussinger show that higher productiv-
ity leads to self selection into foreign markets, but being an exporter does not come
together with productivity gains on the domestic market. Girma and Greenaway
(2002) use matching methods, usually applied in the evaluation literature of active
labour market programmes, as a means to detect the direction of causality ­ from
high performance to exports or vice versa. As an exception to other authors, they
find for a sample of UK manufactures that exporting increases firms' productiv-
ity causatively. Bernard and Jensen (1999) use a similar framework as I do when
analysing ex-ante and ex-post performance evolutions of newcomers on export mar-
kets. They find distinctive evidence that successful firms ­ as measured in levels and
growth rates ­ become exporters. However, their study provides less clear results
with respect to the benefits of breaking into foreign markets: employment growth
and the survival probability seem to be higher for exporters but productivity and
wage growth dominate the growth rates at national firms. Beyond other studies,
both Bernard and Jensen (1999) and my analysis do not solely focus on productiv-
ity measures but use a wide range of performance characteristics. The paper at hand,
as opposed to Bernard and Jensen (1999), considers MNEs instead of exporters and
takes the endogeneity of the investment decision into account.
Apart from the relation between exporting and merely serving domestic mar-
kets, some studies compare multinationals and domestic producers as well as multi-
nationals and exporting firms. An example for the first case is Castellani and
Navaretti (2004). Employing propensity score techniques for Italian manufacturers,
the authors analyse the effect of FDI on firm characteristics like employment or pro-
ductivity growth. The results suggest that foreign expansions improve the growth
of productivity and output but exhibit no significant impact on employment. Egger
and Pfaffermayr (2003), on the other hand, try to evaluate the investment behaviour
of MNEs if they were purely exporting firms. In other words, they are searching for
the counterfactual domestic investment to foreign activities. Using three different
methods to account for the endogeneity of the FDI decision, Egger and Pfaffermayr
(2003) show for a sample of Austrian manufacturers that foreign activities do not
4
diminish domestic investment in intangible assets, while they increase investment
in tangible assets.
3 Data and Construction of Performance Measures
In the study at hand I use data from the USTAN (Unternehmensbilanzstatistik) data
base at Deutsche Bundesbank (BuBa) between 1992 and 2001. Every firm in Ger-
many that draws a bill of exchange in a given year is required by law to report its
balance sheet to BuBa, which collects this information in its USTAN data base when
the bill of exchange is rediscounted. The draft of bills of exchange remains a com-
mon form of payment in Germany. However, increases in BuBa's value threshold
for reporting resulted in several drops of the sample and a decrease of the sam-
ple size over time from an overall number of 75,393 observations in the year 1992
to 26,737 observations in 2001. Table 7 in appendix A exemplifies the impact of
the described sample reduction on the distribution of the variables employment and
capital stock .1 The table implies the existence of an attrition bias with respect to
large companies, i.e. in later years mainly smaller firms drop from the USTAN data
base. Among the variables extracted from USTAN are employment, firm age, in-
vestment, tangible and intangible assets, profits, intermediate inputs, et cetera. All
financial figures included in the analysis are deflated to unity at year end 1998 using
the German CPI (from the IMF's International Financial Statistics).2
Information on outward FDI from Germany is obtained from the MIDI database
(Microdatabase Directinvestment) of the Deutsche Bundesbank at the level of Ger-
man parents and their foreign affiliates. A firm is defined as a newly founded MNE
(switcher) if the parent identifier appears in the MIDI dataset for the first time.3
That is a multinational emerges if it "[...] acquires a substantial controlling interest
1The table depicts summary statistics for the overall USTAN data set without any further adapta-
tions.
2The end of 1998 is the mid point of the matched 1996-2001 FDI data (see below). In addition,
the introduction of the euro in early 1999 makes December 1998 a natural reference date.
3A parent appears before 1999 if it controls at least 20 percent of its foreign affiliates' equity and
the affiliates' balance sheet total is at least 1 million DM. After 1998 the affiliates had to satisfy either
of the following two criteria: (i) the parent controls at least 10 percent of equity and the balance sheet
total is at least 5 million EUR; or (ii) the parent controls at least 50 percent of equity and the balance
sheet is at least 0.5 million EUR. Lipponer (2003) stresses that the modification of the notification
limit in 1999 changes the number of reported affiliates significantly. However, as table 1 shows, the
number of newly emerging parent firms is not affected by this change. It seems somewhat surprising
that the number of switchers drops both in the MIDI and in the matched data set in 2001, although
there is no further modification of the notification limit.

2002, p. 5).
Firms from the MIDI database were string-matched by name to companies in
the BuBa USTAN data set.4 Overall, a total of 2,955 different firms were merged.
In Becker, Ekholm, J¨
ackle and Muendler (2005b) (appendices A and B), the string
matching procedure is described in more detail.
Both the USTAN as well as the MIDI data sets are available in the form of an
unbalanced panel. Firms in the USTAN data base can be followed throughout the
years 1992 to 2001 if they draw a bill of exchange every year. Individual parents in
the MIDI data set are identifiable during the period 1996 to 2001. This allows the
identification of switchers between 1997 and 2001 and the comparison of ex-ante
(before switching) parent characteristics between 1992 and 2000.5
Table 1 summarises the development of the different data sets in the course of
time. The first line reports the total number of USTAN firms for each year. In the
second row the overall number of matched MIDI firms is depicted. These compa-
nies have already been MNEs in 1996 or switched status anytime between 1996 and
2001. A comparison with line five, which includes the total number of FDI firms in
the MIDI data set, allows an evaluation of the matching algorithm. The merge pro-
cess yields a matching quote between 18 percent in 2001 and 25 percent in 1997.6
Lines three and six report firms that became multinationals in the according year.
Overall, 1,005 switchers appear in the matched sample. Thus, the matching quote
for switchers lies between 12 percent in 2001 and 27 percent in 1997. This cor-
responds approximately to the quotes in the overall data set. Row four reports the
remaining national companies of the USTAN data set.
All analyses are conducted at the firm level.7 In order to get eliminate parent
4The string matching routine automatically chose firms with an equality of at least 50 percent of
all letters included in their firm names. All potential matches were manually overseen before they
were accepted as being the same company.
5Unfortunately, the data at hand does not allow to control for firms that appear in the MIDI data
set before 1996, disappear in 1996, and then reappear in the period 1997-2001.
To avoid confusions about different sample periods, a short note of clarification is presented at
this point. The first step of the productivity (TFP) estimates refers to the time span 1992-2001, the
second step and therefore the construction of TFP refers to the period 1993-2001, and the overall
time of evaluating performance measures lies between 1994 and 2001.
6Since for unmatched multinationals no parent information is available, performance attributes
of matched FDI firms cannot be compared to characteristics of the overall number of multinationals
in the MIDI data set.
7In this paper firms are defined as legally independent operations that draws a bill of exchange in
a certain year.

intermediation) and 7415 (management activities of holding companies) as well as
companies with firm age below 5 years or firm size below 8 employees are removed
from the estimation sample. Additionally, to prevent outliers from affecting
results, variable values larger than the 99% and smaller than the 1% quantile were
examined and if necessary dropped from the estimation sample. The large size of
the USTAN sample allows for the use of Nace 4digit sector codes. However, for
some estimations I have classified the firms into seven different industry branches.
Details of the aggregation can be found in table 8, appendix B.
Five different firm attributes are employed in order to describe differences in
the performance of switchers and nationals: 1) firm size; 2) total factor productivity
(TFP); 3) labour productivity; 4) average wage per firm; 5) capital labour ratios.
As usual, firm size is measured by the number of employees. Total factor pro-
ductivity is unobservable and therefore needs to be estimated. The strategy in my
study is to restrict technology parameters to a Cobb-Douglas production function
and view the residual from the relationship between output and input factors as TFP.
As is well known since the paper of Marschak and Andrews (1944), the correlation
between unobserved, firm-specific productivity shocks and the firm's input choice
causes a simultaneity bias.8 In the literature different ways to deal with this prob-
lem have been documented. Following Olley and Pakes (1996) and Levinsohn and
Petrin (2003), I use both investment in tangible and intangible assets and, in another
8In addition, if companies with smaller capital stock are more likely to close down their opera-
tions in consequence of a negative productivity shock, a selectivity problem occurs. In the USTAN
data set firms drop out of the sample if they either exit the market or do not draw a bill of exchange
in a certain year. Since it is not possible to distinguish these reasons, the selectivity issue cannot be
addressed with the data at hand.

In order to evaluate performance measures with respect to the firms' workforce,
labour productivity, as constructed by the ratio of value added over employment,
and the average wage per firm, measured as wage bill divided by employment, are
used in the analysis. Finally, to assess capital intensities among different firms,
capital labour ratios are used as a performance attribute.
4 How much better are Multinationals?
Common sense leads to the conclusion that multinational enterprises exhibit su-
perior performance characteristics compared to their domestic competitors with-
out foreign affiliates. In this section, I discuss differences between non-MNEs and
newly founded multinationals, in the year of switching, as well as differences be-
tween existing multinationals and national firms.10
Performance gaps between both groups are calculated as percentage values in
the following regression:

region, industry and time dummies respectively, and Ci,t
stands for the additional
9In order to increase the number of observations, I did not employ firm age as explanatory vari-
able in a).
10The data at hand do not include information about export activities of firms. A domestic en-
terprise can therefore merely serve national markets or additionally be active on export markets. In
this respect, another caveat is the missing possibility to identify domestic firms which are owned by
foreign multinationals. In a recent study, Criscuolo and Martin (2003) find evidence for what they
call the "MNE effect": MNEs, of foreign and domestic origin, are more productive than domestic
firms. Either of these points might affect the results of this paper in the same way: Switching pre-
mia calculated on different occasions could be downward biased since the comparison group goes
beyond the definition of purely national firms in the above manner.

control variables age and size.11
Table 2 provides estimation results of the above equation. Each cell includes the
coefficient of the MNEi,t
dummy for another (dependent) performance variable.
Columns (3) and (4) report the premia of already being a MNE between 1996 and
2001, whereas columns (1) and (2) describe the premia of becoming a MNE for the
period 1997 to 2001. In the later case, all existing MNEs as well as switchers before
and after the time of switching were removed from the estimation sample. Columns
(2) and (4) depict results after adding additional controls (Ci,t
).
The performance gap for all firm attributes is positive and significantly different
from zero.12 Largest differences are found with respect to firm size. The number
of employees at existing multinationals is 130% to 140% higher than at national
firms. At the time of switching, newly founded MNEs are about twice as large as
nationals.
All productivity measures exhibit a persistent efficiency gap. Differences in to-
tal factor productivity range from 22% to 66%. As in the case of firm size, being a
MNE goes along with a higher performance differential than becoming a multina-
tional.13 This could be seen as first evidence for the existence of a positive perfor-
mance dynamic after switching, i.e becoming a MNE could have a positive impact
on the post-investment productivity of parent firms.
Performance measures related to the firms' work force, labour productivity
and average wages show positive differences for all specifications. Wages (value
added per worker) at existing MNEs are (is) 15% to 18% (25% to 26%) higher
than at national firms. In the yea of the regime change, MNE mark-ups for average
wages (labour productivity) are between 11% and 13% (22% and 25%). These
differences might indicate a skill bias towards high skilled workers in the labour
force of MNEs.
11The dimension of the domestic operation is approximated by the number of employees. It is not
included if the dependent variable, Pi,t, is firm size.
12To improve comparability between sectors I also constructed performance characteristics in de-
viation of the corresponding sector means. The use of these relative measures as dependent variables
in equation 1 did not alter performance premia in any important way. Another consistency check
was to construct equal sample sizes for each performance regression related to a certain column of
table 2. Again, results did not change in an important manner. Estimation results for both modifica-
tions are available on request.
13Specifications with additional control variables exhibit a difference of about five percentage
points between specifications (2) and (4), whereas columns (1) and (3), excluding the variables firm
age and size, show larger differences of around 10 percentage points.

d The number of observations refer to the overall number of observations in each performance regression (N overall P) and
both to the number of switchers (N treat. P) in columns (1) and (2) and to the number of existing MNEs (N treat. P) in
columns (3) and (4). Existing MNEs are observed in the time period from 1996 to 2001. Switchers are observed between
1997 and 2001.
10
Finally, I also investigate performance distinctions with respect to capital labour
ratios. Differences in the capital intensities are between 18% and 21% for switchers
and 14% and 33% for multinationals already active on foreign markets for a couple
of years. This fits with the argument that being a MNE is accompanied by a shift
in the firms' labour demand from production to non-production workers, meaning
that average wages and capital intensities are both higher at MNEs than at national
firms.
Table 2 should not be misunderstood in view of a causal link between multina-
tional activities and growing performance attributes at the home market. Rather, the
results reveal positive correlation patterns that confirm inherent performance differ-
ences for a series of firm characteristics. It is shown that multinational enterprises
exhibit superior performance features. Differences are even larger if firms were
already active on foreign markets for a couple of years. The following chapters
investigate the performance premia of switchers in more detail.
5 Performance before Switching
Many studies have shown that multinationals outperform firms that serve only do-
mestic markets.14 Barba Navaretti and Venables (2004) argue that "MNEs are larger
and sometimes more productive than national firms." In a recent paper Helpman
et al. (2004) state that productivity differences on the home market lead to self-
selection into foreign activities.
When companies start up or acquire affiliates in foreign countries, they have to
overcome a number of barriers to entry. Caves (1996) claims in his book that "the
business firm [...] has a clear-cut national base and identity, with its internal planing
and decision making carried out in the context of that nation's legal and cultural
framework." That is, when investing abroad, firms need to deal with fixed costs due
to legal, cultural, and social differences. Hence, it seems obvious that only firms
with successful operations on domestic markets can handel the additional efforts
that accompany the setting up of foreign affiliates.
In this chapter two questions concerning ex-ante performance differences are
assessed empirically: 1) Is there a performance gap (in levels) between switchers
and nationals firms before switching? 2) What about performance growth in the run
up to become a MNE? To back up these investigations, in section 5.2 a Kolmogorov-
Schmirnov test is conducted.
14A number of references and examples can be found in Caves (1996) and Markusen (2002).
11
5.1 Ex-ante differences in levels
In chapter 4 evidence was found that multinationals at the time of switching have
superior performance characteristics compared to their national counterparts. Con-
sequently, the next step is to ask whether these differences also exist in the years
prior to the regime change. To do so, the following equation is estimated:
logPi,T-t
= 0
+1
Switchi,T
(+ Ci,T-t
)+1
statei
+2
sectori
+3
yearT-t
+ui,T-t
,
(2)
where T is the date of switching (1997-2001) and t is the according time lag
(t=1,2,3).15 Performance attributes are assessed over a period of three years be-
fore switching. The corresponding time dimensions of the dependent variables in
the estimation samples are therefore 1996-2000, 1995-1999, and 1994-1998.
Each cell of table 3 includes coefficients of the Switchi,T
dummy. Performance
gaps for all firm attributes are significantly positive and ­ when taking confidence
intervals on the estimators into account ­ roughly consistent over time.16 Again,
firm size exhibits the largest differences. These are between 100% (98% without
additional controls) in T - 1 and 96% (91%) in T - 3. Performance premia for
switchers with respect to total factor productivity range from 26% (53%) in the
year before switching to 22% (48%) three years before the regime change. More-
over, firms that become multinationals pay on average 11%-12% (11%-13%) higher
wages, have a 23%-25% (22%) larger valued added per worker, and capital inten-
sities exceed those of national firms by 16%-19% (22%-25%). A comparison with
table 2 shows that performance differences, found in the year of switching, already
existed in about the same magnitude one to three years before the according firms
became multinationals.
5.2 Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on the equality of distributions
To back up the investigations in section 5.1 a number of Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)
two-sample tests on the equality of performance distributions are conducted.17 The
KS test provides the possibility to determine differences in the distributions of firm
attributes for switchers and non-multinationals. That is, it compares not only the
15All other variables are defined according to the covariates in equation 1.
16Performance measures in deviation of the according sector means and equal sample sizes did
not alter results.
17These tests are implemented using the software package Stata. The KS test has no underlying
distributional assumptions. It is therefore a non-parametric test. Additionally, t-tests on mean-
differences were accomplished. They confirm the findings in the KS setting.

d The number of observations refer to the overall number of firms in each performance regression (N overall P) and to the
number of switchers (N treat. P). Performance measures of switchers are observed between 1994 and 2000. The formation
of new MNEs (switching) is observed between 1997 and 2001. All existing MNEs as well as switchers before and after the
time of switching were removed from the estimation sample.
13
first moments of the distribution functions but tests if the distribution (density) of
Pt
with respect to newly founded MNEs is to the right of the one for national firms.
Earlier papers written by Girma et al. (2005) and Arnold and Hussinger (2005b)
use the above setting to check whether productivity levels of multinationals exceed
those of exporters, which in turn are questioned to be grater than the productivity
levels of purely national firms. Their studies accomplish a set of Kolmogorov-
Smirnov tests on a contemporaneous basis, i.e. they ask whether existing MNEs
are significantly different to nationals and exporters. Girma et al. (2005) also apply
KS tests on a subset of first-time exporters in the period before they change export
status and on a sample of foreign owned domestic firms in the year before they were
acquired by foreign multinationals. Unlike the above studies, the paper at hand tests
for differences in parent characteristics between future multinationals and nationals
up to three years before switching.
Table 10 in the appendix provides results of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for
three time lags. The first block (rows (1) - (6)) refers to performance differences
in t - 1, the second one to t - 2, and the third block to differences in t - 3. The
KS test makes use of the maximum vertical difference (D) between the distribu-
tion functions of switchers (F(Ps
t
)) and nationals (F(Pn
t
)). Rows (1), (7) and (13)
include the largest positive deviations, D+ = max(F(Pn
t
) - F(Ps
t
)), in the cumu-
lative fractions of both groups. The corresponding p-values are reported in the lines
below.18 Thus, the hypothesis that the distribution function of Pt
for nationals lies
to the left of the distribution function for switchers is tested by asking whether Pt
for nationals contains smaller values than for newly founded multinationals. Ac-
cordingly, maximum deviations in lines (3), (9) and (15) are defined as the statistic
D- = max(F(Ps
t
) - F(Pn
t
)) = min(F(Pn
t
) - F(Ps
t
)). These rows, together
with (4), (10), and (16), test the hypothesis that Pt
for nationals exhibits larger val-
ues than for switchers. Finally, row (5) of each block includes the combined test
statistic D = max(|D+|, |D+|).
Results depicted in table 10 clearly confirm the findings in section 5.1.19 In
each of the three years before switching, national firms exhibit significantly smaller
performance measures than future MNEs. For all firm characteristics, distribution
functions for nationals lie to the left of those for switchers. The hypothesis that
Pt
for domestic producers exhibits larger values than for multinationals could be
18All p-values presented in table 10 are based on on the asymptotic distributions derived by
Smirnov (1939).
19Implementing KS tests with performance measures in deviation of the according sector means
did alter vertical differences D slightly but had no impact on the overall results.
14
rejected overwhelmingly. Furthermore, p-values of the combined test statistics are
not higher than 0.003 and therefore reject the null hypothesis of the equality of
distributions clearly.
Hence, my investigations so far show that not only existing MNEs outperform
national firms but also newly founded MNEs during the time before switching have
superior performance attributes compared to their national counterparts.
5.3 Ex-ante differences in growth rates
At this stage of the paper a second question emerges. If level differences in per-
formance attributes show stable premia for switchers, it seems natural to analyse
deviations of performance growth rates in the run up to becoming a multinational.
For that purpose the following regressions are run:
[logPi,T
- logPi,T-t
]/t = 0
+ 1
Switchi,T
(+ Ci,T-t
) +
+ 1
statei
+ 2
sectori
+ 3
yearT-t
+ ui,T-t
, (3)
where T is the date of switching (1997-2001) and t is the corresponding time lag
(t=1,2,3).20 Growth rates are measured as yearly averages assessed over the three
preceding years up to switching. So, the corresponding time dimensions of the
dependent variables in the estimation samples are 1996-2001, 1995-2000, and 1994-
1999.
The coefficient 1 of the Switchi,T
dummy measures the average differences
in growth rates per year between switchers and multinationals. Table 4 depicts
results for the related time lags and all performance attributes. In the three years
leading up to switching (columns (5) and (6)), employment (2 percentage points)
and total factor productivity (1-2 percentage points) exhibit significantly higher
growth rates at companies that become MNEs than at national firms.21 Average
performance growth during the two preceding years before the regime change
is significantly larger (3-4 percentage points) at future multinationals only with
respect to employment. In the last year before investing abroad, again, only
employment turns out to have superior growth rates. These are 3-5 percentage
points higher at future MNEs than at domestic companies.
20All other variables are defined according to the covariates in equation 1.
21Performance measures in deviation of the according sector means and equal sample sizes did
not alter results.

d The number of observations refer to the overall number of firms in each performance regression (N overall P) and to the
number of switchers (N treat. P). Performance measures of switchers are observed between 1994 and 2001. The formation
of new MNEs (switching) is observed between 1997 and 2001. All existing MNEs as well as switchers before and after the
time of switching were removed from the estimation sample.

Consequently, the above findings may be interpreted as evidence that firms
preparing for a forthcoming expansion to foreign markets have additional personnel
requirements. Unfortunately, with the data at hand a distinction between low and
high skilled workers is not possible. Since theory predicts that firms demand dif-
ferent amounts of high and low skilled labour, this is perhaps a field that requires
further research.
My findings up to this point show clear differences between future multination-
als and national firms. In the years prior to the regime change, switchers exhibit
higher performance attributes in levels, they are larger in size, pay higher wages,
produce with higher capital intensities, and they are more productive. Furthermore,
average employment at firms that become MNEs is found to grow faster. Hence, it
seems that success on the home market leads to self-selection into foreign markets.
6 The decision to become a multinational
Taking the selectivity issues raised at the end of chapter 5 into account necessitates
modelling the ­ possibly endogenous ­ decision to become a MNE. One of the
most common approaches to incorporate endogenous treatment effects is the Heck-
man (1978) estimator. When using this method, it is necessary to employ a probit
model that includes the determinants of the switching decision. A binary choice
model suffers from the shortcoming that it does not allow the inclusion of (foreign)
location specific variables.22 It is, however, possible to apply indirect measures that
control for host country effects. To construct such variables I use average foreign
affiliate characteristics of existing MNEs. These attributes allow an augmentation
of the probit specifications with information on host country specifics of existing
multinationals active in the same home market sector as potential switchers. Fur-
ther details of this kind of controls are discussed below.
In a recent study, Becker, Ekholm and Muendler (2005a) estimate reduced-form
location choice functions in order to control for selectivity issues in a multina-
tional's location-specific labour demand. In this section, I present an adapted ver-
sion of their first-step, location-choice model to explain driving forces behind the
decision to become a multinational.
In period t - 1 a firm's management decides whether to invest in foreign loca-

conditional or the nested logit model. For a more elaborate evaluation of this problem, see Becker,

foreign markets by exports or producing solely for the national market (Xi,t

Here, S

is a latent variable (e.g. the propensity to invest abroad), Zi,t-1 and Ys,t-1
are vectors that proxy the firm's expectations in period t - 1 with regard to the
decision rule of equation 6. Zi,t-1 exhibits variation on the firm level, whereas Ys,t-1
varies only over sectors. The dependent variable Si,t
equals 1 if a firm becomes a
MNE in period t. All existing MNEs as well as switchers before and after the time
of switching were removed from the estimation sample.

 does in general not equal xH

18
To proxy expected revenues, Ei,t-1
[p xF
i,t
], I use the log of average affiliate
turnover domestic competitors realise in their foreign locations in the year before
switching, i.e. the average revenue MNEs active in the same home market sector as
potential switchers make abroad in period t-1. To approximate expected cost ben-
efits, Ei,t-1
[ci,t

, xH

, wti,t
) - ci,t
(xF

, wti,t
)], parent firm charac-
teristics like size (ln employment), ln liabilities/total assets, ln capital/labour ratio,
ln equity, and ln average wage are used. Additionally, as a sector-specific control
variable, the log of average wages domestic competitors pay in foreign countries
are included. Since sunk costs cannot be directly measured, they are approximated
by including the number of existing MNEs from the same sector in period t - 1. To
account for the firm's innovative abilities, the log of its intangible to tangible plus
intangible assets ratio is included. For the purpose of controling intra-sector mar-
ket power, the proportion of each firm's value added to sector-wide value added is
included. Finally, in most specifications firm age serves as an additional control.24
Apart from the value-added ratio, all sector-specific variables refer to NACE 2-digit
codes. Time dummies control for the foundation of MNEs in different years. All
explanatory variables are lagged one period.
Since results of the probit estimates are of main interest with respect to the
Heckman (1978) estimator applied in section 7, only the most important findings
are briefly discussed at this point. Estimation results are depicted in table 5. Each
specification refers to another lagged productivity measure and is used as selection
equation for one of the different dependent variables of equation 9. It becomes clear
from either specification that size and productivity in t - 1 are important determi-
nants of the choice to become a MNE, i.e. high values of these attributes increase
the probability to switch. Hence, findings in chapter 5 ­ large and productive firms
go multinational ­ are supported.
In line with the existing literature, I find that domestic firms with large intangi-
ble to total assets ratios are more likely to run business abroad than firms staying on
national markets. Intangible assets are supposed to have public good characteris-
tics within multi-plant companies. Markusen (2002) generally names these kind of
assets "knowledge capital". The particular characteristics of the knowledge capital
should help companies to overcome potential sunk costs. At this point, my findings
­ a high rate of intangible assets increases the probability to switch ­ might confirm
Markusen's theory.
24In some specifications also firm age squared was included. However, I could not detect any
significant influence and therefore did not report these results in table 5.

Surprisingly, I find a positive correlation between average wages domestic com-
petitors pay at their foreign locations and the probability to go multinational. Two
arguments may solve this puzzle: First, assuming that the main motive behind in-
vesting abroad is the access to other countries' markets, high wages in foreign loca-
tions should simply reflect the fact that most FDI goes to places which are similar
to Germany in relative factor endowments. Secondly, since Blomstr¨
om, Fors and
Lipsey (1997) for Sweden and Marin (2004) for Germany and Austria report evi-
dence that MNEs tend to locate the more skill-intensive activities abroad my results
may indicate a skill-seeking motive behind German foreign direct investments.25
Finally, another interesting point is the negative influence of credit capital (short
and long run liabilities/total assets) on the probability to become a multinational.
This could both be an indicator for the negative impact of credit constraints, on the
one hand, and ­ through the different financing structure of small, medium, and
large firms in Germany ­ simply be another criterion for the size of an operation.
7 Performance after switching
Results in sections 4 ­ 6 provide clear evidence that successful firms ­ both before
and at the date of switching ­ become multinationals. Hence, the next issue at hand
is to investigate firm performance in a post-investment framework. The question at
this juncture is what happens to the efficiency of firms in the three years after their
choice to become a MNE?
7.1 Theoretical considerations of post-investment developments
Theoretical answers to this question are not clear cut. Concerning firm size, it
depends on whether the parent retains operations at home that are complemen-
tary or substitutional to foreign activities. A substitutional relationship, which is
likely when cost-saving reasons play a decisive role (vertical FDI), comes along
with smaller operations on the home market. Contrariwise, even for purely cost-
reducing FDI an employment gain at the domestic operation is possible if potential
cost reductions allow the firm to increase overall market shares. Furthermore, es-
pecially when investing in industrialized countries, market access motives and the
25To investigate this problem in more detail one needs access to both, the skill structure of foreign
subsidiaries and the skill distribution at the German parent firms. Unfortunately such information is
not available in the BuBa MIDI and USTAN data.
21
proximity-concentration trade-off need to be considered (horizontal FDI).26 In this
case, instead of exporting goods MNEs produce at the foreign location. Thus, the
employment effect is twofold: On the one hand, the home operation could be larger
if the firm exported goods to the host country. On the other hand, if there were no
other opportunity to serve the foreign market besides the set-up of a foreign affiliate,
becoming an MNE would have no negative or even positive effects on domestic firm
size. Since, in reality, the decision to become an MNE is possibly brought about
by the co-existence of both cost-reducing and market-seeking motives, the overall
effect on the parent firm is ambiguous.27
Another effect I am interested in is the impact of the switching choice on produc-
tivity. Again, different theoretical aspects should be considered in this respect. One
argument for productivity increases at the domestic firm is the public good char-
acteristic of firm-specific assets. Pfaffermayr (1999) tests for a sample of Austrian
manufacturers whether the volume of foreign output influences labour productivity
at home through multi-plant scale effects. He finds that production at subsidiaries,
Austrian firms run abroad, increases the productivity at domestic plants. However,
the reasons for productivity changes may work in both directions. Barba Navaretti
and Venables (2004) argue that also changes in the composition of factor inputs
and learning effects (technological and managerial knowledge) play a role. Since
technological and managerial knowledge exhibit public good characteristics within
firms, it seems obvious that learning through switching ­ whatever motives (verti-
cal, horizontal, or both) are behind the decision ­ should positively affect domestic
productivity. In case of changes in the composition of factor inputs, it is a priori not
clear whether home market productivity gains or loses from the decision to found
an MNE. Such changes are very likely to occur if the management vertically di-
vides the production process, meaning that labour intensive production stages are
shifted abroad. However, whether in that case efficiency at the remaining operation
increases or decreases cannot be predicted. Marin (2004) argues that Austrian and
German firms take advantage of cheap and abundant high skilled labour in Eastern
and Central Europe. Hence, in this situation the productivity evolution at the domes-
tic location might suffer. Moreover, the tremendous efforts of restructuring a newly
26In fact, a major part of German MNEs' foreign operations is concentrated in high- rather than
low-income countries.
27Becker et al. (2005c) test for substitutability of labour in different world regions and Germany.
The study conducts analysis for existing MNEs (long- or medium-term perspective) and finds for
both industrialized regions (e.g. Western Europe) and for transition countries (Central and Eastern
Europe) a substitutional relationship.
22
founded multi-plant enterprise may ­ at least in the short run ­ be accompanied by
productivity losses at the domestic location. To put it in a nutshell, with respect to
the productivity development after switching, theory provides a good rationale for
both the boost and the fall story.
Finally, also the development of average wages is theoretically not unambigu-
ously predictable. On the firm level, increasing productivity should raise wages.
The displacement of labour intensive, blue collar jobs also implies the rise of aver-
age wages. Otherwise, Marin's (2004) "skill-searching" argument could have the
reverse effect and lower average wages at the domestic location. Moreover, market
access motives do not provide any clear cut predictions, either.
To draw a conclusion on the above considerations, the effect of going multina-
tional on firms' size, productivity, average wages, and capital intensities is theoret-
ically ambiguous and it is therefore mainly an empirical question to explore how
performance differences evolve after the rise of a new multinational.
7.2 Empirical considerations of post-investment developments
After having discussed theoretical issues behind performance developments, an em-
pirical examination of the problem needs to be made. The easiest way of evaluating
the effect of a regime change on domestic firm attributes is to run simple OLS re-
gressions of the firms' average outcome changes in T + t on the switching status
and a number of initial control variables in period T:
[logPi,T+t
- logPi,T
]/t = 0
+ 1
Switchi,T
+  Ci,T
+
+ 1
statei
+ 2
sectori
+ 3
yearT
+ ui,T
, (8)
where T is the date of switching (1997-2000) and t is the time span we look ahead
(t=1,2,3). Average performance growth is assessed over a period of three years after
the decision to go multinational. The corresponding switching-dates for the differ-
ent time spans are therefore 1997-2000, 1997-1999, and 1997-1998. Additional to
firm size and firm age the vector Ci,T
proxies the average wage per firm over the av-
erage sector wage (not included if the dependent variable is average wage growth)
and value added per firm over sector wide value added (not included for value added
over employment).28
As argued in the previous chapters, it is likely that selectivity issues bias results.
Hence, equation 8 is re-estimated taking the endogeneity of the switching choice
28These variables are meant to control for the initial skill level of the firms' work force and the
competitive position within the domestic sector.

mator is used to compute the following regression:

] is called the inverse Mill's ratio (IMR),  is a stan-
dard normal density, and  is the standard normal cumulative distribution function.
Zi,T-1 and Ys,T-1 are variable vectors that proxy the firms' expectations in period
T - 1 with regard to the decision to become a MNE.29 Estimates of the correspond-
ing coefficients of these variables are taken from table 5.30 Si,T
= 1 means a firm
chooses to change status from national to multinational, and S
i,T
is a latent variable
that describes the propensity to invest. The error terms i,T
and i,T
are supposed to
be bivariate, normally distributed with correlation  ([ i,T
, i,T
]  bivariate normal
[0, 0, 1,  , ]).
The coefficient 1 of the Switchi,T
dummy in 9 measures the average treatment
effect (ATE), i.e. the expected impact of the switching decision on a randomly
drawn firm.31 A likelihood ratio (LR) test on the independence of equations 9 and 10
allows us to formally test for the occurrence of selectivity issues. If selectivity
problems are of no relevance, the ATE is already described by the OLS estimates
of the treatment dummy in equation 8. All p-values of the LR-tests are depicted
beneath the respective numbers of observations. Columns (1) and (2) of table 6
report the MNE premia in the first year after switching; columns (3) and (4) as well
29Including the vectors Zi,T -1 and Ys,T -1 increases the sample periods to 1996-2000, 1996-
1999, and 1996-1998, respectively. Hence, vis-`
a-vis the OLS regressions Heckman's procedure
comes along with a reduction in the number of observations, which is due to the unbalanced panel
structure of the data at hand. To arrive at comparable results, sample sizes of the OLS estimates were
artificially reduced to match the observations of the Heckman (1978) estimator.
30Post-investment growth rates of TFP O.P. firm-age, employment, average wages, and capital
intensities are estimated using specification (2) of table 5 as probit equation. The growth of TFP
O.P. refers to specification (1), TFP L.P. to column (4), and labour productivity to specification (3).
31As opposed to the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT), the ATE also makes statements
on units that would never be suitable for treatment. This problem can be reduced if firms were
excluded from the population that would never be eligible. Through the exclusion of existing MNEs,
switchers before and after the date of the regime change, and observations smaller and younger than
a certain threshold I've tried to adjust the estimation sample accordingly. Nevertheless, results are
still not comparable to the ATT. For a more elaborate discussion of this problem, see Wooldridge
(2002).
24
as (5) and (6) depict results for the subsequent two years. In columns (1), (3), and
(5) OLS estimates are presented, columns (2), (4), and (6) include results using the
Heckman (1978) estimator. As usual, I have dropped existing MNEs and switchers
before and after the date of switching.
Reported p-values of the LR tests show that self-selection matters. Results for
TFP growth in the first year after going multinational, labour productivity in the
first and second period after becoming a MNE, and capital intensities for the whole
sample period are significantly influenced by selectivity issues. Moreover, corre-
sponding parameter estimates without endogeneity controls exhibit no significance
at the 1%-10% level.
Compared to national firms, average TFP growth in the first year after the regime
change is significantly higher at newly founded MNEs. A randomly drawn firm's
productivity benefits from the decision to become a multinational with a premium
between 5%-7%. However, the effect lasts only for one year, i.e in later sample
periods no positive impact on productivity growth is found. This leads to the con-
clusion that the internalization of the foreign plants' knowledge capital comes along
with an immediate increase in productivity at the domestic firm. Yet, these learning
effects seem to be restricted to the first year after switching.
Average wages and capital labour ratios exhibit significant growth premia for
all years under consideration. Apart from the results for period three, parameter
estimates for average wages are not driven by self selection. Capital intensities, on
the other hand, are clearly influenced by selectivity issues during the whole sample
period. Average growth rates with respect to wages (capital intensities) are between
3-4 percentage points (1-2 percentage points) higher at newly founded MNEs than
at national firms. These developments might also be the decisive points behind the
relative expansion path of labour productivity (2-9 percentage points). With a faster
growing ratio of capital to labour and increasing average wages, it seems straight-
forward to expect superior productivity growth rates at a just-founded multinational
relative to a purely domestic one. Here, it also fits well in that ex-post employment
growth, though superior before switching, exhibits no significantly higher rates at
new multinationals. In other words, I found evidence that firms prepare for a forth-
coming expansion to foreign markets by hiring additional employees. These work-
ers then seem to meet the companies' requirements for the next three years, since
employment growth during the period after switching is no higher than at national
firms.
Summing up, the above analysis presents evidence that becoming an MNE
increases post-investment performance with respect to productivity and average

not affect firm size.
8 Conclusions
This paper investigates the extent to which performance attributes of multinational
enterprises exceed those of purely national firms, both prior and after they have
switched from national to multinational activities. For that purpose a range of firm
characteristics is evaluated. At the time of switching, newly founded MNEs exhibit
performance premia of 10% (average wages) to 100% (firm size) compared to their
nationals counterparts. Further regressions show, that multinationals already out-
perform national firms in the run up to invest abroad. Throughout this time period,
the performance gap ranges from 91%-100% with respect to firm size and exhibits
values between 22%-53% for the different productivity measures. Moreover, fu-
ture multinationals pay on average 11%-13% higher wages, and capital intensities
exceed those of national firms by 16%-25%. A two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov
(KS) test on the equality of performance distributions confirms the above results.
The tests clearly show that distribution functions of all firm characteristics for na-
tionals lie to the left of those for switchers. With regard to ex-ante growth rates
it turns out that only firm size exhibits higher rates. Average differences between
future MNEs and nationals are between 3-5 percentage points.
The use of an endogenous treatment model shows that after the decision to in-
vest abroad, selectivity issues are of importance. I find evidence that TFP in the
first year after going multinational, labour productivity in the first and second pe-
riod after becoming a MNE, and capital intensities for the whole sample period are
significantly influenced by the endogeneity of the switching decision. The dimen-
sion of ex-post growth rate differences between newly founded MNEs and domestic
firms is 3-4 percentage points with respect to wages and 5-9 percentage points for
the different productivity measures. The growth rate premia for capital labour ratios
is between 1-2 percentage points per year.
These results are in line with the opinion that international expansions of domes-
tic firms are an important channel to raise overall competitiveness. The decision to
become a multinational enterprise strengthens domestic operations. However, one
has to take into account that the presented results refer to short run developments.
The evaluation of performance measures at existing multinationals over a longer
time horizon is beyond the scope of this paper and may yield different results.

C Construction of total factor productivity
As for the estimation of total factor productivity, I classified the USTAN data set into seven
different branches (see appendix B). For each firm within an aggregated industry the fol-
lowing Cobb-Douglas production function is considered:
yi,t
= 0 + 1li,t
+ 2ki,t
+ 1ai,t
+ 2ri
+ 3tt
+ i,t
+ i,t. (11)
Lower case letters indicate logarithmic values of the according variables. Yi,t is the valued
added of firm i at time t, Li,t and Ki,t are its labour and capital inputs, Ai,t is the firm age,
ri is a regional dummy that distinguishes East- and West-German observations, tt is a linear
time trend, i,t is the part of productivity that influences the firm's input decision (unobserv-
able for the researcher), and i,t includes both a measurement error as well as unpredictable
shocks to productivity.32 Table 9 exemplifies estimation results of the above equation for
the sector Wood, Chemicals and Others during the period 1992 to 2001 using ordinary least
squares (OLS), firm-specific fixed effects (Within), Olley's and Pakes's (O.P.), and Levin-
sohn's and Petrin's (L.P.) methods to control for endogeneity. A common feature of all
estimation approaches is the assumption of constant, sector-specific production parameters
over time, i.e. each firm active in the same industry produces with the same technology but
with possibly different amounts of factor inputs. In columns (1), (2) and (4) the simple OLS
approach, which does not allow to treat i,t and i,t independently, is used. Columns (2) and
(4) augment the first specification with the firms' age and investment as additional control
variables. The within estimator of column (3) considers i,t to vary over individual firms
but to be constant over time. The results in columns (5)-(8) are based on semi-parametric
estimation methods similar to the one proposed by Olley and Pakes (1996). Finally, column
(9) is estimated using the Stata ado-file levpet (compare Levinsohn et al. (2003)).33
When applying the O.P. approach, the following assumptions are made: a) the inverted
investment function can be written as i,t
= f(ii,t, ki,t
) (ii,t is the log of investment); b)
labour is the only variable factor, i.e. its demand is influenced by contemporaneous values
of i,t; c) ki,t and ai,t are fixed variables influenced only by past values of the unobserved
productivity shocks (i,t-1). Therefore, equation 11 changes to:
yi,t
= 0 + 1li,t
+ 1ai,t
+ 2ri
+ 3tt
+ t
(ii,t, ki,t
) + i,t, (12)
where t
= 2ki,t
+ f(ii,t, ki,t
) and is approximated by a 3rd order polynomial in log
investment and log capital. Equation 12 yields consistent estimates of 0, 1, 1, 2, and
3, while the coefficient of logarithmic capital 2 is not identified. On this account, a second
step is necessary to get consistent values of 2. The second estimation equation is:
yi,t+1 -0 -1li,t+1 -1ai,t+1 -2ri
-3tt+1 = 2ki,t+1 +h(t
-2ki,t
)+i,t+1 +i,t+1,
(13)
32Hence, 0
+2ri
+3tt is a shock to productivity common to all firms in the same sector, region
and year.
33Since the ado-file is very restrictive and does not allow to include other variables than capital
and labour it mainly serves as an additional control specification.
29
where i,t+1 = i,t+1 -E(i,t+1|i,t
) and h(.) is approximated by a third order polynomial
in ki,t and t. Estimation results of the O.P. approach are presented in columns (5) to (8).34
None of the results in table 9, columns (1), (2), and (4), account for the fact that ignor-
ing i,t causes an omitted variable bias. If the correlation between unobserved, firm-specific
productivity shocks and the firm's factor demand is positive, one expects positively biased
OLS estimates. Turning to the O.P. and L.P. estimates should reduce much of the simultane-
ity problems. In fact, a comparison of columns (5) to (9) with columns (1), (2), (4) reveals
a decrease of the labour coefficient between eight percent in case of O.P. and, with sig-
nificantly more observations at hand, nineteen percent in case of Levinsohn's and Petrin's
method. The within estimator, though it suffers from the problem to model i,t as con-
stant over time, also provides evidence for a positive bias in the OLS estimates. However,
the relatively low capital coefficients are a little worrying, since they could be caused by a
potential selectivity problem that cannot be addressed with the data at hand.
To focus on three productivity measures only, the results of columns (5), (7) and (9) are
used to calculate total factor productivity. For these specifications my TFP measures are
constructed as
TFPi,t
= exp(yi,t
- 1li,t
- 2ki,t
[- Ci,t
]), (15)
where Ci,t are additional variables like firm age and other controls depending on the ac-
cording specification. In order to gain observations, I constructed out of sample predictions
for firms where the investment or intermediate input proxy was not available.
34Table 9 also includes a version where i,t is assumed to follow a random walk process (see
columns (5) and (7)). Equation 13 then reduces to:
yi,t+1
- 0
- 1li,t+1
- 1ai,t+1
- 2ri
- 3tt+1
- t
= 2
(ki,t+1
- ki,t
) + i,t+1
+ i,t+1. (14)
