Abstract
1
2
Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability worldwide, with up to two-thirds
3
of individuals experiencing long-term disabilities. Large-scale neuroimaging
4
studies have shown promise in identifying robust biomarkers (e.g., measures
5
of brain structure) of long-term stroke recovery following rehabilitation.
6
However, analyzing large rehabilitation-related datasets is problematic due to
7
barriers in accurate stroke lesion segmentation. Manually-traced lesions are
8
currently the gold standard for lesion segmentation on T1-weighted MRIs, but
9
are labor intensive and require anatomical expertise. While algorithms have
10
been developed to automate this process, the results often lack accuracy.
11
Newer algorithms that employ machine-learning techniques are promising, yet
12
these require large training datasets to optimize performance. Here we
13
present ATLAS (Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke), an open-source
14
dataset of 304 T1-weighted MRIs with manually segmented lesions and
15
metadata. This large, diverse dataset can be used to train and test lesion
16
segmentation algorithms and provides a standardized dataset for comparing
17
the performance of different segmentation methods. We hope ATLAS release
18
1.1 will be a useful resource to assess and improve the accuracy of current
19
lesion segmentation methods.

Background & Summary
1
2
Approximately 795,000 people in the United States suffer from a stroke
3
every year, resulting in nearly 133,000 deaths1. In addition, up to 2/3 of stroke
4
survivors experience long-term disabilities that impair their participation in
5
daily activities2,3. Careful clinical decision making is thus critical both at the
6
acute stage, where interventions can spare neural tissue or be used to
7
promote early functional recovery4, and at the subacute/chronic stages, where
8
effective rehabilitation can promote long-term functional recovery. Enormous
9
efforts have been made to predict outcomes and response to treatments at
10
both acute and subacute/chronic stages using brain imaging.
11
At the acute stage, within the first 24 hours or so after stroke onset,
12
clinicians face important, time-sensitive decisions such as whether to
13
intervene to save damaged tissue (e.g., administer thrombolytic drugs,
14
perform surgery). Clinical brain images such as magnetic resonance imaging
15
(MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) scans are routinely acquired to help
16
diagnose and make these urgent clinical decisions. Images obtained often
17
include lower-resolution CT scans or structural MRIs (e.g., T2-weighted,
18
FLAIR, diffusion weighted, or perfusion weighted MRIs), and impressive
19
efforts have been made to use these images to automatically detect the lesion
20
volume, predict responses to acute interventions, and predict general
21
prognosis. As clinical scans are typically a mandatory part of acute stroke
22
care, there has been excellent progress in using large-scale datasets of the
23
acquired images to relate to outcomes and build automated lesion detection
24
algorithms and predictive models over the past few decades5. In addition,
25
using imaging to assess the extent of neural injury within the first few days
26
after stroke can be helpful for informing entry criteria and stratification
27
variables for enrollment in clinical trials of early recovery therapies, which
28
have specific time windows shortly after stroke onset4.
29
On the other hand, there have been fewer advances in large-scale
30
neuroimaging-based stroke predictions at the subacute and chronic stages.
31
Here, clinicians must triage patients and assign scarce rehabilitation
32
resources to those who are most likely to benefit and recover. Brain imaging,
33
such as MRI, is primarily acquired as part of research studies to understand
34
brain-related changes in response to different therapeutic interventions or to
35
provide valuable additional information, beyond what can be gleaned from
36
bedside exams, that can be used to predict rehabilitation outcomes6. As stroke
37
is a leading cause of adult disability worldwide, there is a large emphasis
38
placed on predicting and understanding how to best promote long-term
39
rehabilitation in these individuals. Although there are fewer MRIs acquired
40
during this time, the most common research scan is a high-resolution T1-
41
weighted structural MRI, which is often acquired along with functional MRI and
42
high-resolution diffusion MRI scans and can show infarcts at the post-acute
43
stage. Research using these types of images at this stage of stroke have
44
shown promising biomarkers that could potentially provide additional
45
information, beyond behavioral assessments, to predict an individual's
46
likelihood of recovery for specific functions (e.g., motor, speech) and response
47
to treatments7-9. Thus far, measures that include the size, location, and
48
overlap of the lesion with existing brain regions or structures, such as the
49
corticospinal tract, have been successfully used as predictors of long-term
50
stroke recovery and rehabilitation9-15. However, to date, this has only been

done in smaller-scale studies, and results may conflict across studies or be
1
limited to each sample. Examining lesion properties with larger datasets at the
2
subacute and chronic stages could lead to the identification of more robust
3
biomarkers for rehabilitation that are widely applicable across diverse
4
populations. Recently, efforts for creating large-scale stroke neuroimaging
5
datasets across all time points since stroke onset have emerged and offer a
6
promising approach to achieve a better understanding of the long-term stroke
7
recovery process (e.g., ENIGMA Stroke Recovery;
8
http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/ongoing/enigma-stroke-recovery/).
9
However, a key barrier to properly analyzing these large-scale stroke
10
neuroimaging datasets to predict rehabilitation outcomes is accurate lesion
11
segmentation. While many acute neuroimaging stroke studies bypass manual
12
lesion segmentation by using a visual scoring of lesion characteristics with
13
validated scoring tools applied by expert raters, research studies that wish to
14
examine the overlap of the lesion with specific brain structures (e.g., in voxel-
15
based lesion symptom mapping, or lesion load methods) require an accurate
16
and detailed lesion map. In T1-weighted MRIs, which are often used in
17
research, the gold standard for delineating these lesions is manual
18
segmentation, a process that requires skilled tracers and can be prohibitively
19
time consuming and subjective16. A single large or complex lesion can take up
20
to several hours for even a skilled tracer. As a result of this demand on time
21
and effort, this method, which has been used in previous smaller
22
neuroimaging studies, is not suitable for larger sample sizes. Based on the
23
literature, most studies with manually segmented brain lesions on T1-weighted
24
MRIs use smaller sample sizes between 10 to just over 100 brains16-20.
25
Accurately segmenting hundreds or thousands of stroke lesions from T1-
26
weighted MRIs may thus present a barrier for larger-scale stroke
27
neuroimaging studies.
28
Many stroke neuroimaging studies have utilized semi- or fully-
29
automated lesion segmentation tools for their analyses. Semi-automated
30
segmentation tools employ a combination of automated algorithms, which
31
detect abnormalities in the MR image, and manual corrections or inputs by an
32
expert. Fully-automated algorithms rely completely on the algorithm for the
33
lesion segmentation. While these require little human input or expertise, they
34
still may require significant computational resources and processing time.
35
Many of these fully-automated algorithms employ machine learning
36
techniques that require training and testing on large datasets21, and the
37
performance of the algorithm is highly dependent on the size and diversity of
38
the training dataset. While there have been several exciting initiatives
39
regarding lesion segmentation in acute clinical imaging, discussed below,
40
there are few publically available large training/test datasets of manually
41
segmented stroke lesion masks on research-grade T1-weighted images that
42
could be used for improving such algorithms. Thus, while both semi- and fully-
43
automated lesion segmentation tools have the potential to greatly reduce the
44
time and expertise needed to analyze stroke MRI data22, it is unclear whether
45
they provide the accuracy needed for rigorous stroke lesion-based analyses.
46
In addition, it is difficult to compare the performance of automated
47
lesion segmentation tools as they are often not evaluated for performance on
48
the same dataset. Recently, some exciting initiatives have emerged to
49
develop better segmentation algorithms using standardized datasets and
50
metrics. In particular, the Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation (ISLES)

challenge is an annual satellite challenge of the Medical Image Computing
1
and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) meeting that provides a
2
standardized multimodal clinical MRI dataset of approximately 50-100 brains
3
with manually segmented lesions23. The ISLES competition encourages
4
research groups to use the dataset to evaluate their lesion segmentation
5
algorithms and predict acute outcomes to inform clinical decision making. This
6
approach is promising for developing better lesion segmentation algorithms
7
and predictive models for acute imaging. However, past ISLES challenge
8
datasets have traditionally focused more on using multimodal clinical MRIs to
9
predict more acute results, and these algorithms are not easily translatable to
10
the high-quality T1-weighted MRIs typically found in subacute/chronic stroke
11
rehabilitation research. Thus, here, we aimed to develop a complementary
12
large dataset using only anatomical T1-weighted MRIs, which are typically
13
acquired in research studies after the acute stage to assess rehabilitation
14
outcomes. We anticipate this dataset could be useful for enhancing lesion
15
segmentation methods for T1-weighted images often used in medical
16
rehabilitation research.
17
Here, we present ATLAS (Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke)
18
Release 1.1, an open-source dataset consisting of 304 T1-weighted MRIs with
19
manually segmented diverse lesions and metadata. The goal of ATLAS is to
20
provide the research community with a standardized training and testing
21
dataset for lesion segmentation algorithms on T1-weighted MRIs. We note
22
that this dataset is not representative of the full range of stroke, as this data
23
was acquired through research studies in which individuals with stroke
24
voluntarily participated, and all participants had to be eligible for a research
25
MRI session. However, this dataset may be useful for testing and comparing
26
the performance of different lesion segmentation techniques and identifying
27
key barriers hindering the performance of automated lesion segmentation
28
algorithms. We believe that this diverse set of manually segmented lesions will
29
serve as a valuable resource for researchers to use in assessing and
30
improving the accuracy of lesion segmentation tools.

Methods
33
34
Data Overview
35
304 MRI images from 11 cohorts worldwide were collected from research
36
groups in the ENIGMA Stroke Recovery Working Group consortium. Images
37
consisted of T1-weighted anatomical MRIs of individuals after stroke. These
38
images were collected primarily for research purposes and are not
39
representative of the overall general stroke population (e.g., only including
40
individuals who opt in to participate in a research study, and excluding
41
individuals with stroke who cannot undergo MRI safely).
42
For each MRI, brain lesions were identified and masks were manually
43
drawn on each individual brain in native space using MRIcron24, an open-
44
source tool for brain imaging visualization and defining volumes of interest
45
(http://people.cas.sc.edu/rorden/mricron/index.html). At least one lesion mask
46
was identified for each individual MRI. If additional, separate (non-contiguous)
47
lesions were identified, they were traced as separate masks. An expert
48
neuroradiologist reviewed all lesions to provide additional qualitative
49
descriptions of the type of stroke, primary lesion location, vascular territory,
50
and intensity of white matter disease. Finally, a separate tracer performed

quality control on each lesion mask. This included assessing the accuracy of
1
the lesion segmentations, revising the lesion mask if needed, and categorizing
2
the lesions to generate additional data such as the number of lesions in left
3
and right hemispheres, and in cortical and subcortical regions. This dataset is
4
provided in native subject space and archived (n=304). A subset of this
5
dataset was also defaced, intensity normalized, and provided in standard
6
space (normalized to the MNI-152 template, n=229; for an overview of the
7
dataset and archives, see Figure 1).
8
9
All ATLAS contributions were based on studies approved by local ethics
10
committees and were conducted in accordance with the 1964 Declaration of
11
Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The receiving site's
12
ethics committee at the University of Southern California approved the receipt
13
and sharing of the de-identified data. Data were fully de-identified by removing
14
all 18 HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability)-protected
15
health information identifiers, lesions were manually segmented on each MRI,
16
and all data were visually inspected before release. In addition, the terms of
17
the data sharing agreements were approved by the University of Southern
18
California's technology transfer office.

20
Data Characteristics
21
All T1-weighted MRI data were collected on 3T MRI scanners at a resolution
22
of 1 mm3 (isotropic), with the exception of data from cohorts 1 and 2 which
23
were collected on a 1.5T scanner with a resolution of 0.9 mm x 0.9 mm x 3.0
24
mm (excluded from the normalized dataset). Scanner information (scanner
25
strength, brand) and image resolution are included in the ATLAS meta-data,
26
and sample image header information for a subject from each of the cohorts
27
can be found in Supplementary Information.
28
29
Characteristics of the ATLAS dataset include an average lesion volume
30
across all cohorts of 2.128±3.898 x 104 mm3, with a minimum lesion size of 10
31
mm3 and a maximum lesion size of 2.838 x 105 mm3. Information regarding
32
the distribution of lesions in the ATLAS dataset (e.g., single versus multiple
33
lesions per individual, percent of lesions that are left versus right hemisphere,
34
or subcortical versus cortical) can be found in Tables 1 and 2. Overall, slightly
35
more than half of the subjects had only one lesion (58%) while the rest had
36
multiple lesions (42.1%). Lesions were roughly equally distributed between left
37
and right hemispheres (48.4% left hemisphere, 43.8% right hemisphere, 7.7%
38
other location such as brainstem or cerebellum). In this dataset, there were
39
more subcortical lesions than cortical lesions (70.7% subcortical, 21.5%
40
cortical, 7.7% other).

Training Individuals Performing Lesion Tracing
9
Eleven individuals were carefully trained in identifying and segmenting lesions.
10
Individuals had a range of backgrounds, including undergraduate students,
11
graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows. All tracers were given detailed
12
information regarding neuroanatomy, and underwent standardized training,
13
which utilized a detailed protocol as well as an instructional video. All tracers
14
were guided through the training process with extensive feedback on lesion
15
tracing performance by an expert tracer and in consultation with an expert
16
neuroradiologist. The detailed protocol, with pictures of example tracings, is

freely available and can be found on the ATLAS GitHub website
1
(https://github.com/npnl/ATLAS/). All individuals were trained on an initial set
2
of 5 brains with varying lesion sizes and locations (size range: min: 1,871
3
mm3, max: 162,015 mm3; location: cortical [Left: 0, Right: 1], subcortical [Left:
4
4, Right: 0]). After tracing the first set of 5 lesions, tracings were reviewed by
5
an experienced tracer and differences in the lesion masks were discussed
6
with the tracer. One week later, individuals retraced the lesions on the same
7
set of 5 brains, but were blinded to their first segmentation attempt to examine
8
intra-tracer reliability. After this, each lesion segmentation was reviewed by a
9
separate tracer. In addition, the primary lesion location was identified by an
10
expert neuroradiologist, who also created the meta-data (see Metadata
11
below). Any questions regarding lesion masks were referred to the
12
neuroradiologist. Inter- and intra-rater reliability measures and additional
13
technical validation of the lesion tracings can be found in Technical Validation
14
below. Finally, we note that lesion tracing is a subjective process, even across
15
trained individuals. As mentioned in Usage Notes below, any problems,
16
questions, or issues with specific lesion masks can be publically reported on
17
our ATLAS GitHub under the Issues page
18
(https://github.com/npnl/ATLAS/issues ) so that the community of users can
19
make comments and be aware of any identified issues. We will work to
20
resolve any issues in a timely manner.
21
22
Identifying and Tracing Lesions
23
To identify lesions, each T1-weighted MRI image was displayed using the
24
multiple view option in MRIcron20, which displays the brain in the coronal,
25
sagittal, and axial view (see Figure 2). To identify lesions, tracers looked for
26
darker intensities within typically healthy tissue. For lesions that were more
27
difficult to detect with the grayscale setting, colored look-up table settings
28
(e.g., "cardiac", "NIH", or "spectrum" settings in MRIcron) were used to provide
29
additional insight. Once the lesion or lesions were identified, the lesion mask
30
was traced using either the coronal or axial view, using either a mouse, track
31
pad, or tablet (i.e. Wacom Intuos Draw). A combination of MRIcron tools was
32
used to draw the lesion masks, which included the 3D fill tool, the pen tool and
33
the closed pen tool. Typically, and especially for larger sized lesions, tracers
34
used the 3D fill tool to begin the segmentation. Crosshairs were placed in the
35
center of the identified lesion and the tool would fill in voxels similar to the one
36
at the point of origin with the selected radius and at the sensitivity specified by
37
the difference from origin and difference at edge tools. The pen and closed
38
pen tool, typically was used to fill in (or remove) the areas that the 3D tool had
39
missed or was used to trace smaller lesions slice by slice. Once completed,
40
lesion masks were saved in the volume of interest (VOI) file format with the
41
identifier name "cXXXXsXXXXtXX_LesionRaw" (see Data Records and Table
42
3 below for full naming conventions). Lesions masks were then checked for
43
correctness by a separate tracer, who made additional corrections to the
44
lesion mask, if needed. After lesions were identified as being correct, masks
45
were smoothed using MRIcron's smooth VOI tool where the full width half
46
maximum parameter was set to 2 mm and the threshold was set to 0.5. These
47
masks were saved in both VOI and NIfTI file formats with the identifier name
48
"cXXXXsXXXXtXX_LesionSmooth".
49
Any additional lesions that were not contiguous with the primary lesion
50
mask were drawn as separate lesion masks and labeled. As described in Data

Records, any secondary lesions followed the same procedures as the primary
1
lesion mask, but were labeled as Lesion_1, Lesion_2, Lesion_3 and so on,
2
with the naming convention moving from the largest to smallest mask (e.g.,
3
Lesion_1 is the largest secondary lesion mask). In general, the primary lesion
4
mask was the largest lesion, with any secondary lesion masks subsequently
5
named and ordered by size (largest to smallest). The only exception to this
6
was, in the case of multiple lesions, if the neuroradiologist identified a primary
7
stroke location as a different lesion from the largest lesion mask. In these
8
cases, we used the lesion identified by the neuroradiologist as the primary
9
mask. This occurred in less than 5% of the subjects.
10
11
Metadata
12
For each lesion, we also provided metadata on the lesion properties to give
13
the user additional qualitative information, beyond the binary lesion mask. This
14
information can be used to quickly sort the dataset based on specific lesion
15
characteristics (e.g., only left hemisphere lesions, or only subcortical lesions).
16
It can also provide additional insight into the types of lesions that succeed or
17
fail for a given lesion segmentation algorithm. The lesion properties were
18
manually reported for each individual lesion mask. These include the number
19
of lesions identified and traced, and the location of each lesion (i.e. right/left,
20
subcortical, cortical, or other). In order to count each lesion only once, we
21
defined subcortical lesions as lesions that are contained completely in the
22
white matter and subcortical structures. Any lesion that extends beyond this
23
area and into the cortex is considered a cortical lesion. In this way, cortical
24
lesions may extend into the subcortical space, but subcortical lesions do not
25
extend into the cortical space. "Other" includes the brainstem and cerebellum.
26
An experienced neuroradiologist also identified the following information for
27
each individual brain: the type of stroke (e.g., embolic, hemorrhagic), primary
28
stroke location, vascular territory, and intensity of white matter disease
29
(periventricular hyperintensities, or PVH, and deep white matter
30
hyperintensities, or DWMH). White matter hyperintensities were graded using
31
the Fazekas scale25. For periventricular hyperintensities, the following grades
32
were applied: 0 = absence, 1 = "caps" or pencil-thin lining, 2 = smooth "halo",
33
3 = irregular PVH extending into the deep white matter. For deep white matter
34
hyperintensities, the following grades were applied: a = absence, 1 = punctate
35
foci, 2 = beginning confluence of foci, 3 = large confluent areas. The white
36
matter hyperintensity ratings are included because areas of white matter
37
hyperintensity often pose challenges for lesion segmentation algorithms.
38
Finally, scanner strength, brand/model, and image resolution are included in
39
the metadata as well.
40
41
Normalization to a Standard Template, Intensity Normalization, and Defacing
42
To expand access to the dataset, we have also provided a subset of the data
43
that is defaced, intensity-normalized, and normalized to standard (MNI-152)
44
space. Lesion segmentation algorithms vary in whether the input should be in
45
native (subject) space or a standardized space. Therefore, to provide this
46
option for users, we also generated a version of the ATLAS dataset in
47
standard space. To convert the images to standard space, MRI images first
48
underwent automated correction for intensity non-uniformity and intensity
49
standardization using custom scripts derived from the MINC-toolkit26
50
(https://github.com/BIC-MNI/minc-toolkit). These corrected images were

linearly registered to the MNI-152 template using a version that was
1
nonlinearly constructed and symmetric (version 2009;
2
http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesAtlases/ICBM152NLin2009) to normalize
3
their intracranial volume in a standardized stereotaxic space27. Using the
4
resulting transformation matrix, the labels drawn on the MRI images were also
5
registered to the MNI template. The MRI images were resampled using the
6
linear interpolation whereas their labels used a nearest neighborhood
7
interpolation to keep their binary nature. Finally . Freesurfer's mri_deface tools
8
were used to perform the defacing (e.g., to remove any facial structures)
9
(https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/mri_deface) on all T1-weighted
10
images.
11
Due to technical difficulties and differences in scanner image quality, a
12
subset of brains is not included in the standard space conversion, resulting in
13
a total of n=229 ATLAS brains converted into standard MNI space. Scans
14
from the two cohorts with 0.9 x 0.9 x 3.0 mm resolution images, collected on
15
1.5T scanners, were excluded from this standardized dataset due to their
16
lower resolution. In addition, any images that failed registration were excluded.
17
Primary reasons for failed registration include large lesion volumes or poor
18
image quality (e.g., image artifacts, motion artifacts). We are currently working
19
on manually editing the registrations for these images, which will be released
20
in the future. This dataset can be widely accessed from the FCP-INDI archive
21
(see Figure 1 and Table 3 for archive details). All images were named in
22
accordance with the INDI data policy, following the Brain Imaging Data
23
Structure (BIDS), and a meta-data sheet using the INDI naming convention is
24
included with this dataset.
25
26
Probabilistic Spatial Mapping of ATLAS Lesion Labels
27
We also created a probabilistic spatial mapping of the lesion labels solely to
28
visualize the distribution of lesion masks across the normalized ATLAS
29
dataset. We note that this does not provide a representation of a true stroke
30
distribution, but rather shows the distribution of lesions included in this
31
dataset. To do this, we performed a population-based averaging of all the
32
individual primary lesion labels in MNI space, producing a voxel-wise map
33
where values can range from 0 at each voxel (always background for all
34
subjects) to 1 (100% presence of the lesion label across subjects). A
35
probabilistic spatial map of the primary lesions can be found in Figure 3 and a
36
3D visualization of the lesion map can be found in the following video link:
37
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag5CUsRNY9Q. In addition, this map has
38
also been provided in NIfTI format (.nii.gz) and uploaded to NeuroVault.org,
39
an open-source database for neuroimaging data where it can be freely
40
accessed (https://neurovault.org/collections/3073/).

for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). ICPSR is the world's largest social

hosts many widely available neuroimaging datasets such as the Functional
1
Connectome Project (FCP-INDI). See Usage Notes for more details regarding
2
access.
3
For the full dataset archived with ICPSR, the naming convention and
4
description of the files in ATLAS R1.1 can be found in Table 3. Within the
5
ATLAS R1.1 main folder, there is an excel file with the metadata for the entire
6
dataset. The data in this archive is in native space (i.e., original subject space;
7
n=304). Throughout the dataset, MRIs are named and sorted based on each
8
cohort (c); each cohort is in the format of cXXXX where XXXX is the number
9
that the cohort was assigned (e.g., c0001). There are 11 total cohorts. Within
10
each cohort folder are the individual subject(s) folders. Subject folders are
11
named based on the cohort that they are in (cXXXX), the subject number that
12
they were assigned (sXXXX) and the time point at which they were taken
13
(tXX) (e.g. c0001s0004t01). For instance, participants with data taken two
14
weeks apart would have two time points, where t01 is the first time point and
15
t02 is the second. Every image starts with the subject identifier of
16
cXXXXsXXXXtXX.
17
Each subject folder has several components: at minimum, each will
18
have the original T1-weighted MRI image (*.nii.gz) and three masks for the
19
main lesion: the unsmoothed lesion mask (*LesionRaw.voi), and two
20
smoothed lesion masks in .voi and .nii.gz formats (*LesionSmooth.voi;
21
*LesionSmooth.nii.gz). The LesionRaw volume is the original hand-traced
22
lesion volume, while the LesionSmooth volume used a Gaussian smoothing
23
kernel (full width half maximum parameter set to 2 mm, threshold set to 0.5, to
24
overcome small errors between slices in tracing; see Methods above). We
25
anticipated that most researchers would use the LesionSmooth volume as it is
26
slightly more robust to small slice-by-slice human errors, and therefore
27
created the .nii.giz version from this. Notably, the .voi files are in an MRIcron
28
format so the masks can be further edited in MRICron if desired. The .nii.gz
29
files use the standard NIfTI format28 (http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/), which
30
can be opened, edited, and viewed by most standard neuroimaging software.
31
If a particular subject had multiple lesions, for each additional lesion,
32
there would be three additional lesion masks (e.g. *LesionRaw_1.voi,
33
*LesionSmooth_1.voi, *LesionSmooth_1.nii.gz). In general, lesions were
34
ranked based on size where the largest lesion was considered the main
35
lesion. As mentioned previously, if the largest lesion differed from the primary
36
lesion identified by the neuroradiologist, we deemed the primary lesion to be
37
the one identified by the neuroradiologist. This occurred in less than 5% of
38
cases.
39
Finally, in the FCP-INDI archive (standardized dataset, n=229), there is
40
a separate naming convention, following the Brain Imaging Data Structure
41
(http://bids.neuroimaging.io/), adopted by FCP-INDI. Images in this dataset
42
have been normalized to a standard MNI-152 template, intensity normalized,
43
and defaced. Table 3 provides a list of all naming conventions and filenames,

Technical Validation
3
Each trained tracer created lesion masks for the same five brains twice,
4
one week apart, to assess both inter- and intra-tracer reliability. Training
5
lesions ranged in size and difficulty (see Methods). Each tracer's lesion masks
6
were compared, providing both inter- and intra-rater reproducibility measures.
7
We first calculated inter- and intra-rater reliability measures using the lesion
8
volumes. Based on lesion volumes, the inter-rater reliability was 0.76±0.14,
9
while the intra-rater reliability was 0.84±0.09.
10
In addition, we also calculated inter-and intra-rater reliability using the
11
Dice similarity coefficient (DC), which is a segmentation accuracy metric, and
12
Hausdorff's distance (HD), which is a metric of the maximum distance
13
between two volumes surface points. DC allows us to examine not only if the
14
volumes are similar, but also if the same voxels are being selected as part of
15
the lesion mask or not. This is particularly useful for comparing neuroimaging
16
volumes, such as lesion masks. DC is calculated by the formula:
17
 =
2   
 + ||
18
19
where X and Y represent the voxels from each lesion segmentation, and DC
20
ranges from 0 to 1 (where 0 means there were no overlapping voxels and 1
21
means that the segmentations were completely the same). HD allows us to
22
examine the distance between the surfaces of two images and thus can be
23
used to identify outliers, providing another useful metric for comparing
24
neuroimaging volumes. HD is calculated by the formula:

where x and y represent the surface points from the volumes X and Y
2
respectively. HD is measured in millimeters, and a lower value denotes that
3
the maximum distance between the two images is smaller.
4
Inter-rater scores (DC, HD) were calculated for each manual
5
segmentation by comparing each individual tracer's lesion mask to the rest of
6
the tracers' lesion masks. Inter-rater DC and inter-rater HD scores were then
7
averaged to obtain one final DC score and one final HD score for the initial
8
segmentations (average inter-rater DC for first segmentation: 0.73±0.20;
9
average inter-rater HD for first segmentation: 22.57±21.36mm) and for the
10
second segmentations (average inter-rater DC for second segmentation:
11
average inter-rater HD for second segmentations: 25.29±23.53mm).
12
Furthermore, intra-rater DC and HD scores were calculated for each brain
13
traced by comparing the initial segmentation to the secondary segmentation
14
for each tracer; these scores were then averaged to obtain a final intra-rater
15
DC score (0.83±0.13) and a final intra-rater HD value (21.02±22.66mm).
16
Trained tracers segmented all lesion masks. In addition, each lesion
17
mask was checked by a separate tracer, and changes were made to the
18
lesion mask as needed. Any difficulty identifying the lesion was discussed with
19
the expert neuroradiologist. Lastly, after the completion of the dataset, lesion
20
masks were checked a second time to ensure correct segmentation and data
21
descriptors. It is important to note that while tracers did participate in a
22
thorough training process and segmentations were checked multiple times,
23
this is still a subjective process. Comments regarding the lesion masks can be
24
submitted as issues on the ATLAS GitHub site
25
(https://github.com/npnl/ATLAS/issues), and we plan to publish updated and
26
expanded versions of this dataset based on feedback and comments from
27
users (see Usage Notes).
