Introduction
"If you woke up tomorrow, and your problem had disap-
peared, what would be different?" This question is referred
to in the clinical psychology literature as the "miracle ques-
tion" and was pioneered by Insoo Kim Berg and Steve de
Shazer (e.g., De Shazer, 1982, 1988), two therapists whose
work focused on having clients first imagine their lives
without a problem and then make changes that fit with this
new conceptualization of their lives.Although this approach
was developed as a therapeutic tool, it arguably has utility
outside of the therapeutic context. Consider the problem of
heterosexism or homonegativity, which the majority of the
literature in disciplines like sociology and psychology has
understandably focused on reducing.Although this research
has been necessary and informative, it may be useful to
incorporate an approach that focuses not on the problem of
heterosexism but rather on what the world would look like
if it did not exist and homosexuality was completely
accepted. Worthington, Dillon, and Becker-Schutte (2005)
appeared to support such a focus when they noted the
following:
[R]esearch on heterosexual attitudes toward LGB [lesbian, gay,
and bisexual] individuals typically relies on instruments that are
intended to measure homophobia. In fact, the term LGB-
affirmativeness (i.e., positive, affirmative attitudes toward LGB
individuals) is often assumed to be the absence (or reduction) of
homophobia and heterosexism, or it is not specifically defined at
all. Therefore, as heterosexual attitudes toward LGB individuals
reflect widening complexities, it is critical that scientific
measurement provides increasing precision of range and
dimensionality. (p. 104, emphasis in original)
To that end, we asked undergraduate and graduate stu-
dents to what extent they would agree that a list of state-
ments represented or matched their views of what the
complete acceptance of homosexuality in the United States
would look like. As we will discuss in more detail in the
"Measures" section, the majority of these statements were
derived from measures of heterosexism. While we agree
with Worthington etal. (2005) that the acceptance of homo-
sexuality is more than the absence of heterosexism, this
absence would at least partially constitute acceptance, so the
conceptualization of heterosexism can provide a foundation
for the conceptualization of acceptance. In addition, the lit-
erature on heterosexism includes numerous measures that
cover a range of attitudes and behaviors. Because these
measures have already been created and tested, we decided
to reframe them to address acceptance rather than create
completely new measures.

Undergraduate and Graduate Students'
Descriptions of the Complete Acceptance
of Homosexuality
Craig Tollini1 and Julie C. Herbstrith1
Abstract
Based on the idea that researchers may better understand attitudes regarding homosexuality by focusing on acceptance
rather than heterosexism, we utilized an online survey to ask 437 undergraduate and graduate students at a medium-sized,
Midwestern, public university to what extent they would agree that a list of 24 statements matched their views of what the
complete acceptance of homosexuality in the United States would look like. The findings indicated that participants generally
endorsed a range of statements, though the level of support and the number of endorsed items varied. The relationships
between the items participants endorsed, and either their sexual orientation, experiences with gay men and lesbians, or levels
of heterosexism, are also discussed, as are implications and suggestions for future research.

Method
Participant Selection
During the spring 2014 semester, undergraduate and graduate
students from a medium-sized, Midwestern, public university
were recruited in three ways. First, the study was one of the
options provided to a subject pool, which included all of the
undergraduate students currently enrolled in any general edu-
cation course in psychology. Second, an email message was
sent to 500 randomly selected graduate students and 5,500
randomly selected undergraduate students who were not part
of the psychology subject pool, with a reminder email sent
about 1 week later. Third, we announced the survey at a meet-
ing of the university's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender,
Questioning, Queer, Asexual and Ally (LGBTQA) student
organization, and the organization's president sent an email
message with a link to the survey to the organization's mem-
bers shortly after this meeting. This link was the same as the
link in the email sent to the 6,000 randomly selected students,
whereas a different link was provided to the psychology pool
so their participation could be tracked and they would receive
course credit. The participants solicited by email or the orga-
nizational meeting did not receive any compensation. The
researchers did not have access to any identifying information
for the psychology subject pool. Regardless of how they were
solicited, students had until the end of the semester to com-
plete the survey.
Sample
The sample consisted of 437 students, 191 of whom were
recruited from the psychology subject pool and 246 of whom
were solicited via email or the LGBTQAstudent organization.
Only 15 of the 246 participants responded after the project was
announced at the organization's meeting, so we estimate that
this is the number of participants solicited from the organiza-
tion and that the remaining 231 participants responded to the
recruitment email, which had been sent more than 1 week ear-
lier. This would provide a response rate of 3.9% for those who
received the email; the response rate would be 4.1% if all 246
respondents were assumed to have been solicited by the email
message. Although it is possible to calculate a response rate
for the psychology subject pool, such a rate would be tentative
because of other factors that influenced participation (e.g., the
amount of credits students needed and their personal prefer-
ences for one study over another).
Table 1 presents the demographic information for the
sample and the population. The population data came from
the university and were based on the fall 2013 semester as
data for the spring 2014 semester were not publicly avail-
able. The sample appeared to be largely representative of the
population, and the difference in the percentages of graduate
students may simply result from graduate students not being
included in the psychology subject pool.
Procedure
The survey received institutional review board (IRB)
approval and was conducted online via SurveyMonkey. The
first page of the survey contained the informed consent docu-
ment. The survey itself consisted of three sections, which
assessed of heterosexism and other attitudes regarding
homosexuality, descriptions of the acceptance of homosexu-
ality, and demographic items, respectively. We will discuss
acceptance first as it is the central variable.
Measures
Descriptions of the acceptance of homosexuality.Given the
relative absence of literature that directly addressed the
acceptance of homosexuality, we needed to construct
the measures of this concept. As noted in the "Introduction"
section, the literature on heterosexism provided some guid-
ance in the construction of these measures, which assessed
the extent to which participants agreed that a given statement
matched their personal definitions of acceptance. There were
24 items, and participants endorsed each item using the fol-
lowing options: strongly disagree, disagree, slightly dis-
agree, slightly agree, agree, strongly agree, and unsure/
don't know. Table 2 provides the full wording of each item,
and the items were preceded by the following phrase: "If
homosexuality was fully accepted in our society, I would
expect that . . ." In the following paragraphs, we will discuss
our rationale for the inclusion of each of the 24 items.
Six of the items (Items 1-5 and Item 10) addressed more
traditional forms of heterosexism, including viewing homo-
sexuality as immoral and committing violent acts against
gays and lesbians (Adolfsen, Jurjen, & Keuzenkamp, 2010;
Morrison, Morrison, & Franklin, 2009; Rankin, Weber,
Blumenfeld, & Frazer, 2010; Worthington etal., 2005; Yang,
1997). Including these items enabled us to assess whether the
participants endorsed the decrease in heterosexism as part of
their personal descriptions of the total acceptance of
homosexuality.
Eight other items (Items 11-18) addressed more expanded
conceptualizations of heterosexism. The inclusion of these
items enabled us to determine whether participants endorsed
these additional ideas (or more accurately their reduction) as
part of their descriptions of acceptance. Items 16 to 18
addressed positive and negative stereotypes of gays and les-
bians, as well as the belief that gays and lesbians are gender
atypical or nonconforming. These items addressed two of the
forms of heterosexism discussed by Walls (2008). The first
form was hostile heterosexism, or negative beliefs and atti-
tudes about gays and lesbians (e.g., gay men are pedophiles
and lesbians hate men), and the second was positive stereo-
typic heterosexism, or positive or neutral beliefs and atti-
tudes that reinforced stereotypes about gays and lesbians
(e.g., gay men are creative and lesbians are independent),
including the belief that gay men and lesbians violate gender
Tollini and Herbstrith 3
roles (e.g., Blashill & Powlishta, 2009). We included Item
11, which addressed the absence of a negative reaction to
public displays of affection between same-sex couples,
because Adolfsen etal. (2010) argued for including similar
questions because "[h]ow people react to homosexuals in
their personal environment or what they think of the visibil-
ity of homosexuality in public (like two men kissing) is not
taken into account" in the literature (p. 1238).
Items 12 to 15 were included to directly focus on "affir-
mative" behaviors, to borrow language from Worthington
etal. (2005). These items specifically addressed heterosexu-
als wanting to have gay and lesbian friends (Item 12), view-
ing gays and lesbians as beneficial to the country (Item 13),
knowing the central figures and events in "gay" history (Item
14), and attending "Gay Pride" parades (Item 15). Similarly,
Brown, Clarke, Gortmaker, and Robinson-Keilig (2004)
included measures that addressed participants' involvement
in LGBT programs and interest in learning about LGBT con-
cerns, history, and culture, and the item regarding a desire for
gay and lesbian friends (Item 12) also connects to the litera-
ture on courtesy stigma (i.e., the belief that someone who
associates with gays and lesbians is also gay or lesbian, for
example, Neuberg, Smith, Hoffman, & Russell, 1994;
Sigelman, Howell, Cornell, Cutright, & Dewey, 1991).
Items 6 to 9 were inspired by other literature related to
heterosexism, though this literature did not focus on the
measurement of this concept. Items 6 and 7 centered on the
meaning of "fag." Although this term has generally been pre-
sented as homophobic (e.g., Burn, 2008), a handful of
researchers have begun arguing that young men who engage
in "fag discourse" actually focus on masculinity instead of
sexuality (e.g., McCormack, 2012; Pascoe, 2007). As at least
some people disconnect terms like "fag" from sexuality, they
may not view the elimination of such terms as one aspect of
the complete acceptance of homosexuality. Items 6 and 7
were included to assess this possibility. Item 8 was included
given the literature that discussed people's, particularly
men's, discomfort at being hit on by members of the same
sex (e.g., Pirlott & Neuberg, 2014) to see whether partici-
pants would endorse the absence of such discomfort as part
of their personal descriptions of acceptance. Finally, Item 9
was included to address the concept of homohysteria, which
McCormack (2012) defined as "the cultural fear of being
homosexualized" (p. 44), and Anderson (2011) defined as
"the fear men maintain of being socially perceived as gay"
(p. 253). As with the previous item, this item was included
because participants could endorse the absence of homohys-
teria as part of their descriptions of acceptance.
Items 19 to 23 were included because we believed par-
ticipants might endorse the ideas contained in them. The
first two of these items addressed the ideas that acceptance
could be described as heterosexuals seeing sexual attraction

as the only thing differentiating gay men and lesbians from
heterosexuals (Item 19) and as heterosexuals seeing homo-
sexuality as just another form of attraction (Item 20). These
items were similar to questions Yang (1997) described
being used in various polls, which asked participants
whether they viewed homosexuality as an acceptable alter-
native lifestyle. Similarly, Item 21 addressed the idea that
acceptance could be described as heterosexuals not being
concerned about sexual orientation. Items 22 and 23
differed from the items discussed so far in that they included
people having negative views of homosexuality within the
description of acceptance. In these questions, respondents
were asked whether they would endorse heterosexuals not
expressing their negative views of homosexuality or not
allowing those views to affect how they treated gay men
and lesbians in their descriptions of acceptance. These
items were similar to those included among Worthington
etal.'s (2005) measures.

Tollini and Herbstrith 5
Finally, Item 24 addressed legal equality. This item was
included given the extent to which legal equality has been put
forward as a marker of acceptance in the literature (Brewer,
2008; Jones, Cox, & Navarro-Rivera, 2014; Mucciaroni,
2008) and included in previous surveys and polls regarding
heterosexism or broader attitudes toward homosexuality
(Adolfsen etal., 2010; Worthington etal., 2005; Yang, 1997).
Additional demographic variables.In addition to the items
included in Table 1, we also asked participants whether they
were members of the university's LGBTQA student organi-
zation and whether they personally knew anyone who was
gay or lesbian, with "yes" and "no" as the response options
for both questions. Participants who indicated they knew
someone who was gay or lesbian were also asked to provide
the number of gay men and lesbians they knew.
These items, as well as the item that measured sexual ori-
entation (see Table 1), were included because participants'
sexual orientation, experiences with gay men and lesbians,
and exposure to "gay culture" could all affect their knowl-
edge of the lived experiences of gay men and lesbians. This
knowledge could, in turn, affect which statements the partici-
pants endorsed. For instance, heterosexual participants with
gay and lesbian friends may have heard from those friends
about being harassed when they engaged in public displays
of affection. As a result, these participants may endorse the
absence of such harassment as part of their description of the
complete acceptance of homosexuality. In addition, previous
research has described how membership in LGBTQA orga-
nizations affected members' identities and preferred strate-
gies for seeking social change (e.g., Renn, 2007), which
supports the idea that organizational membership can affect
people's ideas. The contact hypothesis, which posits that
interpersonal contact with a minority group (e.g., gay men
and lesbians) may lead to lower levels of prejudice (e.g.,
Allport, 1954; Dovidio, Gaertner, & Kawakami, 2003), also
supports the idea that the number of gay men and lesbians
known to the participants, particularly the heterosexual par-
ticipants, could impact which statements they endorsed
because increased contact could increase understanding.
Heterosexism.We used Walls's (2008) Multidimensional
Heterosexism Inventory (MHI) to measure participants' lev-
els of heterosexism. The MHI included 23 statements, to
which the participants indicated their levels of agreement.
The responses options for these items matched those for the
descriptions of the acceptance. Each item in the MHI
addressed one of four different types of heterosexism Walls
discussed. The first type was paternalistic heterosexism or
"subjectively neutral or positive attitudes, myths, and beliefs
that express concern for the physical, emotional, or cognitive
well-being of non-heterosexual [sic] persons while concur-
rently denying, denigrating, stigmatizing, and/or segregating
any non-heterosexual form of behavior, identity, relation-
ship, or community" (e.g., "I would prefer my daughter not
be homosexual because she would unfairly be stopped from
adopting children"; Walls, 2008, pp. 27-28). The second type
was aversive heterosexism or "attitudes . . . that dismiss or
trivialize the importance of sexual orientation on life
chances" (e.g., "Gay men should stop shoving their lifestyle
down everyone's throat"; Walls, 2008, pp. 29-30). The third
type was amnestic heterosexism or "attitudes . . . that dis-
miss, belittle, or disregard the impact of sexual orientation on
life chances" (e.g., "Discrimination against lesbians is virtu-
ally nonexistent in today's society"; Walls, 2008, p. 46). The
fourth type was positive stereotypic heterosexism, which
was discussed above and was measured with items like "Les-
bians are better than heterosexual women at physically
defending themselves."
Following Walls (2008), we conducted a factor analysis
to confirm that the items intended to measure one type of
heterosexism loaded on the same factor. Our findings, which
are available upon request, were similar to Walls, and we
further followed him by calculating four indices. Each index
provided the average score for the items that measured a
given type of heterosexism. A higher score for each index or
subscale indicated stronger agreement to the items in that
subscale and, therefore, higher levels of that type of
heterosexism.
We included the MHI because it can serve as a measure of
the participants' understanding of the discrimination and
prejudice that gay men and lesbians experience. More spe-
cifically, the items in the Paternalistic subscale acknowledge
this discrimination, whereas the items in the Amnestic and
Aversive subscales challenge or dismiss it. As we mentioned
in the previous section, participants'beliefs about the experi-
ences of gay men and lesbians could affect their endorsement
of the descriptions of acceptance. We expected that partici-
pants with lower scores on the Amnestic and Aversive sub-
scales and higher scores on the Paternalistic subscale would
be more likely to endorse the descriptions of acceptance
because these participants would arguably be more aware of
the various forms of discrimination gay men and lesbians
face. The Positive Stereotypic subscale addressed a different
set of beliefs, namely, the extent to which participants
endorsed positive or neutral stereotypes of gay men and les-
bians. Including this last subscale enabled us to determine
whether the participants' scores for this subscale correlated
with their responses to the descriptions of acceptance that
focused on positive or neutral stereotypes (Items 16 and 17).
We anticipated that participants with higher scores would be
less likely to endorse these descriptions of acceptance
because they may not view the elimination of these stereo-
types, which they hold, as necessary for homosexuality to be
completely accepted.
Results
Almost three fourths of the sample selected either of the
three agree categories (strongly agree, agree, or slightly
6 SAGE Open
agree) for the statements regarding heterosexuals not hating
gay men and lesbians, heterosexuals believing that only sex-
ual attraction differentiates gay men and lesbians from het-
erosexuals, and full legal equality (Items 3, 19, and 24,
respectively; see Table 2). About two thirds of the partici-
pants selected any of the agree categories for the statements
regarding heterosexuals not thinking homosexuality is
immoral, not thinking homosexual acts are disgusting, not
committing violent acts against gay men or lesbians, not
teasing or harassing gay men or lesbians, not being upset if
they found out someone they knew was gay or lesbian, not
being upset if they saw a same-sex couple showing affection,
attending "Gay Pride" parades, viewing homosexuality as
another type of attraction, not allowing negative views to
affect how they treat gay men and lesbians, and not express-
ing negative views in front of gay men or lesbians (Items 1,
2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 15, 20, 22, and 23, respectively). At least half
of the participants selected any agree category for all of the
remaining items except those regarding heterosexuals not
using "fag" at all, not being upset if someone of the same sex
flirted with them or if someone thought they were gay or
lesbian, wanting to have gay and lesbian friends, and know-
ing "gay" history (Items 7, 8, 9, 12, and 14, respectively).
Similarly, the highest percentage of participants (45.5%)
selected "strongly agree" for the item regarding legal equal-
ity (Item 24). The other items with the higher percentages of
participants who selected "strongly agree" (30% or higher)
addressed heterosexuals not hating gay men or lesbians, not
committing violent acts against gay men or lesbians, not
teasing or harassing gay men or lesbians, not using "fag" to
refer to gay men or lesbians, not being upset if someone they
knew was gay or lesbian or if they saw a same-sex couple
showing affection, believing that only attraction differenti-
ates gay men and lesbians from heterosexuals, viewing
homosexuality as another type of sexual attraction, and not
allowing any negative views to affect how they treat gay men
and lesbians (Items 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 19, 20, and 22,
respectively).
To measure how many items each participant endorsed,
we created a variable that provided the number of items for
which each participant selected any of the three agree cate-
gories. To construct this variable, we first dummy coded all
24 items, with participants receiving a value of 1 if they
selected any of the agree categories, and then we calculated
a simple count of those dummy coded variables. The counts
were constructed so participants who selected "don't know"
or skipped one or more of the acceptance items still had a
number calculated. Only participants who skipped and/or
answered "don't know" for all of the items had a missing
value. The count variable had a possible and actual maxi-
mum of 24, and participants with higher values endorsed
more items. The distribution was negatively skewed, with a
mean of 14.46, a median of 16, and a mode of 24. In addition,
the range was 24, the standard deviation was 8.10, the first
quartile was 7, and the third quartile was 22.
We conducted additional analyses to see whether the
number of items participants endorsed varied depending on
their sexual orientation, membership in the university's
LGBTQA student organization, and the number of gay men
and lesbians they knew. For these analyses, we combined the
sexual orientation minority categories because of their rela-
tively low frequencies, and we transformed the variable
regarding how many gay men and lesbians participants knew
into a categorical variable. The categories for this new vari-
able were none, 1, 2 to 5, 6 to 10, and more than 10.
Heterosexuals had a significantly lower mean than non-
heterosexuals--13.58 compared with 18.26, respectively,
t(145.67) = 5.37, p < .001. Although members of the univer-
sity's LGBTQA student organization had a higher mean than
nonmembers (16.48 compared with 14.27, respectively), this
difference was not significant, t(418) = 1.48, p = .139, per-
haps because only 31 participants (7.3%) indicated they were
members. There was a positive and significant relationship
between the number of items participants endorsed and the
number of gay men and lesbians they knew (Gamma = .262,
p < .001), though it should be noted that only 13 participants
(3.7%) indicated they did not know any gay men or lesbians,
and only 16 (4.5%) indicated they knew only one.
As the results for sexual orientation were significant and
the sample contained 85 (19.7%) nonheterosexual partici-
pants, we conducted additional analyses to determine
whether those participants were more likely to endorse cer-
tain items than the heterosexual participants. The results of
these analyses, presented in Table 3, indicated that hetero-
sexuals were less likely to select any of the agree categories
for all 24 items, and this difference was significant for all but
three of the items. The results were not significant for the
items that addressed heterosexuals attending "Gay Pride"
parades, believing that only attraction differentiated gay men
and lesbians from heterosexuals, and not expressing negative
views in front of gay men and lesbians (Items 15, 19, and 23,
respectively).
The final set of analyses included the MHI subscales. We
calculated Pearson correlation coefficients for the count vari-
able and the Aversive, Amnestic, and Paternalistic subscales.
Two of these coefficients were significant. The Aversive sub-
scale had a moderate, negative correlation (r = -.441, p <
.001), and the Amnestic subscale had a weak, negative cor-
relation (r = -.212, p < .001). The higher the participants'
scores were on both of these subscales, the more of each of
these two types of heterosexism they endorsed and the fewer
of the acceptance items they endorsed. The Paternalistic sub-
scale also had a weak, negative correlation, but this coeffi-
cient was not significant (r = -.066, p = .212).
For the Positive Stereotypic subscale, we calculated
Gammas for the subscale scores and the responses to the two
acceptance items that addressed positive or neutral stereo-

Discussion
Overall, these findings demonstrate the value of applying the
"miracle question" to people's attitudes regarding homosex-
uality. One benefit is that separated but related concepts
(e.g., homohysteria, "fag discourse," courtesy stigma, and
different types of heterosexism) can be brought together to
address the argument that measures of heterosexism should
be more exhaustive (e.g., Adolfsen etal., 2010; Worthington
etal., 2005). Focusing on the acceptance of homosexuality
rather than on the problem of heterosexism also provides
valuable information, which we will review below.
While none of the 24 items were endorsed by all of the
participants, there was a tendency for participants to endorse
multiple items. The most direct evidence of this trend is that
the participants tended to have scores on the upper end of the
distribution of the count variable. These findings indicate that
the participants generally endorsed relatively broad descrip-
tions of the acceptance of homosexuality. It would appear that
the descriptions of acceptance are just as multifaceted as other
attitudes regarding homosexuality, and future research should
be aware of and expand upon this finding.
The responses to the 24 items also indicate the potential
importance of items that were not included in the literature.
The most notable examples are the items regarding hetero-
sexuals viewing homosexuality as just another type of attrac-
tion and believing that only attraction differentiates gay men
and lesbians from heterosexuals. Both of these items were
endorsed by at least two thirds of the participants, though
they were not included in previous studies. Given their prev-
alence, future research should arguably incorporate these
measures, as well as determine whether people describe the
acceptance of homosexuality in other ways that have not
been presented in the literature.
Another contribution provided by the responses to the 24
items is that the participants were more likely to endorse
some items than others. More specifically, the items with the
highest level of support (70% or more of the participants
selecting any of the three agree categories) addressed full
legal equality for gay men and lesbians, heterosexuals not
hating gay men and lesbians, and heterosexuals believing
that only sexual attraction differentiated gay men and lesbi-
ans from heterosexuals. In contrast, the items regarding het-
erosexuals not using "fag" at all, not being upset if someone
thought they were gay or lesbian or if someone of the same
sex flirted with them, wanting to have at least one gay or
lesbian friend, and knowing about "gay history" had the low-
est levels of endorsement, with less than 50% of the partici-
pants selecting any of the three agree categories for these
items. The majority of the items were between these two
extremes.
One possible explanation for the different levels of
endorsement is that the participants were more likely to
endorse statements that were more commonly presented in
the public discourse regarding homosexuality. After all, this
discourse has arguably focused more on legal equality, par-
ticularly in terms of marriage, than on having gay and lesbian
friends or teaching "gay history" (e.g., Brewer, 2008;
Mucciaroni, 2008). Future research could directly measure
people's exposure to the various discourses regarding homo-
sexuality and assess the impact of this exposure on people's
views of homosexuality, including their descriptions of
acceptance.
A related explanation would be that participants' beliefs
regarding homosexuality affected their endorsement of spe-
cific items. For instance, the lower percentages for the items
regarding the use of words like "fag" can be connected to the
participants' disagreement regarding the meaning of "fag."
In addition to the questions discussed in the "Measures" sec-
tion, the participants were asked to what extent they agreed
that "fag" referred to a person being gay or lesbian. About
60% of the participants disagreed with this statement. Having
a majority of the participants disagree that "fag" was con-
nected to sexuality could explain why relatively smaller per-
centages of participants endorsed the "fag discourse" items.
In addition, the analyses with the Positive Stereotypic sub-
scale of the MHI indicated that participants who held more
positive or neutral stereotypes of gay men or lesbians were
less likely to endorse the items regarding the elimination of
positive or neutral stereotypes. Future research could further
test these connections, as well as seek out other possible
explanations for the variation in the participants' levels of
endorsement.
The results of the analyses with the other MHI subscales
similarly indicated that participants' beliefs about heterosex-
ism affected how many of the acceptance items they
endorsed. The participants who agreed with the statements in
the Aversive or Amnestic subscales essentially did not
believe that gay men and lesbians experienced discrimina-
tion and prejudice, and these same participants tended to
endorse a lower number of the acceptance items than the par-
ticipants who disagreed with the items in the Aversive and
Amnestic subscales. These findings imply a connection
between people's views of gay men and lesbians' experi-
ences and the breadth of their description of the acceptance
of homosexuality. Future research can further explore this, as
well as address an unanticipated finding. The participants
who agreed with the items on the Paternalistic subscale also
tended to endorse fewer acceptance items, though this cor-
relation was not significant. Because the items on this sub-
scale imply that gay men and lesbians face discrimination,
we expected the opposite relationship.
The results of the analyses with the demographic variables
provided indirect support for the possible impact of beliefs and
discourses, in that the participants with more experience with
or exposure to gay men and lesbians endorsed more of the
Tollini and Herbstrith 9
items. More specifically, the nonheterosexual participants had
a significantly higher average than the heterosexual partici-
pants, and the averages also increased with the number of gay
men and lesbians the participants knew. Although members of
the university's LGBTQA student organization also had a
higher mean score than nonmembers, indicating that organiza-
tional membership may also affect participants'descriptions of
acceptance, this difference was not significant. Future research
can further explore the apparent impact of sexual orientation
and interaction with gay men and lesbians, both to determine
why only these items and not organizational membership
affected participants' endorsement and whether participants
with different nonheterosexual identities and levels of experi-
ence are more likely to endorse certain items. The analyses
comparing the nonheterosexual and heterosexual participants
did not reveal specific items that nonheterosexuals were more
likely to endorse than heterosexuals, as nonheterosexuals were
more likely to endorse every item, and the data did not allow
for similar comparisons for members and nonmembers or for
people who did and did not know gay men and lesbians.
Additional research is certainly needed as this study was
preliminary and essentially the first one that directly addressed
this topic. At the very least, additional research is needed to
determine whether the results of the various analyses can be
replicated with other samples, including people who are not
college students and samples with higher response rates.
Comparative analyses of the subsamples, which are available
upon request, indicated that the participants from the psychol-
ogy pool were generally less likely to endorse the items than
the other participants. Because the subsamples in this study
had significantly different responses, replication would
appear to be particularly important, as it would indicate how
common the responses presented above are.
Future research is also needed to further test the items.
The fact that all of the participants did not select one of the
agree categories for any of the items, particularly the one
addressing legal equality, appears counterintuitive, as we
would assume that essentially everyone would endorse legal
equality as a part of their descriptions of acceptance. This
concern has been allayed by the results of a small, separate
interview project we conducted, in which the seven partici-
pants did not mention the same topics. Even so, it would be
beneficial to have corroborating data from other samples.
Future research could also alter the wording of the accep-
tance items so they are consistently in the same tense and, in
so doing, explore the possible impact of the mismatching
tenses in the questions used in the current study.
