Introduction
The renin­angiotensin system (RAS) bioenzymic cascade is
a key regulator of cardiovascular homeostasis, through its
main effector peptide, angiotensin II (ANG II). By activating
type 1 receptors (AT1Rs) on vascular smooth muscle cells,
ANG II elicits vasoconstriction, leading to an increase in
arterial pressure,1­4 and also, through activation of AT1Rs at
sympathetic nerve terminals, exerts facilitatory effects on
neural transmission.5,6 In contrast, type 2 receptors (AT2Rs)
appear to modulate renal afferent arteriolar resistance as well
as intra-renal production of bradykinin and nitric oxide7 and
oppose the aforementioned vasoconstrictor effects ofANG II
on AT1Rs when the RAS is activated in adult animals.8,9
Interestingly, during the perinatal period, the RAS is also
activated. For example, there are increased plasma levels of
renin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), and ANG II at
birth and a decline as postnatal maturation proceeds.10­17 The
expression ofAT1Rs andAT2Rs is also developmentally reg-
ulated, with AT2Rs predominating in the brain, adrenal gland
and kidney of fetal and newborn rats, fowl, rabbits, sheep and
humans.18­31 In near-term fetal sheep and newborn lambs,
AT2Rs are primarily expressed in systemic artery vascular
smooth muscle cells.32 After 2 weeks of postnatal life, there
is a transition from AT2Rs to AT1Rs that is complete by 3
months of age in sheep, when AT1Rs are the predominant
receptor expressed in the systemic vasculature.25,32 The
physiological significance of this preponderance of AT2Rs
in major blood vessels during the perinatal period is not
known, as reviewed recently by us.33
Do Angiotensin Type 2 Receptors
Modulate Haemodynamic
Effects of Type 1 Receptors
in Conscious Newborn Lambs?
Angela E Vinturache and Francine G Smith
Abstract
Introduction and hypothesis: It was hypothesized that in the immediate newborn period, when the renin­angiotensin
system (RAS) is activated, angiotensin type 2 receptors (AT2Rs) buffer the haemodynamic effects of angiotensin type 1
receptors (AT1Rs), as occurs in adult animals when the RAS is activated.
Materials and methods: Arterial (systolic, diastolic, and mean) pressures (SAP, DAP, MAP), mean venous pressures
(MVP) and renal blood flows (RBF) were measured in conscious, chronically instrumented lambs aged ~1 (8±2 days,
N=8) and 6 weeks (41±4 days, N=11). In each animal, measurements were made before and after administration of the
selective AT1R antagonist ZD 7155 (experiment one) and the selective AT2R antagonist PD123319 (experiment two)
as well as both antagonists, ZD 7155 and PD 123319 (experiment three).
Results: Haemodynamic responses to combined inhibition of both AT1Rs and AT2Rs were similar to inhibition of
AT1Rs alone: there was a significant decrease in SAP, DAP, and MAP and a significant increase in RBF within minutes of
concomitant administration of ZD 7155 and PD 123319 in both age groups. These responses were similar to responses
to ZD 7155 alone, whereas PD 123319 alone did not alter any of the measured variables.
Conclusions: AT2Rs do not counterbalance the pressor and renal vasoconstrictor effects elicited by activation of
AT1Rs in the immediate newborn period. During this time, AT1Rs appear to predominate in eliciting the haemodynamic
effects of angiotensin II (ANG II), whereas the role of the upregulated AT2Rs remains elusive.

Previously, we explored the effects of endogenously
produced ANG II on systemic and renal hemodynamics in
conscious, developing lambs, as well as the individual
receptor subtype through which ANG II exerts these
effects.34­36 Our results showed that acute bolus administra-
tion of ANG II to conscious lambs was associated with an
age- and dose-dependent increase in mean arterial pressure
and decrease in renal blood flow. These responses to ANG
II were mediated exclusively by activation of AT1Rs in
conscious newborn lambs under physiological conditions,
whereas AT2Rs did not alter these effects. From these
observations, we postulated that, in the newborn period
when the RAS is normally activated, AT2Rs may buffer the
haemodynamic effects ofAT1Rs, as they do later in life.37,38
The present experiments were, therefore, carried out to
investigate the potential role of AT2Rs in modulating the
responses to AT1R activation in conscious lambs, by
exploring the haemodynamic effects of combined inhibi-
tion of both ATRs. To this end, haemodynamic effects of an
AT1R antagonist alone, an AT2R antagonist alone, and
antagonists to both AT1R and AT2R combined were meas-
ured in conscious lambs aged ~1 week ­ when circulating
levels of ANG II are increased and AT2Rs predominate in
the conduit arteries ­ and ~6 weeks ­ when circulating
ANG II levels as well as AT2R expression are decreased.
Methods
Experiments were carried out in two separate age groups of
conscious chronically instrumented lambs aged ~1 and ~6
weeks at the time of experiments (Table 1). Animals were
obtained from a local source (Woolfit Acres, Olds, Alberta,
Canada) and housed with their mothers in individual pens
in the vivarium of the Health Sciences Centre of the
University of Calgary, where they were provided with
standard food and water, except during surgery, training,
and experiments. All surgical and experimental procedures
described herein were carried out in accordance with the
Guide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals pro-
vided by the Canadian Council on Animal Care and with
the approval of the Animal Care Committee of the
University of Calgary.
Surgical procedures: Surgery was carried out using
aseptic techniques as previously described.39,40 Briefly,
anaesthesia was induced with a mask and isoflurane (~5%)
in oxygen, the trachea was intubated, and then anaesthesia
was maintained by ventilating the lungs with isoflurane
(1.5­2.5% in a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen (3:2)).
Under sterile conditions, catheters (Tygon® Microbore
Tubing 0.04 ID­0.07 OD, arterial catheter and 0.05 ID­
0.09 OD, venous catheter) were inserted into femoral ves-
sels bilaterally and advanced to the aorta and inferior vena
cava, respectively, for later pressure measurements, as well
as I.V. injections of drugs and solutions. Catheters were
tunnelled subcutaneously to exit the lamb on the right and
left flank, respectively. The right kidney was then
approached retroperitoneally, and a pre-calibrated ultra-
sonic flow transducer (size 3S­6S, Transonic Systems Inc.,
Ithaca, New York, USA) was placed around the renal artery
for later measurement of renal blood flow (RBF) as previ-
ously described.41 After closure of incisions, catheters and
the flow transducer cable were contained in pouches on a
lamb body jacket (Lomir Inc., Montréal, QC, Canada) for
safe storage between experiments.
Lambs were allowed to recover from the effects of sur-
gery and anaesthesia in a small animal critical care unit
(Shor-line, Kansas City, KS, USA) for ~30 to 60 min, after
which time they were returned to the vivarium, where they
were housed with their mothers until the time of the experi-
ment at least 4 days later.Antibiotics (Excenel® (Ceftriofur)
2.2 mg/kg (Pfizer, Kirkland, QC, Canada)) were adminis-
tered intramuscularly at 24 h intervals beginning the day
before surgery for a total period of 4 days. During the
recovery after surgery, animals were trained daily for ~1h
to allow them to accommodate to the supportive sling in
which they were housed during experiments. This training
period ensured that animals were resting quietly and accus-
tomed to their surroundings during experiments in the labo-
ratory environment.
Experimental details: On the day of the experiment,
the animals were placed in the supportive sling in the labo-
ratory environment for at least 60 min. During this time, an
intravenous (I.V.) infusion of 5% dextrose in 0.9% sodium
chloride at a rate of 4.17 ml·kg-1·h-1 through the right fem-
oral venous catheter was initiated and continued for the
duration of the experiment to assist in maintaining fluid
and electrolyte balance. The left femoral catheters were
connected to pressure transducers (Model P23XL, Statham,
West Warwick, RI, USA) to continuously measure arterial

and venous pressures. The flow transducer cable was
connected to a flowmeter (T101, Transonics Systems) to
continuously measure RBF in real-time using ultrasound
technology. These haemodynamic variables were recorded
onto a polygraph (Model 7, Grass Instruments Inc., West
Warwick, RI, USA) and simultaneously digitized at 200
Hz using the data acquisition and analysis software pack-
age, PolyVIEWTM (AstroMed Inc., USA).
At the end of each experiment, lambs were returned to
the vivarium, where they were housed with the ewe until
the next experimental day. After all experiments, animals
were administered a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbi-
tone. Following postmortem inspection for verifying
catheters and flow transducer placement, the zero offset
of the flow transducer was recorded for RBF measure-
ment correction. The kidneys were removed, examined
grossly and weighed to normalize renal haemodynamic
measurements.
Experimental protocol: Experiments were carried out
in each animal in random order and at minimum intervals
of 48 h in order to ensure adequate time for drug clearance
between experiments.34 Each experiment consisted of con-
tinuous haemodynamic measurements for 30 min before
(Control) and 60 min after I.V. administration of antago-
nists selective to the AT1R, ZD 7155, and the AT2R, PD
123319. Two additional experiments consisting of continu-
ous haemodynamic measurements for 30 min before
(Control) and 60 min after I.V. administration of either ZD
7155 or PD 123319 alone were also performed in each ani-
mal. The three experiments were carried out in random
order and at minimum intervals of 48 h. ZD 7155 was
administered as an I.V. infusion of 70 µg·kg-1·h-1 following
an I.V. bolus of 100 µg·kg-1; PD 123319 was administered
as a bolus of 100 µg·kg-1, followed by an infusion of 70
µg·kg-1·h-1,36 using a microprocessor-controlled syringe
pump (Mi 60-1B, World Precision Instruments Inc.,
Sarasota, FL, USA) at a rate of 4.17 ml·kg-1·h-1. Dose-
response experiments for ZD 7155 as well as PD 123319
were previously conducted over the range of doses 0 to
1600 µg/kg for ZD 7155 and 0 to 400 µg/kg for PD 123319.
In these previous experiments, measured cardiovascular
variables were examined for 120 min after inhibition of
ATRs. Before and at 5, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after admin-
istration of either ZD 7155 or PD 123319, ANG II was
administered (EC50
selected from previous ANG II dose:
mean arterial pressure (MAP) response study), to test the
magnitude and duration of any effects of ZD 7155 and PD
123319 on the pressor response to ANG II. For each ANG
II test, measurements were made for 10 sec before and 30
sec after I.V. injection of ANG II infused over 10 sec using
the same microprocessor controlled syringe pump. The
doses used in these experiments were therefore carefully
selected from these previous dose­response experiments,
allowing us to be certain that ATRs were inhibited by the
administered compounds.
Drugs: Both ZD 7155 (5,7-Diethyl-3,4-dihydro-1-[[2'-
(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl]methyl]-
1,6-napthyridin-2(1H)-one hydrochloride) and PD 123319
(1-[[4-(Dimethylamino)-3-methylphenyl]methyl]-
5-(diphenylacetyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]
pyridine-6-carboxylic acid ditrifluoroacetate) were manu-
factured by Tocris Cooksons Ltd (Bristol, UK). On the
morning of each experiment, ZD 7155 and PD 123319 were
weighed and immediately dissolved in a sterile solution of
0.9% sodium chloride.
Data analyses: Haemodynamic measurements of sys-
tolic (SAP), diastolic (DAP) and mean arterial pressure
(MAP), mean venous pressure (MVP) and RBF were ana-
lysed over consecutive 1 min intervals using the analyses
component of PolyVIEWTM. Heart rate (HR) was calcu-
lated from the systolic peak of the arterial pressure wave-
form using PolyVIEWTM. RBF measured in the two age
groups was normalized per gram of kidney weight. Renal
vascular resistance (RVR) was calculated as (MAP-MVP)/
RBF. All haemodynamic data were averaged over consecu-
tive 10 min intervals before and after treatment and pre-
sented as such.
There was no significant sex difference in systemic and
renal haemodynamic responses to the ATR antagonists that
were used to test our research hypothesis. These findings
confirm previous studies conducted in our laboratory that
show no gender related differences in cardiovascular or
renal function in young lambs. Because there were no
effects of sex on any of the measured variables, data from
both male and female lambs were combined.
Sample size (N=8) was determined by applying a power
calculation and based upon our previous experimental find-
ings, with a projected difference of ~20% between means,
using a power of 0.8 and =0.05. In the older age group, the
sample size was adjusted to N=11, due to the technical limi-
tations that influenced the success rate for direct RBF
measurements (i.e. transducer malfunctions).
The normal distribution of the data was evaluated with the
Kolmogorov­Smirnov test. Non-paired Student's t-tests
were used to compare group differences for demographic
and baseline variables. Effects on the measured and calcu-
lated variables were evaluated using statistical software
(Sigmastat, Version 3.5, Systat Software Inc., San Jose,
California) and applying three-way analysis of variance, fac-
tors being time, age and treatment. Where the F value was
significant, Holm­Sidak multiple comparison procedures
were applied to determine where the significant differences
occurred, using a 90% confidence interval. Data presented in
the text, tables and figures are expressed as mean±SD.
Results
Baseline HR and RVR were higher in 1-week-old as com-
pared with 6-week-old lambs (Table 1) whereas MVP,
MAP, and RBF were lower.
Vinturache and Smith 453
For MAP, there was an overall effect of age (F=133.8,
p<0.001), and treatment (F=20.84, p<0.001), which was
reflected in an altered baseline but no interaction between
age and treatment (p=0.26). MAP decreased within 10 min
of administration of ZD 7155 and remained decreased for
the entire 60 min period of infusion. This response was the
same with concomitant administration of both ZD 7155 and
PD 123319, whereas MAP remained constant after PD
123319 alone in both age groups. The decrease in MAP
after ZD 7155 and after ZD 7155 + PD 123319 resulted
from a predominant decrease in SAP (Figure 1 left), as well
as a decrease in DAP (Figure 1 right) in both age groups.
When data were also tested as change from control to
remove any effects of the altered baseline, there was also no
interaction, whereas the treatment effect remained.
For RBF, there was an overall effect of age (F=241.4;
p<0.001) and of treatment (F=2.3; p=0.067) but no interac-
tion between age and treatment (p=0.20). As illustrated in
Figure 2(left), RBF increased within 10 min of administra-
tion of ZD 7155 alone in both age groups, whereas there
were no effects after PD 123319 alone. The RBF response
to ZD 7155 was not altered by combined treatment with PD
123319. When data were also tested as change from control
to remove any effects of the altered baseline, there was also
no interaction, whereas the treatment effect remained. The
RVR response to ZD 7155 mirrored that of RBF: there was
an overall effect of age (F=229.1, p<0.001) and treatment
(F=12.2, p<0.001) but no interaction between age and
treatment (p=0.65). As illustrated in Figure 2(right), RVR
decreased soon after administration of ZD 7155 alone,
whereas there were no effects after PD 123319 alone in
either age group.
There were no significant effects of any ATR antago-
nists alone or combined on MVP in either age group. There
were also no significant effects on HR of ZD 7155 alone,
PD 123319 alone, or combined treatment with ZD 7155 +
PD 123319, at 1 or 6 weeks of age in conscious lambs.
Discussion
The present study was designed to investigate the role of
AT2Rs in buffering the haemodynamic effects of AT1Rs in
the newborn period. To this end, parameters of systemic
and renal haemodynamics were measured in conscious

lambs aged ~1 and ~6 weeks, before and after combined
inhibition of both AT1Rs and AT2Rs. Novel findings of this
study are that in both age groups: (a) the decrease in arterial
pressure which occurs following inhibition of AT1Rs was
not altered by concomitant inhibition of AT2Rs; (b) the
decrease in RVR and increase in RBF which occur after
inhibition of AT1Rs were also not altered by concomitant
inhibition of AT2Rs; (c) there were no effects of combined
treatment with ZD 7155 and PD 123319 on HR or MVP.
Together, these data show that, under physiological condi-
tions, AT2Rs, which are highly expressed in systemic blood
vessels early in life, do not appear to modulate the haemo-
dynamic effects of AT1Rs postnatally. Therefore, we con-
clude that there is no interaction betweenAT1Rs andAT2Rs
in modulating systemic and renal haemodynamics in the
newborn period under physiological conditions.
Velaphi et al. (2002)42 showed in conscious young sheep
that systemic ANG II infusion elicits a dose-dependent
increase in arterial pressure, but, when administered locally
into the hind limb, it does not elicit a vasoconstrictor
response until 2 weeks after birth, which supports earlier
findings of a preponderance of AT2Rs in major arteries in
newborn lambs. Chappellaz and Smith (2005) also meas-
ured the pressor and renal vasoconstrictor responses to
exogenous ANG II in conscious lambs.34 Administration of
ANG II was associated with a dose-dependent increase in
MAP to the EC100
of 100 ng·kg-1 in lambs aged both 1 and
6 weeks, and a dose-dependent decrease in RBF to the
EC100
of 50 ng·kg-1 in 1-week-old lambs and 25 ng·kg-1 in
lambs aged 6 weeks. Administration of ZD 7155, but not
PD 123319 or vehicle, abolished the MAP and RBF
responses to ANG II in both age groups of lambs.35 These
data provided information that pressor and renal vasocon-
strictor effects of ANG II during the first 6 weeks of post-
natal life in lambs are elicited by activation of AT1Rs but
not AT2Rs. More recently, Wehlage and Smith (2012) con-
firmed the important role of AT1Rs in influencing cardio-
vascular homeostasis as well as the arterial baroreflex
control of heart rate early in life.36
Under certain conditions in adult animals and humans,
ANG II counterbalances its own vasoconstrictor effects of
AT1R activation through vasorelaxation mediated by acti-
vation of AT2Rs. These effects of AT2Rs are, however,
revealed only when (a) the RAS is activated (i.e. by a low

salt diet or haemorrhage), (b) arterial pressure is elevated,
and (c) AT1Rs are pharmacologically inhibited.9,37,38,43
Experiments carried out in adult rats in the renovascular
hypertension model as well as under conditions of salt
depletion have provided evidence that AT2Rs are involved
in blood pressure regulation through crosstalk with AT1Rs,
mediating a vasodilation that counterbalances the vasocon-
strictor effects of AT1R through activation of the brady-
kinin­nitric oxide­cGMP pathway.44,45 Under these
experimental conditions, arterial pressure was considerably
elevated above resting levels. Therefore, the responses we
observed in conscious newborn lambs in the present study
could result from the fact that resting arterial pressure was
not elevated, although the aforementioned conditions (a)
and (c) were met. It is, therefore, possible that the known
crosstalk betweenAT1Rs andAT2Rs is only elicited in con-
ditions of a prevailing increase in arterial pressure. This
premise warrants further investigation.
Recent experiments in adult rodents and humans have
also revealed that the haemodynamic roles for AT2Rs may
be species specific: in cultured cells and isolated vessels,
as well as in vivo experiments in mice and rats, AT2Rs
have been implicated in counteracting the effects of
AT1Rs.38 In pregnant C57BL/6J mice, the contractile
response of isolated umbilical arteries to ANG II is
increased in the presence of the AT2R inhibitor, PD
123319,46 thus supporting a vasodilatory role for AT2Rs.
In contrast, recent studies in isolated umbilical arteries
removed from pregnant and non-pregnant women showed
that ANG II induced vascular contractions were not altered
in the presence of AT2R inhibition.47 This may implicate
species differences in the role of AT2Rs in modulating
haemodynamic effects of AT1Rs.
The protective AT2R-mediated renal vasodilation48,49
appears to occur by the renal production of bradykinin, nitric
oxide and cGMP as well as prostaglandins.50 Our hypothesis
regarding a potential regulatory role for AT2Rs in the new-
born period was based upon such an assumption, that there
would also be a developmentally regulated crosstalk between
the AT1Rs and AT2Rs in mediating renal haemodynamic
effects of ANG II. This is supported by a developmentally
regulated intra-renal expression and distribution of ATRs in
various species.27,51 The temporal and spatial profile of ATR
expression in the ovine kidney microvasculature during post-
natal development has not yet been characterized. It is con-
ceivable, however, thatATR expression, signalling pathways
and/or modulatory effects of other vasoactive peptides may
also be developmentally regulated.
The results of the present study are intriguing, since
AT2Rs appear to predominate in the systemic vasculature
of developing lambs.25,32 AT2Rs are the primary subtype
expressed in the systemic vasculature near term and during
the first 2 weeks of postnatal life in sheep, after which there
is a near complete transition from AT2Rs to AT1Rs by 3
months postnatally. Based upon these observations, we
would expect there to be a preponderance of AT2R activity
in the systemic vasculature in the 1-week-old lambs in the
present study, whereas in older lambs we would expect the
transition toAT1Rs to be in place. The physiological impact
of increased ANG II levels during the perinatal period, as
well as the preponderance of AT2Rs in the vasculature
early in life, is not yet known.
AT2Rs may function as a backup mechanism in regulat-
ing high blood pressure in the newborn period, whereas
AT1Rs predominate in regulating both cardiovascular
homeostasis and the arterial baroreflex.34­36 AT2Rs may
also be predominantly involved in growth processes at cel-
lular and subcellular level at this age, while a haemody-
namic component of their function may develop later in
life. While this assumption is interesting, more studies are
required to elucidate the perhaps more complex physiologi-
cal roles for AT2Rs in the newborn period. The current
findings may impact therapeutic choices in human infants
with high prevailing blood pressure, as well as contribute a
new perspective to explaining the developmental origins of
chronic adult disease.
