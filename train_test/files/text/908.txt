Abstract Starting out from the relationship between income equality and
indicators of social cohesion and social trust, this paper explores
the social processes which might account for the relationship
between greater income equality and lower population mortality
rates. We note that: homicide shows an even closer relationship
to income inequality than does mortality from all other causes
combined; there are several reports that homicide rates are
particularly closely related to all cause mortality; and that there
is a growing body of research on crime in relation to social
disorganisation.
We use US state level data to examine the relationships
between various categories of income inequality, median state
income, social trust and mortality. The data suggest that violent
crime, but not property crime, is closely related to income
inequality, social trust and mortality rates, excluding homicide.
The second half of the paper is devoted to literature on the
antecedents of violence. Feeling shamed, humiliated and disre-
spected seem to be central to the picture and are plausibly
related to the way in which wider income differences are likely to
mean more people are denied access to traditional sources of
status and respect. We suggest that these aspects of low social
status may be central to the psychosocial processes linking
inequality, violence, social cohesion and mortality.

Introduction
This paper uses data on homicide and other categories of crime to explore
the nature of the associations between income distribution, mortality and a
measure of social cohesion in the United States.
Close associations between income distribution and population mortality
rates have now been reported on independent data at least fifteen times
(Wilkinson 1996). In different papers the relationship has been shown to
withstand controlling for average incomes, expenditure on medical care,
poverty, smoking and race (Kennedy et al. 1996, Kaplan et al. 1996). It has
been reported among developed and developing countries and among
administrative areas within developed countries (Ben Shlomo et al. 1996).
Most analyses have used cross-sectional data but the relationship has also
been demonstrated using data on changes over time (e.g. Wilkinson 1992;
Kaplan et al. 1996).
When it was believed that the main determinants of health were likely to
involve the direct physiological effects of exposure to features of the mater-
ial environment and to health related behaviour, it was harder to imagine
how social relationships of inequality could be strongly associated with
mortality. However, the growing body of epidemiological findings suggest-
ing the importance of features of psychosocial life, such as sense of control,
social affiliations and support, self-esteem, `life events' and job security, is
now coupled with a clearer understanding of the physiological pathways
through which chronic psychosocial stress can have a wide range of health
outcomes (Chrousos et al. 1995). There is also impressive evidence of the
health-related physiological consequences of low social status from studies
of non-human primates (Sapolsky 1993, Shively et al. 1994, Shively et al.
1997).
The difficulty is now more a matter of identifying which are the more
important of a wide range of social processes that could plausibly con-
tribute to a relationship between mortality and inequality. Particularly
interesting is the question of whether people's health is only affected by
income inequality through the impact of their individual relative income on
their own health (i.e. through things like low self-esteem consequent on low
social status, worry over debt, financial insecurity etc.), or whether there are
more broadly based social processes which may lead to improvements in
health more widely among people living in more egalitarian societies ­ at
least partly independently of their own relative income. On this latter possi-
bility, Kawachi et al. (1997) have shown statistical evidence suggesting that
the relationship between income inequality and mortality among the states
of the USA is mediated by `social trust' ­ as measured by the proportion of
people in each state agreeing with the statement `most people would try to
take advantage of you if they got the chance'. Similarly, Wilkinson (1996)
discussed a number of examples of societies which were both unusually

egalitarian and unusually healthy. They all showed a marked tendency to
be more socially cohesive. However, not only is it unclear what aspects of
social cohesion might be important to health, but it would be possible to
argue that rather than income inequality affecting health through social
cohesion, the psychosocial effects of low relative income could rebound
directly on both health and social cohesion without the latter being a path-
way to the former.
In passing, we should mention that it has been suggested (Fiscella and
Franks 1997) that the association between income inequality and mortality
may reflect a greater incidence of absolute poverty and lower absolute levels
of consumption among the less well off in areas of greater inequality. In
other words, it has been argued that the relationship of income inequality
to mortality simply reflects a compositional effect of more poor people
(who are presumably at higher risk of death) residing in areas of high
income disparity. We reject this explanation because it has been shown
that, of the two variables income distribution and the percentage of house-
holds in each state living below the federal poverty threshold, income distri-
bution but not poverty is independently related to mortality. In addition,
when the weak relationship between mortality and median state income is
controlled for income distribution, rather than the association being
strengthened, it disappears altogether and mortality shows no independent
relation to median income whatsoever (Kaplan et al. 1996, Kennedy et al.
1996).
Homicide
One of the intriguing aspects of the relationship between inequality and
mortality is that it seems to be mirrored by a relationship between income
distribution and homicide. Kaplan et al. (1996) reported close correlations
between income inequality and both homicide (r = 0.74) and violent crime
rates (r = 0.70) among the 50 states of the United States. Kennedy et al.
(1996) examined the cross-sectional relationship between household income
distribution and state-level variations in homicide rates. The greater the dis-
parity in household incomes, the higher was the homicide rate at the state
level. Relative deprivation was apparently an even stronger predictor of
homicide rates than absolute deprivation. Homicide showed correlations
with income inequality and household poverty rates of 0.74 and 0.53,
respectively. Even after adjusting for poverty, income inequality accounted
for 52 per cent of the between-state variance in homicide rates. An associa-
tion between homicide and income inequality has also been found using
international data (Messner 1983, Krahn et al. 1986). In addition, Wilson
and Daly (1997) reported a correlation of 0.88 between homicide and all
other causes of death (excluding homicide) among 77 `community areas' in
the Chicago region. The link was confirmed in a meta-analysis of some 34
studies (Hseih and Pugh 1993).

Social disorganisation
There is a substantial body of research which suggests that crime rates
reflect `community social disorganisation'. Social disorganisation theory
was originally developed by the Chicago School researchers Clifford Shaw
and Henry McKay in their classic work, Juvenile Delinquency and Urban
Areas (1942). Shaw and McKay demonstrated that the same socioeconomi-
cally disadvantaged areas in 21 US cities continued to exhibit high delin-
quency rates over a span of several decades, despite changes in their racial
and ethnic composition, indicating the persistent contextual effects of these
communities on crime rates, regardless of what populations experienced
them. This observation led them to reject individualistic explanations of
delinquency and to focus instead on community processes ­ like disruption
of local community organisation and weak social controls ­ which led to
the apparent trans-generational transmission of criminal behaviour. In gen-
eral, social disorganisation is defined as the `inability of a community struc-
ture to realise the common values of its residents and maintain effective
social controls' (Sampson and Groves 1989). The social organisational
approach views local communities and neighbourhoods as complex systems
of friendship, kinship, and acquaintanceship networks, as well as formal
and informal associational ties rooted in family life and ongoing socialisa-
tion processes (Sampson 1995). From the perspective of crime control, a
major dimension of social disorganisation is the ability of a community to
supervise and control teenage peer groups, especially gangs. Thus Shaw and
McKay (1942) argued that residents of cohesive communities were better
able to control the youth behaviours that set the context for gang violence.
Examples of such controls include: `the supervision of leisure-time youth
activities, intervention in street-corner congregation, and challenging youth
"who seem to be up to no good". Socially disorganised communities with
extensive street-corner peer groups are also expected to have higher rates of
adult violence, especially among younger adults who still have ties to youth
gangs' (Sampson 1995).
Recently, social disorganisation theory has been linked to the emerging
concept of social capital (Sampson 1995). Social capital has been defined by
its principal theorists (Coleman 1990, Putnam 1993) as those features of
social organisation, such as networks, norms of reciprocity, and trust in
others, that facilitate cooperation between citizens for mutual benefit. Lack
of social capital is thus one of the primary features of socially disorganised
communities (Sampson 1995). Although the conceptualisation and mea-
surement of social capital are still evolving, two critical features of the con-
cept appear to be the level of trust among citizens and the density and rate
of participation in voluntary associations and local organisations (Putnam
1995).
Several empirical studies, reviewed by Sampson (1995), have corrobo-
rated the link between low stocks of social capital and high crime rates.

Taylor and colleagues (1984) examined violent crimes (such as mugging,
assault, murder, rape) across 63 street blocks in Baltimore. Based on inter-
views with 687 household respondents, Taylor et al. constructed block-level
measures of the proportion of respondents who belonged to an organisa-
tion to which co-residents also belonged, and the proportion of respondents
who felt responsible for what happened in the area surrounding their home.
Both variables were significantly and negatively associated with rates of
violence. Similarly, Sincha-Fagan and Schwartz (1986) collected survey
information on 553 residents of 12 neighbourhoods in New York City, and
found a significant negative relationship between the rate of self-reported
delinquency and rates of organisational participation by local residents. A
third set of studies conducted by Sampson and Groves (1989) in Great
Britain reported that density of local friendship networks had a significant
negative effect on robbery rates, while the level of organisational participa-
tion by residents had significant inverse effects on both robbery and
stranger violence. Not only does participation in local organisations
increase the level of community control, it may facilitate the capacity of
communities to obtain extra-local resources ­ such as police and fire
services, as well as block grants ­ that have indirect consequences for crime
control (Burski and Grasmick 1993). In the most convincing demonstration
to date of the link between social cohesion and crime, Sampson and col-
leagues (1997) surveyed 8,782 residents of 343 Chicago neighbourhoods to
ask about their perceptions of social cohesion and trust in the neighbour-
hood. Respondents were asked how strongly they agreed (on a five point
scale) that `people around here are willing to help their neighbors', `this is a
close-knit neighborhood', `people in this neighborhood can be trusted',
`people in this neighborhood generally don't get along with each other', and
`people in this neighborhood do not share the same values' (the last two
items were reverse-coded). The resulting scale was then combined with
responses to questions about the level of informal social control (whether
neighbours would intervene in situations where children were engaging in
delinquent behaviour) to produce a summary index of `collective efficacy'.
Collective efficacy turned out to be significantly (P < 0.01) related to organ-
izational participation (r = 0.45) and neighbourhood services (r = 0.21). In
hierarchical statistical models adjusting for individual characteristics (age,
socioeconomic status, gender, ethnicity, marital status, home ownership,
and years in neighbourhood), the index of collective efficacy was signifi-
cantly inversely associated with reports of neighbourhood violence, violent
victimisation, as well as homicide rates. For example, a two standard devia-
tion elevation in neighbourhood collective efficacy was associated with a
39.7% reduction in the expected homicide rate.
Given these reported links between crime and the nature of the local
social environment we decided to use rates of different kinds of crime to re-
examine the relationship between income inequality, social trust and mor-
tality which had been identified in previous work (Kawachi et al. 1997).

Using data for the states of the United States we decided to see whether
there were informative differences in the way different kinds of crime
fitted into these relationships. Our hope was that they would provide a
guide to the social processes which mediate between income distribution
and mortality.
Data sources
The social environment
A core feature of `social capital', as presented by its principal theorists
(Coleman 1990, Putnam 1993) consists of levels of interpersonal trust
among community members. Following Putnam (1995), we used data from
the General Social Surveys (GSS), conducted by the National Opinion
Research Center to estimate state variations in levels of interpersonal trust.
The GSS is a nationally representative survey of noninstitutionalised adults
over 18 years living in the United States. The surveys have been repeated 14
times over the last two decades, and have included a set of questions on
interpersonal trust. In the present study, we averaged five years of cumu-
lated data (1986­1990), representing 7,679 individual observations. Of the
50 states, only 39 were sampled in the survey due to the small population of
some states (e.g. Delaware, Rhode Island); hence, social capital data were
not available in these states. Because the sampling design of the GSS was
intended to be representative of regions rather than states, we adjusted indi-
vidual responses using post-stratification weights to reflect the age, race/eth-
nic, and educational composition of each state. Detailed procedures for the
post-stratification weighting are described elsewhere (Kawachi et al. 1997).
Our Social Trust variable was assessed from responses to the GSS item
that asked: `Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be
trusted, or that you can't be too careful in dealing with people?' For each
state, we calculated the percentage of residents who agreed that `most
people cannot be trusted'. Belief in the good will and benign intent of
others facilitates collective action and mutual cooperation, and therefore
adds to the stock of a community's social capital. In turn, collective action
further reinforces community norms of reciprocity.
Based on the well-established association between male youth and violent
crime rates, we also obtained Census-derived estimates of the proportion of
the population in each state who were males aged 15 to 24 years.
Income measures
Household income data for each state were obtained from the 1990 US
Census Summary Tape File STF 3A. The data provide annual household
income for 25 income intervals ($0­5,000 at the bottom, and $150,000 or
more at the top). To calculate income inequality, counts of the number of
households falling into each of the 25 income intervals were obtained for

each state. These interval data were converted into income deciles using a
programme developed by the US Census Bureau. Our measure of income
inequality, the Robin Hood Index (RHI), was estimated for each state from
the income decile distribution, which represents the share of total house-
hold income in each decile. The RHI is then calculated by summing the
excess shares of income for those deciles whose shares of the aggregate
income exceed 10 per cent (Atkinson and Micklewright 1992). For example
in Massachusetts, the RHI is 30.26 per cent. This represents the share of
total income from all households that would have to be transferred from
those above the mean to those below the mean in order to achieve a per-
fectly equal income distribution. The higher the value of RHI, the greater is
the degree of income inequality. We also obtained median gross household
income for each state.
Mortality and crime rates
Age-adjusted mortality from all-causes and homicide rates were obtained
for each state from the Compressed Mortality Files compiled by the
National Center for Health Statistics, Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC). We subtracted homicide from all-cause mortality to
provide two variables ­ homicide and all-causes mortality excluding homi-
cide ­ which were entirely separate from each other. Mortality (excluding
homicide) was taken for the year 1990, while data for years 1981­1991 were
combined to provide more stable estimates of homicide rates.
Incidence rates of other crimes ­ rape, robbery, aggravated assault, bur-
glary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft ­ were obtained from the Federal
Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) for the years
1991­1994 (US Department of Justice 1991­1994). These rates are based on
the incidents of crime reported to the police, and subsequently to the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) through the crime reporting pro-
gramme. Incidence data, while subject to various biases related to varia-
tions in reporting, are nonetheless considered less susceptible to bias
compared to arrest data (Reiss and Roth 1993). Table 1 shows a list of the
variables and their definitions. Homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated
assault are classified under the broad category of violent crimes, while bur-
glary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft are classified under property crimes.
Results and discussion
Table 2 shows the correlation matrix between all the variables. Data are
presented for the 39 states covered by the General Social Surveys. Strong
correlations with mortality in the expected direction are shown with income
inequality (r = 0.63), social trust (r = 0.76), and homicide (r = 0.70) (see
also Kawachi et al. 1997). Much weaker, though still statistically signifi-
cant, correlations were found with the proportion of males 15­24, median

income, and aggravated assault. Correlations between mortality and the
other crime variables failed to reach statistical significance: while robbery,
burglary and rape showed a weak direct association with mortality, motor
vehicle theft showed no association and larceny was inversely correlated
with mortality. It could be argued that the differences in the associations
between mortality and different categories of crime were simply a reflection
of differences in reporting, and that homicide shows a close association
because the data are much more accurate. Nevertheless, the statistically sig-
nificant direct correlations between higher median state income and higher
rates of robbery and motor vehicle theft might indicate that some forms of
property crime are influenced by the greater opportunities for theft which
more prosperous states would provide.
As well as being closely associated with mortality, income inequality is
significantly associated with homicide (r = 0.74), social trust (r = 0.73),
assault (r = 0.50), burglary (r = 0.44), and robbery (r = 0.36). Inequality's
correlations with rape and motor vehicle theft are weakly positive but there
is no relationship with larceny.
The fact that violent crime, particularly homicide and aggravated assault,
are more closely related both to mortality and to income inequality than are
property crimes, may tell us something of the nature of the relationship
between mortality and income inequality. If we assume that violent crime is
indicative of some aspect of the social fabric, how does this factor fit into
the relationship between mortality and both income inequality and social
trust?
Regressing mortality simultaneously on income inequality and homicide
shows that income inequality is not related to mortality independently of
homicide (p = 0.76), though homicide is strongly related to mortality inde-

pendently of income inequality (p = 0.0002). Regressing mortality against
homicide and social trust shows that social trust is related significantly to
mortality independently of homicide (p = 0.005), but the relationship
between mortality and homicide independent of social trust fails to reach
significance (p = 0.19).
What these results suggest is that the social conditions which produce
homicide are near the heart of the relationships we want to understand
between income distribution and mortality. The social conditions which
produce homicide are also very closely related to social trust (the simple
correlation between homicide and social trust is 0.82) but homicide does
not wholly account for the relationship between social trust and mortality.
Other forms of crime have either no relationship or a weaker relationship to
this pattern. It would appear that homicide and larceny (or motor vehicle
theft) ­ the most and least violent crimes ­ are at opposite extremes in how
they are related to income distribution and mortality, with assault, burglary
and robbery taking up intermediate positions. The associations with assault
are most like those with homicide, so adding to the impression that we are
dealing with a distinction between social conditions which lead to increased
violence and those which lead to increased property crime. Rape, as a vio-
lent crime which lacks strong associations with income distribution or
social trust, appears to be an exception to this pattern, but as rape statistics
are notoriously affected by differences in reporting, it may be unwise to
read much into this.
We are inclined to take the differences in the associational patterns of
violence and property crime seriously partly because they echo earlier find-
ings. In an analysis of data for 27 countries, Krohn (1976) found statisti-
cally significant relationship between higher homicide and greater income

inequality which remained after controlling for GNPpc. However, he found
the relationship with property crime was, if anything, the other way round.
A number of other pieces of research also reveal a sharp distinction
between violence and property crime. Field (1990) analyses fluctuations in
crime in Britain in relation to the business cycle and shows sharply differing
patterns: property crime is negatively related to changes in consumer's
expenditure per capita while violence is positively related. He suggests that
property crime is a result of relative deprivation, whereas violence occurs
more frequently when there are more people on the street and alcohol con-
sumption is higher. Hennigan et al. (1982) examined the effects of the intro-
duction of television in different parts of the United States in the 1950s and
'60s on the rates of violent crime, burglary, auto theft and larceny. They
found no effect on violence, burglary or auto theft, but a consistent associa-
tion between the spread of television and rises in larceny.
What then are the differences between the social conditions conducive to
homicide and those conducive to property crime, and what can the differ-
ence tell us about the way the social environment associated with greater
income inequality affects health? We conjecture that one of the salient
characteristics of social environments marked by wide income disparities is
that they generate invidious social comparisons, which in turn engender a
sense of exclusion and alienation among vulnerable individuals. Under such
conditions, violent behaviour may be seen as an expression of the quest for
respect from others. To shore up these arguments, we turn to evidence of a
different nature, viz. narrative histories of violent individuals describing
their quest for respect. In the section to follow, we move purposely from
community-level analysis (the inter-relationships among income inequality,
social cohesion, and mortality) toward an individual-level description of the
relationship between the psychological sense of exclusion and the expres-
sion of violent behaviour. The reason for making this macro-to-micro tran-
sition is to attempt to link the social environment (income inequality) to
individual health outcomes, via intervening psychological variables, includ-
ing the lack of self-esteem and the sense of not being respected.
Antecedents of violence
Few authorities can match James Gilligan's detailed personal knowledge of
men imprisoned for violence. He worked for 25 years as a psychiatrist in
American prisons talking daily to violent offenders (Gilligan 1996). As a
former director of the Centre for the Study of Violence at Harvard Medical
School, he regards his book, Violence, as a contribution to public health
and we shall quote from it extensively. Gilligan says:­
. . . the prison inmates I work with have told me repeatedly, when I asked
them why they had assaulted someone, that it was because `he disre-
spected me', or `he disrespected my visit' (meaning /visitor'). The word
`disrespect' is central in the vocabulary, moral value system, and psycho-

dynamics of these chronically violent men that they have abbreviated it
into the slang term, `he dis'ed me'. (1996: 106)
The challenge `Are you dis'in' me?' has now also become the standard way
young people on the streets of Britain threaten belligerence.
Gilligan continues:­
I have yet to see a serious act of violence that was not provoked by the
experience of feeling shamed and humiliated, disrespected and ridiculed,
and that did not represent the attempt to prevent or undo this `loss of
face' ­ no matter how severe the punishment, even if it includes death
(1996: 110)
Describing one prisoner, he says
a very angry and violent inmate in his thirties, in prison for armed
robbery, was referred to me because he had been yelling at, insulting,
threatening, and assaulting another inmate. He had been doing this kind
of thing for the past several weeks, and, off and on, for years . . . (and I
had little) success in persuading him to stop his endlessly self-defeating
power struggles with everyone around him, which inevitably resulted in
his being punished more severely.
In an attempt to break through that vicious cycle with this man, I
finally asked him `What do you want so badly that you would sacrifice
everything else in order to get it?' And he . . . replied with calm assurance,
with perfect coherence and even a kind of eloquence: `Pride. Dignity.
Self-esteem.' And then he went on to say, again more clearly than before:
`And I'll kill every mother-fucker in that cell block if I have to in order to
get it! My life ain't worth nothin' if I take somebody disrespectin' me and
callin' me punk asshole faggot and goin' Ha, Ha! at me. Life ain't worth
livin' if there ain't nothin' worth dyin' for. If you ain't got pride, you got
nothin'. That's all you got! I've already got my pride'. He explained that
the other prisoner was `tryin' to take that away from me. I'm not a total
idiot. I'm not a coward. There ain't nothin I can do except snuff him. I'll
throw gasoline on him and light him'. (1996: 106)
About the use of violence in robbery, Gilligan says:­
Some people think that armed robbers commit their crime in order to get
money. And of course, sometimes that is the way they rationalize their
behavior. But when you sit down and talk with people who repeatedly
commit such crimes, what you hear is, `I never got so much respect
before in my life as I did when I first pointed a gun at somebody', or
`You wouldn't believe how much respect you get when you have a gun
pointed at some dude's face'. For men who have lived for a lifetime on a
diet of contempt and disdain, the temptation to gain instant respect in

this way can be worth far more than the cost of going to prison, or even
dying. (1996: 109)
Discussing the kind of events which can trigger violence, Gilligan says:­
. . . it is well known to anyone who reads the newspapers that people
often seem to become seriously violent, even homicidal, over what are
patently trivial events. (1996: 12)
It is the very triviality of the incidents that precipitate violence, the
kinds of things that provoke homicide and sometimes suicide, whether in
family quarrels or those that occur among friends and lovers on the street
or in barrooms, that has often been commented on, with surprise and
perplexity ­ being given a `dirty look', having one's new shoes stepped
on, being called a demeaning name, having a spouse or lover flirt with
someone else, being shoved by someone at a bar, having someone take
food off one's plate, or refuse to move a car that is blocking one's
driveway . . . (1996: 133)
Everyone has experienced `trivial' insults that rankle. A child is teased
for a difficult word mispronounced, a professional woman is asked to get
the coffee. If these small incidents rankle people with power, prestige,
and status, imagine their effect on people who don't have these advan-
tages . . . (1996: 134)
. . . events that are utterly trivial from any moral or legal point of view
may be of the very greatest importance and significance from a . . .
psychological perspective. (1996: 135)
This view from a prison psychiatrist accords well with Jimmy Boyle's
descriptions of himself. Once known as `the most violent man in Scotland',
Boyle wrote his autobiography in the 10th year of a sentence for man-
slaughter (Boyle 1977). Violence as a means of gaining status and respect is
equally clear in his account.
There is no doubt that when I was sober, alone and faced with reality I
hated myself . . . there was just this completely lost feeling . . . Yet . . .
when I was with my pals, there was this feeling that it was okay and that
having attacked a gang single handed the previous night, I had in some
way proved myself and gained enough confidence to fight alongside
them. I had this hunger to be recognised, to establish a reputation for
myself and it acted as an incentive being with the top guys in the district
at sixteen. There was this inner compulsion for me to win recognition
amongst them. (1977: 79)
Talking of one spell in Barlinnie Prison: ` . . . each of us had reputations,
there had never been this sort of gathering of guys in the criminal element
590 Richard G. Wilkinson, Ichiro Kawachi, Bruce P. Kennedy

in Glasgow ever before. Although we were inside this was still the great
motivating force ­ our reputation' (1977: 131).
Of a period of fundamental self-examination, Boyle said `For the first
time in my life, I was having to think very deeply about violence and other
methods of gaining status' (1977: 240).
The contribution of low socioeconomic status to the need to earn respect
through violence is shown not only in the association between homicide
and income distribution, but also in the frequency with which Boyle men-
tions that fellow prisoners were also from the Gorbals (then the poorest
slum area of Glasgow) and had sometimes even been to the same school as
himself.
Given that violence is a defence of status among those who have few
sources of status and self-esteem, Gilligan suggests that there are three fac-
tors which make the difference between people who are violent and others.
First, he says,
Many of the violent criminals who fill our maximum security prisons . . .
desperately want to feel that they are big, tough, independent, self-
assertive, self-reliant men, so as not to feel needy, helpless, frightened,
inadequate, unskilled, incompetent, and often illiterate. . . . For we will
never understand violence and violent criminals until we see through
what is, in truth, a defensive disguise . . . (1996: 127)
He continues:
The second precondition for violence is met when these men perceive
themselves as having no non-violent means of warding off or diminishing
their feelings of shame or low self-esteem ­ such as socially rewarding
economic or cultural achievement, or high social status, position or
prestige. Violence is a `last resort', a strategy they will use only when no
other alternatives appear possible. (1996: 112)
On the third precondition for violence, Gilligan says
What is startling about the most violent people is how incapable they are,
at least at the time they commit their violence, of feeling love, guilt, or
fear. The person who is overwhelmed by feelings of shame is by definition
experiencing a psychically life-threatening lack of love . . . (1996: 113)
This accords well with Jimmy Boyle's statement (above) that in the cold
light of day he hated himself. It is tempting to see this in the context of his
description of the lack of physical affection in his family life. He says:
for some strange reason or other, actual physical contact in families that
I knew was very limited. I would never think of coming into the house
Mortality, the social environment, crime and violence 591

after all this long absence (on release from several years in prison) and
cuddling my Ma or giving her a kiss or for that matter shaking my
brothers by the hand or embracing them; these things just weren't done.
That was sissy stuff, therefore not for us. (1977: 113)
We are left then with a strong impression that homicide and violence are
so closely related to income inequality because they come out of an extreme
sensitivity to issues of personal social status to which people are particu-
larly vulnerable when excluded from many of the usual sources of status.
Although we have quoted material relating to violent offenders, it is clear
that the same relationships hold in society more widely. The pervasive dis-
crimination and exclusion of African-Americans from mainstream
American society has been postulated to be the phenomenological explana-
tion for younger blacks' preoccupation with respect (readers are referred,
for example, to the eloquent qualitative work by American scholars like
Elijah Anderson (1990) and Bourgois (1995) ). The Washington Post
reporter, Nathan McCall, who grew up in a poverty-stricken neighbour-
hood in Virginia and served time in prison for violent crime, says in his
autobiography:­
For as long as I can remember, black folks have had a serious thing
about respect. I guess it's because white people disrespected them so
blatantly for so long that blacks viciously protected what little morsels of
self-respect they thought they had left. Some of the most brutal battles I
saw in the streets stemmed from seemingly petty stuff . . . But the under-
lying issue was always respect. You could ask a guy, `Damn, man, why
did you bust that dude in the head with a pipe?'
And he might say, `The motherfucka disrespected me!'
That was explanation enough. It wasn't even necessary to explain how
the guy had disrespected him. It was universally understood that if a
dude got disrespected, he had to do what he had to do. It's still that way
today. Young dudes nowadays call it `dissin' '. They'll kill a nigger for
dissin' them. Won't touch a white person, but they'll kill a brother in a
heartbeat over a perceived slight. This irony was that white folks con-
stantly disrespected us in ways seen and unseen, and we tolerated it.
Most blacks understood that the repercussions were more severe for
retaliating against whites than for doing each other in. It was as if black
folks were saying, `I can't do much to keep whites from dissin' me, but I
damn sure can keep black folks from doing it'. (McCall 1994: 52)
Property crime
What then of property crime ­ larceny and motor vehicle theft? The indica-
tions of the social milieu in which it is most common are less clear. While
there have been several papers (cited above) which testify to a sharp distinc-
tion between patterns of violence and theft, there is little work which
592 Richard G. Wilkinson, Ichiro Kawachi, Bruce P. Kennedy
© Blackwell Publishers Ltd/Editorial Board 1998
explores the differences in the social environment from which these crimes
come. The finding that property crime increases in economic recessions
(Field 1990), and that it also rose in response to the spread of television in
the United States (Hennigan et al. 1982) both suggest that it is a response to
relative deprivation. However, the broad pattern of correlations in Table 2
(above) shows that it is not even weakly related to income distribution.
More surprising still is that larceny's weak association with mortality is an
inverse association (Table 2), and that motor vehicle theft shows a signifi-
cant positive relation with median income (r = 0.54) and no relation with
mortality.
Using the World Values Survey (WVS) and the International Crime
Victim Surveys, Halpern (1996) found that `although moral values have lit-
tle or no relationship with the covariants of crime and cannot therefore
"explain" it, a specific sub-set of items tapping "self-interest" do covary
(with crime) and therefore offer some explanations ` (1996: 5). The WVS
covered 50 countries, and common groupings of values were picked out
using factor analysis before the factors were related to crime victimisation
rates. In a subsequent more detailed analysis Halpern (personal communi-
cation) reported a correlation of 0.5 between international crime victimisa-
tion rates and the `self-interest' factor. Although these results come from
data which make no distinction between kinds of crime, as theft is the most
common form of crime in most countries, the patterns which emerge are
likely to reflect its distribution.
Given that in our data larceny and motor vehicle theft are unrelated to
income distribution and tend, if anything, to be more prevalent where
median income is higher and mortality lower, one might then speculate ­ as
Halpern (1996) indeed does ­ that theft arises from values rooted in some-
thing closer to self-interest and individualism, fuelled perhaps as much by
the habit of consumption as by deprivation. Our data did not include fraud
which is clearly a form of property crime not involving violence.
Traditionally regarded as a `white collar crime', fraud is likely to have even
less association with deprivation than larceny and its inclusion would have
led to an even sharper distinction between the pattern of violence and prop-
erty crime.
Indeed, a limitation of our study is the lack of data addressing a broader
conceptualisation of violence and property crime. Thus the routine report-
ing of violent crime ignores the many other forms of institutionalised vio-
lence in society: (a) those which are perpetrated by the State and its
personnel (armed forces, warfare, police, and prisons); (b) those to which
the State turns a blind eye (domestic violence, firearm ownership, motor
vehicle violence ­ `road rage', speeding, and drunk driving); as well as (c)
those which are professionalised, rarely apprehended, and a necessary part
of illegal business activity (illegal drugs, loan sharking, prostitution, protec-
tion). Similarly, a broader definition of property crime (e.g. extraction of
surplus value, tax evasion, fraud and white collar crime) would have sharp-

ened the distinctions we are trying to draw. Additionally, the usual caveats
apply in attempting to interpret findings based on crime statistics, which are
mediated via processes of report, arrest, charge, and trial; and are conse-
quently biased against the poor, the inarticulate, and those with low social
status.
Conclusions
Our argument is not that the number of homicide victims account for the
relationship between health and income distribution. It is that the violence
associated with income inequality serves as an indicator of the psychosocial
impact of wider income differences. What we can take away from this dis-
cussion is that the most pressing aspect of relative deprivation and low rela-
tive income is less the shortage of the material goods which others have, as
the low social status and the desperate lack of sources of self-esteem which
usually goes with it. If social cohesion matters to health, then perhaps the
component of it which matters most is that people have positions and roles
in society which accord them dignity and respect. We infer this from the
fact that it is violence rather than property crime which varies so closely
with income distribution, social trust and mortality. Unlike theft, which is
in a sense a relationship with property, violence is a much more intensely
social crime and seems above all to express a lack of adequate internal and
external sources of self-esteem, dignity and social status.
As Miller and Ferroggiaro (1996) have pointed out `Respect and self-
respect are central components of an enlarged concept of citizenship . . .
Respect affects how we are treated, what help from others is likely, what
economic arrangements others are willing to engage in with us, when reci-
procity is to be expected'. Respect acts as a resource for individuals, and
should be considered a component of the norms of reciprocity, trust, and
social obligation that are essential for minimising the risks of poor physical,
psychological, or social health (Aday 1994). Indeed, mutual respect and the
avoidance of inflicting humiliation on people is the central concept of
Margalit's `decent society' (Margalit 1996). As he says, a decent society
`does not injure the civic honour of those belonging to it' (1996: 151). That
honour and shame are so crucial to human social relations and may often
become issues of life and death has long been recognised by social anthro-
pologists (Peristiany 1965).
The impressive body of work on the physiological effects of the chronic
stress experienced by low status baboons and macaques (Sapolsky 1993,
Shively et al. 1994, Shively et al. 1997) suggests that there may be a number
of health effects which spring directly from low social status among
humans, and some of the same physiological effects of low social status
have been found among humans as among these non-human primates
(Brunner 1997). However, if issues round shame, respect, self-esteem, are
594 Richard G. Wilkinson, Ichiro Kawachi, Bruce P. Kennedy

how we conceptualise the most powerful psychosocial impact of low social
status, then it is still difficult to distinguish between the individual and
social effects of inequality on health status. As Pitt-Rivers (1965) says,
`Honour is the value of a person in his own eyes, but also in the eyes of
society. It is his estimation of his own worth, his claim to pride, but it is
also the acknowledgement of that claim . . . by society' (1965: 21).
Considerable research has already documented the contribution to the
social gradient in health attributable to factors such as unemployment, job
insecurity, sense of control and other sources of difficulty associated with
disadvantage. Perhaps more attention should now be given to the psy-
chosocial effects most directly inherent in low social status itself.
