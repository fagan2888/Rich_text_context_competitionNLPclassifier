Homicide-followed-by-suicide (referred to as ``homicide-suicide'') incidents are rare events but can have a profound
impact on families and communities. A better understanding of perpetrator characteristics and how they compare with
those of other homicide suspects and suicide decedents might provide insight into the nature of these violent acts.This
report is based on 2003­2005 data from 17 US states participating in the National Violent Death Reporting System,
a unique, incident-based, active surveillance system that integrates data on violent deaths from multiple sources. Of
the 408 homicide-suicide incidents identified, most incidents were committed with a firearm (88.2%) and perpetrated
by males (91.4%), those over 19 years of age (97.6%), and those of white race (77.0%); however, just over half of
filicide (killing of children)-suicides (51.5%) were perpetrated by females. Over 55% of male homicide-suicide perpe-
trators versus 26.4% of other male suicide decedents had prior intimate partner conflicts (P < 0.001). In fact, having
a history of intimate partner conflicts was even common among homicide-suicide perpetrators who did not victimize
their intimate partners. Recognition of the link between intimate partner conflicts and homicide-suicide incidents and
strategies involving collaboration among the court/legal and mental health systems might prevent these incidents.

A homicide-followed-by-suicide (hereafter referred to as
``homicide-suicide'') incident is generally defined as a
2-stage sequential act in which a person kills 1 or more in-
dividuals and then commits suicide shortly thereafter (1­3).
Although homicide-suicide incidents are relatively rare events,
they account for approximately 1,000­1,500 violent deaths
annually or 20­30 violent deaths weekly (3). Homicide-
suicide incidents can have long-term traumatic effects on
those closely associated with the incident and frequently
have a profound psychological impact on communities
(4). Some incidents involve multiple fatalities among individ-
uals unrelated to the perpetrator, as did the 2007 shooting
incidents at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univer-
sity and the 1999 incident at Columbine High School (5);
however, for the vast majority of homicide-suicide inci-
dents, the homicide victim is a current or former female
intimate partner of a male perpetrator (1­3).
Some studies have proposed typologies for categorizing
these incidents to help guide future research into this phe-
nomenon (3, 6). These typologies are typically based on the
victim-perpetrator relationships and generally include the
following, by order of commonality: intimate partner-
related homicide-suicide incidents (approximately 42%­
69% of homicide-suicide incidents); familicide (killing of
all family members in a household) or filicide (killing of
children)-suicide incidents (18%­47% of homicide-suicide
incidents); and extrafamilial homicide (killing of nonfamily
members)-suicide incidents (12%­26% of homicide-suicide
incidents) (1, 7). Some incidents are also of mixed type,
where there are familial and extrafamilial victims involved.
Several studies have evaluated homicide-suicide inci-
dents within selected populations (e.g., among the elderly)
(8), in individual states (7, 9­12), and across multiple cities
(13) and other countries (14­16). Few population-based

studies on homicide-suicide incidents from multiple states are
available in the literature. Using 2003­2004 data from the
National Violent Death Reporting System, Bossarte et al.
(2) estimated that only 11% of homicide-suicide perpetrators
have a documented mental health condition and that approxi-
mately 30% are intoxicated at the time of the incident. Over
85% of perpetrators were male, and more than 70% were
non-Hispanic white. Additionally, over 70% of victims in
homicide-suicide incidents were female, and over 55% of
victims were current or former intimate partners. Approxi-
mately 20% of victims are the perpetrator's children,
stepchildren, or other relatives. Approximately 80% of homi-
cide-suicide incidents occurred in either the victim's or per-
petrator's home, and over 80% were committed with
a firearm. These findings were similar to those from earlier
studies (7, 9­12, 17­21).
Circumstances leading up to these violent events have
also been described in several studies. These include es-
trangement associated with divorce or breakup (1, 3, 10,
11, 13, 14, 17), real or perceived infidelity (1, 3, 14), mercy
killing or death pact (2, 3, 22), and loss of employment or
financial problems (2). Some events are also likely to be
idiosyncratic of a perpetrator's delusions or psychopathol-
ogy (5, 23).
Although previous studies have expanded our knowledge
about the characteristics of homicide-suicide incidents,
many areas require further exploration. For example, there
is little information comparing perpetrator characteristics
across types of homicide-suicide incidents (typology based
on the victim-perpetrator relationship). Similarly, there is
little information available with respect to how character-
istics of homicide-suicide perpetrators compare with those
who commit homicide alone or those who commit suicide
alone. Such information may lead to an increased under-
standing of etiologic factors related to the perpetration of
homicide-suicide incidents (1, 3) and may inform the de-
velopment of prevention and intervention efforts.
The primary objective of this study was to describe per-
petrators across a full range of homicide-suicide incidents
that occurred within a multistate, population-based surveil-
lance system. Additionally, we compared homicide-suicide
perpetrators with other suicide decedents and with other
homicide suspects to assess differences and similarities.
To the authors' knowledge, no study to date has had suffi-
cient samples to do this kind of analysis by use of multiple
data sources.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data source
The National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS)
is an incident-based, violent death surveillance system that
combines data from multiple sources. Data collection for
the NVDRS began in 2003 in 7 states (Alaska, Maryland,
Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, South Carolina, and
Virginia). In 2004, 6 states were added (Colorado, Georgia,
North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin).
In 2005, 4 states were added (California, Kentucky, New
Mexico, and Utah), bringing the total (as of 2008) to 17
states. Data collection is statewide with the exception of Cal-
ifornia, which collects data in only 4 counties (Los Angeles,
Riverside, San Francisco, and Santa Clara).
Information is gathered from participating states on all
suicides, homicides, legal intervention deaths, unintentional
firearm deaths, and deaths for which the manner is undeter-
mined (24, 25). The NVDRS includes information on the
victims of violent death, the suspected perpetrators and their
relationships to the victims, the involved weapons, and the
circumstances leading up to the injury event (24, 26). Data
from coroner and medical examiner reports, toxicology re-
ports, various law enforcement records, supplemental homi-
cide reports, and death certificates are linked into a single
data repository. Several optional reports can also be linked
into the data set, depending on the states' preferences. These
include crime lab reports, firearm trace reports from the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and child fatality
reviews. Such integrated data provide greater insight into the
nature of violent deaths than does any single data source (24).
States manage data collection typically through state
health departments or a subcontracted entity, such as a med-
ical examiner's office. Data are gathered and coded by
trained abstracters in each state. Data may be extracted from
various reports or imported electronically from other sys-
tems (i.e., Bureau of Vital Statistics' death certificate files or
medical examiner's data sets). All data are reviewed by the
abstracter to ensure accuracy of the codes (27). To maintain
consistency among abstracters, each abstracter follows
a strict NVDRS coding manual. Additionally, for quality
control purposes, 10% of all narratives are reviewed by staff
of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ensure
accurate coding of circumstances preceding the violent
death. The NVDRS has been described in further detail
elsewhere (24, 27).
Case finding
The data used for this analysis represent the calendar
years 2003­2005. Case identification was conducted from
an NVDRS database that was updated through June 2007.
Homicide and suicide incidents were identified by the man-
ner of death recorded from the death certificates. Homicide-
suicide incidents were defined as suicide incidents where the
perpetrator committed at least one homicide within 1 calen-
dar day prior to his or her suicide death. Incidents were
categorized as homicide-suicide, homicide-only, or suicide-
only incidents.
The homicide-suicide incidents were further categorized
on the basis of the victim-perpetrator relationship. Informa-
tion on the victim-perpetrator relationship was obtained
from the narratives of the law enforcement, coroner, and
medical examiner reports. In general, these narratives are
based on information gathered from the victim's neighbors,
friends, family members, and other acquaintances.
Between 2003 and 2005, there were 420 homicide-
suicide incidents, 20,188 suicide-only incidents, and 5,932
homicide-only incidents where 1 perpetrator is reported
(homicide-only incidents were excluded if the perpetrator
was either unknown (n ¼ 2,388) or the incident had multiple
perpetrators (n ¼ 1,516)). It should be noted that information
Perpetrators of Homicides Followed by Suicides 1057
Am J Epidemiol 2008;168:1056­1064
regarding trial results and convictions of suspected perpe-
trators is not included in the NVDRS. Therefore, in the re-
mainder of this report, the term ``suspects'' is used, which
includes both perpetrators and ``suspected'' perpetrators.
Of the 420 homicide-suicide incidents identified, the
victim-perpetrator relationship could not be identified in
12 incidents; therefore, these incidents were excluded from
this study. For the remaining 408 homicide-suicide inci-
dents, 304 (74.5%) involved current or former intimate part-
ners (this included spouse, former spouse, girlfriend,
boyfriend, former girlfriend, and former boyfriend). There
were 33 (8.1%) filicide-suicide incidents; these included
child, stepchild, and foster child (child of the suspect, in-
cluding both young and adult children). Additionally, there
were 29 (7.1%) ``other'' family-related homicide-suicide in-
cidents (including parent, sibling, grandchild, grandparent,
in-law, stepparent, child of suspect's boyfriend or girlfriend,
intimate partner of suspect's parents, foster parent, other
family member) and 42 (10.3%) extrafamilial homicide-
suicide incidents (babysitter, acquaintance, friend, room-
mate, current or former coworker, rival gang member, other
person known to victim, or stranger).
Intimate partner-related homicide-suicide incidents were
further divided into 2 categories, those with only intimate
partners (n ¼ 280, 68.6% of total incidents) and those with
intimate partners and one or more additional victims (n ¼ 24,
5.9% of total incidents). For the majority of the intimate
partner-related incidents that had other victims (n ¼ 16),
the additional victims were children. For 8 incidents, the
additional victims were friends, strangers, or other family
members.
Analysis
Homicide-suicide perpetrators were compared across the
various types by calculating frequency distributions of de-
mographic factors (i.e., age, sex, race, and ethnicity) and
various health-related and preceding life-event circumstan-
ces known to be risk factors for suicide and/or homicide (all
health-related and circumstance information was gathered
from the narratives written in the various law enforcement
and coroner and medical examiner reports). These factors
included having a current mental health condition, having
a history of substance abuse problems, being suspected of
intoxication at the time of the event, having a history of
suicide attempts, having serious physical health problems
(e.g., chronic pain or cancer), having a history of intimate
partner conflict, having a history of other relationship prob-
lems, and having job or financial problems (28­31). Com-
parisons were also made regarding whether the perpetrator
disclosed suicide intent (indicating signs of premeditation),
whether the perpetrator was receiving mental health treat-
ment (i.e., currently in mental health treatment or using
antidepressants), and whether the perpetrator committed
the act out of the belief that he or she was relieving some
form of suffering (i.e., mercy killing). Because cell sizes
were often small, Fisher's exact tests were used to assess
statistical significance for all categorical variables. The sig-
nificance of observed differences in median age across the
subtypes was evaluated by the Kruskal-Wallis test.
Perpetrators of homicide-suicide incidents were also
compared with those who only committed suicide and those
who only committed homicide. This analysis was stratified
by sex, because male and female perpetrators often have
different characteristics and preceding circumstances (3).
For this analysis, 3 homicide-suicide perpetrators, 5 suicide
decedents, and 843 homicide suspects were excluded be-
cause the sex of the perpetrator was unknown. Bivariate
analyses using Fisher's exact tests and a Wilcoxon test were
conducted to assess significant differences in demographic
variables.
Odds ratios were used to compare homicide-suicide per-
petrators with other suicide decedents on the basis of the
same health-related and life-event circumstances listed in
the previous analysis. Because the NVDRS is a violent
death surveillance system, less information is available with
respect to the characteristics of suspected perpetrators
who are still living. Therefore, we were unable to compare
homicide-suicide perpetrators with homicide-only suspects
with respect to these factors. Multivariable logistic regres-
sion analysis was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios;
each model adjusted for age and racial/ethnic differences
in order to make the two groups more comparable. Fisher's
exact tests and the Wilcoxon test were conducted by using
the SAS for Windows 9.1 statistical package (SAS Institute,
Inc., Cary, North Carolina). The multivariable logistic re-
gression analyses were conducted by using the Stata/SE for
Windows 10.0 statistical package (StataCorp LP, College
Station, Texas).
RESULTS
The demographic characteristics of the homicide-suicide
perpetrators, stratified by homicide-suicide type, are pre-
sented in Table 1. Overall, perpetrators were mostly male
(91.4%), over 19 years of age (97.6%) (median age, 43
years), of white race (77.0%), and of non-Hispanic ethnic
status (89.5%). Most homicide-suicide perpetrators (64%)
were aged between 20 and 49 years, ranging from 76.2% of
the extrafamilial homicide-suicide incidents to 61.4% of the
intimate partner-only homicide-suicide incidents. However,
a high proportion (37.1%) of intimate partner-only homicide-
suicide perpetrators were 50 years of age or older.
Among incidents with male perpetrators, the vast major-
ity of victims were female intimate partners (77.7%); 4%
were children. In contrast, the victims of female homicide-
suicide perpetrators were most likely to be children
(48.6%); 40% of victims were male intimate partners. Thus,
over half (51.5%) of the filicide-suicide incidents were com-
mitted by female perpetrators.
The majority of homicide-suicide incidents (>85%) were
committed by perpetrators that were not suspected of being
in a depressed mood or having a mental health condition by
family members or friends. However, a third of filicide-
suicide perpetrators were reported to be depressed or to have
a current mental health problem (Table 2). Furthermore, for
all types of homicide-suicide incidents, the majority of the
perpetrators did not have prior reports of alcohol or sub-
stance abuse problems, a history of suicide attempts, or
1058 Logan et al.
Am J Epidemiol 2008;168:1056­1064
physical health problems. However, with the exception of the
filicide-suicide perpetrators, about 1 in 5 perpetrators was
suspected of being intoxicated at the time of the incident.
Only 4.9% of the homicide-suicide incidents were be-
lieved to have been the result of a mercy killing (Table 2).
Of the 20 homicide-suicide incidents that were precipitated
by this circumstance, 19 (95%) of them involved an intimate
partner.
Approximately 10% of the perpetrators were currently in
mental health treatment at the time of committing the
homicide-suicide incident; the highest proportion (21.2%)
was among those who committed filicide-suicide incidents
(Table 2). Furthermore, for those with toxicology reports,
a high proportion (36.4%) of the filicide-suicide perpetrators
were found to be on antidepressant medications, suggesting
that they had previously sought treatment for clinical de-
pression or another mood disorder.
The most common weapon used by homicide-suicide per-
petrators, regardless of the victims involved, was a firearm
(Table 2). In general, 88.2% of homicide-suicide perpetra-
tors, ranging from 72.7% of filicide-suicide perpetrators to
97.6% of extrafamilial homicide-suicide perpetrators, used
a firearm to commit the violent act.
With the exception of the other-family-related type of
homicide-suicide incidents, intimate partner conflict was
the most common preceding life-event factor among perpe-
trators (53.9%) (Table 2). In addition to the intimate partner-
related homicide-suicide incidents, these problems were
also common among filicide-suicide perpetrators (36.4%)
and extrafamilial-related homicide-suicide perpetrators
(35.7%).
Demographic characteristics of homicide-suicide perpe-
trators were compared with those of suicide-only decedents
and homicide-only suspects (Table 3). An estimated 92.1%
(n ¼ 373) of homicide-suicide perpetrators were male, com-
pared with 78.2% (n ¼ 15,793) of suicide-only decedents
and 89.7% (n ¼ 4,569) of homicide suspects. For both
males and females, approximately 60% or more of the per-
petrators were aged between 20 and 49 years across all
groups (homicide followed by suicide, suicide only, and
homicide only). A significant proportion of male homicide-
suicide perpetrators and suicide-only decedents were aged
50 years or older (33.2% and 37.9%, respectively). Com-
pared with male homicide-suicide perpetrators, a higher
proportion of male homicide-only suspects were aged 10­
19 years. This same pattern was observed for females. Simi-
larly, for both male and female perpetrators, the vast majority
of homicide-suicide perpetrators and suicide-only decedents
were white non-Hispanics. Male and female homicide-only
suspects were more evenly distributed among white (29.2%),
black (47.4%), and other races (21.3%). However, for male
homicide-only suspects who victimized an intimate partner,
the distribution by race differed in that 40.2% were white and
39% were black (data not shown).
Table 4 compares the health, mental health, and life-event
factors of homicide-suicide perpetrators with those of
suicide-only decedents. Compared with males who died
by suicide, male homicide-suicide perpetrators were signif-
icantly less likely to have reports of depressed mood, mental
health problems, alcohol or substance abuse problems, a his-
tory of suicide attempts, physical health problems, mental
health treatment, or job or financial problems or to have

disclosed intent. They were significantly more likely to have
a history of intimate partner conflicts. Further analysis of the
208 male homicide-suicide perpetrators who had a history
of intimate partner conflict revealed that 191 (92%) of these
perpetrators used a firearm in the homicide-suicide incident
(Appendix Table 1). Furthermore, 75 (39.3%) of these 191
perpetrators were believed to have retaliated in response to
a divorce request or breakup. In addition, 14 (7.3%) of these
191 perpetrators were currently in mental health treatment,
and 34 (17.8%) were currently or recently in court for
family-related issues (i.e., divorce, custody, child support)
or were recently issued a restraining order.
When compared with female suicide-only decedents, fe-
male homicide-suicide perpetrators were less likely to be
intoxicated at the time of the incident and less likely to have
a prior history of suicide attempts. However, the 2 groups
were similar in that a large proportion of female homicide-
suicide perpetrators were identified as being in a depressed
mood (28.6%), currently having a mental health problem
(42.9%), currently being in treatment for a mental health
condition at the time of the incident (31.4%), and having
a history of intimate partner conflict preceding the incident
(34.3%) (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
Similar to previous research, this study found that most
homicide-suicide incidents were perpetrated by white males
in middle to late adulthood. Also consistent with pre-
vious research, this study found that most homicide-suicide
incidents were committed with a firearm (2, 7, 9­11, 17, 20),
the majority of victims were either current or former inti-
mate partners, and a substantial number of victims were
children (2, 9, 10). We also found that having a history of
intimate partner conflict was highly common among most

homicide-suicide perpetrators, even those who did not
victimize their intimate partners in the homicide-suicide
incident (e.g., extrafamilial homicide-suicide and filicide-
suicide incidents). Our findings also suggest that homicide-
suicide perpetration, particularly by males, is mostly
preceded by intimate partner conflicts/violence as opposed
to other determinants of suicidal behavior.
Although the demographics of homicide-suicide perpe-
trators, in general, differed from those of other homicide
suspects, the demographics of males who perpetrated inti-
mate partner-related homicide-suicide incidents were more
similar to those of male suspects in intimate partner homi-
cides. In addition, circumstances surrounding many of the
intimate partner-related homicide-suicide incidents were sim-
ilar to those of intimate partner violence (e.g., divorces or
separations) (32). Primary prevention of intimate partner vi-
olence (preventing violence before it starts) using promising,
effective strategies is an important step toward reducing the
occurrence of homicide-suicide incidents and the violent
deaths of intimate partners, children, family, friends, and even
strangers that are associated with these incidents. Such strat-
egies include changing social norms, role modeling, and
mentoring adolescents and young adults to help them develop
and sustain healthy, respectful relationship behaviors (32).
Our finding that many of these perpetrators were cur-
rently involved in a family legal court case at the time of
the incident also highlights the importance of reducing frag-
mentation between the court/legal system and the mental

health system. Recognition of the link among family court
issues, mental distress, and homicide-suicide violence might
help to improve communication between these two systems.
Innovative approaches that might facilitate this communi-
cation without slowing the legal processes include using
case managers to rapidly evaluate access to firearms, gather
histories of domestic violence, and make referrals to mental
health providers for those in need of counseling.
Furthermore, the fact that some perpetrators had previ-
ously been issued restraining orders highlights the need for
effective interventions, once the violence has occurred. For
example, a number of integrated domestic violence courts
have been specifically designed to improve defendant ac-
countability and to enhance victim safety (33). By working
with a wide spectrum of stakeholders (e.g., civil attorneys
and law enforcement, probation, and parole professionals),
judges in these courts gain greater access to much needed
information. These courts also increase coordination among
criminal justice and community-based social service agen-
cies to provide rapid and comprehensive victim advocacy
and links to appropriate services (34).
In contrast to intimate partner-related homicide-suicide
perpetrators, a high proportion of filicide-suicide perpetra-
tors were found by this study to be in mental health treat-
ment at the time of the incident. This finding may be
expected because approximately half of these incidents are
committed by females (35, 36), and females are more likely
than males to seek care for mental health conditions (37,
38). This study also found that many of the filicide-suicide
perpetrators who sought mental health treatment committed
the violent act with a firearm. Feeling distressed, sad, or
depressed and having access to a weapon of lethal means

are associated with increased risk of lethal violence (39).
The fact that many filicide-suicide perpetrators sought treat-
ment before the incident indicates the potential opportunity
for mental health providers to play a role in reducing the risk
of homicide-suicide incidents involving children. For exam-
ple, for parents who seek treatment for mental health con-
ditions, providers may be able to evaluate access to firearms
in the household, to obtain additional help for caregiving
responsibilities, and to recruit family members to help mon-
itor the patient's treatment and progress (3).
The results from this study are subject to at least 4 lim-
itations. First, because this study used a 24-hour period to
define homicide-suicide incidents, the number of homicide-
suicide incidents may have been underestimated. Second,
the information on mental health and substance abuse is
not routinely reported by all investigators, and relevant data
sources (e.g., medical records) are not required for the
NVDRS; therefore, this study probably underestimated the
prevalence of these factors. Furthermore, because such
histories are typically provided by family members and
friends, the accuracy of the information is often unknown
(2). Third, little information is available on the homicide-
only suspects, thereby limiting our ability to compare them
with homicide-suicide perpetrators. Fourth, medical investi-
gators and police officers may be more or less likely to seek
specific information (e.g., history of depression), depending
on whether the event is a homicide-suicide incident, a suicide-
only incident, or a homicide-only incident. This could
account for the low prevalence of these characteristics among
homicide-suicide perpetrators found in this study. These char-
acteristics were found to be prevalent among filicide-suicide
perpetrators, suggesting that this bias is unlikely, although
investigators might be more inclined to assess mental health
factors among those who perpetrate violence on children.
This study improves our understanding of homicide-
suicide incidents by using the multistate NVDRS. Continued
data collection will allow for better descriptions of homi-
cide-suicide perpetrators, which will further inform preven-
tion and intervention efforts to address this important public
health problem.
