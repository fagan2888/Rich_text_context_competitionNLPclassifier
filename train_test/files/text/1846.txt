HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS
(HPV) is estimated to be the
most common sexually
transmitted infection in the
UnitedStates.1 HPVprevalencehasbeen
found to be highest among young per-
sons within the first few years after
sexual debut.2-6 However, there are no
data on the prevalence of HPV among
women across a broad age range and
representative of the US population.
Genital HPV types are categorized ac-
cording to their epidemiological asso-
ciation with cervical cancer. Infec-
tions with low-risk types, such as HPV
types 6 and 11, can cause benign or low-
grade changes in cells of the cervix,
genital warts, and recurrent respira-
tory papillomatosis. High-risk HPV
types can cause cervical, anal, and other
genital cancers. High-risk HPV types are
detected in 99% of cervical cancers, and
worldwide approximately 70% of cer-
vical cancers are due to HPV types 16
and 18.7,8 Although HPV infection is
common, studies suggest approxi-
mately 90% of infections clear within
2 years.9,10
A highly efficacious prophylactic
vaccine against HPV types 6, 11, 16,
and 18 was licensed in June 2006 and
recommended for routine use in
females aged 11 to 12 years in the
United States.11-14 Clinical studies of
the quadrivalent HPV vaccine demon-
strated close to 100% efficacy in pre-
venting infection and disease (cervical
cancer precursors, genital lesions)
associated with types included in the
vaccine in analyses restricted to those
women who were naive to HPV types
6, 11, 16, or 18 (either by HPV DNA
or HPV antibodies).
Representative data on type-
specific prevalence of HPV DNA
detection in the United States could
provide a baseline estimate to mea-

Context Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is estimated to be the most com-
mon sexually transmitted infection. Baseline population prevalence data for HPV in-
fection in the United States before widespread availability of a prophylactic HPV vac-
cine would be useful.
Objective To determine the prevalence of HPV among females in the United States.
Design, Setting, and Participants The National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES) uses a representative sample of the US noninstitutionalized ci-
vilian population. Females aged 14 to 59 years who were interviewed at home for
NHANES 2003-2004 were examined in a mobile examination center and provided a
self-collected vaginal swab specimen. Swabs were analyzed for HPV DNA by L1 con-
sensus polymerase chain reaction followed by type-specific hybridization. Demo-
graphic and sexual behavior information was obtained from all participants.
Main Outcome Measures HPV prevalence by polymerase chain reaction.
Results The overall HPV prevalence was 26.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 23.3%-
30.9%) among US females aged 14 to 59 years (n=1921). HPV prevalence was 24.5%
(95% CI, 19.6%-30.5%) among females aged 14 to 19 years, 44.8% (95% CI, 36.3%-
55.3%) among women aged 20 to 24 years, 27.4% (95% CI, 21.9%-34.2%) among
women aged 25 to 29 years, 27.5% (95% CI, 20.8%-36.4%) among women aged
30 to 39 years, 25.2% (95% CI, 19.7%-32.2%) among women aged 40 to 49 years,
and 19.6% (95% CI, 14.3%-26.8%) among women aged 50 to 59 years. There was
a statistically significant trend for increasing HPV prevalence with each year of age
from 14 to 24 years (P.001), followed by a gradual decline in prevalence through
59 years (P=.06). HPV vaccine types 6 and 11 (low-risk types) and 16 and 18 (high-
risk types) were detected in 3.4% of female participants; HPV-6 was detected in 1.3%
(95% CI, 0.8%-2.3%), HPV-11 in 0.1% (95% CI, 0.03%-0.3%), HPV-16 in 1.5%
(95% CI, 0.9%-2.6%), and HPV-18 in 0.8% (95% CI, 0.4%-1.5%) of female par-
ticipants. Independent risk factors for HPV detection were age, marital status, and in-
creasing numbers of lifetime and recent sex partners.
Conclusions HPV is common among females in the United States. Our data indi-
cate that the burden of prevalent HPV infection among females was greater than pre-
vious estimates and was highest among those aged 20 to 24 years. However, the preva-
lence of HPV vaccine types was relatively low.

sure the wide-scale impact of the vac-
cine for reducing infection and could
help guide models evaluating impact
and cost effectiveness. With wide-
spread implementation of the pro-
phylactic HPV vaccine, decreases in
the prevalence of vaccine HPV types
would be expected. To determine a
prevaccine population-based preva-
lence of cervicovaginal HPV in the
United States, we performed HPV
DNA testing on self-collected vaginal
swabs among females participating in
the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES)
2003-2004.
METHODS
Study Population
and Study Design
NHANES is conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics,
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention, and uses a representative
sample of the US noninstitutionalized
civilian population. The representative
sample is obtained by using a com-
plex, stratified, multistage probability
sample design with unequal probabili-
ties of selection to obtain a nationally
representative sample.15 Certain sub-
groups of people, such as adolescents,
non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican
Americans are oversampled. All
females aged 14 to 59 years selected
for NHANES 2003-2004 were eligible
for participation in this study. Of 2482
females aged 14 to 59 years who were
interviewed at home for the 2003-
2004 cycle, 2387 (96.2%) were exam-
ined in a mobile examination center. A
total of 2026 females (81.6%) submit-
ted cervicovaginal swab specimens.
Four hundred sixty-six females
(23.0%) were considered nonre-
sponders because they either submit-
ted an inadequate swab specimen
(n=105) or they did not submit a
swab specimen (n=361). There were
significant differences between nonre-
sponders and responders on some
demographic and behavioral variables
(nonresponders were significantly
more likely than responders to be of
other race/ethnicity, to be younger
[40 years], to be born outside the
United States or Mexico, and to have
never had sex). Written informed con-
sent was obtained from all partici-
pants, and parental permission for
those females younger than 18 years.
This human subjects research was
approved by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention institutional
review board.
Demographic and Behavioral Data
Race and ethnicity were self-reported
into categories, including non-
Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white,
and Mexican American. Poverty index
ratio was calculated by dividing total
family income by the poverty thresh-
old index, adjusted for family size at
year of interview.16 Estimates of the
total number of cases were generated
by multiplying the appropriate popu-
lation size from the January 2004
monthly postcensal civilian noninsti-
tutionalized population17 by the
weighted prevalence estimate among
females in the appropriate age
category.
Sex was defined as vaginal, oral, or
anal sex. For those females who had at
least 1 lifetime sex partner, additional
questions were asked on age of first sex
and lifetime number of sex partners. For
those females aged 14 to 17 years who
were sexually active, additional ques-
tions about sexual behavior were asked,
including age at first sex, number of life-
time partners, and ever use of a con-
dom. For women aged 18 years or older
who were sexually active, additional
questions were asked on number and
gender of sex partners in the last 12
months and lifetime sex partners, and
past history of sexually transmitted in-
fections.
Specimen Collection
and Processing
Females aged 14 to 59 years were
asked to self-collect a cervicovaginal
sample in the mobile examination
center. In brief, each female was given
a collection device, which was a small
foam swab on a plastic handle pack-
aged in an individual reclosable plastic
sleeve (Catch-All Sample Collection
Swabs Epicenter, Madison, Wis). Par-
ticipants were instructed to wash their
hands before opening the swab, to
hold the swab by the end of the
handle, to insert the foam swab into
the vagina similar to inserting a tam-
pon, to gently turn the swab during a
count of 10, and to replace the swab in
the plastic sleeve, avoiding contact
with the external genitalia. Partici-
pants took swabs and instructions into
a bathroom and collected the samples
in privacy. Swabs were given to
NHANES personnel, stored at room
temperature, and mailed to the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Preven-
tion laboratory for processing.
DNA Isolation
DNA was extracted using slight modi-
fications of the QIAmp Mini Kit pro-
tocol (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif) within
1 month of sample collection. Briefly,
swabs were incubated at 56°C for at
least 12 hours in proteinase K lysis so-
lution. One half of each sample was
added to an equal volume of 100% etha-
nol and applied to each of 2 QIAmp
Mini columns for DNA isolation. The
eluates were collected, washed, and
concentrated in Microcon 100 concen-
trators (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh,
Pa), adjusting the final volume to 100
µL with deionized distilled water.
Samples were tested immediately or
stored at -20°C. For every 40 samples,
a water blank was processed through
all steps of extraction to serve as a con-
tamination control.
HPV Genotyping Test
HPV detection and typing was per-
formed by using the Roche prototype
line blot assay (reagents provided as a
gift from Roche Molecular Systems Inc,
Pleasanton, Calif). This assay uses HPV
L1 consensus polymerase chain reac-
tion with biotinylated PGMY09/11
primer sets and -globin as an inter-
nal control for sample amplifica-
tion.18,19 Five µL of the DNA was used
in the 100-µL polymerase chain reac-
tion. Amplicons (10 µL) were evalu-
ated for -globin and HPV bands with

1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis stained
with ethidium bromide, and those am-
plicons with an HPV band were hy-
bridized to the typing strips. The first
generationstripusedfromJanuary2003
to April 2004 included probes for 27
HPV types (6, 11, 16, 18, 26, 31, 33,
35, 39, 40, 42, 45, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55,
56, 57, 58, 59, 66, 68, 73, 82, 83, and
84). The second generation strip used
after April 2004 included additional
types (61, 62, 64, 67, 69, 70, 71, 72, 81,
89, and IS39) but omitted HPV-57.20
Samples that did not hybridize the strip
were sequenced as previously de-
scribed to determine HPV type.21
Samples negative for both -globin and
HPV (n=105, 5.2%) were considered
inadequate for interpretation and were
omitted from further analysis. We con-
sidered low-risk HPV types as HPV type
6, 11, 32, 40, 42, 44, 54, 55, 61, 62, 64,
71, 72, 74, 81, 83, 84, 87, 89, and 91;
and high-risk HPV types as HPV type
16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52,
53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 73,
82, 85, and IS39.
Statistical Analysis
Females who submitted an adequate
swab for HPV evaluation were in-
cluded in the final analysis (n=1921).
Statistical analyses were conducted
using SAS version 9.122 and SAS call-
able SUDAAN.23 Variance estimates
were calculated by using a Taylor se-
ries linearization that incorporated the
complex sample design of the sur-
vey.24 All estimates were weighted using
the 2003-2004 medical examination
weights provided by National Center for
Health Statistics to account for the un-
equal probabilities of selection and ad-
justment for nonresponse. The weight-
ing methodology has been described
previously.25 Because there were some
missing laboratory specimens, we in-
vestigated whether any additional non-
response adjustments to the original
NHANES weights were needed. We
found that using weights with an ad-
ditional nonresponse and poststratifi-
cation adjustment always provided
prevalence estimates within the 95%
confidence interval (CI) based on the
original NHANES weight; therefore, no
additional adjustments to the NHANES
weights were made.
We considered a prevalence esti-
mate unreliable if the relative SE was
more than 30% of the prevalence esti-
mate; these estimates are not pre-
sented. Confidence intervals were cal-
culated by using a log transformation
with the SE of the log prevalence based
on the delta method and applying
SUDAAN estimated SEs.26 Tests of as-
sociation between HPV and the demo-
graphic or behavioral characteristics
were based on the Wald 2 statistic. To
compare the prevalence between HPV
types, we applied a version of the
McNemar test for complex surveys. No
adjustments were made to the P val-
ues for multiple comparisons.
To explore the association with age
andoverallHPVprevalence,agewascat-
egorizedinto4-yearintervals(14-19,20-
24, 25-29, etc) and plotted against the
logoddsofHPV.Theplotrevealedanon-
linear association between age and HPV
prevalence. Prevalence increased up to
age 20 to 24 years and then decreased.
To test for the presence of an increasing
linear trend among those females
younger than 24 years and a decreasing
linear trend for those females older than
24 years, 2 separate logistic regressions
were used. Each logistic regression
treated age as a continuous variable and
was restricted to the age range under in-
vestigation. A trend was considered sta-
tistically significant if the  coefficient
for the independant variable was non-
zeroatP.05,usingtheSatterthwaitead-
justed F test.
Demographic and behavioral char-
acteristics of participants were evalu-
ated. Characteristics significant at the
P.20 level based on a Wald 2 statis-
tic were considered in a multivariate
model. There are only 15 df available
to develop a multivariate model, due
to the complex survey design in the
2-year cycle of NHANES. To limit the
df used when including age in the
model, we collapsed age into 4 catego-
ries (18-19, 20-24, 25-29, and 30-59
years), because the prevalences for age
categories between ages 30 and 59
years did not differ significantly. The
multivariate model was limited to
females aged 18 to 59 years because all
questions regarding sexual exposures
were asked of this group. We used
SUDAAN for logistic regression to
model independent associations
between prevalence of any HPV and
demographic and behavioral variables
among sexually active females aged 18
to 59 years. We eliminated variables in
a backward fashion that did not meet
the criteria of P.05 by Satterthwaite
adjusted F test at each step. Any par-
ticipants with missing data on vari-
ables included in the multivariate
analysis were excluded. Once all vari-
ables in the model were statistically
significant at the P.05 level, all pair-
wise interactions were evaluated and
retained only if the overall P value for
the interaction was .05. Goodness of
fit for the final step of the model was
assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow
Satterthwaite adjusted F test.
RESULTS
HPV DNA Prevalence Overall
and by Age
From 2003-2004, 2026 vaginal swab
specimens from female NHANES par-
ticipants aged 14 to 59 years were col-
lected. Of the 1921 adequate speci-
mens, 26.8% (95% CI, 23.3%-30.9%)
were positive for any HPV DNA. Using
2000 Census data, this corresponds to
24.9 million females in this age range
with prevalent HPV infection.
Prevalence of HPV infection was
highest among females aged 20 to 24
years (44.8%; 95% CI, 36.3%-55.3%);
overall prevalence among females aged
14 to 24 years was 33.8% (95% CI,
28.6%-40.0%) (TABLE 1). There was a
statistically significant trend for in-
creasing HPV prevalence with each year
of age from 14 to 24 years (P.001),
which was followed by a nonsignifi-
cant gradual decline in HPV preva-
lence through 59 years (P=.06).
When the analysis was restricted to
sexually active females, the preva-
lence of HPV was still highest among
those aged 20 to 24 years. Among sexu-

ally active females, HPV prevalence was
39.6% (95% CI, 32.9%-47.8%) for 14
to 19 years, 49.3% (95% CI, 40.7%-
59.6%) for 20 to 24 years, 27.8% (95%
CI, 21.7%-35.7%) for 25 to 29 years,
27.3% (95% CI, 20.2%-36.8%) for 30
to 39 years, 23.9% (95% CI, 18.8%-
30.5%) for 40 to 49 years, and 20.2%
(95% CI, 14.6%-27.8%) for 50 to 59
years.
Prevalence of High-Risk, Low-Risk,
and Specific Types
The overall prevalence of high- and low-
risk HPV types was 15.2% and 17.8%,
respectively. Prevalences of both low-
risk and high-risk HPV types were high-
est in females aged 20 to 24 years
(FIGURE 1). There was a statistically sig-
nificant difference between low- and
high-risk HPV types among females
aged 14 to 19 years and 50 to 59 years.
Prevalence of high-risk types de-
creased after 20 to 29 years, and preva-
lence of low-risk types plateaued after
30 to 39 years.
The most common HPV types de-
tected were HPV-62 (3.3%; 95% CI,
2.2%-5.1%) and HPV-84 (3.3%; 95%
CI,2.2%-5.1%),HPV-53(2.8%;95%CI,
2.1%-3.7%), and HPV-89 (2.4%; 95%
CI, 1.4%-4.3%) and HPV-61 (2.4%;
95% CI, 1.6%-3.8%) (FIGURE 2).
HPV-16 was detected in 1.5% (95% CI,
0.9%-2.6%) of females aged 14 to 59
years. There was no statistically signifi-
cant difference in the prevalence of
HPV-16 and the 13 more commonly de-
tected types, except for HPV-84 and
HPV-62. HPV-6 was detected in 1.3%
(95% CI, 0.8%-2.3%), HPV-11 in 0.1%
(95% CI, 0.03%-0.3%; relative
SE30%), and HPV-18 in 0.8% (95%
CI, 0.4%-1.5%) of female participants.
Most participants infected with HPV
(60.1%) had only 1 HPV type detected
(95% CI, 53.2%-67.9%); however,
23.9% had 2 types (95% CI, 18.3%-
31.3%) and 16% had 3 or more types
detected (95% CI, 12.0%-21.2%). Over-
all, HPV types 6, 11, 16, or 18 were de-
tected in 3.4% of the study partici-
pants, corresponding with 3.1 million
females with prevalent infection with
HPV types included in the quadriva-
lent HPV vaccine. Few participants
(0.10%) had both HPV types 16 and 18
and none had all 4 HPV vaccine types.
At least 1 of these 4 HPV types was de-
tected in 6.2% (95% CI, 3.8%-10.3%)
of females aged 14 to 19 years.
Factors Associated With HPV DNA
Detection
The variables associated with HPV DNA
detection that were significant in the bi-
variate analysis were age, race, pov-
erty index, education, marital status,
and sexual behavior (Table 1 and
TABLE 2).
HPV DNA was detected in 5.2% of
females who reported never having had
sex (Table 2). In an unweighted analy-
sis, 88% of these females were be-
tween 14 to 19 years, and the remain-
ing 12% were 40 to 49 years. Two of
these participants were also positive for

The final multivariate model dem-
onstrated that age younger than 25
years, marital status, and increasing
numbers of recent or lifetime sex part-
ners were independently associated
with HPV detection (TABLE 3). Race/
ethnicity was not significant in the mul-
tivariate model. Increasing numbers of
recent sex partners was more strongly
associated with HPV detection than was
lifetime sex partners. No pairwise in-
teractions among the variables in the

COMMENT
Prevalence of HPV DNA in a represen-
tative sample of US females aged 14 to
59 years was 26.8%, with the highest
prevalence (44.8%) among women aged
20 to 24 years. The overall prevalence
of HPV among females aged 14 to 24
years was 33.8%. This prevalence cor-
responds with 7.5 million females with
HPV infection, which is higher than the
previous estimate of 4.6 million preva-
lent HPV infections among females in
this same age group in the United
States.1 The overall prevalences of high-
risk HPV types 16 and 18 were 1.5%
(95% CI, 0.9%-2.6%) and 0.8% (95%
CI, 0.4%-1.5%), respectively.
We found that the prevalence of
HPV infection increased from 14 years
through 24 years, and then decreased
at older ages. Most evaluations in the
United States have found that the
prevalence of any HPV was highest in
the younger age groups (20 years).
Manhart et al6 in a population-based
assessment of sexually active 18- to
25-year-old women using a urine
sample found the prevalence of HPV-6
or HPV-11 to be 2.2%, and the preva-
lence of HPV-16 or HPV-18 to be
7.8%. Among sexually active 18- to
25-year-old women in our study, the
prevalence of HPV-6 or HPV-11
(2.2%; 95% CI, 1.0%-5.0%; relative SE
30%) was similar to that found by
Manhart et al,6 and the prevalence of
HPV-16 or HPV-18 (3.5%; 95% CI,
1.8%-6.7%; relative SE 30%) was
lower. These differences may be due
to differences in the type of test used
for the HPV detection, differences in
the study population, or both.

We found the overall prevalence of
HPV-16 to be low and that other HPV
types were more prevalent. In most
other studies, HPV-16 has been found
to be the most prevalent type, al-
though prevalence varied based on the
population evaluated. Population-
based studies outside the United States
have found lower prevalence of HPV-16
than clinic-based studies have.28 It is
possible that our cervicovaginal assess-
ment using the self-collected vaginal
swabs was more likely to detect HPV
types not related to cervical infection.
Castle et al28 hypothesized that there is
tropism of some phylogenetic group-
ings (A3/A4/A15) to the vagina. In our
assessment, the most common types de-
tected were HPV-84 and HPV-62, both
in the A3 phylogenetic grouping. Man-
hart et al6 found HPV types 84 and 62
were also frequently detected in urine
samples among females aged 18 to 25
years.
Independent risk factors for HPV
DNA detection in our analysis in-
cluded sexual behavior (number of sex
partners in the last year, number of life-
time sex partners) and demographic
variables, including young age and
marital status, consistent with risk fac-
tors for HPV detection found in other
studies.
HPV DNA was detected in approxi-
mately 5% of women in our study who
reported never having had sex. In an
unweighted analysis of these women,
we found that most were young in age
and some had other sexually transmit-
ted infections, suggesting their self-
reported sexual history may not be ac-
curate. Genital HPV is primarily
associated with sexual intercourse;
however, 1 study3 found that nonpen-
etrative sexual contact, such as genital-
genital contact, could also result in HPV
transmission. A detailed sexual his-
tory was not collected, therefore, we
could not evaluate specific types of
sexual contact.
The 84.9% response rate (number of
collected swabs/number of eligible
swabs=2026/2387) for vaginal swab
collection in our study suggests that the
self-collected swabs were a feasible and
effective method for HPV DNA detec-
tion in a large survey. Previous assess-
ments of the acceptability of self-
collected vaginal swabs found this
collection method to be more accept-
able than specimens collected by health
care professionals.29,30 Evaluations have
also demonstrated a high correlation of
HPV DNA detection, both high-risk and
low-risk types, in self-collected swabs
compared with swabs collected by
health care professionals.31-35 There are
few studies comparing correlation of
specific HPV types. Available studies on
type-specific correlations suggest dif-
ferent types may be detected from these
specimens, although a strong correla-
tion, at least in 1 study, existed for HPV
types 6, 11, 16, and 18.35 There are no
evaluations in the general US popula-
tion using self-collected swabs preclud-
ing a direct comparison of our data with
those from other studies.
There were several limitations to
our study. Nonresponders were sig-
nificantly different from responders
by certain demographic characteris-
tics (race, age, country of birth, and
ever had sex) and this could bias
prevalence estimates; however, as
noted, evaluations of the weighted
prevalence estimates taking the non-
responders into consideration did
not substantially change our point
estimates. A self-collected cervico-
vaginal sample was obtained, which
may not detect the same HPV types
as cervical mucosa samples obtained
by health care professionals. Also,
HPV DNA point prevalence will most
certainly underestimate cumulative
incidence as many infections clear9,10;
this assessment only measures cur-
rent infection and does not indicate
past exposure to HPV. A study in a
previous NHANES sample found
overall HPV-16 seroprevalence in
females to be 17.9%, with the preva-
lence peaking in 20- to 29-year-
olds.36 Seroprevalence provides a bet-
ter estimate of cumulative exposure.
The difference between the seroprev-
alence found in that study and the
current DNA prevalence in our study
reflects the high clearance of HPV
infections. This assessment, as all

assessments of HPV DNA, could not
determine if the HPV detected was
from the participant or a partner, or
if it represented active infection.
Finally, we had only 2 years of data;
the distribution of HPV types may
change with additional years of data
and a larger sample. We did not pre-
sent demographic and behavioral fac-
tors associated with HPV vaccine
type infection because the analysis
was limited to subgroups with preva-
lence estimates in which the relative
SE was 30% or less; a relative SE of
more than 30% means that the SE is
quite large relative to the estimate
and hence considered unreliable.
CONCLUSION
Our study provides the first national es-
timate of prevalent HPV infection
among females aged 14 to 59 years in
the United States. Overall, HPV preva-
lence was high (26.8%), and preva-
lence was highest among females aged
20 to 24 years. Our data indicate that
the burden of prevalent HPV infection
among women was higher than previ-
ous estimates. However, the preva-
lence of HPV vaccine types was rela-
tively low.
