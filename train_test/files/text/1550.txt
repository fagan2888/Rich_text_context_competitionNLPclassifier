Abstract
Background: Historical studies of news media have suggested an association between reporting and increased drug abuse.
Period effects for substance use have been documented for different classes of legal and illicit substances, with the
suspicion that media publicity may have played major roles in their emergence. Previous analyses have drawn primarily
from qualitative evidence; the temporal relationship between media reporting volume and adverse health consequences
has not been quantified nationally. We set out to explore whether we could find a quantitative relationship between media
reports about prescription opioid abuse and overdose mortality associated with these drugs. We assessed whether
increases in news media reports occurred before or after increases in overdose deaths.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Our ecological study compared a monthly time series of unintentional poisoning deaths
involving short-acting prescription opioid substances, from 1999 to 2005 using multiple cause-of-death data published by
the National Center for Health Statistics, to monthly counts of English-language news articles mentioning generic and
branded names of prescription opioids obtained from Google News Archives from 1999 to 2005. We estimated the
association between media volume and mortality rates by time-lagged regression analyses. There were 24,272 articles and
30,916 deaths involving prescription opioids during the seven-year study period. Nationally, the number of articles
mentioning prescription opioids increased dramatically starting in early 2001, following prominent coverage about the
nonmedical use of OxyContin. We found a significant association between news reports and deaths, with media reporting
preceding fatal opioid poisonings by two to six months and explaining 88% (p,0.0001, df 78) of the variation in mortality.
Conclusions/Significance: While availability, structural, and individual predispositions are key factors influencing substance
use, news reporting may enhance the popularity of psychoactive substances. Albeit ecological in nature, our finding
suggests the need for further evaluation of the influence of news media on health. Reporting on prescription opioids
conforms to historical patterns of news reporting on other psychoactive substances.

Introduction
Historical studies of news media have suggested a strong
association between media reporting on psychoactive substances
and a subsequent increase in their use and abuse. Period effects for
drug abuse have been documented for different classes of legal and
illicit substances, with extensive research documenting the role
that media publicity may have played in their emergence,
regression and public perception [1,2]: amphetamine [3] in the
1950s; glue sniffing [4] and methamphetamine [3] in the 1960s;
fentanyl [5], crack and cocaine [6­11] in the 1980s; metham-
phetamine [3], methcathinone [5], RohypnolH [5], and ecstasy
[5,12,13] in the 1990s; and OxyContinH [14] and other
prescription opioids [15,16] in this decade.
The roles that news media may play in drawing awareness to
national drug problems has been the subject of scrutiny in
sociology for decades. Many researchers have examined the
content of news media coverage of psychoactive substance use. In
their commentary on the role of media in shaping ideas about
health Caburnay et al. (2003) point out that, ``news media are an
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 11 | e7758
important and influential part of the social environment, calling
attention to certain issues by the amount and nature of their
coverage.'' [17] After reviewing decades of public opinion surveys
regarding drug policy, Blendon and Young (1998) concluded that
the American public's views ``are largely shaped by the content
and magnitude of media coverage on the issue.''[18] Despite these
observations and the extensive qualitative analysis of the manner
in which drug use is covered by the media, there has been little
attempt to quantify the relationship between media reporting and
drug use outcomes using epidemiologic techniques. Recent
advances in technology allow us to harness the electronic news
sources to uncover the temporal relationship between media
reporting and substance abuse indicators to lend support to
qualitative analysis conducted by others about reporting on drug
use [4,5,8­10,19,20].
While availability and individual predispositions influence
initiation of substance use, elements of the social environment,
including news reporting may enhance the popularity of
psychoactive substances among potential nonmedical users and
foster demand. Even derogatory media reports may raise
awareness and pique the curiosity of those inclined to experimen-
tation. Some researchers have suggested that fear-based media
messaging may contribute to decreases in drug use [21], but the
temporal sequencing of drug problems and media reporting has
not been well documented. If news articles only reported on
already existing problems, and were a result and not a cause of
adverse drug events, we would expect to first see an increase in
substance abuse indicators, followed by an increase in the number
of media reports mentioning the drugs. Alternatively, if media
reports precede a substance abuse indicator, there may be a more
complex relationship in which the media somehow influence drug
abuse trends [2]. Here, we sought to quantify the temporal
association between media reports and opioid-related mortality.
Methods
Mortality Data
We generated a monthly time series of unintentional poisoning
deaths involving short-acting prescription opioid substances
(including modified-release analgesics) in the US, from 1999 to
2005. We used multiple cause-of-death data published by the
National Center for Health Statistics, accessed from the depository
at the National Bureau of Economic Research. Unintentional
prescription opioid poisoning deaths were identified using ICD-10
codes for poisonings of unintentional and undetermined intent
(X42, X44, Y12), where short-acting pharmaceutical opioid
substances were specified (T40.2, T40.4), and aggregated by
month. Prescription opioid mortality data were used in this
analysis because they are the only publicly available data source
related to drug abuse with monthly data and national coverage.
We limited the analysis to these years because more recent
mortality data were not available at the start of the analysis, and
previous years used a different coding classification for mortality
which could have introduced an additional source of bias. We
calculated population rates using mid-year Census estimates for
each study year.
News Media Data
Monthly counts of news articles mentioning generic and
branded names of prescription opioids were obtained from Google
News Archives from 1999­2005, accessed on October 16th, 2008.
Media reports were retrieved using automated Perl scripts with
manual verification [22]. Google News Archives provides access to
English language print news media from about 25,000 sources.
Month and year of publication and headlines were extracted for
any article whose body text contained the generic or branded
name of short-acting opioid substances available for outpatient use
in the United States (from Food and Drug Administration's Orange
Book): buprenorphine, codeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone,
meperidine, propoxyphene, oxycodone, and tramadol. Morphine was
excluded because a preliminary review indicated articles mention-
ing morphine almost exclusively described pain management
(without abuse) or arts reviews (e.g., the name of the band
Morphine, storyline in the major motion picture La Vie en Rose).
Morphine acted as a synecdoche for all opioid painrelievers used
within a medical context. In order to establish a denominator to
calculate rates of news articles, we established counts of all print
news articles containing the word the in a given month.
We examined the subject material of articles which gave rise to
each major peak in the time series of media reports by returning to
the original news outlets. We present data on one branded
(OxyContin) and one generic (fentanyl) opioid to demonstrate the
types of events which drive news media volume. Articles were read
and assessed by multiple authors for each time point. An
automated text mining approach to classify articles was pilot
tested, but is beyond the scope of this paper, and will be the subject
of a future publication from our group. Results from manual
article classification were used to identify the subjects of articles
related to peaks in news volume.
Statistical Analysis
We computed time-lagged correlations between the mortality
time series and print news reports about short-acting opioid
substances, compiled as described above. We used 5-month
moving averages to smooth each time series, and performed lag
regression to estimate the association between media volume and
mortality rates. We assessed the relative predictive value of the
time-lagged media data streams by fitting generalized linear
models to mortality counts, assuming a Poisson distribution. We
ran separate models where the predictor was the media time series,
shifted up to 6 months after or 6 months before mortality. Overall
model fit for each of the Poisson regression models was calculated
by comparing deviance statistics with their asymptotic chi-square.
The value of each lagged media series in predicting mortality was
determined by calculating the proportion of the deviance
explained, similar to the R2. Statistical models were run using
Proc Genmod in SAS v9.1.2 (Cary, North Carolina).
Given the important geographic differences in opioid abuse in
the United States [23] we also examined the state-level distribution
of opioid-related news. Because of its dominant impact on news
volume and recent concern [14,24], we chose to only search the
word OxyContin in conjunction with a mention of one of the 50
state names or the District of Columbia in the headline, body text
or media source name. The natural language processing methods
used in this analysis have been detailed elsewhere [25]. For the
denominator, we found all articles for that year that contained the
state name. We repeated this analysis for each year from 2000 to
2006 in order to calculate the state level proportions of news
devoted to OxyContin. Graphical display of time-series maps are
presented.
Mortality data used in this study were publicly available and de-
identified, and the research was exempt from institutional review
board oversight.
Results
There were 30,916 deaths involving short-acting prescription
opioids during the seven year study period, including deaths from

toxic exposure to extended-release formulations containing short-
acting opioid substances. Monthly short-acting pharmaceutical
opioid-related mortality increased from 0.81 deaths per 1,000,000
US population in January of 1999 to 1.90 deaths per 1,000,000
US population in December of 2005. We also identified 24,272
articles mentioning prescription opioids among a total of
31,651,000 articles queried in Google News Archives from
1999­2005 (0.08% of all articles).
Over time the most common articles were about individuals
arrested for drug selling possession (diversion) and those articles
raising general concerns about prescription opioid abuse, depen-
dence and poisoning, as has been noted by others [24]. Manual
review of stories about prescription opioids revealed that time
series peaks in article volume were related to celebrities using
drugs, federal government hearings, and pharmaceutical company
actions (Figure 1), similar to what was documented for coverage on
cocaine use during the mid-1980s [26]. Medical licensing decisions
censuring health care workers, pharmacy robberies and recovery
from drug dependence less commonly contributed to peaks in
news volume, but were reported at consistent rates over time (data
not shown). Articles about prescription opioid overdoses tended to
report on arrests and criminal proceedings against those accused of
being involved in providing the drugs to the decedents, including
doctors, drug dealers and family members. Overdose articles
tended to focus on younger decedents, despite the average age for
prescription opioid poisoning being in the late 30 s in the United
States during this time period [23]. Peaks were also generated due
to spurious issues involving opioids, such as the use of fentanyl by
Russian authorities to end a hostage situation in a Moscow theatre
in October 2002 and illicitly-manufactured fentanyl-tainted heroin
in the Summer of 2006 (Figure 1).
The number of articles mentioning prescription opioids
increased by 149% from January 2001 to July 2001, following
prominent national coverage about the nonmedical use of
OxyContinH (Figure 2). We found news media to be a significant
predictor of mortality (p,0.0001, df 78), even after adjusting for
effects of seasonality and linear trending. We performed lagged-
regression analysis to quantify a temporal relationship between
mortality and new reporting (Figure 3). News reports preceded
poisoning deaths with peak correlation at 2­6 months prior to
mortality, accounting for 88% of the variability.
We found important differences in the geographic distribution
of OxyContin-related news articles (Figure 4). Prior to 2001 when
the focus on articles about OxyContin was on pharmaceutical
earnings and pain management, reporting was highest in New
Jersey, a state with a high concentration of pharmaceutical
Figure 1. Monthly rates of news volume mentioning prescription opioids, 1998­2006, United States. Monthly print news volume
mentioning prescription opioids was driven by different factors over time. Government and industry actions and celebrity involvement tended to
produce peaks in the time series. A general pattern was observed of regional reports of abuse problems followed by national coverage, for
OxyContin. By comparison, fentanyl was reported on less frequently than OxyContin. Two peaks in fentanyl articles were due to issues not related to
pharmaceutical fentanyl formulations (weaponized gas and illicitly manufactured powder), suggesting the need for categorization of articles based
on content. Abbreviations: Apr, April; DC, District of Columbia; Feb, February; FDA, Food and Drug Administration; Jan, January; Jul, July; KY,

companies and businesses providing financial and supporting
services to the industry. In 2001­2003, increases in the proportion
of news articles about OxyContin expanded throughout the
Appalachian region and New England, with foci eventually
developing in Florida, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. After 2003,
reporting became more homogenous with substantial reporting
throughout the country. By 2006, New Jersey had the highest rates
as articles about abuse- and tamper-resistant opioid pain reliever
formulations became prominent. Similar cycles have of the media
reporting on industry attempts to create less abuseable forms have
been noted by others [4].
Discussion
Our finding that articles about prescription opioids routinely
preceded overdose deaths associated with the same medications
supports previous research, but we cannot draw a causal
conclusion from our study alone, as other researchers have
pointed out [12]. In conjunction with the work of others
[2,3,8,9,26], our findings support previous hypotheses about role
of the news media in perpetuating public beliefs about psychoac-
tive substance use, and the potential role the media may have in
drug use trends. We document that reporting on prescription
opioids in the 2000s followed strikingly similar patterns as for
drugs in previous decades, and we provide a quantitative
argument supporting the often-repeated demand for journalistic
standards for reporting on substance use issues.
The pattern of news media outlets reinforcing each other to
arrive at a general held belief has been noted for stories about
epidemics of other drugs of abuse [3,5,8,9,27 [cited in 11]]].
This phenomenon is termed intermedia convergence by Reese and
Danielian (1989), and has been recently noted to be accelerated
in the current more rapid and internet-influenced news cycle
[28]. The early emergence of problems as reported by the news
media about northern New England and Appalachia may in part
explain the sustained focus on these regions (see [29]), despite
national level data suggesting a broader ranging problem [30].
In a recent review of media portrayals of drug use, Talyor (2008)
cites extensive sociological evidence to advance the theory that
news reports have focused on ``outsiders,'' socially marginalized
classes of people, often racial minorities, going as far back as the
mid-1800s in the United States [see also: 19]. In this paper
we document that with prescription opioids in the current
decade, the outsiders appear to be rural residents, with a
particular focus on Appalachia and northern New England, as
shown in Figure 4.
We posit that there may be co-linear relationships between the
medical use of a prescription opioid, medical consequence from the
use and abuse of the product, the public attention devoted to the
topic, and news media reports. Co-linearity does not prove
causation, however, and our intention in conducting this research
is to advance the dialogue about the potential interconnectedness of
these seemingly independent phenomena. While news articles may
contribute indirectly to illicit demand for short-acting prescription
opioids, there are many complex factors that influence poisoning
mortality and are poorly understood: improper marketing, lax

mortality, 1999­2005, United States. Monthly print news media
volume mentioning short-acting prescription opioid substances closely
tracked closely with poisoning mortality due to those medications. Print
news media articles consistently preceded mortality by a few months.
Month and year of publication and headlines were extracted for any
article whose body text contained the generic or branded name of
short-acting opioid substances available for outpatient use in the
United States during the study period: buprenorphine, codeine, fentanyl,
hydrocodone, hydromorphone, meperidine, propoxyphene, oxycodone,
and tramadol. Morphine was excluded because a preliminary review
indicated articles mentioning morphine almost exclusively described
pain management (without abuse) or arts reviews. Poisoning deaths
were identified using a combination of International Classification of
Disease 10th Edition (ICD-10) codes, see text, to identify deaths
involving short-acting opioid substances. Data on methadone are not
presented due to difficulties in distinguishing deaths from its two
indications (addiction, pain) using ICD-10 codes, however inclusion of
methadone did not significantly alter results (data not shown). Time
series were smoothed using 5-month moving averages.

analysis we assessed the relative predictive value of the time-lagged

counts, assuming a Poisson distribution. We ran separate models where
the predictor was the media time series, shifted up to 6 months after or
6 months before mortality. Overall model fit for each of the Poisson
regression models was calculated by comparing deviance statistics with
their asymptotic chi-square. The value of each lagged media series in
predicting mortality was determined by calculating the proportion of
the deviance explained, similar to the R2. The greatest percent of
variation explained was highest in scenarios where the news media
preceded mortality.

prescribing standards, patient and health care worker errors,
breaches of the pharmaceutical supply chain, the influence of social
networks, individual physical comorbidities, intervention programs
and fear of accessing emergency medical care.
Clinical experience leads us to believe that drug use and
overdose have multiple influences at the individual, social and
genetic levels. The same multi-factorial influences may make
drug abuse stories attractive subjects for journalists, combined
with the fundamental issues crossing sociodemographic lines. It
has also been noted that ``media portrayals of the consumption
and effects of alcohol do not comprise a neutral, scientific reality
but rather signify a network of social knowledge, value systems,
and symbols,'' with the same likely occurring for other substances
[31]. There may be public expectation for coverage, and while
predictable, the media aren't necessarily acting beyond the pale
of their professional responsibilities. Yet, there is little formal
guidance to journalists for appropriate coverage of this sensitive
topic. The editors of PLoS point out that ``today's health
reporters may have been covering crime last week and politics the
week before,'' [32] and media reporting of medical news has long
been criticized [33]. At the intersection of crime, health and
politics, news reporting about drug abuse reflects a complex
interaction of social factors, with little guidance as to how these
issues should be covered. A recent article by PLoS Medicine
editors on news coverage of suicides in the military reminds us
that ``reporters have a choice about how they frame stories about
mental illness'' [34]. While individual-level influence of news
reporting cannot be deduced from surveillance-oriented studies,
and require more intensive analyses [35,36], our results suggest
the need for a thorough evaluation of this topic, with an eye
towards ethical standards that promote responsible journalism
[12]. These standards could be analogous to guidelines for stories
on suicide [37­40], where the role of the news media in copycat
suicides has been well documented [39,41­43], although some
researchers believe the link to be less than definitive [44].
Furthermore, our study suggests that there may be opportunity to
harness news reports as an early warning indicator of emerging
drug problems, similar recent work in infectious disease
surveillance [25].
In support of the long-standing need for journalistic standards,
we identified certain articles that amounted to inadvertent
endorsements of prescription drug abuse; while dangers associ-
ated with drug abuse were mentioned in later paragraphs of
articles, the opening lines presented an enticing scenario. A 2000
Portland Press Herald article opened with: ``Euphoria envelopes
your body in a warm, cozy hug. Problems dissolve. Limbs tingle.
Life feels perfect. These are the sensations that drug addict
Christopher Coughlin says he felt using OxyContin, a highly
addictive opiate that is sweeping Maine, from the streets of South
Portland to the rural communities of Washington County.'' [45]
Strikingly, Breecher (1972) noted nearly identical language in a
Newsweek article from 1962, suggesting a longstanding cyclical
pattern in the way news about drug abuse is presented: ``You're
in outer space. You're Superman. You're floating in air, seeing
double, riding next to God. It's Kicksville. Are these the fantasies
of narcotics addicts on a pop? No. More disturbingly, these
hopped-up reactions are those of teenagers hooked on goofballs,
model airplane glue, and cough medicine. Across the nation,
police last week reported case after case of this alarming trend.''
[4,46] The similarity of language goes beyond semantics; it
suggests a consistent mindset and approach to reporting about
substance use that has not changed substantially in at least four
decades, if not longer [47].
Our findings are consistent with findings from previous cycles of
drug abuse concern. At the height of reporting on cocaine during
the summer of 1986, Merriam (1989) found that 5% of space in
national media were devoted to drug issues, starting at less than
1% in the start of that year [8]. By using electronic news sources,
we were able to expand the analytic space to include local and
regional print news media. Reflecting the greater volume and
Figure 4. Rates of OxyContin print news media mentions in the United States, 1999­2006, by state. Print news media articles showed a
progression from localized reporting, to national attention and eventual regression between 1999 and 2006, based on an analysis where articles were
geotagged based on the US state which the article was describing or was published in, see text for methodology. OxyContin problems were first
described in 2001 with particular focus on the Appalachian region and New England. Between 2001 and 2003, there was a sharp increase in articles
about OxyContin published about Florida, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The highest state-level rates of OxyContin news articles were in 2001. After
2003, reporting became more homogenous with substantial reporting throughout the country. Media attention on OxyContin started to subside
soon afterwards, with a return to localized reporting in 2005. By 2006, New Jersey had the highest rates, as articles about abuse- and tamper-resistant
formulations in development become prominent; New Jersey has a large concentration of pharmaceutical manufacturers and many of these articles
were from financial news sources describing attempts to develop formulations that would be less prone to tampering. The geo-temporal spread of
news reports about OxyContin mirror the experiences of previous cycles of drug abuse panics in the United States.

diversification of news media outlets in the 2000s, we found that
only 0.08% of news volume involved prescription opioids. While
we cannot make a direct comparison between previous work and
our analysis, new media will have to be considered in future
analyses. Print news media articles serve as a measureable proxy
for other forms of media that may also mention prescription
opioids. In today's rich multimedia environment competing and
synergistic influences of multiple sources of information need to be
assessed systematically, and future research may well focus on
blogs and other electronic news sources. An analysis of internet
comments about news reports of adolescent suicides suggested the
strong influence of the style of reporting and attitudes about
mental health [48]. Hawton and colleagues (1999) noted a short-
term increase in patients presenting for intentional drug overdoses
after the broadcast of a popular television drama depicting drug
self-poisoning [49]. Basic health psychology research is needed to
guide further efforts in this area.
We compared print news media articles to unintentional and
undetermined intent poisoning mortality because vital statistics are
the only publicly available data source with information on
substance use disorders that has national coverage and can be
analyzed on a monthly basis. Data from vital statistics reports are
known to have limitations [50­52], with particular fears of
underreporting. Medical examiners and coroners in the United
States do not have standardized assessment and attribution
procedures for suspected drug poisoning deaths. In addition,
acute poisonings due to patients' medication dosing errors with
potent opioids would be classified the same as a fatal opioid
poisonings from drug abuse under ICD-10 coding. It is unknown
what proportion of the deaths observed were from each type of
exposure (and what the overlap may be), but deaths from medical
errors involving specific prescription opioid pain relievers have
resulted in nationwide alerts from the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration [53,54]. In order to address this problem we conducted
sensitivity analyses using different combinations of ICD-10 codes
representing wider and narrower definitions, such as including
mental health codes as has been suggested by others [52]. While
the absolute number of poisoning fatalities fluctuated with the
different definitions, the proportional change appeared to be
nearly constant over time, resulting in similar results in lag
regression analysis. We do not present these results here for the
sake of brevity.
Another possible explanation for part of the observed
correlation is diagnostic suspicion bias, that medical examiners
more carefully screened for opioid poisonings in deaths of
uncertain cause, after they themselves were exposed the media
reports about overdose, or concerns expressed in the medical
literature. This type of response has not been noted for medical
examiners and drug overdoses in the literature, but remains
plausible. As our research team has described elsewhere [23], the
proportion of unintentional poisoning deaths in which a narcotic
was not specified decreased slightly in metropolitan areas between
1999 and 2003, and increased slightly in non-metropolitan areas.
However it has been noted that voluntary reporting to the Food
and Drug Administration's spontaneous adverse event reporting
system increased following publicized problems with adverse
events for pharmaceutical medications and devices [55­57]. To
what extent this introduces bias in our analysis is unclear.
While previous generations of researchers have examined the
question of the news media and substance use reporting, much of
the findings have been sequestered to the sociology literature and
have focused on qualitative analysis of media content. Few
studies have attempted to link media data with information on
drug use trends in a quantitative manner with temporal and
geographic specificity. Substance use disorders have become
increasingly medicalized in the last two decades (i.e., the
``chronic relapsing brain disease'' model), and pain has been
more systematically assessed and aggressively treated with
outpatient pharmacotherapies. Simultaneously there has been a
profusion of the types of media involved in reporting news.
However, biomedical science research has paid limited attention
to the social context in which drug use problems and pain are
perceived on a community level and what role mass media play,
especially electronic sources. Returning to Blendon and Young
(1998), ``In the future, if health professionals want to change the
direction of Americans' beliefs on particular drug policies they
will have to devote significant resources to gaining media
attention for their views.'' We agree with them, but feel that
journalism standards would also be beneficial. Perhaps the next
``drug epidemic'' will benefit from a more balanced and public
health approach to reporting, but it requires immediate
interdisciplinary action.
