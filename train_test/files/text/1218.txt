The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES-III) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recorded data
on the urinary concentrations of 12 chemicals (analytes), which were either pesticides or their metabolites, that represent exposure to certain pesticides, in
urine samples collected from 1988 to 1994 from a cohort of 978 volunteer subjects, aged 20­59 years. We have used each subject's urinary creatinine
concentration and their individual daily creatinine excretion rate (g/day) computed from their age, gender, height and weight, to estimate their daily
excretion rate in mg analyte/kg/day. We discuss the mechanisms of excretion of the analytes and certain assumptions needed to compute the equivalent
daily dietary intake (mg/kg/day) of the most likely parent pesticide compounds for each excreted analyte. We used literature data on the average amount
of parent compound ingested per unit amount of the analyte excreted in the urine, and compared these estimated daily intakes to the US EPA's reference
dose (RfD) values for each of those parent pesticides. A Johnson SB
distribution (four-parameter lognormal) was fit to these data to estimate the national
distribution of exclusive exposures to these 12 parent compounds. Only three such pesticides had a few predicted values above their RfD (lindane 1.6%;
2,4-dichlorophenol 1.3%; chlorpyrifos 0.02%). Given the possibility of a subject's dietary intake of a pesticide's metabolites incorporated into treated
food, our results show that few, if any, individuals in the general US population aged 20­59 years and not employed in pesticide application were likely to
have exceeded the USEPA RfD for these parent compounds during the years studied.

Introduction
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Study
(NHANES) is an ongoing program administered by the
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In each phase,
it represents a stratified random sample of the entire US
population, with certain groups oversampled in order to
increase the precision of estimates for that group. All persons
chosen were assigned a sampling weight related to their inverse
probability of selection. All subjects chosen who agreed to
participate completed a questionnaire, and were invited to
undergo a complete physical examination. In the Third
NHANES (NHANES-III), conducted from 1988 to 1994, a
subset of the examined subjects, aged 20­59 years, volunteered
to provide a urine sample for analysis of selected pesticide
residues or their metabolites as an indication of exposure to
these pesticides (US Department of Health and Human
Services (USDHHS), 1999). This subset was a nonrepresenta-
tive convenience sampling of the survey participants; however,
the demographic representation of the subset was diverse.
The usage of a creatinine correction for urinary concentra-
tion data has long been controversial in the pesticide
exposure literature. This paper reviews the data generated
from these analyses performed by the National Center for
Environmental Health (NCEH) at CDC, and suggests an

innovative means by which these urine data can be creatinine
corrected, interpreted and compared to reference doses
established by the US Environmental Protection Agency
(USEPA) to better characterize intake doses of concern for
human health. We also discuss the factors that can cause
these exposure-related values to be either an overestimation
or underestimation of actual dose received.
Method of creatinine correction
As a part of the NHANES-III study, CDC collected and
analyzed a spot sample of urine from a group of 978 adult
volunteer subjects for 12 analytes that represent exposure to
pesticides. A ``spot-sample'' is a void without a record of the
volume (DV) or the elapsed time in hours from the previous
void (Dt). Consequently, these pesticide analyses do not allow
extrapolation of the total mass of analyte measured (Dm) to a
daily excretion rate as either 24Dm/Dt or V Dm/DV, where V
is the expected daily urine volume excreted by the subject with
known age, gender and body mass, at that time of the year.
However, a correction using the creatinine (Cn) concentration
measured in the same samples can be used for this estimation,
as described in detail in a following section:
The CDC reported concentration data for 12 pesticide-
related analytes in units of micrograms of analyte per liter of
urine (mg/l) (Hill et al., 1995). Table 1 lists the analytes
(pesticide residues and metabolites) reported, the possible
parent pesticides of the metabolites, and their respective
reference doses (RfD). The RfD is an average daily intake
value over a lifetime thought to be acceptable, based upon
currently available animal toxicity studies. For some
pesticides, the analyte is the pesticide itself; for example,
2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). However, in most
cases, the analyte is a metabolite of the parent pesticide,
generally the primary metabolite.
Whereas detection of a pesticide in a urine sample above
the minimum detectable level (MDL) means that the subject
was exposed to that pesticide, a detectable urinary concen-
tration of a pesticide metabolite only indicates that the
subject was exposed to one or more of its parent pesticides, to
the metabolite itself, or to a pharmaceutical or other chemical
with the same metabolite. The numerical value of the analyte
concentration in mg/l is determined by several unknown
quantities which are discussed in detail below: (1) the
amounts of the parent pesticide(s) and their metabolites to
which the subject has been exposed; (2) the hydration status

or fluid intake of the subjects as evidenced in the dilution of
the urine; and (3) body chemistry.
Pesticide Intake
The presence of a detectable concentration of the analyte in
the urine of an NHANES-III participant only means that the
subject had been exposed through some unknown pathway
to the analyte, its parent pesticide, or another chemical
capable of producing the same metabolite. Furthermore, if
any given metabolite is also an environmental degradation
product, one cannot determine whether the exposure, in
whole or in part, was to the parent pesticide itself or to the
environmental degradate. Presence of the degradation
product in food may arise from reaction of the parent
pesticide due to thermal action during cooking or environ-
mental factors in the field where it was applied (e.g., by plant
or bacterial metabolism or through the action of moisture
and sunlight). For the organophosphate and carbamate
pesticides, the degradation product and the human metabo-
lite may be the same chemical. For the purpose of this
interpretation, we make the following assumptions:
(1) that the metabolite in the urine was derived solely from
exposure to the parent pesticide because the RfDs are
associated only with the parent pesticide, not the metabolite;
(2) that 100% of the pesticide dose was converted in vivo to
the metabolite (e.g., 100% of the chlorpyrifos dose was
converted to 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol) as no human
experimental data showing otherwise are available at this
time; and
(3) that 100% of the metabolite was excreted in urine
unless experimental data show otherwise, as is only the case
for 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (Nolan et al., 1984).
A spot sample gives no information as to the previous time
course of exposure, such as whether the exposure was a single
occurrence at some previous point in time or a variable daily
exposure. This is because each corresponding residue has a
low-concentration first-order half-life in the blood after
absorption that differs among individuals, depending in part
on the state of health of the kidney and liver enzyme
functions. For example, the subject could have been recently
exposed to a quantity sufficient to rapidly attain the
measured urinary value, or exposed to twice as much one
half-life previously, or four times as much two half-lives
previously. Alternatively, the subject could have been
exposed continuously to randomly varying daily amounts
that happened to result in the measured urinary concentra-
tion. From a single urine sample, it is impossible to
differentiate between the myriad numbers of potential
exposure profiles that could have produced that single
measured value.
Fluid Intake
The concentration of the analyte in the urine (mg/l) also
depends upon the quantity of fluid excreted by the kidneys.
Urine is created to excrete metabolic waste products to
prevent their build-up in the blood. If one has zero recent
fluid intake from food and drink, a minimal amount of fluid
is passed as a carrier vehicle. When food and drink are
consumed, the excess fluids increase the excreted fluid
volume, which decreases the concentration of the pesticide
or its metabolite in the urine. For example, diuresis (e.g.,
excessive liquid intake or hydration) may artificially reduce
the concentration of a pesticide or its metabolite in the urine,
but not the amount. Traditionally, urinary creatinine has
been used to correct for variable urine dilution (see discussion
below). In addition, urinary specific gravity and osmolality,
not recorded in the NHANES-III, have been used to help
correct for hydration status in spot urine samples, but such
methods have their own methodological uncertainties.
Body Chemistry
The rate of excretion of any solute from the blood into the
urine depends on several factors: passive glomerular filtration
of smaller molecules; facilitated secretion of larger molecules
through the renal tubules; and downstream reabsorption of
substances from renal tubules. Blood pressure (BP), diabetes,
renal disease, renal blood flow, urinary tract obstruction and
certain drugs affect the glomerular filtration rate and tubular
secretion rate differently, and these rates may vary widely
among individuals based upon their unique combination of
physiological parameters. It should be noted that the tubular
secretion processes are not strictly linear because an increase
of a tubularly-secreted pesticide analyte in the blood may not
always lead to an increased elimination. Each facilitated renal
transport system has a maximal rate, or transport maximum
(Tm), at which it can secrete a given solute with a molecular
size too large to allow passage through the glomerular filter
(Berkhin and Humphreys, 2001). In this process, a specific
carrier protein can bind to one of possibly several ligands,
such as a pesticide analyte. The bound chemicals transport
through the tubular walls, the ligand (analyte) is released into
the urine and, the protein returns to pick up another ligand.
Thus, the amount of a particular solute secreted by this
mechanism is approximately proportionate to the amount
present up to the Tm for that solute when no other competing
ligands are present. However, at higher concentrations, the
transport mechanism is saturated and there is no appreciable
increment in the transport rate because there are no more
carrier proteins available. Consequently, a spot urine sample
from a pesticide applicator who has had a high accidental
exposure leading to a large dosage of a mixture of pesticides
may provide misleading information, because there may be
competition for the limited number of transport proteins that
facilitate the process of tubular secretion for a given target
pesticide analyte.
For example, a subject who had a recent therapeutic dose
of penicillin may preferentially tubularly secrete the higher
concentration of penicillin rather than a lower concentration
Pesticide exposure by creatinine correction Mage et al.
Journal of Exposure Analysis and Environmental Epidemiology (2004) 14(6) 459
of a targeted pesticide analyte if they both required the same
carrier protein for their transport. Thus, a subject who may
have been exposed to a pesticide may be excreting a lesser
quantity of a target analyte because of the presence of a
competitive ligand. In NHANES-III, some subjects reported
taking medication, but did not specify which pharmaceuticals
they took. Also, they may have received significant exposures
to other environmental chemicals concurrent with or near the
time of exposure to the pesticides measured. Therefore,
recent use of medication or over the counter drugs or
concurrent environmental exposures may have impacted the
urinary concentration of the pesticide analytes of interest in
this study.
Finally, the transient factors that influence glomerular
filtration may be independent of the factors that influence
the rates of tubular secretion of pesticide analytes. Thus, the
elimination rate of a smaller molecule by glomerular
filtration does not parallel the secretion rate of those larger
analyte molecules excreted by tubular secretion. These
uncertainties may be partially resolved by use of the
subject's excretion of creatinine (Cn), a metabolic break-
down product of cellular creatine, under a specific set of
circumstances which might be related to a subject's normal
day-to-day exposure activities.
Creatinine Correction and Daily Excretion
Creatinine is a byproduct of skeletal muscle metabolism of
creatine, and is picked up continuously in the blood at a
relatively constant rate that is proportional to the muscle
mass of the individual. Additional increments of creatinine
occur from dietary red-meat intake and use of creatine as a
body-building supplement. Creatinine is cleared from the
blood plasma in the kidney at an approximately constant
rate, primarily by filtration through the glomerulus (B80%)
but a small amount is cleared by tubular secretion (B20%).
Conversely, pesticide or pesticide metabolite intake is a
transient process and it is not relatively constant from day to
day. For example, dietary intake may occur at different times
of the day and the pesticide content of the diet changes
markedly with the source and identity of the food eaten.
Inhalation and dermal contact with pesticides may occur
infrequently (e.g., once per month when pets are treated with
flea powder) or by chance when a subject visits a location that
was recently treated and touches a contaminated object.
Consequently, in the blood, a pesticide analyte concentration
fluctuates much more rapidly than the concentration of
creatinine which is normally kept in homeostasis.
Estimating the Dose of a Pesticide
When an analyte value is reported above the MDL, all we
know is that the subject has been exposed to it or its parent
compound, but we have absolutely no information on the
magnitude or timing of that previous exposure. If, and only
if, the subject has a relatively constant pesticide/metabolite
intake (mg/kg/day) and a constant dietary intake of red meat,
and the tubular secretion transport mechanism is not
saturated for the target pesticide or its metabolite, the body
will equilibrate and excrete in the urine approximately
constant amounts of that analyte and creatinine per day.
This set of circumstances may not exist in practice, and it
restricts our analysis to a set of conditions where a linear
tubular secretion process is taking place below the transport-
maximum concentrations where saturation makes the
clearance process zero-order non-linear. Human Tm values
for these analytes are not reported in the literature so we
cannot check the validity of our assumptions concerning
them. However, it is the only way that the NHANES-III
spot-sample data can be transformed from a urinary
concentration distribution (mg/l) into an exposure distribu-
tion (mg/kg/day) consistent with the RfD. This Cn correction
is not straightforward and its usage is controversial
(Dell'Orto et al., 1987). We have analyzed these data using
such a Cn correction as described below. It is a potentially
important addition to the body of knowledge for NHANES
data analysis and usage in risk assessment.
In practice, there is no consistent convention for use of Cn
to correct for the influence of hydration. For example, the
CDC did not report analyte data for adult urine samples in
NHANES-III, for which the Cn concentrations were below
0.3 g/l on the basis that it represented a highly dilute urine
sample (Hill et al., 1995; Adgate et al., 2001). The need for
an arbitrary choice of Cn cut off (a value of 0.30 g/l
acceptable and 0.29 g/l not acceptable) arises because
extremes of hydration and dehydration may cause different
changes in the rates of Cn and pesticide analyte excretion
(Alessio et al., 1985; Sata et al., 1995). Creatinine clearance
may also be affected by the renal functional status of the
subject, BP, pregnancy, drugs, exercise and red meat intake
(Neithardt et al., 2002). The ratio of pesticide or pesticide
metabolite clearance to Cn clearance may also be affected by
these same conditions. For example, Radha and Bessman
(1983) studied the effect of a 1-h intensive exercise on young
males placed on a meat-free diet. Immediately following the
exercise, Cn excretion rates decreased significantly. Bennett
and Wilkins (1993) found that their subjects' BP was
inversely related to their urinary Cn concentration. Bingham
and Cummings (1985) found that adding 260 g/day of
cooked meat to volunteers on a uniform metabolic diet raised
their Cn excretion rates by 23%. With fluctuations of these
quantities, the average coefficients of variation of sequential
daily Cn excretion in healthy adults were measured as 4%
over a short interval of 5 days (Cho and Yi, 1986) and 12%
over longer periods of 24­97 days (Greenblatt et al., 1976;
Waterlow, 1986). Given these caveats, we make the following
simplifying assumptions:
(1) There is no pathology involved, such as kidney failure or
a muscle-wasting disease;
Pesticide exposure by creatinine correction
Mage et al.

(2) The food intake is by typical omnivorous diet, with
neither excessive red meat consumption nor a strict
vegetarian diet.
(3) The ratio of pesticide analyte to Cn in a spot urine
sample represents an average value corresponding to a
complete 24-h total urine collection centered on the urine
sample interval.
(4) There is no pesticide metabolite intake by dietary
ingestion or any other route of exposure.
(5) The pesticide analyte's Transport Maximum is not
exceeded by any subject.
Results
Computation of Equivalent Pesticide Dose
The pesticide concentration in the blood represents an
integrated net effect of the subjects' previous exposures to
pesticides via ingestion (food, water, hand to mouth activity),
inhalation and dermal contacts. The health effects of such
exposures are usually a monotonic increasing function of the
systemic dose to the exposed person, in terms of micrograms
per kilogram body weight per day (mg/kg/day). Although
people may be exposed to a pesticide by inhalation and
dermal contact, we choose to report these data as if all the
pesticide/metabolite residue had a dietary origin, because the
USEPA Office of Pesticide Programs has established a set of
RfDs based primarily on dietary intake of their parent
pesticides. Thus, the person with the highest imputed dosage
in mg/kg/day is considered to have been the person with the
highest dietary exposure to the pesticide. As described
previously, each person excretes Cn at an approximately
constant rate on a daily basis, with homeostasis regulated by
the kidney. The effect of diuresis can also be corrected using
urine specific gravity (Araki, 1980; Vij and Howell, 1998)
that may be more accurate than the Cn method, but there are
also more physiological factors influencing specific gravity
than Cn (Trevisan, 1990).
Owing to the large interindividual variation in Cn
excretion, we chose to model this variability for each subject,
instead of using the same mean values for all subjects. There
are established norms for excretion of Cn on a daily basis, as
a function of age, gender and body surface area (BSA). The
BSA determines the daily heat loss that must be recovered
through cellular metabolism that generates the Cn that is
excreted by the urine. The BSA can be modeled as a function
of a person's age, gender, height and weight. An expression
for Cn production by ``normal'' males and females in the
NHANES-III can be developed because there is an age,
gender, height and weight recorded for each subject.
For BSA, the Mosteller (1987) formula is
BSAðm2Þ ¼ ½htðcmÞ Ã wtðkgÞ=36001=2 ð1Þ
For creatinine clearance (CnCl), ml plasma cleared/min/
1.73 m2 BSA, the Cockcroft and Gault (1976) formula is
Male CnCl ¼½ð140 À age½yearÞ Ã wtðkgÞ=
½72 Ã serum Cn ðmg=dlÞ
ð2aÞ
Female CnCl ¼0:85½ð140 À age½yearÞ Ã wtðkgÞ=
½72 Ã serum Cn ðmg=dlÞ
ð2bÞ
Therefore, the expected daily production of Cn is
Male: (mg Cn/dl serum) (ml plasma/min/1.73 m2 BSA)
¼ (140 À age [year]) * wt(kg)/72.
Simplifying, and substituting for BSA, the expected
micrograms Cn excreted per day is:
Male mg Cn=day ¼ 1:93að140 À age½yearÞ Ã wtðkgÞ1:5
Ã htðcmÞ0:5 ð3aÞ
Female mg Cn=day ¼1:64ð140 À age½yearÞ
Ã wtðkgÞ1:5 Ã htðcmÞ0:5
ð3bÞ
Using these formulae, an 80 kg man, 40 years old and 170 cm
tall, would have an expected Cn daily production of 1.78 g/
day, and a female of the same age, height and weight would
have a Cn production of 1.51 g/day.
The NHANES-III did not collect urine from children for
reporting pesticide analyte concentration data, so the
procedure we developed was not applied for estimating a
child's dose of pesticide. However, provided the appropriate
equations for children are used to predict a child's daily
creatinine clearance rate as a function of gender, age and
body surface area, the same technique is applicable (Shull
et al., 1978; Schwartz et al., 1987). Such equations for
children are not expected to be as accurate as those for adults
owing to rapidly changing metabolism and BSA from
infancy through puberty. We note that this proposed method
using urine concentration may be useful especially for infants
when it is difficult to collect a urine sample.
Computation of Total Exposure
The reported urinary analyte concentration in mg/l is
corrected to units of eliminated dose in mg/kg/day by the
Cn concentration. This makes sense if, and only if, the
subject is at steady state with respect to the analyte, and
the tubular secretion Tm is not exceeded. Then, the parent
pesticide intake in molar units would also be equal to the
target analyte excretion on a molar basis (assuming that
one molecule of parent pesticide metabolizes to one or
more different molecules of analyte). To correct the analyte
excretion for parent pesticide intake, that value must
be multiplied by the ratio of molecular weight pesticide to
the molecular weight of the analyte. However, not all analytes
are excreted in the urine, as some are soluble in the bile and are
eliminated in the feces. Also, some of the pesticide may be
awhere 1.93 ¼ (1440 min/day)(1000 mg/mg)/(72 year-kg/[mg/dl-ml/
min-1.73 m2])(3600 cm-kg/m4)0.5 (1.73 m2)(100 ml/dl)

excreted unchanged, so we may be neglecting that part of the
exposure. Thus, to account for the amount of pesticide
absorbed that is distributed, metabolized, or excreted differ-
ently, the amount of pesticide corresponding to the analyte
excreted also must be multiplied by the ratio of mol pesticide
intake to the known mol analyte excreted in urine from that
exposure. Nolan et al. (1984) reported an average of 1.47 mol
chlorpyrifos intake per mole TCPY excreted in the urine but
not all researchers make this correction (Buck et al., 2001).
Following our data analysis procedure, we can convert
each pair of values for urinary analyte concentration and Cn
concentration into a value of the virtual parent pesticide
exposure as a daily dietary intake in units of mg/kg/day that
would equilibrate to those measured values, subject to the
restrictive assumption of nonsaturation of tubular secretion.
This exposure can then be compared to an RfD established
by the EPA for the parent compound. There are uncertainty
factors involved in setting an RfD; so a value above the RfD,
but below the lowest observed effect level, does not
necessarily imply a health effect is likely.
Since some analytes have multiple parents, such as 3,5,6-
TCPY which is a metabolite of both chlorpyrifos and
chlorpyrifos-methyl, we have chosen the parent compound
that people not occupationally applying pesticides would
most likely be exposed to in normal daily activities. In the
case cited above, chlorpyrifos would be the most likely
compound the subject was exposed to, as chlorpyrifos methyl
is an insecticide used primarily in fumigation of stored grain.
Treatment of the Minimum Detectable Levels (MDL)
The MDL established by the CDC for the chlorpyrifos
metabolite 3,5,6-TCPY is 1 mg/l. Consequently, if a subject has
a oMDL residue of TCPYand a Cn concentration in the urine
of 0.3 g/dl, then the Cn corrected value would be (o1 mg/l)/
[(0.3 g/dl)(10 dl/l)] or o0.33 mg TCPY residue/g Cn. Owing
to the variable denominator Cn concentration, each o1 mg/l
MDL value translates into a different maximum possible mg
TCPY residue/g Cn that could not have been observed. To
analyze these MDL data, with the observed data, we use the
method of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to fit the
data set with the SB
probability model (Johnson, 1949), also
known as the four-parameter lognormal distribution.
Fitting the Censored SB
Distribution
The distribution of pesticide/metabolite residues in urine has
two asymptotic properties quite different from those of a
classic two-parameter lognormal distribution, where the
variable X is bounded as 0oXoN. These differences are
that subjects who were not recently exposed to a given
pesticide may have that pesticide's metabolite concentration
in the urine equal to zero, and the maximum possible urine
concentration cannot approach infinity and must be finite.
The SB
can be expressed by a lognormal distribution
bounded by a lower concentration (Xmin
) and a maximum
concentration (Xmax
) (Mage, 1980). The transformation is
that the variable Y, where Y ¼ (XÀXmin
)/(Xmax
ÀX) is
lognormally distributed. The variable Xmin
can be negative,
but the values predicted equal to or less than zero are
censored and all are treated as equal to zero. Note that the
SB
model can fit a continuum of distributions that connect
the normal to the two-parameter lognormal distribution,
and must fit any data set equal to or better than either of
them.
The MLE method determines the distribution that has the
maximum probability of drawing a given observed data set
as an independent random sample. Let the probability of
drawing a sample with value Y be p(Y) and the probability of
drawing a sample with a value equal or less than Y be F(Y),
where F(Y) is the integral of p(Y) dY between 0 and Y. The
likelihood function L to be maximized is described by the
relationship,

where PF(Y) represents the product function over all the
transformed MDL values, and Pp(Y) represents the product
function over all values above the MDL. The MLE method
was applied to the Cn corrected NHANES-III data, and the
optimal parameters are provided in Table 2.
The results are shown for the 11 of 12 analytes where the
MLE procedure converged to a stable solution. The analyte
carbofuranphenol could not be modeled because there were
only 16 observations above the MDL, so our MLE
procedure would not converge. Table 3 provides a typical
example of the fit of the SB
model using the chlorpyrifos
dosage predicted from the TCPY data. Owing to the MDL
values, an exact comparison of observations and predictions
is not possible, except for the portion of the table where data
are all above the MDL of TCPY of 1 mg/l, which here occurs
at a frequency of 85%.
Discussion
Interpretation of Data and Weighting Functions
The pesticide sample cohort does not represent a probability
sample because the subjects were volunteers from the original
random sample. Consequently, they do not constitute a true
random sample from the NHANES-III random sample, and
their original sampling weights strictly do not apply to these
data. However, there are conditions which might allow a
nonweighted analysis of their data to have some validity. In
mathematical terms, let each ith subject in the sample of size n
have a weighting function wi, and a measured parameter yi.
The mean value (Y) would be computed as Y ¼ Swi yi/Swi.
If the correlation between wi and yi is zero, then the expected
value of the weighted mean of {yi} would be equal to the
nonweighted mean
Y ¼ ðSyiÞ=n:

We have analyzed the correlations of sample weights (wi)
with urinary concentrations (yi) for all 12 analytes, in sets of
residue data that were above their respective MDL. Only two
of the 12 analytes had correlations significantly different from
zero, 1-naphthol and 2,5-dichlorophenol, which had values
r ¼ 0.13 and r ¼ À0.13, respectively. Since the corrections for
these low correlations are of order r2, or 2% to their
calculated means and distributional values, we chose to treat
all 12 analyte values without making the weighting correc-
tions, as that would provide negligible error in comparison to
all other uncertainties in these data and in our analysis.
The subjects' choice whether to volunteer or not was made
without any knowledge of their exposure to the 12 target
parent compounds under study. If their choice to participate
was not influenced by a demographic characteristic that was
correlated with exposure to any of those parent pesticides,
then the sample might constitute a `pseudo random sample'.
For example, if males were more exposed more than females
and only males volunteered, then the sample would be biased
to a greater percentage of higher values than would exist in
the entire population of males and females. In our analyses,
there was no significant difference between the demographic
characteristics of the subjects voluntarily providing urine
samples and the subjects in the complete NHANES-III
cohort. We therefore make the assumption that the choice to
volunteer a urine sample for pesticide analysis was made
independently of any consideration related to their likelihood
of being exposed to the parent pesticides, or any other
demographic characteristics correlated with their pesticide
exposures.

minimum detectable level (MDL) of TCPYof 1 mg/l actually equaled 1 mg/l.
The MLE fit to the SB
model predicts lower values in this range because
MDL observations are expected to fall below 1 mg/l.

With such correlations not withstanding, we can interpret
the distributions as approximating the distribution of
pesticide exposures of people in the US, aged 20­59 years
during the years of sampling. Table 2 shows that two
pesticide residues (2,4,5-TCP and 2,4,6-TCP) have values at
the 99.9th percentile that are greater (transformed) than the
RfD for lindane, their most likely parent compound. 24DCP
is higher at the 99th percentile than its own dietary RfD of
3 mg/kg/day. It is not a human metabolite of 2,4-D, but it can
arise from bacterial degradation of 2,4-D (USEPA, 1980).
Chlorpyrifos has a predicted frequency of 0.02% above the
RfD. When interpreting these data, relative to their RfD for
the various parent compounds or on their own, the
distribution of values we hypothesize may be equal to or
less in frequency for the exposures shown, due to the
possibility of a person's exposure to the pesticide's metabolite
rather than to the parent pesticide, as is the case for TCPY
and chlorpyrifos (Wilson et al., 2003) and the possibility that
the metabolite is also derived from other parent compounds.
However, for those analytes for which there are no data
available on fecal excretion, these values could underestimate
the intake dosage if urinary excretion was less than 100% for
the analyte. Of the analytes shown in Table 1, we have found
human data showing less than 100% urinary excretion only
for 3,5,6-TCPY. Given that the RfD is a calculated daily
exposure value for which no human health effect is expected,
we conclude that, based on this one biomonitoring sample,
most subjects were not exposed to the target pesticides at a
rate leading to a public health concern.
Recommendation for Future Work
We recommend that in future biological monitoring of
urinary pesticide residues and metabolites, when possible, it is
best to collect a total 24-h void and to record knowledge of
the subject's body weight so that the mg equivalents/kg/day
of a subject's average daily intake of parent pesticide can be
estimated directly. This would eliminate the uncertainty
inherent in the creatinine correction we have used. If a total
24-h urine collection is not possible because of a high rate of
subject refusal or logistical problems, then the total void
volume of the spot sample should be recorded along with the
time from the previous void. We propose that the technique
we have developed be utilized for comparing such exposures
developed from urinary concentration data to regulatory
estimates of exposures based on exposure models.
Summary and conclusion
We have reviewed the literature on the usage of urinary Cn
excretion to normalize measurements of urinary pesticide
residues, and have shown how an individual's physiologic
data (age, gender, height, weight) can be used to estimate
their daily Cn excretion rate to transform their pesticide/
metabolite data into individual estimates of daily pesticide
urinary excretion rate. Assuming equilibrium (molar intake
rate of parent ¼molar excretion rate of analyte), our results
show that the vast majority of the sample from the adult
general public, during the 1988­1994 NHANES-III survey,
may not have been exposed to the 12 target pesticides at a
rate above the RfD. Our analysis assumes that the 978 adult
subjects sampled represent the general public that does not
apply pesticides occupationally and does not receive suffi-
ciently high pesticide exposures that reach the transport
maximum for the corresponding analytes which would call
into question our Cn correction procedure. Only two of the
subjects whose estimated dose exceeded an RfD had current
occupations in the area of ``Agricultural services, forestry and
fishing'' and their previous occupations were as `construction
laborer' and `mover of freight, stock and materials by hand'.
We have used the Johnson SB
model to predict the
distribution of ingestion dose rates of the imputed parent
compound for each metabolite or residue and compared
them to their respective RfDs. We recommend that such a
procedure be considered in future studies of urinary pesticide
analyte concentrations to provide an individualistic estima-
tion procedure to be applied to each subject in the study.
