Since 1981, an epizootic of raccoon rabies has spread
throughout the eastern United States. A concomitant
increase in reported rabies cases in skunks has raised con-
cerns that an independent maintenance cycle of rabies
virus in skunks could become established, affecting current
strategies of wildlife rabies control programs. Rabies sur-
veillance data from 1981 through 2000 obtained from the
health departments of 11 eastern states were used to ana-
lyze temporal and spatial characteristics of rabies epi-
zootics in each species. Spatial analysis indicated that epi-
zootics in raccoons and skunks moved in a similar direction
from 1990 to 2000. Temporal regression analysis showed
that the number of rabid raccoons predicted the number of
rabid skunks through time, with a 1-month lag. In areas
where the raccoon rabies virus variant is enzootic, spatio-
temporal analysis does not provide evidence that this
rabies virus variant is currently cycling independently
among skunks.
In North America, variants of rabies virus are maintained
in the wild by several terrestrial carnivore species,
including raccoons, skunks, and a number of bat species.
Each antigenically and genetically distinct variant of the
virus in mammalian species occurs in geographically dis-
crete areas and is strongly associated with its reservoir
species (1). Within each area, a spillover of rabies into
other species occurs, especially during epizootics (2). As a
result of spillover, a variant may eventually adapt to a sec-
ondary species, which may begin to serve as an alternative
reservoir species. This phenomenon of spillover and cross-
species adaptation has been inferred from historical rela-
tionships (2) but is poorly understood and not routinely
investigated.
In the late 1970s, an epizootic of raccoon rabies was
reported on the Virginia/West Virginia border attributed to
the translocation of raccoons from the southeastern United
States (3). This epizootic has spread northward and south-
ward throughout the eastern United States (Figure 1a,b).
The establishment of rabies in this species has raised pub-
lic health concerns about an increased risk for rabies trans-
mission to the human population because the raccoons are
well adapted to living at unusually high densities in urban
and suburban environments (4,5). As a novel potential con-
trol method, several states have initiated raccoon vaccina-
tion programs using an oral rabies vaccine (6­9).
Beginning in 1990, a concomitant increase in the num-
ber of cases of skunks infected with the raccoon rabies
virus variant has occurred in these states (Figure 1c,d).
Additionally, these cases appeared to be preceded by cases
in raccoons, both temporally and spatially. Moreover, in a
growing number of counties in Massachusetts and Rhode
Island, the number of rabid skunks has surpassed the num-
ber of rabid raccoons. Whether the increasing number of
cases in skunks is a result of spillover from raccoons or the
raccoon rabies virus variant has begun to circulate inde-

pendently within the skunk population remains unclear.
The establishment of an independent cycle of rabies in the
skunk population may have serious consequences for
rabies vaccine baiting programs because the current oral
vaccine for raccoons is not as effective in skunks (10).
The epizootiology of raccoon rabies in the eastern
United States has been investigated in several states,
including Virginia (11,12), Connecticut (13), and
Maryland (14,15). Models have been developed to
describe the spatial and temporal patterns of raccoon rabies
epizootics (16­18). Several studies have also described the
behavior of skunk rabies epizootics in western North
America (19­21), Texas (22), and Canada (23). The exist-
ing raccoon and skunk rabies studies show that epizootic
patterns appear to differ between skunks and raccoons,
possibly because of differences between the species, rabies
virus variants, or environmental factors. However, no doc-
umented studies exist on the relatively recent increase of
rabies in skunks caused by the raccoon rabies virus variant
in the eastern United States. In light of the recent efforts to
implement rabies control programs for raccoons in the
eastern United States, the epizootiology of raccoon rabies
virus variant occurring in skunks in this part of the country
needs to be better understood.
The objectives of this study were to describe the epi-
zootiology of skunk rabies in the eastern United States,
determine if skunk and raccoon rabies epizootics are asso-
ciated spatially and temporally, and introduce methods to
assess evidence of spillover of rabies from raccoons to
skunks compared with independent cycling of the virus
within the skunk population.
Materials and Methods
Surveillance Data
Rabies case data for raccoons and skunks for each
county by month from 11 states (Connecticut, Delaware,
Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North
Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, and West
Virginia) were used for analysis. Only counts of rabid ani-
mals per county were used because not all counties report-
ed total numbers of animals submitted for testing. The
observation period for each county started when the first
case of raccoon or skunk rabies was reported, with a max-
imum study interval of 20 years (1981­2000) and a mini-
mum of 11 years (1990­2000). The lengthy study interval
reduced the variability of reporting within a county that
may be observed when an epizootic arrives. The unit of
analysis was the number of laboratory-confirmed rabies
cases in raccoons and skunks reported per month by coun-
ty. To identify counties that had an appreciable number of
skunks infected with rabies, analysis was restricted to
counties that reported at least 12 rabid skunks within 12
months of first detecting rabies in skunks. This average of
one rabid skunk per month corresponded to the 90th per-
centile of all counties reporting at least one rabid skunk,
and 36 counties met this criterion. Upon examination, one
county was excluded because of geographic isolation in
the western part of Maryland (Garrett County) that would
have severely biased the spatial analysis, and three coun-
ties in New York (Clinton, Franklin, and Oswego) were
excluded because rabies found in skunks was the result of
spillover from a red fox epizootic emerging from Canada
(24).
Descriptive Analysis
Rabies epizootics among skunks and raccoons in the 32
counties used for our analyses were identified by using the
following algorithm: an epizootic began when the month-
ly number of rabid animals reported was greater than the
county's monthly median for two consecutive months and
ended when this number was less than or equal to the
county median for two consecutive months (16).
Additionally, an epizootic had to be at least 5 months in
duration. In calculating a county's monthly median num-
ber of rabid animals, months occurring before the appear-
ance of the first rabid animal were excluded. For example,
if rabid skunks first appeared in a county on June 1, 1994,
then the months before were excluded for calculation of
the skunk median. In that same county, if rabid raccoons
appeared on December 1, 1993, then the months before
were excluded from calculation of the raccoon median.
The size and length of epizootics were compared between
species by a Wilcoxon rank sum test. The Kolmogorov-
Smirnov two-sample (KS) test was used to assess season-
al differences in the number of rabies cases by species.
Temporal Analysis
A series of Poisson regression models were used to fur-
ther explore the relationship between the number of rabid
skunks and rabid raccoons. The outcome variable was
defined as the log number of rabid skunks. The predictor
variables were the number of rabid raccoons, time (contin-
uous, 1­140 months), and calendar month of report. The
time variables started at 1 with the appearance of the first
rabid animal (skunk or raccoon) and continued for up to a
total of 140 months (maximum number of months of
observation). All counties had at least 72 months of fol-
low-up, and 50% had more than 107 months of follow-up.
To smooth each time series, a moving average of the num-
ber of rabid animals was calculated on the basis of the
present and previous month's observations for both species
and used for subsequent analyses. A time-squared term, an
interaction term of time by number of rabid raccoons and
indicator variables for county and calendar month of
report, was included in the model. The effect of repeated

measures by county was controlled in the analysis by using
a generalized estimating equation (25). Lag periods of 0 to
5 months for the number of rabid raccoons were intro-
duced and assessed to identify any improved fit in the
Poisson regression model, as determined by comparing the
log likelihood values. The model with the highest (less
negative) log likelihood value was chosen as the best fit-
ting model.

Spatial Analysis
To determine if skunk and raccoon epizootics were
associated spatially from 1990 through 2000, the mean
center of the counties reporting a rabies case was deter-
mined for successive years, 1990­2000, for each species
(Crimestat, Department of Justice). The standard devia-
tional ellipse was also calculated, showing the dispersion
in two dimensions (Crimestat) of the mean centers. The
distance between mean centers of successive years by
species was calculated by the Pythagorean theorem. The
direction between mean centers was calculated by convert-
ing latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates into the
Universal Transverse Mercator projections of eastings and
northings. On dividing the difference in eastings by the dif-
ference in northings, the arctangent was calculated (26),
yielding the angle (degrees) between the mean centers.
The angle was then converted to degrees from the refer-
ence angle of 0°(true north). The resulting series of vectors
(Figure 2) was used to determine if the mean centers by
year for each species were moving in a similar direction.
The Watson-Williams test (27) was applied to test for a dif-
ference in the angle of rotation between the mean centers
of each species from 1990 to 2000. An F test was used to
determine if the epizootic direction of spread differed
between the species. The cumulative mean direction (rota-
tional angle that summarizes a series of vectors through
successive years) and circular variance of the mean centers
were also calculated (Crimestat).
Results
Descriptive Analysis
Of 495 total counties, 344 (69.5%) reported at least one
rabid skunk, and 421 (85.1%) reported at least one rabid
raccoon (Table 1). The median number of reported rabid
raccoons was greater than that for skunks (p<0.0001).
Three hundred thirty-nine counties (68.5%) reported rabies
in both skunks and raccoons. Within these counties, rabid
raccoons preceded rabid skunks in 297 counties (87.6%),
rabid skunks preceded rabid raccoons in 30 counties
(8.8%), and rabid skunks and raccoons were first reported
in the same month in 12 counties (3.5%). The median
interval between the initial appearance of rabid raccoons
and skunks was 14 months and ranged from ­108 months
(i.e., rabid skunks preceding rabid raccoons) to 177
months.
Of 344 counties with at least one reported rabid skunk,
36 counties had at least 12 rabid skunks appearing in the
first 12 months after the first rabid skunk appeared. Four
counties were omitted for reasons described in the
Methods section. In these 32 counties used for more
detailed analysis, rabid raccoons preceded skunks in 30
(93.8%) counties, rabid skunks preceded raccoons in 1
(3.1%) county, and both skunks and raccoons appeared in
the same month in one county (3.1%). The median interval
between the appearance of rabies in raccoons and skunks
was 5 months, and ranged from ­2 months to 13 months.
In the four omitted counties, rabid raccoons preceded
skunks in two counties, and rabid skunks preceded rac-
coons in the remaining two counties.

centers of counties from 11 mid-Atlantic states reporting rabies
from 1990 to 2000 for raccoons and skunks.
For all 32 counties, the peak number of rabid raccoons
reported was reached by 21 months; the median interval
from the first case to the peak number of cases was 10.5
months. In contrast, the interval from the first to the peak
number of skunks ranged from 6 to 90 months, with a
median interval of 16.5 months (p<0.001). The calendar
month when the peak was reached did not exhibit a pattern
for rabid raccoons, whereas for rabid skunks there was a
strong tendency for the peak to be reached in the last quar-
ter of the year.
Analysis of epizootic characteristics found differences
between the first epizootics of each species (Table 2). The
first raccoon epizootic was significantly larger (medi-
an=126; range 9­494, p<0.0001) than subsequent epi-
zootics among raccoons and also significantly greater than
the first skunk epizootic (median=16; range 4­85,
p<0.0001). However, after the first epizootic, the epi-
zootics converged and characteristics did not differ, with
the exception of the third epizootic, in which the duration
and magnitude were lower for skunks than for raccoons. In
general, the size of subsequent epizootics among raccoons
showed damped oscillations, while skunk epizootics
appeared uniform.
Temporal Analysis
Overall, a significant relationship existed between the
number of rabid raccoons (RACCOON) and the number of
rabid skunks (SKUNK) (Figure 3, Table 3). Specifically, a
significant interaction existed between time and RAC-
COON on SKUNK with the effect of RACCOON on
SKUNK increasing with increasing time. The fit of the
models improved significantly when a 1- or 2-month lag
for RACCOON was used to predict SKUNK; however, the
lag of 1 month provided the best fit. The time-squared term
was not significant and was dropped from subsequent
models. A month by RACCOON interaction was also test-
ed and did not significantly improve the model fit. At the
beginning of the time series, the peak in SKUNK coincid-
ed with the larger peak in RACCOON. In the period of
approximately 25 months to approximately 50 months, the
sharp reduction in RACCOON and coincident reduction in
SKUNK was well below model predictions. A second peak
in SKUNK at approximately 55 months and 70 months
coincided with the increase in RACCOON associated with
a second epizootic among raccoons. The model predictions
reflected this increase, but the predicted SKUNK fell
below the actual SKUNK for the peak months. In addition
to a positive correlation with RACCOON over time,
SKUNK displayed a strong seasonal component with
annual peaks occurring in the fall months (Figure 4). These
strong seasonal peaks were unique to skunks, and not pres-
ent in raccoons (KS=10.6; p<0.0001).

al increase in the number of skunks over time (Essex,
Middlesex, Norfolk, and Plymouth). A separate model was
fit to determine potential differences between these coun-
ties and the 28 other counties that did not exhibit a signif-
icant increase in rabid skunks over time. The modeling
results did not differ among these counties compared with
those for the other 28 counties.
Spatial Analysis
As determined by previously described methods that
used vectors (Figure 2), the mean centers of the counties
first reporting rabies in both species were in Maryland in
1990 (Figure 5a), and Virginia/West Virginia in 2000
(Figure 5b). The mean direction and distance traveled of
the skunk and raccoon epizootics were similar. The mean
centers of the epizootics from 1990 to 2000 moved an
average of 339.3 km for skunks and 368.2 km for raccoons
in a southwesterly direction. Application of the Watson-
Williams test resulted in no significant difference between
the angles of rotation of successive epizootics [F
1,18
=
0.11(F
1,18;0.95
<4.41, n.s.)], indicating that the mean centers
of the skunk and raccoon epizootics were moving in a sim-
ilar direction. The cumulative mean directions of the epi-
zootics from 1990 to 2000 were 42.06° ± 0.23 for skunks,
and 47.76° ± 0.28 for raccoons.
Discussion
This study examined the relationship between the
occurrence of rabies in skunks and raccoons in the eastern
United States. The present analysis indicated epizootic
cycles of 4­5 years for raccoons and skunks, consistent
with previous studies of rabies in raccoons (16,17) in this
region. In comparison, studies of the epidemiology of
skunk-variant rabies among skunks from the Midwest
reported epizootic cycles with periods ranging from 4 to 5
years (21) to 6 to 8 years (20,28). If raccoon-variant rabies
virus becomes established in eastern skunk populations,
the periods of epizootic cycles in skunks may subsequent-
ly decouple from those of raccoons so that independent
cycles among skunks may be observable. However, differ-
ences in the periodicity of cycles between these species
may be caused by many factors, including differences
between the variants, resulting in changes in incubation
period, transmission potential, and duration of disease.
The spatial analysis performed in this study indicated
that skunk rabies epizootics in the eastern United States are
closely coupled to epizootics in raccoons. These epizootics
moved in similar directions and traveled similar distances
as they progressed upwards along the eastern seaboard.
The mean centers of epizootics in each species originated
near Maryland and are now situated near the Virginia/West
Virginia border as of 2000 (Figure 5a,b). The southwester-
ly movement is of concern as the raccoon epizootic
encroaches areas in the Midwest, where the skunk virus
variant predominates.
The Poisson regression analysis showed a statistically
significant association between the number of rabid
skunks and raccoons through time. The association was
weakest during the first months, apparently due to the large
number of rabid raccoons that are characteristic of initial
rabies epizootics in raccoons (16). After the initial peak in
numbers at approximately 15 months, both species exhib-
ited a secondary peak at 60 months, consistent with the
4­5 year cycle (16,17) for raccoon epizootics in the east-
ern United States. After 80 months, the number of peaks in
both species diminished in size and increased in frequen-

cy, with the rabies cases in skunks maintaining a strong
seasonal component.
The comparison of epizootic characteristics by species
also found that the size and duration of epizootics in both
species converged after the first epizootic. Of note, howev-
er, were the four counties in which rabies cases in skunks
were outnumbering those in raccoons near the end of our
study period. In these counties, rabies cases in skunks
became less sporadic: cases were regularly reported
throughout the year but the annual peaks in the fall months
remained. As surveillance continues for these four coun-
ties, current observations suggest that skunks may be act-
ing as important secondary hosts of the raccoon rabies
virus variant in certain geographic areas of the eastern
United States and that the potential for independent cycles
to emerge exists.
Although we varied the time variable between raccoon
and skunk rabies from 0 to 5 months, the best fitting
regression model resulted from using a 1-month lag time.
This lag time is consistent with the generally accepted
incubation period for rabies of 3­8 weeks (29), which
would permit at least one cycle of virus multiplication
among raccoons before transmission from raccoons to
skunks. The regression model also showed that reports of
rabid raccoons remain fairly constant by month throughout
the year. In contrast, the number of rabid skunks showed
an independent seasonal pattern that consistently peaked
during the fall months (Figure 4). In the Midwest, where
rabies is endemic in skunks, the major peak is in late win-
ter and early spring, with a smaller peak in the fall (20,28).
The peaks in winter and late spring have been attributable
to the breeding season, and the fall peak to dispersal of
juveniles (23). Why a dominant fall peak is apparent in the
eastern states is not clear at this time. However, during dis-
persal, skunks may have increased contact with more rac-
coons, thereby increasing the risk for transmission of
rabies. The absence of a spring peak may indicate little to
no transmission between skunks in communal winter dens
and during the breeding season.
Skunks and raccoons coexist within the same geograph-
ic areas in different ecologic niches. Raccoons are social
animals that are capable of existing in fairly high densities
in close proximity to human habitation and prefer forested
habitats (4,5,15). Skunks are rather solitary animals and are
found in lower densities than raccoons (23). Skunks prefer
grasslands (21), agricultural areas (30), and interfaces
between agricultural and nonagricultural lands (22). These
characteristics would suggest that contact between the two
species should occur less frequently than among those of
the same species. However, since rabies affects the central
nervous system, rabid animals may exhibit aberrant behav-
iors, leading to increased contact between the species and
cross-species transmission of the virus.
Monitoring rabies among skunks in regions where the
raccoon rabies virus variant circulates has important impli-
cations for public health intervention programs. To control
the spread of the raccoon rabies epizootic, an oral rabies
vaccine-baiting program has been implemented in several
states (7­9,31) after the successful development of a vac-
cinia virus recombinant vaccine expressing the rabies virus
glycoprotein gene (V-RG) for raccoons (6,32). The oral
vaccine has been effective in raccoons. However, as for-
mulated for raccoons, it has not been proven to be as effec-

shown to be effective in controlling rabies in skunks (5),
but this method is labor-intensive and cost-prohibitive. The
emergence of independent maintenance or cycling of rac-
coon-associated rabies virus within skunks would necessi-
tate the development of alternative strategies to control
rabies within wildlife populations. At least one vaccine
candidate (33) designed for skunks has been identified but
will require further development for this species and pre-
vent spillover of rabies back into the raccoon population.
Currently, we have no evidence that the raccoon rabies
virus variant is cycling independently in the skunk popula-
tion of the eastern United States or that the variant has
undergone any genetic adaptations among skunks.
However, epizootic rabies in skunks was first reported in
1990 and, with expected epizootics cycling every 4­5 to
6­8 years, it may be too soon to detect decoupling of rabies
cycles in skunks and raccoons. Surveillance and monitor-
ing must continue through several cycles to further evalu-
ate additional epizootics for changes in patterns.
Additionally, scant information exists on the population
densities and behavior patterns of skunks and raccoons in
the eastern United States. Field investigations to assess the
incidence of rabies in wildlife populations have rarely been
conducted. Further research is needed to evaluate environ-
mental factors that can affect the population density and
structure, the behavior of both raccoons and skunks, and
factors influencing interactions between them. Finally, the
genetics of the raccoon rabies virus variant should be mon-
itored for changes that might indicate cross-species adap-
tation after spillover into skunks. Assessment of these
changes and continued surveillance can provide important
guidelines to ensure the success of oral rabies vaccination
programs for the control of rabies in wildlife and to
decrease the risk of acquiring rabies among the human and
domestic animal populations.
