Abstract
Delphi Groups are an increasingly popular method, not least because electronic communications
have made it easier to assemble a `virtual' expert panel, but there have been a number of
review articles which have pointed to a lack of rigour. Using an extended case study of a Delphi
Group designed to establish agreed policy recommendations and deriving from a project using
observational and semi-structured interview methods, this article examines the value of Delphi
Groups as part of a mixed method research design. The article includes a narrative of the
sequence of events in the Delphi Group's deliberations, a detailed examination of how the group
process led to the modification of one draft policy recommendation, a further examination of
a contested additional policy recommendation, and a list of pragmatic recommendations on the
conduct of Delphi Groups in respect of size, composition, recruitment, contestation, timing,
closure and scope.

Introduction
Delphi Groups have been defined as `A method for achieving consensual agreement
among expert panellists, through repeated iterations (usually by email) of anonymized
opinions and of proposed compromise statements from the group moderator' (Bloor and
Wood, 2006). The technique has its origins in attempts to inform military strategy during
the Cold War (see Rescher, 1998) and has evolved to become a quite popular method in
policy studies, particularly in the health field (e.g. Adler and Ziglio, 1996; Keeney et al.,
2011). Previous logistical difficulties have diminished with the advent of internet access,
which has allowed the assemblage of `virtual' panels of experts. However, review arti-
cles have been critical of the standard of much of Delphi Group research and it has
developed an unenviable `quick and dirty' reputation. Typical problems include: panel
recruitment bias, poor specification of questions/tasks by the moderator, high rates of
panel attrition, problematic consensus where it is unclear what actually constitutes con-
sensus, and `specious consensus' where panellists conform out of sheer boredom (see
reviews by Rowe and Wright, 1999; Garrod and Fyall, 2005).
Potentially, Delphi Group methods can assist in the communication of research
findings to policy-makers. The relationship between sociological research and policy-
making is contested and problematical (see Bloor, 2004). Becker's famous rhetorical
question `Whose side are we on?' (1967) was a call for a partisan sociology which
championed the underdog against the elites, including the policy-maker elites, and
Burawoy (2005) called for a `public sociology' that would appeal directly to the public
over the heads of policy-makers. Harvey Moloch (1994) has ruefully pointed out that
sociologists who wish to `speak truth to power' actually have great difficulty finding
anyone to speak to at all. In contrast, Bulmer (1982) has described a different model of
sociological influence, the `enlightenment model', where social scientists influence
policy-makers osmotically through extended informal contact, but it has to be objected
that, in Anglo-Saxon countries at least (France and Scandinavia might possibly form
contrasting cases), sociologists are rare visitors to the corridors of power. It follows
that, while policy-makers may be the anticipated audience for much research, many
sociologists are inexpert in drawing out the policy implications of research findings
and could use some expert help.
This paper does not seek to rehabilitate Delphi Groups as a stand-alone research
method, but rather considers the possible limited role of Delphi Groups within multi-
method research projects, where expert input from a Delphi Group in the end-phase of
the project can potentially serve a number of useful functions. There is a large literature
on the virtues and drawbacks of mixed method designs that has been widely reviewed
elsewhere (Barbour, 1999; Brannen, 1992; Bryman, 2006; Cresswell and Plano-Clark,
2007; Johnson and Onwuegbuzie, 2004; Morse, 2005; O'Cathain, 2010; Parry-Langdon
et al., 2003), a handbook on mixed methods has been published (Tashakkori and Teddie,
2003), and there is a journal, the Journal of Mixed Methods Research1 devoted to mixed
methods studies, so only a brief recapitulation is necessary here. The most recent review
(O'Cathain, 2010) lists four virtues of mixed methods. One of these virtues, `develop-
ment or facilitation', is a mere commonplace ­ the use of one method, say a postal sur-
vey, to facilitate the recruitment of a sub-sample for another method, say semi-structured
Bloor et al. 59
face-to-face interviews. A second virtue, that of `emancipation' or giving voice to the
marginalised or oppressed, is controversial and open to dismissal as tokenism.
The third claimed virtue of mixed methods is also controversial, but less readily dis-
missible. Where a Delphi Group is part of a mixed method design and the expert panel-
lists of the Delphi Group have also been among the research participants in the wider
study, as interviewees or subjects of ethnographic observation, the Delphi Group method
then becomes, in effect, a variant of that form of `methodological triangulation'(Denzin,
1970) known (misleadingly) as `member validation'(Emerson and Pollner, 1988). While
triangulation ­ the comparison of findings on the same research topic generated by dif-
ferent methods ­ is often seen as a mark of good research practice, member validation is
usually dismissed as a well-meaning but wrong-headed attempt to demonstrate the accu-
racy of a social science account of a social activity by appeal to the judgement of those
persons taking part in that social activity. The problems with member validation have
been discussed elsewhere (Bloor, 1997; Emerson and Pollner, 1988; Seale, 1999: 61­
72). There is a lurking positivist assumption of just a single paramount reality available
for sociological description. There is also the concern that collectivity members, shown
the sociologist's account and asked to validate it, may find it too politically sensitive and
may fear that it will be used as a weapon against them by others. Alternatively, members
shown an account for validation purposes may be quite unconcerned and may only read
the sociologist's report in a superficial and uncritical way. Further, there is the possibility
that members' views may change over time ­ what they previously would have vali-
dated, they now reject, or vice versa. And, finally and most importantly, there is a failure
on the part of the investigator to appreciate that the member validation exercise is not a
neutral information-gathering medium: like all methodological processes, it shapes the
product it is designed to produce. However, there is no need for a Delphi group exercise
to be oriented towards the validation of research findings: it may still be a very useful
exercise if it produces a critical panellist's response to preliminary findings and leads to
the reconsideration of earlier data, to the amendment or qualification of preliminary find-
ings, and/or to the sharpening of conclusions and recommendations. This indeed is the
fourth (and uncontroversial) virtue of mixed method designs, that of comprehensiveness,
whereby a topic can be addressed more widely and completely by a range of datasets.
Thus, a Delphi Group constituted from research participants (as in the case below) may
be simply a useful additional dataset in a multi-method research design, without there
being any ambition to conduct a member validation exercise.
For illustration, we report on the progress of a Delphi Group exercise where a virtual
expert panel was tasked to reach consensus on the policy recommendations to be drawn
from a project on the effectiveness of enforcement of new international regulations on
ship emissions. A methods section briefly describes the wider study within which the
Delphi Group was conducted and describes in more detail the composition and conduct
of the group. Two further sections illustrate, first, the process whereby a draft recom-
mendation of the study was modified through the Delphi process, and second, the pro-
cess whereby a possible additional recommendation (proposed by two separate Delphi
Group members) was rejected. This is followed by an extended conclusion, embracing
some pragmatic suggestions on the conduct of Delphi Groups and an examination of the
strengths and weaknesses of Delphi Groups within mixed method research designs.
60 Qualitative Research 15(1)
However, first of all, some background material needs to be presented on the regula-
tion of ship emissions for readers to make sense of the reported Delphi deliberations.
Until very recently, most vessels burnt a cheap residual fuel oil, a by-product of oil refin-
eries (that which is not sold for marine fuel is sold for road tar). However, the exhaust
plume from burning that residual fuel contains pollutants ­ sulphur compounds (SOx),
nitrogen compounds (NOx) and fine particulate matter ­ that have contributed to acidifi-
cation and to pulmonary and coronary diseases (Winebrake et al., 2009). The UN agency,
the International Maritime Organization (IMO) brought into force regulations to control
these emissions in 2005 and 2010. Emission Control Areas (ECAs) were set up in the
Baltic (2006), the North Sea/English Channel (2007) and the coasts of North America
(2012). Initially, the sulphur limit on fuel in the ECAs was set at 1.5%, reducing to 1.00%
on 1 July 2010 and set to further reduce to 0.1% on 1 January 2015. Bunker fuel suppliers
are able to reduce the sulphur content of residual fuel oil to 1.0% (known as low sulphur
fuel oil) by judicious blending of residual fuel oils and distillate. However, a limit of
0.1% sulphur will eliminate the possibility of vessels burning residual fuel oil unless they
fit expensive exhaust abatement technology ­ a dispensation which need not concern us
here. Effectively, vessels in the ECAs will be required to switch to burning much more
expensive distillate fuel and ship operators (at a time of over-capacity and falling freight
rates) will find their fuel costs exceeding their crewing costs. In addition, the EU has
introduced, from January 2010, an additional requirement in EU ports for all ships at
berth (where only auxiliary engines are in use) to burn fuel with 0.1% sulphur.
The main means of enforcing these and other IMO regulations is by `port-State con-
trol', that is, the equal enforcement of international shipping regulations by the port
State, regardless of a ship's flag. Since 1982, the Paris Memorandum of Understanding
on Port State Control (2010) has established a common methodology of ship inspections
for foreign-flagged vessels berthing in European ports. The inspections are not exhaus-
tive: in a frequently used phrase, port-State control is `a sample, not a survey'. Port State
Control Officers are required to use their discretion, and officers who encounter initial
problems are likely to then inspect progressively more areas of the ship's operation and
equipment, while those who do not encounter initial problems may proceed to a `light-
touch' inspection. Officers are empowered to detain ships with serious deficiencies until
those deficiencies are rectified, a sanction which can be expensive for ship operators. But
arguably a more powerful deterrent is the `naming and shaming' of ships with deficien-
cies on industry websites, which impacts on those vessels' abilities to attract custom
from charterers (note however that those industry websites currently only report vessels'
IMOdeficiencies,nottheirEUdeficiencies­seethesectionbelow,`DelphicModification
of a Policy Recommendation'). The most widely used method of enforcing the new sul-
phur regulations is for officers to check the vessel's previous Bunker Delivery Notes
(which the vessel is required to retain), which record the sulphur content of the bunkered
fuel, and for officers to check the Oil Record Book, where a switch-over to a different
fuel must be recorded by the Chief Engineer. The European Commission has requested
Member States to take samples of fuel, on occasion, for testing of the sulphur content.
However, only Denmark, Germany, Holland and Sweden have so far equipped their
officers with fuel sampling kits. Testing of fuel is expensive and port-State control is not
a revenue-generating activity.
Bloor et al. 61
Finally, it should be noted that, over time, the operation of port-State control appears
to have served to increase the quality of shipping, at least in respect of those vessels trad-
ing in and out of European ports. A `culture of compliance'is said to have recently grown
up among ship operators (Bloor, Sampson et al., 2013). However, the potential rewards
for non-compliance with the sulphur regulations are very substantial: currently (July
2013), the price difference between high sulphur fuel oil outside the ECAs and the com-
pliant 1.0% low sulphur fuel oil is around $18 per tonne, and the price difference between
high sulphur fuel oil and 0.1% distillate is a massive $325 per tonne. There are therefore
concerns that, if the fuel regulations are ineffectively policed, then this new culture of
compliance may disintegrate.
Methods
The wider research project (funded by the UK's Economic & Social Research Council)
was comparative between Sweden and the UK and involved observation of 16 ship
inspections (involving in turn extended visits to seven different Port State Control
offices in the UK and Sweden) and 50 qualitative interviews with inspectors, regulators,
shipping industry stakeholders (ship operator managers, shipping industry representa-
tives, fuel experts, trade unionists and others) and environmental NGOs. A final report
was drafted of around 9,000 words and circulated to seven Delphi Group members; the
report concluded with seven policy recommendations. It will be appreciated that, in a
design that had already incorporated semi-structured interviews, it would only be pos-
sible to gauge reactions to the draft policy recommendations by additional use of either
an electronic `real-time' focus group or an electronic Delphi Group, and with research
participants having crowded diaries and other urgent commitments, a Delphi Group was
much easier to convene. The Delphi Group members were drawn from the 50 interview-
ees, but they were not selected randomly. Instead, they were selected purposively as
likely to have a range of viewpoints, and (on the basis of their views at interview) likely
to be sufficiently committed to the study (or the topic) to be willing to take part in the
rather arduous Delphi Group process. The seven members comprised two regulators,
two ship operator managers, one shipping industry representative, one inspector (aka
Port State Control Officer), and one member of an environmental NGO. All seven
agreed to take part.
The purposive selection of Delphi Group participants with a range of backgrounds
increased the likelihood of receiving contributions from Delphi Group members which
exhibit partial disagreement with the seven policy recommendations. In this instance,
the Delphi Group process and the researcher's analytic response are therefore analo-
gous to the search for `deviant cases', which is at the heart of the longstanding proce-
dure known as `analytic induction' (Cressey, 1953; Bloor, 1978), whereby the analyst
searches for deviant cases that do not fit with a preliminary hypothesis and seeks to
modify and extend the hypothesis to accommodate the deviant cases, thereby extend-
ing and deepening the analysis. In Seale's judgement: `as a reminder to be systematic
in the search for negative instances and to modify one's theories in the light of new
evidence, the spirit of analytic induction seems worth preserving in qualitative work'
(Seale, 1999: 85).
62 Qualitative Research 15(1)
The Delphi Group process was scheduled to take place through the month of
September 2012. On Monday 3 September, the first author (acting as group moderator)
re-emailed the draft final report with the recommendations (it had been circulated in the
first place as part of the Delphi Group recruitment process), with a request that individu-
als send their suggested changes to the recommendations back to the moderator by the
end of the day on 5 September. This was `Round 1'. The moderator would then circulate
the anonymised suggestions (and the moderator's response) to the rest of the group, who
would then have an opportunity to respond by the end of 10 September. Those responses
would then lead to a further iteration of the process (`Round 2'), with the prospect of
further iterations occurring to follow, in the hope of eventually arriving at consensual
agreement with the re-drafted recommendations by the end of the month. The initial 3
September email concluded:
Your participation in the group is based on your special expertise [...], but you are not being
asked to participate as a representative of your organisation or company. I would therefore ask
you not to discuss the draft recommendations and your suggestions with colleagues. At the end
of the Delphi Group, the final report together with the (hopefully) consensual recommendations
will be made publicly available. To reiterate, no reports of the project will name any of the
Delphi Group members.
In the event, only four of the seven responded to the first email. Fortunately, however,
these four still represented a range of expertise ­ one regulator, one ship operator man-
ager, one inspector and one member of an environmental NGO. All four participants had
suggestions on modifications to at least one of the recommendations (one group member
offered suggestions on four of the seven recommendations), and two participants inde-
pendently suggested an additional recommendation (see the section `Delphic Suggestion
of an Additional Policy Recommendation'below). The moderator responded privately to
each of the participants, in part in order to seek more clarity on their suggestions, and
then (in Round 2) circulated all the comments (with some abridgement and clarification),
plus his responses, plus revised recommendations.
In response to Round 2, two of the initial participants offered further comments.
None of the Round 1 non-respondents commented, although they received invitations
to do so. The two responses to Round 2 resulted in some further small changes, circu-
lated along with the Round 2 comments and moderator's responses as Round 3. No
further suggestions were received after Round 3 (sent out on 16 September). However,
further information later received, in response to enquiries the moderator made in fol-
lowing up one of the suggestions made in Round 2, led to a further small modification
and a final version of the recommendations (Bloor, Baker et al., 2013) being sent out
on 25 September.
Delphic modification of a policy recommendation
In all, three of the seven initial recommendations dispatched to the panellists in Round 1
underwent some important modifications. We illustrate the Delphi process by reference
to the second of those recommendations, which read as follows:
Bloor et al. 63
2. That all EU countries inform the European Commission of the IMO number of all vessels
founded to be non-compliant in respect of the 0.1% sulphur port fuel regulations, with a view
to the Commission seeking to ensure that these non-compliant cases appear on Equasis.
Whereas the final version read as:
2. Publication of Non-Compliant Vessels on Equasis. That all EU countries inform the
European Commission of the IMO number of all vessels found to be non-compliant in respect
of the EU 0.1% sulphur port fuel regulations, with a view to the Commission seeking to ensure
that these non-compliant cases appear on Equasis. It is proposed that the Equasis record contain
the vessel's name, IMO number, inspection place and date, and the fact that the 0.1% EU
at-berth provision has been violated. It should be noted that, at present, a vessel that is detained
for burning fuel in port that is in violation of the EU 0.1% sulphur at berth regulation, can only
appear in THETIS and Equasis if the Port State Control Officer has recorded this regulatory
violation as a deficiency under IMO's ISM code.
This recommendation relates to the previously mentioned importance of the deterrent
effect of `naming and shaming' non-compliant vessels on shipping industry websites
(see, for example, the discussion in Bloor et al., 2006). Such websites (the most influen-
tial of which is Equasis) are widely consulted by charterers, insurers and others, and
vessels with poor compliance records will find the freight rates that they can command
will be severely adversely affected. Equasis obtains its information on the inspection
records of vessels from the THETIS website of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding
on Port State Control. Since THETIS is the Paris MoU website (and since the Paris MoU
includes a number of non-EU members), it only records the results of inspections in
respect of IMO (and International Labour Organization) regulations, not in respect of EU
regulations. However, since the European Commission bankrolls THETIS, it seems rea-
sonable for the Commission to request the inclusion in THETIS of inspection records
showing non-compliance with EU regulations on sulphur levels. Once those inspection
records have appeared in THETIS, they will automatically appear on other websites like
Equasis.
The final version of Recommendation 2 incorporated suggested changes from three
panellists. Two of the changes were minor: first, the final version incorporates a sugges-
tion from one panellist that each recommendation should have its own sub-heading (in
this case, `Publication of Non-compliant Vessels on Equasis'); and second, the final ver-
sion incorporates a full summary of all the recommended information on the vessel to be
published on Equasis (i.e. the vessel's name, and the place and date of inspection), as
well as the vessel's unique IMO number and the regulatory violation. The third change
was more important and concerned a suggestion from a panellist that the violation of the
EU regulation on the sulphur level of fuel to be burnt in port could still be recorded on
the THETIS website as if it were a violation of an IMO regulation, if the inspector in
question recorded the violation as a deficiency under the IMO's International Ship
Management (ISM) Code, Paragraph 1.2.3, of which states that the vessel's safe manage-
ment system should ensure `compliance with mandatory rules and regulations' (IMO,
2002). The ISM code is a requirement for all vessels to have formally laid-down
64 Qualitative Research 15(1)
management systems for all the standard procedures involved in vessel operation (berth-
ing, cargo-handling, etc., etc.).
The third suggestion was a valuable contribution to the study. Treating violation of the
EU regulation as if it were a deficiency under the IMO's ISM code would be a powerful
incentive to regulatory compliance: not only would it result in the naming and shaming
of the vessel in Equasis, but (if the violation was identified as grounds for detention of
the vessel in port by the inspector in question) the ISM code deficiency would automati-
cally trigger the requirement for an additional audit by the vessel's flag-State, with the
possibility of delay and expense for the ship operator. None of the Port State Control
Officers interviewed in the study had suggested that the ISM code could be used in this
manner and, on the one occasion when an observed inspection found a vessel to be burn-
ing non-EU-compliant fuel in port, the inspector in question did not treat the violation as
a deficiency under the ISM code. However, the wording of the ISM code clearly requires
compliance with all mandatory rules and regulations (i.e. regional EU rules, as well as
global IMO rules), and the ISM code is expressly designed to be a tool for the punish-
ment of poor ship management practices (such as the failure to provide the vessel with
compliant fuel). Drawing on his particular expertise, this Delphi Group member had
been able to suggest a possible policy option which had not, thus far, occurred to the
interviewed inspectors, all of them members of a generic inspectorate grappling with the
enforcement of a new regulatory regime. Such a development is, of course, a strength of
a multi-method research design: the additional data provided by the Delphi Group led to
a re-analysis and an extension of the findings.
However, it remained unclear how this possible policy option was to be drafted. Port-
State inspections, in common with much inspection practice in other jurisdictions, follow
a discretionary methodology, allowing surveyors latitude in the depth and foci of inspec-
tions and in the actions required from non-compliant vessels. The relevant Paris MoU
instruction to surveyors states that the surveyor `should use professional judgement to
determine whether to detain the ship or to allow it to sail with deficiencies which do not
pose an unreasonable threat of harm to the environment'(Paris MoU, 2010: 1). Therefore
it would not be appropriate to have a study recommendation that Port State Control
Officers be instructed to treat a violation of the EU port regulations as a deficiency under
the ISM code. One possibility would have been to incorporate the panellist's suggestion
within Recommendation 7 (`Port State Control Training'), but as the panellist had raised
the topic in response to Recommendation 2, it was felt more appropriate to report the
possibility of treating the EU fuel violation as an ISM deficiency as part of
Recommendation 2.
Delphic suggestion of an additional policy
recommendation
Two of the four panellists independently suggested that the research report should rec-
ommend that substantial fines be levied on non-compliant ships. This issue was topical
at the time of the operation of the Delphi Group because a draft European Commission
Directive published at that time had stated the need for Member States to fine the opera-
tors of non-compliant ships. In drafting the research report, the possibility of
Bloor et al. 65
recommending fines had been previously been considered, but rejected. Rejection was
based on the evidence collected in the course of the study on the Swedish experience of
fining operators using non-compliant fuel. Sweden had been taking and testing fuel sam-
ples from around 200 quasi-randomly selected vessels per year, since 2006, but not a
single vessel had been prosecuted between 2006 and 2010. This information had not
been included in the draft report and was thus unavailable to the panellists.
The lead author, who conducted the Delphi Group, accordingly decided not to adopt
the fines suggestion in Round 2, but to state at length the reasons for not doing so. At the
same time, the offer was made to include a recommendation on fines in Round 3 if the
panellists still felt this was necessary. Here is an abridged version of the moderator's
Round 2 response:
I should say that my colleagues on the project and I have considered the fines issue. And you
are right of course that substantial fines do have a deterrent effect. However, I decided against
including this in the recommendations because of the Swedish experience with prosecutions.
As you know, Sweden has been taking fuel samples as part of the enforcement of the fairway
dues system [...] but from 2006 (the start of the Baltic ECA) until the end of 2010 there wasn't
a single prosecution [...] In each case, the [State] prosecutors decided that the higher standard
of proof required for a successful court case had not been achieved (e.g. no proof that the
sample tested in the laboratory was the same as that taken on the ship, no proof that the fuel
sample had not been tampered with en route to the laboratory, etc.). I believe there could be a
similar problem in the UK courts. [...] It's currently unclear how effective the US fines regime
will be, but we felt that in the context of the European courts the high standard of proof of non-
compliance that might be required could mean that relatively few cases would come to court.
Our previous work in this research centre on Port-State Control indicated that the threat of
detention was the major deterrent for ship operators, because the publication of a detention on
Equasis and other industry websites has a major impact on the vessel's future freight rates [...].
So the report focuses on making port-State enforcement more effective. That's why we're
recommending that breaches of EU port 0.1% fuel regulations be publicised on Equasis (they
aren't at the moment) and that departed vessels found on testing to have been burning non-
compliant fuel be inspected at the next port (they aren't at the moment).
Nevertheless, if the general feeling of the group is that we should include a recommendation on
fines, then of course we'll do that.
In their responses to Round 2 of the Delphi Group, only one of the panellists returned to
the fines issue: he did not explicitly state that he wanted his initial suggestion on fines to
stand. Instead, he thanked the lead author for taking his previous suggestion so seriously
and for explaining why the recommendation had not been included in the earlier draft of
the report. He then copied a press report about a fine levied by an Italian court on the
operator of a cruise ship for burning non-compliant fuel in port, while stating that `I have
to admit, though, that this is one of the few examples I've seen'. This was taken to be
concurrent with the view taken in the report that few cases of non-compliance would
come to court and receive fines. The same panellist's response to the final Round 3
included the statement: `Thanks for the new draft recommendations ­ they are all fine'.
66 Qualitative Research 15(1)
So it would appear that this panellist at least had come round to the view that his initial
suggestion for a further recommendation on fines could now be disregarded.
Conclusion: Delphi Group strengths and limitations
We begin with two caveats. First, and self-evidently, a Delphi Group is not the only addi-
tional qualitative method that can be introduced with advantage into a mixed method
design: focus groups and semi-structured interviews are obvious alternatives. But an
electronic Delphi Group, allowing the remote polling of experts, does seem a particularly
appropriate choice for a policy research project.
A second caveat: this discussion is based on the experience of conducting one particu-
lar Delphi Group exercise and it should be acknowledged that, with the benefit of hind-
sight, that exercise could have been better conducted. In particular, it was a mistake not
to explicitly request that the panellists communicate their agreement with the Round 3
recommendations. Although, as seen above, one panellist chose to reply endorsing the
final recommendations, none of the others did so. The email accompanying Round 3 was
poorly phrased and stated:
I have only received one further set of comments on the suggested modifications in Round 2.
These comments, my response and the further suggested modifications are set out in the
attachment. Please could I have your further suggestions by the end of Wednesday Sept 19th?
If I receive no further suggestions, then I will conclude the Delphi Group.
It is likely that the other panellists construed this email as taking the position that non-
response would be taken as agreement and therefore, being in agreement, they felt no
need to respond. But of course non-response can also indicate drop-out ­ what has been
termed elsewhere `specious consensus' (Sackman, 1975). Good practice should require
that all participating panellists explicitly state their agreement before consensus is
claimed and the Delphi Group is concluded.
Having stated this caveat, it seems fitting to draw on the experience of this particular
Delphi Group exercise to include some tentative, pragmatic suggestions on `dos and
don'ts' in Delphi Group conduct:
Size: this Delphi Group exercise operated quite successfully with just four active par-
ticipants, but that is surely a minimum number. However, more important than size is
`balance' ­ it was sheer luck that our four active participants represented a range of
viewpoints, expertise and interests.
Recruitment: given the onerous nature of the exercise, recruitment is most likely to
be successful among a population of research participants, who had previously shown
commitment to the study. However, in this instance seven research participants had
formally agreed to serve as panellists, but in the event only four sent responses. It
would therefore seem prudent to recruit more panellists than are needed in order to
allow for `no-shows'. Again, balance is critical.
Composition: recruitment needs to be tailored to the specific task at hand, kindred to
purposive sampling. A Delphi Group tasked to consider policy recommendations will
Bloor et al. 67
need to include some panellists with policy expertise. Balance is critical, but repre-
sentativeness is not.
Moderation: the moderator's role extends beyond the facilitation of the timely com-
pletion of the Delphi Group and requires the exercise of discernment in responding
to inputs from each round. Not all Delphi suggestions need to be incorporated in the
final version of the recommendations. Where other data justify it, seemingly inappro-
priate recommendations can be courteously contested.
Timing: a virtual Delphi Group, operating by email, is the easiest commitment in the
world to extinguish, by the simple expedient of remaining silent. It is therefore im-
portant that panellists realise that their commitment is not open-ended. This Delphi
Group was told that it would end after a month, regardless of whether or not the re-
peated iterations had achieved consensus. The specific function of the Delphi Group,
and the group's time-limited task, differentiate a Delphi Group from the expert Advi-
sory Groups that often accompany large-scale research projects.
Closure: profit by our mistake and ensure that, when sending out the final iteration
you ask all respondents to confirm their agreement, rather than give seeming assent
through their silence.
Modesty: treat the Delphi Group simply as a useful additional data collection exercise
(focusing on policy implications in this particular case). Panellists' agreement does
not equate to either public participation or member validation. Nevertheless, the very
fact that the Delphi Group is a purposive sample, chosen for the range and depth of
their expertise, ensures that the additional data they provide will have particular added
value, especially where the researcher employs an analytic induction approach to the
study of `deviant cases'.
Beyond these `dos and don'ts', some general points can be made on the Delphi Group
method. First, it is clear that Delphi Groups can bring certain advantages within a multi-
method research design. As was illustrated by the panellist's suggestion on the use of
IMO's International Ship Management Code to detain vessels with non-compliant fuel,
a Delphi Group, by being an additional vehicle for the presentation and collection of new
evidence/data/arguments, can extend and deepen an analysis. The nature of the Delphi
Group method is such that the new evidence/data/argument that is generated is likely to
be particularly valuable, since it is likely to be in qualified opposition to early findings:
the analysis has to be inductively modified and extended (or corrected) to embrace these
opposing additional data. The advantage being claimed here is analogous to that claimed
by Irwin (1995) and others for the use of lay experts in an `extended peer review' of
scientific findings. But this is an analogy only: we are not claiming here that Delphi
Groups enhance public participation in sociological research. Delphi Groups are com-
posed, after all, of experts not the laity, and other methods (most notably citizens' juries
­ Coote and Lenaghan, 1997; Dunkerley and Glasner, 1998) have been specially devel-
oped to involve the public in policy-making processes. Nor are we granting a privileged
epistemological status to our expert panellists: the Delphi Group is simply acting as a
spur to further inductive analysis.
Relatedly, as was illustrated by the response to the panellists' suggestions about
fines, the extension of the analysis that can occur as a result of exposure to opposing
68 Qualitative Research 15(1)
viewpoints need not necessarily involve the researcher in accepting antithetical argu-
ments and attempting to incorporate them into the research findings against his/her
better judgement. The role of the moderator in the Delphi Group process allows for the
reasoned exclusion of antithetical arguments, with the consent of the panellists. As the
late Gordon Horobin remarked, `Let a thousand flowers bloom, but don't ask me to
water them all'.
Further, the very act of compiling a set of policy recommendations for submission to a
Delphi Group can itself act to sharpen up the presentation and accessibility of research
findings: the consciousness of the need to be understood by a non-sociological audience
can both act as a spur to clarity and as a censor of political quietism and excessive obscu-
rantist self-reference. And, of course, the panellists in turn can make suggestions to further
improve presentation. A minor suggestion on presentation (the use of sub-headings for
each separate recommendation) has already been illustrated. But additional and more sub-
stantial suggestions were also made in respect of another recommendation (not reported
here) on sampling and testing fuel, which gave that recommendation more clarity.
Relatedly again, Delphi Groups may be particularly useful when deliberating policy
recommendations simply because some of the panellists (at least) may be members of the
policy community and more expert in framing policy recommendations than researchers.
While a Delphi Group may be composed with an eye to a number of different specific
functions within a research design, a policy-orientated Delphi Group may be of particu-
lar value.
Nevertheless, Delphi Groups can be, and have been, composed of members other than
policy experts and can deliberate on topics other than policy recommendations. For
example, service-users and service-providers have both been enrolled in past Delphi
Groups. Technological advances have made light of the problem of remoteness, but the
some of the problems mentioned by past reviewers of Delphi Group studies remain, most
notably the problems of high panel attrition, and of poor specification of tasks by the
moderator where the focus of the Delphi Group is more diffuse than a stated set of policy
recommendations. The Delphi Group is not a tool suitable for all research occasions.
