The educational system within the United States creates
many opportunities for youth sport programs to exist in our
society (Covell, 2012). As such, these programs have a direct
impact on the youth who participate and their families within
communities. General participation from youth in sport
seems as if it is a common rite and part of American culture
as the numbers of participants within youth sport continually
grow (Coakley, 2009). Although some may argue, reasons
for the increased numbers of participation stem from the
positive traits received from individuals participating within
these athletic programs. Such positive traits learned within
these programs are proper sport instruction, character build-
ing, and the avenue of sport as a bridge between childhood
and adulthood (Hansen, Larson, & Dworkin, 2003).
Furthermore, one's involvement within youth sport as an
administrator, coach, or official may increase the positive
traits received from overall involvement within youth sport.
However, anecdotal evidence suggests that turnover and
staffing may be a significant issue for youth sport officials
(Yu, 2007). Therefore from a management perspective,
recruitment, training, and retention of youth sport officials
are salient to the continual growth of youth sport within our
society.
The existence of these youth programs depend on proper
management from administrators who oversee finances,
facilities, and most importantly the human resources needed
to execute these programs (Quinn, 1999). More specifically,
it is pertinent that these administrators recruit individuals
who can attempt to continually build a positive youth sport
culture. Such a task has proven to be difficult, as budgetary
constraints do not allow for a surplus of income for those
who choose a career in youth sport (Wilcox, 2003). To over-
come financial constraints, youth sport officials often turn to
individuals who are willing to become involved in youth
sport as an avocation. An avocation is briefly defined as a
subordinate occupation an individual chooses to participate
in, in addition to one's primary employment (Eitzen, 1989).
From this definition, many individuals who become involved
in youth sport (e.g., officials) have professional careers out-
side of the avocation of choice. In addition, it can further be
assumed that many of these individuals work in industries
that demand attention and time resulting in minimal attention
to other avenues of employment. As such, the primary
demands of their professional careers often interfere with the
secondary demands of the avocation resulting in high turn-
over in youth sport.
Many sport organizations, to a great extent, dedicate their
planning hours into recruiting individuals who choose youth
sport as an avocation (Eitzen, 1989). In addition, administra-
tors in youth sport spend a great deal of time focusing on the
coaching and player development. As a result, opportunities

Influences of Training on Individual
Outcomes for High School Sports Officials
Timothy D. Ryan1, Jason P. Sosa2, and Michael A. Thornton3
Abstract
The primary purpose of this study was to explore the influences of training on specific quality of work outcomes of job
satisfaction, pay satisfaction, and intentions to leave within high school sports officials. Evidence suggests that there is a
shortage of high school officials in all categories of high school sport. Via a web-based survey, we explored the effects of
training on the individual outcomes under study. Results indicated that the level of training had a significant effect on job
satisfaction, pay satisfaction, and turnover intentions. Analyses indicated that officials with less training had higher turnover
intentions and lower job satisfaction than officials who had more training. Conversely, officials who engaged numerous
training hours had lower pay satisfaction. This exploratory study supports the importance of training high school officials but,
more importantly, provides an initial assessment on the reverse effects of training on pay satisfaction.

to play and receive formalized training in coaching seem to
be readily available in many youth sport organizations.
However, one such area of formalized training that is often
neglected is that of officiating (i.e., referees). Arguably, offi-
cials are most important to youth sport contests aside from
the coaches and the participant, as their primary focus is to
provide an atmosphere of safety and fair play. Practitioners
are not alone in their under examination of youth sport offi-
cials, scholars in sport management to a great extent have
also focused much of their related works on coaches and
player dynamics (Clopton, 2011; Cunningham & Sagas,
2004; Smith & Smoll, 1997; Turman, 2003). Currently, there
is scant literature devoted to the individual outcomes of
youth sport officials and their influence on the overall orga-
nization within youth sport. In general, it is relevant to these
organizations to understand the attitudes and behaviors of
youth sport officials whose primary careers are not in youth
sport.
To that end, the primary focus of this study is to identify
the influence of formalized training on quality of work out-
come of youth sport officials. More specifically, it was the
intent of this study to explore the influence of levels of for-
malized training on job satisfaction, pay satisfaction, and
intentions to leave high school sports officiating. Presently,
retaining individuals whose avocation of choice is officiating
has proven difficult to many sport organizations (Kellet &
Shilbury, 2007). Following relevant works within manage-
ment (Badri, Davis, & Davis, 1995; Kathuria & Davis, 2001;
Natarajan & Nagar, 2011), training is linked to influencing
the aforementioned quality of work outcomes. Yet, these
linkages have been studied in the general management con-
text of full-time employees and have yet to be explored
within an avocation. To that end, we intended to analyze the
effects of formalized training on job satisfaction, pay satis-
faction, and turnover intentions of high school sport
officials.
Conceptual Framework
To examine the influence of training on job satisfaction, pay
satisfaction, and turnover intentions, it is important to come
to an understanding of each of these constructs. In addition,
we intend to identify some of the relevant works completed
utilizing these constructs and their association within the
management literature. To date, there are many works dedi-
cated to these constructs within and out of sport, but there is
a dearth of literature dedicated to examining these constructs
in the avocational context. We contended that there may be
differences in attitudes and behaviors in the context of the
avocation of youth sport officiating compared with those
officials who choose to officiate as full-time employment.
Formalized Training
Sport organizations are heavily dependent on their human
resources as the sport industry is very much a service
industry (Chelladurai, 2006; Flagestad & Hope, 2001). To
provide optimal service in all facets of the sport industry,
each organization is vying for the best employees to create a
premium product or service. The same holds true within
youth sport as these organizations actively seek employees
who can create an environment for safe youth sport partici-
pation. To offer an opportunity for youth to become involved,
there is a need for everyone within the organization to work
together as cohesively as possible. As such, the focus of
many organizations and its managers should be the employ-
ees or those who are vested within the organization (Eys &
Carron, 2001). To that end, formalized training of employees
within the organization seems necessary in controlling qual-
ity, creating organizational culture, and retaining employees
(Anderson, Rungtusanatham, Schroeder, & Devaraj, 2007).
Furthermore, training employees leads to tenure and organi-
zational commitment, which are both positive outcomes that
improve quality and productivity within the organization
(Chelladurai, 2006). Winterton (2004) suggested employees
who are committed to the organization and have intentions to
stay within the organization for an extended period of time
seek training opportunities. These outcomes of training have
been studied within a perspective of full-time employees
within organizations in and outside of sport. Within the con-
text of this study, it was the purpose to explore levels formal-
ized training on individuals who are employed within an
avocation of choice. Therefore, it is important to assess the
amount of time dedicated to training on the avocation of
youth sport officials in attempts to understand the influences
of formalized training on quality of work outcomes. Job sat-
isfaction, pay satisfaction, and intentions to leave the organi-
zation are pertinent quality of work outcomes that have been
found to influence the individual and the overall quality and
production of the overall organization (Judge, Thoresen,
Bono, & Patton, 2001). As such, each of the aforementioned
constructs will be outlined in an attempt to illustrate the
rationale of importance of training on these quality of work
outcomes.
Job Satisfaction and Intentions to Leave
Scholars and practitioners alike have an esteemed interest in
job satisfaction due to its association to the individual and
organizational outcomes (Judge, Locke, Durham, & Kluger,
1998). Hamermesh (2002) contended that job satisfaction is
the most relevant construct used to measure the individual's
attitudes toward the job position, organization, and outside
opportunities within the industry. From this, job satisfaction
globally encompasses the individual's attitudes and well-
being gleaned from the job. Within the sport officiating con-
text, the demands may be quite intense as officials not only
adhere to the internal demands of the contest (e.g., fairness
and player safety) but also the environmental extensions
(e.g., coaches and fans) of the contest as well (Dale &
Weinberg, 1990). As such, relevant works dedicated to job
satisfaction have suggested that those who report lower
Ryan et al. 3
levels of job satisfaction have higher absenteeism and are
more likely to leave the organization (Nagy, 2002).
Furthermore, job satisfaction relates to overall firm perfor-
mance as those firms who maintain a higher level of job sat-
isfaction within their employees generally have higher
productivity rates (Harter, Schmidt, & Hayes, 2002). Yet,
within the context of this study, it was important to identify
the influence of job satisfaction of individuals who were
involved in youth sport officiating as an avocation. To date,
there is a dearth of literature dedicated to this area of sport.
Within the general business management literature, part-time
workers are generally more dissatisfied with their jobs than
full-time workers (Steffy & Jones, 2006). As such, it was
deemed timely to identify job satisfaction levels of officials
whose avocation is in youth sport. Reasons as to why part-
time workers, or those employed within an avocation, may
be understudied, is due to the general focus of scholars on
full-time management and those positions occupied by full-
time employees (e.g., coaches). Within the avocation of offi-
ciating, turnover of officials may create instability from
season to season resulting in diluting the quality of officiat-
ing within youth sport. As aforementioned, officiating is dire
to the safety and overall execution of the contest, thus quality
and experience are a necessity. Within this sport context, it is
pertinent to identify the levels of job satisfaction of youth
sport officials, as differential management strategies may be
needed for the development and retention of qualified
officials.
Pay Satisfaction and Intentions to Leave
Similar to job satisfaction, pay satisfaction of an individual
has been a principal focus of work quality outcomes of many
organizational behavior researchers. Griffeth, Hom, and
Gaetner (2000) contended that pay satisfaction is linked to
individual turnover intentions, which is of much concern to
youth sport organizations as many individuals within the
avocation of youth sport have low retention rates. In addi-
tion, relevant works within pay satisfaction suggest that the
individual utilizes social referents to determine satisfaction
with pay (Ryan & Sagas, 2009; Williams, McDaniel, &
Nguyen, 2006). For example, individuals assess their pay
satisfaction based on their individual contributions (e.g.,
hours worked) and compensation to those of other employ-
ees who perform similar job duties. Furthermore, pay satis-
faction is often a measure of what one receives in comparison
with what they would like to receive (Tang, 1995). As such,
pay satisfaction is heavily reliant upon distributive justice
within the profession. This example of pay satisfaction fits
well when analyzing individuals who are in a job that is out-
side their primary career choice, as these individuals may
value their extra time expecting to be compensated according
to their hours devoted to officiating in youth sport.
Alternatively, within the framework of this particular study,
these individuals choosing to officiate as an avocation may
have different perspectives in pay satisfaction. For example,
a sport official whose primary profession is in litigation may
not be concerned with the amount of money earned within a
season of officiating, and may not use social referents as a
basis of pay satisfaction. This individual may be involved in
youth sport officiating as an escape from the rigorous
demands of their primary employment, but still may have an
optimal level of pay that will satisfy their efforts within the
avocation of officiating. As such, it is important to explore
pay satisfaction within the avocation of sport officials and its
relationship, if any, to formalized training of sport officials.
Method
Participants
This study was part of a larger investigation that examined
perceptions of high school officiating as an avocation. In this
portion of the study, only volleyball and basketball officials
were selected as an appropriate sample due to similarities in
seasonal play, the number of opportunities to officiate games,
and the total number of officials available to officiate during
these seasons. Furthermore, basketball and volleyball serve
as ideal sports because opportunities to officiate for women
are higher than other sports such as high school football
(Casey, 1992). A large Southwestern state was chosen for its
availability and size. The state high school officiating asso-
ciation's member database was used to contact officials via
broadcast email asking them to respond to the web-based
survey (n = 1,075). After 2 weeks had passed, a second
broadcast email was sent out as a reminder and prompt to
respond to the web-based questionnaire. Of this sample,
between volleyball and basketball officials, n = 926 usable
responses were gathered, resulting in an approximate 86%
response rate. A large portion of those officials who
responded were male 83% (n = 770). In addition, a large
number of the respondents classified themselves as Caucasian
62.5% (n = 575), while 20.8% (n = 191) classified them-
selves as African American, 15.5% (n = 138) Asian, 0.8% (n
= 8) Latino, and 0.4% (n = 4) as Other.
Measures
All participants who completed the questionnaire were asked
to respond to demographic questions (sex, ethnicity, age) and
to respond to items related to satisfaction with their jobs, pay,
and intentions to leave the avocation of officiating. All multi-
item measure items were measured utilizing a 7-point Likert-
type scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). In
addition, respondents were asked to approximate the number
of hours per season dedicated to training within their avoca-
tion. Forty hours was used as the dividing time as it most was
closest to the middle point for dividing officials into two
groups. Those officials who dedicated less than 40 hr were
categorized into a "low training group" (n = 492), whereas
4 SAGE Open
those officials who spent 40 or more hours were categorized
into a "high training group" (n = 434).
Job satisfaction was assessed with three items based on
Hackman and Oldham's (1975) measure. An example item
from the scale is "All in all I am satisfied with my job." The
reliability estimate produced by the scale for this sample was
( = .81) and is considered acceptable.
To assess pay satisfaction, the Pay Satisfaction
Questionnaire (Judge & Welbourne, 1994) was utilized. An
example item from the four-item scale is "All in all I am
satisfied with my take home pay." As with the job satisfac-
tion construct, the reliability of the multi-item scale for this
sample was ( = .77) and is considered acceptable (Nunnally
& Bernsein, 1994).
Finally to measure individual respondent's intentions to
leave the avocation of officiating, turnover intentions were
measured through a three-item scale (Jaros, 1997). An exam-
ple item of the turnover intentions scale is "All in all I often
think about leaving the avocation of officiating." The con-
struct reliability for this particular sample was ( = .88).
Data Analysis
As noted above, reliability estimates (Cronbach's ) were
computed for each of the multi-item measures on the ques-
tionnaire, and means and standard deviation were calculated
for the multi-item measures. See Table 1 for these descriptive
statistics, including correlations and reliability estimates. To
explore the relationships between levels of formalized train-
ing on the quality of work outcomes, we conducted a three-
way MANOVA. This analysis was deemed appropriate due
to the number of the dependent variables (DVs) under study,
and the differences in levels of formalized training (Hair,
Black, Babin, Anderson, & Tatham, 2006). The level of for-
malized training served as the independent variable (IV),
whereas job satisfaction, pay satisfaction, and intentions to
leave were operationalized as the DVs.
Results
The MANOVA procedures revealed a significant multivari-
ate effect for the three latent variables as a group in relation
to the level of training of the officials within the data set
Wilks's  = .96, F(3, 922) = 14.14, p < .001. Results indi-
cated significant effects for level of formalized training with
respect to job satisfaction, F(1, 924) = 19.68, p < .001, 2 =
.02; pay satisfaction, F(1, 924) = 14.04, p < .001, 2 = .02;
and intentions to leave the avocation of officiating, F(1, 916)
= 7.37, p < .01, 2 = .01. From these results, we were able to
identify officials who were in the high-level training groups
(M = 6.37, SD = 0.58) were more satisfied with their avoca-
tion, than those who were in the low training group (M =
6.18, SD = 0.58). In addition, officials who were in the high
training group (M = 3.29, SD = 1.12) were less satisfied with
their pay, whereas those in the low training group (M = 3.56,
SD = 1.14) showed signs of higher pay satisfaction. Finally,
in regard to intentions to leave the avocation, officials in the
high training group (M = 2.36, SD = 1.27) were overall less
likely to leave officiating, whereas those in the low training
group (M = 2.59, SD = 1.28) were more likely to leave the
avocation.
Discussion
The results of this study suggest that formalized training cor-
relates with various meaningful work outcomes. Small but
significant effects were observed between an official's train-
ing amount and their job satisfaction, pay satisfaction, and
intention to leave the officiating profession. These results
suggest some alignment with past research, and should be of
some significance to administrators. One possible interpreta-
tion of the results is that those officials with higher level of
training experience significantly more job satisfaction, have
lower turnover intentions, but also greater dissatisfaction
with pay.
In inspecting the results for each DV, the outcome aligns
with past research in that individuals who receive more train-
ing often report greater job satisfaction, and thus, lower turn-
over intentions (Natarajan & Nagar, 2011). Moreover, and of
interest, is that referees who have logged more hours in train-
ing may feel that they should be paid more. This can be seen
as confirmation with some organizational justice theories in
satisfaction (DeConick & Stillwell, 2004), where individuals
feel satisfaction when their inputs are approximately equal to
what they receive. Likewise, those officials who are in the
lower training group reported greater satisfaction with pay.
Unfortunately, the relationship between training and the
three examined outcomes need to be evaluated together, and
not individually. This justifies looking at the unusual find-
ings of those in the higher training group reporting lower pay
satisfaction. However, as might be expected, higher training
correlated with higher job satisfaction. This unusual relation-
ship may be partially due to the avocation nature of officials,
as referees may enjoy the work they are doing, but may not
feel they are adequately rewarded for the hours and training
that they put into their work. In addition, it is worth noting
that officials, like many volunteers, have some amount of

control of when they work, and as important, when they do
not work. In this way, they may act as free agents, as they
may have some autonomy in selecting the schools, confer-
ences, and sports that they work with. From a theoretical per-
spective, this research is significant as it looks at pay and job
satisfaction in jobs that are avocations, and it is suggested
here that from a theoretical and practical perspective, the
levers that motivate and satisfy workers will not be similar.
In addition, this research is quite meaningful in sport
organizations as many operate with a significant number of
volunteers or part-time workers (Chelladurai, 2006). It is
quite possible that many workers within sport enter to be
involved with the teams, kids, organizations, or sport, and
while pay might not be necessary to retain these employees,
training may improve satisfaction for these workers.
Therefore, a meaningful application for this research is for
managers to invest in training for officials, coaches, and vol-
unteers, especially when pay is limited or control by school
or organizational limits.
Furthermore, it is suggested that much of this research
could be replicated to youth, high school, and college coaches
who enjoy investing time and energy into a sport organiza-
tion, and find their work satisfying, yet might find that the
pay received for their job is not aligning with their percep-
tions of their inputs (Covell, 2012). Again, it is suggested
that for these individuals, when pay is limited, training and
other items may help compensate, and further research could
be done on what areas help satisfy coaches, officials, and
others in avocation-type jobs when pay is limited. In addi-
tion, it would be interesting to see what effect role salience
has on officials as we suggest that individuals who identify
stronger with their role of official also are the ones more
likely to receive extra training and greater satisfaction in the
job they do. It is suggested that future research examine simi-
lar constructs among high school coaches as many of these
coaches will work a full-time job in teaching, but identify
with, further training in, and find more satisfaction within
their part-time coaching role (Ryan & Sagas, 2006).
A main strength to this research is the examination of a
prominent cog of the athletic event--the official. While other
researchers have examined the athlete and the coach, exami-
nation of officials has not been undertaken. We hope that this
research is foundational, not only for officials but also for
studying quality of work factors for those in a part-time job
or avocation. An additional strength is the large sample size
and high response rate from the officials. However, as with
any research, limitations should be considered when evaluat-
ing results. One limitation is the limited amount of variance
explained for each of the DVs as R2 = 2% for largest value.
In addition, the cross-sectional nature of web-based survey
would suggest stronger results may be found with longitudi-
nal research.
As mentioned above, future research should consider
examination of other groups within sport who work full-time
jobs, but work part-time jobs within sport. Within this, an
examination of role salience might be a meaningful area to
consider, especially when considering quality of work out-
comes like job satisfaction, organizational and occupational
commitment, and turnover intentions.
