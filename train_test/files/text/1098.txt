Background. Few studies focus on ``preclinical'' warning signs associated with mortality. In this article, we investigate
associations between all-cause mortality and two clusters of biological risk factors: (i) standard clinical measures related to
cardiovascular disease and metabolic function; and (ii) nonclinical measures pertaining to hypothalamic­pituitary­adrenal
axis activity, sympathetic nervous system activity, and inflammatory response.
Methods. Data come from the 2000 Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study, a national sample of
Taiwanese persons aged 54 years or older; 1497 persons were interviewed in their homes, and 1023 participated in
a hospital examination. The analysis is based on 927 respondents with complete information. Logistic regression models
describe the association between biomarkers and the 3-year probability of dying.
Results. Although both groups of biomarkers are significantly associated with mortality, the model with
neuroendocrine and immune biomarkers has better explanatory and discriminatory power than the one with clinical
measures. The association between these nonclinical measures and mortality remains strong after adjustment for the
clinical markers, suggesting that the physiological effects of the nonclinical biomarkers are broader than those captured by
the cardiovascular and metabolic system measures included here.
Conclusions. Nonclinical markers are likely to provide warning signs of deteriorating health and function beyond what
can be learned from conventional markers. Our findings are consistent with those of recent studies that (i) demonstrate the
importance of neuroendocrine and immune system markers for survival, and (ii) indicate that standard clinical variables
are less predictive of mortality in older than in younger populations.
VAST literatures investigate the associations between
clinical risk factors and specific diseases, and again,
between those diseases and subsequent mortality risk. Fewer
studies directly examine associations between clinical risk
factors and mortality (1,2), and even fewer focus on ``pre-
clinical'' warning signs associated with mortality, although
research in this area has been increasing (3­10).
In this article, we focus on the link between biological risk
factors and mortality for an older population. We examine
all-cause mortality because, as a consequence of multiple
comorbidities, prediction of specific diseases is especially
problematic at these older ages (11). Rather than concentrat-
ing on individual biological risk factors, we focus on two
clusters. The first comprises standard clinical risk factors
related to cardiovascular and metabolic function: obesity,
blood pressure, lipids, and glucose metabolism. The sec-
ond cluster--which we denote ``nonclinical'' measures--
comprisescortisol,dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate(DHEA-S),
epinephrine, norepinephrine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), insulin-
like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and dopamine. Biomarkers in
this latter group are not usually measured in medical exam-
inations; most do not have well-established clinical cutoffs.
The two clusters are motivated by a theoretical framework
(12,13) that hypothesizes that chronic exposure to stressors
results in prolonged dysregulation of ``primary mediators''
(represented by the nonclinical cluster), leading to abnormal
values for ``secondary outcomes'' (represented by the
standard clinical cluster) and ultimately, disease and death.
We compare the performance of the two clusters in
predicting mortality over a 3-year follow-up period.
METHODS
Data Collection
The data come from the 2000 Social Environment and
Biomarkers of Aging Study (SEBAS), which is based on
a random subsample of respondents 54 years old or older
who were interviewed as part of the nationally representa-
tive Survey of Health and Living Status in Taiwan (14).
SEBAS included an in-home interview and a hospital visit.
Written informed consent was obtained for participation in
both components.
On a scheduled day several weeks after the in-home inter-
view, participants collected a 12-hour overnight urine sample,
fasted overnight, and visited a nearby hospital the following
morning where medical personnel drew a blood specimen
and took blood pressure and anthropometric measurements.
Compliance was extremely high (i.e., 95.7% fasted overnight
and provided a urine specimen deemed suitable for analysis).

Among the 1713 respondents selected for SEBAS, 1497
provided interviews (92% of survivors) and 1023 partici-
pated in the physical examination (68% of those inter-
viewed). Disproportionately high nonparticipation rates
were found among the healthiest and least healthy respon-
dents. Overall, persons who received the medical examina-
tion reported the same average health status (on a 5-point
scale) as those who did not. Although respondents older
than 70 years were less likely than younger persons to par-
ticipate, sex and measures of socioeconomic status were not
significantly related to participation. These results suggest
that, in the presence of controls for age, estimates based on
the biomarkers are unlikely to be seriously biased (14).
Survival status was ascertained in 2003 by linking to the
Household Registration file of the Taiwanese Ministry of
Interior. Among the 1023 examination participants, there
were 72 verified deaths by 2003 and 14 respondents with
unknown vital status in 2003. After excluding persons with
missing vital status (14), missing data on explanatory
variables (65), and proxy interviews (17), the analysis sample
comprised 927 respondents (866 survivors and 61 deaths).
Explanatory Variables
The 13 biomarkers examined in this study were included
in SEBAS because of their hypothesized association with
stressful experiences and chronic disease. They comprise six
standard clinical indicators of cardiovascular risk and
metabolic activity and seven nonclinical biomarkers related
to hypothalamic­pituitary­adrenal (HPA) axis activity,
sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, and inflamma-
tory response.
Blood and urine specimens were analyzed at Union
Clinical Laboratories (UCL) in Taipei. In addition to routine
standardization and calibration tests performed by the
laboratory staff, during the early stages of fieldwork nine
individuals outside of the sample contributed triplicate sets
of specimens: Two sets were submitted to UCL, and a third
set was sent to Quest Diagnostics in the United States for the
purpose of checking laboratory reliability.
Systolic and diastolic blood pressures (in mmHg) were
measured as the average of two seated blood pressure
readings taken with a mercury sphygmomanometer at least
20 minutes after the respondent arrived at the hospital. The
body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight divided by
height squared (kg/m2). Measures of IGF-1, IL-6, DHEA-S,
total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) choles-
terol, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were obtained
from the fasting blood sample. Epinephrine, norepinephrine,
cortisol, and dopamine measurements were based on the 12-
hour overnight urine sample to provide integrated values of
basal operating levels during a time that most participants
were resting; they are measured in micrograms per gram
(lg/g) creatinine to adjust for body size. The assays used to
measure the biomarkers derived from the blood and urine
samples are described elsewhere (15).
We included age in 2000 (which ranges between 54 and
91), sex, and urban or rural residence as demographic control
variables (and to adjust for the sampling design). Because of
potential reverse causality (i.e., the possibility that prior
health may influence biomarkers), we incorporated extensive
controls for health in 2000. These comprise (i) measures of
chronic conditions, mobility limitations, global self-rated
health, depressive symptoms, and cognitive function; (ii) a 5-
point measure of the respondent's typical level of pain; and
(iii) a dummy variable indicating whether the respondent
smoked in the past 6 months.
The measure of current illness counts the number (0­12)
of chronic conditions reported by the respondent including:
high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, cancer or
malignant tumor, lower respiratory tract disease, arthritis or
rheumatism, gastric ulcer or stomach ailment, liver or gall
bladder disease, cataracts, kidney disease, gout, and spinal
or vertebral spurs. The measure of mobility limitations
counts the number (0­9) of physical tasks that the re-
spondent reported difficulty performing without aid in-
cluding: standing continuously for 15 minutes and for 2
hours, squatting, raising both hands over the head, grasping
or turning objects with the fingers, lifting or carrying an
object weighing 11­12 kg, running a short distance (20­30
meters), walking 200­300 meters, and climbing two or three
flights of stairs. Global self-rated health is described by
a three-category reformulation of the conventional 5-point
ordinal scale (excellent/good; average; not-so-good/poor).
Depressive symptoms are measured by a 10-item short-form
of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale
(CES-D), coded according to standard practice (potential
range 0­30). Previous studies have demonstrated that
a shortened form of the CES-D yields similar internal
consistency, factor structure, and accuracy in detecting
depressive symptoms as the full 20-item CES-D among
elderly Chinese people (16). Cognitive function is a count of
cognitive tasks completed correctly, including basic orien-
tation questions, a series of four subtractions, and immediate
memory recall (potential range 0­24).
Analytic Strategy
We estimated a series of four logistic regression models
to describe the associations between the biomarkers and
the probability of dying over a 3-year period (2000­2003).
Because the clustered sampling design may lead to under-
estimates of standard errors, we incorporated random effects
for the primary sampling units. A baseline model includes the
demographic and health control variables. The standard
clinical markers are added in Model 1; the nonclinical
biomarkers replace the clinical measures in Model 2. Model 3
includes both sets of biomarkers. All biomarkers are specified
as continuous variables. Because outliers can have a sub-
stantial influence on the parameter estimates, we recoded 25
biomarker values in the study sample that were larger than
five standard deviations from the mean to equal this cut point.
We explored the inclusion of linear and quadratic terms in
the models, because both low and high values of some
measures (e.g., BMI, cortisol, diastolic blood pressure, and
epinephrine) have been shown to be associated with adverse
health outcomes (17). We included a quadratic term if two
conditions were satisfied: (i) the quadratic term was sig-
nificant (p , .05) in a model that included only that
biomarker along with age and sex; and (ii) the quadratic term
remained marginally significant (p , .10) in a model that
included all control variables, all biomarkers, and the qua-
1071
PREDICTING MORTALITY FROM BIOMARKERS
dratic terms satisfying the first condition. We excluded the
quadratic term for systolic blood pressure because of its high
correlation (0.7) with diastolic blood pressure, and because
the literature suggests that the relationship between systolic
blood pressure and mortality is monotonic (18). Because of
the limited sample size, we do not include interaction terms in
these models--for example, to capture potentially different
effects of the biomarkers on mortality by sex or age.
In addition to identifying significant coefficients, we
provide statistical comparisons of Model 1 (the standard
clinical model) and Model 2 (the nonclinical biomarker
model). We use likelihood-ratio tests for nested models to
ascertain the joint significance of the set of standard or
nonclinical markers. In addition, we calculate the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve to evaluate the accu-
racy of the models in discriminating between decedents and
survivors (19). For a given model, the ROC curve compares
the probability that the regression equation correctly predicts
death for persons who died (sensitivity) with the probability
of an incorrect prediction among survivors (1 À specificity)
across the entire range of possible cut points. We use the area
under the ROC curve (AUC) to summarize the performance
of a model (higher values indicate better accuracy) and
compare AUC values between models based on a chi-square
test (20). All analyses were performed using Stata 8.2 (21).
RESULTS
Average values and standard deviations of the demo-
graphic variables and biomarkers are shown in Table 1.
Estimates from the logistic models are shown in Table 2.
The baseline model (incorporating only the demographic
and health controls) is not shown, but statistics derived from
this model are presented in a footnote to the table.
Models 1 and 2 reveal that, despite the small number of
deaths, numerous biomarkers are significantly (p , .05)
related to survival: BMI, diastolic blood pressure, and
HbA1c for the clinical factors; and epinephrine and IL-6 for
the neuroendocrine and immune markers. The association
with mortality is positive for HbA1c and IL-6, whereas for
BMI, epinephrine, and diastolic blood pressure, both high
and low values are associated with higher death rates than
are intermediate values. The odds ratios change slightly
when both sets of factors are included in Model 3; HbA1c is
no longer significant at the .05 level.
Likelihood ratio tests suggest that both sets of biomarkers
are significantly related to survival. Comparisons of Models
1 and 2 with the baseline model indicate that inclusion of
either set of biomarkers significantly improves the model
(p ¼ .04 for the standard clinical markers and p , .001 for
the nonclinical markers). Similarly, in comparison with the
full model (Model 3), removal of either set of markers
results in a significantly poorer fit (p ¼ .04 for the clinical
measures and p , .001 for the nonclinical ones).
Two comparative assessments provide evidence that the
nonclinical biomarker model is superior to the standard
clinical one. First, the nonclinical biomarker model has
a substantially larger pseudo R2 value (0.26 vs 0.21) despite
having the same number of parameters, suggesting better
explanatory power (19). Second, the ROC curves depicted
in Figure 1 illustrate the better discriminatory power of the
nonclinical biomarker model. Chi-square tests indicate that
the nonclinical model has a significantly higher AUC than
the baseline model (0.852 vs 0.790, p , .01), whereas the
difference between the standard clinical and baseline models
is not significant (0.808 vs 0.790, p ¼ .23). The difference
in AUC between the clinical and nonclinical models is
marginally significant (p , .09). Although it is plausible
that the superior performance of the neuroendocrine and
immune measures results from correlation between the
clinical markers and self-reported health measures, the re-
sults remain essentially unchanged when we exclude
controls for health in 2000.
DISCUSSION
In this population-based study of older Taiwanese in-
dividuals, both standard clinical markers of cardiovascular
and metabolic function and nonclinical biomarkers of HPA-
axis, SNS, and immune activity are significantly associated
with all-cause mortality. An unanticipated finding is that the
neuroendocrine and immune markers are better predictors of
mortality than the conventional risk factors. The notion that
``primary mediators'' affect disease largely through their
effects on ``secondary outcomes'' is not supported by our
results: The associations between nonclinical biomarkers and
mortality change little after adjustment for conventional bio-
markers. These findings strongly suggest that neuroendocrine
and immune dysregulation may represent more than a pre-
cursor to clinical decline as captured by the cardiovascular
and metabolic system measures included in this analysis.

Although there are few, if any, population-based studies
in East Asian populations to corroborate our results, several
recent community-based studies in the United States under-
score the potential importance of markers of immune
activity and inflammation for the functioning and survival
of older persons. The Framingham Heart Study revealed that
high levels of circulating IL-6 and low levels of IGF-1 were
associated with increased mortality after adjustment for
important clinical conditions (9); similar results were ob-
tained for a cohort of older women in the Women's Health
and Aging Study (4). The Iowa 65þ Rural Health Study
indicated that higher IL-6 levels were associated with
substantially greater risk of death (5).
Estimates from Western populations also suggest that
HPA-axis and SNS activity are related to survival. Although
most studies document linkages between cortisol levels and
the presence of chronic conditions and illnesses, cortisol
levels have been shown to be predictive of mortality among
adults who suffered an acute myocardial infarction (22) or
a stroke (6,23). DHEA-S, which is believed to counterbalance
the effects of cortisol, is associated with mortality risks among
men (7,10). Older persons with high baseline urinary ex-
cretion of epinephrine or norepinephrine in the MacArthur
Studies of Successful Aging had higher risks of dying (8).
The greater importance of nonclinical as compared with
standard risk factors for older-age mortality is consistent
with findings that conventional clinical measures are less
predictive of morbidity and mortality among elderly persons
than among younger persons. For example, higher levels of
cholesterol and blood pressure are generally related to
higher adult mortality, but at older ages the relationship has
been U-shaped or sometimes inverse (24­26). Research also
suggests that the relationship of BMI with mortality
weakens at older ages (27).
A limitation of the present study is the small number of
deaths. The low statistical power makes it impossible to rule
out associations between specific biomarkers and survival
or to assess the relative importance of different individual
markers. A second limitation pertains to nonresponse: The
selective exclusion of the healthiest and most disabled re-
spondents from the medical examination portion of the
study may lead to biased estimates. In addition, because of

PREDICTING MORTALITY FROM BIOMARKERS
both genetic and environmental variation, there are ques-
tions regarding the generalizability of our results to Western
populations. For example, previous studies have docu-
mented that: (i) the distributions of the biomarkers included
in this analysis, especially the clinical measures, differ
between Taiwan and the United States (28), and (ii) the
effects of clinical biomarkers on mortality are likely to vary
across populations (29).
Nonetheless, the findings of this study are sufficiently
robust to suggest that, taken as a group, the neuroendocrine
and immune markers are important predictors of future
survival. They are likely to provide additional warning signs
of deteriorating health and function above and beyond what
can be learned from standard clinical measures. That is,
these markers may indicate risk even when the clinical
markers do not, suggesting that they may represent a direct
pathway to mortality. At the same time, the results are not
sufficient to warrant the inclusion of these nonclinical mea-
sures in a standard diagnostic toolkit. We have little infor-
mation regarding what constitutes normal or abnormal
levels of these markers, a limited understanding of the extent
to which changes over time reflect normal processes of
aging or are causally linked to health and survival, and few
notions about how to modify levels of these markers (or,
indeed, whether modification would ultimately enhance
survival). With additional research, we are virtually certain
to witness an expansion of the list of clinically assessed
measures that are predictive of future survival.
