Abstract: Cross-culturally, participants in public goods games reward participants and
punish defectors to a degree beyond that warranted by rational, profit-maximizing
considerations. Costly punishment, where individuals impose costs on defectors at a cost to
themselves, is thought to promote the maintenance of cooperation. However, despite
substantial variation in the extent to which people punish, little is known about why some
individuals, and not others, choose to pay these costs. Here, we test whether personality
traits might contribute to variation in helping and punishment behavior. We first replicate a
previous study using public goods scenarios to investigate effects of sex, relatedness and
likelihood of future interaction on willingness to help a group member or to punish a
transgressor. As in the previous study, we find that individuals are more willing to help
related than unrelated needy others and that women are more likely to express desire to
help than men. Desire to help was higher if the probability of future interaction is high, at
least among women. In contrast, among these variables, only participant sex predicted
some measures of punitive sentiment. Extending the replication, we found that punitive
sentiment, but not willingness to help, was predicted by personality traits. Most notably,
participants scoring lower on Agreeableness expressed more anger towards and greater
desire to punish a transgressor, and were more willing to engage in costly punishment, at
least in our scenario. Our results suggest that some personality traits may contribute to
underpinning individual variation in social enforcement of cooperation.

Introduction
The evolution of cooperation is a problem of great interest not only to a wide range
of evolutionary and behavioral disciplines, but also to policy makers and society at large
(Hardin, 1968). Established partial solutions to this problem include kin altruism
(Hamilton, 1964), reciprocal altruism (Axelrod and Hamilton, 1981; Trivers, 1971),
reputation building (Alexander, 1987) and costly signaling (Zahavi, 1995). However, there
remain several puzzling aspects in human cooperative behavior that seem to defy
explanation by any of these mechanisms (e.g., Bowles and Gintis, 2002; Fehr, Firschbacher
and Gächter, 2002; Fehr and Gächter, 2000, 2002). These behaviors arise in the context of
experimental games which are intentionally structured so as to ensure that participants'
behavior cannot be logically attributed to any of the standard explanations of cooperation.
Players are total strangers to each other (excludes kin altruism), they make their decisions
anonymously (excludes reputation building and costly signaling) and they only interact
with each other once (excludes reciprocal altruism) although the latter condition may not
perfectly capture real-world conditions, especially those in the ancestral past, where
probability of future interaction would very rarely have been zero (see Burnham and
Johnson, 2005; Hagen and Hammerstein, 2006; Trivers, 2004). Despite this, they still
choose to reward participants and punish defectors in ways that are irrational from the
viewpoint of calculating, self-interested agents who organize their behavior around income
maximization (Fehr et al., 2002; Price, Cosmides, and Tooby, 2002). These puzzling results
have been replicated with participants drawn from a wide range of cultures around the
world (Henrich et al., 2006).
For example, the public goods paradigm (Egas and Riedl, 2008; Fehr and Gächter,
2000, 2002) typically involves participants who are given a number of monetary units
(MU) at the start of the experiment, of which they can contribute any portion they want to a
collective group project. Every MU invested by a player yields a payoff of less than 1 MU
for every group member, while every MU withheld by a player yields a payoff of exactly 1
MU for that particular player and 0 MU for the other players. This payoff structure ensures
that while all players would come out with a positive return to their investment if they
invested their entire endowment to the common project, any single player can do even
better by withholding funds from the project while reaping the benefits of the other players'
contributions. All contributions are made simultaneously, they are anonymous, and the
groups are broken up at the end of every round, such that no two participants ever play with
each other more than once. At the end of every round participants are informed about the
other members' contributions to the project (though not their identities) and can choose, at
their own personal expense, to punish other members for not contributing to the project.
For example participants might be allowed to give up 1 MU in order to deprive another
player of 3 MU (Fehr and Gächter, 2002). Given the rules of the game a rational, self-
interested player should never punish, yet players do routinely punish fellow players who
make below-average contributions. Since all interactions are one-off and the punisher can
never directly benefit from any subsequent change in the punished player's cooperative
behavior, this type of behavior is often described as `altruistic punishment' (Bowles and
Gintis, 2002; Egas and Riedl, 2008; Fehr and Gächter, 2002). This sort of punishment has
Who punishes?
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(1). 2013. -188-
beneficial effects in sustaining high investment levels, as punished members raise their
contributions in subsequent rounds, even though they interact with new players in each
round. This surprising outcome stands in stark contrast to the no-punishment condition of
the game, where players are not allowed to punish free-riders. In this condition cooperation
gradually dwindles, with most participants eventually contributing nothing to the project
(Fehr and Firschbacher, 2004; Fehr and Gächter, 2002).
Results like this have led to the emergence of `strong reciprocity' as a general term
to describe humans' tendency to punish defectors and reward co-operators beyond what is
warranted by rational choice theory (Fehr et al., 2002; Gintis, 2000; Gintis, Henrich,
Bowles, Boyd, and Fehr, 2008) and where other standard evolutionary explanations do not
apply. There is yet no consensus as to the evolutionary significance of this phenomenon
(Gintis et al., 2008; Kiyonari and Barclay, 2008; Price, 2008; Price et al., 2002; Sigmund,
2007), but one suggestion is that it may have evolved by enforcing cooperation between
group members, with selection acting at the level of human groups (Boyd, Gintis, Bowles,
and Richerson, 2003; Fehr et al., 2002; Gintis et al., 2008).
Previous studies indicate remarkable variation in individual engagement in both
costly punishment and helping (Barclay, 2006; O'Gorman, Wilson, and Miller, 2005), and
there is growing interest in the sources of this individual variation (Bergmüller, Schürch,
and Hamilton, 2010). Indeed, this is true of behavior in experimental games in general. For
example, there is widespread heterogeneity in rejection of offers in the ultimatum game
(Fehr and Schmidt, 1999) and this appears to be under significant genetic influence
(Wallace, Cesarini, Lichtenstein, and Johannesson, 2007). Wallace et al. (2007) argue that
this variation may contribute to the mixed success that has met attempts to find satisfactory
correlates of behavior in experimental games, and that further efforts should explore links
between behavior in economic games and the significant source of variation in behavior
that derives from personality traits. Likewise, Bergmüller et al. (2010) highlight the
potential role of personality (or `behavioral syndromes') in determining individual
differences in cooperative behavior in animals.
The aim of this study was to explicitly investigate these possible links between
personality traits and variation in helping and punishment behaviors. We framed our study
within evolutionarily informed theories of personality that suggest that variance in human
personality traits can be attributed to selective advantages of different responses to
recurrent social problems faced by our ancestors (Buss, 1984, 1991; Michalski and
Shackelford, 2010). Consequently, each trait can be considered to be a result of various
trade-offs; for instance, individuals scoring high in extraversion report more sexual partners
but also more injuries (Nettle, 2005). In this light, it is reasonable to question how
personality traits help to shape individual behavior in the face of social dilemmas
(Michalski and Shackelford, 2010). Here, motivated by growing recognition of the
possibility that personality traits underpin at least some variation in cooperation in humans
and animals (Wallace et al., 2007; Bergmüller et al., 2010), we investigate the role of
personality in shaping behavior in social scenarios calling for cooperative responses or
responses to a social transgression in a cooperative setting.
To do this, we set out to replicate and extend the design of O'Gorman et al. (2005)
that tested individuals' desire to help or punish in various hypothetical scenarios. These
Who punishes?
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(1). 2013. -189-
scenarios elicited marked individual variation in willingness to help and punish. In their
study, desire to help an unfortunate other was influenced by both relatedness and
probability of future interaction, as predicted by evolutionary considerations. Individuals
were more willing to help relatives than strangers, and more willing to help if there was
high probability of future interactions. In contrast, desire to punish free-riders was
moderated by neither of these variables, leading O'Gorman et al. to conclude that altruistic
helping and punishing behavior were underpinned by different proximate psychological
factors. Willingness to engage in punishment might therefore be influenced either by
contextual variables not captured in O'Gorman et al.'s study, or by other causes of
individual variation such as personality traits. Here, we specifically focused on this second
potential source of variation ­ personality traits. Following general predictions about
possible costs and benefits of each of the Big Five Model domains proposed by Nettle
(2006), we considered how these domains might relate to tendency to engage in
punishment. In particular, we predicted that willingness to punish might be specifically
driven by variation along the Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and
Neuroticism domains. It is well established that variation in these domains affects social
interactions across various contexts. For example, Extraversion is intrinsically linked to
engagement in social interactions. With regard to Agreeableness, the lower end of the
dimension is characterized by descriptors such as hostility and spitefulness. Those scoring
low on this dimension are less likely to compromise during inter-personal conflicts, while
those scoring high receive higher levels of peer acceptance, have more mutual friends and
better outcomes in cooperative tasks (Jensen-Campbell, Adams, Perry, Workman, Furdella,
and Egan, 2002; Jensen-Campbell and Graziano, 2001; Koole, van den Berg, Vlek, and
Hofstee, 2001). Nettle (2006) highlights that larger and looser social groupings will select
for lower Agreeableness than smaller, closer ones. People scoring high on
Conscientiousness tend to favor social norms (McCrae and John, 1992), exhibit strong
moral principle (Nettle, 2006) and have higher peer acceptance (Jensen-Campbell and
Malcolm, 2007). Finally, individuals who score highly on Neuroticism may experience
anger more readily, which may lead to increased engagement in costly punishment (Seip,
van Dijk, and Rotteveel, 2009).
Materials and Methods
Participants
We recruited 211 participants (104 male, 97 female, 10 not reported) who were
visitors to a local science museum. Participants were aged between 16 and 78 years (M ±
SD; 33.3 ± 12.6). This is a wider range than that in O'Gorman et al.'s (2005) study,
allowing us to generalize beyond a narrow undergraduate sample.
Procedure
Each participant answered questions relating to two separate fictional scenarios (a
helping and a punishment scenario) adapted from O'Gorman et al. (2005) (for a full
description, see Appendix). The scenarios were presented in randomized order. Briefly, in
the helping scenario, participants were asked to imagine that, together with nine others
Who punishes?
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(1). 2013. -190-
(either cousins or strangers), they had pooled their money to invest in the stock market, but
the investment only broke even and one member had anticipated a profit to pay for
emergency medical bills. This unfortunate person was either moving to another town or
living in the same town, depending on the condition. This scenario therefore shared the
punishment scenario's 2 (Relatedness) x 2 (Probability of future interaction) factorial
design, with four dependent variables: sympathy for the person, desire to help the person,
level of anger towards other group members that were unwilling to help the person (each
on a 1 to 9 scale), and the maximum amount the participant would be willing to give to
help the person.
The punishment scenario also involved the participant pooling investment funds
with nine other people (cousins or strangers), but in this scenario one participant had
cheated by contributing considerably less than the agreed-upon amount. While everyone
had contributed £1000, the transgressor had contributed only £200, and, since the profits
had been split equally, the transgressor ended up receiving £2160 more than he deserved.
The transgressor was either moving to another town, or living in the same town, depending
on the condition. This again yielded a 2 x 2 factorial design with four conditions in total.
The dependent variables were responses to four items. Two of them recorded participants'
anger towards, and desire to punish, the transgressor (on a nine point scale). There were
also two items that asked participants to indicate the amount of money they thought the
transgressor should pay and the amount they would personally be willing to spend in order
to punish him/her.
Participants also provided their age and sex, and completed a brief measure of the
Big Five personality factors, the Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI), which includes two
items per factor and is thus quick to administer (which suited the setting of this study) but
nonetheless correlates well with both the longer Big-Five Inventory and the NEO
Personality Inventory (Gosling, Rentflow, and Swann, 2003). In our data, internal
consistency between items was as follows: extraversion (Cronbach's  = .67),
agreeableness ( = .11), conscientiousness ( = .37), neuroticism (emotional stability in
Gosling et al.;  = .45), openness ( = .26).
In analysis of the data, we again followed the approach of O'Gorman et al. (2005),
using factorial ANOVA with relatedness and probability of future interaction as between-
subject factors. We included participants' scores on the personality dimensions as
covariates. Although the dependent variables were not always normally distributed,
ANOVA is robust to this violation (Field, 2005). Data were analyzed in SPSS, version 18.
Where appropriate, we include estimates of effect size, usually Cohen's d, for which d of
.20, .50 and .80 are indicative of a small, medium and large effect, respectively (Cohen,
1992).
Results
Validity checking
We first carried out a validity check of our scenario-setting, by analyzing the data as
a simple replication of O'Gorman et al.'s study, without accounting for personality traits.
Analysis of the helping scenario revealed a number of significant effects (in all cases, the
Who punishes?
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(1). 2013. -191-
overall ANOVA models were significant at  = .05). There were main effects of
relatedness (see Figure 1a) with regard to sympathy for the person [F(1,192) = 5.36, p =
.022, d = .33], desire to help [F(1,190) = 12.77, p < .001, d = .52] and amount of money
participants would be willing to give [F(1,174) = 14.39, p < .001, d = .57], but not for anger
at non-helpers [F(1,185) = 3.21, p = .08, d = .26]. There were also main effects of
participant sex (see Figure 1b), with women expressing greater sympathy for the person
[F(1,192) = 9.97, p = .002, d = .45] and desire to help [F(1,190) = 11.37, p = .001, d = .49],
but there was no effect of sex on anger at non-helpers [F(1,185) = .52, p = .47, d = .11] or
on the amount participants would be willing to give [F(1,174) = 2.10, p = .15, d = .22].
Contrary to O'Gorman et al. (2003), there was no main effect of probability of future
interactions on helping, but there were several significant interaction effects with
participant sex: analysis showed that while men's responses were relatively insensitive to
the likelihood of future interaction, women tended to express more sympathy when future
interactions were likely [F(1,192) = 3.48, p = .064, d = .27], were more willing to help
[F(1,190) = 4.14, p = .043, d = .29], were more angry at non-helpers [F(1,185) = 6.65, p =
.011, d = .38] and were willing to give more money to the unfortunate group member
[F(1,174) = 4.02, p = .046, d = .31].
In contrast, in the punishment scenario, there were no significant main effects of
relatedness, future interaction or sex across any of the four dependent variables, nor any
significant interaction effects. The only factor that approached significance was a main
effect of sex [F(1,192) = 3.41, p = .066, d = .26], but only in participants' desire to punish
the cheater (M ± SE; males: 5.4 ± 2.5, females: 4.7 ± 2.6). We further investigated the
amount that participants would be willing to pay to punish because this variable was highly
skewed, with 60% of participants indicating they would pay nothing at all. On this basis,
we further tested this variable using binary logistic regression, comparing those who would
pay nothing and those who were willing to pay something. This analysis revealed a main
sex effect (Wald's 2 = 5.48, df = 1, p = .019) with men being more willing to pay to punish
than women, and an interaction between sex and likelihood of future interaction
(Wald's 2 = 3.99, df = 1, p = .046), such that women were especially reticent to pay when
meeting again was more likely.
Effect of personality
To investigate the contributions of personality traits on responses to the scenarios,
we re-ran the analyses as before, including participant sex, relatedness and likelihood of
future interaction as factors, now also including as covariates the participants' scores on the
Big Five personality dimensions.

Note: In a), individuals are more sympathetic and willing to help cousins

sympathetic and willing to help than female participants (shaded bars).
*p < .1, ** p <.05, ***p < .01
In the helping scenario, the only dependent variable that was significantly predicted
from any of the Big Five dimensions was sympathy for the unfortunate person. High scores
on Agreeableness predicted increased sympathy towards the unfortunate group member (
= .31 ± .16, p = .047), with no other significant effects of personality dimension.
In the punishment scenario, in contrast, analyses revealed several significant
relationships between participants' responses and scores on personality dimensions (see
Table 1). In particular, participants who scored lower on the Agreeableness dimension
expressed more anger towards (p = .008) and greater desire to punish (p < .0001) the
Who punishes?

transgressor, and thought the transgressor should pay more in reparation (p = .037). In
addition, participants who scored higher on Conscientiousness expressed greater anger
towards the transgressor (p = .033) and those scoring lower on Extraversion expressed
greater desire to punish (p = .016). Finally, as before, we further tested effects of
personality traits on those who were willing to pay at least something to punish the
transgressor (a binarized version of the final dependent variable), using logistic regression.
In this analysis, lower scores on the Agreeableness dimension also predicted willingness to
pay to punish the transgressor (p = .045).

Discussion
Our results are broadly consistent with those of O'Gorman et al. (2005), who also
found that participants were sensitive to context cues in the helping scenario but that these
variables did not tend to predict behavior in the punishment scenario. Like O'Gorman et
al., we found that relatedness cues predicted willingness to help, but not to punish. Effects
of participant sex in our study were also in the same direction as those in O'Gorman et al.'s
study: they found a near-significant tendency for women to express more sympathy for the
group member in the helping scenario (this was significant in our study, as was desire to
help), but in neither study did participant sex have effects on anger towards the transgressor
or contributions to help. In the punishment scenario, O'Gorman et al. found that men
expressed greater desire than women to punish the transgressor, while we found a near-
Who punishes?
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(1). 2013. -194-
significant difference in the same direction. In neither study were there significant sex
differences in levels of anger, the amount that participants thought the transgressor should
pay, nor in the amount they were willing to pay to punish (except where we binarized the
data, which O'Gorman et al. did not do). As with O'Gorman et al., then, where sex
differences did exist, men appeared more likely to engage in punishment than women. This
could be because men tend to (and presumably did, in our evolutionary past) engage with
larger groups on average than women, (e.g., Baumeister 2010), where the need for social
enforcement of cooperation are greater.
The main difference between our results and those of O'Gorman et al. was that we
did not find a main effect of probability of future interaction in the helping scenario,
although we did find significant interactions with sex, such that this effect was more
important in women than men. We do not know the reason for this difference, but it could
be due to the combination of stronger effects in women and O'Gorman et al. having a
higher proportion of women in their sample than we did. However, with this exception, our
results replicated the main findings of the earlier study and confirm the validity of the
scenario-setting in our study, thus enabling us to proceed to examine effects of personality
traits.
As predicted, we found that engagement in punishment was correlated with
personality, in particular with individuals' score on the Agreeableness dimension.
Participants who scored low on Agreeableness expressed greater anger towards, and desire
to punish, the transgressor. They also felt the transgressor should pay more in reparation,
and they expressed greater willingness to pay at least something to punish the transgressor.
Higher scores on Conscientiousness also predicted anger towards the transgressor, although
it did not correlate with other measures. Furthermore, individuals scoring low on
Extraversion also indicated a higher desire to punish the transgressor. Conscientiousness
and Extraversion predicted single aspects of behavior only (respectively, anger towards and
desire to punish the transgressor) and not measures of actual reparation or monetary will to
punish. O'Gorman et al. also reported that while most of their participants expressed high
levels of anger and willingness to punish a transgressor, only some were willing to actually
engage in altruistic punishment. Thus, the effects of Conscientiousness and Extraversion
extend to emotional reaction towards, but not action against, the transgressor, in contrast to
individuals scoring low on Agreeableness.
The finding that people scoring lower on Agreeableness express greater anger
towards defectors in a collaborative enterprise, and are more willing to punish them, is in
line with their description as relatively suspicious, irritable and vengeful (e.g., McCraw and
John, 1992; Costa and McCrae, 1992). Similarly, the finding that more conscientious
people expressed greater anger towards defectors is not difficult to interpret. Goldberg
(1993) describes them, among other things, as orderly, organized, systematic, punctual,
economical and thrifty. Apart from the ethical dimension of the matter, defection by
another group member would represent a considerable upset and disturbance to the
conscientious person's organization and planning. We also found a negative relationship
between extraversion and desire to punish. Introverts have been conceptualized, among
other things, as timid and unassertive (Goldberg, 1992), traits that are difficult to reconcile
with the results of this study, but a possible explanation might be found in their lower
Who punishes?
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(1). 2013. -195-
reliance on social interactions, and consequently increased tolerance of dissatisfaction or
even hostility on the part of others. Introverts might therefore be more willing to assume
the social costs of retaliation (Janssen and Bushman, 2008). This line of reasoning suggests
that the costs of punishment are considerable, and can potentially disrupt extraverts' fabric
of social relations.
It was perhaps surprising that individual variation in desire to punish, and anger at
transgressors in the collaborative venture, were not predicted by participants' scores on the
Neuroticism dimension. Individuals who score highly on this dimension tend to experience
emotions such as anger more readily, and anger has been implicated in the tendency to
engage in costly punishment (Seip, van Dijk, and Rotteveel, 2009), as well as competitive
attack responses in a wartime prisoner's dilemma game (Kassinove, Roth, Owens, and
Fuller, 2002). In one of Seip, van Dijk, and Rotteveel's (2009) studies, more punishment
was elicited in participants who had been primed with feelings of anger (by recalling and
describing an autobiographical episode involving anger) compared to a control group. It
thus appears likely that the emotion of anger is important in driving punishment behavior,
and in our study, level of anger at the transgressor was highly correlated with desire to
punish (r = .545, p < .001). However, while anger as an emotion is not restricted to
individuals scoring highly on neuroticism, one would expect such people to display higher
than average levels of anger. Thus, the lack of relationship between punishment and
Neuroticism indicates that the links between personality traits and punishment behavior
extend beyond proneness to anger.
Before we leave this discussion, however, one should note that the tool we used to
assess personality dimensions might in fact underestimate the effects under investigation.
Due to time constraints on our participants (members of the public passing through a
science museum), we employed a ten-item personality (TIPI) questionnaire, assessing
individual scores on each of the five personality dimensions on the basis of responses to
only two items. Although scores on the TIPI correlate well with scores generated by more
detailed instruments (Gosling et al. 2003), its internal consistency is lower than typically
found in such instruments (in both our sample and that originally reported by Gosling et
al.). Thus, although the fact that we found significant relationships between personality and
punishment variables when using this tool implies a robust effect, future studies should
consider use of a more detailed personality questionnaire.
A potential criticism of our study is that it relies on responses to hypothetical
scenarios and involves no actual monetary (or other) cost to participants. In light of the
findings we describe here, it would certainly be interesting to examine whether and how the
links between personality and punishment hold in an experimental setting. However, as
O'Gorman et al. (2005) discussed at some length, the scenarios presented in their study and
also used here were designed to resemble real-world interactions, produced comparable
results to experiments on altruistic punishment, and strongly engaged the participants. Like
them, we found marked variation between participants in levels of anger, desire to punish
and willingness to punish at their own expense. Even though they were fictional scenarios
and did not involve actual cost to participants, a very high proportion (60%) indicated they
would not pay anything to punish, indicating they were treating the scenario seriously and
behaving as one would expect in the real world. Furthermore, the overall pattern of our

results map very closely onto O'Gorman et al.'s, indicating reliability of the scenarios, and
both sets of results produce results that are directly predicted by evolutionary principles
such as kin selection and game theory. For these reasons, we concur with O'Gorman et al.
that the effects elicited by these scenarios are unlikely to be an artefact of the procedure; on
the contrary, we believe it is more likely than not that they reflect how people will respond
to actual social injustices encountered in the real world.
Although here we have concentrated solely on psychological traits, studies have also
begun to address the possible utility of biological markers in predicting punishing behavior.
It has been found, for example, that men with higher levels of testosterone are more likely
to punish selfish offers in the ultimatum game (Burnham, 2007). Along with such
measures, our results suggest that personality may play a critical role in determining
individual variation in willingness to engage in punishment. This provides at least a partial
explanation for apparently irrational behavior in experimental games: because personality
types are relatively stable, patterns of behavior associated with certain personality
dimensions could render individuals susceptible to engaging in enigmatic costly
punishment, even in one-shot interactions.

Appendix
Scenarios presented to participants
Two scenarios were presented to each participant in randomised order. Sections in italics
and [square brackets] denote alternative parts of the scenario presented to different
participants, altered to manipulate genetic relatedness and probability of future interaction.
The titles to the two scenarios (helping scenario and punishment scenario), presented here
for the reader's benefit, were not included in the presented scenario.
A. Helping scenario.
Suppose that you and your nine cousins [nine strangers] in your town decide to pool your
money to invest in the stock market. Pooling the money allows the group to qualify for
lower transaction costs than if each person invests separately. Each person aggress to
contribute £1000 to the pool and to equally share the profits or losses. The stocks only
break even after only one year. One investing member had anticipated a profit to pay for
emergency medical bills.
All of you live in the same town and this person is likely to [This person is moving to
another town and is unlikely to] associate with you and your cousins [or your friends] in the
future. How much are you willing to contribute towards helping?
1) How sorry would you feel towards this person? Please answer on a scale from 1 (not at
all sorry) to 9 (extremely sorry).
2) How much would you like to help this person? Please answer on a scale from 1 (no
interest in helping) to 9 (extremely interested in helping).
3) What is the most you would be willing to give to help this person?
4) Some of the other group members want to help the person, but others seem unwilling to
help if it costs them anything. How angry would you feel towards those who do not want to
help? Please answer on a scale from 1 (not at all angry) to 9 (extremely angry).
B. Punishment scenario.
Suppose that you and your nine cousins [nine strangers] in your town decide to pool your
money to invest in the stock market. Pooling the money allows the group to qualify for
lower transaction costs than if each person invests separately. Each person agrees to
contribute £1000 to the pool and to equally share the profits or losses. The stocks do very
well and triple in value after only one year. Just before you meet to divide the profits, you
discover that the person who volunteered to keep the books only invested £200, changing
the records so that others would not notice. You do some calculations and determine the
following facts:
Who punishes?

1. The total amount invested was £9,200 which tripled in value to £27,600.
2. This was divided equally among all 10 friends to yield £2,760 for each person.
3. The person who contributed £200 should have received only £600 and therefore received
£2160 more than deserved.
4. Everyone else should have received £3000, or £240 more than they actually got.
All of you live in the same town and this person is likely to [The person is moving to
another town and is unlikely to] associate with you or the other members of the club [and
your cousins] in the future. How are you going to act?
1) How angry would you feel toward this person? Please answer on a scale from 1 (not at
all angry) to 9 (extremely angry).
2) How much would you like to punish this person? Please answer on a scale from 1 (no
interest in punishing to 9 (extremely interested in punishing).
3) Although punishment can take many forms, if you think of it as an amount in pounds,
how much do you think this person should pay for what he did?
4) Punishing this person can take many forms, but if you think of it as an amount in
pounds, what is the most you would be willing to pay to punish this person?
