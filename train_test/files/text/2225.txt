The goal of this study is twofold: (i) to develop an explanatory model to examine the relationship between school environ-
ment/climate and peer victimization and (ii) to determine whether previous models of preventive strategies in a single school
or district could be expanded to the nationally representative sample of adolescents across multiple schools. The analyses in the
current study are based on data from the Health Behavior in School-Aged Children (HBSC) 2005-2006 US study, and the sample
consists of 7,001 students from 195 different schools. The findings reveal that students attending schools in which bullying prevention
programs are implemented are more likely to have experienced peer victimization, compared to those attending schools without
bullying prevention. Study limitations and implications for future research are discussed.
1. Introduction
Although many studies suggest that there is a decline in
various types of peer victimization among school children [1,
2], bullying remains a serious problem in schools today [3­5].
Approximately 1.5 million school-aged adolescents (i.e., ages
12 to 18) report that they have been victimized by violence
while at school [6]. Furthermore, 75 percent of public school
principals in the United States indicate that their schools
reported one or more violent incidents to the police, and 25
percent of public schools reported school bullying on a daily
or weekly basis [6].
A growing body of research has supported the premise
that experiencing school violence has devastating effects on
youth [7­13]. For example, victims have experienced a signif-
icantly increased risk of internalizing and somatic symptoms,
such as anxiety, depression, confusion, lowered self-esteem,
and suicidal ideation [7, 10, 11]. Further, they are more likely to
perceive a lack of support from peers and parents and tend to
be isolated from social interaction with others [10]. In light of
this reality, a variety of bullying prevention and intervention
programs have been implemented and examined for their
effectiveness [14­16]. Although these studies have examined
varying levels of strategies, targets, and participants, the
majority of them have demonstrated that comprehensive
and whole-school efforts yield promising results for reducing
bullying within school grounds.
The conditions of school environment, prevention/inter-
vention programs, and situational factors complement or
interact with individual-level characteristics to influence
peer victimization [17, 18]. Despite a range of ecological
and contextual factors that are accountable for bullying
involvement among adolescents (e.g., individual empathy,
peer influence, family environment, teacher support), it still
remains important to understand victim characteristics that
are predictive of peer victimization. Previous studies of
peer victimization, mostly based on a single dimension (i.e.,
individual-level or school-level predictor), have been limited
in assessing the impact of bullying prevention because they
ignore possible contributions of other ecological contexts
in the surrounding environment. Relative to our concern
about peer victimization and the need for promoting a safe
school environment, only a small number of studies have
examined the different ecological contexts of victimization
(e.g., individual, peer, family, school) simultaneously. Thus,
2 Journal of Criminology
the main purpose of the current study is to examine the
impact of multiple levels of ecological influence on peer
victimization. Few researchers have examined individual-
and school-level predictors' influence on different forms of
peer victimization. To date, the current study examines
whether these predictors (i.e., demographic characteristics,
parental or peer support, school climate, and implementation
of prevention programs) show a significant effect on multiple
forms of peer victimization (i.e., physical, emotional, or both
physical and emotional).
2. Prior Research on Peer Victimization
2.1. School Bullying and Peer Victimization. Bullying can be
difficult to conceptualize given the multifaceted nature of the
violence involved. There is no simple explanation for which
factors contribute to bullying [12, 19]. A number of studies
have relied on Olweus' (1993) [11] conceptual definition,
in which bullying occurs whenever a student "is exposed
repeatedly, over time, to negative actions on the part of one
or more other students" [11, page 9]. Using this definition,
bullying may be further characterized as the presence of
(i) a power imbalance; (ii) intense intimidation; and (iii) a
harmful effect on the victim [11, 19]. Thus, school bullying
may be defined as physical and/or emotional harm inflicted
by other students within the geographical boundaries of a
school ground [11]. The forms of school bullying range from
teasing, taunting, or calling names to hitting, kicking, or
taking/destroying others' belongings [11]. Studies of school
bullying suggest that a significant number of students have
been victims of school bullying [11, 20­22]. Approximately 8
percent to 41 percent of students reported being teased in a
mean way or being hit, kicked, and/or pushed.
Bullying has detrimental effects on victims' well-being.
First, the association between school bullying and victims'
physical/psychological well-being and academic maladjust-
ment is well documented [23­29]. For example, victims
of school bullying are more likely to suffer psychological
maladjustment, including sadness, depression, loneliness,
and low self-esteem [23, 24, 26, 29]. In addition, a significant
association is found between peer victimization and extreme
emotional responses such as suicidal ideation and suicide
attempts [25, 29]. Lastly, victimization can lead to interper-
sonal and academic difficulties at school. Bullied victims
are more likely to experience relational problems with their
peers, to be rejected by their peers, to feel aversion toward
school, and to receive lower academic grades [23, 27].
2.2. Individual-Level Risk and Protective Factors. Among a
number of risk and protective factors, a myriad of studies
found that individual-level characteristics (i.e., age and race)
are important sources of influence associated with peer vic-
timization [24, 30­35]. With respect to race, minority youth
are more frequently victimized by peers at school than are
members of dominant racial groups [24, 32]. Research also
supports the notion that risk of peer victimization decreases
with age [30, 32, 35]. Specifically, high-school students
are less vulnerable to bullying victimization compared to
elementary- and middle-school students. Further, the study
by Graham et al. (2003) [24] examined the effect of gender
and found that girls are more likely than boys to be bullied
at school and to identify themselves as victims. However,
types of victimization differ between boys and girls. While
boys are more susceptible to physical victimization, girls are
more susceptible to emotional or verbal victimization (e.g.,
rumor-spreading or gossiping) [36]. Finally, considerable
research suggests that family and peer group contexts can
be risk or protective factors in bullying victimization; both
family and peer group contexts are significantly associated
with students' experience of peer victimization [26, 37]. For
example, students who are strongly rejected by their peers
are seen as easy targets of school bullying [37]. The results
from several prior studies also indicate that students who lack
parental supervision and support tend to be more victimized
than those who do not [26].
2.3. School-Level Risk and Protective Factors. In addition to
individual-level characteristics, there is a growing body of
literature suggesting that school-level characteristics (i.e.,
school security, school climate, and preventive educa-
tion/intervention) are influential in predicting the likelihood
of peer victimization [17, 18, 38]. Assuming that school-
related victimization is similar to other types of criminal
victimization, the predictors of criminal victimization would
be associated with, or explanative of, school-related victim-
ization. Miethe and Meier (1994) [39] stressed that security
and physical guardianship (i.e., locks, gates, alarm systems,
and adult presence) have significant effects on victimization.
Although the conclusions of studies on school-level security
and its impact on the extent of school bullying victimization
have been mixed [40], a significant relationship has been
found between school security and physical guardianship and
bullying victimization at school [17, 18, 41]. These studies
found that students are less likely to be bullied when schools
increase staff supervision, metal detectors, security cameras,
locked entrances, visitor sign-in, visible student badges,
and routine/random locker checks. Furthermore, students
attending schools whose teachers are aware of school policies
on bullying victimization and whose school professionals
handle victimization problems adequately tend to be victim-
ized less frequently [18].
2.4. Effects of Preventive Strategies on Peer Victimization.
These findings clearly show that school violence and peer
victimization require changes in school culture and climate
in order to improve the safety of adolescents at school.
Accordingly, many scholars and policy makers are paying
increased attention to various preventive strategies that have
been employed by schools [42]. Do these prevention strate-
gies reduce the probability of school violence and peer victim-
ization? Since prevention strategies (i.e., reactive/proactive
responses, comprehensive approaches, and curriculum inter-
ventions) and their study designs show varying degrees
of effectiveness [43], a number of empirical studies have
reported mixed findings on strategies for reducing school
violence and peer victimization [11, 19, 44]. One of the most
widely used preventive strategies involves the implementa-
tion of new curricula and whole-school multidisciplinary
Journal of Criminology 3
interventions that aim to increase awareness of school vio-
lence, social cognitive skills, conflict resolution, and policy
development [44]. For instance, Teglasi and Rothman (2001)
[45] reported on a study examining the impact of 15 weeks
of training and preventive education by using a quasiexperi-
mental design. The authors found that participants of a new
curriculum for social problem-solving skills were less likely
to engage in aggressive behaviors. However, other researchers
found that there was no statistically significant difference
between an intervention curriculum group and a control
group in decreasing bullying and victimization [46, 47].
Aside from a new curriculum, the main goal of whole-
school multidisciplinary interventions program (i.e., the
Olweus Bullying Prevention Program) is to generate an effec-
tive, comprehensive response to and consequences for school
violence [44]. Olweus (1993) [11] found that a comprehensive
approach is effective in decreasing bullying victimization
and antisocial behavior through improving school climate.
As part of a broader outcome evaluation of the compre-
hensive approach, researchers reported supportive outcomes
including decreased discipline referrals and suspension rates
[48, 49]. In sum, these prior studies have been evaluating
the effectiveness of interventions into bullying and victim-
ization by using experimental or quasiexperimental designs.
Although these studies used different designs, samples, and
statistical techniques, they have been generally supportive of
the idea that whole-school interventions or a comprehensive
approach is more effective than curriculum-based interven-
tions based on classroom modules.
Despite reviews of the comprehensive prevention appr-
oach that reported on the effectiveness of programs in
addressing school bullying, only a small number of studies
found that school bullying prevention programs have no
effect or little effect on reducing school violence [50, 51].
Based on meta-analysis, Ferguson and colleagues (2007)
[50] reported that school antibullying programs show little
discernible effect on violence and victimization of children in
school settings. Payne and colleagues (2003) [51] conducted
a study of the effects of communal school organizations (i.e.,
supportive and collaborative relations among administrators,
teachers, and students) on school victimization. Of the 254
public secondary schools studied, they found that communal
school organizations had no significant effect on reducing
student victimization.
As programs designed to support vulnerable adolescents
have significantly increased [52], a number of school pro-
grams have been developed to address safe environments
and students' well-being. Safe Passage program is a model
for reducing school problems by bringing together school
staff members, parents, the local health department, the
local social service agency, local youth organizations, and
students [53]. Recently, by identifying best practices, Oak-
land, California, provided services targeted to vulnerable
adolescents, including a violence-prevention curriculum,
case management, mental health services, and after-school
programs [54]. Results from studies on this comprehensive
approach suggest that Safe Passage programs can be effective
in delivering justice while increasing school safety compared
to other school-based intervention programs. Specifically,
violence-related suspension and overall suspension have been
substantially decreased [54]. Although many of our public
schools already implemented Safe Passage programs [53],
only a small number of studies have evaluated its success.
3. Research Questions and Hypotheses
Despite the previous findings, few studies have tested the
efficacy of intervention strategies on peer victimization. Fur-
thermore, no study has examined the roles that intervention
strategies and school climate play on different types of
bullying victimization, particularly for distinct physical and
emotional types of victimization. The current study seeks to
address several issues that remain unresolved. First, this study
focuses on developing an explanatory model to understand
the relationship between school environment/climate and
peer victimization. Second, it is evident from the literature
review that research on prevention strategies of bullying
is not rigorous enough. Existing research has tested the
effectiveness of preventive strategies based on students in
a single school site or district. Thus, little is known about
whether these models could be expanded to a nationally
representative sample of adolescents across multiple schools.
Consequently, the current study suggests several research
questions relevant to peer victimization.
(i) Did students' individual-level backgrounds (i.e., race,
sex, age, parental support, peer support, and school
pressure) affect the one's risk of vulnerability to peer
victimization?
(ii) Did being minority, being male, being younger, hav-
ing quality of parental support, having quality of peer
support, and feeling higher level of school pressure
increase the one's risk of vulnerability to peer victim-
ization?
(iii) Did students' school-level characteristics (i.e., school
security climate, implementation of safe passage
program, implementation of Gang Prevention, and
implementation of bullying prevention) affect the
one's risk of vulnerability to peer victimization?
4. Methodology
4.1. Sample and Procedure. The analyses in the current study
are based on data from the Health Behavior in School-
Aged Children (HBSC) 2005-2006 U.S. study. Sponsored by
the World Health Organization (WHO), the HBSC study
has been conducted every four years since 1985 to examine
school-based behaviors of adolescents from more than 40
different countries. Funded by the United States Department
of Health and Human Services, the HBSC study collected data
with a nationally representative sample of students in public,
Catholic, and other private schools. The HBSC survey com-
ponent asks respondents about health problems and school-
related issues (e.g., bullying) through early adolescence. In
addition, a school administrators' survey has been conducted
to obtain school-level information on violence prevention
policies and security practices. In order to obtain a nationally
representative sample, data were collected from students
4 Journal of Criminology
(from sixth to tenth grades) and school administrators in
the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Given that the
purpose of the study is to understand school climate and
violence prevention strategies related to peer victimization
at school, the analyses were restricted to students attending
schools whose administrators have completed a school-level
survey. Among the 8,030 students who completed the survey
through a multistate sampling, 2,226 students from 32 schools
were excluded due to missing information of school-level
indicators. Therefore, a total of 7,001 students from 195
different schools were eligible for the current study.
4.2. Dependent Variable. For the purpose of the present
study, prevalence of peer victimization is operationalized as
a dichotomous variable, with "0" indicating the student was
not victimized and "1" indicating the student was victim-
ized by other students on school grounds (we created the
victimization item by summing seven items (i.e., how often
got called names/teased, left out of things, hit/kicked/pushed,
others lied about me, for race/color, for religion, and made
sexual jokes to me) and dichotomizing them). A review of
prior research suggests that certain characteristics of the
victims increase the risk of different types of victimization. In
response to these differences, victimizations are grouped into
three categories: all victimization, physical victimization, and
emotional victimization (peer victimization was based on
Olweus' (1993) criteria: physical victimization and emotional
victimization. Physical victimization was measured with one
item, "I was hit, kicked, pushed, shoved around, or locked
indoors." To measure emotional victimization, the following
six items were used: "I was called mean names, was made fun
of, or teased in a hurtful way," "other students left me out of
things on purpose, excluded me from their group of friends,
or completely ignored me," "other students told lies or spread
false rumors about me and tried to make others dislike me," "I
was bullied with mean names and comments about my race or
color," "I was bullied with mean names and comments about
my religion," "other students made sexual jokes, comments,
or gestures to me." Similar to all types of victimization, we
created each type of victimization by summing items and
dichotomizing them so that each measure has a dichotomous
(yes/no) response).
4.3. Individual-Level Variables. Three demographic back-
ground variables, Race, Sex, and Age (11 to 17), are included in
the study. Race was originally incorporated as an exhaustive
list from which respondents could select all categories that
applied. Given the results, it was collapsed into a new dichoto-
mous variable with 0 indicating non-white and 1 indicating
White. Sex is also a dichotomous variable with 0 indicating
female and 1 indicating male. Additional measures of indi-
vidual characteristics were parental support, peer support, and
school pressure. the parental support construct is measured by
a combined scale of six items: parent helps me as much as I
need; lets me do things I like doing; is loving; understands
my problems; likes me to make my own decisions; and makes
me feel better when upset. Responses were coded 1 to 3:
almost never, sometimes, and almost always. Then they were
collapsed into new continuous variables with a higher score
indicating more warmth and support from parents (Alpha =
.803). Peer support is measured as follows: students in my
class enjoy being together; are kind and helpful; and accept
me as I am. Responses were coded on a five-point Likert scale
from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), then collapsed
into new continuous variables with a higher score indicating
more warmth and support from peers (Alpha = .704). School
pressure is included to assess the role of negative emotions on
peer victimization. This item has four categories from 1 (not
at all) to 4 (a lot).
4.4. School-Level Variables. Several prior studies [18, 38, 55]
suggest that school characteristics and climate have signifi-
cant effects on victimization. In response, the current study
examines two different domains of school characteristics
to reflect school climate and preventive strategies based
on a survey of administrators. Four predictors related to
peer victimization are used as measures of school-level
characteristics: security climate, safe passage program, gang
prevention program, and bullying prevention program. Six
items are used to construct the variable of security climate,
which asks questions about whether the school requires
visitor check-in; maintains a closed campus; has staff/adults
monitor the halls; conducts routine bag/locker checks; uses
metal detectors; and has uniformed police. These items are
measured by a dichotomous response, with 0: no and 1:
yes, and collapsed into a single construct. The high value
means a higher level of security climate on school grounds.
Three preventive measures, safe passage, gang prevention, and
bullying intervention, are used to reflect whether a school
has or participates in preventive programs. Each item is a
dichotomous variable, with 0: no and 1: yes.
5. Analytic Strategy
To examine the empirical relationships among the variables
described in the research question, the current study attempts
to conduct multilevel modeling linking school-level contexts.
Multilevel modeling (i.e., hierarchical linear modeling) is
a powerful method of analysis for treating students as
individual-level units and schools as school-level units [56].
This technique is appropriate for at least two reasons. First,
it addresses the design effects that are inherent in the HBSC
dataset, which utilizes a three-stage stratified design, with
census divisions and grades as strata and school districts as
primary sampling units [57]. Second, in order to address
the research questions, we need to attend to the validity
and model misfit due to hierarchically structured data. This
technique allows researchers to resolve these problems while
simultaneously investigating both within- and between-
group variances [56]. Therefore, the multilevel modeling pre-
sented the current study's focus on school-level predictors of
secure school climate and school-level prevention strategies,
as well as the individual-level predictors. The two-level model
consists of two submodels, one for each level (i.e., Level-
1, the individual-level model and Level-2, the school-level
model). While the Level-1 model represents the relationships
among the individual-level predictors, the Level-2 model
captures the influence of school-level covariates' effects.

nested within schools) and the nature of binary outcomes

logistic regressions are conducted using STATA 12.0.
6. Results
6.1. Descriptive Statistics. Table 1 illustrates the descriptive
statistics for the dependent and independent variables used
in the current study. Of 7,001 students, approximately 55 per-
cent reported experiencing some form of peer victimization
during the school year. In particular, among those bullied
students, slightly more than half (53.1%) of the students had
been emotionally bullied (i.e., being called names, victims of
rumors, or ignored), and about 14 percent of the students had
experienced physical bullying (i.e., being hit, kicked, pushed,
shoved around, or locked indoors). Table 1 also shows that the
sample population was 47 percent white and 48 percent male,
whose mean age was 14.67 (sd = 1.47), and who received
warmth and support from their parents (mean = 15.56 and
sd = 2.76) and peers (mean = 10.49 and sd = 2.55). However,
students in the current study felt significant levels of stress
regarding school work (mean = 2.56 and sd = 1.01).
School-level variables reported by a sample of 195 school
administrators are also illustrated in Table 1. Of the six
security measures listed under the security climate item,
the mean number of security measures was 4.04 (sd =
1.33). The majority of schools have around four security
measures among six possible strategies, such as visitor check-
in, a closed campus, staff/adult hall monitors, bag/locker
checks, metal detectors, and uniformed police. In terms of
preventive school programs, the majority of schools have
bullying prevention programs (65.4%). Approximately 45
percent of school administrators reported that their schools
have implemented gang prevention programs, followed by
Safe Passage programs (22.8%).
6.2. Bivariate Analysis. As a preliminary measure, bivariate
correlations among individual-level and school-level vari-
ables are computed (Table 2). As expected, the individual-
level characteristics (i.e., sex, age, parental support, and
peer support) were negatively correlated with ever being
victimized. In contrast, the level of stress about schoolwork
was positively related to the experience of peer victim-
ization. At the school level, although it was hypothesized
that these security-related predictors would be related to
victimization, there were no significant associations between
security climates, Safe Passage program, gang prevention, and
peer victimization. Unexpectedly, however, there was positive
association between bullying-prevention programs and peer
victimization.
6.3. Multilevel Models. Multilevel models are constructed
to determine whether the prevalence of peer victimization,
physical victimization, and emotional victimization varies
according to school-level predictors (the basic unconditional
model was first conducted to determine the proportion of the
variance in outcome between the schools. An analysis of the
intraclass correlations reveals that around 7 percent (ICC =
.065) of the variance in peer victimization (both physical
and emotional victimization) is accounted for by differences
in the characteristics of the schools. Although most of the
variance in student-level characteristics (around 90%) was
attributed to within-school variance, the between-school
variance was statistically significant). Table 3 presents the
results of models that include the individual-level and school-
level variables for all three types of victimization (Model 1)
and for specific types of victimization (Models 2 and 3) from
competing risks models (for interpretation, the estimated
coefficients have been transformed into odds ratios). Level-
1 of Model 1 shows the general pattern of individual-level
differences in odds ratios for victimization cases. Specifically,
male students were .67 times less likely than female students

to report victimization. In addition, older students were 15
percent less likely than younger students to be victims of
school bullying. Those with more warmth, parent support,
and peer support were less likely to be victims of school bul-
lying (OR = .933 and OR = .845, resp.). In contrast, students
with a higher level of stress about schoolwork were 1.13 times
more likely to report victimization than those with a lower
level of stress. After controlling for school-level variables,
the results of individual-level effects were consistent with
our predictions (see Model 1). As expected, the results show
that gang prevention programs had significant effects on peer
victimization. More specifically, students attending schools
where gang prevention programs are provided were less likely
to report victimization (OR = .831). For other school-
level predictors such as security climate and Safe Passage
programs, we proposed that students attending schools with
Safe Passage programs or more secure climates were less
likely to be victimized. This hypothesis was not supported.

Interestingly, bullying prevention programs were negatively
related to peer victimization. That is, students attending
schools with bullying prevention programs were more likely
to have experienced peer victimization (OR = 1.236).
Model 2 in Table 3 shows the effects of individual-
level predictors on physical victimization. Similar to Model
1 (all types of victimization), the effects of age, parental
support, and peer support were also significant and in
the predicted directions, indicating decreased risk of being
physically victimized. The effect of the level of stress due to
schoolwork was not significant in Model 2. However, being
male was a significant predictor of physical victimization
with a different direction compared to Model 1. That is, male
students were 2.17 times more likely than female students
to become victims of physical bullying. With the addition
of school-level variables into the model, individual-level
predictors were consistent with the individual-level model
in Model 2. Notably, it was not expected that providing
bullying prevention programs would be found as a significant
predictor of physical victimization (OR = 1.290).
Model 3 presents results from a multilevel logistic regres-
sion for emotional victimization. In the Level-1 model with
individual-level predictors, a number of predictors were
significantly related to emotional victimization. Emotional
victimization was negatively associated with being male,
being older, and having more warmth, parental support, and
peer support. With the addition of the school-level variables
into the Level-2 model (see Level-2 model in Model 3),
security climate and Safe Passage programs at the school level
were not found to be significantly associated with emotional
victimization. Contrary to our hypotheses, students attend-
ing schools with bullying prevention programs were more
likely to have experienced peer victimization (OR = 1.240).
7. Conclusion and Discussion
The current study investigated individual- and school-level
differences in bullying victimization among peers in school.
With respect to individual-level factors, both age and gender
were important predictors of different types of peer victim-
ization. Age had a positive effect on all three types of peer
victimization. This is consistent with the literature that peer
victimization appears to decrease with age; older students
were less likely to be victims of bullying than younger
students [30, 35]. Gender also had an effect on all three types
of peer victimization. Boys were more likely than girls to be
victims of physical bullying, but girls were more likely to be
victims of emotional bullying. These findings are consistent
with prior studies' conclusions that the type of victimization
varies according to gender [24, 36].
However, inconsistent with prior findings, race did not
have an impact on peer victimization. The current study
found no statistically significant difference across race. This is
contrary to our prediction that minority adolescents are more
likely to experience higher rates of bullying victimization,
compared to Caucasian adolescents [31]. Given that more
than half of the sample was in the non-white category, victim-
ization directed toward minority students may not be appar-
ent. Although existing bullying prevention programs address
the factors that may increase the risk of bullying across race,
they often do not take into account sociorelational contexts
as important sources of adolescents' learning process that
influence bullying behaviors. Spriggs et al. (2007) [33] argued
that the effects of family, peer, and school relationships on
bullying involvement differ according to race. Being able to
recognize and address these differences across racial groups
will help to develop a better understanding of the dynamics
of bullying victimization and to produce effective bullying
prevention and intervention tailored to the populations being
served.
Both parental and peer support represent significant
predictors of peer victimization. The finding that parental
support was predictive of both types of peer victimization
suggests that parent-child interaction has a considerable
effect on the likelihood of peer victimization. While parental
support may play a protective role against peer victimization,
lack of involvement and support from parents is likely to
increase the risk of bullying victimization [26]. Peer support
also was predictive of peer victimization, both physical and
emotional. Negative peer relationships and lack of peer
support may pose as risk factors conducive to bullying in
schools [33, 37]. On the other hand, having peer support
reduces the likelihood of peer victimization [58]. Finally,
school pressure had an effect on emotional victimization.
Those facing a high level of school pressure are more likely to
experience negative emotions and to be involved in bullying,
as an aggressor and a victim, compared to those with a low
level of school pressure [59].
Our prediction that students in schools with more secu-
rity measures would be less likely to be victimized was not
supported by the study findings. It must be noted that the
security measure item contains elements that focus mainly
on security on school grounds and the physical safety of stu-
dents. In order to improve school safety, schools have imple-
mented security measures such as video cameras, bag/locker
searches, metal detectors, and other surveillance programs
[42, 60]. Studies have found that peer bullying victimization
is less likely to occur if schools increase the level of security
and safety for students through adult monitoring [41, 61].
For instance, uniformed officers can be useful for deterring
bullying behaviors, but the utility of the other components
of security climate (e.g., visitor check-in, a closed campus) in
preventing bullying is not well documented. Further, security
measures are just one element of the school climate. Other
elements, such as teachers' awareness of antibullying policies
and strategies, can intervene to reduce peer victimization.
Schools in which teachers are aware of school policies
on bullying victimization tend to have fewer incidents of
bullying victimization [18]. Peer and teacher relations as
well as the degree of aggressiveness in a school climate are
also associated with bullying offending and victimization
[41]. By improving several aspects of the school climate, a
comprehensive approach can be effective in reducing bullying
victimization and antisocial behavior [11].
For the school-level predictors, gang and bullying preven-
tion programs were found to be significant predictors of peer
victimization. However, gang prevention had only a partial
effect. Although gang prevention had an impact on emotional
8 Journal of Criminology
victimization, it did not indicate any effect on physical victim-
ization. One possible explanation is that strategies for school-
based gang prevention (e.g., zero tolerance policies) may have
proven to be ineffective in reducing physical victimization.
Furthermore, whether or not school personnel are committed
to implementing the program can be another important facet
to consider. For example, the attitude of supervising teachers
and staff members in supporting the prevention curriculum
and communicating with the students can affect the overall
effectiveness of these prevention programs [62, 63]. Teacher
monitoring is considered to be an important protective
factor against peer victimization because the likelihood of
students reporting bullying incidents depends on teachers
responsiveness [64].
Surprisingly, bullying prevention had a negative effect
on peer victimization. Contrary to our hypothesis, students
attending schools with bullying prevention programs were
more likely to have experienced peer victimization, compared
to those attending schools without bullying prevention pro-
grams. It is possible that bullies have learned a variety of
antibullying techniques but chose not to practice what they
have learned from the program. Sometimes, bullies maintain
their dominant social status among peers in school. As a
result, the preventive strategies may become ineffective.
The other preventive measure, the Safe Passage program,
had no effect on the likelihood of peer victimization. As a
program designed to support at-risk adolescents, the pro-
gram's goal is to create a safe school environment by reducing
various school problems [52]. However, we did not find any
significant impact on peer victimization. Without knowing
specific details of the program, it is difficult to assess the
effectiveness of the Safe Passage program.
Although prior research suggests that school-level char-
acteristics (such as school security or a preventive cur-
riculum) may be influential in predicting the likelihood of
peer victimization [17, 18, 38], it should be noted that the
effectiveness of bullying prevention has yet to be proven. A
meta-analysis indicates that bullying prevention programs
specifically targeting at-risk youth were slightly effective in
reducing bullying or violent behaviors on campus, but gener-
ally had a minimal effect on bullying and victimization [50].
Future direction needs to focus not merely on implemen-
tation of bullying prevention but rather on its effectiveness.
Using a comprehensive approach (both an individual-level
and a school-level approach), prevention efforts must move
beyond individual risk factors and focus on systemic change
within the schools. Furthermore, given that bullying is a
relationship problem, researchers need to better identify
the bully-victim dynamics in order to develop prevention
strategies accordingly.
8. Limitations and Future
Directions for Research
The current study used multilevel modeling to address the
need to simultaneously examine the effect of individual-
and school-level variables on peer victimization. This type
of modeling allows one to determine the amount of vari-
ance in the dependent variable that is explained by the
individual-level factors (e.g., age, parental support) as well
as school-level factors (e.g., security climate, preventive
measure).
A number of limitations in the current study must be
addressed in future research. First, the cross-sectional nature
of the study limits one from making a causal inference
about the relationship between individual- and school-level
factors and likelihood of peer victimization. Future studies
need to utilize a longitudinal design in investigating the
temporal ordering between the preventive measures and peer
victimization in schools. Second, no specific information
concerning the prevention measures, specifically bullying
prevention and gang prevention programs, is provided. The
HBSC data contain limited information about these bullying
prevention programs. Future research needs to examine the
specific components of the prevention programs. Because the
preventive measures in the current study were dichotomous,
it is limited in understanding the impact of preventive
strategies on peer victimization. Lastly, while school bullying
among adolescents can be categorized into different types
(e.g., physical, verbal, relational, cyber) [65], the current study
is limited to physical and emotional victimization. As a result,
we are not able to examine the distinct nature of the different
forms of bullying and their relations with other factors.
