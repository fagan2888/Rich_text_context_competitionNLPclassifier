Abstract
Objectives: This study aimed to predict patients who have caesarean operations under regional
anaesthesia and are at risk for intraoperative nausea and vomiting (IONV), for ultimately prompting
anaesthetists and surgeons to take preventive measures.
Methods: This was a retrospective study on 209 patients who had caesarean section under spinal-
epidural combined regional anaesthesia. The relevant medical history, such as severe nausea and
vomiting in the first trimester, smoking, a history of motion sickness, and premenstrual syndrome
(PMS), were obtained from the patients' records and interviews.
Results: Patients who had a female neonate, a history of severe nausea and vomiting in the first
trimester, and a history of PMS and motion sickness before pregnancy experienced a significantly
higher rate of IONV. Smokers were less susceptible to IONV, but this was not significant.
Conclusion: This study shows that some factors in the medical history of a patient can help
identify those who are more likely to suffer from IONV.

Introduction
As major problems of anaesthesia have been
overcome in modern medicine, research has
focussed on some other relatively minor
difficulties. Most such minor problems
remain unpredictable. Therefore, this field
of research is important because some of
these problems may progress from a state of
inconvenience to a situation of disturbing
morbidity.1,2 Nausea and vomiting in the
postoperative period of epidural anaesthesia
is a well-studied subject, but intraoperative
nausea and vomiting (IONV) has not been
well studied.3,4 Nausea and vomiting with
onset during the operation and persisting in
the postoperative period cause reduced
patient comfort, delayed discharge from
the hospital, and an increase in costs. This
problem deserves more attention when some
possible consequences, such as dehydration,
electrolyte imbalance, wound dehiscence,
venous hypertension and bleeding, rupture
of the oesophagus, airway obstruction, and
aspiration pneumonia, are taken into
account.5,6
Nausea and vomiting are not uncommon
in a wide variety of surgical operations.
However, this problem arises even more
often in caesarean operations under regional
anaesthesia.7 Increased intra-gastric pres-
sure, hypotension, stretching the periton-
eum (exteriorization of the uterus), excessive
surgical manipulation and visceral stimula-
tion, using opioids, using uterotonic agents,
and the patient's mental status play a role
and place the patient at high risk for
IONV.4,7­9 Hypotension associated with
spinal,6 epidural,10,11 and spinal-epidural
(combined) anaesthesia12 is a particularly
important contributing factor for IONV.
Some details associated with the surgical
technique, such as peritonealization, exter-
iorizing the uterus for suturing, and peri-
toneal washing, may also contribute to
IONV.8 The incidence of IONV is as high
as 80%.7 Therefore, prophylactic medica-
tion for this condition is critical.
Previous studies that have been con-
ducted on IONV have focussed on treat-
ment, rather than prevention, of this
condition. Preoperative and intraoperative
administration of midazolam and propofol,
close monitoring of hypotension, achieving
a good anaesthetic block, a gentle surgical
technique, and judicious use of uterotonic
agents appear to have beneficial effects on
IONV.6­8
This study aimed to investigate the effect
of particular anaesthetic and surgical tech-
niques and the significance of the antenatal-
medical-surgical history on occurrence of
IONV in patients who have caesarean deliv-
ery under regional anaesthesia. Our results
could prompt anaesthetists and surgeons to
take appropriate preventive measures.
Methods
The study was retrospectively conducted by
the Memorial Hospital (private hospital),
GATA Haydarpasa Training Hospital (aca-
demic military hospital), and Necip Fazil
State Hospital (training status, state hos-
pital) between March 2014 and February
2015. A total of 209 women were selected to
participate in this multicentre study. The
sample size was considered sufficient to draw
conclusions because the condition of IONV
is as common as 50­80% in caesarean
sections under epidural anaesthesia. The
study protocol was approved by the ethics
committee of GATA Haydarpasa Training
Hospital. The inclusion criteria were as
follows: regular antenatal clinic attendance
(at least one attendance in the first trimester
and observation four times weekly, or com-
plying with the attending obstetrician's
advice, more often until term); elective
caesarean section (the patient's decision
was not to have vaginal delivery); singleton
pregnancy; and cephalic presentation. The
Semiz et al. 333
exclusion criteria were as follows: any his-
tory of diabetes, hypertension, thyroid dis-
ease, obesity, gastrointestinal disease,
anaemia or any other condition requiring
long-term medication; no history of alcohol
or drug abuse; and no major complications
of pregnancy (pregnancy-induced hyperten-
sion, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes) in
the antenatal period. Only patients with the
above-mentioned details recorded in their
hospital records and who could provide
information to complete the data set when
contacted were included in the study.
Epidural anaesthesia was applied under the
following routine: 1000 ml of Isolyte-S solu-
tion was infused as a co-load through a 20
gauge peripheral intravenous catheter. An
electrocardiogram, blood pressure, heart
rate, and peripheral oxygen saturation
were continuously monitored. The patient
was placed in the seated position and 2%
lidocaine infiltration was performed at the
appropriate level. A combined spinal-epi-
dural Tuohy needle (Tuohy Portex 19 G)
was progressed to the epidural space using
the technique of loss of resistance with
normal saline. The spinal needle was further
advanced through and free flow of cerebro-
spinal fluid was observed. A combination
solution of 2 ml 0.5% bupivacaine hydro-
chloride anhydrous (Marcain Heavy) and
25 mcg fentanyl was injected. The spinal
needle was withdrawn and the catheter
remained in situ for continuous epidural
anaesthesia with 0.5% bupivacaine. The
epidural catheter was then progressed for 4
to 5 cm cranially. The needle was withdrawn
and the catheter was fixated. The level of
sensory block was tested by temperature
sensation.
A common operative technique adopted
by obstetricians was performed as follows. A
Pfannenstiel incision was performed using
scissors to open the fascial and peritoneal
layers (to minimize the peritoneal stretch
factor), and a scalpel incision was made for a
lower segment transverse (Kerr) uterotomy,
which was extended sideways by the fingers.
The foetus was delivered by directing the
occiput to the incision and moderate fundal
pressure by the assistant. The uterus was not
exteriorized during repair. If the uterus had
to be exteriorized for any reason, the patient
was excluded from the sample. The average
operating time was 30 minutes (range, 24­50
minutes) from making the incision to com-
pletion of skin closure. As soon as the
newborn was delivered, 1 ml of oxytocin
(Synpitan, 5000 mIU) was added to 500 ml
of isotonic sodium chloride (0.9% NaCl)
infusion in addition to a bolus of the same
dose. The patients were monitored to deter-
mine whether they felt nauseated during
caesarean delivery and nausea was recorded
along with vomiting episodes if encountered.
Treatment was provided as appropriate by
the anaesthetist when vomiting occurred.
Epidural anaesthesia was performed using
the same technique by the anaesthetists in
each of the three assigned hospitals with
similar times for the procedure.
Using records or interviews, severe
nausea and vomiting in the first trimester
(1st TM nausea/vomiting) was accepted as
present when the patient expressed this
complaint in the antenatal clinic in the first
trimester, as occurring every day and requir-
ing antiemetics other than herbal or dietary
measures. A distinction between emesis and
hyperemesis was not made. Smoking was
recorded as positive if the patient continued
or started smoking while pregnant. Motion
sickness was recorded as positive when the
patient described nausea and/or vomiting
during a car, boat, or air travel before
pregnancy as shown on records or inter-
views. PMS was recorded as positive using
the patients' description and answers based
on the criteria of the International Society
for Premenstrual disorders.
Statistical analysis was conducted using
PASW 18.0 for Windows. To form the
334 Journal of International Medical Research 45(1)
sample group, we chose criterion sampling
of the purposive/purposeful sampling
approach where only those patients who
conformed to some specified criteria were
included. The descriptive statistics for cat-
egorical variables are shown as counts and
percentages. Continuous variables are
shown as mean, standard deviation,
median, 25th percentile, 75th percentile,
minimum, and maximum. For continuous
variables, the Mann­Whitney U test was
used for testing differences between groups
when the assumption of normality was not
satisfied. For categorical variables, the chi-
square test was used when its conditions
were met. Otherwise, Fisher's exact test was
used. Furthermore, logistic regression was
used to determine the risk factors, where the
level of significance was p < 0.05.
Results
A total of 209 women with a mean age of
29.88 Æ 5.12 years were included in this
multicentre study. Mean body mass index
was 28.37 Æ 4.40. The number of patients
with 1st TM nausea/vomiting was 59
(28.2%), the number of smokers was 20
(9.6%), and the number of those describing
motion sickness was 47 (22.5%). The
number of patients who experienced PMS
before pregnancy was 20 (9.6%). A total of
111 of the newborns were female (53.1%)
and 98 were male (46.9%). All of the
parameters are shown in Table 1.
Of the 209 patients included in the study,
77 (36.8%) patients experienced nausea
during the caesarean operation and 19
(9.1%) suffered from vomiting. Patients
who experienced nausea intraoperatively
had a significantly higher rate of 1st TM
nausea/vomiting, motion sickness, and a
female newborn than did those who did
not experience nausea intraoperatively
(p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p ¼ 0.009, respectively)
(Table 2). Patients who had a female new-
born, 1st TM nausea/vomiting, and a
history of PMS and motion sickness before
pregnancy experienced a significantly higher
rate of IONV (p < 0.001, p ¼ 0.017,
p ¼ 0.023, p ¼ 0.004, respectively) (Table 3).
In the model that was formed by inclusion
of variables that showed significance for
nausea (age and comparison analyses,
p < 0.250), a history of 1st TM nausea/
vomiting and motion sickness, but not
PMS, were significant risk factors
(p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively) (Table 4).
In the model that was created for evaluation
of risk factors for vomiting, the parameters
that were significant by multivariate analyses
(age and comparison analyses, p < 0.250)
were 1st TM nausea/vomiting and a female
foetus (p < 0.001, p ¼ 0.045, respectively)
(Table 5).
Discussion
In this study, we primarily aimed to define
preventive measures for intraoperative
nausea and vomiting during caesarean sec-
tion under epidural anaesthesia. After main-
taining the parameters of surgical, medical,
and anaesthesiological factors within certain
standards, a female newborn, nausea and
vomiting in the first trimester, and a history
of PMS and motion sickness were risk
factors for IONV. We conclude that this
group of patients will benefit from prophy-
lactic medication.

Regional anaesthesia is a safe method for
elective and emergency caesarean sec-
tions.8,14 IONV has been reported to be as
high as 50% to 80% in caesarean sections,
while in non-obstetric operations, this rate
ranges from 7% to 42%.7,8 This condition is
affected by factors that are particular to the
patient, anaesthesia, and surgery. Prediction
of IONV is important for enabling appro-
priate and timely use of antiemetics.15,16
Apfel et al.1 described a useful risk scoring
system based on four parameters for post-
operative nausea and vomiting (PONV), but
there is no such system for IONV.
Therefore, there is no such system in
caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia.
In most studies on IONV, only the triad of
patients, surgery, and anaesthesia were kept
constant and other parameters were investi-
gated. Predictive factors concerning the
patient have been more consistently defined,
but those concerning surgery and anaesthe-
sia have been more variable and
uncontrolled.
Our study showed that nausea was more
likely to occur if the patient's history con-
sisted of 1st TM nausea/vomiting, when a
history of motion sickness before pregnancy
was present, and if the newborn was female.
This is an interesting finding because it has
not been shown in other studies. Female sex
of the newborn has been shown to be closely

associated with hyperemesis gravidarum in
previous studies.17,18 This situation might be
due to high oestrogen levels. The fact that
IONV is observed less frequently with
advanced maternal age, which is attributed
to decreased oestrogen levels, also supports
this hypothesis.1 In non-obstetric oper-
ations, women are four times more suscep-
tible to nausea and vomiting than men.1,2
This rate decreases after menopause, but still
remains higher than that in men, which
supports a significant role of sex hormones
in nausea and vomiting.19,20
Previous studies have shown that being a
non-smoker results in more susceptibility to
IONV, but this finding was not confirmed in
our study.1,2,21 The only finding in our study
that was related to this previous finding,
which suggests that liver enzymes are
induced by smoking and thus produce a
protective effect on IONV, was the higher
number of smokers in the group without
vomiting. However, this finding did not
reach significance. We also found that 1st
TM nausea/vomiting in addition to motion
sickness were also significant risk factors for
IONV. Migraines are also a contributing
factor in PONV.2,22 We found that the rate
of PMS was significantly higher in the group
affected by vomiting compared to the group
who had nausea only. While the mechanism
of PMS is not completely known, women
with PMS are considered to have increased
sensitivity to hormonal changes along with
neurotransmitter abnormalities.23
The presence of gastric distension, an
operating time exceeding 30 minutes, use of
opioids intraoperatively, nitrous oxide, and
positive pressure ventilation with a face mask
increase the likelihood of IONV.3,24 The
stimulating agents of the vomiting mechan-
ism comprise the vagal nerves, cerebral
cortex, vestibular body, and the chemorecep-
tor trigger zone. The receptors of dopamine,
serotonin, histamine, and muscarine play a
role in this process.19,25 All studies on these
aspects have been at the epidemiological level.
There is a notable lack of studies at the
genetic and molecular biology level, which
would provide more understanding on the
pathology and management of IONV.
Previous studies have suggested that to
prevent IONV during caesarean section,
blood pressure must be closely monitored,
use of opioids must be kept to a minimum,
the operative technique must be gentle with
minimum displacement of the uterus (not
exteriorising through an incision), and
uterotonics and antibiotics must be admin-
istered in dilute and slow infusions. Our
study shows that if a patient has a history of
PMS, motion sickness, or severe nausea-
vomiting in the first trimester, and the
newborn is a girl, prophylactic antiemetics
should be used. Further work on this issue is
necessary to confirm the role of the factors
that we analysed in this study in identifying
candidates who are at risk of IONV and the
effectiveness of measures in its prevention. A
scoring system could be devised in such a
study to enable clinicians to identify patients
at risk for IONV more specifically and
effectively.

Limitations of the study
In this study, we examined some potential
factors, including the medical history, medi-
cation in the operating room, and anaesthetic
and surgical techniques that may play a role
in the occurrence of IONV during caesarean
section under spinal-epidural anaesthesia.
Our study was retrospective, which should
ideally be prospective where the parameters
could be better controlled. This , alongside
the relatively modest sample size may throw
shadow on the reliability of the results.
