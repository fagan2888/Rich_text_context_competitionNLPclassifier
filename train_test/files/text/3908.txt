Introduction
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common arrhyth-
mias seen in clinical practice. AF can cause heart failure
and thromboembolism, and increase the risk of cerebral
embolism. In patients aged >75 years, AF has been identi-
fied as the one of the most dangerous features of ischemic
stroke.1 The mortality of AF patients is 1.5­1.9 times
higher than that of non-AF patients.2
Recent research has shown that the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system (RAAS) is important to the develop-
ment and perpetuation of AF. Angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) expression is important in several patho-
physiological effects of the RAAS. Li et al.3 have reported
increased ACE expression in myocardial tissue of AF
patients. ACE can stimulate the expression of angiotensin
II, which promotes cardiac fibroblast proliferation by
enhancing atrial fibrosis.4­6 The ACE gene is located on

Abstract
Aims: The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is important to the development of atrial fibrillation (AF). A lot of
research has focused on the relationship between angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion (I) /deletion (D) gene
polymorphisms and AF, with inconsistent results. A meta-analysis was carried out to find the correlation between ACE
I/D gene polymorphisms and AF.
Methods: Data were extracted from articles published before September 2013 on ACE I/D polymorphisms and AF in
Embase, PubMed, WanFangData, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure.
Results: The recessive model found that ACE I/D gene polymorphisms were related to AF (odds ratio (OR) = 1.61, 95%
confidence interval (CI) = 1.16­1.72). Subgroup analysis showed a significant association in the recessive model for Asian
(OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.19­1.80) and Caucasian (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.01­1.99) populations.
Conclusions: ACE I/D gene polymorphisms and AF are significantly related to ethnicity. Individuals with the ACE D/D
genotype appear to be at higher risk of AF.

chromosome 17q23.3, and insertion (I) /deletion (D) poly-
morphisms result in homozygous D/D and I/I and hete-
rozygous I/D genotypes.7 Higher plasma levels of ACE are
associated with the D/D genotype, lower levels with the I/I
genotype, and intermediate levels with the I/D genotype.8
In recent years, the relationship between ACE I/D gene
polymorphisms and incidence of AF has been a major
research focus, but inconsistent results have been obtained.9
A meta-analysis of 18 case-control studies published
before 2009 with 7577 patients was performed in 2011 that
showed no significant correlation between ACE I/D poly-
morphism and AF.10
Further research on the association between ACE I/D
polymorphisms and AF was conducted from 2010 to
2013.11­15 Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of all
23 studies from 1990 to 2013. We estimated the correlation
of ACE I/D gene polymorphisms and AF in populations in
different areas and further assessed the incidence of AF,
using the recessive model of D/D vs. I/D+I/I and the domi-
nant model of D/D+I/D vs. I/I.
Methods
Inclusion criteria
Studies were selected based on the following criteria: (1)
case-control or cohort studies; (2) studies examining the
relationship between ACE I/D gene polymorphisms and risk
of AF; (3) patients diagnosed with AF based on history and
electrocardiography (ECG); (4) diagnosis points of ECG
and/or 24-hour Holter monitoring as follows: absolutely
irregular ventricular rate, Pwave disappearance and replace-
ment by fluctuation with irregular size and shape (f wave),
general atrial frequency >350 times/minute; and (5) both
cases and controls reporting genotype or allele frequencies.
The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies that did
not fit within the selected conditions; (2) studies with repeti-
tive data; and (3) studies with familial AF patients.
Search strategies
Embase, PubMed, WanFangData, and China National
Knowledge Infrastructure were searched for studies
between 1990 and 2013, using the keywords: "angioten-
sin-converting enzyme," "I/D," "gene polymorphisms"
and "atrial fibrillation."
Data extraction
Data were extracted by scanning the title and abstract, and
cross-checked by two independent investigators.Variations
were resolved by a third reviewer. Data extracted included:
(1) surname of first author; (2) year of publication; (3)
characteristics of study population, including country, eth-
nicity, age and sample size; (4) ACE genotypes; and (5)
genotype distribution and allele frequency for the ACE I/D
polymorphisms. Research quality was assessed according
to the established methods of the Cochrane Collaboration
(Table 1).
Statistical analysis
In the meta-analysis, allelic (distribution of the D allelic
frequency of ACE I/D gene polymorphisms), recessive
(D/D vs. (I/D+I/I)), and dominant ((D/D +I/D) vs. I/I)
genetic models were performed. Statistical analyses were
performed with Stata 12.0 software. The observed frequen-
cies of genotypes in the control group were tested for con-
formation to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.16 The
relationship between ACE I/D gene polymorphisms andAF
was assessed taking odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs). If the 2 test for heterogeneity was signifi-
cant, we used a random-effects model to calculate the
pooled effect, which was used to calculate within-study and
between-study variance. Alternatively, a fixed-effects
model would be used to calculate the pooled effect. The
funnel plot and Egger's test checked for publication bias,
while the influence analyses examined whether the results
were important to the meta-analysis.
Results
Eligible studies
Seventy-nine studies were selected from the databases,
and 43 were excluded based on the titles and abstracts.
Thirteen of the remaining 36 studies were excluded. Five
of them were excluded because they were duplicate publi-
cations and three because they were meta-analyses of the
relationship between the ACE I/D gene polymorphisms
and AF. We excluded three articles because of missing data
for the genotyping frequency and two others that had no
control group. Meta-analysis of the correlation between
the ACE I/D gene polymorphism and risk of AF was con-
ducted on the remaining 23 studies, which were based on
research from Japan, China, Italy, Netherlands, USA,
Romania, Greece, Brazil and Turkey (Figure 1).
Meta-analysis
In the 23 studies, all the genotypes in the control group fit
the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. ACE I/D gene polymor-
phisms andAF had no significant correlation with allelic D
frequency of ACE I/D, using the random-effects model
(OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 0.99­1.40; Figure 1) and the domi-
nant model (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.98­1.52). In contrast,
there was a significant association in the recessive geno-
type (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.16­1.72; Figure 2).
Bias diagnostics
The publication bias of the 23 remaining studies was esti-
mated by funnel plot and Egger's test. In the funnel plot, there
was no obvious publication bias (T= 1.71, p = 0.087). Egger's
Ma et al. 795
test revealed no marked differences (p = 0.137; Figure 3),
indicating that the 23 studies had no obvious publication bias.
Sensitivity analysis
A sensitivity analysis was conducted to establish whether
the individual studies influenced the pooled ORs. We omit-
ted one study at a time and calculated pooled ORs for the
remaining studies. None of the individual studies affected
pooled ORs, ranging from 0.99 (95% CI = 0.96­1.03) to
1.40 (95% CI = 1.35­1.44), for the association between
ACE I/D polymorphisms and AF (Figure 4), signifying that
the results of the meta-analysis were reliable and stable.
Subgroup analyses
We subsequently performed subgroup analyses stratified
by population ethnicity. No correlation between ACE I/D
polymorphisms and AF was observed under allelic D with
the random-effects model (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 0.94­
1.43), with dominance (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 0.90­1.57),
in contrast to the significant association demonstrated with
the recessive model (OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.19­1.80) in
the Asian population (Figure 5). Similarly, we found that
ACE I/D gene polymorphisms were not related to AF
under allelic D using the random-effects model (OR =
1.20, 95% CI = 0.88­1.63), with dominance (OR = 1.24,
95% CI = 0.82­1.88), while the recessive genotype (OR =
1.42, 95% CI = 1.01­1.99) showed significance in the
Caucasian population (Figure 6).
Ultimately, the subgroup analysis separated by popula-
tion ethnicity showed that the relationship between the
ACE I/D polymorphisms and AF had an obvious correla-
tion only under the recessive model. The ACE I/D gene
polymorphisms were associated with AF using the reces-
sive model in the subgroup analysis.
Discussion
Our meta-analysis helped to ascertain whether ACE I/D gene
polymorphisms had an apparent correlation with AF. Our
results provide sufficient evidence of a relationship between
the D/D genetic variant and AF. A similar association was
observed in subgroup analyses stratified by ethnicity.
Our study strongly suggested that ACE D/D is a risk
factor for AF. However, a meta-analysis in 2011 showed
that there was no significant evidence to show that ACE
I/D polymorphism was related to AF.10 There were 7577
patients in the 2011 analysis of 18 case-control studies,
and the additive genetic model used D/D vs. I/I. However,
our analysis included 23 case-control studies with 9262
patients, and the additive genetic model was D vs. I. By

analyzing more cases and using a different method, our
results show that the ACE I/D gene polymorphism is
related to AF.
Recent research has shown that activation of RAAS is
important for AF.33­35 RAAS is the key mechanism of
atrial remodeling, which is believed to be the main cause
of AF. The ACE I/D gene polymorphisms are related to the
activity of angiotensin, which is the main effective compo-
nent of the RAAS. ACE converts angiotensin I to angio-
tensinII,whichmaypromotecardiomyocytehypertrophy,36

previous study has linked the ACE D/D genotype with
higher plasma levels and increased ACE activity.8 Recent
clinical evidence shows that RAAS inhibition with ACE
inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers suppresses
left ventricular dysfunction and hypertrophy in AF
patients.40
Theoretically, the ACE D/D genotype may promote
angiotensin II production and atrial fibrosis through
increasing ACE activity, leading to atrial structural

remodeling and promotion of AF. Consistent with this
assumption, our results showed that the ACE D/D geno-
type is significantly related to AF. However, it is not the
only reason for development of AF. There are many genes
in the RAAS, and some studies have shown that other gene
polymorphisms in the RAAS are related to AF.9,25,26 Future
research can investigate the association between the RAAS
and AF.
Subsequent sensitivity analysis showed that, even after
excluding one study at a time and calculating pooled ORs
for the remaining studies, the results of the main meta-anal-
ysis were reliable and stable. The funnel plot and Egger's
test indicated no significant publication bias. Subgroup
analysis by ethnicity was performed to investigate the dif-
ferent causes of AF among distinct populations.
It should be noted that our study had several limitations.
First, we did not consider other influences on AF, such as
age, smoking, hypertension, and other cardiovascular dis-
eases, that could have led to potential bias. Second, ACE I/D
gene polymorphism is not the only cause of AF, and gene-
gene and gene-environment interactions also play an impor-
tant role in the development and perpetuation of AF. Owing
to the lack of related data, these interactions were not
included in our study. Finally, meta-analysis is a retrospec-
tive research technique, and it has methodological defects,
therefore, our data should be interpreted with caution.
Conclusions
Our results provide sufficient evidence to show that ACE
I/D gene polymorphisms are related to AF. Subgroup anal-
ysis revealed a significant correlation in different ethnic
populations in the recessive model. Comprehensive meta-
analysis further demonstrated that the D/D genetic variant
is highly associated with AF. However, ACE I/D gene
polymorphisms are not the only cause of AF, and further
studies are essential to elucidate the potential relationship
between the RAAS and AF.
