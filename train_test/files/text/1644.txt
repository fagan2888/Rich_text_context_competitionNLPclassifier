Objectives: To identify ages when adolescents were in
sexual maturity stages 2 through 5; to explain the rela-
tions between breast (girls), genital (boys), and pubic hair
(girls and boys) development between ages 91/2 and 151/2
years; and to evaluate synchrony of pubertal develop-
ment across characteristics.
Design: Annual pubertal assessments.
Setting: Ten locations in the United States.
Participants: A total of 859 adolescents (427 boys
[49.7%] and 432 girls [50.3%]; 737 white [85.8%] and
122 black [14.2%]).
Main Outcome Measures: Changes in the 5 stages
of breast, genital, and pubic hair development.
Results: Girls were in breast maturity stages 2 and 3 ear-
lier than comparable pubic hair stages. Although breast
development in girls started earlier than pubic hair de-
velopment, girls completed breast and pubic hair devel-
opment at approximately the same age. Black girls were
in all stages of breast and pubic hair development ear-
lier than white girls. Boys were in stages 2, 3, 4, and 5 of
genital development before the comparable pubic hair
stage. In boys, genital development started earlier than
pubic hair development, but pubic hair development was
completed in less time. Black boys were in genital and
pubic hair development about 7 months earlier than white
boys. Black and white boys completed genital develop-
ment in approximately 41/2 years, but black boys took ap-
proximately 6 months longer than white boys to com-
plete pubic hair development. At stage 2, for 66.2% of
girls, breast development preceded their pubic hair de-
velopment; for 91.1% of boys, genital development pre-
ceded their pubic hair development.
Conclusions: The results of this study are useful in un-
derstanding normative variation in the timing and change
in the development of secondary sexual characteristics
at puberty. They will help identify adolescents with atypi-
cal changes in sexual maturation and unusual progres-
sion of sexual maturation and growth disorders.

MOST RESEARCH ON PU-
bertal development is
cross-sectional,involv-
ing different adoles-
cents assessed at dif-
ferent ages. Such research is not positioned
to characterize change in secondary sexual
characteristics--genitals, breasts, and pu-
bic hair--that represent different physi-
ological processes. The available longitu-
dinal evidence is outdated or covers a
limited age span.1 Current information on
timing of puberty (ie, age at which ado-
lescents are in each sexual maturity stage)
and change in secondary sexual charac-
teristics (ie, how quickly individuals
progress from one stage to the next) is im-
portant for understanding the etiology of
pubertal disorders as well as normal de-
velopment. It is also important to under-
stand individual-level synchrony (ie, char-
acteristics developing concurrently) or
asynchrony (ie, one characteristic devel-
ops before the other) in pubertal devel-
opment, given that asynchrony has impli-
cations for health problems.2
This investigation was motivated by
new findings2 and previous work.3-5 It is
not known whether patterns of thelarche
and pubarche established at pubertal
onset are sustained longitudinally, or
whether patterns of asynchrony are ob-
served among boys. The present study
aimed to (1) identify ages when adoles-
cents were in sexual maturity stages 2
through 5 (Tanner criteria)6-8 for each
secondary sexual characteristic; (2) ex-
plain the relation of development across
pubertal characteristics; and (3) evaluate
synchrony of pubertal development
across characteristics. A secondary goal
was to investigate whether racial differ-

METHOD
STUDY POPULATION
The multisite Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development (NICHD) Study of Early Child
Care and Youth Development was designed to evaluate the ef-
fects of nonmaternal care on children's functioning. In 1990,
10 university-based sites recruited participants from desig-
nated hospitals in Little Rock, Arkansas; Irvine, California;
Lawrence,Kansas;Boston,Massachusetts;PhiladelphiaandPitts-
burgh, Pennsylvania; Charlottesville, Virginia; Seattle, Wash-
ington; Hickory and Morgantown, North Carolina; and Madi-
son, Wisconsin. Children were followed up from birth to age
151/2 years (1991-2006) with a common study protocol. An-
nually from ages 91/2 to 151/2 years (2000-2006), staging of sec-
ondary sexual characteristics was performed by a nurse prac-
titioner or physician. Institutional review boards at each
university and the data coordinating center approved the study.
Families gave written consent and children gave assent. See a
previously published NICHD Early Child Care Research Net-
work study9 for detailed recruitment and selection procedures
and http://secc.rti.org for study procedures.
Healthy newborns of English-speaking mothers were re-
cruited. Attempts were made to contact 3015 families meeting
enrollment eligibility requirements 2 weeks after birth. Of 1526
families contacted, 1364 (89.4%) completed the 1-month home
visit before becoming study participants. There were no sig-
nificant differences between these 1364 families and the 1990
US population,10 except that the study sample had slightly more
married couples than the US population (76.7% vs 74.2%;
P=.04).
From enrollment to age 91/2 years, approximately 20% of
the sample was lost to follow-up; moving and time constraints
were the major reasons for attrition. Dropouts were more likely
to have lower maternal education and to be nonwhite. Be-
tween ages 91/2 and 151/2 years, the cohort lost an additional
8.1%, but this attrition was random in terms of sex, annual fam-
ily income, years of maternal education, or race/ethnicity.
DEMOGRAPHIC AND
CHILD CHARACTERISTICS
Child sex, race/ethnicity, and years of maternal education were
reported at 1 month. Only white and black participants are in-
cluded in this report because the numbers of other minorities
were too small. Family income when the child was 91/2 years
old was converted to an income-to-needs ratio based on fed-
eral poverty guidelines (ratio 2.0 represents low income).11
PUBERTAL DEVELOPMENT
Boys' and girls' sexual maturity stage was assessed using Tan-
ner criteria.7,8,12 Girls' sexual maturity staging was based on in-
structions from the American Academy of Pediatrics Assess-
ment of Sexual Maturity Stages in Girls,5 augmented with breast
bud palpation (except for the assessment at age 91/2 years). The
assessment of stage of sexual maturity is based on photos of
the 5 sexual maturity stages (1 indicates prepuberty and 5, full
sexual maturity) that were used in the Pediatric Research in
Office Settings Network study of pubertal development.5 Boys'
sexual maturity stage was assessed using Tanner's original cri-
teria.6 For boys and girls, sexual maturity stage is determined
by comparing the adolescent's sexual development with the se-
ries of photographs showing sexual maturity as stages of breast,
genital, and pubic hair development. Annual examinations iden-
tified sexual maturity stage (1-5) for breast development in girls,
genital development in boys, and pubic hair development in
both. If a child was between 2 stages, the examiners gave the
child the lower stage rating. Examinations continued for girls
until menarche and stage 5 breast and pubic hair development
were achieved and for boys until stage 5 genital and pubic hair
development were achieved. Beginning at age 101/2, girls re-
ported annually whether menstruation had begun and age at
first menses. Annual maternal report was used if daughter's self-
report was missing (n=117).
Centralized training was provided to all examiners before
the first pubertal assessments. Physicians and nurse practition-
ers were annually recertified (requiring 87.5% accuracy) by rat-
ing stages of pubertal development using photos from the Pe-
diatric Research in Office Settings Network study of pubertal
development5 for girls and Tanner photos for boys.13
MISSING DATA
Participation at each annual examination for 859 children was
asfollows:age91/2 years,781(90.9%);age101/2 years,700(81.5%);
age 111/2 years, 668 (77.8%); age 121/2 years, 662 (77.1%); age
131/2 years, 645 (75.1%); age 141/2 years, 616 (71.7%); and age
151/2 years, 598 (69.6%). To address missing-data problems, we
imputed 20 data sets (10 each for boys and girls)14-16 and con-
ducted analyses separately on each data set. Test statistics and
coefficients were averaged across analyses, separately for boys
and girls, and coefficient standard errors were calculated by com-
bining within- and between-model variability.15
STATISTICAL PROCEDURES
All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS statistical soft-
ware, version 9.1.3 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina);
all tests were 2-tailed. Significant differences between chil-
dren with and without sexual maturity data for all categorical
variables were evaluated using 2 tests; continuous variables
were evaluated using t tests, assuming unequal variance.
Estimating Age of Sexual Maturity Stage
The ages that girls and boys were in each sexual maturity stage
(2-5) were estimated for each secondary sexual characteristic
in separate logistic regressions: breast (girls), genital (boys),
and pubic hair (girls and boys). For this analysis, whether an
adolescent was in a particular sexual maturity stage at each as-
sessment was dichotomized (0 vs 1). The probability of being
in a stage was estimated at a given age and was modeled using
a random coefficient logistic model with the dichotomized in-
dicator of being in a particular stage as the dependent variable
and age at each assessment (in years) as the independent vari-
able. The intercept was treated as random (ie, individual-level
variation was allowed), whereas the effect of age was fixed. The
ages at which the individual had a 50% or greater likelihood of
being in the particular sexual maturity stage for breast and pu-
bic hair development (girls) or genital and pubic hair devel-
opment (boys) were estimated.
Once the ages of being in the various sexual maturity stages
for the different secondary sexual characteristics were esti-
mated, differences across time and across characteristics were
modeled using a doubly repeated measures analysis of vari-
ance. For these analyses, the estimated ages were the depen-
dent variables, and sexual maturity stage (2-5) and secondary
sexual characteristics (breast or pubic hair for girls; genital or

pubic hair for boys) were repeated (independent) factors. Ad-
ditional models added between-subjects factors for menarche
(girls only), race (black vs white), years of maternal educa-
tion, and family income-to-needs ratio. Finally, the length of
time (in years) that girls and boys remained in puberty was cal-
culated as the difference between the ages that individuals were
estimated to be in sexual maturity stage 5 and sexual maturity
stage 2 (eAppendix; available at http://www.archpediatrics
.com).
Estimating Synchrony vs Asynchrony
The estimated age that each individual was predicted to be in
each sexual maturity stage for breast (girls) or genital (boys)
and pubic hair (girls and boys) was used to determine syn-
chrony of pubertal maturation. Given that there is no consen-
sus about what qualifies as a synchronous pattern, we defined
synchronous development as secondary sexual characteristics
being in the same sexual maturity stage within approximately
4 months of each other. This standard was based on prior lon-
gitudinal work.17 In an individual, if the difference in the esti-
mated age of the 2 secondary sexual characteristics was more
than 4 months, development was classified as breast or genital
first or pubic hair first. Using age estimates obtained from the
random coefficients logistic regression, the differences be-
tween the estimated ages for breast vs pubic hair development
(girls) and for genital vs pubic hair development (boys) were
calculated. Children were then classified as to whether they
exhibited synchrony (difference 4 months) or asynchrony
(breast or genital development 4 months earlier than pubic
hair development or pubic hair development 4 months ear-
lier than breast or genital development) for each sexual matu-
rity stage.
RESULTS
As shown in Table 1, 373 white girls (43.4%), 59
black girls (6.9%), 364 white boys (42.4%), and 63
black boys (7.3%) had valid pubertal measurements for
at least 1 of the 7 assessments (taken annually from
ages 91/2 to 151/2 years), thereby qualifying them for
inclusion in the study. Girls had more valid data at all
ages than did boys. Overall, 373 girls (86.3%) and 364
boys (85.2%) were white, 93 girls (23.4%) and 98 boys
(24.5%) were classified as low income at age 91/2 years,
and mother's mean (SD) years of education was 14.5
(2.4) for girls and 14.3 (2.4) for boys. (The low income
percentages are based on numbers of participants who
had income data at age 91/2 years [ie, 397 of 432 girls
and 400 of 427 boys].) Maternal age at the time the
child was born was greater for the analysis group
(mean, 28.9 years; 95% confidence interval, 28.4-29.4
years) than for girls not included in the analysis (27.7
years; 26.7-28.6 years). No significant differences
existed for race, early family income-to-needs ratio, or
years of maternal education. For boys, no significant
differences emerged on any of these background factors
for those included and not included in the analyses.
The eFigure shows the distribution of each sexual ma-
turity stage, by age and race, for breast and pubic hair
development for girls and for genital and pubic hair de-
velopment for boys. At age 91/2 years, most white girls
showed no evidence of breast (56.2%) or pubic hair
(71.5%) development; in contrast, most black girls showed

some evidence of breast (69.0%) or pubic hair (59.2%)
development. By age 151/2 years, most white girls were
in sexual maturity stage 5 for breast (79.5%) or pubic hair
(81.9%) development; similarly, most black girls were
in sexual maturity stage 5 for breast (84.1%) or pubic hair
(92.5%) development. At age 91/2 years, more than two-
thirds of white boys showed no evidence of puberty for
genital (72.8%) or pubic hair (91.9%) development; less
than half of the black boys showed some evidence of pu-
berty for genital (47.9%) or pubic hair development
(33.8%). At age 151/2 years, most white boys were in sexual
maturity stage 5 for genital (67.3%) or pubic hair (58.7%)
development; similarly, most black boys were in sexual
maturity stage 5 for genital (81.0%) or pubic hair (71.3%)
development.
GIRLS' PUBERTAL DEVELOPMENT
Overall, girls' breast development occurred earlier than
pubic hair development (F1,431
=52.25; P.001). This
effect, however, was moderated by the stage being ex-
amined (F3,1293
=53.29; P.001). Girls were in stage 2
breast development a mean of 5.0 months earlier than
stage 2 pubic hair development and were in stage 3 breast
development a mean of 2.2 months earlier than stage 3
pubic hair development. There were no statistically sig-
nificant differences between breast and pubic hair de-
velopment in terms of the ages at which girls were in stages
4 and 5 (Table 2).
On average, girls took 1.5 years to develop from
one sexual maturity stage of breast development to the
next; girls took slightly less time (mean, 1.3 years) to
develop from one sexual maturity stage of pubic hair
to the next. Overall, girls took between 4 and 41/2
years to go from sexual maturity stage 2 (beginning of
puberty) to sexual maturity stage 5 (full maturity)
(Table 3).
When age of menarche was added to the repeated-
measures analysis of variance as a between-subjects fac-
tor, we found a significant main effect for age of menar-
che (F1,407
=435.72; P.001), and significant interactions
between age of menarche and sexual maturity stage
(F3,1221
=7.62;P.001)andbetweenageofmenarche,char-
acteristic (breast or pubic hair), and sexual maturity stage
(F1,1221
=4.54;P=.004).Asexpected,ifgirlswereolderwhen
they experienced menarche they were also older when in
all sexual maturity stages for breast and pubic hair devel-
opment (B's range, 0.41-0.48 for age at breast develop-
ment stages 2-5 and 0.36-0.53 for age at pubic hair devel-
opment stages 2-5; P .001 for all). (B indicates
unstandardized regression coefficient.) Age of menarche
had a stronger positive relationship with age at develop-
mental stages 3 and 4 (B's range, 0.47-0.53) than it did with
age of being in stage 2 (B=0.41 for breast development and
0.36 for pubic hair development). The relationship be-
tween age of menarche and age at breast development stage
5 declined to a B of 0.42, whereas the relationship be-
tween age of menarche and age at pubic hair develop-
ment stage 5 remained relatively higher (B=0.48).
BOYS' PUBERTAL DEVELOPMENT
Overall, boys were in each sexual maturity stage for geni-
tal development before they were in the same stage for
pubic hair development (F1,426
=821.26; P.001); this
effect was moderated by the stage being examined
(F3,1278
=411.40; P.001). Stage 2 genital development
was earlier than stage 2 pubic hair development by a mean
of 1.1 years; stage 3, 3.9 months earlier; stage 4, 1.5 months
earlier; and stage 5, 2.3 months earlier (Table 4).
On average, boys took 2 years to go from stage 2 to
stage 3 genital development and 1.3 years to go from stage
2 to stage 3 pubic hair development. The change from
stage 3 to stage 4 was shorter, taking 1.1 years for geni-
tal development and 10.8 months for pubic hair devel-
opment. The change from stage 4 to stage 5 took ap-
proximately 1.4 years for both genital and pubic hair
development. Overall, boys took approximately 41/2 years

and 31/2 years to go from sexual maturity stage 2 (begin-
ning of puberty) to sexual maturity stage 5 (full devel-
opment) for genital and pubic hair, respectively
(Table 5).
SYNCHRONY/ASYNCHRONY
At the onset of puberty, most girls (66.2%) were esti-
mated to be at sexual maturity stage 2 for breast devel-
opment at least 4 months before stage 2 for pubic hair
development (ie, breast-first pattern) (Table 6). At later
maturity stages, girls' development tended to become more
synchronous, with 51.4% estimated to be in sexual ma-
turity stage 5 for breast and pubic hair development within
approximately 4 months of each other.
At the onset of puberty, most boys (91.1%) were es-
timated to be in sexual maturity stage 2 for genital de-
velopment at least 4 months before stage 2 for pubic hair
development (ie, genital-first pattern) (Table 6). At later
maturity stages, boys' development remained asynchro-
nous, with 74.7% still showing the genital-first pattern
for being in sexual maturity stage 5.
RACIAL DIFFERENCES
IN PUBERTAL DEVELOPMENT
On average, black girls were in each sexual maturity
stage for breast and for pubic hair development ap-
proximately 9 months earlier than white girls (Table 2)

when controlling for family income-to-needs ratio
(measured at age 91/2 years) and years of maternal edu-
cation at the time of participants' birth. Only one inter-
action between puberty characteristic and family in-
come-to-needs ratio was significant (F1,393
=8.33;
P=.004) and indicated that girls from higher-income
homes experienced later breast development than did
girls from lower-income homes.
Similar to black and white girls, black boys were in
each stage of genital and pubic hair development earlier
than white boys (Table 4) (F1,425
=89.07; P.001). The
discrepancy between ages that black and white boys were
in each stage was greater for earlier stages (range, 9.6
months-1.0 years earlier for stage 2) than it was for later
stages (7.2 months earlier for stage 5) (F3,1275
=7.36;
P.001). With demographic factors controlled, these re-
sults remained unchanged.
COMMENT
This report, to our knowledge, presents one of the most
detailed longitudinal studies of pubertal development in
boys and girls conducted to date. Yearly assessments of
breast, genital, and pubic hair growth allowed us to ana-
lyze the ages at which adolescents were in each sexual ma-
turity stage and the time it took to go from one stage to
the next. We also examined synchrony and asynchrony in
secondary sexual characteristics in white and black youth.
Breast development in girls and genital development
in boys tended to begin before pubic hair development.
But pubic hair development occurred faster across the
stages than did genitals or breasts. In addition, syn-
chrony between breast or genital and pubic hair stages
tended to increase with advancing stages.
Our findings are consistent with cross-sectional stud-
ies showing that girls' pubertal development occurs ear-
lier than boys', a putative consequence of earlier estro-
gen synthesis.18 Our observation that breast development
in girls and genital development in boys precedes pubic
hair development is also consistent with previous stud-
ies,1,2,17 with some exceptions.3
Although Biro et al2 estimated asynchrony in early pu-
berty, we extended this analysis by assessing synchrony
or asynchrony at 4 sexual maturity stages (2-5). At the
early stages of puberty, we typically observed asyn-
chrony between breast and pubic hair stage in girls and
genital and pubic hair stage in boys. At later stages of
sexual maturity, although development in boys re-
mained asynchronous, breast development and pubic hair
development in girls tended to become more synchro-
nous. The pattern in girls is believed to result from the
earlier timing of hormonal changes, starting with the ini-
tiation of cyclic gonadotropin-releasing hormone of a mag-
nitude sufficient to stimulate gonadotropin and estro-
gen production,19 which stimulates growth of breast tissue.
Pubic hair growth is stimulated by testosterone and ad-

renal hormones but appears to respond more slowly to
neuroendocrine changes in early puberty. Girls who fol-
low the breast-first pattern may have higher estrogen lev-
els and be more at risk as adults for estrogen-related dis-
eases, such as breast cancer, than those following a pubic
hair­first pattern.
Findings indicate that, at any age, black adolescents
are more advanced than white adolescents in pubertal de-
velopment, consistent with prior research.5,20,21 The ear-
lier onset of puberty in black youth has been attributed
to genetic factors, higher body mass index, and nutri-
tional factors.20 No ethnic differences were observed in
the length of time it took to progress from one sexual
maturity stage to the next for girls. In contrast, sexual
development in black boys took longer than in white boys.
These detailed findings suggest that pubertal devel-
opment cannot be described exclusively in terms of a
simple onset and termination because different second-
ary sexual characteristics develop on different sched-
ules that show varying degrees of timing, depending on
sex and ethnicity. For future research, the present find-
ings raise the question of whether previously reported
risks for morbidity related to the timing of puberty on-
set (eg, metabolic syndrome and reproductive malignan-
cies22) are associated solely with entry into puberty or
whether continuing asynchrony in secondary sexual char-
acteristics might also be associated with morbidity.
Although drawn from sites distributed throughout the
United States, and reflecting a range of economic, so-
cial, and educational backgrounds, the sample is not rep-
resentative of the US population because it is not a prob-
ability sample. The findings may also be biased because
of dropouts and missing data. Otherwise-eligible chil-
dren whose mothers were known drug users or who did
not intend to continue living near a study site were ex-
cluded from the study. An additional limitation of the
study is that at the assessment at age 91/2 years, we did
not use breast bud palpation, which may have led to an
underestimation of the percentage of girls at develop-
mental stage 2. Nonetheless, this research used a highly
reliable protocol for assessing pubertal development.
CONCLUSIONS
The descriptive findings from this study are useful in un-
derstanding normative variation in the timing and change
in secondary sexual characteristics at puberty. They will
help identify children with atypical changes in sexual
maturation and unusual progression of sexual matura-
tion and growth disorders. Replication of this study in a
representative sample is now needed.
