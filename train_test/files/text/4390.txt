Introduction
Childhood cancer consists of various malignancies and has
become the second most frequent cause of child death in the
developed world. The most common childhood cancers
include leukemia, malignancies of the central nervous sys-
tem, and lymphoma, accounting for 34%, 23%, and 12% of
all childhood cancers, respectively.1 Despite the improved
survival rate of childhood malignancy, several solid cancers
remain refractory to treatment. The discomfort that occurs
during the treatment course, such as nausea, vomiting, and
pain, is difficult to bear for these patients. The long-term
toxicity and sequelae of chemotherapy and radiotherapy
continue to be concerning. The survivors may develop
chronic health conditions and suffer from chronic fatigue,
sleep disorders, psychological distress, neurocognitive dys-
function, and a poor health-related quality of life. Another
reason for complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)
use in children with cancer is the parents'desire to do every-
thing possible to improve their child's health.
CAM has become popular in the past few decades. The
prevalence of CAM varies across different countries, rang-
ing from 6% to 91% in recent studies.2 CAM therapies used
in pediatric cancer are mostly considered to be supportive

Abstract
Background. Large-scale surveys of complementary traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) use in pediatric cancer patients are
lacking. The aim of our study was to investigate the use of TCM in pediatric cancer patients. Methods. We analyzed cancer
patients younger than 18 years (n = 12
965) who were registered in the National Health Insurance Research Database
in Taiwan between 2001 and 2011. Patients were categorized into TCM or non­TCM users based on their use of TCM.
Results. In Taiwan, 8086 (62.4%) children with cancer sought TCM treatment at some point. Children in older age groups,
including school-aged children and adolescents, were more likely to use TCM. There was no significant difference in
the distributions of gender and urbanization. The 3 most common diseases for which TCM users visited the clinic were
neoplasm (33.2%), respiratory system disease (32.9%), and infectious disease (8.86%). The most commonly utilized TCM
therapy was Chinese herbal remedies. Patients who had comorbid conditions such as allergic rhinitis, dyspepsia, disorders
of menstruation, and disease of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue tended to visit TCM clinics. Conclusions.
Adjunctive TCM use is not low in Taiwanese children with cancer. Further studies to investigate the efficacy and safety of
TCM in children with cancer are warranted.

therapies for relieving the symptoms of cancer, reducing
pain, or alleviating the side effects of conventional cancer
treatment.3 Some parents hope to boost the immune system
of the affected child using CAM therapies.4 Traditional
Chinese medicine (TCM) consists of Chinese herbal reme-
dies, acupuncture, and manipulative therapies and was
defined by the United States National Center for
Complementary and Integrative Health as a whole medical
system of CAM.5 TCM is one of the most common CAM
therapies used in various diseases such as stroke,6 diabetes
mellitus,7 rheumatoid arthritis,8 and cancer9 in Taiwan.
Current studies on the use of CAM among pediatric cancer
patients are mostly small-scale studies.10 One large-scale
study of the use of CAM in pediatric oncology patients in
Germany reported that half of the children with cancer had
used CAM but did not report which types of CAM therapy
the children had received. A large-scale nationwide survey
of TCM use in pediatric cancer patients is yet to be per-
formed in childhood cancer.
The National Health Insurance (NHI) program was insti-
tuted in Taiwan in 1995. This program is a single-payer
mandatory insurance system and has covered the medical
expenditures of approximately 23 million people, account-
ing for 99.6% of the total population.11 Although Western
medicine is in the mainstream in Taiwan, TCM is also
widely used, including in the pediatric population. The NHI
program has reimbursed both Western medicine and TCM.
This system also provided unbiased economic choices for
cancer treatment. All registration files and original claims
data for reimbursement were recorded in the National
Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Studies
have reported the characteristics of TCM use among the
general pediatric population5 and children with allergies12-14
in Taiwan using the NHIRD.
The aim of our study was to investigate the characteris-
tics of TCM use in pediatric cancer patients. We enrolled
every Taiwanese child with cancer who was registered as
having catastrophic illness in the NHIRD. The results of
this study could offer epidemiological information about
TCM applied in pediatric cancer patients.
Materials and Methods
Data Source
The NHI program has provided reimbursement for TCM
since 1996. Reimbursed TCM services include Chinese
herbal remedies, acupuncture/moxibustion, and manipulative
therapy in ambulatory clinics.All registry data in the NHIRD
consist of demographic characteristics, clinical visits, hospi-
talizations, diagnostic codes, assessments, procedures, pre-
scriptions, and the medical costs for reimbursement. The
registry for catastrophic illnesses patient database (RCIPD)
was also established in the NHIRD. Pediatric cancers are
considered to be catastrophic illnesses and are registered by
certificate by pathology, image study, laboratory survey, and
careful review by pediatric hematologists or oncologists
commissioned by the NHI Administration. These cancer
patients hold catastrophic illness certificates (CICs) and are
eligible for exclusion from copayments. Because the copay-
ments are waived for admission, emergency visits, and out-
patient services, this certification is only applied when the
patients meet all the criteria by pathology, image, laboratory,
and clinical diagnoses. The CIC is canceled if a patient dies.
The accuracy of the diagnosis in the cancer population
enrolled in this study was high. All the claims data in the
study were from the RCIPD of the NHIRD in Taiwan.
Study Participants
We selected pediatric cancer patients from the RCIPD.
First, all beneficiaries who had a diagnosis of cancer
(International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] codes: 140-208) and
were registered in the RCIPD as having had a catastrophic
illness between January 2001 and December 2011 were
included in this study. Second, individuals (n = 12
965)
younger than 18 years of age were selected for this study
cohort and included in the study. Those pediatric cancer
patients who had at least 1 TCM outpatient clinical record
were defined as TCM users (n = 8086), whereas children
who had no TCM outpatient records were defined as non­
TCM users (n = 4879). We divided the study cohort into
infants and toddlers (0-2 years old), preschoolers (3-5 years
old), school-aged children (6-12 years old), and adolescents
(13-18 years old) to analyze the differences among various
age groups.
To investigate the differences between urban and rural
areas, we used the definition of urbanization of the resi-
dence area that was described in a previous study.15 The
residence area of the Taiwan townships was divided into 4
levels of urbanization. Level 1 had the highest degree of
urbanization, and level 4 had the lowest degree. These 4
levels were categorized by population density (people/km2),
by the population ratio of different educational levels, the
ratio of elderly people, the ratio of agricultural workers, and
the number of physicians per 100000 people. Urbanization
levels 1 and 2 were defined as urban areas, and levels 3 and
4 were defined as rural areas.
Data Availability Statement
All data are deposited in a properly managed public reposi-
tory. In this study, we examined and analyzed datasets
released from the NHIRD (http://nhird.nhri.org.tw/en/
Data_Subsets.html), which are maintained and managed by
National Health Research Institutes (http://nhird.nhri.org.
tw/en), Taiwan.

Statistical Analysis
All the data were analyzed by SAS software, version 9.2
(SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Univariate analysis was used
to compare the TCM users with the non­TCM users. The 2
test was performed to examine the relationship between the
categorical variables and to examine the differences
between TCM users and non­TCM users. The incidence
rate ratio indicated the extent of the prevalence of disease in
the TCM user group relative to the non­TCM users. A P
value <.05 was defined as statistically significant.
Ethics Statement
TheResearchEthicsCommitteeofChinaMedicalUniversity
and Hospital (CMUH104-REC2-115) approved this study.
The NHIRD was provided by the NHI Administration and
managed by the National Health Research Institutes, Taiwan.
All the released datasets of the NHIRD were deidentified
and encrypted. Therefore, it was impossible to identify indi-
vidual patients and care providers at any level.
Results
A total of 12965 children who had CICs of cancer between
2001 and 2011 were enrolled in this study. Among them,
8086 (62.4%) children with cancer wereTCM users, whereas
4879 (37.6%) children with cancer were non­TCM users.
The demographic characteristics between TCM users and
non­TCM users are shown in Table 1. There were significant
differences in the proportional distributions of age between
the TCM users and non­TCM users. The percentage of TCM
use increased significantly in the older age groups, which
included school-aged children and adolescents. The percent-
age of TCM users in the younger age groups, including
infants, toddlers, and preschool children, was significantly
lower than that of the non­TCM users. There was no signifi-
cant difference in the distributions of sex and urbanization.
All the pediatric cancer patients were diagnosed as having
catastrophic diseases by hematologists or oncologists.
Therefore, they all received diagnoses and visited Western
medical doctors whether they were TCM users or non­TCM
users. The percentage of patients receiving chemotherapy or
radiotherapy was similar between these 2 groups. We found
that only 4 patients did not visit Western medical clinics after
diagnosis--that is, 99.95% of the TCM users still visited
Western medicine clinics. Treatment, including chemother-
apy and radiotherapy, was similar between these 2 groups.
The mean number of visits to the outpatient clinics in the 2
populations was similar, but the proportional distribution was
not. The majority (90.3%) of the TCM users visited TCM
clinics fewer than 5 times annually.
To determine the frequency distribution of clinical visits
between TCM and non­TCM users in the pediatric cancer
population, we analyzed the ICD-9-CM codes from the
claims data (Table 2). The 3 leading diseases for which TCM
users visited the clinics, including TCM or Western medi-
cine consultations, were neoplasm (33.2%), respiratory sys-
tem disease (32.9%), and infectious and parasitic diseases
(8.86%), whereas non­TCM users visited Western clinics
for respiratory system disease (35.2%), neoplasm (28.6%),
and digestive system disease (10%). The rankings of these
disease categories were identical except the category "cer-
tain conditions originating in the perinatal period" (Table 2).
To delineate the distribution of cancer categories between
TCM and non­TCM users, we analyzed the ICD-9-CM
codes of registry for catastrophic illnesses in these patients.
The top 10 cancer types of clinical visits in the TCM and
non-TCM groups among different age groups are shown in
Table 3. In general, the TCM users had similar distribution
(ranking) of cancer types as the non­TCM users. The 3 lead-
ing cancer types were leukemia (ICD code: 204-208), malig-
nant neoplasm of the brain (ICD code: 191), and malignant
neoplasm of the eye, nervous system, and other specified
sites (ICD code: 190, 192-199). There was a higher percent-
age of children with leukemia (ICD code: 204-208) who
chose only Western medicine (48%) rather than TCM
(42.3%). Other cancer categories, such as malignant neo-
plasm of the brain (ICD code: 191; 13.8% to 11.9%), sar-
coma (ICD code: 200, 202-203; 9.08% to 7.61%), and
malignant neoplasm of the bone (ICD code: 170; 5.74% to
4%), had a higher percentage of TCM users (Table 3).
The number of clinical visits in Table 2 includes both
TCM and Western medicine clinical visits for TCM users. To
further understand the treatment modalities utilized in TCM
clinics, we determined the frequency distribution of various
TCM therapies by major disease category (Table 4). Taking
as an example musculoskeletal system and connective tissue
disorders, 27.79% of visits were for herbal remedies, 34.25%
were for manipulative therapy, 26.04% were for acupuncture,
4.47% were for manipulative therapy combined with herbal
remedies, 4.26% were for acupuncture combined with herbal
remedies, 2.69% were for manipulative therapy combined
with acupuncture, and 0.50% were for acupuncture, manipu-
lative therapy, and herbal remedies.
By comparing the prevalence ratio of disease between
TCM users and non­TCM users, we found 4 common dis-
eases for which children with cancer tended to seek adjunc-
tive TCM treatment. These diseases included allergic rhinitis,
dyspepsia, disorders of menstruation, and diseases of the
musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (Table 5).
Discussion
This study is the first large-scale population-based investi-
gation of adjunctive TCM use in children with cancer. TCM
was popular in this population, particularly among school-
aged children and adolescents. A total of 62.4% of children
150 Integrative Cancer Therapies 16(2)
with cancer had received complementary TCM treatment at
some point, and the population number was nearly 1.7 times
as large as that of non­TCM users. There was no difference
between urban and rural populations, probably because
TCM is highly accessible and its use is reimbursed by the
NHI program.5 The most common diseases for which chil-
dren with cancer visited the clinic, be they TCM users or
non­TCM users, included respiratory system disease and
neoplasm. TCM users visited the clinic less frequently for
respiratory system disease and digestive system disease.
Children with leukemia tended to seek the use of Western
medicine, whereas children with sarcoma or malignant neo-
plasm of the brain or bone sought adjunctive TCM treat-
ment. This result was consistent with a study conducted in
British Columbia that reported that patients with a poor
prognosis in childhood cancer were more willing to try
CAM therapies. The most common TCM therapy used was
Chinese herbal remedies. The pediatric cancer patients who
had comorbidities, including allergic rhinitis, dyspepsia,
disorders of menstruation, and disease of the musculoskel-
etal system and connective tissue, tended to visit the TCM
clinic rather than a non-TCM clinic. Overall, this study
offers pediatricians or oncologists epidemiological infor-
mation about how TCM is being applied in pediatric cancer
patients.
There were several strengths to this study. First, this is a
nationwide, population-based study that enrolled all chil-
dren with cancer from 2001 to 2011. The population size
was larger than that of other studies. Second, the NIH pro-
gram in Taiwan covers greater than 99% of the total popula-
tion, and it reimbursed both Western medicine and TCM
services. Therefore, none of the claims data in the NHIRD
had any selection bias. Third, pediatric cancer patients with
CICs were confirmed by pathology, image studies, a series
of laboratory surveys, and careful review by hematologists
and oncologists commissioned by the NHI Administration.

The diagnosis was decidedly accurate, and the database was
reliable for epidemiological study in children with cancer.
We found that the high prevalence (62.4%) of TCM use
by children with cancer in Taiwan was compatible with a
previous small-scale study reporting 73% of CAM use in
Taiwan.16 A previous study found that the prevalence of
CAM use in pediatric cancer was 35% in Germany,17 47%
in the United States,18 42% in British Columbia,19 and 67%
in Singapore.20 Most CAM therapies used in other countries
were diet and nutrition, herbal remedies, relaxation, and
mind-body therapies.2,10 In contrast to other countries, TCM
constituted a high proportion among CAM therapies in
Taiwan because TCM has been used for more than 2000
years and is widely acceptable in Asian countries. TCM
also became popular for cancer care in Europe. In a large
survey in Europe, acupuncture, herbal medicine, and TCM
were the main CAM therapies used to reduce adverse reac-
tions to chemoradiotherapy.21
The most common diseases for which TCM or non­
TCM users among pediatric cancer patients visited clinics
was respiratory system disease and neoplasm. Respiratory
system disease was also the most common reason for chil-
dren visiting outpatient clinics in Taiwan.5 This is likely
because upper- or lower-respiratory tract infection repre-
sent the most common acute illness in children, especially
in cancer patients with immune compromised status.
Moreover, several chemotherapeutic agents such as metho-
trexate, cyclophosphamide, and busulphan used in condi-
tioning regimens for bone marrow transplantation may also
affect pulmonary function.22-24 We found that TCM users
had lower visiting rates for respiratory system disease.
Whether complementary TCM therapy can improve lung
function deserves further investigations. Discomforts of the
digestive system are also among the top reasons for TCM
users to visit TCM clinics. Digestive disorders, including
diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, are the most common
symptoms in patients undergoing chemotherapy or radio-
therapy. Previous clinical trials have reported that Chinese
herbal medicines may be effective in treating these side
effects.25-27 The efficacy and safety in pediatric cancer
patients also need further investigations.
In our study, when compared with non­TCM users,
pediatric cancer patients with allergic rhinitis, dyspepsia,
disorders of menstruation, and musculoskeletal disease
tended to use TCM. This result was similar to our previous
study in the pediatric population in Taiwan.5 In contrast to a
previous study in an adult population with cancer in
Thailand, cancer patients with pain, dyspepsia, abdominal
or visceral pain, insomnia, and fatigue tended to use TCM.28
Allergic rhinitis had a high prevalence rate among children
in Taiwan,29 and some clinical trials had observed that
herbal medicines and acupuncture were effective in treating

allergies of children.30,31 Some herbal TCM preparations
have been shown to have benefit for functional dyspepsia.32-34
Chinese herbal remedies, such as modified Xiao-yao-san
and Modified Liu-Jun-Zi decoction might be effective in the
treatment of functional dyspepsia.35,36 With regard to TCM
treatment for disorders of menstruation, there is some evi-
dence supporting Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture
in treating primary dysmenorrheal.37,38 More than half of pri-
mary dysmenorrheal women in Taiwan sought TCM to treat
their menstruation-related pain syndrome.39 Teenage girls
with cancer might suffer from irregularities of menstruation
as a result of stress, especially during the treatment course.
TCM may provide help to regulate menstruation and reduce
the side effects of iatrogenic menopause.21 Our previous
study identified that musculoskeletal problems were one of
the common reasons for adolescents and school-aged chil-
dren to visit TCM clinics.5 Patients with cancer suffered
from pain caused by cancer or its treatment such as surgery,
chemotherapy, or radiotherapy. Many clinical trials have
suggested that TCM may be effective at treating cancer-
related pain, and the effects are similar to those of Western
analgesics.40 In contrast to other diseases, TCM doctors
prefer providing acupuncture and manipulative therapies to
treat musculoskeletal problems.
There are some limitations of our study. First, some
TCM services such as Chinese herbal decoctions and pro-
prietary Chinese medicine purchased directly from TCM
herbal pharmacies were not covered by NHI. This may have
resulted in an underestimation of the frequency of herb use.
Nevertheless, TCM services are fully reimbursed for cancer
patients holding a CIC. Hence, we can be certain that the
coverage of the TCM services in the study is high. The
underestimation would be relatively small and acceptable.
Second, all claims data were from RCIPD and collected by
ICD-9-CM code numbers of pediatric cancer. We were
unable to obtain information on the tumor stage to discrimi-
nate differences in TCM use in early and late stages.
However, this study still provides the general concept and
characteristics of TCM use among children with cancer.
Conclusion
In this large-scale, nationwide, population-based study, we
found that complementary TCM use among children with
