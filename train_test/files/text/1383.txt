Do Reimbursement Delays
Discourage Medicaid
Participation By Physicians?
Simply raising fees might not be enough to entice physicians to take
Medicaid patients, if they have to wait too long to receive payment for
services rendered.
by Peter J. Cunningham and Ann S. O'Malley
ABSTRACT: Policymakers have focused primarily on increasing Medicaid reimbursement
rates to increase physicians' participation in Medicaid, although physicians often complain
of payment delays and other administrative burdens associated with Medicaid. Linking
state-level data on average reimbursement times to the 2004­05 Community Tracking
Study Physician Survey, this study examines how Medicaid reimbursement time affects
physicians' willingness to accept Medicaid patients. Delays in reimbursement can offset
the effects of high Medicaid fees, thereby lowering participation to levels that are closer to
those in states with relatively low rates. Increasing these rates may be insufficient to in-
crease physicians' participation unless accompanied by reductions in administrative bur-
den. [Health Affairs 28, no. 1 (2009): w17­w28 (published online 18 November 2008;
10.1377/hlthaff.28.1.w17)]
Increasing physicians' participation in medicaid is a policy con-
cern of long standing. Surveys show that about half of physicians accept all
new Medicaid patients into their practices, compared with more than 70 per-
cent for privately insured or Medicare patients.1 Moreover, trends over the past de-
cade indicate that participation in Medicaid is declining for many physicians, in
part because of declining practice incomes and changes in practice arrangements.2
Low Medicaid reimbursement rates relative to those of Medicare and private
payers are usually considered to be the primary reason for low physician partici-
pation in Medicaid. Medicaid fee levels vary considerably across states, and re-
search has consistently shown that Medicaid participation by physicians is higher
in states with higher fees than in states with lower fees.3 Thus, increasing Medic-
aid fees is one of the main tools that state policymakers use to increase physicians'
participation in Medicaid, in order to improve access for enrollees.

However, although physicians often complain of the high administrative bur-
den associated with Medicaid patients, there has been less policy focus on reduc-
ing this burden as a way to increase participation. Administrative burden includes
payment delays, rejection of claims because either the billing form was completed
incorrectly or the physician was not able to verify the patient's Medicaid eligibil-
ity, preauthorization requirements for certain services, and complex rules and
regulations on how claims are to be filed.4 Indeed, although inadequate reimburse-
ment is the reason most frequently cited by physicians for limiting Medicaid pa-
tients (cited by 84 percent of physicians), the majority of physicians also cite con-
cerns about paperwork (70 percent) and billing delays (65 percent) as important
reasons.5 Another national survey found that concerns about administrative bur-
den caused physicians to limit their acceptance of new Medicaid patients to a
much greater extent than for Medicare or privately insured patients.6
Nevertheless, despite a sizable research literature on the effects of Medicaid fee
levels, there is virtually no research on how Medicaid administrative burden var-
ies across states, and how these variations influence physician participation. One
of the few relevant studies found extensive variation across states in pediatricians'
perceptions of paperwork burdens that were also correlated with their levels of
Medicaid participation.7 However, it was unknown whether these differences in
perceptions of administrative burden were consistent with actual experiences,
such as differences in length of time for payment and denial rates for claims.
This study links state-level data on Medicaid claims experiences with respect
to one important measure of administrative burden--length of time for reim-
bursement--with physician survey data that include measures of Medicaid par-
ticipation. The objective of the study is to examine the effect of variation in average
reimbursement times across states on physicians' decisions to accept Medicaid
patients. In addition, we compare the effects on physician participation in Medic-
aid of reimbursement times versus reimbursement rates. In particular, we deter-
mine whether slow reimbursement offsets any gains in participation that might be
achieved through increasing fee levels.
Study Data And Methods
n Data. The 2004­05 Community Tracking Study (CTS) Physician Survey is the
main source of data for this study.8 The survey is based on sixty randomly selected
communities, defined as Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas (PMSAs) or non-
metro parts of Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) Economic Areas. Sampled physi-
cians within each of the sixty communities include MDs and DOs who spent at least
twenty hours per week in patient care. All interviews were conducted by telephone,
with an overall response rate of 52 percent. The total sample includes about 6,600
physicians.
n Methods. The survey includes questions ascertaining the extent of each physi-
cian's involvement with Medicaid patients (based on percentage of total practice

revenue derived from Medicaid) as well as the extent to which they are accepting
all, most, some, or no new Medicaid patients (both fee-for-service and managed
care). Based on these questions, we included the following dependent variables: (1)
the probability of having any Medicaid patients (based on whether or not they de-
rived any Medicaid revenue); (2) the probability of accepting no new Medicaid pa-
tients; and (3) the probability of accepting all new Medicaid patients.
n Average reimbursement time in state. The primary independent variable of
interest is a state-level measure of average reimbursement time for physicians treat-
ing Medicaid patients. Average reimbursement time for Medicaid payment in the
state is computed based on claims records maintained by AthenaHealth Inc., which
contracts with physician practices in thirty-three states to provide claims process-
ing for Medicaid as well as commercial insurance. These data are unique in that they
are based on a uniform and standardized system of claims processing that largely ne-
gates differences in billing systems and billing practices between physicians that
may contribute to differences in reimbursement time.
To compute average reimbursement time for Medicaid payment in the state,
data on days in accounts receivable were aggregated across all Medicaid claims
within each state. Only fee-for-service payments were used to compute reim-
bursement times. Days in accounts receivable reflect time between when a claim
was submitted by AthenaHealth and when payment by Medicaid was made. If a
claim was initially denied by the state Medicaid agency and resubmitted--or de-
nied and resubmitted numerous times--it is considered a single claim for the pur-
poses of computing days in accounts receivable.
Days in accounts receivable were computed as the sum of total charge days (the
amount of the claim multiplied by the days in accounts receivable) for all claims
for a physician's practice, divided by the average dollar amount per day of all
claims for that physician's practice. This is a common method for computing days
in accounts receivable, which also has the added benefit of adjusting for differ-
ences in reimbursement time between physicians' practices as a result of differ-
ences in claim amounts (that is, larger claims may be more complex, are more
likely to be initially denied, and therefore may take longer to adjudicate than
smaller claims).
State-level measures of average reimbursement time for Medicaid for 2006 were
linked to sampled physicians in twenty-one of the thirty-six CTS states for which
there are a large number of claims processed by AthenaHealth.9 These include
most of the largest states such as New York, California, Texas, Florida, Illinois,
Pennsylvania, and Michigan, as well as regional representation in the Northeast,
South, Midwest, and West. Excluded states are those for which AthenaHealth
provides no Medicaid claims processing, or contracts with too few physicians to
produce reliable measures of reimbursement time. About 4,900 of the 6,600 physi-
cians in the survey are in the twenty-one states that have a measure of average re-
imbursement time; they represent the sample for this study.

Although data on reimbursement times for 2004 and 2005 would be more opti-
mal in terms of linkage to the CTS Physician Survey, data are not available for
many of the twenty-one states prior to 2006. Although average reimbursement
times within a state may change from year to year, the relative position of states
did not change between 2005 and 2006 among the fourteen states that had data
for both years.10 Because the rank-ordering of states is likely to be more accurate
for 2004 and 2005 than the actual time amount, most of the analysis was based on
a dichotomous measure that reflects practices in the 50 percent of states with
above-average reimbursement times and practices in the other 50 percent of states
with below-average reimbursement times.
n Medicaid reimbursement rates. Medicaid reimbursement rates are based on
a state survey of Medicaid fees conducted in 2003, the latest year for which these
data are available.11 The measure used in this study reflects a weighted average of the
ratio of Medicaid to Medicare fees for thirty-three services for each of the twenty-
one states.12 Medicaid fees relative to Medicare were used because Medicare rates
are adjusted for local practice costs; therefore, they serve as a benchmark for local
markets. Only fee-for-service rates were included in the measure. More recent data
for the years of the survey (2004­05) are not available. As with reimbursement
times, the relative position of states is consistent from year to year. Most of the anal-
ysis was based on a dichotomous measure that reflects location in the half of states
with the highest reimbursement rates and location in the other half of states with
the lowest reimbursement rates.
n Analysis. Because reimbursement times and Medicaid fees may be correlated
with other factors affecting physicians' decisions to accept Medicaid patients, logis-
tic regression analysis was used to examine the independent effects of reimburse-
ment times and fee levels on Medicaid participation.13 Physician characteristics con-
trolled for in the analysis include physicians' sex, race/ethnicity, years in practice,
specialty (medical, surgical, primary care), practice type and size (solo or small
group practice, medium and large group practice, HMO practice, hospital-based
practice, clinic, and other), practice income, percentage of revenue from capitation,
and owner versus employee of practice.
Important health care market variables controlled for in the analysis include the
percentage uninsured and the percentage of the population enrolled in Medicaid
in the community, using data from the 2003 CTS Household Survey.14 These mea-
sures control for both the relative size of the Medicaid population in the commu-
nity and the potential opportunity costs to physicians of treating Medicaid pa-
tients relative to other paying patients (that is, acceptance of Medicaid might be
higher if there are fewer higher-paying patients in the area relative to Medicaid pa-
tients). Because the survey did not distinguish between acceptance of Medicaid
managed care and fee-for-service patients, we controlled for state variation in
Medicaid managed care penetration rates, based on 2004 data from the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Other health care system variables

controlled for in the analysis include the relative number of physicians and hospi-
tal beds in the community.
The results are presented in terms of adjusted probabilities of accepting (or not
accepting) Medicaid patients, based on high or low levels of Medicaid reimburse-
ment times or fees, or both. To facilitate the presentation of results, dichotomous
measures of Medicaid reimbursement times and fees were used in the analysis (de-
scribed above).15 The analysis was conducted for all physicians in the sample, as
well as separately for primary care physicians and specialists.
Study Findings
n Variation in average Medicaid reimbursement times and rates. Average
reimbursement times for Medicaid varied considerably across states in 2006, from a
low of 36.9 adjusted days in Kansas to a high of 114.6 days in Pennsylvania (Exhibit
1). Reimbursement times for Medicaid were longer on average than reimbursement
times for commercial insurers in every state, although the size of the disparities
ranged from small (Kansas, Ohio) to large (Pennsylvania, Illinois). Also, there was

(about thirty-three days between the fastest and slowest states) compared to
Medicaid (seventy-eight days). Medicaid fees as a percentage of Medicare fees also
varied across states in 2003, from a low of 36 percent in New York to parity with

ences in physicians' involvement with Medicaid between all physicians in the CTS

cluded in the sample for this analysis. Similarly, there were no differences in other
characteristics of physicians between the overall CTS survey sample and the analy-
sis sample.
Compared with physicians in states with relatively slow reimbursement times,
physicians in the states with the fastest reimbursement times were more likely to
have some Medicaid revenue, more likely to be accepting all new Medicaid pa-
tients, and less likely to be accepting no or only some new Medicaid patients (Ex-
hibit 2). Other physician characteristics were largely similar between states with
high and low reimbursement times, except for managed care measures: physicians
in states with slow reimbursement were more likely than their peers in states
with fast reimbursement to be practicing in health maintenance organizations
(HMOs) and to obtain a higher percentage of practice revenue from capitation.
Exhibit 2 also indicates some correlation between average reimbursement
times and Medicaid reimbursement rates. In general, physicians in states with fast
reimbursement times also tended to have higher Medicaid fee levels than those in
states with slow reimbursement times.
n Effects of reimbursement time on Medicaid participation. Overall, average
reimbursement times had no independent effect on physician Medicaid participa-
tion when accounting for differences in Medicaid fees (Exhibit 3). When Medicaid
fees were excluded from the logistic regression models (model 1), faster payment
was associated with greater Medicaid participation, including a greater probability
of having any Medicaid patients, a greater probability of accepting all new Medicaid
patients, and a lower probability of accepting no new Medicaid patients. However,
most of the association between payment times and participation occurred among
specialists. When the analysis took fee levels into account (model 2), virtually all of
the differences in Medicaid participation levels between physicians in slow- versus
fast-payment states disappeared, including for specialists. Consistent with previous
studies, Medicaid participation levels were much higher among physicians in states
with relatively high fee levels than in those with low fee levels. These results are
consistent across all three measures of Medicaid participation as well as across
primary care physicians and specialists.
n Slow reimbursement offsets high Medicaid fees. Although differences in
reimbursement times have no independent effect on Medicaid participation, the ef-
fects of reimbursement time on Medicaid participation could depend on reimburse-
ment levels. For example, since states with high fee levels also tended to have faster
payment times, it might have been the combination of both high fees and relatively
rapid payment that induced more physicians to participate. Conversely, physicians
might have been less bothered by slow payment when fees were sufficiently high,
but they might have been even more reluctant to accept Medicaid patients when
low fees were combined with slow payment.
To examine this, we compared four groups of physicians based on different
combinations of fee levels and reimbursement times: physicians in states with (1)

dicators for these four groups were included in regression analyses that included

The results strongly suggest that slow payment offset much of the effect of high
Medicaid fees during the study period. For example, 64 percent of physicians
were accepting all new Medicaid patients in states with both high fees and fast
payment. However, when high fees were combined with slow payment, the per-
centage accepting all new Medicaid patients decreased to 50.9 percent. Reim-
bursement time appeared to make less of a difference in states with relatively low
Medicaid fees, because the differential in acceptance rates between fast- and
slow-payment states was only about five percentage points (48.4 in low-fee/fast-
payment states versus 43.2 percent in low-fee/slow-payment states). Similar re-
sults are shown for the other measures of Medicaid participation: participation
was highest among physicians in states with both the highest fees and fast reim-
bursement times, but significantly lower when high fees were combined with rel-
atively slow payment. These patterns are similar for primary care physicians and
specialists, although the combined effects of time and fees appeared to be stronger
for specialists, especially for measures related to acceptance of new patients.

SOURCES: Medicaid reimbursement times are based on data from AthenaHealth Inc. Medicaid fees are from a state survey of
Medicaid fees, from S. Zuckerman et al., "Changes in Medicaid Physician Fees, 1998­2003: Implications for Physician
Participation," Health Affairs 23 (2004): w374­w384 (published online 23 June 2004; 10.1377/hlthaff.w4.374). Medicaid
participation measures are based on the 2004­05 Community Tracking Study Physician Survey.
NOTES: High-fee/fast-payment states include AR, NC, VA, IN, MA, KS. High-fee/slow-payment states include GA, CT, LA, TX. Low-
fee/fast-payment states include SC, RI, FL, NJ, OH. Low-fee/slow-payment states include MO, CA, MI, IL, NY, PA. Estimates
reflect predicted probabilities based on multiple logistic regression analysis that included the following other variables:
physician's sex, specialty, years in practice, race/ethnicity, international medical graduate status, board certification, owner
versus employee of practice, practice type and size, practice income, percent of revenue from capitation, salaried, number of
nonfederal patient care physicians in county, percent of community residents enrolled in Medicaid, and Medicaid managed
care penetration in state. Statistical significance denotes difference with physicians in high-fee/fast-payment states.

The greater sensitivity to price among specialists is consistent with previous
research, and it likely reflects the generally higher opportunity costs between
what specialists can earn from non-Medicaid versus Medicaid patients.16 Oppor-
tunity costs are even greater for specialists than for primary care providers both
because of specialists' higher practice incomes and because the gap between
Medicaid and private payer rates is smaller for primary care providers than for
specialists.17 The combined effect of low fees and slow payment likely increases
these opportunity costs even more for specialists.
Discussion And Policy Implications
The results from this study indicate that slower Medicaid reimbursement times
were associated with lower physician participation in Medicaid, although the ef-
fect of reimbursement times depended on fee levels. Although Medicaid payment
rates were consistently the most important indicator of Medicaid acceptance, the
effects of payment rates on participation were diminished when high fees were
accompanied by relatively slow payment.
n Study limitations. Some limitations with this analysis should be noted. First,
the measure of physicians' participation in Medicaid did not distinguish between
managed care and fee-for-service patients, so the results pertaining to fee levels and
reimbursement time (which includes fee-for-service only) might reflect in part cor-
relation with Medicaid managed care that was not accounted for in the analysis. The
ability to distinguish between acceptance of Medicaid fee-for-service and managed
care patients in the analysis would have been useful, but it was not possible with the
survey data. To address this issue, we controlled for physician practice in an HMO,
the amount of capitation received from managed care (commercial and public), as
well as Medicaid managed care enrollment rates in the state.
Also, the results for the combined effect of Medicaid fees and payment times
were based on a relatively small number of states (four to six) in each of the four
groups. Thus, the results for a particular group (for example, states with high
fees/fast payment) might reflect other unique aspects of these states or of one or
two large states within each group.
Although this was beyond the scope of this analysis, we were not able to iden-
tify literature explaining the reasons for state variation in Medicaid reimburse-
ment times, or why payment times in Medicaid continue to lag behind those of
commercial payers. Starting in October 2003, state Medicaid agencies were re-
quired, as part of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA), to accept electronic claims for Medicaid using standardized formats,
which was intended to speed claims processing and reduce errors.

In theory, greater use of electronic claims processing using standardized for-
mats should increase the speed of payment and perhaps reduce the amount of vari-
ation in reimbursement time between states; however, other factors could still
lead to delays. Complex rules and guidelines in Medicaid regarding documenta-
tion for claims, the use of detailed service and procedure codes, and patient eligi-
bility determination mean that many claims are still likely to be initially denied.
Also, preventing fraud and waste in Medicaid is still a major concern that may
contribute to longer payment times. For example, the CMS has developed a new
measuring system--the Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) program--to
measure improper Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Program
(SCHIP) payments in a subset of states each year, beginning in 2007. Such efforts
to reduce errors and fraud in Medicaid payments may slow payment to providers
by increasing the number of claims that are initially denied, which could offset any
gains from increased use of electronic claims processing. In addition, some states
may purposefully defer payments on some Medicaid claims to the next budgetary
cycle or fiscal year because of state budget cuts or shortfalls, especially during
economic downturns.
n Policy implications. Improving access to physicians for Medicaid enrollees is
a concern among state policymakers, and increasing fee levels for physicians is often
the preferred method for achieving increased access. Although low fees are one of
the primary reasons discouraging physicians from participating in Medicaid, other
factors--including payment times and administrative burden--are also important.
In fact, the results of this study strongly suggest that higher fees will not have the de-
sired effect on access if it takes physicians several months or longer to be reim-
bursed. In some states, reducing payment delays and administrative burdens may
have more of an impact on access than modest increases in fee levels. In sum, there is
no one-size-fits-all solution to increasing Medicaid patients' access to physicians.
Each state will need to assess whether to target limited resources at fee increases,
improve claims processing systems, or reduce other administrative burdens that
result in barriers to physicians' participation in Medicaid.

9. States included in the analysis generally had at least 20,000 Medicaid claims processed by AthenaHealth
Inc., for which estimates of average reimbursement time are based. Estimates for smaller states are based
on fewer claims (for example, about 6,000 in Arkansas), while estimates for larger states, such as Ohio,
California, and Illinois, are based on more than 100,000 claims in each of these states. States excluded be-
cause of too few claims in which to compute average reimbursement time generally had several hundred
claims or fewer processed by AthenaHealth.
10. Because our analysis was based on a binary measure of being in a "fast" versus "slow" reimbursement state,
the relative position of states is more important than the actual value of reimbursement time.

pation," Health Affairs 23 (2004): w374­w384 (published online 23 June 2004; 10.1377/hlthaff.w4.374).
12. Weights were constructed to reflect the relative importance of each service in each state. Service-specific
weights were defined as the share of Medicaid physician spending for that service in each state, based on
service-specific spending data from the CMS.
13. A problem that arises when state-level variables are merged to person-level data and included as inde-
pendent variables in regression analysis is that the disturbances are correlated, which may cause the stan-
dard errors to be biased downward. See B.R. Moulton, "An Illustration of a Pitfall in Estimating the Effects
of Aggregate Variables on Micro Units," ReviewofEconomicsandStatistics 72, no. 2 (1990): 334­338. However,
most of the important results in this analysis associated with state-level fee and payment time variables
have a high level of statistical significance (0.01), so we do not expect the results or conclusions to be
seriously affected.

port 2003 (Round 4)," Technical Pub. no. 62, 2005, http://www.hschange.org/CONTENT/757/757.pdf (ac-
cessed 29 September 2007).
15. The regression analysis was also run using linear versions of the state-level fee and payment time variables
(that is, not collapsed into two groups). The results are consistent with the results using binary versions of
these variables. However, we focus on the binary versions of these variables because it facilitates the com-
putation of regression probabilities (that is, reflects the average for "low" and "high" states). Also, given the
relatively small number of state observations (twenty-one states), binary measures reduce the risk that
certain "outlier" states would drive the results.
