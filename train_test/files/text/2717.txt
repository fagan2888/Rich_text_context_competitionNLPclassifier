Insufficient and disrupted sleep is linked with cardiovascular and
metabolic dysregulation and morbidity. The current study exam-
ines the degree to which differences in sleep between black/
African American (AA) and white/European American (EA) adults
explain racial differences in cardiometabolic (CMB) disease risk.
Total sleep time and sleep efficiency (percent of time in bed
asleep) were assessed via seven nights of wrist actigraphy among
426 participants in the Midlife in the United States Study (31% AA;
69% EA; 61% female; mean age = 56.8 y). CMB risk was indexed as
a composite of seven biomarkers [blood pressure, waist circumfer-
ence, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c
), insulin resistance, triglycerides,
HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), and C-reactive protein]. Covariates in-
cluded sociodemographic characteristics and relevant health behav-
iors. Results indicated that AAs relative to EAs obtained less sleep
(341 vs. 381 min) and had lower sleep efficiency (72.3 vs. 82.2%)
(P values < 0.001). Further, 41% and 58% of the racial difference in
CMB risk was explained by sleep time and sleep efficiency, respec-
tively. In models stratified by sex, race was indirectly associated
with CMB risk via sleep time and efficiency only among females
(explaining 33% and 65% of the race difference, respectively). In-
direct effects were robust to alternative model specifications that
excluded participants with diabetes or heart disease. Consideration
of sleep determinants and sleep health is therefore needed in
efforts to reduce racial differences in CMB disease.
health disparities | race | sleep | cardiometabolic disease | health behaviors
Black/African American adults (AAs) have disproportionately
high rates of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases com-
pared with white/European American (EAs), including elevated
hypertension, diabetes, and stroke prevalence (1, 2). The re-
duction of these racial health disparities has become a pillar of the
United States' national health strategy (3, 4). However, given the
complexity of risk exposures at multiple levels and numerous
potential mechanisms (5, 6), the underlying reasons for AA­EA
health differences are not well understood. For example, differ-
ences in health behaviors related to cardiometabolic (CMB) dis-
ease risk--namely, diet, physical activity, and smoking--have been
considered as behavioral pathways through which AAs experience
greater health risk, but adjusting for these behaviors leaves a
substantial racial gap in CMB conditions unexplained (6­8).
Three recent review papers have proposed that differences in
sleep patterns are one further behavioral mediator of the un-
equal cardiovascular disease and diabetes burden between AA
and EA adults (9­11). Race differences are apparent across
several sleep parameters even after adjusting for socioeconomic
characteristics, so that AAs are more likely to sleep for an in-
sufficient duration and to experience fragmented sleep relative
to EAs (12, 13). In turn, sleep problems are risk factors for
coronary heart disease, stroke, hypertension, and diabetes and
predispose to more abdominal adiposity and low-grade systemic
inflammation (14­19). Despite the expanding literature, few
studies have examined sleep as a mediator of AA­EA differ-
ences in CMB diseases. Specifically, to our knowledge, sleep has
been considered as a mediator of racial differences only in blood
pressure (16, 20, 21), and therefore additional research is needed
to examine CMB dysregulation more widely.
Therefore the primary aim of the current study was to test the
degree to which differences in habitual sleep explain racial dif-
ferences in CMB disease risk. Data were derived from 426 AA
and EA adults from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS)
study who participated in a sleep substudy. Total sleep time and
sleep efficiency (i.e., the percentage of the time in bed spent
sleeping) were measured over seven nights using actigraphy--a
watch-like activity monitor that has good correspondence with
polysomnography (22). CMB risk was measured as a composite of
ideal, borderline high, and high (coded as 0, 1, and 2, respectively)
levels of waist circumference, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c
), insulin
resistance [homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance
(HOMA-IR)], blood pressure, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol (HDL-
C), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (Table 1) (23­25). CMB risk scores
were averaged across the biomarkers so that total scores ranged
from 0 to 2. Additional models were fit to examine whether as-
sociations between sleep and CMB risk varied by demographic
factors (race, sex, and age) and, given that AA­EA differences in
obesity and diabetes are larger for females than for males (26, 27),
whether mediation of racial differences in CMB risk varied by sex.
To reduce the likelihood of reverse causality, we also tested study
hypotheses among participants without heart disease or diabetes.
Results
Sample descriptive statistics are listed by race in Table 2. Race
differences were identified in several of the sociodemographics,
health behaviors, and CMB markers. Notably, AAs obtained nearly
40 fewer minutes of sleep and had 10% lower sleep efficiency than
Significance
Large differences in cardiovascular disease and diabetes
prevalence exist between African American and European
American adults. The US federal government has committed
to reducing racial disparities in health; however, the precise
mechanisms are not well understood. Sleep is one potential
behavioral explanation for current racial differences in car-
diometabolic conditions. We show that more than one-half
of racial differences in cardiometabolic risk can be explained
by sleep patterns--namely, less total sleep and lower sleep
efficiency among African American than European American
adults. Sleep is a malleable health behavior that is linked with
characteristics of the social and physical environment and could
be an effective target in national efforts to reduce racial
health disparities.

EAs. Further, AAs relative to EAs had significantly larger
waist circumference, higher diastolic blood pressure, HbA1c
,
HOMA-IR, and CRP levels but had a more favorable lipid
profile (lower triglycerides and higher HDL-C). In total, AAs had
a higher unadjusted CMB risk than EAs including higher risk
scores for four of the individual CMB risk scores.
Racial Differences in Sleep and CMB Risk. After adjusting for soci-
odemographic characteristics, AAs obtained less sleep per night
[regression coefficient (B) = -0.72 h, SE = 0.13, P < 0.001] and
had lower sleep efficiency (B = -10.14 percentage points, SE =
1.12, P < 0.001) relative to EAs. Race differences were equiva-
lent to an effect size of 0.63 and 0.95 SD units, respectively.
See Table 3 for parameter estimates for Models 1­4. In Model
1, AAs had elevated CMB risk relative to EAs (B = 0.15, 95% CI:
0.05, 0.26) after adjusting for sociodemographics, a difference
equivalent to 0.32 SD units. When CMB risk was further adjusted
for diet, exercise, cigarette smoker status, and depressive symp-
toms (Model 2), the racial gap in CMB risk was attenuated by
27% but remained significant (B = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.22).
Sleep Indicators Explain Differences in CMB Risk. Total sleep time
and sleep efficiency were added separately as predictors of CMB
risk in Models 3 and 4, respectively. We found that shorter sleep
time was significantly associated with greater CMB risk (B =
-0.07, 95% CI: -0.10, -0.03). Furthermore, a significant indirect
effect of race on CMB risk via sleep time was detected (B = 0.05,
95% CI: 0.02, 0.08), explaining 41% of the estimated racial gap,
which was no longer significant. Nonlinear associations between
sleep time and CMB risk were also tested using sleep time
squared, but results indicated no significant association (P = 0.60).
In Model 4, lower sleep efficiency was associated with greater
CMB risk (B = -0.007, 95% CI: -0.012, -0.002). Notably, racial
differences in CMB risk were found to operate partly through
sleep efficiency (indirect effect: B = 0.07, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.13), so
that the racial gap in CMB risk was reduced by 58% and was
nonsignificant. When sleep variables were simultaneously tested
as mediators, the race estimate in CMB risk was similar to Model
4 (B = 0.04, 95% CI: -0.07, 0.15; attenuated by 64% from Model
2), but neither of the indirect effects (sleep time: B = 0.03, 95%
CI: -0.01, 0.07; sleep efficiency: B = 0.04, 95% CI: -0.02, 0.11)
was significant, likely because of multicollinearity.
We also examined race, age, and sex as moderators of the link
between sleep and CMB risk (see Table S1 for full results). No
evidence of moderation by racial group or age was found for either
of the sleep indicators. In contrast, sex moderated associations
between both sleep indicators and CMB risk (sleep time: P = 0.005;
efficiency: P = <0.001), indicating that the link between sleep and
CMB risk was stronger for females than for males.
Sex-Stratified Models. Models 1­4 were also fit in sex-stratified
subsamples. Because the sample of AA males was small, analyses
in the male subsample were exploratory and are described in
Supporting Information. AA females obtained 0.75 h less sleep
and had 9.1% lower sleep efficiency than EA females (Ps <
0.001). Differences in CMB risk were also substantial, so that,
after adjusting for demographics, AA females had 0.52 SD units
higher risk than EAs (B = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.38).
As depicted in Models 2­4 of Table S2, health behaviors, sleep
time, and sleep efficiency were tested as explanations for differential
CMB risk between AA and EA females. Adjusting for sleep time
explained 33% of the racial gap in CMB risk, and the test of me-
diation was significant (indirect effect: B = 0.07, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.12).
Sleep efficiency was also associated with CMB risk and explained
65% of the race difference in females (indirect effect: B = 0.14,
95% CI: 0.07, 0.22). When sleep time and sleep efficiency were
considered simultaneously, the indirect effect via sleep efficiency
was significant (B = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.22), but the indirect effect
via sleep time was not, and the sleep indicators together explained
73% of the race estimate (B = 0.07, 95% CI: -0.07, 0.20).
Supplemental Analyses. To decrease the possibility of reverse causality
(i.e., CMB disease disrupting sleep), we tested mediation hy-
potheses after excluding participants with heart disease or di-
abetes (manifest by HbA1c
6.5%). In this restricted sample (n =
303), race was still indirectly related to CMB risk via sleep time
(B = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.11). The indirect effect estimate of
race on CMB risk via sleep efficiency was similar in magnitude
but was not significant (B = 0.05, 95% CI: -0.02, 0.12). In the
female subsample without heart disease or diabetes (n = 190),
significant indirect effects of race on CMB risk via sleep time
(B = 0.09, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.18) and sleep efficiency (B = 0.12, 95%
CI: 0.03, 0.24) were also detected. In addition, to separate poor

sleep patterns resulting from sleep disorders, models were also fit
excluding participants with chronic sleep problems; the results are
described in Supporting Information.
Models 2­4 were also fit treating the individual CMB markers
as continuously coded outcomes using multivariate regression.
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were modeled separately,
constituting two of the eight outcomes. Antihypertensives were
included as a predictor of systolic and diastolic blood pressure,
and lipid-lowering medications were included as a predictor of
triglycerides and HDL-C levels. Results are shown in Table S3.
In summary, relative to EAs, AAs had larger waist circumfer-
ence, greater HbA1c
, HOMA-IR, and CRP (and higher HDL-C
and lower triglycerides, which are not discussed further). The race
estimate for each of respective biomarkers was attenuated by 24,
14, 23, and 13%, respectively, when adjusting for sleep time, and
by 26, 24, 23, and 19%, respectively, when adjusting for sleep ef-
ficiency. Sex-stratified models also showed that racial health dif-
ferences and the explanatory role of sleep were driven by the
female subsample (see Table S4). In particular, relative to EA
women, AA women had larger waist circumference and greater
systolic and diastolic blood pressure, HbA1c
, HOMA-IR, and
CRP. These differences were attenuated by 20, 13, 13, 8, 19, and
16%, respectively, when adjusting for sleep time and by 27, 22, 19,
19, 30, and 22%, respectively, when adjusting for sleep efficiency.
Discussion
Reducing racial/ethnic health disparities is highlighted as one of
the four overarching goals in Healthy People 2020 (3). Given that
40% of the gap in premature mortality between AAs and EAs
(and more than 50% of the gap between AA and EA females)
stems from cardiovascular and metabolic conditions, improving
the CMB health of AAs is an important step toward greater
health equity (28). Sleep represents one potential intervention
point (9, 10), but the relative influence of sleep on racial dif-
ferences in CMB conditions is largely unknown. In a sample of
middle-aged and older adults, we find support for the notion that
differences in habitual sleep contribute to the unequal burden of
CMB disease risk. In particular, after adjusting for sociodemo-
graphics and health behaviors, sleep time and sleep efficiency
accounted for 41% and 58% of the AA­EA gap in CMB risk
scores, respectively. Path analysis allowed for the simultaneous
consideration of the sleep mediator and CMB outcome--each of
which was adjusted for sociodemographics--and a formal test of
mediation.
These findings are consistent with previous investigations of
sleep as a mediator of race differences in blood pressure (16, 21,
29). Specifically, using data from the Coronary Artery Risk
Development in Young Adults Study, actigraph-assessed sleep
time mediated AA­EA differences in diastolic blood pressure
change over a 5-y period (16). In a population-based cohort in
Chicago, actigraph-assessed sleep maintenance, but not sleep
duration, was associated with hypertension and explained 11%
of the AA­EA difference in prevalence (29). Another study of
middle-aged adults in the Southeast reported that lower sleep
quality explained, in part, differences between AAs and EAs in
nocturnal blood pressure dipping (21). In contrast, a study using
data from the male subsample of the Boston Area Community
Health Survey did not find evidence of short sleep duration
(5 h) to be a mediator of racial disparities in 5-y self-reported
hypertension incidence (20), but analyses were tested only for
males and were limited by a dichotomous self-report sleep-
duration variable. Thus, extant evidence suggests that sleep
problems contribute to racial differences in hypertension; this
study adds evidence regarding their influence on racial differ-
ences in the risk for CMB disease more broadly.
When examining findings by biological sex, sleep indicators
were associated with CMB risk among females but not males
(see Table S5 for results among male sample), and sleep also
explained a substantial portion of the race differences in CMB
risk among females. The sex moderation of the sleep­health
association is consistent with prior research documenting in-
sufficient sleep as a risk factor for larger waist circumference,
hypertension, and elevated inflammatory markers among fe-
males but not among males (30­32). However, given the small
sample of AA males, the current dataset was able to offer only
preliminary support for sex differences in the extent to which
sleep explained racial differences in CMB risk. Additional re-
search is needed to determine whether differences in sleep lead
to elevated CMB morbidity among AA males relative to EA
males, and, if so, to elucidate the mechanisms underlying sex
differences in associations between sleep and physical health.
Examining individual biomarkers, we also found broad sup-
port for the role of sleep as an explanation of CMB risk. Spe-
cifically, relative to EAs, AA females had greater dysregulation
in each of the six expected CMB markers, and these differences
were attenuated by 8­29% when adjusting for sleep time and by
19­30% when adjusting for sleep efficiency. These findings are
consistent with one study that tested associations between sleep
and allostatic load (indexed by seven physiologic systems). When

individual systems were examined in this study, inadequate sleep
duration was particularly related to cardiovascular, inflamma-
tory, and glucose metabolic systems, all of which constitute our
CMB risk index, suggesting that sleep may be especially impor-
tant for CMB health (33).
In addition to differences in sleep being an issue of public
health, the presence of these sleep differences appears to be, in
part, a result of social factors. Specifically, sleep has been ro-
bustly associated with exposure to social stress (34). Moreover,
household and area-level socioeconomic conditions and experi-
ences of discrimination help explain a portion of racial sleep
differences (35, 36). Insufficient sleep therefore represents a
plausible biobehavioral pathway through which disproportionate
exposure to social and economic adversity leads to diverging
health trajectories between AAs and EAs. Future studies will
need to integrate research on stress exposure and sleep as they
relate to a broad variety of racial and socioeconomic inequities in
health and well-being. Furthermore, initiatives to reduce racial
health disparities will need to consider the costs and benefits of
varying points of intervention (e.g., upstream social determi-
nants vs. sleep). Evidence-based sleep interventions could target
AA communities and, if successful, could serve to reduce dis-
parities in physical health, socioeconomic factors, and well-being
(37, 38).
The use of sleep actigraphy is one strength of the present
study. One recent review found that AA­EA differences in sleep
time were larger when assessed objectively relative to self-reports
(13), so that objective assessments may be key in research on
racial sleep differences. Racial differences in the bias of sleep
self-reports has also been documented, leading to an un-
derestimation of differences (39). Further, findings considering
racial differences in the association between sleep and CMB
outcomes vary by the sleep assessment methodology. Namely,
some research has shown that self-reported short duration is
associated with blood pressure and diabetes to a larger degree
among AAs than among EAs (19, 40), whereas one study and the
present research found no racial differences in the link between
actigraph-assessed sleep duration and cardiovascular markers
(16). Polysomnography is also vital because it measures sleep
architecture and has an advantage over actigraphy in detecting
wakefulness (41). However, actigraphy is a more feasible means
of measuring multiple nights of sleep and has significant cost
advantages that are important in epidemiologic studies.
An additional strength of this study relates to our conceptu-
alization of CMB risk and the utilization of several key bio-
markers that predict subsequent cardiovascular and metabolic
disease. One advantage of multisystem indexes of dysregulation
is that the biological pathways from risk factors to disease may
vary across individuals (42). Although other multisystem indexes
have included a broader range of biomarkers relevant to aging,
our focus was on the biomarkers of CMB risk because of their
relevance to racial disparities in premature mortality and the
established associations between sleep and many of the individ-
ual biomarkers. Further description of the strengths of our CMB
risk index is found in Supporting Information.
Several study limitations are also important to note. Analyses
used cross-sectional data, and therefore no conclusions could be
drawn about temporal ordering. In particular, low sleep efficiency
and insufficient sleep may result from health conditions, particu-
larly among older adults (43). However, when participants with
heart disease or diabetes were excluded, racial differences in CMB
risk continued to be explained by sleep time and sleep efficiency.
Moving forward, longitudinal data will be critical to demonstrate
the long-term effects of habitual sleep problems.
The possibility of residual confounding, resulting from im-
precise controls and lack of consideration of all third-variable
explanations, also needs to be acknowledged. Specifically, although
we adjusted for coarse indicators of diet and physical activity, de-
tailed measures are needed to remove their influence on sleep fully.
Similarly, in addition to controlling for education and income,
subsequent research must elucidate the interdependence of a broad
variety of socioeconomic factors and sleep as they relate to racial
differences in health. Two additional analyses also were conducted
to reduce the possibility of age and sleep disorders as confounding
variables; these analyses are described in Supporting Information
and are discussed here only briefly. First, given that normative
changes in sleep and CMB functioning occur with aging, we tested
and found no evidence of age as a moderator of the link between
sleep and CMB risk. Second, we excluded participants with chronic
sleep problems and found an identical pattern of results.
Generalizability is limited because the EA subsample was
primarily from the Midwest and the AA subsample was from
Milwaukee. Milwaukee suffers from hypersegregation (extreme
segregation across several indicators) and adverse economic
conditions (44), so that racial differences in heath could be larger
than would be found in other contexts. Nonetheless, the majority
of AAs in the Midwest reside in industrial cities that are segre-
gated and have been adversely affected by changes in the
economy resulting in the loss of manufacturing jobs (45). Thus,
the sample offers an important context to consider sleep as a
behavioral pathway through which an historically disadvantaged
racial group may develop elevated CMB disease risk.
Conclusions
The results from the present study highlight the importance of
eliminating racial differences in sleep as part of efforts to reduce
racial health disparities. Importantly, sleep is a malleable be-
havior that can be improved through behavioral and educational
interventions to influence physical health (38). Further, despite
limited information regarding nonclinical samples, sleep in-
terventions have been shown to be cost-effective (37, 46).
Thus, recent public health initiatives that include monitoring
sleep behaviors and society-wide messaging about adequate
sleep duration and sleep hygiene represent important progress
(47, 48).
Methods
Participants. Data for the analyses were derived from a sleep substudy that
was part of the second wave of the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS II)
Study (49). MIDUS began in 1995 as a nationally representative survey of
more than 7,000 noninstitutionalized adults. Approximately 75% of surviv-
ing respondents of the first wave participated in MIDUS II, 9­10 y later. As
part of this new data collection, a subsample of respondents participated in
clinic-based (overnight) biomarker data collection at one of three sites (Los
Angeles; Madison, WI; and Washington, DC). Details of the biomarker
sample and measures are provided elsewhere (49). Data are publicly avail-
able at https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/29282. To increase
the participation of AAs in biomarker data collection, a new oversample from
Milwaukee (n = 592) was also recruited. MIDUS staff made travel arrange-
ments and covered travel-related costs to ensure maximum participation in
this portion of the study.
We included only participants from the Madison, WI site, which drew
primarily on respondents from the Midwest region and Milwaukee, because
they were invited to participate in a home-based week-long sleep substudy. A
total of 441 adults (83% of the Madison biomarker sample) participated.
Because of our focus on AA and EA adults, 15 individuals categorized as
other racial/ethnic groups were excluded. Data collection was approved
by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Institutional Review Board, and all
participants provided written, informed consent.
Measures.
CMB risk. Cardiovascular and diabetes risk can be quantified from markers of
abdominal adiposity, dyslipidemia, glucose metabolism, blood pressure, and
systemic inflammation (50­52). These risk markers also cluster together to
indicate a general state of CMB dysregulation. For the present study, CMB
disease risk was indexed using clinical or recommended risk cut points for
seven biomarkers: waist circumference, HOMA-IR, HbA1c
, blood pressure,
CRP, triglycerides, and low HDL levels. This measure of CMB risk includes
indicators of metabolic syndrome and two additional biomarkers (HOMA-IR
and CRP) that add incremental validity in the prediction of cardiovascular
disease (50, 53). Ideal (coded 0), borderline high (coded 1), and high (coded
2) levels for each marker were selected primarily based on recommendations
from the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III
(NCEP ATP III) and the American Heart Association (AHA) (23­25). Scores

(0­2) for each of the seven biomarkers were averaged to create an overall
index of CMB risk. Detailed descriptions of blood collection and processing
procedures and information about biomarker assays and other assessments
have been reported previously (54) and are reviewed briefly below. A
further description of the advantages of our CMB risk index is given in
Supporting Information.
Waist circumference. Waist circumference at the minimal girth was mea-
sured by trained nurses according to a standardized protocol (32). Waist
circumference risk categories were chosen according to AHA guidelines (25).
Blood pressure. Blood pressure was measured in triplicate according to
standardized procedures, and the second and third measurements were
averaged (54). Prehypertension and hypertension were coded if either sys-
tolic or diastolic blood pressure levels met Joint National Committee on
Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure
(JNC-VII) criteria (23). The use of antihypertensives was also coded as hy-
pertension (i.e., given a value of 2).
Glucose metabolism. Fasting blood samples were collected in the morning
of the second day of the laboratory visit. Glucose was assessed using an
enzymatic assay, performed on an automated analyzer (Roche Modular
Analytics P), and insulin was measured using a two-site sandwich immu-
noassay using direct chemiluminescent technology on a Siemens ADVIA
Centaur analyzer (54). Insulin resistance was computed using the original
homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA1-IR) equation:
HOMA1-IR = fasting glucose (mmol/L) × fasting insulin (mU/L)/22.5 (55).
The HOMA1-IR is an acceptable method for considering between-group
differences and relative change in insulin resistance but not absolute levels
of insulin resistance, because the original HOMA model was calibrated on
assays that were no longer in use at the time of the study (56). Recom-
mendations for clinical cut points for HOMA-IR are also varied (57), and
therefore insulin resistance tertiles were used to indicate risk levels. Pre-
diabetes/diabetes was indexed using HbA1c
, a measure of blood glucose over
the past few months, according to recommended cutoffs (58). HbA1c
was mea-
sured from whole-blood samples using a Cobas Integra analyzer (Roche
Diagnostics) (54).
Triglycerides and HDL-C. Concentrations of triglycerides and HDL-C were
measured using a Cobas Integra analyzer (Roche Diagnostics) (54). The use of
lipid-modifying medications was coded as high levels of triglycerides (high-
risk category).
CRP. CRP levels were measured using a high-sensitivity assay performed on
a BN II nephelometer (Dade Behring) (54). Borderline and high CRP levels
were coded according to previous recommendations (59).
Sleep minutes and sleep efficiency. Sleep characteristics were measured using
wrist actigraphy and sleep logs. Detailed procedures relating to the collection
and processing of actigraphy data are available at www.midus.wisc.edu/midus2/
project4/ and are summarized herein. At the biomarker visit participants re-
ceived a Mini-Mitter Actiwatch-64 activity monitor (Respironics, Inc.) that
was to be worn continuously for 7 d and nights. Physical activity counts were
collected in 30-s epochs during the week-long period, and periods of
intended sleep were then demarcated in the actigraphy data using bedtimes
and rise times reported on sleep logs. Epochs were scored as wake or sleep
using Actiware Software (version 5.0) (Respironics, Inc.) based on a medium
threshold of 40 activity counts (32).
Total sleep time was measured as the number of minutes coded as asleep
between sleep onset and rise time, and sleep efficiency was measured as the
percentage of epochs coded as asleep from bedtime to rise time. All par-
ticipants had at least three nights of actigraphy data, with nearly all (96%)
having at least six nights. In the present analyses, daily sleep parameters were
averaged across all nights of available data to compute sleep-related out-
comes; total sleep time and sleep efficiency showed high internal consistency
( = 0.85 and  = 0.91, respectively). Sleep time and sleep efficiency were
strongly correlated (r = 0.62) and therefore were initially considered sepa-
rately in mediation analyses. Actigraph-assessed sleep time and sleep effi-
ciency show good correspondence with polysomnography in community
samples and with the device used in the present study (22, 60).
Sociodemographic covariates. Biological sex, age (in years), and relationship
status (married or cohabiting = 1, otherwise = 0) were included as de-
mographic covariates. Total household income was measured using several
items assessing wages, pension, social security, and government assistance
for all household members. The participant's educational attainment was
coded into dummy variables representing high school degree or less (ref-
erence category), some college attendance, and a 4-y college degree or
greater. All models were adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics.
Mental health and health behaviors. Depressive symptoms were assessed
using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, a widely used
and well-validated measure (61). One item measuring restless sleep was
removed from the computation of the total score to reduce conflation be-
tween sleep and depression, and the revised scale had high reliability ( =
0.89). Habits relating to physical activity, diet, and cigarette smoking were
also assessed (36, 62). Physical activity was reported on nightly sleep logs by
the answer to the question "How many minutes of moderate or vigorous
exercise did you get today?" The average of all available reports across the
7 d was used. Despite this single item being a coarse indicator of physical
activity, the short recall and repeated measurements are considerable
strengths that improve the validity of the item (63). Fast-food consumption
was selected as an index of a putative unhealthy dietary habit (64) and was
coded in three dummy variables: no consumption (referent), less than once
per week, and once a week or more. The frequency of fast-food consump-
tion is positively associated with high-fat, high-sugar diets and is inversely
associated with the intake of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and fiber
(64). Single-item reports of the frequency of fast-food consumption also
correspond closely with typical fast-food items measured using detailed
month-long diet histories (64). Smoker status was coded as a dummy vari-
able representing current smoking activity.
Previous heart disease. Participants reported if a doctor had previously
suspected or confirmed a "heart trouble" and recalled the diagnosis, broadly
categorized as myocardial infarction, angina, valve disease, hole in heart,
blocked artery, arrhythmia, heart murmur, or heart failure.
Analysis Plan. Descriptive statistics were examined by race, and unadjusted
differences between AAs and EAs were tested using independent-samples
t tests and 2 tests. Linear regression and path models were used to test
study hypotheses. An initial regression model estimated racial differences in
total sleep time and sleep efficiency, adjusting for sex, age, relationship
status, education, and household income. A series of regression models
then was estimated to examine racial differences in CMB risk and the role of
sleep indicators as mediating variables. In Model 1, differences in CMB dis-
ease risk between AAs and EAs were estimated after adjusting for socio-
demographics. Model 2 then added health behaviors and mental health--
specifically, diet, physical activity, cigarette smoking, and depression--as
additional covariates. Two additional models were fit in which total sleep
time (Model 3) and sleep efficiency (Model 4) were added, in turn, as pre-
dictors of CMB risk. Mediation was tested in path models in which each sleep
indicator was simultaneously modeled as a mediator predicted by race (and
sociodemographics) and as a predictor of CMB risk. The indirect effect of
race on CMB risk via each sleep indicator was estimated using the product of
coefficients method with bias-corrected confidence intervals (65), and the
proportion of the race difference in CMB risk explained was calculated to
indicate the effect size. Modeling indirect effects using path models is a
widely used test of mediation that allows simultaneous controls on both the
mediator and outcome variable. Further, indirect effects are easily inter-
preted--the estimate is in the units of the direct effect (in our case, the
indirect effect indicates the absolute value of the racial gap in CMB risk
explained by the sleep mediator). Study hypotheses were tested using Mplus
7.11 (66). Missing data were handled using full information maximum like-
lihood, a common estimation technique that uses all available data and al-
lows a consistent sample size across models. Only 2.6% of participants had
missing data for physical activity, and all other covariates had less than 1%
missing data.
A few sensitivity analyses were also conducted. Given that some studies
have shown associations between short sleep duration and CMB risk to vary
by demographic factors (19, 40), race, age, and sex were tested as moder-
ators of the link between sleep and CMB risk. The series of models described
above was also fit among samples that were stratified by sex to determine if
mediation findings were present for both male and female subsamples. In
addition, because both short and long sleep duration are correlates of
negative health outcomes, each of which is more common among AAs (12),
linear and nonlinear associations between sleep minutes and CMB risk were
estimated (i.e., sleep minutes squared was included as predictor). Further-
more, to reduce the likelihood of reverse causality, we fit models in which
we excluded participants with heart disease or diabetes. Last, mediation
models were fit among participants who reported no experience of chronic
sleeping problems.
