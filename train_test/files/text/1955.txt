Objectives. This article investigates the theoretical and empirical relationship between age identity and subjective well-
being (SWB) in a cross-national context. Feeling younger than one's actual age is considered a self-enhancing illusion that
contributes to SWB even beyond factors predicting age identities and SWB, such as health and socioeconomic status. As
the United States is more youth oriented than Germany, age identities are expected to be more adaptive for American adults.
Methods. Data are from respondents between 40 and 74 years of age who participated in the National Survey of
Midlife Development in the United States (N ¼ 2,006) or the German Aging Survey (N ¼ 3,331).
Results. Analyses using the pooled sample reveal that feeling younger than one's actual age is related to higher levels
of life satisfaction and positive affect and to lower levels of negative affect, even when controlling for sociodemographic
variables. Country-specific analyses indicate that the relationship between age identity and negative affect holds only for
the United States.
Discussion. Age identities play a role in more varied aspects of psychosocial adaptation in the United States than in
Germany. It is concluded that the cultural context needs to be included more explicitly in gerontological theories and research.
WESTERN culture has been criticized for its celebration of
youth and devaluation of old age (Fry, 1996). Research
reveals that older individuals are confronted with ageism on
a daily basis. This ranges from subtle forms of patronizing to
inappropriate treatment in medical settings and even includes
institutionalized forms such as legislation regarding retirement
(Pasupathi & Lo
¨ckenhoff, 2002). In addition to creating a stress-
ful environment, ageism might be turned toward the self with
debilitating consequences (Rothermund & Brandtsta
¨dter, 2003).
Levy (2003) found that older persons who were subliminally
primed with negative stereotypes of old age performed worse on
memory tasks, handwriting, and walking and showed higher
cardiovascular stress than older persons who were primed with
positive stereotypes of old age. These findings document the
incapacitating effects that living in an ageist environment can
have for older adults.
Whereas these effects are beyond cognitive awareness, indi-
viduals have been found to resist the internalization of aging
stereotypes on an explicit level (Zebrowitz, 2003). Many older
adults resist the label ``elderly'' and report youthful self-
perceptions. Adults in middle and later adulthood tend to feel
younger than their actual age, and this discrepancy is larger
in older than in middle-aged adults (Barak & Stern, 1986;
Goldsmith & Heiens, 1992; Montepare & Lachman, 1989).
Although they may be ``old'' according to cultural standards,
many people do not feel old individually.
Resisting the internalization of ageist stereotypes can be
considered a self-enhancing strategy (Filipp & Ferring, 1989;
Montepare & Lachman, 1989; Staats, 1996), the effectiveness
of which has been shown in studies of physical health
(Levy, Slade, Kunkel, & Kasl, 2002a) and mortality (Levy,
Slade, & Kasl, 2002b; Maier & Smith, 1999). Studies also
indicate that persons who feel younger than they actually are
report higher levels of subjective well-being (SWB) (Barak &
Stern, 1986; Logan, Ward, & Spitze, 1992; Montepare, 1996).
However, others find no association (Filipp & Ferring, 1989) or
even an inverse relation (Montepare & Lachman, 1989)
with SWB.
At least two aspects of these studies on SWB deserve closer
consideration. First, most investigations are not well situated in
the literature on SWB. As a result, the choice of measures is not
always grounded in theory. Also stemming from this limitation,
most studies do not systematically control for social factors that
may influence age identity, SWB, or both. As both tend to have
a number of similar correlates such as health and socioeconomic
status (Barak & Stern, 1986), the observed relationship between
age identity and SWB might be a spurious one. Second, it is
unclear how far the results of these studies generalize. As nearly
all studies were carried out in the United States, typically using
nonrepresentative samples, it remains unclear whether age under-
estimation has the same adaptive value over the adult life
course in all regions of the United States as well as other
cultures. Although Western cultures are typically seen in the
same way with respect to the denial of old age, one might ex-
pect that there are differences between Western cultures as
well. For example, Filipp and Ferring (1989) found no relation-
ship of subjective age with self-concept and life satisfaction in
a German sample.
Our study investigates the relationship between age identity
and SWB among middle-aged and older Americans and
Germans in two nationally representative samples. In the fol-
lowing, we first discuss the theoretical relation between age
identity and SWB. Next, we address possible differences in this
association between Americans and Germans.

AGE, AGE IDENTITY, AND SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING
Over the last several decades, there has been a flourishing
interest in the study of SWB (Diener, Suh, Lucas, & Smith,
1999). Beginning with the study of Andrews and Whithey
(1976), there is a widespread consensus that SWB is a multi-
dimensional concept, including cognitive evaluations of life in
general (i.e., life satisfaction) as well as positive and negative
affect. These three dimensions represent correlated, yet clearly
separable, aspects of SWB (Diener et al., 1999). The different
patterns of relationships with other variables also document the
validity of the threefold structure of SWB (Westerhof, 2001).
One might expect that the SWB of older adults is negatively
affected by age-related losses of roles and relationships, age-
related declines in psychophysical functioning, as well as
widespread ageism in our society. Yet, research has found
remarkably few age differences in SWB. Only positive affect is
consistently found to be somewhat lower in older adults (Diener
& Suh, 1998; Mroczek & Kolarz, 1998; Westerhof, 2001).
Psychological lifespan theories have focused on the strategies
by which individuals adapt to age-related changes in order to
maintain a positive sense of well-being. Identification with
younger ages can be considered such a strategy in a culture
that views and treats old age in a negative way (Sneed &
Whitbourne, 2003). Heckhausen and Schulz (1998) also have
argued that individuals can compensate for the negative impli-
cations of ageism by feeling young. This strategy might con-
tribute to well-being as it belongs to the domain of positive
illusions. Research on positive illusions suggests that judging
oneself more favorably than objective indicators might warrant
promotes SWB (Taylor & Brown, 1988). Positive illusions are
also important in avoiding negative mental health states such as
depression (Alloy & Abramson, 1988). The ability to maintain
positive self-perceptions, such as feeling young, appears to be
central to psychosocial adjustment throughout life. Hence, age
identity is expected to be related to positive as well as negative
dimensions of SWB.
CULTURAL SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES
Although Schulz and Heckhausen (1999) have argued that
cultural variations in the use of adaptation strategies might exist,
this issue has received limited empirical and theoretical attention
in gerontology. For example, although the model of selective
optimization with compensation was originally developed in
Germany (Baltes & Baltes, 1990), it is applied in the United
States without taking into consideration any cross-national dif-
ferences. This example has relevance for our study as youthful
age identities are viewed as a compensatory strategy (Heck-
hausen & Schulz, 1998). In the following, we will discuss how
orientations toward individualism and collectivism, which are
considered one of the basic dimensions of cultural differences
(Hofstede, 1980), might be related to the use of youthful identities
as a compensating strategy.
The United States has a stronger individualistic orientation
than Germany (Diener, Diener, & Diener, 1995; Hofstede, 1980).
The somewhat less individualistic culture of Germany might
result from a cultural history with a traditionally hierarchical and
feudal structure of society, more formalized social behaviors, and
relatively recent experiences with democracy (Bode, 2003).
Furthermore, Esping-Andersen (1990) describes Germany as
a corporatist welfare state regime where health care and social
security are more a concern of the state than the individual. In
contrast, the liberal system of the United States is associated with
greater individual responsibility for health and social welfare.
These differences in value orientations and accompanying
social structures have implications for well-being as well as age
identity. Besides wealth, the level of individualism is considered
one of the most important factors contributing to the well-being
of nations (Diener et al., 1995; Diener & Suh, 1999; Veenhoven,
1999). Whereas the United States and Germany do not differ
much with regard to wealth (e.g., the rate of consumption power
of German compared with American citizens was 1.010 in 1996;
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
[OECD], 2004), the stronger orientation toward individualism
in the United States might result in higher levels of well-being.
It, indeed, has been found that Americans enjoy greater well-
being than Germans, as measured by life satisfaction and posi-
tive and negative affects (Diener & Suh, 1999; Veenhoven,
1993). Individualism adds to the individual possibilities of
realizing one's own goals and thus may contribute to well-being
(Diener & Suh, 1999). However, individualism also might lead
to a greater tendency to express self-enhancement (Markus &
Kitayama, 1991; Westerhof, Dittmann-Kohli, & Katzko, 2000).
In the American cultural context, one's worth as an individual
is less a social given than in Germany and needs to be earned
and demonstrated (Crocker & Park, 2004).
Individualism may be related to age identity as well. Indi-
vidualism tends to be linked with the youth-centeredness of
a culture. In youth-oriented cultures, older persons are at risk of
losing self-worth when their economic self-sufficiency or auton-
omous functioning in everyday life declines (Gergen & Gergen,
2000). Compared with the German context, the American system
places greater responsibility on individuals to plan for their later
years and remain economically productive and thereby stim-
ulates a higher value for youth. In contrast, the German system
generates more collective support, also for older persons.
Although there is a trend toward more flexible life courses in
both countries, the welfare state of Germany is more explicitly
and formally age graded (Dannefer, 2000). For example,
Germany has a mandatory age of retirement (65 years), and re-
tirement is basically a single transition that is closely tied to chro-
nological age (Kohli, 1994). This stronger age-graded nature of
the German system might make it more difficult to deny one's
age. Consistent with these arguments, our prior work indicates
that Americans maintain more youthful identities than do
Germans, in particular at older ages (Westerhof, Barrett, &
Steverink, 2003).
In addition to the stronger identification with younger ages
observed among Americans in midlife and beyond (Westerhof
et al., 2003), one also might expect that the adaptive value of
youthful identities is higher in this cultural context. Positive
illusions are expected to have a stronger impact on positive and
negative aspects of SWB in a culture that supports self-enhance-
ment and favors youthfulness to a greater degree. Furthermore,
the individualistic system of the United States might leave
more room for individual strategies of adaptation to aging
(Staudinger, Fleeson, & Baltes, 1999; Suh, Diener, Oishi, &
Triandis, 1998). As both cultures appear to be youth oriented,
but the United States more so than Germany, we expect that age

identity will be related to SWB in both countries, but this rela-
tionship will be stronger in the United States than in Germany.
METHODS
Samples
United States. --American data are drawn from the National
Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS)
(Brim, Ryff, & Kessler, 2004) collected in 1995 and 1996 by
the MacArthur Foundation's Network on Successful Midlife
Development. This survey was a random-digit dialing sample
of noninstitutionalized English-speaking adults aged 25­74
years, living in the 48 contiguous states, whose household
included at least one telephone. In the first stage of the multi-
stage sampling design, investigators selected households with
equal probability via telephone numbers. At the second stage,
they used disproportionate stratified sampling to select respon-
dents. The sample was stratified by age and gender; men be-
tween ages 65 and 74 were oversampled. Respondents took part
in a computer-assisted telephone interview lasting 30 minutes
on average. Respondents also were mailed a questionnaire
requiring 1.5 hours, on average, to complete. The response rate
was estimated to be 70% for the telephone interview and 87%
for the self-administered questionnaire, yielding an overall
response rate of 61% (.70 3 .87 ¼ .61). Three thousand thirty-
two persons participated in both the telephone and the ques-
tionnaire phase of the study.
Germany. --In the German Aging Survey, independently liv-
ing persons between 40 and 85 years old were interviewed in
1996 (Dittmann-Kohli, Bode, & Westerhof, 2001). The sample
consisted of randomly chosen individuals from the population
registers of 290 cities in the Federal Republic of Germany. It was
stratified by age group (40­54, 55­69, 70­85 years), gender, and
residence in the former Federal Republic of Germany/German
Democratic Republic. Fifty percent of those contacted (N ¼
9,613) were willing to participate (N ¼ 4,838). The response
rates were 63%, 56%, and 40% in the respective age groups. A
face-to-face-interview of about 1.5 hours was held with ques-
tions concerning life circumstances in different domains (family
and social relations, work and activities, living arrangements,
health, and income) as well as respondents' evaluations of them.
A paper-and-pencil questionnaire including several psycholog-
ical scales, attitudinal items, and questions about chronic
conditions was left with respondents. They filled out the ques-
tionnaire on their own, and it was collected later by the inter-
viewer. Four thousand thirty-four respondents returned the
questionnaire (a return rate of 83%). Respondents who returned
the questionnaire did not significantly differ from respondents
who did not. The total response rate was 42% (.50 3 .83 ¼ .42).
The MIDUS sample covers an age range of 25­74 years and
the German Aging Survey 40­85 years. In this study, respon-
dents are included in the overlapping age range of 40­74 years
(NUSA
¼ 2,006; NFRG
¼ 3,331). We underscore that our study
employs cross-sectional data that do not allow the determination
of causal relationships between age identity and SWB. Our
models assume a causal order (e.g., nationality influences age
identity, which shapes SWB); however, relationships are likely
to be considerably more complex than our data permit us to
explore.
Measures
Age identity. --Subjective age has been measured in the two
countries with slightly different questions. In the American
sample, the following question was asked in the self-admin-
istered questionnaire: ``Many people feel older or younger than
they actually are. What age do you feel most of the time?'' In
the German sample, the following question was used: ``Aside
from your actual age, when you should express it in the number
of years, how old do you feel?'' The difference between one's
actual and subjective ages is used as a measure of age identity.
When a respondent's subjective age is younger than his or her
actual age, a positive value is obtained; when subjective age
is older, age identity has a negative value. To avoid the influ-
ence of extreme scores in the regression analyses, the top and
bottom 1% of the scores were declared missing. Age identity
ranges from À10 (10 years older than one's actual age) to 35
(35 years younger than one's actual age).
Subjective well-being. --We examine three dimensions of
SWB identified in prior work: life satisfaction and positive and
negative affect (Diener et al., 1999). In the American sample, the
life satisfaction measure was an adaptation of Cantril's (1965)
Self-Anchoring Scale. It asked respondents to ``rate their life
overall these days'' on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst
possible life overall and 10 is the best possible life overall.
Variants of Cantril's measure have been used extensively in
numerous studies worldwide, usually providing satisfactory
psychometric properties (Andrews & Robinson, 1991). In the
German sample, the Satisfaction with Life Scale (Pavot &
Diener, 1993) was used. This five-item scale with a 5-point
answering format has good reliability (Cronbach's a ¼ .86) and
validity in this sample (Westerhof, 2001). The German scale
was linearly transformed to scores ranging from 0 to 10.
The affect measures in the American study asked respondents
to indicate on a 5-point scale how much of the time during the
last 30 days they felt six types of negative affect (e.g., hopeless,
nervous, and sad; a ¼ .87) and six types of positive affect (e.g.,
cheerful, calm, and peaceful; a ¼ .91; see Mroczek & Kolarz
[1998] for a description of the development of these measures).
In the German study, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule
(Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) was used. Respondents were
asked to rate on a 5-point scale how much of the time during the
last month they felt 10 negative affects (e.g., nervous, afraid, and
distressed; a ¼ .82) and 10 positive affects (e.g., interested,
excited, and proud; a ¼ .87). In both samples, the mean fre-
quency of negative and positive affect was computed.
Sociodemographic variables. --Nationality is represented by
a dichotomous variable: Germans are coded 1 and Americans 0.
Chronological age is measured in years. Gender, socioeconomic
status, health, and marital and employment status are used as
controls as they have been found to be related to SWB (Diener et
al., 1999) or age identity (Barak & Stern, 1986). Gender is coded
1 for women and 0 for men. Socioeconomic status was assessed
by educational level and household income. Education is coded
in the American sample using four categories: did not graduate
AGE IDENTITY AND SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING S131
from high school, graduated from high school, some college (no
degree), and graduated from college. In Germany, three cate-
gories were used: lower education (Hauptschulabschluß ohne
Ausbildungsabschluß), middle education (Hauptschulabschluß
mit Ausbildungsabschluß oder Realschulabschluß), and higher
education (Realschulabschluß/Abitur mit Ausbildungsabschluß
oder Hochschulabschluss). The Ausbildungsabschluss (voca-
tional training) was included in this variable as many older
individuals received their training only later in life as a result of
the Second World War. These categories correspond roughly to
,10 years of education, between 10 and 12 years, and .12
years. In the MIDUS Study, household income was measured as
the sum of five separate gross yearly income sources: self,
spouse, Social Security, government assistance, and all other
income sources. In the German Aging Survey, respondents were
asked for their actual total monthly household income (after
an explanation of the different income sources that should be
summed). Respondents who refused to answer were explained
the importance of the question and then asked to indicate which
of 14 income categories applied to them. These respondents
were assigned the middle value of the category they chose. In
both samples, missing values were imputed according to age
group, gender, and educational level, and in the German sample
also according to place of residence (i.e., former Federal
Republic of Germany/German Democratic Republic). This
was done for 18.7% of the American sample and 15.5% of the
German sample. The education and income variables were z
standardized within each country. The mean of these z scores
was computed as an indicator of socioeconomic status (see
Staudinger et al. [1999] for this procedure). Marital status is
controlled in the analyses; the currently married are coded 1 and
the unmarried 0. A dichotomous variable indicating employment
status also is added with respondents coded 1 if currently
working for pay and 0 otherwise. Two measures of health are
used: number of chronic conditions and self-rated health.
Because the checklists of chronic conditions differed in the
two studies, only those 12 conditions that were asked in both are
included: cancer, heart condition, diabetes, headache/migraine,
gall bladder, anxiety, and vascular, pulmonary, orthopedic, uri-
nary, sleep, and digestive problems. Self-rated health in the
United States is represented by the answer to the question: ``In
general, would you say your physical health is . . . poor, fair,
good, very good, or excellent?'' In the German sample, the
following question is asked: ``How would you rate your present
health situation?'' Response categories were very poor, poor,
average, good, and very good. Both variables were recoded into
four categories, indicating (very) poor, fair/average, good, or
very good/excellent. Higher values represent better health.
Analyses
With use of the pooled sample, ordinary least-squares re-
gression is used to assess the relationship of age identity with
each dimension of SWB. Explanatory variables are entered in
several steps to assess their unique relationship with SWB,
controlling for variables assumed to be causally prior. In the first
step, the dichotomous variable indicating nationality is entered.
Chronological age, gender, and socioeconomic status are added
in the second model. Factors that may be influenced by one's
age, gender, and socioeconomic status are entered in the third
model: marital and employment status, chronic conditions, and
self-rated health. Age identity is entered last to assess whether it
contributes to SWB over and above the other factors. Moreover,
age identity is argued to be influenced, in part, by one's gender
(Pinquart & So
¨rensen, 2001) and one's socioeconomic status
and health (Barrett, 2003; Westerhof et al., 2003).
Interaction effects are computed to assess potential differ-
ences between the United States and Germany in the relationship
of age identity with SWB, controlling for the other variables. The
interaction terms of nationality with the other independent
variables (i.e., age, gender, socioeconomic status, marital and
employment status, objective and subjective health, and age
identity) are entered together into the regression equation. When
the interaction between nationality and age identity proved
significant, the regression equations were estimated in the United
States and Germany separately. T tests were carried out to assess
the significance of the difference between the regression coef-
ficients (Hardy, 1993).
Missing values were imputed only for income. Respondents
who had missing values on one or more of the other variables
were excluded from the analyses. Most missing values were
obtained on age identity (N ¼ 226), chronic conditions (N ¼
276), positive affect (N ¼ 197), and negative affect (N ¼ 176).
One thousand seven hundred thirty-six American and 2,762
German respondents were included in the analyses.
RESULTS
Table 1 presents mean differences between Germans and
Americans on all variables used in the analyses. Significant
differences are observed for all variables except gender and
socioeconomic status. Compared with Germans, Americans re-
port more youthful identities, higher levels of life satisfaction
and positive affect, and lower levels of negative affect. They are
younger, less likely to be married, and more likely to be working
in the paid labor force. They also report fewer chronic con-
ditions and better self-rated health.
Our first expectations concerned the relationship between age
identity and SWB, controlling for age, gender, socioeconomic
status, marital and employment status, and health. Bivariate
analyses indicated that, as predicted, younger age identities are
associated with greater life satisfaction and more positive and
less negative affect. The correlation coefficients range from .20

to .24 (see Appendix). Age, socioeconomic status, marital and
employment status, number of chronic conditions, and subjec-
tive health are significantly related to the three dimensions of
SWB. Gender is related only to negative affect, with women
reporting higher levels than men.
As age identity is significantly associated with all other in-
dependent variables, it is necessary to control for these indicators
in the analyses of the relationship between age identity and
SWB. The regression analysis of life satisfaction on nationality
shows that Americans experience higher levels of life satisfac-
tion than Germans (Table 2). The second model reveals that
older persons, women, and those with higher socioeconomic
status report greater life satisfaction. Model 3 shows that being
married and having fewer chronic conditions and better sub-
jective health also are associated with higher life satisfaction.
These variables partially mediate the relationship between na-
tionality and life satisfaction; the coefficient for nationality
declines by about 30% but remains significant. Post-hoc ana-
lyses show that subjective health plays the most important role in
mediating the relationship between nationality and life satisfac-
tion. Results also indicate that the coefficient for chronological
age increases when marital status and health are added to
the equation. Controlling for older respondents' greater likeli-
hood of experiencing widowhood and health declines increases
the positive association between chronological age and life
satisfaction.
Model 4 reveals that age identity is significantly related to
life satisfaction, even when controlling for other factors related
to SWB. Those who experience younger identities report higher
levels of life satisfaction. The explained variance (adjusted R2)
increases significantly when age identity is added to the model.
Analyses of positive affect show a small, but significant, re-
lationship with nationality; American respondents report higher
levels of positive affect than Germans. Higher socioeconomic
status, marriage, paid work, fewer chronic conditions, and better
subjective health are related to higher levels of positive affect.
Similar to the findings for life satisfaction, marital and em-
ployment status and health suppress the association between
chronological age and positive affect; older respondents report
higher levels of positive affect. The variables added in Model 3
also suppress the association between nationality and positive
affect. In Model 2, it was found that Germans report significantly
lower positive affect than Americans; however, Model 3 in-
dicates that the reverse is true. Post-hoc analyses show that the
better subjective health of the Americans is responsible for this
reversal. Adding age identity in Model 4 results in a significant
increase in explained variance (adjusted R2). More youthful
identities are associated with higher levels of positive affect. In
addition, age identity suppresses the association between nation-
ality and positive affect, suggesting that if Germans had the more
youthful identities of Americans, they would report even higher
levels of positive affect. Age identity mediates the effects of
age on positive affects: The coefficient of age declines by about
one third.
The analyses of negative affect more or less mirror those of
life satisfaction. Americans, older persons, women, and those
with higher socioeconomic status, fewer chronic conditions, and
better subjective health report lower levels of negative affect.
The results also indicate a mediating association such that
Americans' lower level of negative affect is partially explained
by their better health; with the inclusion of both indicators of
health, the coefficient for nationality is reduced by 15%. Health
suppresses the association between age and negative affect.
Adding age identity significantly increases the explained vari-
ance, and younger identities are associated with lower levels of
negative affect.
To summarize, identifying with younger ages is associated
with better SWB, even when controlling for sociodemographic
variables. Furthermore, Germans report less life satisfaction and
greater negative affect; however, taking into account their worse
subjective health, they report higher levels of positive affect than
Americans.
Our second expectation was that age identity is more strongly
related to SWB in the United States than in Germany. Including
the interactions between nationality and the other independent
variables resulted in an increase in explained variance for each
of the three measures of SWB. However, only in one case (i.e.,
negative affect) did the regression weight for age identity differ
significantly between the two countries. As Table 3 shows, age

AGE IDENTITY AND SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING S133
identity is significantly related to negative affect in the United
States but not in Germany. Furthermore, in the United States,
marriage and chronic conditions appear to be more strongly
related to negative affect than in Germany. Figure 1 illustrates
the relationship between age identity and negative affect by
nationality. The figure plots the regression equations for Amer-
icans and Germans, imputing the mean scores for chronological
age, gender, socioeconomic status, marital and employment
status, chronic conditions, and subjective health. It can be seen
that Americans experience lower levels of negative affect than
Germans. Whereas in the United States, those with younger
identities (i.e., those with higher scores) experience less nega-
tive affect than those with older identities, there is no such
relationship among Germans. There are no national differences
in the association between age identity and positive measures of
SWB (i.e., life satisfaction and positive affect).
DISCUSSION
With use of data on middle-aged and young-old adults in the
United States and Germany, this study examined the relation-
ship between age identity and SWB. Its goal was to better
integrate age identity into theories of SWB and to empirically
assess the derived hypotheses in two nationally representative
samples from the United States and Germany. As a self-enhanc-
ing positive illusion, age identity was expected to be an im-
portant predictor of SWB in cultural contexts in which youth is
highly valued. However, drawing on prior work indicating the
more youthful identities of Americans compared with Germans
(Westerhof et al., 2003), it also was anticipated that the asso-
ciation of age identity with SWB differs in the two countries.
The results of the pooled sample indicate that maintaining
a more youthful identity (i.e., a larger discrepancy between ac-
tual and subjective age) is associated with higher levels of SWB,
even when controlling for chronological age, gender, socioeco-
nomic status, marital and employment status, and objective and
subjective health. In the model of positive affect, the relationship
with age identity even mediated the effect of actual age. The
results are consistent with the argument that feeling younger
than one's actual age may function as a positive illusion that
promotes SWB.
The expectation that age identity is more strongly related to
SWB in the United States than in Germany receives partial
support. There is no difference in the association between age
identity and SWB with regard to its positive aspects (i.e., life
satisfaction and positive affect). These findings suggest that age
identity can be considered a positive illusion that enhances
positive well-being among middle-aged and older individuals in
both countries. However, the relationship between age identity
and negative affect holds only among Americans. In other
words, the effect of positive illusions regarding one's age ap-
pears to be stronger in the United States in the sense that it not
only enhances positive well-being but also protects against high
levels of negative affect. This finding could be interpreted as an
indication that the self-enhancing strategy of identifying with
younger ages more effectively promotes SWB in a culture that is
more strongly youth oriented.
Another interpretation of this finding would be that self-en-
hancement, in general, is more important in a more individ-
ualistically oriented culture like the United States than in a more
collectivist culture like Germany. Our study reveals higher
levels of well-being among Americans than Germans and thus
replicates previous findings (Diener et al., 1995; Veenhoven,
1993). However, it should be noted that although this relation-
ship held in bivariate and multivariate analyses of life satis-
faction and negative affect, the expected pattern was found only
in bivariate analyses of positive affect. Models controlling on
Germans' worse subjective health reveal higher levels of posi-
tive affect among Germans than Americans. A mediating effect
for subjective health is found in the models of life satisfaction
and negative affect as well. The subjective health experience is
better in the United States than in Germany, and it provides
a partial explanation for the higher life satisfaction and lower
level of negative affect reported by Americans. In another ar-
ticle, we have argued that the better subjective health of the
Americans is not a methodologic artifact (Westerhof et al.,
2003). Hence, we might conclude that some aspects of self-
enhancement are stronger in the United States than in Germany.
A high cultural value on well-being, health, and youth appar-
ently provides the context for Americans' greater need for
positive illusions.

A number of limitations of our study should be noted. The
cross-sectional data limit our ability to determine causal rela-
tionships between age identity and SWB. Our models reflect the
assumption that age identity influences SWB; however, it is
likely that the relationship is bidirectional. Determining causal
relationships will require longitudinal data, which are scarce in
studies of age identity. Another limitation is introduced by the
use of studies that were not designed to be compared. Because
the measures were not always identical in the MIDUS and
German Aging Survey, this might have influenced the results.
We believe that there is no basis for predicting that the American
question on subjective age resulted in younger identities than the
German question. The affect measures also show some differ-
ences in the items and question format. As these may intrude
on the relationships between age and affect found in a study
(Diener & Suh, 1998), we should be careful in interpreting the
cross-cultural differences with regard to the affective dimen-
sions of SWB.
Our study also is limited by the use of a measure of age identity
that is rather general; research has shown that people hold
multidimensional age identities (Kastenbaum, Derbin, Sabatini,
& Artt, 1972; Steverink, Westerhof, Bode, & Dittmann-Kohli,
2001). Similarly, we have not been able to consider other dimen-
sions of successful aging that have been linked with age identity
and self-perceptions of aging, like depressive symptoms, other
indicators of mental health, physical health, and even mortality
(Barak & Stern, 1986; Levy, 2003). Despite these limitations, the
use of two nationally representative samples compares favorably
with the ad-hoc methods of data collection on which cross-
cultural studies on later life have tended to rely (Dasen & Mishra,
2000). Our study suggests that further work on cross-cultural
differences is warranted.
Feeling younger than one's chronological age is considered
a compensatory strategy (Heckhausen & Schulz, 1998). Even
though this strategy is found among aging individuals in the
United States as well as in Germany, we now know that it is
used in a more exaggerated way in the United States and that
its adaptive value is stronger in the U.S.A. than in Germany. Our
study not only shows that it is worthwhile to explore whether
other adaptation strategies show cross-national differences as
well, it also points out that individual adaptation strategies need
to be studied in their cultural context. One should be very care-
ful in ``exporting'' theories developed in one cultural context
to another, even among cultures that are commonly thought
to belong to the same cultural region. In sum, culture needs to
be included more explicitly in gerontological theories and
research.
