Introduction
The business model concept has become very popular in
terms of a company's competitive success as well as in man-
agement science. Regarding companies, whenever a busi-
ness venture is established, it either explicitly or implicitly
employs a particular business model (Teece, 2010), and for a
venture to become viable, a sound business model is required
(Magretta, 2002). Also, business model design and innova-
tion are of critical importance for a company's performance
and success (Kesting & Günzel-Jensen, 2015; Zott & Amit,
2007; Zott, Amit, & Massa, 2011).
These claims may sound very clear and logical, but a
question arises: Do we know how to build a sound and inno-
vative business model? Put differently, what stands behind
this concept? Recently, many authors from various fields of
research have been looking for appropriate answers (Arend,
2013; Casadesus-Masanell & Zhu, 2013; Chesbrough, 2007;
Johnson, Christensen, & Kagermann, 2008; Kesting &
Günzel-Jensen, 2015; Klang, Wallnöfer, & Hacklin, 2014;
Osterwalder, Pigneur, & Tucci, 2005; Schaltegger, Hansen,
& Lüdeke-Freund, 2016; Seelos & Mair, 2005; Zott & Amit,
2010, etc.) and it really seems that the business model is
emerging as a new unit of analysis (Zott et al., 2011). These
authors offer a variety of definitions, but a general consensus
on the definition of the business model has not been reached.
The term has been frequently confused with other popular
terms in the management literature such as strategy, business
concept, revenue model, economic model, or even business
process modeling (DaSilva & Trkman, 2014; Morris,
Schindehutte, & Allen, 2005).
As a generally accepted definition of the business model
does not exist, it is not surprising that the constitute elements
of the business model are not clearly defined too. Despite
many efforts (e.g., Demil & Lecocq, 2010; Mahadevan,
2000; Morris et al., 2005; Onetti, Zucchella, Jones, &
McDougall-Covin, 2012; Osterwalder & Pigneur, 2010;
Richardson, 2008; Roome & Louche, 2016; Runfola, Rosati,
& Guercini, 2013; Shafer, Smith, & Linder, 2005), this issue
still allows for different interpretations. For that reason, aim-
ing to make the business model concept more transparent,
some authors have extensively explored extant literature and
meta-science databases (DaSilva & Trkman, 2014; Ghaziani
& Ventresca, 2005; Kujala, Artto, Aaltonen, & Turkulainen,
2010; Mäkinen & Seppänen, 2007; Morris et al., 2005;

The Constructs of a Business Model
Redefined: A Half-Century Journey
Marko Peric1, Jelena Durkin1, and Vanja Vitezic1
Abstract
Despite its growing popularity, the term business model has not been uniquely defined so far. Within the management
science and practice, it has been frequently confused with other popular terms. This article aims to bring clarity into what
stands behind the business model concept by providing a review of the most common themes used in defining business
model elements. It also discusses the relationship between the concept of a business model, on one hand, and strategy and
sustainability, on the other. A few conclusions emerge. First, although there are no generally accepted definitions for either
the business model or its building blocks, academics and practitioners agree that a business model is all about value. Second,
a business model is not the same as a strategy but it has an important role in strategy implementation. Third, sustainability
is found to be a hot topic for business models and has been increasingly used in symbiosis with this concept. Besides being
a theoretical contribution to a definition of the business model as an independent concept, the findings may be particularly
helpful to managers and business practitioners seeking ways to enable their firms to deal with complex market challenges
and gain competitive advantage.

business model, strategy, sustainability
2 SAGE Open
& Göttel, 2016; Zott et al., 2011). Their conclusions are quite
similar; the research on business models shows a high degree
of complexity and is still an underresearched topic within the
management field.
This article builds on these recent works reviewing the
state of the art in business model research and has two main
objectives. First, it intends to provide a review of the most
common themes used in defining business model elements.
Second, it discusses the relationship between the concept of
a business model, on one hand, and strategy and sustainabil-
ity, on the other. Providing new insights into the business
model notion, the findings not only contribute to the devel-
opment of management theory but could be also used by the
managers and business practitioners of new entrants as well
as incumbent firms to design business models capable of
addressing direct competitive challenges.
The article proceeds as follows. The "Literature Review"
section provides a synthesized overview of the available lit-
erature, focusing on the emergence and popularity of the
business model concept in academic literature as well as on
business model definition. The "Method" section describes
the methodology of research. The "Results" section details
the results obtained regarding business model elements and
two issues usually associated with business models: strategy
and sustainability. The article finishes with a discussion and
some concluding remarks.
Literature Review
Emergence of the Business Model Concept in
Literature
The term business model has been present in academic litera-
ture for more than 60 years now. According to Markides
(2013), its first use in the literature can be traced to Lang
(1947), while Osterwalder et al. (2005) found that it appeared
for the first time in an academic paper in 1957 (in the context
of business games for training purposes; Bellman, Clark,
Malcolm, Craft, & Ricciardi, 1957) and in the title and
abstract of a paper in 1960 (how college students from the
business field should be trained and how technologies should
be introduced to them; Jones, 1960). In the beginning, how-
ever, the term was used in a very unspecific manner, reflect-
ing a simplification and simulation of reality aimed at
educating future managers on technology (DaSilva &
Trkman, 2014). Since the 1970s, the business model has
been associated regularly within the context of information
technology and mainly used in the sense of business model-
ing (see Wirtz et al., 2016). This highlighted its operational
and functional aspects necessary for system modeling. Still,
until the 1990s, the term had been used only sporadically.
The advent of the Internet in the business world gave a boost
to the usage of the term business model (see Amit & Zott,
2001; Magretta, 2002), with so-called dot-com firms pitch-
ing business models to attract funding (Shafer et al., 2005).
In parallel, academics searched for more generic approaches
in their researches, and the business model has developed
into an overall presentation of the company organization
contributing to managerial decision-making process (Wirtz
et al., 2016).
During the "new economy" era (Morris et al., 2005), that
is, the 1990s, we witnessed an explosion of the use of the
term in both nonacademic and academic literature. Only in
the last decade, at least five special issues were devoted to
business models (e.g., the Long Range Planning in 2010, the
Journal of Cleaner Production in 2013, the Strategic
Entrepreneurship Journal in 2015, and the Sustainability and
the Organization & Environment in 2016).
The rise to prominence of the term was also confirmed by
many authors who have extensively explored extant litera-
ture, by searching the term business model in the title,
abstract, or full text of the articles (DaSilva & Trkman, 2014;
Ghaziani & Ventresca, 2005; Klang et al., 2014; Kujala et al.,
2010; Mäkinen & Seppänen, 2007; Morris et al., 2005;
Nenonen & Storbacka, 2010; Onetti et al., 2012; Osterwalder
et al., 2005; Richardson, 2008; Shafer et al., 2005; Wirtz
et al., 2016; Zott et al., 2011). Their findings suggest that, in
peer-reviewed journals, the number of articles has grown
from a single-digit number per year to more than several 100
articles per year in the last 50 years. The rapid growth of
references to the business model in the literature has cer-
tainly contributed to the efforts to theoretically and opera-
tionally define this concept. Despite the fact that research in
business models has matured over the years, the literature on
business models is divergent and heterogeneous.
Business Model Definitions
Analyzing the evolution of the business model concept,
Osterwalder et al. (2005) concluded that this evolution has
entered its final phase, with the business model concept
being applied in management and information systems (IS)
applications. This implies that the previous four phases (defi-
nition and classification of business models, listing business
model components, describing business model components,
and modeling business model components) have all been fin-
ished. However, just from a short glance at Table 1, which
presents a synopsis of available perspectives regarding busi-
ness model definitions, one can see that it is still quite an
interesting topic for academics.
Also, it seems that the term is not clearly and unambigu-
ously defined. The business model has been referred to as a
statement, a description, a representation, an architecture, a
conceptual tool or model, a plan, an assumption, a structural
template, a method, a framework, a pattern, and a set (see
also Morris et al., 2005; Zott et al., 2011).
Morris et al. (2005), Zott et al. (2011), and Wirtz et al.
(2016) tried to bring some order to the various perspectives
in the gathered definitions. Summarizing their findings, sev-
eral general approaches, perspectives, and/or categories of
Peric et al. 3
definitions could be distinguished: technological, economic,
operational, and strategic. The technologically oriented busi-
ness model articles were very dominant during the earlier
stages of business model evolution. It was at the turn of the
new millennium that many articles were published in the
context of electronic business (Chen, 2003; Dai & Kauffman,
2002; Lam & Harrison-Walker, 2003; Rayman-Bacchus &
Molina, 2001; Timmers, 1998, to list only a few). Afterward,
the business model concept became more generic, that is,
more universally applicable to other types of firm. The eco-
nomic approach is concerned with the logic of profit genera-
tion, that is, how to make money and sustain its profit stream

over time (Abdelkafi, Makhotin, & Posselt, 2013; Shafer
et al., 2005; Stewart & Zhao, 2000; Teece, 2010). The opera-
tional perspective embraces architectural configuration that
enables the firm to create value (Morris et al., 2005). This
architectural approach further involves firms' internal pro-
cesses, resources, and their organization (Amit & Zott, 2001,
2015; Johnson et al., 2008; Osterwalder et al., 2005;Timmers,
1998; Voelpel, Leibold, Tekie, & von Krogh, 2005; Wells,
2016). Finally, definitions also emphasize firms' strategies,
with particular interest on market positioning, organizational
boundaries, stakeholder identification and networks, com-
petitive advantage, and sustainability (Baden-Fuller &
Haefliger, 2013; Casadesus-Masanell & Ricart, 2010;
Casadesus-Masanell & Zhu, 2013; Cavalcante, Kesting, &
Ulhøi, 2011; Chesbrough & Rosenbloom, 2002; Shafer et al.,
2005; Voelpel et al., 2005). Furthermore, the strengths of the
more strategy-oriented articles lie in efforts to understand
business by decomposing strategy into a system of interre-
lated decisions, relationships, and organizational boundaries
(Onetti et al., 2012).
The variety of perspectives become more comprehensible
as one progressively moves from the technological and eco-
nomic across the operational to the strategic levels (Morris
et al., 2005). However, the boundaries between basic theo-
ries become blurred (Wirtz et al., 2016; Zott et al., 2011), and
it would be very hard to draw a line between these dimen-
sions as the majority of definitions encompass at least two or
three categories. In recent articles, authors mostly refer to the
fundamental works and aspects of multiple basic perspec-
tives (e.g., Johnson et al., 2008; Kesting & Günzel-Jensen,
2015; Tikkanen, Lamberg, Parvinen, & Kallunki, 2005;
Wirtz, Schilke, & Ullrich, 2010; Zott & Amit, 2010; Wells,
2016).
These broad definitions and approaches are sometimes
detailed through the identification of the components of the
business model. Indeed, after the definition phase, listing and
describing business model elements (or components or
unique building blocks or constitute attributes) are the next
logical steps in the evolution of the business model concept
(Osterwalder et al., 2005). In fact, definitions of a business
model quite often focus on structural aspects regarding its
contents (e.g., Johnson et al., 2008; Tikkanen et al., 2005;
Voelpel et al., 2005).
Regarding the content-related structural aspects of a busi-
ness model, extant literature indicates a separate develop-
ment and expansion of business model elements within these
two distinctive phases of listing and describing. For instance,
Morris et al. (2005) analyzed key words in definitions and
found 24 different items that are mentioned as possible ele-
ments, with 15 receiving multiple mentions. At the same
time, Shaffer et al. (2005) and Osterwalder et al. (2005)
found more than 40 different items each. Recently, academ-
ics have been continually trying to gather and analyze the
up-to-date state of the research (Nenonen & Storbacka, 2010;
Onetti et al., 2012; Wirtz et al., 2016; Zott et al., 2011, to list
only a few) and proposing their own theoretical conceptual-
izations on what constitutes a business model (see Table 2).
The review in Table 2 indicates that most authors distin-
guish between first- and second-order themes within the
structure of a business model. Many elements overlap and/or
have very similar names. Also, they have been alternately
classified into both categories. Hence, there are numerous
differences in the definitions of elements implying the need
for clearer distinction.
Method
In this article, a comprehensive review and critical analysis
of previous research on business models and their elements
were conducted in February and March 2016 as a part of the
research design. In conducting the analysis, a multistep pro-
cess was used.
For the analysis to be scientifically traceable, this study
searched for articles that contain the term business model in
the title or keywords published in leading academic and
practitioner-oriented management journals (Academy of
Management Journal [AMJ], Academy of Management
Review [AMR], Academy of Management Perspectives
[AMP], Administrative Science Quarterly [ASQ], Journal of
Management [JOM], Journal of Management Studies [JMS],
Management Science [MS], MIS Quarterly, Organization
Science [OS], Strategic Management Journal [SMJ],
California Management Review [CMR], Harvard Business
Review [HBR], and MIT Sloan Management Review [MSM]).
This search revealed 277 articles on business models from
the early publishing dates to December 2015, of which only
21 had been published in academic journals, while 256 had
appeared in practitioner-oriented journals (i.e., CMR, HBR,
and MSM).
The research was further extended to the ABI/INFORM
database. Examining databases was confirmed as an appro-
priate method for exploring extant literature on business
models (DaSilva & Trkman, 2014; Ghaziani & Ventresca,
2005; Mäkinen & Seppänen, 2007; Wirtz et al., 2016; Zott
et al., 2011, etc.) while international coverage makes the
ABI/INFORM database one of the most complete sources on
business studies. The search was focused on academic arti-
cles containing the term business model in the title or abstract,
published in peer-reviewed scholarly journals in the English
language from January 1960 to December 2015. In total,
4,028 articles were obtained. As 16 of the newly found arti-
cles were already present in the initial sample of 277 articles,
our overall sample contained 4,289 articles.
As an initial cursory analysis of these 4,289 publications
revealed that many of the selected publications would not be
useful for further analysis, three additional criteria were
introduced to identify articles relevant for this study: (a) an
article must deal with the business model concept in a non-
trivial and nonmarginal way, (b) an article also must refer to
the business model as a concept related to business firms (as
Peric et al. 5
opposed to economic cycles or models, for example), and
(c) an article must directly refer to the constitute elements or
components of a business model. As a result, 102 articles fit
the suggested criteria. Through careful reading of these
publications, a few additional publications on business
models were found that appeared relevant for this review,
primarily books and working papers. The final sample,
therefore, contained 108 publications.

Frequency of appearance of business model elements was
searched within the selected publications. Special attention
was devoted to searching for business model elements that
are related to strategy and sustainability to analyze the rela-
tionship between business models, on one hand, and strategy
and sustainability, on the other.
Results
Domains Addressed in a Business Model
Across these 108 publications, 387 different business model
elements or unique building blocks are found. A brief review
of these adjacent literatures is presented in Table 3. It seems
that some of the elements are seen time and time again in the
definitions. For instance, four elements (value proposition,
customer, product, and resources) are mentioned in more
than 20 publications, and another 56 out of 387 elements are
mentioned at least 4 times. In addition, 16 elements are men-
tioned 3 times, 49 elements 2 times, and 262 elements are
mentioned only once.
Regardless of the large number of perspectives provided
when business model elements are concerned, something
consistently recognized was that definitions often included
those elements that comprise the concept of value. More pre-
cisely, value proposition is convincingly the most often men-
tioned element of a business model (in one third of analyzed
publications). However, many other elements also overlap
each other while referring to value proposition. For instance,
value, value offering, (customer) value proposition, or even
product or service all refer to value that is first proposed and
then delivered to a customer. In other words, value proposi-
tion is typically concerned with the product and service
offering, that is, the value embedded in the offerings of the
firm (see also Afuah & Tucci, 2003; Osterwalder et al., 2005;
Voelpel, Leibold, & Tekie, 2004).
Resource-based view (RBV) of the firm (e.g., see Amit &
Zott, 2001; Seppänen & Mäkinen, 2007; Morris et al., 2005;
Seppänen, 2009) also proved to be relevant for the business
model concept. Besides the term resources (found in one
fifth of publications), elements such as key resources, strate-
gic resources, assets, competencies, information, or even
technology or brand all indicate the tangible or intangible
substance of a firm and its business model. On the contrary,
Morris et al. (2005) argued that activity sets support each
element of a business model. Furthermore, Zott et al. (2011)
found that the received literature on business models mostly
supports an activity system perspective, that is, a set of inter-
dependent organizational activities centered on a focal firm.
Indeed, this research found that managerial, organizational,
manufacturing, marketing, and especially networking pro-
cesses are frequently mentioned within the business model
framework. As a link connecting a firm's infrastructure and
customers, these activities are required to create and deliver
the value proposition to the targeted customer.
The last domain addressed is about considering how the
company creates value for itself. Elements such as revenue
model or revenue stream, value capture, cost, price, and
profit formula (all these elements are mentioned at least 5
times in publications) reveal the financial aspect of a busi-
ness model. When considered in relation to other domains
and elements, a business model is a specific combination of
resources and transactions which generate value for both
customers and the organization.
Business Model Versus Strategy
Transformation of resources into valuable products and ser-
vices, and delivery of those to customers, occurs in a specific
strategic context. The previous review indicated that the
strategy literature stream has an essential influence on busi-
ness model development and that strategic elements are
mentioned very often in the context of business models.
Strategy or some other elements related to strategy like mis-
sion, competitors, organization, or structure have often been
incorporated in definitions (see again Casadesus-Masanell &
Ricart, 2010; Chesbrough & Rosenbloom, 2002; Shafer
et al., 2005; Smith, Binns, & Tushman, 2010; Voelpel et al.,
2005). This is also reflected in the various approaches used
when defining the main elements of a business model (see
Tables 2 and 3).
Many authors argue that strategy is essential when con-
sidering elements of a business model. For instance, Hamel
(2000) considered the core strategy as a central (first-order)
element of a business model. Also, a group of authors refer to
competitive strategy (Chesbrough, 2007; Chesbrough &
Rosenbloom, 2002; Kujala et al., 2010; Morris et al., 2005).
They all agree it must delineate how the firm will gain and
hold advantage over rivals. Richardson (2008) mostly agreed
but, from his point of view, basic strategy to win customers
and gain competitive advantage is a second-order theme and
belongs to value proposition. Shafer et al. (2005) argued that
strategy is all about making choices (regarding customers,
value proposition, pricing, competitors, branding, etc.), and
strategic choices are therefore considered as a separate ele-
ment of a business model. Voelpel et al. (2004) and Tikkanen
et al. (2005) see strategy as a second-order theme. According
to Voelpel et al. (2004), strategy, vision, mission, and objec-
tives are a part of a value network (re)configuration which
has to provide value for customers. Tikkanen et al. (2005)
explained that the business model of the firm is based on how
the material aspects of the business model interact with man-
agerial belief systems. Within material aspects, they find
strategic intent (long-term organizational commitment), the
strategy process managed by a firm's managers, and the con-
tent of strategy as part of the material aspects of a business
model.
On the contrary, there are authors who do not explicitly
embed the term strategy within the business model frame-
work. For some of them, Onetti et al. (2012) for instance, the

terms are more clearly explained when strategy is excluded
from the defining elements of the business model. Therefore,
Onetti et al. (2012) deliberately excluded concepts such as
mission and strategy (together with the components of value
proposition, competition, differentiation, customer target
market, and pricing) from the defining elements of the busi-
ness model.
According to Wirtz et al. (2016), such a lack of consensus
with regard to the area of strategy as a building block of busi-
ness model could be explained by the fact that some authors
usually integrate the implications of corporate strategy
through a strategy model within the business model. Indeed,
the literature points to the importance of business models for
a firm's strategy and definitions of a business model at a stra-
tegic level. However, a business model and a strategy are not
the same thing, and the two should not be confused. In fact,
literature tries to portray the business model as an indepen-
dent concept but related to a number of other established
managerial concepts such as strategy, organizational struc-
ture, or business planning (e.g., Casadesus-Masanell &
Ricart, 2010; DaSilva & Trkman, 2014).
In this respect, much has been discussed about differenti-
ating between business models and strategy (Casadesus-
Masanell & Ricart, 2010; Chesbrough & Rosenbloom, 2002;
DaSilva & Trkman, 2014; Klang et al., 2014; Magretta,
2002; Morris et al., 2005; Osterwalder et al., 2005;
Richardson, 2008; Teece, 2010; Tikkanen et al., 2005;
Wikström et al., 2010; Zott et al., 2011). For Chesbrough and
Rosenbloom (2002), the business model is "more of a proto-
strategy, an initial hypothesis for how to deliver value to the
customer . . ." (p. 550). It describes the organization's activi-
ties and how to create and deliver value to the customer but
does not consider competition as a critical dimension of per-
formance (Magretta, 2002). Hence, the business model is
focused on value proposition and emphasizes the role of the
customer (Zott et al., 2011). On the contrary, the strategy is
concerned more with value capturing and its sustainability
than with value creation (Chesbrough & Rosenbloom, 2002;
Mäkinen & Seppänen, 2007). This means strategy gives
meaning and direction on how the business model is utilized
8 SAGE Open
depending on contingencies that might occur in a competi-
tive environment (Casadesus-Masanell & Ricart, 2010;
Tikkanen et al., 2005), and in such a way, strategy stresses
the need for positioning (Magretta, 2002). Hence, strategy is
all about making choices while a business model reflects the
strategic choices that have been made and their operating
implications (Shafer et al., 2005). However, Casadesus-
Masanell and Ricart (2010) argued that strategy is not just
the mere selection of a business model (making some choices
and suffering the consequences of these choices) because
every organization has some business model, but not every
organization has a strategy. Some academics have even ques-
tioned whether it would be possible to have more than one
business model at the same time (Arend, 2013; Casadesus-
Masanell & Ricart, 2010; Hedman & Kalling, 2003; Kim &
Min, 2015; Malone et al., 2006; Markides & Charitou, 2004)
or to alter business models within one strategy (DaSilva &
Trkman, 2014).
Business Models and Sustainability
Another theme that is becoming more and more present
within the context of business models is sustainability.
Although sustainability is almost always seen in terms of
three dimensions that must be in harmony, namely, social,
economic, and environmental (Kates, Parris, & Leiserowitz,
2005; Strange & Bayley, 2008), when it comes to business
models, the harmony of these dimensions was not always the
case. At first, sustainability was mentioned only from an eco-
nomic perspective. Besides creating and delivering value,
the core of a business model was to create a sustainable com-
petitive advantage in defined markets (Morris et al., 2005)
and to generate profitable and sustainable revenue streams
that ensure the satisfaction of relevant stakeholders within a
firm (Brousseau & Penard, 2007; Osterwalder et al., 2005;
Voelpel et al., 2005). The focus was on how a firm can sus-
tain itself, that is, how to be self-sustainable on the basis of
the income it generates (DaSilva & Trkman, 2014; Shafer
et al., 2005; Teece, 2010). As previously mentioned, many
elements of a business model (e.g., revenue model, revenue
stream, value capture, profit formula) reflect this approach.
Objectives and interests of the environment and community,
as external stakeholders, were less relevant. For instance,
environment is considered as an element of business model
only twice (see Hoque, 2002; Nair, Paulose, Palacios, &
Tafur, 2013) and has the meaning of a turbulent and competi-
tive business setting that impacts firms' survival.
Meanwhile, the overall competitive landscape has
changed in favor of the environment and wider community.
In 2008, Stubbs and Cocklin (2008) discussed how sustain-
ability concepts (all three dimensions) should shape the driv-
ing force of the firm and its decision making. They coined
the term sustainability business model (SBM)--a model
where a firm treats sustainability as a business strategy in
itself, rather than as an add-on. For firms, sustainability is not
only the right thing to do but also the smart thing to do
(Stubbs & Cocklin, 2008) because becoming environment-
friendly lowers costs, creates new businesses, and generates
additional revenues from better products (Nidumolu,
Prahalad, & Rangaswami, 2009). In this way, sustainable
organizations need profits to exist (i.e., survive) and to
achieve sustainable outcomes but they do not just exist to
make a profit (Stubbs & Cocklin, 2008).
The concept of a SBM was well accepted by other aca-
demics and practitioners under slightly changed names--
sustainable business model or business model for
sustainability (BMfS; Abdelkafi & Täuscher, 2016; Bocken,
Rana, & Short, 2015; Bocken, Short, Rana, & Evans, 2013,
2014; Boons & Lüdeke-Freund, 2013; Boons, Montalvo,
Quist, & Wagner, 2013; Jabloski, 2016; Roome & Louche,
2016; Schaltegger et al., 2016; Schaltegger, Lüdeke-Freund,
& Hansen, 2012; Wells, 2016). However, all SBM or BMfS
understandings agree on the integration of a triple bottom
line approach and consider a wide range of stakeholder inter-
ests. SBM is based on the principles of balancing the busi-
ness from a number of perspectives, and it is a kind of holistic
and hybrid model (Jabloski, 2016). It generates therefore
shared value creation for all stakeholders--it captures eco-
nomic value for itself, while distributing value beyond its
organizational boundaries by maintaining or regenerating
natural, social, and economic capital (Bocken et al., 2015;
Bocken et al., 2014; Boons et al., 2013; Schaltegger et al.,
2016; Schaltegger et al., 2012).
Accordingly, designing sustainability-oriented business
models requires a long-term focus at both the organizational
and socioeconomic levels (Stubbs & Cocklin, 2008) and the
adoption of a systemic approach that seeks to integrate con-
siderations of the three dimensions of sustainability (Bocken
et al., 2015). Indeed, environment and community are
acknowledged as true stakeholders. When it comes to attrib-
uting to natural or ecological capital, Abdelkafi and Täuscher
(2016) discussed environmental value proposition, which
represents not the actual impact but the intended impact of a
business model on the environment, and how to integrate it
into a BMfS. When it comes to the community perspective,
Stubbs and Cocklin (2008) even mentioned community as a
subelement of a business model (together with customers,
employees, suppliers, and management). In addition, some
authors used the business model framework to explain how
to create social businesses able to enhance social welfare
(e.g., Seelos & Mair, 2005; Yunus, Moingeon, & Lehmann-
Ortega, 2010). According to Yunus et al. (2010), a social
business model defines the desired social profits through a
comprehensive ecosystem view. This will result in a social
profit equation (one constitute element of a social business
model) while an economic profit equation (another element)
targets only full recovery of cost and of capital, and not
financial profit maximization. Despite the growing impor-
tance of these issues (i.e., environment, environmental value
proposition, community, and social profit equation) in
Peric et al. 9
contemporary business, this research showed that they are
rarely mentioned as elements of a business model. An expla-
nation for this can be found in the core definition of the
SBM--sustainability (involving also environment and soci-
ety) is treated as a business strategy in itself and there is no
need for it to be asserted as separate elements.
Hence, the quest for sustainability forces companies to
change the way they think about products, technologies, pro-
cesses, and business models. Smart organizations now treat
sustainability as innovation's new frontier (Nidumolu et al.,
2009). Designing SBMs explicitly depicts how value is cre-
ated and appropriated by all involved. Thus, the creation and
further development of businesses toward sustainability is
challenged by the cocreation of societal and economic profits
(Boons & Lüdeke-Freund, 2013), leaving plenty of space for
further research.
Discussion and Conclusion
This overview has revealed that many practitioners and
scholars treat the business model as a promising concept. On
the contrary, the validity of the business model concept and
its long-term implications has been questioned over time.
This apparently popular concept receives intense criticism,
which is quite paradoxical (Klang et al., 2014). It was argued
that the business model is defined vaguely, that there is con-
fusion in terminology, and that the business model, as an
approach to management, becomes an invitation for faulty
thinking and self-delusion (Morris et al., 2005; Porter, 2001;
Zott et al., 2011). Several conclusions, which are to a large
extent coherent with these inferences, can be drawn from this
overview.
First, although more than half a century has passed since
the first appearance of the term business model in the litera-
ture, this overview shows that its popularity is a relatively
young phenomenon (see also Wirtz et al., 2016; Zott et al.,
2011). The business model concept began to be increasingly
used only during the 1990s, in parallel with the development
and intensive evolution of e-commerce. Since then, research
in business models has matured over the years, and numer-
ous definitions of business model and elements have
appeared. The e-business and technology stream dominated
the early stage of business model evolution, after which time
a more generic approach emerged, focused on the strategic
and operational dimensions of a firm and seeking to define
the concept as a more generalized representation of a firm.
The economic stream, emphasizing the logic of profit gen-
eration, is a constant throughout the whole period. This,
therefore, is in line with some of the previous arguments
(George & Bock, 2011; Morris et al., 2005; Onetti et al.,
2012; Wirtz et al., 2016; Zott et al., 2011) that the literature
on business models is fragmented and dispersed in several
streams with very loose boundaries between each other.
The heterogeneous nature of the extant literature gives
support to other two conclusions--there are no generally
accepted definitions for either the business model or its
building blocks. According to Shafer et al. (2005), the lack-
ing consensus on business model definition may be in part
attributed to interdisciplinary scholarly perspectives (e.g.,
technology, IS, strategy, organizational theory, etc.). Despite
the broadness and differences in definitions over the last two
or three decades, one thing the academics and practitioners
agree upon is that, when business models are concerned, it is
all about value (Abdelkafi et al., 2013; Amit & Zott, 2001;
Chesbrough & Rosenbloom, 2002; Osterwalder et al., 2005;
Santos, Spector, & Van der Heyden, 2009; Shafer et al.,
2005; Smith, Binns, & Tushman, 2010; Teece, 2010; Voelpel
et al., 2005; Wirtz et al., 2010). What can be read out as a
common theme in the authors'views is that a business model
is a conceptual tool and an abstract representation of a com-
pany's core logic that describes how it creates, delivers, and
captures value. To make this abstraction simpler, a business
model is often expounded through the identification of its
elements. The most frequently cited are a firm's value propo-
sition, customers, products (and services), resources, value
creation, value capture, revenues, technology, processes, and
partners. Still, there is no congruency--different items are
used for similar concepts and their meanings sometimes
overlap. What product or service is to one author, value prop-
osition is to another. Within a number of elements, it looks
like these elements are crucial when business models are
concerned, and that value (i.e., a firm's value proposition,
value creation, and value capture), as claimed by Johnson
et al. (2008) and Nenonen and Storbacka (2010), makes the
core of a business model.
Although consensus among the authors regarding the
dimensions of value as components of a business model
exists to some extent, there is little or no agreement with
regard to the area of strategy. This review implies that there
is both a relationship and distinction between business mod-
els and strategy. A strong relationship between business
models and strategy is manifested in two ways: Business
models are often defined from a strategic point of view while
strategic issues are pointed out as important business model
elements. Although there is a strong relationship between the
two, the next conclusion is that a business model and a strat-
egy are not the same thing. The majority of the extant litera-
ture portrays the business model as an independent concept
(Casadesus-Masanell & Ricart, 2010; DaSilva & Trkman,
2014; Magretta, 2002; Shafer et al., 2005), and a clear dis-
tinction should be made between strategy and business
model. When a business venture is concerned, strategy can
be understood more as a kind of guide (Wirtz et al., 2016).
On the contrary, business models include a number of strat-
egy elements but build more on the creation of value for cus-
tomers, and from a strategic view, the business model can be
a source of competitive advantage (Teece, 2010; Zott et al.,
2011). This implies that a business model is typically devel-
oped from a more narrow perspective than a strategy (see
Wikström et al., 2010). It seeks to integrate sustainable value
10 SAGE Open
creation with capturing and appropriation while emphasizing
the role of the customer which appears to be less pronounced
elsewhere in the strategy literature. In Addition, an organiza-
tion's business model framework is usually approached from
a short-term perspective as the reflection of its realized strat-
egy (see also Casadesus-Masanell & Ricart, 2010; Dahan,
Doh, Oetzel, & Yaziji, 2010), providing a link between strat-
egy and operations and between strategy formulation and
implementation. From this point of view, this conclusion is
in line with previous findings (e.g., Mäkinen & Seppänen,
2007; Richardson, 2008) that found that business models
facilitate operations, that is, the implementation of selected
strategy. Consequently, strategy reflects the long-term per-
spective, that is, what a company aims to become, while a
business model is a description of a state, that is, what a com-
pany really is at a given time (Dahan et al., 2010; DaSilva &
Trkman, 2014). For sure, business model and strategy are
more complements than substitutes.
Moreover, sustainability is found to be a hot topic for
business models. Besides economic sustainability (DaSilva
& Trkman, 2014; Shafer et al., 2005; Teece, 2010, etc.),
increased interest in research is devoted to the social and
environmental dimensions of sustainability. As a result, a
new stream of literature on sustainable business models has
emerged (Abdelkafi & Täuscher, 2016; Bocken et al., 2015;
Bocken et al., 2014; Boons et al., 2013; Roome & Louche,
2016; Schalteggeret al., 2012; Stubbs & Cocklin, 2008).
According to this approach, value is distributed to all stake-
holders, including those within a firm as well as those beyond
the firm's organizational boundaries.
To summarize, this article reviewed the relevant literature
on business models to try gain a better understanding of the
business model concept and its content-related structural
aspects. It looks like 20 years of intensive development were
not enough for academics to agree on what a business model
is and what its constitute elements are. Still, progress is evi-
dent in other fields. Particular attention was therefore dedi-
cated to the structural aspects of a business model and
interrelationship of business models, on one hand, and strat-
egy and sustainability, on the other. This article stipulates
that the business model has an important role in the imple-
mentation of a firm's strategy. Although its elements are
focused on value proposed to customers, the business model
has increasingly been used in symbiosis with the sustainabil-
ity concept.
The contribution of this article is twofold. From a concep-
tual viewpoint, more clarity is given to the definition of a
business model as an independent concept which has general
validity. This overview would therefore facilitate research
into the theoretical foundations of the business model. From
a practical viewpoint, this overview may be particularly
helpful to practitioners whose firms are seeking how to deal
with complex market challenges and gain competitive advan-
tage. Without a doubt, the design and management of busi-
ness models, especially within the sustainability context,
leaves gaps for further research. Cocreation of environmen-
tal, societal, and economic profits within and beyond the
boundaries of a business model is surely a challenge for both
practitioners and academics. In this regard, more work
regarding business model terminology may certainly provide
insights into making business models more efficient.
Despite the attempts to rigorously and objectively analyze
the selected literature on business models, this article comes
with several limitations. Besides strategy and sustainability,
business models have other, emerging common themes that
should be looked into. For instance, future overviews on busi-
ness models should seek to overcome this limitation by focus-
ing on business model types (see Kujala et al., 2010; McGrath,
2010;Wirtzetal.,2010),businessmodelinnovation(Cavalcante
et al., 2011; Mitchell & Coles, 2004; Zott et al., 2011), and the
impact of adopted business models on firm performance
(Cucculelli & Bettinelli, 2015; Markides & Sosa, 2013; Zott
et al., 2011). The research scope of future studies should also
focus on particular industries to build the theory and compare
the overall conclusions. More empirical findings (i.e., case stud-
ies) will help both practitioners and academics to put all the
pieces together and design competitive business models.
