Objectives. This study analyzed whether socioeconomic status in older middle age continues to be associated with
10-year survival after data are controlled for baseline health status.
Methods. We confirmed deaths through 2002 for 9,759 participants in the Health and Retirement Study, aged 51 to
61 in 1992. We used discrete time survival models to examine hazard ratios over 10 years of follow-up. We examined
associations of demographic characteristics and socioeconomic status measures before and after adjustment by health
status and behavioral risk factors.
Results. The 10-year mortality rate was 10.9%, ranging from 4.7% for respondents reporting excellent health to 35.8%
for those reporting poor health at baseline. Lower levels of education, income, and wealth were strongly associated with
higher mortality risk after we controlled for just demographic characteristics. After further adjustment for health status and
behavioral risk factors, only household income remained significant.
Discussion. Baseline health by age 50 is an important pathway in the association between midlife socioeconomic status
and mortality risk to age 70. The continuing effect of low household income on mortality risk was concentrated among
respondents reporting excellent to good health at baseline. Socioeconomic disparities in middle-age health continue to
limit disability-free life expectancy at older ages.
OLDER Americans are living longer, more disability-free
lives. Americans aged 45 and older have accounted for
two thirds of the overall increase in U.S. life expectancy since
1960 (Cutler & Meara, 2001). However, it is well known that
the benefits of the compression of morbidity and increased life
expectancy in America are very unevenly distributed by social
class. Especially among older Americans, the gradient of health
status and survival outcomes across educational, occupational,
income, and wealth inequalities may explain much of the more
highly publicized racial disparities in health. Despite overall
improvement, socioeconomic inequalities in disability-free life
expectancy in the United States have widened over the past 20
years (Schoeni, Martin, Andreski, & Freedman, 2005; Singh &
Siahpush, 2006).
In interpreting these trends, social epidemiologists have
begun to construct what Alwin and Wray described as a life-
span developmental perspective on the relationship of socio-
economic status (SES) to health (Alwin & Wray, 2005). This
approach emphasizes the particular timing across the life span
of economic, social, and psychological exposure pathways,
related to social status, that affect population health and
mortality across generations. Within just the past few years, this
theoretical framework has produced a wave of studies
documenting the enduring effects of early life social status on
adult health and life expectancy. This literature has ranged from
the effects of parental social class and birth weight, to early
childhood exposures, to cognitive or physical deprivation
(Barker, Osmond, Forsen, Kajantie, & Eriksson, 2005; Batty,
Der, Macintyre, & Deary, 2006; Galobardes, Lynch, & Davey
Smith, 2004; Krieger, Chen, Coull, & Selby, 2005; Luo &
Waite, 2005; O'Rand & Hamil-Luker, 2005; Pollitt, Rose, &
Kaufman, 2005). Researchers now know that by young adult-
hood, there are already very substantial SES differences in both
traditional cardiovascular disease risk and inflammatory bio-
markers (Banks, Marmot, Oldfield, & Smith, 2006; Koster
et al., 2006; Krieger, Chen, Coull, et al., 2005; Yan, Liu, et al.,
2006).
However, the specific effects of SES in later life on older age
health and mortality remain controversial (Hoffman, 2005).
This is, in part, because none of the landmark cohort studies
that originally documented the association of SES with mor-
tality among older Americans included or controlled for base-
line health in midlife. Most commonly, these studies relied
exclusively on educational attainment as a marker for social
status or, more rarely, household income or wealth. Midlife
SES measures were then associated with mortality over highly
variable follow-up periods (Backlund, Sorlie, & Johnson, 1999;
Bond Huie, Krueger, Rogers, & Hummer, 2003; Daly, Duncan,
McDonough, & Williams, 2002; Liao, McGee, Kaufman,
Cao, & Cooper, 1999; Pappas, Queen, Hadden, & Fisher, 1993;
Sorlie, Backlund, & Keller, 1995; Wong, Shapiro, Boscardin, &
Ettner, 2002). However, none of these studies included detailed

measures of midlife health and were thus unable to directly
assess the potential confounding of SES with health at midlife
cohort inception. As a result, this literature captured the entire
cumulative effect of social status on mortality occurring across
the entire life course, including long before baseline SES data
were collected.
Researchers' new understanding of the health effects of
childhood social status, as well as the growing awareness of the
importance of early-life subclinical disease progression, have
raised questions about the extent to which traditional midlife
SES measures indeed remain independent predictors of mor-
tality after data are controlled for health conditions already
embodied by age 50 (Krieger, 2005). It may be that social and
economic inequalities have already taken their toll by older mid-
dle age. Health status may already be so well established across
the socioeconomic gradient by middle age, and poor health
already so confounded with low SES, that individuals' social
position matters little by older middle age (J. P. Smith, 1998).
From a life-span developmental perspective, another major
weakness of the historic literature on midlife SES and mortality
is that by middle age, factors such as education, income, and
wealth may operate very differently for individuals already at
different levels of baseline health. Educational disparities have
often been the sole measure of SES in mortality studies,
especially after education was included in U.S. death certificate
data. However, education effects on health can operate through
many facets of cumulative economic opportunity, for example,
exposure to occupational risk factors or the availability of
health insurance and preventive care from secure employment.
Educational differences in social networks, community influ-
ences, individual self-efficacy, and other protective psycho-
social attributes are also closely linked to the prevalence of
behavioral risk factors over many years of adulthood (Wray,
Alwin, & McCammon, 2005).
Data from the Americans' Changing Lives Study and other
studies have indicated that although education is strongly
associated with the onset of functional disability, only income
remains associated with progression of functional impairment
at older ages (House, Lantz, & Herd, 2005; Zimmer & House,
2003). Researchers have very rarely studied health disparities
related to the distribution of household wealth, but have found
them to be strongly associated with mortality (Bond Huie et al.,
2003; Daly et al., 2002). By older middle age, when the
incidence of symptomatic chronic conditions increases dramat-
ically, persons with higher levels of income and wealth may be
more successful at self-management and engaging social
support, have better access to higher quality medical care,
and have a more comfortable retirement lifestyle, all of which
may serve to limit disease progression (Goldman & Smith,
2002; Pincus, Esther, DeWalt, & Callahan, 1998). However,
even this apparent association of older middle-age SES with
mortality has yet to be tested when controlling for baseline
health status.
The present study describes all-cause mortality over
a 10-year follow-up period, using data from 9,759 participants
in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), aged 51 to 61 in
1992, with mortality follow-up across five biannual survey
waves through 2002. Findings from discrete time survival
models address the question of the relative association of
all-cause mortality risk with individuals' years of school
completed, household income, and net assets (wealth) after
the data were controlled for respondents' demographic
characteristics. We then tested these associations after further
controlling for baseline health status and behavioral risk factors.
The results provide insight into the extent to which the well-
known association of SES with mortality is primarily due to
earlier life effects on health status and behaviors versus
ongoing exposure to economic and social inequality during
older middle age itself.
METHODS
Data Source
The HRS, a nationally representative, longitudinal sample of
U.S. households, uses a multistage area probability design. The
study population consists of noninstitutionalized adults living
in the contiguous United States, aged 51 to 61 in 1992. We
based the data used here on face-to-face interviews conducted
with the 9,759 participants in 1992 with biannual telephone
follow-up over 5 consecutive waves. Mortality was determined
through matching to the National Death Index or from
information from household members through 2002. HRS
tracking studies have indicated a 98.8% validation of deaths
with essentially zero false positives. HRS data are publicly
available and can be found at http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/.
The Northwestern University Institutional Review Board ruled
the study exempt.
SES Measures
We fixed years of school completed as reported in 1992 and
grouped education levels as 0 to 8 years, 9 to 11 years, high
school graduate (or General Equivalency Diploma), and more
than 12 years. We analyzed time-varying values for household
income and household wealth measures using data from each
of four (1992­2000) biannual waves of the HRS to predict
survival through 2002. We computed an income-to-needs ratio
(INR) in 1992 by dividing household income by the 1991
poverty guideline for a given household size; we categorized
INR levels as less than or equal to 1.9, 2 to 2.9, 3 to 4.9, and
greater than or equal to 5.0 at each wave. We imputed missing
data for survivors by forward replacement of INR level. RAND
investigators calculated household wealth, which represented
the net value of all assets (including primary residence, other
real estate, businesses, individual retirement accounts and
Keogh accounts, stocks and bonds, pensions, and checking
and savings accounts) minus debts (St. Clair et al., 2006). We
divided wealth into three categories: less than 20th percentile
(from , $15,000 in 1992 to , $23,500 in 2002), 20th to
60th percentile (from $15,000­$126,000 in 1992 to $23,500­
$177,000 in 2002), and 60th to 100th percentile (from
. $126,000 including the top 20th percentile to . $260,000
in 1992, to . $177,000 including the top 20th percentile at
. $399,800 in 2002).
Education, income, and wealth were only weakly correlated
with one another at 1992 categorical levels; the highest cor-
relation was between levels of household income and house-
hold wealth (r ¼ .46). This relative lack of correlation
reinforced the importance of analyzing separate SES effects
during older middle age (Braveman et al., 2005).

Health Status Measures
All health status measures were time-varying values with
forward imputation of missing data for survivors through 2000.
Self-reported overall health was measured in five categories:
excellent, very good, good, fair, and poor. The number of
chronic conditions included self-reported hypertension, dia-
betes, heart disease, chronic lung disease, cancer, arthritis,
stroke, or visual difficulties and ranged from 0 to 8. We em-
pirically merged the small group of respondents reporting four
or more chronic conditions into a single highest severity
category. Physical impairment was measured by difficulties in
climbing stairs and walking various distances; pushing, pulling,
and stretching; and performing activities of daily living such as
bathing, eating, and dressing, without help. We summed each
item rated as a physical impairment or difficulty across nine
HRS questions, with a maximum score of 9 difficulties
(Feinglass et al., 2005). We empirically grouped the small
number of respondents with five or more difficulties into
a single high disability category.
Sample Demographic Characteristics
We categorized age as 51 to 55, or 56 to 61 in 1992. Marital
status categories included married, divorced or separated,
widowed, or never married. Race and ethnicity were catego-
rized as White, Black, English-speaking Hispanic, or Spanish-
speaking Hispanic, due to well-known differences in health and
access to health care between these groups. We dichotomized
parents' mean age at death by whether respondents' parents'
average age at death was 75 years or older, versus younger than
75 or still alive in 1992 (Hoffman, 2005). Findings from
separate models for men and women indicated that the only
significant difference was higher male mortality for persons
who were separated or divorced, and higher female mortality
among those who were widowed at baseline. All data presented
here therefore combined male and female respondents while
controlling for gender as an indicator variable.
Health Insurance
Previous HRS studies have shown that lack of health
insurance is associated with forgone preventive services and
major declines in health and mortality (Ayanian, Weissman,
Schneider, Ginsburg, & Zaslavsky, 2000; Baker, Sudano, Albert,
Borawski, & Dor, 2001; Baker et al., 2006; McWilliams,
Zaslavsky, Meara, & Ayanian, 2004). However, because in-
surance status is so confounded by baseline health and SES
in this cohort, we did not include it in the mortality models
presented below. Large numbers of HRS respondents gained
and lost health insurance coverage over the 10-year follow-up
period. This volume of insurance status transitions, particularly
among the previously uninsured who became disabled and
transitioned to public insurance before death, represented
a formidable methodological challenge beyond the scope of
this investigation.
Behavioral Risk Factors
Behavioral risk factors were both correlated with SES and, in
the cases of sedentary activity or being underweight, linked to
health status. Smoking status in 1992 was categorized as never
smoked, previous smoker, or current smoker. Body mass index
was calculated by weight in kilograms divided by height in
meters squared, within four categories: underweight (, 18.5
kg/m2), normal weight (18.5­24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25.0­
29.9 kg/m2), and obese (. 30 kg/m2). We calculated physical
activity level in 1992 from several questions about weekly or
monthly light and vigorous leisure time exercise and heavy
housework, including ``walking, dancing, gardening, golfing, or
bowling.'' Vigorous exercise included ``aerobics, running, swim-
ming, or bicycling.'' We scaled these items using previously
published methods (Feinglass et al., 2005) to approximate the
Surgeon General report categories of met recommendations
( 30 min/day of moderate activity on  5 days/week or  20
min of vigorous activity on  3 days/week), insufficient (less
than recommended but some physical activity), and inactive
(engaged in leisure time physical activity fewer than three times
per month). We found that measures of alcohol consumption
and dependence were not associated with mortality risk in
multivariate models and therefore do not include them here.
Statistical Analysis and Discrete Interval
Survival Models
We analyzed data using the Stata 9.0 (StataCorp, College
Station, TX) complex survey design module. We performed
bivariate analyses of 10-year survivors versus decedents by risk
factor (Table 1) using chi0square tests with person-level
analytic weights. Because HRS mortality data are publicly
reported only by biannual survey waves, we used survival anal-
ysis for discrete data, an analog of the Cox proportional hazard
model for continuous data (Prentice & Gloeckler, 1978). These
analyses model the discrete hazard rate, which is the probability
of dying in each subsequent wave given a person's risk factor
profile at the previous interview. We estimated a discrete
hazards model, which accounts for repeated measures on the
same individual and does not require a proportional hazard
assumption, using SAS Proc GenMod (SAS Institute, Carey,
NC) to fit a generalized linear model with a complementary
log log link. To account for the complex sampling design, we
estimated variance using balanced repeated replication, a form
of bootstrapping (Korn, 1999). We report results as hazard
ratios with 95% confidence intervals.
We present three sequential analyses to estimate the separate
and joint associations of baseline health and SES measures with
the likelihood of death through 2002. We estimated an initial
model to measure the association of SES measures and demo-
graphic factors only, beginning with education, and adding
income and then wealth (Model 1). Results from this model
approximated the many previously published studies of cumu-
lative SES effects on mortality that did not control for baseline
health. We then estimated a second model (Model 2) for de-
mographic characteristics, health status, and SES measures
combined, testing whether SES factors remained significant after
inclusion of time-varying baseline health measures. Finally,
a third model (Model 3) added behavioral risk factors to assess
any further effects on the significance of SES measures.

8.9% rate for women. Biannual death rates grew from approx-
imately 1.5% in 1992/1994 to 2.8% by 2000/2002. Table 1
provides bivariate associations of 1992 demographic, SES,
baseline health, and behavioral measures with cumulative
10-year mortality. There were statistically significant differ-
ences in 10-year death rates for all measures.
Higher mortality was associated with older age, male gender,
not being currently married at baseline, and having parents
whose average age at death was less than 75 years old.
Although Blacks had higher 10-year mortality (17.6%) than
Whites, Spanish-speaking Hispanics had the lowest mortality,
followed by English-speaking Hispanics, another demonstra-
tion of the Hispanic paradox (Palloni & Arias, 2004). Bivariate
differences in mortality are graded across all SES and baseline
health comparisons in Table 1 with differences significant at
the p , .0001 level. Higher mortality was also associated with
being a current smoker, being underweight (often related to
illness), and being physically inactive (which also may have
been a proxy for baseline health). Respondents who reported
being overweight or obese had better 10-year mortality than
normal-weight respondents.
Model 1 Results for SES Measures
The final three columns of Table 1 present discrete time
survival model results, beginning with demographic and SES
measures in Model 1. Older age; male gender; being separated,
divorced, or widowed; and having parents who died at less than
75 years old were all significantly associated with mortality.
Hispanics had significantly lower mortality than Whites, and
Black respondents no longer had significantly higher mortality
than Whites after adjustment for SES. Lower levels of
educational attainment, although initially significantly associ-
ated with higher mortality risk, became nonsignificant when
first income and then wealth were entered into sequential
models (data not shown). Individuals of lower income levels all
had significantly higher mortality with hazard ratios only
modestly attenuated when wealth was included, and respon-
dents from lower wealth households also had a higher mortality
risk net of income.
Model 2 and Model 3 Results for SES,
Health Status, and Behavioral Risk Factors
Model 2 in Table 1 presents results after including baseline
health with SES measures in the same model. Education and
wealth became nonsignificant, and only the lowest two income
categories remained significantly different after inclusion of
health status measures. As expected, time-varying self-reported
overall health proved to be a dynamic evaluation, with
respondents reporting poor health almost 6 times as likely to
subsequently die as those reporting excellent health. As
compared to those with zero chronic conditions or functional
difficulties, having two or more conditions or impairments was
associated with progressively greater mortality risk.
These results suggest the extent to which baseline health and
SES were already confounded at cohort inception in 1992.
More than 40% of respondents in the lowest INR and education
categories reported fair or poor health, more than double the
overall rate. Not only did individuals reporting excellent health
at baseline have the lowest 10-year mortality (4.7%), but the
vast majority (58.2%) of those in excellent health also lived in
the highest INR households. Respondents in poor health in
1992, who had the worst 10-year mortality rate (35.8%),
provided a stark contrast. More than half of this high-risk group
were from the lowest INR households. The primary influence of
baseline health was illustrated by the fact that respondents in
fair to poor health in 1992 were at least twice as likely to die as
respondents in good, very good, or excellent health across all
SES strata.
Model 3 added 1992 smoking, body mass index, and physical
activity measures. Respondents who were inactive, smoked, or
were underweight were at significantly higher risk. Although
there was only very modest change in the effects of baseline

health variables, addition of behavioral risk factors further
attenuated the effects of being separated or divorced, widowed,
and English-speaking Hispanic to nonsignificance. Hazard ratios
for income levels changed little between Models 2 and 3.
DISCUSSION
Our primary question was whether SES measures continued
to be associated with mortality after data were controlled for
baseline health status, given that middle-age health is such
a powerful predictor of life expectancy. As confirmed by the
results presented here, baseline health in older middle age
mediates much of the relationship between SES and mortality
to about age 70. After the inclusion of both baseline health and
behavioral risk factors, SES measures like education and wealth
were no longer significantly associated with mortality risk.
However, household income, although attenuated, remained
significant.
Decreasing Health Inequalities in Older Age?
These findings are relevant to the debate about the apparent
reduction of SES differences in health at older ages. There
has been relatively little empirical support for the selective
mortality hypothesis, which asserts that lower SES individuals
die earlier, thus survivors from lower SES backgrounds are com-
paratively healthier in older age (Beckett, 2000). However, re-
searchers have suggested that more equal access to health care,
given near-universal Medicare coverage, and the importance of
Social Security income in eliminating poverty among the elderly
population, may have reduced health disparities among more
recent cohorts of older Americans (House et al., 2005).
In one of the only attempts to directly address the con-
founding of SES measures with baseline health in the older
American population, Hoffmann (2005) analyzed 8-year all-
cause mortality for White adults aged 59 to 107 belonging to
a merged cohort from the HRS and the Study of Asset and
Health Dynamics. Interaction effects in this study indicated that
once individuals were in poor health, there were few sub-
sequent SES differences in older age mortality, and that SES
factors primarily influenced mortality rates for older adults in
excellent to good health at baseline. Post hoc analyses of our
data (not shown) confirmed Hoffman's analysis: The lowest
levels of household income were only significantly associated
with mortality for respondents reporting excellent to good
health at baseline. As health status generally deteriorates with
age, social disparities in mortality appear to converge. Thus, the
weakened association between some SES measures (particu-
larly education) and mortality after age 65 may be related to the
overwhelming influence of the increasing proportion of all
individuals in poor baseline health, with transitions from
serious chronic illness to death being more biologically than
socially driven at older ages.
Association of Education, Household Income, and
Wealth With Mortality Risk
Education, or years of school completed, is probably the
most frequently used SES measure in analyses of social
determinants of health in the United States. Schooling can
translate into quality of job opportunities and income, fewer
risky behaviors, and availability of social support and high-
quality medical care. This is what Ross and Wu (1996) termed
education's cumulative advantage, which they found tends to
increase health disparities with age. Cognitive ability, or intel-
ligence test score measures, are also closely bound up with
childhood educational experience. Childhood learning disabil-
ities (Noble & McCandliss, 2005) and low health literacy
(Baker et al., 2002) appear to have substantial independent
effects on older age health and mortality (Batty & Deary, 2004).
This has led some to call for using education as a cardiovascular
risk factor equal to the widely utilized traditional clinical mea-
sures (Fiscella & Franks, 2004).
In this study, years of school completed had a clear mono-
tonic relationship with mortality risk, even after the inclusion
of income and wealth (Model 4). However, education failed
to predict mortality at all after the data were controlled for
baseline health. This is not unexpected (Davey Smith, Hart,
et al., 1998). With few exceptions (Winkleby, Jatulis, Frank, &
Fortmann, 1992), studies that have reported significant
mortality differences by educational level failed to include
other SES covariates (Elo & Preston, 1996; Liao et al., 1999;
Pappas et al., 1993; Sorlie et al., 1995; Steenland, Henley, &
Thun, 2002; Wong et al., 2002). Among those studies that did
use multivariable economic and social measures, almost all
found that after adjustment, education is only weakly or
nonsignificantly associated with later life mortality (Daly et al.,
2002; Davey Smith, Hart, et al., 1998; Lantz et al., 1998). The
findings presented here confirm those from the Americans'
Changing Lives Study and other studies that education
influences the onset, but not the progression, of chronic
conditions (House et al., 2005). These findings run counter to
widely held beliefs about the superior importance of education
over race and income in predicting adult health and life
expectancy (Kolata, 2007). Finally, an important additional
problem for evaluating educational attainment is that schooling
quality varies so greatly across the United States and across
generations that it may be a poor proxy for directly measured
adult health literacy (Baker et al., 2002).
Household income at the individual or community level also
has a well-known association with Americans' health and life
expectancy (Davey Smith, Neaton, Wentworth, Stamler, &
Stamler, 1998; Krieger, Chen, Waterman, Rehkopf, &
Subramanian, 2005; Shishehbor, Litaker, Pothier, & Lauer,
2006). However, several important caveats remain when
considering how income may directly affect health and
mortality. Among the older middle-aged adults in the HRS,
employment status is closely tied to household income. Of the
68.4% of respondents who reported being employed in 1992,
half were in the highest INR category and only 10% in the
lowest. By contrast, more than one third of those respondents
who reported being unemployed due to disability or just being
unemployed were in the lowest INR category. Employment or
retirement status is obviously related to chronic health problems
for many. Thus, some of the continuing effect of household
income in our models undoubtedly represents reverse con-
founding with conditions acquired earlier in life that caused
premature disability, unemployment, or retirement.
As indicated by the changing associations of car ownership
and employment status with postretirement mortality in the
Whitehall Study (Marmot & Shipley, 1996), it is likely that
higher household wealth becomes increasingly protective
FEINGLASS ET AL.
S214
relative to employment income and occupational status as
retirement (including early retirement) becomes common for
this age group. The association of household wealth with
10-year mortality in the HRS was initially very significant,
reflecting a crude death rate of 19.4% for those with less than
the 20th percentile of net assets as compared to 7.3% for those
above the 60% percentile of wealth. This association was
greatly reduced by the inclusion of baseline health in Model
2 and, unlike income, much further reduced with the inclusion
of behavioral risk factors in Model 3. This latter finding may
be related to the large baseline differences between lowest
and highest wealth category respondents in current smoking
(42% vs 19%, respectively) and physical inactivity (33% vs
22%, respectively).
Behavioral Risk Factors and the Association of
SES With Mortality
Our findings replicate U.S. (Lantz et al., 1998) and British
studies (Marmot, 2006) in demonstrating that SES differences
in mortality remain independent of the distribution of
behavioral risks; inclusion of these factors had little effect on
SES mortality risk ratios. However, it is important to note that
smoking and physical activity are strongly patterned across the
SES gradient and are thus really an integral part of SES
disparities in health (Barbeau, Krieger, & Soobader, 2004;
Richardson, Kriska, Lantz, & Hayward, 2004). Nevertheless, it
is striking that smoking and leisure time physical activity risks
had little effect on the association of household income and
mortality.
An anomalous, but not unprecedented (Lantz et al., 1998),
finding was that respondents who were overweight and obese at
baseline did not have an elevated relative risk of mortality.
Subanalysis (results not shown) of the obese subgroup revealed
that these individuals were significantly more likely to be
younger (less than 56 years old) and less likely to be current
smokers, both of which confer a mortality advantage. The
results of a recent National Health Interview Survey follow-up
study of individuals aged 18 to 64 years old showed that the
body mass index associated with the lowest mortality is actually
around 26 or 27 (which would have traditionally been
considered overweight) for both sexes combined, and that
only beyond a body mass index of 27 does mortality start to
increase appreciably (Gronniger, 2006). It would be surprising,
however, if the effects of obesity did not have an independent
effect on mortality rates above and beyond prevalence of
specific chronic conditions over a longer follow-up period
(Yan, Daviglus, et al., 2006).
Limitations
Perhaps the most important limitation to these findings is that
the HRS provides no estimates for traditional clinical mortality
risk factors such as blood pressure and cholesterol. This may
have led to underestimation of the true effects of unreported
conditions. Other research has indicated that traditional clinical
risk factors add little prognostic power once populations are
stratified by SES characteristics, but this remains to be studied
(Brindle et al., 2005; Fiscella & Franks, 2004; G. D. Smith,
Shipley, & Rose, 1990). Our models also could not separately
analyze the effects of other potentially significant measures of
SES, such as childhood SES, occupational job strain, or
environmental health exposures. We did not directly examine
the potentially large number of interactions between the SES
and baseline health variables. Although important to flesh out
and clarify the data presented here, this investigation was far
too great in scope to present here. Finally, the HRS does not
include institutionalized persons, which may have slightly
biased the results.
Future Epidemiologic Surveillance of SES Disparities
Uncertainty about concurrent versus historical effects of
economic and social inequality is inevitable given major
demographic shifts as a new generation of Americans ages.
Such changes include the huge historical increase in college
education of both men and women entering older middle age,
large shifts in the American workforce, changes in diet and
exercise patterns, and the notable increases in life expectancy
for the oldest old Americans. These changes alone make it
difficult to extrapolate to contemporary American society
findings from older cohort studies of social determinants of
health. Although expensive to field, additional population-
based, prospective longitudinal studies with more sophisticated
SES indicators are essential to public health surveillance in an
era of increasing social and economic inequality.
