Article
Regular exercise or structured exercise interventions have
been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization and early
mortality, and lead to improved physical function in frail
older adults (Courtney et al., 2009; Landi et al., 2010). There
is evidence that such interventions may also reverse the pro-
gression of frailty to a degree (Binder et al., 2008). However,
the implementation of these programs is difficult as regular
involvement in exercise or physical activity decreases with
age (Schoenborn, Adams, Barnes, Vickerie, & Schiller,
2004), and long-term adherence to exercise interventions is
poor in spite of the associated benefits (Bestall et al., 2003).
Social support, self-efficacy beliefs, and outcome expec-
tations have been identified as influencing exercise in non-
frail, community-dwelling older adults (Baert, Gorus, Mets,
Geerts, & Bautmans, 2011; de Groot & Fagerstrom, 2011;
Mathews et al., 2010; Warner, Ziegelmann, Schuz, Wurm, &
Schwarzer, 2011). Other factors include health status, beliefs
regarding exercise (Baert et al., 2011; Mathews et al., 2010),
exercise history (Hirvensalo, Lintunen, & Rantanen, 2008;
Kozakai, Ando, Kim, Rantanen, & Shimokata, 2012), and
cultural beliefs (Leavy & Aberg, 2010; Mathews et al.,
2010). Social support and self-efficacy are two of the princi-
pal determinants to exercise cited by community-dwelling
older adults (de Groot & Fagerstrom, 2011; Mathews et al.,
2010; Warner et al., 2011). Older adults who do not receive
adequate social support are less likely to exercise and as a
consequence have a higher risk of mortality (Bailey &
McLaren, 2005; Strine, Chapman, Balluz, & Mokdad, 2008).
Social support may be derived from a number of sources
including family, friends, peers, or health professionals
(Resnick, Orwig, Magaziner, & Wynne, 2002). Family and
friend-based support increases the likelihood of regular par-
ticipation in exercise (Umstattd, Saunders, Wilcox, Valois, &
Dowda, 2006). However, in group exercise interventions,
peer support may have a higher influence on continued par-
ticipation than family support alone (Stevens, Lemmink, van
Heuvelen, de Jong, & Rispens, 2003). Warner et al. (2011)
found that high self-efficacy and the support of friends had a
significant impact on the likelihood of changing exercise
behavior in older adults with multiple co-morbidities. Social
support offered from friends may have a more substantial
influence on exercise behavior than family support (Resnick
et al., 2002). In addition, Giles, Glonek, Luszcz, andAndrews
(2005) reported that social networks based on friends had a

Perceptions, Expectations, and Informal
Supports Influence Exercise Activity in
Frail Older Adults

Abstract
This study aims to explore frail older adults' perceptions of what influences their exercise behaviors. A qualitative descriptive
design was used. Semi-structured, open-ended interviews were conducted with 29 frail older adults. Thematic content
analysis established the findings. Frail older adults perceive exercise as a by-product of other purposeful activities such as
manual work or social activities. Progression into frailty appears to be associated with a decline in non-family support, changing
traditional roles within family support networks, and lower baseline activity levels. Frail older adults perceive exercise as
incidental to more purposeful activities rather than an endpoint in itself. Therefore, exercise programs concentrating on
functional outcomes may be more relevant for this population. Strategies that educate and promote social support networks
may also benefit frail older adults.

significant effect on survival of older adults over a 10-year
period as opposed to social networks based on family mem-
bers. Hence, social support networks based on friends appear
to be more important in promoting exercise in older adults
than family supports alone.
Self-efficacy and outcome expectations are both compo-
nents of Social Cognitive Theory (Courtney et al., 2009;
Hall, Wójcicki, Phillips, & McAuley, 2012). Self-efficacy
refers to one's belief in one's ability to successfully carry out
a specific behavior (Bandura, 1997). It has been identified as
an important factor in motivating older adults to exercise
(Schutzer & Graves, 2004). Outcome expectations refer to
one's belief that a planned goal will be achieved from com-
pleting a personal action (Hall et al., 2012). The relationship
between outcome expectations and self-efficacy has not been
consistently agreed on (Bandura, 1997; Williams, 2010) and
outcome expectations have been relatively unexplored in the
literature (Hall et al., 2012). However, it has been argued that
self-efficacy and outcome expectations are closely linked as
both impact initiation and participation in exercise interven-
tions (Resnick et al., 2007). Hence, outcome expectations
may also serve as an indication of exercise behavior and the
likelihood of changing that behavior toward positive
outcomes.
However, these studies have not specifically targeted frail
older adults, instead investigating a non-specific older
cohort, or focusing on the "oldest old." This article therefore
aims to explore what influences frail, community-dwelling
older adults to exercise.
Method
A qualitative descriptive design was used for this study.
Qualitative research is informed by interpretivism, which
seeks to explore how people understand and experience
social phenomena (Carpenter & Suto, 2008). When employ-
ing this approach, the researcher must seek to explore the
meaning attributed to phenomena by the participants and
themselves (Ritchie & Lewis, 2003). This approach was cho-
sen to allow the author to explore the participants' attitudes
and beliefs regarding exercise to gain an understanding of
what influenced their exercise behaviors.
Sample Recruitment
This study was nested in a larger control trial (CT) examin-
ing the effects of an exercise intervention on frail older adults
in the acute setting conducted from July to September 2011
(McCullagh et al., 2012). Consecutive sampling was
employed to recruit all participants admitted to the CT.
Inclusion criteria consisted of frail or pre-frail older adults
under terms described by McCullagh et al. (2014). Exclusion
criteria included early discharge, defined as within 3 days or
less of admission, and transfer to palliative care services.
Early discharge was an exclusion criterion to ensure
participants had been screened as frail or pre-frail before the
interviews were conducted. Cognitive impairment was not
an exclusion criterion as those with cognitive impairment are
still able to provide us with their insights and perceptions of
exercise. Thus, it can be argued that excluding those indi-
viduals on the basis of impairment alone is unethical
(Hellström, Nolan, Nordenfelt, & Lundh, 2007). However,
one eligible participant was excluded as her level of impair-
ment rendered her unable to effectively communicate at the
time of recruitment. Ethical approval was granted by the
regional clinical research ethics committee. Verbal consent
was requested. In addition, consent was viewed as a process
whereby attention was given to any verbal or non-verbal
indications during data collection that a participant seemed
unwilling to take part in the interview.
Out of a potential 40 participants recruited to the CT, 29
were interviewed. Those not interviewed were discharged at
weekends or at short notice such that the interview could not
take place prior to discharge home from hospital. None
refused to participate. Fifty-five percent of those interviewed
were women. The median age was 78 years with a range of
65 to 87 years.
Data Collection
All participants were interviewed in private at the bedside.
One participant requested that his spouse be present for the
interview. The spouse observed but did not participate in the
process. The average length of stay (LOS) prior to being
interviewed was 9.45 days.
Atotal of 29 semi-structured, open-ended interviews were
conducted. A preliminary literature search and review was
completed to inform the development of the interview sched-
ules (see Appendix). Each participant was asked how he or
she chose to exercise in a typical day at home and about any
limiting or motivating factors he or she experienced. Each
participant was asked to describe outcome expectations he or
she may have had, and about the presence of social supports.
Three interviews were concluded early, 2 due to illness or
inability to continue and 1 due to the participant declining to
continue.
Data Analysis
The interviews were transcribed verbatim and the transcripts
were studied carefully in the context of the recorded inter-
views. Data analysis was carried out using thematic content
analysis. This was based on a five-stage analytical method
described in the literature (Flick, Von Kardoff, & Steinke,
2004; Gerrish & Lacey, 2010; Ritchie & Lewis, 2003). These
stages were
1. Familiarization and identification of key themes;
2. Creating a "thematic framework" (Ritchie & Lewis,
2003);
Broderick et al. 3
3. Coding;
4. Sorting data;
5. Summarizing or synthesizing data.
Data analysis was facilitated by computer-assisted quali-
tative data analysis software (CAQDAS) using QSR
International's NVivo 9 qualitative data analysis software.
Findings
Research analysis identified three key themes: perceptions of
exercise, personal agency, and social support. One other
theme comprising of a number of historical influences,
including the impact of emigration and technology on exer-
cise behaviors in this cohort, was also identified.
Perceptions of Exercise
Perceptions of exercise were shaped by three key themes.
How they defined and described exercise in terms of their
previous and current exercise behaviors, and their percep-
tions of their own exercise levels are all presented below to
give an overview of their beliefs regarding exercise.
Exercise history.When describing how they exercised as
young adults, participants classified exercise as a relatively
vigorous activity. Manual labor, playing sport, or dancing
were common examples of exercise. However, the majority
of those interviewed did not recall being active solely for the
purpose of exercise. Rather, they happened to be exercising
while doing activities that were seen as either necessary or
fun:
Oh my god girl we never stopped dancing . . . we never stopped
on our bikes. Out to [place name], down to [place name] every
Sunday. And we worked 6 days a week in the [company name]
from 8 in the morning until 6 at night. (Participant 15)
When participants began to discuss their exercise behavior in
later years, there was a move to describing less strenuous activi-
ties such as housework or gardening. Although the intensity of
the exercise had changed, the majority of participants continued
to see it as incidental to other, necessary forms of activity.
In addition, participants described walking as a common
form of exercise in later life. Walking was the exercise most
commonly cited by this group, which was undertaken for the
specific purpose of exercising, as opposed to playing sports,
which had more of a social component:
Participant (P):I have a walker. I'd walk about 10 yards
anyway.
Interviewer (I): Would you?
 P:
I do 10 yards anyway between the
house and the garden at home.
(Participant 21)
Current exercise behaviors.Accounts of exercise progressed
to describing current exercise behavior in terms of everyday
activities such as activities of daily living (ADLs), light
housework, gardening, or socializing:
Well I take it as exercise if I make the breakfast and I do a bit of
ironing and when the weather is good I'd do a bit of gardening.
(Participant 1)
No participant described ADLs as a form of exercise
when referring to their earlier years. These data indicate that
participants changed their perceptions of what constituted
exercise in line with their changed functional ability. The
data also indicate that this group of frail older adults largely
did not purposefully set out to exercise; they instead chose to
describe exercise as a consequence of other, more purposeful
activities.
While 27 participants described themselves as participat-
ing in some form of daily exercise, only 6 described them-
selves as being active. Of the remaining group, 10 stated they
were not active enough. Although the data did not reveal any
obvious association between beliefs regarding exercise and
perceived participation, individuals who felt they were inac-
tive were less likely to describe walking as part of their daily
routine. In contrast, those who described themselves as
active all reported regularly walking outdoors. The data
implied that an ability to participate in outdoor activities may
be associated with a greater confidence in one's own exercise
capability. It also indicated that walking is heavily associated
with perceiving oneself as active:
I'd get up in the morning and I was very independent. I was able
to have a shower . . . And I'd, I'd walk around, walk around. I
haven't dementia now or anything, only a bungalow. I'd walk
around the house and I'd go up and I'd open the gates.
(Participant 14)
Thus, exercise was largely defined in terms of everyday
activities including ADLs, gardening, and housework, as
well as more vigorous activities for some, such as walking
and cycling. Exercise appeared to be a by-product of other
more meaningful activities. This perception of exercise
reflected participants' experiences as they reminisced about
their earlier lives.
Structured exercise programs. Previous participation within a
planned or structured exercise program appears to have
influenced current perceptions of exercise. For example,
three participants who had previously partaken in some kind
of rehabilitation or exercise-based therapy chose to define
exercise within those terms:
I do try to do my small lot of breathing exercises you know like
the puffs now and all that like. And I'd do the push-ups . . . I
done the rehabilitation course there across the road and I loved
it. (Participant 12)
4 SAGE Open
Those who had participated in these programs also
defined outcome expectations in terms of recovery while
personal expectations were positive but qualified. Those who
had participated in rehabilitation used physiotherapy and
exercise as interchangeable terms. One participant, on being
asked about exercise outcomes, replied,
Well if you do physiotherapy now or running or something like
that you know that you, you get some bit done. (Participant 8)
The data indicated strong positive perceptions regarding
exercise when involved in a planned program.
Other forms of participation in structured exercise activi-
ties included those who had previously been in the military
service or who had been involved in sports. However, three
participants who had taken part in such activities when
younger, and who described themselves as having a high
level of physical fitness at the time, had a negative percep-
tion of their current level of activity. For example, two male
participants, who were formerly in the army, described exer-
cise primarily in terms of vigorous activities. Both found it
difficult to describe themselves as exercising currently when
compared with their previous activity levels. One partici-
pant, on being asked what exercise he did at home, replied,
Nothing only . . . all I was doing was smoking . . . Just lazy. Loss
of thought. I used to do it like. I used to be fit. I was fit. I got very
lazy though. (Participant 23)
Personal Agency
Personal agency refers to one's ability to make choices,
establish goals, and plan one's actions (McAdams & Olson,
2010). Three subthemes identified in the findings that influ-
enced personal agency included perceived motivators, out-
come expectations, and perceived barriers. Social support
was also a strong theme identified; this is presented in the
following section.
Perceived motivators. The desire to be independent and not be
a "burden" on family members was a prominent motivating
factor for this group. Participants expressed fear and anxiety
when describing potentially losing their independence. One
participant when speaking of her sister who had been con-
fined to a wheelchair for a number of years stated,
My god I'd never do that. I'd never, I'd crack up and you know
everyone says to me "you know if you had to do it you would
'cause you wouldn't be able to." Oh but 'twould . . . so I have to
keep walking. I have to keep walking. (Participant 6)
A sense of enjoyment was also identified as a strong moti-
vating factor. Exercise, particularly in the contexts described
above, was associated with a sense of personal achievement
and fulfillment. Outdoor activities such as walking or
gardening were also described by participants as something
they enjoyed:
I walk. People say would you not get a taxi and I laugh at them.
Would you not get a lift and I say "It's too organized to get a lift."
. . .You walk and you see everything and you're in communication
with people. You're feeling better. (Participant 27)
Outcome expectations. All but one participant believed exer-
cise had some positive outcomes for the general population.
No participant associated exercise with negative outcomes
although one believed that exercise had no outcomes at all.
Seventeen participants believed that exercise had, or poten-
tially could have, a positive impact on their own lives.
Broadly, those outcomes were classified into three catego-
ries: physical, social, and mental.
Physical outcomes were described in terms of weight con-
trol, improved circulation, reduced pain, and as "good for
joints" and general fitness. Maintenance was the most com-
mon outcome described with participants using expressions
like "keeps you going," "stops you slowing down," and
"keeps you alive." Those who had previously taken part in
rehabilitation strongly associated exercise with recovery.
Regular participation in exercise was also associated with
positive social outcomes. Exercise was seen to promote con-
fidence and social skills, and to prevent negative social influ-
ences, particularly for younger adults:
I vote for people taking up sports and staying away from them
bloody pubs and drugs and everything like that like. (Participant 12)
However, participants did not see themselves as benefit-
ing socially from exercise. This may be related to the avail-
ability of social support to this group, findings on which are
presented in further detail below.
Finally, exercise was seen as having a positive impact on
mental health through mood and cognition although this was
not as widely identified as the two previous outcomes. The
participants who described this outcome commonly associ-
ated increased physical activity with maintaining an "active
mind"; two participants specifically related this to prevent-
ing dementia. Improved mood was also seen as an outcome,
which they associated with improved mental health:
'Twould lift your spirits in the first place to have to get up to
have something to do . . . [If] you're sitting down in the corner,
as the one says twiddling your thumbs all day, sure wouldn't you
go crazy? (Participant 7)
Yet despite the majority of participants associating posi-
tive outcomes with exercise, eight participants believed that
it no longer had any effect on them personally due to their
age, medical condition, or current level of ability. Social,
mental, and physical outcomes were no longer seen as
achievable due to these perceived barriers to exercise.
Broderick et al. 5
Perceived barriers. Medical condition, fear of falling, family,
social isolation, self-consciousness, age, limited ability, and
environment were the most common barriers to exercise
cited by participants. Every participant interviewed cited at
least one barrier, yet only eight participants referred to these
barriers as having a negative impact on their outcome
expectations.
In total, seven participants described age as a barrier to
exercise. Five participants, aged between 79 and 85 years,
described their age as limiting their outcome expectations.
These participants all associated exercise with positive out-
comes but believed those outcomes were limited to younger
people
P:
It's (exercise) a good idea for younger people.
I:What about people your own age?
P:We're gone beyond it. (Participant 11)
Age was also described as limiting one's ability to engage
in exercise. The phrase, "at my age," was used by five par-
ticipants to qualify their responses when describing how they
exercised. As commented by one participant,
At my age now I can't rush, so I have my own pace.
Sixteen participants cited a medical condition as a barrier
to exercise. Fifteen of those described it as a long-standing
chronic condition. Only 5 described themselves as experi-
encing an acute event or exacerbation of symptoms at the
time of being interviewed. Pain, fatigue, arthritis, and short-
ness of breath were the most commonly cited physical barri-
ers by this group.
Interestingly, given the frail nature of this population, fear
was described as a barrier to exercise by only three partici-
pants. Fears of falling or of becoming acutely unwell as a
result of over-exercising were expressed. These fears had the
potential to act as a strong barrier with one participant
stating,
I'm scared of my life. (Participant 24)
Fear was also closely linked to experiencing embarrass-
ment in social situations by two participants, creating an
additional barrier. Embarrassment and fear were both
described as a strong barrier to enjoyment of exercise and
other activities. As a result, participants felt isolated and
unable to participate in their normal activities:
I went to a funeral there now . . . I could hear all the men. "God
isn't she after getting very stiff. I never knew she was that stiff"
. . . I felt like a specimen like you know . . . Well it stops me
going out enjoying myself. (Participant 3)
Environment was described as a barrier by four partici-
pants. External limitations such as steep hills, steps without
railings, and heavy traffic were all described as preventing
participants from exercising. However, environmental limi-
tations also existed within the home. In one case, the move to
sheltered housing was associated with a reduction in exer-
cise. Other participants described themselves as being lim-
ited to an area of the house, such as downstairs, giving them
insufficient room to exercise.
Social Support
A prominent finding from the data was that social support
seemed more influential on exercise behavior than any other
external factor. Participants described two types of social
support as predominant pre-admission: family support and
non-family peer support.
Family support. The data showed that family was the predom-
inant source of social support for this group. Exercise and
other activities were often described by participants as being
conducted in conjunction with family members, rather than
as an independent activity. Seventeen participants cited their
family members as motivating them to exercise. This moti-
vation could stem from a family member directly advising or
asking them to exercise:
My wife never stops us going. She's always saying get yourself
out. (Participant 9)
Others reported more indirect family support or involve-
ment in exercise. For example, one participant took up
using light weights after teaching his grandson how to use
them:
Every second day I'd do it [lift weights] . . . he was home I was
watching him and I told him he was wrong and I showed him
what to do. (Participant 22)
However, the influence of family was a complex factor.
Five participants who had described their family as motivat-
ing them also reported them as a barrier to exercise. Primarily
family members appeared to limit exercise behavior by
actively discouraging participation in the household routine.
Three women interviewed complained about family mem-
bers usurping their role by taking over tasks that they saw as
their own:
He [husband] took over when he retired . . . and I let him. I say I
have to get the kitchen back you know. (Participant 6)
For some participants, family members explicitly discour-
aged them from exercising, which they attributed to a wish to
protect or look after them. However, those who felt they
were being directly prevented, as opposed to being simply
discouraged from exercising, were likely to express anger or
frustration:
6 SAGE Open
I went out to the shop and she [daughter] was coming in. And
says she . . . "What do you want in the shop I'll get it" and I was
halfway. Says I, "will you get away from me." I wanted to do it
meself like. (Participant 15)
Non-family support. Non-family supports consisted of friends
or peer groups. Four participants reported feeling isolated or
lonely when at home. Thirteen participants described them-
selves as no longer having access to friends or other non-
family peer groups and hence not being able to engage
socially with others. These participants expressed a lack of
social engagement despite the presence of family support.
Five participants identified the lack of available support
from friends as a barrier to exercise. Inability to meet friends
due to lack of transport or medical issues was cited by some
participants; however, the main cause identified was the
death of friends. As one participant stated,
I've sort of no friends like. I've buried most of them. (Participant 3)
Two participants described themselves as having limited
access to a social group, with one attending a senior citizens
group and the other attending a local activity group regularly
pre-admission. However, in both cases attendance was
dependant on a family member.
Thus, although family support was widely available, this
group's limited access to friend or peer group­based social
networks may have acted as an additional barrier to
exercise.
Historical Influences
The participants' exercise behaviors were influenced by a
number of factors throughout their lifetime. Their back-
ground, gender, emigration history and exposure to tech-
nology all had an impact on their exercise history, and
influenced changes in exercise behaviors throughout their
lifetime.
Rural versus urban dwelling.Participant data suggested that
there were differences in early life exercise behaviors
between urban and rural dwellers. Participants who were
rural dwellers described exercise in their early lives mainly
in terms of work and walking. In particular, rural dwelling
women strongly associated exercise and physical activity
with workload:
I did everything from working hard to . . . I'd do anything. I
mean I could go out and I could turn sods and I could do the
garden and set potatoes and I could split blocks and I could cut
them with a saw. (Participant 14)
Although urban dwellers also described exercise in these
terms, they were more likely to include social activities such
as dancing and participation in sports as exercise:
We played . . . oh loved tennis and camogie and you know when
I was [a] youngster. (Participant 6)
Family life. The findings indicate that participants perceived
transitions in family life, in particular assuming the role of
carer, as having some impact on their exercise behaviors. For
example, the transition into parenthood was mentioned by
both sexes. The data showed that this change had a strong
influence on women's perceived exercise behaviors. How-
ever, it did not appear to affect the majority of the male
participants.
Some of the women interviewed, in particular those
who had worked outside the home, associated the birth of
their children with a reduction in exercise. This appeared
to be as a result of giving up work to stay at home and the
subsequent reduced social participation that some
described:
Ah 45 years ago I gave it [work] up after my daughter was born.
(Participant 6)
However, women who worked in the home were more
likely to perceive having children as increasing their work-
load and hence their exercise levels:
I was a farmer's wife 60 years, over 60 years and I'll tell you . .
. That was my day and I had eight in family . . . I hadn't much
time for hanging about I tell you this much. (Participant 7)
As children grew older and moved away, both groups
associated this shift with a reduction in activity.
Women were also more likely to describe later life transi-
tions, such as caring for a spouse, as affecting on their exer-
cise levels. This also appeared to be associated with a
perceived increase in workload and hence exercise.
Emigration and technology.Urban and rural dwellers were
both likely to describe the impact of emigration as a negative
factor on their physical activity. Participants who emigrated
described a notable decline or end to their participation in
sports or other activities:
'Twas always dogs nearly but I was in England for 38 years . . .
I went to England then and there's no hunting or fishing over
there then. (Participant 20)
The advent of more modern technologies such as farm
machinery or the introduction of the car was viewed as hav-
ing a negative impact on exercise levels. Although both
urban and rural dwelling participants noted this impact, it
was rural dwellers in particular who associated the introduc-
tion of machinery with a gradual decline in their own activity
levels. Considering that rural dwelling participants in par-
ticular associated exercise and manual labor so strongly, it is
not surprising that a reduction in workload related to a
decline in activity:
Broderick et al. 7
Well the hard work was . . . was eh . . . 'Twas gone like. There
was all machinery and everything came in then. So that was the
end of the hard work. (Participant 26)
Discussion
The findings of this study indicate that frail, community-
dwelling older adults perceive exercise as an important activ-
ity with potentially positive outcomes. Yet, their descriptions
of their own exercise behaviors indicated that exercise was
traditionally perceived as an incidental outcome rather than
prioritized as a health-related activity. All participants
showed a strong lifelong association between workload and
exercise. Changes in workload led to perceived changes in
exercise levels at multiple stages throughout life. This asso-
ciation was upheld through periods of change or major life
events, such as emigration, entering parenthood, caring for a
spouse, or getting their first car. Other activities that would
appear more exercise oriented, sports for example, had other
more purposeful outcomes such as socializing. This implies
that this cohort viewed exercise primarily as an outcome of a
purposeful activity.
These perceptions influenced current exercise behaviors
that were still based strongly on workload. In line with
Bandura's (1997) hypothesis that people change their exer-
cise behaviors as their functional abilities decline, changing
levels of ability led participants to change their descriptions
of exercise. However, these descriptions remained heavily
based on function. When describing exercise in later life,
participants also placed a greater emphasis on the importance
of walking and being able to spend time outdoors. The data
suggest that these activities were associated with a greater
confidence in their own exercise capabilities.
These findings support other data that suggest that older
adults place a high value on functional independence (Melillo
et al., 1996). However, this is the first study to examine frail
older adults' exercise history and how it relates to their cur-
rent perceptions of exercise. The finding that this cohort
view exercise as an outcome of other purposeful activities
indicates that programs targeting this cohort may benefit
from using functionally based exercises or exercises with a
clear functional goal.
Those who had previously participated in structured
exercise or rehabilitation programs defined exercise and its
outcomes within those terms. The data indicated strong
positive perceptions of exercise undertaken in these pro-
grams. This is supported by other research, which indicates
that education and positive experiences of exercise in a
recovery setting has a positive impact on exercise beliefs
(Hurley, Walsh, Bhavnani, Britten, & Stevenson, 2010).
These strong associations appear to have been associated
with the positive physical outcomes achieved during these
programs. However, they may have been perceived as such
due to the positive functional outcomes associated with
rehabilitation programs. Research has also found that
participants in rehabilitation-based programs place a value
on the educational component of rehabilitation (Hurley et
al., 2010). Therefore, while structured exercise programs
have the potential to influence exercise beliefs and hence
behaviors in this population, there is a need to establish
what components of structured rehabilitation programs spe-
cifically affect these outcomes.
Perceived motivators expressed by this group included
positive outcome expectations, personal enjoyment, and a
wish to remain independent. Positive outcome expectations
included weight control, improved circulation, reduced pain,
improved mood, and increasing and maintaining physical fit-
ness. Perceived barriers expressed by those interviewed
included lack of social support, presence of an underlying
medical condition, fear, self-consciousness, age, environ-
ment, and limited ability. These findings are largely in line
with studies of community-dwelling, non-frail, older adults
(de Groot & Fagerstrom, 2011; Mathews et al., 2010).
However, the perception of family support as a potential bar-
rier to exercise has not been raised in previous research. In
addition, the lack of non-family social support networks
available to this population appear to be more accentuated in
this study than in previous studies of non-frail older adults.
In this study, family was the most available form of social
support. This suggests onset of frailty is associated with an
increased dependence on family support. This is supported
by Drennan et al.'s (2008) finding that older adults who have
experienced a decline in health are more likely to be depen-
dent on their families for social support. However, family
support may limit as well as motivate frail older adults. In
this study, some participants appeared to be excluded from
activities they would have traditionally done, such as house-
work, and sometimes actively discouraged from exercising
in an effort to protect them. For this group, who perceive
such a close association between work and exercise, this
marginalization appeared not only to reduce exercise levels
but also to have an emotional impact. Some participants felt
they no longer had a purpose within the home, leading them
to feel unhappy or frustrated. This indicates that there may be
a need for family members, acting as carers to frail older
adults, to be educated on the importance of exercise and
maintaining functional independence for this group.
Although family support seemed an important positive
influencing factor, previous research points to social support
networks involving friends and peers as being the most effec-
tive in promoting exercise and other health behaviors in
older adults (Giles et al., 2005; Resnick et al., 2002; Warner
et al., 2011). In the present study, only three participants
reported having access to support from friends or peers. This
contrast to previous research, which has not specifically
focused on frail older adults, suggests that older adult's non-
family social networks decline because of frailty. Thus, any
intervention to promote exercise behaviors in frail older
adults should also examine the potential for creating social
support networks in their communities.

Potential Limitations and Strengths
This study had both limitations and strengths. As the author of
this study is a physiotherapist who specializes in working with
older adults, there is an assumption that the author's knowl-
edge, beliefs, and experience will have had some impact on the
findings. However, the author endeavored to take a reflexive
approach to the research by recognizing her own beliefs and
biases about frailty and exercise at an early stage, and reflecting
on them throughout the research process. By acknowledging
beliefs in this way, an author can be more receptive to the
research and limit the influence of his or her own preconcep-
tions (Jootun, McGhee, & Marland, 2009). This approach was
taken to promote the rigor of the research. Rigor in qualitative
research helps to ensure the findings are reliable, credible, and
valid (Nicholls, 2009). In addition, the author did not work in
the hospital where the interviews took place and was not known
to be a physiotherapist by the participants.
Another potential issue was that the participants were
interviewed about their exercise behaviors at home while in
hospital. In addition, some had already participated in the
intervention group, which may have had some impact on
their pre-existing perceptions of exercise. However, the aver-
age LOS prior to interviews was 9.45 days and recall was
likely to be relatively accurate. The potential for bias here
was also acknowledged during data collection and analysis,
and the author was careful to delineate between pre- and
post-intervention views during the interviews.
Notwithstanding these aspects, the findings of this study
are important as they provide insights into the exercise behav-
iors of frail older adults. To the author's knowledge, this is the
only study to examine perceptions of exercise specifically in
this cohort. The findings have revealed how the progression
of frailty, the impact of changing social supports, and varying
perceptions of exercise may affect exercise behavior. It has
highlighted previously unexplored areas including the poten-
tial limitations imposed by family support.
Conclusion
Health professionals planning interventions to promote or
maintain exercise in frail older adults should be aware of the
complex nature of factors that influence exercise in this pop-
ulation. Frail older adults strongly associate exercise with
workload and other functional activities. This perception has
existed throughout their lifetime. However, those who have
participated in structured rehabilitation programs instead
associate exercise primarily with positive physical outcomes.
Motivators and barriers to exercise in this study were found
to be similar to those experienced by non-frail older adults
from previous research. However, frailty is associated with a
decline in non-family support networks. Family-based sup-
port is a positive influence, yet it may lead to a change in
traditional roles within the family and consequently act as a
barrier to exercise.
Thus, any program targeting frail older adults' exercise
behaviors should take a multifaceted approach. Programs
that concentrate on functional outcomes may be more rele-
vant for this population. Family members in a caring role
may benefit from education regarding exercise behaviors.
Community-based strategies that promote social support net-
works may also benefit this group.
Appendix
Interview Schedule
I would like to ask you a few questions about how active you
are in general.
·
· Exercise can be lots of things including walking (and
other appropriate example). Thinking of a typical day
at home, is there anything that you do that you would
consider to be exercise?
·
· How else would you be active when you are at home?
·
· Does anything encourage you or stop you from exer-
cising at home?
·
· How did you exercise when you were younger? How
has that changed?
·
· Do you think exercise has any effect on you?
·
· How do you think exercising effects people in
general?
·
· Would you say people around you at home--give
example of family or friends if needed--encourage
you to exercise or not?
