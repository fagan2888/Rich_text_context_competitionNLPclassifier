Abstract
Background: Serum cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, is frequently used in research as a biomarker of recent
tobacco smoke exposure. Historically, secondhand smoke (SHS) research uses suboptimal statistical methods due to
censored serum cotinine values, meaning a measurement below the limit of detection (LOD).
Methods: We compared commonly used methods for analyzing censored serum cotinine data using parametric
and non-parametric techniques employing data from the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination
Surveys (NHANES). To illustrate the differences in associations obtained by various analytic methods, we compared
parameter estimates for the association between cotinine and the inflammatory marker homocysteine using
complete case analysis, single and multiple imputation, "reverse" Kaplan-Meier, and logistic regression models.
Results: Parameter estimates and statistical significance varied according to the statistical method used with
censored serum cotinine values. Single imputation of censored values with either 0, LOD or LOD/2 yielded similar
estimates and significance; multiple imputation method yielded smaller estimates than the other methods and
without statistical significance. Multiple regression modelling using the "reverse" Kaplan-Meier method yielded
statistically significant estimates that were larger than those from parametric methods.
Conclusions: Analyses of serum cotinine data with values below the LOD require special attention. "Reverse"
Kaplan-Meier was the only method inherently able to deal with censored data with multiple LODs, and may be the
most accurate since it avoids data manipulation needed for use with other commonly used statistical methods.
Additional research is needed into the identification of optimal statistical methods for analysis of SHS biomarkers
subject to a LOD.
Background
A biomarker is a laboratory measure of a biological pro-
cess [1]. The lowest quantity of a biomarker that can
be distinguished from the lack of that biomarker is the
biomarker's limit of detection (LOD), below which the
level of biomarker cannot be accurately measured. One
important yet unresolved issue in analyzing biomarker
data arises when biomarker measurements fall below the
LOD (i.e. "non-detects", "left-censored").
Statistical analyses of data that include biomarker
measurements below the LOD are complicated since
precise quantitative levels cannot always be determined
[1]. In all analyses involving biomarkers with a LOD,
researchers working with biomarker data inevitably have
to deal with data containing non-detects, and must
decide how to combine non-detects with values above
the LOD for analysis. The choice of an appropriate
strategy for dealing with data affected by LODs requires
an understanding of both experimental and statistical
procedures. Until now, the common practice has been
to impute (i.e. substitute a single value, such as a half of
the detection limit, for each measurement below the
LOD), and to then conduct the analysis under the
assumption that the imputed values are the actual
observed values [2-4]. This assumption may be invalid,
leading to biased results, especially when trying to pre-
dict small exposure-health outcome associations [5,6].

Analytic issues with secondhand smoke (SHS) expo-
sure biomarkers (e.g. cotinine, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-
1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) [NNAL]) arise due to a
large percentage of measurements below the LOD.
Serum cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, is widely used
in research as an objective measure of recent tobacco
smoke exposure. The use of traditional statistical meth-
ods to analyze serum cotinine measurements often
introduces bias into the study results due to measure-
ments falling below the LOD, potentially affecting the
accuracy of analytic results and validity of study conclu-
sions [1-4]. Furthermore, this bias may be greatest in
studies investigating the health effects of tobacco smoke
exposures at very low exposure levels, a situation where
the subjects' cotinine levels are more likely to be unde-
tectable. Therefore, the impact of low-level SHS expo-
sure on human disease may be underestimated using
traditional statistical methods for handling biomarkers
below the LOD [1,2].
The purpose of our research was to demonstrate and
compare the performances of commonly used statistical
methods as a case study for analyzing associations
between serum cotinine measurements with non-detects
and levels of the inflammatory marker homocysteine
using data from the 1999-2004 National Health and
Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) [7].
Methods
This project's data consisted of adults 18 and older par-
ticipating in the 1999-2004 NHANES, a cross-sectional
study designed to assess the health and nutritional sta-
tus of adults and children annually in the United States
(n = 31,126). The continuous NHANES survey com-
bines interviews and physical examinations; the resulting
data can be pooled across multiple years. Anonymous
survey data and related documents were obtained from
the NHANES website http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.
htm.
Subjects included in this analysis were non-smoking
adults age 20 years and older as defined by a serum
cotinine level less than or equal to 3.08 ng/mL or by
self report of not smoking within the past 5 days. This
particular cotinine threshold for adults has reportedly a
sensitivity of 96.3% and a specificity of 97.4% for differ-
entiating smokers from non-smokers [8]. The subjects
included in this analysis had detectable or undetectable
serum cotinine levels and complete information on
additional variables of interest (i.e. homocysteine, age,
gender, race/ethnicity, and SHS exposure) in order to
focus on the issue of properly handling left-censored
serum cotinine data (n = 9,488).
In the NHANES surveys, serum cotinine was assessed
using an isotope dilution high performance liquid chro-
matography atmospheric pressure chemical ionization
tandem mass spectrometric method [9]. The laboratory
test detection limit for serum cotinine in NHANES was
0.05 ng/mL for 1999-2000 and part of 2001-2002.
Improvements in the laboratory testing methods
reduced the LOD to 0.015 ng/mL; this lower detection
limit was used for the 2001-2002 and the 2003-2004
NHANES. For the 1999-2000 cycle, 37.7% of values
were below the LOD (0.05 ng/mL), while 22.6% were
below the LOD for the 2001-2002 cycle (either 0.015
ng/mL or 0.05 ng/mL) and 16.9% were below the LOD
for the 2003-2004 cycle (0.015 ng/mL). Plasma homo-
cysteine was analyzed using an automated fluorescence
polarization immunoassay [9].
We compared commonly used statistical methods
(Table 1) as a case study for analyzing serum cotinine
with measurement values below the LOD using para-
metric and non-parametric techniques: complete case
analysis, single and multiple imputation methods,
"reverse" Kaplan-Meier method, and logistic regression
models [2].
Methods of Handling Left-Censored Data
Complete-case analysis is a method of analysis that
incorporates only subjects with serum cotinine values
above the LOD. This is a widely used method due to its
simplicity, but is highly inefficient since it reduces sam-
ple size and produces bias and loss of precision in the
estimation [10].
Imputation is the practice of replacing undetectable
serum cotinine with "plausible" values [11]. After impu-
tation, data can be analyzed as if imputed values were
actual observed values. In single imputation, each non-
detect value is replaced with an estimate, but this does
not account for the sampling variability produced by
imputed values. Single imputation generally results in
the underestimation of variance, which directly affects
confidence intervals and statistical tests. In our analysis,
we performed single imputation analyses substituting
one of three different commonly used substitution
values for non-detect cotinine measurements: 0, LOD,
and LOD/2. Depending on the LOD of the cotinine
measurement method, single imputation values changed
when the LOD changed across survey cycles (i.e. 0.05 ng/
mL for 1999-2000 and part of 2001-2002; 0.015 ng/mL
for part of 2001-2002 and 2003-2004).
Multiple imputation is a simulation-based approach
which can provide a good solution to missing data pro-
blems; and it has been used extensively with complex
national surveys [12-16]. The basic idea of multiple
imputation is to replace each non-detect with a vector
of more than two plausible values from the predictive
data distribution [13-15]. In general, multiple imputation
results in unbiased estimates, uses all available data, pre-
serves both sample size and statistical power, and

reflects the sampling variability. After imputation, any
statistical software designed for analyzing complete data
can be used.
In our multiple imputation method, we considered
non-detect cotinine measurements as missing values
based on an imputation model derived from multivariate
normal distribution used to construct the predictive dis-
tribution for non-detected serum cotinine that included:
homocysteine, serum cotinine, age, gender (female/male),
race/ethnicity (Non-Hispanic White/Other), and self-
reported SHS exposure (yes/no). The number of imputa-
tions was set to 10 (i.e. 10 complete datasets including
both the detected and imputed non-detected serum coti-
nine measurements in addition to other variables of inter-
est such as homocysteine, age, gender, race/ethnicity, and
self-reported SHS exposure). Ten completed datasets are
usually sufficient for multiple imputation [14].
Two different multiple imputation models were used
for creating the imputed serum cotinine with LOD.
They were both based on a multivariate normal distribu-
tion which takes into account the correlation between
the variables included in the imputation model. The
first model included only homocysteine and serum coti-
nine; the second imputation model not only included
homocysteine and serum cotinine, but also included age,
gender, race/ethnicity, and self-reported SHS exposure
to take into account the strength of the relationship
among all other variables. The imputation model pre-
dicted distribution for non-detected serum cotinine
from the subjects' homocysteine, age, gender (female/
male), race/ethnicity (Non-Hispanic White/Other), and
self-reported SHS exposure (yes/no).
The "reverse" Kaplan-Meier method is a non-parametric
method that does not require a probabilistic distribution
to estimate the survival function from time-to-event
type of biological data [17]. It is frequently used with
right-censored survival data. For left-censored data,
an equivalent estimator can be obtained by Turnbull esti-
mator, which is equivalent to the "reverse" Kaplan-Meier
estimator. We performed the "reverse" Kaplan-Meier
method by considering left-censored serum cotinine as a
"time-to-event" outcome.
Logistic regression is a modelling technique for
dichotomous outcomes [18]. We fitted a logistic regres-
sion model using dichotomized serum cotinine (below
vs. above LOD) as the outcome variable, and the contin-
uous homocysteine values as a predictor variable.
In all of the methods, the univariate regression models
for serum cotinine included only continuous homocys-
teine values as a predictor. The multiple regression
models not only included continuous homocysteine
values, but also age, gender (female/male), race/ethnicity
(Non-Hispanic White/Other), and self-reported SHS
exposure (yes/no).
Statistical analysis
To illustrate the differences in the estimates obtained
among different analytical methods for handling LOD,
study variables were regressed on the inflammatory mar-
ker homocysteine. The NHANES survey weights were
not incorporated in any of these analyses to show the
differences between the methods as a case study under a
random sampling schema. In this case study, the pri-
mary objective was to compare the parameter estimates
from univariate and multiple regression models that
quantify the relationship between inflammatory marker
homocysteine and serum cotinine subject to LOD. The
univariate regression models for inflammatory marker
homocysteine included only serum cotinine as a predic-
tor variable; the multiple regression models included
additional variables (as described above). The regression
coefficient estimate of serum cotinine, its standard error,
and the ratio of the regression coefficient to its standard
error as well as the statistical significance were reported
and compared among all the methods. All of the ana-
lyses were implemented using SAS version 9.2 for
Windows statistical software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC, USA). Statistical significance was attained with
p-value < 0.05.

case analysis method, all the methods preserved the
sample size. The methods differed on how censored
values were treated in the analyses. The complete case
analysis method was not suitable since it simply
excluded all of the censored cotinine values from the
analysis. Logistic regression models were also not suita-
ble methods since it collapsed cotinine values into
a dichotomous categorical variable (detectable vs.
undetectable).
Methods that replaced censored measurements with
imputed values were the single and multiple imputation
methods. This happens for both single and multiple
imputation when either: 1) a non-detect is substituted
with an imputed value; or 2) when more than one LOD
exists and all values below the highest LOD are treated
as non-detects. The methods inherently able to deal
with multiple LOD were the multiple imputation,
"reverse" Kaplan-Meier method, and logistic regression.
Based on the three criteria listed in table 1, the "reverse"
Kaplan-Meier method was the most efficient method
because it did not require transformation of data to a
categorical variable, did not replace censored data with
an imputed value, and was able to handle data with
multiple LODs.
Parameter estimates and statistical significance for
serum cotinine varied according to different methods
(Table 2). All the methods found positive associations
between serum cotinine and homocysteine in both uni-
variate and multiple regression models. In all methods
of analyses, univariate regression estimates (range: 0.001
­ 0.524) were smaller than multiple regression estimates
(range: 0.020 ­ 1.093). The multiple imputation method
reported the smallest estimates in both the univariate
and multiple regression models, while the logistic
regression models resulted in the largest regression esti-
mates. The only method that did not reveal statistically
significant associations between serum cotinine mea-
surements and levels of homocysteine was multiple
imputation.
Discussion
The results of this analysis suggest that different statisti-
cal methods for handling LODs can result in variable
parameter estimates with resulting p-values both above
and below the level of 5% when investigating the asso-
ciations between serum cotinine and the inflammatory
marker homocysteine. While all methods revealed posi-
tive associations between serum cotinine and homocys-
teine, the multiple imputation method did not yield
significant parameter estimates. The complete case
analysis, single imputation, "reverse" Kaplan-Meier, and
logistic regression demonstrated statistically significant
positive associations between cotinine and homocysteine
levels.
Significant variation between methods was seen in the
size of the estimates using both univariate and multiple
regression models; a 524 and 55 fold difference was
seen in the size of estimates between the multiple impu-
tation and logistic regression using univariate and multi-
ple regression models, respectively. The smallest ratio
(estimate/SE) was observed with multiple imputation,
while the largest in the logistic regression model. Single
imputation using different values for substitution also
resulted in slight variation in the size of both univariate
and multiple regression models; regression estimates
increased from 0.053 to 0.055 and from 0.079 to 0.083

for univariate and multiple regression models, respec-
tively, as the imputation value was changed from the
LOD to 0.
Since the true regression coefficient parameter is not
known, we do not know for sure which result is the
most accurate. Multiple imputation, although believed
to be appropriate for complex sample survey data and
endorsed in the past for use with NHANES data, is sub-
ject to many of the same limitations as complete case
and single imputation analysis due to the replacement
of censored values with values that were not measured
directly [19]. While the creation of binary (below vs.
above LOD) or ordinal (below LOD, above LOD as low,
medium, high) categorical data from censored data does
not violate any assumptions of logistic regression, such
statistical methods have much less power compared to
"reverse" Kaplan-Meier due to aggregating biomarker
measurements into subgroups. Additionally, the group-
ing and subsequent loss of statistical power with the
creation of categorical/ordinal cotinine variables may
not be able to detect small associations, such as with
the health effects of very low levels of SHS exposure.
The "reverse" Kaplan-Meier method, however, appears
to be both the most efficient and the most accurate
method for this analysis since it is inherently able to
handle censored data with multiple LODs, and it avoids
the need for data manipulation (needed with imputation
methods or logistic regression).
Conclusions
Researchers who use tobacco smoke exposure bio-
markers, such as serum cotinine, should be aware that
commonly used analytic techniques for handling left-
censored data may bias study results by using suboptimal
statistical methods, especially in studies investigating the
health effects of SHS exposure due to typically small
effect sizes. Analysis of left-censored data requires special
attention, as different methods may yield different results
as shown in our case study. Many commonly used statis-
tical methods do not properly handle left-censored serum
cotinine data because these methods either exclude sub-
jects with undetectable cotinine levels or impute values
that are treated as actual observed values. Our analysis
suggests "reverse" Kaplan-Meier is the preferred method
of analysis of serum cotinine with censored data and with
multiple LODs until more in depth research on optimal
methods of analysis for left-censored data finds its place
in the scientific literature.
Statistical simulation studies are needed to compare
the results and to generalize the conclusions to other
surveys, as well as to other left-censored biomarker
data. In statistical simulation studies, one can compare
the estimates obtained from different methods with the
true estimates to understand bias and error introduced
by varying the different scenarios (such as the percen-
tage of LOD, the magnitude of the correlation between
the left-censored biomarker, and the other variables of
interest).
Considering the frequent use of SHS biomarkers in
public health research and their impact on public health
policy, research is needed into the most appropriate sta-
tistical methods for use with SHS biomarkers, and well-
defined guidelines need to be developed for analyzing
SHS biomarkers data.
