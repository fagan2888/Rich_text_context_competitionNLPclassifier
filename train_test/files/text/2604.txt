study reported that of 20 subjects with a positive
penicillin skin test, 10 reacted to an imipenem
reagent.5 We would recommend that in patients
with a history of penicillin allergy, the same con-
cerns and caveats apply to both the cephalospo-
rins and carbapenems.

The authors reply: We agree that caution
should be exercised in the administration of car-
bapenems (as well as cephalosporins and semi-
synthetic penicillins) to patients with a history of
penicillin allergy. The recommendations that we
put forth regarding the use of cephalosporins in
patients with penicillin allergy should also be ap-
plied to the use of semisynthetic penicillins and
carbapenems in these patients.

Stimulant Medications
and Attention Deficit­Hyperactivity Disorder
To the Editor: On February 9, 2006, a Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel rec-
ommended that stimulant drugs prescribed for
attention deficit­hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
carry warnings about the potential for an in-
creased risk of sudden death and cardiovascular
problems such as hypertension, cardiac arrest, ar-
rhythmias, and stroke.1 Although stimulant drugs
are known to cause adverse cardiovascular ef-
fects,2,3 little is known about the incidence and
type of adverse events in the community setting.
To explore this issue, we examined adverse events
from stimulant medications prescribed for the
treatment of ADHD. We used data from the Na-
tional Electronic Injury Surveillance System­
Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance
(NEISS­CADES) project, a public health surveil-
lance system based on the review of the clinical
records from emergency departments.4
From August 1, 2003, to December 31, 2005,
the 64 NEISS­CADES hospitals reported a total
of 188 visits to the emergency department on ac-
count of adverse events resulting from use of the
following stimulant medications: methylphenidate,
dexmethylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, am-
phetamine with dextroamphetamine, and meth-
amphetamine (Table 1). Adverse drug events in-
cluded unintentional ingestions or overdoses (61
percent), adverse effects (33 percent), and aller-
gic reactions (6 percent). Visits to the emergency
department resulting from intentional self-harm,
drug withdrawal, and drug abuse were excluded.
Eighty-two percent of adverse drug events occurred
in children under 18 years of age, and 58 percent
occurred in male patients of all ages. Twenty-six
patients (14 percent) had effects of potential con-
cern that may have been cardiovascular in origin
(e.g., chest pain, stroke, syncope, tachycardia, hy-
pertension, or dyspnea). Cardiac-enzyme values,
telemetric recordings, or electrocardiograms were

obtained for 27 patients (14 percent) who had ad-
verse drug events. In most patients (84 percent)
the adverse event was attributed to effects of
stimulant medications alone; in 16 percent the
adverse event was attributed to stimulant medi-
cations in combination with other drugs. Sixty-
seven patients (36 percent) were found to have in-
gested medications that were not prescribed for
them; 65 of 115 patients with unintentional over-
doses (57 percent) were from this group. In 2004,
81 stimulant-related adverse drug events were
reported; from this we estimate that 3075 pa-
tients presented to emergency departments na-
tionally for adverse events from stimulant drugs
prescribed for the treatment of ADHD.
The primary limitation of these surveillance
data is that they include only patients whose symp-
toms are documented by the treating clinician as
being caused by use of the medication. Thus, the
NEISS­CADES project probably underestimates
the number of adverse drug events that are rare,
previously unreported, or difficult to diagnose in
the setting of an emergency department. Never-
theless, we found that visits to an emergency de-
partment for adverse drug events due to stimu-
lant medications are not uncommon. Clinicians
should recognize that unintentional overdoses of
stimulant medications are an important cause
of injury to patients, and they should investigate
cardiovascular symptoms of potential concern
among patients taking stimulant medications.
Clinicians should also report serious adverse
events to the FDA.
