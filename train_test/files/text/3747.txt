Abstract
Qualitative evaluations of courses prove difficult due to low response rates. Online courses may permit the analysis of
qualitative feedback provided by health care providers (HCPs) during and after the course is completed. This study describes
the use of qualitative methods for an online continuing medical education (CME) course through the analysis of HCP feedback
for the purpose of quality improvement. We used formative and summative feedback from HCPs about their self-reported
experiences of completing an online expert-facilitated course on tobacco dependence treatment (the Training Enhancement
in Applied Cessation Counselling and Health [TEACH] Project). Phenomenological, inductive, and deductive approaches
were applied to develop themes. QSR NVivo 11 was used to analyze the themes derived from free-text comments and
responses to open-ended questions. A total of 277 out of 287 participants (96.5%) completed the course evaluations and
provided 690 comments focused on how to improve the program. Five themes emerged from the formative evaluations:
overall quality, content, delivery method, support, and time. The majority of comments (22.6%) in the formative evaluation
expressed satisfaction with overall course quality. Suggestions for improvement were mostly for course content and
delivery method (20.4% and 17.8%, respectively). Five themes emerged from the summative evaluation: feedback related to
learning objectives, interprofessional collaboration, future topics of relevance, overall modifications, and overall satisfaction.
Comments on course content, website function, timing, and support were the identified areas for improvement. This study
provides a model to evaluate the effectiveness of online educational interventions. Significantly, this constructive approach to
evaluation allows CME providers to take rapid corrective action.

Introduction
Online learning was introduced with the advent of the
Internet in the early 1990s and has been increasingly used in
medical and health care education.1 As the number of online
courses continues to grow, the need for quality and account-
ability in course evaluations is also increasing.2 A meta-
analysis in health professions education concluded that
online learning is associated with a large positive effect in
outcomes such as satisfaction, knowledge, skills, behaviors,
and impact to patients compared with no intervention, and
effectiveness is similar to that of classroom-based learning
methods.1 While the results of online and in-person train-
ings are not significantly different, online evaluation
response rates typically fall below that of classroom-based
response rates.3,4 Evaluating online learning remains a chal-
lenge, and there is a lack of general consensus on the best
way to evaluate online learning and use the evaluation data
to support quality improvement.2,5

2 INQUIRY
Online courses might be an acceptable alternative to train-
ing a diverse workforce spread across great distances and
time zones.6 It is usually time intensive and cost prohibitive
to offer in-person intensive training courses to health care
providers1 (HCPs) where there is a large "know-do" gap in
some specific areas such as tobacco dependence treatment.
Moreover, quality improvement of course offerings requires
collecting and analyzing feedback from participants, and
using this feedback to modify the experience and content for
future learners.
The Training Enhancement in Applied Cessation
Counselling and Health (TEACH) Project is the first univer-
sity-accredited continuing medical education certificate pro-
gram in Canada focused on tobacco dependence treatment.
This project has been highly successful in developing an
interprofessional, collaborative, and experiential education
program, training more than 5000 HCPs to date. The TEACH
curriculum consists of three courses: (1) an online introduc-
tory course on tobacco control pillars (10.5 hours), (2) a
classroom-based or online Core Course on the fundamentals
of tobacco dependence treatment (19.5 hours), and (3) a
classroom-based or online Specialty Course focused on a
variety of populations or topics where tobacco dependence
treatment requires adaptation (13.5 hours). Course evalua-
tion is a critical component to quality assurance and improve-
ment. The TEACH Project's comprehensive evaluation
framework7 includes course evaluations completed by learn-
ers following each course module (i.e., formative evaluation)
in addition to a summative evaluation immediately adminis-
tered post training. Learners also complete a follow-up eval-
uation at 3 and 6 months post training.
To create a learner-centered program that supports rapid
experiential learning8 and expands reach by building
capacity among HCPs unable to travel for classroom-based
training, TEACH courses have been adapted for the online
environment, utilizing best practice principles in e-Learn-
ing. Despite administering comprehensive quantitative
surveys, a qualitative evaluation was designed to inform
quality improvement of the TEACH online Core Course.7
Data obtained from written questionnaires with predefined
answers may be less contextually rich than that obtained
through qualitative approaches9 (i.e., free-text or open-
ended comments). With qualitative response options, par-
ticipants can respond to the questions as they would like to
answer them and the researcher can investigate the mean-
ing of these responses. However, we recognized that the
qualitative feedback may not be representative of the all
HCPs who participated in the online Core Course, and
therefore, quantitative data from an online survey were
also obtained.
The goals of this article are to (1) introduce curriculum
designers to an innovative use of qualitative methods in both
formative and summative course evaluations and (2) describe
the qualitative findings elicited from TEACH-trained HCPs
following their participation in the TEACH online Core
Course for program evaluation.
Methods
This article reports thematic analysis of HCPs' opinions
expressed in feedback data from four cohorts of the TEACH
online Core Course. These data were collected in January,
May, July, and October 2015 during and after the course was
completed. HCPs were asked to provide free-text comments
after each of 10 modules (i.e., formative) and respond to a
series of open-ended questions following the end of the
course (i.e., summative), in addition to quantitative ques-
tions. Demographic information, professional discipline, and
number of years providing tobacco cessation interventions
were also collected. At the time this study was designed, the
Centre for Addiction and Mental Health Research Ethics
Board deemed that formal review and approval was not
required for our study.
In this phenomenological study, we used a hybrid process
of inductive and deductive thematic analysis to interpret the
free-text comments from the formative evaluations and
open-ended questions from the summative evaluations.
Inductive codes were based on prominent themes that
emerged from HCPs' free-text comments. Our deductive
codes were based on concepts that we explicitly asked HCPs
about (e.g., what overall modifications to the course do you
suggest) through open-ended questions, in which we
searched for attributes of Henri's model.10 This strategy
allowed us to examine our study questions (i.e., through our
questions in the summative phase and through deductive
codes) while capturing other key themes that emerged from
the data (i.e., free-text comments through inductive codes
that allowed the data, rather than theory, to drive coding).11
We used the Braun and Clarke model12 for our thematic anal-
ysis as it is a flexible approach that can be used across a
range of research questions applying the following six
phases: (1) Free-text comments and responses to open-ended
questions were read and reread to familiarize the researchers
with the data; (2) a range of initial codes were generated to
index common features across comments; (3) these initial
codes were examined to determine prevalent themes; (4)
themes were reviewed for internal homogeneity and external
heterogeneity, to combine similar themes into overarching
themes and draw coherent links or distinctions between
them; (5) the overarching themes were firmly defined, orga-
nized in relation to their collated data extracts, and then ana-
lyzed for subthemes; and (6) the report was produced.
Several steps were taken to ensure methodological and ana-
lytical rigor in this investigation. Two independent raters
(A.E.A. and M.B.) coded the transcripts. Before the analysis
of the data, the raters met to discuss any discrepant codes until
consensus was met in regard to the final codes.Aquarter of the
data were double-coded to check for consistency, for which
there was >90% agreement between researchers (A.E.A. and
M.B.). To minimize the risk of bias, the prominence of main
themes and their respective subthemes was determined
through discussion between two authors. These authors read
the free-text comments and answers to open-ended questions
Ebn Ahmady et al 3
as well as reviewed all coded quotations for each theme.
Unanimity among the two coders was required. When una-
nimity was not achieved, comments were discussed until con-
sensus was reached. Quotes are presented in the results to
illustrate the themes and subthemes identified. To validate the
findings, first hand quotes are presented word-for-word within
the results in Table 2.13 Also, further evidence of validity was
obtained by comparing emergent finding with the literature.
The qualitative software QSR NVivo 11 was used to perform
content analysis of the themes derived from the comments.
Results
In total, 96.5% of participants completed the course evalua-
tions. A breakdown of the sample for each cohort appears in
Table 1. Participants were asked to select their professional dis-
cipline. Overall, 44% (n = 124) of the participants were nurses.
Respondents (n = 277 out of 287 participants) provided 690
comments through free-text comments and answers to open-
ended questions within the study questionnaires, describing
their satisfaction with their learning experience and sugges-
tions for improvement of the TEACH online Core Course.
Formative Evaluation
The five central themes identified from 349 comments within
the data are presented with their subthemes alongside quota-
tions as examples. Table 2 lists these themes in the following
categories: positive feedback and suggestions for improve-
ment. The overall focus of the study was on "suggestions for
improvement," and a high proportion of the comments (61%
of comments) provided feedback to improve the following
course areas: content of the course (20.4% of comments),
delivery system (17.8% of comments), evaluation of the
course (11.7% of comments), timing of the course (8.3% of
comments), and overall quality (2.6% of comments).
More general positive comments emerging from the data
(39% of comments) typically consisted of 1-word responses,
such as "good" or "excellent." Positive responses were
grouped into the following themes: overall quality (22.6% of
comments), content of the course (14% of comments), deliv-
ery method (1% of comments), timing of the course (0.6% of
comments), and evaluation of the course (0.3% of comments).
The majority of comments made by HCPs in the formative
evaluation were positive, expressing satisfaction with overall
course quality. Comments on course content and the delivery
method were identified as key areas for improvement. HCPs
also wanted the course designers to address problems with
content flow, repetition, and relevance of concepts.
Summative Evaluation
Five themes emerged from 341 of the participants' responses
to open-ended questions in the summative evaluation admin-
istered at the end of each course. The themes, subthemes, and
corresponding examples are shown in Table 3.
Theme 1: Learning objectives--23.5% of comments.Partici-
pants were asked to comment on one knowledge or skill they
learned the most about and were planning to use in their
clinical practice. Qualitative responses included the follow-
ing knowledge or skill areas: motivational interviewing,
pharmacological interventions, screening and assessing
tobacco use, developing treatment plans, harm reduction, the
global impact of tobacco use, advocacy and system-level
change, specific populations with high tobacco prevalence,
implementation, and facilitating smoking cessation groups.
The most commonly reported knowledge or skill areas were
motivational interviewing, pharmacological interventions,
and assessing tobacco use (7.8%, 4.2%, and 2.6% of com-
ments, respectively). These are aligned with the learning
objectives of the course.
Theme 2:Interprofessional collaboration and networking--12.1%
of comments. Participants generally had positive comments
in addition to suggestions for improvement related to oppor-
tunities for interprofessional collaboration and networking
during the course. Overall, only 5.4% of the comments under
this theme indicated participants were pleased to have oppor-
tunities to collaborate with fellow learners.
Theme 3:Future topics of relevance--8.2% of comments.When
we asked participants about future cessation topics of rele-
vance for professional development, they reported 11 con-
tent areas, respectively: (1) mental illness and substance use
disorders; (2) tobacco dependence treatment; (3) tobacco
cessation for women across the lifespan; (4) motivational
interviewing; (5) implementation; (6) harm reduction; (7)
advocacy and system-level change; (8) pharmacological
interventions; (9) tobacco interventions for youth and young
adults; (10) tobacco interventions for First Nations, Inuit,
and Métis populations; and (11) chronic disease prevention.
Also, other approaches to cessation related to working with
specific populations such as immigrant populations and older
adults were reported.
Theme 4: Overall modification--37.8% of comments. The par-
ticipants' perceptions regarding overall modifications to the
course were categorized into four subthemes: course content,
website function, course timing, and course support. A prom-
inent subtheme was course content (17.2% of comments).
This subtheme was attributed to less repetitive evaluation
surveys following modules, more lengthy and knowledge-
based quizzes, more videos, the incorporation of live webi-
nars to connect with participants and faculty, and more case
studies and interactive exercises to enhance skill
development.
For the website function subtheme (11.6% of comments),
participants reported some difficulties with loading the vid-
eos and navigating through the course content. Comments
regarding course timing and scheduling (6% of comments)
described the importance of revising the module timing to
make it flexible for HCPs with busy schedules (e.g., having
4 INQUIRY
all modules open at the same time). Participants also
requested continuous access to the course materials after the
completion of the course so that they could refer back to con-
tent and use it as a reference and resource in the future. The
final subtheme emerging under suggestions for improvement
was course support (3% of comments). Some participants
also commented that they were dissatisfied with the course
registration process.
Theme 5: Overall satisfaction--18.4% of comments. When we
asked participants about general comments regarding the
training provided, they typically responded positively with
1-word responses, such as "good" or "excellent." The central
subthemes emerging from this section included course use-
fulness, course support, web usability, and timing.
Many participants described how the design and the
delivery of the course content were useful which included
both static content (e.g., resources and readings) and interac-
tive content (e.g., videos, webinars, interprofessional col-
laboration, and quizzes). Course support also garnered
positive feedback highlighting participants' satisfaction with
course administrators. Web usability, including course
design, ease of navigation, and loading of webpages and vid-
eos, accounted for 1.7% of comments of overall satisfaction.
For example, a very small number of participants (0.2% of
comments) stated that they would have preferred taking this

 Course usefulness 44 (14.0) I thought the progression of the content of the course
was good, starting with clinical information about
nicotine and addiction, which grabbed my attention right
from the start
 Course support 9 (2.4) The support staff was very helpful when I had to delay
beginning the course for a week. I really appreciated
their help and understanding
 Web usability 16 (1.7) I liked the course structure--this is the first time I
completed an online course and it was easy to navigate
Timing 3 (0.3) It was really easy to set the time aside and was pretty
relaxing when I got down into the information

course in-person. Fewer comments for overall satisfaction
could be found under the timing subtheme (mentioned in 0.3
% of comments).
TEACH online Core Course content is iteratively updated
to incorporate the latest advances and evidence-based
approaches in tobacco cessation, in addition to HCPs' feed-
back. However, upon reviewing the results across the four
cohorts in 2015, there were a number of changes that needed
to be made to enhance the learner experience and align the
course with best practice approaches in adult learning. The
TEACH online Core Course has recently undergone a major
revision incorporating knowledge-based and case-based
quizzes, clinical video demonstrations, self-reflections,
opportunities to practice clinical skills through case studies,
and collaborative projects that require participants to work
together on activities in the online environment. Course fac-
ulty are now required to provide individual and customized
feedback on course assessments so that participants can
increase their awareness of knowledge and skill areas for fur-
ther improvement. Website design and functionality has been
addressed by providing further instructions regarding course
navigation, streamlining course content to reduce complex
navigation requirements, and ensuring that the course
content is functional across a number of website browsers.
This revised course was launched in July 2016, and evalua-
tion results are forthcoming.
Discussion
This study was initiated to demonstrate two goals and pro-
vides several important and novel findings. First, this phe-
nomenological study, through thematic analysis of 690
comments and emerging 10 main themes, highlights the
importance of employing a hybrid process of inductive and
deductive thematic analysis for formative and summative
qualitative evaluations, and also highlights the importance of
collecting qualitative feedback (in addition to quantitative
feedback) for program evaluation. This article provides a
comprehensive understanding of the TEACH Core Course
through qualitative analysis and evaluation. We found new
learning needs emerged during the course implementation
phase from the participants' perspective. Using a strong
qualitative evaluation for the TEACH online Core Course
allows us to advance learning objectives focused on tobacco
dependence treatment and implement research on education
outcomes and the features that improve them, which has also
8 INQUIRY
been demonstrated in a meta-analysis for the effectiveness of
online learning.1
Problem identification and needs assessment for the target
audience should be administered prior to curriculum develop-
ment; however, as learners might not fully know their needs
until exposed to the subject matter, and their needs may evolve
due to learner characteristics (e.g., discipline and years of
experience), recurrent needs assessments should be built into
course evaluations.14-17 These important steps have been con-
sidered through our formative and summative course evalua-
tions. Skeff et al18 have also noted that individuals often do not
fully appreciate their professional development needs until
they have been exposed to the subject area.
The current qualitative study could be considered as a
model for determining the success of educational programs
and used as a learner needs assessment to guide iterative
revisions to curriculum, the most important steps in the cur-
riculum development and evaluation process.17 Cronbach,
who is one of the pioneers of the quantitative method, stated
that a well-designed qualitative evaluation is important and
emphasized the significance of its application to determine
the success of educational programs.19
Second, the main themes emerging from this study are
based on the feedback provided by HCPs across four course
cohorts. Given the large sample size included in this qualita-
tive research coupled with a high response rate (96.5%), a
wide range of participant views were captured. This high
response rate demonstrates that online training and evalua-
tion can be deployed for HCPs without compromising learner
overall satisfaction. However, many of the HCPs who
responded to the qualitative evaluations may have had defi-
nite views regarding the course they completed (e.g., either a
positive or negative learning experience), and it is possible
that many of the participants who did not respond with quali-
tative comments either did not have suggestions for improve-
ment or did not feel comfortable sharing negative feedback.
This result also is consistent with past literature regarding
evaluating online training for HCPs.20
A total of 349 comments came from the formative evalu-
ations, and five themes emerged through an inductive
approach: (1) overall quality, (2) content, (3) evaluation, (4)
timing, and (5) delivery method. A total of 341 comments
came from the summative evaluations and were related to the
following five categories derived from a deductive approach:
(1) learning objectives, (2) interprofessional collaboration
and networking, (3) future topics of relevance, (4) overall
modification, and (5) overall satisfaction.
Nearly all of the positive comments elicited from the for-
mative evaluation were focused on the overall quality and
content of the modules, and more than 75% of the overall
satisfaction in the summative evaluation was related to the
course content. Our findings are consistent with earlier
research which indicated that learners give more feedback on
the overall quality and content of the curriculum than on
other course areas.14
Those participants who provided comments related to sug-
gestions for improvement in the formative evaluations were
looking for more knowledge-based quizzes and fewer repeti-
tive module evaluations at the end of each module. However,
completion of the module evaluation was not mandatory. Our
results confirm that participants would like to have more vid-
eos and live webinars to increase interactivity, a technical
solution for loading videos, more case studies and scenario-
based quizzes to check knowledge retention and application,
more opportunities for collaboration with fellow learners,
feedback from facilitators regarding knowledge and skills,
and for course designers to focus on troubleshooting issues
associated with video loading. Our results are consistent with
past literature indicating that a technology-mediated course
that matched learners' needs can facilitate understanding of
the subject.20-22 Several participants reported the usefulness of
course administrative support, believing that this was helpful
in addressing any technical or logistical issues in a respectful
and timely manner. In addition, many participants felt that
course discussion boards should be actively monitored by
facilitators to encourage proactive conversation and provide
further insight on the topics discussed by learners. This sup-
ports Boettcher's best practices23 for teaching online that
emphasize the importance of creating a supportive online
course community. In most online courses, the dialogue
between faculty and participants is supported through weekly
coaching and reminders. To enhance dialogue between par-
ticipants in our online course, we have since added weekly
live webinar sessions for enhanced interaction and problem
solving and have added in additional discussion boards for
reflective practice and coaching.
Participants also suggested that the course administrators
should open all the modules at once, remove time constraints
across the course (i.e., assignment deadlines), and continue
to keep the course accessible after it has ended so that they
can refer back to content and resources at a later date.
Providing training to HCPs that will enhance practice skills
can often be difficult given their competing clinical demands
and priorities.24 E-Learning can help address some of these
challenges by offering more flexible timelines, eliminating
travel, and offering a diverse learning environment without
compromising leaner satisfaction.20 A very small number of
HCPs stated that they would have preferred taking this
course in a classroom-based setting.
There are several limitations in this study. Participants
were not followed up with to elicit more information about
their comments. The analysis of free-text comments and
open-ended responses in this context did not allow for the
opportunity to probe respondents for further detail or expla-
nation.25 Our study did not collect demographic characteris-
tics such as gender and ethnicity; therefore, we cannot be
certain that our sample is reflective of the general Ontarian
HCP population. Despite its limitations, there are some valu-
able conclusions to be drawn from this study. HCPs find

treatment training. This article adds a new perspective to the
current literature regarding online courses in tobacco depen-
dence treatment for HCPs, presents a model to evaluate
effectiveness of online educational interventions, and pro-
vides tailored suggestions to improve online courses which
can be applied in other contexts.26 To complete the cycle of
quality improvement, these findings will inform future
course iterations' development and revisions. Tracking eval-
uation outcomes and learner feedback by developing a strong
evaluation component to online curricula allows educators to
advance the science of education and increase evaluative
research on education outcomes and the features that improve
them.1
Conclusion
Using a combined technique of inductive and deductive the-
matic analysis, this formative and summative qualitative
evaluation has highlighted an approach that demonstrates
rigor within a quality improvement research study. This pro-
cess made it possible to describe participants' satisfaction
with their learning experience. Areas of strength and needed
improvements of the online course have been examined from
the perspective of HCPs through qualitative feedback col-
lected across four course cohorts. Curriculum designers
should incorporate opportunities for monitoring and feed-
back by expert facilitators to foster a supportive online learn-
ing environment. CME providers should consider the
importance of collecting qualitative feedback from their par-
ticipants to elicit concrete and relevant suggestions to
improve the experience for future learners. This qualitative
evaluation approach can be replicated by other evaluation
scholars and can assist them in evaluating the effectiveness
of online educational interventions, in the context of CME
and beyond.
