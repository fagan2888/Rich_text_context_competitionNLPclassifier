Abstract
Previous research finds that marriage is associated with better health and lower mortality,
and one of the mechanisms underlying this association is health-related selection out of
marriage. Using longitudinal survey data from 2,348 couples from the Fragile Families and
Child Wellbeing Study, we examine whether certain health behaviors--smoking and binge
drinking--are associated with risk of union dissolution among couples with young children.
We use discrete time hazard models to test whether associations between health behaviors
and union dissolution differ between married and cohabiting parents. We find no statistically
significant association between binge drinking and union dissolution for either cohabiting or
married couples. Parental smoking, however, is associated with union dissolution. On aver-
age, married and cohabiting couples in which both parents smoke have a higher risk of
union dissolution than couples in which neither parent smokes. Additionally, father's smok-
ing (in couples in which the mother does not smoke) is associated with union dissolution, but
only for married couples. These findings illustrate the importance of considering the health
behaviors of both partners and provide further evidence of differences in union dissolution
dynamics between married and cohabiting couples.
Introduction
Married individuals are less likely to engage in certain risky behaviors with potentially negative
health consequences than unmarried individuals [1]. Empirical evidence suggests that mar-
riage causes individuals to change their health behaviors, including causing a reduction in
risky health behaviors, such as binge drinking and illegal drug use (see reviews in [2,3]). Previ-
ous research also suggests that engaging in certain health behaviors, such as heavy drinking, is
negatively associated with likelihood of entering marriage [4]. Health behaviors also impact
marital status by affecting social selection out of marriage [5]. Being married may cause indi-
viduals to participate in fewer risky health behaviors, but individuals who engage in risky
health behaviors are more likely to divorce than individuals who do not engage in these behav-
iors [5].

Risky health behaviors may be associated with union instability for a number of reasons.
First, such health behaviors may impede an individual's ability to enact normative family roles
[6], and individuals who cannot fulfill normative roles may be perceived as less desirable part-
ners. For example, frequent binge drinking may interfere with an individual's ability to parent
responsibly, placing children's safety at risk and/or causing the co-parent to shoulder more of
the caretaking responsibilities. The extent to which risky health behaviors interfere with family
role expectations may differ by gender, in part because norms about parenting differ by gen-
der. Many risky health behaviors are also more normative for men [7], and behaviors that are
more common may be perceived as less incompatible with gender-specific family norms.
Second, risky health behaviors may incur substantial short-term and long-term financial
costs or instability. In the short-term, some health behaviors may cause a partner to miss work
or lose employment, and the behavior itself may be expensive, as in the case of a cigarette
smoking habit or frequent bouts of heavy drinking. In the long-term, risky health behaviors
may impair health and cause serious morbidity or disability, potentially decreasing employ-
ment earnings and incurring high health care costs. Financial strain, in turn, might negatively
impact the quality of a couple's relationship [8].
Third, risky health behaviors may impact the quality and tone of interactions between part-
ners, perhaps especially in couples in which only one partner engages in the risky behavior.
Because risky health behavior may interfere with family roles, incur financial costs, and nega-
tively impact health, the partner who is not binge-drinking or smoking may try to exert social
control over the partner who is engaging in the risky behavior (see [1,9] regarding spousal
social control of health behavior). Attempts by one partner to monitor or sanction the other
partner's behavior might lead to conflict and a deterioration of relationship quality (for exam-
ple, [10] shows psychosocial effects of spousal diet control attempts).
Another possibility is that risky health behaviors are not themselves causally related to mar-
ital or union stability but rather are correlated with other characteristics that are associated
with union dissolution. For example, cigarette smoking is more common among less educated
adults in the United States, and education is an important predictor of marital stability in the
United States [11]. Some risky health behaviors--like binge drinking--are also associated with
particular health conditions, such as depressive symptoms [12], which previous research has
found are predictive of marital dissolution [13]. Risky health behaviors could also affect health
status, and it may be the resultant health conditions, not the risky behaviors per se, that impact
union stability. For example, previous research finds that poor self-rated health is associated
with union dissolution [14].
Psychosocial factors at the couple and individual levels might also produce non-causal asso-
ciations between health behaviors and union dissolution. For instance, if poor relationship
quality generates psychosocial stress, individuals in lower quality relationships might be more
likely to smoke, as previous research has found that stress is linked to smoking [15]. At the
individual level, personality characteristics such as neuroticism are associated with both smok-
ing behavior and marital quality [16,17].
Studies that have empirically examined the relationship between risky health behaviors and
marital dissolution have mixed findings. For example, in a sample pooling men and women
together, Collins, Ellickson, and Klein [18] find that frequency of alcohol intoxication is posi-
tively associated with risk of divorce among young, married individuals in the U.S. In contrast,
in a U.K. sample, Cheung [19] finds that harmful drinking is associated with increased likeli-
hood of being divorced for women, but not for men. Additionally, Cheung [19] finds that
women who were light smokers were significantly more likely than non-smokers to be
divorced ten years later, but among men, heavy smokers were significantly less likely than
non-smokers to be divorced. Fu and Goldman [5] also find a complicated pattern of results

regarding risky health behaviors and divorce, in a U.S. sample (that excluded blacks and His-
panics). On the whole, their findings suggest that smoking is positively associated with risk of
divorce for women and men, and that for men married longer than four years, moderate
drinking is negatively associated with divorce risk. Finally, another study finds that a "mis-
match" in alcohol use is associated with an increased likelihood of marital dissolution [20].
Among studies analyzing the association between health behaviors and future dissolution
risk, relatively few examine couples with children specifically. One exception [6] shows evi-
dence supportive of role incompatibility between parenthood and marijuana use, but does not
find statistically significant interactions between parental status and marijuana use in predict-
ing union dissolution. A more recent study by Tach and Edin (2013) [21] finds that among
couples with children, problematic drinking or drug use (i.e., that which interferes with work
or relationships) by mothers (but not fathers) is associated with higher likelihood of future
union dissolution, but only among married couples.
The prevalence of cohabiting relationships has risen dramatically over the past four decades
[22], and almost one-quarter of children are now born to unmarried cohabiting couples [23].
Given the importance of family stability to child wellbeing (e.g. [24,25]), it is particularly
important to understand whether risky health behaviors are associated with union stability
among parents. Relatively little research has examined whether the associations between risky
health behaviors and union stability are similar for married and cohabiting couples, and to our
knowledge, no study has explicitly analyzed how the associations of specific health behaviors
with union dissolution differ between married and cohabiting couples with young children.
Although marriage and cohabitation are both sexual co-residential relationships, there are
still notable differences between the two union types in the United States. These include differ-
ences in the legal rights and obligations of the partners, social and financial support from kin
[26,27], and norms about housework [28], pooling money [29], and parenting [30,31]. Addi-
tionally, cohabiting parents separate at a much higher rate than married parents [21]. These
differences may alter the associations between risky health behaviors and union stability.
In this article, we examine how health behaviors are associated with union dissolution for
married and cohabiting couples with children. Using nine years of data from the Fragile Fami-
lies and Child Wellbeing Study, a study of parents with children born in 1999 and 2000 who
live in urban areas in the United States, we examine the association between union stability
and two health behaviors: smoking and binge drinking. In contrast to earlier research on this
topic using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study [21,32], we examine spe-
cific measures of cigarette use and binge drinking among mothers and fathers. We investigate
three questions: 1) Are risky health behaviors (smoking and binge drinking) associated with
(future) union dissolution? 2) Do the associations of these health behaviors with union dissolu-
tion differ between married and cohabiting couples? 3) Do the associations between these
health behaviors and union dissolution differ by the gender of the partner engaging in the
behavior?
On the one hand, given the stronger norms for men's and women's behavior within the
institution of marriage, we might expect risky health behaviors to be more predictive of union
dissolution among married couples. Tach and Edin's (2013) [21] research, for example, sug-
gests that mothers' drinking or drug problems are predictive of union dissolution among
married couples, but not unmarried couples (in their analysis, this category included both
cohabiting and dating couples). On the other hand, cohabiting unions are more likely to dis-
solve than marriages, so to the extent that a risky health behavior produces strain within cou-
ples, we might expect this behavior to be more predictive of dissolution among cohabiting
unions.

Our expectations regarding gender differences in the associations between risky health
behaviors and union dissolution are more one-sided. Given gendered norms of parenting
behavior, and the incompatibility of risky health behaviors with supervising children, we
expect that mothers' risky health behaviors will be more predictive of union dissolution than
similar behavior by fathers.
We do not hold a priori expectations regarding whether binge drinking or smoking will be
more predictive of union dissolution. Both activities can incur a financial cost, which varies
according to frequency of engaging in the health behavior. Binge drinking could more severely
limit a parent's ability to supervise or transport children to school, activities, etc. Smoking,
however, could impact children's health via second-hand smoke exposure [33], potentially
interfering with expectations about good parenting.
Thus, the overall aim of this research is to analyze whether associations between health
behaviors and union dissolution differ by marital status, but we also explore differences by
gender and the specific health behavior examined. We achieve this objective by using discrete
time hazard models to examine risk of union dissolution among a sample of parents with
young children in U.S. urban areas. Our findings demonstrate the importance of considering
marital status, gender, and disaggregated health behavior measures in research connecting
health behavior to union dissolution.
Data and methods
Data
This analysis was deemed exempt by the IRB at the authors' university as it uses publicly avail-
able data. Our data come from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a birth cohort
study that includes around 5,000 children born in twenty large U.S. cities in 1999 and 2000.
The Fragile Families sample contains a larger number of cohabiting couples than is available
in many other datasets, as the study oversampled unmarried births. More details about the
sampling methodology are available in [34]. Readers should note that although these data are
not representative of the entire U.S. population, they are potentially informative regarding a
substantial segment of it; in the year 2000, 22% of all U.S. births and 29% of non-marital births
were in urban areas [35].
Another exceptional feature of the Fragile Families study is that both mothers and fathers
were interviewed, even if the parents were unmarried. (There are no mothers who report a
same-sex partner at the baseline wave of the study.) Thus, these data include a much larger
sample of cohabiting couples than most datasets with health information for both partners.
The baseline interviews were conducted shortly after the child's birth (usually while the mother
and infant were still in the hospital), and subsequent interviews were conducted 1 year, 3
years, 5 years, and 9 years later.
Because the same health behavior questions were not asked of both parents at the baseline
interview, we define the start of our observation window as the 1-year interview. Additionally,
the mothers' baseline survey asked about health behaviors during pregnancy, and associations
between health behaviors during pregnancy (when mothers' health behaviors may impact the
fetus) and union dissolution might differ from the associations at other points in the life course.
Because the start of our observation period is one year after the baseline interview, couples
whose unions dissolved by their child's first birthday are not included in our main sample. Of
the 4,898 families who participated in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study, 2,997
included couples in a residential union at the 1-year interview or, if they did not participate in
the 1-year interview, in a residential union at baseline. Of these families, our analytic sample
includes couples in which both partners participated in the 1-year interview (n = 2,348). We use

multiple imputation techniques (with twenty iterations) to address missing data on predictor
and covariate variables. Of our sample, 88.37% of couples had one or no predictor or control
variables with missing data. Most variables included in our analysis had relatively few missing
cases. Of the health behavior variables, all variables had 5 or fewer cases with missing values.
Variables. We measure marital status using a dichotomous indicator of whether the cou-
ple is married or in an unmarried, cohabiting union at the 1-year interview. Our outcome
measure is an indicator that the couple has separated between survey waves (i.e. between the 1
year and 3 year survey, between the 3 year and 5 year survey, or between the 5 and 9 year sur-
vey). We use mothers' reports when available and supplement with fathers' reports if the
mother did not participate in the interview wave.
We examine two health behaviors, each measured for both members of the couple at the
1-year interview when the child was approximately one year old. These behaviors are 1)
whether the respondent reported smoking cigarettes in the previous month (a dichotomous
variable); and 2) whether the respondent reports one or more days in the previous month on
which they drank five or more alcoholic beverages (a dichotomous variable). We distinguish
between indicators of mothers' and fathers' health behaviors. Unfortunately, questions about
binge drinking in later survey years are not directly comparable to the 1-year measure. Smok-
ing measures are more comparable across waves, but, because of a survey implementation
error, are not available at the 3-year interview for most parents. Given this limitation and the
fact that less than 15% of mothers and fathers change smoking behavior between the 1-year
and 5-year interviews, we use only the 1-year interview measures in our analysis.
For smoking, we construct a four-category smoking variable denoting the combination of
paternal and maternal smoking behavior at the 1-year interview. The categories include: nei-
ther parent smokes, mother smokes only, father smokes only, and both parents smoke. (Mater-
nal binge drinking is too rare to include the parallel measure for parental binge drinking in the
analysis.)
The full set of control variables includes variables previously found to be associated with
union dissolution (e.g. [11,21]). Mother's characteristics include age (measured using five cate-
gories), race/ethnicity (with variables indicating whether she is non-Hispanic white, non-His-
panic black, Hispanic, or other), mother's education (with variables indicating whether she has
less than a high school degree, high school, some college, or a college degree or more), her
childhood family structure (with a variable indicating whether she lived with both parents at
age 15), and whether she was previously married (an indicator variable). Father's characteris-
tics include measures of his involvement with the criminal justice system (an indicator of
whether he has a criminal record), his current or previous military enlistment (a variable indi-
cating military service), recent unemployment (measured with an indicator of whether he was
not working for three or more weeks in the year before the birth), and whether he was previ-
ously married (an indicator variable).
Couple-level characteristics include: the age difference between the mother and father;
whether the mother and father are of the same race/ethnicity (a variable indicating if they are
homogamous); whether either or both parents are immigrants (an indicator variable); whether
the mother has children with a previous partner (an indicator variable); whether the father has
children with a previous partner (an indicator variable); whether they have other shared chil-
dren together (an indicator variable); whether the couple considered abortion (coded yes if the
mother says that she considered it or the father suggested it); and whether the mother reports
that there was domestic violence in the relationship prior to the child's birth (an indicator
variable).
Controls for additional family characteristics include the following, operationalized as
dichotomous variables: whether the couple's infant has a serious health problem or disability,

whether the couple owns their home, whether their income in the year between their child's
birth and the 1-year interview was below the federal poverty level, and whether both members
of the couple attend religious services weekly. Additionally, we include two variables for union
duration at the time of the child's birth: a variable indicating that the couple had lived together
one year or less, and an indicator variable for whether they had lived together for five or more
years (with the reference category being couples who had lived together more than one year
but less than five years at the time of the birth).
Analysis
We use discrete time hazard models to analyze the association between health behaviors (as
reported at the 1-year interview) and risk of union dissolution. The event outcome we model
is union dissolution, defined as a married or cohabiting couple ceasing to live together. We
assess this outcome at three points in time: the 3-year interview, the 5-year interview, and
9-year interview. Our unit of analysis is the couple, and each couple contributes an observation
to our sample for each period at which they are at risk of separating, leading to a total of 5,811
observations. Couples in which a partner dies are treated as censored at the first wave that the
death is reported, and are not included in the analysis at later waves. For couples in which nei-
ther partner completed an interview at a particular wave, we treat relationship status as cen-
sored for that particular wave and do not follow the couple at later waves.
Our modeling strategy is similar to that of Tach and Edin [21], and our first model, Model
1, can be represented using the following equation:

In this model, Pit
represents the probability of union dissolution for couple i during discrete
time period t, conditional on the couple being at risk of union dissolution during this period
[21]. In this model specification, Period is a categorical variable that indicates to which of the
three discrete measurement periods (between the 1-year and 3-year surveys, between the
3-year and 5-year surveys, or between the 5-year and 9-year surveys) couple i belongs at wave
t. We do not include an intercept term in these regression models, so no one time period is
treated as the reference period. Rather, the coefficient for each period represents the log odds
of dissolution during that period when controlling for the other variables in the model. Marital
status, parental smoking, and parental binge drinking do not vary within couples over time, as
they are all measured at the 1-year interview. The 2
coefficient represents the difference in log
odds of dissolution between married and cohabiting couples for the period between the 1-year
and 3-year surveys. 3
captures interactions between marital status and period, demonstrating
how differences in log odds of dissolution between married and cohabiting couples change
over time. Associations of parental smoking variables with log odds of dissolution are captured
by 4
, and associations of parental binge drinking variables with dissolution are represented by
5
.
In the second model specification (Model 2), we add interactions between the health behav-
ior variables and marital status. In Model 3, we add the full set of control characteristics. (We
checked for evidence of multi-collinearity among the control variables; we find no indication
of such a problem.)
To aid interpretation of the substantive meaning of key coefficients, we calculate predicted
probabilities of union dissolution. These probabilities are calculated for a couple with the refer-
ence values for the control characteristics (e.g., non-Hispanic white mother with a high school

degree), except for the following: the mother lived with both parents in childhood, the parents
are of the same race and ethnicity, and the age difference between parents is two years.
Results
There are substantial differences in the demographic characteristics and resources of cohabit-
ing and married couples, as well as in their risk factors for separation (see S1 Table). Table 1
shows rates of separation by relationship type. More than half of cohabiting couples split up
during the observation window compared with approximately one-quarter of married couples.
This higher rate of union dissolution among cohabiting couples is not unique to our sample;
national data also show short union durations for cohabitors [36].
Notably, health behaviors differ by gender and relationship type. Almost one-third of
cohabiting mothers and one-half of cohabiting fathers reported smoking compared to approx-
imately 15% of married mothers and one-quarter of married fathers. Binge drinking is rare
among mothers, but is more common among fathers.
The results in Table 2 show how binge drinking and smoking associate with union dissolu-
tion. In Model 1, couples in which only the mother smokes, only the father smokes, or both
parents smoke have higher odds of union dissolution, on average, than couples in which nei-
ther parent smokes. With regard to binge drinking, Model 1 shows no association between
maternal or paternal binge drinking and union dissolution.
When we add interactions between parental health behavior variables and marital status in
Model 2, the coefficients for maternal smoking (only), paternal smoking (only), and both
parents smoking remain statistically significant. Interactions of marital status with paternal
smoking (only) and both parents smoking are statistically significant. We do not find statisti-
cally significant interactions between marital status and paternal or maternal binge drinking.
In Table 3, we show the results for Model 3, which includes the full set of control covariates.
As in Models 1 and 2, Model 3 shows no associations between binge drinking and union disso-
lution for either cohabiting or married parents. With regard to smoking, the main coefficients

for paternal and maternal smoking lose statistical significance. However, paternal smoking
continues to interact with marital status (OR = 1.64, p < .05). The predicted probability of
union dissolution between the 1 and 3 year interviews for married couples with the reference
characteristics is .10 for couples in which the father (only) smokes compared with .05 for cou-
ples in which neither parent smokes. In Model 3, the main coefficient for both parents smok-
ing maintains statistical significance (OR = 1.38, p < .05), but notably, the interaction of both
parents smoking with marital status is not statistically significant. This shows that both parents
smoking is equally predictive of union dissolution for married and cohabiting couples. For a
cohabiting reference couple in which neither parent smokes, the probability of union dissolu-
tion between the 1-year and 3-year interviews is .16; for a couple with the same characteristics,
this probability increases to .20 if both parents smoke.
Supplementary analyses and robustness checks
Relationship quality may mediate the associations between health behaviors and union disso-
lution. To investigate this, we check whether the inclusion of a variable for poor relationship
quality at the child's birth (based on mother's responses to items that comprise a supportive-
ness scale) alters our findings about the associations between health behaviors and union dis-
solution; it does not.

Health behaviors and union dissolution among parents of young children
PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0182628 August 10, 2017 9 / 15
Given that maternal health behaviors during pregnancy may impact fetal health, we investi-
gate whether having a child with a health problem or disability is a mechanism through which
maternal health behaviors impact union stability. We check whether excluding the variable
indicating a child health problem from our models modifies our main findings; it does not.
Moreover, excluding couples who have a child with a health problem from the analysis also
does not change our main findings.
In alternative model specifications, we include measures of each parent's self-rated health
and whether the parent exhibits high levels of (untreated) depressive symptoms using the
shortened form of the CES-D checklist. Inclusion of these variables does not meaningfully
change the associations between health behaviors and union dissolution. This suggests that the
statistically significant associations we find between smoking and union dissolution are not
spurious relationships caused by associations of self-rated health or depression with either the
main predictors (smoking and binge drinking) or outcome variable (union dissolution). Inter-
estingly, these results also suggest that self-rated health and depressive symptoms do not medi-
ate the associations we find between smoking and union dissolution.
The beginning of our observation period is the 1-year interview, and some unions dissolved
between the child's birth and the 1-year interviews. To explore the selectivity of our sample, we
examine the distribution of baseline health behaviors among all couples married or cohabiting
at the child's birth, disaggregated by whether the couple is included in our sample. The health
behavior measures available at the baseline interview are not directly comparable to the mea-
sures we use in our main analysis, but provide information about possible selection. The
results of this analysis are presented in S2 Table, and they provide some evidence of selection
into our analytic sample on maternal and paternal smoking behavior. Among married couples,
those in our sample are less likely to include mothers that smoked during pregnancy or fathers
that smoked in the three months prior to the baseline interview. Given that couples in which
mothers or fathers smoked are more likely to select out of our sample, it is possible that our
main findings underestimate the association of smoking behaviors with union dissolution.

In an additional supplemental analysis, we run separate models for married and cohabiting
couples; we do this because of evidence that the predictors of union dissolution are different
for cohabiting and marital unions [21,37]. Our conclusions from these analyses parallel those
from the models that include marital status interactions with health behaviors.
We also check whether our results are robust to using the couple's relationship status at the
child's birth instead of at the start of our observation period (the 1-year interview). Consistent
with our main analyses, findings from the Model 3 specification of this set of analyses show
that couples in which both parents smoke and married couples in which the father (only)
smokes have increased odds of union dissolution. In contrast to our main analyses (which use
marital status at 1 year), this analysis also shows a statistically significant interaction term
between maternal smoking and marital status (OR = 2.00, p < .05). This suggests that married
couples in which the mother smokes have increased odds of union dissolution, but the same
association does not hold for cohabiting mothers who smoke.
Finally, we check whether associations between health behaviors and union dissolution
differ between couples cohabiting at the 1-year interview that later marry (n = 327) and cohab-
iting couples that do not marry during our observation period. Among couples that are cohab-
iting at the 1-year interview, we do not find statistically significant interactions of marrying in
subsequent years with maternal smoking, paternal smoking, or paternal binge drinking. We
may be underpowered to detect such interactions if they are small in magnitude. (Because of
the small number of mothers who binge drink, we are unable to explore interactions between
marrying and maternal binge drinking.)
Discussion
Risky health behaviors might negatively affect individuals' well-being and decrease the well-
being of their partners and their children. In this paper, we investigate whether smoking or
binge drinking among urban couples with a young child are associated with higher risk of
future union dissolution. We expected that these health behaviors would be associated with an
increased risk of union dissolution, as they might interfere with an individual's ability to be a
good partner or parent, and might incur substantial financial costs. We also posited that a
"mismatch" between partners in risky health behaviors might cause conflict or strain that
would lead to increased risk of dissolution. Previous research and theory suggest that the asso-
ciations of these health behaviors with union dissolution might vary by the marital status of
the couple and the gender of the partner engaging in the behavior.
In our analysis, we find that couples in which both parents smoke have an increased risk of
union dissolution, and this increased risk does not differ by marital status. This finding is
inconsistent with what we would expect if the "mismatch" hypothesis fully held. Additionally,
this finding demonstrates the importance of considering dyadic pairings of health behaviors
when predicting union dissolution, as opposed to examining each partner's health behaviors
in isolation from the other partner.
We also find evidence suggestive of gender differences in the relationships between smok-
ing, marital status, and union dissolution. Notably, we do not find evidence in support of our
expectation regarding the direction of gender differences; maternal smoking was not more
predictive of union dissolution than paternal smoking. Instead, we find that married couples
in which only the father smokes have an increased risk of union dissolution; however, the asso-
ciation between paternal smoking and dissolution risk does not hold for cohabiting couples.
The fact that a "mismatch" in parental smoking behavior is predictive of dissolution only
among married couples and only when the smoking parent is the father suggests that the

mechanism linking paternal smoking to union dissolution might not be a "mismatch" per se,
but rather gendered family dynamics surrounding health behaviors.
One potential explanation for our finding that married fathers' smoking is particularly
predictive of union dissolution relates to partner social control of health behaviors. Prior
research suggests that for men, being married is associated with a higher frequency of receiving
health behavior social control from others [9]. Married men are also more likely than married
women to report their partner (or ex-partner) as the person that most frequently performs
such social control in their life [9]. If attempts at socially controlling a partner's risky health
behaviors are associated with relationship discord and union instability, our pattern of find-
ings would be consistent with the gendered patterns of social control documented by previous
research. Future research might examine whether cohabiting and married couples differ in
gendered efforts to socially control health behavior, whether these efforts are more likely
among couples in which only one partner engages in a particular risky health behavior, and
how such efforts impact relationship quality.
We find no evidence that binge drinking is associated with union dissolution for either
married or cohabiting parents. However, given the small number of mothers who binge drink
in our sample, it is possible that our analysis is underpowered to detect associations among
this group.
In further analyses, we explored possible mechanisms linking health behaviors to union dis-
solution, including relationship quality, self-rated health, and depression. We did not find any
evidence that these account for the associations between smoking and union dissolution.
Future research should investigate whether the association of smoking with union dissolution
is spurious and generated by correlation with factors not captured by the Fragile Families
Study, such as measures of personality dimensions or stress, that are associated with marital
quality [15­17,38].
Our analysis focuses on parents who live in urban areas. Parents in U.S. cities are more
racially diverse than parents not residing in cities. Cohabiting and married couples in urban
areas may also differ from their less urban or rural counterparts on non-demographic charac-
teristics. Thus, findings based on this sample may not generalize to the population of all
parents in the U.S. This limitation is compensated for by the availability of health behavior
information from both partners in the Fragile Families data, which is not typical for studies in
this field [39]. Additionally, these data contain a larger number of cohabiting couples (over
1,000) than what most nationally representative datasets include.
In conclusion, our findings make two important contributions to the existing scholarly lit-
erature. First, consistent with previous research, we find that certain risky health behaviors are
associated with romantic union dissolution. Like previous research, we find a somewhat com-
plicated pattern of associations, with differences by the specific behavior examined (i.e., smok-
ing versus binge drinking), by the gender of the partner engaging in the behavior, and by the
marital status of the couple. Future research might fruitfully examine the precise mechanisms
explaining why these associations differ across population subgroups. Second, our finding of
differences in the association between smoking and dissolution by marital status adds to the
growing body of research continuing to find differences in union dynamics between married
and cohabiting couples, suggesting that marriage and cohabitation are still distinct family
forms in the United States.
