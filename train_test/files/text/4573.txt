in laparoscopic surgery
Shao-hua Liu and Ming Tian
Abstract
Objective: This study was performed to analyse factors influencing the effect-site concentration
(Ce) of propofol at return of consciousness (ROC) with target-controlled infusion of propofol­
remifentanil after laparoscopic surgery.
Methods: In total, 112 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery under general anaesthesia
were given propofol at the target concentration of 3.5 mg/ml. Remifentanil (Ce: 4.0 ng/ml) and
0.9 mg/kg of rocuronium were administered when the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/
Sedation score reached 1. Two minutes after injection of rocuronium, tracheal intubation was
initiated. The bispectral index (BIS) was maintained between 45 and 55.
Results: Ce values of propofol at loss of consciousness (LOC) and ROC were significantly
correlated. Age was significantly correlated with Ce of propofol at ROC. At LOC, propofol Ce values
of patients aged 65­80, 45­64, and 20­44 years were 1.8 Æ 0.8, 2.2 Æ 0.7, and 2.3 Æ 0.8 mg/ml,
respectively, and the BIS was 70Æ 10, 68Æ 7, and 69Æ 10, respectively. At ROC, the propofol Ce
values of the three groups were 1.2 Æ 0.3, 1.4 Æ 0.3, and 1.5 Æ 0.3 mg/ml, respectively, and the BIS was
80Æ 5, 82Æ 6, and 83Æ 6, respectively.
Conclusions: The concentration of propofol at ROC was significantly affected by age, and ROC of
propofol­remifentanil anaesthesia after laparoscopic surgery was well predicted by the concen-
tration at LOC.

return of consciousness (ROC) after surgery.1
The propofol dose for adequate ROC can
be obtained by predicting its effect-site con-
centration (Ce), which can also reduce
the workload of anaesthesiologists, save
resources and time, and render recovery
safer.2 The propofol Ce values at ROC
from anaesthesia have a wide range (0.8­
2.7 mg/mL)3,4; therefore, it is rather difficult
to predict the minimum concentration for
effective sedation. Laparoscopic surgery,
which is minimally invasive, has been
widely used in clinical practice. The propo-
fol Ce at ROC after laparoscopic surgery
or during total intravenous anaesthesia
remains unknown. Therefore, the present
prospective clinical study was performed to
analyse the factors influencing the propofol
Ce at ROC with target-controlled infusion
(TCI) of propofol­remifentanil after laparo-
scopic surgery.
Materials and methods
Selection of patients and study
preparation
The present study included 112 patients with
an American Society of Anesthesiologists
physical status of 1 to 3 and age of 20 to
80 years who underwent laparoscopic colon
surgery or nephrectomy under general anaes-
thesia. The study was approved by the ethics
committee of our hospital, and written con-
sent was obtained from all patients.
The exclusion criteria were a body mass
index of 18 or ! 30 kg/m2, hearing loss or
other neurological deficits, history of mental
disorders and renal or hepatic disease, recent
administration of opioids or sedatives, drug
addiction, and intraoperative blood loss
of > 800 ml.
Before surgery, the patients were fasted
for 8 h and given no premedication. Routine
monitoring was applied after they entered
the operating room. The arterial blood
pressure was continuously monitored by
inserting a 20-gauge plastic cannula into
the radial artery, and drugs and fluid were
intravenously administered by inserting an
18-gauge catheter into an upper limb vein.
After 10 min of stabilization, the baseline
blood pressure and heart rate were detected.
The forehead skin was then sterilized with
75% ethanol, and the bispectral index (BIS)
was recorded with an A-2000 BIS Monitor
(XP Version; Aspect Medical Systems,
Natick, MA, USA). Prior to drug adminis-
tration, 5 ml/kg of lactated Ringer's solution
was intravenously administered at an infu-
sion rate of 7 ml/kg per min.
Propofol was given through TCI by a
motor-driven syringe pump (Graseby 3500;
Smiths Medical International, Watford,
UK) with a TCI system (Diprifusor;
AstraZeneca, Cambridge, UK) containing
the modified Marsh's pharmacokinetic
model. This system can predict the Ce of
propofol.5,6 The model for remifentanil was
proposed by Minto et al.7,8
The depths of sedation and anaesthesia
were assessed using a modified Observer's
Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S)
scale (Table 1)9 once every 15 s. When the
OAA/S score reached 1, remifentanil (Ce:
4.0 ng/ml) and 0.9 mg/kg of rocuronium

were intravenously administered. Two min-
utes after intravenous injection of rocuro-
nium, tracheal intubation was initiated,
after which ventilation was mechanically
controlled with 100% oxygen to keep the
end-tidal carbon dioxide tension at 35 to
45 mmHg. The BIS was maintained at 45 to
55 throughout surgery by adjusting the
propofol Ce. The infusion of propofol and
remifentanil was stopped at the end of
surgery. ROC was defined when an OAA/S
score of 3 was reached.
Detection of variables
The Ce, mean arterial pressure, and heart
rate were recorded at eight time points: at
baseline before induction (T0), at achieve-
ment of an OAA/S score of 1 [loss of
consciousness (LOC)], immediately before
intubation (T2), immediately after intubation
(T3), 3 min after intubation (T4), 2 min after
establishment of pneumoperitoneum (T5),
before termination of infusion (T6), and at
ROC. The BIS was recorded 5 s after each
time point. All variables were detected by the
same anaesthesiologist to minimize bias.
Statistical analysis
All data were analysed using SPSS version
11.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The
normality of all continuous data was tested
with the Kolmogorov­Smirnov method.
The correlations between clinical variables
and ROC were evaluated using linear cor-
relation analysis. Comparisons among three
groups were conducted with one-way ana-
lysis of variance. Multiple comparisons of
inter-individual data were carried out by
Friedman's repeated-measures analysis of
variance on ranks with Tukey's all pairwise
comparison method. A P value of < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.
Results
The duration of propofol infusion was
108.3 Æ 53.5 min. The propofol Ce, remifen-
tanil Ce, BIS, mean arterial pressure, and
heart rate at eight time points are summar-
ized in Table 2. Table 3 lists the data
and correlation coefficients between the
propofol Ce at ROC and clinical variables.
The propofol Ce at ROC was significantly
correlated with that at LOC, at discontinu-
ation of infusion, and age.

Relationship between propofol Ce at ROC
and age
Linear regression analysis suggested that the
propofol Ce at ROC was significantly
correlated with age. The regression equation
was: Ceroc
¼ À0.013age þ 2.101 (mg/ml) (r ¼
À0.622, P < 0.01) (Figure 2).
The propofol Ce at LOC was negatively
correlated with age. The equation was:
Ceroc
¼ À0.029age þ 3.431 (mg/ml) (r ¼
À0.601, P < 0.01) (Figure 3).
Allocation of patients
The patients in Group Y (20­44 years old,
n ¼ 27), Group M (45­64 years old, n ¼ 37),
and Group O (65­80 years old, n ¼ 48) had a
similar weight, height, preanaesthetic BIS,
sex ratio, temperature at the end of surgery,
duration of surgery, and duration of anaes-
thesia (Table 4).
Clinical responsiveness, BIS, propofol Ce,
and variables
The BIS values of the three groups at LOC
were similar. The propofol Ce of Group L
was significantly lower than that of Groups
Z and Q (P ¼ 0.032 and 0.024, respectively),
but the latter two groups had similar Ce
values (P ¼ 0.082). Group L took signifi-
cantly less time to lose consciousness than
did Groups Z and Q (P < 0.05).

The BIS values of the three groups at
ROC were also similar. The propofol Ce of
Group L was significantly lower than that of
Groups Z and Q (P ¼ 0.008 and 0.005,
respectively). Group L had a significantly
lower total propofol dose than Groups Z
and Q (P < 0.05) and took significantly more
time to recover from anaesthesia (P < 0.05)
(Table 5).
The BIS values at LOC and ROC were
positively correlated, but the correlation
coefficient was not high (correlation equa-
tion: BISROC

0.266, P < 0.05).
Discussion
In this study, we analysed the factors that
affected the propofol Ce at ROC with TCI
of propofol­remifentanil after laparoscopic
surgery. Iwakiri et al.10 reported that the
propofol Ce at ROC was significantly
correlated with the Ce at LOC, but they
did not describe a related analysis or equa-
tion. In the present study, we found that the
propofol Ce at ROC was negatively corre-
lated with age and positively correlated with
the Ce at LOC.
The propofol Ce values of Groups L, Z,
and Q were 1.8 Æ 0.8, 2.2 Æ 0.7, and
2.3 Æ 0.8 mg/ml, respectively. The oldest
group had a significantly lower propofol
Ce. Similarly Servin11 reported that 1.69 Æ
0.50 mg/ml of propofol was required for their
TCI group at LOC. Ouattara et al.12 rec-
ommended decreasing the propofol concen-
tration and dosage for elderly patients and
using the same dose of remifentanil. Based
on this recommendation, remifentanil at a
Ce of 4 ng/ml was used during anaesthetic
induction and maintenance in the present
study. As indicated by the hemodynamic
indices during induction, maintenance, and
recovery, the analgesic effects indeed met the
requirements of laparoscopic surgery.
In addition, the propofol Ce values at
ROC in Groups L, Z, and Q were 1.2 Æ 0.3,
1.4 Æ 0.3, and 1.5 Æ 0.3 mg/ml, respectively,
and their recovery times were 819 Æ 286,
712 Æ 228, and 648 Æ 232 s, respectively. In
other words, older patients had a signifi-
cantly lower propofol Ce at ROC, and their
recovery time was markedly prolonged, with
the longest being > 16 min. Similarly, Vuyk
et al.13 found that younger patients recov-
ered more easily from anaesthesia than did
older patients and that sudden awakening
had the potential to cause body movement
or even injury. Older patients often recover
more slowly than do younger patients. Thus,

older patients, especially sensitive ones,
should be closely monitored during post-
operative recovery to avoid low ventilation,
respiratory depression, and other sleep-
induced complications. Based on the results
in the present study, if the recovery time and
concentration can be predicted according to
the concentration of propofol given to
patients when they lose consciousness and
stop using drugs, the depth of anaesthesia
can be adjusted on an individual-patient
basis, thereby allowing timely recovery and
precise anaesthesia.
Nevertheless, the BIS values of older and
young patients at LOC or ROC were not
significantly different, indicating that older
patients were more sensitive to propofol and
that the BIS was more closely correlated
with other clinical indices. The BIS did not
reflect the susceptibility of patients to drugs,
as reported previously.14
This study had several limitations. The
main limitation is that the concentration of
propofol when the infusion was stopped was
read from the infusion pump and in most
cases was 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, or 3.5mg/ml. Therefore,
the data were non-normally distributed. This
could be circumvented by drawing venous
blood at different time points to detect the
plasma concentration. Moreover, a wider
variety of surgery types should be evaluated
in future studies, which will show differences
in surgical times, intraoperative blood loss,
and body temperature.
ROC from propofol­remifentanil anaes-
thesia after laparoscopic surgery was well
predicted by the propofol concentration at
LOC. The patient's age and propofol con-
centration were significantly correlated with
the time point at which ROC occurred. Older
patients had a lower propofol concentration
during recovery than did young patients.
