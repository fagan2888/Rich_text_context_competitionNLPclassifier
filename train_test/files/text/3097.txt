NEARLY HALF OF COMMUNITY-
dwelling persons aged 60
years and older express con-
cern about declining men-
tal abilities.1 Although there is substan-
tial evidence that many cognitive
abilities and processes are related to
measures of functional status, need for
care, and quality of life, few studies have
addressed whether improving cogni-
tive functions might have short- or
long-term effects on activities related
to living independently. Interventions
designed to delay or prevent the need
for nursing homes, home care, and hos-
pital stays can save health care costs,
while also ensuring the independence
and dignity of the aging population.
A growing body of research sup-
ports the protective effects of late-life
intellectual stimulation on incident
dementia.2,3 Recent research from both
human and animal studies indicates
that neural plasticity endures across
the lifespan, and that cognitive stimu-
lation in the environment is an impor-
tant predictor of enhancement and
maintenance of cognitive functioning,

Context Cognitive function in older adults is related to independent living and need
for care. However, few studies have addressed whether improving cognitive functions
might have short- or long-term effects on activities related to living independently.
Objective To evaluate whether 3 cognitive training interventions improve mental
abilities and daily functioning in older, independent-living adults.
Design Randomized, controlled, single-blind trial with recruitment conducted from
March 1998 to October 1999 and 2-year follow-up through December 2001.
Setting and Participants Volunteer sample of 2832 persons aged 65 to 94 years
recruited from senior housing, community centers, and hospital/clinics in 6 metropoli-
tan areas in the United States.
Interventions Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: 10-session group
training for memory (verbal episodic memory; n=711), or reasoning (ability to solve prob-
lems that follow a serial pattern; n=705), or speed of processing (visual search and iden-
tification; n=712); or a no-contact control group (n=704). For the 3 treatment groups,
4-session booster training was offered to a 60% random sample 11 months later.
Main Outcome Measures Cognitive function and cognitively demanding every-
day functioning.
Results Thirty participants were incorrectly randomized and were excluded from the
analysis. Each intervention improved the targeted cognitive ability compared with base-
line, durable to 2 years (P.001 for all). Eighty-seven percent of speed-, 74% of rea-
soning-, and 26% of memory-trained participants demonstrated reliable cognitive im-
provement immediately after the intervention period. Booster training enhanced training
gains in speed (P.001) and reasoning (P.001) interventions (speed booster, 92%;
no booster, 68%; reasoning booster, 72%; no booster, 49%), which were main-
tained at 2-year follow-up (P.001 for both). No training effects on everyday func-
tioning were detected at 2 years.
Conclusions Results support the effectiveness and durability of the cognitive train-
ing interventions in improving targeted cognitive abilities. Training effects were of a
magnitude equivalent to the amount of decline expected in elderly persons without
dementia over 7- to 14-year intervals. Because of minimal functional decline across all
groups, longer follow-up is likely required to observe training effects on everyday function.

even in old age. Moreover, sustained en-
gagement in cognitively stimulating ac-
tivities has been found to impact neural
structure in both older humans and ro-
dents.4-6 Conversely, limited education
has been found to be a risk factor for de-
mentia.7 There is also a sizeable body of
literature documenting that different
typesofcognitivetrainingprogramshave
large and durable effects on the cogni-
tive functioning of older adults, even in
advanced old age.8-15 At the same time,
several important issues remain under-
studied. First, prior cognitive training
studies with older adults have often paid
relatively little attention to the use of ap-
propriate control groups, the represen-
tativeness or heterogeneity of partici-
pants, the generalizability of training
findings beyond particular laborato-
ries,oradherenceofparticipantstotrain-
ing protocols. For example, it has not
been uncommon for such studies to
analyze only compliant participants.
Second, the broader implications of
training on daily functioning in older
adults, for the most part, have not been
studied.
The primary objective of the
ACTIVE (Advanced Cognitive Train-
ing for Independent and Vital Elderly)
trial was to test the effectiveness and
durability of 3 distinct cognitive inter-
ventions in improving the performance
of elderly persons on basic measures of
cognition and on measures of cogni-
tively demanding daily activities (eg,
food preparation, driving, medication
use, financial management). These
interventions previously had been
found successful in improving cogni-
tive abilities under laboratory or small-
scale field conditions.8-16 We hypoth-
esized that the effects of cognitive
training on primary outcomes will be
largely mediated through the basic
cognitive abilities being trained. The
detailed hypotheses may be summa-
rized by 2 points: each training group
will perform better than the other
training and control groups on their
respective primary and proximal out-
comes, and those groups that received
booster training will perform better
than those that did not receive booster
training on their primary and proximal
outcomes.
METHODS
Participants
The recruitment goal for the ACTIVE
trial was to enroll a diverse sample of
older adults who, at enrollment, were
living independently in good func-
tional and cognitive status. Recruit-
ment was conducted from March 1998
to October 1999; 2-year follow-up data
were collected through December 2001.
Details of the recruitment procedures
have been published elsewhere.17 Par-
ticipants aged 65 to 94 years were en-
rolled across 6 field sites using a vari-
ety of sampling frames and recruitment
strategies (state driver's license and
identification card registries, medical
clinic rosters, senior center and com-
munity organization rosters, senior
housing sites, local churches, and ros-
ters of assistance and service pro-
grams for low-income elderly per-
sons). Oral assent was obtained for brief
telephone screening, and written in-
formed consent was obtained in per-
son from each potential participant
prior to administration of in-person
screening measures.
Persons were excluded from partici-
pationiftheywereyoungerthan65years
at screening; if they had already expe-
rienced substantial cognitive decline
(score of 22 on the Mini-Mental State
Examination [MMSE]18); had a self-
reported diagnosis of Alzheimer dis-
ease; had already experienced substan-
tialfunctionaldecline(self-reportedneed
for weight-bearing support or full care-
giver performance of dressing, per-
sonal hygiene, or bathing 3 or more
times in the previous 7 days); had medi-
cal conditions that would predispose
them to imminent functional decline or
death (eg, stroke within the past 12
months, certain cancers, or current che-
motherapy or radiation treatment for
cancer); had recent cognitive training;
were unavailable during the testing and
intervention phases of the study; or had
severe losses in vision (self-reported
difficulty in reading newsprint, or
measured vision worse than 20/70 with
best correction), hearing (interviewer-
rated), or communicative ability (inter-
viewer-rated)thatwouldsufficientlyim-
pair performance to make participation
impossible.
Study Design
The study protocol was approved by the
institutional review boards at the Uni-
versity of Alabama at Birmingham;
Wayne State University, Detroit, Mich;
the Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for
the Aged, Roslindale, Mass; the Johns
Hopkins University School of Medi-
cine, Baltimore, Md; Indiana Univer-
sity, Bloomington; Purdue University,
Indianapolis, Ind; Pennsylvania State
University, University Park; the Uni-
versity of Florida, Gainesville; and the
New England Research Institutes, Wa-
tertown, Mass.
The ACTIVE trial was sponsored by
the National Institute on Aging and the
National Institute of Nursing Research,
and was randomized, controlled, and
single-blind, using a 4-group design,
including a no-contact control group
and 3 intervention groups (memory
training, reasoning training, or speed-
of-processing training). These 3 inter-
ventions were selected because they
showed the most promise in smaller
laboratory studies and had been related
to instrumental activities of daily liv-
ing (IADL).8,19-26 Each intervention
group received a 10-session interven-
tion,conductedbycertifiedtrainers,for
1 of 3 cognitive abilities--memory,
inductive reasoning, or speed of pro-
cessing. Assessors were blinded to par-
ticipantinterventionassignment.Train-
ing exposure and social contact were
standardized across interventions so
that each intervention served as a con-
tact control for the other 2 interven-
tions. Booster training was provided to
a random subsample in each interven-
tion group. Measurement points con-
sisted of baseline tests, an immediate
posttest (following the intervention),
and 1 and 2 annual posttests.
Interventions
The interventions were conducted in
small group settings in ten 60- to 75-

minute sessions over 5- to 6-week
periods. These were behavioral inter-
ventions with no pharmacological com-
ponent. In all 3 conditions, sessions 1
through 5 focused on strategy instruc-
tion and individual and group exer-
cises to practice the strategy. Sessions
6 through 10 provided additional prac-
tice exercises but introduced no new
strategies.
Memory training12,27-29 focused on
verbal episodic memory. Participants
were taught mnemonic strategies for re-
membering word lists and sequences
of items, text material, and main ideas
and details of stories. Participants re-
ceived instruction in a strategy or mne-
monic rule, exercises, individual and
group feedback on performance, and a
practice test. For example, partici-
pants were instructed how to organize
word lists into meaningful categories
and to form visual images and mental
associations to recall words and texts.
The exercises involved laboratory-
like memory tasks (eg, recalling a list
of nouns, recalling a paragraph), as well
as memory tasks related to cognitive ac-
tivities of everyday life (eg, recalling a
shopping list, recalling the details of a
prescription label).
Reasoning training10,13 focused on the
ability to solve problems that follow a
serial pattern. Such problems involve
identifying the pattern in a letter or
number series or understanding the pat-
tern in an everyday activity such as pre-
scription drug dosing or travel sched-
ules. Participants were taught strategies
to identify a pattern and were given an
opportunity to practice the strategies in
both individual and group exercises.
The exercises involved abstract reason-
ing tasks (eg, letter series) as well as rea-
soning problems related to activities of
daily living.
Speed-of-processing training8,30 fo-
cusedonvisualsearchskillsandtheabil-
ity to identify and locate visual infor-
mation quickly in a divided-attention
format. Participants practiced increas-
ingly complex speed tasks on a com-
puter. Task difficulty was manipulated
bydecreasingthedurationofthestimuli,
adding either visual or auditory distrac-
tion, increasing the number of tasks to
be performed concurrently, or present-
ing targets over a wider spatial ex-
panse.Difficultywasincreasedeachtime
a participant achieved criterion perfor-
mance on a particular task.
Eleven months after the initial train-
ing was provided, booster training was
offered to a randomly selected 60% of
initially trained subjects in each of the
3 intervention groups. Booster train-
ing was delivered in four 75-minute ses-
sions over a 2- to 3-week period.
Measures
The ACTIVE trial had multiple out-
comes, both proximal (cognitive abili-
ties) and primary (daily function)
(TABLE 1). Composites were created to
represent each domain. Each compos-
ite was the average of 2 or 3 test scores,
equally weighted, and was designed as
a measure of ability rather than perfor-
mance on a specific test.
Proximal outcomes permitted a test
of the impact of the 3 interventions on
the appropriate cognitive abilities.
Memory assessment focused on epi-
sodic verbal memory tasks. Reasoning
assessment focused on tasks requiring
identification of patterns in letter or
word series problems. Speed-of-
processing assessment focused on iden-
tifying the minimum stimulus dura-
tion at which participants could identify
and localize information, with 75% ac-
curacy, under varying levels of cogni-
tive demand.
Primary outcomes were aspects of
functional activities, both performance-
based and self-reported. Everyday prob-
lem solving represented the ability to
reason and correctly identify informa-
tion in common everyday stimuli (eg,
medication labels, charts, forms). This
was measured via paper-and-pencil test-
ing and behavioral simulations of ev-
eryday tasks. Everyday speed empha-
sized the speed with which participants
interacted with real-world stimuli. Par-
ticipants were asked to look up a spe-
cific telephone number, find food items
on a crowded shelf of groceries, find in-
gredients on food labels, count out
specified amounts of change, find speci-
fied information on medicine bottles,
and respond appropriately to different
traffic signs. Activities of daily living
(ADL) and instrumental activities of daily
living included self-ratings drawn from
the Minimum Data Set--Home Care
(MDS-HC).43 Driving habits included
self-ratings of driving difficulty and
avoidance of specific driving situa-
tions.
Tests were standardized by pooling
scores at all time points and applying
a Blom transformation,44 producing
more normally distributed scores.
Scores for tests at each time point were
standardized to the baseline mean and
SD. If 1 or more tests of a composite
were missing, the composite score was
calculated as the average of the non-
missing tests.
Analysis
To evaluate the effects of ACTIVE train-
ing over 2 years, a repeated-measures,
mixed-effects model was used.45 The de-
pendent variables were the proximal
and primary composites measured at 4
time points: baseline, immediate post-
test, first annual evaluation (A1), and
second annual evaluation (A2). At
posttest only the cognitive variables,
the Everyday Problems Test, and the
primary speed composite were mea-
sured. The independent variables
were restricted to the basic design fea-
tures: fixed effects for training group
(memory, reasoning, speed, control);
time (3 or 4 points); booster training;
field site; and replicate within site.
Three interaction terms were chosen for
their importance and interpretability:
time  training, representing the net
effect of the trial; time  booster, rep-
resenting nonspecific effects of the ad-
ditional social contact of attending
booster training, regardless of con-
tent; and time  booster  training,
representing the training-specific ef-
fects of each booster intervention. For
this analysis, the repeated-measures
model was fitted to the available data,
ignoring missing data. Then, to deter-
mine if selective attrition influenced
the trial results, missing data were
imputed using multiple imputation

procedures,46 and the analysis was
repeated.
Hypotheses were tested by compar-
ing outcome composite scores at later
times (posttest, A1, and A2) to base-
line scores and to control group scores,
yielding net differences. The net effect
of training at any time was defined as:
(trained mean-control mean at later
time)-(trained mean-control mean at
baseline).Similarly,theneteffectofeach
boostertrainingwasdefinedas:(booster
mean-unboosted mean at later time)-
(booster mean-unboosted mean at
baseline). Results are expressed as effect
sizes (ie, difference in means divided by
intrasubject SD) to allow direct com-
parison of different outcomes. In addi-
tion, covariate-adjusted training ef-
fects were examined, with covariates of
age, sex, cognitive status (MMSE score),
years of education, and visual acuity.
Given the substantial variation associ-
ated with field site and replicate, these
2 factors were also included as covari-
ates in all analyses.
Secondary analyses investigated the
percentage of participants who showed
reliable improvement in each training
group. A participant was classified as
having improved reliably on a particu-
lar measure if his or her performance
at a follow-up occasion exceeded base-
line performance on that measure by 1
SEM.47 The formula for reliable change
was computed as outlined by Dudek,47
and analyses were conducted using SAS
v8.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
P.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS
Five thousand individuals were con-
tacted for participation (FIGURE 1). A
total of 2832 persons were eligible, 905
(18.1%) were ineligible, and 1263
(25.3%) refused (either directly or
passively by not coming to any appoint-
ments) prior to randomization. Rea-
sons for ineligibility were: cognitive im-
pairment on the MMSE (270 [29.8%]),
vision impairment (192 [21.2%]), un-
availability due to schedule (202
[22.3%]), too young (85 [9.4%]), medi-
cal conditions predisposing to immi-
nent decline or short life expectancy
(79 [8.7%]), significant ADL disability
(48 [5.3%]), impaired communication
(15 [1.7%]), diagnosed Alzheimer dis-
ease (7 [0.8%]), and prior participation

Ineligible participants were compa-
rable with eligible participants in age
(mean, 77 years) and proportion of
women (77%). Ineligible participants
tended to have a higher percentage of
nonwhite persons (48%) and lower cog-
nitive function (mean MMSE score,
20.9). Potential participants who were
eligible and randomized (n=2802) were
comparable with the group that was eli-
gible and not randomized (n=1263).
Compared with the nonrandomized
group, the randomized group was
slightly younger (mean, 74 vs 75 years),
more educated (13.5 vs 12.3 years),
scored higher in cognitive function
(MMSE score, 27.3 vs 26.8), and had
fewer nonwhite participants (27% vs
40%). The baseline characteristics of the
ACTIVE cohort and its comparability
with the general population are pro-
vided in TABLE 2.
Results of the analyses are summa-
rized in TABLE 3 and TABLE 4. Eighty-
nine percent of participants com-
pleted treatment (8 training sessions),
and 80% of the sample was retained at
the 2-year follow-up, despite the ad-
vanced age of the cohort. The net effect
of ACTIVE training on the proximal
(cognitive) composites is displayed in
the top portion of Table 3. Each train-
ing program produced an immediate
effect on its corresponding cognitive
ability. It is important to note that while
these analyses were conducted on
Blom-transformed variables, a near-
identical pattern of findings was ob-
tained with the untransformed vari-
ables. Temporal trends in the mean
cognitive composite scores by inter-
vention group are shown in FIGURE 2.
The net effect of ACTIVE training on
functional outcome composites is de-
tailed in the lower section of Table 3.

These effects were generally small on
the effect-size scale--most were be-
low 0.10--and did not differ signifi-
cantly from zero at A1 or A2. It is im-
portant to note, however, that the vast
majority of this sample remained func-
tionally independent over the course of
the 24-month observation period. For
the crucial measures of ADL perfor-
mance--measures that have been
shown to predict movement into home
care and institutional programs--a rela-
tively low ADL decline rate (defined as
2 points on the summary measure)
of 6% was observed at 12 months, with
a modest increase to 8% at 24 months.
The impact of booster training at A1
and A2 is detailed in Table 4. Again, the
strongest effects were seen in cognitive

ing and speed training administered
shortly before A1 produced signifi-
cantly better performance. The impact
of reasoning and speed booster train-
ing was greater at A1 than at A2. No
effect was detected for memory booster
on the memory proximal composite.
Compared with those who did not re-
ceive booster training, participants ran-
domizedtospeedboosterperformedsig-

Similarly, compared with those who did

The results of covariate-adjusted
analyses were generally similar. While
effect sizes were universally higher af-
ter adjusting for age, sex, education, vi-
sual function, and mental status, the
overall pattern of results was the same
and is not presented here. Similarly,
analyses of imputed data sets did not
differ in outcomes, suggesting that the
trial results were not influenced by se-
lective attrition.
Consistent with results of the pri-

seven percent of speed-trained, 74% of
reasoning-trained, and 26% of memory-
trained participants demonstrated reli-

In terms of the proportion of the in-

in the trained domain, booster effects
occurred for the speed conditions
(boost, 92%; no boost, 68%; control,

(boost, 72%; no boost, 49%; control,

vention effects occurred across time,
cognitive effects were maintained from
baseline to A2, particularly for boosted
participants (79% [speed boost] vs 37%

ceptual abilities. Although studies have
successfully used laboratory-based in-
terventions to improve cognitive per-
formanceinolderadults,8,10,12,14,27,29,52 the
ACTIVE trial improved on previous
studies in that it used a multisite, ran-
domized, controlled design; included
a large, diverse sample; used common
multisite intervention protocols; and
examined primary outcomes as well as
long-term transfer effects to everyday
activities.
Overall, this large-scale study dem-
onstrated that cognitive interventions
helped normal elderly individuals to
perform better on multiple measures of
the specific cognitive ability for which
they were trained. It did not, however,
demonstrate the generalization of
such interventions to everyday perfor-
mance,atleastintheinitial2years.The
effect sizes for the cognitive abilities
at immediate posttest are for the most
part consistent with previous research.
Moreover, these effect sizes are com-
parablewithorgreaterthantheamount
of longitudinal decline that has been
reported in previous studies (TABLE 5),
suggestingthattheseinterventionshave
the potential to reverse age-related
decline.Specifically,age-relateddecline
for reasoning ability in samples of
elderly persons without dementia has
been found to be on the order of 0.22
SD over a 7-year interval (ages 67-74
years) and to increase to 0.42 SD over
a 14-year interval (ages 67-81 years).53
Thus, immediate reasoning training
effects (0.48 SD) were comparable with
theamountofdeclinereportedtooccur
in elderly persons without dementia
overa14-yearinterval.Likewise,decline
in memory ability has been reported to
be approximately 0.25 SD over a 6- or
7-year interval. Thus, memory train-
ing effects (0.25 SD) were comparable
with the expected decline over a 7-year
interval in elderly persons without
dementia.53-55 Finally, decline for speed
has been reported to be approximately
0.16 SD over 2 years.8 Immediate speed
training effects (1.46 SD) were there-
fore 9 times greater than the expected
decline over a 2-year interval in elderly
persons without dementia.
Although training impact on the
proximal composites decreased over
time, it remained statistically signifi-
cant, attesting to the durability of the
intervention training effects. This is an
important finding, since prior inter-
ventions (especially memory) have not
shown 2-year durability. Further-
more, a very high percentage of trained
participants achieved reliable improve-
ment on the cognitive abilities, and ceil-
ing effects at baseline on the cognitive
measures explain lack of reliable im-
provement for most others. Of further
note, the tests of training effects were
conservative compared with those used
in prior cognitive aging research. That
is, prior cognitive training research has
not used intention-to-treat analyses, in-
stead excluding participants who
dropped out or were noncompliant. In
addition, prior research has not used di-
verse samples in terms of education and
ethnicity. Thus, relative to prior work,
training effects on cognitive abilities in
this study are strong.
Insufficient sample size was ruled out
as an explanation for the small effect
sizes to date on the functional out-
comes. The study was sufficiently pow-
eredtodetectaneffectsizeof0.20at95%
power with a sample of 2832.56 Power
calculationswerebasedon6Bonferroni-
corrected, 2-sided comparisons with an
overall  level of .05, a correlation of 0.7
between baseline and follow-up (based
on pilot data), and an 80% completion
rate.17 Based on these same assump-
tions, there was 90% power to detect
booster training effects. Given that we
retained more than 80% of the initial
sample over the 2-year follow-up pe-
riodandfoundnodifferentiallossacross
treatment and control conditions, there
should have been sufficient power to de-
tect a significant effect of the cognitive
training on the functional outcomes.
The absence of transfer to real-
world outcomes is not particularly sur-
prising. In addition to several decades
of cognitive science research demon-
strating the difficulty of obtaining such
transfer, most of our subjects were not
yet impaired in the domains of train-
ing. Indeed, there are several other po-
tential explanations for the observed
lack of transfer to daily function: the
proportion of participants function-
ing at ceiling levels (ie, 43% had no
room for improvement, as indicated by
baseline performance within 1 SEM of
the "best" value) on the daily func-
tional composite, the evidence of strong
practice or retest effects in the control
group, and the control group's lack of
functional decline over the 2-year fol-
low-up period.

With respect to ceiling effects in ev-
eryday functional abilities, this find-
ing does not reflect poor measure-
ment choices; rather, one would expect
that most participants would show high
levels of competence on these self- and
household-care tasks if they continue
to reside independently in the commu-
nity, as was true at enrollment. Thus,
improved cognitive function could not
be expected to improve intact every-
day abilities over a 2-year period.
Consistent with prior cognitive in-
tervention research showing large re-
test or practice effects,57 the approxi-
mately 5 hours of practice on cognitive
tests at each assessment occasion re-
sulted in retest effects for the control
group. Approximately 25% of control
participants showed reliable gain on
cognitive and functional composites as
a result of practice effects, and these re-
test effects were evident across study in-
tervals. Particularly notable were prac-
tice effects on the daily function
composites. These large retest effects
contributed to ceiling-level perfor-
mance across groups that precluded
demonstration of additional gain as a
result of training.
In terms of the observed lack of func-
tional decline in the control group, it
is important to note that individuals
with extant functional or cognitive de-
cline were carefully screened out, and
the study focused instead on intact in-
dividuals whose future decline rates
were likely to mimic or be less than rates
forthegeneralelderlypopulation.Itwas
therefore unclear whether partici-
pants would show evidence of decline
similar to established population pa-
rameters over the 12- and 24-month ob-
servation periods, or whether individu-
als in the sample would be more
resilient and less subject to decline over
such a short period of time. In speci-
fying expected effect sizes for the func-
tional outcome measures, the former
position was adopted (ie, decline rates
would follow established patterns).
However, for the crucial everyday mea-
sures of IADL and ADL performance,
the observed decline rates were signifi-
cantly below established population
norms. At 12 months, only 25% of par-
ticipants experienced a 2-point or
greater drop in the 36-point IADL scale,
while by 24 months 28% had experi-
enced this small increase in depen-
dency. For the 30-point ADL perfor-
mance scale, 6% were more dependent
at 12 months and 8% at 24 months.
Prior longitudinal research on cogni-
tively demanding measures of every-
day functioning indicates that age-
related decline occurs later for these
tasks than for the more basic abilities
that were the focus of training. Reli-
able age-related decline on everyday
problem-solving tasks has been shown
not to occur until individuals are in
their mid seventies, whereas declines
on basic abilities such as reasoning
and memory typically occur in their mid
sixties.58
In summary, it is clear that proxi-
mal training effects occurred, that
they continued (albeit at lower levels)
through 24 months, and that a signifi-
cant segment of trained individuals
went forward through 2 years of life
with better cognitive skills than did
the controls. Due to lack of functional
declines thus far, it is not yet clear
whether differential functional decline
across treatment groups will be
observed in the future as this select
cohort enters more fully into an age of
functional loss.

This we know: The earth does not belong to man, man
belongs to the Earth. All things are connected like the
blood that unites us all: Man did not weave the web
of life, he is but a strand in it. Whatever he does to
the web he does to himself.
--Chief Seattle (1786?-1866)
