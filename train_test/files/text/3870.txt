Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the efficiency of ventilation using a novel chin-lift mask compared with an
oropharyngeal airway (OPA) with EC-clamp technique in obese patients.
Methods: Obese patients scheduled for cholecystectomy under general anaesthesia were divided
into two groups: the OPA group, in which a standard mask and OPA with the EC-clamp technique
were used; the CL group, in which the chin-lift mask was used. Respiratory data were compared.
Results: One hundred patients were recruited and assigned to the OPA (n ¼ 50) and CL (n ¼ 50)
groups. Compared with the OPA group, expired tidal volume, peripheral oxygen saturation (Sp
O2
),
tidal volume/peak inspiratory pressure ratio and end-tidal carbon dioxide were higher, and the
peak and mean inspiratory pressures were lower, in the CL group. In the CL group, no patient had
an Sp
O2
95% and the lowest Sp
O2
was 99%, whereas in the OPA group, 23 patients had an Sp
O2
95% and the lowest Sp
O2
was 92%. Difficult mask ventilation occurred in eight patients in the
OPA group but in none in the CL group.
Conclusion: The chin-lift mask provided a patent airway and better quality mask ventilation than
an OPA with EC-clamp technique in obese patients.

a mask is an important basic skill for
emergency physicians and anaesthetists.1
Sufficient oxygenation is required for induc-
tion; otherwise, brain damage or death can
result.2 Almost 30% of anaesthesia deaths
result from difficult airway management and
a failure of bag-valve mask ventilation.3
However, performing face-mask ventilation
is particularly challenging in obese patients.4
In the EC-clamp technique, as described
in the American Heart Association guide-
lines for emergency cardiac care,5 the thumb
and forefinger form a `C' shape over the
mask and exert downward pressure on the
mask, while the third, fourth and fifth finger
(forming an `E') are positioned along the jaw
to maintain the jaw thrust. In practice, the
jaw is not only pulled forward by the fifth
finger but is also held in position by a
backward pull towards the upper jaw,
which requires the operator's fingers to
have enough strength to maintain the
airway. If the operator's hand becomes
fatigued, which may particularly occur
when the position is held for a long period
of time or in obese patients, the airway may
become partly obstructed, reducing the effi-
ciency of the ventilation. The main difficulty
in keeping the airway unblocked in obese
patients (or in difficult mask ventilation
situations) is maintaining the advancement
of the mandible. To solve this problem, a
chin-lift mask was devised; this customized,
manually adjustable intraoral appliance lifts
the tip of the jaw effectively and consistently.
The present study evaluated respiratory data
obtained during anaesthesia induction using
the novel chin-lift mask, compared with an
oropharyngeal airway (OPA) with the EC-
clamp technique.
Patients and methods
People with American Society of
Anesthesiologists physical status I­II and a
body mass index >30 who had cholecystitis
and were scheduled for cholecystectomy
under general anaesthesia at the Tianjin
Union Medicine Centre, Tianjin, China,
between March 2012 and October 2012
were recruited sequentially to the study.
Patients underwent physical assessments
including history of snoring or sleep
apnoea, and other assessments to predict
ease of intubation. Patients with upper-
airway abnormalities, facial hair, facial ana-
tomical abnormalities, hiatus hernia, gastro-
oesophageal reflux, ischaemic or congenital
heart disease, or severe acute or chronic lung
disease were excluded. After enrolment,
patients were randomly assigned using a
computerized random-number generator list
to two groups: the OPA group, in which a
standard mask and OPA with the EC-clamp
technique were used, and the CL group, in
which the chin-lift mask was used.
Written informed consent was obtained
from all study participants. The study proto-
col was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of Tianjin Union Medicine
Centre, Tianjin, China.
Anaesthesia
Patients fasted from midnight before the
operation; no premedication was adminis-
tered. After placement of routine monitor-
ing devices and capnography monitors, and
preoxygenation with 100% oxygen for 3 min
administered via a standard mask in the
OPA group and via the chin-lift mask in the
CL group, anaesthesia was induced with
intravenous 0.05 mg/kg midazolam, 2.0 mg/
kg fentanyl, 2 mg/kg propofol and 0.5 mg/kg
atracurium. A total fresh gas flow of 3 l/min
oxygen was delivered via the standard mask
or the chin-lift mask. The ventilation par-
ameters were initially set at a tidal volume of
10 ml/kg at a rate of 12 breaths/min. The
adjustable pressure limiting valve was set at
30 cmH2
O. A standard circle circuit and 2-l
bags were used.
The patient's position for induction
was supine, with the extremities resting
694 Journal of International Medical Research 42(3)
comfortably on padded surfaces in a neutral
anatomical position. The head was rested
comfortably on a standard pillow that was
raised in a `sniff' position. When the train-
of-four count fell to <2, either an OPA and
standard mask was held in place using the
EC-clamp technique or the chin-lift mask
was put in position. The latex-free chin-lift
mask was designed for single use in adults,
and is based on the standard mask. The
chin-lift mask is constructed from polyvi-
nylchloride approved by the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO
10993), which is nontoxic, hypoallergenic,
noncarcinogenic and generally well toler-
ated. At the bottom of the mask, there is a
matrix column with a J-shaped slide that
holds a moveable insert (Figure 1A and 1B).
The straight section is 12.5 cm long and the
curved section is 5 cm long. The thickness of
the J-shaped slide is 2 mm. The radius of the
curved section is similar to that of a laryn-
goscope blade. The proximal end of the slide
contains 15 holes. When the slide is adjusted
maximally upwards, the tip of the slide
returns to the inside of the air cushion, so
the device can be used for both preoxygena-
tion and provision of oxygen (Figure 1C).
The button at the front of the cylindrical
matrix column is pressed to adjust the length
of the J-shaped slide until the tip of the slide
maximally lifts the jaw. The adjustable
vertical range is 4 cm (Figure 1D). As soon
as the operator releases the button, the
interior card slot in the matrix column is
locked into one of the slide holes and the tip
of the J-shaped slide fits on the surface of the
oral mucosa of the lower jaw, so the chin is
held in a forward position relative to the
stationary maxilla. This procedure takes

adjusted minimally upwards.

5­10 s. With the tip of the slide acting as a
fulcrum, the operator places a thumb on the
top portion of the mask and the fingers on
the matrix column. The chin-lift mask
allows the operator to lift the jaw upwards
and simultaneously to extend the atlanto-
occipital joint while applying enough down-
ward pressure to create an airtight seal
(Figures 2 and 3). The dominant hand can
then ventilate the patient using a bag-valve
device.
The same anaesthetist performed all the
induction procedures. He had been trained
to use the chin-lift mask using mannequins
prior to the study and had >10 years'
clinical experience.
After induction using the two types of
mask, an endotracheal tube was inserted by
an experienced anaesthesiologist.
Patient assessment
Mean expired tidal volume (Vt), peak
inspiratory pressure (PIP), mean inspiratory
pressure (MIP), tidal volume/peak inspira-
tory pressure ratio (Vt/PIP), end-tidal
carbon dioxide (EtCO2
) level and peripheral
oxygen saturation (Sp
O2
) were recorded
during anaesthesia induction. All data were
collected by a single observer,positioned in a
manner that was blinded to the type of mask
being used.
Patients with more than one of the
following criteria were defined as experien-
cing difficult mask ventilation: (1) inability
to maintain an Sp
O2
>92%; (2) `significant'
gas leakage beneath the face mask; (3) need
to increase the gas flow to >6 l/min; (4) no
perceptible chest movement; (5) two-handed
mask ventilation requiring assistance by an
anaesthesiologist; (6) more than two oxygen
flushes needed.6 A reduction in Sp
O2
to
<95% was considered to be a failure of
ventilation; in these circumstances, the study
could be terminated, a potential effective
alternative to the `four hand/two person
skill' was provided or immediate tracheal
intubation was performed. This Sp
O2
threshold was chosen because the more
usual threshold of 90% might have posed
an unacceptable risk in obese patients.

A P-value <0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant. Assuming a 100 ml
Vt difference between the groups and a
standard deviation of 100 ml, a study
group size of 50 individuals was calculated
to be necessary to achieve a significant
difference between the groups with a power
of 0.9.7 All statistical analyses were per-
formed using SPSSÕ software, version 15.0

Results
A total of 100 patients aged 22­64 years
(14 female; 86 male) were included in this
study, of whom 50 were assigned to the OPA
group and 50 to the CL group. Patient
demographic and clinical characteristics are
shown in Table 1.
Ventilation indices in the two groups are
shown in Table 2. The chin-lift mask
provided more effective ventilation than an
OPA plus EC-clamp technique. The Vt, Vt/
PIP ratio and EtCO2
were significantly
higher and the PIP and MIP significantly
lower in the CL group than in the OPA
group (P < 0.001). In addition, in the CL
group, no patient had an Sp
O2
95% and
the lowest Sp
O2
was 99%, whereas in the
OPA group, 23 patients had an Sp

nique by a second anaesthesiologist. In
contrast, no cases of difficult mask ventila-
tion occurred in the CL group. No airway
injuries (such as lip laceration or haema-
toma, dental injury, tongue laceration, pha-
ryngeal laceration or laryngeal laceration)
were observed in either group. No patients
experienced vomiting or aspiration.
Discussion
In the present study, the chin-lift mask
offered advantages in most technical aspects
of airway management in obese patients.
The chin-lift mask effectively lifted the jaw,
produced a patent airway and helped the
operator successfully perform one-handed
bag mask ventilation during the induction of
anaesthesia.
Adequate mask ventilation is an import-
ant component of patient safety dur-
ing induction of general anaesthesia.
Anaesthesia reduces airway muscle tone
and increases the collapsibility of the pha-
ryngeal structures, thereby causing airway
obstruction.8 Obese patients may present
with difficult airways, and are more likely to
desaturate than lean people.9,10 Retraction
of the mandible may contribute to the
reduced airway size seen during anaesthe-
sia.11 Studies have demonstrated that
manual anterior displacement of the man-
dible (using techniques such as the chin-lift
manoeuvre) can dilate and stiffen the pha-
ryngeal airway.12,13 The chin-lift manoeuvre
is a complex technique that requires consid-
erable skill: the left hand lifts the chin and
maintains head extension while generating
the mask seal.14,15 This technique can be
effective in elevating the hyoid and epiglot-
tis, thereby increasing the exposure of the
laryngeal aperture and to some extent
increasing its size, especially in the absence
of tone in the geniohyoid and genioglossus
muscles when a neuromuscular blocking
drug has been administered.16 The man-
oeuvre enlarges both the laryngeal inlet and
the pharynx. The chin-lift mask investigated
in the present study was designed to emulate
the chin-lift manoeuvre. This novel method
was associated with a lower PIP, a higher Vt
and Sp
O2
and less frequent difficult mask
ventilation compared with an OPA with the
EC-clamp technique. This suggests that
lifting the jaw upward enabled fresh gas to
be delivered with less upper airway obstruc-
tion. Because of its simplicity of use and
efficiency, the chin-lift face mask may help
to prevent poor oxygenation and to

maintain pharyngeal patency in obese
patients during anaesthesia induction.
Physicians and anaesthetists must be
trained to use the EC-clamp technique.
However, if the operator's hand is small
and the patient's face is relatively large,
uneven and inadequate downward pressure
on the mask often leads to air leakage that
may put the patient in danger. The EC-
clamp technique requires that the operator's
fingers are strong enough to maintain man-
dible advancement, which can easily lead to
hand fatigue, especially in obese patients. In
addition, this manoeuvre requires forceful
pressure on the patient's face with the tips of
the third, fourth and fifth fingers, which
often causes redness and painful pressure
points. One advantage of the chin-lift mask
is that it allows the anaesthetist to achieve an
effective seal and easy ventilation for a range
of patient facial types. The tip of the
J-shaped slide lifts the tip of the jaw, whereas
the thumb controls the posterior part of the
mask so that the air cushion closely fits the
patient's face to prevent leakage. Head
extension is maintained by the torque
between the tip of the slide and the pressure
on the posterior part of the mask. Mouth
opening, which is a component of the airway
manoeuvres required for the improvement
of upper airway patency, is automatically
achieved by the intraoral slide of the chin-lift
mask. Furthermore, by elevating the tip of
the jaw as in the single-hand chin-lift man-
oeuvre, the chin-lift mask helps to manage
an unprotected airway by `giving an add-
itional hand'. An OPA elevates the hyoid or
epiglottis and displaces the tongue, thereby
producing a fixed-calibre channel in the
retroglossal and supraglossal portions of
the airway. However, insertion of an OPA
is not a benign procedure. The airway can
push the tongue posterior and further
obstruct the oropharynx if not inserted
correctly. Substantial lacerations can occur
if the lips or tongue are caught between the
teeth and the oral airway. The airway can
force the epiglottis closed against the vocal
cords if it is too long, resulting in com-
plete airway obstruction.17 Too small an
airway will force the tongue against the
pharynx, also producing an obstruction.18
The J-shaped slide of the chin-lift mask has
an adjustable vertical range of 4 cm and
therefore does not invade the laryngeal
cavity. In the present study, improved ven-
tilation resulting in higher Vt, lower PIP and
MIP and higher Sp
O2
values was observed in
the CL group compared with the OPA
group.
The limitations of the present study
should be considered when interpreting the
results. First, the study could not be per-
formed with the anaesthetist blinded to the
mask used because of the obvious appear-
ance of the chin-lift mask; hence a bias could
not be excluded. Bias was minimized by the
use of a blinded observer to collect the data.
Secondly, the mask was not evaluated in
conscious patients. In the present study,
patients were ventilated under controlled
conditions in the operating room, which
offered ideal conditions for airway manage-
ment. However, patients who require emer-
gency airway control often have intact
reflexes, so the results cannot be extrapo-
lated to emergency settings. Thirdly, to
minimize operator bias, the same male
anaesthetist performed all the procedures.
It has been reported that sex is an independ-
ent risk factor for difficult mask ventila-
tion.19 Hand size may confound the ability
of operators to generate and maintain a
mask seal using type of mask. Koga and
Kawamoto19 reported that men had a larger
hand size and were able to provide higher
tidal volumes than women using both of the
methods tested. Fourthly, although we did
not observe any adverse effects associated
with use of the chin-lift mask in this small
cohort of patients, it is possible that prob-
lems may arise in a wider population or if
the novel method was used for a prolonged
period.
Li et al. 699
In summary, the present study demon-
strated that mask ventilation performed in
anaesthetized and paralysed obese patients
was of better quality with the novel chin-lift
mask than with an OPA using the EC-clamp
technique. These results suggest that the
chin-lift mask could be considered as an
alternative to a standard mask plus OPA
with EC-clamp technique to maintain
airway patency in obese patients. The role
of this intraoral mask for upper airway
management during deep sedation, posta-
naesthesia care and general anaesthetic
induction requires further evaluation.
