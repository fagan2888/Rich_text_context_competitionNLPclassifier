Objectives. This study assesses implications of changes in coresidence with adult children for parents' marital relations,
hypothesizing that transitions into coresidence lower marital quality and transitions out of coresidence increase marital
quality.
Methods. Panel data from Waves 1 and 2 of the National Survey of Families and Households are used to analyze
whether change in three measures of marital quality--time together, happiness, and disagreements--is related to adult
child coresidence.
Results. When adult children move out, parent couples increase their time together; there is a tendency for reduced
time together when the nest ``refills.'' However, there are no effects of moves in or out on the marital happiness of parents
or the number of marital disagreements they have. There is also no effect on time together or on marital quality when one
adult child moves out but another moves in during the same period. The presence of younger children has more consistent
associations with marital quality.
Discussion. Coresidence with adult children does not appear to be an experience that disrupts the quality of marital
relations. It may be that qualitative dimensions of coresidence experiences with adult children matter more than
coresidence per se.
PARENTHOOD is stressful, particularly when children are
young, and particularly for women. Research has shown
that the transition to parenthood leads to lower psychological
well-being and marital quality (Belsky & Kelly, 1994;
McLanahan & Adams, 1987), with a rise in marital happiness
after the nest empties (Van Laningham, Johnson, & Amato,
2001; White & Edwards, 1990). To what extent, and under
what circumstances, do the effects of parenthood continue when
children move into adulthood?
Relations with adult children later in life have inconsistent
effects on well-being (Ward & Spitze, 1998), reflecting a mix of
positive and negative dimensions of such ties (Luescher &
Pillemer, 1998). Children's problems, however, can be a source
of distress for parents (Pillemer & Suitor, 1991), as are the
common disagreements and conflicts in parent­adult child rela-
tions (Clark, Preston, Raskin, & Bengtson, 1999; Umberson,
1992). Thus, adult children continue to affect parents, but those
effects appear to be weaker than those for young children.
What about circumstances in which adult children live
(coreside) with parents? One would expect differences between
having young children at home and having coresident adult
children. The latter, although still receiving some assistance
from parents (Spitze & Ward, 1995; Ward, Logan, & Spitze,
1992), require much less care and attention than young chil-
dren. They may also be positively selected, as those who stay
or return to the nest may get along well with parents and help
out more (Aquilino, 1991; Aquilino & Supple, 1991; Ward &
Spitze, 1992). However, coresidence with parents in adult-
hood may imply failure to attain adult status or a crisis such as
unemployment, and thus it may create parental stress. Further,
coresidence intensifies the nature and effects of parent­child
relations, as interaction and exchange are heightened (Rossi &
Rossi, 1990; Ward et al., 1992; Ward & Spitze, 1992; White,
1994; White & Rogers, 1997).
Our research focuses on the implications of adult child co-
residence for parents' marital relations in midlife. Longitudinal
data allow us to assess change in parents' time together and
marital quality in response to moves into and out of the nest by
adult children. Prior research has addressed needs and circum-
stances that lead to adult child coresidence and the nature of
parent­child relations in such households. We begin with an
overview of those patterns and then discuss how adult child co-
residence may affect parents' marital quality.
Patterns and Consequences of Coresidence
Coresidence by adult children and parents is not uncommon.
Approximately 30% of parents from their 40s to their 60s co-
reside with an adult child, and approximately 15% of parents
aged 70 or older do so (Aquilino, 1990; Ward et al., 1992);
approximately 25% of children aged 22­25 coreside with
a parent (Ward et al., 1992). Indeed, adult child coresidence
has increased recently, as children are leaving later and are
more likely to return to the nest (Goldscheider, Goldscheider,
St. Clair, & Hodges, 1999; White, 1994). Coresidence situations
primarily tend to reflect children's needs and circumstances,
with adult children using the parental nest as a safety net or home
base (DaVanzo & Goldscheider, 1990; Ward et al., 1992). The
alternative scenario of coresidence by frail elderly parents and
caregivingchildrenrepresentsasmallproportion,evenofcoresid-
ing older parents and adult children (Aquilino, 1990; Ward et al.,
1992).
Research on the quality of relations between parents and
coresident adult children and the effects of coresidence on
well-being has relied mostly on cross-sectional data, yielding

a positive but incomplete picture. Coresident parents and
adult children generally report satisfaction with coresidence
and positive relations (Suitor & Pillemer, 1988; Ward & Spitze,
1996b; White & Rogers, 1997). Research on consequences for
parental well-being is more mixed. Umberson and Gove (1989)
reported that both mothers and fathers with coresident children
(of any age) have lower well-being, but Menaghan (1983)
found no significant effect of the presence of coresident
children over the age of 22 on parents' well-being. Using panel
data, White and Edwards (1990) found that nestleaving in-
creases parental life satisfaction if there is continued contact
with the child. More generally, parents' distress has been found
to be increased by adult children's problems, with no significant
difference by whether the child coresides or not (Pillemer &
Suitor, 1991).
Effects of Children on Parents' Marriages
Although much is known about how children influence their
parents' well-being, less research has focused on parents'
marriages. Further, that research has tended to focus on minor
rather than adult children. It has been grounded mainly in two
theoretical traditions. First, on the basis of exchange theory
and the derived assumption that spouses receive benefits and
experience costs of marital relations (Suitor & Pillemer, 1987),
it has been suggested that the presence of children modifies
the balance between costs and benefits, at least temporarily
(Bradbury, Fincham, & Bench, 2000). Parents experience
greater financial stress (White, Booth, & Edwards, 1986), have
less time alone together, and tend toward more gender-
stereotyped roles (Walzer, 1998). The latter is seen as pushing
women into more household services and men into greater
breadwinning responsibility than they might prefer (Umberson
& Gove, 1989).
Second, researchers have discussed the impact of children
on parents' well-being and marital quality from a role theory
perspective (Menaghan, 1983; Suitor & Pillemer, 1987; White
& Edwards, 1990). Children potentially increase role strain or
role overload because the heavy demands of caring for them are
likely to conflict with other roles or create an overwhelming
total burden. This is likely to be true more for mothers, who
tend to bear more of the child-care burden. The empty nest can
also be viewed in terms of role change or loss.
The presence of adult children may have some of the con-
sequences suggested by these theoretical perspectives, but to a
lesser degree. Adult children may contribute to family finances
or at least support their own living expenses. They may con-
tribute to household labor, although perhaps also adding to the
total workload, particularly to the mother's share (South &
Spitze, 1994; Spitze & Ward, 1995). They also may limit parents'
time alone but, again, not to the extent that a younger child
would (Suitor & Pillemer, 1987; Ward & Spitze, 1992).
Adult children's presence, and particularly their return, may
also have particular consequences that are distinctive from
those of younger children. Adult child coresidence may disrupt
the normative empty nest of midlife marriages. Continuing
coresidence by older children may violate parental expectations
and generate conflict. Umberson and Gove (1989) suggested
that ``the benefits of parenting later in the life course partly
depend on one's children achieving and maintaining indepen-
dence from parents'' (p. 455). Concerns about children's
success may influence the perceived success of the marriage
and benefits derived from it. Transitions, as when children
return to the nest, can also disrupt routines and relationships.
Role theory suggests that any role change, including role loss,
can have negative consequences (White & Edwards, 1990), and
the empty nest is a vulnerable time in marriages (Heidemann,
Suhomlinova, & O'Rand, 1998).
There is limited but mixed evidence on how parents' marital
quality relates to adult child coresidence. Some findings are
based on cross-sectional data. For example, Suitor and Pillemer
(1987) reported no effect of adult child coresidence on marital
quality for parents over the age of 65, suggesting that any ef-
fects may apply more to coresidence with young adult chil-
dren. However, they do find an association between the quality
of the parent­child relations with coresident adult children
and parents' marital conflict. Ward and Spitze (1998) found that
intergenerational exchanges between ``sandwiched'' parents in
midlife and their adult children had little association with
parents' marital quality, as generally high satisfaction in midlife
marriages was sustained despite occasional intergenerational
burdens.
Some studies have used longitudinal data to examine
changes in marital quality with the transition to an empty nest.
White and Edwards (1990) found that marital happiness in-
creased after the nest emptied, particularly when the last child
to leave was younger (indicating recency of launch and perhaps
the relief from the launch of a teenager rather than an older
child). Menaghan (1983) found increased feelings of marital
equity, though there was no parallel effect on affection or ful-
fillment. Van Laningham and colleagues (2001) indicated that
emptying the nest slows down an otherwise steeper decline in
marital happiness over time.
Thus, research on changes in coresidence has produced
mixed results on the effects of coresident adult children on
parents' marriages. These studies have tended to focus on the
initial period of nestleaving by very young adults, with less
attention to transitions by older adult children; no study has
explicitly examined the effect of a return to coresidence on
parents' marital happiness. Research has also focused on sub-
jective dimensions of marital quality, with no attention to more
objective and behavioral indicators, such as time together.
Aims and Hypotheses
Our research investigates the effects of transitions in and out
of adult child coresidence on parents' time together and two
dimensions of their marital quality. Possible selectivity in the
characteristics of parents and children who coreside compli-
cates efforts to assess the effects of coresidence (Aquilino,
1991; Ward & Spitze, 1992). Propensity to coreside may be
related to family structure, history, and, in particular, factors
associated with the quality of parent­child relations that may
partly account for the apparent outcomes of coresidence.
In their analysis of panel data, however, White and Rogers
(1997) concluded that there is no evidence of selection into
coresidence of parents and adult children with particularly
harmonious relations.
The theoretical perspectives we reviewed imply negative
consequences of adult child coresidence for parents' marriages.
Exchanges are likely on balance to favor the adult child rather
than the parent, and the resulting imbalance could affect marital

quality. Similarly, although the ``role loss'' implied by an
emptied nest may be stressful for parents and their marriage, the
role perspective also predicts negative consequences from role
strain or overload that may result from adult child coresidence.
Thus, although we do not view our analysis as explicitly test-
ing the applicability of either theory, we hypothesize positive
consequences of transitions out of coresidence and negative
consequences of transitions back into living with adult children;
the implications of stable coresidence over time are less clear.
First, we hypothesize that transitions out of coresidence with
an adult child will increase parents' time together, whereas
having an adult child move back into an emptied nest will have
the opposite effect. As indicated earlier, the presence of young
children in a household is likely to mean that parents have less
time for each other, as well as increasingly differentiated roles
(Walzer, 1998). Although coresidence with an adult child may
have different and smaller effects, it is nonetheless likely to
reduce parents' time alone with each other (Heidemann et al.,
1998; South & Spitze, 1994; Spitze & Ward, 1995; Suitor &
Pillemer, 1987).
Second, we hypothesize that transitions out of coresidence
with an adult child will increase parents' marital happiness and
reduce disagreements, whereas a refilled nest will have opposite
consequences. Although problems that may lead to a particular
child's coresidence are likely to influence parents' well-being
(Pillemer & Suitor, 1991), the processes we are focusing on
in this article relate more generally to the presence of any
adult child. However, we also compare the consequences of
continued coresidence with the same adult child with those
of living at a later point with a different adult child. We also
examine the effects of continued coresidence with the same or
different adult child, in comparison with those of emptying or
refilling the nest.
Third, although there is only weak evidence of gender dif-
ferences in coresidence experiences, it can be hypothesized that
effects of coresidence may be greater for women because of
gender-based differences in the nature and impact of family
roles and relations. Mothers are likely to be providing more
household services to children, and, although these may de-
crease with the child's age, a gap between mothers and fathers
is likely to remain (Spitze & Ward, 1995; Ward et al., 1992).
Menaghan (1983) found effects of the empty nest on feelings
of marital equity, and, although she did not report gender dif-
ferences, it seems likely that such concerns would be more
salient for wives, given related past research (e.g., Robinson &
Spitze, 1992).
METHODS
Sample
Data are from the first and second waves of the National Sur-
vey of Families and Households, collected in 1987­1988 and
1992­1993 (Sweet & Bumpass, 1996). The first wave was a
national probability sample of 13,017 persons aged 19 and older
representing the noninstitutionalized U.S. population, with over-
sampling of several demographic groups (including Blacks and
Hispanics) and household types; 77% of primary respondents
were resurveyed (personal interviews and self-administered
questionnaires) at Wave 2.
Our analyses use a subsample at Wave 2 who had an adult
child (aged 19þ) at Wave 1, were married to the same person at
both waves, were householders (the owner or renter, to focus on
the typical form of coresidence in which adult children live in
their parents' household), and had data for all variables used
in the analyses (as described in the paragraphs that follow).
This yielded a sample of 1,365 persons, with the following
characteristics: 43% men, 85% non-Hispanic White, and mean
age at Wave 2 of 60.3 years (16% younger than 50, 31% in
their 50s, 30% in their 60s, and 23% aged 70þ).
Regarding coresidence with adult children, 28% of respond-
ents (n ¼ 384) coresided with an adult child at Wave 1; this
number declined to 18% at Wave 2. Put in other terms, 141
(10%) coresided at both waves, 243 (18%) coresided at Wave 1
but not at Wave 2, 109 (8%) did not coreside at Wave 1 but did
at Wave 2, and 872 (64%) did not coreside with an adult child
at either wave. A substantial majority of coresident households
(76­80%) had only one coresident adult child. In addition, 12%
of respondents had a child younger than 19 in the household,
another 6% had a grandchild in the household, and 92% had an
adult child living outside of the household.
Variables
Marital quality. --The dependent variables reflect three
aspects of marital quality measured at both waves: time spent
with each other, marital happiness, and marital disagreements.
Time together is self-reported and therefore has subjective
elements, but it refers to a more objective aspect of the rela-
tionship; we view happiness and disagreements as more sub-
jective indicators of marital quality. To assess time together,
respondents were asked, ``During the past month, about how
often did you and your husband or wife spend time alone with
each other, talking, or sharing an activity?'' (from 1 ¼ never to
6 ¼ almost every day). Respondents assessed overall marital
happiness with a standard item: ``Taking all things together,
how would you describe your marriage (T1)/relationship
(T2)?'' (from 1 ¼ very unhappy to 7 ¼ very happy). Frequency
of disagreements (from 1¼never to 6¼almost every day) were
reported in six areas--household tasks, money, time spent
together, sex, in-laws, and children--combined into a scale
(range ¼ 6­36, alpha ¼ .76). For missing cases to be reduced,
missing items for the scale were recoded to the item mean for
respondents with missing data for only one or two of the six
items. Because of skewness in distributions of the measures of
marital quality, extreme scores were recoded to truncate the
tails; comparisons with analyses using the original coding and
with analyses using log transformations indicated that empirical
patterns are similar across these options. We use the three
measures to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the
quality of marital relations that reflects both positive and nega-
tive dimensions of marital relations, as well as both objective
and subjective elements (Johnson, White, Edwards, & Booth,
1986). The quality of these midlife marriages was generally
quite positive (see Table 1).
Coresidence. --We focus on patterns of stability or change in
coresidence between parents and adult children. Coresidence
status entails four possibilities: coresidence at both waves (with
the same or different children), coresidence at Wave 1 but not at
WARD AND SPITZE
S4
Wave 2, coresidence at Wave 2 but not at Wave 1, and not
coresiding at either wave. To more clearly assess patterns of
change in coresident situations, our analysis divides the sample
into two subgroups: first, parents coresiding with an adult child
at Wave 1, to compare those who coreside with the same adult
child at Wave 2 (n ¼ 91), coreside with a different adult child at
Wave 2 (50), and do not coreside with any adult child at Wave
2 (243); and second, parents not coresiding with an adult child
at Wave 1, to compare those who still do not coreside (872)
with those who do coreside at Wave 2 (109). In combination,
these comparisons capture the diverse patterns of stability and
transitions in or out of coresidence with an adult child between
the two waves.
For the most part, these situations extend past the traditional
nestleaving by very young adult children, but they also reflect
a variety of ages. Coresident adult children at Wave 1 had
a mean age of 23.6, increasing to 26.3 at Wave 2. The mean age
was 28.9 if the same adult child coresided at both waves, but it
was only 22.8 if a different adult child was coresident at Wave
2. The latter appear to be primarily younger children replacing
or remaining as their older siblings leave. Among parents
whose households refilled (i.e., who did not coreside with an
adult child at Wave 1 but did at Wave 2), the mean age of the
coresident adult child at Wave 2 was 25.8, reflecting a mix of
younger children aging into adulthood (40% of these coresident
adult children had been adolescents living with their parents
at Wave 1) and older adult children returning to the nest. In
combination, these patterns allow us to look at a more diverse
set of coresident households than in previous research: different
transitions in and out, as well as stable coresidence by an adult
child over approximately 5 years.
Control variables. --Analyses included control variables
likely to be related to marital quality: age, gender, and race
or ethnicity (dummy variables for Blacks and for Hispanics);
education (as an indicator of socioeconomic status); and self-
rated health (from 1 ¼ very poor to 5 ¼ excellent). Missing data
for health were recoded to the mean to conserve sample size.
We also included characteristics of coresident children: age,
gender (presence of a son), and family status (whether the
household included a child or partner of the coresident adult
child; of the 250 households with a coresident child, only 10
included that child's partner and only 35 included a child).
Presence in the household of a young child (younger than 19)
of the respondent (parent) was also included.
Analytic Strategy
We hypothesized that coresidence with an adult child would
negatively affect the quality of parents' marital relations, both
in terms of time together and marital happiness and disagree-
ments. More specifically, transitions into coresidence would be
related to lower marital quality, whereas transitions out would
have opposite associations. It is less clear whether continuing
coresidence, or a distinction between same versus different
coresident adult child, would be related to change in marital
patterns.
To address these issues, we focus on change in two respects.
First, measures of the dependent variables at Wave 1 are
controlled in regression analyses to focus on change in marital
quality between Waves 1 and 2. Analyses using change scores
for the dependent variables yielded equivalent results for the
coresidence variables. Second, we divide the sample according
to coresidence or noncoresidence with an adult child at Wave 1,
using dummy variables to reflect stability or change in co-
residence arrangements at Wave 2. For those coresiding with
an adult child at Wave 1, coresidence with the same child at
Wave 2 is the omitted category for comparison with coresi-
dence with a different adult child and coresidence with no adult
child. For those not coresiding with an adult child at Wave 1,
not coresiding at Wave 2 is the omitted category for comparison
with having an adult child move into coresidence at Wave 2.
We also hypothesized that coresidence with an adult child
would be more strongly related to marital quality for women
than men. Following the guidelines of Jaccard, Turrisi, and
Wan (1990), we assessed this by testing the statistical
significance of change in R2 when multiplicative interaction
terms for gender with coresidence status were added to the
regression analyses.
Table 1 summarizes descriptive data for variables for the
total sample and by gender. Patterns of adult child coresidence
and characteristics of coresident children do not differ for men
and women. Women report slightly lower marital happiness,

RESULTS
Table 2 summarizes results of regression analyses of time
together as a couple, marital happiness, and marital disagree-
ments. Looking first at patterns of coresidence with adult
children, we find that increased time together as a couple is
associated with having a coresident adult child leave (and there
is no statistically significant difference between continuing
coresidence with same vs. different adult child). In addition,
decreased time together is related to having an adult child move
into the household, though this association is marginal ( p ,
.10). These patterns support our first hypothesis. However, co-
residence status is not related to changes in either marital happi-
ness or disagreements. In particular, neither a transition out of
coresidence with an adult child nor a transition into coresidence
is related to these indicators of marital quality. There is also
no difference between coresiding with the same adult child
or a different adult child. Thus, our second hypothesis is not
supported.
Gender exhibits little association with the measures of mari-
tal quality. In particular, none of the gender interaction terms
add significantly to the variance explained, indicating that,
contrary to our third hypothesis, implications of coresidence
with adult children do not differ for men and women. How-
ever, among parents coresiding with an adult child at Wave 1,
women compared with men exhibit a decrease in marital happi-
ness and an increase in marital disagreements (though the latter
is marginal, p , .10); in contrast, women compared with men
exhibit decreased marital disagreements among parents who
did not coreside with an adult child at Wave 1. These patterns
suggest that coresidence may be more problematic for women,
but the associations are relatively weak and, as we noted,
there are no significant gender interactions in the associations
between marital quality and coresidence transitions.
Although the control variables are not the focus here, we
can note some variations related to age, race or ethnicity,
and health. Older respondent age tends to be associated with
increases in time together and marital happiness, and with
decreased marital disagreements. Better health also tends to be
associated with increases in reported marital quality. Black
respondents exhibit decreased time together and increased
disagreements. The presence of a young child (younger than
19) in the household tends to be associated with reduced time
together, lower marital happiness, and more frequent marital
disagreements. However, the association between presence of
a young child and marital happiness and disagreements is
significant only for those without a coresident adult child at
Wave 1. This suggests that the presence of an adult child may
reduce the effects of a young child. The characteristics of
coresident adult children are generally unrelated to marital
quality, except that increased time together is associated with
older child age (if coresident at Wave 1) and presence of a child
or partner.
DISCUSSION
We began this article by noting that the burdens of parent-
hood have received particular attention for parents of young
children; we asked whether those burdens continue to be evident
after children move into adulthood. Coresidence by parents
and adult children offers an opportunity to look at this question;
if there are effects, they might be expected to be particularly
evident in such circumstances, paralleling the usual situation
for parents of younger children.
Panel data were used to assess the implications of co-
residence with adult children, in particular transitions into and
out of coresidence, for changes in marital quality. We were able
to assess diverse circumstances of coresidence with adult
children, moving beyond nestleaving by very young adult
children to include coresidence stability and transitions by older
adult children. On the basis of arguments derived from ex-
change theory and role theory, we hypothesized that coresi-
dence with adult children would negatively affect both more
objective and more subjective dimensions of marital quality,
reducing parents' time together and leading to lower marital
happiness and more frequent disagreements. We also expected
stronger effects for mothers than fathers, on the basis of earlier
literature that found such gender differences for younger chil-
dren and because we expected mothers to provide more house-
hold services to coresident children than do fathers.
We find evidence in favor of only our first hypothesis.
Changes in adult child coresidence do appear to affect parents'

time together as a couple. Transitions out of coresidence are
related to increased time together, though transitions into co-
residence are only marginally related to less time. Thus, this
important aspect of marital interaction appears to be elastic with
respect to the presence of coresident adult children, as could
be expected when there is another member of the household.
But what does this mean about the reported quality of those
marriages?
In contrast to these effects on time together, we find that
coresidence transitions are unrelated to marital happiness and
disagreements. Thus, although these middle-aged and older
parents' marriages are affected in the more objective sense of
time together, the more subjective assessments of their mar-
riages do not change. It would appear, thus, that any effects
on these parents' psychological well-being that can be traced
to emptying or refilling the nest do not extend to the quality
of the marriage itself. This may be due to the long durations
of most of the marriages represented here; perhaps they are
less vulnerable than the shorter term marriages that are generally
found to be affected by the addition or presence of young
children. It may mean that any effects of coresidence attribut-
able to changed exchange relations or modifications in the mix
of roles are modest enough not to extend to marital quality.
More specifically, it appears that the implications of an adult
child in the household are less pronounced than those of a
younger child. There is little evidence here or in other research
that parental and spousal roles affect each other through
role conflict or strain after children have reached adulthood.
Parenting a young child is a more encompassing role, whereas
the parental role has less depth or breadth with adult children.
We also expected that wives or mothers would be affected
more than fathers by coresidence with an adult child, but this
hypothesis is not supported by our analyses. We did find some
main effects of gender, but these differences were small, and
the overall patterns for men and women are very similar. It is
important that there are no interactions between gender and
changes in coresidence status in our equations for marital
quality. Gender differences in parent­adult child relations have
been assumed to be significant, with a special focus on the
mother­daughter relation (e.g., Rossi & Rossi, 1990), but other
recent analyses have found fewer differences than expected (e.g.,
Logan & Spitze, 1996; Umberson, Chen, House, Hopkins,
& Slaten, 1996). The similarity in adult child coresidence
experiences for men and women may reflect similar family
circumstances for middle-aged mothers or fathers and young
adult daughters or sons who are in coresident households
(Logan & Spitze, 1996; Ward & Spitze, 1996a). Furthermore,
even if there are some differences in parent­child relations in
coresident households, they do not appear to extend to the ex-
perience of marital relations for either women or men.
As a unique addition to earlier literature on marital quality,
we examined not only potential changes leading to an empty
nest but also the effects of a return to the nest by adult children.
However, despite our expectation that returns to the nest might
signal adult children's problems that would affect parents'
evaluation of the success of their marriage, as well as disrupt
marital roles and routines, we found no effects of return co-
residence beyond a marginal decrease in parents' time together.
Neither transitions into nor out of coresidence are associated
with marital happiness and disagreements.
Similarly, we had wondered whether it mattered more
``which'' adult child leaves or returns, rather than ``whether''
that occurs. We separated out the effects of the same child
remaining or a different child entering the nest. We found no
difference between these two situations. In addition, the charac-
teristics of coresident children that we were able to incorporate
into these analyses exhibited little association with marital
quality. However, these are admittedly limited tests of this ques-
tion. Umberson (1989) concluded, as have other researchers
who focus on the effects of role incumbencies, that the context
is crucial, and that parenting can be a source of both benefits
and stress, depending on other factors. For coresidence such
factors may include the reasons for coresidence, presumably
reflecting problems in the child's life, the adult child's charac-
teristics, and the quality of both past and present parent­child
relations. It seems likely that, under some circumstances, returns
by ``problem'' children would indeed be a strain on marriages
or lead to more disagreements. However, this situation may
be rarer than the more routine returns, which have a mix of
mildly positive and negative consequences. Although we could
not address this directly in the context of these analyses, we
would argue that this is a promising avenue for further research.
Consistent with other research (e.g., that by Van Laningham
et al., 2001), we find that the presence of younger (minor)
children has more consistent associations with the quality of
parents' marital relations than the presence of adult children. As
we have noted, younger children in the household likely entail
more intensive and day-to-day parenting, with greater parental
effort and deflection from the spousal role. Our analyses also
suggest, however, an intriguing interaction between the pres-
ence of younger and older children: We find that the presence
of a coresident adult child may buffer the effects of a young
child on marital quality, perhaps because the adult child
assists the parents in various ways (e.g., babysitting).
An alternative explanation of the null effects for adult child
coresidence and marital quality is that coresidence is selective
of those with positive relationships. We noted earlier, however,
that White and Rogers (1997) found that parents and adult
children who coreside are not characterized by more positive
prior parent­child relations. This is supported by other analyses
using a different subset of the data used here, a subset that
enabled a focus on family relations over time with particular
children as they moved from adolescence into young adulthood
(Ward & Spitze, 2002). Those analyses found that the quality of
family relations during adolescence does not predict whether
children subsequently coreside when they reach young adult-
hood.
Thus, we would argue instead that coresidence and its
implications should be understood within the broader context
of parent­child relations. Parents and adult children exhibit
strong intergenerational ties along a number of dimensions of
solidarity, including contact and proximity, affection, feelings
of normative obligation, and exchanges of support (Logan &
Spitze, 1996; Lye, 1996; Umberson, 1992). Exchanges of as-
sistance between parents and adult children, and especially
from parents to adult children, are commonplace and expected.
Though only a minority of parents actively assist their adult
children at any particular time, and an even smaller minority
coreside, helping children is an expected part of the parental
role. These normal, and normative, intergenerational exchanges
CORESIDENCE AND MARITAL RELATIONS S7
appear to be managed by parents with generally little effect on
parent marital quality (Ward & Spitze, 1998). This extends to
coresidence, which most commonly occurs when children are
in young adulthood, a period when support from parents to
children is relatively high (Logan & Spitze, 1996). Rather than
viewing coresidence by adult children as ``counternormative''
and disruptive of the lives and relationships of parents, it can be
seen as a dimension of family solidarity and expected parent­
child exchange patterns.
