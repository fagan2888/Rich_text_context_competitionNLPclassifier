Introduction
The article 350A of the Indian Constitution states that every
state and local authority shall endeavor to provide adequate
facilities for instruction in the mother tongue (MT) at the
primary stage of education, for all children belonging to lin-
guistic minority groups. This has been reiterated in the
"Programme of Action" (POA, 1992), which is based on the
National Policy on Education (Department of Education,
Ministry of Human Resources and Development,
Government of India, 1986), as mentioned in a government
resolution (Curzon cited in Evans, 2002) inspired by Viceroy
Lord Curzon's statement way back in 1904:
As a general rule the child should not be allowed to learn English
as a language (i.e., as a subject) until he has made some progress
in the primary stage of instruction and has received a thorough
grounding in his mother-tongue. It is equally important that
when the teaching of English has begun, it should not be
prematurely employed as the medium of instruction in other
subjects. (pp. 277-278)
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF; 2005) devel-
oped by the National Council of Educational Research and
Training (NCERT) also strongly supports the use of mother
tongue at the primary stage in addition to promoting multi-
lingualism in the classroom. However, this decision has not
been implemented in practice. Rather, the medium of instruc-
tion in mother tongue at the primary stage has remained a
desirable component in school curricula.
This right (of instructional style/medium) remains com-
pletely with the state governments to decide the languages to
be used as mediums of instruction or as the subject at the pri-
mary stage. In fact, in our government education system, there
is no national-level policy on language for education. The

Instructional Style, Cognitive Processing,
and Achievement Behavior Patterns of
Schoolchildren: An Empirical Study
Atasi Mohanty1 and Swati Preeti Das2
Abstract
The objective of the study was to examine the performance characteristics and differences between English and Oriya
medium school children on various cognitive processing, reading, academic achievement, and teacher perception measures.
The sample consists of 243 schoolchildren, 120 from Grade IV and 123 from Grade VII from three different schools of
Cuttack city in Orissa, India. The children were individually administered the Figure-Copying, Raven's Progressive Matrices,
Matching Familiar Figure Task, Serial Recall, Digit-Span, Wechsler's Intelligence Scale for Children, Block Design, Cloze
Reading Comprehension, and Oral Reading tasks. Classroom Achievement scores on different subjects and the teachers'
ratings about their students were also taken. Results revealed that children reading in English medium schools outperformed
their Oriya medium counterparts in some cognitive measures such as Figure Copying, MFFT, RPM, and Digit-Span tasks
irrespective of levels. However, the children studying in Oriya medium schools scored higher in Reading Comprehension
task and commit less error compared with their English medium counterparts. However, in case of academic achievement
measures at primary level, the Oriya medium children performed better in social science, whereas the English medium
students excelled in first language and mathematics. The teachers of Oriya medium schools also rated their children better
in general conduct, motivation, and effort in schoolwork, whereas, at the secondary level, there was no difference between
these two groups in academic achievement or teacher perception measures.

private school system usually has the freedom to adopt any
choice of languages for the primary stage. In addition to state
official languages, most states have schools with other medi-
ums of instructions too. Subsequently, to address the various
demands of regional identity, retaining Hindi as a national link
language and to provide a place for English as the language of
progress and power, the "three language formula" was evolved
and implemented in 1968, but during the last two to three
decades, the demand for English medium schools has gradu-
ally been increasing. In the present day society, the importance
of mother tongue as a medium of instruction is gradually
decreasing, and the importance of English is gaining ground.
The English language, which is considered the second lan-
guage for most of us, has now become a part of India's multi-
lingual culture. In 1981, Pattanayak stated that in India,
"English is naturalized in certain of its uses, home-grown in
the midst of a multitude of languages, and complementary to a
host of languages in the daily routine, and at the most, operates
as an important auxiliary".
However, the role of using mother tongue as medium of
instruction, particularly for linguistic minorities, has been
emphasized by various studies (e.g., Cummins, 1984;
Skutnabb-Kangas, 1984). Even, for an effective educational
development of a second culture language of the majority
(national language), studies have pleaded for the necessity of
promoting the learners' proficiency in their mother tongue;
for example, Muyangwa and Mvakade (1998) found that the
pupils taught in mother tongue (Xhosa) performed better in
their academic achievement than those taught in English.
Ramasamy (2001) says that the balance is in favor of mother
tongue, especially for the lower socio-economic group.
However, parents prefer English as medium of instruction
for the career option of their children. This is also a fact that
children who study through their mother tongue get little
scope at the national level administrative posts and other
national/international jobs. Thus, in a multilingual country
like India, one cannot afford to remain monolingual in one's
mother tongue only. One has to learn several languages for
economic and social mobility. Hence, bilingual education is
emphasized. Studies have also shown that bilingual educa-
tion promotes cognitive growth, and convergent and diver-
gent thinking, and helps academic performance (e.g.,
Ben-Zeev, 1977; Cardenas, 1984). Researchers have sug-
gested that bilingualism involves an intense degree of cogni-
tive conflict, which facilitates language learning. Nanda
(1991) reports that medium of instruction is crucial for both
social and personality development of children. In a com-
parison of Oriya (mother tongue) and English (second lan-
guage) medium high school children, he found that English
medium school children were better in general cognitive and
socio- motivational competencies. The Oriya medium school
children were better in personal motivated competence, per-
sonality, and personal style. However, in another study in
Hong Kong high schools, Marsh, Hau, and Kong (2000)
compared the achievements of high school students studying
in Chinese (first language) and English (second language)
medium of instructions and found the negative effects of
English instruction in the achievement of most of the school
subjects, that is, history, geography, math, science.
The above review of empirical findings on the medium of
instruction influencing the cognitive processing, reading,
and academic achievements of children have shown mixed
and contradictory results. The impact of mother tongue as
medium of instruction vis-à-vis the use of non-mother
tongue, particularly English as medium of instruction, has
not only created a wide spread debate but also baffled the
policy makers all over the country. As a result, there is no
uniform standard prescribed for primary and secondary level
education in this country. While all the state governments of
India are running traditional schools with mother tongue as
medium of instruction at primary and secondary levels, the
central government (through Central Board of Secondary
Examination [CBSE]) and many private organizations
(through Indian Certificate for School Education [ICSE]) are
running schools in English medium both at the primary and
secondary levels. There is a growing trend and craze in the
Indian society not only in the urban but also in the semi-
urban and urban-slum areas to opt for the English medium
schools. Moreover, not many studies have been conducted in
this context to compare the performance and achievement
differences of students studying in different schooling sys-
tems/patterns. These reasons have prompted the present
researchers to take up this study and compare the perfor-
mance characteristics of Oriya and English medium school
children in Odisha. Due to the constraints of manpower,
time, and other resources, this study has been delimited to
the Cuttack city in Odisha, India.
Objectives
1. To examine the performance characteristics and dif-
ferences between English and Oriya medium school
children on various cognitive processing and reading
measures (both at primary and secondary levels of
education).
2. To assess the achievement behavior patterns of
English and Oriya medium school children in various
academic/school subjects.
3. To find out the grade differences (if any) among these
children.
Method
Subjects
Two Hundred forty-three schoolchildren were selected from
three different schools of the Cuttack city in Odisha, India:
1. Ravenshaw Collegiate School (Oriya medium
instruction), which follows the traditional state
Mohanty and Das 3
examination pattern and is managed by the Education
Ministry, Government of Odisha, India.
2. Kendriya Vidyalaya (English medium instruction),
Cuttack, which follows the CBSE pattern. This
school is under the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan,
managed by the Ministry of Human Resources
Development, Government of India.
3. Stewart School Cuttack (English medium instruc-
tion), an English medium missionary school follow-
ing the ICSE pattern of examination.
The Grades IV and VII children from all these three
schools were selected through stratified random technique.
From each school, 40 students (20 girls and 20 boys) were
drawn from each grade. In total, 120 students from Grade IV
and 123 students from Grade VII (60 girls and 60 boys from
Grade IV; 63 girls and 60 boys from Grade VII) were selected
as the sample. All these three schools had co-education pat-
tern, similar infrastructure, teacher­student ratio, and duly
qualified/trained teachers. With regard to the demographic
characteristics, the subjects were from service class/business
class background and middle-class/lower-middle-class fami-
lies. But the parents were very much concerned about their
children's education.
Design
The present study was quasi-experimental in nature having
two independent variables such as medium of instruction and
grade, each having two levels (i.e., English and Oriya,
Grades IV and VII) and 22 dependent measures.
Assessment Instruments
Broadly, four types of dependent measures were used to
examine the performance characteristics and differences
among the children of Oriya and English medium schools.
The first category of measure represented the cognitive mea-
sures, the second category included the reading measures,
and the third and fourth categories of measures represented
the academic achievement scores and teachers' perceptions,
respectively.
The following measures were administered individually
on all the subjects.
A. Cognitive Measures
Simultaneous Information Processing Tests
1. Figure Copying Task.
The tasks require the child to copy 15 geometrical figures,
which are visible to the child at all times, and the difficulty
level is increased gradually. Each drawing is scored 0, 1, or 2
according to the degree of correctness of reproduction.
Scoring criteria emphasize the maintenance of geometric
relation and proportions rather than exact reproduction. The
test was used as a good measure of simultaneous processing
in children (Das, Naglieri, & Kirby, 1994). The maximum
score was 30 and the time taken by the child to complete
each drawing was recorded, so that the mean of latency for
Figure Copying could be computed.
2. Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM).
RPM (Raven, 1983) is a test of intellectual (non-verbal) rea-
soning for ability consisting of 60 matrices or designs, each
having a part that has been removed. The task of the child is
to decide the missing part and insert it from six/eight possi-
ble alternatives given below. The child has to simultaneously
evaluate and search all the six/eight possible alternatives to
find out the correct portion. The 60 matrices are grouped into
five series, each comprising of 12 metrics having increasing
difficulty. The earlier series require accuracy of discrimina-
tion while the letter series involves analogies, permutation,
and alternation of the pattern and other logical relations. The
first two series have six possible alternatives, and the rest
three series have eight possible alternatives. In this study,
this test was used as a good measure of simultaneous pro-
cessing in children (Das et al., 1994). There was no time
limit for this test, and each subject took as much time as he
or she required to complete the matrices.
Successive Information Processing Tests
1. Digit-Span (Forward) Task.
The test is similar to the Wechsler's Intelligence Scale for
Children­Revised (WISC-R; Wechsler, 1974) Digit-Span
forward subtest. The experimenter reads out the series of dig-
its of increasing length, beginning with three digits, to a
maximum of nine digits. The child is required to recall a
series of digits, keeping the order of presentation intact. If a
child is unable to recall correctly any series of digits, he or
she should be given a second series of identical length. In the
present study, this task has been adopted as the successive
processing measure (Das et al., 1994). The maximum score
for Digit-Span (forward) task was 84.
2. Serial Recall Task.
The items of Serial Recall (similar to the WISC-R) were pre-
sented individually (taking equal pause in each item) by
means of a tape recorder. The subject's task was to recall a
series of words verbally keeping the order of presentation
intact. Twelve sets of items, 4 items in each category (having
the word length of 4, 5, and 6), which were either acousti-
cally similar (i.e., Amba, Ghara, Gacha, Nuga) or neutral
(Jala, Pani, Ghasa, Chuli) were presented in the Oriya lan-
guage/English language. The Oriya items were translated
into the English language for the English medium school
4 SAGE Open
children (1. Mango, House, Tree, Clothes; 2. Net, Water,
Grass, Fire); each series of words were scored taking into
account their correct serial position as 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.
The maximum/total score was 60 (Das et al., 1994).
Reflection­Impulsivity Information Processing Test
1. Matching Familiar Figure Task (MFFT).
The MFFT-20, which consists of 20 test items, was devel-
oped by Cairns and Cammock (1978). The MFFT 20 is suit-
able for use with children in primary and secondary grades.
This task was used in the present study. Each item consisted
of a standard picture of a common object (e.g., a house) and
six comparison pictures, one of which was identical to the
standard picture; the other five differed from it in a minute
and not easily identifiable detail. The task of the child was to
select the picture that exactly matches the standard; a maxi-
mum of five errors per item were allowed. Latency to first
response on each of the items and total number of errors were
recorded on all the 20 items. For each individual child, the
mean time (to first response) and total number of errors for
all 20 items were calculated at the end. This task was used to
assess the cognitive processing styles (reflective­impulsive)
of the children.
The WISC-R
1. Block Design Task.
The test is used to measure basic potentiality of a child in
terms of how the cognitive ability is utilized/organized for
successful performance in complex problem solving tasks.
WISC-R consists of 12 tests (6 on the verbal scale and 6 on
the performance scale) that constituted the Wechsler
Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC, 1949). In the present
study, the non-verbal performance subtest, Block Design,
was taken as a (non-verbal) reasoning task. In this task, there
were nine blocks (cubes) colored red on two sides, white on
two sides, and (diagonally) partially red-/white on two sides.
Eleven cards with different designs (bound into a booklet)
were there, and the subject's task was to make identical
designs by using these blocks. There was a maximum time
limit for each design, and extra bonus points were also given
for completing each item before the maximum time limit.
Reading Tests/Tasks
1. Oral Reading Task.
In the present study, the oral reading task consisted of few
sentences/a passage from the literature text books (Oriya/
English) of respective grades such as IV/VII. Each subject
was instructed to read these sentences aloud. The errors
made by the subjects were categorized as (a) number of
incorrect words, (b) number of words added, (c) number of
words omitted, and (d) number of words mispronounced.
Time taken and number of errors made in each category were
recorded for analysis.
2. CLOZE Reading Comprehension.
This is a CLOZE reading task for measuring the pupils'com-
prehension skill. CLOZE procedure is a technique in which
words are systematically deleted from a passage and the
reader is expected to replace the deleted words while reading
it. Stories were taken from the text books of Class IV and VII
in case of both English and Oriya medium schools. Every
8th, 9th, or 10th word was deleted so as not to destroy the
conceptual base of the story. The deletions were made care-
fully without hampering the contextual cues. For absolute
correct answer (semantically or syntactically), a score of 1
was given, and for unacceptable response/complete failure,
no score was given; 1/2 mark was given for partially correct
responses.
B. Achievement Measures
The achievement scores were collected from the half-yearly
examination reports of the schools in the following subjects:
medium of instruction language (MIL) Oriya/English, math-
ematics, science, social science as well as Grand total. The
scores on the above Classroom Achievement Measures gave
the idea of children's knowledge in language, reasoning abil-
ity, and general information storage.
C. Teacher Rating Measure
The class teachers of Grades IV and VII were asked to fill in
the Kendall and Wilcox's (1979) Self-Control Rating Scale
of child. This rating scale consists of 40 questions in which
the class teacher had to assess (on a 7-point rating scale) the
child's general conduct, self-control, behavior, motivation,
and effort in schoolwork.
Procedure
All the assessment instruments were individually adminis-
tered on the sample by the researcher in their respective
schools. Because there were several tests and tasks, which
required long hours of testing, the tests were administered in
two separate sessions. The achievement scores were col-
lected from the half-yearly examination records of all the
schools. The Teacher Rating scores of the subjects were
given by the respective class teachers.
Results
Out of total 16 cognitive variables, 8 variables showed statis-
tically significant effect for Grade IV Oriya and English
medium students (refer Tables 1 and 2). The English medium
students took less time to complete the Figure Copying task
Mohanty and Das 5
and got more scores than their Oriya medium counterparts.
They also committed less error in the MFFT task and scored
more in the Digit-Span than their Oriya medium counter-
parts. However, in the Serial Recall task, the Oriya medium
students scored higher than the English medium children.
The Oriya medium students' reading comprehension scores
were higher, and they read less number of incorrect words,
compared to their English medium counterparts. However,
the Oriya medium primary grade children omitted more
number of words in the reading passage than their English
medium counterparts.
Of the five Academic Achievement variables, three
showed statistically significant effect for Grade IV Oriya and
English medium students (MIL, mathematics, social sci-
ence). The English medium students scored better in MIL/
first language and mathematics whereas the Oriya medium
students scored higher in social science. The teacher percep-
tion variables (general conduct, self-control, behavior, moti-
vation, and effort in their studies) showed statistically
significant effect, and the Oriya medium students were rated
higher by their class teachers as compared with English
medium children.
Of the 16 cognitive variables, 8 variables showed statisti-
cally significant effect for Grade VII Oriya and English
medium students (refer Tables 3 and 4 here). The English
medium students took less time to complete the Figure
Copying, RPM, and MFFT tasks and scored better in Figure
Copying and Digit-Span tasks than their Oriya medium coun-
terparts. The English medium students scored less in
Comprehension task and took less time to read the reading
passage but read more number of incorrect words than their
Oriya medium counterparts. Of the 5 Academic Achievement
variables, all showed statistically insignificant effect for Grade
VII Oriya and English medium students. The teacher percep-
tion variables were also found to be statistically insignificant.

children of English medium schools took less time to complete
the tasks and scored higher in comparison with their Oriya
medium counterparts. The same trend was observed in case of
secondary grade. These findings support the earlier report by
Anand (1973) that English medium pupils showed higher non-
verbal intelligence than their Kannada medium counterparts.
Srivastava and Ramaswamy (1986) also reported the same
(while comparing the children of Tamil, Malayalam, and
English medium schools) and found that secondary grade chil-
dren of English medium schools scored higher on non-verbal
intelligence. More recently in cross-cultural context also,
Kirkici (2004) confirmed the view that bilingualism may act as
a facilitating trait in many respects, including the bilingual
child's cognitive and linguistic development.
The poor performance of students of Oriya medium
schools in the above non-verbal tasks may be due to their
non-exposure to such tasks. This fact was confirmed by the
children, that they were never exposed to such problem solv-
ing tasks, during the course of instruction in the school. From
the above findings, it is evident that the secondary level
Oriya medium children did not get the scope to improve their
non-verbal, problem solving skills, even after 3 more years
of schooling. The present findings suggested that the
secondary grade children of English medium schools were
probably more impulsive and tried to solve the problems as
quickly as possible. In contrast, the secondary grade Oriya
medium children were found to follow a reflective process-
ing strategy. However, this trend was not found in case of the
primary grade children. Probably, they had not developed an
analytical style of their own. It is also observed that the stu-
dents of English medium schools were so much overbur-
dened with their school tasks that they were less interested in
performing well in these problem solving tasks. Possibly,
this could be the reason why they had adopted an impulsive
processing strategy while solving the non-verbal reasoning
and simultaneous information processing tasks.
The successive processing tasks (Serial Recall and Digit-
Span) in this study involve the integration of stimuli into par-
ticular series, where the elements form a chain like
progression. The critical aspect of successive processing is
that elements must be ordered without surveyability, and ele-
ments should be linearly related. Verbal encoding and
rehearsal are very much needed, which help in storing infor-
mation in memory for successive processing. At the time of
retrieval in successive processing tasks, the items have to be
serially reproduced by the subjects. In the Serial Recall task,
Mohanty and Das 7
the primary grade children of Oriya medium schools scored
significantly higher than their English medium counterparts,
but at the secondary level, there was no significant difference
between them. From this finding, we could infer that may be,
the Oriya medium primary level children are more acquainted
with rote learning method, probably because the curriculum
emphasizes this skill in the traditional Oriya medium schools.
Apart from this, the words in the Serial Recall task might
have had a familiar rhythm, which made it easy for them to
recall quickly. In the Digit-Span task, the primary grade chil-
dren of English medium schools scored significantly higher
than their Oriya medium counterparts. The same trend was
also found at the secondary level. The secondary grade
English medium children scored higher than the Oriya
medium counterparts. The Digit-Span task is basically a
memory task. However, the immediate memory span of the
students depend on their habit pattern. From this finding, it
may be inferred that the children of English medium schools
are more acquainted to numerical pattern than the words used
in these tasks. In African Language research also, Ndamba
(2008) found that majority of parents as well as participants in
his study favored English as the language of instruction in the
primary grades, because English is a gateway to success in
schools and subsequent employment opportunity. In the pres-
ent study, in WISC-R Block Design non-verbal reasoning
task, the children of English medium schools had higher
mean scores compared with their Oriya medium counterparts,
both at the primary and secondary levels. In support of this, in
a study related to monolingualism, bilingualism, and medium
of instruction, Sampath (2005) found that levels of second
(Telugu and Tamil) language proficiency do not mediate
global intelligence and non-verbal intelligence; rather, when
children have a higher level of second language proficiency,
they perform better on verbal intelligence. The bilinguals pos-
sess an interactive language system, such as when speech is
perceived or produced in either language, the two language
capabilities influence each other, and a positive transfer takes
place when the second language learners utilize knowledge of
similar elements from first language (L1) in learning second
language (L2) (Jared & Kroll, 2001).

The Reading Comprehension task demands a conceptual
analysis of semantic and syntactic cues to fill in the missing
details. Researchers (Anderson, Hiebert, Scott, & Wilkinson,
1985) have argued that good comprehension ability depends
on proper synthesis of the past information already available
to the reader and the subject information available to him or
her through the text. Moreover, involvement of the reader,
sampling of words from the text, and awareness of the con-
text of reading situation lead to better comprehension of the
text (Richeck, List, & Lerner, 1989; Wixson, Peters, Weber,
& Roeber, 1987). Here, in the Comprehension task, the Oriya
medium children of primary grades achieved statistically
significant higher scores in comparison with their English
medium counterparts. The same trend was noticed at the sec-
ondary level. The secondary grade Oriya medium children
took slightly more time than the children of English medium
schools to complete the comprehension task (although this
mean difference was not statistically significant). In Oral
Reading task, the primary grade children of English medium
schools read significantly more number of incorrect words
compared with their Oriya medium counterparts. However,
the primary grade Oriya medium children omitted signifi-
cantly more number of words from the passage than their
English medium counterparts. The secondary grade children
of English medium schools took significantly less time to
read the passage but read significantly more number of incor-
rect words compared to their Oriya medium counterparts.
The secondary grade Oriya medium children took more time
to read the passage but made very few reading errors, prob-
ably because of their reflective processing strategies. From
this, we can assert that attention and cognitive processing
strategies are closely interlinked, even in case of oral read-
ing. Research has also shown that attention is a critical factor
for translating print into speech and plays a major role in
increasing the reading fluency (Radach, Kennedy, & Rayner,
2004; Reynolds & Besner, 2006).
Of the five Achievement variables (MIL/first language,
mathematics, science, social science, and global marks), the
English medium children of primary grades got higher grades
in MIL/first language and mathematics compared to the
Oriya medium counterparts. In support of this, Srivastava
and Khatoon (1980) also reported that English medium chil-
dren got higher scores in first language compared with the
Kannada medium counterparts. The primary grade children
of Oriya medium schools got significantly higher grades in
social science compared with their English medium

counterparts. This finding may suggest that the Oriya
medium school children are more acquainted with rote learn-
ing at the primary level. However, these findings are contrary
to the findings of Marsh et al. (2000) who reported that the
primary children of Chinese medium schools achieved
higher scores in mathematics, science, and social science as
compared with their English medium counterparts. Because
the classroomAcademicAchievement measures are not stan-
dardized tools, the difference between the two mediums of
instruction might be due to subjectivity and difference in
teacher perception variables. At the secondary level, there
was no significant difference in all the five achievement
measures of the children of Oriya and English medium
schools. These data are contrary to the findings reported pre-
viously by Basavayya (1980) where it was reported that chil-
dren of English medium schools are superior to their
counterparts in Kannada medium in academic achievement
scores. Considerable evidence is also available regarding the
finding that executive attention network plays a major role in
the acquisition of school subjects such as literacy (Mc
Candliss, Beck, Sandak, & Perfetti, 2003) and numeracy, and
in a wide variety of other subjects (Posner & Rothbart, 2007).
In the teacher perception variable, the primary grade chil-
dren of Oriya medium schools were rated significantly higher
by their class teachers compared with their English medium
counterparts. The teachers of Oriya medium schools per-
ceived that their children exercised more self-control, had
more motivation to learn, and put in more efforts, and in gen-
eral, showed less behavior problems. However, the teachers
of English medium schools rated their children to have less
self-control, to be impulsive, and to have had more general
conduct and behavior problems. It is generally found that the
primary level children of Oriya medium schools are more
disciplined and are afraid of their teachers. At the secondary
level, the teacher perception variable scores were almost
similar for the children of both Oriya and English medium
schools.
In summary, the major findings of the present study reveal
that the students of the English medium schools at both the
levels (primary and secondary) were found to be superior in
most of the non-verbal cognitive processing tasks. This could
be attributed to the reason that the Oriya medium children
might not have received enough stimulation to improve their
non-verbal problem solving skills, even at the secondary
level. Probably, they were not well-exposed to various prob-
lem solving tasks, which require different information pro-
cessing strategies to solve novel tasks. As a result, these
children lacked potential skills and aptitude for solving prob-
lems beyond their syllabus. Even their parents seem to be
more traditional and did not expose them to sufficient extra-
curricular activities other than the school curriculum.
However, the children of English medium schools were
found to be more impatient and impulsive to get over a task,
which is not related to their classroom academic achieve-
ment--especially at the secondary level. The general trend
observed (in case of parents and teachers) is that there is
more encouragement and reward for high classroom achieve-
ment among children rather than encouraging them for more
creative and innovative work beyond the prescribed curricu-
lum. Thus, it is suggested that some reforms in the school
curriculum and general set-up of the school environment be
made in the traditional schools. The school curriculum must
give scope to children to develop creative and problem solv-
ing skills. The pedagogy of Oriya medium schools has to be
changed from rote learning method to constructive learning.
The teaching­learning process should emphasize activity-
centered learning and ensure the all-round development of
children.
In the reading measures, the Oriya medium children at
both the levels have outperformed their English medium
counterparts. In this study, because the Oriya medium chil-
dren are mostly monolinguals, they have a better control
over the first language/mother tongue. This is also a well-
researched fact that children learn best in their mother tongue
as a prelude to and complement of bilingual and multilingual
education (Ball, 2010). Fluency and literacy in the mother
tongue lay a cognitive and linguistic foundation for learning
additional languages. Thus, when children receive formal
instruction in their first language throughout primary studies
and then gradually shift to academic learning in the second
language, they learn the second language quickly. If they
continue to have opportunities to develop their first language
skills in secondary school, they emerge as fully bilingual/
multilingual learners. If, however they are forced to switch
abruptly from their mother tongue to schooling in a second
language, their first language acquisition may be attenuated
or even lost. This has also happened in the present study. For
English medium children, although English was their first
language in the school as well as medium of instruction,
these children were having either Oriya or Hindi as their
mother tongue. They used to speak Oriya or Hindi at home,
in the neighborhood, and with their peers/playmates.
Therefore, it is very natural that these children performed
less well in reading and comprehension tasks in comparison
with their Oriya medium counterparts. The probable reason
could be that the English medium children were less profi-
cient in both the languages (mother tongue and school lan-
guage) as they were using these as the substitute not
supplementary to each other. Moreover, it is also found that
the general attitude toward tasks other than the school tasks
was indifference, which resulted in lower level of verbal
ability. This aspect was more prominent at the secondary
level when they rushed through the reading passage just to
finish the task and read on enormous number of incorrect
words. Instead of showing an improvement from primary
grades, they deteriorated further at the secondary level.
In academic achievement measures, at primary level, the
English medium students performed better in the English
language and mathematics, whereas the Oriya medium stu-
dents performed better in social studies. However, at the
10 SAGE Open
secondary level, there was no such significant difference.
These achievement tests were not standardized and could
not be accepted as error-proof. Many researchers have
reported that bilingualism involves an intense degree of
cognitive conflict, which facilitates language learning. It is
also revealed in the present study that the level of profi-
ciency and exposure matter a lot in determining the cogni-
tive flexibility of children. In tune to this, the present
researchers also advocate for improving the language profi-
ciencies in both the first and second languages through
more supplementary reading materials, besides the courses
in the curriculum, and adopting more innovative as well as
problem solving approaches in the teaching­learning pro-
cess. The school curriculum should be designed to promote
equally the children's non-verbal reasoning and higher
order cognitive skills.
