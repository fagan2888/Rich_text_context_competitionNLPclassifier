Introduction
A person addressing a large group of people trying to per-
suade them to accept particular ideas and get them to carry
out various actions by making specific choices or judgments
is called an orator (Procter, 1978). The power of orators and
the significant role of their speech have irrefutably been
influential in affecting the results of different types of social
unrests and revolutions, with the goal of motivating the pub-
lic to oppose discrimination and unfair situations, overturn-
ing the oppressors, and building the cornerstones of a
flourishing society. Orators skillfully utilize particular intel-
ligible semantic and grammatical structures to comfort the
upset, to praise the people and events deserving respect and
pride, to inspire people to surpass for altruistic activities, to
endanger their lives by taking daunting risks, to cry, and/or to
laugh aloud. Therefore, speech makers usually carry a heavy
responsibility on their shoulders whatever their purpose is,
good or evil, and their sermon is an interesting area of
research because it has a determinant of part in the final
destination and directions of the societies to which they
belong (McKay & McKay, 2008).
An evidence from etymology indicates that the term ser-
mon originated from a Middle English word borrowed from
old French, which had in turn been taken from the Latin
word "sermo" signifying "discourse." Involving such dis-
course components such as clear and detailed explanation,
admonishment, and reasonable application, sermon stylisti-
cally adopts a scriptural, philosophical, religious, or moral

Abstract
Inspired by critical discourse analysis and regarding language as a social medium whereby individuals, social groups, and
institutions tend to express their beliefs and values, this study seeks to explore the persuasion and discourse strategies utilized
in sermons. By focusing on the sermon of an influential native English orator and by employing Wodak's discourse­historical
approach, it aims to investigate how the targeted religious genre unfolds to disclose the persuasive powers of the orator and
its impact on the audience. The results obtained from the qualitative analysis of the corpus under investigation revealed that
the speaker resorts to significant presentation of a wide range of topics to establish the oratory, and constructs the social
actors through the application of nomination tools to qualify the selected actors through carefully formulated predication
devices by laying out discursively logical justifications concerning various topos. Alternatively, the complementary quantitative
corpus analysis using Corpus Presenter software also provided an insightful evidential basis reflecting orator's involvement,
intensification of the intended illocutionary force, and his utilization of thought-provoking linguistic resources. Notably, the
results presented here may shed light on the function of intertextuality in the genre of the sermon operationalized and
activated through nomination strategies, the tools of argumentation theory, and interdiscursivity. Second, language learners'
awareness of such elements may have an overriding importance in the process of text generation in speaking and writing
processes.

point and usually aims to clarify a kind of law over a wide
period of time. Not surprisingly, we likewise regard the pres-
ent-day language meaning of sermon as a monolog, which in
its mainstream sense derogatorily portrays a protracted and
monotonous type of discourse conveyed with incredible
enthusiasm by any individual to an uninterested group of
onlookers.
Critical discourse analysis as a well-established model in
modern linguistics was introduced in the early 1990s under
an opportunity provided by the University of Amsterdam to
bring together scholars such as Van Dijk, Fairclough, Kress
and Leeuwen, and Wodak (Wodak, 2001) to specify its dif-
ferent approaches. Critical discourse analysis considers sci-
ence to be confined but not free in different principles
(Schiffrin, Tannen, & Hamilton, 2001); furthermore, it sees
language as a value-constructed structure (Fairclough &
Wodak, 1997). Its grand antecedent, critical linguistics, was
strongly influenced by the College of East Anglia in England
amid 1970s. It tried to establish a social view of linguistics
focusing on force connections as a focal hypothetical issue
and text as its primary unit of analysis. Critical discourse
analysis incorporates discourse as the most widely used lan-
guage specifically used by a particular group under specific
social implications and qualities, for example, Muslims dis-
course or Christians discourse (Flowerdew, 2013). The
investigation of social issues, power relations, society, and
culture is addressed in critical discourse analysis to fathom
out the possible ideological and historical orientations
embedded in texts created by their authors (Fairclough &
Wodak, 1997).
There are different approaches to critical discourse analy-
sis (CDA) of which the most current ones are historical, cog-
nitive, and relational- dialectic. The first one suggested by
Wodak (2001) assumes power, ideology, and history from a
common ground for professionals in linguistics, semiotics,
and discourse analysis despite the seemingly different back-
ground knowledge they advocate. This approach is problem
oriented and mainly focuses on the inquiry of changes in dis-
course practice over a long period of time and across differ-
ent genres. The second is the cognitive approach adopted by
Van Dijk (1993), whose fundamental aim was to explore rac-
ism and discrimination by examining the belief system, set-
ting, and information comprising a particular discourse.
Finally, the third was introduced by Fairclough (1989) and
aimed to investigate important changes happening in our
advanced world and their impact on the general population's
strategies for communication.
Literature Review
Utilizing Fairclough's (1989) relational­dialectic approach,
Gowhary, Rahimi, Azizifar, and Jamalinesari (2015) exam-
ined the Iranian presidential talks and demonstrated that the
targeted candidates were extraordinarily influenced by their
diverse political strands, making them take different positions
in their political, social, and ideological viewpoints in por-
trayals, explanations, clarifications, and description of numer-
ous texts within the same topic. Dastpak and Taghinezhad
(2015) studied the persuasion strategies in Obama's political
speeches demonstrating a comprehensive picture of U.S.
society and the need for solidarity. In another study, Weiwei
and Weihua (2015) examined news reports from critical dis-
course analysis perspective and described how belief systems
may be uncovered through lexical order, transitivity, and
change affecting news reports as a result of social practice.
Alternatively, Zhang's (2014) investigation of political news
reports on Iraq war by U.S. media demonstrated that the news
report language is one sided and affected by social qualities
and belief systems.
Similarly, Poorebrahim and Zarei (2013) considered
Islam's delineation in western media in light of Van Dijk's
idea of "ideological square" and Edward Said's thought of
"orientalism" and showed that Islam and Muslims are
adversely depicted through special constructions and linguis-
tic choices imposed on headlines. In a different CDA study,
Biria and Mohammadi (2012) examined Obama and Bush's
inaugural discourse to shed light on the logical gadgets and
verbose procedures utilized by the presidents to express their
political perspectives. The writers utilized two CDA models,
Van Dijk's (2006) and Cheng's (2006), and indicated that
both speakers made an objective use of positive self-presen-
tation and negative other presentation, which were rooted in
their distinct political belief systems. This methodology was
likewise put into practice by Keshavarz and Alimadadi
Zonoozi (2011) focusing on grammatical and lexical ele-
ments comprising the nature of the belief systems in transla-
tion of political writings. They found that syntactic structures
and semantic discourse strategies are fundamental devices in
the hand of the translator to force positive self-presentation
and negative other presentation.
Surprisingly, more current investigations in the field of
CDA have prompted a recharged enthusiasm for the exami-
nation of religious speeches. Sharaf Eldin (2014) utilized
CDA for Amr Khalid's sermons to explore the Islamic talk
and to locate the ideological resources taking into account
Thompson's (1990) five philosophy modes. He explained
that the speaker made an intelligent use of acknowledgment,
reacting and recollecting as three fundamental rhetorical
devices to demonstrate his comprehension of the prevailing
social conditions and to help the audience to remember their
religion qualities and standards. In point of fact, the orator
employed persuasion strategies as the pillar of his sermon.
Focusing on majlis-e Hussain in Shi'ah Muslims of
Pakistan, Rizwan (2011) adopted a CDA approach to iden-
tifying such linguistic devices as pronominalization and
recontextualization to demonstrate how context can be used
to secure an assortment of themes whose main purpose is to
establish a feeling of solidarity and love for the Prophet's
family. With a reasonable depiction of organized moves,
the author tries to demonstrate the speakers' incentive in
Mansouri et al. 3
building a mental model based on the religious conventions
of the targeted genre.
In a similar study but in a different context, Cipriani's
(2002) made a profound examination of two written sermons
presented by the orator in the Universal Church of the
Kingdom of God to investigate and find reciprocal power
relations in terms of the social domains (Fairclough, 1989,
1992) and components of hortatory texts (Longacre, 1992).
She also observed that the sermons made an extraordinary
measure of ideological power foundations based on social
qualities presented and utilized in the Bible stories.
The related empirical studies have basically analyzed the
discourse of religious settings; however, far too little atten-
tion has been paid to sociopragmatic aspects of sermons
from a historical­discourse approach. On this basis, the main
objective of the present study was to use a critical discourse
approach to investigate a native English sermon delivered on
the subject of "Returning to God."
The Study
Research Purpose
Recognizing the operational merits of discourse­historical
approach, the present study aimed at investigating orator's
use of nomination and argumentation strategies in delivering
religious sermons focusing on distinctive devices in view of
the issue under scrutiny within the limits of the historical set-
tingwithinwhichthediscourseismaterialized.Consequently,
the article tends to add to the related literature on CDA by
fixating its focus on a particular sermon to explore the
selected English sermon based on the methodology delin-
eated in Figure 1. In other words, by regarding English as an
international language facilitating communication for the
people who widely vary in their ability to use the language
and those whose mother tongue is not similar, this article
tries to contribute to an insightful understanding of a specific
genre to compensate for the likely misinterpretation of the
text that may lead to communication breakdown.
Corpus and Justification
A transcript consisting of a 5,602-word sermon available at
http://www.nakcollection.com/transcripts.html (number 122)
titled "Returning to God" delivered by a native English orator
called Nouman Ali Khan was chosen based on a convenient
sampling method. This orator is the head of Bayyinah Institute
and has already served in different scholarly positions such as
teaching Islamic studies at the Muslim Center, a clergyman
for the Adelphi College, Arabic professor at Nassau junior
college, and chief of instruction at Masjidaru-l-Qur'an. At
present, Nouman is engaged in the development and support
of Bayyinah, which has more than 6,000 students. He has
been a prominent figure in various translations and research
projects concerning classic Arabic curriculum development,
linguistic analysis, and tafseer of the Qur'an. Nouman's com-
prehension of the language and tafseer has had a profound
effect on various classical and contemporary researchers.
Procedures
The qualitative critical analysis of the targeted oratory
involves successive examinations of the text adopting a sen-
tence-by-sentence analysis of the full text. In point of fact,
the transcript of the spoken sermon on the theme of
"Returning to God was taken from http://www.nakcollec-
tion.com/transcripts.html (number 122). To do the analysis,
based on the first dimension (i.e., content or topic establish-
ment), the sermon was considered in light of the historical
fundamental aspect of returning to Allah and examination of
its interdiscursive and intertextual viewpoints. The next part
of our qualitative analysis required the examination of the

sermon in terms of the adopted nomination, predication, and
argumentation strategies. The quantitative analysis of this
oratory was made possible by a software called Corpus
Presenter, which was essential for activating two additional
discourse strategies, namely, perspectivization and intensifi-
cation/mitigation as well as the linguistic means utilized in
the corpus. The results are presented in Figure 2, Figure 3,
and Table 1.
Adopted Framework and Data Analysis
The analysis of the corpus was accomplished based on the
taxonomy suggested by Wodak (2001) called discourse­his-
torical approach. Wodak (2001) takes a triangulatory tactic
based on the notion of context, which involves four layers.
The first layer, a descriptive one, is related with the text
internal aspects such as cotext, co-discourse, and the imme-
diate language. The second layer is concerned with the inter-
discursive and intertextual relationships between texts,
namely, discourses, genre and utterances. The third layer is
that of institutional frames and extra-linguistic social vari-
ables of the specified context. Finally, the fourth layer is
related with the historical and wide-ranging sociopolitical
context dominating the discourse. This article, however,
mainly focuses on the dimensions depicted in Figure 1.
As this figure indicates, this taxonomy has three dimen-
sions. The first dimension, content or topic establishment, pro-
vides the authors, speakers, and orators (in this article) with
tools of creating the specific content or topics of a particular
discourse. The second dimension, which is an investigation of
discourse strategies, refers to approximately precise actions
and mostly intentional plan of discursive tools to gain a par-
ticular purpose, political, social, linguistic or psychological
(Wodak, 2001). To clarify the investigation of the second
dimension, we try to find how the orator constructs the in-
groups and out-groups by referential/nomination strategy
through devices such as anthroponyms, metaphors, metony-
mies, and verbs and nouns used to signify processes and
actions. The predication strategy is an analysis of the traits,
characteristics, features, and qualities attributed to the in-
groups and out-groups through synecdoches and negative and
positive qualities. Argumentation strategy is the application of
topoi or loci as either clear or implied compulsory premises.
They are conclusion rules, which associate the argument with
the claim or conclusion. As such, they rationalize shift from
the argument/s to the conclusion/s. The perspectivization strat-
egy clarifies the point of view from which in-groups, out-
groups, and the arguments are described by the orator and
includes deictics (which are traditionally of person [I, you,
me], place [this, that, here, there], and time [now, went] types;
Fillmore, 1971/1997), and direct/indirect quotation as its tools
of which the frequency is shown in Figure 2.
And finally, the overt and covert expression of these
points of views is shown by the intensification/mitigation
strategy of which the devices are "modals, tag questions,
subjunctives, hesitations, vague expressions, hyperboles,
litotes, indirect speech acts, and verbs of saying, thinking
and feeling" (Wodak, 2001, p. 93).
The last but not the least dimension of the adopted tax-
onomy is the linguistic means investigation through type
and token analysis. An example illuminates the type­
token distinction. Considering the sentence "I am an early
bird because I believe in the early bird catches the worm,"
we find 15 word-tokens and 11 word-types because of the
twice occurrences of "the," "I," "early," and "bird." Each
word-token stands for, signifies, represents, denotes a
particular word-type and the word-type itself shares
essential formal features with tokens. The analysis of
these linguistic means is done by utilizing a corpus analy-
sis software called Corpus Presenter (http://www.uni-
due.de/CP), which provided us with the following
frequency results.
The most frequent linguistic elements are also shown in
Figure 3.
Results and Discussion
The discussion of the results begins with an elaboration on
the general idea of Quran and Islam about returning to Allah.
It helps us to develop a historical background of the dis-
course under discussion, which is necessary in regard with
the first dimension, content or topic establishment, of the
adopted model, discourse­historical approach.
The word tawbah (repentance) in Arabic truly signifies
"to return" as is specified in the Qur'an. In an Islamic setting,
it alludes to the demonstration of leaving what Allah has dis-
allowed and coming back to what he has told. The demon-
stration of repentance can reclaim the transgressions and

give the chance to go to Paradise. These honors are noted in
Quran verse as follows:
O you who have believed, repent toAllah with sincere repentance.
Perhaps your Lord will remove from you your misdeeds and
admit you into gardens beneath which rivers flow [on] the Day
when Allah will not disgrace the Prophet and those who believed
with him. Their light will proceed before them and on their right;
they will say, "Our Lord, perfect for us our light and forgive us.
Indeed, You are over all things." [At-Tahriim 66:8].
In spite of the fact that repentance is considered as one
act that can be utilized for purging the wrongdoings, Quran
noticed that the majority of the transgressions are pardoned
with or without repentance besides the condition of Shirk.
The Shirk is the demonstration of worshiping another
divinity other than Allah. The trusting individual needs to
obligatory apologize for Shirk sin, to be pardoned by
Allah.
Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He
forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. And he who
associates others with Allah has certainly fabricated a
tremendous sin. [An-Nisaa 4:48]
Islam does not acknowledge the idea of original sin, but it
shows that a man is conceived in a condition of innocence
and unadulterated belief. The individual stays in that condi-
tion of righteousness as long as he or she has not achieved
the time of adolescence after which he or she is responsible
for his or her wrongdoings.
Intertextuality and interdiscursivity are two layers of the
model shown in Figure 1. The link to other texts "through
invoking a topic, an event or a main actor" (Richardson &
Wodak, 2009, p. 46) is called intertextuality. This element of
persuasion is utilized through reference to Quran verses,
some of which are mentioned in Table 2.
The analysis reveals that the author utilizes these verses to
expand the topic of "returning to Allah" because of the dis-
cussion between Allah and somebody who has committed
many wrongdoings so that she or he has totally lost trust.
What is more, she or he feels as if she or he is so sinful that
now she or he is never going to have the capacity to become
a good person again and feels like achieving a final point.
The second case of intertextuality helps the orator to teach
how to return to Allah through surrendering ego, controlling
tongue, growing good habits, leaving misbehaviors and
temptations, which are better to be done before the punish-
ment and then it will not be helpful. The third one explains
how Allah forgives all the sins in one shot if and only if the
wrongdoer does not lose his or her hope. The conversation
between Allah and wrongdoers in the Day of Judgment is
another case of intertextuality, which implies "Man, I wish
Allah had just guided me, I would've been good, I just . . . He
didn't." So, in other words, he is saying "it's not my fault."
What is he saying? "It's Allah's fault, it's not my fault." But
Allah responds "No, you're lying. I did send you the ayaat."
These ayaat are in Quran, the holy book. This native English
orator also mentions one of the verses of Surah Nisa that
determines the importance of right of parents after the right
of God.
The relationship between discourses in one topic and the
other discourses on other topics or subtopics is called inter-
discursivity; for instance, discourse on climate change
(Reisigl & Wodak, 2009) overlaps with the topics such as
anthropogenic climate change, static environmentalist think-
ing, victim of communism, permanent change of nature,
human contribution to climate change, to name a few. The
critical discourse analysis of the "FPÖ petition `Austria first'
(1992-3)" done by Wodak (2001) also involves 11 topics,
some of which are neoliberal proposals, career women, tradi-
tional gender roles, and over-foreignization. And, the oratory
discourse on returning to Allah is interwoven with 25 dis-
course topics as Table 3 illustrates.
Synecdoche, metanomy, metaphor, deictic and phoric
expressions, and collectives that establish membership and
create insiders and outsiders, discourse objects, processes,
and actions (Wodak, 2001) are some of the tools of nomina-
tion/referential strategy of discourse in the second dimension
of Wodak's model. Reisigl and Wodak's (2009) actor analy-
sis in the discourse on climate change indicated Friedrich
Hayek, policy makers, environmentalists, old Marxists, tax-
payers and lot of the other persons, objects, and phenomenon
in nomination strategies. They also found the attributions
such as liberal, centralist, wasteful, and detrimental as the

qualities used for the social actors in predication strategies.
The actor analysis of this sermon reveals that God, who
speaks to His slaves, and the sinful person, the main addressee
of God in this oratory, are the main social actors, which are
built both overtly and overtly throughout the whole text by
reference and predication. The other important social actors
are God's messenger, I, we, the young, you, and Shaitan
listed with their predications in Table 4.
Now, we can talk about argumentation discourse strategy,
which is utilized to legitimize the negative and positive attri-
butions forced by predicative technique. Distinctive sorts of
topoi or loci (Figure 1) are utilized as the gadgets of this
discourse strategy to interface the contention with the con-
clusion, and to explain the verifiable or unequivocal prem-
ises. Wodak (2001) determined the use of a great range of
different topos in "Austrian first" analysis, namely, topoi of
consequence to discuss against foreigners and topos of bur-
den, threat, and culture to request the separation of school
children based on their knowledge of German (for a compre-
hensive and complete definition of all topos, you can see
Wodak, 2001, p. 78). This sermon starts with the topoi of
model suggesting the messenger of God is the first and the
best to call people to God, therefore, we follow and duplicate
him as a model when we want to call people to Allah. This
topos is again used in the third paragraph implying that tak-
ing care of and modeling 53rd verse of 39th surah is neces-
sary if we want to talk to people immersed in sin because it
teaches us what should be told to them. Next, topo of defini-
tion is utilized to interpret musrif as the one who does lots of
sins and goes beyond the limits, to delimit slaves to those
who obey and love master and listen to everything the master
says, and to demarcate animal as being accustomed to shame-
lessness and doing whatever they feel like. This topo is
applied over the last pages to interpret the concept of apathy,
which is a manifestation of arrogance, obsessed, and inflated
ego. Then, topo of harm highlights that those who have
transgressed against their own selves, crossed the limits,
broke the rules, and disobeyed the regulations are only harm-
ing their own selves. It also provides an in-depth account of
the sinful persons as those who harm themselves by seeing
something shameless. The orator also uses the topo or fallacy
of problem to explain two issues the young are encountering,

others, (4) Setting limits, (5) Breaking the rules, (6) Harming

namely, overexposition to shamelessness and no respect to
parents. Behaving impolitely to parents makes a person less
of a human and seeing shameless things does not conform
with human convictions and values, therefore, one should
not perform them, presented by the topo of humanitarianism
in this oratory. The orator believes that as far as Allah gave
human beings a sense of shame, the more they deal with
shamelessness, the closer they become to animals, topo of
consequence.
The next discourse strategy is called perspectivization,
framing, or discourse representation highlighted by report-
ing, narration, quotation, and description of utterances and
events all of which help the orators express and position
their own idea and point of view and frame and represent
discourse. This discourse strategy also arranges their opin-
ions and visions and conveys the involvement or distance.
As the line graph of frequencies (Figure 2) shows, there are
810 persons, 83 places, 480 time deictics, and 53 quotations
in 883 sentences of the oratory, which establish perspec-
tives of the author based on an interpretation of verses of
the Holy Book. It enables the orator to completely involve
his own because he is guiding the listeners based on ideolo-
gies of the Holy Book. In this English oratory, the listeners
are first provided with a direct quotation from the Muslims
holy book, Quran, and its description and interpretation to
explain two conversations in this verse, one between Allah
and prophet and another one is between Allah and someone
who is sinful. Then, the orator describes some practical
examples to elaborate on what it means that the sinful harm
themselves. There is also a description of two things that
are eating away the life of the Muslim youth and reducing
them not just from a believer but even from human beings
to animals. The cartoons of Jimmy Neutron, African
American family on Disney TV, and Pryo Cat are narrated
to show their effects on the kids'behavior to consider them-
selves smart and their parents stupid. The feelings of a
wrongdoer and the Evil's trick are mentioned to indicate the
main reason of disappointment and not returning to God.
Allah is directly quoted "It is He who is forgiving and mer-
ciful," and it is interpreted structurally to say that Allah is
extremely forgiving and always merciful and not to take
advantage of thinking Allah's always going to forgive. That
door is not always open. The narration of another verse of
Quran helps the orator to elaborate on the concept of avoid-
ance and to suggest the wrongdoer surrender ego, and leave
temptations, bad habits, tongue, and eye sins, wasting of
time and misbehavior. The conversation between Allah and
the sinful on Day of Judgment is quoted to help the audi-
ence imagine when the wrongdoer says "Oh! If only Allah
guided me, I would have been good. Had only Allah guided
me, I could've been from people who fear, people who are
. . . , who are conscious of the rights and wrongs" and God
answers "No, I did, I sent ayaat" or guidance that was the
holy book, Quran. At last, the orator describes the effect of
hip-hop music on people making them not just animals but
worse than animals because it makes them full of self-
obsession with the use of pronoun me all over the lyrics.
Mitigation/intensification as the fifth discourse strategy
"modifying the epistemic status of a proposition" (Wodak,
2001, p. 73) is evident in its intensification side because the
orator uses verses of Holy Quran to discuss his intended
topic. His use of direct quotations of Allah enables him to
speak with certainty implied in the repeated use of simple
present tense with you as the main subject (383 cases), help-
ing the orator to make a friendly relationship with the audi-
ence and imperative sentences all over the text, giving the
orator a position of authority. There were no cases of the
verbs feeling, thinking, and saying, no tag questions and just
69 modals, which are hedges helping the orator to stand
away from what the proposition states. Despite no use of
hedges, the questions (110 cases), asked and answered by the
speaker himself, are frequently used for emphasis and attrac-
tion of the listeners' attention. (For example, who is the
model are we trying to duplicate? It's the model of the mes-
senger of Allah, Who's talking? Who says "My slaves"?
Does the messenger say "My slaves," or does Allah say "My
slaves"? Allah says "My slaves.")
The linguistic means, the last but not the least dimension
of discourse historical­approach, include types and tokens.
Type alludes the genuine things themselves, for instance, -ed
or -ing and token are the real use of these structures in a cor-
pus, that is, the utilization of the past tense form in the words,
for example, worked or playing. The use of a software called
Corpus Presenter enabled the authors to analyze this 5,602-
token and 1,085-type sermon. As the line graph (Figure 3)
shows the best recurrence of simple present tense (is, know,
do, and don't) demonstrating the significance of communi-
cating general truth, rehashed activities, or constant circum-
stances, giving guidelines or bearings in the sermons. The
utilization of you, Allah, I, and your as the most frequent
actors demonstrates the close distance between the speaker
and hearer and the inclination of the orator to give guidelines
and express summons or demands in the sermons.
Conclusion and Implication
This study set out to research an English sermon from the
perspective of critical discourse analysis based on the
Wodak's (2001) discourse­historical approach. The subject
investigation results demonstrate the intertextuality, men-
tioning the verses of the Muslims holy book, and distinctive
classes and topics on which this sermon is by and large
based. The discoveries show the strength of nomination/ref-
erential discourse requiring the utilization of context to
understand the religious content. The investigation of argu-
mentation techniques showed the utilization of various topoi,
specifically, model and definition topoi. Depiction of the
Day of judgment, portrayal of the effects of cartoons on chil-
dren, citations of Holy Quran, the utilization of basic and
straightforward current states of the world, and the problems

that the young nowadays have are the clearest instruments
with respect to the perspectivization and semantic intends to
fortify the speaker in influence. Despite the fact that the
extent of the present study is restricted, yet it can add to a
developing collection of writing in the critical discourse
analysis helping the second language learners of English to
form experiences into each language genre and help them go
about as experts; show them how to compose, understand, or
decipher others; and equip them with the capacities and
understandings, which are preconditions to end up universal
speakers.
