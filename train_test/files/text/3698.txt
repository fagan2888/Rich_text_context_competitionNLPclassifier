Introduction
Compulsory voting, which is used in some form by close
to 30 countries, is provocatively linked to low-"quality"1
votes (e.g., Dassonneville et al., 2017; Hooghe and Stiers,
2017; Selb and Lachat, 2009; Singh, 2016a). Such low-
quality votes are thought to come about because manda-
tory voting brings to the voting booth individuals with low
levels of political sophistication, who tend not to cast well-
reasoned ballots. Do these compelled voters fail to cast
well-reasoned ballots strictly due to their relative lack of
political sophistication, or do these choices reflect a lack
of meaningful engagement?
We engage with these questions, theorizing that the link
between compulsory voting and low-quality vote choices is
mechanized by both voter sophistication levels and deci-
sion-making processes. We expect that those who feel com-
pelled to vote expend systematically less effort when
formulating their vote choices, as compared to those who
turn out voluntarily, even after we take into account political
sophistication.
We test our expectations with an election simulation, in
which we track the behavior of a representative sample of
about 2000 Australians. Our findings show that those who
report being compelled by Australia's mandatory voting
law tend to spend less time seeking out political informa-
tion, and they engage with fewer pieces of information.
While differences in political sophistication among com-
pelled and non-compelled voters account for a portion of
this pattern, feeling compelled also has an independent
effect on the character of voters' information searches.
Finally, using an experimental manipulation reported in
the supplementary material, we find no evidence that the

Abstract
Compulsory voting is known to produce a relatively weak match between voters' ballot choices and their
preferences. We theorize that this link, in part, exists because compelled voters are relatively unlikely to seek out
political information during an election campaign, even after differences in political sophistication across compelled
and voluntary voters are taken into account. To test our expectations, we use a simulation of an Australian election,
through which we track participants' information searches. Our findings show that those who do not turn out
voluntarily under Australia's compulsory voting law tend to spend less time seeking out political information, and
they engage with less information. While differences in political sophistication between those who feel compelled
to vote and those who do not account for a portion of this pattern, feeling compelled also has an independent
effect on information seeking. This suggests that the negative relationship between compulsory voting and the
"quality" of votes is partly due to the fact that those who are compelled to turn out expend less effort when
deciding how to cast their ballots.

moderates the relationship between voter compulsion and
information seeking.
Background
Political sophistication and its correlates are less likely to
induce electoral abstention where turnout is mandatory
(e.g., Dassonneville et al., 2017; Gallego, 2015; Hoffman
et al., 2017; Hooghe and Pelleriaux, 1998; Irwin, 1974;
Singh, 2015). Ironing out sophistication-based cleavages
in turnout can accentuate these same disparities in the vot-
ing population. This is consequential because those with-
out substantial knowledge about politics are least able to
use political information in a way that allows them to cast
meaningful ballots (Zaller, 1992), and unsophisticated vot-
ers are less likely to select the party that best matches their
preferences (Lau et al., 2008). Such patterns suggest that
low-quality vote choices will be relatively common where
turnout is mandatory, a pattern found in many extant stud-
ies (e.g., Dassonneville et al., Hooghe and Miller, 2017;
Hooghe and Stiers, 2017; Selb and Lachat, 2009; Singh,
2016a).
Theory and hypotheses
We seek to understand how compulsory voting weakens the
match between voters' choices and their preferences. For
us, much of this link is due to differences in the decision-
making processes of voluntary and compelled voters. Any
such differences should matter for the quality of vote
choices, as individuals who expend little effort arriving at
their decisions are less likely to cast votes that are well-
matched with their preferences (Lau and Redlawsk, 1997;
Singh and Roy, 2014).
When individuals are forced into a behavior, their motiva-
tion for engagement lessens (Deci, 1975), and coercion and
punishment are linked to defiance, lower levels of cognitive
engagement, and less interest in one's tasks (e.g., Sherman,
1993; Tyler, 2006). Forced voting, in particular, has been
found to magnify and entrench resentment of the democratic
system (Henn and Oldfield, 2016; Singh, 2016b). The fact
that compulsory voting increases invalid voting (e.g., Katz
and Levin, forthcoming; Power and Garand, 2007; Singh,
2017) reinforces the notion that those who are compelled to
participate in elections are less motivated to formulate a
meaningful vote. This leads to our first hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1: Relative to voluntary voters, those who
feel compelled to vote are less likely to seek out political
information.
Individuals who vote because of external coercion are
more likely to be politically unsophisticated (Dassonneville
et al., 2017; Gallego, 2015; Hoffman et al., 2017; Hooghe
and Pelleriaux, 1998; Irwin, 1974; Singh, 2015), and
politically unsophisticated individuals are less likely to
engage with politically relevant information (Lau and
Redlawsk, 2006). This suggests that at least part of compul-
sory voting's effect on information seeking is driven by
political sophistication.
However, compulsory voting's production of defiance
toward, and resentment of, the democratic system likely less-
ens political information seeking in the voting population
independent of sophistication. That is, those who are nega-
tively oriented toward the democratic system, even if politi-
cally sophisticated, are unlikely to engage with campaign
information. Moreover, compulsory voting brings to the vot-
ing booth individuals who prefer fringe, outsider, or anti-
system parties or candidates (Bélanger, 2004; Carreras,
2012; Jensen and Spoon, 2011). While supporters of such
non-mainstream options are not necessarily less politically
sophisticated, they will have little desire to learn about the
competitors to their preferred parties or candidates. Thus,
while one's level of political sophistication likely drives
some of the hypothesized negative link between voter com-
pulsion and information seeking, voter compulsion should
also have an effect independent of sophistication. This leads
to our second hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2: The effects of feeling compelled to vote
on information seeking are partially driven by political
sophistication.
The election simulation
To test our hypotheses, we simulated an Australian fed-
eral election in April of 2016.2 Participants were pre-
sented with links to information on the actual issue
positions of Australia's four main political parties (as
conveyed on official websites). They were able to access
party platforms and positions with respect to five policy
domains by clicking on the links. Unbeknownst to the
participants, we recorded the amount of time they spent
gathering information and each link they accessed. This
allows us to create two separate measures of information
seeking: the amount of time spent seeking information;
and the number of information links accessed. Figure 1
provides a screen capture of the election simulation, and
Figure 2 illustrates the distributions of the two measures
of information seeking, which are used below as our
dependent variables.
To populate our studies, we hired Survey Sampling
International, a private international firm that specializes in
online sampling. Random sampling was performed within
strata for age, education, gender, and household income to
help ensure the sample was reflective of the population in
accordance with these characteristics. 2220 Australian par-
ticipants completed the simulation. We obtained approval
from the Research Ethics Board of Wilfrid Laurier
University in Ontario, Canada, before beginning our study,
Singh and Roy 3
and all participants gave informed consent before proceed-
ing to our simulation.
Measuring feelings of compulsion and
political sophistication
Our primary independent variable is feelings of compulsion
to vote. All eligible voters are legally required to vote in
Australia,3 which means that we cannot compare voters
subject to compulsory and voluntary rules. However, we
are able to gain leverage on the extent to which one feels
compelled to vote with a well-established counterfactual
approach. To determine the extent to which an individual
turns out to vote against his or her own volition, we asked
two questions as part of a survey that preceded the election
simulation. The first asked: "In federal elections, are you
certain to vote, likely, unlikely, or certain not to vote?" The
second asked: "If voting were no longer mandatory in
Australia, would you be certain to vote, likely, unlikely, or
certain not to vote in the next federal election?"
As a first step, we retain only the participants who
reported being likely or certain to vote under Australia's
compulsory voting law. We then classify those who would
also certainly vote under voluntary voting as "Voluntary
Voters,"thosewhowouldlikelyvoteas"SlightlyCompelled
Voters," those who would be unlikely to vote as "Moderately

Compelled Voters," and those who would certainly not vote
under voluntary voting as "Strongly Compelled Voters."4
A host of extant studies of compulsory voting use this
type of counterfactual approach (e.g., Bélanger, 2004;
Hellwig and McAllister, 2016; Hooghe and Pelleriaux,
1998; Hooghe and Stiers, 2017; Hooghe et al., 2011;
Mackerras and McAllister, 1999; Selb and Lachat, 2009),
and Selb and Lachat (2009, 577­578) provide a clear dis-
cussion of its strengths. They also note, however, that the
counterfactual approach may suffer from the effects of
social desirability bias. Those who are willing to take part
in an election study may also be hesitant to express a pref-
erence for abstention (Jackman, 1999). This would suggest
that our counterfactual measurement strategy understates
any differences between "voluntary" and "compelled" vot-
ers. Such social desirability effects would make it harder
for us to find support for our hypotheses.
We measured political sophistication in the pre-simula-
tion survey. Scholars often consider individuals to be politi-
cally sophisticated if they both have political knowledge
and are willing to put that knowledge to use (see Fiske
et al., 1983; Neuman, 1986). In line with this, we take
sophistication to consist not only of existing political
knowledge, but also of political interest. We gauged politi-
cal interest using scores on a self-reported 0­10 scale,5 and
we measured political knowledge as the number of correct
answers in a series of four trivia-type questions.6 To create
our sophistication measure, we standardized both measures
to zero mean and unit variance and summed them.
Results
Our first hypothesis puts forth that voters who feel com-
pelled to the polls are less likely to seek out political infor-
mation than voluntary voters. To test this, we regress our
two dependent variables, the number of minutes spent gath-
ering information and the number of information links
accessed, on voter compulsion. In the model with the num-
ber of minutes spent as the dependent variable, we use lin-
ear regression,7 and we use negative binomial regression in
the model in which the number of information links
accessed is the dependent variable.8 We use dummy varia-
bles for each category of voter compulsion as covariates,
and we exclude "Voluntary Voters" as the reference cate-
gory. Data on each of our variables were available for 1917
participants.
The top panels of Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the results
of the regressions, which provide support for our first
hypothesis. In each graph, it is clear that feeling com-
pelled decreases political information seeking. For exam-
ple, the results shown in the top panel of Figure 3 show
that "Slightly Compelled Voters" are expected to spend
about 18 fewer seconds gathering information than those
who turn out voluntarily, "Moderately Compelled Voters"

Note: estimates are from two separate linear regressions, and the horizontal lines represent 90% confidence intervals. The horizontal axis depicts
the difference in expected number of minutes a participant spent gathering information during the election simulation, relative to those who vote
voluntarily. The independent variable, which appears on the vertical axis, is a categorical measure of the extent to which a participant feels com-
pelled by Australia's compulsory voting law to participate in elections. The regression depicted in the bottom panel includes a control for political
sophistication, which is measured as an index of political interest and knowledge. Numerical results of the regression models depicted in Figure 3

spend an average of about 26 fewer seconds gathering
information, and "Strongly Compelled Voters" spend
about 45 fewer seconds gathering information, on aver-
age. The results shown in the top panel of Figure 4 depict
a very similar pattern with regard to the expected number
of information links accessed. "Slightly Compelled
Voters" are expected to click on about 0.57 fewer links
than those who turn out voluntarily, "Moderately
Compelled Voters" click an average of about 1.05 fewer
links, and "Strongly Compelled Voters" click about 1.70
fewer links, on average. Both plots demonstrate that the
effect of compulsion on information acquisition is pro-
gressively larger among those who feel more compelled
by the mandatory voting law, a pattern that is unlikely to
come about purely due to chance.9
Our second hypothesis puts forth that, while voter
compulsion has an independent effect on information
seeking, political sophistication drives only part of this
link. There is a straightforward empirical implication of
this expectation: adding a control for political sophistica-
tion to models predicting information seeking as a func-
tion of voter compulsion should decrease the magnitude
of the coefficients on the covariates that capture feelings
of compulsion. To test this, we re-estimate the models
depicted in the top panels of Figures 3 and 4, with our
measure of political sophistication added to the right-hand
side of the regression equations.
Results are depicted in the bottom panels of Figures 3
and 4. Starting with Figure 3, it is apparent that the effect
of each category of compulsion on the expected number of
minutes a participant spent gathering information is
smaller once political sophistication is taken into account.
However, each effect is still statistically different from
zero, which indicates that voter compulsion also has an
effect independent of sophistication. The pattern in Figure
4, in which the dependent variable is the number of infor-
mation links accessed, is similar. The effect of each cate-
gory of compulsion on the expected number of links
accessed by a participant attenuates once political sophis-
tication is accounted for. In fact, the effects of being
"Slightly Compelled" and "Moderately Compelled," rela-
tive to voting voluntarily, are not distinguishable from zero
with sophistication taken into account. However, "Strongly
Compelled Voters" are still expected to access fewer links
than those who turned out by their own volition, even once
we account for political sophistication. These patterns pro-
vide support for Hypothesis 2.
We posit above that the link from feeling compelled to
information seeking is only partially driven by political
sophistication because, while compulsory voting increases
participation among the less politically sophisticated, it
also induces defiance and resentment of the democratic
system, and it brings to the voting booth individuals who
prefer fringe, outsider, or anti-system parties or candidates.

are provided in Appendix E in the supplementary material.
6 Research and Politics 
We find empirical support for these proposed mechanisms
in tests detailed in Appendix A in the supplementary
material.
We also account for the possibility that the estimated
effects of the categories of compulsion depicted in the bot-
tom panels of Figures 3 and 4 may not be completely
washed of political sophistication; while we argue that
there are factors associated with being compelled that
decrease information acquisition independent of sophisti-
cation, these may in fact themselves be due to a lack of
political sophistication. To estimate the unique effects of
feelings of compulsion with this possibility taken into
account, we use inverse probability weighting to simulate a
scenario in which individuals are randomly "treated" with
compelled voting. Results, shown in Appendix B, are simi-
lar to those depicted in the bottom panels of Figures 3 and
4, which bolsters our argument that a portion of compul-
sion's effect on information seeking is unrelated to political
sophistication.
Finally, we explore the role of heuristics in the rela-
tionship between feelings of compulsion and informa-
tion seeking. Within our simulation, we conducted an
experiment in which we randomly treated participants
with the availability of polling information. We found no
evidence that access to polling results conditions the size
of the differences in information acquisition between
voters who feel compelled and those who do not. The
effects of voter compulsion on both types of information
seeking were not consistently larger in magnitude for
treated individuals, and they were never statistically dif-
ferent from the effects calculated among those in the
control group. We elaborate on our experimental design
and consider potential reasons for these non-findings in
Appendix C.
Conclusion
Our findings bring to light a mechanism driving the com-
monly uncovered link between compulsory voting and
votes that are poorly representative of preferences (e.g.,
Dassonneville et al., 2017; Hooghe and Stiers, 2017; Selb
and Lachat, 2009; Singh, 2016a): individuals who only turn
out because of external coercion spend less time and effort
formulating their choices. This link exists in part because
voters who feel compelled are less sophisticated politically,
but feelings of compulsion also independently diminish the
information search.
To be sure, as we study the effects of compulsory vot-
ing within a single country that uses compulsory voting,
we have not shown that information levels are generally
lower in countries where turning out is mandatory. A
number of studies report evidence of a positive link
between compulsory voting and political knowledge in
the population (e.g., Sheppard, 2015; Shineman, forth-
coming), others suggest that this relationship is stronger
in, or exclusive to, certain subgroups (e.g., Carreras,
2016; Córdova and Rangel, 2017), and still more find lit-
tle or no evidence of any such link (e.g., de Leon and
Rizzi, 2014, 2016; León, 2017; Loewen et al., 2008).
While our findings show that those who feel cajoled into
voting in a compulsory system are less likely to seek out
information than those who participate voluntarily, they
do not necessarily indicate that voters in compulsory sys-
tems are less politically informed than their counterparts
in voluntary systems. The scholarly debate over this
potential link persists.

Notes
1. Throughout this article, we use the word "quality" with ref-
erence to vote choices. We do not intend this to have a nor-
mative connotation. Instead, we intend "quality" to indicate
the extent to which one's vote choice aligns with his or her
preferences.
2. The simulation was not conducted in conjunction with the
2016 Australian Federal Election, which took place in July.
The electoral debates and campaigning did not begin in ear-
nest until May.
3. Voting has been compulsory at the national level in Australia
since its 1925 Federal Election. Electoral enrollment is also
mandatory. Abstention without a valid justification entails a
A$20 fine (about US$15). While the validity of an excuse
for non-participation rests on the merits of each individual
case, the High Court has listed religious duties, illness, acci-
dents, and natural disasters as examples of acceptable expla-
nations. An eligible voter who fails to provide a valid reason
for abstention or to pay the associated fine may be subject
Singh and Roy 7
to a court-imposed penalty of up to A$180, plus court costs.
An individual who defaults on this penalty may receive a
sentence of community service or even a short jail term.
4. 54% of the participants are classified as "Voluntary Voters,"
30% are classified as"Slightly Compelled," 11% are clas-
sified as"Moderately Compelled," and 5% are classified as
"Strongly Compelled."
5. The survey question is: "Using the scale above, where 0
means no interest at all and 10 means a great deal of interest,
how interested are you in politics generally?"
6. We used the following question set:
"Now we have a set of questions concerning politics and vari-
ous public figures. We want to see how much information gets
out to the public from television, newspapers and the like.
· 
Can you recall the name of the Secretary General of
the United Nations?
· 
Can you recall the name of the current finance minister
in the Federal Government?
· 
Can you recall the name of the current Governor
General of Australia?
· 
And finally, can you recall the current number of seats
in the House of Representatives?"
For each question, four response options were offered, one
of which was correct. Participants were also able to select
"don't know."
7. As shown in Figure 2, the measure of the number of minutes
a participant spent gathering information is heavily right-
skewed. As such, in analyses shown in Appendix D in the
supplementary material, we re-estimate the models that use
this measure as the outcome variable using Poisson regres-
sion. Results are very similar to those obtained in the linear
regression models reported in the text.
8. If they desired, those in our experimental treatment group
could click on a poll results figure to enlarge it (see Appendix
C in the supplementary material). Thus, these participants
were exposed to one extra information link. We take this vari-
ation in exposure into account within our negative binomial
models.
9. Under the null hypothesis that, relative to voluntary vot-
ers, the magnitudes of the effects for "Slightly Compelled
Voters," "Moderately Compelled Voters," and "Strongly
Compelled Voters" are randomly distributed, the prob-
ability of finding the effect size ordering that we did is
