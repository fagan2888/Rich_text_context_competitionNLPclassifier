Networks of digital humanities scholars:
The informational and social uses and
gratifications of Twitter
Anabel Quan-Haase1, Kim Martin2 and Lori McCay-Peet1
Abstract
Big Data research is currently split on whether and to what extent Twitter can be characterized as an informational or
social network. We contribute to this line of inquiry through an investigation of digital humanities (DH) scholars' uses
and gratifications of Twitter. We conducted a thematic analysis of 25 semi-structured interview transcripts to learn about
these scholars' professional use of Twitter. Our findings show that Twitter is considered a critical tool for informal
communication within DH invisible colleges, functioning at varying levels as both an information network (learning to
`Twitter' and maintaining awareness) and a social network (imagining audiences and engaging other digital humanists). We
find that Twitter follow relationships reflect common academic interests and are closely tied to scholars' pre-existing
social ties and conference or event co-attendance. The concept of the invisible college continues to be relevant but
requires revisiting. The invisible college formed on Twitter is messy, consisting of overlapping social contexts (profes-
sional, personal and public), scholars with different habits of engagement, and both formal and informal ties.
Our research illustrates the value of using multiple methods to explore the complex questions arising from Big Data
studies and points toward future research that could implement Big Data techniques on a small scale, focusing on sub-
topics or emerging fields, to expose the nature of scholars' invisible colleges made visible on Twitter.

Introduction
Communication is an integral part of scholarly practice.
Indeed much work in the sociology of science has
stressed that disciplines only flourish if an invisible col-
lege is established to facilitate communication and
exchange among its members. De Solla Price coined
the term ``invisible colleges'' in 1961, which describes
``a communication network of a subgroup of researchers
within a research area'' (Crane, 1972: 35). While citation
networks are one way to identify and study an invisible
college, much research advocates for a stronger focus on
informal ties that sustain disciplinary discourse, conver-
sation and collaboration (Carroll and Dasler, 2015;
Lievrouw, 1990; Zuccala, 2006). With the widespread
popularity of social media in academia, it is relevant
to examine the role of informal ties to test out new
ideas, circulate pre-publications for constructive feed-
back, and discuss emerging topics (Gruzd et al., 2012;
Holmberg and Thelwall, 2014; Rasmussen Neal, 2012;
Veletsianos, 2012). An important by-product of the
flurry of social media activity is the cloud of Big Data
it produces and the user interactions revealed.
Researchers have begun to take advantage of Big Data
approaches to uncover patterns and topological features
of networks. We argue that it is also important to exam-
ine the social context in which these patterns emerge

because it can inform and expand findings from Big
Data analytics.
Through methods such as interviews and surveys,
prior research has examined the scholarly use of social
media (Gruzd et al., 2012; Nicholas and Rowlands,
2011), but few studies have explicitly explored the use
of Twitter, a popular microblogging platform, by scho-
lars (Holmberg and Thelwall, 2014). Given the popular-
ity of Twitter among scholars in various disciplines
(Holmberg and Thelwall, 2014; Nicholas and
Rowlands, 2011) and the importance of scholarly com-
munication to individual scholars and to communities of
researchers (Gruzd et al., 2011; Holmberg and Thelwall,
2014), it is critical to understand how and why Twitter is
being used and its implications in relation to scholar-
ship. Because of the dynamic nature of social media
(see Hogan and Quan-Haase, 2010), research also
needs to consider that social media are not only used
differently across platforms (Archambault and Grudin,
2012; Puschmann and Bastos, 2015), but also across dis-
ciplines (Holmberg and Thelwall, 2014). Much of the
literature has tended to look at higher education
(Carroll and Dasler, 2015; Veletsianos, 2012) or at scho-
lars as general groupings (Nicholas and Rowlands,
2011), without adequately investigating the social ties
that connect scholars and make their interactions
socially relevant. For example, digital humanities
(DH) and cognitive science scholars tend to use
Twitter more for conversation than those in disciplines
such as biochemistry and economics (Holmberg and
Thelwall, 2014). Current discussions on social media
use in academia would thus benefit from studies that
investigate the adoption and usage of specific platforms
by subgroups of researchers.
The use of Twitter is still relatively new, and thus
researchers are only beginning to grasp Twitter's
``antecedents and consequences'' (Aladwani, 2015:
15). One central debate in the literature, informed in
part by Big Data research (Kwak et al., 2010; Myers
et al., 2014), has emerged around how Twitter
exchanges provide informational or social benefits to
users. Kwak et al. (2010) suggest that Twitter is best
described as an information network rather than a
social network. More recent work examining the topo-
logical features of networks found evidence that sug-
gests Twitter acts as both an information and social
network (Myers et al., 2014). To discern the informa-
tional and social gratifications obtained from Twitter
networks, it is vital to study Twitter activity by users
who have shared interests and are bound by informal
ties. The aim of this paper is to inform and expand
findings based on Big Data analyses about Twitter's
informational and social gratifications.
Our research contributes to the growing body of lit-
erature on scholars' use of social media by examining a
single group of scholars, those in the DH community
who use ``computational tools to do the work of the
humanities'' (Unsworth, as quoted in Gold, 2012: 67).
Our findings inform researchers, educators and policy
makers who strive to understand the use and value of
social media in the context of scholarship (e.g. Gruzd
et al., 2012; Holmberg and Thelwall, 2014). The current
study examines two research questions:
a. How are DH scholars using Twitter in the context
of their scholarly practice?
b. What informational and social gratifications do DH
scholars obtain from their usage of Twitter?
Our two research questions emerge from prior
research in the area of Big Data analytics. We specific-
ally examine whether, in the context of DH, Twitter's
uses and gratifications are more informational or social
in nature. Big Data analytics are particularly well-
suited for identifying the topological features of a net-
work, but are myopic to the social context in which
interactions take place. The contribution of this paper
is to demonstrate how a small scale study of Twitter
uses and gratifications can inform and expand a debate
unfolding in Big Data analytics. Thereby, this paper
sheds light on the debate by taking a look at a small
slice of the activity on Twitter from the perspective of
DH scholars.
Background
Big Data and Twitter use
Though criticized for its biases and assumptions,
Big Data informs our understanding of social phenom-
ena and, at the same time, creates ``a radical shift in how
we think about research'' (Boyd and Crawford, 2012:
665). Even though the definition of Big Data is conten-
tious and evolving, the term is generally used to describe
large and complex data sets, including content generated
on social media sites (Big Data & Society, 2014).
Big Data studies have compared a range of topological
features of Twitter networks; a study by Kwak et al.
(2010) being ``the first to look at the entire
Twittersphere'' (p. 599) for the purpose of investigating
user participation in trending topics, reciprocity and
homophily. Kwak et al.'s study demonstrates how the
use of Big Data techniques can provide new insights
into large-scale social processes. A key finding was that
the majority of ties on Twitter were one-way rather than
reciprocal. Based on their study, the authors proposed
that Twitter's primary use is as a source of information
and platform for information exchange rather than
social networking. In another study, Myers et al. (2014)
found that while some of their results pointed to Twitter
2 Big Data & Society
as a social network, others were more consistent with
Twitter as an information network, thus partially corro-
borating Kwak et al.'s (2010) findings, but ultimately
concluding Twitter represents more of a hybrid network.
Myers et al. (2014) further hypothesized that Twitter
starts off as an information network but over time
evolves into a social network as a user becomes more
selective of whom to follow: ``The user typically discovers
a community with which to engage ­ whether it be based
on real-world social ties, common interests, or other fac-
tors ­ and Twitter starts behaving more like a social net-
work'' (p. 498).
Big Data studies (e.g. Kwak et al., 2010; Myers et al.,
2014) provide useful generalizations about patterns in
human behaviour on Twitter. However, subsets of
Twitter users may not exhibit the same patterns and
these nuances may be lost in analyses of large data
sets. Holmberg and Thelwall (2014) selected researchers
from 10 different disciplines, including DH, biochemis-
try and economics, based on their productivity and
presence on Twitter. Based on an analysis of 200 ran-
domly selected tweets from these researchers, they
found significant differences among disciplines in
terms of how links were shared, the number of conver-
sational tweets, retweets and tweets for the purpose of
scholarly communication. Understanding the role of
social context in how different social groups make use
of Twitter and the unique gratifications each group
gains from their engagement will help researchers inter-
pret the `big picture' findings drawn from Big Data
analytics.
The DH community
DH is an interdisciplinary, evolving field of study with
roots in the humanities computing centres of the 1970s
and 1980s (Hockey, 2004). Developments in computing
have allowed for a much larger integration of technol-
ogy into the humanities, making possible the collection,
analysis and interpretation of Big Data that can span
several centuries, time periods and data sources. The
central tenet of DH is the utilization of computing
resources as a means to aid scholarship, teaching and
theorizing around humanities subjects (e.g. language,
literature, history, art and philosophy) and there is a
growing, international network of scholars who iden-
tify themselves as members of the DH community
(Kirschenbaum, 2010).
DH and social media
Definitions of social media abound and tend to
include a wide range of tools such as microblogging,
social networking sites and video sharing websites
(Hogan and Quan-Haase, 2010). What characterizes
social media engagement is that it is global in nature,
links loosely connected networks, facilitates the
sharing of ideas and content in an interactive
manner and allows for high levels of engagement
with people and content (McCay-Peet and Quan-
Haase, forthcoming).
Not all scholars have adopted social media, but for
many it has become an integral component of their
scholarly practice (Quan-Haase, 2012). Social media
reduce the barriers of time and location to scholarly
communication; scholars can tweet messages to their
followers and have answers to questions in real time;
they can communicate with a co-worker who is away at
a conference; or they can follow activities of a confer-
ence they were unable to attend in person from afar
(Holmberg and Thelwall, 2014; Ross et al., 2011). DH
scholars have been described as early adopters and avid
users of social media (Kirschenbaum, 2010; Ross et al.,
2011) and many DH scholars embed Twitter in their
practice to amplify scholarly communication (Howard,
2009). Schnapp and Presner (2009) described DH as
``iterative scholarship, mobilized collaborations, and
networks of research'' (n.p.), which is illustrated
through DH scholars' use of social media to communi-
cate with their colleagues and share research results
with a broad audience (Terras, 2012). Twitter, for
example, plays a large role during DH events, work-
shops, THATCamps and conferences as a platform for
back channelling (Ross et al., 2011). Through a content
analysis of tweets by scholars from 10 disciplines,
Holmberg and Thelwall (2014) found that DH scholars
tend to engage in more conversations (@username),
share fewer links in their tweets and use Twitter for
scholarly communication more than scholars in some
other disciplines. Based on a sample of 200 DH scholar
tweets, the study also found that the 10 most fre-
quently-used words in tweets by DH scholars included:
``need,'' ``thanks'' and ``thinking,'' as well as ``digital''
and ``humanities,'' which suggests that DH scholars are
sharing ideas and information related to DH in an
interactive manner.
In summary, scattered throughout the literature are
indications that Twitter is an important tool for DH
scholars. What is needed is a more holistic understand-
ing of DH scholars' motivations behind Twitter use
(e.g. informational versus social), how they are using
Twitter as a platform for scholarly communication,
how they are navigating the use of Twitter in the con-
text of their professional work, and to what effect.
Methodology
This study employed semi-structured interviews to col-
lect data from 25 DH scholars about their use of digital
tools and social media for supporting their scholarly
Quan-Haase et al. 3
work. Transcripts were analysed using the thematic
analysis technique and the uses and gratifications
framework informed the coding process.
Participants
Because debate surrounds what DH entails as well as
the creation of arbitrary boundaries within the huma-
nities, participant sampling was grounded in practical
criteria that would allow us to recruit widely and be
inclusive. We were also concerned about recruiting
individuals with various DH experiences (e.g. faculty,
graduate students, and librarians). For this purpose, we
recruited at the international DH annual conference
(DH 2013), which took place in Lincoln, Nebraska,
16­19 July 2013 (n ¼ 15), and through site visits to
two DH centres in the United Kingdom and Ireland
in February 2013 (n ¼ 5) and June 2013 (n ¼ 5), respect-
ively. Participants were recruited through four strate-
gies: a) in person, b) Twitter, c) email prior to site visits
and d) a booth set up at the DH 2013 conference.
Participants (N ¼ 25) comprised an international set
of scholars engaging in DH-related scholarship and
included 14 females and 11 males. Eleven professors,
six PhD students, three managers, two librarians, two
public historians and a retired professor participated.
The majority had attained a graduate degree: 11 had a
PhD and 11 had a MA degree, and three participants
had attained an undergraduate degree. Participants'
fields of study varied and reflected the diversity existent
within DH scholarship: classics, literature, English, his-
tory, art history, information science, computer science,
engineering, political communication and business.
Participants were from the US, Canada, Germany,
England, Ireland and Australia.
Procedure
Each in-person, 45­60 min session followed the same
procedure, beginning with an introduction to the
study and consent. The interviews were audio-recorded
for later transcription. Interviews were semi-structured
to allow the interviewer the flexibility to clarify partici-
pant responses, probe for more detail and follow-up on
unexpected topics (Berg, 2007). The interview was part
of a broader study on the information behaviours of
digital humanists. The present analysis is limited to the
sections on Twitter and general social media use (see
Appendix A).
The uses and gratifications framework
The uses and gratifications approach was selected as a
framework for analysis. Uses and gratifications is
``a psychological perspective that examines how
individuals use mass media, on the assumption that
individuals select media and content to fulfill felt
needs or wants'' (Papacharissi and Mendelson, 2011)
and is an ideal method for the study of social media
in the context of everyday life (Quan-Haase and
Young, 2010). The uses and gratifications approach
has been used to identify predictors of time spent on
social media such as 1) relaxing entertainment, 2)
expressive information sharing and 3) social interaction
(Smock et al., 2011). In a similar vein, the uses and
gratifications approach was used to examine the per-
ceived characteristics of Twitter as a motivating factor
for its continued use (Coursaris et al., 2013). The
approach is also useful for making cross-platform com-
parisons. A comparison of the uses and gratifications of
Facebook and instant messaging revealed several rea-
sons why young people integrate multiple digital tech-
nologies into their daily lives (Quan-Haase and Young,
2010). While a significant portion of prior research on
social media has been grounded in the uses and gratifi-
cations approach, we know of no prior study that has
applied the uses and gratifications approach in the con-
text of scholars' use of Twitter.
Data analysis
We performed thematic analysis of the transcripts
(Braun and Clarke, 2006), involving inductive and
deductive coding. Thematic analysis allowed the
researchers to use the uses and gratifications frame-
work to help guide the analysis and draw on prior
research to identify pre-existing themes while at the
same time providing the flexibility to develop new
themes. Thematic analysis is an iterative process that
involves familiarization with the data (via transcrip-
tion, reading of transcripts), generation of initial
codes, a search for themes, review of themes and the
naming and definition of themes. Data analysis was
guided by the two research questions and thus carefully
examined participant references to the uses and gratifi-
cations of Twitter. To help ensure rigour in the data
analysis process, multiple coding was used (Barbour,
2001). Multiple coding involved the analysis of the
transcripts by the second and third authors. The
authors completed the analysis separately while dis-
cussing codes together after every five or so transcripts
to help check for agreement and, more importantly, to
discuss insights and alternative interpretations. Of the
25 transcripts, 15 were coded using this method. A fur-
ther 10 transcripts were analysed using the codes and
no further major themes were identified, thus reaching
saturation. Descriptive statistics drawn from the
Twitter use set of questions (e.g. whether or not
Twitter is used to connect with people within the DH
community) were relied upon to complement and
4 Big Data & Society
corroborate the themes identified in this research.
Following recommendations outlined in Braun and
Clarke (2006), writing-up the results section provided
a final opportunity for analysis, as representative
quotes from participants were extracted from the tran-
scripts to highlight key findings.
Findings
Social media and Twitter use
Participants reported varying levels of use of social
media. All 25 participants maintained at least one
social media account (e.g. Twitter, Facebook,
Academia.edu), but many maintained several. All but
one participant had a Twitter account and one partici-
pant had a Twitter account but was not currently using
it. When asked about their Twitter networks, 19 par-
ticipants recalled their number of followers, which
ranged from five to 2000 (m ¼ 550; SD ¼ 667) and 16
recalled the number of people they followed, which
ranged from eight to 2000 (m ¼ 510, SD ¼ 670), and
12 of these 16 participants reported following more
than 150. One hundred and fifty is generally considered
the maximum number of stable social relationships that
can be maintained at one time (Dunbar, 1992, as cited
in Myers et al., 2014). This suggests that DH Twitter
ties are not entirely social in nature for the majority of
DH scholars. While we did not collect data on the reci-
procity of the ties, 10 reported following more people
or organizations than they were followed by, five fol-
lowed fewer people or organizations than they were
followed by, and one had an equal number of followers
and follows.
Several participants reported their time investment
in Twitter in relative time spent (e.g. ``not a lot,''
``probably too much''), others spoke of the quality
of their investment (e.g. ``interstitial,'' ``constant,''
``a lot, but uneven'') and yet others reported on the
context of usage (e.g. ``only when not busy with
work'' or ``not until recently at the conference'').
Seven participants reported tweeting on a daily
basis, five reported tweeting at least once per week,
while three reported that it varies and one reported
rarely tweeting. In other words, there was no single
pattern of Twitter usage among participants; they
adapted the technology to their own social and pro-
fessional needs.
Twitter's informational uses and gratifications
In order to share information with or solicit informa-
tion or feedback from those in their Twitter networks,
DH scholars develop skills to do so effectively
(Learning to Twitter). Likewise, to reap the benefits
of a rich information network, DH scholars use
Twitter to keep up with news and information in the
DH community (Maintaining awareness).
Learning to Twitter. In a recent article on `Twitteracy',
Greenhow and Gleason (2012) described the multimod-
ality of microblogging: images, links, emoticons and
standardized language comprise the 140-character
tweets users compose. The authors also noted that
there are a number of conventions (e.g. hashtags and
retweets) that users need to know to effectively partici-
pate on Twitter. Our findings similarly suggest that
learning how to engage in a multimodal digital envir-
onment is central to participants. P19 noted the import-
ance of selecting the ``right'' hashtag for a tweet to
maximize its reach. We found that simply learning to
write in the allocated 140-character limit was critical for
meaningful engagement.
The 140-character limit was seen as beneficial to
some, forcing them to think through their ideas more
clearly and to express themselves succinctly, but the
character limit was too restrictive for others. In most
cases, our participants weighed both sides of this ``new
literary practice'' (Greenhow and Gleason, 2012): they
recognized the challenges, but were still willing to
engage. Participants reported that the effort of
``crafting tweets'' (P6) was worth it because they were
learning a new digital literacy. Several participants
referred to writing posts as a skill that could be
taught and improved through experience.
Gruzd et al. (2011) refer to `twitterspeak' as the lin-
guistic conventions utilized to tweet. Participants in the
present study perceived twitterspeak as a new means of
communicating that encouraged them to think through
their tweets.
I think there is a literacy here because it forces you to
think about being economical with your mode of
expression. What is the word that matters most?
What happens if I move this? Is that going to, you
know, impact it in important ways? You can get the
sense across, but do you get the nuance? [. . .] What are
you losing? (P6)
The word limit was also perceived as an opportunity to
`boil down' ideas to their essence. Eleven participants
indicated that they use Twitter to help them clarify
ideas, while two indicated that they use it for this pur-
pose `sometimes' or `somewhat'. The need to concisely
express complex ideas seemed a welcome challenge to
some participants, one that allowed them to clarify
their thinking and reflect upon their ideas. This suggests
that DH users of Twitter optimize the informational
value of the platform and realize its potential for the
exchange of information.
Quan-Haase et al. 5
Some participants stressed the shortcomings of the
medium by stating how it is difficult to write within the
140-character format, how it stifles conversation and
how it leads to heavy reliance on links for additional
information. In that regard, they saw their tweets inter-
connected with larger discourses occurring on blogs,
articles and other web content. Twelve participants
described the constraints imposed by the 140-character
limit in expressing complex ideas and conveying large
amounts of information.
I mean obviously a conversation is better face-to-face.
Sometimes it's hard for me to say what I want to say in
140-character snippets. Especially if there are a lot to
say [sic]. (P3)
Although several participants noted that there was an
interactive, conversational element to being on Twitter,
several agreed with P3 that conversations were best left
for other media. This highlights the tensions in relying
on Twitter for the purpose of sustaining an imagined
community: Twitter facilitates the easy and convenient
sharing of information, but it is also important for the
messages to make sense. Hence, to be a part of this
imagined community, members must first share a
common language (Anderson, 1983) and set of
conventions.
In sum, while the majority of our participants have
adopted Twitter, they continue to figure out how it best
fits into their scholarly practice. They are willing to
further push themselves to understand the intricacies
of the medium and to learn how to engage with
others in creative and meaningful ways that will allow
them to take advantage of Twitter as an information
network.
Maintaining awareness. Prior research (Coursaris et al.,
2013; Dantonio et al., 2012; Kwak et al., 2010) under-
lines the importance of Twitter for helping people main-
tain awareness of news and information, a dominant
theme identified in our data set as well. Many partici-
pants noted the importance of maintaining awareness
of DH-related research, conferences and projects via
Twitter. One participant asserted Twitter was unri-
valled in this respect, and this confirms prior research
that stresses the centrality of Twitter as an information
conduit (Kwak et al., 2010).
I would say that Twitter is probably the single most
important place for me to keep up with new websites,
new projects. (P1)
But more than the passive type of information behav-
iour often described in the literature (Wilson, 1999) and
that the concept of `maintaining awareness' perhaps
suggests, one participant (P5) observed how useful
Twitter was for quickly getting up to speed on a par-
ticular topic by employing a range of purposeful infor-
mation tactics.
When I first started on the [DH Project], I needed
to know more, I needed to `skill up' very quickly.
So I actively followed people that I thought might be
helpful for extending my knowledge in that area.
Twitter was more than just background noise. It pre-
sented itself as an information space that could be
mined for purposeful information seeking. The DH
information that could be obtained from Twitter
clearly motivated participants' continued use of the
site, and as new information needs emerged partici-
pants utilized Twitter strategically to fill their know-
ledge gaps.
Three further interrelated sub-themes of maintaining
awareness were identified: time, noise and serendipity.
These three sub-themes point to motivations for con-
tinued Twitter use as well as potential reasons for
avoiding Twitter, at least at times (Makri et al., 2014).
Maintaining awareness requires an investment of
time, and for some participants it was difficult to find
the time during a regular workday to check their
accounts and thus reported using Twitter primarily
during conferences or events (see Engagement section).
Others reported how easy it was to maintain awareness
of DH information by periodically checking their
Twitter timelines. One participant noted how easy it
was to just ``slot it in'' (P25), and another mentioned
using ``it in those in-between moments when I am wait-
ing for things or walking down the hall on my way
between meetings'' (P23). The way some participants
described how Twitter helped them maintain awareness
had a ubiquitous quality to it.
Well for me, I have two screens. One of my screens is
purely devoted to Twitter. It is on all talk, all the time.
[. . .] I use it every single day [. . .] all day. People say
that's incredibly difficult and people don't really enjoy
having it there constantly, but I find it a brilliant help
[. . .] not only in procrastination, but in hooking into
things that I don't necessarily know about. (P21)
P21's observations about her own use of Twitter
together with her perception of how others would
react to having Twitter in the background at all times
illustrate two sides of the same coin. The negative side
is the distraction resulting from all the noise ­ the mas-
sive amounts of diverse but not always interesting or
useful information that has a tendency to overload
users' timelines. This dissuaded some of our partici-
pants from being continuously connected to Twitter.
6 Big Data & Society
One participant noted that what he did not like about
Twitter was the inconsistent quality of content on his
timeline, which was often filled with uninteresting,
irrelevant information.
Ridiculously long list, with ridiculously useless infor-
mation and that's the danger of combining the personal
account with the professional. [. . .] Research ones are
much more focused but I find that people just tweet all
the time and sometimes I don't need to read that. (P7)
Noise also relates to the theme of the `imagined audi-
ence' (Marwick and Boyd, 2010) explored in the section
to follow. People may imagine their audience and
speculate what posts people in their network would
find interesting, but it is difficult to optimize informa-
tion for a diverse network. There is an inevitable dis-
connect, at least periodically, between the imagined
audience and the actual audience.
Finally, the positive side of this diverse and dynamic
digital environment is the serendipitous, unexpected
experiences it affords. Ten participants reported that
they use Twitter for making random and important
connections. Two participants specifically referred to
the serendipitous quality of their experiences. P5
reported dealing with a problematic aspect of her
research and `stumbling upon' a tweet directly related
to the problem.
In summary, Twitter is an important, however
imperfect, information network to our participants.
Informal communication via Twitter ­ at times useful
and others useless ­ helps participants maintain aware-
ness of developments in the field of DH. Next we dis-
cuss how some of our participants not only use Twitter
as a source of information, but as a social network to
engage with fellow DH scholars.
Twitter's social uses and gratifications
Complementing the uses and gratifications of Twitter
for DH scholars as a critical yet informal, information
network was the use of Twitter as a social network.
Participants were keenly aware that others were reading
their tweets (Imagined Audiences) and acted accord-
ingly. Moreover, many participants also recognized
the value of using Twitter's affordances to engage on
a personal level with their social network (Engaging
other Digital Humanists).
Imagining audiences
Participants' adoption and continued use of Twitter
appear motivated by the flexibility Twitter affords for
creating multiple profiles to reflect different aspects of a
scholar's life. An important role played by Twitter was
to help participants compartmentalize their various
identities, social roles and social networks through the
creation of multiple accounts, which could cater to dif-
ferent audiences. The concept of the `imagined audi-
ence' was coined to describe the difficulties inherent in
predicting who will read a specific tweet and thus deter-
mining who comprises one's audience (Marwick and
Boyd, 2010). For Marwick and Boyd, ``[t]his audience
is often imagined and constructed by an individual in
order to present themselves appropriately, based on
technological affordances and immediate social con-
text'' (p. 115). One participant reported having different
goals, vocabulary and subject matter to present to each
of the audiences of his two Twitter accounts. He con-
sciously crafted tweets (see Learning to Twitter section)
and decided what to retweet based on who he imagined
would read these.
I have two Twitter accounts. So I have myself as myself
[@myself]. But then I also just decided when I became
associate dean, I decided to create a dean account
[@deanTwitter] account. [. . .] I wanted a more official
voice, so on my [@myself] [. . .], I blur the boundary
between my personal and professional identity. (P6)
Though it is difficult to deduce from the findings of this
study whether single or multiple Twitter accounts are
the norm among DH scholars, even those who main-
tained a single account were aware of who their poten-
tial audience could be. P24's maintenance of a single
account appeared to be for both a professional and
personal audience.
I kind of `flag-up' whenever I see cool things by/about
computing and be like `oh that's the stuff I retweet most
of all,' so [. . .] if anyone is following me that doesn't
know much about digital humanities, they might get a
flavour for it. (P24)
P24 appears to reconcile posting information that may
not be relevant to her entire imagined audience with the
belief that those in her personal network, who most
likely are unfamiliar with DH, may find it interesting
to learn more about it. This notion of posting informa-
tion deemed relevant by an imagined audience is sup-
ported by our findings: most of our participants
reported finding information useful to their research
(n ¼ 20) or information they were otherwise unaware
of (n ¼ 23). The informational benefits of Twitter are
closely linked to the crafting of an ``imagined audience''
that shares common interests and has overlapping
professional and social roles.
Imagined audiences are an important part of the
development of a DH scholar's voice on Twitter, but
the imagined audience changes over time as users get a
Quan-Haase et al. 7
sense of who is reading their tweets and how the audi-
ence responds to them. By taking notice of what con-
tent is retweeted or favourited or sparks conversation,
users gain a better sense of who their audience is and
can adapt the content of their tweets accordingly.
Gaining a sense of one's audience over time was evident
when P5 spoke of the different results obtained from
crowdsourcing using Facebook versus Twitter:
I might throw a question out to both Twitter and
Facebook and you will often get very different answers
in those two communities. And so in that sense it can
be quite complementary. But they are also therefore
quite separate because they are actually producing dif-
ferent things. (P5)
In this sense, imagined audiences can become more vis-
ible and tangible over time as a result of feedback
obtained through interaction and engagement.
Engaging other digital humanists
Following or participating in a Twitter conversation
related to a conference is termed backchannel and is
a common practice among academics (Knight and
Kaye, 2014; Reinhardt et al., 2009). It is most often
done by following a hashtag related to the event
(e.g. #THATCamp), and Ross et al. (2011) noted
that it is a central motivation for DH scholars to
use Twitter. Backchannel during conferences among
the DH community was a central sub-theme that
addressed the gratifications obtained from engaging
with others on Twitter. In the interviews that took
place during the DH 2013 conference, participants
noted the use of social media throughout the event,
even going as far as adopting separate social media
management tools, such as Tweetdeck or HootSuite,
to be able to follow multiple, simultaneous Twitter
conversations.
I use it mainly at conferences, so I will break out the
TweetDeck for the conferences, and then the rest of
my time I just check in on my phone maybe once a
day. (P8)
Backchannel also allows those individuals who are not
physically present at the event to follow the conversa-
tion and engage at a distance. Our research supports
these findings, as conferences were one of the main
times that our participants indicated relying on
Twitter for engagement, and P14, for example, had
decided to join Twitter precisely to participate in
these online discussions. Reinhardt et al. (2009) found
that Twitter was used at conferences mainly for sharing
resources and connecting with others, and also for
following parallel sessions. Our work supports this as
well, as P12 notes:
At the conferences they always exchange a URL or
something. Yeah, that is really useful.
Communication and resource sharing via Twitter are
forms of engagement that, for our participants, con-
tinue to be important beyond the use around a specific
event. Twenty participants reported using Twitter for
connecting with other DH scholars on a regular basis.
It's like the de facto [. . .] I don't know many people in
DH that aren't on Twitter. (P3)
As far as uses for Twitter within this community, all 23
of those participants who reported using Twitter regu-
larly claimed to use it for sharing other's research,
which is readily understood given the ease of the one-
click ``retweet'' button. Eighteen participants chose to
engage with their audience by using Twitter to dissem-
inate their own research, a practice that correlates with
increased readership (Terras, 2012). More informal
exchanges also appear facilitated by Twitter. As previ-
ously mentioned, Twitter was used by DH scholars to
seek input and advice. One participant (P19) com-
mented on the usefulness of relying on hashtags to
gain the attention of specific communities active on
Twitter such as #twitterstorians.
Twitter use served to expand participants' social net-
works by meeting new DH scholars and gaining famil-
iarity with their research interests. Seventeen of the 23
participants who use Twitter claimed they had met new
people on Twitter, with P23 even claiming:
There are some people who I would count as my friends
that I've never met in real life.
What is it about Twitter that promotes sharing
research, asking questions and delving into conversa-
tions with strangers? Perhaps, as Marwick and Boyd
(2010) note, it is the shift from a broadcast audience,
a ``faceless mass,'' to a networked audience, which is
``unidentified but contains familiar faces; it is both
potentially public and personal'' (p. 129).
When DH scholars engage with one another on
Twitter, they are able to acquire more information
about a specific user by looking at their website or
blog (usually linked to in their Twitter profile), examin-
ing other conversations they have had, and finding
images or pictures they have posted. This contextual-
ization moves the audience from one that is wholly
`imagined' to one that is identifiable and easier to con-
nect with. Also central to understanding the social
gratifications of Twitter is the social context in which
8 Big Data & Society
scholars interact: DH scholars share similar interests,
are part of overlapping networks, use a common lan-
guage, and have shared goals. This social context allows
for the development of a loosely connected social net-
work that integrates both strong and weak ties.
Discussion and future work
Our first research question examined how DH scholars
use Twitter. Twitter was often part of a broader `social
media toolbox' that includes other social media sites
such as Academia.edu (Quan-Haase and Young,
2010). Twitter use varied in the study population:
some scholars did not use it a lot, while others felt
that they used it too much. DH scholars reported
great variability in use: for some use was interstitial,
while others said it was a daily activity, and yet
others said that they used it a lot, but in an uneven
manner. Our findings show that sheer numbers
cannot reflect how DH scholars engage on Twitter;
scholars' thoughts on their use of Twitter were always
in relation to how Twitter fits with their current per-
sonal and work context. Future research could develop
a typology of DH Twitter users, which could serve to
make comparisons across disciplinary fields.
The second research question investigated what
informational and social gratifications DH scholars
obtained from Twitter. As Myers et al. (2014) suggest,
Twitter is a hybrid network, exhibiting markers indica-
tive of both an informational and social network. We
found that the uses and gratifications framework was a
fruitful approach for shedding light on this debate. The
gratifications obtained range from the more informa-
tional gratifications of digital literacy and staying
up-to-date on what is happening in DH to the more
social gratifications of finding a voice and becoming
an active member of the DH community, corroborating
and expanding on Myers et al.'s (2014) original work.
Learning to Twitter was perceived by DH scholars
as a form of digital literacy on which many of them
thrived. Often seeing the need to craft tweets as a chal-
lenge, their ability to communicate via this platform
and make their posts clear to others meant they were
able to relay information and ideas and get their main
points across. As DH has been shown to be one of the
disciplines that relies on Twitter most (Holmberg and
Thelwall, 2014), the need to gain this digital literacy
skill is critical for being a member of the community.
Also of importance is the need to be able to read and
interpret tweets in order to maintain awareness about
the intricacies of DH. Participants noted that Twitter
was the first place they went to when wanting to learn
more about DH. Having this ever-changing, constant
feed of updates about their DH colleagues, teaching
and research was one of the main informational
gratifications these scholars obtained from using
Twitter. However, maintaining awareness inevitably
leads to exposure to the noise of all of the information
those in a person's network deem interesting to share
with their `imagined audience.' Should we develop
more sophisticated tools for filtering the noise, to
narrow the gap between the imagined and real audi-
ence? Perhaps filtering tweets so that only those
tweets directly related to a scholar's research interests
appear in the scholar's Twitter feed. Or is the noise a
double-sided coin, both a strength and a weakness of
the social media platform? While too much noise can be
bad, noise is also a sign of a dynamic, information-rich
environment (Makri et al., 2014). Our findings suggest
noise has the potential to facilitate serendipitous
experiences.
Striving to communicate more effectively on Twitter
also points to ways in which DH scholars are trying to
enhance the social part of the information/social net-
work equation. There is incentive for DH scholars to
join Twitter, evidenced from its current widespread
adoption.
What makes communication on Twitter challenging
for many of our DH scholars is that it is not only
geared toward exchanging information effectively, but
also toward engaging in deeper conversations, reaching
out to others, providing and giving feedback, and
acknowledging support from followers. Twitter for
many DH scholars is a conversation, one that takes
place through a single tweet or a series of interactive
tweets, and in relation to other discourses online and
offline, both inside and outside their disciplines.
Conversations, retweets and follows on Twitter all
help DH scholars to feel they are part of the commu-
nity, which keeps its strength through digital media.
Future research could examine whether Twitter gener-
ates new collaborations and innovative research out-
comes, key ingredients for a striving invisible college.
Twitter adds to other means of interaction, enhancing
through digital connection ties that are formed in other
social spheres.
Conclusion
Welles (2014) made the case for examining subsets of
Big Data sets. She argued that while Big Data enables
the examination of human behaviour at unprecedented
scale, it also provides an opportunity to examine mino-
rities and outliers. While Big Data enables researchers
to summarize human behaviour, researchers should not
lose sight of a second major advantage of Big Data,
``the plentiful representation of minorities'' (Welles,
2014: 1). Though it remains to be seen whether DH
scholars are outliers with respect to their behaviour
on Twitter, Big Data analysis techniques could provide
Quan-Haase et al. 9
an opportunity to increase our understanding of the
inner workings of the DH invisible college within
Twitter.
We conclude that the concept of the invisible college
as introduced by de Solla Price requires revisiting. The
invisible college formed on Twitter is messy, consisting
of overlapping social contexts (professional, personal,
and public), scholars with different habits of engage-
ment and both formal and informal ties. Future
research could investigate how the invisible college
formed on Twitter is associated with citation and co-
citation networks (Mutschke and Quan-Haase, 2001).
We also conclude that our findings support Myers
et al.'s (2014) notion of a hybrid network (social and
informational). Furthermore, our study informs and
expands Big Data research and illustrates that social
context matters. Through its macro-level analysis, Big
Data has framed Twitter networks as a dichotomy ­
information versus social network. Our research pro-
vides a more nuanced understanding of how shared
interests (e.g. common subject specialties), goals,
understandings and pre-existing social ties can influence
the nature of the network. Within the context of DH
scholarship, information networks do not function
solely as a means for broadcasting to and gathering
from a large information network of followers.
Rather, it seems that ties that may start as informa-
tion-based ties often become social ties in the context
of finding shared ground.
