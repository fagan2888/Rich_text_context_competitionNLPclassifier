Article
"Doing Gender" as an article and as a concept is widely
influential in and outside of sociology. Although the original
article itself had a difficult time coming to publication (see
West & Zimmerman, 2009, for more details), most sociolo-
gists now expect graduate students (and likely undergradu-
ates, too) to be familiar with the concept and/or to have read
the original 1987 article. The symposium in Gender &
Society on the 20th anniversary of the article's publication
(Gender & Society, Vol. 23(1)) asked whether "doing gen-
der" was part of the sociological canon, a call to research, or
something else. Indeed, the authors in the symposium docu-
ment the myriad of ways in which the concept of "doing
gender" has informed research projects and theoretical
explications of social behavior.
In this article, I revisit the concept of "doing gender" as
West and Zimmerman (2009) implore in their response to the
Gender & Society symposium. I ask whether "doing gender"
as described in 1987 and rearticulated in 2009 is a social or a
sociological theory. Building on Chafetz's (2004a) critique
of much of feminist theory, I query whether the framework
as directly articulated by the authors is meant to be a descrip-
tion of social life (a social theory) or a testable and poten-
tially falsifiable explanation of the empirical world (a
sociological theory). I then show how the critiques that West
and Zimmerman (2009) bring to bear on much of the research
that uses "doing gender" are due to researchers' use of the
concept as a social, rather than sociological, theory. This
misuse has yielded scores of publications providing valuable
thick description on social life without direct tests of the
mechanisms by which "doing gender" is purported to explain
the reproduction of gender inequality. I conclude by making
the case for the role of "doing gender" in, rather than as,
sociological theory.
Defining Sociological Theory
I have been heavily influenced by Janet Chafetz's (2004a)
article (a symposium presentation subsequently published as
an article alongside the symposium discussants' critiques),
where she critically assesses the state of feminist theory in
social science and in sociology as a discipline. Chafetz
(2004a) argues that the goal of social science
is to develop explanations (theories)--that is, attempts to answer
questions of why and how--of empirically documentable
phenomena concerning human behavior and the structures and
processes they create in the present and have created in other
times and places. (p. 964)
There are, she argues, two key components to the discipline
of sociology: (a) an emphasis on using systematic approaches

Sociology, Theory, and the Feminist
Sociological Canon: Questioning the
Use of "Doing Gender" as a Sociological
Theory
Shannon N. Davis1
Abstract
In this article, I revisit the concept of "doing gender" to query whether the framework as directly articulated by West and
Zimmerman is meant to be a description of social life (a social theory) or a testable and potentially falsifiable explanation of
the empirical world (a sociological theory). I document how much of the research that uses "doing gender" is a misapplication
of the concept as a social, rather than sociological, theory. I conclude by making the case for the role of "doing gender" in,
rather than as, sociological theory.

to learn about the world (methodologies) and (b) theory, or
"the development of at least relatively abstract explanations
of empirically testable and documentable phenomena"
(Chafetz, 2004a, p. 965).
Sociology as a discipline has long fought with itself regard-
ing our comfort with being called a science. Even Weber
(1922) famously argued for sociology's usefulness as a sci-
ence and in society. Much in the discipline's history has been
written about the extent to which sociology is a science, but
much of that discourse has been derived from a "positivist"
version of science. That is, the truth, reality, can be discovered
through objectivity, meaning removing the researcher's sub-
jective bias. Feminists have critiqued this approach to doing
science (e.g., DeVault, 1996; Sprague & Zimmerman, 1993;
and even Chafetz, 2004a, 2004b), but one key fact remains. If
sociology is a science, we use systematic approaches to study-
ing the social world, and through those approaches, we both
derive and test relatively abstract explanations for empirical
phenomena.
A sociological theory is not one that is philosophically ori-
ented that discusses the nature of social life--that would be
what Chafetz (2004a) calls social theory. Sociological theory
would go beyond description and would be focused on
explaining how and why the empirical world operates as it
does. This includes articulation of mechanisms (Hedström &
Swedberg, 1998; Reskin, 2003) such that the premise of the
theory itself is testable and falsifiable. Theories are evaluated,
therefore, not on their ability to completely explain one spe-
cific set of experiences but instead their ability to explain (and
predict as Smith-Lovin, 2000, would argue) the "empirically
knowable world" (Chafetz, 2004a, p. 965). Social theory, on
the contrary, provides thick description of social experiences,
often elucidating the mechanisms to be included subsequently
in sociological theories as they document social life in par-
ticular, ultimately leading to the refinement of sociological
theory. Both sociological and social theory are important in
the doing of our work as social scientists, as can be seen, for
example, in the case of Morris's (2012) examination of gen-
der and education in a two low-income high schools.
Highlighting the inadequacy of contemporary sociological
theories about educational attainment in explaining the edu-
cational gender gap, Morris develops an argument about the
importance of how gender is constructed in a place, how it is
contextualized, as an additional mechanism that explains how
young men and women are handicapped in the pursuit of edu-
cation. His ethnographic work yields additional insight into
mechanisms through which gender inequality is perpetuated.
In her critique of and response to Chafetz (2004a), Baber
(2004) argues that theory should guide scholarship but should
simultaneously allow for the building of bridges between
scholars and activists in the pursuit of reducing gender
inequality. Therefore, social theory with its focus on how
inequalities are experienced by individuals may be of more
use and value to practitioners than is sociological theory with
its focus on prediction and explanation.
My view of the discipline of sociology is one that is based
on the distinction articulated by Chafetz (2004a). Our goal is
to better understand the social world through the use of sys-
tematic data collection and analysis. The creation of better
explanations (theories) is paramount. I also concur with
Risman (1994), Sprague (2005), and others (Chafetz, 2004a,
included) who note that a feminist empiricist approach (one
that seeks to investigate power relations in a society through
the best methods and analysis techniques for the question at
hand) is not at odds with the notion of the purpose of sociol-
ogy as a discipline nor the feminist epistemological frame-
work that seeks to eliminate gender (and other forms of)
inequality. Some feminist sociologists have argued for the
use of "different" methodologies, pointing to the positivist
straw man as a part of the problem of the continuation of
gender inequality (e.g., DeVault, 1996; Luker, 2008). Like
Sprague and her colleagues (Sprague, 2005; Sprague &
Zimmerman, 1993), I disagree. If the goal of a feminist soci-
ology is to (a) systematically study the social world and
develop explanations for empirical reality which then lead to
(b) the elimination of gender inequality, then the methods
that we use to collect and analyze the empirical world must
be as diverse and responsive as the world itself. Indeed, those
feminist critiques of "science" and discomfort with "more
objective" approaches to studying the social world miss the
big picture. We cannot eradicate gender inequality by amass-
ing many thick descriptions of women's (or men's) lives
based on their standpoint, location in the matrix of domina-
tion, or documentation of how their social location reflects
oppression (Chafetz, 2004a; Schrock & Schwalbe, 2009).
These examples of social theory are but one piece of a larger
puzzle. The creation of systematic explanations for aspects
of the empirically knowable world (here that aspect of the
social world is gender inequality) that can be tested and
potentially altered and/or falsified given empirical scrutiny is
the goal, and all approaches to understanding the social
world are needed to complete this task. As Walker (2004)
rightly argues in her response to Chafetz (2004a), "[c]
ompared with theory developed by so-called objective
observers, acknowledging our own perspectives and asking
how the world looks to others eventually will lead to rich
theory closely linked to social life" (p. 991).
That said, theories must imply how they would be empiri-
cally tested. We must have research methodologies in our sci-
ence that facilitate our testing of our theories. Theories about
the social world that do not readily lend themselves to empiri-
cal scrutiny and potential falsification, that is, have no meth-
odological implications for how researchers would go about
collecting and analyzing empirical materials, nor how the
theory's premises, postulates, mechanisms, and processes can
be evaluated and potentially falsified are not sociological
theories. In this case, the content of the empirical material is
irrelevant. If a theory that purports to describe gender inequal-
ity and its reproduction cannot be potentially falsified, it
would not meet the definition of a sociological theory.

The Case of "Doing Gender"
"Doing Gender," the 1987 article, is the most cited article in
the discipline by most metrics (West & Zimmerman, 2009).
The argument, as restated by West and Zimmerman in 2009,
is as follows. One's sex (female or male) is usually deter-
mined by the possession of female or male genitalia (see
West & Zimmerman, 1987, 2009, for more on the fluid
nature of this categorization). Sex categorization, building
on Goffman (1956), occurs through "the display and recog-
nition of socially regulated external insignia of sex--such as
deportment, dress, and bearing" (West & Zimmerman, 2009,
p. 113). Sex category and gender are related in that gender is
about being recognized as someone inhabiting a sex cate-
gory--and "being accountable to current cultural concep-
tions of conduct becoming to--or compatible with the
`essential natures' of--a woman or man" (West &
Zimmerman, 2009, p. 113). Therefore, gender is conceptual-
ized as an ongoing process, a doing rather than a being.
West and Zimmerman's (2009) article was the conclusion
to a symposium on their original piece. In it, they lament that
authors (including some in the symposium) have misused
their concept, so much so that they felt the need to rearticu-
late its premises. One key critique was the use of "doing gen-
der" as an explanation for the reproduction of gender
inequality. This usage presumes that "gender" is a thing and
that "doing it" reproduces the status quo. Indeed, they argue
that because gender is done and that it requires individuals
being held morally accountable to current cultural norms
ascribed to a sex category, the performance of gender should
and must change over time--but that has little to do (directly)
with the reproduction of gender inequality.
However, many authors, including myself, have invoked
"doing gender" as a theory for why gender inequality is
being reproduced. We have argued that, among other things,
the reason men do less housework than do women is because
they believe they are being held morally accountable to the
sex category of "male." Thus, not doing housework is "doing
gender." But as we use the language of "doing gender," we
are falling into the trap that West and Zimmerman argue is
diametrically opposed to how they had conceived of the con-
cept. Gender is not a thing that is done, that is, a noun.
Instead, "doing gender" is a verb phrase, a process.
Other authors have noted that "doing gender" as a theory
has been misused. Deutsch (2007) recounts many examples
of research that, she argues, utilize "doing gender" as a the-
ory of gender maintenance. Risman (2009) also notes that
"doing gender" has been invoked to document multiple mas-
culinities and femininities; she encourages researchers to
investigate sites where women and men are "undoing gen-
der" (Butler, 2004; Deutsch, 2007). However, as West and
Zimmerman (2009) note, "an emphasis on `undoing gender'
deflects attention away from the situational character of gen-
der accountability, and circumstantial modifications" (p. 118).
While authors like Risman (2009) and Deutsch (2007) want
us to talk about how we can "undo gender," that is, to high-
light "social processes that underlie resistance against con-
ventional gender relations and on how successful change in
the power dynamics and inequities between men and women
can be accomplished" (Deutsch, 2007, p. 107), there remains
a presumption that gender is a thing that exists to maintain
inequality between women and men. The focus is on the
gerund--"doing" versus "undoing" rather than the phrase
"doing gender" versus "undoing gender." West and
Zimmerman (2009) argue that this semantic difference is one
of the crucial points of their theory and the place where the
usage of their theory has been problematic.
This process of "doing gender," as described by West
and Zimmerman (1987, 2009), explains how and why peo-
ple behave as they do. People believe they are being held
morally accountable to a sex category and behave accord-
ing to their understanding of contemporary cultural norms
around that sex category. This explanation for human
behavior fits the definition of a sociological theory on the
face of it, in that it is potentially falsifiable. However, what
are the testable hypotheses derived from this explanation?
Is the underlying abstract process falsifiable? Is there ever
a circumstance that humans will not be behaving as they do
at least in part because they believe they will be held mor-
ally accountable for their behavior? For example, Hirschi's
(1969) social control theory highlights the centrality of
being held morally accountable to a particular peer group
even among deviants. Thus, the use of "sociological the-
ory" as a descriptor for "doing gender" may not be war-
ranted. This distinction is more than semantic, as a large
body of scholarship has been published that purports to find
support for this theory. And much of this scholarship,
including the articles in the 2009 Gender & Society sympo-
sium, frames "doing gender" as an explanation for the
reproduction of gender inequality, thus solidifying its posi-
tion in the feminist sociological canon.
Herein lies the irony. Based on the arguments presented
here, "doing gender" does not meet the definition of a socio-
logical theory that explains the reproduction of gender
inequality. But West and Zimmerman never intended it to be.
Resituating "Doing Gender" Into
Sociological Theories
West andFenstermaker(1995)extendWest andZimmerman's
(1987) argument to other forms of difference (and categori-
cal inequalities; Tilly, 1998) by noting that distinctions
among groups are not essential but must be created and
maintained. Interestingly, they argue that difference is a
social doing, a mechanism that helps explain how categori-
cal inequalities are reproduced. Following this logic, both
"doing gender" and "doing difference" are themselves not
theories, but are mechanisms through which inequalities are
reproduced.

Therefore, "doing gender" (and "doing difference") is
useful for explaining the reproduction of inequality when
incorporated as a mechanism into broader theoretical expla-
nations. The notion of "doing gender" is a key explanatory
mechanism invoked by Chafetz (1990) in her theory explain-
ing the links between macro- and micro-level gender
inequality as well as by Ridgeway (2011) in her specifica-
tion of status expectations theory as applied to gender
inequality. Clearly articulated mechanisms, such as those
implied in the "doing gender" approach, provide insight into
the "black box" of sociological theory. These mechanisms
describe the how and why of a theory. As Gross (2009)
argues, mechanisms must be centered around social action.
In the case of Chafetz (1990), knowing one will be held
accountable for one's behavior based on sex category leads
women and men to behave in ways that reinforce patriarchal
norms at the micro level. Furthermore, these norms of moral
accountability are part of the cultural ideology that con-
structs appropriate behaviors for women and men in institu-
tional settings. Ridgeway, in some ways building on this
idea, notes that gender is like a ghost in all interactions; it is
there even when it is not being directly invoked. Individuals
are being held accountable to culturally constructed norms
of behavior tied to sex categories even in situations when
gender is irrelevant to the task at hand (Ridgeway, 2011).
Thus, "doing gender" as a concept is one of the mechanisms
invoked in Ridgeway's specification of status expectations
theory, as it is one of the explanations for how gender
inequality is reproduced through everyday interactions.
Calls for research focusing on "undoing gender" (Deutsch,
2007), where scholars examine how behaviors reduce
inequality, miss West and Zimmerman's (1987/2009) point
that "doing gender" is not about the maintenance of gender
inequality (although Deutsch (2007) is accurate in her
description regarding how the theory is used). Instead, it is a
set of explanations for the origins and maintenance of cul-
turally constructed norms of behavior tied to sex categories.
As a mechanism, "doing gender" explains how culturally
constructed norms of behavior tied to sex categories are
maintained as well as challenged and modified, as people
are held accountable to the contemporary norms.As Deutsch
(2007) demonstrates, norms are modified through interac-
tion and structural shifts but the processes of holding people
accountable to those culturally constructed norms of behav-
ior tied to sex category remain the same. "Doing gender" is
not intended to explain the maintenance of gender inequal-
ity; West and Zimmerman (1987/2009) intend it as a mecha-
nism that can be used to explain the reproduction of, and
possibly the disruption of, culturally constructed norms of
behavior tied to sex category.
What does this mean, then, for the disposition of research
that purports to test or utilize "doing gender" theory? I would
argue that this voluminous body of scholarship is quite
important to our understanding of the social world but as
examples of "doing gender" as a mechanism for the
reproduction of gender inequality. Understanding the lives of
men and women as they are lived is important. We cannot
ignore how social location impacts lives, nor should we min-
imize scholarship that has documented how oppression and
domination, as well as privilege and entitlement, operate in
people's lives. But as Schrock and Schwalbe (2009) argue,
simply documenting "multiple masculinities" or "multiple
femininities" based on interlocking axes of domination
masks the underlying processes that reproduce gender
inequality structurally. For sociologists, both those of us
embracing the label of feminist and those who do not, our
goal remains the same. If we want to change the world, we
must first understand it. And true sociological understanding
is derived from the principles that make sociology the disci-
pline that it is--rigorous, systematic approaches for the col-
lection and analysis of materials regarding empirically
known phenomena and "relatively abstract explanations" for
those phenomena that are empirically testable and falsifiable.
"Doing gender" as a concept, and research invoking it, has a
place in our science, albeit one more in line with what the
concepts' originators had intended than how it has regularly
been used.
