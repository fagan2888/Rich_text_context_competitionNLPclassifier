Abstract
Objective: Pretreatment with intravenous 40 mg or 0.5 mg/kg lidocaine with venous occlusion is
recommended to prevent pain following injection of lipid emulsion propofol. This approach is not
sufficient to prevent pain from the injection of microemulsion propofol. The present study
investigated whether a higher dose of lidocaine pretreatment with venous occlusion would be
more effective for reducing pain following injection of microemulsion propofol compared with
40 mg lidocaine.
Methods: Patients undergoing elective surgery were randomly assigned to one of three groups:
pretreatment with 40 mg (group L40), 60 mg (group L60) or 80 mg (group L80) lidocaine
intravenously with venous occlusion, followed by injection with microemulsion propofol 1 min
later. Pain was assessed on a four-point scale (severe, moderate, mild, none) based on physical
responses to the injection.
Results: A total of 68 patients were included in the final analysis. Pain severity and incidence were
significantly lower in patients in group L60 and L80 compared with patients in group L40. There
were no statistically significant differences in pain incidence or severity between group L60 and
group L80.
Conclusions: Pretreatment with 60 mg lidocaine intravenously with venous occlusion may be the
most effective minimum dose for reducing injection pain following microemulsion propofol
administration for induction of anaesthesia.

Introduction
Hydrosoluble, lipid-free microemulsion pro-
pofol and lipid emulsion propofol have
comparable pharmacokinetic and pharma-
codynamic profiles.1­6 Microemulsion pro-
pofol has several advantages over lipid
emulsion propofol in that it demonstrates
higher physicochemical stability and anti-
microbial activity,7 which avoids lipid sol-
vent-related complications such as
hyperlipidaemia, pulmonary fat embolism,
pancreatitis and propofol-infusion syn-
drome.8 It is, however, associated with
more intense and frequent pain on injection
compared with lipid emulsion propofol.9
Thus interventions that aim to limit the
injection pain caused by microemulsion
propofol during induction of anaesthesia
are important.
The most effective and easy to perform
strategy for the prevention of pain on injec-
tion of propofol is intravenous lidocaine
pretreatment with venous occlusion.10,11 A
dose of 40 mg or 0.5 mg/kg lidocaine admin-
istered intravenously with venous occlusion
into the upper limb is recommended for the
alleviation of pain on injection with lipid
emulsion propofol,10,12 and this approach
has resulted in reports of pain reduction in
60­86% of patients.10,12 In contrast, other
studies have failed to demonstrate a similar
reduction of pain on injection of microemul-
sion propofol using 40 mg lidocaine, with
only 24­38% of patients experiencing no
injection pain.13
The aim of the present study was to
compare the efficacy of pretreatment with
60 mg and 80 mg lidocaine with venous
occlusion with a 40 mg dose in reducing
pain on injection of microemulsion propofol
in patients undergoing elective surgery. It
was hypothesized that the higher doses of
lidocaine with venous occlusion would be
more effective for reducing pain compared
with 40 mg lidocaine.
Patients and methods
Study population
Patients with American Association of
Anesthesiology physical status I or II who
were 20­60 years of age and undergoing
elective surgery at Ajou University Hospital,
Suwon, Republic of Korea between 15 July
and 9 August 2013 were recruited. Patients
with a history of neurological problems or
allergies and those who had taken medica-
tions including sedatives and analgesics
within 24 h of surgery, which may affect
the study results, were excluded. In addition,
patients with a body weight of < 55 kg were
excluded as the maximum dose of lidocaine
in these patients would be <1.5 mg/kg.
Written informed consent was obtained
from all patients and the study protocol was
approved by the Ajou University Hospital
Institutional Review Board.
Study design
Patients were randomly allocated into three
groups using a sealed-envelope method
immediately prior to induction of anaesthe-
sia. Groups received: (i) 40 mg lidocaine
(group L40); (ii) 60 mg lidocaine (group
L60); (iii) 80 mg lidocaine (group L80). A
placebo group was not included for ethical
reasons. To preserve blinding, normal saline
(0.9%) was added to give a total volume of
study medication of 4 ml in groups L40 and
L60. All study drugs were prepared just
before injection at room temperature.
Microemulsion propofol (AquafolÕ;
Kim et al. 369
Daewon Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Seoul,
Republic of Korea), which contained 1%
propofol, 10% purified poloxamer 188
(PP188) as a nonionic block copolymer
surfactant, and 0.7% polyethylene glycol
(PEG) 660 hydroxystearate as a nonionic
surfactant, was prepared in a 50 ml syringe.
A commercially available, two-channel,
target-controlled infusion (TCI) pump
(OrchestraÕ Base Primea with a two-infu-
sion pump module: Module DPS
OrchestraÕ IS3; Fresenius Vial S.A.S,
Brezins, France) was used for effect-site
TCI of the microemulsion propofol.
The pharmacokinetic model used to calcu-
late target effect-site concentration (Ce)
for microemulsion propofol was that of
Marsh et al.14
Before patients were transferred into the
operating room, a 20-gauge venous cannula
was placed in a vein of the forearm. No
premedication was given before the admin-
istration of anaesthesia. On arrival in the
operating room, patients underwent basic
monitoring including electrocardiogram,
pulse oximetry and noninvasive blood pres-
sure measurement. After venous occlusion
was applied with a rubber tourniquet, the
allocated dose of lidocaine was injected. The
tourniquet was released after 1 min and
microemulsion propofol was administered
through the same venous cannula to achieve
a target Ce of 5.2 mg/ml at a maximum flow
rate of 750 ml/h, which represented a bolus
of 120 mg over 60 s for a 66 kg patient
(the mean weight of the study patients)
approximating to an infusion rate of
2 mg/kg per min.
Study assessments
Pain was assessed by H.S.C., who was
blind to the pretreatment lidocaine dose,
from the start of the microemulsion pro-
pofol injection to the point of loss of
consciousness. The severity of pain was
graded on a four-point scale:15 `severe
pain' was manifest as a verbal response
accompanied by facial grimacing or with-
drawal of the arm; `moderate pain' was
defined as grimacing or arm withdrawal
not accompanied by a verbal response;
`mild pain' was recorded if after 30 s the
patient had not experienced moderate or
severe pain but reported discomfort in the
arms when questioned; `no pain' was rec-
orded if the patient did not report arm
discomfort when questioned.
After loss of consciousness, anaesthetic
management was left to the discretion of the
attending anaesthesiologist. All patients
were evaluated in the postanaesthesia care
unit following surgery for abnormal injec-
tion-site responses including erythema, phle-
bitis, oedema and pain.
Statistical analyses
Based on preliminary unpublished data
regarding the incidence of injection-site
pain obtained at Ajou University Hospital,
a total sample of 65 patients was determined
to be sufficient to achieve 90% power to
detect differences with a type I error of 0.05
(two-tailed) and a type II error of 0.10.
Based on this assumption, a minimum of 22
patients per treatment group was required.
Assuming some patients would drop-out of
the study, the sample size was increased to
23 patients per group.
Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSSÕ statistical software, version 11.0
(SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. Data are expressed as
mean Æ SD or number (%) of patients.
Patient characteristics were compared
using one-way analysis of variance or
2-test, as appropriate. Differences in pain
grades between groups were analysed using
Kruskal­Wallis test or 2-test. Post hoc
comparisons were performed using Mann­
Whitney U-test with Bonferroni's correc-
tion. Results were considered statistically
significant when the P-value was < 0.05.

Results
In total, 69 patients undergoing elective
surgery were included in the study. One
patient in group L40 was excluded from the
analyses because of concealed leakage
between the line for fluid and the intraven-
ous catheter (Figure 1). Demographic data
for all patients included in the analyses are
presented in Table 1; there were no signifi-
cant differences between the three groups.

The incidence and severity of injection
pain following administration of microe-
mulsion propofol in all three treatment
groups are presented in Table 2. Incidence
and severity of pain were statistically sig-
nificantly lower in patients in groups L60
and L80 compared with patients in group
L40 (P 0.011). No significant differences
were observed in intensity or incidence of
injection pain between patients in group L60
and group L80. There was no evidence of
clinical symptoms or signs related to sys-
temic toxicity of lidocaine in any patient. No
patients experienced any pain or abnormal
injection-site reactions postsurgery.
Discussion
The present study demonstrated that pre-
treatment with 60 mg or 80 mg lidocaine
with venous occlusion significantly reduced
the incidence and severity of pain following
injection of microemulsion propofol com-
pared with 40 mg lidocaine. No significant
difference was observed in intensity or inci-
dence of pain between patients in group L60
and patients in group L80. This finding
implies that 60 mg lidocaine may be the
optimal dose for reducing pain following
injection of microemulsion propofol.
Microemulsion propofol was developed
as an alternative to lipid emulsion propofol,
which is associated with problems such as
pulmonary embolism,16,17 bacterial infec-
tion,18,19 hypertriglyceridaemia and pan-
creatitis.8,20 The first microemulsion
propofol formulation was composed of 1%
propofol, 8% PEG 660 hydroxystearate
(SolutolÕ HS 15; BASF, Seoul, Korea) and
5% tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol polyethylene
glycol ether (Glycofurol; Roche, Basel,
Switzerland), and demonstrated effects bioe-
quivalent to lipid emulsion propofol.2 As a
consequence of toxicities such as drug erup-
tion, urticaria, fever and dizziness, increased
total bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase,
and chest discomfort, microemulsion pro-
pofol has been reformulated and now

PP188 and 0.7% PEG 660 hydroxystearate.3
This formulation was as effective as lipid
emulsion propofol and showed similar
pharmacokinetics.4 The free propofol con-
centration in the aqueous phase of the
reformulated microemulsion propofol is,
however, five times greater than that of the
original formulation,21 meaning it has an
increased potential to produce frequent and
severe pain on injection.22,23 Pain on injec-
tion is one of the major drawbacks of
microemulsion propofol9 and it is important
that methods to decrease injection pain in
the clinical setting are available. Published
research has demonstrated that 81.9% of
patients experienced moderate to severe
injection pain after microemulsion propofol
administration, with an average visual ana-
logue scale score (VAS; 0 mm, no pain,
100 mm, worst pain imaginable) of 72 mm.4
In another study, the incidence of injection
pain (defined as VAS > 30 mm) following
microemulsion propofol administration was
reported to be 69.7% with a median VAS
score of 59 mm.9
Among the various methods proposed to
decrease injection pain, lidocaine pretreat-
ment with venous occlusion is one of the
most effective.10,11 Pretreatment with 40 mg
or 0.5 mg/kg lidocaine with venous occlu-
sion of the upper limb is recommended for
alleviating injection pain associated with
lipid emulsion propofol administration.10,12
Using this strategy, the overall incidence of
pain on lipid emulsion propofol injection
has been reported to range from 8% to 42%,
while the incidence of moderate to severe
pain ranges from 2% to 16%.12,24­28 In the
present study, the overall incidence of injec-
tion pain following microemulsion propofol
administration in patients in group L40 was
77.3% and the incidence of moderate to
severe injection pain was 63.6%, which is
comparable to previous data.13 These find-
ings suggest that pretreatment with 40 mg
lidocaine in the clinical setting is insufficient
to prevent injection pain following micro-
emulsion propofol. The present study also
evaluated 60 mg and 80 mg lidocaine pre-
treatment. These doses were selected after
consideration of the established range of
lidocaine doses used in the treatment or
prophylaxis of ventricular arrhythmias29
and by excluding patients weighing <55 kg
such that the maximum dose of lidocaine
used in the present study was <1.5 mg/kg.
Potential mechanisms of injection pain
following propofol have been proposed,
including triggering of the local kallikrein­
kinin cascade,30 stimulation by direct con-
tact between aqueous phase propofol and
free nerve endings in the inner venous wall,30
or the pH and concentration of propo-
fol.22,31 The exact mechanism by which
lidocaine reduces propofol-induced pain
remains unclear. It is possible that lidocaine
pretreatment in the present study may have
induced bradykinin generation associated
with activation of the plasma kallikrein­
kinin system. Previous studies have,
however, reported no evidence that the
generation of bradykinin through activation
of the plasma kallikrein­kinin system was
associated with propofol-induced pain.9
Venous occlusion, as employed in the pre-
sent study, may have blocked the nerve
fibres that are responsible for transmission
of pain resulting from direct irritation of the
inner blood vessel walls by propofol. This
direct anaesthetic effect of lidocaine is
achieved when the dose is adequate and
sufficient time for the drug to work is
allowed: in previously published studies,
higher doses of lidocaine have generally
been more effective than lower doses,32
although it has been reported in a systematic
review of the literature that there is no
obvious dose­response relationship within
the dose range of 20­100 mg lidocaine.10 The
results of the present study demonstrate that
a lidocaine dose of at least 60 mg with
venous occlusion is required to reduce injec-
tion pain following microemulsion propofol.
Kim et al. 373
Microemulsion propofol was still found to
cause moderate to severe pain, even after
pretreatment with 60 mg or 80 mg lidocaine.
This is probably because microemulsion
propofol and lidocaine do not exert their
effects on the same pain pathway, because
there was an insufficient time interval
between lidocaine administration and
release of the tourniquet, or insufficient
pressure was generated by venous occlusion.
In conclusion, the present study demon-
strated that prior administration of 60 mg or
80 mg of lidocaine with venous occlusion
was more effective for reducing pain follow-
ing injection of microemulsion propofol
than 40 mg lidocaine. No further reductions
in the incidence or severity of pain were
observed with 80 mg lidocaine compared
with the 60 mg dose.
