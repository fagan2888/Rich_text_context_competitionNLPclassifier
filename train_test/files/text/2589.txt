Background. Reports of insomnia symptoms are common among the elderly. However, little is known about the relationship
between insomnia symptoms and objective assessments of sleep in the general population of older adults. We assessed concord-
ance between insomnia symptoms and actigraphic sleep characteristics in a nationally representative sample of olderAmericans.
Methods. In a national probability sample of 727 adults aged 62­91 years in 2010­2011 from the National Social Life,
Health, and Aging Project, respondents were asked how often they (a) feel rested when they wake up, (b) have trouble falling
asleep, (c) have trouble with waking up during the night, and (d) have trouble waking up too early and not being able to fall
asleep again. Responses to these questions were compared to sleep characteristics estimated from three nights of actigraphy
for the same individuals. Statistical analyses were adjusted for age, gender, race and ethnicity, income, assets, and education.
Results. Feelingrested(Question(a),above)wasnotcorrelatedwithanyactigraphy-estimatedsleepcharacteristics.Questions
(b)­(d) each had several significant correlations with the actigraphy metrics, but generally not with the specific objective sleep
characteristics that each question intended to reference. In some cases, the associations were not in the expected direction.
Conclusions.Although three of four questions about insomnia symptoms were significantly associated with objec-
tively estimated sleep characteristics, responses seem to be general indicators of sleep quality rather than reports of
specific sleep characteristics.

Insomnia is a highly prevalent condition, with an
estimated 30% of adults having some symptoms and
6­10% meeting clinical definitions (1). Insomnia is defined
and diagnosed on the basis of patient-reported problems.
While clinical definitions differ somewhat between the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and
International Classification of Diseases, and between edi-
tions, several key components are similar (2). These include
reported difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep (specifi-
cally falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up too early)
and daytime sequelae, including feeling unrested.
The diagnostic criteria for insomnia rely on the pres-
ence or absence of a set of symptoms (3). Little is known
about the extent to which reports of insomnia symptoms
correspond to objective assessments of sleep. Although a
few studies have tried to compare reports of insomnia to
objective sleep assessments (4­7), the majority of them
measure sleep characteristics identified by sleep specialists,
in a series of patients who sought treatment for insomnia
or related conditions. These patients are not representative
of the general population seen in primary care settings or
reporting such symptoms in surveys. There has been little
attention to the relationship between insomnia symptom
reports and objective sleep measures in the general popu-
lation of older adults. Insomnia is very common among
older adults. Prior studies suggested that nearly half of
older adults report at least one insomnia symptom (8), and
those with medical problems are particularly likely to have
insomnia symptoms (9,10). Furthermore, insomnia has
been linked to adverse health outcomes among older adults,
186 CHEN ET AL.
including declines in cognitive function (11­13), daytime
functioning (14,15), falls (16,17), and heart disease (18). In
addition, insomnia at old ages was associated with greater
use of costly health services (19). Understanding the nature
and correlates of insomnia symptom reports in relation to
objective sleep measures in the general population of older
adults would enhance our knowledge of how to interpret
insomnia reports from population-based studies and in clin-
ical practice.
In this study, we assessed the concordance between four
survey questions about insomnia symptoms and actigraph-
estimated sleep characteristics, using a nationally rep-
resentative sample of community-dwelling older adults.
Specifically, we compared each sleep question, as well as
a composite score based on these questions, to several acti-
graph-estimated sleep characteristics. Because these ques-
tions asked respondents to recall specific characteristics of
sleep, some of which are also estimated through actigraphy,
we expected that insomnia symptoms would significantly
correlate with actigraphic sleep characteristics.
Methods
National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project
This study used data from participants in the National
Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP). NSHAP is
a population-based, longitudinal study of health, social life,
and well-being of older Americans. A nationally representa-
tive probability sample of 3,005 community-dwelling indi-
viduals aged 57­85 was selected from households across the
U.S. screened in 2004 and the first wave of the survey was
conducted during 2005­2006. We relied on data from the
second wave, which was conducted during 2010­2011.
Approximately one-third of the Wave 2 respondents were
randomly invited to participate in an additional "Activity
and Sleep Study." The design and detailed information on
this study has been described previously (20). The activity
and sleep study had two components: (a) a self-administered
sleep booklet, which included questions about respondents'
sleep experience and (b) 72 hours of wrist actigraphy using
the Actiwatch Spectrum model from Phillips Respironics.
The booklet and Actiwatch were mailed out with a pre-
paid return mailer a few days after the in-home NSHAP
interview. Participants were instructed to wear the Actiwatch
on the nondominant wrist (the one not used for writing) for
three full days. Most participants did so but a few individuals
wore theActiwatch for fewer or more days. In total, 766 indi-
viduals aged 62­91 completed the Activity and Sleep Study.
After excluding 39 individuals with no recorded or usable
data from the actigraphs, the sleep study yielded a sample
of 727 individuals with complete data. There were no sys-
temic differences in social and demographic characteristics
between the subsample and the NSHAP full sample.As such,
the sleep subsample is also nationally representative.
Actigraphy and Actigraph-Estimated Sleep
Characteristics
The Actiwatch records intensity and frequency of
movement with a piezoelectric linear accelerometer in
epochs (15-second epochs were selected for this study).
The Actiwatch continually registers wrist movements,
and the sum of all wrist movements during each epoch
is saved as an activity score. These data were analyzed
using manufacturer-developedActiware software (version
5.59). In this study, we focused on nine actigraph-derived
sleep parameters, capturing three aspects of older adults'
sleep characteristics: duration, timing, and consolidation.
The duration variables are sleep period (the total amount
of time between when an individual first falls asleep and
last awakens) and total sleep time (the total duration of
all of the epochs scored as sleep during the sleep period).
The timing variables are the clock time falling asleep
(first epoch recorded as sleep) and clock wake up time
(last epoch recorded as sleep). The consolidation vari-
ables are percent sleep (the percent of the sleep period
scored as actual sleep), wake after sleep onset (or WASO,
the minutes awake during the sleep period), number of
wake bouts during the sleep period, sleep fragmentation
(21) (an index of sleep disruption that is the sum of two
percentages: the percentage of the sleep period spent
moving and the percentage of immobile periods only 1
minute long, and latency (the amount of time it takes an
individual to fall asleep initially after she or he begins
to try falling asleep). Latency was only estimated for the
subset of nights when participants remembered to press
the event marker when they began trying to fall asleep,
as instructed.
All actigraph-estimated measures except latency are
three-night averages. For the 53 individuals (<7% of the
total sample) with fewer than three nights of data, we aver-
aged all available nights. Weekdays and weekends acti-
graph-estimated sleep characteristics were similar in this
mostly retired population.
Insomnia Questions
The NSHAP core survey included a restorative sleep
question asking "How often do you feel really rested when
you wake up in the morning?" The sleep booklet included
three additional questions related to initiating and maintain-
ing sleep: "How often do you have trouble falling asleep?";
"How often do you have trouble with waking up during the
night?"; and "How often do you have trouble with wak-
ing up too early and not being able to fall asleep again?"
Response categories for all four questions were: most of the
time = 2, sometimes = 1, and rarely/never = 0.
In addition to examining each of these questions sepa-
rately, we constructed an insomnia symptom scale (total
score ranging from 0 to 8) by reverse-coding the feel-
ing rested question and then summing all four items.
INSOMNIA SYMPTOMS AND ACTIGRAPH-ESTIMATED SLEEP CHARACTERISTICS 187
Exploratory factor analysis showed that these four items
loaded into a single factor and the reliability of the scale is
within the acceptable range ( = 0.65).
Expected Relationships between Actigraph-Estimated
SLEEP and Insomnia Symptoms
Based on the insomnia questions and the definition of
actigraphic sleep characteristics, we expected that individu-
als who reported feeling rested in the morning would have
more total sleep time, higher percent sleep, less WASO,
fewer wake bouts, and a lower sleep fragmentation score.
For trouble falling asleep, we expected a positive associa-
tion with earlier clock time falling asleep (as individuals
with insomnia commonly get into bed too early) and longer
latency. We expected that trouble waking up during the night
would be inversely correlated with percent sleep and would
positively correlate with WASO and number of wake bouts.
Finally, we expected that individuals who reported waking
up too early would have less total sleep time and an earlier
wake up time.
Statistical Analyses
In our statistical analyses, the aforementioned insom-
nia questions and insomnia symptom scale were out-
come variables of the statistical analyses and actigraphic
parameters were predictors. We used ordered logistic
regression to assess associations between each insomnia
symptom question and each actigraph-estimated sleep
parameter, controlling for age, age squared, gender, race/
ethnicity, education, household income, and household
assets. Although ordinal logistic regression is easy to fit
and makes interpretation of the results straightforward, it
assumes that the associations of the independent variables
with each one-unit change in the dependent responses are
the same (ie the proportional odds assumption). To ensure
ordered logistic regression was a valid approach, we tested
the proportional odds assumption. For a few models where
the proportional odds assumption was violated, we used
the partial proportional odds model, which models each
one-category change in the dependent variable separately
(22). When the insomnia symptom scale was the outcome
variable, we used ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions
and we used multiple imputation to recover missing values
among control variables (23).
When latency was the key explanatory variable, we per-
formed the analysis using a subsample of actigraphy data
with nonmissing start-event markers because the estimate
of latency is imprecise when the start event marker is miss-
ing. This ensures that our analysis was based on the best
available estimate of latency. The sample size for these
analyses was 627. All analyses took into account the study
design and survey weights using Stata 12 (24).

RESULTS
Descriptive Statistics
Table 1 provides the weighted descriptive statistics. As
the table shows, about 13% of older adults said that they
rarely or never feel rested when waking up in the morning,
12% reported having trouble falling asleep most of the time,
30% indicated they had problems with waking up during
the night most of the time, and 13% reported problems with
waking up too early and not being able to fall asleep again
most of the time.
With respect to actigraph-estimated sleep characteristics,
the average duration of sleep period was 7.9 hours and the
average total sleep time was 7.25 hours. The mean percent
sleep was 82%, the mean sleep fragmentation index was
14%, mean WASO was 39 minutes, and the mean number
of wake bouts was 46. The average clock time falling asleep
of older adults averaged 10:27 pm and their average wake-
up time was 6:22 am.
Mean Actigraph-Estimated Sleep Characteristics by
Insomnia Symptoms
Table 2 shows mean actigraphic sleep characteristics by
the three response levels for each of the insomnia questions
and for tertiles of the insomnia symptom scale. We tested
for differences in actigraphic sleep characteristics for each
quality question using a rank-based nonparametric test of
trend (25). This test allowed for examining whether acti-
graphic sleep characteristics systematically increase or
decrease over the frequencies of insomnia symptoms.
For the "feeling rested" question, we found no significant
relationships to any of the actigraphic outcomes.
For the "trouble falling asleep" question, we expected
associations with latency and perhaps earlier clock time
falling asleep. We did not find a significant relationship with
latency, and the relationship to clock time falling asleep was
weak (p = 0.06) and in the unexpected direction. Instead,
we observed that trouble falling asleep was associated with
increasing sleep period, later wake up time, lower percent
sleep, longer WASO, and more wake bouts.
For the "trouble waking up during the night" question,
we observed significant relationships with longer WASO
and lower percent sleep, as expected. However, we did
not observe a relationship with number of wake bouts. In
addition, we also observed trends in longer total sleep time
and shorter latency with greater trouble waking up during
the night.
For the last question, "trouble waking up too early,"
we would expect earlier clock wake up time and perhaps
shorter total sleep time. There were significant associa-
tions with both earlier clock time falling asleep and ear-
lier wake up time, as well as shorter latency. However,
we did not observe a trend in total sleep time, indicating
that sleep was phase shifted to earlier in the day. Finally,
higher scores on the insomnia symptom scale were related
to longer wake after sleep onset and decreasing percent
sleep as expected, but also with increases in sleep period
and total sleep time.
Adjusted Models of Insomnia Symptoms and
Actigraphic-Estimated Sleep Characteristics
Table 3 summarizes the results from ordered lo
gistic
regression models and OLS regression models using
actigraph-estimated sleep characteristics to predict
older adults' responses to the four survey questions
and the insomnia symptom scale controlling for age,
age squared, gender, race/ethnicity, education, income,
and assets. Adjustment for these characteristics had lit-
tle effect on the associations previously observed in
Table 2. The three survey questions with the most signifi-
cant associations with the actigraph-estimated sleep char-
acteristics were trouble falling asleep, trouble with waking
up during the night, and trouble with waking up too early.
Trouble waking up too early was significantly associated
with earlier wake up time, but also with earlier bedtime
and shorter latency. Reports of waking up during the night
were associated with lower percent sleep, longer WASO,
and longer sleep period and total sleep time. Waking up
too early was associated with earlier clock time falling
asleep and earlier wake up time. Both longer sleep period
and longer WASO were positively correlated with insom-
nia symptom scale. Percent sleep was negatively associ-
ated with the scale. We found no evidence (results not
shown) that the associations between actigraph-estimated
sleep characteristics and insomnia symptoms differed sys-
tematically by gender.
There were a few cases where the proportional odds
assumption did not hold (data not shown). Although Table 3
suggests that there was no association between waking up
too early and sleep duration variables, the partial propor-
tional odds model showed that both sleep period and total
sleep time were associated with waking up too early from
"sometimes" to "most of the time." These results suggest
that sleep duration variables have stronger effects on fre-
quent sleep complaints but not occasional sleep distur-
bances. We also performed sensitivity analyses excluding
participants with fewer than three nights of actigraphy data.
There were 53 individuals with fewer than three nights of
data (44 individuals had 2 nights and 9 one night). Results
were very similar. We also stratified the sample by three age
groups--(a) 62­70, (b) 71­80, (c) 81 above--to examine
if the relationships between self-report insomnia symptoms
and actigraphic measures vary. Although patterns were
similar across age groups, many of the associations of the
second and third age groups were nonsignificant which in
part might due to the relative small sample size of the last
two groups. Finally, we tested the role of cognitive abil-
ity in affecting the reported-actigraphic relationships by
INSOMNIA SYMPTOMS AND ACTIGRAPH-ESTIMATED SLEEP CHARACTERISTICS 189
controlling for scores of cognitive assessment and interac-
tions between cognitive scores and actigraphic measures.
Most of the interaction terms were nonsignificant. Thus,
there was no strong evidence that the observed relationships
between self-report sleep experience and actigraphic meas-
ures varied systematically by cognitive scores.
Discussion
This study compared survey reports of insomnia symp-
toms collected in the context of a general survey to objec-
tively estimated sleep characteristics in a large nationally
representative study population of older adults, focusing
on four survey questions that measure key components of

clinical definitions of insomnia. These questions have also
been included in many general health surveys. Researchers
have found that responses to these questions correlate with
and predict other aspects of health, but there has been rela-
tively little attention paid to their relation to objective meas-
ures of sleep in a nonclinical population.
Although we found significant associations between the
three questions tapping into initiating sleep and maintain-
ing sleep and several actigraphic-estimated sleep character-
istics, some associations were not specific to the aspect of
sleep queried. For example, while reports of trouble falling
asleep would logically be linked to long latency, we did not
find a statistically significant association between the two.
Instead, reported trouble falling asleep significantly corre-
lated with more WASO and an increased number of wake
bouts. These associations suggest that the reports of trouble
falling asleep may also relate to trouble staying asleep dur-
ing the night and a longer sleep period. The finding that
awaking too early was not only associated with earlier wake
time but also earlier clock time falling asleep and shorter
latency similarly suggests that this question may tap into a
circadian phase advance that affects both bedtime and wak-
ing time (26). Older adults may complain of waking up too
early despite accumulating substantial hours of sleep. The
finding that respondents who reported waking up more fre-
quently during the night had more total sleep time is also
unexpected. These associations may be a consequence of
poorer health, as longer sleep duration and poorer sleep
quality may be both markers of illness at older ages (27).
Lastly, feeling rested was not systematically related to
any actigraphic measures. This is consistent with prior stud-
ies suggesting that global ratings of sleep are unlikely to
relate to single physiological sleep measures in a consistent
manner (28). It is also possible that feeling rested corre-
lates with other objective sleep outcomes that are not meas-
ured by actigraphy, such as amount of slow-wave sleep or
absence of sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea.
However, polysomnography studies have reported no cor-
relation between feeling rested and sleep characteristics in
a clinical adult sample (29), which suggests that a ques-
tion about feeling rested may tap into other aspects of older
adults' everyday health or psychological experience. Taken
together, these unexpected findings suggest that answers to
these survey questions are not shaped solely by objective
sleep characteristics. Instead, they may reflect older adults'
subjective evaluation of overall sleep experience as well as
other dimensions of health and wellbeing.
Several large population-based studies of older
adults, including the Established Populations for the
Epidemiological Study of the Elderly and the Health and
Retirement Study, have included these survey questions
about sleep problems, which tap into the definition of insom-
nia. Data from these questions have been used to investigate
hypotheses related to sleep problems and insomnia among
older adults (8,9,19,30­33). Our findings suggest that
reports of what seem like specific sleep problems from sur-
vey questions may be more accurately viewed as indicators
of general problems or dissatisfaction with sleep that may be
due to complex environmental, physiologic, psychological,
and social processes. These survey questions and actigraphy
may measures different domains of sleep experience.
We acknowledge several limitations. First, we only had
three nights of actigraphy data, which may not fully cap-
ture the within-subject variability of sleep behavior in older
adults.Wedidnotaskwhetherthesethreenightsweretypical
of the individual's sleep schedule or quality. However, our
large sample compensates for the greater noise in our data
compared to longer observation periods, and the three-night
observation introduces no systematic bias in our estimates
as population-level sleep characteristics were very similar
based on the full sample and the sample that excluded par-
ticipants with fewer than three nights of data. Second, actig-
raphy provides good estimates but not perfect measures
of sleep. However, there is no perfect measure. Although
polysomnography is often consider as the gold standard in
sleep research, it has a very limited role in the current clini-
cal practice and evaluation of patients with insomnia (34).
Furthermore, it may interrupt normal sleep behaviors and
thus overestimate the sleep problems of insomnia patients.
Several clinical studies comparing sleep estimates from
actigraphy and polymnography suggested that actigraphy
may modestly overestimate insomnia patients' sleep time
and underestimate wake time by scoring motionless peri-
ods in bed as sleep (35­37). Accordingly, actigraphy may
underestimate the differences in sleep duration, percent
sleep, WASO, wake bouts, and latency among older adults
with and without insomnia. However, this would give us
conservative estimates of the correlations between insom-
nia report and actigraphic measures, and yet we found many
significant associations. Third, we cannot exclude the pos-
sibility that the absence of association between latency and
trouble falling asleep could be due to imprecisely pushing
the event marker. However, the mean latency (e.g., 29 min)
in our sample was not substantially different from other stud-
ies (38). Fourth, there is no specific timeframe for insomnia
questions. For clinical diagnosis of insomnia, symptoms
must persist for 6 months. As such, these questions are best
viewed as screening tools for insomnia symptoms for the
general population of older adults rather than diagnostic. It
is also possible that the limitation in survey questions led
to weaker correlations between self-report and actigraphic
sleep measures than expected. Fifth, the Sleep Booklet did
not ask questions about diagnosis of sleep apnea. As such,
we were not able to adjust it in our analysis. However, we
performed a sensitivity analysis by stratifying the sample
into a "higher-risk apnea" group (rarely or never, N = 81)
and a "lower-risk apnea" group (most of the time and some-
times, N = 646) based on answers of the feeling rested ques-
tion and comparing the reported-actigraphic relationship in
these two groups. As individuals with apnea would be very
INSOMNIA SYMPTOMS AND ACTIGRAPH-ESTIMATED SLEEP CHARACTERISTICS 191
likely to answer "rarely" or "never" to this question, this
sensitivity can provide additional insights on the potential
influence of sleep apnea on the reported-actigraphic rela-
tionship. Our results from these two groups were similar
although many of the coefficients from the "higher-risk
apnea" group were nonsignificant because of the very small
sample size of the "higher-risk apnea" group. Thus, results
from this sensitive analysis offer some suggestive evidence
that sleep apnea may not be an influential factor in shaping
reported-actigraphic relationship. Finally, individuals may
answer these survey questions differently than they might
answer similar questions in a clinical encounter.
In sum, our findings suggest that three of four insomnia
symptom reports correlated with estimates of sleep charac-
teristics of older adults based on actigraphic measures but
often not to the objective features that seemed to be indexed
by these questions. We conclude that insomnia symptom
reports among older adults may act as more general indica-
tors of sleep satisfaction that tap into various dimensions of
sleep and perhaps also other aspects of health.
