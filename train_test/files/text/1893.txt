Background: We assessed response rates and compliance for a
printed questionnaire and a Web questionnaire in a Swedish popu-
lation-based study and explored the influence of adding personalized
feedback to the Web questionnaire.
Methods: We assigned 875 subjects to 1 of 3 groups: printed
questionnaire, plain Web questionnaire, or Web questionnaire with
personalized feedback. The questionnaire had 2 parts, first a general
section and then a dietary section.
Results: The response rate for the general section was 64% for the
printed questionnaire, compared with 50% for the Web question-
naire with feedback. For the dietary questionnaire, the rates were
reversed, resulting in a total response rate for the dietary question-
naire that did not differ between printed and web questionnaire with
feedback.
Conclusions: Interactivity in the Web questionnaire increased com-
pliance in completion of the second section of the questionnaire.
Web questionnaires can be useful for research purposes in settings in
which Internet access is high.

The Internet is an unexploited resource for collecting
self-reported information in epidemiologic studies. Web-
based questionnaires are easy to administer and offer several
advantages, including immediate checks for incomplete or
implausible answers, reminder messages to the respondent,
automatic summarization of answers, personalized feedback,
inclusion of illustrations or sounds to clarify complex ques-
tions, and hiding nonrelevant follow-up questions. Web ques-
tionnaires require no expense for printing, postage, manual
check of incomplete answers, and transfer of data to an
electronic format. The major cost for Web questionnaires is
development of the system for handling the questionnaires;
thus, once the system is established, the extra cost to add a
few thousand or even a few hundred thousand participants to
the study is relatively small.
However, access to the Internet can be biased with
regard to age, sex, and education, among other factors. This
differential access has restricted the use of Web-based meth-
ods to studies in specific groups with access to Internet, such
as university students,1 employees at certain companies,2 or
known Internet users.3,4 Also, substantial proportion of the
general population is unfamiliar with Web questionnaires and
might hesitate to answer a Web questionnaire due to lack of
experience or worries about security issues. However, these
obstacles are likely to diminish over time. We explored
response rates and compliance in a population-based study in
Sweden, in which Internet access is estimated to be 80% in
the working population.
METHODS
Study Population and Design
The study base comprised all persons 20 to 59 years of
age living in a middle-sized county in Sweden in 2002. The
county has the same distribution of inhabitants living in city
(80%) and rural areas (20%) as the average in Sweden. We
randomly selected 875 eligible persons from the Swedish
Population Registry. Participation required filling out a ques-
tionnaire and undergoing several 24-hour recall interviews
about physical activity. There were 3 versions of the ques-
tionnaire: (1) traditional printed questionnaire, (2) regular
Web questionnaire, and (3) interactive Web questionnaire
with personalized feedback.
The eligible sample was assigned randomly at the
outset to one of the 3 versions of the questionnaires. All were
sent an invitation letter informing them about the study. After
2 weeks, one third of the group was sent a printed question-
naire and two thirds were sent a letter with information on
how to access the Web questionnaire, including details on use
of the Web browser, the URL to our Web questionnaire, and
an individual username. In addition, half of the Web group
(one third of the total) was given the option of personalized
feedback about their energy expenditure and body mass
index. All nonrespondents were reminded after 3 weeks by a
letter and contacted by phone after an additional 3 weeks, if
necessary.
The questionnaire was divided into 2 parts. The first
part was a general survey of lifestyle factors, such as physical
activity, weight, height, smoking, and education, as well as
the respondent's Internet habits. On the last page of this
section, respondents were asked if they would be willing to
answer additional questions about diet. Web respondents
answering "yes" were linked to the second part of the ques-
tionnaire, whereas respondents to the printed questionnaire
were sent the dietary questionnaire by returning mail. Per-
sonalized feedback was given to the interactive group on their
intake of fiber, calcium, vitamin C, iron, and the composition
of lunch and dinner meals. All basic questionnaires were
followed by a validation study on physical activity.

The ethical committee at the Karolinska Institutet ap-
proved the study. Answering the questionnaire was consid-
ered to be informed consent.
Technical Aspects of the Web Questionnaire
We collaborated with a commercial Swedish Web sur-
vey company (Netsurvey2), which developed software to
meet our requirements with respect to layout, feedback, and
interactivity. An individual username for login provided the
same identification in the Web questionnaires as in the
printed questionnaires. This username prevented multiple
answers from the same respondent or answers from individ-
uals other than the invited respondents and allowed us to
direct reminders to the nonrespondents only. The respondent
used the username to establish an encrypted connection,
using Secure Socket Layer, with the Web questionnaire
system at Netsurvey. The username was linked to a unique
number that identified the person and the study. The ques-
tionnaire answers were stored at Netsurvey along with the
unique identification number.
To minimize typing errors by the respondent, the sys-
tem immediately checked for implausible answers (eg. letters
instead of numbers, unrealistic weight or height, or missing
answers). When the system discovered an error, the respon-
dent was given the chance to change the answer before
moving on to the next page.
RESULTS
Among the subjects given the printed questionnaire, the
response rate for the general section was 64% (Table 1).
Response rates for the groups using Web-based question-
naires were 51% for the questionnaire without feedback and
50% with feedback. Additional details regarding response
rates can be found in a supplementary table, available with
the electronic version of this article.
Compliance (willingness to answer the second part of
the questionnaire) was higher for the Web questionnaires than
for the printed questionnaire. Fifty-three percent of those who
completed the general section of the paper questionnaire went
on to complete the dietary part, compared with 58% of those
responding to the Web questionnaire and 64% of those who
were given the interactive Web questionnaire. Thus, the total
response rate for the dietary questionnaire was similar for the
3 groups (34%, 29 and 32% respectively).
There were no differences in response to the 3 ques-
tionnaire options by age, body mass index, and current
smoking, and only small differences by sex, education, and
food habits (Table 2). The self-reported time spent answering
the questionnaires did not differ between the groups. In
general, those responding to the Web questionnaires were
also more frequent users of the Internet and more able to
arrange for privacy when using the Internet, assuring that no
one was watching the screen.
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first popula-
tion-based study comparing the use of Web questionnaires
with a similar printed questionnaire. Half of the people
invited to use the Web questionnaire completed the general
section of questionnaire. The willingness to answer a second
part of the questionnaire was higher with the Web question-
naire than with the printed questionnaire, which suggests that
those that responding to the Web questionnaire found the
process more appealing than those who responded to the
mailed questionnaire.
Web questionnaires can be used for research purposes
in population-based settings in which Internet access is high,
although we found that the initial response rate was lower
than for the traditional printed questionnaire. In comparison,
the willingness to answer a second questionnaire was higher

naires. However, food records are considered unsuitable for large
studies due to the need to train participants and to review and correct
completed records.
Methods: We evaluated a self-administered 3-day food record
protocol in Washington State. One hundred men and women age
50­76 years were mailed a food record and serving-size booklet.
Sixty-five people returned a completed food record and were sub-
sequently interviewed to obtain missing information. The food
records were analyzed with and without added information from the
interview.
Results: The most common error was incomplete description, which
affected 8% of recorded foods. Differences in mean nutrient intake
between the uncorrected and corrected records were within 5%, and
nutrient estimates from the 2 methods were highly correlated.
Conclusions: This streamlined protocol yielded data comparable to
those collected by more burdensome protocols, suggesting that the
use of food records may be feasible in large cohort studies.

Many scientists have questioned the adequacy of using
food-frequency questionnaires (FFQs) for assessing
diet in epidemiologic studies.1­4 Studies using doubly labeled
water and other biomarkers suggest that diet records are more
valid than FFQs and that the error associated with FFQs is
greater than previously estimated.5­9 However, food records
have generally been considered unsuitable for use in large
epidemiologic studies because of the need for in-person
training and for review and correction of completed records,
as well as their prohibitive costs.10­12 Despite these limita-
tions, 2 large cohort studies in Europe13,14 recently used food
records; 1 of these14 reported stronger associations of diet
with disease outcomes using food records compared with
FFQs. These results motivate the development of methods for
collecting food records that are feasible for large epidemio-
logic studies.
This article evaluates an innovative, mailed protocol for
collecting 3-day food records using a booklet specially de-
signed to reduce the need for in-person training and post-
completion review by a nutritionist. We assessed both the
completeness of the self-administered dietary record and the
precision of nutrient intake measures by comparing the un-
corrected records (analyzed as received) to records "cor-
rected" by nutritionist interview.
METHODS
This pilot study was conducted among a random sam-
ple of 100 men and women in the VITamins And Lifestyle
(VITAL) cohort study of western Washington State.15 A food
record, detailed instructions, and return envelope were mailed
to study participants. This mailing was followed by a re-
minder postcard to all participants and a telephone call to
nonresponders.
The 3-day food record booklet was designed to be
entirely self-administered. It contained instructions for re-
cording food intake (including how to describe food prepa-
ration methods, added fats, brand names, and ingredients of
mixed dishes and recipes), as well as an example of a
correctly completed day's record. The booklet also contained
12 questions on food-use patterns to collect information
typically obtained during review of completed food records;
these responses were used to assign default values when food
records were incomplete. Participants also received a 12-page
serving-size booklet containing photographs and other mea-
surement tools to facilitate accurate quantification of foods
and beverages consumed. Both instruments can be viewed at
http://ffq.fhcrc.org.
Trained staff entered food records into the Nutrition
Data System for Research (NDS-R) software (version 4.04,
Food and Nutrient Database 32)16,17 using a set of rules to
standardize entry of foods with incomplete information.
Records were additionally coded for the numbers of foods
that were missing the following types of required informa-
tion: serving size, food description, preparation method, and
mixed food or recipe ingredients. Within 1 week of receiving
completed food records, a nutritionist telephoned respondents
to obtain missing and incomplete information. These cor-
rected records were then entered into NDS-R by staff who
was unaware of decisions made during analysis of the uncor-
rected records.
Error rates (defined as the number of omissions divided
by the number of foods subject to that omission) were
calculated for each type of missing information for each day's
intake. To test whether error rates differed by participant
characteristics, we used linear regression models with daily
error rates (as response variables) weighted for the number of
foods in each category of error. To assess the impact of
recording errors on nutrient estimates, we calculated bias as
the mean difference between uncorrected and corrected
records, and we computed precision as Pearson's correlation
coefficient. We used intraclass correlations among 3 days of
food records to compare day-to-day variation in nutrient
intake between the uncorrected and corrected records. Nutri-
ents with skewed distributions were log-transformed before
analyses.
RESULTS
Sixty-eight participants (68%) returned a completed
food record; 53% responded to the initial mailing and post-
card, and an additional 15% returned a completed food record
after the telephone reminder. We were unable to reach 3

participants for review of their food record; therefore, this
report is limited to the 65 participants with complete data.
Participants were similar to the VITAL study cohort with
regard to most demographic characteristics: approximately
half were women, more than 95% were white, 85% had some
college education, half were overweight or obese, and 6%
were current smokers.
Table 1 gives data on the omissions and error rates in
the self-administered 3-day food records. Participants re-
ported consuming an average of 17.6 foods per day, of which
3% were missing portion sizes and 8% were incompletely
described. Participants recorded an average of 2 foods per
day that required information on how the food was prepared,
but almost half of these lacked adequate details. An average
of only 1 recipe (or mixed food) was consumed per day, and
almost 40% were inadequately specified. There were no
significant differences in these error rates by age, sex, edu-
cation, or body mass index (BMI), but there was a trend
toward fewer incomplete recipes with increasing education
and more missing portion sizes with increasing BMI.
Table 2 gives comparisons of uncorrected to corrected
food records. Differences in mean nutrient intake between the
uncorrected and corrected records were small. The uncor-
rected records overestimated fat intake by 4 g (5.5%) and
percent energy from fat by 1 percentage point (3.6%). The
uncorrected records underestimated vitamin C by approxi-
mately 4 mg (4.8%) and calcium by 42 mg (5.4%). Correla-
tion coefficients between nutrients estimated from the uncor-
rected and corrected records were very high, ranging from
0.87 to 1.00.
Intraclass correlations among the 3 days of records
ranged from 0.30 to 0.77 (for -carotene and alcohol, respec-
tively) in the uncorrected food records and from 0.24 to 0.78 in
the corrected records. The largest discrepancies were 0.47 versus
0.58 for percent energy from carbohydrate and 0.51 versus 0.59
for fat (g) for the uncorrected and corrected food records,
respectively. There were no other substantial differences in
the day-to-day nutrient variation between the 2 food record
methods (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
This pilot study found reasonable data quality us-
ing self-administered food records. Comparing uncorrected
records with corrected records, mean intake of nutrients
differed by less than 6%, correlations were uniformly high,
and within-person day-to-day variability in intake of most
nutrients was very similar. Based on these findings, we
conclude that food records analyzed without subsequent aug-
mentation by participant interview could be a methodologi-
cally and scientifically viable option in cohort studies exam-
ining diet and chronic disease risk.
We anticipated that respondents would omit details
regarding food descriptions, portion sizes, and preparation
methods. The food record and serving size booklets were
therefore carefully designed to instruct and prompt partici-
pants to record complete information. Differences in mean
nutrient intake between uncorrected and corrected records
were modest and correlations comparing nutrients from the 2
methods were high. However, our study design did not allow
evaluation of whether modifications to the food record book-
let decreased respondent error, and further research is needed
to address this question.
The use of food records in large-scale cohort studies is
often dismissed because of the expense for analysis of these
records for the entire cohort. However, if a food record
protocol does not require in-person instruction and review, a
case­cohort or nested case­control design could be used and
only records from a small subset of the cohort (ie, cases and
controls) would need analysis. Our results suggest that high-
quality food record data can be collected without record
review, such that completed food records could be stored for
many years and analyzed only as needed.
There are several limitations inherent in the design of
this pilot study. As is true of all cohort studies, participants in
the VITAL cohort and this pilot study were a volunteer
sample characterized by their willingness to complete an
extensive questionnaire. The response rate was 68%; al-
though low response rates decrease study power, it is unlikely
to introduce selection bias, because participation in a cohort
study is generally not jointly affected by exposure and future
(unknown) disease incidence. The sample size of this pilot
study was small and could not test whether food record
quality differed by demographic characteristics. Participants
kept food records on 3 consecutive days, beginning on their
day of choice, and 42% of records included at least 1
weekend day. Although some studies report that diets differ
by day of the week,18 it is not clear that this would affect
comparisons of uncorrected to corrected records. Lastly, this
study examined only 1 source of measurement error: elimi-
nating in-person instruction and post-record review of com-
pleted food records. We did not examine errors due to having
only 3 days of records, behavior change due to record
keeping, or other potential inaccuracies in recording food
intake.
In conclusion, this pilot study demonstrated that a
self-administered protocol for collecting food records has
potential for use in large cohort studies. By using a stream-
lined protocol and a modified version of a food record
booklet, in-person training and review of food records was
not essential to collect high-quality food record data. This
method of collecting food records should be further improved
and evaluated, and its use in cohort studies is needed to
evaluate whether food records are superior to FFQs in studies
of diet and disease risk.

risk of reproductive tract abnormalities in their offspring. Dutch
investigators have reported a 20-fold increase in risk of hypospadias
among sons of women who were exposed to DES in utero. We
assessed this relation in data from an ongoing study of DES-exposed
persons.
Methods: Several U.S. cohorts of women with documented expo-
sure in utero to DES have been followed by mailed questionnaires
since the 1970s. Comparison subjects are unexposed women of the
same ages. In 1997, participants were asked about congenital ab-
normalities in their children. We calculated prevalence odds ratios
for the risk of hypospadias in sons of exposed mothers relative to
sons of unexposed mothers using generalized estimating equations
to adjust for multiple sons per mother and controlling for maternal
age at the son's birth.
Results: We obtained data from 3916 exposed and 1746 unexposed
women. These women reported a total of 13 liveborn sons with
hypospadias (10 exposed, 3 unexposed). The prevalence odds ratio
for risk of hypospadias among the exposed was 1.7 (95% confidence
interval  0.4­6.8).
Conclusions: Our findings do not support a greatly increased risk of
hypospadias among the sons of women exposed to DES in utero, as
has been previously reported.

Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a synthetic estrogen that was
commonly prescribed during the 1950s and 1960s to
women with high-risk pregnancies and to many women with
normal pregnancies.1 The daughters of women who took DES
while pregnant have an increased prevalence of reproductive
tract abnormalities leading to spontaneous abortion and in-
fertility and a sharply increased incidence of clear cell ade-
nocarcinoma of the vagina and cervix.2­4 Data on the sons are
less definitive, but there have been reports of an increased
prevalence of epididymal cysts, hypotrophic testes, and tes-
ticular varicoceles.5­7
Animal studies suggest that DES may increase suscep-
tibility to reproductive tract tumors in subsequent genera-
tions.8­11 One possible mechanism involves genetic or epi-
genetic changes in the germ cells that are transmitted to future
generations. Alternatively, there may be somatic cell changes
that affect uteroplacental function in the DES-exposed daugh-
ter. There are almost no data on third-generation effects of
DES in humans. Kaufman and Adam12 examined 28 daugh-
ters of women with DES exposure in utero and found no
occurrences of the reproductive tract abnormalities that are
relatively common in second-generation exposed. However,
in a recent study of Dutch women with fertility problems,13
the prevalence of hypospadias was more than 20 times greater
among sons born to women exposed prenatally to DES than
among sons of unexposed women.
Hypospadias is a relatively common birth defect in
which the urethral opening is located on the ventral surface of
the penis or on the scrotum.14,15 Most cases require surgical
correction. The causes of hypospadias are unknown, but it
may be related to levels of sex hormones during the period of
penile and urethral development (weeks 8­14 of gesta-
tion).16­18
The Dutch study provides the first epidemiologic data
suggesting a third-generation effect of DES exposure in
humans. The current analysis was untaken to assess whether
those results could be confirmed in data from an ongoing
DES follow-up study in the United State.
METHODS
A collaborative follow-up study of women with prena-
tal exposure to DES and unexposed women of the same ages
has been in progress since 1992.19 The cohort was assembled
from several existing cohorts: (1) women exposed to DES
who, in the late 1970s, enrolled in the National Cooperative
Diethylstilbestrol Adenosis Project, their unexposed sisters,
and age-matched unexposed women chosen from the same
hospital birth record sources as the exposed20; (2) DES-
exposed and unexposed daughters of women who partici-
pated in a randomized clinical trial of DES at the University
of Chicago in 1951­195221; (3) women exposed to DES and
their unexposed siblings born to women treated for infertility
in a private Boston-area infertility practice19; and (4) DES-
exposed and unexposed daughters of women who previously
participated in a large study of DES health effects in the
mothers.22 In each cohort, unexposed participants were
drawn from the same sources as exposed participants and
were similar with respect to year of birth and socioeconomic
status. In 1992, the National Cancer Institute sponsored an
effort to combine the existing cohorts, trace the women
originally identified as eligible, and follow participants with
mailed questionnaires. One percent each of the exposed and
unexposed groups had died; 18% of exposed and 16% of
unexposed were lost to follow-up, which left 81% of exposed
and 83% of unexposed who were successfully located and
have been followed with mailed questionnaires through 1997.
We used the 1997 questionnaire data on liveborn chil-
dren to determine the denominator of liveborn sons. Women
were asked an open-ended question, "Were any of your
children born with congenital abnormalities?" Participants
were asked to record the date of birth and an explanation of

the abnormality. Coding of responses was conducted without
knowledge of exposure status.
Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
for the association of DES exposure with prevalence of
hypospadias were calculated using generalized estimating
equations to account for multiple sons per mother.23 All
models controlled for maternal age at birth (30, 30­34,
35 years), which was associated with an increased risk of
hypospadias. Maternal smoking, years of education, and
history of abortion in the grandmother were not materially
associated with risk of hypospadias and were not included in
the final models.
RESULTS
There were 2522 liveborn sons among women exposed
to DES and 1336 liveborn sons among women who were not
exposed. Women in the exposed cohort reported 10 sons with
hypospadias (2 from the same mother), for a prevalence of
4.0 cases per 1000 male births. Women in the unexposed
cohort reported 3 sons with hypospadias, for a prevalence of
2.2 cases per 1000 male births. The OR for hypospadias for
sons of exposed women relative to sons of unexposed women
was 1.7 (95% CI  0.4­6.8). The association was similar
whether the prenatal exposure to DES began in the first
trimester of pregnancy (1.7; 0.3­8.8) or later in pregnancy
(1.9; 0.4­9.9).
We repeated our analyses among women with fertility
problems (those who reported having tried to become preg-
nant for 12 months or more without success and who con-
sulted a physician for that reason) and among all other
women. Among women with no history of fertility problems,
DES exposure was not associated with hypospadias (1.1;
0.2­4.9). Among those who reported fertility problems, it
was not possible to compute an OR because there were no
cases among the 145 unexposed women. The lower bound of
a 95% CI for that estimate was 0.2, indicating statistical
compatibility with no association. The prevalence of hypos-
padias among sons born to DES-exposed women with a
history of infertility was 8.5/1000 male births (CI  2.8/
1000­20/1000).
DISCUSSION
Our study does not confirm the previous report of a
20-fold increase in risk of hypospadias among sons of mother
exposed to DES in utero.1 The overall prevalence OR in our
study was only 1.7, with an upper 95% CI of 6.6. Results
were based on similar numbers of cases (12 in the Dutch
study and 13 in ours), although our study had more exposed
mothers and somewhat greater statistical power (2522 ex-
posed and 1336 unexposed sons, compared with 205 exposed
and 8729 unexposed sons in the Dutch study).
The prevalence of hypospadias among liveborn males
in the United States is estimated to be 2 to 6 cases per
1000.14,15 The prevalences observed in both our exposed and
unexposed cohorts fall within that range. However, compar-
isons with published rates are problematic because the pub-
lished rates are presumably based on a more complete ascer-
tainment of cases.
One major difference between the present study and the
Dutch study is the composition of the cohorts. The Dutch
study was conducted within a cohort of subfertile women,13
raising the possibility that the findings were influenced by
factors related to infertility that could not be controlled. All
mothers had been unable to conceive after 1 year or more of
frequent unprotected intercourse and had sought medical care
at infertility centers. Approximately half had undergone in
vitro fertilization. By contrast, in the present study only
approximately 20% of women reported difficulty becoming
pregnant. When we confined the analysis to women who
reported seeing a doctor for infertility, that is, a cohort similar
to the Dutch cohort, we observed a higher prevalence of
hypospadias in the sons of women exposed to DES (5/590)
than in sons of unexposed women (0/145), although these
risks are far too imprecise to establish whether they are
different.
A perhaps more important difference between the 2
studies is related to the quality of data on exposure. It is
well-established that reporting of maternal DES use is
poor.24,25 In our study, DES exposure status had been con-
firmed by medical record review before any outcomes oc-
curred. Thus, misclassification of exposure was unlikely and
could not have been differential due to outcome status. In the
Dutch study,13 information on DES exposure was obtained
after the occurrence of hypospadias. Participants who gave
birth to a son with hypospadias may have been more likely to
learn of or recall being told of their DES exposure. It is likely
that there was considerable underreporting of DES exposure
by the women who delivered healthy babies.
The small excess risk of hypospadias in our own study
could be due to differential reporting of hypospadias. As in
the Dutch study, we relied on the mother's report of hypos-
padias in response to a single open-ended question about
giving birth to a child with a congenital abnormality. We did
not obtain confirmation by medical record. DES-exposed
women may have been more complete than unexposed
women in their reporting of hypospadias malformations,
although there was not an increased prevalence of other
congenital malformations. Thus, although the small increase
in risk among sons of exposed women may be due simply to
statistical imprecision, we cannot exclude the possibility of
some bias.
In summary, the present results from a large U.S.
cohort of DES-exposed and unexposed women provide no
support for a recent report13 that maternal in utero exposure
to DES greatly increases risk of giving birth to a son with
hypospadias.

Smoking and Helicobacter pylori
Infection in a Sample
of U.S. Adults
Victor M. Cardenas* and David Y. Graham
Background: Although the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori in-
fection has been assessed in the National Health and Nutritional
Examination Survey (NHANES), its possible relation with smoking
has not been fully explored.
Methods: We used the 1999­2000 NHANES data to examine
whether smoking affects the prevalence of H. pylori infection in
adults (n  3689). The prevalence of H. pylori infection, as assessed
by anti-H. pylori IgG enzyme-linked immunoassay, was computed
according to smoking history and levels of serum cotinine.
Results: Current smoking was associated with an increased preva-
lence of H. pylori infection (prevalence odds ratio 1.9; 95%
confidence interval  1.4­2.5) after controlling for possible con-
founders. Current smoking, as measured by increased serum cotin-
ine, was also associated with an increased prevalence of H. pylori
infection (1.6; 1.3­2.0). There was no evidence of a dose­response
relation.
Conclusions: Smoking may contribute to the persistence of H.
pylori infection.

Smoking and Helicobacter pylori infection are independent
risk factors for peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer.1­4
Six of 9 published studies that have looked into the relation
of smoking with H. pylori infection have found evidence
consistent with a weak positive association.5­14 For example,
a previous study11 based on the Third National Health and
Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) data reported no
association overall, but a dose­response relation between
pack-years of smoking and H. pylori infection was found
among blacks. We report a cross-sectional analysis of the
current NHANES (1999­2000) that examined the relation
between H. pylori infection and smoking as measured both
through standard questionnaire and in relation to serum co-
tinine levels.
METHODS
We used the 1999­2000 NHANES data, for which
details on survey design and methods are presented else-
where.15 Briefly, NHANES provides estimates of health con-
ditions in the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population.

H. pylori infection was assessed with a commercially avail-
able immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA). As determined by a previous validation study,
those with an immune status ratio 0.9 were considered
infected.16 In our analysis of serum cotinine levels, we used
a cotinine above 15 ng/mL to define current smoking.17 Using
serum cotinine as the gold standard, the smoking question-
naire data had a sensitivity of 96% (95% confidence interval
CI  94­97%) and a specificity of 97% (96­98%) for
classifying current cigarette smoking. Only 2.5% of persons
who reported that they were former smokers had cotinine
15 ng/mL.
We excluded from the analyses records from persons
younger than 20 years of age (5085 of 9965, or 49%) and also
records with missing data on the study variables (1191 of
4880, or 24%), leaving 3689 complete observations in the
analytic dataset. Data were analyzed taking into consideration
the complex survey design using SUDAAN (version 8.1;
Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC).
Using the 2000 Census as the standard population, we ob-
tained the age-standardized prevalence of H. pylori infection
in our study population and in NHANES III11 using variance
estimators described elsewhere.18 We then computed the
distribution of H. pylori infection according to the following
smoking variables: current, former, and never cigarette smok-
ers; number of cigarettes smoked; duration in years; pack-
years; and cotinine levels as a dichotomous variable (15
ng/mL) and as tertiles of the distribution of those at or above
that cutoff.
RESULTS
The 2000 U.S. Census age-standardized prevalence of
H. pylori infection in our study population was 32% (standard
error SE  1.4%), slightly lower than in NHANES III
(age-standardized  34%, SE  1.5%) The age-standardized
prevalence ratio H. pylori infection in NHANES III relative
to current NHANES was 1.1 (95% CI  1.0­1.2).
In NHANES III, all participants were found to have
detectable levels of cotinine,17 whereas 35% of participants in
the 1999­2000 NHANES had no detectable levels of cotin-
ine.19 In our study, persons infected with H. pylori had a
median serum cotinine of 0.11 ng/mL compared with 0.08 for
those uninfected. Among H. pylori infected participants, the
75th percentile of the distribution of cotinine was 19.5 ng/
mL, compared with 2.07 ng/mL among those uninfected.
Results of our analyses for each potential confounder
and H. pylori are shown in Table 1. The prevalence of H.
pylori infection increased with age, among persons of ethnic/
racial groups other than non-Hispanic whites, and among
foreign-born participants. There was an inverse relationship
of infection prevalence with education, vitamin C intake, and
alcohol intake.
As shown in Table 2, current smokers had an increased
prevalence of H. pylori infection compared with never-smok-
ers, with the prevalence among former smokers intermediate
between the levels of current and never-smokers. After we
controlled for several variables, current and former cigarette
smokers had a higher prevalence of H. pylori infection
(prevalence odds ratio POR  1.9 and 1.3, respectively)
compared with never-smokers. Analyses restricted to U.S.-
born non-Hispanic whites (n  1629) resulted in virtually the
same point estimates: POR  2.0 for current and POR  1.4
for former cigarette smokers.
Table 2 also displays results for several other smok-
ing variables. We did not find evidence of a dose­response
relation between the prevalence of H. pylori infection and
the number of cigarettes smoked, years of smoking, time
since quitting smoking, pack-years of cigarette smoking,
or tertiles of the distribution of serum cotinine. We found
that the prevalence of H. pylori infection was not higher
among those individuals grouped in the categories of
heavier tobacco use compared with those in intermediate
categories.
Study participants who had levels of serum cotinine
compatible with current smoking status had an increased
prevalence of infection (1.6; 1.3­2.0) compared with those
classified as nonsmokers, controlling for all relevant mea-
sured covariates.
DISCUSSION
We report an association between smoking and H.
pylori infection in a national sample of the U.S. adult popu-
lation using both questionnaire data and serum cotinine. Our
study is subject to several limitations. First, antibody against
H. pylori identifies both active and past infections such that
not all persons with antibody had current infection. Second,
because of the cross-sectional nature of the study, we could
not identify changes in infection status over time. Longitudi-
nal studies in children and in adults show a loss of the
infection over time.20,21 The mechanism of loss of infection
remains unclear, with one possibility being a bystander effect
of the use of antibiotics for other indications. Information on
H. pylori treatment was not collected in current NHANES.
The 2 general ways by which the pool of H. pylori-
infected and ever-smoking individuals can be enriched are
through the presence of an increased susceptibility or expo-
sure (higher rates of acquisition) or by decreased loss of the
infection over time. Most H. pylori infections are acquired in
childhood, and so the risk of acquiring infection is therefore
unlikely to be affected by smoking status itself. However,
smoking status might reflect socioeconomic status (SES), a
variable known to relate to H. pylori prevalence. Data against

The prevalence of H. pylori is related to the SES of
their families during the time they were children.22 Thus,
current smoking may also reflect a lower SES in childhood.
We performed a sensitivity analysis of confounding by child-
hood SES (ie, externally adjusted23) using prevalence esti-
mates of regular smoking by type of father's job (ie, manual
and nonmanual)24 and of the association between low child-
hood SES and H. pylori infection.22 Even if we reduce our
estimate of the association between smoking and H. pylori by
30% to 40% (as suggested by the sensitivity analysis), smok-
ers still had an excess prevalence of H. pylori infection.
However, SES at early ages strongly predicts SES at later
ages; adjustment by education should have removed most
confounding by childhood SES.25
Conflicting results of this and prior studies may reflect
different criterion validity, and considerable variation in both
the prevalence of H. pylori infection (21­66%) and current
smoking (20­40%) across study populations.5­14 We found

correlation between strength of the association and preva-
lence of smoking or infection across those studies. However,
never-smokers in NHANES III had a 6% higher prevalence
of H. pylori infection than in our study population, which
might explain the difference. We did not find a dose­response
association between H. pylori with amount or duration of
cigarette smoking. This may be because a dose­response
relation is nonlinear, because the effect is dose-independent,
or because there is no causal connection at all.
The association is biologically plausible; smokers also
differ physiologically from nonsmokers in ways that might
affect prevalence of infection. At least one study has shown
an increased inflammatory reaction to H. pylori infection
among smokers.26 In addition, smokers have increased gas-

tric acid secretion, and smoking also inhibits both duodenal
and pancreatic bicarbonate secretion, which increases the
likelihood of developing duodenal ulcer disease.27 Smokers
could have an excess of persistent H. pylori infections due to
the adverse effects of smoking on the immune system.28
However, we hypothesize that because H. pylori infections
within a given population are decreasing over time, the
increased prevalence of H. pylori infection among smokers
may reflect the effect of smoking on enhancing persistence of
the infection.29 For example, antibiotic therapy with single,
dual, or triple drug therapy is markedly less effective among
smokers than nonsmokers30 such that on average, smokers
would be less likely to have bystander eradication than
nonsmokers.
Complete data from current NHANES, including data
on cagA testing, are not yet available; additional analysis,
including parallel analysis of NHANES III data, would be of
interest. Further studies are warranted to examine the effect
of smoking on acquiring infection, as well as on persistence
of H. pylori infection.
