Sibling and twin study designs provide control for confounding factors that are typically unmeasured in traditional
cohort studies. Using nationally representative data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
collected at 3 visits during 1994­2002, the authors evaluated the longitudinal association between birth weight and
later obesity in a traditional cohort study (n ¼ 13,763; ages 11­21 years at baseline), controlling for sex, age, race/
ethnicity, and parental education. Among persons with a nonobese mother, high birth weight (>4 kg) participants
were more likely than normal birth weight (!2.5­ 4 kg) participants to become obese later in life (incidence rate
ratio ¼ 1.46, 95% confidence interval: 1.28, 1.67). In a matched sibling pair sample (full siblings: n ¼ 513; mono-
zygotic twins: n ¼ 207; dizygotic twins: n ¼ 189), the authors examined longitudinal within-pair differences. Birth
weight difference was positively associated with body mass index difference later in life for female monozygotic
pairs only (b ¼ 2.67, 95% confidence interval: 0.99, 4.35). Given the null associations observed in the sibling
sample, the commonly observed positive association between birth weight and later obesity from cohort analyses
may be attributed to confounding by maternal characteristics. Further research is needed to identify specific factors
that contribute to the birth weight­obesity relation.

Obesity, a complex, multifactorial disease with genetic and
environmental etiology (1, 2), continues to be a major and
global public health concern. Early-life factors such as in-
trauterine growth may contribute to the development of obe-
sity (3, 4). Birth weight, an indicator of intrauterine growth, is
associated with childhood and adult obesity (5­14). Investi-
gators in most cohort studies report a positive association,
while others observe U-shaped or null associations (7­15).
Environmental and genetic factors may underlie the asso-
ciation between birth weight and size later in life (16). One
hypothesis suggests that persons who experience an adverse
intrauterine environment may metabolically and physiologi-
cally adapt to enhance survival early in life (17, 18); however,
these adaptations may increase risk of later obesity in an
obesogenic postnatal environment. In addition, intrauterine
exposure to excess glucose via gestational diabetes and/or
overnutrition may increase fetal insulin production and
change pancreatic and brain development, resulting in in-
creased birth size and altered postnatal body composition
(19­22). Alternatively, a common genotype may influence
both birth weight and later obesity (23). The complex inde-
pendent and joint influences of intrauterine environmental
and genetic factors on later size remain poorly understood.
Sibling and twin study designs offer a unique opportunity
to better understand the relation between birth weight and
obesity, since they provide control for environmental and
genetic factors that are typically unmeasured in traditional
cohort studies (16, 24­28). In general, full siblings share
genetic and maternal environments, in contrast to unrelated
persons in cohort studies (16, 24­28). Additionally, twins
have identical gestational ages and equally share certain
maternal exposures (e.g., maternal age or socioeconomic
status). Further, monozygotic twins are genetically identical
(16, 24­28). Thus, differences in birth weight within sibling
549 Am J Epidemiol 2010;172:549­557
and twin pairs are not likely to be due to these shared in-
fluences, but rather to factors influencing the growth of each
individual (26). Comparisons within full-sibling and twin
pairs can shed light on genetic and environmental influences
of the association between birth weight and later size. Find-
ings from twin studies are inconsistent and dominated by
data from Caucasian populations (5, 6, 29­34). Thus, there
is a great need for additional studies that provide findings in
a racially/ethnically diverse sample.
Using longitudinal, nationally representative, prospective
data enriched with sibling and twin pairs, we examined: 1)
in the full cohort, the association between birth weight and
obesity using traditional cohort analyses, hypothesizing that
persons of high (versus normal) birth weight would be more
likely to become obese in later life; and 2) in the full-sibling
and twin pairs sample, the association between birth weight
difference and body mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/height
(m)2) difference using a within-pairs difference method,
hypothesizing that the sibling with higher birth weight
would be heavier during adolescence and young adulthood.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
(Add Health) was a prospective cohort study of 20,745 ad-
olescents representative of the US school population in
grades 7­12 in 1994­1995 (wave I) who were followed into
adulthood. Wave II of Add Health (1996; n ¼ 14,438) in-
cluded wave I adolescents who had not graduated from high
school, even if they had dropped out of high school. In wave
III (2001­2002; n ¼ 15,197), all wave I respondents were
followed, regardless of wave II participation (ages 18­27
years). Waves II and III included an additional 29 respon-
dents, for a total of 20,774 persons in the full cohort sample.
The Add Health data set consists of a core sample plus
additional subsamples, including full-sibling pairs and twin
pairs, collected for the purpose of genetic analyses. Survey
procedures have been described elsewhere and were ap-
proved by the institutional review board at the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (35).
Height and weight were self-reported in waves I, II, and
III and measured in waves II and III during in-home surveys
using standardized procedures. We used self-reported data
from all waves to maximize the sample size and for com-
parability across waves. The discrepancy in weight change
based on self-report data versus measured data in this data
set was relatively minor and was not related to important
covariates such as race/ethnicity, weight change efforts, ac-
tivity, or inactivity, suggesting random differences versus
systematic differences (36). As recommended for longitudi-
nal studies in adolescents, we used BMI as the main outcome
instead of BMI z score (37). Additionally, as recommended
by expert panels and for comparability, obesity was defined
consistently across racial/ethnic groups as BMI !95th per-
centile of the age- and sex-specific National Center for
Health Statistics/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
growth reference or !30 for adolescents and BMI !30 for
adults (38, 39). For women who were pregnant at the time of
measurement, BMI and obesity status were coded as miss-
ing. Birth weight was reported by the adolescent's mother
(93%) or caregiver (7%) during the in-home wave I parental
interview. Covariates included age, sex, parental self-
reported maternal obesity status (yes/no), parental self-
reported paternal obesity status (yes/no), living with the
sibling (for the family sample only (yes/no)), parental edu-
cation, parental income, and race/ethnicity (by parental and
adolescent report).
Full cohort analyses
From the initial 20,774 participants in the full cohort
sample, there were 62,322 possible observations across the
3 study waves. We excluded participants who were Native
American (n ¼ 156), were severely disabled (n ¼ 383), or
had missing data on birth weight (n ¼ 696)), height and
weight (n ¼ 505), maternal obesity (n ¼ 2,991), sampling
weights (n ¼ 1,850), or covariates (n ¼ 430). The final
analytic sample included all available exposure, outcome,
and covariate data collected across the 3 study waves, total-
ing 33,557 observations among 13,763 persons. Comparing
the participants included in our analysis with those who
were not, there were significant differences by race/
ethnicity, parental education, age at baseline, maternal obe-
sity, and BMI at baseline. To assess selection bias, we con-
ducted additional multivariate analyses using inverse
probability weighting, finding no evidence of selection bias
in our final models (40, 41).
Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata (release
10.0; Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas). To account
for the stratified sampling strategy and the clustered sam-
pling design, we used sample weights and survey analysis
techniques in all descriptive analyses of the longitudinal
cohort. Percentages were calculated for categorical vari-
ables, while mean values were calculated for continuous
variables. To compare persons with a nonobese mother at
baseline to those with an obese mother at baseline, we used
a v2 test and F statistic to test statistical differences.
We pooled data from all 3 waves and used longitudinal,
random-effects, Poisson regression models to examine the
association between birth weight and obesity among unre-
lated persons (e.g., between-mother effect). These models
adjusted for the correlation between repeated observations
in the same subject and had the advantage of handling lon-
gitudinal data on subjects with varying numbers of observa-
tions, thereby allowing for inclusion of the maximum
number of data points (42­44). Each individual contributed
1­3 observations (mean ¼ 2.4). Since we observed a non-
linear relation between birth weight and obesity, we catego-
rized birth weight as low (<2.5 kg), normal (!2.5­ 4 kg
(referent)), or high (>4 kg); alternatively, we split birth
weight into 8 categories (<1.8, 1.8­2.2, 2.3­2.6, 2.7­3.1,
3.2­3.5 (referent), 3.6­4.0, 4.1­4.4, and !4.5 kg).
Given evidence suggesting that the birth weight­obesity
relation may differ by age, maternal obesity, paternal obe-
sity, and sex, we examined effect measure modification
using interaction terms and likelihood ratio tests, with a ¼
0.10 (10, 21, 45, 46). Further, since most research in
this area has been predominated by data from Caucasian
populations, we explicitly examined whether race/ethnicity
550 The et al.
Am J Epidemiol 2010;172:549­557
modified the association. Finding no such modification, we
did not stratify results by race/ethnicity. Only maternal obe-
sity was identified as an effect measure modifier (P ¼ 0.04);
thus, final models were stratified by maternal obesity. Po-
tential confounders were included if they changed the main
effect coefficient by !10% or if they met a conceptual ra-
tionale. Multivariate model results were adjusted for race/
ethnicity, age, age squared, sex, and parental education.
Sibling sample
To expand the findings of traditional cohort analyses, we
analyzed data from the Add Health sibling sample (1,270
full-sibling and twin pairs; 713 same-sex full-sibling, non-
twin pairs; 270 same-sex dizygotic twin pairs; and 287
monozygotic twin pairs) to examine whether within-pair
birth weight differences influenced within-pair BMI differ-
ences in adolescence and young adulthood (e.g., within-pair
effect). Twin zygosity was determined by matching 12 mo-
lecular genetic markers at wave I or III or by full agreement
of self-report measures, including confusability of appear-
ance. Nontwin sibships were classified by self-report. From
the initial 1,270 sibling pairs, there were 3,810 possible
observations across the 3 study waves. Using the same ex-
clusion criteria as for the full cohort, the analytic sample for
the sibling sample consisted of 2,225 observations among
909 sibling pairs. Each pair contributed 1­3 observations
(mean ¼ 2.4).
We used longitudinal, random-effects, linear regression
modeling to examine whether within-pair birth weight differ-
ences predicted within-pair BMI differences over time (equa-
tions 1 and 2). Difference measures were calculated between
sibling 1 and sibling 2 (e.g., BMIsibling 1
À BMIsibling 2
), with
siblings randomly ordered. We hypothesized that if birth
weight was positively associated with later weight, the sibling
who was heavier at birth would also be heavier in adoles-
cence and young adulthood. Therefore, if birth weight differ-
ence is positively associated with later BMI difference, we
expected the regression coefficient for b1
to be significantly
greater than 0 (if the association were inverse, b1
would be
significantly less than 0; if there were no association, b1
would not differ significantly from 0). The models for full
siblings and for dizygotic and monozygotic twins, respec-
tively, are

where Y is the BMI difference between siblings in pair j at

constant across wave i.
We stratified the models by sibling pair type (full siblings,
dizygotic twins, or monozygotic twins) to capture any het-
erogeneity in the relation between birth weight and later
BMI which may be attributed to genetics and/or environ-
ment. Given research indicating that sex may differentially
influence fetal growth, length of gestation, and body com-
position among twins (47, 48), we tested effect modification
by the sex combination of the pair (using sex pair 3 birth
weight difference interactions), finding effect modification
for monozygotic twins only. For comparability across the
models, all model results were stratified by sex of the pairs
(male-male and female-female).
Potential confounders were identified using a directed
acyclic graph (not shown) (49, 50). Only covariates that
differed between siblings were included in the final models
(age and living with the sibling). Characteristics shared
between siblings, such as parental education, parental
income, maternal obesity, paternal obesity, and race/
ethnicity, were not included. For full sibling models, we
used robust cluster commands in Stata to account for
household clustering, since multiple sibling pairs per
household were included. Sampling weights were not
computed for the oversampled persons participating in
the sibling sample.
RESULTS
Full cohort sample
Descriptive characteristics of the full cohort at baseline
are given in Table 1. At baseline, persons with an obese
mother were markedly different from persons with a non-
obese mother with respect to birth weight, race/ethnicity,
age, parental education, and obesity. Irrespective of mater-
nal obesity status, obesity prevalence increased over the
8-year study period (results not shown).
Using multivariate, longitudinal, random-effects Poisson
regression modeling, we found a significant association be-
tween birth weight and obesity in persons with a nonobese
mother (Table 2). High birth weight participants with a non-
obese mother were more likely to be obese adolescents/young
adults than normal birth weight participants (incidence rate
ratio ¼ 1.46, 95% confidence interval: 1.28, 1.67).
Parallel multivariate Poisson models using additional cat-
egories (8) of birth weight similarly showed that persons
with a nonobese mother who weighed more than 3.6 kg at
birth were significantly more likely to become obese than
those weighing 3.2­3.5 kg at birth (Figure 1)--resulting, for
example, in a 1.2-unit higher BMI later in life for a birth
weight of 4.5 kg (24.1 units) versus a birth weight of 3.2 kg
(22.9 units) (results not shown). In contrast, a comparable
1.3-kg difference in birth weight was not associated with
later BMI differences for persons with an obese mother.
Sibling sample
Approximately half of the dizygotic and monozygotic
twins were low birth weight, as compared with 5% of full

siblings (Table 3). Within sibling pairs, differences in birth
weight and BMI were largest for full siblings and smallest
for monozygotic twins. Within twin pairs, only 2 persons
were high birth weight (monozygotic twins).
Using longitudinal, random-effects, linear regression
models to predict BMI differences, we observed that
among monozygotic females, twin birth weight differences
were positively associated with adolescent and young adult
BMI differences (b ¼ 2.67, 95% confidence interval: 0.99,
4.35); the twin with a higher birth weight was more likely
to have a higher BMI later in life, whereas no such asso-
ciation was observed for full siblings or dizygotic twins
(Table 4). Post-hoc power calculations revealed adequate
statistical power (>80%) to detect within-pair BMI
differences of approximately 1 unit or more (results not
shown).
DISCUSSION
Given mounting evidence suggesting that birth weight is
associated with adult size and disease, a comprehensive un-
derstanding of whether the association between birth weight
and adult size reflects intrauterine environmental factors or
common genetic factors is needed (16). However, in most
studies examining the association between birth weight and
obesity, investigators use traditional cohort data, which may
not be adequately suited to understanding which factors
contribute to the association. Sibling and twin study designs
allow within-pair analytic approaches that eliminate much
of the influence of factors shared by both siblings, such as
maternal exposures (e.g., maternal age), genetics, and the
postnatal environment (e.g., parental feeding styles and so-
cioeconomic status) (16, 24­28). Taking advantage of a na-
tionally representative, prospective data set, we observed
that maternal obesity modified the relation between birth
weight and later obesity. Persons who were high birth
weight (versus normal birth weight) and had a nonobese
mother were significantly more likely to be obese later in
life. We observed a similar (but not statistically significant)
trend for persons with an obese mother. Notably, we found
no evidence of modification by race/ethnicity, which sug-
gests that findings from predominantly Caucasian popula-
tions may be generalizable to all US racial/ethnic groups. In
the sibling sample, we observed a positive association of
birth weight difference with later BMI difference in mono-
zygotic, female twins only, despite adequate power to detect
within-pair differences of !1 BMI unit; this suggests that
null findings in all other sibling configurations may be due
to inadequate power to detect small within-pair BMI
differences.
Similarly to our study, investigators in a majority of co-
hort studies have reported a positive association between
birth weight and obesity later in life (7­14); however, only
1 other study found effect-measure modification by mater-
nal size (10). Given the strong link between maternal obe-
sity, infant birth weight, and child obesity, we hypothesized

that the relation between birth weight and later obesity may
be modified by common genetic factors and/or an obeso-
genic environment related to both birth weight and later
obesity. If these genetic factors and/or behaviors were
passed from mother to child, the association between birth
weight and later obesity might be modified by maternal
obesity status. We found an association between birth
weight and later obesity in offspring of nonobese mothers
only, suggesting that genetic factors and/or an obesogenic
postnatal environment may be stronger determinants of obe-
sity than intrauterine factors.
Twin studies examining the relation between birth weight
and later size have yielded inconsistent findings: Some have
found positive associations, some null associations (5, 6, 29­
34). Discrepant findings may reflect differences in inclusion
criteria (e.g., monozygotic twins only and/or combining twins
of mixed sex (29­32, 34)). Our findings suggest that the in-
trauterine environment unique to each fetus contributes to
later size differences only in female monozygotic twin pairs.
However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the intrauter-
ine environment does contribute to later size differences
across other sibling configurations, since we did not have
sufficient power to detect within-pair differences of <1
BMI unit, which would not be captured if the intrauterine
environment contributes to very small differences in later
size. Intrauterine factors influencing birth weight between
and within twins include blood and nutrient supply, umbilical
cord insertion, placentation, and chorionicity (26, 51, 52).

However, it is not possible to entirely preclude the influence
of genetic factors even among monozygotic twins, since they
may also differ according to a number of genetic factors,
including the number of chromosomes present, as well as
epigenetic modifications and DNA mutations (53). Alterna-
tively, if the observed null associations are accurate, the com-
monly observed positive association between birth weight
and obesity may be confounded by unmeasured, shared fac-
tors (e.g., maternal characteristics), accounted for with the
within-pairs difference method in full siblings, dizygotic
twins, and male-male monozygotic twins.
Comparing the results from the traditional cohort analy-
ses to those from the within-sibling/twin pair analyses sheds
light on which factors contribute to the birth weight­obesity
association. If findings for the full cohort and dizygotic
twins and siblings are both positive, whereas findings for
monozygotic twins are attenuated, this suggests that factors
shared between monozygotic twins influence later body size
(e.g., genetic factors). Conversely, if findings from the full
cohort are positive, whereas null findings are observed in the
within-pair sibling/twin sample, this suggests that any
factors shared between full sibling and twin pairs underlie
the association between birth weight and obesity (e.g.,
socioeconomic status). If the observed null findings in
monozygotic male twins are accurate, the positive findings
observed in the full cohort may be attributable to confound-
ing by maternal characteristics or influenced by genetic
factors. Alternatively, null findings may result from inad-
equate power to detect small within-pair differences,
which could be the case if within-pair birth weight differ-
ences contribute very little to within-pair BMI differences
later in life.
Most research in this area has 1) been conducted in ra-
cially/ethnically homogenous populations and 2) examined
the association between birth weight and size at only a single
point in time, thus precluding the generalizability of results
to larger populations. The strengths of our study include our
use of a large, nationally representative cohort followed over
an 8-year time span, providing valuable information regard-
ing the potential influence of modification by maternal obe-
sity, paternal obesity, sex, age, and race/ethnicity, as well as
comparative findings from the sibling and twin samples. Our
within-pairs difference approach holds all factors related to
the mother and pregnancy constant, while our cohort ap-
proach provides information on unrelated persons, similar
to a between-pair coefficient. Our findings shed light on the
complex nature by which environmental and genetic factors
influence the relation between birth weight and obesity.
Despite these strengths, our study had some limitations.
First, results from a unique sample of twin pairs may not
be generalizable to singleton births, particularly those involv-
ing term gestations. Generally, twins have lower birth weights

than singletons, which largely reflects a shorter gestation pe-
riod and intrauterine growth restriction (54). Additionally,
since development of fat mass largely occurs later in preg-
nancy, twins may have decreased fat mass in comparison with
full-term singleton babies (55). These differences in body
composition may modify the association between birth
weight and later size, which we were not able to capture using
BMI. While other measures may more accurately capture
adiposity, BMI is recommended for large epidemiologic stud-
ies and adequately correlates with total body fat (56). A
second limitation is that while we used a sibling and twin-
pair design to reduce effects of shared environmental and
genetic factors, the results may have been affected by residual
confounding (e.g., birth weight differences may result in
a maternal choice to differentially feed offspring). Unfortu-
nately, Add Health investigators did not collect information
about early-life factors, such as maternal care-giving prac-
tices or other environmental/antenatal factors that differed
between the siblings in early life. Furthermore, our results
may have been subject to measurement error arising from
parental recall of birth weight and respondent self-report of
height and weight. However, parental recall of birth weight
has been shown to be relatively accurate, and discrepancies
between self-reported and measured height/weight in Add
Health are relatively minor (57­61). Nonetheless, nondiffer-
ential reporting errors regarding birth weight, height, and
weight would tend to attenuate the association between birth
weight and later size and may underlie null findings in
the sibling sample. Alternatively, while our sibling sample
was larger than samples in other sibling studies, it was still
relatively small, with adequate statistical power to detect
only within-pair differences of !1 BMI unit (30­32).
In summary, our cohort study findings suggest that high
birth weight is positively associated with later obesity. Find-
ings from our sibling and twin study suggest that unmea-
sured, shared factors, such as maternal characteristics, may
be responsible for the commonly observed positive associ-
ation between birth weight and later obesity. While there is
growing evidence that early-life factors may influence later
health outcomes, a better understanding of the pathways
underlying this relation is needed.
