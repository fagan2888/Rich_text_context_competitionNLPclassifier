Firm-Specific Productivity Risk over the Business
Cycle: Facts and Aggregate Implications
Abstract
Is time-varying firm-level uncertainty a major cause or amplifier of the business cycle? This
paper investigates this question in the context of a heterogeneous-firm RBC model with
persistent firm-level productivity shocks and lumpy capital adjustment, where cyclical
changes in uncertainty correspond naturally to cyclical changes in the cross-sectional
dispersion of firm-specific Solow residual innovations. We use a German firm-level data set
to investigate the extent to which firm-level uncertainty varies over the cycle. This allows us
to put empirical discipline on our numerical simulations. We find that, while firm-level
uncertainty is indeed countercyclical, it does not fluctuate enough to significantly alter the
dynamics of an RBC model with only first moment shocks. The mild changes we do find are
mainly caused by a bad news effect: higher uncertainty today predicts lower aggregate
Solowresiduals tomorrow. This effect dominates the real option value effect of time-varying
uncertainty, highlighted in the literature.

1 Introduction
"Crises feed uncertainty. And uncertainty affects behaviour, which feeds
the crisis. [...] But there is more at work. If you think that another Depres-
sion might be around the corner, better to be careful and save more."
IMF Chief Economist, Olivier Blanchard, in: The Economist, 29 January, 2009
Is time-varying firm-level uncertainty a major cause or amplifier of the business cycle? This
paper investigates this question in the context of a heterogeneous-firm RBC model with per-
sistent firm-level productivity shocks and lumpy capital adjustment. We make three contribu-
tions to the existing literature: first, we discipline the calibration of time-varying uncertainty
as a driving force through a detailed analysis of the behavior of the cross-section of firms over
the cycle, rather than through stock market data; secondly, we analyze the implications of time-
varying uncertainty in the context of a general equilibrium framework and using the detailed
unconditional and conditional second moment analysis of model-simulated aggregate time se-
ries that has become a standard tool in the business cycle literature; and, thirdly, we show a new
mechanism through which uncertainty shocks have (mild) aggregate effects: a bad news effect,
rather than the time-varying option value effect (wait-and-see) that has been highlighted thus
far (Dixit and Pindyck, 1994, Hassler, 1996 and 2001, and, more recently, Bloom, 2009). We find
the wait-and-see-effect to be dominated by the bad news effect.
In the aforementioned model context, cyclical changes in uncertainty correspond naturally
to cyclical changes in the cross-section of firms ­ more specifically the dispersions of change
rates of firm-level Solow residuals, real value added and real sales. Thus, using the balance
sheet data set of Deutsche Bundesbank (USTAN) ­ a private sector, annual, firm-level data set
that allows us to investigate 26 years of data (1973-1998), in which the cross-sections of the
panel have over 30,000 firms per year on average, and which has a broad ownership, size and
sectoral coverage ­, we first show that the cross-sectional standard deviations of the firm-level
innovations in the Solow residual, real value added and sales are indeed robustly and signif-
icantly countercyclical. This confirms U.S.-related findings by Bloom (2009) and Bloom et al.
(2009) for the implied volatility of the stock market, for Compustat data on publicly traded firms
and for sectoral data. We interpret these changes as countercyclical fluctuations in firm-specific
productivity uncertainty. Second, we show that for our broad German cross-section of firms the
volatility in uncertainty over the cycle is substantially lower than has been considered in the lit-
erature. These two results are essentially robust to different choices for the cyclical indicator, to
alternative calculations of the Solow residual, to various changes in the sample selection crite-
ria and to explicitly considering cyclical sample selection and measurement error in the micro
data. We also use IFO survey data on business expectations to confirm our findings. Figure 1 il-

lustrates the countercyclicality of firm-level risk. It displays for Germany the annual time series
of the dispersion of firm-level Solow residual innovations, linearly detrended, and the cyclical
component of GDP, as measured by log-HP(100) filtered aggregate output.1

We then explore the quantitative importance of these shocks to uncertainty in a
heterogeneous-firm RBC model similar to the one in Khan and Thomas (2008) and Bachmann
et al. (2008). We have developed the computational techniques to study time-varying uncer-
tainty in general equilibrium in parallel with Bloom et al. (2009). We find that uncertainty
shocks alone - if of a size in line with our empirical evidence - do not introduce quantitatively
significant business cycle fluctuations. Moreover, purely uncertainty driven business cycles
lead to counterfactual acyclicality of aggregate consumption.
Shocks to uncertainty nonetheless modestly alter the aggregate behavior of the model if
they are introduced alongside standard first moment fluctuations in aggregate Solow residuals
and compared to a model with only these first moment shocks (essentially the standard RBC

model). Yet, this change does not come through the real options effect often associated with
time-varying uncertainty. Instead, we identify a new economic channel, by which fluctuations
in uncertainty influence the business cycle that results only from their correlation with aggre-
gate productivity. Since changes in uncertainty empirically correlate with future developments
in the aggregate Solow residual, the former constitute news about the latter.
Specifically, we find that an increase in productivity risk essentially acts as a bad news shock.
In general equilibrium, this means that households decrease their consumption and increase
their labor supply, which we find to be consistent with the data. We also find a decrease in the
real wage as a result of a shock to uncertainty not only in our model but again also in the impulse
response function of the data. As a result of this decrease in wages, we find ­ again both in the
data as well as in our model ­ an increase in economic activity at the moment of the uncertainty
shock, followed by a recession, when the predicted downturn in productivity occurs. The effects
of uncertainty shocks that we find in our model almost entirely operate through this channel.
Comparing a partial equilibrium version to our general equilibrium model in terms of the
impulse response functions of investment with respect to shocks to uncertainty illustrates this
mechanism further. While in partial equilibrium the bad news on impact causes aggregate in-
vestment activity to collapse, in general equilibrium, this effect is reversed by the decrease in
the real interest rate, such that investment rates even expand on impact and only turn negative
as lower productivity actually realizes. Indeed, the point estimate of the empirical impulse re-
sponse function of uncertainty on national saving is positive on impact. This shows that general
equilibrium analysis is paramount in understanding the aggregate effects of firm-level uncer-
tainty shocks.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes our data set, the
USTAN data, discusses briefly the selection of the final sample and details our empirical results.
Section 3 explains the model. Section 4 describes its calibration and Section 5 discusses the
numerical results. Appendices provide more details on the data set, give further robustness
checks for the empirical findings as well as for the simulation results.
Related Literature
Over the last two decades, the economic literature has used models with fixed costs of capi-
tal adjustment or irreversibility as a natural starting point to study the effects of uncertainty on
economic activity (see e.g. Dixit and Pindyck, 1994). More recently, Bloom (2009) and Bloom
et al. (2009) document that increases in stock market volatility are correlated with a reduction
in aggregate economic activity. The former in partial equilibrium, the latter in general equilib-
rium then provide a formal model qualitatively similar to the one used here, where an increase
in uncertainty leads to a higher real option value of investment, letting more firms `wait and see'
4
after such an increase, which in turn leads to a fall in aggregate investment and employment. In
a similar vein and also in general equilibrium, but in a different model context, Sim (2008) puts
forth a model that explains the cyclical patterns in firms' entry and exit with cyclical variations
in uncertainty. Gilchrist et al. (2009) explore the implications of time-varying uncertainty for
bond risk premia and via this channel for aggregate investment in a general equilibrium model.
Alexopoulos and Cohen (2009) propose the `number of New York Times articles on uncertainty
and economic activity' as an alternative measure for uncertainty shocks and find in an em-
pirical exercise that this measure of uncertainty is negatively correlated with aggregate activity.
Finally, in a somewhat different context, Fernandez-Villaverde et. al (2009) find that increases in
interest rate volatility suppress real activity in small open emerging market economies in Latin
America.
None of the above draws its empirical evidence on broad-based cross-sectional firm data.
The data that is typically used is stock market data or analyst data available only for a subset
of large publicly traded companies or even sectoral data. Using stock market data to identify
fluctuations in productivity, however, implies strong market efficiency assumptions (see for in-
stance Shiller, 1981). We use firm-level balance sheet data instead.2 This links the empirical
part of this paper most closely to a series of papers by Higson and Holly et al. (2002, 2004),
Doepke and Holly et al. (2005, 2008), Doepke and Weber (2006), as well as Holly and Santoro
(2008). Higson and Holly et al. (2002), using Compustat data, study empirically the cyclicality
of the standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis of the sales growth rate distribution and find
them to be countercyclical, countercyclical and procyclical, respectively. Higson and Holly et al.
(2004) repeat this analysis for UK data on quoted firms, and Doepke and Holly et al. (2005) for
Germany, using the USTAN database, with similar findings. Doepke and Weber (2006) study,
again using USTAN data, the cyclicality of transitions between sales growth regimes in firm-
level data. In contrast to these papers, we focus on the cyclicality of cross-sectional second
moments only, but include real value added and Solow residuals into the analysis. These are
arguably the right firm-level counterpart for GDP and aggregate Solow residuals, respectively.
The quantitative part of this paper draws heavily on the recent literature on heterogenous-
firm RBC models, developed in Khan and Thomas (2008) as well as Bachmann et al. (2008).
Finally, this paper is related to the work by Beaudry and Portier (2006), Jaimovich and Rebelo
(2008), Sims (2008) as well as Schmidt-Grohe and Uribe (2008) on the impact of news shocks
on business cycle dynamics. In a companion paper (Bachmann and Bayer, 2009), we focus on
the implications of countercyclical dispersion in the firm-level Solow residual innovations for
cross-sectional dynamics as opposed to aggregate dynamics.
2On the household side, using PSID data, Storesletten et al. (2004) have extensively demonstrated the counter-
cyclicality of labor income risk. This paper fills the gap on the production side of the economy.

2 The Facts
In Section 2.1 we briefly describe the USTAN data set and the main sample selection criteria
we use. Details are relegated to Appendix A.1. In Section 2.2 we present the baseline facts: the
contemporaneous correlations of cyclical aggregate output and the cross-sectional standard
deviations of log changes in firm-level Solow residuals, real value added and sales are negative,
but the cyclical variations are small, at most 1.5 times the volatility of aggregate output. In
Section 2.3 we perform extensive robustness checks and also show, how these facts depend on
observable firm characteristics.
2.1 A Brief Data Description
2.1.1 USTAN Data
USTAN is a large annual firm-level balance sheet data base (Unternehmensbilanzstatistik) col-
lected by Deutsche Bundesbank. It is unique in its combination of size and coverage as well as
detail of available variables. It provides annual firm level data from 1971 to 1998 from the bal-
ance sheets and the profit and loss accounts of over 60,000 firms per year (see Stoess (2001),
von Kalckreuth (2003) and Doepke et al. (2005) for further details). In the days when the dis-
counting of commercial bills were one of the principal instruments of German monetary policy,
Bundesbank law required the Bundesbank to assess the creditworthiness of all parties backing
a commercial bill put up for discounting. The Bundesbank implemented this regulation by re-
quiring balance sheet data of all parties involved. These balance sheet data were then archived
and collected into a database.
Although the sampling design ­ one's commercial bill being put up for discounting ­ does
not lead to a representative selection of firms in a statistical sense, the coverage of the sample
is very broad. USTAN covers incorporated firms as well as privately-owned companies, which
distinguishes it positively from Compustat data.3 Its sectoral coverage ­ while still somewhat
biased to manufacturing firms ­ includes the construction, the service as well as the primary
sectors. This makes it different from, for instance, the Annual Survey of Manufacturing (ASM)
in the U.S.4 The following table 1 displays the sectoral coverage of our final baseline sample.
Moreover, while there remains a bias to somewhat larger and financially healthier firms, the
size coverage is still fairly broad: 31% of all firms in our final baseline sample have less than
3Davis et al. (2006) show that studying only publicly traded firms can lead to wrong conclusions, in particular
when higher cross-sectional moments are concerned. See Appendix A.1 Table 27 for ownership coverage in our
final sample.
4An additional advantage of these data is easy access: while access is on-site, it is practically free for researchers,
so that results derived from this data base can be easily tested and checked.

Agriculture 12,291 1.44
Mining & Energy 4,165 0.49
Manufacturing 405,787 47.5

Transportation & Communication 22,085 2.59
20 employees and 57% have less than 50 employees (see Table 25 in Appendix A.1 for details).
Finally, the Bundesbank itself frequently used the USTAN data for its macroeconomic analyses
and for cross-checking national accounting data. We take this as an indication that the bank
considers the data as sufficiently representative and of sufficiently high quality. This makes the
USTAN data an exceptionally suitable data source for the study of cross-sectional business cycle
dynamics.
2.1.2 Selection of the Baseline Sample
From the original USTAN data, we select only firms that report complete information on payroll,
gross value added and capital stocks. Moreover, we drop observations from East German firms
to avoid a break of the series in 1990. In addition, we remove observations that stem from
irregular accounting statements, e.g. when filing for bankruptcy or when closing operations.
We deflate all but the capital and investment data by the implicit deflator for gross value added
from the German national accounts.
Capital is deflated with one-digit sector- and capital-good specific investment good price
deflators within a perpetual inventory method. Even though USTAN data can be considered as
particularly high quality data, we cannot directly use capital stocks as reported. Tax motivated
depreciation and price developments of capital goods lead to a general understatement of the
stock of capital a firm holds. Thus, capital stocks have to be recalculated using a perpetual
inventory method (see Appendix A.2, for details). Similarly, we recover the amount of labor
inputs from wage bills, as information on the number of employees (as opposed to payroll data)
is only updated infrequently for some companies (see Appendix A.3, for details). Finally, the
firm-level Solow residual is calculated from data on gross value added and factor inputs.
We remove outliers according to the following procedure: we calculate log changes in real
gross value added, the Solow residual, real capital and employment, as well as the firm-level in-
vestment rate and drop all observations where a change falls outside a three standard deviations
7
interval around the year-specific mean.5 We also drop those firms for which we do not have at
least five observations in first differences. This leaves us with a sample of 854,105 firm-year
observations, which corresponds to observations on 72,853 firms, i.e. the average observation
length of a firm in the sample is 11.7 years. The average number of firms in the cross-section per
year is 32,850. We perform numerous robustness checks with respect to each of the selection
criteria and measurement choices: we use sectoral deflators for value added, an aggregate in-
vestment good price deflator, change the cut-off rule to 2.5 and 5 standard deviations and leave
all firms in the sample with two and twenty observations in first differences, respectively. None
of these choices change our baseline results (see Table 38 in Appendix B.1 for details).
2.1.3 Solow Residual and Productivity Innovations
We compute the firm-level Solow residual based on the following Cobb-Douglas production
function in accordance with our model:
yi,t = zt i,t k
i,t
n
i,t
,
where i,t is firm-specific productivity, and zt is aggregate productivity. We assume that
labor input ni,t is immediately productive, whereas capital ki,t is pre-determined and inherited
from last period. In our main specification, we estimate the output elasticities of the production
factors,  and , as median shares of factor expenditures over gross value added within each
industry.6 We use log-differences in the Solow residual to capture Solow residual innovations,
as the persistence of firm-level Solow residuals exhibits behavior close to a unit root. In order
to check, whether our results are driven by measurement error in a difficult-to-measure driving
force, we also study log-differences in outcome variables: firm-level real value added and sales.
We remove firm fixed and sectoral-year7 effects from these first-difference variables to focus
on idiosyncratic fluctuations that do not capture differences in sectoral responses to aggregate
shocks or permanent ex-ante heterogeneity between firms.8 We focus on the cross-sectional
5This outlier removal is done after removing firm and sectoral fixed effects. Centering the outlier removal
around the year mean is important to avoid artificial and countercyclical skewness of the respective distributions.
6To check the robustness of our results, we try alternative specifications with predefined elasticities common
across sectors. We also change the timing assumption to include a predetermined employment stock, as well as
immediate adjustment in both factors. All results are very robust to the alternative ways to generate the firm-
specific Solow residual (see Table 31 Appendix B.1 for details).
7The sectoral fixed effects are essentially computed at the 2-digit level, see Table 24 in Appendix A.1 for details.
8 Specifically, we decompose a variable observed of firm i in sector j at time t into firm a fixed effect i , a
sectoral time effects j t and an idiosyncratic unpredictable error term i j t , which are orthogonal to each other
xi j t = x

.
We then focus on the error term i jt .

dispersion of these three variables and measure the dispersion in terms of standard deviations.9
In a standard model with ex-ante homogenous firms, these standard deviations characterize
the uncertainty or risk of a firm with regard to its idiosyncratic productivity growth. In line with
this, the literature ­ e.g. Davis et al. (2006), Bloom et al. (2007), Sim (2008), Bloom et al. (2009),
Bloom (2009) and Gilchrist et al. (2009) ­ has modeled fluctuations in idiosyncratic uncertainty
as fluctuations in the standard deviation of firm-specific innovations in the Solow residual. We
follow this view and study the quantitative aggregate importance of fluctuations in the cross-
sectional dispersion of productivity innovations.
2.1.4 Macro data
When combining this micro data with aggregate data, we have to take a stance on the sectoral
aggregate that is the empirical counterpart to our model. We chose to include firms from the
following six sectors in our analysis: agriculture, mining and energy, manufacturing, construc-
tion, trade (both retail and wholesale) as well as the transportation and communication sector.
This aggregate can be roughly characterized as the non-financial private business sector (NF-
PBS) in Germany. Whenever we use the term aggregate in the following, we mean this sector.
German national accounting data per one-digit sector (see Appendix A.1, Footnote 49, for
a detailed description of the data sources used) allow us to compute real value added, invest-
ment, capital and employment data for this sectoral aggregate, and therefore also an aggregate
Solow residual. Our USTAN sample captures on average 70% of sectoral value added and 78%
of sectoral real gross output (sales). The NFPBS, in turn, comprises 59% and 69%, respectively,
of aggregate real value added and real gross output.
In addition to representing a large part of the non-financial private business sector in Ger-
many, USTAN also represents its cyclical behavior very well, as the following Table 2 shows:10
Table 2: CYCLICALITY OF CROSS-SECTIONAL AVERAGES
Cross-sectional Moment (·,HP(100)-Y ) (·,Log -di f f -Y )
mean(log i,t ) 0.592 0.923

mean(logsalesi,t ) 0.410 0.899
Notes: mean: cross-sectional average, linearly detrended. : time series correlation coefficient.
HP()-Y : Cyclical component of aggregate log-GDP after HP-filtering using smoothing parameter . Y refers to

9The baseline within-transformed cross-sectional data for these dispersions can be found in Table 30 in Ap-
pendix A.5.
10We further illustrate the good representation properties of USTAN in Appendix A.1.

2.2 Main Facts: Idiosyncratic Productivity Risk ­ Large and Countercyclical
Using the micro data from USTAN, we can compute the cross-sectional dispersions for inno-
vations in firm-level Solow residuals, real value added and real sales. We analyze both their
time-averaged long-run as well as their cyclical properties. Table 3 presents our main results:
Table 3: CYCLICALITY AND VOLATILITY OF CROSS-SECTIONAL DISPERSION
Cross-sectional Moment cv(·) (·,HP(100)-Y ) µ(·)
std(log i,t ) 2.67% -0.481 0.120
std(log yi,t ) 3.73% -0.451 0.142
std(logsalesi,t ) 3.82% -0.405 0.187
Notes: std: cross-sectional standard deviation, linearly detrended. cv: time series coefficient of variation. µ: time
series average. See further notes to Table 2.
· The time-averaged cross-sectional standard deviation of the log-changes in firm-level
Solow residuals is large: 12%. In contrast, the volatility of the linearly detrended aggre-
gate Solow residual is 2.06%, i.e. an order of magnitude smaller; the one for the linearly
detrended cross-sectional average Solow residual 2.37%.11 This also means that firm-
specific productivity risk is an order of magnitude larger than in Kahn and Thomas (2008)
as well as Bloom et al. (2009) who, without the discipline of firm-level data, are using for
the standard deviation of the innovations to firm-level Solow residuals in their models:
2.2% annually.
· The cross-sectional standard deviation of the innovations to firm-level Solow residuals
is countercyclical with a correlation coefficient with HP-filtered aggregate GDP of -0.481.
Table 4 shows that this countercyclicality is significant, as the 5% and 95% confidence
bands from 10,000 parametric bootstrap simulations are both negative.12 The last column
of Table 4 displays the fraction of positive correlations in these bootstrap simulations.
· The size of annual fluctuations in risk is relatively small, with a time-series coefficient of
variation of 2.67%.
11This order-of-magnitude difference also suggests that the fluctuations-in-uncertainty-story has to be likely one
about idiosyncratic productivity, rather than aggregate productivity. Firms' policy functions are mainly determined
by the idiosyncratic state given this difference, and fluctuations in anyway small aggregate risk do not seem to be
a plausible candidate for business cycle fluctuations. In addition, we find for the cyclical components of aggregate
quarterly output and employment in Germany that moving-window volatility estimates as well as the squared
residuals from AR(1) regressions are essentially uncorrelated with the cycle.
12We use a pairwise unrestricted VAR with one lag as the parametric model. The results from a nonparametric
overlapping block bootstrap with a block size of four are similar to the parametric bootstrap.
10
For comparison, Bloom et al. (2009) find a correlation of their stock market-based uncer-
tainty index with GDP of -0.606. Gourio (2008), using Compustat data, finds the correlation
between GDP and the standard deviation of the innovation to a permanent productivity shock
to be - 0.56.13 Thus our finding aligns well in this point with previous work. For the size of
the fluctuations, there is little previous evidence. In his numerical simulations, Bloom (2009)
considers a productivity process for monthly data, which exhibits a time-series coefficient of
variation of the dispersion in annual productivity growth of roughly 17%.
One could be concerned that the Solow residual does not measure productivity well. For
this reason, we provide evidence also from log-differences in endogenous outcome variables,
namely real value added and real sales. As balance sheet items these are arguably less subject to
measurement error.14 Using these indirect measures makes no difference: their cross-sectional
dispersions are large on average, they are significantly countercyclical, but their business cycle
fluctuations are small.

tion coefficient. The last column displays the fraction of simulations with the opposite sign of the point estimate.
See further notes to Tables 2 and 3.
2.3 Robustness
Two questions arise: first, are these results sensitive to the choice of the cyclical indicator and
the dispersion measure used? Secondly, are they driven by sample composition or cyclical sam-
ple selection? We show they are not.
Cyclical Indicator and Dispersion Measure
The following Table 5 shows that countercyclical idiosyncratic uncertainty as measured by
the cross-sectional dispersion of firm-level Solow residual innovations is robust to the choice of
the cyclical indicator (for std(log yi,t ) and std(logsalesi,t ) see Table 32 in Appendix B.1).
13Interestingly, Comin and Mulani (2006), using also Compustat data, find procyclicality of a moving-standard
deviation estimator of firm-level risk in real sales innovations.
14Bachmann and Bayer (2009) show that when looking at inputs, log-changes in firm-level employment are sim-
ilarly countercyclical, firm-level investment rates are strongly and significantly procyclical.

The result stands irrespective of whether we choose as cyclical indicators output filtered
using a smaller smoothing parameter for the HP filter, following Ravn and Uhlig (2002), apply a
log-difference filter to output, or use the linearly detrended average cross-sectional investment
rate, or the HP(100)-filtered aggregate employment, or aggregate Solow residuals.
Vice versa, as Table 6 shows, our three findings are also robust to the numerous choices we
have made for the other part of the correlation, std(log i,t ), for instance (for std(log yi,t )
and std(logsalesi,t ) see Table 33 in Appendix B.1). For instance, one can use the interquartile
range (iqr) as the dispersion measure. Moreover, it is not the removal of firm-level and sectoral
fixed effects that induces the countercyclicality, as row three of this table shows. Finally, the last
two rows demonstrate that the results are neither driven by the German reunification, nor by
the strong recession in 1975.

Sample Composition
USTAN is no random sample. Consequently, we need to check whether our findings are
specific to certain sectors or types of firms overrepresented in this sample. Our findings for
std(log i,t ) in Tables 7 to 915 are twofold: on the one hand, we find that qualitatively our em-

pirical results hold across various observable characteristics; on the other hand, we also show
that, quantitatively, using data sets that overrepresent large or publicly traded firms or are lim-
ited to manufacturing, as is the case with most U.S. data sets, one may overstate the cyclical
fluctuations in firm-level uncertainty.

Table 7 displays the behavior of productivity risk for the six single-digit sectors in the USTAN
sample. The relatively large idiosyncratic risk is obviously not specific to any sector, in fact the
numbers are surprisingly uniform across sectors. When one disregards the small agricultural
sector, average productivity uncertainty ranges from 11.2% in the construction sector to 13.6%
in the transportation and communication sector. For the two sectors that comprise almost 90%
of all firm-year observations in the data ­ manufacturing and trade ­ also the countercyclicality-
of-uncertainty result is robust.16 Finally, also the result that risk fluctuations are not large is
robust across sectors (again with the exception of the small mining and energy sector). Manu-
facturing and construction exhibit somewhat larger risk fluctuations, but the difference to both
the trade sector and the aggregate is small.
The non-random design of USTAN manifests itself not only in the sectoral but also the size
composition of the sample. To understand the effect of this, we split the sample according to
firm size, as measured by employment. Again this yields no different results. Table 8 shows
that large firms exhibit a somewhat smaller average uncertainty that fluctuates more than the
uncertainty of small firms, but overall the results are surprisingly uniform across size classes.17
16Had we used Log-diff-Y as the cyclical measure for the trade sector, the countercyclicality indicator would be
-0.474, and -0.455 in the case of Log-diff-Solow Residual. Moreover, the acyclicality of uncertainty in the construc-
tion sector, when the own sectoral output is used, goes away, when instead we use the average sectoral Solow
residual innovation from USTAN as the cyclical indicator: -0.059, 0.291, -0.638, -0.596, -0.270 and -0.290, respec-

Nevertheless, it shows that using data sets, which suffer from an even stronger overrepre-
sentation of large firms, such as Compustat, may lead to an overstatement of the cyclical fluc-
tuations in firm-level uncertainty. A similar point is made in Table 9, where we split the sample
according to a broad definition of legal form. Again, the publicly traded firms, which are also
typically large, are slightly different from the aggregate.

a small fraction.
Cyclical Sample Selection
So far we have focused on permanent misrepresentation of certain kinds of firms, like a bias
towards manufacturing. As we have shown, this can be dealt with by splitting the sample along
observable characteristics. The possibility of systematic cyclical variation in sample selection,
for instance through firm entry and exit, poses a more severe problem to our analysis.
tively, for the six sectors.
17We tried alternative splits according to the stock of capital and real value added. The results are very similar,
details can be found in Table 35 in Appendix B.1. Numbers for the dispersions of innovations to firm-level value
added and sales across size classes are available on request. We also studied a stratification according to firm-level
productivity and found the same results. Again, details are available on request.
14
We address the issue of cyclical sample selection in two different ways: in a first pass, we
constrain our sample to those firms which we observe at least 20 times in the sample; secondly,
we estimate a simple selection model, where lagged firm-level Solow residuals determine selec-
tion and firm-level Solow residual innovations are modeled as a mean regression.
Table 10: RESULTS FOR FIRMS WITH AT LEAST 20 OBSERVATIONS

std(logsalesi,t )Longer in sample 7.90% -0.466 0.149
Notes: See notes to Tables 2 and 3. The number of total firm-year observations goes down from 854,105 to 212,607.
When we constrain our sample to those firms which we observe at least 20 times (see Ta-
ble 10), we find the same countercyclical pattern in productivity risk as in the baseline sam-
pling with a higher volatility of uncertainty. The advantage of this sample is that its selection
is by construction less subject to cyclical fluctuations. Its disadvantage is that the non-cyclical
selection bias becomes stronger and the sample covers more large, publicly traded firms. This
partly drives our finding, as the second procedure below shows.
Alternatively, we control for sample selection in the following way: we estimate a simple
selection model, where lagged firm-level Solow residuals determine selection. Productivity lev-
els are a natural determinant of market entry and exit. Firm-level Solow residual innovations
are modeled as a mean regression. Lagged firm specific Solow residuals are excluded from
this mean regression as productivity is highly persistent and thus lagged levels do not predict
changes. We use the maximum likelihood estimator by Heckman (1976) to infer the selection-
corrected standard deviation of the residual in the reduced-form regression for firm-level Solow
residual innovations. The correlation between the latter and the sample standard deviation of
firm-level Solow residual innovations is 0.972, indicating that our results are not influenced by
systematic sample selection. Table 11 shows that this indeed is the case.

std(log i,t )Selection-Corrected 2.63% -0.439 0.118
Notes: See notes to Tables 2 and 3.
15
On the basis of these two pieces of evidence ­ robustness of our results to a sample with
surviving firms and a high correlation between selection-corrected and sample standard devia-
tions of firm-level Solow residual innovations ­ we conclude that cyclical sample attrition is not
central to our findings.18
Measurement Error
In any Solow residual calculation that is based on a simple Cobb-Douglas production func-
tion with only labor and capital, there is the potential problem of attributing optimal changes in
utilization, hours per worker or effort to random productivity changes and therefore of overstat-
ing (average) firm-level risk. Therefore we focus in Table 12 on those firms who did not change
the intensity of their material usage between two periods, assuming that observed changes in
material usage are a good proxy for unobserved changes in utilization (see Basu, 1996, for this
idea). These firms indeed exhibit a somewhat smaller productivity risk that fluctuates slightly
more in relative terms than the productivity risk of the average firm in the sample. The mea-
sured countercyclicality of idiosyncratic uncertainty is smaller,19 but overall our results carry
over to this group of firms.

std(log i,t )Aggregate 2.67% -0.481 0.120

Notes: See notes to Tables 2 and 3. Material Intensity const. refers to firms whose material expenditures over
sales mi,t
salesi,t
have changed by less then one percentage point in absolute terms. Results for std(log yi,t ) and
std(logsalesi,t ) can be found in tables 37 in Appendix B.1.
More generally, we take measurement error at the micro level into account in the follow-
ing way: Assuming additive classical measurement error in firm-level log-Solow residuals and
log-value added and a time-invariant measurement error variance in both, we can use the time-
average of the difference between the one-period innovation to observed firm-level log-Solow
residuals/log-value added and half the variance of the two-period innovations to estimate the
variances of measurement error for both quantities. Subtracting this number (twice) from the
observed variance of one-period innovations yields an estimate of the true variance of the inno-
18We also investigated whether the time-average and the cyclical behavior of firm-level fixed effects is large
enough to indicate systematic cyclical sample selection as a problem. We did not find that it is. Details are available
on request.
19The decline happens, irrespective of the cyclical measure used, but its magnitude is somewhat sensitive to the
choice of the cyclical measure. For instance, had we used Log-diff-Y, the decline would have been from -0.583 to
-0.460, and from -0.465 to -0.393 in the case of Log-diff-Solow Residual.
16
vations. In other words, we obtain the variance of the measurement error from a permanent-
transitory decomposition of changes in productivity. This means, we attribute all temporary
changes in firm-level log-Solow residuals/log-value added to measurement error. For this rea-
son one should view the obtained numbers as upper bounds. Table 13 shows that the cycli-
cality measure for firm-level uncertainty is basically unaffected, but that its fluctuations might
be somewhat underestimated when measurement error is not taking into account. Conversely,
the last column of Table 13 shows that part of the observed cross-sectional dispersion in inno-
vations to both firm-level Solow residuals and value added might be measurement error. Nev-
ertheless, even when measurement error is taking into account, idiosyncratic uncertainty is
significantly larger than aggregate volatility.

2.4 External Validation
In this section we use an additional data set to confirm the countercyclicality of firm-level un-
certainty. Specifically, we make use of survey evidence on firms's general six-month-ahead busi-
ness outlook from the IFO institute in Germany to validate our findings from the USTAN data
set. One of the items in this monthly business survey is: "Expectations for the next six months:
our business situation with respect to XY20 will, in a cyclical view, improve, remain about the
same, develop unfavorably.". There is a widespread literature which argues that (qualitative)
survey disagreement is a good proxy for true firm-level uncertainty, see, for instance and for
an overview, Fuss and Vermeulen (2004). We make use of this idea and compute a firm-level
uncertainty index as follows, where p+
t
denotes the fraction of firms that see their business out-
look improve in a given month, and p-
t
the fraction of firms that see their business outlook
deteriorate:
Uncer taint yIFO
t
= p+
t
+ p-
t
-(p+
t
- p-
t
)2.
20The IFO survey is at the product category level, multiproduct firms can fill out more than one questionnaire.
17
If all responders think their business situation will improve, this index will be minimized at
zero, if they split in half about their business outlook, this index will be maximized at unity.
Two issues arise, when comparing the IFO evidence to the USTAN data. First, the IFO insti-
tute conducts this survey in four major sectors: manufacturing, construction, retail and whole-
sale. Due to limited data availability in the German system of national accounting we combined
the latter two into one trade sector for the analysis of the USTAN data. However, as Table 24
in Appendix A.1 shows, roughly 60% of the USTAN observations in the trade sector are from
wholesale, which is why we use the IFO wholesale data in our comparison with the USTAN trade
sector. Secondly, the IFO data are available on a monthly basis ­ looking six months ahead ­,
whereas the USTAN are annual. Thus, some time aggregation of the uncertainty index is nec-
essary. We use the simple year average of Uncer taint yIFO
t
as our baseline case.21 Table 14
displays our findings:22
Table 14: COMPARISON USTAN AND IFO
Sector (std(log i,t ),Uncer taint yIFO) (Uncer taint yIFO,HP(100)-Y )
Manufacturing 0.642 -0.525
Construction 0.396 -0.606
Wholesale 0.536 -0.519
Retail 0.0767 -0.294
Notes: See notes to Tables 2 and 3.
It shows in the first column the correlation between the dispersion of USTAN firm-level
Solow Residual innovations and the IFO uncertainty index, and the correlation between the
latter and the cyclical component of aggregate output in the second column. The correlation
between the two measures of firm-level uncertainty is remarkably high, in particular for the
manufacturing sector, which the majority of the firms in the IFO survey belong to.23 Given the
smaller numbers of firms in the construction and the trade sector, which is further complicated
by the imperfect match to the USTAN trade sector, a small decline in correlation there is not
surprising. And the second column shows again the very consistent countercyclicality of this
alternative firm-level uncertainty measure. These findings give us further confidence in the
robustness of our findings in the USTAN data set.
21We experiment with semi-annual and differently timed averages as well as the June uncertainty index of a given
year. The results are robust
22Figure 14 in Appendix B.1 displays the appropriately normalized time series of the dispersion of firm-level
Solow residual innovations from USTAN and the IFO uncertainty index for the manufacturing, construction and
wholesale sectors. The comove remarkably well.
23According to IFO personnel there are, on average, roughly 3400 firms from manufacturing, 1900 from retail and
wholesale and 1100 from construction participation in the survey every month.
18
In Table 38 in Appendix B.1 we provide further robustness checks for our results. In all these
robustness checks we find a strongly countercyclical productivity risk with relatively small cycli-
cal fluctuations in this risk. Next, we explore the quantitative implications of our three findings:
large idiosyncratic uncertainty, countercyclical fluctuations in and relatively low volatility of
this uncertainty, in a heterogeneous firm dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with
fixed cost of capital adjustment.
3 The Model
In this section we describe our model economy. We start with the firm's problem, followed by
a brief description of the households and the definition of equilibrium. We conclude with a
sketch of the equilibrium computation. Our model follows closely Khan and Thomas (2008)
and Bachmann et al. (2008). Since there the model set up is discussed in detail, we will be
rather brief here.
The main departure from either papers is the introduction of a second exogenous aggregate
state. Following Bloom (2009) we assume that firms today observe the standard deviation of the
distribution of idiosyncratic productivity shocks tomorrow, ( ). Following Khan and Thomas
(2008), we approximate this now bivariate aggregate state process with a discrete Markov chain.
3.1 Firms
The economy consists of a unit mass of small firms. We do not model entry and exit decisions.
There is one commodity in the economy that can be consumed or invested. Each firm produces
this commodity, employing its pre-determined capital stock (k) and labor (n), according to the
following Cobb-Douglas decreasing-returns-to-scale production function ( > 0,  > 0,  + <
1):
y = z kn, (1)
where z and denote aggregate and firm-specific (idiosyncratic) technology, respectively.
The idiosyncratic technology process has autocorrelation I . It follows a Markov chain,
whose transition matrix depends on the aggregate state of its time-varying standard deviation,
( ). In contrast, its support is independent of the aggregate state. To also capture observed
excess kurtosis in the idiosyncratic productivity shocks, we use a mixture of two Gaussian dis-
tributions in the Tauchen-approximation algorithm instead of the usual normal distribution.24
24Tauchen (1986). For details, see Section 4.
19
We denote the trend growth rate of aggregate productivity by (1-)(-1), so that aggregate y
and k grow at rate -1 along the balanced growth path. From now on we work with k and y (and
later C) in efficiency units. The linearly detrended logarithm of aggregate productivity levels as
well as linearly detrended ( ) evolve according to a VAR(1) process, with normal innovations v
that have zero mean and covariance :
logz
( )- ¯
( )
= A
logz
( )- ¯
( )
+ v, (2)
where ¯
( ) denotes the steady state standard deviation of idiosyncratic productivity inno-
vations.25
Productivity innovations at different aggregation levels are independent. Also, idiosyncratic
productivity shocks are independent across productive units. In contrast, we do not impose
any restrictions on  or A  R2×2.
Each period a firms draws from a time-invariant distribution, G, its current cost of capital
adjustment,   0, which is denominated in units of labor. G is a uniform distribution on [0, ¯
],
common to all firms. Draws are independent across firms and over time, and employment is
freely adjustable.
At the beginning of a period, a firm is characterized by its pre-determined capital stock, its
idiosyncratic productivity, and its capital adjustment cost. Given the aggregate state, it decides
its employment level, n, production and depreciation occurs, workers are paid, and investment
decisions are made. Then the period ends.
Upon investment, i, the firm incurs a fixed cost of , where  is the current real wage rate.
Capital depreciates at a rate . We can then summarize the evolution of the firm's capital stock
(in efficiency units) between two consecutive periods, from k to k , as follows:
Fixed cost paid k
i = 0:  (1-)k +i
i = 0: 0 (1-)k
Given the i.i.d. nature of the adjustment costs, it is sufficient to describe differences across
firms and their evolution by the distribution of firms over ( ,k). We denote this distribution by
µ. Thus, z,( ),µ constitutes the current aggregate state and µ evolves according to the law
of motion µ = (z,( ),µ), which firms take as given.
25Specifying this process in terms of log ( ) , in order to avoid negativity of the standard deviation of idiosyn-
cratic productivity shocks is ­ given its high steady state value and relatively low variability ­ an unnecessary pre-
caution that does not change the results. Simulation results are available upon request.
20
Next we describe the dynamic programming problem of each firm. We will take two short-
cuts (details can be found in Khan and Thomas, 2008). First, we state the problem in terms of
utils of the representative household (rather than physical units), and denote by p = p(z,( ),µ)
the marginal utility of consumption. Second, given the i.i.d. nature of the adjustment costs,
continuation values can be expressed without explicitly taking into account future adjustment
costs.
Let V 1( ,k,;z,( ),µ) denote the expected discounted value--in utils--of a firm that is in
idiosyncratic state ( ,k,), given the aggregate state (z,( ),µ). Then the expected value prior
to the realization of the adjustment cost draw is given by:
V 0( ,k;z,( ),µ) =
¯

0
V 1( ,k,;z,( ),µ)G(d). (3)
With this notation the dynamic programming problem is given by:
V 1( ,k,;z,( ),µ) = max
n
{CF+max(Vno adj,max
k
[-AC+Vadj])}, (4)
where CF denotes the firm's flow value, Vno adj the firm's continuation value if it chooses inaction
and does not adjust, and Vadj the continuation value, net of adjustment costs AC, if the firm
adjusts its capital stock. That is:
CF = [z kn -(z,( ),µ)n]p(z,( ),µ), (5a)
Vno adj = E[V 0( ,(1-)k/;z ,( ),µ )], (5b)
AC = (z,( ),µ)p(z,( ),µ), (5c)
Vadj = -ip(z,( ),µ)+E[V 0( ,k ;z ,( ),µ )], (5d)
where both expectation operators average over next period's realizations of the aggregate and
idiosyncratic shocks, conditional on this period's values, and we recall that i = k - (1 - )k.
Also,  denotes the discount factor of the representative household.
Taking as given (z,( ),µ) and p(z,( ),µ), and the law of motion µ = (z,( ),µ), the
firm chooses optimally labor demand, whether to adjust its capital stock at the end of the pe-
riod, and the optimal capital stock, conditional on adjustment. This leads to policy functions:
N = N( ,k;z,( ),µ) and K = K ( ,k,;z,( ),µ). Since capital is pre-determined, the optimal
employment decision is independent of the current adjustment cost draw.
21
3.2 Households
We assume a continuum of identical households that have access to a complete set of state-
contingent claims. Hence, there is no heterogeneity across households. Moreover, they own
shares in the firms and are paid dividends. We do not need to model the household side in
detail (see Khan and Thomas (2008) for the details), and concentrate instead on the first-order
conditions to determine the equilibrium wage and the marginal utility of consumption.
Households have a standard felicity function in consumption and (indivisible) labor:
U(C,Nh) = logC - ANh, (6)
where C denotes consumption and Nh the household's labor supply. Households maximize the
expected present discounted value of the above felicity function. By definition we have:
p(z,( ),µ) UC (C,Nh) =
1
C(z,( ),µ)
, (7)
and from the intratemporal first-order condition:
(z,( ),µ) = -
UN (C,Nh)
p(z,( ),µ)
=
A
p(z,( ),µ)
. (8)
3.3 Recursive Equilibrium
A recursive competitive equilibrium for this economy is a set of functions
,p,V 1,N,K ,C,Nh, ,
that satisfy
1. Firm optimality: Taking , p and  as given, V 1( ,k;z,( ),µ) solves (4) and the corre-
sponding policy functions are N( ,k;z,( ),µ) and K ( ,k,;z,( ),µ).
2. Household optimality: Taking  and p as given, the household's consumption and labor
supply satisfy (7) and (8).
3. Commodity market clearing:
C(z,( ),µ) = z kN( ,k;z,( ),µ)dµ -
¯

0
[K ( ,k,;z,( ),µ)-(1-)k]dGdµ.

¯

0
J K ( ,k,;z,( ),µ)-(1-)k dGdµ,
where J (x) = 0, if x = 0 and 1, otherwise.
5. Model consistent dynamics: The evolution of the cross-section that characterizes the econ-
omy, µ = (z,( ),µ), is induced by K ( ,k,;z,( ),µ) and the exogenous processes for
z, ( ) as well as .
Conditions 1, 2, 3 and 4 define an equilibrium given , while step 5 specifies the equilibrium
condition for .
3.4 Solution
As is well-known, (4) is not computable, since µ is infinite dimensional. Hence, we follow
Krusell and Smith (1997, 1998) and approximate the distribution µ by its first moment over
capital, and its evolution, , by a simple log-linear rule. In the same vein, we approximate the
equilibrium pricing function by a log-linear rule discrete ­ aggregate state by discrete aggregate
state:
log ¯
k =ak z,( ) +bk z,( ) log ¯
k, (9a)
logp =ap z,( ) +bp z,( ) log ¯
k, (9b)
where ¯
k denotes aggregate capital holdings. Given (8), we do not have to specify an equilibrium
rule for the real wage. As usual with this procedure, we posit this form and check that in equilib-
rium it yields a good fit to the actual law of motion. We use this simple forecasting rule because
it is much less computationally involved than a rule that includes higher moments of the capi-
tal distribution. In models without second moment shocks, it has been extensively shown that
the first moment suffices. Unfortunately, we show here that the pure R2 goodness-of-fit metric
does not favor the simple rule (9a): R2 below 0.9 are possible, as we shall see in Section 5.2.
However, we show for our baseline calibration that the aggregate dynamics of the economy are
hardly affected, when higher moments of the capital distribution are included and the R2 are
pushed closer to unity (see Bachmann et al. (2008) for a similar observation). Therefore, we
prefer the increase in computational speed and report our results, unless otherwise noted, with
the first moment only as a state variable.
23
Combining these assumptions and substituting ¯
k for µ into (4) and using (9a)­(9b), we
have that (4) becomes a computable dynamic programming problem with policy functions
N = N( ,k;z,( ), ¯
k) and K = K ( ,k,;z,( ), ¯
k). We solve this problem via value function
iteration on V 0.
With these policy functions, we can then simulate a model economy without imposing the
equilibrium pricing rule (9b), but rather solve for it along the way. We simulate the model
economy for 1,600 time periods and discard the first 100 observations, when computing any
statistics. This procedure generates a time series of {pt } and {¯
kt } endogenously, with which as-
sumed rules (9a)­(9b) can be updated via a simple OLS regression. The procedure stops when
the updated coefficients ak z,( ) and bk z,( ) , as well as ap z,( ) and bp z,( ) are
sufficiently close to the previous ones. We skip the details of this procedure, as this has been
outlined elsewhere ­ see Khan and Thomas (2008) and Bachmann et al. (2008).
4 Calibration
4.1 Baseline
The model period is a year ­ in congruence with the data frequency in USTAN. The following
parameters have standard values:  = 0.98 and  = 0.094, which we compute from German
national accounting data for the sectoral aggregate that the USTAN sample corresponds to: the
non-financial private business sector. Given this depreciation rate, we pick  = 1.014, in order to
match the time-average aggregate investment rate of 0.108. This number is also consistent with
German long-run growth rates. The log-felicity function features an elasticity of intertemporal
substitution (EIS) of one. The disutility of work parameter, A, is chosen to generate an average
time spent at work of 0.33: A = 2 for the baseline calibration.
We set the output elasticities of labor and capital to  = 0.5565 and  = 0.2075, respectively,
which correspond to the measured median labor and capital shares in manufacturing in the
USTAN data base (see Appendix A.4). While our data also include a considerable amount of
firms from other sectors, any weighted average or median of these shares would still be close to
the manufacturing values, which is why we decided to use them in our baseline calibration.26
Next, we have to choose the parameters of the two-state aggregate shock process. Here we
simply estimate a bivariate, unrestricted VAR with the linearly detrended natural logarithm of
26If one views the DRTS assumption as a mere stand-in for a CRTS production function with monopolistic com-
petition, than these choices would correspond to an employment elasticity of the underlying production function
of 0.7284 and a markup of 1
+
= 1.31. Given the regulated product markets in Germany, this is a reasonable value.
The implied capital elasticity of the revenue function,

is 0.47. We have experimented with both elasticities
quite a bit, but have not found any of our main results depending on them. Details are available on request.
24
the aggregate Solow residual27 and the linearly detrended ( )-process from the USTAN data.28
The parameters of this VAR are as follows:29
A =
0.4474 -3.7808
0.0574 0.7794
 =
0.0146 0.1617
0.1617 0.0023
(10)
When measurement error in firm-level Solow residuals is taken into account, as specified in
Section 2.3, the driving force looks as follows:
A =
0.4510 -2.8283
0.0765 0.7034
 =
0.0147 0.1688
0.1688 0.0031
(11)
This process is discretized on a [5 × 5]-grid, using a bivariate analog of Tauchen's proce-
dure. We measure the steady state standard deviation of idiosyncratic technology innovations
as ¯
( ) = 0.1201. Since these innovations also exhibit mild excess kurtosis ­ 4.4480 on average
over our time horizon ­,30 and since the adjustment cost parameter ¯
 will be identified by the
kurtosis of the firm-level investment rate (next to its skewness), we want to avoid attributing
excess kurtosis in the firm-level investment rate to nonlinearities in the adjustment technology,
when the driving force itself has kurtosis. Hence, we incorporate the measured excess kurtosis
into the discretization process for the idiosyncratic technology state.31 Finally, we set I = 0.95,
in accordance with the high persistence of Solow residual innovations in the data. This process
is discretized on a 19-state-grid, using Tauchen's procedure with mixed Gaussian normals.
Given the aforementioned set of parameters ,,, A,,, A,, ¯
( ),I , we then calibrate
the adjustment costs parameter ¯
 to minimize a quadratic form in the normalized differences
between the time-average firm-level investment rate skewness produced by the model and the
data, as well as the time-average firm-level investment rate kurtosis:32
27We use again  = 0.5565 and  = 0.2075 in these calculations.
28After firm-level and sectoral fixed effects have been removed.
29With a slight abuse of notation, but for the sake of readability,  displays standard deviations on the main diag-
onal and correlations on the off diagonal. We also estimate a seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) specification
of this bivariate VAR and use it for simulation. This specification mitigates somewhat the obvious problems with
estimating a bivariate VAR with 7 independent parameters from 2×26 data points. We show that both the actual
estimates of the remaining VAR parameters as well as the implications for our simulation results are remarkably
robust. Results can be seen in Table 40 in Appendix B.2.
30We find no skewness.
31We achieve this by using a mixture of two Gaussian distributions: N(0,0.0777) and N(0,0.1625) ­ the standard
deviations are 0.1201±0.0424 ­ with a weight of 0.4118 on the first distribution.
32The normalization constants in (12) are, respectively, the time series standard deviation of the investment rate
skewness and the time series standard deviation of the investment rate kurtosis.

As can be seen from (12), the distribution of firm-level investment rates exhibits both sub-
stantial positive skewness ­ 2.1920 ­ as well as kurtosis ­ 20.0355. Caballero et al. (1995) doc-
ument a similar fact for U.S. manufacturing plants. They also argue that non-convex capital
adjustment costs are an important ingredient to explain such a strongly non-Gaussian distribu-
tion, given a close-to-Gaussian shock process. We therefore use the deviation from Gaussianity
in firm-level investment rates to identify ¯
.
The following Table 15 demonstrates identification of ¯
, as cross-sectional skewness and
kurtosis of the firm-level investment rates are both monotonically increasing in ¯
. The mini-
mum of the distance measure  is achieved for ¯
 = 0.3, our baseline case.33 This implies costs
conditional on adjustment equivalent to 15.4% of annual firm-level output on average, which
is well in line with estimates from the U.S. (see Bloom, 2009). With measurement error in i,t ,

 = 0.25.

4.2 Variants of the Driving Processes
The empirical analysis has shown a negative comovement between the dispersion of firm-level
Solow residual innovations and aggregate Solow residuals. The dynamics of this comovement ­
as in (2) and (10) ­ imply that one variable conveys information about the future development of

the other. In other words, a shock to idiosyncratic uncertainty affects aggregate activity not only
through the option value channels highlighted by Bloom (2009) and Bloom et al. (2009), but also
as a news shock in the spirit of Beaudry and Portier (2006), Jaimovich and Rebelo (2008), Sims
(2008) as well as Schmidt-Grohe and Uribe (2008). Upon observing an increase in idiosyncratic
uncertainty today, households and firms rationally expect a future decrease in productivity ce-
teris paribus.
To disentangle the effects from the news about productivity contained in movements in
idiosyncratic uncertainty, we solve a variant of our model where the actual risk that firms face
remains constant over time at ¯
( ) = 0.1201, but firms still observe a time-varying state, s, as a
variable without further economic content that nonetheless contains information about future
productivity as in (2). The parameters that describe the law of motion of s are the same as
in (2) and (10), i.e. as in the model with time-varying uncertainty. More generally, we can re-
parameterize the model for the standard deviation of idiosyncratic productivity shocks, ( ), as
follows:
( ) = ¯
( )+ s - ¯
( ) .
For  = 0, idiosyncratic uncertainty remains constant and in the following we use the term
`News Model' to describe this parametrization. The second state no longer influences actual
risk, but only the conditional expectation of future aggregate Solow residuals, z . The baseline
specification in which idiosyncratic uncertainty fluctuates as well is termed `Full Model',  = 1.
Using an  > 1 we can scale up the fluctuations in idiosyncratic uncertainty without changing
the underlying dynamics of the exogenous state variables, i.e. keeping the news content of s
constant. Moreover, for comparison we consider a model with a standard univariate AR(1) pro-
cess for the aggregate Solow residual, `RBC Model', and a specification, where the only driving
force of business cycles are shocks to idiosyncratic uncertainty, `Risk Model'.34
5 Results
5.1 Baseline Results
Our main set of quantitative results can be summarized as follows: 1) Fluctuations in idiosyn-
cratic uncertainty alone do not produce business cycle dynamics as observed in the data. 2)
Adding orthogonal shocks to idiosyncratic uncertainty into a model with first-moment shocks
to aggregate Solow residuals hardly changes the business cycle dynamics of the model. 3)
Adding shocks to idiosyncratic uncertainty that comove with aggregate Solow residuals in a

vations 0.0182. The corresponding moments for the univariate risk process are: 0.5685 and 0.0028.
27
way observed in the data produces mild changes in the business cycle dynamics of the model,
which we attribute to the bad news effect that uncertainty shocks have for aggregate produc-
tivity in the future. This bad news effect is embodied in the negative VAR coefficient (see 10) of
tomorrow's (but known today) firm-level uncertainty on tomorrow's aggregate Solow residual.

Business cycle statistics of aggregate output, Y , consumption C, investment I and employment N. N in the model
includes the amount of labor used to adjust the firms' capital stocks. All variables are logged and then HP-filtered
with a smoothing parameter of 100. The first numbers in a column refer to a simulation of the model over T =
1500 periods. Numbers in brackets refer to German aggregate NFPBS data (see Appendix A.1, Footnote 49, for a
detailed description of sources). Volatility is percentage standard deviation. Persistence refers to the first order
autocorrelation.
Table 16 shows that the pure `Risk Model', in which the only driving force of business cycles
is fluctuations in uncertainty, yields little fluctuations. Output fluctuations are almost eight
times smaller than in the data, investment fluctuations just below 50% of the volatility in the
data. The uncertainty fluctuations in the data are simply too small ­ with a time series coef-
ficient of variation of 2.67% ­ to generate realistic business fluctuations. This finding is only
mildly changed, when measurement error in firm-level Solow residuals is taken into account
as described in Section 2.3. Even though the coefficient of variation of uncertainty fluctuations
now increases by roughly three quarters to 4.72%, aggregate fluctuations become only some-
what stronger. We also note that general equilibrium price movements are partly responsible
for this low volatility, as the volatility of output, investment and employment increases, respec-
28
tively, to 0.63%, 4.28% and 0.63%, i.e. more than doubles in a simulation, where we fix real
wages and real interest rates to their average value from the general equilibrium simulation.35
This shows that general equilibrium is important for understanding the aggregate implications
of idiosyncratic uncertainty innovations and that previous work in partial equilibrium might
have neglected an important channel. Finally, in terms of contemporaneous correlations with
output, pure uncertainty shocks lead to a counterfactual de-coupling of consumption and out-
put, which is accompanied by negative correlations between consumption on the one hand and
investment and employment on the other. We conclude that uncertainty shocks alone cannot
produce business cycles in an flexible price and market clearing model, augmented with per-
sistent idiosyncratic productivity shocks and fixed capital adjustment costs.
We also experimented with mechanically and counterfactually doubling and quadrupling
the uncertainty fluctuations, ( = 2 and  = 4), and found that this leads to an almost linear in-
crease in all volatilities of the pure `Risk Model', whereas persistence and correlations with out-
put and consumption are practically unchanged.36 This is a perhaps surprising finding: just as
with first moment shocks, increasing the volatility of idiosyncratic shocks essentially amounts
to re-scaling the model generated fluctuations. Consequently, we would need to observe un-
certainty fluctuations that are roughly eight times as large as the fluctuations we observe in
the data, in order for fluctuations in idiosyncratic uncertainty alone to produce realistic output
volatility. This number would then be close to the volatility of uncertainty that based on stock
market data has been suggested by Bloom (2009) for the U.S.: roughly 17%. However, it is un-
likely that we underestimate the risk fluctuations by such an order of magnitude. In fact, as we
have shown, the volatility of firm-level uncertainty only increases by a factor of 1.75 when mea-
surement error is accounted for. Moreover, none of our different sample splits or robustness
checks find an increase in the volatility of uncertainty by more than a factor of two relative to the
baseline specification. To the contrary, as Table 7 in Section 2.3 shows, the service sector ­ still
underrepresented in the USTAN data ­ exhibits less volatile uncertainty fluctuations than the
goods-producing industries. Thus we should expect to have over- rather than underestimated
the volatility of uncertainty fluctuations for the overall economy, especially if we extrapolate to
other countries like the U.S., where it is well-known that the tertiary sectors comprise a much
larger share of aggregate output and employment in the U.S., compared to Germany.
Risk Model and RBC Model
Although we do not find realistic business cycles caused by uncertainty fluctuations alone,
they might well alter more standard first-moment-driven cycles. Therefore, as a next step, we
briefly compare the `Risk Model' with the simple `RBC Model',37 and include a specification,
35These numbers are not reported in a table. Details for the partial equilibrium case are available on request.
36This holds for both specifications, i.e. with and without measurement error. Details are available on request.
37We keep the calibrated adjustment costs fixed across the variants for the driving process. This is justified, since

Notes: See notes to Table 16. `RBC-Risk Combination' refers to a simulation, where we simply combine the two
univariate processes for aggregate Solow residuals and idiosyncratic uncertainty, as specified in Footnote 34.
where we mechanically combine the two univariate processes for aggregate Solow residuals
and idiosyncratic uncertainty, as specified in Footnote 34. This variant is referred to as `RBC-
Risk Combination'. It gives a first indication, whether second-moment shocks as found in firm-
level data can alter the aggregate dynamics of a standard `RBC Model'. Table 17 shows that this
is ­ with one small exception ­ not the case: the `RBC Model' displays second-moment statistics
very similar to the combined one: `RBC-Risk Combination'. Not even the notoriously too high
contemporaneous output correlations are significantly mitigated by this second, independent
shock. Put differently, the characteristic features of the `Risk Model' vanish as soon as uncer-
they were calibrated to the steady state investment rate distribution, which is at least numerically invariant to the
specification of the driving process. That means, by the `RBC Model' we really mean a model with fixed capital
adjustment costs and shocks to aggregate Solow residuals only. De facto, however, the calibrated adjustment cost
level is so low that our baseline model is in the neutrality range explored by Khan and Thomas (2008).
30
tainty shocks are combined with standard aggregate Solow residual innovations. Only the con-
temporaneous correlations between aggregate consumption on the one hand and aggregate
investment and employment on the other are pushed downward, closer to the data.
Perhaps surprisingly, the overall volatility of the `RBC Model' is too high, relative to the data.
In Table 20 in Section 5.2 we show that fixing the excess volatility of the model by re-scaling the
volatility of the first-moment shock ­ to give the second moment shock maximum chance ­ so
as to match the observed volatility of aggregate output does not change our main results.
Otherwise, the `RBC Model' displays the well-known and typical failures: low persistence,
too high contemporaneous correlations with output and the wrong mix between relative con-
sumption and investment volatility, the former being too low, the latter too high. What matters
here that neither the `Risk Model' alone nor, as we shall see, in combination with first-moment
shocks fixes these failures in a satisfying manner. Of course, there are well-known additions to
the `RBC Model', such as quadratic adjustment costs for capital on top of the fixed ones, or sim-
ply higher fixed adjustment costs, that would help to ameliorate its performance, but we aim
here for cleanliness of exposition and view these issues as mainly orthogonal to the question,
whether shocks to idiosyncratic uncertainty matter for aggregate dynamics.
Full Model and News Model
Integrating our empirical findings a bit further into the model simulations, we extend the
driving process (2) such that it incorporates the correlation structure between firm-level uncer-
tainty and aggregate Solow residuals found in the data. We proceed in three steps. First, we
introduce in the `RBC Model' the aggregate driving process estimated in the data, (10), but set
 = 0, i.e. s has no actual implications for firm-level uncertainty. Also, we allow firms' policy
functions to depend only on aggregate productivity z. We call this specification `Naive Model',
because firms could actually use s to get better forecasts about aggregate productivity. Second,
we lift the latter assumption and allow firms to condition their optimal policy on s as well as z.
The state s still has no implications for firm-level uncertainty, it merely helps to forecast aggre-
gate productivity tomorrow. This variant ­ the aforementioned `News Model' ­ adds the news
character of uncertainty fluctuations to the model. Third, we explore the effect of uncertainty
fluctuations, setting  = 1. This specification is called `Full Model'.
Comparing `Full Model' and `RBC Model', we find that the standard business cycle statistics,
volatilities, autocorrelations and correlations, change only modestly, see Table 18. As for au-
tocorrelations, most of the change is mechanically due to the different driving process, as the
persistence improvements happen, even when agents do not use the news content of uncer-
tainty shocks (`Naive Model'). The same holds partially true for the increase in the volatility of
aggregate output.38 In other words, the excess volatility in output, featured in the `RBC Model',
38Of course, in general equilibrium this change is not purely mechanical, because the change in aggregate dy-
namics alters the Krusell-Smith rules, and therefore there is an indirect effect of news on agents' decisions.

Notes: See notes to Table 16. The `Naive Model' is a simulation, where the realized aggregate shock process is

residuals. ME designates the measurement error specification from equation (11).
is actually exacerbated when introducing the further state s. However, not all differences are
mechanic to the driving process. We can see that agents using the information content of the
second underlying state leads to altered relative volatilities, which is marked by the change from
the `Naive Model' to the `News Model'. Yet only in the case of the relative volatility of employ-
ment, the `Full Model' actually brings improvement over the `RBC Model'. However, the overall
change from the `RBC Model' to the `Full Model' is not due to the specific nature of the sec-
ond state being time-varying uncertainty and thus generating time-varying option values, but
rather due to its news character for aggregate productivity: changes in uncertainty alter the con-
ditional expectations of aggregate productivity. Hence, an increase in risk acts as a (bad) news
shock. This bad news is embodied in the negative VAR coefficient of tomorrow's (but known to-
32
day) firm-level uncertainty on tomorrow's aggregate Solow residual, see (10).39 Finally, the last
panel of Table 18 shows almost no changes in the contemporaneous correlations with output
and consumption. In particular, there is no decrease in the notoriously too high `RBC Model'
correlation coefficients, something that one might have hoped for with the introduction of a
second aggregate shock. In summary, there is little difference between the `Full Model' and
the `News Model'. This finding is robust to measurement error on the micro side, as the last two
columns of Table 18 show. Figure 2 illustrates this further by simply plotting a time series trajec-
tory of aggregate output simulations from both models for an identical bivariate shock series.
Both time series look very similar.

Uncertainty Shocks as News Shocks
To further understand the mechanisms behind the effect of shocks to idiosyncratic uncer-
tainty, we run a series of trivariate SVARs with one lag, where we augment the aggregate Solow
residual (ordered first) and the idiosyncratic uncertainty (ordered second) by a third variable:
aggregate output, the aggregate investment rate, aggregate consumption, aggregate saving, ag-
39We also estimate a SUR specification of this bivariate VAR and use it for simulation. We show that most of
the changes between the `RBC Model' and the `Full/News Model' are mainly due to the interaction effect between
aggregate Solow residuals and firm-level uncertainty. Results can be seen in Table 40 in Appendix B.2
33
gregate employment and hours as well as the real wage.40 We estimate these SVARs both from
the actual data for 1973 - 1998 and for 60 independent T = 26-samples from simulations of
both `Full Model' and `News Model'. With a series of impulse response functions, we show
first that `Full Model' and `News Model' are practically indistinguishable in their conditional
responses to shocks to idiosyncratic uncertainty.41 Secondly, we also show that ­ for the most
part ­ model and data impulse responses look very much alike, i.e. our model replicates the
empirical aggregate dynamics resulting from a shock to uncertainty. Finally, these impulse re-
sponses are exactly like the impulse responses to a bad news shock in a standard RBC model
with King-Rebelo-Plosser preferences (see Beaudry and Portier, 2006, Jaimovich and Rebelo,
2008 and Sims, 2008): output and investment increase, consumption decreases. The intertem-
poral wealth effect increases labor supply and this depresses the real wage. As the figures below
show, all these findings are robust to measurement error in the firm-level Solow residual.

Notes: Impulse response functions from SVAR estimations of the linearly detrended aggregate Solow residual (or-
dered first), the linearly detrended idiosyncratic uncertainty (ordered second) and HP(100)-filtered aggregate out-
put (ordered third). The dotted lines reflect 95% confidence bounds for the estimates from the data from 10,000
bootstrap replications. Estimates from data are in red, estimates from simulated data in blue (`Full Model') and
green (`News Model'), respectively. Estimates from simulated data are the average of 60 impulse response func-
tions estimated on 60 independent time series of T = 26, the length of our sample.
40We use a simple Cholesky decomposition, assuming the aggregate Solow residual has an instantaneous effect
on idiosyncratic uncertainty but not vice versa. This is to identify a pure innovation in contemporaneous uncer-
tainty. Notice that studying SVARs in this context is really studying and comparing an interesting summary statistic
between data and models. There is nor claim on causal empirical identification.
41The impulse responses with respect to an innovation to the aggregate Solow residual are available on request.
Except for the general excess volatility of our baseline calibration, data and model impulse responses are very
similar and theoretically reasonable. We take this as a good sign that our impulse responses with respect to a
second-moment shock are estimated reasonably well despite the short sample problems.

Figure 3 displays the impulse response of aggregate output to a shock to idiosyncratic un-
certainty. On impact, output goes up after an increase in uncertainty (larger dispersion of firm-
level productivity innovations in the following period), both in the model and in the data. So,
rather than causing an immediate recession, as has been argued in the literature on uncertainty
shocks thus far, a shock in idiosyncratic uncertainty causes a boom in output on impact. Then
the bad news is realized and the economy goes into a recession.

Notes: See notes to Figure 3. In this figure, the linearly detrended aggregate investment rate and HP(100)-filtered
consumption, respectively, are ordered third. The aggregate investment rate is the sum of NFPBS investment di-
vided by the average of the beginning-of-period and end-of-period aggregate capital stocks in NFPBS.
The left-hand panel of Figure 4 shows a similar expansion in the model aggregate invest-
ment rate as a response to an uncertainty shock, which is at least qualitatively consistent with
the data, given the wide confidence bands around the downward sloping point estimate.42 Of
course, the impulse response of aggregate investment features the excess volatility we have dis-
cussed above. In contrast, the right-hand panel of Figure 4 illustrates that the opposite is true for
the undershooting impulse response of aggregate consumption, which declines after a shock

to idiosyncratic uncertainty, because agents anticipate through it lower aggregate productivity
and therefore wealth in the future. One can (re-)interpret the quote by Blanchard from the in-
troduction in this context: higher uncertainty leads to a fall in consumption through a wealth
effect, which in turn shifts the supply of funds curve outward, lowering the real interest rate and
thus causing an investment increase on impact (of course in the current situation the economy
has arguably been hit also by contemporaneous negative first moment shocks, which is why we
would not necessarily observe this investment increase). Notice, however, that this is a very dif-
ferent mechanism from the wait-and-see interpretation of uncertainty increases that has been
proposed in the literature and that operates through time-varying real option values.

Notes: See notes to Figure 3. In this figure, HP(100)-filtered saving is ordered third.
Figure 5 shows this increase of saving in the model as well as the data response. Of course,
Germany is an open economy, and, thus, the impulse response of saving is really the correct
data counterpart of the impulse response of saving/investment in the model. An open econ-
omy means that aggregate investment can be financed from abroad and that the transmission
of the wealth effect onto investment is mitigated. The open economy response of aggregate in-
vestment is therefore closer to the negative partial equilibrium response that we show below in
Figure 8.

Notes: See notes to Figure 3. In this figure, the HP(100)-filtered real wage is ordered third. The real wage is aggregate
real payroll divided by the number of workers.
Consistent with the wealth effect both the data and the model impulse responses display an
increase in aggregate employment, whether it is measured in the data by number of workers or
aggregate hours (since the model features indivisible labor, this distinction is meaningless for
37
the model). This increase in aggregate labor inputs ­ and the output boom that is entailed ­ is
made possible by a decline in the real wage. The labor market response, which is typical for a
bad news shocks under standard preferences, is shown in Figures 6 and 7, respectively.
The final piece of the chain of arguments is displayed in Figure 8, which demonstrates that
the expansion in the aggregate investment rate as a response to a shock to idiosyncratic un-
certainty is a general equilibrium effect. The increase in investment is absent in partial equi-
librium, where we hold constant both wages and interest rates at their average level from the
general equilibrium simulation. With no increase in aggregate saving and thus a decrease in the
real interest rate, the expectation of lower future productivity drives down the expected return
on capital and hence investment.

Notes: See notes to Figures 3 and 4. `GE' stands for general equilibrium and means a model simulation with market
clearing wages and interest rates. `PE' stands for partial equilibrium and means a model simulation, where wages
and interest rates are held constant at the average level in the `GE'-simulation.
To summarize: quantitatively realistic uncertainty shocks have bad news effects in general
equilibrium, and it is this news effect that dominates the time-varying real option value effect.
This shows again that general equilibrium is paramount to understanding the aggregate impli-
cations of shocks to idiosyncratic uncertainty.

Notes: See notes to Table 16.
In this subsection we provide robustness checks for our simulation results along two di-
mensions. First, we double the volatility of firm-level uncertainty, while keeping its steady state
value fixed at 0.1201. This amounts to setting  = 2. Bloom (2009) uses a roughly seven times
more volatile firm-level uncertainty measure than we. While our empirical results are not con-
sistent with  = 7, they are consistent with a doubling of the volatility of uncertainty. We explore
this here. Second, we re-scale the volatility of the aggregate Solow residual so that the cyclical
component of aggregate output in the model matches roughly the volatility of aggregate output
in the data, in order to make sure that our results are not driven by the general excess volatil-
ity generated by the baseline specification. In particular, it could be that we falsely place too
much weight on first-moment shocks by overestimating their volatility. None of these changes
39
overturn our results, whether we control for measurement error or not. We display a further
robustness check in Table 39 in Appendix B.2, where we more than triple the adjustment costs
parameter, ¯
, and set it to unity. This is to check whether higher nonconvex adjustment costs
could give the wait-and-see effect are larger role. We find that this is not the case.43
If we increase the fluctuations in uncertainty, setting  = 2, the difference between `Full
Model' and the `News Model' becomes somewhat larger, see Table 19. Interestingly, the overall
volatility of the model decreases, the one of output from 4.04% to 3.84%, while the relative stan-
dard deviations are fairly robust to . This is a result of the mechanism highlighted in Bloom
et al. (2007): when uncertainty increases firms react less to first moment shocks. We show here
that this effect survives general equilibrium price movements. The performance of the `Full
Model' in terms of persistence is actually slightly worsened, while the contemporaneous corre-
lation of consumption and output, investment as well as employment drops to levels closer to
the data.44
The next robustness check concerns re-scaling the volatility of the aggregate Solow residual
by a factor of 0.6 in the `Full Model', in order to approximately match the observed volatility
of cyclical aggregate output in the data. We keep this re-scaling factor the same for the `News
Model' and the `RBC Model'. Despite the reduced importance of the first-moment shock both
the absolute and the relative volatilities of the `Full Model' and the `News Model' remain very
similar. As before in the case of an increased volatility of the firm-level uncertainty ­ which is
essentially a weakening of the first-moment shock from the other side ­, we see a deterioration
(with the exception of consumption) in the persistence numbers, but an improvement in the
contemporaneous correlation of consumption and output in the `Full Model' compared to the
data.
43We performed other robustness checks with respect to choices for the risk aversion parameter, I ,  and .
Details are available on request.
44We also experimented with  = 4. The changes we find for  = 2 are enforced. However, persistence of aggre-
gate investment and employment as well as the contemporaneous correlations between consumption on the one
hand and investment and employment on the other drop to counterfactually low levels. Moreover, Bachmann and
Bayer (2009) show that  = 4 is clearly incompatible with the procyclicality of investment dispersion found in the
micro data.

Higher Moments in the Krusell and Smith Rules
It remains to be shown that our results are not driven by the choice of only the average capi-
tal stock in the Krusell and Smith rules (9a) and (9b). While it is the case that in the presence of
countercyclical second-moment shocks the conventional R2-measure is fairly low for the `Full
Model' ­ at least in some combinations of the discrete aggregate states, the minimum is 0.8701
­, and while it is also true that including the skewness of the capital distribution in the Krusell
and Smith rules of the `Full Model'45 leads to an average increase of the R2 for the capital regres-
sions from 0.9378 to 0.9870 and for the marginal utility of consumption regressions from 0.9962
to 0.9986, the aggregate behavior of the `Full Model' is essentially unchanged. Better forecasts
45The `News Model' features high R2 over 0.9997 on any aggregate state with the average capital stock only. In-
cluding the standard deviation of capital does not yield any significant improvements in R2. The average R2 over
all discrete states for the skewness regression that is analogous to (9a) is 0.9261.

of capital skewness we include the standard deviation of log firm-level Solow residuals as an additional moment in
the Krusell and Smith rules. All findings are robust to including measurement error in the firm-level Solow residual.

6 Discussion and Conclusion
This paper studies the cyclical behavior of the second moments of the cross-sections of firm-
level innovations to Solow residuals, real value added and real sales. We show that firm-specific
Solow residual innovations (likewise innovations in value added and sales) are more disperse
in recessions than in booms. Thus, firm-level uncertainty is significantly and robustly counter-
cyclical in the way Bloom (2009) finds this for U.S. stock market and Compustat data. We also
show that the volatility of uncertainty is lower than has been previously found in this U.S. data.
We then explore the quantitative importance of these uncertainty fluctuations in an other-
wise standard heterogeneous-firm dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model in the spirit
of Khan and Thomas (2008) and Bachmann et al. (2008). We find that empirically realistic fluc-
tuations in uncertainty about productivity growth on their own are not sufficient to generate
realistic business cycles. Adding the second moment shocks to a model that has standard first
moment shocks, we find that some aspects of the cyclical behavior of the model are altered. For
the size of uncertainty fluctuations that we find in German firm-level data, we attribute these
changes largely to the (bad) news uncertainty shocks carry about future aggregate productivity,
rather than to the wait-and-see-effect of such fluctuations. In this context, we also find that
general equilibrium price dynamics are paramount in understanding the aggregate effects of
firm-level uncertainty shocks.
To sum up our findings: uncertainty shocks do not appear to be major drivers of year-to-year
business cycle fluctuations. This, however, leaves open the possibility that uncertainty shocks
are responsible for some particular episodes of the business cycle, recessions specifically. For
instance, one may wonder whether the recession in 2007 was driven by an uncertainty shock
and a wait-and-see amplification? The following Table 22 suggests that at least for the U.S. this
does not seem to be the case. It displays for various investment and consumption categories
the percentage peak-trough decline of the 2007 recession relative to the average percentage
peak-trough decline of the nine other post-war U.S. recessions. It is obvious that the 2007 re-
cession is amongst the most severe in U.S. post-war history; all macroeconomic aggregates fell
by an above-average amount. However, investment and durable consumption decreased by
relatively less than nondurable consumption categories. Whereas the former declined between
twice and thrice as much as in the average recession, the latter declined fivefold or twelvefold,
depending on the specific measure used. Also, whereas all durable categories saw some de-
cline in previous recessions (in seven out of ten durable consumption at the NBER trough was
lower than durable consumption at the NBER peak), the nondurable categories exhibited only
in roughly half of the recessions any decline at all. This obviously includes the 2007 recession.
All these statistics together show that the 2007 recession was especially severe for nondurable
43
consumption categories, whereas an uncertainty shock combined with a wait-and-see amplifi-
cation would at least suggest a particular severity for the durable expenditure elements. In fact,
the massive decline in nondurable consumption expenditures is rather consistent with a bad
news shock. Of course, this leaves open the possibility that other recessions in the past were
driven by the mechanism advocated in Bloom et al. (2009).

ables are real and in quarterly frequency. The first column reports the percentage peak-trough decline of the 2007
recession relative to the average percentage peak-trough decline of the nine other post-war U.S. recessions. Peak
and trough are defined by the official NBER recession dates. For the 2007 recession, we assume the trough to be in
the second quarter of 2009 owing to the lack of further data. The second column reports the number of recessions,
where the particular macroeconomic aggregate at the NBER trough was below its value from the NBER peak. The
third column reports the number of declines in the particular macroeconomic aggregate in a recession. There are
10 post-war recessions in the U.S.
In a companion paper (Bachmann and Bayer, 2009), using cross-sectional firm dynamics,
we provide further indirect evidence that the magnitude of uncertainty shocks over the busi-
ness cycle cannot be too large. We document there that the firm-level investment rates display
significantly and robustly procyclical dispersion. We explain this fact through a procyclical ex-
tensive margin effect caused by lumpy capital adjustment. However, we also demonstrate there
that increasing the volatility of firm-level uncertainty beyond the levels we find in the data miti-
gates this procyclical extensive margin effect. This allows us to bound the volatility of firm-level
uncertainty at at most double the value we measure in our baseline empirical specification.
Since we base our results on German data, we leave open the possibility that shocks to un-
certainty are a major driving force for the business cycle in the U.S. Bayer and Juessen (2009)
find for the cyclicality of wage risk striking differences between the U.S. and Germany, with the
former displaying countercyclicality (see also Storesletten et al., 2004) and the latter procyclical-
ity. Thus, there is the possibility of a fundamental difference between the German and the U.S.
business cycle, and we encourage future research in this cross-country dimension. However,
44
Table 22 and the finding that the service sector displays less strong countercyclicality of firm-
level uncertainty together with the fact that this sector is larger in the U.S. than in Germany sug-
gest otherwise. This is confirmed by Bachmann and Sims (2009), which uses monthly sectoral
survey data, i.e. higher frequency data than balance sheet information, on business expecta-
tions in Germany and the U.S. to show that disagreement in survey responses ­ a well-known
proxy for uncertainty ­ acts like a bad news shock in both countries without any evidence for
wait-and-see. We finally leave open the possibility that the dispersion shocks we measure in
the data can be a source of aggregate fluctuations in a significantly altered model environment;
for instance one, where the asset markets and their volatility are more explicitly modeled (see
Gilchrist et al., 2009, or Christiano et al., 2007). Also, Geanakoplos (2009) has proposed an in-
teresting mechanism ­ the leverage cycle ­ where uncertainty shocks have to accompany first-
moment shocks to transform `bad news' into `scary news'. We thus view future research into the
precise interaction between uncertainty and aggregate dynamics as desirable.

A Appendix A - Data Appendix
A.1 Description of the Sample
The Bundesbank's corporate balance sheet database (Unternehmensbilanzstatistik, USTAN
henceforth) has been originally created as a by-product of the bank's rediscounting activities, an
important instrument of monetary policy before the introduction of the Euro. When a commer-
cial bank wished to pledge a commercial bill of exchange to the Bundesbank, the commercial
bank had to prove the creditworthiness of the bill. For that purpose the bank had to provide
the Bundesbank with balance sheet information of all parties who backed the bill of exchange.
By law, the Bundesbank could only accept bills backed by at least three parties known to be
creditworthy. This procedure allowed the Bundesbank to collect a data set with information
stemming from the balance sheets and the profit and loss accounts of firms (see Stoess (2001),
von Kalckreuth (2003) and Doepke et al. (2005) for further details).
Quality standards of the data are particularly high. All mandatory data collected for USTAN
have been double-checked by Bundesbank staff. Hence, the data should contain unusually few
errors for a micro-data set. One drawback of USTAN is that with the introduction of the EURO,
the Bundesbank stopped buying commercial bills and collected firm balance sheet data only
irregularly and from publicly available sources. For this reason, the data set stops being useful
in 1999. Therefore, we only use data from 1971 to 1998, which leaves us with essentially 26 year
observations from 1973 to 1998 because of lagging and first-differencing.
The coverage of the sample is broad, although it is technically not a representative sam-
ple due to the non-random sample design. It was also more common to use bills of exchange
in manufacturing and for incorporated companies, which biases our data somewhat towards
these kinds of firms. And, of course, the Bundesbank would only rediscount bills with a good
rating, so that the set of firms in USTAN is also somewhat biased to financially healthy and
larger firms.
Nevertheless, USTAN covers a wide range of firms, since short-term financing through com-
mercial bills of exchange was common practice for many German companies across all busi-
ness sectors (see Table 24 below for the detailed sectoral composition of our final sample). US-
TAN also has a broad ownership coverage ranging from incorporated firms as well as privately
owned companies, which distinguishes it from the Compustat data. Within the former group
USTAN covers both untraded corporations (e.g. limited liability firms, GmbH) as well as pub-
licly held companies (AG) ­ see Table 27 below. Finally, USTAN features also a relatively broad
size coverage, as we will show in Table 25 below for our final sample, the creation of which we
describe in some detail now.
We start out with the universe of observations in the USTAN data, merging the files for
1971-1986 and 1987-1998. In a first pass, we then drop all balance sheets that are irregular,
49
e.g. bankruptcy or closing balance sheets, or stem from a holding (Konzernbilanz). This leaves
us with only regular balance sheets (Handelsbilanz or Steuerbilanz). We also drop all firms
with missing payroll data and missing or negative sales data, which are basically non-operating
firms. A small amount of duplicate balance sheets is removed as well. And finally, we drop the
following sectors: hospitality (hotels and restaurants), which has only a small amount of firms
in the database, financial and insurance institutions, the mostly public health and education
sectors, as well as other public companies like museums, etc. and some other small service in-
dustries, such as hair cutters, dry cleaners and funeral homes;47 or when sectoral information
was missing. The sectoral aggregate we are studying can be roughly characterized as the non-
financial private business sector in Germany. This leaves us with an initial data set of 1,764,846
firm-year observations and 259,614 firms. The average number of firms per year is 63,030.
From this initial data set we remove step-by-step more observations, in order to get an eco-
nomically reasonable data set. We first drop observations from likely East German firms to
avoid a break of the series in 1990. We identify a West German firm as a firm that has a West
German address or has no address information but enters the sample before 1990. Then we
recompute capital stocks with a modified perpetual inventory method (PIM) and employment
levels. In the modified PIM we drop a small amount of observations from the top and bottom
of the distribution of correction factors for the initial capital stock, see Appendix A.2. Extreme
correction factors indicate that constant depreciation is not a good approximation for this par-
ticular firm. Such a firm will have had an episode of extraordinary depreciation (e.g. fire, a
natural disaster, etc.) and the capital stocks by PIM will be a bad measure of the actual capital
after the disaster. We remove observations that do not have a log value added and a log capital
stock after PIM. Another large part is removed due to not featuring changes in log firm-level
employment, capital and real value added, which obviously requires us to observe firms for two
consecutive years. Then we remove outliers in factor changes and real value added changes.
Specifically, we identify as outliers in our sample a firm-year in which the firm level investment
rate or log changes in firm-level real value added, employment and capital stock fall outside
a three standard deviations band around the firm and sectoral-year mean. Then we compute
firm-level Solow residuals (see Appendix A.4 for details) and similarly remove observations with
missing log changes in Solow residuals as well as outliers therein. We finally remove ­ before and
after each step of the outlier removal ­ firms that have less than five observations in firm-level
Solow residual changes. We conduct extensive robustness checks of our results to the choices
for the outlier and observation thresholds (see Appendix B.1). Table 23 summarizes, how much
observations are dropped in each step.
47The number of firms from the public sector and these small industries is tiny to begin with, as they did not use
commercial bills as a financing instrument. We left out financial and insurance institutions, as they arguably have
a very different production function and investment behavior.

How well does the USTAN aggregate represent the non-financial private business sector
(NFPBS) in Germany? USTAN represents on average 70% of the value added of the NFPBS and
78% of its gross output.49 The NFPBS, in turn, comprises 59% and 69%, respectively, of aggre-
gate real value added and real gross output.
Figure 9 shows that except for a certain overrepresentation of manufacturing (at least, when
measured in value added) and a certain underrepresentation of the transportation and commu-
nication sector, USTAN represents the sectoral composition in NFPBS rather well.

Figure 10 demonstrates that also the cyclical behavior of USTAN and NFPBS is close. The
49 To compute these statistics we only average over the data from 1973 to 1990, because from then on German
national accounting does no longer report West and East Germany separately. For the business cycle statistics we
use the post-reunification data, but filter separately before and after this structural break. NFPBS value added is
taken from Bruttowertschoepfung in jeweiligen Preisen, table 3.2.1 of VGR, deflated year-by-year by the implicit
deflator for aggregate value added, table 3.1.1 of VGR (we apply the same deflator to USTAN data). The base year is
always 1991. We experiment also with implicit sector-specific deflators for value added from table 3.2.1 and 3.2.2
of VGR, and results are robust to this. NFPBS gross output is taken from Produktionswerte in jeweiligen Preisen, ta-
ble 3.2.3 of VGR, deflated year-by-year by the implicit deflator for aggregate gross output, gathered from table 3.2.6
of VGR. NFPBS investment is Bruttoanlageinvestitionen in jeweiligen Preisen from table 3.2.8.1, deflated with the
implicit sector-specific investment price deflators given by Bruttoanlageinvestitionen - preisbereinigt, a chain in-
dex, from table 3.2.9.1, VGR. NFPBS capital is Nettoanlagevermoegen in Preisen von 2000 from table 3.2.19.1, VGR,
re-chained to 1991 prices. In both the computation of investment and capital data for USTAN in the PIM we use
the implicit sector and capital good specific (equipment and non-residential structures) deflators for investment:
tables 3.2.8.2, 3.2.9.2., 3.2.8.3 and 3.2.9.3., VGR. We also experiment with deflating USTAN data with a uniform
investment price deflator, the Preisindex der Investitionsgueterproduzenten, source: GP-X002, Statistisches Bunde-
samt. NFPBS employment is number of employed, Arbeitnehmer, from table 3.2.13, VGR. Payroll is taken from
Arbeitnehmerentgelt, table 3.2.10., VGR, deflated by the same general implicit deflator for aggregate value added
that we use to deflate value added numbers. Aggregate total hours comes from Geleistete Arbeitsstunden der Ar-
beitnehmer, table 2.9, VGR. Finally, real private consumption data are private Konsumausgaben, a chain index with
base year in 1991, from table 3.2 in the VGR.

A.2 Capital Stocks
In order to obtain economically meaningful stocks of capital series for each firm, we have to
re-calculate capital stocks in a Perpetual Inventory Method (PIM). The first step is to compute
firm-level investment series, ii,t , from the corporate balance sheets, which contain data only
on accounting capital stocks, ka
i,t
, and accounting total depreciation, da
i,t
. The following accu-
mulation identity allows to back out nominal firm-level investment:51
ka
i,t+1
= ka
i,t
-da
i,t
+ pI
t
ii,t . (13)
The next step is to recognize that capital stocks from corporate balance sheets are not di-
rectly usable for economic analysis for two reasons: 1) accounting depreciation, da
i,t
, in cor-
porate balance sheets is often motivated by tax reasons and typically higher than economic
50We take first differences of log value added as well as gross output and then take out for both a deterministic lin-
ear trend to remove the growth of the USTAN sample over time. The correlation between only the first differences
in log value added is still 0.5348, and 0.4966, when an HP(100)-filter is applied.
51Specifically, ka
i,t
is the sum of balance sheet items ap65, Technische Anlagen und Maschinen, and ap66, Andere
Anlagen, Betriebs-und Geschaeftsausstattung, for equipment; and balance sheet item ap64, Grundstuecke, Bauten,
for structures. Since balance sheet data are typically end-of-year stock data, notice that ka
i,t
is the end-of-period
capital stock in year t -1. da
i,t
is profit and loss account item ap156, Abschreibungen auf Sachanlagen und imma-
terielle Vermoegensgegenstaende des Anlagevermoegens. In contrast to ka
i,t
, da
i,t
is not given for each capital good
separately. For the solution of this complication, see below.
54
depreciation, e
i,t
, expressed as a rate; 2) accounting capital stocks are reported at historical
prices. Both effects would lead to an underestimation of the real firm-level capital stock, if one
were to simply deflate the current accounting capital stock, ka
i,t
, with a current investment price
deflator, pI
t
(assuming that pI
t
increases over time). We therefore apply a Perpetual Inventory
Method (PIM) to compute economic real capital stocks:

is the accounting capital stock in prices of 1991 at the beginning of an uninterrupted
sequence of firm observations ­ if for a firm-year we have a missing investment observation,
the PIM is started anew, when the firm appears again in the data set. We estimate e
t
for each
year from national accounting data, VGR, separately for equipment and non-residential struc-
tures (table 3.1.3, VGR, Nettoanlagevermoegen nach Vermoegensarten in jeweiligen Preisen, Aus-
ruestungen und Nichtwohnbauten; table 3.1.4, VGR, Abschreibungen nach Vermoegensarten in
jeweiligen Preisen, Ausruestungen und Nichtwohnbauten). VGR contains sectoral and capital
good specific depreciation data only after 1991, which is why we decided to use only capital
good specific depreciation rates for the entire time horizon. For the data sources for invest-
ment price deflators see footnote 49. The drawback of this procedure is that we do not observe
directly capital-good specific da
i,t
in the balance sheets (differently from ka
i,t
), so that (13) is not
directly applicable for the two types of capital goods separately. We therefore split up da
i,t
ac-
cording to the fraction that each capital good accounts for in the book value of total capital,
weighting each capital good by its VGR depreciation rate. Creating a capital series for both cap-
ital goods this way is mainly meant to provide a better estimate for total capital for each firm,
because we finally aggregate up both types of capital into a single capital good at the firm-level.
There is a final complication, which comes through relying on ka
i,1
as the starting value of
the PIM. It is typically not a good estimate of the productive real capital stock of the firm at that
time. Therefore, we calculate the time-average factor  (for each sector), by which k(1)
i,t
is larger
than ka
i,t
, and replace ka
i,1
by ka
i,1
in the perpetual inventory method. We do this iteratively,
until  converges, i.e. we calculate:

where k(0)

, (0) = 1. We stop when for each sector and each capital good category  < 1.1.
Since for our purposes we want to compute economic, i.e. productive, capital stocks, we
then ­ as a final step ­ add to the capital stock series from this iterative PIM the net present
value of the real expenditures for renting and leasing equipment and structures.52
A.3 Labor Inputs
A more particular difficulty with USTAN data is that information on the number of employees is
only updated infrequently for some companies, as it is not taken directly from balance sheets,
but sampled from supplementary company information. Being no balance sheet item, the em-
ployment data is not constrained by legal accounting rules and did not undergo consistency
checks by Bundesbank staff. However, in order to compute firm-level Solow residuals, we need
some measure of employment.
We base this measure on the payroll data (wagebilli,t ) from the profit and loss statements
(item ap154, Personalaufwand). Payroll data is regulated by accounting standards and is checked
for consistency by the Bundesbank using accounting identities. In contrast to the direct em-
ployment data, the payroll data is generally considered of high quality. Therefore, we exploit
this data to construct a proxy measure for (log) employment ni,t as follows (with a slight abuse
of notation, we use ni,t here for log employment).
The idea behind our proxy measure is that we can determine sectoral average wages even
though firm level employment is measured with error. Since wage bargaining in Germany is
highly centralized, the sectoral average wage is all we need then, since it is a good proxy for firm
level wages. Therefore, dividing firm level payroll by the sectoral average wage recovers true
firm level employment.
52 Specifically, we take item ap161, Miet- und Pachtaufwendungen, from the profit and loss accounts, deflate it by
the implicit investment good price deflator, which we compute, in turn, from tables 3.2.8.1 and 3.2.9.1 from VGR,
and then divide it by a measure of the user cost of capital. The latter is simply the sum of real interest rates for a
given year, which - courtesy of the Bundesbank - we compute from nominal interest rates on corporate bonds and
ex-post CPI inflation data (the series is available from the authors upon request), and the time-average, accounting
capital-good weighted depreciation rate per firm.
56
Specifically, we assume that the measurement error in reported log employment, n
i,t
,53 is
classical and additive:
n
i,t
= ni,t +i,t . (19)
Then we decompose the wage per employee, i,t , of firm i at time t into two effects. One is
determined by a firm-time-specific wage component wi,t , and the other one being region-,
r (i,t), sector-, j (i,t), and size-class-specific, s (i,t), where j (i,t), r (i,t) and s (i,t) denote that
firm i belongs to sector j, region r and size-class s at time t, respectively.54 Thus, we write
i,t = ¯
wj(i,t),r(i,t),s(i,t),t + wi,t . (20)
We denote all firms that belong to sector j, region r and size-class s at time t by I j,r,s,t . Then
we can estimate a sector-region-size wage component, ¯
wj,r,s,t , as:55
¯
wj,r,s,t =
1
#I j,r,s,t
iI(j,r,s,t)
log wagebilli,t -n
i,t
. (21)
We then use this estimate of the average wage rate to estimate employment on the basis of the
firm's wage bill:
^
nit = logwagebillit - ¯
wj,r,s,t (22)
= nit +it -
1
#I j,r,s,t
hI(j,r,s,t)
nh,t
+h,t
- nh,t
+h,t
(23)
= nit + wit -
1
#I j,r,s,t
hI(j,r,s,t)
wh,t
-h,t
(24)
= nit + wit +
1
#I j,r,s,t
hI(j,r,s,t)
h,t
. (25)
The second equality stems from using (19). The next to last equality holds, because one can
replace it by (20), realizing that the ¯
w, which do not depend on a specific firm, cancel. The
last equality holds, because, by construction, the average firm-level deviation from a sector-
53We use item ap34, Beschaeftigtenzahl im Durchschnitt des Geschaeftsjahres, to measure n
i,t
, where available.
54Specifically, for sectors we use the 2-digit classification in Table 24 in Appendix A.1. For size classes we use
terciles of the capital distribution in each year. For the region-specific wage component we proceed as follows: we
divide West Germany into three regions, according to zip codes: South with zip codes starting with 7,8,9, except for
98 and 99; Middle with zip codes starting with 4,5,6, except for 48 and 59; North with zip codes starting with 2,3 as
well as 48 and 59. However, not all balance sheets feature zip code information, which is why we compute ¯
wj,r,s,t
with and without a region component. For those firms that do not have zip code information or for those firms
that are in sector-region-size bins with fewer than 50 observations in a given year, we take the estimate without the
region component.
55To estimate ¯
wj,r,s,t we of course use only those observations, where n
i,t
, i.e. item ap34, Beschaeftigtenzahl im
Durchschnitt des Geschaeftsjahres, is available.
57
region-size bin is zero in every year. For #I j,r,s,t large, the average measurement error term
1
#I(j,r,s,t) hI(j,r,s,t) h,t
is negligible. In addition, since wage bargaining is highly centralized
in Germany, also the firm specific wage component, wit , can be expected to be of lesser impor-
tance, i.e. the variance 2
w
is small. In particular it can be expected to be smaller than the initial
measurement error in employment stocks. Therefore our measure of employment, ^
ni,t , should
follow real employment, ni,t , more closely than n
i,t
.
To corroborate this claim, we checked our procedure using data from the German social
security records at the Institut fuer Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung (IAB), which provide in-
formation on the wage bill and employment at the establishment level. There we observe true
employment and wage bills for all plants and the time 1975-2006. Constraining ourselves to the
sample period 1975-1998 and to plants with more than 12 employees, i.e. to data comparable to
the one of the USTAN data, we find the correlation between ^
ni,t and ni,t as well as between  ^
ni,t
and ni,t to be fairly high (98% and 94%, respectively). This means that the cross-sectional vari-
ance of the firm specific wage innovations 2
w
is small (0.0026) compared to the cross-sectional
variance of employment changes (2
n
= 0.0163, 2
 ^
n
= 0.0162). Finally, a correlation coefficient
between mean(ni,t ) in the USTAN data and the log-change in aggregate NFPBS employment
of 0.653 shows also the quality of our employment measure.
A.4 Solow Residual Calculation
With the estimated firm-level capital stocks and employment levels we can now compute firm-
level Solow residuals from the logged production function (1). In our baseline specification we
estimate the factor elasticities,  and , as 1-digit sector-specific median, pooled over all firm-
year observations in a sector, expenditure shares.56 Table 28 displays the estimated elasticities.
Notice that for the aggregate Solow residual calculation for the baseline simulations, for which
we use the data sources specified in Footnote 49 in Appendix A.1, we simply use the expenditure
shares from manufacturing, as manufacturing is still the largest sector within NFPBS (had we
used any weighted median of expenditure shares the result would have been the same).
To check the robustness of our results, we also try alternative specifications with predefined
elasticities common across sectors. We first try a combination of  and , SR(2), such that a one
56We use profit and loss account item ap153, Rohergebnis, for firm-level value added and deflate it in the baseline
scenario with the aggregate value added deflator, but experiment also with sector-specific value added deflators,
see Footnote 49 in Appendix A.1 for details. To compute firm-level expenditure shares, we proceed as follows:
the labor share is simply total payroll divided by value added (ap154/ap153); capital expenditures, which are then
again divided by value added, are the sum of the PIM capital stock and the net present value of renting and leasing
expenditures multiplied by the user cost of capital as specified in Footnote 52 in Appendix A.2. For firm-level sales
we use profit and loss account item ap144, Umsatzerloese, and deflate it with the aggregate value added deflator.
For firm-level sales we use profit and loss account item ap151, Aufwendungen fuer Roh-, Hilfs-, und Betriebsstoffe
und fuer bezogene Waren, and deflate it again with the aggregate value added deflator.

third share of capital in a CRTS production function and a reduced form revenue elasticity of
capital of 0.5 are compatible. This implies an implicit markup of 1.33, if one were to rationalize
DRTS with a CRTS production function and monopolistic competition. We then either fix the
revenue elasticity of capital (SR5, SR3) or fix the one third share of capital in a CRTS production
function (SR6, SR4) and lower the markup. Table 29 summarizes the scenarios.

B.1 Further Robustness on the Empirical Results
Table 31 shows that the three main empirical findings of this paper ­ high idiosyncratic uncer-
tainty and countercyclicality as well as small volatility of idiosyncratic uncertainty ­ are robust
to both different pre-specified and uniform-across-sectors factor elasticities in the production
function as well as different lag structures in the production factors: Baselinevar1 assumes pre-
determined labor in addition to predetermined capital, whereas Baselinevar2 has both labor
and capital productive instantaneously. Tables 32 to 37 show the analogous results of Tables 5
to 9 and Table 12 in Section 2.3 for std(log yi,t ) and std(logsalesi,t ), respectively.

We next provide further evidence for the robustness of the three empirical findings of this
paper to sample selection and variable construction. First, we use sector-specific price deflators
for value added instead of the aggregate one (for sources see Footnote 49 in Appendix A.1). Sec-
ond, we use an aggregate price deflator for investment goods (see Footnote 49 in Appendix A.1
for details) in the perpetual inventory method instead of sectoral deflators separately for equip-
ment and structures. Third, we employ a stricter outlier removal criterion of 2.5 standard devi-
ations around the firm- and year-specific mean in Solow residual and value added innovations,
as well as investment rates and employment changes. Fourth, we use a more liberal outlier cri-
terion using 5 and 10 standard deviations instead of 3.57 Fifth, we employ a specification, where
we assume that an outlier above 3 standard deviations means a merger and, subsequently, treat
these firms as new firms in addition to removing them in the year, where the outlier occurs.
Sixth, we use all the firms that we observe at least twice with first differences.58 Finally, we carry
out a more standard perpetual inventory method that simply uses the reported capital stocks
in the first year of observation for a firm, instead of solving a fixed point problem in correction
factors (see Appendix A.2 for details). As one can see from Table 38, the results are robust to all
these alternative sampling procedures.
57The latter variant lowers the number of dropped firm-year observations due to outliers in factor and value
added changes from 41,453 to 4,240, and the ones due to outliers in Solow residual changes from 18,978 to 1,486.
This leaves the total number of firm-year observations at 934,315 and the total number of firms in the sample at
78,092.
58This lowers the number of dropped firm-year observations due to not satisfying the minimum observation
requirement from 417,550 to 158,950. This leaves the total number of firm-year observations at 971,308 and the
total number of firms in the sample at 114,528.

B.2 Further Robustness on the Simulation Results
In this subsection, we provide one further robustness on our three quantitative results: the
inability of the pure `Risk Model' to produce realistic business cycles; the small changes in the
second moment analysis that adding uncertainty shocks to a standard first moment shock `RBC
Model' brings; and the interpretation of these changes as largely due to a bad news effect that
uncertainty shocks entail. Specifically, (Table 39), we more than triple the adjustment costs
parameter, ¯
, and set it to unity. This is to check whether higher nonconvex adjustment costs
could give the wait-and-see effect are larger role. We find that this is not the case.
Finally, (Table 40), we compare the baseline results with the ones from a seemingly unre-
lated regressions (SUR) specification for the aggregate driving force, (2), i.e. a specification,
where the off-diagonal elements of A are restricted to zero. This is interesting for two reasons:
first, this specification mitigates somewhat the obvious problems with estimating a bivariate
VAR with 7 independent parameters from 2×26 data points. We show that both the actual es-
timates of the remaining VAR parameters as well as the implications for our simulation results
are remarkably robust. Secondly, Table 40 shows that most of the changes between the `RBC
Model' and the `Full/News Model' are mainly due to the interaction effect between aggregate
Solow residuals and firm-level uncertainty, that in the unrestricted baseline specification is em-
bodied in the negative VAR coefficient of tomorrow's (but known today) firm-level uncertainty
on tomorrow's aggregate Solow residual, an effect that we identified as a bad news effect.
