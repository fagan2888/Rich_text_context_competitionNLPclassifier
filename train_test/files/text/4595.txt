Introduction
This research shows that postelection surveys are a problem-
atic source for measuring value orientations, as national elec-
tions influence (in Australia suppress) the estimation of
postmaterial values. What I refer to here as "political contex-
tual" effects such as national election issues and the influence
of party leaders in championing or rejecting political issues at
an election (action on climate change is a contemporary
example) may have implications for the measurement of post-
material values. I contend that lengthy national election cam-
paigns in countries such as Australia and the United States
may produce the equivalent of what Inglehart refers to as
"period effects" (Inglehart, 1981, 1997; Inglehart & Welzel,
2005), and influence the estimation of postmaterial values.
Ronald Inglehart's thesis of the "Silent Revolution" of value
change is one of the most influential claims in political science
in more than 40 years. Inglehart (1971, 1977, 1990, 1997;
Inglehart & Welzel, 2005) argues that the value priorities of
citizens (i.e., their "broad societal goals") in advanced industri-
alized countries have been shifting since the end of World War
II, from concern over the economy and physical security
("materialism") toward an emphasis upon quality of life ("post-
materialism"). Inglehart's thesis is based upon two hypotheses
related to the concepts of scarcity and socialization.
Inglehart (1997) claims "[A]n individual's priorities
reflect the socioeconomic environment: one places the great-
est subjective value on those things that are in relatively
short supply" (p. 33). Influenced by Maslow's needs hierar-
chy (Inglehart, 1977), Inglehart (1997) argues that to sur-
vive, people must first have their basic material needs
satisfied, such as food, shelter, and physical safety. When
basic materialist needs have been satisfied and material secu-
rity is achieved, people are free to explore higher order
needs, such as improving their quality of life. Citizens of
affluent countries are increasingly likely to pursue higher
order goals leading "to a gradual shift in which needs for
belonging, esteem, and intellectual aesthetic satisfaction
became more prominent" (p. 34). In Inglehart's terminology,
citizens of affluent nations have become more "postmaterial-
ist." The socialization element of Inglehart's thesis suggests
that those born in advanced industrialized nations after World
War II have grown up under relatively affluent conditions
compared with their parents and grandparents. On average,
postwar generations are claimed to be far more postmaterial-
ist than their predecessors. This trend toward postmaterial-
ism has continued (Inglehart & Welzel, 2005), so that since
the end of the World War II, citizens of advanced industrial-
ized countries have become increasingly postmaterialist.

The Impact of Political Context on the
Measurement of Postmaterial Values
Bruce Tranter1
Abstract
This research highlights the influence of political context upon the measurement of postmaterial value orientations. Drawing
upon a variety of international survey data, Inglehart claims that since World War II a shift has occurred in advanced
industrialized nations from material toward postmaterial values. However, cross-sectional data from Australian Election
Study surveys collected over more than two decades indicate that atypically for an advanced democracy, Australian value
orientations tend toward the materialist pole. Australian Election Study values estimates are also at odds with those from
other national social surveys that portray Australia as a far more postmaterialist nation. Regression analysis demonstrates
that after controlling for election issues, attitudes toward political leaders, political party identification, and social background,
predicted values estimates are substantially more postmaterial than the raw estimates. The findings have international
implications as they suggest that measuring values during or soon after election campaigns may affect the measurement of
postmaterial value orientations.

These patterns are tendencies, as large proportions of citi-
zens are classified as "materialists" by Inglehart, but typi-
cally, younger cohorts in advanced democracies are more
postmaterial than their older counterparts, with the propor-
tion of postmaterialists increasing over time (Inglehart, 1997;
Inglehart & Welzel, 2005). Inglehart does not claim that
postmaterialists are non-materialistic or that they are not
concerned about physical security or the economy (Inglehart,
1997). Rather, with their material needs reasonably satisfied,
they are free to pursue postmaterial goals, such as supporting
environmental protection, human, women's, and minority
rights.
Measuring Value Orientations
Inglehart measures value orientations using two batteries of
survey questions. The first is referred to as the "four-item
index" or "short values index" consisting of questions that
ask respondents to prioritize four items. The short values
index is used extensively by survey researchers, for example,
in the World Values Surveys (WVS), the International Social
Science Program (ISSP) surveys, and the Australian Election
Study (AES) surveys.1
Critics of Inglehart often take issue with the way he mea-
sures value orientations, commonly attacking the validity of
the materialism­postmaterialism index (e.g., Bean &
Papadakis, 1994; Brown & Carmines, 1995; Clarke, 2000;
Clarke & Dutt, 1991; Clarke, Dutt, & Rapkin, 1997; Clarke,
Kornberg, McIntyre, Bauer-Kaase, & Kaase, 1999; D. W.
Davis & Davenport, 1999; Duch & Taylor, 1993, 1994;
Flanagan, 1982a, 1982b, 1987; Jagodzinski, 1982). For
example, Clarke and Dutt (1991) find high unemployment is
associated with increased levels of postmaterial values,
rather than decreases as the values change thesis predicts.
Duch and Taylor (1993) argue that the short values index
measures pro-democratic orientations, whereas Warwick
(1998) finds "that the original index registers support for
democratic principals in particular, and not simply a more
general postmaterialism" (p. 603). More recently, Clarke
(2000) maintains the short index is a "seriously flawed
instrument for measuring values and value change in
advanced industrial (and other) societies" because of its
"sensitivity to prevailing economic conditions" (p. 481),
whereas Tranter and Western (2010) suggest the short index
is subject to question order effects that influence estimates of
values orientations.
Nevertheless, Inglehart and his colleagues have defended
the value shift thesis vigorously (e.g., Abramson, Ellis, &
Inglehart, 1997; Abramson & Inglehart, 1994, 1995;
Inglehart, 1997; Inglehart & Abramson, 1994, 1999).
Inglehart (1997) maintains the short index "has proven to be
a very useful indicator of values" (p. 154) since 1970,
whereas Inglehart and Abramson (1994) contend that on "the
usual tests of validity" the index "has performed remarkably
well" and the "dimensional structure of the measure . . . has
a theoretically coherent structure across a wide range of
countries" (p. 350).2
Research Aims
This research is not a critique of Inglehart's values change
thesis per se, but attempts to show that estimations of post-
material values based upon Inglehart's widely applied
short values index are subject to the influence of political
events. The point of departure here is not in attacking the
conceptualization or measurement of postmaterialist value
orientations, but examining how Inglehart's values mea-
sures are influenced by important political issues and
leader effects that are present around national elections. I
contend that "political context" must be accounted for,
because, as Inglehart (1981) suggests, "Period effects"
(p. 887)--short-term influences on values such as varia-
tions in the inflation and unemployment rates--influence
the measurement of value orientations. Period effects may
suppress, or alternatively, boost levels of societal postma-
terial values at particular times, but according to Inglehart
do not influence the underlying values formed during early
socialization.
The posited effect examined here arises because of the
way in which value orientations are measured. Arguably,
all four items in the short index (see Appendix A), both
the materialist items "maintain order in the nation" and
"fight rising prices," and the postmaterialist items "give
people more say in important government decisions" and
"protect freedom of speech," are likely to be influenced
during election campaigns. The "maintain order" item
relates to bread and butter political issues and national and
state security. Although security issues are frequently of
concern to governments, they have become even more
salient in recent years with the so-called "war on terror-
ism." Similarly, border security is a highly publicized
issue in many affluent countries faced with increasing
numbers of refugees seeking asylum, such as Australia.
Inglehart's "rising prices" item is clearly associated with
inflation, but perhaps also more broadly with economic
management.
Importantly, all of Inglehart's question items tap perennial
political concerns. However, such concerns are increasingly
important and visible, even to less politically engaged citi-
zens, during national election campaigns when the voting
public is bombarded with mass media coverage of salient
political issues. For example, in recent federal election cam-
paigns in Australia, election issues included border security
(e.g., "turn back the boats") and economic management/cli-
mate change issues (e.g., "stop the carbon tax"; Bean,
McAllister, & Pietsch, 2014). Responses to relevant items on
the values index are therefore very likely to be influenced
during national elections.
The main aims of this research can be summarized in the
following research questions:
Tranter 3
Research Question 1: To what extent does "political con-
text" influence the measurement of postmaterial values?
Research Question 2: Can political influences account
for Australia's lower than expected levels of postmaterial-
ist values (i.e., as expected under Inglehart's values
change thesis)?
Data and Method
Data analyzed here are from the AES surveys from 1990 to
2013 (Bean, Gow, & McAllister, 1998; Bean, McAllister,
Gibson, & Gow, 2005; Bean, McAllister, & Gow, 2002;
Bean, McAllister, Gow, & Gibson, 2008; Bean et al., 2014;
Jones, Denemark, & Gow, 1993; Jones, McAllister, & Gow,
1990, 1996; McAllister, Bean, Pietsch, & Gibson, 2011;
Bean, McAllister and Pietsch 2014). These data are system-
atically sampled from the Australian Electoral Roll, a list of
all Australians registered to vote in federal elections. AES
surveys are administered via mail with several follow-up
strategies to maximize responses. Further details of these
surveys, including response rates, are available at the AES
site (http://aes.anu.edu.au/).
As mentioned above, Inglehart (1977, 1997) commonly
measures postmaterial values with a four-item question,
where respondents are asked to prioritize the two most
important aims of the nation. The values questions as they
appear in the AES are shown in Appendix A. In the WVS, the
short index items appear as the second set of questions in a
longer values battery. In the AES, the longer values battery is
administered on occasion, however, in such cases the short
index items appear first, in contrast to the WVS. This is a
preferable form of administering these questions, because as
Tranter and Western (2010) have shown, a question order
effect arises that tends to inflate levels of postmaterial values
when the short index questions appear in the middle of the
longer values battery.
Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is used in the
analyses below, following Abramson et al. (1997). Primarily
OLS is used here for ease of comparison of the results. The
strategy in the tables containing regression estimates below
is to first present what Inglehart (1997) refers to as the
"materialist-postmaterialist percentage difference index"
(PDI; p. 134) for various years. Several controls are then
introduced to adjust for aspects of social background--age
(years),3 sex (1 = men), and education level (1 = degree) and
the impact of political context.4 The rationale for the latter is
described in detail in the next section.
Technically, the intercept from the OLS regression mod-
els is analogous to the PDI. That is, the multiple regression
models estimate the PDI for each AES survey from 1990 to
2013, where the PDI-dependent variable is regressed upon
several independent variables to adjust for political context
at each federal election. PDI estimates from four regression
models are presented in Table 4 to show the adjusted PDI,
after controlling for social background (Model 1), political
issues (Model 2), leader thermometers (Model 3), and politi-
cal party ID (Model 4).5
Election Issues, Party Leaders, Party
ID, and Political Context
Measuring postmaterial values with data from election sur-
veys is potentially problematic when values are measured
with the short values index. That is, the issues discussed dur-
ing election campaigns may influence responses to the val-
ues index, because the issues that typically emerge during
election campaigns tend to be associated with the items com-
prising Inglehart's short index. For example, economic issues
almost always tend to be high on the agenda of political par-
ties in advanced industrialized nations. In Australia (and
elsewhere), border security has in the last decade or so been
an issue of contention for the major parties, both under the
conservative party leadership of current Prime Minister Tony
Abbott and John Howard before him (Devetak, 2004; Noble,
2005) and also under recent Labor governments led by Julia
Gillard and Kevin Rudd. Economic and security issues
should be associated with "materialist" values, as measured
by Inglehart's "maintain order in the nation" and "fight rising
prices" items.
Although the relative salience of election issues varies
from one election to the next, several issues have been
important during campaigns in the period under consider-
ation here (1990-2013). Data on these issues have been col-
lected in the AES during this period, with economic
management, and health and education the most important in
recent elections. The importance of taxation and (un)employ-
ment vary according to prevailing economic circumstances
while the environment (and more recently, global warming)
has also been a relatively important issue in recent years. For
example, during the "green" election of 1990 (Bean,
McAllister, & Warhurst, 1990), the 1990 AES indicates that
29% of those sampled chose interest rates as the issue of
greatest concern, 18% inflation, and 11% selected the envi-
ronment, taxation, and unemployment, respectively, whereas
only 9% selected health and 5% education in 1990. More
than 20 years later, data from the 2013 AES suggest that 25%
of the sample chose management of the economy as the most
important issue, followed by 17% who opted for health and
Medicare and 14% for education.
Although I am not able to offer a control/test experimental
design to examine the hypothesis that political context influ-
ences responses on the short values index, another way of
examining this hypothesized effect is to consider associations
between political issues and postmaterialism using data from
the most recent AES. A cross tabulation is presented using
data from the 2013 AES (Table 1). Based upon responses to
the question "Which of these issues was most important to
you during the election campaign?" it is apparent that "mate-
rialists" tend to prioritize economic issues (i.e., taxation,
management of the economy), whereas postmaterialists are
4 SAGE Open
more concerned with issues such as the environment, global
warming, and education. However, because election issues
tend to vary over time, as does the relative salience of peren-
nial issues, the election issue questions included in each AES
also vary, making consistent operationalization of election
issues problematic over time.6 The small number of relevant
election issue question items available for analysis across all
elections analyzed means that some measures of political
context are missed. I therefore also examine the influence of
three proxy variables of political context based upon voter
evaluations of major party leaders and political party
identification.
As the literature on political party identification indicates,
political leaders offer voters cues about complex political
issues. Party identification is claimed to form a "perceptual
screen through which the individual tends to see what is
favourable to his partisan orientation" (Campbell, Converse,
Miller, & Stokes, 1960, p. 133). Although the partisan
dealignment thesis suggests there has been a weakening of
partisan loyalties (Dalton, 1996; Dalton, Flanagan, & Beck,
1984), partisanship remains a powerful predictor of voting in
many countries (Bartels, 2000; Miller & Shanks, 1996), with
Gilens and Murakawa (2002) arguing that partisans take the
cues of political leaders more frequently than engage in
"substantive assessment of competing evidence and argu-
ments" (p. 21). In Australia, although the major parties both
vie for public acceptance as stewards of the economy, AES
data suggest the conservative coalition partners tend to have
greater public acceptance in terms of their credibility on eco-
nomic management. Labor has historically been associated
with stronger policies on health, education, and industrial
relations, and, along with the Australian Greens (although to
a lesser extent) with the environment. I contend that feelings
thermometer variables that measure voter evaluations of
political party leaders, to an extent also capture variations in
the political issues that are prioritized from one election to
the next. In addition to the four issue priority variables, the
political leader variables act as supplementary measures of
political context at each federal election.
The AES presents a variety of possibilities for measuring
voter evaluations of respective political leaders. Questions
have been included in all AES from 1990 onwards regarding
the qualities of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the
Opposition (and on occasions, other political leaders). Such
questions ask respondents to rate leader qualities such as
their honesty, intelligence, strength of leadership, knowl-
edge, trustworthiness, competence, and so on. However,
these questions have not been asked in a consistent manner
over time, so that only relatively few comparable items
appear in all AES from 1990 to 2013. Alternatively, "feelings
thermometer" questions have appeared in every election sur-
vey from 1990 onwards. For example, the "feelings ther-
mometer" questions from 1990 ask,
We would like to know your feelings about the party leaders.
Please show how you feel about them by circling a number from
0 to 10. 10 is the highest rating, for people you feel very
favorable about, and 0 is the lowest rating, for people you feel
very unfavorable about. If you are neutral about a particular
person or don't know much about them, you should give them a
rating of 5.
How do you feel about: Bob Hawke? How do you feel about:
Andrew Peacock?
For analytical consistency, the feelings thermometer vari-
ables are operationalized to measure the impact of political
leaders upon value orientations at each federal election.
Although these questions ask what voters "feel" about the
major party leaders and do not capture the multidimensional-
ity of leadership qualities, they serve as a useful proxy vari-
able to capture voter evaluations of leaders. Evidence of this
is apparent in the high correlations between multiple item
composite leader scales constructed from various leader
quality items and the single item 0 to 10 scales. For example,

composite scales constructed from items measuring Labor
and Coalition leader characteristics using 2010 AES data
have strong Pearson's correlations with the party leader ther-
mometers (i.e., the Pearson's r for the coalition leader vari-
able is .76 and Labor leader is .78).7 Feelings thermometer
variables for the Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition
at each federal election are therefore used as an additional
measure of political context in the analyses that follow. This
approach has the advantage of applying consistent indicators
to capture the influence upon value orientation estimates of
the two most important major party leaders at each federal
election.
Similarly, it is important to add political party identifica-
tion as a control for "rusted on" partisans who may be aligned
with particular election issues. Party identification is opera-
tionalized as Liberal and National party supporters scored 1;
other parties and the non-aligned scored 2 and Labor identi-
fiers scored 3. Placing the Australian Greens at the midpoint
of the party ID scale given they are a party of the postmate-
rial left (Charnock & Ellis 2004; Western & Tranter, 2001) is
potentially problematic here. The Greens formed as a national
party in 1992. However, while a "Greens" party ID response
category was included in the 1990 AES, it was omitted in
1993, although the number of respondents identifying as
Greens continued to be very low throughout the 1990s.
Therefore, once again for consistency, Green identifiers are
coded to the midpoint of the party ID scale.
Analyses
Table 2 shows the percentage responses for materialists,
postmaterialists, and those who hold mixed values based
upon AES data from 1990 to 2013. Inglehart's (1997) PDI is
calculated to gauge the relative levels of postmaterial versus
material values. Positive PDI results suggest that the propor-
tion of postmaterialists is greater than the proportion of
materialists in a given election year, with negative PDI indi-
cating a preponderance of materialists over postmaterialists.
According to these results, Australia is not and has never
been a "postmaterialist" country during the period examined
here. The negative PDI of ­12.2 for 1990 suggests that
Australia was quite a materialist country around 20 years
ago, although became less so throughout the 1990s. In 1996
and 1998, the proportions of materialists and postmaterialists
were evenly balanced. However, in the new millennium, the
results indicate that Australia has been shifting back to the
materialist pole, so that in 2007 and 2010 it was even more
materialist than two decades earlier.
These results are not necessarily contrary to what is
expected according to Inglehart's thesis. Inglehart allows for
fluctuations in value priorities due to changing economic cir-
cumstances (e.g., increases to inflation rates) that he refers to
as "period effects," and claims that these may have a short-
term impact upon the PDI. Yet he argues that serious social
and economic events such as major wars or economic depres-
sion (or their lack) shape the value orientations of genera-
tions, particularly during their "formative years."
Furthermore, the values change thesis implies that younger
people tend to become more materialist than their parents if
they experience severe long-term economic downturns or
threats to their physical security during their formative years.
However, neither of these scenarios appears to explain the
Australian case.
Australia, with its strong economy and having arguably
benefitted from the economic stimulus package introduced
by the Rudd Government, has enjoyed relatively favorable
economic circumstances since the recession of the early
1990s and appears to have been relatively insulated from the
global financial crisis (GFC). Although these results indicate
that the GFC has had an impact upon PDI in Australia,
reflected in the 2007 and 2010 estimates, the move back
toward materialism appears to have begun even earlier, as is
apparent in the dips toward the materialist pole in 2001 and
2004 compared with 1998. Although the country could be
classified as most materialist in 2007 and 2010, it remains a
materialist country in 2013.
However, other national survey data suggest thatAustralia
is a far more postmaterialist country than the AES data indi-
cate (Table 3). With the exception of the 2011 WVS data that
also likely reflect "period effects" due to the GFC, other ear-
lier WVS, AuSSA, and ISSP data suggest Australia tends
toward the postmaterialist pole. Nevertheless, the anomalous
values estimates from the 1994 ISSP and 1995 WVS require
comment. The former appears to under-represent materialists
and over-represent mixed values compared with other sur-
veys in this series, resulting in a slight postmaterialist PDI
for 1994. While the 1994 ISSP was also a mail out survey,
unlike other surveys in Table 3, the 1994 ISSP sample

comprises a panel from an earlier ISSP survey (Kelley,
Evans, & Bean, 1995), so panel attrition may have had an
impact upon the values estimates for 1994.8 There may also
be sampling and other issues underlying the extreme postma-
terial estimates for the 1995 WVS. The 1995 WVS values
questions were administered as part of the longer values
index, and as mentioned above, Tranter and Western (2010)
find that this approach inflates levels of postmaterial relative
to material values estimates. The sampling approach used for
the WVS is also potentially influential here.9 It is therefore
possible that question ordering effects and different sampling
strategies have contributed to the anomalous values results
for the 1995 WVS compared with other surveys in Table 3.
Nevertheless, data from the AES are at odds with those
from other national surveys that use similar mail out designs
and sampling frames (i.e., AES and AuSSA samples are both
drawn from the Australian Electoral Roll using systematic
sampling). What is clearly different is that the AES are post-
election surveys, and responses to the short values index
appear to have been influenced by election campaigns.
To what extent, then, do election issue priorities and
leader variables influence the PDI in the multivariate case,
that is, after controlling for known correlates of value orien-
tations, respondent sex, age, and educational achievement?
PDI for each election from 1990 onwards are presented in
Table 4. The results of four OLS regression models for each
year are also presented. The first model shows PDI after con-
trolling for sex (men 1, women 0), age (measured as a con-
tinuous variable in years), and degree (1/0). The second
model adds the four issue priority dummy variables, the third
model adds 0 to 10 major party leader "feeling thermome-
ters," and the fourth political party identification scale in
combination are included to adjust PDI for political context.
The results in Table 4 indicate that the background variables
in Model 1 have some impact upon the PDI, swaying the PDI
considerably toward postmaterialism in some years, such as
2004, but only minimally in others such as 1996. The intro-
duction of political issues variables in Model 2 tends to shift
the PDI back toward the materialist pole, although the shift
in some cases is modest. However, when the leader ther-
mometer variables are added to the regression equation in
Model 3, the regression estimates of PDI are far less materi-
alist than the original PDI.10 In fact after controlling for the
proxy measures of political context--political issues and
leader effects--the adjusted PDI for Australia becomes posi-
tive in six of the nine election years analyzed, compared with
the original estimates that were all negative. Overall, this
pattern persists after party identification is added (Model 4).

The regression results suggest that political context does
indeed influence the measurement of value orientations as
measured with Inglehart's short values index. In the
Australian case, for all the election surveys the PDI becomes
less materialist when political context is controlled, implying
that the measurement of value orientations during or soon
after election campaigns is potentially problematic. The
influence of political context upon value orientations is more
clearly demonstrated in Figure 1, where the PDI and adjusted
PDI are portrayed graphically over time.
Discussion
AES data collected between 1990 and 2013 indicate that the
postmaterialist difference index does not rise above zero
during these years, suggesting Australia is relatively "mate-
rialist" for an advanced industrialized country. As Inglehart
acknowledges (e.g., Inglehart, 1997; Inglehart & Welzel,
2005), the measurement of postmaterial values is influenced
by "period effects." Although generational replacement is
claimed to account for intergenerational shifts in value ori-
entations at the national level, Inglehart (1997) maintains,
[I]ntergenerational population replacement is not the only factor
involved: period effects, reflecting current conditions, also have
an impact--but the direction of their impact is predictable . . . a
major decline in the economic and physical security experienced
by a given society would tend to retard or reverse the effects of
intergenerational population replacement, and periods of
exceptional prosperity would tend to magnify the effects of
generational change. (p. 332)
The evidence from nine national election surveys from
Australia suggests that measuring postmaterial values
using postelection surveys influences the measurement of
postmaterial values, in a similar manner to the "period
effects" described by Inglehart. The influence of national
elections upon values is analogous to period effects
because many of the issues raised by political leaders dur-
ing campaigns and promulgated by communications media
are associated with, and influence responses to, items on
the short values index. In a sense this phenomenon is not
surprising, as the materialist items "maintain order in the
nation" and "fight rising prices," and the postmaterialist
items "protect freedom of speech" and "give people more
say in government decisions" could well have been
designed with election slogans in mind.
Tranter and Western (2009) find higher levels of post-
material values in polities with multiple parties, particu-
larly where green parties had gained national parliamentary
representation. This research also emphasizes the impact
of political contextual factors, showing that the timing of
survey administration also influences estimates of postma-
terial values. The evidence from Australia suggests that
measuring value orientations using postelection surveys
tends to suppress the postmaterial difference index toward
the materialist pole. This is demonstrated indirectly by
comparing values estimates from the AES surveys with
those from other reputable national surveys that were not
administered during federal election years, and also by sta-
tistically adjusting the postmaterial difference index to
control for political issues and major party leader effects.

Australia appears to be a "postmaterialist country" based
upon data from the WVS or the Australian Survey of Social
Attitudes, but is far more "materialist" based upon AES
data. Yet when important political variables are controlled,
Australia is located on the postmaterial end of the values
continuum in six of the nine election surveys analyzed
here, closer to where Inglehart's thesis predicts an advanced
industrialized country should be situated. While conten-
tious, Inglehart's short values index is a useful predictor of
social and political attitudes and behavior, although for
estimating value orientations in a cross-national context,
this research questions the comparability of values data
from the AES.
Although this research is based upon Australian data, it
has broader, implications for the study of value change
over time and cross-nationally. This study demonstrates
the influence of political factors upon the measurement of
postmaterial values in an advanced industrialized nation,
but also raises questions for further research. The short
values index is sensitive to economic and social issues--
economic recessions, high inflation and unemployment,
or social upheavals--so-called "period effects" (e.g.,
Inglehart, 1997; Inglehart & Welzel, 2005). Yet it seems
that salient political issues, such as economic manage-
ment, border security, perceived threats of international
terrorism, or politically divisive issues such as climate
change (e.g., see McCright & Dunlap, 2011; Poortinga,
Spence, Whitmarsh, Capstick, & Pidgeon, 2011; Tranter,
2011) and the leaders that champion such issues, also
influence the measurement of postmaterial values.
Although formal election campaigns may be relatively
brief, in countries such as the United States, congressional
campaigning is lengthy (Panagopoulos, 2013) and cam-
paign duration appears to be lengthening in countries such
as Australia. Long election campaigns should therefore be
considered as having the potential to impact upon the
measurement of postmaterial values. In light of this
research, the accuracy of postmaterial values estimates
would be enhanced by statistically controlling for politi-
cal contextual effects where possible, or avoiding the
measurement of value orientations during or soon after
national election campaigns.
Appendix A
Short (4-Item) Values Questions
Inglehart has frequently employed the four-item values bat-
tery, where respondents were asked a question similar to
the following form of the question as it appears in the 2013
AES.
"Next, a question about what you think the aims of
Australia should be for the next ten years. Here is a list of
four aims that different people would give priority.
If you had to choose among these four aims, which would
be your first choice? And which would be your second
choice?
1. Maintain order in the nation
2. Give people more say in important government
decisions
3. Fight rising prices
4. Protect freedom of speech"
Respondents who choose Options 1 and 3 were deemed
"materialists" and Options 2 and 4 as "postmaterialists."
Inconsistent value combinations were classified as "mixed"
(Inglehart, 1977, p. 28).
Long (12-Item) Values Questions
Here is a list of four aims that different people would give
priority. If you had to choose among these four aims, which
would be your first choice?And which would be your second
choice?
A. Maintain a high level of economic growth.
B. Make sure this country has strong defense forces.
C. See that people have more to say about how things are
done at their jobs and in their communities.
D. Try to make our cities and countryside more beautiful.
Here is another list of four aims. If you had to choose among
these four aims, which would be your first choice? And
which would be your second choice?
A. Maintain order in the nation.
B. Give people more say in important government deci-
sions.
C. Fight rising prices.
D. Protect freedom of speech.
And here is a further list. If you had to choose among these
four aims, which would be your first choice? And which
would be your second choice?
A. A stable economy
B. Progress toward a less impersonal and more humane
society
C. Progress toward a society in which ideas count more
than money
D. The fight against crime

Notes
1. A longer, 12-item version of the index appears in surveys
such as the World Values Surveys (WVS) and Eurobarometers
(Inglehart & Welzel, 2005), although for reasons of question-
naire space and cost, the longer index is used far less frequently
(see Appendix A).
 2. See Abramson (2011) for a comprehensive discussion of the
major critiques of Inglehart and his collaborators and their
responses to the critics.
 3. Although Inglehart argues that value orientations are genera-
tionally based, age cohort differences in values are very weak
in Australia (Tranter & Western, 2009). I therefore operation-
alize a parsimonious model that controls for age in years rather
than use age cohort variables.
4. Other potentially relevant controls such as income are not
available for all Australian Election Studies (AES), so for con-
sistency of the models over time, income is not included.

 6. Four items--"taxation," "education," "the environment," "health
and Medicare"--were included in all surveys from 1990 to 2013.
These are entered into the regression models as dummy variables.
The wording of two of these question items varied slightly across
surveys. In 1993, "taxation" was absent but "business tax" was
included as an election issue, so was substituted, whereas from
1996 onwards, "health" was listed as "health and Medicare."
 7. The questions were, "Here is a list of words and phrases peo-
ple use to describe party leaders. Thinking first about [leader
name], in your opinion how well does each of these describe
him/her--extremely well, quite well, not too well, or not well
at all?" The leader qualities were as follows: the leader is . . .
competent, compassionate, sensible, a strong leader, honest,
knowledgeable, inspiring, trustworthy. Both composite leader
scales had Cronbach's alpha coefficients of .93.
 8. The study description notes for the 1994 International Social
Science Program (ISSP) on the ISSP site suggest, "The panel
of respondents from the ISSS/A 1993 "Inequality II" survey,
which was in turn a panel on the earlier National Social Science
Survey "Family and Changing Sex Roles" and "Lifestyles"
surveys, conducted in late 1989 and early 1990. The sample
for the 1989-1990 surveys was a nationwide simple random
sample drawn from the (compulsory) Australian electoral rolls
by the Australian Electoral Commission. Potential respondents
were eligible for inclusion in the 1993-94 survey if they had
completed the 1993 survey, had not indicated that they did
not wish to participate further and were still contactable at the
same address. Number of Units in Original Sample: 2318."
(Kelley, Evans, & Bean, 1995)
9. The description on the WVS site suggests that the 1995
Australian survey was "self administered," yet according to
questionnaire documentation on the site, the 1995 WVS ques-
tionnaire was administered face-to-face by interviewers. A pri-
vate company, Roy Morgan Research (Melbourne), collected
the 1995 WVS data, as opposed to academic researchers who
undertook other surveys examined here. The documentation
accompanying the 1995 WVS does not provide a detailed
description of the sampling strategy used, but states, "The
sample was designed to be representative of the entire adult
population, that is, 18 years and older."
10. Pearson's correlations between the short values index (coded:
100 = materialist, 0 = mixed, 100 = postmaterialist) and the
issue priority variables and major party leaders "feelings ther-
mometer" variables (Appendix B) show weak associations
for issues measures, although considerable variation between
elections and estimate signs as issue salience fluctuates.
Although weak, the "taxation" correlations are all negative,
indicating taxation tends to be a material issue, whereas the
"environment," and to a lesser extent "education" are post-
material issues. Health and Medicare correlations varied only
minimally from zero. For the leader scale variables, with the
exception of a very weak association for 1990, postmaterialist
values correlations with Labor leaders tend to fluctuate, but are
more strongly and negatively associated with coalition leaders
over time. Coalition leaders are associated with the short val-
ues index to a much greater extent than Labor leaders.
