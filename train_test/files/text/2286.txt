Abstract
Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) conducted the World Health Survey (WHS) between 2002 and 2004 in
70 countries to provide cross-population comparable data on health, health-related outcomes and risk factors. The aim of
this study was to apply Grade of Membership (GoM) modelling as a means to condense extensive health information from
the WHS into a set of easily understandable health profiles and to assign the degree to which an individual belongs to each
profile.
Principal Findings: This paper described the application of the GoM models to summarize population health status using
World Health Survey data. Grade of Membership analysis is a flexible, non-parametric, multivariate method, used to
calculate health profiles from WHS self-reported health state and health conditions. The WHS dataset was divided into four
country economic categories based on the World Bank economic groupings (high, upper-middle, lower-middle and low
income economies) for separate GoM analysis. Three main health profiles were produced for each of the four areas: I. Robust;
II. Intermediate; III. Frail; moreover population health, wealth and inequalities are defined for countries in each economic
area as a means to put the health results into perspective.
Conclusions: These analyses have provided a robust method to better understand health profiles and the components
which can help to identify healthy and non-healthy individuals. The obtained profiles have described concrete levels of
health and have clearly delineated characteristics of healthy and non-healthy respondents. The GoM results provided both a
useable way of summarising complex individual health information and a selection of intermediate determinants which can
be targeted for interventions to improve health. As populations' age, and with limited budgets for additional costs for
health care and social services, applying the GoM methods may assist with identifying higher risk profiles for decision-
making and resource allocations.

Introduction
Currently, the concept of health as defined by the World Health
Organization (WHO) is ``a state of complete physical, mental and
social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity''
[1]. Taking this perspective, one moves beyond disease absence as
defining health status to one that incorporates the complex
perceptions about health and health conditions. Measuring the
multidimensional character of perceived health status, and then
using the results meaningfully, remains a challenge for policy and
research purposes. Many of the available analytical techniques used
to reduce variables, make assumptions about distributions or use
summary variables in the calculations. The alternative technique,
Grade of Membership (GoM) model, is presented in this paper.
GoM is a non-parametric method that identifies latent health
profiles and the degree to which an individual fits these profiles.
The GoM method has been applied in previous studies for
depressive symptoms and personality disorders [2,3,4], older adult
health status [5,6,7,8,9] and genetic health studies [10,11]. A
method that helps to define and predict transitions from robust
health to frailty or the reverse, as well as identify pre-disability
states would be helpful in planning for an ageing population
[12,13,14,15].
The WHO's World Health Survey (WHS) gather data to
quantify population health status in 70 countries based on WHO's
definition of health. The main aim of this study was to summarize,
using the Grade of Membership model, the full set of health and
health-related variables included in the WHS into a smaller set of
meaningful health profiles [16]. In order to make these derived
health profiles useful in helping to inform health policy, WHS data
have been grouped in four economic areas according to the World
Bank economic categories [17].
This paper is organized into three sections. First, a description
of the data set is provided, which includes details of the survey

design, socio-demographic characteristics of the sample and health
data. Then the GoM procedure and results of the GoM analysis
are described for each economic category. The final section
summarizes the results.
Materials and Methods
Data
The WHS was conducted between 2002 and 2004 in 70
countries to establish levels of health and to develop methods to
improve data comparability within and across countries [18,19].
The principal aim of the WHS was to provide valid, reliable and
comparable information about population health status. It used a
common survey instrument in nationally representative popula-
tions for assessing, amongst other issues, the health of individuals
in eight of the 22 explicit health domains, health system
responsiveness and household health care expenditures.
A probability sampling design was employed in each country
using multi-stage, stratified, random cluster samples. The
population included all selected persons aged 18 years and older
who lived in selected households. Most of the countries had
nationally representative survey samples and each country decided
which interview method to use: face-to-face interview, computer-
assisted telephone interview (CATI) and/or computer-assisted
personal interview (CAPI).
The WHS utilized two types of questionnaires: the Household
Questionnaire (to describe the health, economic physical character-
istics at the household level) and the Individual questionnaire (to
describe the individual health status and well-being characteris-
tics). In order to construct the final dataset, data was extracted
from the WHS Individual Questionnaire. The overall dataset was
then divided into four economic areas for the analyses based on
the World Bank categories: high income, upper middle income,
lower middle income and low income (Table 1).
The World Bank's uses gross national income (GNI) per capita
as its main criterion for classifying economies. Based on its 2006
GNI per capita, every country's economy was classified as low
income, middle income (subdivided into lower middle and upper
middle), or high income. The four groups are defined as: low
income, $905 or less; lower middle income, $906­$3595; upper
middle income, $3596­$11,115; and high income, $11,116 or
more.
Physical and mental health
The dataset included self-reported diagnosis of three physical
and one mental health condition (arthritis, angina pectoris, asthma
and depression), self-reported difficulties in functioning in eight
health domains (mobility, self-care, pain and discomfort, cogni-
tion, interpersonal relationships, vision, sleep and energy, and
affect) plus one self-reported overall health question. Presence or
absence of a diagnosed condition was based on self-report.
Grade of Membership method
Grade of Membership (GoM) model [20] is a flexible, non-
parametric, multivariate method, designed to identify health
profiles. In our work we used the self-reported health state and
health conditions in order to determine the latent profiles (pure

types) of health and the degree to which individuals correspond to
the identified profiles (grade of membership).
Briefly, as outlined in Manton et al [20], the GoM model
assumes there are K fuzzy states (pure types) to be defined. The
study population consists of I individuals with J categorical
variables, where the jth variable has Lj
response levels. Each Lj
response is encoded as a binary variable xijl
, so that if xijl
= 1 then
the ith individual has the lth response to the jth variable. A first
coefficient, lkjl
, concerns the likelihood of a response l to the jth
question by an individual belonging to the kth health pure type;
the second entity, gik
, represents weights quantifying the grade of
similarity of the health features of the ith individual with the
characteristics of each K pure types, with the following constraints:
0#lkjl
#1,

By summing over all potential GoM health pure types:

we obtain the probability that the ith individual responds l to

Assuming independence of individual observations, the likeli-

We used the DSIGoM software [21] to estimate the GoM
parameters. In particular the modified Newton-Raphson algo-
rithm was employed, where the coefficients gik
and lkjl
are
estimated simultaneously to maximize the likelihood function L.
The parameters are estimated iteratively: the L function is
maximized first with lkjl
fixed, producing an initial estimate of
all gik
; then using the obtained gik
the L function is maximized to
update the lkjl
, This process is repeated until convergence, where
the parameters are such that within-group homogeneity is
maximized and between-group homogeneity is minimized [20].
The optimal number of profiles is established by performing a
likelihood ratio test on the change in explanatory power between K
and K+1 model. This ratio is x2 distributed, with degrees of
freedom equal to the difference in the number of parameters to be
estimated between models [10].
Grade of Membership application
Prior to analyzing data, it was necessary to define the external
and the internal variables [10]. External variables do not affect the
definitions of the pure types and included five socio-demographic
variables (age, sex, marital status, education and employment);
however, the association between the pure types and the external
variables provides valuable information about the relationship
between empirically-derived pure types and demographic charac-
teristics. Turkey was not included in the dataset because the
external variable marital status was not available.
The continuous age variable was recoded into three categories:
younger adult (18­29 years); adult (30­59 years), and older adult
(60 years and older). Marital status was recoded into four
categories: never married, currently married/cohabiting, separat-
ed/divorced and widowed. Sex, education levels (highest level
completed) and sector of current employment (governmental, non-
governmental, self-employed, employer, homemaker, unem-
ployed, student, retired and other) were the remaining external
variables.
Internal variables included self-reported overall health (based on
a five point scale: very good, good, moderate, bad or very bad),
scores from the eight health domains (none, mild, moderate,
severe or extreme/cannot do), and the set of four reported
conditions (yes, no).
For each of the four country categories, the GoM analysis was
applied with 2, 3 and 4 pure types to test for the optimal number
of pure types. The GoM parameters estimation was derived using
the DSIGoM software. Log likelihood ratio test indicated that
three pure types provided the best description of the structure of
the variables included in this analysis for each economic area.
Each pure type was described by the values obtained for the l
coefficients. In general, lkjl
.0.50 was considered to be character-
istic of a pure type being endorsed by more than 50% of
individuals in that pure type. The lambda coefficients were
produced for each of the external and internal variables.
Additionally, the distribution of respondents' GoM scores (gik
)
was generated for each pure type and country category. The crude
prevalence estimates refer to the sum of individual membership in
the kth pure type, divided by the total number of respondents,
Prevalence~

N

,
where N is the total number of respondents, and gik
is the GoM
coefficient for the ith individual's degree of membership in the kth
pure type [4].
In order to compare the prevalence rates across the four groups,
age-standardized prevalence estimates were calculated. For each
pure type and economic category, age-specific (younger adult 18­
29, adult 30­59, and older adult 60+) prevalence ratios were
computed. To calculate adjusted age-specific prevalence rates we
used the direct standardization method with the WHO world
standard population table [22].
Results
Socio-demographic characteristics
The final dataset contained 217,472 respondents from 69
countries. These countries were grouped into the four World Bank
income categories for analysis. The socio-demographic character-
istics of the respondents are provided in Table 2.
Three country categories (high, upper-middle and lower-middle
income) had more women than the other group (low income),
although the subdivision between males and females is almost
symmetric for every region. More young respondents (aged 20­29
years) were noted in the upper-middle, lower-middle and low
income categories. The higher income categories had more old
respondents than the other groups. The low income category had
a higher percentage (8.1%) of the youngest respondents (aged 18­
19 years), while the high income category had the highest
percentage of older adults with 14.2% of individuals aged 70+
years. Respondents in the low income category were more likely to
be currently married (70%) and had the highest levels of
respondents with no formal education (40.1%). The high income
category had the highest education rate. Current employment
sector/issues differed by category: the two highest income
categories (high and upper-middle income) had more respondents
employed in the private sector (39.9% and 23.6% respectively).
The lower-middle income category had more homemakers and
self-employed (20.8% and 19.5%) while low income countries had

higher levels of self-employed (45.8%). The category with the most
retired respondents was the high income (13.8%). An association
between all socio-demographic characteristics and the four
economic country categories was found (p,0.0001).
Physical and mental health data
The internal variables in the GoM analysis included self-
reported physical and mental health data. Descriptive statistics of
these variables for the four economic categories were provided in
Table 3.
The majority of the respondents reported good or very good
health status for the self-reported overall general health question,
with the lower-middle income category having the highest
percentage of respondents reporting a bad or very bad health
status. In all the eight health domains (mobility, self-care, pain and
discomfort, cognition, interpersonal relationships, vision, sleep and
energy, and affect), the prevalence rates followed a positive trend.
The majority of the respondents (more than 50%) reported no
difficulties on any of the physical or mental health issues, with the
exception of the domain ``pain and discomfort'', where prevalence
rates ranged from 44.6% of lower-middle income category to
52.1% of high income group. Finally, over 85% of respondents
reported no diagnosed health conditions (arthritis, angina pectoris,
asthma and depression). Among these conditions, it was noted that

the low income category had the highest percentage (14.2%) of
respondents with arthritis, the lower-middle income group had the
highest percentage (8.1%) with angina pectoris, and the high
income category had the highest percentage with asthma and
depression (9.8% and 14.1%, respectively).
GoM parameters and pure type estimation
Table 4 provides a summary of the pure types/health profiles by
World Bank category. The components of pure types I (ROBUST)
and II (INTERMEDIATE) are very similar across all the
categories. Moving from type I to type II resulted in increasing
difficulty in some health domains, with respondents more likely
reporting ``moderate difficulty'' (INTERMEDIATE) instead of
``no difficulty'' (ROBUST) for the given health domain. The third
health profile, FRAIL, was again a distinctly lower level of health
based on difficulties with the health domains and presence of one
or more of the health conditions.
Similarly, the lambda probability variables for each of the
external variables by country category show discernable patterns
for each of the health profiles (Table 5).
High income economies

(N = 16,940) had a high grade of membership (gik
.0.50) to pure
type I. 25 percent of respondents (N = 6,648) belonged exclusively
to one of the three pure types. Most respondents from this high
income category (62.4%) belonged to the ROBUST profile (that
is, pure type I).
Table 7 shows the exact breakdown of the lambda probability
values for each pure type. Respondents belonging to pure type I
were equally distributed between men and women (lambda equal
to 49.8% and 50.2%, respectively), mainly adults (62.6%), married
or cohabiting (63.4%), intermediate or higher educated persons
(30.1% and 31.1%, respectively), and not government employed
(37.8%). They reported good health status (55%), had no
difficulties with physical and mental activities (100%) and none
of the four health conditions (lambda equal to 100% and 94.9%).
Individuals in pure type II differed from those in pure type I in
that they were mainly female (64.1%) and had some difficulty with
physical and mental activities, especially moving around (53%),
pain and discomfort (100%), concentration (100%), sleeping
(81.3%), feeling sad or depressed (100%).
Finally, respondents in pure type III were mainly female
(74.7%), old (68.9%), married or cohabiting (50.2%), less educated
(29.2%), and retired (52.9%). They reported moderate health

activities, especially moving around (65.2%), pain and discomfort
(65.3%), concentration (75.1%), sleeping (53.7%), feeling sad or
depressed (66.8%). Moreover they reported having arthritis
(61.5%) and depression (60.3%).
Upper-middle income economies
Table 8 includes the gik
coefficients for the 51,090 respondents
in the upper-middle income category. Almost 69 percent
(N = 35,209) had a high grade of membership (gik
.0.50) for pure
type I (ROBUST). Over 27 percent of respondents (N = 13,940)
belonged exclusively to a single pure type. Most respondents from
this region (62.3%) belong to the ROBUST health profile.
Table 9 shows the lambda coefficient distributions of external
and internal variables for each pure type. Respondents belonging
to the pure type I were male (lambda equal to 63.8%), mainly
adults (61.2%), married or cohabiting (65.5%), intermediate
education levels (41.1%) and were not government employed
(33.5%). They reported good health status (67.7%), had no
difficulties with physical and mental activities (100%) and did not
report any of the four health conditions (lambda equal to 100%
and 98.2%).
Individuals in pure type II were mainly female (60%), reported
moderate health status (70.4%) and had some difficulty with
physical and mental activities, especially moving around (54.6%),
pain and discomfort (100%), concentration (100%), sleeping
(100%), feeling sad or depressed (100%).
Respondents in pure type III were mainly female (76.3%), old
(55.3%), married or cohabiting (47.9%), intermediate or lower
education levels (24.2% and 25.3%, respectively), and retired
(46.5%). They reported moderate health status (62.7%) and had
more difficulty with physical and mental activities, especially
moving around (65.3%), pain and discomfort (66.6%), concentra-

and had arthritis (52.6%).
Lower-middle income economies
Table 10 presents the distribution of gik
scores for the 58,799
respondents from the lower-middle income category. Almost 64
percent of respondents (N = 37,537) had a high grade of
membership (gik
.0.50) for pure type I. Twenty-two percent
(N = 13,019) were exclusively in one pure type and 58.2 percent
were in the ROBUST profile.
Table 11 shows the exact breakdown of the lambda probability
values for the external and internal variables in each pure type.
Respondents that belonged to the pure type I were male (lambda
equal to 53.7%), mainly adults (56.4%), married or cohabiting
(64.2%), lower education levels (26.3%), and not government
employed (27.1%). They reported good health status (61.7%), no
difficulties with physical or mental activities (lambda equal to
100% and 98.2%) and did not report any of the four health
conditions (lambda equal to 100% and 98%).
Individuals in pure type II were mainly female (66.9%),
homemakers (31.5%), reporting moderate health status (71.2%)
and with some difficulty with physical and mental activities,
especially moving around (100%), pain and discomfort (100%),
concentration (100%), personal relationships (56.7%), seeing and
recognizing persons (55.6%), sleeping (100%), feeling sad or
depressed (100%).
Finally, respondents in pure type III were mainly female
(70.3%), adults (47.6%), married or cohabiting (58.5%), not
educated (34.4%), and homemakers (28.6%). They reported
moderate health status (56.6%) and had more difficulty with
physical and mental activities, especially moving around (70.1%),
pain and discomfort (62%), concentration (68%), personal
relationships (43.9%), seeing and recognizing persons (42.6%),
sleeping (63.8%), feeling sad or depressed (63%); but did not report
any of the four conditions.
Low income economies
Table 12 shows the distribution of gik
scores for the 81,225 low
income category respondents. Sixty-five percent (N = 53,151) of
respondents had a high grade of membership (gik
.0.50) in pure
type I (ROBUST) and over 25 percent (N = 20,667) of respondents
were exclusively in one pure type. Overall, 58 percent of low

income respondents belonged to the ROBUST profile (pure type
I).
Table 13 shows the lambda coefficient distributions of external
and internal variables for each pure type. Respondents belonging
to pure type I were male (lambda equal to 53.4%), young or adults
(lambda equal to 47.8% and 50%, respectively), married or
cohabiting (70.7%), not educated (30.2%), and self-employed
(52.1%). They reported good health status (52.1%), no difficulties
with physical and mental activities (100%) and none of the four
health conditions (100%).
Respondents in pure type II were mainly female (60.1%),
reported moderate health status (56.7%) and had some difficulty
with physical and mental activities, especially moving around
(100%), pain and discomfort (100%), concentration (100%),
personal relationships (54%), sleeping (100%), feeling sad or
depressed (100%).
Finally, respondents in pure type III were mainly female
(64.5%), adults (51.5%), married or cohabiting (65.2%), not
educated (65.8%), and self-employed (35.3%). They had moderate
health status (56.8%), more difficulty with physical and mental
activities, especially moving around (60.4%), self-care (46.5%),
pain and discomfort (59.8%), concentration (63.9%), sleeping
(59.3%), feeling sad or depressed (57.5%), and arthritis (51.8%).
Age-standardized prevalence ratios of pure type I by economic
category indicate similarity between the high and upper-middle
income countries (both over 62%) and the lower-middle and low
income countries (both less than 59%). Likewise, the two higher
income categories had less than 16% membership in the FRAIL
pure type whilst the lower-middle and low income countries had
higher rates (21.8% and 19.2%, respectively).

GoM Profiles of Health Status
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 11 February 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 2 | e4426
Discussion
This paper described the application of the Grade of
Membership models to summarize population health status using
World Health Survey data. The GoM model provided a
meaningful method to reduce and summarize health variables
from health surveys.
A number of techniques have previously been applied to WHS
data to summarize and report on health status [18]. Comparing
health results using Ustun's method to the GoM results indicated
good face validity, with similar response patterns. Establishing
comparable levels of health for different populations is extremely
useful, but in addition to this, GoM provides a discrete set of
profiles which are possibly easier to interpret and use for decision-
making. The three health profiles for higher to lower income
countries are digestible and realistic groupings of functioning and
well-being. If universal health coverage were to be rolled out or
expanded for the older population in a country, a policy maker
might choose a stepped strategy starting with characteristics
common in the frail profile. For example, this might include
improving identification and treatments for selected comorbidities
like depression and arthritis, along with items that have potential
to improve functioning (like addressing pain or sleep problems) to
allow for ageing (well) in place.
The GoM procedure differs from other classification methods,
like Factor Analysis, which use indicators to calculate latent
continuous variables that represent one-dimensional constructs.
Factor Analysis results derive the parameter values from normally
distributed data, whereas, the GoM model is a non-parametric
method where identification of parameters does not rely on any
distributional assumptions. Estimation of factor scores in Factor
Analysis supports on distributional assumptions relating to the
factor loadings [7]. GoM parameters are estimated in an iterative
method: firstly, the likelihood function is maximized with lkjl
fixed,
giving a first estimate of all gik
, then, fixing gik
, the likelihood is
maximized to update the lkjl
, which is repeated until convergence.
Grade of Membership modelling shares similarities with other
data reduction methods, such as Factor Analysis, Principal
Component Analysis and Cluster Analysis. However, in the
GoM model, all parameters are simultaneously identified, while,
individual parameters in Factor Analysis and Principal Compo-
nents methods are usually calculated using summary variables
derived from within the dataset [7].

GoM Profiles of Health Status

Additionally, in contrast to the Factor Analysis and Principal
Component methods, GoM is a classification methodology where
respondents are allocated to discrete and meaningful groups based
on their grade of membership profile. Unlike other classification
methodologies (such as Cluster Analysis), GoM does not generate
groups of similar entities but considers individual heterogeneity
[7]. GoM was, therefore, well suited for the planned analysis.
Grade of Membership analysis has been previously used to
summarize health data from surveys for depressive symptoms and
personality disorders, older people health status and genetic studies
of health. Woodbury et al. [11] employed GoM analysis in a
clinical setting to determine if the DSM-III-R personality disorder
diagnostic criteria cluster into recognizable disorders. Four pure
types provided the most satisfactory solution to the data. Portrait et
al. [7] analyzed Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam data and
identified six profiles to characterize health. Finally, Manton et al.
[10] identified five profiles within the 1999 National Long Term
Care Survey data, a national longitudinal survey based upon a list
sample of US Medicare enrollers aged 65 years and above, which
was used to demonstrate the compression of morbidity in the
United States.
In this study, the GOM model produced three pure types
(health profiles) for each economic category. Each health profile
described unique facets of physical and mental health (internal
GoM model variables) plus differences in socio-demographic
characteristics (external GoM model variables) with a clear
economic gradient (lower education and employment sector)
when moving from high to low economic categories within each
profile. Type I (ROBUST) and Type II (INTERMEDIATE)
health profiles were more similar in both external and internal
variables, as well as World Bank economic category, when
compared to the Type III (FRAIL) profile.
N The robust profile respondents reported good health, none of
the four health conditions and no difficulties with any of the
physical and mental issues comprising the eight health
domains.
N The intermediate profile respondents reported good or moderate
health with increasing difficulties with some health domains
but no reported health conditions.
N The frail profile clearly differed by external variables (older,
more widowed, more retired or homemakers), internal
variables (more difficulties with more of the eight health
domains plus more likely to have a diagnosis of at least one of
the health conditions) and economic category (the two lower
economic categories had significantly higher rates of member-
ship in the frail profile).
All four economic categories had somewhat similar robust and
intermediate health profiles (pure types I and II). The two higher
economic categories had more respondents in the robust pure type
(greater than 64%) than the lower economic categories (less than
59%). Likewise, the two lower economic categories had more
respondents in the frail pure types, (21.8% and 19.2%,
respectively), with similar rates of membership in the intermediate
profile across all four economic categories. The frail profile types
may provide a logical focus for attention at all levels of country
wealth, with policies targeted, for example, at older widowed
women with mobility, sleep and cognition problems.
These analyses have provided a robust method to better
understand health status and the components which can help to
identify healthy and non-healthy individuals. Three profiles, robust,
intermediate and frail, were obtained for respondents in each of the
four economic categories. These profiles have described concrete

levels of health as well as clearly delineating characteristics of
healthy and non-healthy respondents. Areas for specific consider-
ation include difficulties with sleep, mobility and depression,
largely regardless of presence of specific health conditions or
country of residence. The GoM results provided both a useable
summary health measure and a selection of intermediate
determinants which can be targeted for interventions to improve
health. With limited health budgets, these results can help to make
decisions about where health gains can be achieved. GoM would
help to define specific characteristics within groups of individuals
that can be targeted by health promotion efforts. As an example,
specific health policy targets could address unmet need in a sub-
population that encompass components of the frail profile. This
could include a public health education campaign for health care
professionals to look more closely at older married women
reporting moderate health and problems with pain, sleep. It's
more likely that they would also have comorbidities, such as
arthritis and depression, to treat and may be undertreated.
Treatment of these types of individuals could be part of a more
comprehensive package to address well-being at older ages.
In future, we plan to investigate the transitions between health
profiles, both improving and declining health, as well as the impact
of the health-wealth relationship on shifts between profiles. We will
additionally, look at the use of frailty definitions and profiles across
different settings and the impact on disability assessments. These
will provide the basis to inform policy about aging populations and
measures to redress the determinants of more vulnerable health
profiles. With a view to make results more cross-nationally
comparable, vignette adjustments would improve ability to
differentiate and correct for any reporting bias across countries
and categories. This adjustment would also likely show more
dramatic differences in health for respondents in lower income
countries.
