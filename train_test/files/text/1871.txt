the 1988­1994 and 1999­2000 National Health
and Nutrition Examination Surveys

Background: Understanding of C-reactive protein
(CRP) in adult metabolic syndrome is increasing; how-
ever, this relationship in children is less clear.
Methods: We compared the prevalence of metabolic
abnormalities and metabolic syndrome in fasting 12- to
19-year-olds from the 1999­2000 and 1988­1994 National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
In the more recent dataset we explored the relationship
between metabolic abnormalities and CRP as measured
by a high-sensitivity assay.
Results: The prevalence of central obesity, low HDL-
cholesterol, and hypertension increased between the 2
surveys. Three or more abnormalities (metabolic syn-
drome) were found in 12.7% [95% confidence interval
(CI), 10.0%­15.4%] of fasting adolescents from the 1999­
2000 survey, compared with 9.2% (95% CI, 7.8%­10.6%;
P <0.001) in the 1988­1994 dataset, with increases also
seen in sex and ethnic/racial subgroups. Increases in
metabolic syndrome were primarily attributable to in-
creasing body mass index (BMI); prevalence of BMI at
or above the 85th percentile increased from 25.9% to
30.5%. Metabolic syndrome was much more prevalent in
overweight compared with normal-weight adolescents
(38.6% vs 1.4%; P <0.001). Median CRP increased with
increasing numbers of metabolic abnormalities and was
higher in adolescents with metabolic syndrome than in
those without. CRP was higher in adolescents with BMI
at or above the 85th percentile than those with normal
BMI.
Conclusions: Metabolic abnormalities and the meta-
bolic syndrome phenotype are increasingly prevalent in
US adolescents, attributable in part to the increasing
incidence of overweight. Adolescents with more meta-
bolic abnormalities have higher CRP, which may be an
indicator of greater metabolic derangement and future
cardiovascular risk.

Metabolic abnormalities in children have become more
prevalent with the epidemic of obesity in childhood and
adolescence. Although studies have examined the cluster-
ing of metabolic abnormalities (1­3), the metabolic syn-
drome phenotype continues to be less well understood in
children than in adults in terms of criteria, prevalence,
and clinical implications. Abnormalities such as over-
weight, hypertension, and lipid derangements are known
to track from childhood to adulthood, and the collected
abnormalities may similarly track (4). Adult metabolic
syndrome, although the subject of some debate recently,
is associated with cardiovascular disease (5) and diabetes
mellitus (6), and was defined by the Adult Treatment
Panel III (ATP III)4 as 3 or more of the following: hy-
pertriglyceridemia, low HDL-cholesterol, high fasting
glucose, excessive waist circumference, and hypertension
(7). Recent factor analysis supports this definition (8).

(NHANES) III, we recently reported that 63.4% of US
adolescents have at least 1 metabolic abnormality and that
nearly 1 in 10 have 3 or more abnormalities consistent
with a metabolic syndrome phenotype (9).
C-reactive protein (CRP) is increased in adults with
elements of the metabolic syndrome, such as hyperten-
sion (10) and increased body mass index (BMI) (11), and
correlates with triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol concen-
trations (12). In children, there is less information about
CRP concentrations and metabolic syndrome; however,
CRP is higher in children with metabolic abnormalities
(13, 14). We sought to explore changes over time in the
prevalence of the metabolic syndrome phenotype in US
adolescents by comparing 2 NHANES datasets, 1999­
2000 and 1988­1994. We also evaluated the relationship
between metabolic abnormalities, metabolic syndrome,
and CRP concentrations in the more recent dataset.
Materials and Methods
NHANES is a national dataset of blood testing and
anthropomorphic measurements weighted to represent
the population of noninstitutionalized US civilians, not
living on Indian reservations, ages 2 years and older
(15, 16). It uses a multistage, stratified sampling design. In
1999, NHANES became a continuously enrolling and
reporting survey. Our sample was drawn from partici-
pants in the surveys ages 12 to 19 years who underwent
physical examinations and fasted for at least 8 h before
blood testing. Human subjects approval for NHANES
was obtained from the CDC. A parent or guardian gave
consent for participation, and 12- to 17-year-olds also gave
assent.
CRP was measured in the 1999­2000 survey by a
high-sensitivity assay (hsCRP), a latex-enhanced nephe-
lometry method (BN II nephelometer; Dade Behring)
with a lower limit of detection of 0.1 mg/L. Acceptable
day-to-day CVs (4.93%­7.84%) have been reported for this
assay in this dataset (17). Participants with CRP con-
centrations 0.1 mg/L had a value assigned to them of
0.1 mg/L in the 1999­2000 NHANES dataset. The 1988­
1994 survey did not use a high-sensitivity CRP assay;
the lower limit of detection of that assay was 3.0 mg/L,
with values below this cutoff being assigned a value of
2.1 mg/L (18). Both assays are felt to be accurate at CRP
concentrations 3.0 mg/L.
statistical methods
Because the NHANES surveys have complex sampling
designs, estimates and SEs were calculated in Stata, Ver. 9
(StataCorp), with the sampling weights provided to make
prevalence estimates representative of the civilian, non-
institutionalized US population. Sampling weights are
adjusted for nonresponse. We calculated the prevalence of
individual metabolic abnormalities as well as the meta-
bolic syndrome, as defined previously (9), for the entire
sample and according to sex, age group, race or ethnicity,
and BMI at or above the 85th percentile for age and sex.
Metabolic syndrome was defined as 3 or more of the
following: (a) fasting triglycerides 1.1 mmol/L (100
mg/dL); (b) HDL-cholesterol 1.3 mmol/L (50 mg/dL),
except in boys 15 to 19 years of age, in whom the cutpoint
was 1.2 mmol/L (45 mg/dL); (c) fasting glucose 6.1
mmol/L (110 mg/dL); (d) waist circumference above the
75th percentile for age and sex based on the 1988­1994
NHANES dataset; and (e) systolic blood pressure above
the 90th percentile for sex, age, and height. The same
criteria for metabolic abnormalities were used for both
datasets. For estimates of prevalence, adolescents missing
information on metabolic criteria were assumed not to
have met that criterion to give more conservative esti-
mates of prevalence. BMI percentiles for both datasets
were calculated by use of standard CDC data curves. We
compared the distributions of these variables in NHANES
1999­2000 with those previously reported in NHANES III
(1988­1994), using the 2 test, again incorporating the
sampling weights.
We calculated the median and interquartile range of
CRP for all adolescents with recorded CRP values and by
subgroups according to patient characteristics and meta-
bolic abnormalities. Because CRP does not follow a gaus-
sian distribution, we used nonparametric methods for
analysis and report percentiles and medians rather than
means. CRP concentrations were compared by use of the
Wilcoxon rank-sum test for characteristics with 2 catego-
ries (e.g., sex and normal BMI vs BMI at or above the 85th
percentile) and by use of the Kruskal­Wallis test for those
with 3 or more categories (e.g., number of metabolic
abnormalities and race or ethnicity). Comparisons were
repeated excluding those with CRP 10 mg/L because
very high CRP concentrations can indicate inflammatory
disorders or infections.
Results
The 1999­2000 dataset included 1527 fasting 12- to 19-
year-olds. Low HDL-cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia,
and central obesity remained common, whereas hyper-
glycemia and hypertension were infrequent, as we found
in 1988­1994 (Fig. 1). Prevalence of 3 of the 5 individual
metabolic abnormalities increased in the more recent
sample compared with 1988­1994, with the greatest in-
crease seen in central obesity. Subgroup analysis by age
grouping and sex revealed that changes between the 2
datasets generally were similar to those in the overall
group. Notably, the prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia
increased in non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Ameri-
cans, in contrast to the prevalence in the group overall
and in non-Hispanic whites, in whom the prevalence of
hypertriglyceridemia decreased (data not shown).
The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome phenotype
increased from 9.2% [95% confidence interval (CI), 7.8%­
10.6%] to 12.7% (95% CI, 10.0%­15.4%; P 0.001) from
NHANES 1988­1994 to 1999­2000 in US adolescents; this
represents an increase of 38%. Increases in prevalence
estimates of the metabolic syndrome phenotype were
1326 de Ferranti et al.: Metabolic Phenotype and CRP in US Adolescents
seen in subgroups as well (Table 1). The largest increases
were seen in non-Hispanic blacks, followed by Mexican
Americans. Of note, the prevalence estimate for metabolic
syndrome in non-Hispanic blacks was based on a small
number of participants and may appear artificially low in
the 1988­1994 survey. Analysis of ethnic/racial sub-
groups by sex revealed similar changes for males and
females (data not shown).
As has been reported in the past (19), CRP did not
follow a gaussian distribution but was skewed, with
lower values being more common. Median CRP for those
1471 adolescents with recorded CRP values was 0.5 mg/L
[interquartile range (IQR), 0.1­1.6 mg/L]. Girls had
slightly higher median CRP than boys (0.5 vs 0.4 mg/L;
P  0.01) and Mexican Americans had higher CRP than
other racial/ethnic subgroups (0.8 vs 0.4­0.5 mg/L; P
0.0001). Median CRP increased with older age, from 0.3
mg/L in 12- to 13-year-olds to 0.7 mg/L in 18- to
19-year-olds (P 0.0001). Median CRP was higher in
children with individual metabolic abnormalities com-
pared with adolescents without those metabolic abnor-
malities, although the IQRs overlapped (Fig. 2; P
0.0001); the number of children with hyperglycemia and
measured CRP was too small to allow reliable calcula-
tions. Median CRP concentrations increased incremen-
tally by the number of metabolic abnormalities (Fig. 3; P
0.0001). The results were similar in analyses excluding
those with CRP 10 mg/L.
Of fasting adolescents 12­19 years of age in the
NHANES 1999­2000 survey, 30.5% had a BMI at or above
the 85th percentile. This represents an increase of 18%
from NHANES 1988­1994, in which the prevalence of
high BMI was 25.9%, consistent with previous reports
(20, 21). Consistent with previous reports (3), the meta-
bolic syndrome phenotype was highly prevalent in the
overweight adolescents (found in more than one third)
and rare in teens with normal BMI (Table 1). As expected
from previous research (22), CRP was higher in adoles-
cents with BMI at or above the 85th percentile compared
with those with normal BMI: median, 1.6 mg/L (IQR,
0.6­3.9 mg/L) vs 0.3 mg/L (0.1­0.7 mg/L); P 0.0001. In
the subgroups with 0, 1, and 2 metabolic abnormalities,
median CRP was higher in those with high BMI than in
those with normal BMI. Only 12 individuals in the sample
had both a normal BMI and 3 or more metabolic abnor-
malities. Median CRP was higher for these normal-weight
adolescents with metabolic syndrome than for the 201
adolescents with high BMI and 3 or more abnormalities
[2.1 mg/L (IQR, 1.3­6.1 mg/L) vs 1.6 mg/L (0.9­3.3
mg/L); P 0.0001].

Discussion
We found increases in most individual metabolic abnor-
malities and a significant and concerning increase of
38% in the prevalence of an adolescent metabolic syn-
drome phenotype between the 1988­1994 and 1999­2000
NHANES surveys. Particularly alarming was the change
in central obesity from 25% to 34% of 12- to 19-year-olds,
which likely played a central role in the increase in the
metabolic syndrome overall. Also concerning, if con-
firmed, would be the tripling in the prevalence of the
metabolic syndrome phenotype in non-Hispanic blacks;
this finding may be an artifact because of small sample
size and should be reevaluated in other studies with a
larger sample size. Median CRP concentrations were
higher for adolescents with the metabolic syndrome phe-
notype than in those without it, and CRP increased with
greater numbers of metabolic abnormalities in the group
overall and in overweight youth, supporting an associa-
tion between metabolic syndrome and CRP in the pedi-
atric age range. In overweight children with metabolic
syndrome, CRP concentrations were higher than in over-
weight children without metabolic syndrome, suggesting
that the combination of metabolic abnormalities has a
greater effect on inflammation than weight alone. The few
with normal weight who had metabolic syndrome had
higher CRP concentrations than those who were over-
weight and had metabolic syndrome, leading one to
suspect that they represent a different disease group,
perhaps one worthy of further investigation.
Previous studies have also reported that CRP concen-
trations in children are associated with individual com-
ponents of the metabolic syndrome (1, 13, 14). The rela-
tionship with obesity is particularly well documented
(14, 18, 22­25). Higher blood pressure and dyslipidemias
are also correlated with CRP in some reports, whereas the
relationship between CRP and insulin resistance in chil-
dren is less clear (13, 19, 22, 26, 27). Our findings were
also consistent with reports of CRP concentrations in
children from the 1999­2000 NHANES database, includ-
ing findings that CRP is higher in girls compared with
boys, in Mexican Americans compared with non-Hispanic
whites, and in overweight adolescents compared with
normal-weight adolescents (28).
Addressing an issue that has been less well investi-
gated in children, we evaluated the relationship between
a metabolic syndrome phenotype and CRP concentra-
tions. Weiss et al. (27) found no relationship between CRP
and a metabolic syndrome phenotype in obese children;
however, they studied a selected referral population with
a higher rate of overweight, and used a more restrictive
definition of metabolic syndrome than ours, which we
based on the ATP III definition for adults. Ford et al. (17)
examined mean (not median) CRP concentrations in ad-
olescents with metabolic syndrome who had fasted 6 h;
however, they used a less restrictive definition with lower
HDL-cholesterol, higher triglyceride, and higher waist
circumference cutpoints than ATP III and did not address
changes in the CRP concentration with increasing num-
bers of metabolic abnormalities.
Previous research has demonstrated that individual
components of the metabolic syndrome track from child-
hood to adulthood, suggesting that metabolic syndrome
might also track into adulthood (4). In fact, childhood
obesity predicts the development of metabolic syndrome
in adulthood, lending credence to the theory that excess
adipose tissue is an initiating event for the metabolic
syndrome (29). However, it is unknown whether CRP
concentrations track from childhood to adulthood. Fur-
thermore, the long-term cardiovascular risks of increased
CRP in childhood, as well as clinically useful cutpoints for
CRP in pediatrics, are unknown. In adults, metabolic

because the small number of cases with this abnormality makes the estimates
unreliable.

syndrome and CRP are correlated and predict worse
cardiovascular outcomes. Lee et al. (30) reported that CRP
increased incrementally with greater numbers of meta-
bolic abnormalities in adult men and women. The Wom-
en's Health Study showed that CRP correlated with
metabolic syndrome, and the risk of cardiovascular dis-
ease events doubled in women with metabolic syndrome
and CRP 3.0 mg/L compared with women with meta-
bolic syndrome and CRP 3.0 mg/L (31). In the West of
Scotland Coronary Prevention Study, CRP was higher in
men with metabolic syndrome and was an independent
predictor of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in mul-
tivariate analyses (32). Our findings of the association
between metabolic syndrome and CRP in children are
consistent with research in adults.
There are several limitations to our findings. The
primary limitation is the use of a single CRP measure-
ment. In adults, repeat CRP measurements are recom-
mended, as concentrations are affected by multiple fac-
tors, including recent infections and inflammatory
conditions (33). These factors, perhaps more common in
children who have frequent minor illnesses, are partially
offset by the lower rate of chronic disease in children. We
attempted to evaluate whether this was a significant
confounder by repeating the analysis after excluding
those with CRP 10 mg/L, who might have had acute
infections or chronic inflammatory conditions, and our
findings were not significantly changed. A second limita-
tion is that study outcomes depend on the definition of
metabolic syndrome, a problem inherent to any extrapo-
lation of the adult definition to a pediatric population.
There is no agreed on definition of metabolic syndrome in
children. The cutpoints used for our definition were
extrapolated from those used in adults; they could not be
based on cardiovascular outcomes because of the young
age of our population. However, the same definition was
used in both datasets, allowing valid comparisons be-
tween the two, showing increases in the prevalence of
metabolic abnormalities and the metabolic syndrome phe-
notype as we have defined them. Future studies should
examine CRP in children with metabolic syndrome, as it
relates to measures of preclinical disease, such as endo-
thelial function. A third limitation was our inability to
evaluate detailed changes in CRP between the 2 surveys
because a high-sensitivity CRP assay was not used in the
earlier survey. Although the more sensitive assay was not
used in the earlier dataset, there is evidence to support an
increase in CRP concentrations over that time period. In
the earlier survey, 8.3% of 12- to 19-year-olds had a CRP
3.0 mg/L; in the later survey, 11.0% of adolescents had
CRP 3.0 mg/L. Although the assay used in the earlier
dataset does not detect CRP 3.0 mg/L, it is thought to
be accurate for CRP concentrations 3.0 mg/L (18). The
assays used by the 2 surveys have different limits of
detection; however, both used reagents and instruments
from the same manufacturer (Dade Behring), and both are
calibrated against CRM 470, the international standard for
calibration of proteins. Another limitation is that, for
participants missing data, we assumed they did not meet
that criterion for a metabolic abnormality. This may have
caused us to underestimate the prevalence of the meta-
bolic syndrome; however, we followed the same proce-
dure in both datasets, allowing us to demonstrate in-
creases in prevalence between the 2 time periods with
consistency. Finally, although NHANES is highly repre-
sentative of most of the US population, the dataset did not
include those living on American Indian reservations. The
rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus type 2 are particu-
larly high in some American Indian populations (34), who
therefore are likely to have higher rates of metabolic
syndrome.
In summary, we found that CRP is increased in adoles-
cents with metabolic abnormalities and the metabolic
syndrome phenotype in a manner consistent with the
association documented previously in adults. The preva-
lence of metabolic syndrome has increased, in large part
related to the increase in central obesity in adolescents.
The impact of these data may be far-reaching, given the
association between CRP, metabolic syndrome and car-
diovascular disease (31, 32), and metabolic syndrome
and diabetes mellitus type 2 (5). Pediatric practitioners
should be aware of the clustering of metabolic abnormal-
ities, particularly in overweight children, and public
health efforts should target those affected children for
risk-reducing lifestyle changes such as weight loss, exer-
cise, and dietary modifications. Future studies should
explore whether CRP concentrations have a role in clinical
management and assessment of cardiovascular risk in the
pediatric population.
