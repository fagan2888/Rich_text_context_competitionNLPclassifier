In the hushed darkness of a chilly night, a fire truck carrying six
men rolled toward its Brooklyn firehouse. They had just finished
up at a women's shelter, where steam wisping from an iron had
set off an alarm. Not much to it . . . for Jordan Sullivan, another
15 hour shift was unspooling without what he so eagerly awaited.
A fire. In his 96 days in the field as a firefighter, a probie out of
the Fire Academy--the Rock, as it's familiarly known--it had
not happened. Around the firehouse, the veterans continually
swapped fire stories. That was how they both taught and regaled
one another, and the stories were good ones. He could not
contribute. He hadn't had a fire (Kleinfield, 2014, p. A1).
Mentors are all around us. In our own lives--both profes-
sional and personal--they help us set goals, navigate diffi-
cult situations, overcome challenges, develop skills, and
learn the ropes. But how is it that mentors impart their wis-
dom? How do they act on the influence they have? What do
they say to inspire and role model for their protégés? Those
questions about how mentors actually mentor are at the heart
of the current research.
Mentoring relationships are central themes in many forms
of popular culture and literature. Mentors appear in Homer's
Odyssey, Frankenstein, and the Great Gatsby (Alleman &
Clarke, 2000; Colley, 2002; Dougherty, Turban, & Haggard,
2007; Eby, Rhodes, & Allen, 2007; Scandura & Pellegrini,
2007), but also in more contemporary films. For example,
the 1988American classic, Bull Durham, is a baseball movie,
but it is also a film about mentoring. Crash Davis, a veteran
player is brought into the minor leagues to educate and teach
Ebby LaLoosh (aka Nuke, a hotshot rookie pitcher), but,
while instructing Nuke on methods of control for his chaotic
pitching, Crash also acclimates Nuke to the pressure facing
major league hitters while teaching him the ins and outs of a
baseball career (Mount & Shelton, 1988). Jump ahead to
2013 and the R-rated hit film The Wolf of Wall Street depict-
ing Matthew McConaughey in a brief role early on in the
film as Mark Hanna, mentor to Jordan Belfort (played by
Leonardo DiCaprio). It is Hanna's questionable advice that
transforms Belfort from a young, naïve, newly licensed
trader to the vile, scandalous crook that overshadows the
screen for nearly three hours (Hill, 2013). Belfort starts by
thinking,
But if you can make your clients money at the same time, it's
advantageous to everyone, correct?
To which Hanna retorts,

Storytelling in Mentoring: An Exploratory,
Qualitative Study of Facilitating Learning
in Developmental Interactions
Caroline P. D'Abate1 and Hali Alpert2
Abstract
How is it that mentors teach--that protégé's learn--that wisdom is shared between a mentor and protégé? This exploratory,
qualitative study responds to a call in the literature to better understand what occurs in mentoring interactions by examining
storytelling as a mentoring tool. The focus is on how stories can convey meaning, inspire listeners, and transmit wisdom to
help protégés grow, learn, and develop in their jobs and careers. Interview data from 39 professionals working in a wide
variety of industries resulted in a rich data set of 48 work-related mentoring stories. Hermeneutical analysis enabled us to
identify key mentoring functions that are fulfilled in the narrative text of stories. We conclude that storytelling is indeed a
powerful tool in mentoring--allowing mentors to calm their protégés, encourage them, help them solve problems, build
their confidence, teach them, give them direction, and provide numerous other functions.

The name of the game? Move the money from your client's
pocket into your pocket (Scorsese, 2013).
In essence, Crash and Hanna are mentoring Nuke and Belfort
by providing essential career advice, offering personal sup-
port, helping them understand the way the industries work,
and teaching them how to be good at their jobs.
What these examples shed light on is not simply mentor-
ing in popular culture. They point to an underresearched area
of the mentoring literature--how exactly it is that mentors
help their protégés learn. The body of literature on mentoring
and related forms of developmental interactions has identi-
fied many of the complex interpersonal, psychosocial, and
outcome-related issues of mentoring, but the nature of the
developmental interactions that take place between mentors
and their protégés is less understood. This exploratory study
will examine one possible way that those relationships are
manifest--it will examine what role, if any, storytelling
serves in mentoring interactions and how stories help men-
tors fulfill advice-giving, supportive, and other developmen-
tal functions of mentoring.
Our motivation behind studying storytelling in the men-
toring context stems from the power of stories themselves.
First, stories are multidimensional (Simmons, 2001), so they
go beyond just giving an audience an example. Second, sto-
ries illustrate what one means without imposing too much
detail to convey the idea of what is involved (Denning,
2005). Moreover, the act of telling a story adds emotion and
visual details to the dialogue; in this way, storytelling is the
process of translating the narrative into a compelling picture
to which people can relate (Denning, 2005; Schank, 1990;
Simmons, 2001). As a result, storytelling allows for truthful,
clear, and natural communication (Denning, 2005). Because
mentoring scholars have indicated a gap in understanding
how mentors perform their functions (Chan, 2008), the cur-
rent study will provide valuable insight into this underex-
plored area.
Theoretical Background and Relevant
Literature
Underpinning this research is a basic assumption that proté-
gés learn from their mentors. Social learning theory would
argue that protégés can observe mentors as models, they can
imitate them, and they can learn from the mentor's experi-
ences through a social exchange or socialization process
(Bandura, 1986; Byrne, 2015; Kreitner & Luthans, 1984).
That theoretical context helps to explain how mentors can
serve a developmental function for their protégés whereby
protégés need not only learn from experiencing something
themselves. Rather, they can learn by observing others or
through a social process--akin to mentoring and, in this
case, storytelling. The following pages provide more detail
on the learning-by-mentoring process, the functions it pro-
vides, and what that exchange or interaction can look like.
Mentoring Literature
The concept and practice of mentoring has been studied in a
variety of disciplines including education, psychology, and
management, making it an interdisciplinary concept
(Archard, 2012; Barker & Pitts, 1997; Campbell & Campbell,
1997; Jacobi, 1991; Sanchez, Bauer, & Paronto, 2006; Wilde
& Schau, 1991). Although many definitions of mentoring
have been offered in these fields, most tend to agree that
mentoring is a developmental interaction or partnership
(Chao, 1997; D'Abate, Eddy, & Tannenbaum, 2003; Garvey
& Alred, 2003; Kram, 1985; Lester & Johnson, 1981; Noe,
1988; Ostroff & Kozlowski, 1993; Peper, 1994; Roberts,
2000; Sanchez et al., 2006; Tenenbaum, Crosby, & Gliner,
2001) in which a senior colleague (mentor) provides support
and guidance to a junior colleague (protégé) for the protégé's
personal/professional growth (however, the mentor and pro-
tégé can be on the same hierarchical level, in a reverse men-
toring relationship with a mentor junior to the protégé, or
part of a group of mentors (D'Abate et al., 2003; Eby et al.,
2007; Eddy, D'Abate, Tannenbaum, Givens-Skeaton, &
Robinson, 2006; Kram, 1985; Lentz & Allen, 2009; Noe,
1988). Mentoring is sometimes characterized as a relation-
ship that can be intense and emotional (Kram, 1985;
Levinson, Darrow, Klein, Levinson, & McKee, 1978;
Shapiro, Hazeltine, & Rowe, 1978) or it can be seen as a
process defined by the functions it provides (D'Abate et al.,
2003; Eby, 1997; Jacobi, 1991; Noe, 1988; Scandura, 1992).
For example, its meaning has been based on the specific
functions of upward mobility and support it provides to the
protégé (Ragins, 1997; Ragins, Cotton, & Miller, 2000;
Singh, Bains, & Vinnicombe, 2002) or, more specifically,
learning, career development, and/or emotional support
functions through a variety of behaviors such as coaching,
goal setting, role modeling, encouraging, and socializing or
orienting the protégé to the company or industry (D'Abate
et al., 2003; Jacobi, 1991; Ragins & Cotton, 1999). In the
context of the current study, though, one definition stands
out. Lester and Johnson (1981) define mentoring as a "one-
to-one learning relationship between an older person and a
younger person that is based on modeling behavior and
extended dialogue between them" (p. 119). This notion of
extended dialogue is what is in question in the current
study--its substance, its meaning, its function, and its role in
delivering mentoring's value.
Functions of Mentoring
There has been a good bit of attention paid to the functions
mentoring serves. From (a) psychosocial functions that build
the protégé's self-confidence and sense of identity to (b)
career-related functions focusing on career/organizational
advancement, to (c) role modeling functions (Allen, Eby,
Poteet, Lentz, & Lima, 2004; Burke, 1984; Kram, 1985;
Noe, 1988; Scandura, 1992; Scandura & Viator, 1994),
D'Abate and Alpert 3
mentoring has emerged as a complex interpersonal construct.
It can be broken down into 15 subfunctions that fall into
career, psychosocial, and role modeling categories (Jacobi,
1991) or into a nomological network of 23 behaviors con-
nected to three high-level learning, career progression, and
emotional/psychosocial support functions (e.g., teaching,
advising, problem solving, affirming, and confidence build-
ing; D'Abate et al., 2003).
Types of Mentoring
In addition to serving a number of functions, mentoring can
take various forms. Some mentoring relationships are more
traditional wherein the mentor is older or at a higher hierarchi-
cal level and works face-to-face with the protégé via a formal
mentoring program or a more informal, spontaneous, or seren-
dipitous means of finding a good developmental partner
(Dougherty et al., 2007; Eby et al., 2007; Johnson, 2002;
Johnson & Ridley, 2004; Mullen, 2003, 2005). However, men-
toring can take many alternative forms; some of those include
group mentoring, reverse mentoring, distance/e-mentoring,
and multiple mentor situations (Baugh & Scandura, 1999;
Hamilton & Scandura, 2003; Murphy, 2012; Williams, 2000).
Benefits of Mentoring
Even though mentoring can take many forms and offer a
variety of developmental functions to the protégé, it can also
be a two-way street with the relationship benefiting the men-
tor (and the organization) as well as the protégé. A mentor
can find career enrichment in the form of improved job per-
formance, productivity increases, enhanced sources of infor-
mation, a broader network, expanded technical/managerial/
interpersonal skills, unexpected recognition in the organiza-
tion, a more motivated staff, as well as the good feelings (i.e.,
psychic rewards) of helping others and being energized by a
protégé's fresh perspective (Allen & Eby, 2003; Allen,
Poteet, & Burroughs, 1997; Domeyer, 1999; Eby &
Lockwood, 2005; Hezlett & Gibson, 2007; Hunt & Michael,
1983; Kram, 1985; Levinson et al., 1978; Mullen, 1994;
Mullen & Noe, 1999; Noe, 1988; Ragins & Scandura, 1999).
Protégés, of course, can benefit from improved job perfor-
mance, increased job satisfaction and organizational com-
mitment, a stronger skill/knowledge set, more confidence, a
broader perspective, more understanding of the field/indus-
try/job, higher pay, and faster promotions (Allen et al., 2004;
D'Abate, 2009; Dreher & Ash, 1990; Koberg, Boss, &
Goodman, 1998; Mullen, 1994; Noe, 1988; Scandura, 1992).
But what surprises some is that the benefits of mentoring can
far exceed the mentor or the protégé--the organization can
benefit as well. Mentoring has been shown to benefit busi-
nesses with the knowledge transfer that occurs, improved
productivity, greater employee loyalty, increased employee
motivation, and lower turnover (Crosby, 1999; Domeyer,
1999; Egan & Song, 2008; Ragins, 1999). Mentoring also
allows businesses to facilitate growth via enhanced promo-
tion of the corporate culture (Singh et al., 2002; Wanberg,
Welsh, & Hezlett, 2003; Wilson & Elman, 1990).
The Mentoring Interaction
Despite all that is known about mentoring, the functions it
serves, and the benefits it brings, not as much is known about
what exactly occurs in the developmental interaction itself.
We do know that the location of the interaction and the mode
of communication affect the relationship (Rutter, 1987;
Sullivan, 1995). For example, face-to-face and distance
(email, telephone, and Internet chat) interactions can result in
different outcomes. We also know the duration of the rela-
tionship and the frequency with which the mentor and pro-
tégé interact will affect the outcomes of the mentorship. For
instance, studies have shown that relationships are more
valuable when the interactions are more frequent and when
the individuals involved have known one another for an
extended period of time (Chao, Walz, & Gardner, 1992;
Ensher & Murphy, 1997; Geiger-DuMond & Boyle, 1995;
Locke & Latham, 1990). In addition, the extant literature
tells us the interactions themselves can be focused on differ-
ent developmental topics: work/life advice (i.e., centered
around balancing work and family, managing stress), career
advice (in which the focus is on the protégé's career path,
networking, and advancement), and job/skill/task advice
(giving advice on a job-related task or problem (Eddy et al.,
2006; Gaskill, 1993; Scandura, 1997; Seibert, 1999).
Yet with all that we know about mentoring interactions,
researchers still do not know enough about how the protégé
learns. There is some exploratory research suggesting that
protégés tend to learn through observation and explanations
from their mentors--observing the mentor's behaviors and
the way she or he interacts with others (Archard, 2012;
Hezlett, 2005; Zagumny, 1993). For example, in the current
study, a Chief Financial Officer described a time in his career
when observation helped him learn:
[I] observed [a senior management officer] managing other
people because he wasn't the smartest kid on the block and he
wasn't the toughest kid on the block and he was managing
wheelers and dealers and doing it effectively. And so my boss
and I spent a lot of time looking at people in the organization,
figuring out how they manage people, and figuring out how to
manage them as a result of those observations.
Another way protégés may learn is through explanation.
Hezlett (2005) suggests that, in some way, the mentor is
explaining something to the protégé by giving advice, offering
information, and/or explaining how to do something. Protégés
also learn from their interactions with their mentors (Hale,
2000), by "gaining insights from the impact their mentors'
behavior had on them" (Hezlett, 2005, p. 518). Despite the role
that observation and explanation may play in how protégés
4 SAGE Open
learn, more research is needed to examine this process--in
other words, what is it that occurs in the mentoring interaction
that helps the protégé learn, grow, and develop?
Storytelling
One possible way that protégés may learn is through stories
told by their mentor. Storytelling has received some attention
for its applications in adult learning, coaching, faculty devel-
opment, and management development (Caminotti & Gray,
2012; Carr & Ann, 2011; Shadiow, 2013), and a recent study
on mentoring has identified this potential in mentoring
exchanges. Chan (2008) sought to understand mentor prac-
tices for predoctoral students and noted that "little research
has been conducted on the actual practices in a mentoring
relationship, [and] it is unclear how mentors fulfill [mentor-
ing] functions" (p. 264). Chan's article identified validation,
responsiveness, and giving time as mentoring practices in the
four mentoring dyads she studied--sharing candid stories
about their own personal experiences in graduate school was
another mentoring practice that emerged from her data.
However, little focus was given in the article to what those
stories might have been about or how (as a mentoring prac-
tice) they served mentoring functions.
Because stories tend to illustrate points better than simply
stating the point themselves (Schank, 1990), a story can be
defined as a narrative account of an event, or events, that
weaves the relational aspects of detail, character, and values
into one big picture (Denning, 2005; Gabriel, 1991; Simmons,
2001). They can be powerful mechanisms for learning as
"most experiences are shared through story, some long, some
short, but always through a story" (Caminotti & Gray, 2012,
p. 431). Stories are comprised of layers; the external layer
focuses on the aspects of the story that is analyzed and dis-
sected into parts, while a story's internal layer focuses more
on the actual experience and how that experience conveys an
image and/or message (Denning, 2005). Stories can enhance
one's perspective, change perceptions, or motivate the lis-
tener as they persuade and influence others, create commu-
nity, transmit knowledge, and share wisdom (Brown,
Denning, Groh, & Prusak, 2005; Caminotti & Gray, 2012;
Simmons, 2001). It has been said that "we value stories
because they are like reports of research projects, only easier
to understand, remember, and use" (Klein, 1998, p. 182). It
makes sense, then, that storytelling has been used as a tool
for learning in a multitude of disciplines including history,
English, and business. In business, the concept has been seen
as both a management development tool as well as a career
development tool. According to Denning (2001),
Storytelling enables the individuals in an organization to see
themselves, the situation they are currently in, and the
organization in a different light and accordingly take decisions
and change their behavior in accordance with these new
perceptions, insights, and identities (p. xiv).
It enables people to connect to what is important and helps
them make sense of their current situation within society,
business, an organization, or their own careers. Therefore,
based on this understanding, it is plausible that storytelling is
one way that protégés learn during a mentoring interaction,
yet as Carr andAnn (2011) note, "What eludes us is a breadth
and depth of analysis of how coaches [or mentors] use stories
and for what reasons" (p. 237).
Statement of Purpose
From the preceding discussion, it should be evident that
how mentors help their protégés learn is an underresearched
area of the mentoring literature. Given that (a) mentoring is
a valuable developmental relationship for protégés, men-
tors, and their employing organizations and that (b) research-
ers have identified the functions mentoring serves, the
common types of mentoring relationships, and some charac-
teristics of the interaction, the means by which this develop-
mental support and sharing of expertise occurs still deserves
more clarification. Granted, exploratory research has sug-
gested that protégés learn through observation, explanation,
and interaction with their mentor or mentors (Hezlett, 2005).
However, the actual interactions that are occurring, the top-
ics of conversation, and the mechanics of sharing expertise
remain unknown--a gap that is particularly evident when
storytelling has been argued to serve as a powerful mecha-
nism for learning.
For that reason, the current study attempts to bridge the
mentoring and storytelling divide to explore how a mentor's
stories could be the mechanism that shares the mentor's
expertise, teaches the protégé, gives the protégé advice and
encouragement, and boosts the protégé's confidence, while
possible serving other mentoring functions (D'Abate et al.,
2003; Jacobi, 1991). This exploratory research will, therefore,
examine storytelling for its role in mentoring interactions.
Method
To examine the utility of storytelling in mentoring, the cur-
rent research utilized qualitative methods to capture rich
descriptions of mentoring interactions and to enhance under-
standing of the context of any storytelling event that was
recounted (Strauss & Corbin, 1990). Paired with an explor-
atory approach, we examined whether stories are an effective
or ineffective tool in mentoring, as well as explored what
characteristics of stories are effective in fostering learning
and development.
Sampling
It was not our goal to study mentoring in a particular field or
industry; instead, we sought participants from a variety of
industries and backgrounds who were currently serving as
someone's mentor or who had been a mentor or a protégé.
D'Abate and Alpert 5
Convenience and purposive sampling techniques (Kerlinger,
1986; Stone, 1978) allowed us to identify these participants.
Given that one of the researchers had a family member who
was in a C-suite position and had worked with many differ-
ent industries over the years, she had access to this large cir-
cle of personal contacts/acquaintances who could speak to
the experience of storytelling as part of the mentoring rela-
tionship or interaction. From this pool of prospective partici-
pants, we utilized a snowball sampling method--asking
interviewees to offer one or two names of other individuals
who might also meet the needs of the study (Welch, 1975).
Such procedures produced a pool of 39 interviewees varying
in age from 26 to 60+ years old, with nearly half (48.7%)
between 51 and 60 years. Of the sample, 54% were male and
46% were female. They represented a wide array of indus-
tries including law, medicine, marketing, finance, religion,
food and beverage, consumer products, telecommunications,
and sales and held high-level positions in their respective
fields (e.g., Chief Financial Officer, CEO and President,
Clinical Psychologist, Executive Director of Compliance,
Executive Vice President of Sales, and Senior Vice President
of Marketing).
Data Collection, Coding, and Analysis
The interviews were held face-to-face in either the partici-
pant's office or a neutral location (e.g., coffee shop) and fol-
lowed a semistructured interview protocol (see the appendix)
which comprised of open-ended questions pertaining to
mentoring relationships the participants had been in or were
in at the time. We started by gaining consensus around the
central concept of mentoring by discussing a definition of the
term. We, then, asked participants open-ended questions
about their experiences as a mentor and/or a protégé (e.g.,
can you think of someone you've mentored or who has men-
tored you, what did you learn from them, etc.). They were
then asked to share a story (or stories) that they had told to
their protégés or had been told by their mentors. Participants
were asked to specifically describe what they learned from
the stories and how they applied the lessons to their careers,
or--from the mentor's perspective--what they were trying
to teach their protégés through the stories. The interviews
were recorded with permission and then transcribed; record-
ings were destroyed following transcription with only the
researchers having access to the recordings. After transcrib-
ing, the interviews were analyzed on a password protected
spreadsheet by the researchers using textual analysis, in the
form of hermeneutics.
Hermeneutics encompasses the issues of text and inter-
pretation while discovering the authentic message hidden
within the text (Gabriel, 1991; Prasad, 2002, 2005; Rennie,
2012). In other words, hermeneutics allows researchers and
interpreters to see how symbolic texts are, and how they refer
to something beyond their literal meaning and beyond the
author's intended meaning (Phillips & Brown, 1993; Prasad,
2002). Hermeneutics is extremely useful in studying people
and their stories (Freeman, 1997; Sandelowski, 1991) as well
as organizations as it "get[s] to the kernel of events and activ-
ities by understanding the relationship between the obvious
features of a text and the driving forces behind them" (Prasad,
2005, p. 40). Through hermeneutics, we examined not only
the story itself but also the context of each story. The "exami-
nation of the context [of each story] sheds light on the [story]
itself, whereas an examination of the text, in its turn, [illumi-
nated] our understanding of [each story's] context" (Prasad,
2005, p. 35). Moreover, studies using these methods "illus-
trate how lives can be understood, revealed and transformed
in stories and by the very act of storytelling" (Sandelowski,
1991, p. 163). Thus, by using hermeneutics, we were able to
go beyond each participant's story (or stories) at face value
and discern the functions of mentoring each story provided.
Before getting to the results, it is important to illuminate
this hermeneutical analysis method with an example, rather
than just the description provided above. Let us use one of
the stories we gathered to illustrate this method. This tech-
nology director tells a story to his protégé regarding when he
first started his career. He made a significant error by delet-
ing a mail system on the organization's server:
I was starting, my very first year, and, I blew it. I blew it bad. My
boss told me to delete a system. It was an email system where it
was located. So he said "Delete the mail system." So I went and
found a directory that said "mail" and I deleted it. And then
about a half an hour later, 4:30 in the afternoon, the phone
started ringing. People couldn't print, and I didn't think anything
of it, and everyone said we will deal with it in the morning.
When I got in at 7:30 the next morning, people couldn't log onto
the system because that directory that said "mail" on it held all
of the information for people to get on: passwords, print
passwords, everything else. And there was a group of about 200
to 250 people . . . that couldn't work. It was bad.
Although the appearance of this story seems like just a tale
of making a mistake early in one's career, the authentic
meaning, however, is much more. Using hermeneutics as
our analytical method pushed us to not analyze the story by
the words or sentences, but by the larger message. Being
forced to think about the story as a whole, to understand the
context, helped us see that the mentor, in telling this story to
his protégé, is saying that everyone makes mistakes--that it
is okay to fail.
Therefore, it was our method to take the story's informa-
tion and, working independently, code it according to men-
toring functions from the literature. We started with the list
of definitions provided by D'Abate et al. (2003) for 23 dif-
ferent mentoring functions and whittled that down to 12
functions that could possibly be served by storytelling. The
excluded 11 functions could not be achieved via storytelling
because they described activities that a mentor and protégé
would actually do together (such as collaborating, when the
pair actually work together; observing, when the mentor

Note. These functions were derived from D'Abate, Eddy, and Tannenbaum's (2003) framework of mentoring and developmental interaction functions. A
number of functions from that framework did not apply to the current study because they involved activities that a mentor and protégé would actually
do together (e.g., a mentor observing a protégé, a mentor providing a protégé with an opportunity to practice a skill), rather than functions that could be
served by a story (e.g., a mentor encouraging a protégé with his or her story). Some functions resulted in equal frequencies; their rank is the same and is
indicated with an asterisk * or **.
observes the protégé for developmental feedback; or intro-
ducing, when the mentor aids the protégé's career progres-
sion via contacts and networking). Table 1 lists the resulting
12 mentoring functions, grouped into three categories that
had potential for being served by storytelling. This coding
taxonomy (LeCompte, 2000) was the basis for our herme-
neutical analysis; in other words, it was our coding schema
whereby we coded the overall message of each story for the
functions it was serving.
To further clarify our method, we coded the sample story
above as providing the emotional support function of affir-
mation by offering the protégé support in the form of accep-
tance and confirmation. This story also served a teaching
function--in the sample text, the mentor was teaching the
protégé about failure. As the mentor stated,
I was trying to teach [my protégé] that it's not failing that is the
issue here. It's [how] you deal with the failure [and] what you
learned from the failure.
Validity Issues
First, in regard to data saturation, which is a key component
in the validity of research findings (Fusch & Ness, 2015),
we subscribed to general convention among qualitative
researchers. For example, Guest, Bunce, and Johnson
(2006) note, "Twelve interviews should suffice" with larger
samples for less clear research questions (p. 79), and Fusch
and Ness (2015) indicate that saturation occurs when addi-
tional data results in the same coding and themes. So, while
"there is no one-size-fits-all method to reach data satura-
tion" (Fusch & Ness, 2015, p. 1,409), we recognized we
had a clearly defined research question and coding schema,
so we assumed data saturation was reached when each
function we were coding for was represented--with some
functions present in more than 20 stories. Thus, for this
study, data saturation was achieved with 48 stories culled
from 39 interviewees.
Second, in keeping with methods of establishing validity
in qualitative studies, three different procedures were used to
determine the credibility of the inferences drawn from the
data (i.e., the credibility of the research findings; Creswell &
Miller, 2000; LeCompte, 2000). First, a researcher-based
lens (Creswell & Miller, 2000) was applied to check reliabil-
ity using Holsti's (1969) method. We computed "the ratio of
coding agreements to the total number of coding decisions"
by comparing the coding patterns of one researcher against
the other researcher (Holsti, 1969, p. 140). For example, if
the researchers made 20 coding decisions and agreed on 15
of them, our coefficient of reliability (CR) would be .75. In
this case, with agreement on 95 out of 112 pieces of data
coded, an 85% CR or level of interrater agreement was
D'Abate and Alpert 7
achieved. Second, a participant-based lens was applied in the
form of member checking. Given the high-level positions of
many of our interviewees, we were not able to meet with
them a second time for the participants to confirm how the
data were interpreted (Creswell & Miller, 2000). Instead, we
relied on data from the participants themselves at the time of
the interview. Recall that the data collection process involved
asking participants to share stories from their own mentoring
interactions, as well as inviting participants to explain what
they thought they had learned (or in the case of mentors,
what they thought they had taught) through the story in ques-
tion. These data (kept separate from the story text during the
coding process) helped establish validity (see "Validity"
under "Results" section) and support "the `goodness' of ana-
lyzed data" as it allowed the researchers to double check that
the codes applied (and inferences drawn) were in agreement
with what the participants thought they had learned or taught
(LeCompte, 2000, p. 152). Third, Creswell and Miller
explain rich, thick description as another method of estab-
lishing validity in qualitative research. Providing as much
description as possible to the reader "creates verisimilitude";
in other words, the inclusion of extensive detail "produce[s]
for readers the feeling that they have experienced or could
experience, the events being described in a study"--in this
case, making the reader understand what it is/was like to hear
a story from a mentor firsthand (Creswell & Miller, 2000, p.
129). For this reason, we present extensive description of the
storytelling data collected.
Results
The 39 interviews provided 48 stories rich in detail and sig-
nificantly different from one another. For example, some of
the stories told were in the third person, were short and
straight to the point, and used sayings to help clarify the
point to the protégé. Other stories were actual experiences of
the interviewee or the interviewee's mentor. These stories
were effective because they produced emotion, sometimes
even laughter or tears, out of both the protégé and the mentor.
At the same time, other personal stories were told to bring a
sense of relief to the protégés and to let them know that they
are not alone--that certain situations happen to everyone.
Mentoring Functions Served
Analysis of the interview data demonstrated that the stories
mentors tell their protégés serve a variety of key mentoring
functions--some serving one function while others serving
several (see Table 1 for frequency/percentages of functions
being represented in stories, as well as rank from most fre-
quently served mentoring function to least).
[add paragraph indent]For example, a Director of Fixed
Income Analytics reported telling her protégés a story of the
challenge she had in trying to sell her company's product to
Company X:
I was selling into Boston for years and years, and [Company X]
bought every product from every other vendor but me . . . I was
trying to figure out how I [could] get into [Company X]. So I
would visit them consistently, build relationships, and I kept
calling and calling on them . . . And what happened, just in
conversations, is they said that they get financial data from
many different sources and there's a lot of time they have to
[devote to] maintain that data for the quality. And the data
actually is the basis for compensation for the portfolio managers
. . . so it's very critical data. And so, they're getting it from all of
these different sources and it's very expensive data management.
Well, I knew . . . that we did the same thing for our own system.
So . . . I arranged for us to do what is called a feed of data, a data
feed to [Company X]. Now this goes back over ten years ago
when this was not popular. Now this is a very big thing. So this
was a new product for our company. We made gobs of money,
and they basically told me anytime they needed more data they
would call me. So it was like a cash cow. So, it really was
figuring out their need and being persistent and no other vendor
could do that . . . And now it's big business, but in those years, it
wasn't. The story is talking about persistence, about not giving
up because they didn't close the door in my face. They always
said, "We have no need for your product," but I kept the
conversation going.
Textual analysis showed that multiple mentoring func-
tions were served by this story including teaching, role mod-
eling, encouraging and motivating, problem solving, and
socialization to the sales industry. First, this story provided
the function of teaching by helping protégés learn how to be
consultants and how to gain the trust of the client. Second,
this story also provided the functions of role modeling and
encouraging with its references to persistence and not giving
up. This mentor's protégés are not only able to learn from
this example, but also, by seeing that their mentor did not
give up when facing a challenge, the story encourages and
motivates them not to give up when a situation becomes dif-
ficult. Third, the role modeling function is also served by this
story. As the interviewee explained,
[The story] talks about figuring out the [customer's] need . . .
You've got to figure out the need and see what in my tool chest
meets that need?
Finally, the story teaches protégés about the sales industry
and the challenges they could possibly face when working in
the field of sales (i.e., a socialization function).
Most Prevalent Functions
When examining the interview data, it appears that most of
the functions served by the stories were teaching and role
modeling, with 23 (48%) and 21 (44%) stories exhibiting
these functions, respectively. Socialization was also prevalent
in the stories with 13 (27%) of the stories demonstrating this
function. Calming was served by 19% of the stories, encour-
agement by 17%, problem solving and confidence building
8 SAGE Open
by 15%, and direction and personal/emotional support were
served by 8% of the stories. The most frequent emotional sup-
port function served was affirmation with a frequency of 10
(or 21%). The following example shared by a clinical psy-
chologist depicts a story that provides affirmation:
What I share [is] my first meeting as well as the continuation of
therapy with this particular difficult patient. I had this patient
that was 15 or 16 years old, and he walked into my office. All I
knew about him prior to walking into my office was that he had
been in the foster care system for probably about a decade, so
virtually for all of his life, that he had committed arson, has been
convicted of arson, and had been in juvenile hall. He had a
record, and he was probably in gangs . . . He was living at a
halfway house at that point since no foster family wanted him.
What I share with [my protégé] was . . . this 15 or 16 year old
boy walked into my office and he closed the door and I was
sitting in a chair which was in the middle of my office, and he
proceeded in a very menacing way of walking 360 degrees
around my chair. He was trying to set his territory. He was trying
to let me know that he was a dangerous fellow. And then he
pulled out his knife, it was about six or eight inches [long] and
said, "I'll just use this," and started flicking at his fingernails. So
clearly his communication to me was that he has always been in
charge or that he feels that he has a need to be that way because
he is always being threatened and that he was not going to be
easily engaged in the process. I, then, share with her that after he
had finished walking around me, this 15 or 16 year old boy with
his knife, . . . the first thing that I said to him was, "In this room,
everybody stays safe, so I would appreciate it if you would take
your knife and put it outside and then come back in," which he
did. I think he was a little disarmed by the fact that I wasn't
freaking out. I didn't show him fear . . . He then came back in
and he wasn't going to talk and he was just doing this because he
was mandated by the court as part of his probation and I said,
"Fine, do whatever you want. Have you ever done this before?"
He said, "Oh yeah. They always drag me to this or that or
whatever, but this is stupid . . . No one is going to analyze me."
[To which] I opened up a cabinet and said, "Got a lot of stuff in
here. Anything interest you?" To which this 16 year old [tough
kid] pulls out Candy Land.
Through hearing this story, the protégé was able to realize
that she was not alone and many psychologists have experi-
enced a situation with a difficult patient. This valuable bit of
affirmation came along with a key teaching moment--help-
ing the protégé learn skills for communicating with challeng-
ing patients.
Another story provided by an attorney provides a differ-
ent perspective on the teaching function of mentoring:
One story was actually a story that was told to me, and it is . . .
useful in learning how to argue an appeal. It [is] . . . about [a
lawyer who] had gone up to the Court of Appeals to argue a
case. He was the respondent. The appellant got up and argued
and beat the crap out of the appellant. So when he got up, he
said, "If the court has no questions, I'll rest on my brief." In the
course of time, he won the appeal, and he sent the client a bill for
$15,000. The client called him up and said, "You know, that is a
lot of money. You said like five words." He said, "You are right.
I will send you a new bill . . . A trip to the Court of Appeals and
argument is $1,000. Knowing when to shut up $14,000."
In essence, her mentor was teaching her how to argue an
appeal and that:
You have to know when not to talk . . . [and] when to stop
talking.
As for confidence building (a form of social­emotional
support), a physician reported telling the following story to
medical school students who are smart but (according to her)
not very sure of themselves--this is not a story she tells to
students who exude arrogance in any way, but to those who
need to know it is okay to be assertive sometimes in their
medical careers. According to this mentor,
They have to know that there is a place for assertiveness . . . One
of the stories I tell is one where I was an intern and . . . the low
man on the totem pole. A ten year old girl came in unconscious
and she was found to be a juvenile diabetic. As the first person
to see her, I got close to her grandmother who was actually
watching her over Christmas break while her parents were away.
The grandmother was quite agitated, of course. This happened
all of a sudden and the patient was going into shock, so I was
with them first and for most of the time. I felt that she needed
more fluids. My senior resident disagreed and I stayed [with] her
all night and kept turning up her IV to give her more fluids. He
would come in and get very agitated with me because he
disagreed. He lowered the IV rates, and I was in a difficult
situation because I felt I was inexperienced, but I wanted to trust
my gut reaction. But I kept sneaking the IV in, and I stayed with
her all night as she went into shock. And it got worse, and she
eventually had to go to the operating room . . . The surgeon who
went in was horrified and said he hadn't seen anything like that
in a child in his career. She died, and I was touched deeply by it.
I had gotten close to the family and the girl and [I] was
emotionally conflicted because I felt like I could have saved her
if I had stood up [more] for myself . . . In medicine, when
someone dies, we have what is called a morbidity and mortality
conference where they go over the case and see why someone
died. It was very emotional for me and the people who were
supporting the senior resident who had presented his case to put
himself in a better light. I got angry and told them . . . "I don't
make a good Nazi. I didn't want to follow orders." And they
were saying, "But you are only an intern and you were supposed
to follow orders and you didn't follow orders." The surgeon
supported me, but, because of my outburst, they threatened to
kick me out of the program and, at that point, I had to decide . .
. "Well," I said, "then kick me out. I feel like what I did was
responsible, and I took care of my patient the best way I could."
. . . There is a downside to not being assertive when deep down
you know that you are right.
Given that mentoring can serve three high-level functions
(learning, emotional support, and career progression), it is
D'Abate and Alpert 9
also important to recognize that one story alone can accom-
plish all three functions. Analysis of the following story from
an Executive Vice President of Sales shows that the sharing
of a personal career experience can satisfy role modeling
(learning), affirmation (emotional support), and socialization
(career progression) needs for a protégé:
There was a new buyer at [Superbig Grocery Store]. Sales in the
first six months were through the roof. We were so pleased . . . I
went in with a sales report and an award. We had, at these times
. . . little . . . trophies. So I gave him the sales report, and he took
the report and ripped it up and threw it in the garbage. And I was
with a broker sitting next to me, and I looked at the broker and
he didn't say a word and gave me no direction. I was like, "Oh
boy, what do I do now?" Well, we would like to present you with
this . . . award. I gave him the little trophy, and he took it and
threw it in the garbage. I started sweating. I felt it dripping down
the sides of my body. He says, "Do you know what you are
doing right now?" And I said to him, "I have no idea what I am
doing right now." Well, he said something like "I was wasting
his time and my time" and he said, "there is only one way to sell
apple juice, 99 cents." Well, I said, "Listen, at 99 cents, I lose
money." He says, "You are not listening to me. That is the only
way to sell the product, 99 cents. Alright? This meeting is over.
Get out of here."And I said, "Okay."And I got up and the broker
followed me out. And we are in the hallway and I said, "Oh
man!" And the broker says to me, "You were great in there." I
said "What? I was great in there?" He says, "You were great." I
said "How? Were you in the same meeting that I was in? Because
that meeting in there, that was not great!" He says, "He was
trying to get you upset. He was trying to get you mad. He was
trying to get something out of you, and you didn't let him get to
you." And I said, "Well, I didn't do that on purpose because I
was really scared in there." Turned out, the second we left the
office, he went to the garbage and he took out the trophy, and he
ran down the hall to one of the owners of [Superbig Grocery
Store] . . . and he says, "Look at what I just won! Look at what I
just got us!" So he was trying to get me upset. This is some of
the enjoyment he got in dealing with the power. He is the buyer.
That is where the power is. I'm the salesman. I'm the low level
guy and, by not overreacting and by not getting into a fight, he
took a liking to me and he thought I was honest when I said I
can't afford this.
In terms of role modeling, the story itself is about how the
mentor dealt with this tough situation, which provides an
example of how the mentee might deal with one too. In addi-
tion, the text of this story serves a valuable socialization
function--telling the protégé how things work in this field.
Finally, as the interviewee himself noted,
[There are] a lot of situations where buyers have been rude,
crude, mean, . . . and it is okay to take it . . . You can't win every
battle. You are going to lose some. It's okay to just go back and
try again.
That statement alone explains why this narrative provides
acceptance and affirmation to a protégé who hears it.
Validity
As described earlier, one of several methods utilized to estab-
lish validity in this qualitative, exploratory study was mem-
ber checking (Creswell & Miller, 2000). Indeed, the textual
data of the stories paired with member-checking data (gath-
ered at the time of the interviews, but kept separate during
hermeneutical/textual analysis) did provide a good bit of evi-
dence that the inferences drawn were in agreement with what
the participants thought they were teaching or learning. For
example, we coded the following story from a global market
research executive as serving a role modeling function of
mentoring:
This is a story [about something that took place] at a very big
meeting with a very large, very well-known technology firm.
We were bidding on a multi-million dollar study and project,
and it was a bunch of our senior people which included our CEO
and our President, and we worked through lunch. It was a fairly
hard-fought thing because the company was fairly rigid in its
thinking at that time, and they were also very strict on pricing.
And we're a quality firm . . . we demand that we, at least, get
paid for the type of work that we do . . . But we also brought in
a boxed lunch while we worked through lunch over this thing.
Lunch was on paper plates (even though they had [porcelain]
dishes there), [and] when lunch was over, our CEO (while still
talking and making his point) was going around picking up the
paper plates and putting them in the garbage. When the meeting
was over, the CEO said, "I wanted to show them that we have
humility" . . . he was teaching a lesson . . . "We're there to be
their consultants, and we will do anything for them. And, while
I'm not telling them I'm going to go there and pick up their
garbage for them, but just the fact that they could see the CEO
of this fairly large research firm get up and help clean off the
table." He didn't state that he was doing [it], he just did it as a
matter of fact . . . as if he were in his own home.
When asked what this story about a CEO's humility taught
him, the participant explained the role modeling value. He
explained how this story would show a protégé:
That I'm humble and not rigid [and it demonstrates] that we are
here to serve them . . . that was the point he was making [in
picking up after everyone].
So, the way in which our coding aligned with the partici-
pant's member checking data helps establish validity in this
qualitative study.
Another example from an executive communications
coach also illustrates this validation process. This is a story
she has told her protégé:
One of my clients asked me to shadow a group of their sales
people and go out on client meetings. So we figured out a way to
introduce me [as] a consultant that [could help them] . . . So I
went out on a meeting with a consultant who was meeting with
an older woman, her two sons, her accountant, and her attorney.
And I said, "You know . . . if you were this guy going out to meet
10 SAGE Open
with this group of people . . . who is the decision maker there?"
And he said, "Well, the woman, of course. It's her money . . .
She had herself, two sons (an older and a younger son), an
accountant, an attorney, and the investment planner [who all] sat
in front of them and gave all of the eye contact and delivered all
of the data to the accountant who he thought was the person who
managed the mother's estate. When they were all finished, he
gave a little eye contact to the attorney and to the woman and the
older brother, and as we walked out the door, I followed behind.
And the attorney and the accountant walked out the door, and
the mother and two sons followed behind on either side. And she
first looked at the older son and said, "So, what do you think?"
And he said, "I don't know. I wouldn't work with him. He didn't
pay me no mind." [And then] the mother asked the other brother,
"What do you think?" And he said, "You know, Mom, it is your
estate. But when you are gone, I'm not sure I really want to work
with this company. This guy seems like all he wants to do is
work with the decision makers. We want to have a personal
relationship with the guy that is managing our money." So she
says okay and the company did lose that account. And it took
this investment manager a long time to regain the confidence of
the woman, and he had to spend a lot more time playing golf
with the younger brother and doing some other things to get to
know them.
Our hermeneutical analysis coded this story for serving the
teaching function of mentoring. Indeed, member checking
data from the participant confirmed this interpretation. She
explained,
Once you lose an account, it is harder to start and try to get a new
account. So when I had my protégé think about the story I just
told, we revamped his game plan for [his upcoming] meeting
because what I made him think about is in that list of data that
you want to present at the meeting, how much of it [concerns]
the younger folks--the people who are going to inherit that
estate. And he said, "You are right." There are a couple of things
they are going to be concerned about. And I said the other thing
you need to do is to look at them when you are talking about that
data. Because if everybody is invited to that meeting, everybody
deserves equal time. Those kids wouldn't have been invited if
mom didn't see them as influencers and have some input on her
decision . . . the story was what taught him to be aware of,
"[Darn], I could lose this account if I don't pay attention to who
the influencers are beyond the decision maker."
It is reassuring that our own analytical coding process
aligned with the interpretations of the participants them-
selves. That these data were kept separate from the story data
during our coding process helped us confirm that we did "get
it right" (LeCompte, 2000, p. 152).
Discussion
The current study set out to fill a gap in the literature--to
understand what occurs in the mentoring interaction (Hezlett,
2005) or in what Lester and Johnson (1981) call the "extended
dialogue" (p. 119) between a mentor and protégé. Although a
few studies have used storytelling as a means of collecting
data on when, where, and why mentoring exchanges take
place (e.g., Spezzini, Austin, Abbott, & Littleton, 2009) or
raised the possibility that stories might play a role in mentor-
ing relationships (e.g., Chan, 2008; Jones & Brown, 2011),
the content of mentoring stories and the functions they serve
have remained unclear. In response, the current study pro-
vided evidence that storytelling is an important mentoring
practice. Both hermeneutical analysis of the narrative text of
the stories, as well as comments by the interviewees them-
selves, showed that a mentor's stories can serve key mentor-
ing functions.
Further analysis might suggest why storytelling works in
mentoring interactions. Our participants helped us understand
the power of storytelling may rest in a number of key charac-
teristics. First, stories are real in some way so they are relat-
able. A pharmaceutical communications executive told us,
The point of [the story] is that it make[s] it real . . . [this is what]
really makes a difference, that sinks in.
A clinical psychologist added,
I feel that storytelling is a really important way of communicating
in a mentoring relationship. A person relates more to a story than
to a lecture.
Indeed, it may be the emotion inherent in a story that makes
them more relatable. A technology director told us,
[Stories are] hard and emotional. The reason that storytelling
works is that you have to find the emotional ground.
Another reason storytelling might be powerful in mentoring
is because stories are rich in detail which makes them more
impactful than simple instructions or advice given without
the context of a story. One of our interviewees, a doctor,
explained,
Stories are also more than just words; they convey images.
A similar explanation was provided by the founder of a con-
sumer food products firm who told us,
It helps to give them some color, some technicolor behind an
issue . . . By giving them the experience in a story, it . . . makes
it more vivid. It makes it more memorable. It's not just a piece
of advice; it's advice that comes from an experience.
In summation, stories are emotional. They are memora-
ble. They do not just tell the protégé what to do or deliver
advice on a problem. Instead, they inspire. The results of this
study demonstrate that because stories are more than just
words, protégés are able to remember pieces of stories their
mentors told them and apply them to their everyday life.
Stories, therefore, are impactful--so impactful, that they
D'Abate and Alpert 11
might go beyond the relationship between just one mentor
and one protégé to become company folklore. As one media
director explained,
I do know that parts of the stories [I tell] get retold because I
hear these people . . . who repeat them when I sit in the
background and watch them make presentations or interact with
our internal or external clients. I hear pieces of these stories get
repeated which I like because it is usually done not identical to
the way that I've retold them. They were extrapolations of the
information I was trying to convey to them.
Future Research and Limitations
Based on the results of the current study, future research
might take alternate data collection paths to explore other
benefits of storytelling as a means for mentoring or examine
how storytelling affects other aspects of mentoring (e.g.,
mentoring phases). First, out of the 39 interviews, nine (23%)
could not be used for data because the interviewee shared
stories about when they were mentoring or being mentored,
rather than the story they or their mentor used in a develop-
mental interaction. To avoid this problem, future research
might approach the semistructured interview so the inter-
viewee is prompted in a different way:
Pretend I [the interviewer] am your protégé. What's an example
of a story you would tell me to make a point?
By placing the interviewee in a hypothetical situation, the
interviewee may be able to recall a story they told to their
actual protégé(s) they could not without such a prompt. In
addition, the semistructured interview should include not
only a definition of mentoring but also the definition of a
story. Several interviewees were confused with the term story
and did not realize that the experiences they share with their
protégés or peers might actually include such stories.
Clarification of the term and examples or personal experi-
ences the interviewees had that fall under the definition of
stories would be very useful toward the success of future
studies. Finally, since this study examined how protégés
learned through storytelling, future research might also exam-
ine the power of storytelling in different phases of mentoring
(i.e., initiation, cultivation, separation, and redefinition; Chao,
1997; Kram, 1983; Levinson et al., 1978). The question might
be how different types of stories are used to achieve varying
developmental goals in different phases of mentoring.
Conclusion
Despite these limitations and suggestions for future research,
the current research offers a perspective on mentoring that has
not yet been explored in depth. It suggests that protégés learn
from their mentors through mentoring interactions, specifically
through the stories that mentors tell their protégés. As Hezlett
wrote (2005), " . . . the literature offers only limited insights on
how protégés learn from their mentors . . . " (p. 512), so there is
still a need to examine what and how protégés learn from their
mentors.Authors have only recently started to identify storytell-
ing as a potential mechanism for mentoring (e.g., Chan, 2008),
but have not provided data on story content, functions, or prac-
tices. This study satisfies at least part of that need. It suggests
that stories are one way that protégés learn with the stories serv-
ing learning, emotional support, and/or career progression func-
tions of mentoring. This exploratory study demonstrates that
storytelling is, indeed, a powerful and effective mode and
method of mentoring.
Appendix
Semistructured Interview Protocol
1. Initial biographical data: Gender; age range
2. Job/occupation: What is your job? What are some of
the functions of your position? How would you
describe it in layman's terms? What word best
describes your occupation?
3. Tenure: How long have you had this position at this
company? If you worked in this field before coming
to your present company, how long (altogether) have
you been in this field?
4. Career stage: Would you best describe yourself in the
early stages of your career? Mid-career? Or nearing
retirement?
5. Mentoring definition: Let me show you a definition
of mentoring. It will help to ensure that we are on the
same page when we discuss your experiences . . .
Mentoring has been defined as a partnership or a developmental
interaction in which a senior colleague (the mentor) provides
support and guidance to a junior colleague (the mentee) for the
mentee's personal/professional growth. The mentor is usually
focused on giving the mentee learning, career development, and/
or emotional support through a variety of behaviors such as
coaching, goal-setting, role modeling, encouraging, and
socializing or orienting the mentee to the company or industry.
Oftentimes, the mentor is senior to the mentee, but s/he can be
on the same hierarchical level (peer mentoring), junior to the
mentor (reverse mentoring), or part of a group of mentors (group
mentoring) (D'Abate, Eddy, & Tannenbaum, 2003; Eby, Rhodes,
& Allen, 2007; Eddy, D'Abate, Tannenbaum, Givens-Skeaton,
& Robinson, 2006; Kram, 1985; Lentz & Allen, 2009).
Does that make sense to you? Do you see the mentoring rela-
tionship differently? If so, how?
6. Given that definition, please think of someone that
you mentor (if they do not mentor someone [or have
not in the past], go to Question 7). No names please.
Does this person work at the same company that you
do? Do you mentor them through a formal mentoring
program or informally? If informal, how did your
relationship develop? Is there a particular story you
12 SAGE Open
have told your mentee? You might have told this
story to help them understand a point you were trying
to make, to teach them something, to share your
expertise, or some other reason. Please describe this
story in detail. Why did you tell your mentee this
story? Is this story based on your own personal expe-
rience? If not, where did you hear this story? Did you
make it up? Do you think telling this story helped
your mentee? How so? What do you want your men-
tee to remember or learn from this story?
7. Okay, let us go back to the definition of mentoring
(see above). Now, think of someone who has men-
tored you (if you have not been a mentee, then go to
end). Again, no names please. Can you recall a story
that your mentor told you as part of your mentoring
relationship or interactions? Please describe the story
in detail. How did you feel after hearing this story?
What did you learn from this story, how did it affect/
help you, and how did you apply these lessons learned
toward your career?
