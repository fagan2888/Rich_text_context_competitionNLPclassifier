Article
The project on which this present discussion draws asks how
understanding work as sacred and embracing a view of reli-
gion as concerned with social justice enlivens and deepens
sociological understandings of religion. The project locates
religious experiences within the everyday lives of practitio-
ners as they go to work, spend time with their families, and
care for others in their communities. I investigate these
dimensions by illuminating areas of social life in which the
boundaries of the sacred and the secular are being pushed
and negotiated through interfaith labor activism.
Interfaith Worker Justice of Greater Kansas City (IWJ-
GKC), at the time of the study, was a diverse coalition of
religious practitioners and labor union members that mobi-
lized to promote worker justice. They worked to fight eco-
nomic, racial, and gender inequalities through the support of
unionization, fair wages, keeping immigrant families united,
and equal access to health care and jobs. Interfaith Worker
Justice (IWJ)--the national organization located in Chicago
of which IWJ-GKC became an affiliate--is currently focused
on mobilizing congregation-based and interfaith coalitions
for the fight against economic inequality. At the local level,
activists are challenged by the effort to push the cultures of
their faith communities from mercy and service work to cul-
tures focused on activism based on a moral responsibility to
principles of human rights and social justice.
In this work, I not only look to understand lived religion
but also how lived religion interplays with lived labor activ-
ism and class in everyday experiences. IWJ-GKC partici-
pants claimed work and activism as realms of the sacred,
imbued with religious meaning and inhabited by forms of
religious practice. By organizing low-wage workers, meet-
ing with union and company representatives, passing out fli-
ers, and raising a billboard on I-70 which read "Love the
Immigrant as Yourself," members of IWJ-GKC engaged
practices that are at the same time religious as they are politi-
cal and oriented toward class consciousness. In so doing,
they not only engaged forms of religious practice that carried
into everyday lived experience, through their struggles and
interactions they built new varieties of institutional ties,
thereby transforming the American religious scene.
The present article is not about the ethnography and its find-
ings. Rather, it is a reflection on the experience of doing the
ethnography and treats the research process and its results as
the media through which to consider important theoretical and
conceptual positionings. I draw on my experiences of studying
lived religion to explore three levels of intersubjectivity
implicated in the process of doing research with religious
persons who view religious--and other institutional--bound-
aries as permeable. When entering the field, the ethnographer's
past, present, and future are implicated in the relationships one
develops with research participants and subsequently affect the
kinds of data gathered. In lived reality--that which treats the
researcher as a part of the lived experiences of others--the
lives of the researcher and the researched become intricately

"I Grew Up a Working-Class
Evangelical": Lived Experience,
Intersubjectivity, and Ethnography
Amy M. Lane1
Abstract
This article explores three ways intersubjectivity is implicated in an ethnography of the lived experience of members of
an interfaith and labor coalition. First challenging dualistic thinking and the strict application of typologies, I emphasize the
importance of understanding faith practices through the study of lived experience. When one studies lived experience,
several layers of intersubjectivity are at play. Because I grew up in a religious, working-class family, aspects of my life
now serve as cultural capital in understanding the daily challenges of coalition participants who redefine the institutional
boundaries between religion and work. Furthermore, field interactions between the researcher and participants affect
members' explanations of their activism. Finally, the life of the ethnographer is affected by the overall experience of fieldwork.

intertwined, especially in ethnographic projects (Neitz,
2002). While it is possible to use aspects of one's own lived
experience to understand and engage others, the lived experi-
ences of the researcher can also serve as the media through
which people of faith daily negotiate their own forms of reli-
gious practice. In taking these processes and interactions
seriously, the lived reality of the ethnographer himself or her-
self may be changed. These intersubjective processes are
illustrated below by connections to the ethnographic experi-
ence and the resultant data derived from my study with
IWJ-GKC.
First, however, to contextualize the significance of inter-
subjectivity in the research process, I briefly discuss the limi-
tations of dualistic thinking and the application of rigid
typologies. Viewing ethnographic work through the lens of
intersubjectivity challenges these ways of categorizing the
social world, and thereby the ethnographer gets closer to the
lived experience of research participants. This closeness to
lived experience, through the interactive intersections of
intersubjectivity, provides a deeper look into the ways cul-
ture and structure penetrate human lives through their every-
day practice.
Literature Review
Deposing Dualisms
The explanatory power of studying from the perspective of
lived experience means that all human action can be viewed
without the risk of dismissal through the use of categories
rooted in the biases of classical Western philosophy and
social science. Much of this dismissal is due to dualistic
thinking which placed "reason" in the realm of the "mind"
and therefore it transcended lived experiences (Alcoff, 2000).
Similarly, much of classical sociology was based on this
dualism and therefore pitted the "subjective" against the
"objective." Because lived experience was viewed as a mat-
ter of the body--and not reason--"experiential qualities
[were submerged] in the psyche [and] sociology has tended
to argue that explorations of experience cannot be based on
empirical evidence, only `on nondemonstrable intuitions
about the "inner" content of mental states'" (Ostrow, 1990,
p. 5).
Alcoff (2000) points out that the "mind-body dualism"
which permeates Western thinking can be traced "as far back
as Plato"; this dualism assumed that lived experience rested
in the body--primarily experienced by women--whereas
reason--primarily belonging to men--inhabited the mind
(p. 41). Alcoff argues simply moving women into the realm
of the mind while maintaining the mind­body dualism is not
the solution because this move effectively disregards the
lived experiences that are central to human life and maintains
the masculinist notion that mind and body are always sepa-
rate. What we need, instead, is to bring theory and experi-
ence closer together, understanding that theory--also
discourse--and experience are "imperfectly aligned, with
locations of disjuncture" (Alcoff, 2000, p. 47). Weber under-
stood this, as Ostrow (1990) argues. Even while proposing
ideal types, Weber emphasized the importance of under-
standing lived experience through his concept Verstehen.
From Weber's perspective, this understanding of lived expe-
rience was "an absolute prerequisite for the articulation of
social structure" (Ostrow, 1990, p. 6).
Deposing Typologies
By emphasizing the intersubjective nature of social life and
the importance of investigating lived experience, typolo-
gies--rigidly applied--become problematic. While, as
Jackson (1998) asserts, any individual "universalizes and
objectifies his or her epoch . . . the singular I cannot be
reduced to this otherness"; through lived experience, an indi-
vidual subjects "objective" forms--such as class, gender,
race, and history--to her "will" (p. 8). Furthermore, "though
individuals speak, act, and work toward belonging in a world
of others, they simultaneously strive to experience them-
selves as world makers" (Jackson, 1998, p. 8). This kind of
explanation of the experience of "existence" raises the ques-
tion of how, as social scientists, we use typologies.
In Tricks of the Trade, one of Becker's (1998) "tricks" is
to turn "types" of people into "activities" (p. 44). Jackson
(1998), like Becker, argues that in many ways, reducing indi-
viduals to objective categories devalues them as human
beings. By imposing rigid typologies on persons we observe
and study, we run the risk of devaluing them and rendering
their lived experiences insignificant. Munson (2007) brings
this insight into the study of lived religion by suggesting that
researchers pay attention to the "polysemy" of social life to
notice that "religious beliefs, rituals, experiences, and expec-
tations overlap other domains of life. But why is this impor-
tant?" (p. 127). He argues that "the polysemy of social
situations . . . is a key concept in understanding social
change" (p. 128). Viewing social action in this way chal-
lenges rigid understandings of "types."
Seating Lived Experience: Lived Religion and
Intersubjectivity
Emphasizing lived experience as analytically important
means that we gain a better understanding of how religious
practitioners live their faiths and consequently, also gain a
fuller knowledge of religion in society. First, what consti-
tutes "religious experience"? Nelson (1997) asserts that reli-
gion "is a way of experiencing the world" (p. 5). Religious
experiences are, first, those experiences described as reli-
gious by people who live them (Nelson, 1997, p. 7). Nelson
(1997) argues further that all experiences, "no matter how
ordinary or mundane," can be considered religious experi-
ences if the practitioner describes them as such (p. 8).
Callahan (2008) likewise points out that the significance of
everyday life is frequently dismissed in studying religion for
Lane 3
the very fact that it is "mundane"; this dismissal is based on
dualistic thinking which places lived experience in the realm
of the "profane" while that which is considered extraordi-
nary--or religious--is purely "sacred" (p. 9). However, reli-
gion is lived through daily experiences and by focusing on
these experiences, scholars necessarily depose dualities and
typologies. Moving away from dualities and rigid applica-
tions of religious types involves intersubjective processes
and expands understandings of the workings of religions.
Because individuals construct faith through interactions
with religious histories and with religious others (Bender &
Cadge, 2006), intersubjectivity becomes a significant com-
ponent to understanding lived religion. Alcoff (2000) points
out that lived experience and intersubjectivity go hand-in-
hand. Furthermore, because we always exist in the world
rather than separate from the world, "lived experience is
open-ended, plural, fragmented, and shifting not because of
the limitations of language, but because of the nature of
embodied, temporal existence" (p. 49).
This assertion does not mean that history and culture are
ignored; rather, they are a part of the inhabited world which
is lived through embodiment and the inseparability of reason
and experience. Furthermore, structure is revealed, "Neither
in the hidden recesses of the psyche nor in the transpersonal
field of history and culture, but in the forms of encounter,
interaction, exchange, and dialogue of everyday life"
(Jackson, 1998, p. 207).
It is in this way that Alcoff (2000)--drawing on Merleau-
Ponty's work--brings theory and discourse closer to lived
experience. Experience can therefore be treated as worthy of
analysis because by erasing the mind­body dualism, we also
accept that understanding subjective realities and experi-
ences is as analytically significant as "objective" categoriza-
tion.1 Intersubjectivity--the notion that what is significant
about social life is that it is only made meaningful through
the mutual, embodied experiences of the world2--is central
to the study of lived experience, and therefore lived religion
because, to go back to Nelson (1997), religion is more than a
set of doctrines and institutions; it is a way of experiencing
the world.
Robert Orsi (2003) points out that intersubjectivity is cen-
tral to the study of lived religion on two levels: "First, it rec-
ognizes the intersubjective nature of individual, social,
cultural, and religious identities and indeed of reality itself"
(p. 174). This means that to understand how faith is lived by
contemporary persons and how the resources of faith com-
munities are brought closer to lived experience, a project
mustbesituatedwithinthecorridorsofdailylife(Ammerman,
2007; Bender, 2003; Bender & Cadge, 2006; Orsi, 1997).
Similarly applied to lived class, Fantasia (1988) points out
that within a capitalist system, the overall structure is set up
in such a way as to discourage workers from organizing.
Therefore,
To understand the dynamics of worker mobilization and
collective action, it is necessary to peer into the interstices of the
routinized collective bargaining system, where, in order to
realize their collective power against a wall of opposition,
workers are often forced to act independently of that system.
(p. 72)
This first level of intersubjectivity points to the impor-
tance of investigating lived experience whether studying
religion, labor activism, or some combination of the two.
A second way intersubjectivity is central to studies of
lived religion and lived class is by recognizing "the intersub-
jective nature of research and religion" (Orsi, 2003, p. 174).
Likewise, Jackson (1998) argues, "Some part of the ethnog-
rapher's own life experience always forms the basis for
approaching the other, just as the other must see something
of himself or herself in the ethnographer's actions, reactions,
and comportment" (p. 109); there is never "complete over-
lap" but there has to "be some recognition of common iden-
tity if any kind of interaction--self-interested or
otherwise--is to proceed" (p. 109).
Method
Between the fall of 2005 and the spring of 2008, I attended
monthly meetings of the general membership of IWJ-GKC
and meetings of the governing board and action committees,
along with fundraising events, rallies, religious services at
members' congregations, and group retreats. On these occa-
sions, I kept detailed notes in the moment as circumstances
allowed. At other times, such as during rallies or pickets
when my physical presence was centered in the experience, I
voice recorded reflections immediately following the events
and wrote field notes later.
I conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with
active members, had numerous conversations while in the
field, and had several telephone and email discussions. By
the end of the study, I was able to interview 10 core members
in depth. I used a non-rigid set of open interview questions to
get at core concepts and ideas, particularly related to the
meanings of faith in everyday experience. During the inter-
views, respondents told life and faith history narratives in the
ways they understood them. I used my interview schedule to
prompt interviewees to reflect on specific topics throughout
our conversations. The interviews were digitally recorded
and transcribed word-for-word. Furthermore, my fieldwork
and interviews were supplemented with national and local
news media resources to fill in and elaborate contextual
details. Overall, I found useful source material from media
resources from Kansas City, the state of Missouri, and
national sources.
Because I worked with a variety of data, I also used a
variety of techniques to make sense of the data. I used a com-
bination of deductive and inductive coding (LeCompte &
Schensul, 1999) to organize the data. My coding was par-
tially deductive (LeCompte & Schensul, 1999), in that some
codes came from the research questions that were informed
by the literature especially that which related to lived
4 SAGE Open
religion as described above. However, other codes were
formed inductively, in that I looked for items, patterns, and
structures in the data (LeCompte & Schensul, 1999). Finally,
throughout the coding process, following the advice of
LeCompte and Schensul (1999), I constantly referred back to
the research questions and the working outline of my project
to "check" that the coding process was not proceeding
circuitously.
Recognizing that my overall ethnographic work with its
focus on lived religion relates to Orsi's initial level of inter-
subjectivity as described above, I move forward to expand
upon Orsi's three-tiered, second-level of intersubjectivity. I
first discuss how the intersubjective nature of research and
religion implicated aspects of my (past­present) working-
class, (past) evangelical identity and how they surprisingly
became media through which relationships formed and
through which I engaged the worlds of IWJ-GKC members.
Second, I elaborate ways in which my lived experiences not
only helped in the formation of trusting relationships in the
field, they also fed back into IWJ-GKC members' interpreta-
tions of their own religious realities. Recognizing the dialec-
tical nature of relationships, I conclude by discussing how
my fieldwork was in dialogue with aspects of my lived real-
ity outside of the field.
Intersubjectivity: Biography as Capital
in the Field
The title of this article speaks from two past locations inter-
subjectively woven into my research. In the good, old evan-
gelical tradition of giving testimony I stake out claim to a
portion of my past implicated in researching an interfaith
coalition. As an evangelical, I was taught what "real reli-
gion" looks like. As an academic, I have been seeking to
understand what religion looks like in everyday life in the
context of the United States. The two are not incompatible.
Respecting people of faith also comes from my upbring-
ing. It was this respect that fostered openness to understand-
ing a complicated and complex relationship between
religious institutions and labor organizations throughout
U.S. labor history. It is also a position that does not view all
religion as incompatible with ideals of equality and justice.
As a person once committed to a particular brand of faith, I
have always known that religion happens not only in the
obvious places and in evident ways; rather, much of what
counts as faith practice to the faithful "cannot be neatly sepa-
rated from the other practices of everyday life, from the ways
that human beings work on the landscape" (Orsi, 1997, p. 7).
When I first started to engage the group by attending
monthly meetings, exchanging emails and phone calls, one
of the first questions asked of me was whether I am a person
of faith. I wanted to explain briefly my religious history
because there was initially a little tension over my role as an
academic researcher. Growing up in a faith context meant to
participants that I could at least "get" a portion of what they
were talking about. Interestingly, several people were excited
that as a past evangelical I had come to be interested in
social justice because they were looking to extend and diver-
sify the religious base of the organization. They thought that
maybe I could offer some insights into how to frame issues
to appeal to that crowd.
The title of this article is derived from a second location
based on a proclamation of class identity through class con-
sciousness. This class location invokes memories of picket
lines, United Automobile Workers (UAW) banners, and
union halls amidst the factory-dotted landscape in Flint,
Michigan. This is not an uncomplicated identity. Because I
have completed a PhD, I recognize the emergent difficulty of
any longer locating myself within the working class. But, as
cultural studies scholar Andy Medhurst (2000) notes, "My
own class history is central to my understanding of how cul-
ture works, and it would be disingenuous to pretend other-
wise" (p. 21). Reflections on the sometimes thorny paths
traveled by working-class kids transitioning into the aca-
demic world are not new (e.g., Mahony & Zmroczek, 1997;
Munt, 2000; Williams, 1979). However, my encounter with
class and class-ist dialogues within the university setting
suggests the need for further reflections on the ways class-
oriented assumptions are made within the very structure of
academic departments. Class is just as much about cultural
practices, performances, languages, and ideologies as it is
about occupation and materiality. Personal accounts of expe-
riencing an in-between class identity do not always attest to
the liberatory quality of fluidity and multiplicity.As Medhurst
(2000) points out, "Those triumphalist celebrations of fluid-
ity always overlook the fact that being unfixed, mobile, in-
between, can distress as much as it liberates. So my sense of
class identity is uncertain, torn and oscillating--caught on a
cultural cusp" (p. 20).
Before doing fieldwork, I knew that there was something
a little more difficult about my trek through the academy in
comparison with some of my colleagues. As such, I was not
naive about my class location; rather, it did not bubble to the
surface until my conversations in the field with working-
class women and men disentangled the piece of my identity I
had been hammering away at for several years through what
we call "professional socialization." In the field, that occa-
sional roadblock to academic success has become a form of
currency. Working-class culture is rarely viewed as cultural
capital. Its exchange value is devalued next to the pieces of
culture held and cultivated by the rapidly shrinking middle-
to-upper middle class in the United States. For the first time,
it did not count against me that my dad worked for General
Motors (GM) or that my mom moved in and out of jobs for
most of my life. No longer just "the university student here
to study us," I came to be seen as an active, supporting mem-
ber of an interfaith and labor coalition fighting for worker
justice.
What came as a greater surprise was how class came to be
the most important role played in becoming accepted as
Lane 5
more of an insider. For about 6 months, I attended meetings
and events. In the fall of 2006, a fundraiser was held for one
of IWJ-GKC's primary programs "Building Bridges." This is
a training program for low-income, minority women and
men to gain the necessary skills to be able to pass the initial
exams required for entering the building and trades profes-
sions. I sat at a table with seven active members of the group
and over dinner, they began to ask me about my life: where I
grew up, what my parents did, and so on. When I started to
talk about Flint, one of the women said, "Well, then. You do
get it! You know what we're talking about."
Once my class location was "exposed," people began to
talk to me differently. They shared their stories more openly.
They came to care about me as one of their own. My iden-
tity--person of faith/working class--is what made the proj-
ect make sense. It explained why I was there. Being able to
place me comfortably within a narrative construction of how
I came to be interested in labor and religion, my presence at
events and meetings became more "natural." I was later
asked to tell my story to new members of the group who
entered about 1 year later, so that they too could understand
why I was there. For once, growing up in Flint, Michigan,
did not count against me.
Intersubjectivity: The Interview
Context and the Co-Construction of
Religious Realities
I secondly describe a way in which a lived experience in the
preliminary stages of my research influenced how two mem-
bers of IWJ-GKC interpreted their roles as religious persons
in the fight for worker justice. If, as researchers, we recog-
nize that interviews are "reality-constructing, meaning-
making occasions" (Holstein & Gubrium, 1995, p. 4), it is
also important to point out that the meanings constructed
within the context of interviews can also become available in
other life-contexts. In keeping with my position that institu-
tional boundaries are fluid, some interview contexts become
locations in which respondents can work out interpretations
and meanings of their own social actions and subsequently
utilize these meanings in other contexts. In the interview,
religious and other realities can be co-constructed because of
the intersubjective nature of social life.
Before discovering IWJ-GKC, I conducted an exploratory
interview in St. Louis, Missouri, with an Episcopal minister
active in the coalition Jobs with Justice. She characterized
her work in the labor movement as moving beyond mercy
and service work and moving into activism. Mercy work is
what she said most clergy and lay people are comfortable
doing: collecting food for the food pantry, visiting the sick
and the elderly, working in a soup kitchen. She said, "Sure
this work is important, but God calls us to enact justice in this
world and therefore activism must be a part of our faith."
After having spent several months with IWJ-GKC, I
started to schedule interviews. In those interviews, I used the
minister's story to elicit reflections from IWJ-GKC members
on how they characterize their justice work. Interestingly,
this minister's story had an influence on two of my respon-
dents'conceptions of their justice work.Acouple weeks after
the interview in which I used this story, the phrase--from
mercy to activism--surfaced at a monthly meeting of the
general membership during the opening "reflection" con-
ducted by a woman I had just interviewed. She intermingled
this characterization of their justice work with a call to action
on increasing the minimum wage in the state of Missouri. I
had not previously heard this characterization used in the
context of an IWJ-GKC meeting.
Earlier in the summer of 2007, I interviewed a retired
United Methodist minister who also described her work with
the labor movement as beyond mercy work. She illustrated
this point with a story from the life of Moses. She told me the
fact that Pharaoh's daughter lifted Moses from the river was
an act of mercy. But what we are called to do is to go up that
river, see what is happening there that made the situation so
bad that Moses was put in the river in the first place and stop
it from happening. That is justice. The Reverend had clearly
already been thinking about her work as moving from mercy
to activism, but once discussed openly in the interview, she
also came to use the phrase during moments of reflection at
monthly meetings. In the interview context, when asked to
reflect on the meanings of justice work and service, she
pointed out that highlighting distinctions between the two
forms of action is a powerful way to describe the work and
faith-orientations of IWJ-GKC members.
Rather than looking at these moments as contaminating
the research context, I am more aware of the intersubjective
nature of doing fieldwork and interviews. I have viewed this
phrase as a useful analytical tool. Members of IWJ-GKC saw
it as a catchy phase to understand the work they are daily
carrying out in their communities. Transferred from one con-
text to another, this experience further attests to the permea-
bility of institutional boundaries. As Munson (2007) argues,
when we think about agency we need to see that it "can be
located in the spaces where multiple meanings overlap"
(p. 132).
Intersubjectivity: The Lived Reality of
the Researcher
A third way intersubjectivity has been enacted through this
project is in the dialogue with my own life, influenced by the
intersubjective experience of doing fieldwork. In some ways,
my past has been resurrected through my engagement with
members of IWJ-GKC. The implication of the resurrection
story is not that the same old thing has risen again, but that
something new is born out of the old. First, I finally got to
put to rest the evangelical "demons." I have been able to rec-
ognize the positive aspects of my faith upbringing and to
divorce them from the negative carryovers best illustrated by
those typical stories of oppression of women and sexuality
6 SAGE Open
along with the ever-present fear of hell. I had to exorcise this
demon because it bore direct implications on my fieldwork.
In the church where I grew up, on a typical Sunday morn-
ing, testimonies from members of the congregation would
follow rounds of choruses and hymns. We might hold hands
during songs or prayer, expressing a sense of unity. McGuire
(2008), drawing onAlfred Schutz's metaphor "making music
together," points out how in song, people have an intersub-
jective experience that produces "an experiential sense of
togetherness" (p. 112). These moments, while meaningful
and even beautiful, were called to mind in a way that led me
to resist engagement in some aspects of my fieldwork, early
on. When IWJ-GKC members held hands or sang songs
together--especially the same songs I sang as a youth--I
resisted full engagement. Because I wanted to be "present"
in my fieldwork in a way that I could hopefully come to
grasp the lived experience of interfaith labor activism, I
sought to quickly resolve my old hang-ups. Ruth Frankenberg
(2004) points out,
Ethnography immerses one in the subject--the line between
academy and religion/spirituality, between the rational and
irrational, believer and skeptic becomes blurred, so that
accounting for one's place in the field--reflexivity--helps to
"undo" some of the compartmentalization. (pp. 14-15)
The intersubjective experiences of religious expression in
the field helped me to gain a new understanding of my per-
sonal faith and further convinced me of the necessity to
understand religion as lived experience. Reflecting on years
of studying Buddhism, Liberman (2001) asks whether it is
problematic for the academic to become transformed by
practices observed in the field. He responds by asserting that
to be a dispassionate observer is to run the risk of missing
important religious practices and failing as an ethnographer.
Most interesting to me now, however, is the weight of class
on my conscious mind and how this intermingles with reflec-
tions on my upbringing and my relationship with my parents.
Because of this project, I have resurrected several memories
and I have come to appreciate my parents more. During my
fieldwork, I found myself talking more about my parents than
I had in a long while. The fact that my class and religious
backgrounds served as cultural capital meant that members of
IWJ-GKC asked about my family often. They were curious
about my experience growing up in Flint and consequently,
my parents' experiences working in Flint. As I listened to
members' stories in the field and recorded their narratives in
the interview context, though my parents were states away,
they were virtually present with me through these intersubjec-
tive experiences in the field. Jackson (1998) argues, "The life
stories that individuals bring to a relationship are metamor-
phosed in the course of that relationship. They are thus in a
very real sense, authored not by autonomous subjects but by
the dynamics of intersubjectivity . . . " (p. 23).
I did not spend a lot of time thinking deeply about Flint's
economic circumstances while growing up, but even a young
person tunes into the discourses of strikes, layoffs, forced
retirements, and those late-night talks of how the parents
were going to make the next mortgage payment. When I was
in elementary school, one of our class field trips was to the
GM Truck and Bus plant where my dad worked. Looking
back I ask why a "career-day" field trip took us to that fac-
tory instead of one of the two major hospitals in town. Later,
I read in Rivethead (Hamper, 1991)--a novel/autobiography
by former GM employee Ben Hamper about working at a
Chevy plant--that executives at GM saw these field trips for
the kids of workers as an act of goodwill toward the
community.
Still, somewhat startled by the roar of machinery when we
walked through those doors, I was proud to see my dad wait-
ing to give me a hug and hand me a pair of earplugs. Before
going there, I figured it just made sense my dad would wear
earplugs to work. He was a quiet man. I assumed that he did
not feel like listening to or talking to his co-workers. I did not
know until then his everyday world--from 4 a.m. to 5 p.m.--
was cluttered by such peace-shattering noise. The smell of
hot oil, sweat, and grime; rough hands; and dirty fingernails
were my dad's "signature." Only there for an hour or so, we
kids walked out smelling like our parents and happy to
breathe the fresh air. Looking back now, I can recall how I
knew my dad differently then. Even as a child, something
changes when you realize your dad goes to "the hole" every-
day just to keep you alive.
In June, 2008, my dad passed away. At his funeral, my
brother--an evangelical minister--told his story about going
to the factory on a school field trip. He was similarly greeted
by my dad. One of my dad's co-workers reached over and,
jostling my brother's shoulder a bit, asked, "Are you gonna
work here too just like your dad?" Before John could speak
up, my dad said, "No. He's going to college." At the funeral,
John also read a note from my dad that was written on the
day my brother left home to be married. In the letter, my dad
apologized for never being a talkative or intellectual man:
"Your mother is much better with things like that," he wrote.
Though I remember my childhood as being infused with
my dad's love and his presence, he said that he wished he
could have been around more, but that working in the factory
overtime meant we would not have to do the same thing
when we grew up. Though quiet and perhaps not an intel-
lectual, he worked his whole adult life in a place he never
wanted his kids to have to set foot inside. But we did see the
inside, thanks to the outreach programs of GM. Today I am
thankful for that memory as I was on the morning I last
hugged him and told him I would be back to see him in
August. He said, "Ok babe. I love you" and I heard from my
sister the following morning at 4 a.m. that he had passed
away.
Discussion
Thinking seriously about the intersubjective nature of ethno-
graphic work calls into question both the dualism and the
Lane 7
typologizing that has permeated not only Western philoso-
phy, but Western social science as well. Dualistic thinking
pits the objective against the subjective, glorifying the for-
mer as the primary means through which to engage science.
However, Jackson (1998) points out that the two do not in
lived reality exist in opposition; rather, they are dialectically
related. Furthermore, returning to the foundational ideal that
typologies were not meant to be rigidly applied, typologies
instead are tools for thinking, always meant to be placed
within the context and enriched by experience (Ostrow,
1990). Setting forth these challenges frees the researcher to
positively view and value areas of intersubjectivity in the
processes and relationships developed in the course of
researching human beings whose lived realities are consti-
tuted through intersubjective processes (Alcoff, 2000;
Jackson, 1998; Merleau-Ponty, 1962; Orsi, 2003; Ostrow,
1990).
First, the ethnographer's biography can serve as cultural
capital in the field. I have described one aspect of my biogra-
phy that intersected with my research participants' and
another aspect that posed a potential challenge to partici-
pants' understandings of religious types, but one which they
turned into a useable resource. My class location growing up
indicated I understood the struggles for working-class social
justice, which allowed me to become a cared-for member of
the IWJ-GKC community. This aspect of intersubjectivity
necessarily intersects with the third level of intersubjectivity
in which the life of the researcher can change. As indicated
above, my class location finally became something I did not
have to struggle against or hide. Furthermore, the research
participants saw that aspect of my biography enmeshed in
evangelicalism to be a resource asking questions about how
to frame workers' rights issues in such a way as to resonate
with the evangelical religious worldview. In this, a further
intersecting reality of intersubjectivity rises to the surface in
the process of the co-construction of lived reality. Just as the
interview context begs reflection on its meaning-making
quality (Holstein & Gubrium, 1995), researchers' biogra-
phies also trickle into the second level of intersubjectivity.
Our understandings of the workings of human social life are
deepened when this aspect is treated as an important--even
observable--part of the research process.
Finally, the intersubjective experiences in the field made
poignant my (past) evangelical identity and my (past­
present) class identity and thereby made my parents--espe-
cially my dad--virtually present for me on a day-to-day
basis through the stories I shared about him with people in
the field. Jackson (1998) points out that when people tell sto-
ries at funerals about those passed, those stories are often
told not to "preserve an exact record," but to "remaster expe-
rience" (p. 24). The effect on meaning is such that human
beings also experience--intersubjectively--the stories they
construct. He asserts that it matters little whether the stories
are exact records of life experiences because, "It is, there-
fore, not what they apparently do that wholly defines their
humanity--or would suffice as a scientific description of
their nature--but what they virtually experience in the course
of their actual lives" (p. 25). The stories I told in the field
somehow prepared me for my dad's death. Not in such a way
that they eased my distress; rather, in that by cultivating his
virtual presence through the intersubjective experience of
telling stories about him in the field, his virtual presence can
still remain as a comfort to me. Jackson (1998) strikingly
argues, "That we exist solely in relation to others is dramati-
cally borne out by studies of human responses to loss" (p.
75); when a significant other passes away, we "in reality
[experience] a rupture in intersubjective life" (p. 76).
Conclusion
In this article, I have argued that to more fully understand
lived experience and therefore lived religion and lived class,
ethnographers must challenge dualistic thinking and explore
the possible limitations of the rigid applications of typolo-
gies. Doing so means that one engages with processual think-
ing and is invited to consider how the researcher, the
researched, and the research process are engaged intersub-
jectively, enlivening not only the ethnography, but poten-
tially the ethnographer as well.
This processual thinking led to the discovery of three lev-
els of intersubjectivity (Orsi, 2003) interwoven into my
fieldwork experience with an interfaith and labor coalition in
Kansas City, Missouri. First, the biographies of researchers
have the potential to serve as cultural capital in ethnographic
fieldwork. Second, sometimes the stories we tell in the field
come to be incorporated into the everyday narratives of our
research participants. Third, the subjective life of the
researcher can be changed in unexpected ways through the
intersubjective nature of the lived experience of doing field-
work. Rather than viewing these intersubjective processes as
research "contaminants," they were discussed as aspects of a
co-constructed, lived reality: The recognition of which places
a more human face on our ethnographies and brings under-
standings gleaned from research closer to the lived experi-
ences discovered in the field.

Notes
1. I use "objective"--emphasizing the quotation marks--to indi-
cate that objective categories are intersubjectively constituted.
Ostrow (1990) suggests this intersubjective constitution means
that we can "escape from the division between `subjective'and
8 SAGE Open
`objective'orders of existence that has dominated Western phi-
losophy" (p. 3). Similarly, Jackson (1998) emphasizes that the
two are always dialectically related.
2. The notion of embodied experiences as central to intersub-
jectivity comes from the work of Merleau-Ponty (1962), who
unlike Husserl (e.g., Crossley, 1996) and Schutz (e.g., Ostrow,
1990) did not separate reason/mind (consciousness) from
body/subject (perception); consciousness and perception form
a "gestalt structure," which means "that all meanings and ideas
must be embodied (e.g. in words, gestures, artefacts, rituals,
etc.)" (Crossley, 1996, p. 29).
