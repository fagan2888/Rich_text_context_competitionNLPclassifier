Objectives. With a focus on the use of longitudinal data, this study reviews trends in the quantitative analysis of social
science data on aging during the past half century.
Methods. A content analysis was performed on 227 articles from 12 volumes that were systematically sampled from
the Journal of Gerontology: Social Sciences to examine change in the type of data and quantitative methods used (1946­
2000).
Results. Cross-sectional analysis remains the single most frequent type of study, but the publication of analyses based
on longitudinal panel data increased appreciably over the five decades studied. There was little increase in the use of
repeated cross-sectional analysis.
Discussion. Despite the widespread use of cross-sectional analysis, interest in data with more than one occasion of
measurement has grown among social scientists who are reviewing for and publishing in the Journal. Given the
longitudinal data now available, social science research on aging should give more explicit attention to three issues:
attrition, change in repeated measures of independent variables, and models to account for many waves of data.
MOST scientific fields of inquiry make use of some form
of data that capture processes over time. Chemists
measure the lifetimes of compounds. Physicians take repeated
measurements of physiologic data. Economists track financial
trends over time. Whether on the scale of nanoseconds or
centuries, repeated measurements over a span of time enable
researchers to describe and, it is hoped, understand the pro-
cesses and mechanisms of change. Within social gerontology,
it is considered axiomatic to prefer repeated measurements of
outcome variables. Indeed, it has been argued that the analysis
of longitudinal data is ``one of the most productive approaches
to the study of aging and human development'' (Alwin &
Campbell, 2001, p. 22).
The purpose of this paper is to systematically examine the
use of longitudinal data in social gerontology during the past
five decades. A brief review of the key factors likely to increase
the use of longitudinal analysis is presented, and a content
analysis of the Journal of Gerontology: Social Sciences is used
to document change in methods used.
Increase in Longitudinal Analyses in Social
Gerontology?
Research using cross-sectional data has made--and will
continue to make--a number of contributions to the field of
social gerontology. For example, cross-sectional studies have
generated important findings by examining unique or rare
populations ranging from older mothers of chronically disabled
children (Pruchno, Patrick, & Burant, 1996) to elders in rural
all-Black towns (McAuley, 1998). Moreover, cross-sectional
data that allow for comparisons across cultures or nations
provide social scientists an opportunity to understand the
universality of a relationship or phenomenon (Su & Ferraro,
1997; Venkatraman, 1995). In these cases, and many others, the
analysis of cross-sectional data has provided invaluable
contributions to the literature.
The challenge emerges, however, when research questions
focus on the process of aging or changes over the life course
(e.g., adaptation to life events). It has long been recognized
that a common fallacy in gerontological research is that age
differences are synonymous with age changes. Researchers
using data collected at only one point in time are faced with the
burden of separating the unique effects of age, period, and
cohort (Glenn, 1977). Aging is a process; thus, research on
aging or age-related changes must confront temporal issues
related to biography, history, and cohort flow (Riley, 1987). As
Campbell and Alwin (1996, p. 33) explained, ``even the most
simple (and, we would argue, flawed) cross-sectional com-
parison of age groups implies a developmental, or aging,
perspective.'' As a result of the skepticism about interpretations
of ``age effects'' in cross-sectional analyses, longitudinal data
are often regarded as more useful for aging research.
The value of longitudinal data has been advanced repeatedly in
the discussion section of articles using cross-sectional data and in
chapters on research design in gerontology handbooks (e.g.,
Alwin & Campbell, 2001) and textbooks (e.g., Morgan &
Kunkel, 2001). Longitudinal data are not the panacea for
gerontology, but most scholars conclude that they offer greater
potential for advancing the science of aging. Unlike with cross-
sectional data, there is the potential to distinguish age differences
from age changes with data from multiple points in time.
Beyond exhortations to use data collected at multiple points
in time, the convergence of several forces in recent decades
has made longitudinal data analysis more feasible. First, the
paradigm for social science research on aging has shifted
somewhat in recent decades from one focused on the study
of older people to the process of aging. Interest in age

stratification (Riley, Johnson, & Foner, 1972), dialectical
operations in adulthood (Riegel, 1973), the life course (Elder,
1974), and life-span development (Baltes, Reese, & Lipsitt,
1980) spurred greater interest in aging as a lifelong process.
Moreover, empirical studies that tracked people over decades
offered unique insight into the life course (Giele & Elder,
1998). For example, the Terman Study of Gifted Children,
the Berkeley Guidance Study, and the Oakland and Berkeley
Growth Studies followed children born in the 1920s for
decades. These and other long-term studies helped shift social
gerontology away from cohort-centric studies of older people
to more life course analysis and comparisons of age groups.
Evidence of this paradigmatic shift may also be noted in the
name change for the American Sociological Association's
section dedicated to the study of aging. It was long known as
Sociology of Aging, but in 1997 it was changed to Sociology of
Aging and the Life Course (the second time it was proposed).
Second, federal funding of prospective longitudinal studies,
especially by the U.S. Department of Labor and National
Institute on Aging, resulted in a greater supply of data for
studying the aging process. The National Longitudinal Surveys
and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics were launched in the
1960s to monitor work and economic behavior over the life
course (Giele & Elder, 1998). Although the National Institute
on Aging supported several major longitudinal studies in
the 1980s, most were focused on tracking older adults over
time (e.g., Longitudinal Study on Aging, National Long-Term
Care Survey, and Established Populations for the Epidemio-
logic Study of the Elderly); exceptions included Americans'
Changing Lives and the National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey I: Epidemiologic Followup Study. In the 1990s,
the Health and Retirement Study reflected this interest in the
long-term study of the aging process, albeit with the transition
to retirement serving as the fulcrum of sample selection.
Despite differences in the ages of adults studied, the message
is clear: longitudinal data and analyses are key to advancing
the field.
Third, public data archives made the supply of longitudinal
data more available to potential investigators. The development
of the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social
Research (ICPSR), established in 1962, meant that both
longitudinal panel data and repeated cross-sectional data were
available to a wide array of scientists (Rockwell & Abeles,
1998). The National Archive of Computerized Data on Aging,
a division of ICPSR, enhanced scores of data sets by providing
syntax to conveniently define files and made the data available
to researchers at institutions that were not members of ICPSR.
Fourth, the revolution in statistical computing in recent
decades helped spawn a new generation of analytic resources
for longitudinal data. The 1960s witnessed the publication of
Schaie's (1965) sequential design methodology, spurring dis-
cussions of ways to handle the age­period­cohort confound
(Glenn, 1977; Mason, Winsborough, Mason, & Poole, 1973).
The discussion engaged methodologists interested in change,
as evidenced in key publications in the 1970s regarding lon-
gitudinal methods. Besides cohort analytic methods (Glenn,
1977), this decade included the publication of seminal works
on event history methods (Cox, 1972) and the use of structural
equation modeling for longitudinal data (Jo
¨reskog & So
¨rbom,
1977). The application of these methods proliferated in the
1980s, aided by less technical works that helped clarify their
power and utility (e.g., Allison, 1984; Campbell & Mutran,
1982). Seminal works on multiple imputation for missing data
(Dempster, Laird, & Rubin, 1977) and selection bias model-
ing (Heckman, 1979) were published in the 1970s, but the
application of these methods to adjust for attrition in panel
studies is much more recent. Both growth curve modeling and
hierarchical linear models were introduced in the social
sciences in the 1980s (Bryk & Raudenbush, 1987; McArdle &
Epstein, 1987). Recent applications of these methods in social
gerontology are encouraging, but it may be too early to gauge
their long-term impact.
With powerful techniques of analysis, readily available
longitudinal data, and a growing interest in aging across the life
course, one may anticipate a major shift in social gerontology
toward longitudinal analyses. The purpose of the present re-
search is to systematically examine such an assertion. To begin,
we ask, how common has longitudinal analysis become? Are
a majority of published studies now longitudinal? It seems
reasonable to anticipate the growing use of longitudinal data in
the 1980s and 1990s, but limited use of methods to handle
attrition until very recently. In addition, whether an increase
occurs for the analysis of both panel and repeated cross-
sectional data is more difficult to predict. The analysis of
repeated cross-sections avoids the attrition problem, but have
social scientists increased their use of this type of data?
METHODS
Content analysis was performed on articles from a systematic
sample of volumes from the Journal of Gerontology: Social
Sciences to examine change in the use of longitudinal data from
1946 to 2000. The Journal of Gerontology: Social Sciences,
hereafter referred to as the Journal, was selected because it is
widely regarded as the premiere publication for original re-
search in social gerontology. The Journal of Gerontology, from
which the Journal was spawned, is the oldest journal dedicated
to the scientific study of aging. The Journal has played a
pivotal role in shaping the field, both from the submissions it
attracts and the expectations of its reviewers. Thus, one may
anticipate that methodological advances, especially innovations
in longitudinal analysis, would be more likely to appear in the
Journal and then diffuse to other journals. In addition, there
have been many calls for longitudinal analyses over the years
in articles, editorials, and selected essays in the Journal.
In a series of essays marking the 50th anniversary of the
Journal, key gerontologists remarked on the progress of the
first half-century of research on aging and the future directions
for the field. Related to the present investigation, Schulz (1995)
heralded the growth in the number of longitudinal data sets as
a positive step in the study of aging. Cutler (1995, p. S64)
further argued that ``many of the fundamental issues with which
we are most concerned involve social, social-psychological,
and other dimensions of change associated with aging. For
these topics, there is no substitute for studies that follow the
same individuals over time or for data sets that can be arrayed
so as to follow cohorts.'' In addition, Kasl (1995) noted that the
vast improvements in technology and statistical analysis have
facilitated the sophisticated use of longitudinal data in social
gerontology. Although these authors agreed that research using
longitudinal data can be beneficial to advancing the field of
LONGITUDINAL METHODS IN SOCIAL GERONTOLOGY S265
aging and that it is reasonable to expect greater use of data from
multiple points in time, we are unaware of any systematic study
of this Journal (or any other) to document change in the use of
such data. Our aim is to use the flagship journal of social
gerontology to examine how quantitative methods of analyses
have changed since 1946, thereby tracking the use of longi-
tudinal methods over the past 55 years.
There were 55 volumes of the Journal of Gerontology
published between 1946 and 2000. In addition to the inaugural
one, volumes from every fifth year were systematically sampled
for this research (i.e., 1946, 1950, 1955, . . . , 1995, 2000), re-
sulting in nearly 22% of all volumes published. Content analysis
was performed on articles from the 12 volumes to examine
change in the use of longitudinal data from 1946 to 2000. A
total of 227 social science articles were selected for this analysis
(all social science articles in each volume were examined).
Systematic sampling of journal articles is common when
a content analysis of documents collected over a long period of
time is conducted. For example, Jones, LaVeist, and Lillie-
Blanton (1991) used a 10-year interval to study a 70-year
period. A 5-year interval was selected for the present research
to better detect change over the 55-year period. An analysis of
the population of articles would, of course, have merit, but the
5-year interval is a reasonable approach to capture change.
Moreover, methodological innovations take time to permeate
the research community, so sampling every fifth year should
be sufficient to capture the ``standard setting'' function of the
Journal with regard to longitudinal methods.
Numerous changes in the organization of the Journal
have transpired--including a name change in 1988--but this
research examines only those articles classified as social
science. Although the Journal has had some type of sectional
organization since 1972, this also has changed repeatedly. The
social sciences section title emerged in 1985; thus, all articles in
this section since 1985 were considered for the given years.
Prior to that time, all social science articles were selected after
they were read by K. Ferraro. Articles classified as psycholog-
ical sciences were excluded from the analysis because the focus
here is on nonexperimental approaches to longitudinal analysis.
Many psychological experiments involve longitudinal data
(pretests and posttests), but the diffusion of longitudinal
methods is likely quite different for experimental and non-
experimental approaches. Assuredly, there are nonexperimental
psychological approaches in the Journal of Gerontology:
Psychological Sciences, but the scope of the project is clearer
by focusing on social science research (i.e., articles prior to
1985 on psychological topics such cognition, perception, and
dementia were excluded, but works examining social psy-
chological topics such as social support or exchange were
included). The classification of social science articles was based
on topic, method, and, if necessary, author affiliation.
Of the 227 total articles, 15 (6.6%) were excluded from
subsequent analysis because they were classified as theoretical
or qualitative. For each of the remaining 212 quantitative
articles, the type of analysis was coded into one of three
categories: first, cross-sectional (includes studies that pool
data across time and ignore year-to-year variation); second,
longitudinal panel; and third, repeated cross-sectional (RC-S)
or cohort analysis (Glenn, 1977). A few articles used both
cross-sectional and cohort analyses on more than one data set,
and these were classified as RC-S. The analytic procedures used
were coded regardless of the data structure. It is important to
recognize that there are longitudinal data and longitudinal
methods. This distinction can be clearly discerned by a few
studies that reported cross-sectional analysis on longitudinal
panel data. In an attempt to keep the distinction clear, we use
the term analysis rather than design to differentiate between
those that used multiple waves and those that used a single
wave of longitudinal data.
Each article was read by at least two raters. Each rater
was trained on the coding procedures and given one volume
to analyze. Before proceeding to additional volumes, raters
discussed responses to the first volume with the senior author in
order to clarify coding procedures. Even after the training
period, raters were encouraged to bring difficult cases to the
senior author for resolution. Kappa values for interrater reli-
ability, calculated after case resolution, exceeded .83 for each
volume (Landis & Koch, 1977). Some additional charac-
teristics of the articles were coded and are described later in
more detail.
RESULTS
As noted earlier, the Journal experienced many changes over
the 55 years, including the number of articles published per
volume. To launch our analysis of change in methods, it should
be noted first that the number of social science articles in-
creased appreciably over time. For each volume through 1965,
fewer than 10 social science articles were published. Beginning
in 1990, more than 30 social science articles were published
in each volume examined.
Not surprisingly, there was a clear increase in the proportion
of articles using data collected at multiple points in time, but
some caution is necessary when differences in the earliest
volumes are examined because of the infrequency of social
science articles during the first 20 years. Figure 1 shows the
distribution of studies by type of analysis over the 55 years of
publication. There were some sharp fluctuations over time in
the use of longitudinal panel data, but the overall trend was for
an increase of such articles; the proportion increased as well.
In contrast, repeated cross-sectional analysis did not increase
appreciably over time. The number of data sets available for
repeated cross-sectional analysis grew substantially, but there is
no increase in this type of analysis during the past four decades.
Approximately 62% of all articles examined were cross-
sectional analyses only. Whereas at least 60% of all articles in
each volume of the Journal before 1975 were cross-sectional,
this was not the case in most of the volumes examined since
then (beginning in 1975, four volumes had less than 60% cross-
sectional analyses). Indeed, in 1990, the percentage declined
to less than 50. Articles using some type of longitudinal data
have held steady at approximately 40­45% in the past decade.
Although articles using data collected at multiple time points
became more common, cross-sectional analyses remained the
single most common type of article published.
Several additional variables were coded for each study,
including the number of waves of data collection and type of
sample. Not only did longitudinal data become more widely
used over time, but the number of waves of data collection also
increased over time (the correlation between number of waves
and date published was .283). A 6-wave study appeared in 1955,
FERRARO AND KELLEY-MOORE
S266
but it was another 25 years before another study was published
with 6 or more waves. The number of waves increased sharply
in the longitudinal articles appearing in the Journal by the
mid-1990s. Studies ranged from 1 to 11 waves in 1995 and 2000.
In addition to more observation points, the geographic
variability increased in studies over time. With their growing
accessibility through data archives, national samples surpassed
all other types of samples in 1995. When national samples are
combined with multiple-state samples, single-location samples
have been the minority since 1980. Social scientists prize
external validity, and the availability of nationally represen-
tative samples has attracted considerable use. As might be
expected, the type of analysis varied by type of sample.
National samples were reported for approximately 83% of the
cohort analyses, 35% of the cross-sectional analyses, and
24% of the longitudinal panel analyses. Nearly half of the
longitudinal panel studies were based on local samples. (A
logistic regression analysis for the use of national data revealed
significant independent effects for three variables: National data
were more likely to be used in more recent studies and in cohort
and cross-sectional studies than for longitudinal panel studies.)
One of the basic issues facing scientists analyzing longitudinal
panel data, especially over longer time periods, is attrition (i.e.,
nonresponse, loss to follow-up, and mortality). Although many
of the longitudinal panel studies examined attrition patterns and
tempered their conclusions in light of them, only 9 of the 63
longitudinal panel studies made some type of formal adjustment
for attrition. This may seem less than exemplary, but all 9 of
those studies were published in 1995 or 2000. Thus, there is
evidence of a substantial shift toward the use of such procedures
by scholars using longitudinal panel data.
To examine the validity of this premise more closely, we
reviewed all articles for the 1995­2000 period. Given that the
first occurrence of an adjustment for attrition was in 1995,
a finer grained analysis may help to identify if this truly signals
a change since the methods first appeared in the sampled
years. Thus, beyond the 227 articles systematically sampled
from 1946 to 2000, all 132 articles were examined in the period
1996­1999, yielding a 6-year population of articles.
The review of those articles reveals that adjusting parameter
estimates to account for attrition has, indeed, become more
common. For each year between 1995 and 2000, at least 20%
of the articles using repeated measures undertook some type of
adjustment for attrition. Interestingly, a wide variety of methods
were used to adjust parameter estimates for attrition, ranging
from weighting to multiple imputation. Of the remaining
articles, about half mentioned attrition or performed supple-
mentary analyses to show how selection bias may have
influenced the findings. In short, the majority of articles pub-
lished in recent years address attrition in one way or another--
a sign that longitudinal analysis alone is not sufficient. The
emerging standard in social gerontology expects authors and
reviewers to be aware of the potential problems caused by
nonrandom attrition and to temper conclusions in light of
selection bias.
DISCUSSION
Longitudinal data are often heralded for improving the
science of aging, and there has been a growing use of longi-
tudinal data in recent decades as uncovered in a content analysis
of the Journal. Cross-sectional analysis was the most frequently
used approach in 15 out of the 16 volumes of the Journal
examined, but the trend toward an increase in the use of
longitudinal data is manifest in recent years. Although one
volume--1996--had more longitudinal than cross-sectional
analyses, the pattern of at least 40­45% of the articles reporting
some type of longitudinal analysis has been fairly steady for
the past decade. Accompanying the growth in the use of
longitudinal data, both the number of measurement points and
the length of observation increased. We have witnessed reports
of findings from more long-term panel studies of aging, and we
believe that these studies provide unique scientific contributions.
A closer look at the growing prevalence of longitudinal
analysis reveals that it was primarily due to the analysis of
panel data. By contrast, repeated cross-sectional analyses did
not increase appreciably over time. There has been a steady
stream of cohort analyses published in the Journal, but given
the supply and availability of repeated cross sections, cohort
analyses hold untapped potential for advancing our under-
standing of aging, social change, and cohort flow (Campbell,
1994). Examples of studies published in the Journal that have
clarified the role of these forces include findings on growth in
noncitizen Supplemental Security Income caseloads (Van Hook
& Bean, 1999), interstate migration of elders (Golant, 1990),
retirement preparation (Ferraro, 1990), disability (Schoeni,
Freedman, & Wallace, 2001), and verbal ability (Alwin &
McCammon, 2001). Most social scientists are familiar with
census data and the General Social Survey being used as re-
peated cross sections, but many other surveys merit attention.
Examples include the Health Interview Survey, the National
Home and Hospice Surveys, the National Hospital Discharge
Survey, the National Medical Expenditure Survey, and the
Survey of Consumer Finances.
It needs to be recognized that an analysis of repeated cross
sections permits assessment of change. It is not change within
an individual's life, as is customarily seen in panel studies, but
change within a set of people defined by date of birth or some
other event. It should also be recalled that aging represents
a link between history and biography (Riley, 1987). Much can
be gleaned from the analysis of repeated cross sections to
identify how the changes observed in cohorts may be dependent

Sciences (1946­2000).

on social or historical circumstances. Another advantage of
repeated cross-sectional analysis is that sample attrition is not
a concern.
Although the use of cohort analysis remained relatively
constant over the five decades, longitudinal panel analysis
became more popular among social scientists during this time.
One reason for its attraction is that, unlike a cohort analysis,
a longitudinal panel analysis permits assessment of intra-
individual change. As a result, it is widely viewed as helpful for
examining mediating effects and the causal processes associ-
ated with aging.
Unlike the analysis of repeated cross sections, longitudinal
panel designs face the possibility of attrition and nonrandom
selection effects (Diggle & Kenward, 1994; Elias & Robbins,
1991; Little, 1995; McArdle & Hamagami, 1992). Panel studies
of older adults are particularly sensitive to the effects of
selective mortality, institutionalization, and cognitive decline.
Failing to account for nonrandom attrition and other mecha-
nisms of selection may produce estimates on a relatively
privileged sample in terms of health, socioeconomic status, or
cognitive ability.
A content analysis of the Journal revealed that the first
explicit application of methods to adjust for attrition occurred in
the past decade. Concerns about the role of attrition on findings
from panel studies were articulated decades ago (e.g., Riegel,
Riegel, & Meyer, 1967), but the development of methods
for systematically handling attrition has been fairly recent.
However, there is evidence on the pages of the Journal that
social gerontologists are aware of the problem of nonrandom
selection bias and are taking steps to account for it in panel
studies. Because of the high likelihood of nonrandom attrition
in samples with older adults, social gerontologists are not only
beginning to apply these methods but are also helping to
develop them.
Awareness of the problem has grown with demonstrations of
differences in parameter estimates with and without adjusting
for nonrandom attrition (Lillard & Panis, 1998). A variety
of techniques are available to account for attrition such as
Heckman two-stage estimators (Heckman, 1979; Stolzenberg &
Relles, 1997), multiple imputation (Little & Schenker, 1995;
Schafer, 2001), full-information maximum likelihood methods
(Arbuckle, 1996), and multigroup estimation with structural
equation models (Allison, 1987; Bollen, 1989; McArdle, 1994;
McArdle, Hamagami, Elias, & Robbins, 1991). The greater use
of longitudinal panel data is one sign of the maturation of social
gerontology as a field of inquiry, but increased attention to pos-
sible bias introduced by attrition in panel studies is another one
that should logically follow. Nonrandom attrition may not be
consequential to parameter estimates, but scientists studying
the aging process should study attrition in panel studies and test
whether nonrandom attrition matters.
The content analysis of the Journal suggests other important
features of change in the conduct of longitudinal analyses.
Perhaps what is most important is that, as longitudinal analyses
increased, so did the number of waves of data collection. There
are two major implications of this trend. First, three or more
waves of data permit the use of a whole other set of analytic
procedures than are commonly used with two-wave panel
studies. Time series methods such as autoregression (Dufour &
Torres, 2000) and Markov state analysis (Allison, 1996) are
powerful estimation procedures for assessing serial change over
time. Latent growth curves are another class of models to assess
change over multiple waves, but they measure both intra-
individual and the interindividual trajectories over time (Willett
& Sayer, 1994). There are two major approaches for estimating
growth curves: hierarchical linear models (Bryk & Rauden-
bush, 1987) and structural equation models (Curran & Bollen,
2001). Each approach, and the software for using it, has its
advantages and disadvantages. (For example, unequal interval
lengths across three or more waves of data are conveniently
handled in hierarchical linear models, but structural equa-
tion models are better for dealing with measurement error.)
Nevertheless, both make efficient use of information and can
account for attrition. Studies using growth curve or Markov
models have provided fresh insights into the dynamics of health
or social relationships in adulthood and helped to crystallize the
value of the life course perspective.
With an increasing number of waves of data, there are also
new opportunities to incorporate information from repeated
measures of the independent variable(s). If possible, it is useful
to update the information on the respondent to that which
is most proximate to the outcome of interest as well as take
advantage of the observed change in the independent variables.
With three or more waves of data, it is possible to lag the
change in presumed independent variables so as to be sensitive
to temporal ordering and causal mechanisms.
A growing number of studies permit incorporation of con-
tinuous time variables such as a daily indication of whether a
heart transplant occurred, date of institutionalization, or hourly
measurements of blood pressure. Statistical models have been
developed that conveniently incorporate covariates that can
change over time, deepening our understanding of the in-
fluence of these factors as we age. Other studies have repeated
measures at discrete time points such as depression, self-rated
health, and employment status updated at each wave of data
collection. For example, models that use only baseline data to
predict subsequent outcomes implicitly assume that individuals
do not change over time. Not all samples have repeated mea-
sures, either continuous or discrete, for such modeling. How-
ever, for those that do, inclusion of these types of variables
allows researchers to calculate how risk varies over time based
on the changing covariates (Allison, 1995; Fisher & Lin, 1999).
The application of these types of models is growing in social
gerontology (Ferraro & Kelley-Moore, 2001; Hayward,
Friedman, & Chen, 1998).
Finally, as longitudinal analyses become both more common
and complex, it is important to remember that longitudinal data
have to be thought of in terms of the research question. Cross-
sectional data may be not only sufficient but also more ap-
propriate for some research questions. Even if longitudinal
data are preferred, the length of time between waves is a critical
criterion when the utility of the data is judged. Subtle changes
can be captured when observations are repeated every week,
month, or even year. Studies with longer intervals--5 or 10
years--provide a different lens for assessing change. The effect
size of relationships may vary over time, so it is important that
observation windows are appropriate for the research question
(Gollob & Reichardt, 1987).
Some samples, such as the Established Populations for
the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (EPESE), have seven
FERRARO AND KELLEY-MOORE
S268
annual observation points taken in consecutive years (Cornoni-
Huntley et al., 1993). This provides an in-depth examination of
a relatively short time period for older adults. In contrast, the
Stanford­Terman study was initiated in 1922 and subjects were
followed to 1986--a total of 12 waves of data, with interval
length ranging from 5 to 10 years (Elder & Pavalko, 1993).
Gerontology has gained much from studies of varying interval
length; we need both lenses to advance the field.
The present study systematically examined change in
longitudinal analyses in the Journal. The findings show growth
in longitudinal panel analysis, stable but meager use of repeated
cross sections for studying cohort change, and recent imple-
mentation of methods to account for attrition. Although these
findings help us to understand change in the Journal, one
limitation of the present study is that conclusions about this one
journal may not accurately portray changes in social gerontol-
ogy more generally. The Journal is regarded as the flagship for
social gerontology, but other journals dedicated to the study of
aging have proliferated in the past three decades, and important
innovations in longitudinal methods may have appeared in
those journals. Moreover, the flagship journals of the home
disciplines (e.g., economics and sociology) may be where many
of the innovations are introduced prior to application here.
Although limited to one serial, this review of quantitative
research in the Journal shows important changes in social
gerontology. Social scientists should continue to value cross-
sectional research that contributes to our understanding of age
differences. At the same time, the growing use of longitudinal
data has the potential to reshape our understanding of the
aging process. Findings from longitudinal data published in
the Journal have challenged and helped redefine what we
know about many topics in gerontology. Given recent trends in
the supply and availability of longitudinal data and statistical
resources to analyze them, we anticipate more longitudinal
analyses in the field. At the same time, there are important
challenges in analyzing longitudinal data, especially as the
number of waves and periods of observation increase. These
challenges are to be welcomed as a sign of success for the field
and a call to make the best use of available data. With the
challenges for analyzing longitudinal data comes the potential
to better understand the mechanisms and processes of aging.
