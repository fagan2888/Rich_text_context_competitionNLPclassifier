Introduction
Family is the basic unit in every society and currently mar-
riage as the foundation of this important unit has faced a lot
of challenges in modern societies (Olson & Olson, 1999).
Marital satisfaction, marital quality, and dyadic adjust-
ment are terms that have been used to express quality of rela-
tionship in married couples (Askari, Noah, Hassan, & Baba,
2012; Harper, Schaalje, & Sandberg, 2000).
Intimacy is one of the marital process variables that can
be affected when the couples' relationship is dissatisfactory.
It has been shown that intimacy is strongly connected to
quality of life in married couples (Harper & Elliott, 1988;
Harper et al., 2000; Tolstedt & Stokes, 1983; Waring, 1988).
Based on a definition proposed by Waring (1988), intimacy
is a "multifaceted interpersonal dimension which describes
the quality of marriage relationship at a point in time"
(Harper et al., 2000, p23). There are other definitions for inti-
macy which involve the notions of conflict resolution and
sharing hurt feeling (Harper et al., 2000; Holley & L'Abate,
1979). Schaefer and Olson (1981) have defined intimacy in
the context of sharing intimate experiences, which include
five factors: emotional, social, sexual, intellectual, and recre-
ational (Harper et al., 2000). Harper and Schaalje have
proved that intimacy is a mediator of daily stress effects on
couples' relationships (Harper et al., 2000).
Communication skills training has been extensively stud-
ied in the context of couples' relationships and interactions
(Bellack & Hersen, 1979). Lack of proper communication
skills has been shown to be a major issue leading to dissat-
isfaction in couples' lives (Bellack & Hersen, 1979; Boland
& Follingstad, 1987; Burleson & Denton, 1997; Mitchell,
Bullard, & Mudd, 1962). Communication skills have been
among top three significant problems reported in distressed
marriages along with difficulties in sexual expression and
personality factors (Bellack & Hersen, 1979; Birchler,
1977). Therefore, communication skills training seems to be
an essential part of treatment programs for couples com-
plaining of dissatisfaction in their relationships (Jacobson &
Margolin, 1979).
Efficient communication is considered in forms of
Speaker Skills in which the term "I" is used to address a spe-
cific message and Listener Skills in which a person listens to
his or her partner in an active dynamic form and try to make

Investigating the Effect of Communication
Skills Training for Married Women on
Couples' Intimacy and Quality of Life
Elnaz Farbod1, Mohammad Ghamari2 and Mojtaba Amiri Majd2
Abstract
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of communication skills education for married women on couples'
intimacy and quality of life. The subjects of this study were married female students enrolled in the spring semester of 2011
at the Applied Sciences and Technology University (Tourism Unit) of Kerman in Iran, along with their husbands. Of the
students who expressed interest in taking part in this study, 30 subjects were selected and randomly assigned to either an
experimental or a control group. Subjects in the experimental group participated in a 12-session training for the improvement
of communication skills in the context of marriage and family therapy. Comparison of these two groups indicated that
communication skills training for married women can increase their intimacy and quality of life in their relationships with
their husbands (p < .01). This study further revealed that this sort of training programs could also increase the quality of life
of the husbands in their relationships with their wives (p < .01).

the communication more clear through positive feedbacks
(Hahlweg, Revenstorf, & Schindler, 1984).
Blanchard et al. (2009) have mentioned the correlation
between Marriage and Relationship Education (MRE) and
couples' communication skills. Based on their meta-analysis
study, they have suggested the invention of better methodol-
ogies to evaluate the role of MRE in improvement of com-
munication skills. Schilling et al. (2003) conducted a
longitudinal study to investigate the effects of Prevention
and Relationship Enhancement Program (PREP) on develop-
ment of distress in marital relationships. They found that
PREP can significantly increase the positive communication
skills in men and women. An interesting finding in this study
was the effect of increased positive communication skills in
women which could lead to increased risk of male and female
distress onset whereas increased positive communication
skills in men predicted decreased risk of marital distress
(Schilling et al., 2003).
Behavioral marital therapy (BMT) has been shown to be
able to help couples improve their communication skills
(Hahlweg et al., 1984). They have mentioned that lack of com-
munication skills is one of the main complaints in couples
seeking BMT and they have shown that BMT has a positive
effect in increasing communication skills in couples. Boland
and Follingstad (1987) have comprehensively reviewed all the
literature related to relationship between communication skills
and marital satisfaction, which has been addressed as a domi-
nant and important correlation. The same sort of integrative
review has been done by Burleson and Denton (1997).
Iranian couples live in a transitional society moving from
being traditional to modern. In such a complex transitional
state, couples'relationships, their quality of life and intimacy
are affected. Problems related to communication skills in
Iranian couples have been addressed in the literature but lim-
ited knowledge is available toward communication skills in
relation with quality of life and intimacy of couples and also
interventional methods to overcome these problems (Askari
et al., 2012; Kalantarkousheh & Hassan, 2010; Rakhshani,
Niknami, & Moghaddam, 2005).
Method
The research design in this study was pre-test and post-test
research design with experimental and control groups.
Subjects were 30 married female students enrolled in the
spring semester of 2011 in Applied Sciences and Technology
University (Tourism Unit) of Kerman in Iran and their hus-
bands. They were randomly assigned to an experimental
group (15 subjects) and a control group (15 subjects). We
used pre-test and post-test to determine the effects of com-
munication skills training on intimacy and quality of life of
the women and their husbands.
Bagarozzi Intimacy Needs Survey Questionnaire
(Bagarozzi, 2001) includes 41 questions and is a useful tool
to measure total intimacy as a score. It uses eight factors for
scoring intimacy: Emotional Intimacy, Psychological
Intimacy, Intellectual Intimacy, Sexual Intimacy, Physical
Intimacy, Spiritual Intimacy, Aesthetic Intimacy, and Social-
Recreational Intimacy (Bagarozzi, 2001).
The psychometric properties of a quality of life scale (World
Health Organization [WHO], 1996, 2004), the WHO Quality
of Life-BREF (World Health Organization Quality of Life
Assessment-Brief,WHOQOL-BREF), has 26 items which
measure physical health, psychological health, social relation-
ships, and environmental factors. The WHOQOL-BREF is a
shorter version of the original instrument, which can be used in
larger studies and clinical trials (WHO, 1996, 2004).
We used Bagarozzi Intimacy Needs Survey Questionnaire
and WHOQOL-BREF on all the married couples volun-
teered for this study among which all were female students
enrolled in the spring semester of 2011 in Applied Sciences
and Technology University (Tourism Unit) of Kerman in
Iran. A total of 30 couples with the lowest scores were
selected as subjects for this study.
Women in experimental group participated in a 12-ses-
sion training on marital communication skills. The aim of
this training was to increase positive communication skills
and diminish negative communication behaviors. The con-
trol group received no training. We used analysis of covari-
ance to test our hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1: Communication skills training for married
women increases their intimacy.
Hypothesis 2: Communication skills training for married
women increases their quality of life.
Hypothesis 3: Communication skills training for married
women increases their husbands' intimacy.
Hypothesis 4: Communication skills training for married
women increases their husbands' quality of life.
Results
After analysis of the data obtained through pre-test and pos-
test, the effect of communication skills training had signifi-
cantly (p < .01) increased women's intimacy, and Hypothesis
1 was approved. Hypothesis 2 was approved as well and
communication skills training had significantly (p < .01)
increased women's quality of life. Although communication
skills training for women had not significantly increased the
intimacy of their husbands (p > .1), it had a significant effect
on increasing the husbands' quality of life (p < .01). The
result is consistent with other studies done before (Askari
et al., 2012), showing the importance of communication
skills training program in treatment of distressed couples
seeking different sorts of therapies.
Discussion
Sprecher (2002) has indicated that communication is an
essential requirement for establishing an intimate relationship
Farbod et al. 3
and giving rise to adaptability between couples. Effectiveness
of communication skills training in fostering and maintaining
positive intimate relationship between couples has been
approved (Askari et al., 2012; Blanchard et al., 2009; Durana,
1997; Hahlweg et al., 1984; Halford, Markman, Kling, &
Stanley, 2003; Miller, Nunnally, & Wackman, 1976; Schilling
et al., 2003).
Communication skills training helps couples to send their
messages more explicitly and hence come to a deeper under-
standing of one another. Systematic training of positive com-
munication skills to couples and at the same time practice of
communication skills by couples will add positive habits into
their behavioral repertoire and these habits will be used in
conflict situation and avoid engaging in stress-induced
behaviors such as criticisms, blaming, and taunting.
Hrapczynski (2008) has shown that cognitive-behavioral
therapy can reduce negative communication patterns and
negative attitudes among couples, which will lead to
increased satisfaction.
The result of this study showed the positive effect of com-
munication skills education for married women on increas-
ing their intimacy and quality of life. Although it has been
observed that communication skills trainings have a gender-
dependent pattern on affecting couples' behaviors (Schilling
et al., 2003), our results showed that communication skills
education to women can just increase the intimacy of their
husbands and not their quality of life. Schilling et al. (2003)
had somehow a similar observation and found that increased
positive communication skills in women not only cannot
decrease the risk of male and female distress onset but also
increases it. The dynamics behind these observations need to
be studied in detail.
Nowadays in every society, family is the main source of
security for individuals. However, families encounter differ-
ent challenges and problems in modern societies. One of the
most common problems families face is diminished marital
intimacy and satisfaction, which leads to decreased quality
of life of families. Interventional programs to prevent these
problems are very helpful and communication skills training
programs for couples are good examples for interventional
measures.
Although the impact of communication skills training on
intimacy, satisfaction, and quality of life of couples has been
studied, the contents of these trainings and mechanism to be
used for inducing positive practice of communication skills
via educational and training programs need to be studied.
