VAST evidence from demographic and health surveys
has shown that poorer health and higher mortality in
children are clearly associated with lower socioeconomic
status (SES) of parents everywhere in low- and high-income
countries. In contrast, the evidence of an SES gradient in the
health of adults in developing countries is scarce and con-
flicting. Particularly puzzling is the fact that subjective gen-
eral health status measures have been found in some studies
to have much larger SES gradients than more objectively
measured health indicators. Crimmins (2005) discussed
some hypotheses that could help explain these patterns, but
there has been little analysis regarding which hypotheses
are consistent with observed data.
This article further investigates this paradox using data
from an ongoing longitudinal study of health and survival
among elderly Costa Ricans (the Costa Rican Study on
Longevity and Healthy Aging [CRELES]). CRELES has
a rich array of health indicators, including subjective
health, functional disability, mental health, frailty, and an
array of objectively measured health conditions from
blood and urine samples, as well as mortality data. In ad-
dition, CRELES collected data on various pathways
through which these SES effects might be mediated as
they influence different types of health indicators. In this
article, we both document varying SES gradients across a
wide range of well-defined health indicators and also esti-
mate SES gradients in mediating behavior variables in
order to elucidate what hypotheses may be most promis-
ing for further research.
Background
Analyses in developed countries have found SES and
adult health to be significantly positively correlated--
better health at higher SES (Seeman et al., 2008)--though
gradients appear smaller at older ages than at earlier ages
(Crimmins, 2005; Elo & Preston, 1996; Turra & Goldman,
2007). In developing countries, there has been much less
study of older adult health differentials, partly due to the
paucity of appropriate data until recent years. Now avail-
able surveys in elderly populations in Asia and Latin
America do indeed appear to also show substantially poorer
self-assessed health among the low educated (Palloni &
McEniry, 2004; Zimmer, Natividad, Ofstedal, & Lin, 2002).
However, the SES gradient in less subjective indicators is
much less consistent. In Asia, surveys such as in Taiwan
have found unclear relationships between SES and indica-
tors of functional health, and SES differentials appear to
even reverse for life-threatening measurements such as
stroke, cancer, and diabetes (Zimmer et al., 2002). In contrast,
Latin American surveys such as in Mexico find that the SES
gradient persists for chronic conditions like diabetes, al-
though with less strength than that observed in self-assessed
health indicators (Palloni & McEniry, 2004). In both Asian

Background. To determine socioeconomic status (SES) gradients in the different dimensions of health among elderly
Costa Ricans. Hypothesis: SES disparities in adult health are minimal in Costa Rican society.
Methods. Data from the Costa Rican Study on Longevity and Healthy Aging study: 8,000 elderly Costa Ricans to
determine mortality in the period 2000­2007 and a subsample of 3,000 to determine prevalence of several health condi-
tions and biomarkers from anthropometry and blood and urine specimens.
Results. The ultimate health indicator, mortality, as well as the metabolic syndrome, reveals that better educated and
wealthier individuals are worse off. In contrast, quality of life­related measures such as functional and cognitive dis-
abilities, physical frailty, and depression all clearly worsen with lower SES. Overall self-reported health (SRH) also
shows a strong positive SES gradient. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes and cholesterol are not
significantly related to SES, but hypertension and obesity are worse among high-SES individuals. Reflecting mixed SES
gradients in behaviors, smoking and lack of exercise are more common among low SES, but high calorie diets are more
common among high SES.
Conclusions. Negative modern behaviors among high-SES groups may be reversing cardiovascular risks across SES
groups, hence reversing mortality risks. But negative SES gradients in healthy years of life persist.

and LatinAmerican studies, socioeconomic differentials are
often smaller than those observed in the high-income
countries.
When studying mortality indicators, SES differentials for
older adults are again not well understood in developing
countries. A few recent studies have found that mortality by
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and diabetes tends to be
higher in the more developed areas of Costa Rica (Rosero-
Bixby, 1996); similarly, a 17-year follow-up study in Costa
Ricans showed no significant differences in survival by SES
among older people (Rosero-Bixby, Dow, & Lacle, 2005).
Another challenging result is the so called "Hispanic Para-
dox"; that is, the lower mortality of elderly Hispanics com-
pared with the much more affluent White population in the
United States (Elo, Turra, Kestenbaum, & Ferguson, 2004),
which some argue may be partly due to cultural differences
in health behaviors and psychosocial support. Hispanics also
show significantly smaller SES differentials in mortality
than Whites (Turra & Goldman, 2007). By contrast, Bangla-
desh data from a surveillance site shows the expected
pattern of higher adult mortality at lower education (Hurt,
Ronsmans, & Saha, 2004; Mostafa & Ginneken, 2000).
Various hypotheses have been suggested to explain differ-
ent dimensions of the conflicting SES patterns in adult
health. Some authors attribute to selection effects the weak-
ening of SES differentials by age: that is, mortality elimi-
nates the frailest individuals at early ages in groups with
lower SES (Crimmins, 2005). But selection effects cannot
easily explain the contrasting relationships across different
domains of objective and subjectively reported health. These
puzzles could be partly due to systematic biases by SES in
subjective self-reports, but they also may reflect true differ-
ences in SES gradients across different domains of health.
For example, it could be that low SES is associated with de-
manding physical labor across the life course that manifests
in self-reported pain and mobility problems, whereas middle
and higher income is associated with developed country life-
styles that elevate cardiovascular risks for mortality. Buffers
to low SES may also operate differentially on different health
domains, with national health insurance enabling low SES to
buffer the ill effects of certain medically manageable cardio-
vascular risk factors, but with fewer buffers potentially avail-
able against the adverse effects of cumulative insults from
low social and occupational status.
Costa Rica is well known as a country with outstanding
health indicators. Its life expectancy at birth (78 years) is
the second highest in the Americas (Canada is first), higher
even than in the United States (World Bank, 2006). Broad
explanations of Costa Rica's health achievements in the lit-
erature include the orientation of the government toward
equity and social development, with large social invest-
ments being possible in part due to the absence of military
expenditures, given that the 1949 constitution abolished the
armed forces (Rosero-Bixby, 1991). Investments in educa-
tion and the very high coverage of health insurance are of-
ten mentioned as key factors (Caldwell, 1986). The social
security system, which is funded from deductions from pay-
rolls and from contributions by employers and the govern-
ment, is the provider of health insurance and health services
with an almost universal coverage, especially for the elderly
population. All workers in the formal sector and many
workers in the informal sector contribute to the system and
are entitled to health insurance that allows them and their
families to receive free health care services and free medi-
cations at any hospital, clinic, or community health center.
Additionally, the government provides free health insurance
to poor people. According to the 2000 census, health insur-
ance covers 82% of the population, including 9% destitute
individuals whose insurance is paid by the government
(Rosero-Bixby, 2004a).These percentages are higher among
the elderly population. Provision of primary health care,
particularly to remote or poor populations, has had a quan-
tifiable impact on death rates (Rosero-Bixby, 2004b).
In economic terms, Costa Rica does not differ from the
Latin American average. According to the World Bank
(2006), its per capita income is about $4,600 per year, com-
pared with the $3,600 average for Latin America. However,
in terms of equity in income distribution, social security
coverage, access to public health services and sanitation,
labor laws, and protection of the environment, Costa Rica
ranks among the highest in the continent. Costa Rica has a
mixed economy with open markets and, at the same time,
government control of key areas such as health, education,
banking, energy, communications, and insurance (Mesa-
Lago, 2000). The Human Development Index of the United
Nations ranks Costa Rica 48th in the world and fourth in
Latin America (after Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay).
This article follows a simple framework (Figure 1) to or-
ganize the different dimensions and indicators of health
(Crimmins & Seeman, 2004). General health outcomes such
as mortality and physical functioning are the end points of
the framework. Proximate determinants very close to these
outcomes are specific biological risk factors, usually mea-
sured by biomarkers such as blood pressure, obesity, and
glucose levels. Then, one step back in the explanation hier-
archy, there are health behaviors (diet, smoking, exercising)
and health care services. This article analyzes the SES gra-
dient for these three levels of health dimensions. Some de-
mographic factors, such as age, sex, and marital status, are
considered at the same hierarchical level and SES, and
therefore their confounding effects must be controlled for.
Objective
The purpose of the article is to fill the breach in the litera-
ture regarding SES gradients in objectively measured adult
health indicators in developing countries. Does the well-
documented, strong connection of poor health and low SES
among adults of rich countries and among children of
developing countries persist in hard data for adults in middle-
income countries like Costa Rica?
SURPRISING SES GRADIENTS IN HEALTH 107
This analysis is of interest for multiple reasons. First,
SES disparities in health outcomes are interesting in and of
themselves and have received a great deal of public atten-
tion in other settings (such as in the United States or among
children in Latin America). Yet they have rarely been docu-
mented in Latin American adult populations, primarily due
to lack of data, except on a few select indicators. A key con-
tribution of this article is the availability in CRELES of a
wide range of both subjective and objective health mea-
sures, which we analyze within a uniform empirical frame-
work, creating an unparalleled opportunity in LatinAmerica
to make SES gradient comparisons across them.
Second, the analysis is of interest because once we have
established stylized facts about health disparities in this
population, we can begin to evaluate existing hypotheses
and generate new ones about the determinants of health pat-
terns in this setting. There are many hypotheses about why
health is typically worse in low SES populations. Similarly,
many hypotheses have been advanced about how a middle-
income country such as Costa Rica has been able to obtain
exceptionally good population average health outcomes,
such as higher life expectancy than the United States.
These generally relate to models of the social determi-
nants of population health: health care access, health be-
haviors, environmental health exposures, psychosocial
stressors (inequality), and the ability to buffer against nega-
tive health shocks (social safety nets, social capital, and in-
terpersonal ties). Although we do not formally test such
hypotheses in this article, our analyses speak to the face va-
lidity of how some of these may or may not operate in Costa
Rica. Because this is the first nationwide survey of adult
health in Costa Rica, this article provides the first opportu-
nity for beginning to evaluate such hypotheses.
The main hypothesis that we do test in this article is the
provocative proposition that there is no SES gradient in
Costa Rican adult health. This hypothesis is based on prior
findings of no education or wealth gradients in Costa Rican
mortality, from the only previous study on the subject, using
data from a single peri-urban community (Rosero-Bixby
et al., 2005). Observers have hypothesized that Costa Rica
may have little SES gradient due to factors such as universal
health insurance (which has allowed low SES groups simi-
lar access to care as high SES groups) in combination with
Costa Rica perhaps being an unusually equitable society.
For these factors to have been instrumental in minimizing
SES gradients, however, it should be the case that SES gra-
dients would be minimal across a wide range of health indi-
cators beyond just mortality--which is exactly what our
analyses test.
Data and Methods
Data for this analysis come from CRELES, an on-going
longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of
about 9,000 adults aged 60 years and over and residing in
Costa Rica in the year 2000, with oversampling of the old-
est old and with an in-depth, longitudinal survey in a sub-
sample of about 3,000 of them. For this analysis, we use
mortality data from the computer follow-up of the sample
in the national death registry from September 2000 to
September 2006. The data on health (mostly prevalence of
conditions) come from the first wave of interviews in the
3,000 subsample, conducted from November 2004 to
September 2006. The mother sample of 9,000 individuals
was randomly selected from the 2000 census database after
stratification by 5-year age groups. Sampling fractions
ranged from 1.1% among those born in 1941­1945 to 100%
for those born before 1905. For the in-depth longitudinal
survey, CRELES took from the mother sample a systematic
subsample of 60 "health areas" (out of 102 for the whole
country). This subsample included originally more than
4,000 individuals: 2,827 of them were finally interviewed.
The subsample, which covers 59% of Costa Rican territory,
yielded the following nonresponse rates: 19% of the indi-
viduals were deceased by the contact date, 18% were not
found in the field, 2% moved to other addresses, 2% re-
jected the interview, and 2% remain as pending interviews
after several visits (likely rejections). The individuals we

did not find in the field originated mostly in the vagueness
of the census address (and the lack of an accurate address
system in Costa Rica), as well as from address changes dur-
ing the approximately 5-year lag between the census and
our visit. Thus, it would be unlikely that this group's SES
patterns in health would be so different from the inter-
viewed population so as to create significant selection ef-
fects that bias the estimated health­SES relationships.
Among those interviewed, 95% provided a blood sample,
92% collected urine overnight, 91% had all anthropometric
measures, and 24% required a proxy to answer the ques-
tionnaire.
All the data and specimens in the subsample were col-
lected at the participants' homes, usually in two visits. In
the first visit, participants provided informed consent and
answered a 90-min questionnaire (including some mobility
tests and two blood pressure measures) as well as a 10-min
frequency of tracer food consumption questionnaire. In a
second visit early the next day, fasting blood samples were
collected by venipuncture: one EDTA tube (for 3­4 ml of
whole blood) and two serum-separating tubes, with a clot
activator (for 10­12 ml of blood, to obtain 4­6 ml of se-
rum). In this visit, the field team also picked up a cooler
containing 12-h overnight urine and took the anthropomet-
ric measures. All field data were collected using Personal
Digital Assistants, also known as palm computers, with
software applications developed by the Central American
Population Center for this study.
A field team of five interviewers, two phlebotomists, and
a supervisor collected the information and the blood and
urine specimens using a continuous fieldwork design over a
period of nearly 2 years. The field team received a 2-week
training course that included standardized anthropometric
measures. Several Costa Rican laboratories analyzed the
blood and urine specimens, depending on the type of bio-
marker. All laboratories were certified by a national refer-
ence center of clinical chemistry, an agency under the
Ministry of Health. In addition to the internal reliability
tests that these laboratories must conduct as part of their
quality control procedures, we conducted reliability analy-
ses in subsamples of 20­40 specimens that were reanalyzed
for each biomarker in a different laboratory. We report else-
where the results of these reliability analyses, as well as
some adjustments introduced to standardize measures
across laboratories (Méndez-Chacón, Rosero-Bixby,
Fernández-Rojas, & Barrantes-Jiménez, 2007).
We identified deaths of the 8,000 individuals in the origi-
nal sample by computer follow-up in the national death reg-
istry during the period 2000­2007, using the unique
identification number (the cédula) that all Costa Ricans
have. Prior research has indicated that the death registry is
virtually 100% complete (Rosero-Bixby, 2008). To further
validate the registry quality, we were able to successfully
match in the registry all of the several hundred deaths that
we identified while attempting to contact individuals in the
field for the household survey, thus finding no deaths miss-
ing from the registry.
Dependent Variables--Health Outcomes
We study three groups of dependent variables. All are
coded as 0, 1 dichotomous indicators, with 1 measuring un-
favorable conditions or events: (a) general health outcomes,
(b) specific poor health conditions, including biomarkers,
and (c) unhealthy lifestyles.
1. Seven general health outcomes:
Death in the period September 2000 to Septem-
·
ber 2007, in the sample of about 8,000 individu-
als. About 1,000 foreigners are excluded from the
original mother sample of 9,000 because they do not
have the personal identification ID that allows the
computer follow-up to establish death and its date.
The database was organized as a survival time file
with left and right censoring. Individuals were ob-
served 7 years or until death. The information on age
is computed from the birth date in the birth record,
avoiding the possibility of age-exaggeration errors.
Ordinal general SRH status. From the five possible
·
answers, we took the two lowest (mala and regular)
as defining poor SRH.
Functional disability when
· respondents have difficul-
ties doing 50% or more of 14 activities and instru-
mental activities and instrumental activities of daily
living (activities of daily living (ADLs)/instrumental
activities of daily living (IADLs)), namely: walking
on the streets, climbing stairs, pushing objects, raising
an arm, crossing the bedroom on your feet, bathing,
eating, going to bed, using the toilet, trimming toe
nails, cooking, handling money, shopping, and taking
medicines. Even though many studies distinguish ba-
sic, instrumental, and functional disabilities, we com-
bine all these dimensions in a single indicator after
checking that the Cronbach's alpha of the scale was an
excellent .92 for the 14 items. This high alpha means
that the items were not really different dimensions of
disability. A person with basic disability (i.e., cannot
use the toilet) is very likely to also have functional and
instrumental disability (i.e., cannot cut toenails).
Physical frailty: respondents failing two or more
·
out of five physical tests--grip strength with a
dynamometer, pulmonary peak flow, standing up
from a chair several times, picking an object up
from the floor, and standing and walking 3 m.
Cognitive disability
· according to the Folstein
(Folstein & Folstein, 1975) Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE) (Quiroga,Albala, & Klaasen,
2004). We considered disabled those with less than
75% right answers of 15 items. The scale from
adding the 15 items had an acceptable Cronbach's
alpha of .72.
SURPRISING SES GRADIENTS IN HEALTH 109
Geriatric depression refers to individuals with nine
·
or more out of 15 Yesavage symptoms of depres-
sion (Sheikh &Yesavage, 1986). It is not measured
in participants who required a proxy (24%). The
Cronbach's alpha of the scale was .85.
Metabolic syndrome,
· which is a combination of five
health conditions (abdominal girth, diabetes, triglyc-
erides, High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) cholester-
ol, and high blood pressure) that increase a respon-
dent's risk for CVD as defined by the International
Diabetes Federation (IDF, 2006). The syndrome is
present when individuals have high abdominal girth
and at least two of the other four conditions.
2. Specific biological risk factors (Table 2 shows the
cutoff points to define "at risk"). Some of them are
components of the previous health outcomes. Most
are components of the concept of allostatic load or
biological dysregulation (Seeman et al., 2004). Details
about specific indicators can be found in Crimmins and
Seeman (2004).
2.1 CVD factors:
Abdominal girth (waist >80 cm women, 94 cm
·
men)
Diabetes, controlled or not (glycosylated hemoglo-
·
bin 6.5% or taking medicine)
High blood pressure, controlled or not (diastolic
·
>90 and systolic >140 mmHg in at least three out
of four measurements or taking medicine)
High triglycerides in fasting serum (
· 50 mg/dl)
High cholesterol ratio (total to HDL
· 5.92)
2.2 Various deregulation indicators (some are also related
to CVD)
Low creatinine clearance (
· 44.64 mg/dl), an indi-
cator of kidney function
High cortisol (
· 25.69 mg/g), indicator of activity
in the hypothalamic pituitary (HPA) axis in re-
sponse to stressors
Low dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S,
·
35 mg/dl). Antagonist to HPA activity
High epinephrine (
· 4.99 mg/g) in 12-h overnight
urine. Indicator of neuroendocrine functioning in
response to stress
High norepinephrine (
· 48 mg/g) in 12-h overnight
urine. Similar to epinephrine
High C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations
·
(10 mg/L). Indicator of inflammation, immuno-
response, and other conditions. Also a risk factor
for CVD
Weak handgrip strength (dynamometer
· 20 kg)
3. Unhealthy lifestyles
Obesity (body mass index >30). (Note this is re-
·
dundant with abdominal girth, which was included
among CVD factors. It is included in this group as
a summary indicator of unhealthy lifestyles regard-
ing food consumption and physical activity.)
Smoking current
·
No regular exercise in last year
·
No flu vaccine last year (a tracer of preventive care
·
seeking)
High-calorie diet (>3000 day)
·
Low-calorie diet (<1500 day)
·
High-carbohydrate diet (>400 g day)
·
High-fat diet (>40 g day)
·
We have a total of 27 health indicators. Although there is
some degree of overlap for several of them, this large num-
ber reflects the multidimensional character of the health
concept and the complexities of measuring it. To facilitate
interpretation and comparisons of results among the differ-
ent outcomes, we opted for measuring them all with binary
or dichotomous indicators of bad health. We recognize that
there is some loss of information from translating continu-
ous variables into dichotomous indicators. However, this
loss is compensated by the gain in comparability and inter-
pretability as well as by the gain of avoiding the distorting
effects from extreme outlier values. Where possible, we di-
chotomized variables with cutoff values commonly used in
clinical practice and the literature, including MMSE cogni-
tive disability, Yesavage geriatric depression, triglycerides,
CRP, obesity, abdominal obesity, and high- and low-calorie
diet. There are also several indicators that are naturally di-
chotomous, including death, metabolic syndrome, diabetes,
high blood pressure, smoking, lack of physical exercise, and
flu vaccine. For the remaining 12 (out of 27) variables, our
choice of cutoff values was driven by the observation of
natural breaks in the distribution (SRH, functional disabil-
ity, frailty, grip strength, and carbohydrate and fat intake) or
was borrowed from the MacArthur study of healthy aging
(Crimmins & Seeman, 2004; Seeman et al., 2004).
SES Variables
We examine the effect on health of three SES variables:
place of residence, education, and household wealth. All
three are categorized in three levels in order to ascertain the
two sides of SES gradients: pertaining to a low-SES stratum
or being a high-SES individual. For comparison purposes,
these three variables are considered constant over time, and
we are taking them as reported in the 2000 census, years
prior to health measurement (note that mortality is studied
for the period 2000­2007, prevalence of health conditions
in the 2005­2006 survey, and the SES indicators are the
same in both data sets).
1. Place of residence in 2000: (1) in the less developed
lowlands, which include coastal regions at the Pacific
Ocean and Caribbean, as well as the northern plains
bordering Nicaragua and the Southern region bordering
Panama; (2) in the rest of the highlands at the Central
Valley, which includes some suburbs and satellite towns
of San Jose; (3) in the more developed metropolitan
ROSERO-BIXBY AND DOW

area of San Jose, the capital city. Although "place" is
not an individual-level variable, there is a large litera-
ture considering the role of place in health disparities
(e.g., Curtis and Rees-Jones, 1998). Our simple catego-
rization distinguishing urban and these other settings is
consistent with a long literature that has documented
rural­urban differences in health in various settings.
2. Educational attainment in three naturally defined
groups: (a) none, (b) elementary (one to six grades),
and (c) some secondary (postelementary) school or
higher. The effects of education are some of the most
studied among SES variables, given that education is
easy to measure, does not change in adult life, is easily
comparable, and has a number of socioeconomic influ-
ences related to factors such as empowerment, income
generation, information gathering, and health-seeking
behavior (Elo & Preston, 1996; Hummer, Rogers, &
Eberstein, 1998).
3. Household wealth in three groups: poor, middle, and
rich. It is based on a simple count of 14 goods and con-
veniences in the household, ranging from no-dirt floors
and having water connection and electricity to (at the
high end) having a computer and a car. The wealth cat-
egories correspond to natural breaks in the distribution
of the 0­14 count. Wealth is in essence income accu-
mulation or permanent income and thus an indicator
of economic well-being during long periods (Menchik,
1993).
Demographic and Other Controls
As far as possible, we present all health results adjusted
by three demographic variables: (a) age (single year), (b)
sex, and (c) marital status (whether or not currently mar-
ried--including consensual unions). Age and marital status
refer to the situation at the interview in all prevalence
analyses. In the mortality analysis, age is time varying
(each observation was split into single-age segments), and
marital status is in the census interview in the year 2000.
We also controlled in the regression models for the field
worker who conducted the interview or took the anthropo-
metric measures or other exams to correct potential inter-
viewer and measurement biases (all data were gathered by
seven field workers over a period of 2 years). Although all
field workers received the same training, and visited the
same areas, and the work load was more or less randomly
distributed, it is always possible that idiosyncratic behavior
of a specific field worker might introduce some measure-
ment bias. For example, female examiners may tend to
measure significantly lower values of waist circumference
in female participants. Controlling for field worker in the
multivariate analyses prevented the remote possibility that
these biases were also correlated to SES of participants and
thus were confounders of the relationship between health
and SES.
Statistical Methods
To study mortality, we set the data as survival time
(Statacorp, 2005), with entry date at September 2000 (3
months after the census interview to avoid likely biases in
case some hospitalized or very sick individuals were not
interviewed in the June census) and exit or right censoring
at September 2007. We split observations into single-year
segments (approximately seven segments per individual).
Mortality rates were computed as the ratio of deaths to the
exact count of person-years. We model some SES gradi-
ents in mortality with parametric hazard regression (streg
command in Stata), assuming a Gompertz distribution
(Hosmer & Lemeshow, 1999).
We used logistic regression models to estimate the SES
gradients on health outcomes. The models control for de-
mographic confounding effects as well as for the studied
SES effects. To consider the possibility that age effects are
nonlinear and differential by sex, we included in the models
a quadratic term for age and an interaction term for age and
sex. To compare odds ratios across models, we reanalyzed
mortality using a logistic model with the probability of dy-
ing in each age of the observation period as the dependent
variable. In this model, we used robust estimates that take
into account the lack of independence of age segments
within each individual.
The standard errors in the logistic models were estimated
considering the clustering effect of selecting whole health
areas in the subsample. This relaxed the assumption of inde-
pendence among observations and required only that obser-
vations be independent across clusters. In some analyses,
we assessed the significance of the joint effect of the three
SES variables with a chi-square test of the improvement in
the log-likelihood ratio resulting from including SES in the
regression model.
Results
Table 1 shows the sizes and the composition by SES and
demographic characteristics of the sample. The three cate-
gories by place of residence are about the same size. In con-
trast, education and wealth define a middle group with about
two thirds of the observations. The low-end and high-end
groups for these two variables comprise between 10% and
25% of observations. The distribution by age reflects over-
sampling of old-age groups by design. As usual in elderly
populations, there are more women than men. About 50%
of the sample is married or in consensual union.
Sample size varies depending on the studied outcome
(Table 2). For studying mortality, our sample is more than
8,000 individuals or more than 50,000 person-years. For
prevalence outcomes, the sample size is generally between
2,500 and 2,800. For some specific indicators, the size
further diminishes by a few hundred because of noncom-
pliance or refusals in blood sample and urine collection.
The index of geriatric depression can be computed only
SURPRISING SES GRADIENTS IN HEALTH 111
for respondents who did not require a proxy in the interview
(76%). We also have smaller sample size (about 1,600) for
epinephrine and norepinephrine analyses because of degra-
dation of stored urine samples.
Table 2 shows the observed values for the 27 health indi-
cators by two large age brackets: 60­79 years and 80 or
more years. Comparing the two age groups provides an ini-
tial snapshot of how indicators shift with age, although it
does not allow us to separate out potential confounding
from cohort-specific effects (e.g., younger cohorts adopting
Western lifestyles that influence their health) as well as se-
lection effects (e.g., smokers may die at younger ages,
which means that they are underrepresented at older ages).
Given that all are poor-health indicators, one would expect
substantial increments with age (although evidence from
other studies shows that some of these risk factors, such as
obesity, cholesterol, and high blood pressure, may decline
in late life as a result of other serious comorbidities). This is
the case for the mortality rate with a sixfold increase--the
largest in the table. Cognitive and functional disabilities
show a fivefold increment, with age being the closest to
mortality. SRH and depression change little with age, and
metabolic syndrome actually moves in the opposite direc-
tion from the expected age effect--declining (which is a
health improvement) 20% for older people. Health condi-
tions that do not worsen, and even improve, with aging in-
clude the five components of metabolic syndrome: obesity,
diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high
triglycerides. These age trends could be a reflection of im-
proved CV health with aging within each individual. Or
they could simply come from changes in the composition of
the population with aging in a selection in frailty process
(Vaupel, Manton, & Stallard, 1979) that eliminates the frail
and sick at earlier ages. The remaining biomarkers in the
second panel of Table 2 deteriorate (increase) with age, al-
though at rates substantially lower than mortality. Low crea-
tinine clearance, a marker of kidney malfunction, and grip
strength are the only ones with a substantial aging increase
(ratio higher than 2).
Most behavioral or lifestyle indicators in the third panel
of Table 2 improve (diminish) with age. Prevalence of
smoking and obesity are less than half after age 80 than in
the 60­79 age group, high-calorie diet diminishes by 40%,
and high-carbohydrate diet by one third. The only behav-
ioral deteriorations in the table are the lack of exercise and
an increase in the proportion of individuals with a hypocal-
oric diet (probably because of loss of appetite).
Turning to the SES gradient issue, the exceptionally good
health indicators of the Costa Rican population are by them-
selves a challenge to the notion of an inevitable SES gradient.
Death rates of Costa Rican adults in the CRELES sample are
lower than in the United States and not very different than in
Japan, especially at higher ages (Figure 2), in spite of the sub-
stantially lower SES of the Latin American population mea-
sured by any traditional indicator such as education, income,
or health expenditure. It is remarkable that a population with
a per capita income that is one fifth of the United States' and
per capita health expenditures that are one tenth of the United
States' can have lower death rates than the United States. Life
expectancy at age 60 implicit in the mortality rates in Figure
2 is 22.4 years for men and 24.8 for women in the Costa Ri-
can sample. The corresponding values are 20.2 and 23.4 for
the United States and 21.9 and 27.3 for Japan.
Often demographers have found that apparently low
mortality at old ages in developing countries are solely an
artifact of mismeasurement, particularly because of age ex-
aggeration in census data that inflates the denominator and
depletes the rates (Coale & Kisker, 1986; Preston, Elo, &
Stewart, 1999). In the Costa Rican sample, however, age
errors are very unlikely because we are using data on exact
birthdates as they appear in civil registration records and on
the universal identity card, the cédula. The possibility that
we are finding low rates because of missing deaths in our
computer follow-up is also remote because in the subsam-
ple of about 4,000 individuals CRELES visited, there was
not a single case of a deceased person that was not also re-
corded in the national death registry computer follow-up.
Furthermore, two other studies of old age mortality in Costa
Rica have found similarly low rates (Rosero-Bixby, 2008;
Rosero-Bixby et al., 2005).

Within Costa Rica, there is not a clear SES gradient in
adult mortality or, if anything, the gradient is contrary to
expectations. Table 3 and Figure 3 show that in our sample,
there are slight increases in mortality with higher levels of
education and wealth, net of other influences, and the least
developed lowlands have lower mortality than the more de-
veloped highlands. Only the more developed capital city
behaves according to expectations, showing lower mortal-
ity, although by a small margin.
These mortality gradients contrast dramatically with the ob-
served differentials by SRH in Table 3 and Figure 3. The afflu-
ent and those with high school education self-report 40% less
poor health than the national population. The poor, those with
no formal education, and those living in the lowlands report
20% more poor health than the national average. This contra-
diction between mortality and SRH is the motivation for the
adjective of "surprising" SES gradients in this article's title.
In four other health outcomes, SES effects are similar to
those observed for SRH (Table 3). High-SES individuals
are less affected by functional, physical, and cognitive
disabilities, or by depression. However, metabolic syndrome
(a multidimensional risk factor for CVD) behaves more
like mortality with no significant SES differentials. There
are also peculiarities of metabolic syndrome variation with
age (no gradient), sex (much lower in men), and conjugal
status (higher among the married), but these are not the
focus of this article. Given the enormous importance of
CVD in adult mortality (nearly half of old-age deaths are

cardiovascular related in Costa Rica), this CVD risk factor
helps explain the observed lack of SES gradients in overall
mortality.
To more finely explore the SES gradients in 20 interme-
diate health conditions, Table 4 summarizes the results ob-
tained from a series of logistic regressions.With a regression
model for each health condition, We first estimated the net
effects of the three SES variables and whether there was a
significant joint effect of including the three variables in
each model. In one third of the health indicators in the table
(6 out of 20), there are no significant joint SES effects. In
the rest, the SES gradient sometimes behaves as expected
with below-one odds ratio for the high-SES categories and
above one for the low SES. However, the reverse also is
present in several indicators, such as obesity and triglycer-
ides. To make things more complicated, there are several
cases of a curvilinear SES gradient, in which the middle-
SES group is the worse off. That is the case for triglycerides
by wealth; cholesterol and abdominal girth by education;
and DHEA-S, epinephrine, and norepinephrine by place of
residence.
Figure 4 summarizes the large amount of information
presented in Tables 3 and 4. With a logistic regression model
for each health condition, the net effect of the three high-
SES characteristics (metro San Jose, high school education,
and rich wealth). We then summarized the three odds ratios
by computing the one that would correspond to an individ-
ual with simultaneously the three high-SES characteristics;
that is, by multiplication of the three odds ratios, and (ex-
cept in six cases as described subsequently) we report this
product in Figure 4. Given that this procedure presumes no
interactions among the three SES variables, we also tested
models with the triple interaction of the three low-SES indi-
cators and with the triple interaction of the three high-SES
indicators (these extreme groups of all low SES and all high
SES each represent only 4% of the sample). In the six (out
of 54) regression models where these interactions proved
significant, we instead report in Figure 4 an odds ratio that
includes this triple interaction, rather than the previously
described product of the odds ratios in the uninteracted
model. In five of the six significant triple-interacted models,
results were insensitive to the choice of method. Figure 4
shows these hypothetical odds ratios, sorted descending by
the low-SES effect, which conversely results in approxi-
mately ascending sorting by the high-SES effects. Figures
below 1 (dots at the left) denote good health; that is, the risk
of suffering the condition is lower in the group with respect
to the rest of the population.
If the SES gradient behaved as expected in Figure 4,
the high-SES triangles should line up at the left of the

and physical disability; and depression), as well as in just
two biomarkers (norepinephrine and grip strength) and
two behavioral conditions (smoking and lack of exercise).
Counterbalancing the aforementioned health indicators,
there are 10 conditions in which low-SES individuals do sig-
nificantly better than high-SES groups: death, creatinine
clearance, high-calorie diet, high blood pressure, obesity,
high epinephrine, triglycerides, and low DHEA-S levels, as
well as the metabolic syndrome and its main component: ab-
dominal girth. The pattern of the flu vaccine (although mar-
ginally nonsignificant) is on line with earlier findings that the
Costa Rican primary health care system equalizes access to
health in all SES levels. It has been shown, for example, that
there is a lower coverage of immunization among children of
more affluent mothers (Chen-Mok et al., 2001). It is interest-
ing to note that in several CVD risk factors, the SES disad-
vantagedgroupsdobetter,includingtriglycerides,cholesterol
ratio, high blood pressure, diabetes, and fatty diet, although
some of the effects are not significant.
Discussion
Rich data for elderly Costa Ricans from the CRELES
project, which include a 6-year follow-up of a sample of
8,000 as well as biomarkers in a subsample of about 2,500,
show puzzling SES gradients in 26 health indicators. Disad-
vantaged groups in terms of education, wealth, and resi-
dence show steep health deficits in SRH as well as in
indicators of functionality and physical and mental fitness.
In contrast, in the single most important health outcome,
mortality, there are no significant SES differentials; on the
contrary, there are even hints that low-SES groups might be
better off. Metabolic syndrome, a risk factor for CVD,
shows a similar pattern as mortality.
The direct relationship between SES and mortality found
in these data may occur only in the elderly population under
study (60 years and over). The usual inverse relationship
may persist in younger ages, which were not included in the
analyzed sample.
This study intentionally considers a large number of
health indicators to reflect the multidimensional character
of the health concept. The results show that these multiple
dimensions of health do not behave in a monolithic way.
SES, and aging as well, generates very diverse responses in
different aspects of health. Cognitive impairment, for ex-
ample, is substantially higher at older age and low SES (al-
though the strong negative association with education may
be exaggerated by a cultural bias in the Mini Mental test).
Similarly, geriatric depression in our data is one of the most
clear correlates with low SES, but it changes little with age
(though the latter may be due to the large proportion of
missing responses among the oldest old needing a proxy in
the interview). Our stress-related biomarkers--epinephrine
and norepinephrine--also show an advantage for the afflu-
ent and educated.
Risk factors for CVD show more nuanced and mixed pat-
terns by SES. These Costa Rican data show that socioeco-
nomically disadvantaged populations have lower prevalence

of obesity, hypercholesterolemia, triglycerides, hyperten-
sion, and hyperglycemia. The changing association between
SES and CVD merits careful monitoring in countries like
Costa Rica. DHEA-S, a hormone some consider a marker of
aging, also shows a more favorable situation in low-SES
individuals.
Behavioral or lifestyle risk factors also show diver-
gent patterns by SES. Smoking, sedentariness, and high-
carbohydrate diets are less prevalent among the better off.
But obesity, high fat, and high-calorie diets diminish con-
sistently and substantially with SES. Interestingly, there
are no negative SES gradients in our indicator of access to
preventive care: having had the flu vaccine. This is an in-
dication of an important attribute of the public primary
health care system in Costa Rica--its coverage of the
lower strata of society to equalize access to health care
(Rosero-Bixby, 2004a).
Viewing the diet-related biomarkers in conjunction with
the dietary intake data, we can hypothesize that worse nu-
tritional behaviors among higher SES groups may be play-
ing a significant role in driving the worse CVD risks, and
hence higher mortality, among the higher SES. Moreover,
the low-calorie diet of low-SES individuals might be a
protective factor because it has been shown that dietary
caloric restriction slows ageing in other species (Roth et
al., 2002). This raises the question of what the time path
has been and will be of SES gradients in nutritional be-
haviors. A substantial literature has documented the tran-
sition of middle-income countries from positive
SES­obesity relationships to negative ones as countries
develop (e.g., Monteiro, Moura, Conde, & Popkin, 2004);
whereas countries such as Mexico appear to have already
moved through this nutritional transition, Costa Rica ap-
pears to lag. It will be useful for future work to document
the history of this SES­nutrition relationship in Costa
Rica, as well as to closely track its evolution, as this may
have major implications for whether Costa Rica's mortal-
ity gradient reverses in the future to the more usual nega-
tive relationship with SES.
For the broader set of health indicators examined, how-
ever, we do not know whether the findings in this article are
unique to Costa Rica or whether they are common in other
middle- and low-income countries. Reliable data to study
SES gradients in adult mortality and in "hard" health indi-
cators are rare. The more available "soft" data on SRH show
the steep SES gradient observed in this article. However,
this article shows that one cannot jump from there to con-
clusions on other health outcomes. More research is clearly
needed in adult health outside the developed countries.
Costa Rica is a special case of exceptional achievements
in health and social development in spite of a weak econ-
omy. Two decades ago it was included, along with Sri
Lanka, Kerala, China, and Cuba, among the world show-
cases of "good health at low cost" (Halstead, Walsh, &
Warren, 1985), and it has remained in that category. Some
have explained the country's longevity achievements with
its investments in education and health insurance (Caldwell,
1986). However, those can only be part of the explanation
because even those with no education are doing fine in im-
portant aspects of health, including health dimensions not
clearly influenced by medical care access. It could even be
that if a poor or traditional society completes the first stage
of the epidemiologic transition by controlling communicable
diseases, some traditional lifestyles can protect it from health
problems like obesity and take it to better general health in-
dicators such as lower mortality. This evidence of success is
tempered, however, by our strong evidence of a significant
SES gradient in functional and mental health indicators, sug-
gesting that disability-free life expectancy is indeed worse
among more vulnerable adults even in Costa Rica.
