Introduction
Pain is a warning signal in our body which elicits during
the abnormality of the physiological process,1,2 whereas
neuropathic pain is not a symptom, but a disease itself.
Generally, it occurs due to damage of the nervous sys-
tem.3,4 The International Association for the Study of Pain
(IASP) defined neuropathic pain as `pain initiated or
caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous
system'.5,6 The damage of the nervous system produces
pain sensations such as hyperalgesia, allodynia7 and spon-
taneous pain.8 Clinically, neuropathic pain is managed by
various conventional medicines, i.e. anti-depressants
(amitryptyline, nortriptyline, lofepramine, duloxetine and
venlafaxine); anti-convulsants (gabapentin and pregaba-
lin); opioids (morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, buprenor-
phine and methadone) and topical agents (lidocaine,
tramadol, codeine and dihydrocodiene).9 However, long-
term administration inevitably produces unwanted side
effects, i.e. dizziness, blurred vision, palpitation, sedation,
urinary retention and reduced appetite.9
Recent studies have documented the chronic injury of
the peripheral nerve, which produces activation of the
sympathetic (efferent) nervous system10,11 followed by
the enhanced release of renin, angiotensin and aldoster-
one via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) path-
way.12­14 Further, angiotensin plays a critical role in

Abstract
Introduction: The present study was designed to investigate the effect of ramipril (angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitor) on the chronic constriction injury of sciatic nerve induced neuropathic pain in mice.
Methods: The neuropathic pain was induced by four loose ligations of the right sciatic nerve in mice. The battery of
behavioral tests, i.e. plantar, pin prick, tail flick, tail pinch, rota rod tests, were performed to assess the degree of thermal
and mechanical hyperalgesia in ipsilateral paw and tail, and motor in-coordination activity respectively. In addition, the
biochemical tests, i.e. total protein, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and reduced glutathione, were also performed
in sciatic nerve tissue samples.
Results: The administration of ramipril (2 and 4 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly attenuated chronic constriction injury-
induced rise in peripheral as well as central pain sensitivity (thermal and mechanical) along with impairment of motor
in-coordination activity. Further, it also produces ameliorative effects on chronic constriction injury-induced rise in
thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and decrease in glutathione levels when compared with a normal control group.
Conclusion: It may be concluded that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor may be a potential new target for the
management of neuropathic pain.

neuronal damage.15,16 The RAAS modulators have been
reported to ameliorate the neuropathic pain symptoms in
various experimental animal models, i.e. aliskiren, a
direct renin inhibitor;17 ZD-7155, an angiotensin I recep-
tor antagonist;18 EMA401 and EMA300, an angiotensin
II receptor antagonist;19,20 and spironolactone, an aldos-
terone antagonist.21
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
enhance the bradykinin level and can cause the pain sen-
sitivity via nociceptor (bradykinin receptor). Bradykinin
has pleiotrophic actions, and potent physiological effects,
i.e. decreased blood pressure, increased vascular permea-
bility and the promotion of classical symptoms of inflam-
mation such as vasodilation, hyperthermia, edema and
pain (warning signal). In addition, it has beneficial effects,
i.e. potent anti-thrombogenic, anti-proliferative and anti-
fibrogenic effects.22 Bradykinin is an endogenous nona-
peptide which is catabolised by ACE. ACE inhibitors
increase the level of bradykinin by reduction of catabolic
action of BK(1-9)
. BK(1-9)
produces the pain sensation by
direct stimulation of nociceptors in the peripheral nervous
system but this effect is of very short duration of action
and its half-life is very short (15 seconds).23 In addition,
BK(1-9)
is not only degraded by ACE but also by other
enzymatic pathways, i.e. aminopeptidase P, carboxypepti-
dase, dipeptidyl peptidase IV, endothelin-converting
enzyme, neprilysin, propyl oligopeptidase, and the neutral
endopeptidase.23,24 Furthermore, bradykinin has also been
reported to produce pro- and anti-nociceptive action in a
dose dependent manner.25 The lipophilic ACE inhibitor
rapidly crosses the central nervous system, and its half-life
in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is 0.5­0.75 h.26,27 In addition,
ACE inhibitor, i.e. ramipril, has pleiotropic effects, which
is not equally shared by other ACE inhibitors. Moreover,
ramipril also increases the endothelium-dependent relaxa-
tion factor (i.e. nitric oxide) and vasodilatation via B2
receptors.28 Ramipril has a potential role in cardiovascular
outcomes along with neuroprotective action.29
However, the RAAS modulator is known to produce
potential side effects, such as angioedema, hypotension
and acute pancreatitis by angiotensin receptor blocker,
renin inhibitor and ACE inhibitors.30­32 ACE inhibitors and
angiotensin receptor blockers both cause cough and angi-
oedema which produces cardiovascular risk in human.33,34
Angiotensin II is more prone to causing vasoconstriction
along with ischemic neuropathy by activation of the angio-
tensin receptor in the nervous system.35 Angiotensin II for-
mation is due toACE activity. The reduction of angiotensin
II may be beneficial in neurodegenerative disorders such
as neuropathic pain, instead of angiotensin receptor block-
ers and renin inhibitors.17,35 However, the role of ACE
inhibitors has not yet been explored in the chronic con-
striction injury of sciatic nerve induced neuropathic pain
model in mice. Therefore, the present study is focused
to evaluate ramipril (ARTERE®; ACE inhibitor) in the
management of chronic constriction injury-induced neuro-
pathic pain in mice.
Materials and method
Drugs and chemicals
Folin-Ciocalteu's phenol reagent (Merck Limited,
Mumbai), 5,5'-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB),
1,1',3,3' tetramethoxy propane, reduced glutathione and
bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sisco Research Laboratories
Pvt. Ltd. Mumbai) were procured for the present study.
DTNB was dissolved in 1% w/v of sodium citrate. All the
reagents used in the present study were of analytical grade.
Animals
Swiss mice weighing 25­30 g were employed in the present
study. Animals were maintained with a standard laboratory
diet (Markfed cotton seed processing plant, Gidderbaha,
Mukatsar, Punjab, India) and water ad libtium. Further ani-
mals were exposed to the natural light and dark cycle. The
experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional
Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC) and care of the animals
was taken as per the guidelines of the Committee for the
Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on
Animals (CPCSEA), Ministry of Environmental and Forest,
Government of India (Reg. no. 1407/a/11/CPCSEA).
Induction of peripheral neuropathy by chronic
constriction injury
Neuropathic pain was induced in mice by chronic constric-
tion injury of the sciatic nerve as described by Ma and
Eisenach.36 Briefly, mice were deeply anesthetized with
thiopental sodium (35 mg/kg, i.p.). The hair from the lower
back in the thigh region was removed and the skin was
sterilized with 0.5% w/v povidine solution. The skin and
muscle layer of the lateral surface of the right thigh was
incised and the sciatic nerve was exposed. The four loose
ligatures (silk thread no. 4) were placed around the proxi-
mal portion of the sciatic nerve from the trifurcation part
(i.e. near knee joint), and a distance of 1 mm was main-
tained between each ligature. The loose ligatures were
applied until a short flick response of the ipsilateral hind
paw. After completion of the chronic constriction injury
(CCI) procedure, muscle and skin layer was immediately
sutured with silk thread and topical antibiotic powder was
applied at once. Nociceptive threshold was assessed at dif-
ferent time intervals: 0, 1, 3, 7 and 14 days.
Behavioral evaluation
Plantar test. Thermal (radiant) hyperalgesia was assessed
as described by the method of Hargreaves et al.37 Briefly,
Kaur et al. 105
the right hind paw of the mouse was placed on the radiant
heat source. The thermal sensitivity of the hind paws was
observed as the degree of hind paw withdrawal latency
from the radiant heat lamp source. Withdrawal of the hind
limb was considered as a positive response. The cut-off
time was maintained at 20 seconds.
Pin prick test.Mechanical hyperalgesia was assessed as
described by the method of Erichsen and Blackburn-
Munro.38 A blunted needle was applied to the mid plantar
surface of the right hind paw at an intensity sufficient to
produce a reflex withdrawal response. The needle was
applied six times per minute. Withdrawal of the hind limb
was considered as positive response. The cut off stimuli
was applied six times to avoid the tissue injury and wind-
up phenomenon.
Tail flick test.Tail thermal (radiant) hyperalgesia was
assessed as described by the method of D'Amour and
Smith39 with the slight modification of Hargreaves et al.37
Briefly, the tail of the mouse was placed on the radiant heat
source. The thermal sensitivity of the tail was observed as
the degree of tail withdrawal latency from the radiant heat
lamp source. Withdrawal of the tail was considered as pos-
itive response. The cut-off time was maintained at 15 sec-
onds to avoid tail damage.
Tail pinch test. Mechanical stimulus induced pain sensitiv-
ity was assessed by the tail pinch test according to modi-
fied Heffner's method as described by Takagi et al.40
Briefly, mice were tested by pinching their tail base with a
Hoffmann clamp adjusted to elicit a nociceptive response.
The nociceptive response was indicated by the number of
attempts at the dislodgment of the Heffner's clamp. The
pressure stimulus evoked nociceptive response was noted
and a cut-off time of 1 minute was maintained to prevent
tissue damage.
Rota rod test.The motor in-coordination was assessed as
described by the method of Jones and Roberts41 with the
slight modification of Muthuraman et al.42 Briefly, mice
were placed on the rotating rod (25 rpm) after a training
period (i.e. 5 min) before 30 minutes of motor in-coordina-
tion test. The motor in-coordination of mice was assessed
as the degree of fall in time from the rotating rod. The cut
off time was maintained at 5 minutes to avoid potential
muscular damage.
Biochemical analysis
All of the groups of animals were sacrificed after 14 days
by cervical dislocation and complete sciatic nerves were
isolated immediately. All parts of nerves were used for
biochemical estimations. The sciatic nerve was homoge-
nated (10% w/v) with phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and
centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was
used for the estimation of tissue total protein, thiobarbi-
turic acid reactive substances (TBARS) and reduced glu-
tathione (GSH) levels.
Estimation of total protein content. The tissue total protein
content was estimated as described by the method of
Lowry et al.43 Briefly, 300 µl of supernatant was diluted up
to 1 ml with distilled water in a test tube. Then 5 ml of
Lowry et al.'s reagent was added and allowed to stand for
15 min at room temperature. Then 0.5 ml of Folin­Ciocal-
teu reagent was added and the contents were vortexed vig-
orously and incubated at room temperature for 30 min.
This reaction gave purple chromogen in the presence of
protein. The protein content was estimated spectrophoto-
metrically (UV-1800 UV-Vis spectrophotometer, SHI-
MADZU Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) at 750 nm
wavelength. The bovine serum albumin (1­10 mg) was
used as standard. The results of total protein concentration
were expressed as mg/ml of supernatant.
Estimation of TBARS. The tissue TBARS content was esti-
mated as described by the method of Niehaus and Samu-
elsson.44 Briefly, 0.5 ml tissue homogenate was mixed
with 2.5 ml of (10%, w/v) trichloroacetic acid (TCA) solu-
tion and placed in a boiling water bath for 15 min. The test
tubes were cooled at room temperature and centrifuged at
1500 rpm for 10 min. Then 2 ml of each supernatant was
transferred to a test tube containing 1 ml of TCA (5% w/v)
­ TBA (0.38% w/v) ­ HCl (0.25 N) mixture. Test tubes
were again placed in a boiling water bath for 15 min and
cooled at room temperature. This reaction gave pink chro-
mogen in the presence of malondialdehyde. The absorb-
ance changes in the tissue samples were estimated
spectrophotometrically at 535 nm wavelength. The
1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane (1­10 nmol) was used as
standard. The results of TBARS were expressed as nmol of
malondialdehyde/mg of protein.
Estimation of reduced GSH content. The tissue GSH con-
tent was estimated using the method described by of
Beutler et al.45 Briefly, 0.5 ml tissue homogenate was
mixed with 2 ml of (0.3 M) disodium hydrogen phos-
phate solution and 0.25 ml of (0.001 M) freshly prepared
DTNB solution. This reaction gave yellow chromogen in
the presence of GSH. The absorbance changes in the tis-
sue samples were estimated spectrophotometrically at
412 nm wavelength. The GSH (10­100 mol) was used
as standard. The results of GSH were expressed as g of
GSH/mg of protein.
Experimental protocol
Nine groups, each comprising six Swiss mice were
employed in the present study.
106 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(1)
Group I (normal control). Mice were not subjected to any
surgical procedure and were kept for 14 consecutive
days. The nociceptive threshold was assessed at differ-
ent time intervals: 0, 1, 3, 7 and 14 days. All of the ani-
mals were sacrificed on the fourteenth day and
biochemical estimations (i.e. total protein, TBARS and
reduced GSH level) were performed in the sciatic nerve
tissue sample.
Group II (sham control). Mice were subjected to the surgical
procedure to expose the right sciatic nerve without any
nerve ligation to differentiate the nerve mediated pain
from CCI group. Behavioral and biochemical evaluations
were carried out as described in group I.
Group III (CCI). Mice were subjected to the surgical proce-
dure to expose and ligate the right sciatic nerve. The pro-
cedure was described in an earlier section. Behavioral and
biochemical evaluations were carried out as described in
group I.
Group IV (CCI + vehicle). After performing the chronic con-
striction injury of the sciatic nerve, vehicle (25 ml/kg of
0.5% carboxy methyl cellulose) was administered orally
for 14 consecutive days from day 0. Behavioral and bio-
chemical evaluations were carried out as described in
group I.
GroupV andVI (ramipril per se and pregabalin per se).Mice
were subjected to the administration of ramipril (4 mg/kg,
p.o.) and pregabalin (10 mg/kg, p.o.) for 14 consecutive
days respectively. Behavioral and biochemical evaluations
were carried out as described in group I.
GroupVII andVIII (ramipril treatment). Mice were subjected
to the administration of ramipril (2 and 4 mg/kg, p.o.) for
14 consecutive days respectively. Behavioral and bio-
chemical evaluations were carried out as described in
group I.
Group IX (pregabalin treatment).Mice were subjected to
the administration of pregabalin (10 mg/kg, p.o.) for 14
consecutive days respectively. Behavioral and biochemi-
cal evaluations were carried out as described in group 1.
This group served as positive control for the study of neu-
ropathic pain.
Statistical analysis
All of the results were expressed as mean ± standard devia-
tion (SD). Data obtained from behavioral tests were statis-
tically analyzed using two-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Bonferonni's post hoc analysis,
applied by using Graph pad prism Version 5.0 software.
The data of tissue biomarkers, i.e. TBARS and GSH
levels, were analyzed using one-way ANOVA -followed
by Tukey's multiple range tests, applied for post hoc anal-
ysis by using Sigmastat Version 3.5 software.Aprobability
value of P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.
Results
Effect of ramipril on plantar test
CCI of the sciatic nerve resulted in a significant develop-
ment of thermal hyperalgesia as indicated by a decrease in
right hind paw withdrawal threshold when compared to the
sham control group. Administration of ramipril (2 and 4

mal nociceptive pain threshold in a dose-dependent man-
ner. Treatment of pregabalin also produced similar effects.
However, vehicle and ramipril per se treated group did not
show any significant (P < 0.05) changes in CCI-induced
thermal hyperalgesia (Figure 1).
Effect of ramipril on pin prick test
CCI of sciatic nerve resulted in a significant development
of mechanical hyperalgesia as indicated by an increase in
the percentage withdrawal of right hind paw when com-
pared with the sham control group. Administration of
ramipril (2 and 4 mg/kg, p.o.) attenuated CCI-induced
increase in the mechanical nociceptive pain threshold in
a dose-dependent manner. Treatment of pregabalin also
produced similar effects. However, vehicle and ramipril
per se treated group did not show any significant (P <

control group. Administration of ramipril (2 and 4 mg/kg,
p.o.) attenuated CCI-induced decrease in the thermal noci-
ceptive pain threshold in a dose-dependent manner.
Treatment of pregabalin also produced similar effects.
However, vehicle and ramipril per se treated group did not
show any significant (P < 0.05) changes in CCI-induced
thermal hyperalgesia (Figure 3).
Effect of ramipril on tail pinch test
CCI of sciatic nerve resulted in a significant develop-
ment of mechanical hyperalgesia as indicated by an

Effect of ramipril on rota rod test
CCI of the sciatic nerve resulted in a significant develop-
ment of motor in-coordination as indicated by a decrease
in the fall off time from the rotating rod when compared
with the sham control group. Administration of ramipril (2
and 4 mg/kg, p.o.) attenuated CCI-induced decrease in the
motor impairment in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment

coordination (Figure 5).
Effect of ramipril on tissue biomarker changes

changes of tissue biomarkers in a dose-dependent manner.
Treatment of pregabalin also produced similar effects.
However, vehicle and ramipril per se treated group did not
show any significant (P < 0.05) changes in CCI-induced
tissue biomarker changes (Table 1).
Discussion
In the present study, CCI of the sciatic nerve in mice has
produced a significant increase in thermal and mechanical
hyperalgesia and impairment of motor in-coordination
along with various biochemical alterations (i.e. rise in
TBARS and decrease in reduced glutathione content).
Administration of ACE inhibitor, i.e. ramipril (2 and 4 mg/
Kg, p.o.) significantly attenuated CCI-induced behavioral
and biochemical changes.
The chronic constriction injury model is the most
commonly employed neuropathic pain model36,46 which
clinically resembles complex regional pain syndrome.42,47

110 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(1)
Various pathological mechanisms and targets are explored
in the development of CRPS in humans as well as experi-
mental animals.9 A recent study reported that RAAS
plays a critical role in the management of neuropathic
pain disorders,17,19,21 as RAAS activation is due to the
peripheral nerve injury associated with sympathetic out-
flow in secondary and tertiary neurons at spinal cord and
dorsal root ganglion.11,14 RAAS mediated release of
excess angiotensin II is a major culprit in the develop-
ment of neuropathic pain sensitivity via angiotensin I and
angiotensin II receptors.17,20 Recent reports show that
angiotensin I receptor blockers, i.e. telmisartan, produce
an ameliorative effect against CCI-induced neuropathic
pain.48 The same study revealed that the molecular mech-
anism of telmisartan includes its direct or secondary
effects (partial agonist of peroxisome-proliferator-acti-
vated-receptor-gamma) independent of angiotensin I
receptor blockade actions.48 The formation of angioten-
sin II is due to activity of ACE on angiotensin I.
Angiotensin II potentially induces the formation of free
radicals associated lipid peroxidation16,49 and neuro-
inflammation.50 ACE inhibitors are well documented in
the production of anti-inflammatory action by reduction
of angiotensin II formation.51,52 Angiotensin II exerted an
anti-nociceptive effect at the variable time points but
generally it has high pain sensitivity, because the pain
attenuating effect is in a diurnal pattern (24 h light and
dark cycles). At phasic pain (dark cycle), it exerted an
anti-nociceptive effect, whereas in tonic pain (light
cycle), it exerted weak circadian fluctuation of the num-
ber of pain responses in mice.53 Angiotensin II has pain
control effects;54 in contrast, angiotensin II causes the
nociceptive pain which is ameliorated by angiotensin 1­7
(AT1-7
) peptide via inhibition of Mas receptors associated
p38 MAPK phosphorylation in mice.55 However, the clin-
ically available medicine for AT2
R antagonists is not
available yet. AT2
R antagonists may be available for
chronic pain management in the future.56 In addition, the
rationale of ACE inhibitors increases the pain sensitivity,
because it not only produces inhibition of ACE activity,
but also inactivates the opioid peptide [Leu5]enkephalin in
the rat,57 whereas the treatment of ramipril reported to
have beneficial effects on glucose-fed induced sensory
polyneuropathy in rats via down regulation of pro-nocic-
eptive kinin B1
receptors.58
Furthermore, Ang III as well as Ang IV is biologically
active and formed from angiotensin II via ACE activity.
But the effect of these have not yet been fully elucidated for
the cardiovascular, renal system and neuropathic pain.59,60
The rise in the level of angiotensin II and their receptors,
i.e. angiotensin I receptor and angiotensin II receptor, is
responsible in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain in
experimental animals and in humans.19,20,61 Angiotensin IV
is a metabolite of angiotensin II, which acts on specific
angiotensin IV receptors, mainly responsible for improving
cognitive dysfunction.62 The role of angiotensin IV remains
to be explored in neuropathic pain disorders. ACE inhibi-
tors are responsible for the reduction of blood pressure and
neuroprotective action.52 The elevation of blood pressure
has been reported to produce a reduction in pain sensitivity.
The over activation of the RAAS is responsible for the rise
in blood pressure, but the role in neuropathic pain has not
been explored yet. In the present study, the peripheral nerve
injury leads to activate supra-spinal sympathetic tone which
in turn causes over activation of the RAAS and releases
pro-nociceptive peptides (i.e. angiotensin II). In addition,
treatment of ACE inhibitor (Delapril) in spontaneously
hypertensive rats (SHR), induces the pain sensitivity and
decreases sympathetic tone via two preliminary actions: (a)
ACE inhibition; and (b) decrease the endogenous opioid
peptide,63 whereas the treatment of ramipril improves the
autonomic control by reduction of sympathetic tone but is
not reported to have an effect on endogenous opioid pep-
tide levels.64 Ramipril is one of the major drugs used as an
ACE inhibitor, which also produces neuroprotection by
free radical scavenging and anti-inflammatory actions.65,66
The present result also revealed neuroprotective action by
the attenuation of CCI-induced rise in TBARS and decrease
in reduced glutathione content along with various periph-
eral and central pain parameters. Ramipril is a prodrug
(active form is ramiprilat) for ACE inhibition. It is a lipo-
philic drug that crosses the blood­brain barrier. However, it
does not act on somatic ACE (membrane bound) for degra-
dation of central neuropeptides.67 Ramiprilat penetrates
from the blood into the CSF which inhibits the activity of
soluble ACE at the spinal cord region.68,69 Therefore, neu-
ropathic pain parameters have assessed on the peripheral
site (paw pain sensitivity response) as well as in the central
site (tail pain sensitivity response).
It may be concluded that ramipril has the potential ame-
liorating role in CCI induced thermal and mechanical
hyperalgesia in mice. This action is due to the potential of
anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory actions via reduction
of angiotensin II. Therefore, ACE inhibition may be a
newer potential target in the management of neuropathic
pain disorders.
