Introduction
Marriage age which also refers to age at first marriage
(Dommaraju, 2008) is an important proximate determinant
of fertility (Bongaarts, 1978) and indeed has not only been
linked with demographic change in many parts of Europe
and North America where fertility has stabilized at low lev-
els, but has also been identified as one of the causes of high
fertility level in developing countries of Africa and Asia
where the practice of early marriage remain widespread
(Clifton & Frost, 2011; Garenne, 2004; Guilbert, 2013;
Haloi, 2014; Head, Zweimueller, Marchena, & Hoel, 2014;
Kyari & Ayodele, 2014). Though childbearing outside mari-
tal unions is prevalent worldwide, the greatest proportions of
childbearing occur within marital unions (Acharya, 2010).
The recognition of this fact has often been the basis for
devising initiatives to encourage rise in age at first marriage
as one of the means of redressing high fertility in many
developing countries (World Health Organization [WHO],
2011). Evidence abounds that populations with higher age at
first marriage have on the average low fertility level
(Dommaraju, 2008; Sathar & Kiani, 1998). This is made pos-
sible by higher ability to exercise more control over repro-
ductive decisions including decisions about childbearing,
improved educational attainment, and enhanced economic
capacities of populations that delay first marriage (Population
Reference Bureau [PRB], 2007).
Following the rise to prominence of gender equality and
women's empowerment in global population and health dis-
courses after the 1994 Cairo International Conference on
Population and Development, initiatives to raise age at first
marriage has been linked with agitations for improvement in
women's empowerment (UNICEF, 2005). Women's empow-
erment refers to the process of providing women with greater
access to vital resources such as education, employment, and
health care for the purpose of increasing their ability to con-
trol their own affairs and to reduce women's domination by
men. It is widely believed that by delaying marriage, several
hundreds of thousands of young girls will acquire improved
education which will make them to understand and demand
for basic human rights and participation in the workforce
(USAID, 2012), thus likely to cause change in their fertility
desire and ultimately their fertility behavior. There is there-
fore a nexus among age at first marriage, fertility behavior,
and women's empowerment. However, in spite of several
studies focusing on women's empowerment and fertility-
related issues (Acharya, 2010; Raj, Saggurti, Balaiah, &
Silverman, 2009; Riyami, 2003; Salam, 2013; Sivasankaran,
2014; Upadhyay & Karasek, 2010; Upadhyay etal., 2014;
Wado, 2013) insufficient attempts have been made to simul-
taneously explore the relationship between age at first mar-
riage and fertility behavior on the one hand and women's
empowerment on the other hand. This study tries to fill this
gap by exploring whether age at first marriage is related to
fertility behavior and women's empowerment. It is important

Marriage Age, Fertility Behavior, and
Women's Empowerment in Nigeria
Bola Lukman SOLANKE1
Abstract
This study examines the relationship between age at first marriage and women's fertility behavior and empowerment. Data
were extracted from the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey. The Poisson regression and multinomial logistic
regression were applied using Stata version 12. Results show that the incident rate of children ever born for women aged
15 to 19 years is less than the incident rate of children ever born for women aged 14 years or less (incident rate ratios =
0.8177, p < .01), and that the relative risk of being in high empowerment category instead of moderate category will increase
by a factor of 2.0988 for those aged 15 to 19 years at first marriage compared with those aged 14 years or less. Age at first
marriage is significantly related to women's fertility behavior and empowerment.

to examine the inter relatedness of age at first marriage, fer-
tility behavior, and women's empowerment in Nigeria
because in spite of being the most populous country in
Africa, implementation of population and gender policies
(such as the 2004 National Population Policy for Sustainable
Development and 2006 National Gender Policy) are yet to
achieve significant fertility reduction and improvement in
women's empowerment in the country. The specific objec-
tives of the study are to describe the patterns of age at first
marriage, fertility behavior, and women empowerment by
the geo-political zones in Nigeria; and examine the relation-
ship between age at first marriage and fertility behavior. In
addition, the study examines the relationship between age at
first marriage and women's empowerment in Nigeria.
Theoretical Framework
Liberal feminist theory provides the theoretical underpin-
ning of the current study. Liberal feminism aims at improv-
ing all round gender equality and empowerment by
encouraging women's access to public institutions and
bringing women's issues to the fore of national discourse
(Walter, 1998). These are to be achieved through educa-
tional reforms and enactment of appropriate legislations not
only to bridge the state of inequality between men and
women, but to also change community norms and beliefs
about early marriage as already been achieved in countries
such as Cambodia, Nepal, and Rwanda (Head etal., 2014).
In Nigeria, women and girls have unequal economic, social,
and political opportunities with men in the country (British
Council, 2012). This is made possible and sustained by
Nigeria's socio-cultural system that not only promotes
women's subordinate position, but also sustains inequality
in decision-making positions in government (Omoluabi,
Aina, & Attanasso, 2014). In addition, several harmful prac-
tices including gender-based violence, female genital cut-
ting, early and forced marriages, widow inheritance, and so
on, are common in the country (National Population
Commission [NPC], 2004). However, in the last two
decades, national attention to the plight of women has
steadily increased in the country. Numerous gender activ-
ists, civil society groups, and women-centered organizations
have not only stepped up advocacy for women's rights, they
have also established a National Coalition on Affirmative
Action (NCAA) to champion agitation for the domestication
of United Nation's Convention on the Elimination of all
Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). The
government of Nigeria has positively responded to the agi-
tations by adhering to the Beijing Platform of Action that
demands that women fill at least 35% of all political posts
(NPC and ICF Macro, 2009). Though, achieving this target
for elective positions in the country seems to be unattainable
in the present dispensation, the social position of women in
the country is likely to improve steadily with sustained edu-
cation for young girls and women.
Method
Data Sources
The data for this study were extracted from the 2013
Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS). The
2013 NDHS is the fifth Demographic and Health Survey
implemented in the country. It is a nationally representa-
tive survey that provides valid information on basic demo-
graphic and health indices such as fertility, marriage,
family planning, adult and childhood mortality, domestic
violence, and HIV/AIDS (NPC and ICF International,
2014). The data were accessed online through the website
of MEASURE DHS following the submission of abstract
giving details of the study objective. We analyzed the
women data set focusing on a weighted sample size of
19,397 women having excluded women who were never
married (9,820 women), women who have never had a live
birth (9,474 women), and women who were widowed,
divorced, and separated (1,854 women).
Variable Description and Measures
The outcome variables in the study are fertility behavior and
women's empowerment. Fertility behavior was measured by
children ever born, current contraceptive use, pregnancy ter-
mination, and desire for more children. However, only chil-
dren ever born were used to proxy fertility behavior at the
bivariate and multivariate levels of statistical analyses. This
was done because children ever born has been widely used as
a measure of fertility behavior (Acharya, 2010; Sathar &
Kiani, 1998). Women's empowerment was measured in the
study using level of women's autonomy and education.
Women's autonomy was derived from responses to questions
on control of household decisions, namely who has the final
say on own health care, purchase of large items, and visit to
friends and relatives? Responses to these questions were
coded in the NDHS as follows: respondents alone, respon-
dents and husband, husband alone, someone else, and others.
Dummy variables for each of these response domains were
created by categorizing the responses into three, namely low,
moderate, and high autonomy. The three categories used in
the study differs from the two categories usually found in
DHS studies (Kishor & Subaiya, 2008; Upadhyay & Karasek,
2010; Wado, 2013) to reflect increasing singlehood among
women in Nigeria (Chizomam & Isiugo-Abanihe, 2014).
For each domain, the variable is coded 1 if respondents
have no say in the decision, 2 if respondent jointly take deci-
sion with husband/partner, and 3 if respondent take decision
alone. Women's educational attainment was equally catego-
rized into three groups, namely, low, moderate, and high.
Respondents who attained none and primary education were
categorized as having "low education," those who attained
secondary education as having "moderate education," and
those who attained higher education as having "high educa-
tion." A composite indicator of women empowerment was
SOLANKE 3
then generated by combining level of autonomy and educa-
tion. This indicator was categorized into low, moderate, and
high empowerment: women who report low autonomy and
low education indicating low empowerment, women who
report moderate autonomy and education indicating moder-
ate empowerment, and high autonomy and education indicat-
ing high empowerment.
The key explanatory variable is age at first marriage
grouped into four age intervals of 14 years or less, 15 to 19
years, 20 to 24 years, and 25 years and above. Other explana-
tory variables include selected socio-economic characteris-
tics (wealth quintile, place of residence, employment status,
religious affiliation and region). The relationships between
the explanatory and outcome variables were mediated by
barriers to health care and access to mass media. Health care
is an important resource for empowerment with women
experiencing barriers to timely and appropriate health care
having less likelihood of empowerment (Head etal., 2014).
Barriers to health care were generated by combining wom-
en's responses on whether money, distance, and husband per-
mission constitute hindrance to health care. Access to mass
media was generated using the frequency of reading newspa-
per, listening to radio, and watching television. Women who
did not read newspapers, listened to radio, or watch televi-
sion indicated women with "no" access to mass media.
Women who read newspaper, listen to radio, or watch televi-
sion less than once a week indicated women with "low"
access to mass media, whereas those whose frequency of
reading newspaper, listening to radio, or watching television
was at least once a week indicated women with "moderate"
access to mass media.
Data Analysis
Stata version 12 was used to perform statistical analyses
which commenced after applying standardized sample
weights (StatCorp, 2009). Frequency table was used to
describe sample characteristics, patterns of marriage age,
fertility behavior, and women's empowerment across the
geo-political zones of the country. Two multivariate tech-
niques were used to examine the relationship between the
research variables. The justification for this relates to the dif-
ferent nature of the outcome variables. The Poisson regres-
sion was performed to examine the relationship between age
at first marriage and children ever born. The Poisson regres-
sion is particularly suitable for regressing dependent variable
on independent variables when the dependent variable is a
non negative count variable (StatCorp, 2009) such as chil-
dren ever born used to proxy fertility behavior in the current
study. Results of the Poisson regression are presented in the
study as the incident rate ratios (irr) which estimate the inci-
dence of children ever born in a given category relative to the
reference category. The Poisson regression was replicated in
three models. Model 1 included only age at first marriage.
Model 2 controls for the socio-economic factors whereas
Model 3 controls for the mediating factors. Models 2 and 3
were constructed to determine whether inclusion of other
variables in the model will alter the relationship between age
at first marriage and children ever born.
The multinomial logistic regression was performed to
examine the relationship between age at first marriage and
empowerment. The multinomial logistic regression is not
only appropriate for analysis in the current study because it is
mainly applicable to the analysis of discrete dependent vari-
ables when the dependent variable has more than two nomi-
nal or unordered categories (Bayaga, 2010; StatCorp, 2009),
it is also increasingly being used in the analysis of social
issues (El-Habil, 2012; Peng & Nichols, 2003). In the current
study, the multinomial logistic regression was replicated in
three models with moderate empowerment as base outcome.
Model 1 included only age at first marriage, Model 2 con-
trols for the mediating factors, whereas Model 3 controls for
the socio-economic factors. The relative risk ratios (rrr) are
used in the study to report the estimated coefficients of the
multinomial model. This measures the risk of low or high
empowerment relative to moderate empowerment.
Results
This section presented results that were generated from the
study. Table 1 presents description of sample characteristics.
More than one fifth of the women were either in the "poor-
est" or "poorer" ladder of the wealth groups. The distribu-
tions of women in other wealth categories were nearly equal.
For instance, the same proportions of women were in the
"richer" and "richest" categories. The highest proportions of
the women reside in rural areas while slightly more than one
third of the women reside in urban areas. More than two
thirds of the women were currently employed, whereas less
than one third of them were unemployed. Muslim women
were dominant among the respondents. More than one third
of the respondents were Christians, whereas an insignificant
proportion was adherents of traditional or other faiths. The
highest proportion of the women did not report any barrier to
health care. However, slightly less than one tenth of the
women had at least one barrier to accessing health care.
About one third of the women had no access to mass media;
slightly more than one fifth had low access to mass media,
whereas nearly half of the women had moderate access to
mass media. Women in the north-west zone of the country
were dominant in the sample. The three zones in the northern
region constitute more than two thirds of the sample com-
pared with less than one third in the three southern zones of
the country.
Table 2 presents result of patterns of marriage age, fertil-
ity behavior, and women's empowerment across the geo-
political zones in the country. Slightly more than a quarter of
the women married at age 14 years or less with highest pro-
portion of early marriages occurring in the north-western
zone of the country. However, the dominant age interval at
4 SAGE Open
first marriage across the country is 15 to 19 years. The pro-
portions of first marriages occurring at 25 years or above
were higher in the southern region and lowest in the northern
region. The mean number of children ever born was highest
in the north-western zone compared with other zones in the
country.
As indicated in Table 2, contraceptive use among married
women is poor in Nigeria. Only 15.7% of the respondents
were currently using at least one method of modern contra-
ception; however, use of modern contraceptives were much
better in the three southern zones compared with its preva-
lence in northern zone. Pregnancy termination experiences
were more prevalent in southern region particularly in the
south-eastern and south-western zones, which incidentally
are the two zones with higher contraceptive prevalence.
Desire for more children were higher in north-eastern and
north-western zones compared with other zones in the coun-
try. Result of levels of empowerment provide evidence of
low level of women's empowerment particularly in northern
parts of the country. The highest level of empowerment was
found in south-western zone compared with the lowest level
of empowerment in the north-western zone.
Table 3 presents result of Poisson regression. In the three
models constructed, age at first marriage is significantly
related to children ever born. In Model 1, the incident rate of
children ever born for women aged 15 to 19 years at first
marriage is less than the incident rate of children ever born
for women aged 14 years or less (irr = 0.8177, p < .01).
Likewise, the incident rate of children ever born for women
aged 20 to 24 years is less than the incident rate of children
ever born for the reference group holding the other variables
constant (irr = 0.6855, p < .01). When the socio-economic
factors were included in Model 2, age at first marriage
remains significantly related to children ever born. The inci-
dent rate of children ever born reduces consistently as age at
first marriage increases from the reference category to
higher ages given the other variables are held constant in the
model. In the model, the incident rate of children ever born
reduces consistently as household wealth index improves
from the reference category to other wealth groups. For
instance, the incident rate of children ever born among
women in the middle wealth group is less than the incident
rate of children ever born among women in the reference
category (irr = 0.8994, p < .01). Likewise, the incident rate
of children ever born among unemployed women increases
compared with the incident rate of children ever born among
employed women (irr = 1.275, p < .01) holding the other
variables constant.
When the mediating factors were included in Model 3
while controlling for the socio-economic factors, age at
first marriage remain associated with children ever born.
In the model, the incident rates of children ever born were
less for women with higher age at first marriage compared
with the reference category. Also, the incident rate of chil-
dren ever born reduces for women with low and moderate
access to mass media compared with the incident rate of
children ever born among women with no access to mass
media.
Table 4 presents result of the multinomial logistic regres-
sion. In the three models constructed, age at first marriage
shows significant relationship with empowerment. In Model
1, the relative risk of being in high empowerment category
instead of moderate category will increase by a factor of
2.0988 for those aged 15 to 19 years at first marriage com-
pared with those aged 14 years or less. When age at first mar-
riage increased to 20 to 24 years, the relative risk of being in
high empowerment category instead of moderate category
will increase by a factor of 6.5759. Likewise, the relative risk
of being in high empowerment category instead of moderate
category will increase by a factor of 17.5017 for those aged
25 years and above compared with those aged 14 years or
less. The inclusion of socio-economic characteristics of
respondents in Model 2 did not change the nature of the rela-
tionship between age at first marriage and empowerment.

The relative risk of being in high empowerment category
instead of moderate category will increase by a factor of
1.8374 for those aged 20 to 24 years at first marriage com-
pared with those aged 14 years or less. When age at first
marriage increased to 25 years and above, the relative risk of
being in high empowerment category instead of moderate
category will increase by a factor of 3.4416. All the selected
socio-economic characteristics were associated with empow-
erment. For instance, while the relative risk of being in high
empowerment category instead of moderate empowerment
will increase by a factor of 1.6553 for urban women com-
pared with rural women, the relative risk of being in high
empowerment category instead of moderate empowerment
will reduce by a factor of 0.9841 for unemployed women
compared with employed women.
In Model 3, barriers to health care are the only variable
not significantly related to empowerment. In the model, the
relative risk of being in high empowerment category instead
of moderate category will increase by a factor of 1.8037 for
those aged 15 to 19 years at first marriage compared with
those aged 14 years or less. When age at first marriage
increased to 25 years and above, the relative risk of being in
high empowerment category instead of moderate category
will increase by a factor of 11.5911. Also, the relative risk of

being in high empowerment category instead of moderate
category will increase by a factor of 2.3881 for women with
low access to mass media and by a factor of 4.1472 for
women with moderate access to mass media compared with
those with no access to mass media. In virtually all the three
models constructed for low empowerment, the relationship
between age at first marriage and empowerment was not sta-
tistically significant.
Discussion
This study explored the relationship between age at first mar-
riage and fertility behavior on the one hand and between age
at first marriage and women's empowerment on the other
hand. Four major findings emerged from our analyses. First,
early marriage is dominant in northern Nigeria. This is con-
sistent with the finding by Kyari and Ayodele (2014). Early
marriage violates the rights of young girls to education and
economic opportunities, but undermines their ability to
advance socially and politically (USAID, 2012). The prac-
tice of early marriage thrives in the region for two basic rea-
sons such as an accepted cultural practice in the region and
parents and guardians of young girls derive economic gains
from marrying young girls by receiving dowry payment or
relief from paying school fees on the girl child (UNICEF,
2005). Both concerns must be fully addressed by social pro-
grams to change attitudes in the region. Governments in the
region can develop programs that not only enforce universal
basic education, but also provide economic incentives to par-
ents and guardians who enrolled their female children in
either primary or secondary school.
Second, there were differentials in fertility behavior
among southern and northern women. On the one hand,
women in north-eastern and north-western zones of the
country had higher fertility compared with their southern
counterparts. This results tends to support previous higher

fertility reported in northern Nigeria compared with the
southern parts of the country (NPC and ICF Macro, 2009;
NPC and ICF International, 2014). On the other hand, women
in southern Nigeria had higher prevalence of modern contra-
ceptive use than women in northern zone. It is however wor-
thy to note that in spite of higher prevalence of contraceptive
use in southern Nigeria, higher proportions of women in the
region have experienced pregnancy termination compared
with their northern counterparts. This is worrisome because
despite sustained advocacy for reform of the abortion law in
Nigeria, pregnancy termination remained highly restricted
under the Nigerian legal system (Oye-Adeniran, Long, &
Adewole, 2004). Two reasons may account for the finding on
pregnancy termination among the sampled women. On the
one hand, it is plausible to reason that women in northern
Nigeria are more interested in childbearing than southern
women. This is shown in the result of desire for more chil-
dren among the respondents. On the other hand, it is not cer-
tain whether women in southern Nigeria do not take
pregnancy termination as a means of fertility control. Both
possibilities suggest urgent need to scale up not only access
to modern contraceptives in the country, but also devising
more initiatives to boost its use among women in marital
unions.
Third, significant relationship exists between age at first
marriage and fertility behavior. Younger age at first marriage
connotes early exposure to regular sexual intercourse which
will ultimately translate into early childbearing in the absence
of effective contraceptive (WHO, 2011). In consonance with
findings in Sathar and Kiani (1998), Dommaraju (2008), Raj
etal. (2009), Acharya (2010), and Haloi (2014) women who
start childbearing early have on the long run more number of

children which may even extend beyond their desired level if
they fail to use contraceptives or use it consistently. Fourth,
significant relationship exists between age at first marriage
and women's empowerment with younger age at first mar-
riage being associated with low level of empowerment. It is
plausible to assume that women who delay marriage till
older ages will have higher empowerment because in most
cases most of the women delaying marriage were mostly
attending educational institutions or actively engaged in the
labor force. These findings indicate that significant change in
fertility behavior as well as women's empowerment can be
achieved if age at first marriage is delayed.
In Nigeria, raising age at first marriage to at least 18 years
for females was recognized in the 2004 National Population
Policy as a strategy to improving the empowerment and
reproductive health of girls and women; however, the strat-
egy has not received meticulous commitment from the
national legislatures due to cultural diversity in the country.
Opposition to enactment of a minimum age at first marriage
has remained stiff in northern Nigeria where early and some-
times forced marriages are more prevalent.As found in Kyari
and Ayodele (2014), the prevalence of early marriage in
northern Nigeria has serious socio-economic implications.
Early marriage in the region denied many girls the opportu-
nities of acquiring basic education and developing their tal-
ents. This is compounded by subsequent high fertility that
further hinders their economic productivity and empower-
ment. It is therefore important that a nationwide program
providing empirical evidence of the age at first marriage, fer-
tility, and empowerment nexus should be designed and
implemented in the country. This will go a long way in mobi-
lizing for the enactment and enforcement of legislation to
eliminate early marriage in the country.
With increasing women's education and advocacy by
women's groups and in line with the assertion of Liberal
feminists, a number of positive steps have been taken in the
country to bridge gender gap and empower women in the
country. One of such steps is the design and implementation
of the 2006 National Gender Policy. The policy seeks to
build a just society through promoting the realization of the
full potentials of both men and women in the country (FMWA
& SD, 2006). The policy has now been implemented for
nearly a decade, but still far away from achieving set objec-
tives. Though the policy sought to mainstream the principles
of CEDAW into the country's legal and administrative sys-
tems, no programs have been designed to build the capacity
of legislatures to uphold a minimum age at marriage across
the country.
Conclusion
This study concluded that age at first marriage has signifi-
cant relationship with women's fertility behavior and
empowerment. The enactment and enforcement of legisla-
tion to eliminate early marriage will impact positively on
fertility reduction and women's empowerment in the coun-
try. Inference made in this study is limited by inability to
establish a cause­effect relationship between age at first
marriage and the outcome variables.
