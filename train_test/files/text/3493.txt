Introduction
Understanding factors that prevent negative health out-
comes or increase motivation to change are crucial goals
for behavior-change research and application. To this end,
many social-cognitive theories of health behavior, such as
the Health Belief Model (Janz and Becker, 1984) or
Protection Motivation Theory (Rogers, 1975), propose that
cognitions motivate action. One such cognition, perceived
risk, is commonly measured as perceptions of susceptibility
to illness. To reduce the perceived threat, greater risk per-
ceptions of a health threat (e.g. heart disease) are purported
to predict stronger intentions to engage in a behavior (e.g.
smoking cessation) as well as the behavior itself. Meta-
analyses on the association of perceived risk with inten-
tions and behavior suggest relatively small but reliable
effects supporting the theoretical suppositions (Brewer
etal., 2007; Floyd etal., 2000; McCaul etal., 1996).
Social-cognitive models emphasize the deliberative and
reflective processes underlying decision-making. However,
dual-process models of decision-making suggest important
distinctions between this type of reasoning (i.e. the
analytical system) and processes that are experiential and
reflexive (i.e. the experiential system), the latter of which
can be emotionally laden (Slovic etal., 2005). Thus, con-
sideration of the feelings regarding risk are also important
for health decision-making (Loewenstein etal., 2001) and
may independently contribute to motivation and behavior
change (Slovic etal., 2004). While distinct systems, they
work together to influence decision-making (Slovic etal.,
2005) suggesting cognitive and affective components of
health behavior should be considered jointly.
One feeling associated with risk is worry--an anticipa-
tory negative emotion experienced when thinking about
future events (e.g. developing cancer in the future due to

Abstract
This research examined main and interactive associations of perceived risk and worry of health and appearance smoking
consequences on motivation to quit and the relative importance of each of these. Hierarchical regressions controlling for
other measures found that perceived conditional risk and worry of health consequences were associated with motivation
to quit; only conditional risk of appearance consequences was associated with motivation to quit. Relative weights
analysis indicated that perceived conditional risk of appearance consequences and worry about health consequences
were the most important variables in the model. Consideration of appearance consequences may aid in motivating
smokers to try quitting.

one's smoking; Loewenstein etal., 2001). In this way, it
can be conceived as "thought colored by affect" (McCaul
etal., 2007). Worry about health consequences has been
associated with motivation to quit smoking (Koblitz etal.,
2009; Magnan etal., 2009), intentions to engage in various
health behaviors (Janssen etal., 2014; Klein etal., 2009;
Schmiege etal., 2009), and health behaviors themselves
(Dijkstra and Brosschot, 2003; Hay etal., 2006; McCaul
etal., 2007). Moreover, when considered in tandem, worry
often shows effects over and above effects of perceived risk
on behavioral outcomes (Chapman and Coups, 2006; Ferrer
etal., 2013; Magnan etal., 2009; Portnoy etal., 2014b).
Additionally, perceived risk and worry are moderately
related--while they share characteristics, they are distinct
constructs (Janssen et
al., 2011; McCaul and Mullens,
2003). It is possible to perceive an outcome as likely but not
worry much about it (e.g. flu) or to perceive an outcome as
unlikely but worry a great deal about it (e.g. breast
cancer).
Both perceived risk and worry may have independent as
well as interactive effects on motivating health behaviors.
That is, they may work together in a way that results in bet-
ter or worse health decisions. Some investigations have
found a somewhat paradoxical effect such that among those
with high worry and high risk perceptions, motivation for
health-promoting behaviors is lower. Such an effect has
been observed for engaging in physical exercise and con-
suming fruits/vegetables (Ferrer etal., 2013), intentions to
quit smoking (Klein etal., 2009), and greater avoidance of
practitioner visits among older adults (Persoskie et
al.,
2014). However, others have found no evidence for an
interactive effect on the likelihood of six types of cancer
screening behaviors (Moser et
al., 2007). Additionally,
Portnoy et
al. (2014b) found the pattern of interactive
effects on intentions to exercise among individuals with
Type II diabetes varied by how perceived risk was
measured.
The operationalization of perceived risk may help to
explain the lack of consensus on the interactive effects of
perceived risk and worry on health decisions. Most meas-
ures of perceived risk are "absolute" in that they ask an
individual to assess their personal risk. Personal risk can be
further delineated as unconditional or conditional.
Unconditional measures evaluate the probability of an
event without specifying one's future behavior ("How
likely are you to get lung cancer?"). Conditional measures
evaluate the probability of an event depending on one's
behavior ("How likely are you to get lung cancer if you
continue to smoke?"). Risk measures may also be compar-
ative, evaluating the probability of an event relative to simi-
lar others ("Compared to other smokers your age, how
likely are you to get lung cancer?"). These different meas-
ures may influence the apparent strength of the relationship
between perceived risk and motivation for health behavior
(Dillard et
al., 2012). For example, conditional risk
estimates may be stronger predictors of behavior than
unconditional measures (Brewer etal., 2007; Janssen etal.,
2011; Ronis, 1992; Van der Velde etal., 1996).Additionally,
comparative risk perceptions may be more strongly associ-
ated with worry than absolute risk (Lipkus etal., 2005;
Zajac etal., 2006). This variation in outcomes has led some
to recommend the inclusion of both absolute and compara-
tive assessments when measuring risk perceptions due to
their distinct influence on intentions and behavior (Zajac
etal., 2006).
Another consideration of measurement of risk is that the
focus is typically on long-term health outcomes. However,
a small but growing body of the literature suggests that
focusing on other risks such as social (Halpern-Felsher
etal., 2004) or appearance consequences (Flett etal., 2013)
could also discourage smoking, particularly among youth
and young adults. For example, Grogan etal. (2011) found
that female smokers exposed to a personalized visual aging
trial reported greater intentions to quit in comparison to
those in a standard care condition. Moreover, certain
appearance consequences of smoking may even promote
continued smoking (e.g. concerns about weight gain;
Perkins etal., 1997). In contrast to long-term health conse-
quences, appearance consequences have a relatively shorter
time to onset--they typically develop faster and thus may
be more salient. The argument that many smokers use to
rationalize continued use (i.e. I'll quit before my smoking
makes me sick) may not hold when confronted with more
immediate appearance consequences of their behavior
(Grogan etal., 2010). A small number of studies focus on
the potential for enhancing appearance-related smoking
consequences to motivate behavior change (see Flett etal.,
2013 for review), but none of this work to date has assessed
how perceptions of appearance risks "measure up" to
health-related measures of risk and the extent to which they
are associated with motivation to quit smoking. From an
applied perspective, understanding the conditions under
which perceived risk and worry are associated with motiva-
tion to quit could aid the development of more effective
risk communications, provide an alternative to reduce
habituation to well-known health messages, or identify
variables for developing interventions.
This study addresses the connections of perceived risk
and worry with motivation to quit among smokers. This
study is unique in that the relationship of perceived risk
and worry on motivation to quit will be tested for both
health and appearance consequences of smoking. The
first aim is to test the independent and interactive effects
of perceived risk and worry on motivation to quit. In
keeping with theoretical perspectives (e.g. Loewenstein
etal., 2001; Slovic et al., 2005) and previous work (e.g.
Dillard et
al., 2012; Magnan et
al., 2009), I predicted
similar patterns for health consequence and appearance
consequence measures such that (1) all perceived risk
and worry items will be positively associated with
Magnan 3
motivation to quit and (2) worry will be associated with
motivation after controlling for the effects of perceived
risk. Furthermore, (3) there will be perceived risk×worry
interactive effects on motivation to quit although the spe-
cific pattern of the interaction is not identified given the
variation in outcomes of previous work (e.g. Klein etal.,
2009; Portnoy etal., 2014b). A second aim addresses the
relative importance of perceived risk and worry of health
versus appearance consequences in explaining motiva-
tion to quit smoking using a relative weights analysis
(RWA). I further expected that worry and, to a lesser
extent, conditional perceived risk would be the most
important contributors of motivation to quit. No a priori
expectations regarding the relative importance of health
or appearance consequences were made.
Method
Participants
The current investigation utilized data from a study regard-
ing reactions to different types of smoking-consequence
messages, but the data reported here were collected prior
to randomization to condition. Participants were 121
smokers who reported smoking at least four cigarettes per
day. They were recruited from the local metro via Craigslist
advertisements and flyers posted around the area. Four
individuals were dropped from analysis because they
reported smoking fewer than four cigarettes a day at the
baseline session resulting in a final sample of 117 smokers.
Participants were paid US$80 for completing the 2-week
study. All participants gave written informed consent
before beginning, and this protocol was designated as
exempt by the Washington State University Office of
Research Assurances.
Measures
Background information and smoking behavior.Demographic
information included age, gender, race/ethnicity, and edu-
cation. To assess smoking behavior, participants indicated
how many cigarettes they typically smoke each day and the
age they began smoking. Nicotine dependence was assessed
using the Fagerström Test of Nicotine Dependence-Revised
(FTND-R; Heatherton et
al., 1991), =.66. Trait worry
was assessed with the Penn State Worry Questionnaire
(PSWQ; Meyer etal., 1990), =.94.
Perceived risk.Measures of perceived risk were adapted
from work by McCaul et
al. (2007) and Magnan et
al.
(2009). Perceived conditional risk of health consequences
of smoking was assessed with four items asking partici-
pants to indicate how likely they are to develop some type
of cancer or non-cancerous medical condition within their
lifetime if they continue to smoke (e.g. "What are the
chances that you might develop some type of cancer within
your lifetime if you continue to smoke?"). Similarly, per-
ceived conditional risk of appearance consequences of
smoking was assessed with two items (e.g. "How likely do
you think you are to develop a smoking-related deteriora-
tion of your physical appearance if you continue to
smoke?"). Responses were made on a 7-point response
scale (1=very low/not all likely; 7=very high), and items
were averaged to create scores for conditional health risk
(
=
.92) and conditional appearance risk (=.94). Per-
ceived comparative risk of health consequences was
assessed with four items ("What do you think your chances
are of developing some type of cancer in your lifetime
compared to other people your age who have smoked ciga-
rettes?"), and perceived comparative risk of appearance
consequences was assessed with two items ("Compared to
other people your age who have smoked cigarettes, how
would you rate your chances of developing smoking-
related deterioration of your physical appearance?").
Responses were made on 7-point response scales (1=much
smaller than average chances/below average; much big-
ger than average chances/above average), and items were
averaged to create scores for comparative health risk
(=.93) and comparative appearance risk (=.91).
Worry. Worry about developing a smoking-related medical
condition and deterioration of physical appearance were
assessed with three items focusing on the amount and fre-
quency of worry (adapted from Magnan etal., 2009): "How
much do you worry about developing a smoking-related
medical condition [deterioration of your physical appear-
ance]?" and "How much does thinking about a smoking-
related medical condition [deterioration of your physical
appearance] bother you?" were answered on 7-point (1=not
at all; 7=extremely) scales. "How often do you worry about
developing a smoking-related medical condition [deteriora-
tion of your physical appearance]?" was answered on a
7-point (1=never; 7=often) scale. Items were averaged to
create a single score for worry about health consequences
(
=
.85) and worry about appearance consequences
(=.91).
Motivation to quit.Assessment of motivation to quit was
adapted from work by McCaul etal. (2007). Participants
indicated how motivated they were to quit smoking in the
next 30days and 6months (1=not at all; 7=extremely) and
desire to quit smoking in the next 30
days and 6
months
(1=no desire at all; 7=strong desire). Participants also
indicated their plans to cut back on their smoking and to
quit (1=I do not have plans to cut back/quit; 5=I am cur-
rently cutting back/trying to quit). Scores were summed to
create a single motivation score, =.92. Similar approaches
to measurement of motivation have been associated with
quitting intentions (Kozlowski et
al., 1999) and worry
about cigarette smoking (McCaul etal., 2007).

Analysis
Prior to analysis, all continuous variables were checked for
assumptions of normality. Associations of perceived risk,
worry, motivation to quit, and behavior were tested using
bivariate correlations. Then, a hierarchical linear regression
was used to examine the main and interactive relationships
of conditional risk, comparative risk, and worry on motiva-
tion to quit. Step 1 included sociodemographic characteris-
tics (age, gender), trait worry, and average number of
cigarettes per day; step 2 added conditional and compara-
tive risk of smoking; step 3 added worry; and step 4 added
multiplicative interaction risk
×
worry terms. The set of
variables in the models were first standardized prior to
entry. Because of the positive bivariate correlations among
these variables, two separate models were tested for health
consequences and appearance consequences.
To test the relative importance of the perceived risk and
worry measures of health and appearance consequences, a
RWA (Johnson, 2000) was conducted with the six primary
correlates of motivation (conditional risk, comparative risk,
and worry for health and appearance consequences) using
RWA-Web (Tonidandel and LeBreton, 2015). This analysis
is recommended when variables included in a model are
correlated as a supplement to regression analyses in order
to break down the predicted variance in the criterion--here
motivation. RWA transforms the set of variables to be
orthogonal, and thus, uncorrelated with one another.
Ultimately, this analysis identifies which variables explain
non-trivial variance in motivation to quit by providing an
estimate of the proportionate contribution of each variable
to the variance accounted for by the complete set of varia-
bles. The analysis uses 95
percent confidence intervals
based on 10,000 replication bootstrapping around the esti-
mates of the set of variables to determine if significant vari-
ance is accounted for in the criterion.
Results
The final sample included 117 smokers. On average, the
sample was 35.79
years of age (standard deviation
(SD)
=
12.42; range: 18­64), 50.4
percent female, and the
majority had completed at least some college (71.5%). The
majority were White (75.2%), followed by African
American/Black (8.5%), Hispanic/Latino (6.0%), bi- or
multi-racial (3.4%), Native American/Alaska Native
(1.7%), Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (1.7%), and
2.5percent could not be categorized. Table 1 presents char-
acteristics of the sample by gender. Females reported
greater comparative appearance risk, health worry, appear-
ance worry, and trait worry than males.
Table 2 presents bivariate correlations between all per-
ceived risk and worry measures with age, trait worry, aver-
age daily cigarette use, and motivation to quit. Consistent
with the first hypothesis, conditional risk (r=.34 and .49),
comparative risk (r=.23 and .35), and worry (r=.42 and
.39) about health and appearance consequences of smoking
were all significantly and positively associated with moti-
vation to quit smoking. No risk or worry variables were
associated with daily cigarette use, and only worry about
health consequences (r=.23) and cigarettes per day (r=.27)
were associated with age.

The second hypothesis was that worry would be signifi-
cantly associated with motivation to quit over and above the
effects of perceived risk. In the model including perceived
risk and worry of health consequences (see top of Table 3),
age, gender, trait worry, and cigarettes per day were entered
in step 1. In step 2, greater conditional perceived risk of
health consequences (but not comparative perceived risk)
was significantly associated with more motivation to quit
(=.30). Importantly, and as predicted, greater worry about
health consequences was significantly associated with moti-
vation to quit after controlling for perceived risk (=.26). In
the model including perceived risk and worry of appearance
consequences (see bottom of Table 3), after controlling for
the same background variables in step 1, greater conditional
perceived risk of appearance consequences (but not com-
parative perceived risk) was significantly associated with
more motivation to quit (
=
.41). However, in contrast to
predictions, worry about appearance consequences did not
significantly add to the model.
The third hypothesis was that there would be significant
worry
×
perceived risk interactions on motivation to quit,
although the precise form of these interactions was not
identified. Unexpectedly, none of the interaction terms
specified in step 4 added significantly to the models using
perceived risk and worry for health consequence or per-
ceived risk and worry for appearance consequence.
To address the secondary aim, I conducted an RWAanal-
ysis to determine the relative importance of perceived risk
and worry framed as health or appearance consequences. A
weighted combination of the six primary risk and worry
variables accounted for 30.81
percent of the variance in
motivation to quit. The relative weights (RW) indicated that
conditional appearance risk (RW
=
.11), health worry
(RW
=
.08), appearance worry (RW
=
.04), and conditional
health risk (RW
=
.04) each accounted for a significant
amount of variance in motivation to quit, whereas the com-
parative risk variables did not. Table 4 presents the RW of
each variable in the model. Perceived risk of appearance
consequences and worry about health consequences were
the most important variables in the model, accounting for
35.17 and 27.98percent of the predicted variance in moti-
vation to quit, respectively.
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to test the main and interac-
tive effects of perceived risk and worry about health and
appearance consequences on motivation to quit smoking
and to address their relative importance on motivation to
quit. In keeping with prior work on perceived risk and
worry of health consequences, all perceived risk (condi-
tional and comparative) and worry measures were inde-
pendently associated with motivation to quit such that
higher perceived risk and worry were associated with
more motivation to quit smoking. Moreover, these asso-
ciations held when framed for health consequences of
smoking, as well as appearance consequences of smoking.
These results suggest that non-health-related perceived
risk and worry could be unique contributors to motivating
health behavior change.
Somewhat consistent with expectations, worry about
health consequences was associated with motivation to quit
over and above effects of perceived risk; however, worry
about appearance consequences was not. These findings
related to the health outcomes of smoking are in keeping
with previous work and theoretical perspectives (e.g.
Dillard etal., 2012; Janssen etal., 2014; Loewenstein etal.,
2001) suggesting that feelings of health risk may be more
important than cognitions of risk for some behaviors.
However, this work has largely focused on cognitions and
feelings of health threats. The current outcomes suggest
that the relative importance of cognitions versus feelings
for motivation may depend on the "threat" one is consider-
ing. Specifically, perceived risk of appearance conse-
quences made the largest contribution to motivation to quit,
while worry of health consequences made the second

largest. In other words, these variables were the most
important among the set of variables in the model.Although
the outcomes of the RWA differ slightly from the regression
outcomes, this is not surprising given the different
approaches to the analyses. The RWA identifies which vari-
ables explain non-trivial variance in motivation to quit (i.e.
uncorrelated with other variables in the model). Thus, while
both conditional risk measures and worry measures account
for variance in motivation to quit (regardless of conse-
quences for health or appearance), they may account for
little unique incremental variance in the regressions
(Tonidandel and LeBreton, 2015).
Dual-process theoretical perspectives suggest that
whether one relies on the analytical or experiential system
for decision-making may vary depending upon the context
(Slovic etal., 2005). In this study, cognitions of appearance

consequences weighed more heavily on motivation than
feelings of appearance consequences, while feelings of
health consequences weighed more heavily than cognitions
of health consequences. The relationship of risk appraisals
on behavior may be moderated by the proximity of the
health threat (Sheeran etal., 2014). Health consequences of
smoking are often perceived as being distal--occurring in
the distant future. Appearance consequences, in contrast,
may be more proximal--occurring in the near future.
Furthermore, appearance consequences are visible, poten-
tially making the negative effects of behavior (i.e. one's sus-
ceptibility) more salient. Health symptoms of smoking may
not be visible until the consequences become more severe.
This variation by proximity suggests differences in what
may influence thoughts about smoking consequences versus
feelings about smoking consequences. These outcomes add
to evidence that different content may differentially influ-
ence perceptions of risk and worry (Portnoy etal., 2014a).
The current findings also provide additional support
for growing literature highlighting the potential impor-
tance of appearance-related consequences on health
behaviors (Flett etal., 2013). The vast majority of work
assessing the role of risk perceptions on health behavior,
appropriately, focuses on health threats; but conse-
quences of smoking are relevant to more than personal
health--smoking has monetary, social, and appearance
consequences. To this end, these data provide some sup-
port that investigators focusing exclusively on health
consequences of behavior could be missing an opportu-
nity to motivate behavior change.
In contrast to expectations, there was no evidence of a
perceived risk
×
worry interaction effect on motivation to
quit, for either health or appearance consequences.
However, this outcome is consistent with prior work on
cancer screening behaviors (Moser etal., 2007). Interaction
effects also did not vary as a function of the way perceived
risk was measured (i.e. conditional or comparative)--a
finding seen in prior work (Portnoy etal., 2014b). One
possibility for these null findings is that this study focused
on motivation as an outcome, whereas other work has
focused on intentions (e.g. Portnoy et
al., 2014b) and
behavior (Ferrer et al., 2013). As mentioned previously,
motivation is associated with both intentions and behavior,
but the interactive effect may differ for motivation versus
behavior. Additionally, each prior test of this interactive
relationship used slightly different construct measurement
(e.g. single item versus multi-item risk or worry meas-
ures). This speaks to a larger issue of inconsistency of risk
measurement in the literature (Brewer etal., 2007); how-
ever, such a discussion is beyond the scope of this article.
Given the limited focus on the interactive relationship of
perceived risk and worry on health decisions and behavior,
these outcomes emphasize the need for continued work
establishing the conditions under which and for whom
such interactions occur.
Findings of the current investigation should be con-
sidered in light of several limitations. First, this was a
cross-sectional investigation and causal conclusions
cannot be made. Indeed, it is possible that the relation-
ship between perceived risk and worry and motivation is
bi-directional. Those who are already motivated to quit
may have more and/or stronger thoughts and concerns
about smoking consequences. Second, risk measures
may have stronger associations with motivation when
framed for specific "threats" (Brewer et
al., 2007).
Although a "non-cancerous medical condition" and
"smoking-related deterioration of physical appearance"
were indicated, specific consequences within these
domains were not provided (e.g. wrinkles, yellowing
teeth). The specific consequences one thought about in
these categories were left up to the responder's imagina-
tion and thus it is not possible to determine which proxi-
mal or distal threats were brought to mind. Finally, the
sample is limited to a single geographic area, and the
findings may not generalize to other groups.
Despite these limitations, the findings point to the
importance of taking into account the appearance conse-
quences of smoking. All perceived risk and worry items
for health and appearance items were independently
associated with motivation to quit. Furthermore, the most
important contributor of motivation to quit (i.e. perceived
risk or worry) may be dependent upon the behavioral
consequence under consideration. The current outcomes
suggest that in addition to health consequences, making
appearance consequences more salient may be a worth-
while focus for smoking cessation interventions.
