Abstract
The present study is a first attempt to experimentally test the impact of two specific social factors,
namely social conformity pressure and a sense of being watched, on participants' judgments of the
artistic quality of aesthetic objects. We manipulated conformity pressure with a test form in which a
photograph of each stimulus was presented together with unanimously low (downward pressure) or
high quality ratings (upward pressure) of three would-be previous raters. Participants' sense of being
watched was manipulated by testing each of them in two settings, one of which contained an
eyespots stimulus. Both social factors significantly affected the participants' judgments--
unexpectedly, however, with conformity pressure only working in the downward direction and
eyespots leading to an overall downward shift in participants' judgments. Our findings indicate the
relevance of including explicit and implicit social factors in aesthetics research, thus also reminding us
of the limitations of overly reductionist approaches to investigating aesthetic perception and
experience.

When strolling through a museum, we see artworks and we somehow react to what we are
seeing, emotionally and cognitively (e.g., Kreitler, & Kreitler, 1972). We form opinions and
we judge the artworks, for instance, with regard to aesthetic appeal, interestingness, or
artistic quality. As empirical aesthetics research has shown, such aesthetic judgments are
not determined by properties of the artworks alone, but also by a variety of external
factors (i.e., factors that are not actual properties of the artworks). Mere exposure, for
instance, is capable of increasing recipients' preferences for artworks, and even of
promoting whole artistic canons (Cutting, 2003). Aesthetic judgments are further affected
or modulated by semantic and physical context (Locher, Smith, & Smith, 2001; Muth, Raab,
& Carbon, 2017), training and experience (e.g., Nodine, Locher, & Krupinski, 1993), as well
as expertise (e.g., Pihko et al., 2011), to name just a few. Besides, judgments of artistic quality
are relatively easy to manipulate by providing information about an artwork's authenticity
(Wolz & Carbon, 2014). Even the perceived artistic quality of an acclaimed masterpiece such
as Leonardo's La Gioconda can be sabotaged, simply by making recipients deeply elaborate
an alternative version of the painting (the rediscovered and restored ``Prado version,''
presented to the public in 2012; see Carbon & Hesslinger, 2013) for just 10 minutes
(Carbon & Hesslinger, 2014).
According to several theoretical accounts, social variables are being incorporated into
aesthetic reception and the formation of aesthetic judgments (e.g., Muelder Eaton, 1995;
Mukar ovsky
´ , 2015; Riemer, Shavitt, Koo, & Markus, 2014). Empirical support for this
notion stems from observations in museums. For instance, Tro
¨ ndle, Wintzerith, Wa
¨ spe,
and Tschacher (2012) found that companionship and conversation of museum visitors
affected their reception of the exhibited artworks. In a recent field study carried out by
Carbon (2017), these two types of social behavior were shown by many of the observed
museum visitors. However, empirical and especially experimental inquiries into the role of
different social variables with regards to aesthetic reception and judgments are sparse.
Madden (1960) made one of the rare experimental attempts and tested whether judgments
of facial beauty could be modified by exertion of social conformity pressure. The paradigm
used in the experiment was a modified version of the paradigm used by Asch (1956). In a now
classic series of experiments, Asch investigated how strongly judgments in a simple perceptual
comparison task conform to or are independent of the judgments of a unanimous majority.
Participants were tested in groups of 8 to 10 men; they had to compare a standard line against
three comparison lines, one of which most obviously had the same length as the standard line.
In the most basic variant of the paradigm, judgments had to be stated aloud in front of the
group. All participants but one were in fact confederates of the experimenter and had been
instructed beforehand to give unanimously wrong answers in certain trials. Thus, the only
``real'' tested individual, who always was the second-to-last to announce his judgment, faced
conformity pressure directed counter the correct answer in these trials. Madden (1960)
modified the Asch paradigm in that the group exerting social conformity pressure was not
physically present in the experimental setting; instead, this social background was simulated
by presenting ratings that were labeled as ``given by previous raters.'' Each participant was
asked to judge several profile drawings of female heads with regards to beauty on a scale from
1 (homely) to 7 (beautiful), and to indicate his judgments by writing them onto a rating form
which had been prepared by the experimenter to look as if it had already been used by some
previous participants. The number of these simulated or made-up participants was either one
2 i-Perception
(for two subsamples), three (for eight subsamples), or five (for two subsamples). On 15 critical
trials, the simulated ratings were either two scale points higher than the average that the
respective stimulus had received in a pre-study (upward conformity pressure, exerted for one
half of the subsamples) or two scale points lower (downward conformity pressure, exerted for
the other half of the subsamples). The results indicate that the experimentally induced social
conformity pressure swayed the participants' beauty judgments toward the manipulated
average, working especially well in the downward direction.
Besides judgments of facial beauty, music preferences of adolescents (Inglefield, 1968)
and judgments of present and future fashionability of clothing (Davis & Miller, 1983) were
shown to be affected by social conformity pressure in experimental settings. With the present
experiment, we transpose the research on the impact of social conformity pressure to another
domain of aesthetics, the reception and judgment of aesthetic objects, or more specifically to
the judgment of their artistic quality. We hypothesize that similar to judgments of beauty,
judgments of artistic quality are likewise influenced by social conformity pressure. To test
this, we adopted Madden's (1960) paradigm of exerting social conformity pressure on our
participants while they were making judgments of artistic quality. This allowed us to conduct
a modified replication of Madden's study. Moreover, it allowed us to use perceived artistic
quality as a dependent measure, thus going beyond mere ratings of preference or impressions
of beauty. Although related to preference, artistic quality goes beyond, as it is a
multidimensional construct, determined by, inter alia, originality and ambiguity (see
Haertel & Carbon, 2014). As stimuli, we used photographs of objects with indifferent (i.e.,
medium) artistic quality, which had been assessed in an earlier baseline study. This is in line
with Madden, who showed female profiles of, previously rated, medium beauty. We
hypothesized that participants would reorient their judgments in the direction of the social
conformity pressure.
As past research has shown that normative behavior can be increased by observation
(Munger & Harris, 1989), we exerted conformity pressure under two different conditions.
Either we merely displayed manipulated ratings of would-be previous participants, or we
added a photograph of a pair of eyes to these fake ratings. Images of eyes or, more generally,
eyespots stimuli can serve as cues eliciting a sense of being seen or watched (Pfattheicher &
Keller, 2015). The mere presence of eyespots was found to be effective in enhancing various
kinds of pro-social behavior in the laboratory as well as in real-world settings (e.g., Bateson,
Nettle, & Roberts, 2006; Haley & Fessler, 2005). In contrast to the confrontation with fake
ratings of additional would-be raters, which represents a quite explicit cue to the social
embedding of the participants' judgments, eyespots stimuli are considered as rather
implicit social cues or triggers (see, e.g., Panagopoulos & van der Linden, 2017). Including
an eyespots-present condition in the present experiment, we thus introduced a second,
qualitatively different source of social influence. We accordingly hypothesized that the
conformity pressure would be further increased by the presence of eyespots so that the
difference between judgments made under downward versus upward conformity pressure
would be higher in the eyespots-present setting than in the eyespots-absent setting.
It has been theorized and shown that aesthetic judgments may be moderated by person-
related variables such as art expertise (e.g., Kreitler, & Kreitler, 1972; Pihko et al., 2011).
Responsiveness to social cues and pressures, on the other hand, may vary due to individual
differences in certain personality factors. DeYoung, Peterson, and Higgins (2002), for
instance, assessed conformity in terms of socially desirable responding and found
conformity to be positively related with stability, but negatively with plasticity, both of
which are, according to them, higher-order factors of the Big Five. In order to be able to
test, in a secondary analysis, whether results obtained in the present experiment were also
Hesslinger et al. 3
affected by individual differences in the named variables (art expertise, social desirability,
stability, and plasticity) we decided to measure them by means of questionnaires.
Method
Participants
A total of 48 students of the University of Bamberg (13 men; age M ¼ 23.0 years, range:
18­34 years) took part in the experiment. They all showed normal or corrected-to-normal
visual acuity and normal color vision. The participants were treated in accordance with
the declaration of Helsinki and gave written informed consent before the experiment.
They received a monetary compensation for their participation (E5 each).
Design
The present experiment followed a 2 Â 2 repeated measures design testing the impact of the
factors conformity pressure (upward, downward) and eyespots (present, absent) on the
perceived artistic quality of aesthetic stimuli. The design was fully crossed. Please note
that, for the factor conformity pressure, we followed the approach of Madden (1960) and
referred to previously collected baseline data on the artistic quality of the stimuli (Haertel &
Carbon, 2014) instead of including a control group. The sample used for assessing the
baseline data stemmed from the same participant pool as the sample used in the present
experiment; both samples exclusively comprised students of the University of Bamberg with a
comparable age composition (baseline sample: N ¼ 17, age M ¼ 24.1 years, range: 19­33
years, our sample: see section above). The levels of the factor eyespots were implemented
in a blockwise way with the order of levels being counterbalanced across participants. The
levels of the factor conformity pressure were varied within the blocks with eyespots being
present and absent, respectively. Each block comprised, in pseudo-randomized order, five
trials with upward and five trials with downward conformity pressure being exerted.
Apparatus
Aesthetic stimuli. As aesthetic stimuli, we used color photographs of 20 different objects, 13 of
which were contemporary art objects, and 7 of which were everyday objects. A brief
description of each stimulus and, in the case of art objects, artist, title, and year of
production are listed in Table 1. The 20 stimuli were chosen out of a larger set of
photographed objects such as to avoid extreme average artistic quality ratings that might
suffer from ceiling effects. Thus, we chose stimuli that had received a medium rating with
regards to this variable in a previous study by Haertel and Carbon (2014), more precisely an
average rating for artistic quality of minimally 3 and maximally 5 on a scale ranging from 1
(very low artistic quality) to 7 (very high artistic quality). The 20 selected stimuli were grouped
into two parallelized subsets (Set A, Set B) of 10 stimuli each. To ensure comparable levels of
artistic quality in both subsets, this was done by generating 10 pairs of stimuli with matching
baseline ratings for artistic quality (Table 2). Mean artistic quality ratings of the two subsets
did not differ significantly, t(9) < 1, p ¼ .3722, ns.
Setting used for manipulating presence of eyespots. The experiment was conducted in the
Behavioral Lab at the University of Bamberg, which comprises an anteroom and two test
cabins. The test cabins were furnished in a mirror-symmetric way with the permanent
partition between the cabins being the axis of symmetry. Each cabin comprised a window
4 i-Perception
vis-a
` -vis its entrance as well as two tables installed along the wall opposite the partition.
The seat next to the window in the left and right cabin, respectively, was used for testing.
Here, a pin board (29.5 cm Â 41.5 cm) was fixed to the wall above the tabletop, roughly at the
eye level of an average adult seated at the table. Several small notes (e.g., ``Close window
when leaving the room!'') were attached to the pin boards in both cabins to make the
participants believe that these boards were not part of the experiment, but used for regular

content differed slightly. In the left cabin, a gray-scale close-up photography of a pair of male
eyes staring through a shutter was further added to the pin board (eyespots-present). The
photograph had a height of 110 mm and a width of 150 mm which is equal to the width of the
watching-eyes images used by Bateson et al. (2006). In the right cabin, the respective space on
the pin board was left blank (eyespots-absent). A view into the test cabins is depicted in
Figure 1(a). Figure 1(b) shows the two pin boards.
Test form used for exerting conformity pressure. We created and used a test form in which the
aesthetic stimuli were presented together with ratings of three would-be previous participants
(cf. Madden, 1960). Our test form comprised an introductory instruction as well as two
separate rating booklets containing one of the two parallelized subsets of aesthetic stimuli
each. The introductory instruction told the participants that they were part of the pre-study
of another experiment, which required gathering ratings for artworks from a large art
database. The experimenter told each participant that they were the fourth out of a
group of six raters judging a specific selection taken from this database. In each booklet,
one of the 10 aesthetic stimuli of the respective subset was printed on an individual page
together with six scales to indicate the artistic quality of the presented object. Each scale was
reserved for one of the (would-be) raters in the actual participant's group. In line with the
cover story, in the first three scales, ratings had already been marked. This had been done by
the first author beforehand, using a different pen and marks of a specific size for each of the
three raters such that it looked as if different persons had already worked on the ratings. The

Note. The left part of the table shows the baseline ratings for the aesthetic stimuli used in the present experiment (10 per
set; each line in the columns ``Set A'' and ``Set B,'' respectively, represents the average baseline of one specific stimulus
obtained in a previous study). The ratings have been obtained and published by Haertel and Carbon (2014). Please note that
we have transformed the original ratings by multiplication with 9/7 as we did not use the 7-point scale of the earlier study
but a 9-point scale for assessing artistic quality. The columns ``Set A'' and ``Set B,'' respectively, indicate the transformed
values. The middle and the right part of the table show the fake ratings that were presented to the participants as ratings
made by three other raters (made-up raters/``fake raters'' FR1, FR2, and FR3)--but were in fact made up in order to exert
an upward (middle part of table) or downward (right part of table) conformity pressure on the participants. For reasons of
better comparability, both stimuli of a specific match pair were combined with the same fake ratings. The arithmetic mean
of the baseline, and the upward and the downward fake ratings, respectively, for each match pair is indicated by the columns

actual participants were asked to use the next free (i.e., the fourth) scale to indicate their own
judgment of artistic quality. The scale ranged from 1 ¼ very low artistic quality to 9 ¼ very
high artistic quality. Our scale thus had a wider range than the 7-point scale previously used
by Haertel and Carbon (2014) for gathering the baseline ratings. This allowed us to exert up-
and downward conformity pressure on our participants' judgments while keeping the risk of
floor and ceiling effects low. Conformity pressure was exerted by shifting the averaged
baseline ratings for each of the 10 match pairs of aesthetic stimuli by two categories on
the 9-point scale. Concretely, we systematically selected the ratings of the made-up
previous raters so that their average equaled about the averaged baseline ratings of the
match pair in question plus 2 (upward conformity pressure) or minus 2 (downward
conformity pressure). If, for example, upward conformity pressure should be exerted and
the match pair had an average baseline of 4.6, the ratings of the would-be previous raters
had to result in an arithmetic mean of about 6.6. Accordingly, we chose, for example, the

values 7, 6, and 7 as ratings indicated by the made-up raters. For reasons of comparability,
the same fake values were taken for both stimuli of a specific match pair. Baselines and fake
ratings for the 10 match pairs of aesthetic stimuli are listed in Table 2. Up- and downward
conformity pressure was induced for half of the 10 match pairs, respectively (i.e., for half of
the stimuli in each rating booklet). To prevent confounding effects, we systematically varied
the combination of specific stimuli with the direction of conformity pressure as well as the
combination of stimulus set with setting (eyespots-present vs. eyespots-absent) over the
sample. Table 3 gives a systematic overview of the different combinations that were used
and the number of participants tested under each of these combinations. The sequence of the
aesthetic stimuli in the rating booklets was pseudo-randomized (in sum, we had 32 different
orders that were used for the sample).
Questionnaires used for assessing person-related variables. To identify individuals with high or low
expertise, respectively, we assessed our participants' art expertise by means of several
questions concerning their direct contact with the arts (e.g., ``Wie oft haben Sie im letzten
Jahr Kunstausstellungen besucht?/How often have you attended art exhibitions last year?'';
``Wie viele Bu
¨ cher u
¨ ber Kunst/Ku
¨ nstler besitzen Sie?/How many books about the arts or
artists do you own?'').
In order to be able to control whether potential conformity effects with regards to
judgments of artistic quality can also (at least partly) be traced back to social desirability,
and whether it is further related to the two higher-order Big Five factors stability and

Desirable Responding/BIDR (Musch, Brockhaus, & Bro
¨ der, 2002) as well as the Big
Five using a short German version of the Big Five Inventory/BFI-K (Rammstedt &
John, 2005).
Procedure
The present experiment comprised three main phases completed by each participant
individually: an introductory phase and two test phases separated by a short break. The
introductory phase and the first test phase were realized either in the left (eyespots-present,
n1
¼ 24) or the right cabin (eyespots-absent, n2
¼ 24) of the lab, and the second test phase was
conducted in the other cabin. During the break, which was introduced to temporally separate
the test phases and to distract from the change of cabins, the participants were asked to come to
the anteroom of the laboratory. In the introductory phase, participants read the instructions
and received the monetary compensation for taking part in the experiment. The money was
handed in a small pouch containing E5 partitioned into coins (1 Â E2, 1 Â E1, 2 Â 50¢, 5 Â 20¢,
10 Â 10¢). If the participants had any questions concerning the procedure, these were answered
by the experimenter. In the first test phase, participants worked through the first rating booklet
judging the depicted aesthetic stimuli one after the other, in the given order without time
constraints. During the break, the experimenter tested the participants' visual abilities via a
Snellen eye chart and an Ishihara color vision test (short version); furthermore, the participants
were requested to fill in the personality and art expertise questionnaires. In the second test
phase, they worked through the second rating booklet, just as they had done in the first test
phase. At the end of the second rating booklet, after all ratings had been finished, they found an
additional short note asking whether they would like to spend part of the monetary
compensation they had received at the beginning of the experiment for a municipal social
project (Lebenshilfe Bamberg). They were instructed to put the according amount of money
(ranging from E0 to E5 in steps of 10¢) into an envelope lying on the table next to them and
then throw the envelope into a black box so that the experimenter did not know whether or
how much the individual participant had spent. We included the measure of donation behavior
to enable a comparison with the results of previous studies that have shown an enhancing effect
of eyespots on various pro-social behaviors such as donating (e.g., Keller & Pfattheicher,
2011). Except for the introductory phase and the break, the participants were left alone to
prevent potential confounding effects related to the presence of the experimenter who might,
despite any precautions, be perceived as watching or observing by the participants (concerning
the role of real potential observers with regards to eyespots effects; see, e.g., Ekstro
¨ m, 2012).
Participants took about 20 to 30 minutes to complete the entire experiment.
Results
In order to test the impact of our experimental manipulations on judgments of artistic quality, we
ran a 2 Â 2 within-subjects analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the factors conformity pressure
(upward, downward) and eyespots (present, absent). As dependent measure, we used the delta
between our participants' judgments and the baseline rating. This is in line with the approach of
Madden (1960), and further accounts for the fact that, in the present experiment, the fake ratings
used for exerting conformity pressure were relative to the baseline.1 For each participant and
trial, the delta value was calculated by the formula Á ¼ (participant's judgment À baseline
rating); accordingly, a positive delta value indicates that participants' judgments were higher
than the baseline, and a negative delta value indicates that participants' judgments were lower
Hesslinger et al. 9
than the baseline. Our results show significant main effects of conformity pressure, F(1,
47) ¼ 72.30, p < .0001, Zp
2 ¼ .606, and eyespots, F(1, 47) ¼ 5.09, p ¼ .0288, Zp
2 ¼ .098,
respectively. There was no significant interaction of the two factors, F(1, 47) < 1, p ¼ 0.6348,
ns. Judgments were significantly lower under downward conformity pressure (MÁ
¼ À1.54,
SD ¼ 0.88) than under upward conformity pressure (MÁ
¼ À0.12, SD ¼ 1.16). Both the delta
values were negative on a numerical basis--in the case of downward conformity pressure, that is
what we had expected, in the case of upward conformity pressure, however, we had expected our
participants' judgments to be higher than the baseline. Post hoc t-tests revealed that the delta was
significantly different from baseline only for downward conformity pressure, t(47)¼ À12.14,
p < .0001, with a very large effect indicated by Cohen's d ¼ 1.758, but we could not reveal any
significant effect for upward conformity pressure, t(47)¼ À0.72, p ¼ .4734, ns. The descriptive
data further show that the mere presence of eyespots reduced ratings of artistic quality (Figure 2).
The data assessed with the art expertise questionnaire showed that only one participant
met the criteria for high expertise, thus standing out from the remainder of the sample.
The latter was quite homogeneous with art expertise at low to medium levels.
Recalculating the above analysis without the data of the expert participant did not lead to
any changes in the reported results.
Potential modulating impacts of the assessed personality variables were tested by means of
two separate multiple linear regression analyses, one for the eyespots-present setting and one

for the eyespots-absent setting, respectively. As predictors, we included the following
measures: the two higher-order factors of the Big Five defined by DeYoung et al. (2002),
namely stability (comprising emotional stability/inverted neuroticism, agreeableness, and
conscientiousness) and plasticity (comprising extraversion and openness), and the two
components of social desirability according to Paulhus (2002), that is, self-deception and
other-deception. All predictors were z-standardized. As dependent measure, we used the
delta between judgments of artistic quality made under upward conformity pressure minus
judgments made under downward conformity pressure. Neither for the eyespots-present
(R2 ¼ .037, p ¼ .8152), nor for the eyespots-absent setting (R2 ¼ .161, p ¼ .1257) did we
obtain a significant model; none of the predictors contributed significantly to explaining
variance in the dependent measure.
In a last step, we analyzed the donation data, assessed at the end of the second test phase.
Donations were made in the eyespots-present setting by one half of our participants, and in
the eyespots-absent setting by the other half (Table 3). A two-tailed t test revealed that the
two groups did not differ significantly with regards to the mean amount of money donated,
t(46) ¼ À1.69, p ¼ .0984, ns. An undirected Mann­Whitney U test further showed that the
groups did not differ with regard to the probability of donating money either, z ¼ À1.485,
p ¼ .1376, ns.
Discussion
Bourdieu (1968) defined art perception as a deeply sociological phenomenon. Other authors,
such as Muelder Eaton (1995) and Mukar ovsky
´ (2015), likewise pointed to the relevance of
sociological and social factors with regards to aesthetic response and judgment. The present
study is a first attempt to experimentally apply this notion to judgments of artistic quality, as
opposed to mere preference ratings or impressions of beauty. We tested the impact of two
specific social factors, social conformity pressure and a sense of being watched, as induced by
the presence of eyespot stimuli, on judgments of artistic quality. Social conformity pressure
did modulate judgments of artistic quality. This finding, however, was restricted to pressure
in the downward direction, meaning our participants gave lower ratings of artistic quality for
a stimulus, if would-be previous raters had unanimously judged this stimulus as being of low
artistic quality. They did not give higher ratings, however, when the would-be previous raters
had unanimously judged the stimulus as being of high artistic quality. Such asymmetry would
be compatible with the results of Madden (1960) who tested the impact of social conformity
pressure on judgments of facial beauty, and found more pronounced effects of downward as
compared with upward conformity pressure. Madden argues that this asymmetry might trace
back to a lowering of the participants' equilibrium point on the scale or continuum of artistic
quality, which could be caused by the introduction of a social background and an increased
defensiveness in making choices, related to the more public nature of the situation. According
to this rationale, downward conformity pressure, going in the same direction as the shift of
the equilibrium point, would be especially effective in the presence of a social background.
Note, however, that the asymmetry could also be caused by differences between the reference
group and the current sample. Following Madden (1960), we used baseline ratings from an
external reference group. Although this reference group stemmed from the same participant
pool as the sample of the present experiment and had a comparable age-composition, it is not
guaranteed that our participants would have given the same or similar baseline ratings as the
reference group. This point is related to the potential subjectivity of aesthetic judgments in
general (cf. statistical differentiation of private and shared taste, Ho
¨ nekopp, 2006; cf. also,
high proportion of private as compared with shared taste in judgments of abstract artworks,
Hesslinger et al. 11
Leder, Goller, Rigotti, & Forster, 2016) and should be kept in mind as a limitation of the
present results.
Another aspect to be discussed is the size of the conformity pressure effect. It is likely that
for a wider range of stimulus material, the effect of conformity pressure might be smaller than
the very large effect found for the present stimulus set. We had selected 20 stimuli that had
received medium ratings of artistic quality in a pre-study run by Haertel and Carbon (2014).
Their original stimulus set comprised 213 photographed everyday objects and contemporary
art objects ranging from an ordinary cracked wine bottle to the Lobster Telephone created by
Salvador Dali´ in 1936. Our set was not only smaller, but also more homogeneous with
regards to artistic quality, as we had cut the lower as well as the upper tails of the
common distribution. Therefore, it may not have provided a sufficient frame of reference,
which might have led our participants to seek a more informative external frame of reference,
thus paying particular attention to the would-be raters' judgments. Confronted with a more
heterogeneous stimulus set that offers more of a frame of reference participants might be less
prone to using such external, social information. A question more or less directly related to
this point is whether the conformity pressure or social influence at work in the present
experiment was rather informational or normative (cf. Deutsch & Gerard, 1955). As had
been stated, a larger and more heterogeneous stimulus set would offer the participants a more
realistic and representative frame of reference regarding the range of artistic quality that
artworks potentially have. Even participants without extended art knowledge or expertise
would thus have a more informed and less vague basis for their judgments than with the
restricted and homogeneous stimulus set of the present experiment, which would also render
them less dependent on using other raters' judgments as orientation. If, in this changed
context, participants' ratings conformed less to those of the would-be raters, this would
indicate that the conformity effect found in our experiment was based on informational
rather than normative influence. If, however, the participants strongly conformed to the
would-be raters' judgments again, this would indicate that the found conformity effect was
rather normative than informational. Still another question is whether the conformity
expressed in the participants' ratings reflects an actual change of their individual and
private opinions or merely public compliance. One step to get some indication in a future
study would be to reassess participants' judgments of artistic quality for the presented stimuli
after a certain delay, in the absence of conformity pressure.
Against our assumptions, the presence of eyespots did not further strengthen the
conformity effect--there was no interaction of the factors: The spread between judgments
made under downward versus upward conformity pressure was not increased in the eyespots-
present setting. Nonetheless, the presence of eyespots significantly affected judgments of
artistic quality in terms of an overall downward shift (Figure 2). Panagopoulos and van
der Linden (2017) recently reported that eye-cues can induce higher levels of negative
emotions such as distress and anxiety. As individuals also refer to their own emotional or
affective states when assessing the value of to-be-judged objects (cf. affect-as-information,
e.g., Clore & Huntsinger, 2007), a negative emotion or affect can lead to devaluation. We
suppose that this might have been the path that led to the overall downward shift of artistic
quality judgments when eyespots were present in our experiment. This might also explain the
trend why our participants numerically donated less money in the eyespots-present than in
the eyespots-absent setting. A crucial question that remains open, however, is: Why did
various other studies find positive and enhancing effects of eyespots on pro-social
behavior? As Panagopoulos and van der Linden suggest, negative emotions elicited or
increased by the presence of eyespots may lead to pro-social behavior through triggering
reputational concerns or fear of being sanctioned when violating social norms. In our
12 i-Perception
experiment, in contrast, the affect-as-information effect that negativized the aesthetic
judgments might have overshadowed on the participants' donating decision and behavior.
Another possibility is that our participants were less responsive to the pro-sociality triggering
effect of the eyespots than were participants in other studies, for instance, due to a weak
chronic public self-awareness. As Pfattheicher and Keller (2015) showed, this variable
potentially moderates the effect of eyespots or watching eyes on individuals' pro-social
behavior in that individuals with weaker chronic public self-awareness are less prone to
show pro-social behavior in response to the presence of watching eyes than individuals
with stronger public self-awareness.
As it seems, there is more but one possible path leading from the emotions or affect elicited
by the presence of eyespots to specific affective, cognitive, or behavioral outcomes. The task is
now to systematically investigate whether the presence of eyespots is principally related to
more negative emotions or affect, or whether different kinds of eyespots maybe induce
different emotional or affective responses, and, more generally, whether (depicted) eyespots
elicit responses comparable with or different from those elicited by real observers. In the
present experiment, the depicted eyes looked rather frightening, and likely conveyed a
negative affect or an unpleasing impression (which might have directly factored in with the
judgments). In addition, it would be important to gain more insight into the factors that
determine which path is taken from there to a final affective, cognitive, or behavioral
manifestation.
Conclusion
In the present experiment, we showed that social conformity pressure and a sense of being
watched induced by the mere presence of eyespots have an impact on judgments of artistic
quality. The results underline the importance of including social factors in aesthetics research,
thus adding to Makin's (2017) ``Gestalt nightmare.'' It becomes obvious that overly
reductionist approaches to investigating aesthetic perception and experience will fall short,
not only due to the wholeness and Gestalt character of aesthetic or artistic objects but also
due to their embedding in a larger contextual and social Gestalt.

Note
1. In addition, we ran a 2 Â 2 within-subjects ANOVA with the raw judgments of artistic quality as the
dependent measure. This yielded the same pattern of results with significant main effects of
Hesslinger et al. 13
conformity pressure, F(1, 47) ¼ 79.67, p < .0001, Zp
2 ¼ .630, and eyespots, F(1, 47) ¼ 5.65, p ¼ .0216,
Zp
2 ¼ .107, respectively. There was no interaction effect of the two factors. Judgments of artistic
quality were again lower in the case of downward conformity pressure (Mno eyes
¼ 4.13, SD ¼ 1.07,
Meyes
¼ 3.84, SD ¼ 0.90) than in the case of upward conformity pressure (Mno eyes
¼ 5.50, SD ¼ 1.25,
Meyes
¼ 5.31, SD ¼ 1.29).
