R etail clinics, which are usually located inside retail phar-
macies, provide walk-in care mainly for low-acuity prob-
lems. Retail clinics have transparent pricing and are staffed by
nurse practitioners or physician assistants. Since first opening
in the United States in 2000, retail clinic use has grown rapidly
but remains small: the proportion of families that reported
using a retail clinic in the prior year increased from 1 % in
2007 to 3 % in 2010.1 Retail clinics have obvious appeal as
low-cost, accessible sites of care.
Much has been written about the potential promises and
perils of retail clinics.2­4 For privately insured, healthy,
wealthy, young patients, retail clinics likely provide similar
quality and lower cost compared to primary care offices for
otitis media, pharyngitis, and urinary tract infections without
detracting from short-term preventive care.5 Antibiotic pre-
scribing is more guideline-concordant at retail clinics than in
primary care offices or emergency departments.6,7 Retail
clinics may be associated with reduced costs.8 On the other
hand, retail clinics have been found to impair continuity and to
reduce seeking care with a primary care practice when a new
problem arises.9 Little is known regarding retail clinic perfor-
mance for underserved, older, sicker patient populations.
Retail clinics strive to provide fast access for patients, and
are themselves experimenting with new models of care to
improve their service. In this issue of the Journal of General
Internal Medicine, Polinski and colleagues from CVS
MinuteClinic describe a cross-sectional quality improvement
assessment of retail clinic-based telehealth.10 Patients with
specific symptoms, mostly acute respiratory infections, who
might have to wait for an in-person practitioner for more than
20 minutes, were given the option to have their care provided
by a remote practitioner assisted by an onsite nurse.
The authors estimated that 40 to 54 % of telehealth patients
completed a post-visit survey (n=1734). Respondents were
mostly insured (80 %), female (70 %), and had a primary care
provider (59 %). For half, it was their first visit to a
MinuteClinic. Thirty-two percent of respondents expressed a
preference for receiving care via telehealth versus a
"traditional in-person visit." The vast majority of users were
highly satisfied with nearly all attributes of their experience.
Respondents who lacked health insurance were significantly
more likely to prefer telehealth visits. Women, those who
believed they had a good understanding of telehealth, and
those who were satisfied with the convenience of telehealth
all had higher odds of liking telehealth. Over 70 % of respon-
dents would use telehealth again and would recommend
telehealth to someone else.
Polinski and colleagues should be congratulated for study-
ing an innovative approach to improving low-acuity care
delivery. A virtual network of clinicians who need only the
assistance of a nurse assistant and specialized internet-
connected tools could represent an improvement on an
expanding model of care.
Yet this study highlights a concern about retail clinics: they
create demand for unnecessary services. Telehealth facilitated
visits for sinusitis, upper respiratory infections, bronchitis,
allergic rhinitis, influenza, and conjunctivitis. These visits
may be unnecessary and have the potential to stimulate un-
necessary follow-up care.3 Retail clinics currently have no
incentive to discourage unnecessary care. In fact, retail clinics
may view these visits as easy, quick, and desirable and might
fear that patients would leave if kept waiting for too long.
Good continuity of care and effective pre-visit triage could
have prevented many of these visits.
In a perfect world, all patients would have a usual source of
care; be able to easily connect with their own primary care
practice; receive triage advice; and practices would provide
prompt, efficient advice and service. Comprehensive primary
care is associated with lower cost, improved health outcomes,
greater efficiency, and reduced disparities. All else being
equal, patients would choose to get care from a primary care
practice that knows them, is easily accessed, and will follow
them over time.
Clearly, we do not live in that world. Primary care is not
optimally structured or incentivized to provide accessible care.
According to the Commonwealth Fund, 73 % of Americans
responded that it was difficult to make timely doctors' ap-
pointments, get phone advice, or receive after-hours care
without having to visit the emergency room. Retail clinics,
urgent care centers, and commercial online care are all under-
standable responses to primary care that is inefficient, costly,
and inaccessible. These new models of care reflect the failure
of primary care to provide access.
Those of us in primary care should take note. CVS
MinuteClinic feels that 20 minutes is too long to wait. They
are innovating to increase access. Can primary care practices
stand the harsh light shone by this delivery innovation? Can
primary care practices learn, innovate, and radically improve
access?
Radical improvement in access must be accompanied by
radically improved efficiency. If a transaction presently takes
place on paper or over the phone, we need to automate it when
possible, switch it to the web, and optimize it for mobile. We
need to move most communication to secure, usable web
portals that are aggressively promoted and monitored. We
need to provide chronic disease management through a com-
bination of registry analytics, group visits, community health
workers, synchronous and asynchronous e-visits, and tradi-
tional in-person visits. For our high-utilizer and homebound
patients, we need to make house calls, a practice we gave up
only due to now-archaic financial and technological con-
straints. A single urgent care episode should be able to seam-
lessly and promptly be transformed, as needed, from an asyn-
chronous e-visit to a synchronous e-visit to an in-person visit
with the primary care practice or involvement of an emergency
department. Illness does not end for patients when they hang
up the phone or walk out of the office; care should not stop
when clinicians sign their notes. Practices should provide
extended and weekend hours. Improved access and efficiency
should improve the patient experience. Visits in which either
the patient thought it was a "waste of time" or clinicians felt
"the patient didn't really need to come in for that" should be
viewed as triage failures.
Primary care physicians' days should look radically differ-
ent. Although there is simplicity and comfort in seeing patients
in-person, one-after-another, it is inefficient for the physician,
the practice, and the patient. We can connect with many more
of our patients if we are spending more of our time not seeing
our patients in person. There will be more structured e-visits to
review, video calls to make, teams to facilitate, and panels to
manage with proactive outreach and follow-up.
There has been progress and new resources are available.
Many health systems schedule phone visits and "desktop
time." The American Medical Association's stepsforward.org
and UCSF's Center for Excellence in Primary Care both have
turn-key approaches to optimizing the busy primary care
practice. They describe pre-visit laboratory testing, synchro-
nized prescription renewal, team documentation, and panel
management techniques. Despite these and others, additional
innovation is sorely needed.
How will we pay for these changes? Health systems' in-
centives to support these innovations are becoming aligned
with the passage of the Affordable Care Act and the expansion
of Accountable Care Organizations. Medicare has already
moved this direction with the Chronic Care Management
Program. Many private insurers, recognizing value and patient
demand, are moving to cover innovative care.
There will be plenty of practice innovations to implement,
research to be done, and questions to ask. Can we deliver care
that is equally effective over the internet as in-person? What is
the optimal telehealth configuration? What is the ideal level of
continuity that balances efficiency with outcomes and patient
experience? Are there subgroups of patients who benefit most
from telehealth treatment? Are there subgroups of patients
who might potentially be left behind such as the underserved,
elderly, and sickest? We need to demonstrate that new, proac-
tive methods of delivering care can benefit our most vulnera-
ble patients.
Primary care practices and clinicians should view visits to
emergency departments, retail clinics, or urgent care centers as
sentinel events. What was it about our own practice that made
seeking care away from primary care necessary? Viewed from
a more global, financial perspective--and to paraphrase
Rushika Fernandopulle of Iora Health--primary care accounts
for 4 % of healthcare spending in the United States; how much
of the remaining 96 % represents a failure of primary care?
What would primary care look like if it received 10 % of
spending?
Ultimately, we look forward to the implementation of
models with radically improved efficiency and access that
could realize the benefits of comprehensive primary care. We
do not begrudge the existence of retail clinics, urgent care
clinics, or online care companies. They shine a harsh light
on primary care's failings. We should look where that light
shines brightest and innovate toward doing better for patients.
