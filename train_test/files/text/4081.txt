When you observe a family member reaching for a piece
of candy, you do not reactively track the movement of his
or her hand. Rather, you fixate on the candy before the
hand reaches it. This predictive gaze shift allows you to
overcome the internal processing lag of the perception-
action system (i.e., the time it takes to perceive the sur-
rounding world) and pay attention to important events as
they unfold. When you are after the same sweet, this
predictive gaze provides the time you need to plan and
execute an action toward the goal. Without prediction,
your perception of the surrounding world would be frag-
mented and lag behind real-world events, and you would
certainly never get hold of the candy. In short, the ability
to perform predictive gaze shifts while observing actions
is fundamental for successful interactions with the envi-
ronment (Hayhoe & Ballard, 2005; Henderson, 2003;
Land, 2009; von Hofsten, 2004), irrespective of whether
the overarching goal is to collaborate or compete.
It has long been known that predictive eye move-
ments play an important role in guiding our own actions.
A large body of work has shown that predictive eye
movements are functionally integrated into most every-
day actions that we perform (von Hofsten, 2004), includ-
ing reaching (Johansson, Westling, Bäckström, &
Flanagan, 2001), walking (Patla & Vickers, 1997), driving
(Land & Lee, 1994), playing sports (Land & McLeod, 2000;
Vickers, 1996), and cooking (Hayhoe, Shrivastava,
Mruczek, & Pelz, 2003; Land, Mennie, & Rusted, 1999).
Typically, we move our eyes to a goal several hundred
milliseconds before that goal is reached. The exact timing
of one's gaze depends on the task at hand (Land &
Hayhoe, 2001) and the proficiency of the actor (Abernethy,
1990; Franchak, Kretch, Soska, & Adolph, 2011; Sailer,
Flanagan, & Johansson, 2005; von Hofsten, 2004).
Embodied Account of Predictive Eye
Movements
However, it was not until 2003 that Flanagan and
Johansson (2003) discovered that predictive gaze shifts
are not only important in guiding our own actions but
are also integral to action observations--that is, observ-
ing another person's goal-directed actions. In their study,
Flanagan and Johansson demonstrated that adults pre-
dicted action goals by fixating on the end location of an
action before it was reached, both when they executed
an action themselves and when they observed someone

Abstract
An important element in social interactions is predicting the goals of others, including the goals of others' manual
actions. Over a decade ago, Flanagan and Johansson demonstrated that, when observing other people reaching for
objects, the observer's gaze arrives at the goal before the action is completed. Moreover, those authors proposed that
this behavior was mediated by an embodied process, which takes advantage of the observer's motor knowledge. Here,
we scrutinize work that has followed that seminal article. We include studies on adults that have used combined eye
tracking and transcranial magnetic stimulation technologies to test causal hypotheses about underlying brain circuits.
We also include developmental studies on human infants. We conclude that, although several aspects of the embodied
process of predictive eye movements remain to be clarified, current evidence strongly suggests that the motor system
plays a causal role in guiding predictive gaze shifts that focus on another person's future goal. The early emergence of
the predictive gaze in infant development underlines its importance for social cognition and interaction.

else executing an action (the task involved moving three
small blocks in the coronal plane).
The similarity in the eye movements of the actor and
the observer led Flanagan and Johansson to suggest that
the prediction of another's goal could result from a mech-
anism that mapped an observed action onto the motor
representation of that action and that this basic process
operated during both the execution and the observation
of the action. The idea was that when you see someone
else act, you activate your own motor plans for similar
actions, and these motor plans include instructions for
the oculomotor system to implement goal-directed, pre-
dictive saccades. In other words, Flanagan and Johansson
proposed that a goal-directed gaze shift would be initi-
ated by activating a single underlying neural network,
irrespective of who performed the action. This hypothe-
sis was consistent with the discovery of mirror neurons
(Dipellegrino, Fadiga, Fogassi, Gallese, & Rizzolatti, 1992;
Fadiga, Fogassi, Pavesi, & Rizzolatti, 1995; Gallese, Fadiga,
Fogassi, & Rizzolatti, 1996; Rizzolatti, Fogassi, & Gallese,
2001) and the notion that action understanding is rooted
in the motor system. As with the mirror-neuron system
(Iacoboni & Dapretto, 2006; Molenberghs, Cunnington, &
Mattingley, 2012), the tendency to predict a goal while
observing another person's action was assumed to reflect
a quick, automatic, visuo-motor matching process, rather
than a process based on the cognitive interpretation of
visual information (Flanagan & Johansson, 2003).
In this article, we refer to this view as the embodied
account of predictive eye movements. In general, embod-
ied accounts emphasize the notion that cognition is situ-
ated in activity and that it is the outcome of a history of
active manipulations of the environment (Barsalou,
2008). This view contrasts with theories that assume that
cognition is an abstract manipulation of symbols (Mahon
& Caramazza, 2008).
Flanagan and Johansson (2003) argued that the pres-
ence of the predictive gaze spoke against the possibility
that eye movements during action observations were
driven by pure visual analysis, without involving the
motor system (p. 770). According to those authors, visu-
ally driven eye movements are typically reactively linked
to the events we observe. To confirm this, in addition to
conditions in which participants either performed or
observed another actor, Flanagan and Johansson included
a control condition in which the blocks appeared to be
moving to their final location by themselves (the experi-
menter performing the actions was not visible to the
observer). As expected, when observing these apparently
self-propelled objects, participants fixated on the goal
only after the object had arrived there--that is, their gaze
shifts were reactive rather than predictive. Taken together,
those results suggested that it was necessary to see a
hand-object interaction to elicit a predictive gaze; that
conclusion was consistent with the notion that the
observer must use his or her own motor knowledge to
predict the goal. Of course, given that only behavioral
data was available at the time, the suggestion that this
process was mediated by the observer's motor system
was a speculation.
The present article reviews the research that followed
from the Flanagan and Johansson study (2003).
Simultaneously, we evaluate the proposed embodied
account of predictive eye movements and present studies
that have directly manipulated brain activity, with the aim
of better understanding the neural networks involved.
We also review recent work that has investigated action
prediction in infancy. Overall, the evidence supports the
central claim made by Flanagan and Johansson (2003),
but, as always, the story is more complicated than origi-
nally assumed.
Unless otherwise stated, all empirical findings cited
below refer to eye tracking studies that have investigated
the tendency of adults or infants to predict (with their
eyes) another person's goal-directed actions, which, for
the sake of simplicity, we refer to as action prediction in
this article. The majority of the studies used the timing of
gaze to another person's goal as the dependent variable,
although some also used the accuracy of gaze shifts
when multiple possible goals were present.
Behavioral analyses of human adults
that have replicated and extended
the initial findings of Flanagan and
Johansson
Research subsequent to Flanagan and Johansson (2003)
has replicated and extended their initial findings. These
studies have demonstrated that an adult gaze can predict
the goal of a wide range of manual actions performed by
others, including stacking objects (Rotman, Troje, Johnson,
& Flanagan, 2006), reaching (Kanakogi & Itakura, 2011),
eating (Kochukhova & Gredebäck, 2010), drinking
(Hunnius & Bekkering, 2010), placing objects in contain-
ers (Eshuis, Coventry, & Vulchanova, 2009; Falck-Ytter,
Gredebäck, & von Hofsten, 2006; Melzer, Prinz, & Daum,
2012; Rosander & von Hofsten, 2011), and pouring
(Myowa-Yamakoshi, Scola, & Hirata, 2012). The key find-
ings of these studies are consistent with the embodied
account of action prediction. First, they show that a pre-
dictive gaze can be triggered by point light hands (in
which only motion profiles are maintained, represented
as moving dots). This finding suggests that basic kine-
matic information is sufficient to elicit the predictive pro-
cess (Elsner, D'Ausilio, Gredebäck, Falck-Ytter, & Fadiga,
2013; Elsner, Falck-Ytter, & Gredebäck, 2012). Second,
they showed that it is important that the goal of the
Eye Movements During Action Observation 593
perceived action is within the reaching space of the agent
reaching for the goal (Costantini, Ambrosini, & Sinigaglia,
2012b). Last but not least, they also employed control
stimuli that displayed apparently self-propelled objects,
similar to those used by Flanagan and Johansson, to study
action prediction in adults. As expected, consistent with
the initial findings, the predictive goal-directed gaze shifts
were not observed in the control conditions (Eshuis et al.,
2009; Falck-Ytter, 2010; Falck-Ytter et al., 2006) or were
observed to a lesser degree than in conditions involving
human action (Eshuis, Coventry, & Vulchanova, 2009;
Kochukhova & Gredebäck, 2010). Taken together, the
findings suggested that there is something special about
human actions that can trigger predictive eye movements.
However, a convincing test of the embodied account pro-
posed by Flanagan and Johansson would require a differ-
ent type of data--that is, data that could provide a causal
link between motor-system activation and predictive eye
movements during action observation.
Direct evidence: Motor activity is
causally linked to action prediction
The premise that action prediction depends on the
observer's own motor proficiency was tested by interfer-
ing with the action-production system and then deter-
mining whether action prediction was inhibited.
According to the embodied account, action prediction
should be task-specific; thus, interference should occur
primarily when the task performed and the task observed
require the same effector (e.g., the same hand).
The first study to use this approach was reported by
Cannon and Woodward (2008). They instructed adult
participants to observe a goal-directed manual action
(similar to the one used by Flanagan and Johansson)
while performing one of two distracting tasks: Participants
either tapped their fingers or counted backward. Action
prediction was diminished by simultaneous finger tap-
ping but not by counting backward (a working memory
task). The authors argued that taxing the motor system
interferes with the process of matching perceived events
to one's own motor plans for similar actions. In contrast,
they argued that working memory tasks have little to do
with the embodied processes that are assumed to guide
predictive eye movements, and thus these tasks were
expected to have little impact on action prediction.
Assuming that the interfering effect of finger tapping was
due to a specific tax on the motor system, that study pro-
vides selective support for the embodied account.
Costantini, Ambrosini, and Sinigaglia (2012a) let adults
hold either a small or a large object while observing either
a hand approaching objects with a whole-hand grip (suit-
able for large objects) or a hand approaching objects with
a precision grip (suitable for small objects). It was found
that performing a grip that was different from the one
observed resulted in fewer predictions relative to a base-
line condition, in which the hand of the participants
rested freely. Ambrosini, Sinigaglia, and Costantini (2012)
demonstrated that the latency of adults' predictive eye
movements increased (i.e., they became less predictive)
when an observer's arms were tied behind his or her
back, compared to when the hands were free to move.
Again, those studies suggested that motor interfer-
ence could affect action prediction, but the evidence is
purely behavioral, and hence it was not fully satisfactory,
given the nature of the hypothesis. Arguably, the most
direct support for the embodied account of predictive
eye movements was obtained in two studies that used
joint transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and eye
tracking methods (Costantini, Ambrosini, Cardellicchio,
& Sinigaglia, 2013; Elsner et al., 2013). In one of those
studies (Elsner et al., 2013), adult participants observed
goal-directed reaching actions, represented as point-
light displays, while TMS pulses selectively stimulated
the hand or leg areas in the primary motor cortex. Results
were compared to those produced in the absence of
TMS activation at each site. Consistent with the embod-
ied account, the participants exhibited delayed fixation
on the goal when TMS pulses interfered with the hand
area of the primary motor cortex, compared to when no
TMS was performed or when the TMS targeted the leg
area of the primary motor cortex. In the other study
(Costantini et al., 2013), participants viewed manual
reaching actions while TMS pulses were directed either
to the ventral premotor cortex or to one of two control
sites (the superior temporal sulcus or the frontal eye
field). Stimulating the premotor area caused specific
interference effects that were not observed in the two
control conditions.
In summary, five studies experimentally manipulated
activity in the motor cortex (either through TMS or behav-
ioral manipulations) while participants observed another
individual's actions (Ambrosini et al., 2012; Cannon &
Woodward, 2008; Costantini et al., 2013; Costantini et al.,
2012b; Elsner et al., 2013). All studies demonstrated an
interference effect, consistent with the embodied account.
These five studies have provided the strongest evidence
that the motor cortex is somatotopically recruited and
contributes causally to action predictions.
The Development of Action Prediction
Given the importance of action prediction in our ability
to encode and interact with the surrounding world,
much attention has been devoted to investigating these
processes during infancy and early childhood. This
recent line of research has demonstrated uniformly that
action prediction develops early in life (Ambrosini

Hunnius, & Bekkering, 2011; Rosander & von Hofsten,
2011; Senju, Southgate, Snape, Leonard, & Csibra, 2011;
Southgate, Senju, & Csibra, 2007). By attaining the abil-
ity to predict another person's action goals, infants can
fixate on future goals, and thus they proactively pay
attention to the person's actions as they unfold. From
this perspective, action prediction is a fundamental cor-
nerstone of our ontogenetic development. Without this
ability, learning from others through observation and
interaction would be far reduced.
Several developmental studies have studied infants of
different age groups and demonstrated that action predic-
tion develops at the same time as the ability to perform an
action. For example, 4-month-olds have poor reaching
skills, and they fail to predict the goals of reaching actions.
Six-month-olds have recently developed the ability to
reach for objects, and they have the ability to predict the
goal of other people's reaching actions (Kanakogi &
Itakura, 2011; see also Ambrosini et al., 2013). They are
also highly proficient at placing objects in their mouths,
and they can predict the goal of other peoples' eating
actions (Kochukhova & Gredebäck, 2010). In contrast,
6-month-olds cannot predict the movements of mechani-
cal claws (Kanakogi & Itakura, 2011), spoons that appear
to move on their own, or combing actions that they can-
not perform (Kochukhova & Gredebäck, 2010).
The ability to place objects into a container typically
develops between 6 and 12 months of age, and 12-month-
olds, but not 6-month-olds, can predict the goal of such
actions (Falck-Ytter et al., 2006). However, 12-month-olds
(and even adults) cannot predict the goal of a ball that
appears to move on its own into a container. Moreover,
at the age of 1 year, prediction of an initial act (in this
case, reaching) will become modulated by the overarch-
ing goal of the action sequence (placing the object either
on a table or inside a container). This finding suggests
that prediction is controlled by a system of action under-
standing that is hierarchically organized (Gredebäck
et al., 2009).
Several of those studies also analyzed individual man-
ual ability. There are clear correlations (when age is con-
trolled for) between predictive eye movements and
various measures of manual capability, including the abil-
ity to reach for something (Kanakogi & Itakura, 2011;
Melzer et al., 2012), the number of times an infant places
objects in a container (Cannon et al., 2012), and the num-
ber of attempts made before accurately placing a puzzle
piece on a puzzle board (Gredebäck & Kochukhova,
2010). Also, the ability to predict the goal of feeding
actions correlated with an infant's lifetime experience of
being fed (Gredebäck & Melinder, 2010).
In summary, developmental studies have demon-
strated that the ability to predict action emerges in early
infancy. This finding underlines the role of prediction in
social cognition and interactions in general. Also, the cor-
relation between the actions that infants can perform and
actions they can predict suggests that social cognition
and social learning might be bound by the developing
action repertoire of the infant. This result is consistent
with the embodied account of action prediction.
How Is Prediction Related to Action
Understanding?
According to Flanagan and Johansson (2003), action pre-
diction and action understanding occur simultaneously.
That is, low-level sensory information from performing
an action taps directly into the motor system, which then
in turn outputs the estimated goal (the direct-matching
hypothesis; see also Rizzolatti et al., 2001). Interpreted
from this perspective, action prediction reflects the
"direct" activation of a motor program, which includes--
in addition to understanding the goal of the action--task-
specific instructions to the oculomotor system to direct
the eyes toward the goal (Flanagan & Johansson, 2003).
According to an alternative view (Csibra, 2007; Southgate,
2013), action prediction follows action understanding.
This view argues that goal encoding must precede motor
simulation; thus, this theory proposes that motor activa-
tion and the consequent predictive eye movements reflect
the observer's reenactment of achieving the goal, as
though the observer had executed the action. Here, this
theory is referred to as the reenactment account.
Notably, both of the above views argue for a role of
the motor system, and they cannot be disentangled easily
based on the current evidence. Arguably, however, the
behavioral experiments can provide circumstantial evi-
dence against the reenactment account. We know from
other work (not related to predictive eye movements)
that infants and adults can attribute a goal to the actions
of an "agent" that lacks all similarity to the human body
(Gergely & Csibra, 2003). However, when observing self-
propelled "agents" move without the interaction of an
actor's hand, predictive eye movements seldom occur
(Eshuis et al., 2009; Falck-Ytter, 2010; Falck-Ytter et al.,
2006; Kochukhova & Gredebäck, 2010). The reenactment
Eye Movements During Action Observation 595
version of the embodied account cannot readily account
for this finding, because it predicts that, once a goal is
identified, the observer should be able to reenact the
action; thus, the predictive processes associated with the
action should be activated, irrespective of the morpho-
logical characteristics of the agent.
The roles of prior knowledge,
statistical regularity, and goal
salience
As described above, when one observes events that lack
a clear correspondence with something in the motor rep-
ertoire of the observer, the gaze is typically reactive.
However, several studies have shown that when one
observes an action that corresponds to an action that one
can perform, the action prediction is influenced by prior
knowledge, statistical regularity (e.g., the mean result of
a repeated action), and the salience of the goal (Ambrosini,
Costantini, & Sinigaglia, 2011; Eshuis et al., 2009; Green,
Li, Lockman, & Gredebäck, in press; Henrichs et al., 2014;
Rotman et al., 2006). The most extreme influences of this
kind can be observed in infancy. At that stage, action
predictions occur primarily when the goal is highly
salient and when the observed agent consistently reaches
for the same (as opposed to a different) object (Henrichs
et al., 2012; Henrichs et al., 2014). Finally, recent work
has demonstrated cultural influences on action predic-
tion. Green et al. (in press) demonstrated that 8-month-
old infants in Sweden and China both predicted that
eating actions would go to the mouth. However, this was
true only for eating actions performed with a spoon
among Swedish infants and only for eating actions per-
formed with chopsticks among Chinese infants.
Together, the results show that embodied processes
dedicated to action prediction do not work in isolation;
instead, these processes account for other types of infor-
mation that can be used to predict future states. In other
words, although action prediction may be fundamentally
an embodied process, the tendency to predict is modu-
lated by broad scope of ancillary functions that either
enhance the activation within the motor system of the
observer or, more generally, facilitate attention. For
example, the effect of goal saliency might be related to
attention. When the goal is highly salient, it may be easier
to inhibit the initial fixation on the ongoing action and
facilitate a saccade to the goal object, which would accel-
erate the gaze shift to the predicted goal. In a similar
manner, the effect of statistical regularity, or repetition,
might boost the activation of one's own motor plans
through priming. In infants, whose motor plans are less
developed, this boost might be necessary to activate the
motor system to the threshold required to initiate a pre-
dictive saccade.
Finally, it is worth noting that, in addition to modulat-
ing action prediction after the embodied system is estab-
lished, statistical learning may also contribute to the
development of the system. Specifically, it has been sug-
gested that embodied systems for action understanding
acquire their mirroring properties through Hebbian learn-
ing (see, e.g., Heyes, 2010; Keysers & Gazzola, 2014;
Keysers & Perrett, 2004).
Prediction in other contexts
The above evidence relates primarily to the ability to pre-
dict in rather simplified contexts (e.g., a hand reaching
for an object), but it should be noted that predictive gaze
shifts to goals also occur when observing actions embed-
ded in social interactions between people (Fawcett &
Gredebäck, 2013, 2015; Senju et al., 2011; Southgate
et al., 2007). How embodied and other processes interact
in such situations is currently not well understood. It is
also notable that infants and adults can predict the future
state of certain nonsocial events. For example, predictive
eye movements are systematically directed to the future
location of non-animate moving balls that temporarily
disappear behind a barrier (Gredebäck & von Hofsten,
2004; Johnson, Amso, & Slemmer, 2003; Kochukhova &
Gredebäck, 2007; for a review, see Gredebäck & von
Hofsten, 2007). Clearly, the embodied account cannot
explain predictive gaze shifts in all contexts.
Conclusion
Prediction is a fundamental component of our interac-
tions with the world, including interactions with other
people. When you view someone else reach for an
object, you anticipate what is going to happen by mov-
ing your gaze to the object before the arrival of the
other person's hand. As shown in this review, this pre-
dictive capacity--which is likely to be a key compo-
nent of social perception, cognition, and interaction,
both in competitive and collaborative contexts--builds
upon the activation of one's own motor system
(Costantini et al., 2013; Elsner et al., 2013). This hypoth-
esis was proposed over 10 years ago by Flanagan and
Johansson (2003), but the lack of brain-based evidence
rendered it speculative at that time. Following in the
footsteps of the Flanagan and Johansson study, over
30 articles have provided direct evidence for the
embodied account of predictive eye movements, and
additionally, several studies have shed important new
light on the development of action prediction. This
body of work has shown that infants possess the
impressive capacity to predict other people's action
goals and that this capacity develops hand in hand with
the infant's own action capacities.

Future Directions
This review has highlighted key areas for future investi-
gation, including the relationship between action predic-
tion and action understanding and the roles of general
factors, such as prior knowledge, statistical regularity,
and goal salience, in embodied processes.
The ontogenetic development of the mirror-neuron
system and related networks of action understanding in
infancy is a matter of current controversy and debate
(Heyes, 2013). The infant studies described above, which
focused on action predictions early in life, provided a
way to illuminate these questions, and those types of
studies should be exploited and developed further.
In everyday social interactions, action understanding is
never complete; rather, one must constantly revisit current
assumptions about other people's actions in light of new
information. Therefore, future studies should focus on the
role of the predictive gaze in the action understanding
process--for example, in checking, validating, and updat-
ing assumptions and beliefs about other people's goals.
This would entail, among other things, going beyond
repetitive video presentations of simple manual actions
and acknowledging the intricate dynamics of embodied
and other processes (Gredebäck & Daum, 2015).
Determining the importance of action predictions in
dynamic social interactions requires implementing future-
oriented processes in artificial systems designed for real-
world interactions (Vernon, Fadiga, & von Hofsten, 2011;
and see, e.g., Metta et al., 2010). Initial steps have been
taken to integrate action prediction into developmental
robotics platforms (Sciutti et al., 2012). In turn, simula-
tions of the action-prediction system may provide useful
ways to test putative mechanisms that underlie action
predictions. However, much work remains to be com-
pleted before this goal can be realized.
To test the proposed theories and demonstrate the
clinical relevance of developmental studies, one could
test infants with deteriorated motor-control functions or
who have been born without hands or arms but with
otherwise intact cognitive capacities. Such studies could
provide important new evidence for the role of active
experience in socio-cognitive development, and they
may reveal potential compensatory processes.
Finally, testing action prediction in infants at risk for
autism may provide a means to test the hypothesis that
disruptions in systems involved in (embodied) action
understanding may represent a causal link between
genetic/molecular risk factors and a later diagnosis
(Cattaneo et al., 2007; Iacoboni & Dapretto, 2006). In
general, the identification and study of groups that fail,
early in life, to predict other people's action goals would
provide a means to test a core assumption presented in
this article--namely, that action prediction is a necessary
foundation for social cognition and interaction.
