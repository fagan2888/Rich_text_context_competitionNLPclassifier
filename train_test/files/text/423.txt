Background. Recent findings of neuroimaging studies indicate that reading aloud and arithmetic calculation activate
bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of humans. The purpose of this study was to measure the effect of reading aloud and
arithmetic calculation, by elderly people who were clinically diagnosed with dementia Alzheimer type, on their brain
functions and activities of daily living.
Methods. Sixteen experimental and 16 age- and Mini-Mental State Examination score-matched control subjects
participated. The participants in the experimental group were asked to perform a training program using learning tasks in
reading and arithmetic for 2­6 days a week. The function of the frontal cortex of the subjects was assessed by FAB at
bedside (Frontal Assessment Battery).
Results. After 6 months of training, the FAB score of the experimental group showed a statistically significant im-
provement. The FAB score of the control group decreased slightly over the 6-month period, and the difference between
the scores of the experimental and control groups was statistically significant. We also observed the restoration of com-
munication and independence in the experimental group.
Conclusion. Our results indicate that learning tasks of reading aloud and arithmetic calculation can be used for
cognitive rehabilitation of dementia patients.
RECENTLY, the importance of cognitive rehabilitation
for patients with dementia has been argued (1). The
aims of cognitive rehabilitation for patients with dementia
include optimizing functioning and well-being, minimizing
the risk of excess disability, and preventing the development
of a malignant social psychology within the patient's family
and social environment (2). Because memory impairment is
a common attribute of any dementia subtypes, most of the
intervention programs for dementia care focus on memory
trainings (3­6).
In this study, we propose a new intervention program, the
concept of which is derived from the knowledge of both brain
science and clinical studies. Memory impairment and
cognitive disturbances, such as aphasia, apraxia and agnosia,
and disturbance of executive function, are the main cognitive
deficits in dementia, and the association cortices, particularly
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, are involved in these
cognitive functions (7,8). The decrease in regional cerebral
blood flow (rCBF) in the frontal, parietal, and temporal
association cortices is commonly the case for dementia (9­
11). Therefore, cognitive impairments in dementia patients
may well result from dysfunction in those association cortices.
In human brain-mapping studies, brain areas showing
increases in rCBF and metabolism in relation to performance
of cognitive tasks have usually been reported (12).
Therefore, we can identify specific cognitive tasks which
increase rCBF and metabolism of these association cortices,
particularly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, from those in
previous brain-imaging studies. In this study, we hypothe-
sized that activation of the association cortices by cognitive
tasks may well improve rCBF and metabolism of these
cortices, which lead to improve the function of these cortices.
To choose effective cognitive tasks for activation of the
association cortices, we reviewed previous neuroimaging
studies published elsewhere and/or those by our laboratory.
In this process, we selected brain-activation paradigms that
satisfy the following two criteria: a) the paradigms must
activate the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as the
parietal and temporal association cortices of the bilateral
hemispheres compared with the resting state, and b) the
paradigms must be very simple, so that people with senile
dementia can follow and perform them. Finally, we
identified two tasks: a) reading sentences or words aloud
(13­16) and b) performing simple arithmetic operations (17­
22), both of which met our above-mentioned criteria.
Therefore, we prepared two tasks in arithmetic and
Japanese language, which were systematized basic prob-
lems in reading and arithmetic, for the training program.
The theoretical flaw of our hypothesis is that it is not clear
whether activation of brain networks involved in reading and
calculations can improve functions of brain network(s)
involved in other cognitive processes. To test our hypothesis

and to overcome this problem, we measured the effect of
continuous learning by elderly people with dementia on
their brain functions and activities of daily living. In this
study, we focused mainly on the function of the frontal
cortex. The limitation of this study is that we could not
determine the role of social, emotional, and cognitive factors
in the training effect.
METHODS
Subjects
Sixteen individuals in the experimental group and 16 in
the control group were recruited from a nursing home for the
elderly, called Eiju-no-Sato, in Fukuoka, Japan. The subjects
were randomly assigned to these two groups. Written
informed consent was obtained from each individual using
forms approved by the Tohoku University and the
Declaration of Helsinki (1975). Clinical diagnostic evalua-
tion by neurologists and an X-ray computed tomography
examination of the brain were performed on each participant.
In this study, none of the participants had abnormalities such
as tumors, cerebral bleeding, cerebral infarction, or patho-
logical brain atrophy, on X-ray computed tomography
examination. All of the individuals in both groups had
a clinical diagnosis of dementia Alzheimer type (DAT) that
met the criteria of the American Psychiatric Association's
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th
edition (DSM-IV). The participants in the learning group
were asked to perform a training program using learning
tasks 2­6 days a week at learning centers in Eiju-no-Sato.
To estimate the change in the cognitive ability of the
participants, Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) (23)
and Frontal Assessment Battery at the bedside (FAB) (24)
were measured in each participant of each group. In the
learning group, the neuropsychological characteristics were
measured prior to the start of the training program (baseline)
and 6 month after the training program had taken place
(follow up). In the control group, the same characteristics
were measured at the same time as in the learning group.
The baseline clinical and neuropsychological characteristics
of the learning and control participants are summarized in
Table 1. In addition, ability for verbal communication and
independence was estimated in both groups by two in-
dividual items of scales for mental state and daily living
activities for the elderly, named the NM scale (25). Neither
assessment score showed a statistically significant differ-
ence between the two groups (independent samples t test).
Except for the training program, both groups of participants
had the same nursing care programs at the same place.
Learning Tasks
The materials for the training program were two tasks in
arithmetic and Japanese language, which were systematized
basic problems in reading and arithmetic. We prepared
a wide range of materials, which were used for everyday
learning for 4-year-old children to fourth grade elementary
school students (that is, 10-year-olds). The problems were
printed on both sides of A4-size paper. As for the arithmetic
problems, the lowest level was counting practice, and the
highest level was three-digit division. As for the Japanese
language problems, the lowest level was to read and write
single syllables, and the highest level was to read aloud fairy
tales. Prior to the training program, the appropriate degree of
difficulty and workload for each participant were assessed by
a diagnostic test, so that he or she could continue to perform
the learning tasks with ease.
The participants came to the learning center either on
summons by the staff, or on their own initiative every day
from Monday to Saturday. They would complete two to five
sheets of each task prepared for each individual for that day,
and their work would be assessed by the staff. The mistakes
were corrected by the participants. If they could not solve
a problem by themselves, the staff members stationed
between desks provided sufficient advice for them to be able
to solve it. The study period ended when the participants
completed each of the problems correctly. The daily learning
time for the two tasks was approximately 20 minutes.
Statistical Analyses
The neuropsychological characteristics of both groups
were compared using an independent sample t test at baseline
and at follow-up. A further analysis comparing baseline and
follow-up scores separately for the learning and control
groups was performed by paired t test. Statistical significance
was set at p , .05 for all the comparisons.
RESULTS
Neuropsychological Characteristics
All the participants in the learning group continued the
program for more than 6 months. The mean (SD) of the
training days was 19.2 (4.6) days per month.
The scores of the neuropsychological characteristics at
baseline and follow-up are summarized in Figure 1. In the
learning group, the FAB score showed a statistically
significant ( p , .05) increase after the training had taken
place. However, the MMSE score did not show any
significant changes. In the control group, the MMSE score
showed a statistically significant ( p , .05) decrease at
follow-up compared with baseline. Nevertheless, the FAB
score did not show any significant changes. At follow-up, the
MMSE and FAB scores for the learning group were
statistically significantly ( p , .05) higher than those for
the control group. There was no relationship between the
magnitude of change in the scores of the neuropsychological

The scores of the individual items of the FAB at baseline
and follow-up are summarized in Table 2. At follow-up, the
score for similarities (conceptualization) was significantly
( p , .05) higher in the learning group compared with the
control group. In the control group, the score for motor series
(programming) showed a statistically significant ( p , .05)
decrease at follow-up compared with baseline. In the learning
group, the score for similarities (conceptualization) showed
a statistically significant (p , .01) increase at follow-up
compared with baseline. There was no relationship between
the magnitude of change in the scores of the individual items
of the FAB and the number of training sessions that the
learning group participants attended.
The scores of the individual items of the NM scale at
baseline and follow-up are summarized in Table 3. In the
learning group, the score for independence showed a statis-
tically significant (p , .05) increase at follow-up compared
with baseline. Although score for verbal communication
showed an increase at follow-up compared with baseline, it
did not reach a statistically significant level (p ¼ .1). In the
control group, the score for verbal communication showed
a subthreshold decrease at the p ¼ .1 level at follow-up
compared with baseline.
Examples of the Case Patients
Case 1.--A 75-year-old man had baseline FAB and
MMSE scores of 3 and 13, respectively. After the 6-month
training period, his FAB and MMSE scores increased to 10
and 15, respectively. He showed reactivation of his
communicative ability during the course of training. Before
the start of the training, he could only speak a few words, and
remained motionless in the same place, wearing an anxious
expression. After the learning period, his number of spoken
words increased, his voice became clearer, and he initiated
conversation on his own. Moreover, before the learning
period he had to be reminded by the staff about bowel
movements, but 3 months after the learning period, he was
able to go to the toilet by himself.
Case 2.--A 77-year-old woman had baseline FAB and
MMSE scores of 5 and 7, respectively. She also showed
reactivation of her communicative ability during the course
of training. Before the learning period she almost did not
converse at all. She began to speak simple words and, after
6 months, she could hold a simple conversation, and began
to return smiles to the staff in corridors.In particular, right

after the start of the program she sometimes refused the learn-
ing tasks, but after 6 months she started to come to the learn-
ing center by herself. In the early stages she came to the
learning center in her pajamas; later, she came dressed in
regular daytime clothing. As learning became more natural for
her, she began to express thanks for the care given to her, her
expression relaxed, and she began to smile in her daily life.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrated that a training program in
reading and arithmetic problems, named a Learning Therapy,
was effective in dementia care for the improvement of
cognitive functions. All of the experimental participants
showed improvement in verbal communications with the
nursing staff. In addition, significant improvement was
observed in verbal conceptualization with regard to the FAB.
It is also important to note that cognitive ability measured by
MMSE did not decline during the 6-month learning period.
The term rehabilitation is defined as a process of active
changes aimed at enabling people who are disabled by in-
jury or disease to maintain an optimal level of physical,
psychological, and social functions (26). Recently, in line
with this view, cognitive rehabilitation approaches for
people with dementia have been introduced. Because
memory impairment is a common attribute of any dementia
subtype, most of the intervention programs for dementia care
have been focused on memory training (3­6). Learning
Therapy has two significant characteristics that distinguish
this method from previous methods of cognitive rehabilita-
tion. One is that this method is not an evidence-based
method; it relies on the theoretical background of the
knowledge of neuroscience research--that is, solving
arithmetic problems and reading aloud activate bilateral
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of humans. The second is that
it aims to mediate transfer of the different cognitive func-
tions within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex--that is, from
reading aloud and solving arithmetic problem functions
toward general cognitive functions such as communication,
independence, and conceptualization. Although in the
present study, DAT patients showed improvement in the
several cognitive functions following daily training in
reading aloud and solving arithmetic problems.
It has been widely recognized that one of the significant
functional roles of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is to
carry out executive functions. The executive functions
mediated by the frontal cortex involve planning, selection,
and ongoing regulation of behavior (27). A number of
studies (28,29) reported a deterioration of the executive
functions in DAT, and showed that impairment in perfor-
mance of a variety of tasks in DAT patients are related to
executive dysfunctions (30). In Learning Therapy, daily
training is focused on reading aloud and solving arithmetic
problems. Reading aloud is accomplished by the combina-
tion of several cognitive processes, for example, recognition
of the visually presented words, conversion to phonological
representation from graphic representation of words, analy-
sis of the meaning of words, and control of pronunciation.
Solving arithmetic problems is also accomplished by many
cognitive processes, for example, recognition of visually
presented numbers, performance of arithmetic operations,
and control of hand movements. It is obvious that both
reading aloud and solving arithmetic problems require
executive functions. Neuropsychological studies of children
with cognitive disorders indicated that reading disability
(31­34) as well as arithmetic disability (35,36) is related to
the impairment of executive functions. In the present study,
significant improvement was observed in verbal conceptu-
alization with regard to the FAB in the experimental group.
The verbal conceptualization test was designed to measure
the ability to identify abstract categories (24). Abstract
category is impaired in frontal damage (37), is investigated
by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, which is commonly
used and considered as an important indicator of frontal
dysfunction (38), and is one of the important aspects of
executive function (39). Therefore, in the case of Learning
Therapy, one possible explanation for the transfer of
cognitive functions is the improvement of executive
functions during the course of training.
The other important result of Learning Therapy is
improvement in communication between nursing staff and
participants. Because immediate feedback of participants'
performance was required during Learning Therapy, this
therapy improves face-to-face verbal communication, and
the communication behavior of the nursing staff changed
during the course of the daily trainings.
It was suggested that, in general, the quality of staff­
resident communication is often observed to be less than
optimal (40­43). Because nursing home staff perceive them-
selves as too busy to talk with the residents, they are noted to
have low expectations of the residents, leading to low levels
of social interaction. The residents themselves perceive the
staff as too busy to engage in conversation, and feel that they
should not bother them unnecessarily (44­46). Cognitive
impairments are correlated with decreased engagement,
conflict, and distress in nursing home residents (47,48),
and changing the communicative behavior of the nursing
staff could have a strong positive impact on the residents
(49). Therefore, in the present study, improvement of the
cognitive function, particularly communication, of the
learners may well have resulted from the increased oppor-
tunity for staff­learner communication in daily care. This
point is one of the limitations of interpretation of the results
of our study. In this study, we were not able to distinguish
whether the source of benefits for the experimental group
was the cognitive training itself, the interaction with the
experimenters working with the experimental group, or the
additional attention received by the experimental group from
the nursing home staff. Future investigations attempting to
determine the role of social, emotional, and cognitive factors
in the training effect are necessary.
