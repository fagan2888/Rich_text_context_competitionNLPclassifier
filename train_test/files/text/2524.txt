ABSTRACT
Objectives: The purposes of this study were to compare the relative fit of two alternative factor models of allostatic load
(AL) and physiological systems, and to test factor invariance across age and sex.
Methods: Data were from the Midlife in the United States II Biomarker Project, a large (n = 1255) multisite study of adults
aged 34 to 84 years (56.8% women). Specifically, 23 biomarkers were included, representing seven physiological systems:
metabolic lipids, metabolic glucose, blood pressure, parasympathetic nervous system, sympathetic nervous system,
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and inflammation. For factor invariance tests, age was categorized into three groups
(45, 45­60, and >60 years).
Results: A bifactor model where biomarkers simultaneously load onto a common AL factor and seven unique system-
specific factors provided the best fit to the biomarker data (comparative fit index = 0.967, root mean square error of
approximation = 0.043, standardized root mean square residual = 0.028). Results from the bifactor model were consistent
with invariance across age groups and sex.
Conclusions: These results support the theory that represents and operationalizes AL as multisystem physiological dysreg-
ulation and operationalizing AL as the shared variance across biomarkers. Results also demonstrate that in addition to the
variance in biomarkers accounted for by AL, individual physiological systems account for unique variance in system-
specific biomarkers. A bifactor model allows researchers greater precision to examine both AL and the unique effects of spe-
cific systems.
Key words: physiological dysregulation, allostatic load, biomarkers, Midlife in the United States.
INTRODUCTION
Psychosomatic research has characterized the relations
of psychological variables and indicators of major
physiological regulatory systems in humans such as the
parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) and the hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (for examples of reviews, see
Refs. (1­3)). Measures of physiological systems are fre-
quently operationalized via the use of biomarkers. As the
field of psychosomatic medicine has advanced, it is in-
creasingly common for multiple biomarkers to be assessed.
Although many biomarkers exist for each physiological
system, there is little consensus on how to integrate these
biomarkers to assess the state and functioning of physio-
logical systems and multisystem physiological dysregu-
lation. Despite the lack of consensus on how to integrate
multiple biomarkers, it does seem that using combinations
of biomarkers is valuable. For example, in one study, a
composite risk score of biomarkers predicted all-cause mor-
tality over and above age and sex (4), and in another study,
the number of high-risk biomarkers combined demon-
strated a gradient relationship with mortality (5).

One conceptual approach to integrating biomarkers of
multiple systems is allostatic load (AL), which posits that
the body's adaptation to challenge and demands of the envi-
ronment (allostasis; (6)) over time takes a physiological toll
and results in cumulative wear-and-tear or dysregulation
across multiple physiological systems (7). Thus, the dys-
regulation is hypothesized to be a multisystems phenome-
non that occurs across multiple regulatory systems rather
than in particular systems only (for a review, see Ref.
(8)). Figure 1 shows a diagram of three potential levels of
analysis for biomarkers, from using specific biomarkers
as outcomes (bottom), to combining multiple biomarkers
to assess specific physiological systems (middle), and the
highest aggregate combining multiple physiological sys-
tems (AL; top). The primary goal of this study is to test
two plausible measurement models of biomarkers hypo-
thesized to represent both overall AL and individual physi-
ological systems.
An individual with allostatic overload and systemwide
dysregulation will demonstrate some degree of dysregula-
tion in multiple physiological regulatory systems involved
in allostasis, and this physiological dysregulation may be
assessed using a composite index from multiple systems.
To date, such indices of AL have typically been created
by assuming equal influence of individual biomarkers, di-
chotomizing them into high and low health risk based on
quartiles or clinical risk points, averaging within a particu-
lar physiological system (e.g., cardiovascular), and then
summing (e.g., Refs. (4,9)). Similar indices have been cre-
ated by first standardizing individual biomarkers and then
summing (e.g., Ref. (10)). Although less commonly applied
to biological data, scale development and testing methods
such as factor analysis have been used for years to develop
and validate measures of latent constructs (e.g., depressive
symptoms) from multiple observed indicators (e.g., feeling
sad or blue, loss of interest). For an introduction to factor
analysis in psychosomatic research, see Ref. (11).
The few studies that have examined the psychometric
properties and tested the factor structure of biomarkers
in relation to AL found that a second-order AL factor
(i.e., biomarkers load onto individual system factors which
in turn load onto AL) provided adequate fit to the data
(12­14). Related work in metabolic syndrome has shown
a similar hierarchical factor structure (e.g., Refs. (15,16)).
In addition, a second-order AL factor model of biomarkers
was found to be invariant across sex and ethnicity (13), and
provided good fit when controlling for sex and age (12);
it did, however, differ between participants on and off of
medications in an elderly sample (14).
Limitations are apparent in the existing literature on
AL. First, previous research has had relatively few bio-
markers per system, leaving open the question whether
the same factor structure will emerge when systems are
more comprehensively assessed. Second, although AL is
hypothesized to be prominent in the aging process (17), to
our knowledge, no previous study has tested whether the
measurement of AL is invariant across adulthood or
whether the relations among biomarkers differ as a func-
tion of age. Finally, although a second-order factor model
provided adequate fit in previous studies, there was room
for improvement of model fit. Given the complex rela-
tions among biomarkers, examining alternative models
may be valuable.
In the present study, we used data from the Midlife in
the United States (MIDUS) II Biomarker Project, to address
the following aims.

Aim 1
To test and compare two theoretically derived factor models
that reflect the following hypotheses: a) biomarkers within
a physiological system are associated, and b) based on AL
theory that there is systemwide dysregulation, biomarkers
or systems should load onto a common factor. The structure
of the two models is diagrammed in Figure 2.
Model 1
Biomarkers load onto their respective physiological system,
and the seven systems, in turn, load onto a second-order
factor. This model tests whether relations among bio-
markers are explained by each physiological subsystem,
and the relations among the physiological subsystems are
explained by a single, common second-order factor (AL).

Model 2
Biomarkers load onto their respective physiological system,
and the seven systems are allowed to freely covary; in addi-
tion, each biomarker loads directly onto a common factor
(AL). This bifactor model tests whether the relations among
biomarkers are explained by two processes: a) a common
factor, capturing the notion that there is an underlying
process influencing multiple physiological systems, and
2) system-specific factors, capturing the notion that beyond
the common portion shared across biomarkers, there are
unique effects of particular physiological systems that are
independent of other systems. Model 1 is nested within
Model 2 allowing for a direct test of fit.
Specifically, we hypothesize that Model 1 will demon-
strate acceptable fit and represent a parsimonious ver-
sion of a correlated-systems model. Finally, if systemwide
effects drive the individual systems, then Model 2 will
demonstrate no better fit than Model 1 and be less parsimo-
nious. However, if the systemwide and system-specific ef-
fects have unique and nonoverlapping elements, Model 2
should demonstrate better fit. Because we expect impor-
tant, unique systemwide and system-specific effects, we
hypothesize that Model 2 will demonstrate the best fit.
Aim 2
To test whether the optimal factor structure underlying bio-
markers of AL (Aim 1) is invariant across adulthood from
34 to 84 years of age and sex.
METHODS
Sample
The sample came from the larger MIDUS study. The first wave of data,
MIDUS I, included phone interviews and mailed questionnaires to a na-
tional sample of adults aged 25 to 74 years and was designed to assess fac-
tors related to physical and psychological health and well-being in early
adulthood, middle adulthood, and older age. Data for MIDUS I were
collected in 1994 to 1995 in four parts: a large, national probability sample
(the core sample; n = 3487); siblings of the core sample (n = 950); twins
(n = 957 pairs); and an oversampling in metropolitan areas (n = 757). Par-
ticipants from MIDUS I, as well as an additional sample of urban African
Americans living in Milwaukee, WI (n = 592, to increase diversity), were
assessed in 2005 for MIDUS II (18). MIDUS II included follow-up ques-
tionnaires, and a subset of participants who were eligible and consented
(n = 1054 from the original sample and n = 201 from the Milwaukee sam-
ple) participated in the MIDUS II Biomarker Project, where extensive
biological data were collected (19). Thus, a total of 1255 participants
were included coming from 1098 families (944 families contributing one
participant, 152 families contributing two participants, 1 family contribut-
ing three participants, and 1 family contributing four participants).
Procedure
As part of the MIDUS II Biomarker Project, participants went to one of
three (University of California, Los Angeles; University of Wisconsin;
and Georgetown University) General Clinical Research Centers for a med-
ical examination and comprehensive biomarker assessment (e.g., fasting
blood draw, 12-hour urine, and electrocardiography), and reported on med-
ication history. Details on MIDUS are available online at http://www.
midus.wisc.edu, and for the biomarker project, see Ref. (19). The MIDUS
II Biomarker Project was approved by the institutional review boards of
the University of Wisconsin, Madison; the University of California, Los
Angeles; and Georgetown University.
Demographics and Health Outcomes
Demographic data including age, sex, and ethnicity were collected
via self-report. Self-reported medication use, including antihypertensive
medications, heart rate reducing (e.g., -blockers), diabetes medications,
cholesterol-lowering mediations, and fibrates, was collected and used to
identify medication-free participants.
Biological Measures
Seven physiological systems were measured using 23 biomarkers. Details
on collection and assay of biomarkers are reported in Supplementary Data
File 1, http://links.lww.com/PSYMED/A264, in Ref. (20).
Sympathetic Nervous System
The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) was measured using 12-hour, over-
night urinary epinephrine (E) in mg/g creatinine and norepinephrine (NE)
in mg/g creatinine.
Parasympathetic Nervous System
The PNS was measured using heart rate variability and resting pulse rate
(in beats per minute). Heart rate variability was assessed via electrocardiog-
raphy and was operationalized as the standard deviation of beat-to-beat
intervals (R-R interval), root mean square of successive differences
(RMSSD), low-frequency spectral power, and high-frequency spectral
power (HFHRV).
Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis
The HPA axis was measured using 12-hour, overnight urinary cortisol
g/g creatinine and blood serum dihydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S)
in g/dL.
Inflammation
Inflammation was measured using plasma levels of C-reactive protein
(CRP) in mg/L, interleukin-6 (IL-6) in ng/L, fibrinogen in mg/dL, soluble
E-selectin (sE-Selectin) in ng/mL, and soluble intracellular adhesion
molecule 1 in mg/L.
Cardiovascular
The cardiovascular system was measured with resting systolic blood pres-
sure (SBP) in mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in mm Hg. For
the model, these were converted into pulse pressure (SBP - DBP) and SBP.
Glucose
The metabolic glucose system was measured using the homeostatic model
assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), fasting glucose in mg/dL,
and glycosylated hemoglobin in percent.
Lipids
The metabolic lipid system was measured using waist-to-hip ratio, high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol in mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol in mg/dL, and triglycerides in mg/dL.
Data Analysis
Structural equation modeling was used to compare the two alternative
models of the relations among biomarkers, with age and sex included as co-
variates for each biomarker.
Model fit indices were used to find the best fitting of the two hypothe-
sized factor structures. In addition, Model 1 is nested within Model 2. A 2
difference test adjusted for the scaling factor (21) was conducted between
Models 1 and 2. Multiple-group structural equation modeling was used to

test whether the best-fitting model (1,2) was the same (invariant) or varied
across different groups. Specifically, model invariance was tested for age
group (45, 45­60, >60 years) to establish whether the structure is con-
sistent or differs for younger and older participants and sex (female versus
male). To compare factor means across groups (a common objective in re-
search on AL), it is generally considered necessary (22) that the models
at least demonstrate the following: configural invariance (i.e., the same
number of factors and indicators loading on the same factors), metric
invariance (i.e., the factor loadings are identical across groups), and scalar
invariance (i.e., the intercepts of the indicators are identical across groups).
Sequentially, more constrained models (i.e., configural only, con-
figural + metric, and configural + metric + scalar) across groups were
tested. 2 tests are reported, but results are considered consistent with
model invariance only if the most restrictive configural + metric + scalar
invariance was met as demonstrated both by adequate model fit and by
minimal change in model fit (comparative fit index [CFI], root mean square

error of approximation [RMSEA], standardized root mean square residual
[SRMR]) from less constrained models, with CFI < 0.01 being suggested
as one indicator of an invariant model (23). Residual variances were not
constrained to be equal across groups, as it is expected that variability
may differ between groups (e.g., participants in the youngest age group
may not have the same range on biomarkers as older adults may have).
Finally, if the bifactor model is correct, it should exhibit item parameter
invariance (24); that is, the same general and system-specific factor load-
ings should result regardless of the specific subset of biomarkers or sys-
tems assessed. This follows from the logic that if the items are indicators
of the latent factors specified, we should be measuring the same latent
factor regardless of which specific indicators are used, and so when some
items are dropped, the factor loadings of the remaining items should not
change (i.e., be invariant). To examine item parameter invariance, seven ad-
ditional models were fit. Each of the seven models started with the overall
bifactor model on all participants and systematically dropped one of the
seven systems by removing all the biomarkers of a particular system as well
as the system-specific factor. For example, one model was the bifactor
model without the inflammation system and dropped CRP, IL-6, fibrino-
gen, sE-Selectin, and soluble intracellular adhesion molecule 1, leaving
18 biomarkers, one common AL factor, and six system-specific factors.
Statistical Methods
Biomarkers were assessed for univariate normality, and log transformations
were applied to E, NE, standard deviation of beat-to-beat interval, RMSSD,
low-frequency spectral power, HFHRV, cortisol, DHEA-S, CRP, IL-6, sE-
Selectin, glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting glucose, HOMA-IR, and tri-
glycerides. Outliers were addressed by Winsorizing the lower and upper
0.5%. Because multivariate nonnormality remained despite these transfor-
mations, a robust estimator and standard errors were used. To address the
small amount (<3%) of missing data, full information maximum likelihood
estimation was used (25). Standard errors and model tests were adjusted for
nonindependence within families using clustered standard errors based on
the Huber-White "sandwich" estimator implemented in Mplus; thus, inde-
pendence is assumed among cluster units, not individual units.
Good model fit was chosen as the combination of the CFI > 0.95,
SRMR < 0.08, and RMSEA < 0.06 (26). Example Mplus input scripts
are available from the Standardizing Physiological Composite Risk End-
points Project Web site: http://score-project.org. Data management, de-
scriptive statistics, and transformations were conducted using R v. 3.1.1
(27) and Mplus v. 7.3 (Muthén & Muthén, Los Angeles, CA) via Mplus-
Automation v. 0.6­3 (28) for the structural equation models.
RESULTS
Participant age ranged from 34 to 84 years, with ap-
proximately equal numbers of women and men. Sample
characteristics and descriptive statistics for the biomarkers
(untransformed) are presented in Table 1. Based on prelim-
inary analyses, three modifications were made to all hy-
pothesized models. First, HOMA-IR was allowed to cross
load on both the lipid metabolism and glucose metabo-
lism factors. Second, heart rate was used as an indicator
of the PNS rather than the cardiovascular factor. Third, a
residual correlation between HFHRV and RMSSD was
allowed. No other modifications to the hypothesized models
were made.
Aim 1: Model Comparisons
Model fit indices comparing the two alternative models
(Fig. 2) are shown in Table 2. The second-order model
(Model 1) demonstrated acceptable fit, with two of three in-
dices meeting the criteria for good fit, although the CFI did
not (CFI = 0.928, RMSEA = 0.058, SRMR = 0.056). As
expected, the bifactor model (Model 2) demonstrated the
best fit to the data and met all criteria for good model fit
(CFI = 0.967, RMSEA = 0.043, SRMR = 0.028). The
bifactor model also fit significantly better than the second-
order factor model (2
(df = 36)
= 508.68, p < .001). These
results suggest that a common factor does underlie the indi-
vidual biomarkers, but that there are also unique, system-
specific effects.
Aim 2: Model Invariance
The fit of the bifactor model was tested across age (45,
45­60, >60 years) and sex (female, male) groups using
a multiple group model. Results from the configural,
configural + metric, and configural + metric + scalar invari-
ance tests are shown in Table S1, Supplemental Digital
Content 1, http://links.lww.com/PSYMED/A264, and sex-
specific loadings are shown in Figure S1, in Supplemental
Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/PSYMED/A264.
The configural + metric + scalar invariant models were
tested against the configural only model for sex. The
configural only model for age did not converge, so for

Invariance was tested for the best-fitting, bifactor model. Continuous age
and sex were included as covariates in all models, except that sex was
omitted as a covariate in the sex invariance model. n ranged from 1252 to
1254 due to missing data.

age, the configural + metric invariant model was used as the
comparison. For this reason, age group­specific loadings
also could not be shown as only the constrained models
converged, which by definition have identical loadings. Al-
though the configural + metric + scalar invariant model fit
statistically significantly worse for both age and sex (all p
values < .05), the change in fit indices was small for age
(CFI = 0.003, RMSEA = 0.001, SRMR = 0.002) and
sex (CFI = 0.007, RMSEA = 0.001, SRMR = 0.008).
In addition, the configural + metric + scalar invariant models
demonstrated good fit (all CFIs > 0.95, all RMSEAs < 0.06,
all SRMRs < 0.08). Thus, overall the results were consis-
tent with model invariance by age and sex. The final
configural + metric + scalar invariant model fit indices are
shown in Table 2.
Final Model Estimates
The standardized loadings of each biomarker on the
system-specific and common AL factor for the final overall
bifactor model are shown in Table 3. With the exception of
LDL, E, and DHEA-S, all biomarkers loaded significantly
and in the direction such that higher AL scores indicate
more physiological dysregulation. LDL and DHEA-S were
not statistically significant, and E loaded negatively on AL,
indicating that the higher the AL score, the lower E. Al-
though biomarkers from the PNS and cardiovascular (blood
pressure) systems loaded in the expected directions and
were statistically significant, loadings were small or mod-
est. In the bifactor model, most correlations among bio-
markers across systems will be captured by the common
AL factor, so as expected the estimated correlations among
the latent system-specific factors were generally small, with
the largest two between the HPA and SNS (r = 0.34) and
cardiovascular system (r = 0.23), with all other factor corre-
lations  0.20 (see Table 4 for details).
As a sensitivity analysis, the factor loadings from the fi-
nal bifactor model on only those 486 participants who were
medication-free are also presented in Table 3. In general,
the results are quite similar, with some additional nonsignif-
icant parameters due to the reduced sample size.
Finally, item parameter invariance was examined by
comparing the standardized loadings from the seven re-
duced models (each now with only six systems assessed)
to the full bifactor model. None of the loadings from the re-
duced models fell outside the confidence interval for the
overall bifactor model, and most exhibited minimal differ-
ences (Fig. 3). These results are consistent with what would
be expected if the model had item parameter invariance.
DISCUSSION
Across 23 biomarkers in a large sample of adults, a bifac-
tor model of AL provided both good fit and was the best-
fitting model. This result has two important implications.
First, it confirms what previous studies have demonstrated
that consistent with AL theory, a common factor under-
lies biomarkers of multisystem physiological functioning
(12­14). Second, it is the first study, to our knowledge, that
demonstrates that in addition to the common underlying
AL factor, individual physiological systems account for
unique variance in biomarkers not accounted for by the
common factor. Composites of biomarkers within a system
or factor scores from the second-order factor (Model
1) model will conflate system-specific effects and effects
of the common factor. Using a bifactor model (Model
2) provides an alternative and novel method that allows
the examination of either the common AL factor, the
system-specific factors unconflated from AL, or both.
Most loadings were in the expected directions, but
there were exceptions. Contrary to AL theory, E loaded
negatively on the common AL factor, although it corre-
lated positively with NE (r = 0.50), which did load posi-
tively on the AL factor. To our knowledge of the three
other studies that examined the factor structure of AL,
only one assessed E and found that it was not significantly
associated with AL (9). Cortisol also loaded negatively onto
the common AL factor, but it is less clear whether high or
low values of basal cortisol are desirable (e.g., Seeman
and colleagues (13) found that higher AL was associated
with a lower cortisol awakening response and flatter change
over the day). Alternatively, this may be unique to the
MIDUS study as participants had to travel to one of three
clinical research centers for the overnight stay when their
biomarkers were assessed, which may have affected their
overnight urinary cortisol.
Overall, the largest factor loadings for the common
AL factor were from biomarkers from the inflammation,
glucose, and lipid systems. Biomarkers in the SNS, PNS,
and cardiovascular (blood pressure) systems did not load
strongly on the common AL factor, but did load onto their
system-specific factors. These systems also had the strongest
correlations among the system-specific factors. Although AL
theory does not hypothesize stronger associations among
these systems than other systems, these results make sense
in that the biomarkers from these systems only load mod-
estly on the common AL factor, with more of their variance
accounted for by the system-specific factors, leading to
higher correlations among the system factors (although
none of these correlations are large). These results suggest
that for the SNS, PNS, and cardiovascular (blood pressure)
systems, it may be particularly important to examine their
unique effects beyond overall AL. By examining shared
and system-specific effects, we believe that this bifactor
model can facilitate greater precision in the next generation
of research. For example, different types of stressors (e.g.,
low-grade chronic stress versus traumatic stress) may be as-
sociated with higher allostatic, but show differential effects
on specific systems, such as SNS or PNS.

In a recent editorial, Gallo et al. (29) argued for a
need to standardize the measurement of AL and for re-
searchers to report on the specific components of AL. We
agree that the specific components of AL are important; in-
deed the bifactor structure suggests that specific physiolog-
ical systems account for additional variance in biomarkers
over and above AL. Using a method that allows both AL
and specific physiological systems to be used as indepen-
dent predictors or outcomes facilitates examining both
systemwide (AL) and system-specific effects. We believe
that using a bifactor model represents an important ad-
vance in psychosomatic research for untangling the rela-
tions between psychological factors and system-specific
and systemwide physiological dysregulation.
The results were consistent with item parameter invari-
ance for the bifactor model. The property of item parameter
invariance means that the system-specific and AL factor
loadings would not change regardless of the specific bio-
markers measured. Item parameter invariance is an im-
portant property that underlies methods such as computer
adaptive testing where not all participants are given the
same questions and yet they receive comparable scores on
the same underlying construct. If this result is replicated
and shown reliable, it has the potential to provide a path-
way to resolve discrepancies across studies due to different
biomarkers being measured by deriving scores on the same
underlying AL and individual system factors, even if the
exact subset of biomarkers assessed varies. Another im-
plication is that research that does not measure all 23 bio-
markers can still derive a comparable AL score, opening
the possibility of a "short" version of AL where fewer bio-
markers are assessed to save cost or participant burden.
However, one disadvantage of measuring fewer biomarkers
is that it may no longer be possible to obtain a score on a
particular system-specific factor. Furthermore, reducing the
number of biomarkers by leaving off specific biomarkers

or whole systems will reduce the reliability of both the com-
mon AL factor score and system-specific scores. To recom-
mend which biomarkers should be measured to optimally
measure AL, future research is needed to examine the rela-
tionships between AL scored from different biomarkers
and other constructs such as stress, physical functioning,
morbidity, and mortality.
We found that for the bifactor model, results were con-
sistent with what would be expected if it was invariant
between men and women, which is consistent with prior
research on AL comparing women and men (13), as well
as across age groups.
Limitations of the current study should be noted. The
sample was predominantly white, with fewer African
Americans and small numbers of other ethnicities repre-
sented. In addition, only basal levels of biomarkers were
assessed; future research is needed to examine relations
among functional measures of biomarkers (e.g., inflamma-
tory response to antigens). Finally, when testing measure-
ment invariance where the model fit is compared across
subgroups of the sample, many subgroups were small, and
in these multiple group models, the overall sample size
was small compared with the number of parameters and
complexity of our measurement model. However, with
1254 participants, this is one of the largest studies with ex-
tensive biomarker data available.
The study also has several important strengths. The cur-
rent study comprehensively assessed seven physiological
systems using 23 biomarkers. The use of many biomarkers
ensures that each of the seven systems is measured by more
than one biomarker, allowing us to differentiate effects
shared across systems and effects unique to systems. An-
other strength is the broad age range from 34 to 84 years.
Finally, the current study used careful statistical analyses in-
cluding the following: accounting for clustering in twins
and siblings in the MIDUS data, nonnormality of the bio-
markers, missing data, and investigating alternative theo-
retical models.
In conclusion, across 23 biomarkers in MIDUS, we
found evidence for a common AL factor, as well as for
seven system-specific factors, and this model held across
age groups and sex. Although our findings were consistent

with a model where AL was invariant across subpopula-
tions and invariant to dropping biomarkers from any one
system, these results do not preclude the possibility that
the measurement of AL may differ importantly by the sam-
ple or population being studied. Nevertheless, they do point
to the robustness of AL, and perhaps suggest that appar-
ently disparate sets of biomarkers used in many studies
may actually be more comparable than expected. Future
research is needed to examine the predictive effects of
AL and specific systems on health. Future research could
also explore whether for specific outcomes, such as partic-
ular diseases, or for different predictors, such as chronic or
acute stress, different profiles emerge across the common
AL factor and system-specific factors. To standardize the
measurement of AL as Gallo et al. (29) suggest, further
work is needed to reach consensus on how to define "opti-
mal" measures of AL and specific physiological systems
(e.g., predict disease incidence or mortality, and predict
functioning), and then to develop and validate sets of bio-
markers for each system and for AL overall--work that
is challenging given the great diversity of samples and pop-
ulations studied. Nevertheless, findings that the bifactor
model was consistent with item parameter invariance, if
replicated, open the intriguing possibility that just as in
computer-adaptive testing where not all participants com-
plete the same questions, yet can be given comparable
scores, it may be possible to obtain comparable AL scores
from different sets of biomarkers and perhaps begin to re-
solve concerns about the challenge interpreting the AL
literature when measurement is inconsistent.
