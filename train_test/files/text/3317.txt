Abstract: The MHC (major histocompatibility complex) is a group of genes that play a
crucial role in immune recognition and in tolerance of tissue grafting. The MHC has also
been found to influence body odors, body odor preferences, and mate choice in mice and
humans. Here we test whether verbal descriptions of human body odors can be linked to the
MHC. We asked 45 male students to live as odor neutral as possible for two consecutive
days and to wear a T-shirt during the nights. The odors of these T-shirts were then
described by five evaluators: two professional perfumers and three laymen. One of the
perfumers was able to describe the T-shirt odors in such a way that some of the allelic
specificity of the MHC was significantly revealed (after Bonferroni correction for multiple
testing). This shows that, although difficult, some people are able to describe MHC-
correlated body odor components.
Keywords: MHC (major histocompatibility complex), human leukocyte antigen, body
odor, odor perception, human.

Introduction
Odors are important components of our emotional life, and although the role of
odors in human mate choice and sexual behavior is not as well studied as it is, for example,
in rodents, it is clear that such a connection exists and that it is a complex one (Stoddart,
MHC and perfumers' descriptions of body odors
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 5(2). 2007. -331-
1990). A group of genes within the MHC (major histocompatibility complex) has been
demonstrated to be linked to body odors and odor preferences (reviews in Penn and Potts,
1999; Yamazaki and Beauchamp, 2005; Ziegler, Kentenich, and Uchanska-Ziegler, 2005).
The MHC is also one of the most polymorphic regions of the genome and plays a central
role in controlling immunological self and non-self recognition (Apanius, Penn, Slev, Ruff,
and Potts, 1997).
Human noses can distinguish between two congenic inbred mouse strains that differ
only in their MHC (Gilbert, Yamazaki, Beauchamp and Thomas, 1986), and rodents seem
to be able to recognize human MHC-types (Ferstl, Eggert, Westphal, Zavazava, and
Müller-Ruchholtz, 1992). Wedekind, Seebeck, Bettens, and Paepke (1995) found that
women's preference for male odors correlated negatively with the degree of similarity
between their own and the men's MHC type. T-shirt odors were judged as more pleasant
when they were worn by men whose MHC genotype was different from that of the judging
woman. This finding is analogous to findings in mice (Egid and Brown, 1989; Potts,
Manning, and Wakeland, 1991; Penn and Potts, 1998a; Roberts and Gosling, 2003;
Yamazaki, et al., 1976; Yamazaki, et al., 1988).
Furthermore, the odors of MHC-dissimilar men more frequently reminded the
women of their present or a former mate than did the odors of MHC-similar men. These
memory associations suggest that the MHC or linked genes still influence human mate
choice. A link between MHC alleles and body odor intensities could not be demonstrated
(Wedekind, Seebeck, Bettens, and Paepke, 2006). In a second set of experiments with new
combinations of T-shirt wearers and smellers, Wedekind and Füri (1997) found again that
dissimilar MHC types smell on average more pleasant than similar MHC types, and that
again according to the reported memory associations the MHC or linked genes influence
mate choice today. Moreover, when men and women sniffed male and female odors, there
was no significant effect of gender in the correlation between pleasantness and MHC
similarity. Ober, et al. (1997) then demonstrated in American Hutterites that married
couples were less likely to share MHC loci than expected by chance, even after incest
taboos were statistically controlled for, but the result could not confirmed in two other
human populations (Hedrick and Black, 1997; Ihara, Aoki, Tokunaga, Takahashi, and Juji,
2000).
Montag, et al., (2001) demonstrated that an "electronic nose", i.e. a chemical sensor
system combined with pattern recognition software, is able to detect MHC-dependent odor
components in mice and humans. Later T-shirt experiments confirmed a link between
MHC dissimilarity and the perception of odor pleasantness in humans (Santos,
Schinemann, Gabardo, and Bicalho, 2005; Thornhill et al., 2003), and a recent study on
romantic couples at the University of New Mexico suggests that as the degree of MHC
sharing increased, women's sexual responsivity to their partners decreased (Garver-Apgar,
Gangestad, Thornhill, Miller, and Olp, 2006). Here we test whether humans can describe
body odors in such a way that the link to the MHC is revealed.
Materials and Methods
We asked 45 male students (average age: 24.6 years, SD = 2.6), which we had typed
for their HLA-A, -B and -DR (methods in Wedekind, et al. 1995, see also Appendix), to
MHC and perfumers' descriptions of body odors

live as odor-neutrally as possible for two consecutive days, i.e. to use only perfume-free
soap that we had provided, to use only clothes and bedclothes that had been washed with
perfume-free detergent, to avoid a list of odor-producing food, to refrain from drinking
alcohol or smoking tobacco, and to avoid any activities that could potentially produce
disturbing smells (e.g., staying in smelly rooms, sexual activity, etc.). During the two
nights, they were asked to wear a T-shirt (100% untreated cotton) and to keep it in an open
plastic bag in between (we provided the bags). On the third day, these T-shirts were
wrapped one by one in a new plastic bag (first layer) and aluminum foil (second layer) and
stored at -78°C for later use.
Before the tests, the 45 T-shirts were thawed in 1.5 liter glass containers equipped
with a lid. Five evaluators (A, B, C, D and E), two of them professional perfumers
(evaluators A and B), then described the odors of the 45 T-shirts by opening these
containers and sniffing the content. The evaluators had no information about the MHC-
types of the odor donor, and they described the odors independently of each other using
their own personal vocabulary. Their evaluations were classified into groups of similar
descriptors by a person who was unaware of the MHC-types, with the help of the respective
evaluator (the descriptors are listed in Table 1; inconsistencies between the different lists of
odor descriptors reveal different kind of odor perception and/or subjective differences in
verbalizing odor components). The T-shirts were stored at -30°C in between the days of
evaluation.
In order to test whether the odor descriptions of a given evaluator correlated with
the MHC of the T-shirt wearers, we used the following statistical procedure: We recorded
for every possible pairwise comparison of two T-shirt wearers each (= 990 pairs) whether
their odors shared at least one descriptor (i.e. odor similarity for each pair was recorded as
0 or 1), and whether the T-shirt wearers shared more or less MHC antigens than expected
from the overall average (i.e. MHC similarity for each pair was also recorded as 0 or 1, the
average antigen sharing among all possible pairs was 1.3). To test whether the resulting 2
is significantly different from random, we compared it to a distribution of 2 that was
derived from randomly reassigned data (randomization test with 5000 permutations). The
test was done for each evaluator separately. Odor descriptions that were used only once by
an evaluator were excluded from this analysis. We calculated directed p-values because if
there is a significant link between odor descriptors and MHC-antigens, the 2 is expected to
be positive (see also Rice and Gaines, 1994, for a discussion of directed p-values). We
reduced the critical -value to 0.01 according to the number of tests we did to account for
multiple testing (Bonferroni correction).
Results
The evaluators differed in their average number of odor descriptors per T-shirt (Fig.
1a). Evaluator A (a professional perfumer) provided the most detailed and therefore the
most useful description of odors for the further analyses (Fig. 1a). Similarities in odor
descriptions given by this evaluator correlated with similarities in the MHC of the T-shirt
wearer (Fig. 1b) even after correcting for the fact that we had looked for such a correlation
in all five evaluators (Bonferroni correction). No significant overall connection between
odor description and MHC could be found in the other four evaluators. We therefore

concentrate on the descriptions of evaluator A only for all further analyses.
Figure 2 lists the odor descriptors of evaluator A in relation to their tendency to
correlate with the MHC, i.e. to the average number of MHC-antigens shared by the T-shirt
wearers whose odors were described with one of these descriptors. It appears that the
descriptors "spicy" and "mud, wet" correlated best to the MHC of the T-shirt wearers, and
the category "other" (that summarizes all descriptions that were used only once and could
not be attributed to one of the chosen descriptors) appeared to correlate worst to the MHC
(Fig. 2).
Figure 2: Odor descriptors of perfumer A relative to the average number of MHC-antigens shared by the T-
shirt wearers whose odors were described with one of these descriptors. The figure shows the mean deviation
(± SE) from the average number of MHC-antigens shared by all T-shirt wearers (= 1.3 MHC antigens), the
width of the boxes corresponds to the number of odors that were described with the respective descriptor (e.g.
"spicy": n=13, "other": n=6). Black boxes depict strong deviations from the null expectancy (one-sample
tests, "spicy": t = 3.56, p = 0.0004; "mud, wet": t = 2.71, p = 0.006, directed).
Table 2 lists the original vocabulary (in French) that the evaluator used and that was
associated with the descriptors "spicy" and "mud, wet", respectively. The table reveals that
these descriptors assemble quite a heterogeneous group of odors, although the global
analysis in Figure 1 detected a general association between these descriptors and the MHC.
None of the 13 men whose odor was described as "spicy" possessed the antigen HLA-A1, a
common antigen in the study population. However, these men carried the antigen HLA-A2
(another very common antigen) more often than expected by chance (Fig. 3). It further
appears that men with HLA-B14, a relatively rare antigen, smelled like "mud, wet" to the
evaluator. These and all further comparisons between observed and expected frequencies of

the most common HLA-A, -B, and -DR antigens are given for the two descriptors "spicy"
and "mud, wet" in Figure 3. In this figure, Z-values are used to weight sample size and
actual differences between observations and null-expectancies. These Z-values were
calculated using the formula
Z =
p - 
(1- ) / N
where p is the observed frequency,  the expected frequency under the null-expectancy,
and N the number of subjects in a group (Glass and Hopkins, 1984). This more detailed
antigen-specific analysis also indicates how much of the variance in the MHC is not, or
only weakly, connected to the odor descriptors: most Z-values are small and <2.

observation and null-expectancy, the figure gives the Z-values of a comparison between observed and
expected frequencies of HLA-A, -B, and -DR antigens in men whose odor was described as "spicy" (above)
or "mud, wet" (below). See text for the calculations of Z-values. Only antigens that could be found in at least
five T-shirt wearers are plotted (bold: n > 10). Positive Z-values indicate that an antigen may be more often
present than expected by chance, negative values indicate that the antigen may be less often present than
expected by chance.

Discussion
The evaluators reported huge difficulties in verbalizing the variation in human body
odors. This may explain why the three laymen and even one of two professional perfumers
who are used to evaluate and describe fragrances could not find enough odor descriptors
that would enable us to do a sensitive statistical analysis. Nevertheless, one evaluator found
on average more than three different descriptors per T-shirt. It turned out that these
descriptors provided enough information about the odors to link them significantly to the
MHC type of the T-shirt wearers (after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing).
Although the link between MHC and odor description was only significant in one of five
evaluators, our findings show that the association is possible, i.e. odors can, in principle, be
described in a way that the description is statistically linked to the MHC. Our more detailed
analysis suggests that some descriptors may be more closely linked to certain MHC
antigens than others. Such first observations offer testable predictions. However, most of
the variation in odor description remains still unexplained.
It seems obvious that the MHC cannot be the only correlate to human body odors
(Engen, 1982; Stoddart, 1990; Bestmann, Haberkorn, Vostrowsky, Eggert and Ferstl, 1994;
Sommerville, et al., 1994). Even an experimental procedure that controls for disturbing
odors of garlic, tobacco, etc. cannot get rid of, for example, potential age effects, of
components that reveal developmental stability (Gangestad and Thornhill, 1998; Rikowski
and Grammer, 1999; Thornhill and Gangestad, 1999), or of volatile steroid components
that may not be linked to the MHC (Singer, Beauchamp, and Yamazaki, 1997). When the
influence of many potentially confounding variables is experimentally reduced, up to 23 %
of the variance in pleasantness can be explained by the degree of similarity at the loci of the
MHC between T-shirt wearer and smeller (Wedekind and Füri 1997). In mice, the
estimates are even higher and reach up to 50% (Ziegler, Kentenich, and Uchanska-Ziegler,
2005). However, the pleasantness of one and the same body odor can be perceived very
differently by different individuals. In Wedekind and Füri (1997), when 121 students rated
the same six odors for intensity, pleasantness, and sexiness, all the odors received nearly all
possible scores from very unpleasant to very pleasant and from very weak to very intense.
The perception of human body odors therefore seems to vary enormously, i.e. the
descriptors used by evaluator A in the present study may therefore not work for other
evaluators.
Ehlers et al. (2000) and Younger et al. (2001) found a gene cluster that contains 36
olfactory receptor genes, of which two belong to the vomeronasal family. This cluster is
located at the telomeric end of the MHC complex. Thirteen of these genes were tested and
found to be polymorphic. Although the physiology of MHC-correlated body odors and
odor preferences is not well understood yet (Penn and Potts, 1998b; Ziegler et al., 2005),
this polymorphism, and the proximity of such a cluster of olfactory receptor genes to the
MHC, suggests that the olfactory receptor genes could somehow be involved in MHC-
related odor preferences. If so, the allelic diversity on these loci could partly be responsible
for individual differences in odor description.
Milinski and Wedekind (2001) tested in two experiments whether individual
preferences for perfume ingredients correlate with a person's MHC-genotype. They found a
MHC and perfumers' descriptions of body odors
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 5(2). 2007. -339-
significant correlation between the MHC and the scorings of scents in both tests. Different
people prefer different fragrances, and a statistically significant part of this variation is
linked to variation on the MHC and/or MHC-linked genes like (possibly) the olfactory
receptor genes described by Ehlers et al. (2000) and Younger et al. (2001). It should be
stressed, however, that the effect found in Milinski and Wedekind (2001) was a weak one,
i.e it is probably only detectable in large sample sizes. Also, there are obvious further facets
of the psychology of fragrance selection besides MHC-correlated odor preferences (Van
Toller and Dodd, 1991; Ohloff, 1992).
In conclusion, we found that MHC-linked odor components can be verbally
described, but that it appears to be very difficult to describe odors in sufficient detail to link
the description to the allelic specificity of the MHC. Moreover, there are good reasons to
assume that the perception of body odors differs between different evaluators. Descriptors
that work for one evaluator may therefore not work for another. Our results may help to
identify MHC-linked odor components that may then be chemically analyzed. A better
understanding of the chemistry of MHC-linked body odor components will eventually
contribute to an understanding of the physiology of MHC-linked odor production and odor
perception.
