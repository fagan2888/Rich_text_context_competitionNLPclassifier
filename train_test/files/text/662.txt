DataWatch
Young Physicians And The Future Of The Medical Profession
by Alan B. Cohen, Joel C. Cantor, Dianne C. Barker, and
Robert G. Hughes
The medical profession appears to be undergoing profound changes
that promise to shape its future. Some of these changes, such as the
increasing physician supply, the expanding proportion of women entering
the profession, and the declining numbers of medical school applicants,
have been well documented, although their causes and consequences are
debated.1 Other changes may be detected in anecdotal comments that
reflect an emerging malaise within the profession, a sense that something
may be fundamentally wrong. Changes in the organization and technol-
ogy of medical practice also appear to be altering traditional expectations
of physicians' roles. While the implications of these changes for the future
of medicine are uncertain, many analysts would agree that an important
transformation is under way.2 These changes are likely to have their
greatest impact upon young physicians who recently have completed
their training. It is these physicians who are making decisions that will
shape the profession for the next several decades.
In this DataWatch, we report on initial findings from a survey of young
physicians. The survey, performed by the American Medical Associ-
ation's (AMAs) Education and Research Foundation and funded by The
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, sought to examine young physicians'
specialty choices, the extent of their service to vulnerable populations,
and their ability to establish stable practice arrangements despite growing
economic and competitive pressures.3 Equally important, the survey was
intended to explore physicians' perceptions of current satisfaction with
medicine, where medical practice seemed to be headed in the future, and
what they expected their roles to be.
Study methods. The survey was designed to be representative of the
population of 68,351 young physicians in the United States during 1987,
based upon the AMA Physician Masterfile. "Young" physicians were

considered to be those under age forty who had been in practice more
than one but fewer than seven years after completing residency and/or
fellowship training. Most graduated from medical school between 1974
and 1984- The eligible survey sample contained 10,352 physicians,
consisting of a simple random sample of 8,651 physicians and an over-
sample of 1,692 black and Hispanic physicians. During the field period,
we could not reach or obtain telephone numbers for just over 10 percent
of the sample. Telephone interviews were completed between April and
November 1987 with a total sample of 5,865 young physicians (63.3
percent); 3,398 physicians (36.7 percent) refused or did not complete the
interview. The survey results we present have been statistically adjusted
to compensate for nonresponse bias associated with respondents' race/
ethnicity, age, country of medical school graduation (U.S. or foreign),
specialty, and AMA membership status; they are also limited to young
physicians who reported working at least twenty hours per week in patient
care (more than 90 percent of all young physicians).
To compare young physicians with older, more experienced physicians,
we use results from the AMA Socioeconomic Monitoring System Spring
1987 Survey. We categorize physicians not defined as "young" into two
groups: "prime" and "senior" (labels commonly employed by the AMA
in describing such physicians). Midcareer or "prime" physicians are at
least age forty or have been in practice seven to twenty-four years; "senior"
physicians have been in practice twenty-five years or more. We also use
the terms "white" and "black" physicians to denote, respectively, white
non-Hispanic and black non-Hispanic individuals; "other" physicians
include Asian/Oriental, Pacific Islander, American Indian, or Alaskan
Native. Educational debt figures reported here have been adjusted for
inflation and are stated in 1989 dollars.
Characteristics Of Young Physicians In Patient Care
Demographic composition. Despite aggressive admissions policies
aimed at increasing minority enrollment, blacks and Hispanics are still
underrepresented in medicine. Blacks, for example, constitute 12 percent
of the U.S. population but only 4 percent of the young patient care
physician pool. Hispanics make up 8 percent of the U.S. population, but
only 4 percent of young patient care physicians.
Although the percentage of young physicians who are women (21
percent) is markedly higher than either midcareer female physicians (10
percent) or senior female physicians (4 percent), women--who comprise
51 percent of U.S. college graduates--still only represent less than
one-quarter of the young physician population in practice. The propor-

tion of women entering medical school, however, has been rising, so that
one may expect their representation among young physicians to rise
accordingly in coming years.4
Representation in primary care. Young female physicians specialize in
primary care more often than their male counterparts (Exhibit 1 ).5 Higher
percentages of young black and Hispanic physicians choose primary care
specialties than either white or other young physicians. Three-quarters
of all young black female physicians practice a primary care specialty,
compared to 57 percent of young white female physicians.
Although a lower proportion of young physicians practice in a primary
care specialty than in a nonprimary care specialty (45 percent compared
to 55 percent), young physicians in our sample selected primary care
specialties more frequently than midcareer physicians (36 percent). How-
ever, a slightly higher percentage of senior physicians (48 percent)
specialize in primary care. This probably reflects the large number of
senior general practitioners who trained in an era before specialized
graduate medical education became the norm.
Incomes of young physicians. Primary care physicians earn signifi-
cantly lower incomes than other physicians. Annual median income
ranges from $60,000 for family/general practitioners and pediatricians to
$110,000 for anesthesiologists (Exhibit 2). Only primary care specialists
in obstetrics/gynecology earn above the median of $75,000. In contrast,
all but one of the nonprimary care specialties earn above $75,000 yearly.

a Overall median income.
Income differentials also exist between men and women, with the
median income of young female physicians $ 19,000 per year less than the
median income of young male physicians. These income differences are
due, in part, to specialty and employment setting choices. However, even
after controlling for specialty, employment setting, years in practice, and
hours worked per week, women still earn, on average, approximately
$15,000 per year less than men.
Employment status. More than half (54 percent) of all young physi-
cians are self-employed, in solo or group practice. Of physicians in the
second year of practice, 44 percent are self-employed, compared to 62
percent in the sixth year. Employment in public settings and in arrange-
ments with other physicians tends to drop with each year of practice. In
contrast, the percentages of physicians employed in health maintenance
organizations (HMOs), university settings, and private hospitals do not
change markedly among cohorts in the early years of practice.
Unlike other racial/ethnic groups, the majority of black physicians (57

percent) are employees. They are more likely than their peers to be
employed by HMOs, public institutions, and private hospitals and to
work in two or more practices. Although only 14 percent of all young
physicians work in multiple practices, 19 percent of young black physi-
cians practice in two or more arrangements. Physicians who work in
multiple arrangements have higher educational debt, earn lower income,
and are more often employed by others in their principal practice.
Educational debt at graduation. Educational debt at graduation, in
1989 dollars, ranges from none to more than $200,000. Over half (57
percent) of all young black physicians carry over $25,000 in educational
loans at graduation, far exceeding the proportions of white (41 percent),
Hispanic (36 percent), and other (14 percent) young physicians with
high debt levels. The low debt status of other young physicians may be
easily explained by the high percentage (75 percent) of "alien" foreign
medical graduates in this category. Only within this "other" category do
gender differences exist, with women in less debt than men.
The percentage of physicians with no educational debt at graduation
has decreased over time, from 33 percent for the oldest cohort in the
sample to 25 percent for the cohort completing training most recently.
In addition, the percentage of physicians with greater than $25,000 in
inflation-adjusted debt at graduation has increased over time, from 32
percent who completed training in 1982 to over 46 percent who com-
pleted training in 1985.
Populations served by young physicians. An examination of the
percentage of black and Hispanic patients served by young physicians
suggests that black and Hispanic physicians may serve disproportionately
in their respective communities. One-half of all patients seen by young
black physicians are black, compared to 16 percent of young white
physicians' caseloads (Exhibit 3). Similarly, Hispanic patients constitute
28 percent of young Hispanic physicians' caseloads, compared to 8
percent for young white physicians. Young physicians appear to care for
a higher percentage of poor patients in their practices (26 percent) than
either midcareer (20 percent) or senior (19 percent) physicians.6
Young Physicians, Perspectives On The Medical Profession
A concise way to measure the career perspective of young physicians
is to ask, "Given what you now know about medicine as a career, if you
were in college today, would you go to medical school?" Overall, 40
percent of young physicians reported that they would not or were not sure
that they would select a career in medicine (Exhibit 4). There is consid-
erable variation in levels of career satisfaction, as expressed in answers to

differences might emanate from disparate expectations about careers in
medicine among groups that only recently have had opportunities to
enter the profession, or from diverse practice patterns and opportunities
among the groups.
Young physicians report regret slightly less often than their older
counterparts; midcareer physicians are four percentage points more likely
to say "no" or "not sure" when asked if they would become physicians;
and the corresponding figure for senior physicians is seven percentage
points.7 These differences might be explained, in part, by the relatively
greater difficulty that older physicians experience in adapting to the
rapidly changing practice environment. On the other hand, the new
practice arrangements that increasingly are available to physicians enter-
ing practice today may offer more alternatives for young physicians to
find satisfying work arrangements.
Young physicians who are employees are slightly less likely to report
career dissatisfaction than those who are self-employed, although for
whom an employed physician works also makes a difference. The physi-
cians reporting regret most often are either self-employed but not part of
a group (44 percent) or employed by another physician (45 percent). At
the other end of the spectrum, fewer than one-third ofphysicians working
for private hospitals (30 percent) or for government agencies (32 percent)
report that they would not elect careers in medicine.
There is greater variation in career perspectives among specialties. At
the extreme, nearly half of anesthesiologists would not select a career in
medicine, compared to fewer than one-third of pediatricians. Physicians
earning less than $26,000 were less likely to express regret than their
higher-income colleagues (32 percent versus 40 percent). It is also
noteworthy, but not surprising, that physicians with high educational
debt at graduation (over $25,000) are more likely to express regret about
their decision to attend medical school (42 percent) than those with
lower debt (39 percent). Finally, those few physicians working in multiple
practices report regret less often (35 percent) than those working in one
practice (41 percent). This finding does not support the hypothesis that
working in multiple practices is an indicator of greater stress on young
physicians. It appears that answers to this question are affected, at least
in part, by young physicians' feelings about their current practice(s); 28
percent of those reporting "no" or "not sure" said they were likely to
change practices soon, compared to 20 percent of those reporting "yes."
Future outlook. A young physician's outlook on the future of the
profession may also reflect his or her career perspective. The survey asked
about the young physician's outlook over the next five years regarding
specialty income, the malpractice climate, and the influence of third-

party payers on medical practice. Ninety percent of respondents expected
the influence of third-party payers to increase; young physicians' expec-
tations on future income and the malpractice climate were more varied.
The survey took place before the Harvard University report on the
resource-based relative value scale (RBRVS) recommended a recalibra-
tion of physician fees under Medicare.8 The RBRVS recommendation,
which has been adopted by Congress, would reduce fees for procedure-
intensive practice (such as surgery and diagnostic tests) to increase
rewards for time actually spent with patients and for the cognitive work
ofdiagnosis and treatment.9 The three specialties that most often reported
an expectation of lower incomes in the future are among those that stand
to gain the most from the RBRVS plan (Exhibit 5). Likewise, the
specialties that least often expected lower fees in five years are among
those that stand to lose the most ground as the new plan is implemented
during the early 1990s.
Young physicians are pessimistic about the future medical malpractice
climate; nearly two-thirds report that it will be no different or worse in
five years. Minority physicians are somewhat more pessimistic than

whites. Seventy-eight percent of black and Hispanic physicians report
that, in five years, the malpractice climate will be the same as or worse
than it is today, compared to 62 percent of whites. Some specialties at
high risk of malpractice claims, not surprisingly, report greater pessimism.
Sixty-four percent of obstetricians, for example, report that malpractice
concerns will grow over the next five years.
The Future Of The Medical Profession
The survey results are simultaneously reassuring and unsettling. In the
aggregate, young physicians in our 1987 sample (1) appeared to enter
primary care practice in proportionately larger numbers than their mid-
career counterparts; (2) appeared able to build their medical practices
without great difficulty, attaining self-employment generally within a few
years following completion of training; and (3) did not appear to be overly
stressed by economic conditions in the marketplace. Each of these
conclusions, however, warrants closer examination.
The higher proportion of young physicians, compared to midcareer
physicians, who entered practice in family medicine, general internal
medicine, pediatrics, and obstetrics/gynecology seems reassuring. How-
ever, data from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC)
Medical School Graduation Questionnaire suggest that the next genera-
tion of young physicians may choose to enter primary care specialties less
frequently.10 Black and Hispanic physicians, especially women, are more
likely to enter primary care practice and to serve predominantly black
and Hispanic populations. It is unclear, however, whether they have made
these choices because of professional aspirations and altruistic motives or
because they may have experienced either overt or subtle forms of
discrimination that have effectively limited their opportunities.11
The apparent ability of young physicians, in general, to earn reasonable
personal incomes (median income of $75,000 per annum) and to become
self-employed (either in solo or group practice) after only a few years of
practice may dispel some of the concern that economic forces in the
environment are impeding their progress in practice building and forcing
some to leave medicine entirely. The fact that no more than 14 percent
of young physicians felt a need to seek multiple practice arrangements
actually augurs well for the profession. However, this observation must
be tempered with the knowledge that individuals with more than $25,000
in inflation-adjusted educational debt at the time of graduation were
more likely to engage in multiple practice arrangements than their peers
with lower debt levels.
Our survey does reveal some warning signs for particular segments of

DATAWATCH 147
the physician population. With incomes generally below the median
income for all young physicians, many more primary care physicians
(especially black physicians) may be in danger of encountering economic
stress in the near future. Potential reform of physician payment systems,
such as the recently adopted Medicare RBRVS method, would likely
benefit these physicians. However, implementation of this system is likely
to take some time, and it is unclear whether higher Medicare payments
to physicians will, by themselves, be sufficient to offset the demands of
an increasing debt burden for young physicians.
Perhaps most alarming is the finding that the youngest cohorts of young
physicians (that is, the most recent graduates) have higher proportions
of individuals with real debt in excess of $25,000 than do older cohorts.
This suggests that, unless potential remedies are devised (for example,
enhanced financial aid packages, reduced medical school expenses, and
so on), the increasing concentration of real educational debt may prove
to be a barrier to entry into the profession and may work counter to the
desired goal of increasing minority representation in medicine.
Finally, the finding that 40 percent of all young physicians claim that
they would not, or are not sure that they would, go to medical school is
disconcerting. This suggests that young physicians may become dis-
enchanted with medicine relatively early in their careers. In light of the
general decline in medical school applications over the past fifteen years
(notwithstanding the most recent data showing a one-year increase), a
discomfort level of 40 percent should not be taken lightly.12 As with any
survey involving self-reports, the findings here should be interpreted
cautiously, and further analysis of the data will be necessary to explore
the relationships between educational debt and young physicians' prac-
tice patterns. But lest these findings portend the future of medicine,
medical educators would do well to note the relatively gloomy outlook
held by many young physicians and to take appropriate steps to ensure
that positive gains, such as those in minority enrollment, are not eroded
in the changing climate of the 1990s.
