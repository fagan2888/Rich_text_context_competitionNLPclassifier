Using data from the 1990 Health Supplement to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we
examine the determinants of patterns of insurance coverage among the elderly. Among those
with supplemental insurance through an employment-based source, the primary determinant
of having insurance is work history, specifically job tenure and occupation of household heads
and their spouses. Among those who do not have employer-provided insurance, wealth is the
most important economic factor in the purchase of private insurance. Blacks, persons with less
education and women household heads are less likely to purchase supplemental insurance. We
find little evidence that persons in prior poor health are more likely to purchase supplemental
insurance, and the most important determinant of dental or drug coverage is having
employer-based insurance. The current trend toward decreased generosity of post-retirement
benefits implies that fewer older Americans will have insurance for these services.

Long-Term Determinants of Patterns
of Health Insurance Coverage
In the Medicare Population1

The Medicare program provides health insurance
coverage for virtually all elderly Americans. How-
ever, the program does not cover some important
types of medical services, including prescription
drugs, dental services and most long-term care. Ex-
penditures for these services, as well as the copay-
ments and deductibles under the Medicare program,
may result in significant out-of-pocket expenditures
for health care among older Americans. As a result,
many have private insurance coverage that supple-
ments Medicare. In 1987, 75% of persons aged 65
and older had private insurance coverage (Short,
Monheit, & Beauregard, 1989).
Employers are a major source of private insur-
ance coverage to supplement Medicare. Thirty-five
percent of the elderly in 1987 were covered by
employment-based insurance (Short et al., 1989).
Retiree health benefits were initially viewed by em-
ployers as an inexpensive benefit as they served
primarily to supplement Medicare. However, several
trends have made these benefits increasingly expen-
sive to employers. These include the rapid rise in
medical costs, the aging of the work force and the

trend toward earlier retirements. In 1993, the Federal
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) required firms to
include the present value of their retiree health liabil-
ity as a cost against current earnings since 1993.
Because these liabilities were so high and largely
unfunded, many firms are now considering decreas-
ing the generosity of their post-retirement health
benefits.
Post-retirement health insurance is a form of de-
ferred compensation offered by firms to their work-
ers. There are well known variations in the rate of
offers of retiree health benefits by industry, with
employers in some sectors, such as service indus-
tries, much less likely to provide these benefits than
those in other sectors, such as manufacturing (Karoly
& Rogowski, 1994). Larger firms are also more likely
to provide these benefits to their workers than small
firms. Most firms have eligibility requirements for
retiree health benefits. For instance, in a 1991 survey
of medium and large firms, 35% of firms have a
service requirement (e.g., a minimum tenure of em-
ployment) and 32% require that the retiree also qual-
ify for pension benefits (Bureau of Labor Statistics
[BLS],1993).
For those elderly who do not have access to health
benefits from current or former employers, private
insurance to supplement Medicare can be purchased
in the Medigap market. In 1980, federal legislation
was enacted which established minimum require-
ments for these policies after hearings in the late
1970s made it evident that there were abuses in the
market for supplemental insurance. The legislation,
known as the Baucus Amendment, became effective
314 The Gerontologist
in 1982. In addition to imposing minimum benefit
requirements, it also prevented policies from exclud-
ing pre-existing conditions for more than 6 months
and placed minimum limits on the amount of premi-
ums that had to be returned to policyholders in the
form of benefits (Cafferata, 1985). Recently, the Om-
nibus Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990 further regu-
lated the Medigap market, requiring all policies sold
to conform to one of ten types. All policies contain at
least core benefits which include coverage of all Part
A coinsurance for hospital stays over 60 days, the 20%
part B coinsurance, and the Parts A and B blood
deductible. Prescription drugs are covered under the
most comprehensive plans. Dental care is not in-
cluded in any of the plans. The legislation also raised
the loss-ratio requirements and established a six-
month open enrollment period for policy purchase
when a person turns age 65 (Rice & Thomas, 1992).
Prior studies have shown that the presence of
supplemental insurance among the elderly is related
to sociodemographic and economic characteristics.
The presence of private insurance is higher among
Whites and those with higher incomes and higher
levels of education, and decreases with age (Long,
Settle, & Link, 1982; Carfinkel, Bonito, & McLeroy,
1987; Rice & McCall, 1985). Health status is also an
important determinant of private insurance to sup-
plement Medicare, but the findings with respect to
health status are mixed. Garfinkel et al. (1987), using
data from the 1980 National Medical Care Utilization
and Expenditure Survey (NMCUES) find that, con-
trolling for sociodemographic and economic factors,
persons with chronic conditions are more likely to
have supplemental insurance. Rice and McCall
(1985), using a survey of Medicare beneficiaries in six
states, found that elderly persons in poor health
were less likely to have supplemental insurance than
persons in better health. Because private health in-
surance among the elderly is obtained from two
sources, employers and self-purchases, these results
combine the effects of various factors on the proba-
bility of owning these types of policies.
Several studies have addressed the determinants
of self-purchase of supplemental insurance. Taylor,
Short, and Horgan (1988), using data from the 1977
National Medical Care Expenditures Survey, showed
that the probability of self-purchase was also linked
to sociodemographic and economic characteristics,
being higher for Whites and persons with higher
incomes. They also found that, controlling for these
factors, persons in fair and poor health were much
less likely to purchase supplemental insurance than
persons in better health. Using the 1977 and 1979
Waves of the Retirement History Survey, Wolfe and
Coddeeris (1991) studied elderly persons who were
retired and neither Medicaid-eligible nor receiving
health benefits fully paid for by an employer or
union. Private insurance for these persons was either
individually purchased in the Medigap market or was
a retiree health benefit in which the retiree shared in
the cost of premiums. They found that, among eco-
nomic factors, wealth was an important determinant
of the possession of private insurance.
In this article, we study the long-term determi-
nants of insurance coverage among the elderly using
a new data source, the 1990 Health Supplement to
the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Because much
of the private health insurance among the elderly
comes from employers, we would expect that em-
ployment histories would be an important determi-
nant of the possession of this type of coverage.
Similarly, economic theory suggests that it is perma-
nent income, as opposed to current income, that
drives consumers' purchase decisions.
Another important issue with the purchase of in-
surance coverage is whether adverse selection oc-
curs. Elderly persons in poor health may be more
likely to purchase insurance since they anticipate
having higher medical expenditures. The results by
Taylor et al. (1988) suggest that adverse selection may
in fact be taking place in the Medigap market. Wolfe
and Coddeeris (1991) find some evidence of adverse
selection but conclude that its magnitude is small.
We consider the issue of adverse selection by includ-
ing lagged measures of health status as explanatory
variables in the insurance purchase equations.
Finally, because prescription drugs and dental care
are two important excluded services, we also study
the determinants of having coverage for these ser-
vices. Among elderly persons who use prescription
drugs, a large fraction of their cost (67%) is paid for
out-of-pocket, resulting in an average of 3.1% of
household income being spent on out-of-pocket ex-
penses for drugs (Rogowski, Lillard, & Kington,
1997). Similarly, most dental services are paid for out-
of-pocket. Among elderly users of dental care, 88%
of costs are paid for out-of-pocket. This results in
1.7% of household income being spent on dental
care (Kington, Rogowski, & Lillard, 1995). Thus, pri-
vate insurance coverage for these uncovered ser-
vices could significantly decrease out-of-pocket ex-
penditures by elderly households.
We use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
(PSID) to study the patterns of insurance coverage
within the Medicare population. The PSID data we
use contains longitudinal history on elderly respon-
dents for 22 years. It is thus possible to measure
employment histories, prior health status, and per-
manent income. In 1990, the PSID was supplemented
with a survey of elderly respondents regarding their
health insurance and health care expenditures.
These two data sources permit the examination of
the effect of long-term factors on the presence of
supplemental insurance among the elderly.
Methods
Data
This study uses longitudinal data from the Panel
Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), 1968-1990, on
work history, health history, and family demography
combined with newly available information on insur-
ance coverage and health status collected for elderly
respondents as part of the 1990 wave to study the

long-term determinants of supplemental insurance
coverage.
The PSID is a nationally representative (weighted)
longitudinal survey of households conducted by the
Survey Research Center at the University of Michi-
gan. Since 1968 the PSID has followed and inter-
viewed annually a sample that began with about
5,000 families, collecting information about the origi-
nal sample of respondents and members of their
households. The core survey collects detailed infor-
mation on income, work, unemployment, use of
public programs, demographic information, and
some measures of health and disability. Early waves
of the PSID collected information primarily on the
employment histories of household heads. In the
1976 PSID, retrospective histories were obtained for
all spouses of heads of household in the survey, thus
providing data for spouses that are nearly compatible
to that of heads of household. In 1990 the PSID data
was supplemented to collect detailed information on
health status, insurance, and health care costs of the
elderly. Information on health status and insurance
coverage were obtained in a mail-in survey. The
response rate to the mail-in survey was 74%. Com-
bined with the 22-year panel of information in the
core, it is possible to study the long-term determi-
nants of insurance coverage in the elderly.
Our analyses include 763 households for which
either the head or spouse is sixty-six or older and
complete data are available for insurance coverage,
work history and lagged health. Of these, 193 are
married couples for whom the health and insurance
data are available for both spouses; there are thus
956 persons represented (763 household heads plus
193 spouses). Of the 447 unmarried persons, 373 are
women. Selected socioeconomic characteristics of
individuals in the sample are reported in Table 1. A
small number of individuals who were known to be
residents of nursing homes and not living in the
household were dropped from the analyses, but
their core PSID data were used in the creation of
variables such as spousal employment history. Analy-
ses are weighted to reflect (a) the original 1968 sam-
pling weights for households, (b) panel attrition be-
tween 1968 and 1990, and (c) nonresponse to the
1990 mail-in survey. The procedure to develop
weights to correct for nonresponse follows that re-
ported in the PSID User's Guide, except that logit
rather than CART probabilities are used.
Analytic Measures
Insurance Coverage. -- We have assumed that all
individuals in this sample are insured by Medicare
based on the evidence that in 1991, 96% of persons
age 65 and older were covered by Medicare (Levitt,
Olin, & Letsch, 1992). The percentage in this sample
is probably even higher than in the general popula-
tion because the original 1968 PSID panel under-
represents immigrants, who are more likely not to
qualify for Medicare. The presence of supplemental
insurance, whether the insurance is employer-
provided or privately purchased, and whether it cov-

ers prescription drugs and dental services, are mea-
sured by responses to the 1990 mail-in survey.
Insurance coverage was ascertained separately for
each spouse for married couples. All sample persons
of age 50 and over who responded to the 1990 mail-in
survey were asked the insurance questions, includ-
ing whether insurance covers the spouse, so that
data on insurance coverage for almost all spouse
pairs are complete. Since insurance coverage is al-
most identical for matched men and women in mar-
ried couples in the PSID, in the multivariate analyses
we use a couple-based (household) measure of in-
surance coverage for married couples and an
individual-based measure for unmarried men and
women. There were a few inconsistencies in the
reports of husbands and wives about who is covered.
In these cases, we indicated coverage if either
spouse reported coverage, assuming a more knowl-
edgeable spouse would know.
Work History. -- Employment history is a poten-
tially important determinant of insurance coverage
through its effect on health insurance provided by
employers. The long history of employment and
work information available in the PSID allows us to
construct detailed measures based on twenty-three
years (waves) of panel data. Our measures focus on
the characteristics of the last job before first re-
tirement, or the current job if never retired, and
include (a) years of tenure with that employer, and
(b) indicator variables for aggregated occupation
groups on that job. These variables are thought to
influence the probability of post-retirement health
plan coverage. The last job was determined by first
identifying the first survey year in which an individ-
ual reported himself or herself to be retired. The last
job was then defined as the last identified job prior
to that survey year.
We use occupational groupings that were predic-
tive of employer-provided insurance, with different
aggregates for men and for women. We first esti-
mated each model by gender with indicators for each
of the occupational groups. We then collapsed all
occupational groups with significant coefficients into
a single category by gender, resulting in different
groups of occupational category indicators for men
and women. For men the occupational group indi-
cated by the variable in the models includes self-
316 The Gerontologist
employed businessmen, operatives and kindred
workers, laborers and service workers, and farmers,
farm managers, and farm laborers, relative to all
other occupations. For women the occupational
group indicated by the variable in the models in-
cludes professional, technical, and kindred workers,
and managers, officials and proprietors, relative to
all other occupations.
For unmarried men we use their own work history.
For married couples we include the work histories of
both the male head of household and of the wife. For
unmarried women, we use her own work history and
the work history of her former husband if she is
widowed within the panel period.
The distributions of years of tenure and occupa-
tional group indicators are presented in Table 2 for
men and women in the sample. Women tended to
have shorter periods of tenure with the last em-
ployer, and about half of the women were included
in the miscellaneous occupational category includ-
ing self-employed and housewives.
Economic Factors. -- Wealth is measured in the
1989 Wealth Supplement to the PSID and represents
total wealth for the couple or individual if single,
including housing. Permanent income is based on
the detailed longitudinal income histories in the
PSID, and represents the average income for the
couple or individual if single during the past five
years prior to 1990. The mean weighted household
wealth and permanent income for the sample of
individuals (n = 956) and standard deviations (SD in
parentheses) are respectively: $187,005 (SD =
$427,991) and $30,604 (SD = $32,555). The median
values are presented in Table 1. We include in the
estimation equations log values of all positive wealth
estimates, with negative and zero values set equal to
zero. Based on evidence that respondents who fail to
provide wealth data may be different from other
respondents, we have also added to each model that
includes the wealth variable a dummy variable indi-
cating that the wealth data were missing for that
observation and imputed with the sample mean. In
several equations, the coefficient for this variable
was significant. Data on the urbanicity of the location
come from the Area Resource File of the Department
of Health and Human Services. The variable mea-
sures the percent of the county population that re-
sides in an urban area.
Lagged Health Status. -- We include several mea-
sures of lagged health status. First, we include varia-
bles indicating the presence of seven common
chronic conditions that were reported in the 1990
Health Supplement to have been present for at least
five years. These conditions are (mean weighted
prevalence for sample of individuals in parentheses):
arthritis (.37), congestive heart failure (.08), angina
(.08), lung disease (.08), ulcers (.06), diabetes (.07),
and hypertension (.32).
We also included a mean of three years of self-
reported general health status as measured by an
index of general health based on an ordinal five-

point scale which was asked as part of the PSID core
surveys in the years 1984-1986, a period of time
centered at approximately five years prior to the
survey. The question in each year was: Would you
say your health in general is excellent (5), very good
(4), good (3), fair (2), or poor (1)? The lagged general
health measure is an average value of these ordinal
reports with a higher score indicating better health.
The weighted mean value for this measure in the
total sample of male and female individual respon-
dents were, respectively, 2.97 (SD = 1.04) and 2.83
(SD = 1.04).
Finally, we included an index based on a series of
questions on functional status asked in the 1986
survey. Individuals reported limitations in each of
the following activities due to health: limitations
walking several blocks or climbing a few flights of
stairs; limitations bending, lifting, or stooping; limi-
tations driving a car; requiring assistance traveling
around the community; staying indoors most or all
of the day; and confined to bed or chair most or all of
the day. A simple count of these restrictions was
determined for each individual with a higher score
(indicating worse function). The mean score for the
lagged functional status measure in the total sample
of male and female individual respondents were,
respectively, .91 (SD = 1.26) and 1.27 (SD = 1.56).
For both the lagged general health measure and
the lagged functional status measure, for insurance
equations in which the unit of analysis is a household
(n = 763) both measures were entered separately by
gender for heads and spouses in the households. For
chronic conditions, a condition was present if either
spouse in the household reported the condition. For
households with only a head and no spouse, the
head's lagged general health, functional status, and
chronic condition measures were used.
Modeling Insurance Coverage
Our model includes equations for four aspects of
health insurance coverage. The four health insur-
ance equations estimated the probability of report-
ing: (a) employer-provided health insurance, (b)
privately-purchased health insurance, given no
employer-provided coverage, (c) health insurance
covers prescription drugs, given insurance coverage,
and (d) health insurance covers dental, given insur-
ance coverage. We consider the model for each of
Vol. 37, No. 3,1997 317
these relationships in turn, including their inter-
relationships. We use a probit formulation so that
each of the four binary outcomes is determined by a
probit index function.
Employer-Provided Health Insurance Coverage. --
For each household in the sample we consider
whether the couple or person has employer-
provided health insurance, which is denoted by a
binary indicator EHj. The probit index function deter-
mining coverage is given by:
eh, -0,0 + <*vK + aJjEMP, + uv
The household is covered if the index is positive,
and zero otherwise, i.e.:
kM'~
1 if eh? > 0
Explanatory variables included in vector X are edu-
cation, race, and age of the head of household,
marital status and female headship if unmarried.
Economic factors include household income and
household wealth. The measures of employment
history constructed using the long history of the
PSID panel are indicated by vector the EMP. These
include job tenure and occupation on the last job
before retirement, but the men's and women's occu-
pational aggregates are different. For unmarried men
the equation includes his last tenure and occupation.
For unmarried women the equation includes her last
tenure and occupation. If the observation is for a
couple either currently married or for a woman wid-
owed within the PSID panel period, both the hus-
band's and wife's work history variables are in-
cluded. We hypothesize that employment histories
will be important determinants of employer-
provided coverage because employer offers of post-
retirement health benefits vary by industry and many
employers who do offer benefits have service re-
quirements. The equations also include a variable for
marital status to account for any shift due to there
being two persons rather than one.
Self-Purchased Health Insurance Coverage. --
Given that the person does not have employer-
provided insurance {EH, = 0), the person has self-
purchased (Medigap) health insurance if
sph? = a20

is positive, and zero otherwise, i.e.:
Mifsp/ifX)
The decision-making model is then sequential pro-
bit, since a household purchases private health cov-
erage only if not covered by an employer policy.
The purchase of private insurance coverage is
modeled as a function of economic, sociodemo-
graphic, and health factors including education,
race, and age of the head of household, marital
status and female headship if unmarried, and mea-
sures of wealth, permanent income, and urbanicity
of the residential location for the household.
We are interested in determining whether there is
adverse selection into privately-purchased policies.
To this end, we include the measures of lagged
general health status and functional status and the
lagged presence of common chronic conditions
(vector Y). The decision to purchase insurance is
made prior to the date at which elderly respondents
were surveyed. Because of the longitudinal nature
of the data used for the study, it is possible to ob-
serve health status for five years prior to the inter-
view window. If there is adverse selection into
individually-purchased policies, we would expect
the purchase of these policies to be positively associ-
ated with lagged measures of poor health.
The probit equations for employer-provided and
for privately purchased health insurance coverage
may not be independent; there may be unobserved
factors which influence both, so that not having
employer insurance is not a random selection with
respect to private insurance purchase. We tested for
correlation between the two probit equations and
could not reject independence.
Whether Health Insurance Coverage Includes Pre-
scription Drugs. -- Given that the person has health
insurance coverage (EH, = 1 or SPH, = 1), the person
has coverage for prescription drugs if

One of the key variables explaining coverage of pre-
scription drugs is expected to be whether health
insurance is employer-provided or self-purchased.
There is evidence that few individually purchased
policies contain prescription drug benefits. A study
by Long (1994) found that among privately purchased
policies, only 19% covered prescription drugs. This
compared to 92% of employer-provided policies.
Employer policies typically provide the same benefits
to retirees as to active workers and thus tend to cover
prescription drugs. We hypothesize that the majority
of prescription drug coverage will be associated with
the source of coverage being an employer.
Whether Health Insurance Coverage Includes Den-
tal Care. -- Given that the person has health insur-
ance coverage (EH, = 1 or SPH, = 1), the person has
coverage for dental care if

One of the key variables explaining coverage of den-
tal services is also expected to be whether health
insurance is employer-provided or self-purchased.
Few elderly persons (13%) have insurance coverage
for dental services (Kington et al., 1995). We hypoth-
esize the presence of dental coverage is largely asso-

Results
Table 3 describes the overall pattern of insurance
coverage for the entire sample of individuals and by
important demographic categories, including age,
gender, race, and education. The table illustrates the
distinctive patterns of insurance coverage among de-
mographic groups. In general, older persons, less
educated persons, and women were less likely to
have any supplemental coverage and less likely to
have employer-provided coverage, and older persons
were less likely to have either dental or drug cover-
age. The pattern for Blacks compared to non-Blacks
was particularly noteworthy. Blacks were almost half
as likely to report any supplemental insurance com-
pared to non-Blacks, but if they reported any supple-
mental coverage, they were almost 75% more likely to
report employer-provided coverage. Although higher
percentages of Blacks reported both dental and drug
coverage, only the difference in dental coverage
reached marginal statistical significance.
The following three tables (Table 4-6) present the
coefficients and standard errors for a series of probit
equations that provide insights into underlying rela-
tionships that might explain some of the patterns
observed in Table 3.

pation on the last job before retirement or current
job if not retired -- in the equation for employer-
provided insurance. This information is highly sig-
nificant in the determination of employer coverage
-- for men and women. Men in their indicated occu-
pational grouping (self-employed businessmen, op-
eratives and kindred workers, laborers and service
workers and farmers, farm managers and farm labor-
ers, relative to all other occupations) are significantly
less likely to have employer-provided insurance cov-
erage, and women in their indicated grouping (pro-
fessional, technical and kindred workers, managers,
officials or proprietors, relative to all other occupa-
tions) are more likely to have employer-provided
insurance coverage. The probability of receiving
employer-provided benefits also increases with job
tenure on the current or former job for men but not
for women. These results are consistent with the fact
that retiree health benefits generally have job tenure
requirements associated with eligibility. There are
also well known variations in employer offers of
retiree health benefits by industry (Karoly & Ro-
gowski, 1994).
In addition, households headed by less educated
persons are significantly less likely to have employer-
provided health insurance, even after controlling for
work history, and the receipt of employer-provided
insurance decreases with the age of the household
head. This is likely related to the fact that older
cohorts of workers were less likely to have been
offered these benefits by their former employers. Of
the sociodemographic variables, marital status was
among the strongest predictors. For example, the
estimated probability of having employer-provided
insurance for a household with a married head and
with otherwise mean characteristics for the sample
was about 36%. This probability decreased to about
18% for a household headed by a person not married
and with the mean characteristics for the sample.
Self-Purchased Private Insurance
Estimates of the parameters of the self-purchased
insurance equation are presented in Table 5. For
those without employer-provided insurance, self-
purchased coverage is significantly associated with
sociodemographic and economic factors. While per-
manent income does not have an effect on the pur-
chase decision, wealth does have a significant effect.
These findings are consistent with the hypothesis
that wealth may be a better measure of financial
resources than permanent income in this population
(Hurd, 1989). Female household heads and blacks
are less likely to obtain self-purchased insurance,
and elderly persons living in more urbanized areas
are more likely to purchase insurance. Households
headed by less educated persons are also much less
likely to purchase a private policy. Taking these
results in combination with the results for employer
insurance, the households headed by less educated
persons are much less likely to have any private
health insurance overall. The differences in esti-
mated probabilities for having self-purchased insur-

in the demand for medical care is related to the
potential effects of lagged health on the decision to
obtain self-purchased health insurance, since cur-
rent and lagged health status are correlated. The
effects of the lagged general health index, functional
status, and chronic conditions on the probability of
having self-purchased supplemental health insur-
ance are reported in Table 5. Lagged general health
and lagged functional status had no effect. Similarly,
the presence of most common chronic conditions in
either a head of household or spouse had no effect
with the exceptions of having had an ulcer or diabe-
tes five years or more. About 6% in this population
had had an ulcer that long and about 7% had had
diabetes that long. The Baucus Amendment, which
was in effect during the study period, did not permit
policies to exclude pre-existing conditions for more
than 6 months. Thus, the results presented here are
likely to be demand effects as opposed to supply
effects. These results suggest that there is relatively
little adverse selection in the self-purchase of private
supplemental insurance.

Coverage for Prescription Drugs and Dental Services
Table 6 presents coefficients for probits predicting
drug and dental coverage with and without the
lagged health variables. For those who do have a
private health insurance policy, by far the strongest
and most significant determinant of coverage of ei-
ther prescription drugs or of dental services is
whether the policy is employer-provided. These
results are consistent with the fact that many employ-
ers structure their retiree health benefit plans to
mirror benefits provided to active workers.
Net of the effects of the insurance being employer-
provided, elderly persons living in urban areas are
more likely to have prescription drug coverage. The
results for education in the equations for drug cover-
age were somewhat surprising. For unclear reasons,
persons with less than college education were more
likely to report drug coverage. For both dental and
drug coverage, men with better lagged general
health were more likely to report coverage, and
households with hypertension were less likely to
report dental coverage.
Discussion
This study takes advantage of the unique longitudi-
nal employment histories and the supplemental
health and insurance data of the PSID to demonstrate
the importance of several dimensions of long-term
employment patterns in determining the patterns of
health insurance coverage among older adults. Pri-
vate insurance among elderly persons derives from
two primary sources -- employers and self-purchase
of insurance in the Medigap market. For elderly
persons who purchase insurance in the Medigap
market, the decision to purchase is related to socio-
demographic and economic factors. There are large
racial differences in the probability of insurance pur-
chase. Controlling for income and other factors
known to affect insurance purchase, Blacks are less
likely to buy these policies than Whites. Female
household heads and elderly persons with lower
educational levels are also less likely to purchase
insurance. The purchase of insurance coverage is not
related to permanent income but instead to wealth.
This is consistent with the findings of Wolfe and
Goddeeris (1991) and with the observation by Hurd
(1989), that wealth may be a better overall measure of
financial resources for the elderly.
Elderly persons who are in poor health may be
more likely to purchase private supplemental poli-
cies, as they attempt to insure against future high
medical expenses. The prior literature has been in-
conclusive about the effect of health status on the
likelihood of having private insurance in old age. We
find relatively little evidence in support of adverse
selection being an important factor in the purchase
of insurance in older populations. Neither a lagged
general measure of health nor a lagged general mea-
sure of functional status nor the presence of most
common chronic conditions for at least five years are
significantly related to the purchase of private insur-
ance. The only evidence was the finding that the
presence of ulcers or diabetes for more than five
years in a head or spouse was predictive of a lower
probability of purchasing insurance. Since the
Baucus Amendment, which was in effect during our
study period, prohibited Medigap policies from ex-
cluding pre-existing conditions for more than six
months, this effect is likely driven by the demand
side of the market rather than the supply side.
Perhaps our most important finding concerns the
relationship between several dimensions of long-
term employment patterns and insurance. Employ-
ers are an important source of private insurance
coverage for the elderly, as they are for younger
populations. The primary determinant of having cov-
erage through an employer even in this age group is
work history, including both tenure and specific oc-
cupational categories. The fact that employer insur-
ance coverage varies by current or former occupa-
tion is consistent with the fact that firm offers of
postretirement insurance coverage vary by industry.
Industries with high rates of health insurance offers
to active workers, such as manufacturing, also have
high rates of retiree health benefit offers. Those with
low rates of health benefits to active workers, such as
the service industries, also have low rates of retiree
health offers (Karoly & Rogowski, 1994). The receipt
of insurance through a current or former employer
also decreases with age, probably due to the de-
crease in the number of active workers with age as
well as the lower likelihood that retiree health bene-
fits were an employment benefit for older cohorts of
workers.
Education also proved to be a consistent important
predictor of coverage. Controlling for work history,
persons with lower educational levels are less likely
to have insurance through an employer. Combined
with the fact that less educated persons are also less
likely to purchase insurance, this results in lower
rates of private insurance coverage for this segment
of the elderly population. For those who do have a
private health insurance policy, by far the strongest
and most significant determinant of coverage of ei-
ther prescription drugs or of dental services, two
services not covered by Medicare, is whether the
policy is employer-provided -- employer policies are
much more likely to cover drugs or dental services.
The evidence presented in this study suggests that
employment histories are the most important long-
term determinants of private insurance coverage
among the elderly, and this finding may have impor-
tant implications for future patterns of health insur-
ance coverage among the elderly population. Since
employers are now decreasing the generosity of
their retiree health benefit offers, it is likely that
future cohorts of the elderly will have to rely increas-
ingly on the Medigap market for insurance coverage.
As a result, fewer will have coverage for such ex-
cluded services as prescription drugs and dental
care, which can result in significant out-of-pocket
expenses for elderly households. These changes in
patterns of coverage may lead to an increase in the
financial burden associated with medical expenses
