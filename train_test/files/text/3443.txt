Abstract
It has been documented that about 20% of children and adolescents suffer from a diagnosable mental or addictive disorder
in the United States. The high prevalence of children's emotional and behavioral problems (EBP) might have a negative effect
on their mothers' labor market outcomes because children with EBP require additional time for treatment. However, these
children may require additional financial resources, which might promote mothers' labor supply. Previous studies have only
considered chronic conditions in analyzing the impact of children's health on parental work activities. Moreover, most of
these studies have not accounted for endogeneity in children's health. This article estimates the effects of children's EBP on
their mothers' labor supply by family structure while accounting for endogeneity in children's health. We used the 1997 and
2002 Child Development Supplements (CDS) to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). We used probit and bivariate
probit models to estimate mothers' probability of employment, and tobit and instrumental variable tobit models to estimate
the effects of children's EBP on their mothers' work hours. Findings show negative effects of children's EBP on their married
mothers' employment and on their single mothers' work hours.

Introduction
Concerns over the social and economic consequences of
highly prevalent childhood emotional and behavioral prob-
lems (EBP) have become increasingly important. In fact, it
has been documented that about 20% of children and adoles-
cents in the United States suffer from a diagnosable mental
or addictive disorder.1 In addition to their enduring effects
across the life span and generations, childhood psychiatric
disorders place an enormous burden on society, communities
and families.2 Parents, particularly mothers, face serious dif-
ficulty in balancing daily activities such as employment,
child care, and parent-child relationships because they must
invest a considerable amount of time and economic resources
in these children. The high prevalence of children's EBP
might have a negative effect on their mothers' labor market
outcomes because children with EBP require additional time
for treatment. However, these children may require addi-
tional financial resources, which would promote their moth-
ers' work activities.
There is a long-standing literature in the economics field
on the impact of children's disabilities or other chronic con-
ditions on their parents' work activities, particularly, the
effects of children's health on their single mothers' employ-
ment.3-19 This literature is not conclusive for single mothers
and shows a wide range of reductions from 5% to
30%.3,4,6,10,13-19 Findings are more consistent across the small
number of studies that have examined the impact of chil-
dren's chronic illnesses on married mothers' employ-
ment.3-5,10-12 More recent studies which have used richer data
sets and larger sample sizes and have accounted for endoge-
neity in children's health including omitted variables bias are
more consistent in their findings. They have consistently
found negative effects of children's health on mothers' work
activities ranging from 10% to 16%.13,14,20-25 However, only
a few studies have either considered mental health symptoms
in addition to general chronic health conditions in analyzing
children's health on parental work activities7,8 or have exam-
ined the effect of having any household family member with

mental illness, including children, on single and married
mothers' work hours.14,17,18
Focusing on the most recent literature which seeks to
understand the impact of children's health on parental work
activities, there are four articles that are relevant to this
study.26-29 Two of these articles used different measures of
child health such as birth weight, physical disabilities, and
mental, emotional, sensory, and cognitive disabilities to
examine the relationship between child health and mother's
labor supply.26,28 Both studies found that having a child in
poor physical health reduces single mothers' probability of
working from 2 to 8 percentage points and from 1 hour to 3
hours per week for employed mothers. Similar but smaller
effects were found for married women. However, the effects
of child health on mothers' work activities were less strong
for those mothers with a child who suffered from a disabling
mental, emotional, sensory, or cognitive condition.26,28
Other studies have examined the long-term effects of chil-
dren's health on parental labor supply. For instance, Kvist et
al. examined the relationship between children's attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and parents' labor
supply using data from the Danish Psychiatric Central
Register.29 The authors found that parents of children diag-
nosed with ADHD have a 7% to 13% lower probability of
labor supply 10 years after the child's birth, compared with
their counterparts with non-ADHD children.29
The study most closely related to our study was the one
conducted by Coley et al.27 The authors used a sample of low-
income mothers and early adolescent children (aged 10-14)
from theThree-City Study (Boston, Chicago, and SanAntonio)
to examine the relationship between adolescent behavioral and
psychological functioning and maternal labor supply such as
employment status and duration of employment. They used a
shortened version of the Brief Symptom Inventory to measure
adolescents' symptoms of depression, somatization, and anxi-
ety. They also used items derived from the National
Longitudinal Study of Youth and the Youth Deviance Scale to
describe adolescents' behavioral problems. Employment sta-
tus indicated whether or not mothers were employed at the
time of the survey. Weeks and months of employment were
assessed by using the number of weeks or months during the
previous 6 months when mothers were employed in their pri-
mary jobs. The study found that greater psychological distress
among adolescents predicted a lower likelihood of employ-
ment for mothers (fewer hours worked, fewer months worked,
and lower earnings), and a greater likelihood of having lost
hours in the previous week. They also found that adolescent
delinquency and disabilities were less consistent predictors of
mothers' lower employment effort.27
While these studies provided some insights regarding the
impact of children's health on their mothers' work activities,
the current study contributes to the literature in several ways.
First, it focuses on the impact of having a child between the
ages of 4 and 18 who is suffering from EBP on their mothers'
labor supply (employment and work hours). As the literature
review above shows, there are no previous studies focusing
on this area. It is important to examine the effects of chil-
dren's EBP on parental work activities for children of differ-
ent ages because children require different amounts of time
and resources from their parents for the production of their
well-being at different ages. Second, this study uses rich and
nationally representative data sets. Third, it accounts for
issues of endogeneity such as omitted variables biases and
reverse causality between children's EBP and their mothers'
labor supply. More specifically, this article estimates the
effects of children's EBP on (1) their mothers' employment
status and (2) work hours for single and married mothers.
We hypothesize that mothers with children who suffer
from EBP are more likely to reduce their labor supply com-
pared with mothers whose children are free from EBP. We
further hypothesize that these effects are larger on married
mothers'labor supply compared with single mothers because
of the flexibility provided by the presence of fathers in two-
parent families. It is important that policy makers, clinicians,
and researchers understand these effects because of the role
that parents' labor income plays in shaping children's health,
educational, and economic trajectories.9
Materials and Methods
Conceptual Framework
The study focuses on the extent to which U.S. households with
children affected by EBP withdraw time from market activi-
ties to reallocate it to the production of their child's mental
well-being. Based on insights from Becker's intra-family allo-
cation framework and from Grossman, we hypothesized that a
child's mental well-being is a commodity produced in the
house with some combination of time and medical care and
services based on parental preferences, time, income, and bud-
get.30,31 The key implication of this framework is that maternal
employment depends on changes in children's mental health
endowment as well as the marginal productivity of the inputs
used to produce mental well-being in the child. For instance,
an increase in the child's EBP would increase the use of medi-
cal goods and child care services, which might increase the
mother's labor supply to compensate for additional income
needs. However, this situation would impose a greater demand
on the mother's time. Mothers may reduce their labor supply
because they are able to provide more effective and efficient
services to their child with EBP than alternative child care pro-
viders. We hypothesized that the net effects are a reduction in
the mother's labor supply.
Data Sources
We pooled two waves of data from the Child Development
Supplements (CDS) of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
(PSID) collected in 1997 and 2002 and combined these CDS
files with the family and individual files from the PSID. The
Richard et al. 3
PSID is an ongoing nationally representative panel survey
that has been collecting detailed socio-economic and socio-
demographic data such as employment, income, and marital
status from individuals and households in the United States
since 1968. The PSID added the CDS to its core data in 1997
and 2002 to understand the socio-demographic, psychologi-
cal, and economic aspects of childrens' lives. Both waves of
the CDS randomly sampled up to two children per PSID fam-
ily. CDS-I collected information from the primary care givers
(PCGs) on 3,563 children ranging in age from 0 to 12. CDS-II
collected information on households that remained in the
sample through 2001, including 2,907 children ranging in age
from 5 to 18. For both waves of the CDS, the PCGs provided
information on their children's health, behavior, cognitive
ability, socio-emotional development, home environment,
and child care arrangements. The response rates for the PCGs
were 88% in 1997 and 89% in 2002, and the response rates
for children were approximately 81% for both waves.
Evidence from a number of methodological studies to assess
the quality of the PSID has indicated that issues such as attri-
tion in the CDS-PSID may not make the survey less represen-
tative.32,33 For instance, Duncan and Hill found that the key
survey measures from the PSID are generally unbiased and
contain small amounts of measurement-error variances when
compared with validated data such as the CDS.32 Although
the CDS data were collected after the studies by Duncan and
Hill, there is no reason to believe that the CDS would be
biased because of measurement errors. Furthermore, we com-
bined data from the CDS with the core sample in which
Duncan and Hill found small measurement errors.32
The Analytic Sample
Mothers are the unit of analysis in this study. CDS-I contains
information on 2,233 PCGs and CDS-II contains information
on 2,006 PCGs. For CDS-II, 1,905 PCGs had positive
weights. We restricted the sample to households with children
aged 3 years or older because the CDS only collected mental
health information for these children. This resulted in 3,485
pooled observations for CDS-I and CDS-II. We used the
PSID Family Information and Mapping System (FIMS) to
identify the siblings of CDS-I and CDS-II eligible children, as
well as their EBP status. All eligible children and their sib-
lings were interviewed in about 80% of the households
(81.4% for married mothers and 78.8% for single mothers).
The majority of the households had either one or two chil-
dren. In addition, we included information on the EBP status
of siblings in the remaining 20% of family units with two or
more children. We excluded PCGs who were fathers or other
relatives to restrict the sample to biological mothers, adoptive
mothers, and stepmothers. Because we are interested in labor
market activities, we restricted the sample to mothers aged 24
to 55 years old for a total sample size of 2,916.
We used two dummy variables to define family structure.
By default, the PSID designates the male as the head of any
two-parent household, which means that a female is only
designated as head of household when she is not currently
married. Thus, married/cohabitating mothers were com-
prised of biological mothers, adoptive mothers, and step-
mothers as long as both parents lived in the same household.
All other mothers formed the category of single mothers.
This produced an analytic sample of 2,007 married mothers
and 909 single mothers.
Labor Market Measures
Employment status (P) and work hours (H) are our labor
market outcomes of interest in this study. The variable P is
binary and equals 1 if mothers reported an employment sta-
tus of "working now, temporarily laid off, or on maternity
leave." The variable H is continuous and represents the total
hours that mothers worked for the past 12 months. Given the
skewness in the distribution of work hours, this variable was
log-transformed.
Measures of the Child's EBP
The CDS used 30 items selected from the Achenbach Child
Behavior Checklist (CBCL) to collect children's EBP data
for 1997 and 2002 from the PCGs.34,35 The CBCL, initially
tested on a large number of children with EBP, is a gold stan-
dard and widely used tool completed by parents to assess
their children's EBP over the preceding 6 months. This
instrument has been validated in a variety of languages and
socio-economic groups.34-36
The CDS computed total scores for two subscales of syn-
dromes: externalizing or aggressive behavior (13 items), and
internalizing, withdrawn, or sad behavior (16 items). The
subscales have very good psychometric properties
(Cronbach's s = .86 and .81 respectively). We should note
that although the CBCL is a parent-reported measure of chil-
dren's mental health status, it is not one of the instruments
that Glied et al. found to lead to biased estimates of the
effects of income on health services use by children.37
Furthermore, a review conducted by Biederman et al. found
that there is good agreement between CBCL scores and diag-
nostic categories from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders­Third Edition, Revised (DSM-III-R).38,39
In the current study, we considered any children in the house-
hold as having EBP if the total score was above the 90th
percentile. This cutoff point for dichotomizing EBP is based
on the American normative sample version of the Dutch
scoring distribution where cases are allocated according to a
clinical range if the score is above the 90th percentile.40
Child's General Health and Household Socio-
demographics
Children's general health status was measured by asking the
caregiver, "In general, would you say the (child's) health is
4 INQUIRY
excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?" We created the
following three dummy variables: excellent/very good, good,
and fair/poor health. Excellent/very good health was used as
the reference group. Children's functional impairment was
coded as 1 if the caregiver reported that any child in the
household had any physical limitations. A set of children's,
mother's, father's, and family characteristics were controlled
for in the model. Characteristics of children included age,
gender, and health status. We also controlled for parents'age,
race, education, and health status. Other variables included
in the analysis were the presence of any children younger
than 6 years old and regional variables. The annual non-wage
income was scaled in $10,000 units. Experience was squared
to capture the non-linearity of this variable.
Estimation Strategy
We used the standard reduced form model below to estimate
the effects of any children in the household with EBP on their
mothers' employment status:
P M
i i i i
= + + +
   
0 1 2X . (1)
P
i
measures mother i 's employment status. M
i
is a
dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if any children in
the household have EBP, and 0 otherwise. X
i
is a vector of
exogenous variables including the mother's age, race, educa-
tion, and health status, the father's education and health sta-
tus, the presence of children younger than 6 years old in the
household, non-labor income, different regions of the coun-
try, and a time dummy variable. 
1
and 
2
are the parame-
ters to be estimated, and 
i is a random error term capturing
shocks to mothers'employment outcomes. Similarly, the fol-
lowing equation was used to estimate mothers' work hours:
Log H M

H

measures mother i 's work hours for the past 12
months. M
i
is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if
any children in the household have EBP, and 0 otherwise. X
i
is the same vector of exogenous variables discussed above.
The parameters 
1
and 
2
are to be estimated and µ
i
is a
random error term capturing shocks to mothers' work hours.
If the variable measuring the mental health status of any
children in the household is endogenous in Equations 1 and
2, univariate probit models typically used to estimate the
probability of employment and standard tobit model typi-
cally used to estimate censored work hours would lead to
biased estimators. Indeed, evidence suggests that children's
EBP are not randomly distributed in the population of all
children and are strongly associated with their mothers'
employment.41 For instance, a literature review by Ruhm
concluded that maternal employment may have a positive
effect on the well-being of children during their early years
and a negative effect on the development of 3 and 4 year
olds.42 In the case of a positive effect, children of employed
mothers may have greater access to mental health services
through more disposable income and/or employer-provided
insurance coverage.43 Conversely, reduced maternal time
and stress associated with employment may also lead to
increased EBP in children during their early formative
years.44,45
Endogeneity may also arise from measurement errors in
children's EBP. Measurement error is a potentially important
problem in any study relying on self-reported measures of
children's mental health disorders.37,46,47 Glied et al. dis-
cussed how the use of different children's mental health mea-
sures, particularly those reported by parents, might introduce
estimation bias.37 Furthermore, the lack of measures such as
the mental health status of mothers in the PSID is a likely
source of omitted variable bias and hence endogeneity.
Endogeneity of Children's EBP: Instrumental
Variable (IV) Approach
We implemented the following IV approach to address any
potential endogeneity:
Mi i i i
= + + +
   
0 1 2
Z X . (3)
M
i
measures child i 's mental health status in the house-
hold. Xi
is the same vector of exogenous variables included
in mothers'employment and wok hours equations (Equations
1 and 2). 
1
and 
2
are the parameters to be estimated and

i
is the error term for the children's EBP equation. Z
i
is a
vector of exogenous variables that are correlated with chil-
dren's EBP but uncorrelated with mothers' employment sta-
tus and work hours.48
The main difficulty with the IV approach is to find suit-
able instruments. The following three instruments were used
to predict children's EBP and remove the unobserved factors
that affect both children's EBP and maternal labor supply:
(1) whether any children were ever spanked by the mother by
the time they turned 3 years old, (2) the mother's frequency
of religious activity with any of the children in the household
(and/or the father in the case of married mothers), and (3)
whether these children have any biological siblings younger
than 18 years old who do not live in the same household.
Spanking reflects parental attitudes toward discipline to con-
trol children's behaviors. Several studies have documented
the positive effects of spanking on children and adolescents'
emotional and behavioral well-being.49-51 Using the con-
structs of the problem behavior theory, we hypothesized that
children's spankings are protective factors against behavioral
problems because they capture the different means used by
mothers to control their children's behavior.52,53
In addition, several studies have shown that family envi-
ronments and the quality of relationships among family mem-
bersplayanimportantroleinshapingchildren'swell-being.54-56
Research in sociology has shown an important transmission of
Richard et al. 5
attitudes and behaviors during family interactions.54 The fre-
quency of religious activities and the absence of biological
siblings who are less than 18 years old in the household are
important dimensions of family environments involving the
interaction and the quality of relationships among family
members. Mothers' frequency of religious activities and sib-
lings'interactions play an important role in shaping these fam-
ily dynamics that would in turn influence children's EBP.
More specifically, the frequency of religious activities reflects
parental inputs into the child's emotional and behavioral
development. Studies have shown that children and adoles-
cents whose parents frequently attend religious services are
less likely to suffer from emotional problems because these
children are more involved with their families, have better
support networks from friends, and feel more able to deal with
health-related problems.57,58 A similar instrument was used in
a prior study to estimate the effects of depression on employ-
ment in a low-income population in Miami-Dade County,
Florida.59 However, we hypothesized that children whose bio-
logical siblings live outside of the family unit are more likely
to suffer from emotional problems. The absence of other bio-
logical siblings in the same household reflects a lack of cohe-
sion and environmental circumstances within the family that
may impact the child's well-being. Indeed, sibling relation-
ships have been found to have important effects on each oth-
er's internalizing and externalizing behaviors.60,61 In sum, all
three instruments are related to children's EBP but are not cor-
related to mothers' labor supply.
Results
We first presented the weighted means of the study sample,
followed by the multivariate estimates of the employment
status and work hours' equations. For ease of interpretation,
the estimates from the models were converted to "marginal
effects." For binary explanatory variables, these marginal
effects represent the estimated effect of a change in the value
of an indicator from 0 to 1 on the percentage of employed
mothers. For continuous explanatory variables such as age,
years of education, and non-wage income, the marginal
effects represent the estimated effects of a one-unit increase
in value on the expected percentage of employed mothers. In
the log work hours regression models, the marginal effects
on a continuous variable such as age or years of education
represent the proportional change in work hours. Variances
were estimated using complex sampling design commands
as available in STATA10 to account for heteroskedascity.62
As suggested by the CDS-PSID, we used the PCG/mother
weights provided by the CDS because mothers are the unit of
analysis in this study.63
Descriptive Statistics
Table 3 summarizes the weighted means of the dependent
and independent variables used in the study by family
structure. The rates of employment and work hours for sin-
gle mothers are significantly higher compared to those for
married mothers. Single mothers in this sample are more
likely to be black (44% vs. 7%), in fair/poor health (15%
vs. 8%), have functional impairment (11% vs. 9%), and live
in the South (38% vs. 29%) compared with married moth-
ers (p < .001). They also have lower socio-economic status
compared with two-parent families. For instance, the aver-
age total family income, expressed in 1996 dollars, is about
$30,000 for single mothers compared with about $80,000
for married mothers (p < .0001). Likewise, single mothers
have lower education levels, averaging 12 years of educa-
tion compared to 13 years of education for married mothers
(p < .0001).
Employment of Married and Single Mothers
As reported in Table 4, two different models were used to
estimate the effects of children's EBP on the employment
probability of married mothers. In the case of married
mothers, , the coefficient of correlation that measures exo-
geneity between children's EBP and mothers' employment
in the IV bivariate probit model, is positive and signifi-
cantly different from zero ( = .705**). Therefore, we can
reject the null hypothesis that children's EBP are exoge-
nous in the married mothers' employment equation. In this
context, the bivariate probit model with IV is preferred to
the univariate probit model and the marginal effects indi-
cate that children's EBP significantly reduce their married
mothers' probability of employment by about 1% (p <
.001). As a result, we decided to assess the strength and
validity of the instruments used to correct for endogeneity
in the bivariate probit model with IV for married mothers
because weak instruments yield inconsistent estimates.64
Table 4 summarizes the results from the joint significance
test and shows that the set of instruments perform well
using the Staiger and Stock rule of thumb of an F statistic
of 10 or more (F = 107.09***).65 Moreover, we used the
equivalent of a Hausman test developed by Smith and
Blundell66 for non-linear models to test the exogeneity of
the instruments and a Lagrange multiplier test to assess
their validity. For these tests, the chi-square statistics and
the adjusted Wald test results were not significant; there-
fore, we concluded that the instruments were not correlated
with married mothers' employment in the bivariate probit
model with IV. In the case of single mothers, the univariate
probit model is preferred to the bivariate probit model with
IV because the correlation term measuring exogeneity
between children's EBP and their single mothers' employ-
ment is not significant. In other words, the results from the
bivariate probit model with IV show that children's EBP
and single mothers' employment are exogenous. Thus, mar-
ginal effects from the univariate probit model show that
children's EBP have no effect on their single mothers'
employment probability.

Work Hours of Married and Single Mothers
As indicated in Table 5, two models were used to estimate
the marginal effects of children's EBP on their mothers'
work hours. Alpha, which represents the degree of correla-
tion between children's EBP and their mothers' hours of
work, is not statistically different from zero in the IV tobit
models for both married and single mothers as indicated at

the bottom of Table 5. In other words, the results show that
children's EBP are exogenous with their married and single
mothers' work hours; therefore, the tobit models are pre-
ferred in both cases. Marginal effects from the tobit model
for married mothers show that children's EBP have no
effect on their married mothers' work hours. However, as
shown in Table 4, marginal effects indicate that children's
EBP significantly reduce their single mothers' work activi-
ties by 0.920 log work hours.
Discussion
The primary goal of this study was to estimate the effects of
children's EBP on their mothers' labor supply including
employment and work hours. We found reductions in mar-
ried mothers' probability of employment and single mothers'
work hours resulting from children's EBP. Marginal effect
estimates are negative and significant for married mothers'
employment that account for endogeneity in children's men-
tal health. These findings are consistent and similar to those
of the study conducted by Coley et al.27 A possible explana-
tion for these findings is that the presence of a father in two-
parent households may provide more financial flexibility for
married mothers to stay at home with a child with EBP.
However, given a child with EBP, single mothers may not be
able to leave work completely but can only afford to reduce
their work hours to deal with demand on their time to seek
treatment for their children.
It is worth noting that the study has some limitations.
Mother's marital status might be another mechanism through
which maternal work activities impact children's EBP.
Children living in single-parent families are known to be
more likely to have EBP compared with those raised by two
parents.42 Compared with their peers in two-parent families,
these children are more likely to use more mental health ser-
vices because of less time and emotional support from their
parent.45 Conversely, children's EBP might be a contributing
factor to changes in the family structure such as marital dis-
solution. A child with EBP might bring additional financial
and marital stress into the family, which could result in sin-
gle-parent households.67 For instance, a recent article by
Kvist et al. found that the existence of a child with ADHD in
the household can contribute to marital separation.29 As such,
one would contend that the effect of children's EBP on moth-
ers' employment could be confounded with parental separa-
tion. However, this would not be the case in our study
because we conducted separate analyses for married and
single mothers.
Although most households in the study have one sampled
child, the CDS randomly sampled two or three eligible chil-
dren in 18% of the households in the sample. If EBP are cor-
related across siblings in families where the CDS interviewed
two or more children, then the effects of children's EBP on
their mothers' labor supply will be overestimated. Although
the IV approach may account for some of this omitted
variable bias, it would be better to include information about
as many siblings as possible. However, this was not possible
as the CDS only collected a series of information about sib-
lings' relationships in 2002, but not in 1997.
Conclusions
This study shows that children's EBP negatively influence
married mothers' probability of employment and single
mothers' work hours. To increase maternal employment,
policies may consider targeting both children's mental health
symptoms and their families' financial resources. Attempts
could also be made to provide families with access to ser-
vices that may reduce children's EBP such as screening for
children's EBP in primary care and adequate treatment.
Although the effects of children's EBP on maternal
employment and work hours appear to be fairly small,
researchers may consider whether children with more severe
mental health problems have larger effects on their mothers'
employment and work hours as more appropriate data sets
become available. Implications for future research could be
longitudinal assessments of the impact of children's EBP on
their mothers' labor supply as these children age. The ana-
lytic sample was restricted to biological mothers, adoptive
mothers, and stepmothers. But future research should con-
sider a sub-group analysis of biological mothers to examine
the impact of EBP on this population.
