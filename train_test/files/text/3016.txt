From the DSM-V

Background: High prevalence estimates in epidemio-
logical surveys have led to concerns that the DSM sys-
tem is overly inclusive and that mild cases should be ex-
cluded from future DSM editions.
Objective: To demonstrate that the DSM-III-R disor-
ders in the baseline National Comorbidity Survey
(NCS) can be placed on a severity gradient that has a
dose-response relationship with outcomes assessed a
decade later in the NCS follow-up survey (NCS-2) and
that no inflection point exists at the mild severity
level.
Methods: The NCS was a nationally representative
household survey of DSM-III-R disorders in the 3-year
time span 1990-1992. The NCS-2 is a follow-up sur-
vey of 4375 NCS respondents (76.6% conditional
response rate) reinterviewed in 2000 through 2002.
The NCS-2 outcomes include hospitalization for men-
tal health or substance disorders, work disability due
to these disorders, suicide attempts, and serious men-
tal illness.
Results: Twelve-month NCS/DSM-III-R disorders were
disaggregated into 3.2% severe, 3.2% serious, 8.7% mod-
erate, and 16.0% mild case categories. All 4 case catego-
ries were associated with statistically significantly (P.05,
2-sided tests) elevated risk of the NCS-2 outcomes com-
pared with baseline noncases, with odds ratios of any out-
come ranging monotonically from 2.4 (95% confidence
interval, 1.6-3.4) to 15.1 (95% confidence interval, 10.0-
22.9) for mild to severe cases. Odds ratios comparing mild
to moderate cases were generally nonsignificant.
Conclusions: There is a graded relationship between
mental illness severity and later clinical outcomes. Re-
tention of mild cases in the DSM is important to repre-
sent the fact that mental disorders (like physical disor-
ders) vary in severity. Decisions about treating mild cases
should be based on cost-effectiveness not current sever-
ity. Cost-effectiveness analysis should include recogni-
tion that treatment of mild cases might prevent a sub-
stantial proportion of future serious cases.

TWO MAJOR psychiatric epi-
demiological surveys have
been carried out in the
United States since 1980--
the Epidemiologic Catch-
ment Area Study1 and the National Co-
morbidity Survey (NCS).2 Both surveys
estimated that about 30% of the respon-
dents in the 18- to 54-year age range met
criteria for 1 or more of the 12-month
DSM-III (Epidemiologic Catchment Area)
or DSM-III-R (NCS) psychiatric disor-
ders assessed in the surveys.3,4 These are
lower-bound estimates, as neither of the
surveys included the full range of DSM dis-
orders in their assessments and even this
range of disorders is likely to be nonin-
clusive.5,6 Nevertheless, these rates seemed
high, leading to the suggestion that the lay
administered diagnostic interviews in these
surveys might be upwardly biased.7,8 How-
ever, clinical calibration studies showed
that the prevalence estimates in these sur-
veys were not upwardly biased,9,10 lead-
ing critics to conclude that the DSM sys-
tem itself is overly inclusive.3,11,12 This
conclusion was instrumental in causing an
American Psychiatric Association Task
Force to add a clinical significance crite-
rion to many disorders in the DSM-IV to
remind readers of the basic definition of
a mental disorder in the "Introduction" of
the manual. However, even when this ad-
ditional requirement was applied post hoc
to the Epidemiologic Catchment Area and
NCS data, the 12-month prevalence of a
DSM disorder, equivalent to about 37 mil-
lion adults in the United States, contin-
ued to exceed substantially the number
who could be helped with current treat-
ment resources.13
In recognition of this problem, sev-
eral more restrictive definitions have been
proposed that can be used to narrow the
number of persons qualifying for treat-
ment. The National Institute of Mental
Health National Advisory Mental Health
Council,14 for example, distinguished per-

sons with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) from
other persons with mental illness, while the Alcohol, Drug
Abuse, and Mental Health Administration Reorganiza-
tion Act stipulated that state mental health block grant
funds can be used only to treat persons with serious men-
tal illness (SMI).15 Many health care plans have fol-
lowed suit by restricting mental health coverage to a sub-
set of DSM disorders that they consider to be biologically
based. Darryl Regier, MD, director of the Division of Re-
search at the American Psychiatric Association, who is
expected to play a prominent role in the development of
DSM-V, has supported similar restrictions using more
elaborate requirements for clinically significant distress
or impairment than those in DSM-IV.13,16,17
The SPMI and SMI proposals are different from the
Regier proposal for DSM-V. The definitions of SPMI and
SMI are practical attempts to focus treatment resources on
the subset of cases with the greatest need. In comparison,
the Regier proposed restriction of cases in DSM-V is an at-
tempt to declare that mild cases do not exist. This radical
approachhasimplicationsnotonlyforthedefinitionofcur-
rent unmet need for treatment but also for current re-
search and consideration of future treatment needs. Re-
search shows that many syndromes currently defined as
mental disorders are extremes on continua that appear not
to have meaningful thresholds.18,19 These results are im-
portant in at least 2 ways. First, exploration of the full con-
tinuaratherthanthecurrentlyestablisheddiagnosticthresh-
olds might yield greater power in studies of genetic and
environmental risk factors.20 Second, development of early
interventions to prevent progression along a given sever-
ity continuum might reduce the prevalence of serious
cases.21 Removal of current mild cases from the DSM sys-
tem would undercut both of these advantages as well as
distort the reality that mental disorders (like physical dis-
orders) vary widely in seriousness.22,23
The current article presents data designed to argue
against using the deletion of mild cases from future edi-
tions of the DSM as an approach to restrict the number
of persons who are defined as being in need of treat-
ment. The argument is based on the expansion of an analy-
sis of the NCS that was recently reported in the ARCHIVES
by Narrow, Regier, and colleagues.13 These authors di-
vided 12-month NCS/DSM-III-R cases into those consid-
ered either clinically significant mental illness (CSMI) or
clinically nonsignificant mental illness(CNMI) based on
respondent reports about interference and treatment.
Comparison of these 2 subgroups showed, not surpris-
ingly, that various indicators of illness severity (eg, days
out of role [ie, the number of days when a person is un-
able to carry out their normal activities], history of sui-
cide attempts) were higher in CSMI than CNMI. Nar-
row, Regier, and colleagues asserted, based on these
results, that mild cases should be excluded from DSM-V.
We build on this analysis in 2 ways. First, we use
data from the recently completed NCS-2,24 a survey that
reinterviewed NCS respondents a decade after their base-
line interviews, to examine the associations of baseline
NCS 12-month illness severity with clinically signifi-
cant outcomes assessed in NCS-2. Second, we expand the
number of illness severity categories from 2 to 4 by di-
viding the cases that Narrow, Regier, and colleagues de-
fined as having CSMI into severe, serious, and moderate
cases. We show that differences in the risk of clinically
significant outcomes in NCS-2 across these severity cat-
egories are as large as, and in some cases larger than, those
between moderate and mild (ie, CNMI) cases. We also
show that the elevated risk of the NCS-2 outcomes among
mild cases vs noncases is consistently larger than the el-
evated risk among moderate cases vs mild cases. These
results call into question the suggestion that the DSM-V
case threshold should be set above CNMI rather than at
any other arbitrary point on the severity gradient.
METHODS
SAMPLE
The baseline NCS was a nationally representative household
survey of 8098 respondents in the age range of 15 to 54 years
carried out in the 3-year time span of 1990-1992.4 Respon-
dents were selected from a stratified, multistage area probabil-
ity sample of the noninstitutionalized civilian population in the
48 coterminous states, with a supplemental sample of stu-
dents living in campus housing. The survey response rate was
82.4%. All NCS respondents were administered a part I diag-
nostic interview (described in the "Baseline Diagnostic Assess-
ment" section), while a part II risk factor interview was ad-
ministered to a probability subsample of 5877 respondents who
included all those in the age range of 15 to 24 years, all those
who screened positive for any of the DSM-III disorders as-
sessed in part I, and a 1 in 6 random subsample of all remain-
ing part I respondents. The part II sample was weighted to ad-
just for differential probabilities of selection as well as for
nonresponse bias.25
The NCS-2 attempted to trace and reinterview all 5877 part
II NCS respondents a decade after the baseline NCS using an ex-
panded version of the baseline interview that reconstructed in-
formation on illness onset, course, and severity during the years
between the 2 surveys. A total of 5463 target respondents were
successfully traced, of whom 166 were deceased, and 4375 were
interviewed for a conditional response rate of 76.6%. The uncon-
ditional response rate, which considers the baseline NCS re-
sponse rate of 82.4%, is 63.1% (0.7660.824). The NCS-2 re-
spondentsdiffersignificantlyfromotherbaselineNCSrespondents
in higher probabilities of being female, well educated, and resi-
dents of rural areas (Table 1, part I). A propensity score adjust-
ment weight26 was used to correct the NCS-2 sample for these
compositional biases. There was remarkably little difference, in
comparison, between NCS-2 respondents and nonrespondents
either in the prevalence of baseline NCS/DSM-III-R disorders or
in the severity of these disorders (Table 1, part II).
BASELINE DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT
The baseline NCS diagnostic interview was a modified version
of the World Health Organization Composite International
Diagnostic Interview (CIDI).27,28 Diagnoses were based on
DSM-III-R criteria. The 12-month diagnoses available in the part
II sample, which are the focus of this article, are mood disor-
ders (major depression, mania, dysthymia), anxiety disorders
(panicdisorder,agoraphobiawithoutpanic,socialphobia,simple
phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress dis-
order), substance use disorders (alcohol or other drug abuse
or dependence), and nonaffective psychosis (NAP) (schizo-
phrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder,
delusional disorder, or psychosis not otherwise specified). Cri-
teria for at least one of these disorders in the 12 months before

the baseline interview was met by 31.2% of the weighted part
II NCS sample.
A clinical calibration of all NCS/DSM-III-R diagnoses other
than NAP was carried out with blind follow-up interviews of
356 NCS respondents using the lifetime version of the Struc-
tured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID).29 The vast ma-
jority of CIDI prevalence estimates were lower than the SCID
prevalence estimates.10 However, only 2 differences were sta-
tistically significant--an overestimated prevalence of major de-
pression in the CIDI compared with the SCID and an under-
estimated prevalence of simple phobia in the CIDI compared
with the SCID. A separate calibration study for NAP showed
that, although the CIDI could be used as a useful first-stage
screen for NAP, no calibration rule could generate valid diag-
noses of NAP from the CIDI data.30 Based on this result, an at-
tempt was made to administer a clinical reappraisal interview
for NAP to all NCS respondents who screened positive for NAP
in the baseline NCS. Clinician-diagnosed NAP was subse-
quently used instead of CIDI-diagnosed NAP in all NCS re-
ports, including the current report.
THE BASELINE ILLNESS SEVERITY SCALE
The baseline illness severity scale was created by using 3 pre-
viously published definitions: (1) The National Mental Health
Advisory Council definition of SPMI;14 (2) the Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration definition of SMI15;
and (3) the definition of CSMI recently made by Narrow, Reiger,
and colleagues.13 The operational definitions of SPMI and SMI
have been described in detail elsewhere.31,32 Briefly, SPMI was
defined as either (1) meeting criteria for 12-month NAP or ma-
nia or (2) having a 12-month anxiety or mood disorder that
required hospitalization or treatment with antipsychotic medi-
cations. Serious mental illness was defined as either (1) meet-
ing criteria for SPMI or (2) having a 12-month anxiety or mood
disorder that was associated with at least 1 indicator of serious
role impairment (suicidality, mental health-related work dis-
ability, marital violence, or extreme social isolation). Follow-
ing Narrow, Reiger, and colleagues,13 CSMI was defined as hav-
ing a 12-month NCS/DSM-III-R diagnosis that either (1) was
described by the respondent as interfering "a lot" with his or
her life and activities or (2) was treated at some time in the 12
months before the baseline NCS interview. Clinically nonsig-
nificant mental illness, finally, was defined as any 12-month
NCS/DSM-III-R disorder that did not meet the requirements for
CSMI. Using these definitions and defining categories hierar-
chically, 3.2% (SE, 0.3%) of part II NCS respondents met 12-
month criteria at baseline for SPMI, an additional 3.2% (SE,
0.2%) met criteria for SMI but not SPMI, an additional 8.7%
(SE, 0.4%) met criteria for CSMI but neither SPMI nor SMI,
and an additional 16.0% (SE, 0.5%) met criteria for CNMI but
not SPMI, SMI, or CSMI.
NCS-2 OUTCOME ASSESSMENT
The 4 NCS-2 outcomes considered herein were defined as fol-
lows: (1) Hospitalization was defined as being hospitalized for
mental health or substance problems at any time in the decade
between the NCS and NCS-2 interviews. This outcome was re-
ported by 2.5% (SE, 0.3%) of the NCS-2 respondents. (2) Work
disability was defined as being out of work on disability for a
mental health or substance problem for a minimum of 4 con-
secutive weeks at any time between the 2 interviews. This out-
come was reported by 1.4% (SE, 0.2%) of the NCS-2 respon-
dents. (3) Suicide attempt was defined as reporting an attempted
suicide at any time between the 2 interviews. This outcome was
reported by 1.4% (SE, 0.2%) of the NCS-2 respondents. (4) Se-
rious mental illness was defined as meeting the criteria de-
scribed earlier for SMI in the 12 months before the NCS-2 in-
terview. This outcome was reported by 5.6% (SE, 0.5) of the
NCS-2 respondents. At least 1 of the 4 outcomes was reported
by 8.5% (SE, 0.6%) of the NCS-2 respondents.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Controlling for respondent age and sex, logistic regression analy-
sis was used to predict the NCS-2 outcomes from dummy vari-
ables that distinguished NCS respondents with baseline
12-month severe, serious, moderate, and mild DSM-III-R/NCS
disorders compared with respondents who did not meet crite-
ria for any of these disorders at the time of the original NCS.
Parallel logistic regression equations were estimated to com-

pare outcomes associated with the 4 contiguous pairs of ill-
ness severity categories (severe vs serious, serious vs moder-
ate, moderate vs mild, mild vs noncase). Logistic regression
coefficients were transformed to odds ratios (ORs) and are re-
ported with design-based 95% confidence intervals (CIs) esti-
mated using the Taylor series linearization method,33 imple-
mented in the SUDAAN software package.34 Wald 2 tests
correcting for the clustering and weighting of the NCS-2 data
were used to evaluate overall model fit. Simulations using an
SAS (SAS Inc, Cary, NC) macro estimated the population at-
tributable risk proportion of each outcome associated with each
category of the baseline clinical severity distinction. The popu-
lation attributable risk proportion was operationalized in this
macro as the proportional reduction in the prevalence of the
outcome estimated from the logistic regression equation when
the OR associated with a given category of severity was set to
1.0. This ratio can be interpreted as the proportion of respon-
dents with the outcome who would no longer have the out-
come in the absence of the elevated risk associated with the speci-
fied disorder severity category. All analyses of statistical
significance were based on P=.05, 2-sided tests.
RESULTS
EFFECTS OF BASELINE SEVERITY
IN PREDICTING NCS-2 OUTCOMES
A consistent monotonic relationship exists between the
baseline illness severity categories and the 4 NCS-2 out-
comes (Table 2), with only 1 inversion in monotonic-
ity (the OR for mild cases was larger than the OR for mod-
erate cases in predicting work disability). The largest ORs
associated with severe cases are in the range of 5.60 to
29.7, while the smallest ORs associated with mild cases
are in the range of 1.3 to 2.7. Three of the 3 ORs asso-
ciated with mild cases are statistically significant at the
.05 level.
A comparison of pairwise differences in outcomes
across contiguous categories of the baseline illness se-
verity gradient (Table 3) finds 10 statistically signifi-
cant differences (P.05, 2-sided tests) of 20 compari-
sons. Importantly, the differences between moderate cases
vs mild cases are consistently smaller than either the dif-
ferences between severe cases vs serious cases or seri-
ous cases vs moderate cases. The moderate vs mild dis-
tinction is statistically significant in only 1 comparison
(SMI in the year before the NCS-2 interview). The mild
vs none distinction, in comparison, is significant in 3 com-
parisons and consistently larger than the moderate vs mild
distinction.
The population attributable risk proportions asso-
ciated with each category of baseline illness severity
(Table 4) vary less than the ORs. This is true because
the higher baseline prevalences of the less severe catego-
ries counterbalance their lower effects on the outcomes.
As a result, although severe cases are consistently asso-

COMMENT
These results show that a continuous graded relation-
ship exists between the baseline NCS illness severity cat-
egories and the NCS-2 outcomes. No consistent inflec-
tion point in the gradient of outcome risk can be found
at the point on the distribution proposed by Narrow,
Regier, and colleagues13 as distinguishing between CSMI
and CNMI. The results also show that the elevated risk
of NCS-2 outcomes among mild cases vs noncases is con-
sistently larger than the elevated risk among moderate
cases vs mild cases. These results call into question the
suggestion that the case threshold should exclude mild
cases.
This is not to say that more principled consider-
ations, based either on future epidemiological, biologi-
cal, or taxometric studies, might not lead to the conclu-
sion that diagnostic thresholds for certain DSM disorders
should be changed. Nor is it to say that the problem that
motivated Narrow, Regier, and colleagues13 to propose
narrowing the DSM criteria (the number of persons who
meet current criteria is much larger than the number of
persons who can be treated with available treatment re-
sources) is unimportant. However, the solution to this
problem proposed by Narrow, Regier, and colleagues to
define the problem out of existence is ill conceived. The
definition of a case should not be considered synony-
mous with need for treatment any more than with clini-
cally significant distress or impairment.35
The problem of unmet need for treatment should
be addressed by developing comprehensive triage rules
that allocate available resources based on evidence-
based assessments of the cost-effectiveness of available
treatments across the severity threshold of the disorder.
Severity gradients are widely used in this way in other
branches of medicine.36 In the absence of such rules, which
do not exist, ad hoc decision making is inevitable.37 In
developing these rules for mental disorders, consider-
ation should be given not only to current distress and
impairment but also to the risk of progression from a mild
to a more severe disorder. It is unclear whether these rules,
once they are developed, would define treatment of mild
cases as cost-effective. Even if they did not, mild cases
should be retained in the definition of disorders both to
acknowledge that mental disorders (like physical disor-
ders) vary in severity and to remind us that the devel-
opment of cost-effective treatments for mild disorders
might prevent a substantial proportion of future serious
disorders.

The baseline NCS was supported by grants MH46376,
MH49098, and MH52861 from the National Institute of Men-
tal Health (NIMH), with supplemental support from grant
90135190 from the William T. Grant Foundation, New York,
NY. Dr Kessler was the principal investigator of the base-
line NCS. His participation in the survey was supported by
NIMH Research Scientist Award MH00507. The NCS-2 is
funded by grant DA12058 from the National Institute of Drug
Abuse, with supplemental support from the NIMH.
Drs Kessler and Merikangas are coprincipal investi-
gators. Collaborators include Jim Anthony, PhD, Johns Hop-
kins University; Jane Costello, PhD, Duke University,

*Each population attributable risk proportion was calculated by generating 2
estimated probabilities of a given NCS-2 outcome for each NCS-2 respondent
based on the logistic regression equations in Table 2. The first estimate used all
the original coefficients in the equation, while the second constrained the
coefficient for the severity category under investigation to be 0 (ie, odds ratio,
1.0). The population attributable risk proportion was defined as the proportional
reduction in the estimated prevalence of the outcome in the total sample in the
restricted equation vs the unrestricted equation.
