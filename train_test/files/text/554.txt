Liminal Men: Incarceration and
Relationship Dissolution
Kristin Turney

ABSTRACT
Incarceration, now a rite of passage for many economically disadvantaged minority men
entailing an involuntary removal from families, places these marginal men in a liminal state
where they are simultaneously members of families and isolated from families. Despite a
burgeoning literature documenting the collateral consequences of incarceration for family
life, as well as evidence that the deleterious consequences of incarceration for maternal and
child well-being stem from resultant relationship dissolution, much less is known about the
direct link between incarceration and relationship dissolution. I consider this association
with data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a longitudinal survey
uniquely positioned to understand the consequences of incarceration for family life. Results
show that paternal incarceration is associated with relatively immediate relationship dissolu-
tion among parents, the association is concentrated among parents living together prior to
incarceration, and is explained by both incarceration duration and changes in relationship
quality. And, for couples that survive this initial period, incarceration is inconsequential for
relationship dissolution. Taken together, these findings link the literature on the collateral
consequences of mass incarceration with the literature on demographic changes in family
life, and, given the well-known deleterious consequences of parental relationship dissolution
for children, have important implications for intergenerational inequality.

Family instability in the United States has increased dramatically since the 1970s. Demographic changes
in family life--including the postponing of marriage and the increasing number of short-term cohabit-
ing unions--mean that considerable numbers of adults experience the dissolution of romantic relation-
ships (Cherlin 2010). The consequences of relationship dissolution for adults are profound, as
dissolution and the often resultant instability impedes parenting practices (Beck et al. 2010; Tach,

Brooks-Gunn 2008; Osborne, Berger, and Magnuson 2012), reduces social support networks
(McLanahan and Percheski 2008), and increases poverty and material hardship (Osborne et al. 2012).
Further, in large part because of its negative consequences for adults, relationship dissolution is linked
to a host of detrimental outcomes among offspring (Amato 2010), including behavioral problems
(McLanahan, Tach, and Schneider 2013), reduced educational achievement and attainment (Kim
2011), and health deficiencies (Bzostek and Beck 2011). Some scholars have suggested that aspects of
family instability, including relationship dissolution, may increase income inequality and contribute to
the intergenerational transmission of poverty (McLanahan and Percheski 2008).
Another recent demographic change in the United States--the rapid and dramatic rise in
incarceration--may contribute to relationship dissolution (Wakefield and Uggen 2010). About 2.3
million U.S. residents (1 in 134 individuals) are incarcerated in prisons or jails, and even larger num-
bers of individuals have been recently released back to their families and communities (Glaze 2011).
There are compelling reasons to believe that incarceration, most often experienced by poorly edu-
cated minority men, is consequential for relationship dissolution (Wilson 1987). Indeed, most of
these marginal men--prior to confinement, while behind bars, and after release--are connected to
families as romantic partners and fathers (Mumola 2000).
Incarceration, which often involves an involuntary removal of men from families, places men in a
state of liminality (Turner 1969), where they are simultaneously members of families and isolated
from these families, and are, by and large, unable to perform their roles as romantic partners and fa-
thers. Maintaining contact with incarcerated partners is difficult and costly and, upon release, men
face a host of consequences including stigma and discrimination (Braman 2004), difficulty finding
employment (Pager 2003; Western 2006), and increased physical and mental health problems
(Schnittker and John 2007; Turney, Wildeman, and Schnittker 2012), all of which make reintegration
into family life difficult.
Despite escalating attention to the collateral consequences of incarceration on family life more
generally (e.g., Arditti 2012; Braman 2004; Comfort 2008; Geller 2013; Geller, Garfinkel, and
Western 2011; Turney 2014a, 2014b, 2015; Turney, Schnittker, and Wildeman 2012; Wildeman,
Schnittker, and Turney 2012), and a vast literature documenting how marriage leads to desistance
from crime (e.g., King, Massoglia, and MacMillan 2007; Sampson and Laub 1993), much less re-
search examines the consequences of incarceration for the dissolution of marital, cohabiting, and
non-residential romantic relationships (though, for research on divorce, see Apel et al. 2010; Lopoo
and Western 2005; Massoglia, Remster, and King 2011; Siennick, Stewart, and Staff 2014). This is an
especially important oversight given that many of the deleterious consequences of incarceration on
family life result from relationship dissolution (e.g., Schwartz-Soicher, Geller, and Garfinkel 2011;
Turanovic, Rodriguez, and Pratt 2012; Turney and Wildeman 2013). Given the considerable number
of families affected by incarceration, the unequal distribution of incarceration across the population,
and the consequences of family instability for the intergenerational transmission of inequality, it is es-
sential to understand how the penal system--and the resultant liminality--triggers a renegotiation of
family life.
Therefore, in this article, I use data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a longi-
tudinal survey of parents who share children, to consider three research questions that extend our
knowledge about the collateral consequences of incarceration for relationship dissolution. First, how
is paternal incarceration associated with relationship dissolution among couples that share children?
Second, does this association vary by parents' relationship status when their child was born? Third, to
what extent do post-incarceration changes in family life (including relationship quality, economic
well-being, and physical and mental health) explain the association between incarceration and rela-
tionship dissolution? The focus on relationship dissolution among incarcerated fathers--as opposed
to all incarcerated men--is important given the negative consequences of dissolution for child well-
being.

BACKGROUND
The Liminal Status of Incarcerated Men
The historically novel rise in incarceration, mostly resulting from increased harsh sentencing policies
for nonviolent offenses, has had profound implications for the lives of American men (Wildeman and
Western 2010). Incarceration, especially for poorly educated minority men, has become a normative
life course period and a rite of passage that forcefully removes these men from mainstream society
(Pettit and Western 2004). Incarcerated men experience a liminal stage that likely complicates the
maintenance of romantic relationships. Liminality, which was initially developed to describe a stage
in the ritual process (e.g., religious rituals, coming-of-age rituals) but has since been applied to other
domains, refers to individuals who are "neither here nor there; they are betwixt and between the posi-
tions assigned and arrayed by law, custom, convention, and ceremony" (Turner 1969:95). Liminality,
according to Victor Turner (1969), begins when individuals are removed and isolated from society,
and ends with individuals reintegrating back into normal life and assuming their former roles. During
the liminal stage, individuals' roles become increasingly ambiguous, with their rights and obligations
unclearly defined and aspects of their future uncertain (Turner 1969; for more recent applications of
liminality, see Menji
´var 2006; Murphy et al. 1988).1 Liminal individuals have no fixed social role and
are often sequestered. In such a conception, incarceration is liminality, par excellence.
Turner's (1969) conception of liminality did not include predictions about the consequences of
liminality and, therefore, it does not provide testable hypotheses about the association between incar-
ceration and relationship dissolution. It is merely a framework for understanding the carceral period.
For incarcerated men, their role in family life, in particular, becomes suspended between what they
left behind and an unknown future. Despite the commonality of romantic relationships among incar-
cerated men (Mumola 2000), as well as some women's commitment to maintaining relationships
with incarcerated partners (Comfort 2008), sustaining a relationship while one partner is behind bars
is complicated. Incarcerated individuals are essentially held captive and, as such, have limited, regu-
lated, and institutionalized contact with romantic partners (Sykes [1958] 2007).
Mechanisms Linking Incarceration and Relationship Dissolution
The duration of incarceration may be one reason why relationships dissolve as a result of incarcera-
tion; longer incarceration stints are associated with a greater likelihood of dissolution (Massoglia
et al. 2011). But there are at least three additional plausible intervening mechanisms that may explain
the association between incarceration and relationship dissolution: changes in relationship quality,
changes in economic well-being, and changes in physical and mental health resulting from the incar-
ceration experience.
For one, the association between incarceration and relationship dissolution may operate through
changes in relationship quality. Prisons are often located far from inmates' communities, which can
make visits time-consuming and expensive (Mumola 2000). The often inflexible visiting schedules
and the expense of making long-distance calls from prisons complicates relationship maintenance
(Braman 2004; Comfort 2008). The physical separation of partners may create deficits in emotional
interactions or increased household labor for the partner left behind (for an excellent discussion of
this, see Massoglia et al. 2011). Although men often return to their pre-incarceration families and
communities after release, the isolating and regimented prison experience may alter their personalities
in ways that make maintaining romantic relationships difficult. Even among couples with high-quality
relationships prior to incarceration, the time spent apart may lead to poor communication, decreased
supportiveness, and increased conflict (Comfort 2008; Edin and Kefalas 2005; Roy and Dyson 2005;
Siennick et al. 2014; Turney 2015). Ethnographic work shows that the incarceration experience may

without possibility of parole would not be considered in a liminal state.

encourage men to engage in violent behavior (Nurse 2002) and that recently released men withdraw
from their families to avoid interactions with the police (Goffman 2009). Romantic partners who ex-
perience a precipitous drop in relationship quality are likely to dissolve their union (Booth and
Amato 1994).
In addition, incarceration may diminish economic well-being--among both the incarcerated and
their romantic partners--and, therefore, initiate relationship dissolution. Incarcerated men have few
opportunities to earn income and, upon release, their criminal record makes obtaining employment
difficult (Pager 2003). Further, women attached to incarcerated men may have increased parenting
and household responsibilities that force them to leave the paid labor force and impede their ability
to maintain the family's economic standard of living (Arditti, Lambert-Shute, and Joest 2003).
Indeed, perhaps because most men economically contribute to family life prior to incarceration, re-
search shows that incarceration reduces family income, intensifies material hardship, and increases re-
liance on some forms of public assistance (Geller et al. 2011; Schwartz-Soicher et al. 2011; Sugie
2012). Incarceration also creates challenges for mothers living in public housing, as incarcerated men
are often not allowed to return to these dwellings (Venkatesh 2002). The stress associated with eco-
nomic insecurity may create family conflict and lead to dissolution (McLanahan 2009).
Finally, the association between incarceration and relationship dissolution may work through
changes in physical and mental health patterns among both partners. Stress theory suggests that in-
carceration is a stressful event associated with deleterious health consequences both throughout con-
finement and after release (Pearlin 1989; Turney et al. 2012) and, indeed, empirical research
documents these consequences (Schnitter and John 2007). But the health consequences of incarcera-
tion may extend beyond the offender (Lee and Wildeman 2013). Qualitative research documents the
incarceration of a romantic partner is accompanied with anxiety, uncertainty, and loneliness (Daniel
and Barrett 1981; Fishman 1990; Goffman 2009; also see Wildeman et al. 2012). These feelings may
persist after release, as women worry about their partners violating parole (Goffman 2009) and their
children's adjustment to their father's return (Turnaovic et al. 2012). Given that physical and mental
health are linked to union dissolution (Wade and Pevalin 2004), post-incarceration changes in health
may explain the relationship between incarceration and relationship dissolution.
Existing Evidence on the Consequences of Incarceration for Relationship Dissolution
What does existing literature say about the consequences of incarceration for relationship dissolution
in the United States? By and large, quantitative research suggests that incarceration is negatively asso-
ciated with marital dissolution. For example, data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth
1979 (NLSY79), a longitudinal study uniquely positioned to study the consequences of incarceration,
finds that incarcerated men have a higher probability of divorce or separation than their non-incarcer-
ated counterparts (Lopoo and Western 2005; also see Apel et al. 2010 for an examination of the asso-
ciation between incarceration and divorce in The Netherlands). Other research shows this
association between incarceration and divorce increases as incarceration duration increases
(Massoglia et al. 2011; also see Pavalko and Elder 1990; Rindfuss and Stephen 1990; Western,
Lopoo, and McLanahan 2004). Although very little research considers the mechanisms linking incar-
ceration to divorce, recent research finds that relationship problems--especially low marital love and
extramarital sex--are intervening processes linking incarceration to divorce (Siennick et al. 2014).
Though quantitative research finds that incarceration unequivocally destroys marital relationships,
qualitative research, which most often but not exclusively examines non-marital relationships, docu-
ments a more complicated and nuanced portrait of family life during and after a partner's incarcera-
tion. These qualitative portraits show that relationship stability and instability result from a complex
interplay of both men's and women's reactions to the incarceration. Some men, for example, use in-
carceration as a time to reflect on their familial roles. Their liminal status may lead to internal confu-
sion, but often times men return to families ready to reprise their roles as romantic partners and
fathers (Edin, Nelson, and Paranal 2004; Roy and Dyson 2005). Qualitative research shows that
502  Turney
women's perspectives are equally nuanced. Some women are committed to maintaining relationships
with incarcerated partners (Comfort 2008), yet others use the incarceration as an excuse to hasten an
inevitable breakup (Edin and Kefalas 2005; Edin et al. 2004).
Variation by Relationship Status
The association between incarceration and relationship dissolution may vary by relationship type,
and research has yet to examine this possibility.2 There are three possibilities for this variation. One
possibility is that incarceration is more consequential for marital or cohabiting unions. The high bar
associated with marital unions among low-income individuals may mean that relationship difficulties
may be more strongly felt (Tach and Edin 2013; also see Edin and Kefalas 2005). Relatedly, couples
in residential unions have more advantages than their counterparts in non-residential unions, and
these compositional differences may mean that selectivity into incarceration may be less consequen-
tial for those in residential unions. Another possibility is that incarceration is more consequential for
non-residential unions, as these relationships are weaker and more prone to disruption (Tach and
Edin 2013). A final possibility is that incarceration equally disrupts marital, cohabiting, and non-resi-
dential romantic relationships. Many features of incarceration--including the removal of men from
families and communities and the liminality associated with incarceration--may be difficult for all
types of couples. Similarly, the mechanisms linking incarceration to relationship dissolution--changes
in relationship quality, changes in economic well-being, and changes in physical and mental health--
may equally affect marital, cohabiting, and non-residential romantic relationships.
Threats to Causal Inference
Taken together, theory and existing evidence provide strong support that paternal incarceration in-
creases the likelihood of relationship dissolution. But another possibility is that any observed associa-
tion between incarceration and relationship dissolution reflects formidable selection forces.
Incarceration is unequally distributed across the population, with individuals experiencing incarcera-
tion (or the incarceration of a romantic partner) being more disadvantaged than their counterparts.
There are a number of men's and women's characteristics that might render the relationship between
incarceration and relationship dissolution spurious. These include demographic characteristics such
as race/ethnicity, nativity, childhood family structure, and religiosity (e.g., Amato 2000; Wakefield
and Uggen 2010); relationship characteristics such as duration, quality, and co-parenting (e.g., Brown
and Booth 1996; Tach and Edin 2013); socioeconomic characteristics such as education, income,
and residence in public housing (e.g., Amato 2000; Wakefield and Uggen 2010; Wildeman et al.
2012); and behavioral characteristics such as depression, substance abuse, impulsivity, and prior incar-
ceration (e.g., Wildeman et al. 2012).
Contributions of This Research
There are several opportunities to advance research on the consequences of incarceration for rela-
tionship dissolution. Importantly, though qualitative research considers the consequences of incarcer-
ation for both married and unmarried couples, little research systematically examines how
incarceration affects relationship dissolution among married, cohabiting, and non-residential romantic
partners. The nearly exclusive focus on divorce--as opposed to relationship dissolution more
broadly--is often necessary given data constraints, but unfortunate given that the majority of pris-
oners are in non-marital romantic relationships and that many of these relationships involve children
(Mumola 2000).
2. Indeed, demographic changes in the United States mean that children are increasingly growing up in diverse family structures.
Non-marital childbearing has risen steadily in recent years, and children born to unmarried parents now account for 41 percent
of all births in the United States, including 72 percent of births to African Americans and 53 percent of births to Hispanics
(Hamilton et al. 2014). About half of unmarried parents are cohabiting when their child is born (Martinez, Daniels, and
Chandra 2012).
Liminal Men  503
There are additional ways to extend the literature on incarceration and family instability in the
United States, all of which I address in this article. First, little research adjudicates between the direct
and indirect association between incarceration and relationship dissolution. There is evidence that in-
carceration duration explains the association between incarceration and divorce (Massoglia et al.
2011), but this research does not consider the more proximal family processes that may underlie this
relationship (such as changes in relationship quality, economic well-being, or physical and mental
health; though see Siennick et al. 2014). Additionally, the most comprehensive studies of incarcera-
tion and dissolution in the United States use data from the NLSY79 (Lopoo and Western 2005;
Massoglia et al. 2011), which only captures incarceration lasting at least one year (though, for re-
search on relatively short incarceration spells, see Siennick et al. 2014). Understanding whether and
how short-lived jail incarceration, in addition to long-term prison incarceration, affects family life is
important because cycling through jail is more commonly experienced than long-term prison spells
(e.g., Minton 2012:4) and it is plausible that short-term incarceration is a sufficiently weak treatment
that it is not associated with relationship dissolution.
DATA, MEASURES, AND ANALYTIC STRATEGY
Data Source
Data come from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing survey, a longitudinal study of 4,898 new
parents in 20 large U.S. cities (Reichman et al. 2001). Between 1998 and 2000, mothers completed a
30- to 40-minute interview at the hospital after their child was born and fathers were interviewed as
soon as possible after the birth (often in the hospital). Mothers and fathers were interviewed by tele-
phone when their children were approximately one, three, five, and nine years old. Of mothers who
responded to the baseline interview, 89 percent, 86 percent, 85 percent, and 76 percent completed
the one-, three-, five-, and nine-year surveys, respectively. About 78 percent, 69 percent, 67 percent,
64 percent, and 59 percent of fathers completed the baseline, one-, three-, five-, and nine-year
surveys.
These data are ideal for considering the consequences of incarceration for relationship dissolution
among parents. First, they comprise a large number of incarcerated men who, prior to incarceration,
are in marital, cohabiting, and non-residential romantic relationships with mothers of their children.
The demographic characteristics of these incarcerated fathers are comparable to those of men with
young children in local jails, state prisons, and federal prisons (Turney and Wildeman 2013:957).
Second, these data include an array of information about both partners, making it possible to rigor-
ously adjust for preexisting differences between couples that have and have not experienced incarcera-
tion. This includes characteristics strongly associated with selection into incarceration (e.g., substance
abuse, domestic violence, impulsivity, prior incarceration) and characteristics strongly associated with
relationship dissolution (e.g., relationship duration, relationship commitment). Given that both part-
ners' characteristics independently predict relationship dissolution (Tach and Edin 2013), not adjust-
ing for both mothers' and fathers' characteristics could result in omitted variable bias (Western and
Muller 2013). Finally, the longitudinal data allow for a careful consideration of time ordering to en-
sure incarceration precedes relationship dissolution.
Measures
Relationship Dissolution
The dependent variables include two dummy variables: (1) immediate dissolution, measured be-
tween the three- and five-year surveys; and (2) delayed dissolution, measured between the five- and
nine-year surveys. Relationship dissolution is measured when the mother reports being in a marital,
cohabiting, or non-residential romantic relationship with the focal child's father at the three-year sur-
vey and subsequently reports being in no relationship with the father at the five- or nine-year surveys,
504  Turney
respectively. These measures come from mothers' reports of relationship status with the father, op-
posed to fathers' reports of relationship status, as mothers have lower attrition rates.3
Of the currently incarcerated (see below), 23.6 percent are married, 27.8 percent are in a cohabit-
ing relationship, and 48.6 percent are in a non-residential romantic relationship (compared to 57.0
percent, 34.4 percent, and 8.6 percent of not currently incarcerated fathers, respectively). This, of
course, raises the question: How can one be in a cohabiting relationship with a father who is incarcer-
ated? Indeed, the measurement of cohabitation can be quite ambiguous (e.g., Nepomnyaschy and
Teitler 2013; Waller and Jones 2014). One of two things is likely going on. First, it is important to
note that mothers are considered to be cohabiting if they report living with the father "all or most" of
the time and, accordingly, it is possible that a mother living with the father prior to his incarceration
considers herself living with the father most of the time. Second, it is possible that, when asked this
question, mothers reference their living situation prior to incarceration, perhaps because they expect
the father to move back in after his incarceration stint ends (see, especially, Comfort 2008).
Furthermore, for mothers who were cohabiting with the father prior to his incarceration but do not
report they are cohabiting with the father when he is incarcerated, there is no reason to expect them
to report not being in a (non-residential) romantic relationship. The data do not allow me to test
this possibility, but qualitative research convincingly shows that unmarried women are in relation-
ships with incarcerated men and consider themselves to be involved with these men (see, especially,
Comfort 2008; also see Edin et al. 2004).
Incarceration
The primary explanatory variable is paternal incarceration, measured at the three-year survey. Fathers
are considered incarcerated if (1) the father is interviewed in prison or jail at the three-year survey or
(2) the father did not participate in the three-year survey but the mother reports he is in prison or
jail. The reliance on both parents' reports of incarceration is consistent with other research showing
the effectiveness of this approach (Geller et al. 2012).
Measuring incarceration at the three-year survey, as opposed to a more expansive indicator captur-
ing incarceration between survey waves, is necessary for establishing appropriate time ordering be-
tween incarceration and relationship dissolution. Though it is possible to construct a measure that
captures incarceration between the three- and five-year surveys, it is impossible to determine if incar-
ceration preceded or followed relationship dissolution (and theory suggests either is possible).4
Additionally, though measuring incarceration between the one- and three-year surveys would ensure
appropriate time ordering, it is not possible to precisely measure incarceration during this time pe-
riod. Only first-time incarceration is captured between the one- and three-year surveys, which means
that the comparison group would include fathers not incarcerated during this time period and fathers
who experienced a second or higher order incarceration during this time period. The data do include
measures of current paternal incarceration at the baseline and one-year surveys, but I focus on incar-
ceration at the three-year survey because this is the only wave where enough fathers are incarcerated
to conduct meaningful analyses. Importantly, though the measure of current incarceration necessi-
tates a relatively small number of incarcerated men, descriptive statistics comparing currently and re-
cently incarcerated men (defined as men incarcerated after the three-year survey and up to and
including the five-year survey, a common way of operationalizing fathers' incarceration with these
3. The majority of parents agree about their relationship status. At the five-year survey, for example, 96 percent of mothers and fa-
thers agree on marriage reports and 92 percent agree on cohabitation reports. At the nine-year survey, this was true of 97 percent
and 96 percent of mothers and fathers, respectively. Some of the small number of disagreements may result from time differences
between the mothers' and fathers' interviews (Knab and McLanahan 2006). Supplemental analyses adjusted for this time differ-
ence but they did not substantively alter the results and, therefore, are not included in the final analyses.
4. Only nine observations in the analytic sample have non-missing data on the date of incarceration entry and the date of relation-
ship dissolution (between the three- and five-year surveys), making it impossible to ascertain appropriate time ordering.
Liminal Men  505
data [e.g., Geller et al. 2012; Sugie 2012; Turney and Wildeman 2013]) shows few statistically or sub-
stantively significant differences between these two groups (see Appendix Table A1).
The incarceration measure is advantageous because it relies on both parents' reports, is measured
prior to relationship dissolution, and captures both jail and prison spells. The measure is limited,
though, because it does not take into account incarceration duration and offense type. Mothers were
asked questions about fathers' incarceration duration and offense type. But these questions contain
too much missing data--in the analytic sample, 45 percent of incarcerated fathers are missing data
about incarceration duration and 32 percent are missing data about offense type--to conduct mean-
ingful analyses. As previous research documents that both duration (Massoglia et al. 2011) and of-
fense type (Apel et al. 2010) influence dissolution, I address the implications of this limitation in the
discussion section.
Additional Covariates
Given that selection into incarceration is a key threat to causal inference, the multivariate analyses ad-
just for a host of demographic, relationship, economic, and behavioral characteristics that may alter
the association between incarceration and relationship dissolution. Importantly, unless otherwise
noted, all variables are measured at the baseline or one-year surveys and, thus, prior to the measure
of incarceration. To begin with, demographic factors include the following: mother's race (non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic other race); a dummy variable indicating
the mother and father are a mixed-race couple; dummy variables indicating mother's and father's im-
migrant status; continuous variables measuring mother's and father's age; dummy variables indicating
mother's and father's family structure at age 15; and mother's frequency of attendance at religious ser-
vices (weekly, occasionally, never).
Additionally, analyses adjust for relationship characteristics prior to incarceration. Dummy vari-
ables indicate the couple's relationship status at the focal child's birth (married, cohabiting, non-resi-
dential romantic relationship, separated). Continuous variables indicate relationship duration
(measured by mothers' reports of how long the couple knew each other before she became pregnant
with the focal child) and the mother's and father's reports of overall relationship quality (1 ¼ poor to
5 ¼ excellent). Mother's reports of father's shared responsibility in parenting averages responses to
how often the father does the following (1 ¼ never to 4 ¼ often): (1) looks after child when you need
to do things; (2) runs errands like picking things up from the store; (3) fixes things around the
home, paints, or helps make it look nicer in other ways; and (4) takes the child places he/she needs
to go such as to daycare or the doctor (a ¼ .73). Mother's reports of father's cooperation in parenting
averages the following (1 ¼ never to 4 ¼ always): (1) when father is with child, he acts like the kind
of parent you want for your child; (2) you can trust father to take good care of child; (3) father re-
spects the schedules and rules you make for child; (4) father supports you in the way you want to
raise child; (5) you and father talk about problems that come up with raising child; and (6) you can
count on father for help when you need someone to look after child for a few hours (a ¼ .84).
Dummy variables indicate the couple has additional children together, the mother has children with a
different partner, and the father has children with a different partner. Following prior research (Tach
and Edin 2013), relationship commitment is measured as a sum of mother's baseline reports of the
following: (1) father provided financial support during pregnancy; (2) the child will have father's last
name; and (3) the father visited the mother in the hospital (range: 0 to 3). Mother's pro-marriage at-
titudes averages the following (1 ¼ strongly disagree to 4 ¼ strongly agree): (1) the main advantage of
marriage is that it gives financial security; (2) there are more advantages to being single than to being
married (reverse coded); (3) a mother living alone can bring up her child as well as a married couple
(reverse coded); (4) it is better for a couple to get married than to just live together; (5) it is better
for children if their parents are married; and (6) living together is just the same as being married (re-
verse coded) (a ¼ .58). Mother's traditional attitudes is an average of the following (1 ¼ strongly dis-
agree to 4 ¼ strongly agree): (1) the important decisions in the family should be made by the man of
506  Turney
the house and (2) it is much better for everyone if the man earns the main living and the woman
takes care of the home and family (a ¼ .59). Mother's gender distrust is an average of the following
(1 ¼ strongly disagree to 4 ¼ strongly agree): (1) in a dating relationship, a man is largely out to take
advantage of a woman and (2) men cannot be trusted to be faithful (a ¼ .62).
Mother's and father's economic characteristics, all measured prior to incarceration, include educa-
tion, employment, income-to-poverty ratio, welfare receipt, and residence in public housing.
Educational attainment is measured with a series of dummy variables (less than high school, high
school diploma or GED, post-secondary education). Dummy variables indicate the mother and father
worked in the last week. The income-to-poverty ratio, based on reports of household size and com-
position, is the ratio of the total household income to the official poverty thresholds established by
the U.S. Census Bureau. A dummy variable indicates the mother received Temporary Assistance for
Needy Families (TANF) in the past year.
Finally, analyses adjust for mother's and father's physical and mental health prior to incarceration.
Mother's and father's major depression is measured by responses to the Composite International
Diagnostic Interview Short Form (CIDI-SF) Version 1.0 (Kessler et al. 1998). Parenting stress is
measured by averaging the following responses (1 ¼ strongly disagree to 4 ¼ strongly agree): (1) being
a parent is harder than I thought it would be; (2) I feel trapped by my responsibilities as a parent;
(3) taking care of my children is much more work than pleasure; (4) I often feel tired, worn out, or
exhausted from raising a family (a ¼ .60 for mothers, a ¼ .58 for fathers). Dummy variables indicate
the mother and father report fair or poor health. Dummy variables indicate heavy drinking (the
mother or father reports having four or more drinks in one sitting) and illicit drug use in the past
month. Domestic violence is a dummy variable indicating the mother reported the father hit, slapped,
or kicked her. Father's impulsivity is an average of the following (1 ¼ strongly disagree to 4 ¼ strongly
agree): (1) I will often say whatever comes into my head without thinking first; (2) often, I don't
spend enough time thinking over a situation before I act; (3) I often say and do things without con-
sidering the consequences; (4) I often get into trouble because I don't think before I act; (5) many
times, the plans I make don't work out because I haven't gone over them carefully enough in ad-
vance; (6) I often make up my mind without taking the time to consider the situation from all angles
(a ¼ .84). A dummy variable indicates the father was ever incarcerated at or prior to the one-year sur-
vey (including prior to baseline).5
Mechanisms
In some analyses, I examine four sets of mechanisms that may explain the relationship between incar-
ceration and relationship dissolution: (1) extended incarceration, a dummy variable indicating the fa-
ther was incarcerated at the five-year survey; (2) relationship quality after incarceration entry,
measured by mother and father overall relationship quality, father shared responsibility in parenting,
father cooperation in parenting, and reports of domestic violence at the three-year survey; (3) eco-
nomic well-being after incarceration entry, measured by mother and father employment and income-
to-poverty ratio at the three-year survey; and (4) health after incarceration entry, measured by
mother and father depression, mother and father fair or poor health, and father heavy drinking and il-
licit drug use at the three-year survey.
Analytic Sample
The primary analytic sample comprises 2,201 observations. I first deleted the 2,488 observations in
which the mother did not report being in a relationship with the focal child's father at the three-year
5. Ideally, I would measure prior incarceration by considering a father as being previously incarcerated if he experienced any incar-
ceration through the three-year survey (but was not incarcerated at the three-year survey). However, measuring prior incarcera-
tion in this manner would mean that all previously incarcerated men are coded as not currently incarcerated. This lack of
variation makes it impossible to match on previous incarceration and, therefore, I consider prior incarceration through the one-
year survey.
Liminal Men  507
survey, as these observations are not at risk of relationship dissolution. I then deleted the additional
209 observations in which the mother did not complete the five-year survey.6 Importantly, it is proba-
ble this analytic sample excludes men incarcerated at the three-year survey who already experienced
dissolution prior to the three-year survey (but after their incarceration). Given that it is likely that the
proportion of incarcerated men whose relationships dissolved exceeds the proportion of non-incar-
cerated men whose relationships dissolved, estimates should be considered conservative consequences
of incarceration. This analytic sample also excludes couples that already dissolved their union and,
therefore, is selective of more advantaged and stable couples, again suggesting conservative estimates.
The vast majority of variables are missing data for fewer than 2 percent of observations.
Exceptions include several variables that come from fathers' interviews (father's reports of relation-
ship quality [missing 25 percent of observations], father's parenting stress [24 percent], and father's
impulsivity [24 percent]), as attrition was higher among fathers than mothers (though, when fathers
did not participate and when possible, I use mothers' reports of fathers' information (e.g., father's
race/ethnicity, father's education). I preserve missing values with multiple imputation, producing 25
imputed data sets and averaging results across data sets.
Analytic Strategy
The analytic strategy contains three stages. In the first analytic stage (Tables 2, 3, and 4), propensity
score models estimate the consequences of incarceration for immediate relationship dissolution (be-
tween the three- and five-year surveys) and delayed relationship dissolution (between the five- and
nine-year surveys, conditional on not experiencing immediate relationship dissolution). Propensity
score matching is one way to diminish concerns about observed heterogeneity between groups, and,
indeed, there are important pre-incarceration differences between couples that do and do not experi-
ence paternal incarceration. Propensity score matching is also useful given the relatively small number
of men incarcerated at the three-year survey. This method approximates an experimental design by
using observed variables to comprise a treatment group (incarcerated fathers) and a control group
(not incarcerated fathers) that have a similar distribution of covariates (and vary only by incarcera-
tion). However, propensity score matching is limited because it cannot account for unobserved charac-
teristics of individuals, a point I return to in the discussion.
A logistic regression model generates a propensity score, which signifies the probability of incar-
ceration, as a function of 50 pre-incarceration covariates for each observation in each of the 25 im-
puted data sets. I match observations on propensity scores, restrict the analyses to regions of
common support, check the balance of the covariates to ensure that the treatment and control groups
have similar values on observed covariates (Morgan and Harding 2006), and estimate relationship
dissolution as a function of incarceration. The analyses presented use kernel matching (treatment
N ¼ 69, control N ¼ 2,124), comparing each treatment observation with all control observations that
are weighted according to their distance from treatment cases (bandwidth ¼ .006; ker-
nel ¼ epanechnikov), though supplemental analyses using alternative matching strategies (e.g., near-
est neighbor with five neighbors, nearest neighbor with ten neighbors, radius) produce similar
estimates. I average logistic regression results estimating relationship dissolution across the 25 im-
puted data sets.
In additional analyses, I take three steps to consider the robustness of the findings. First, because
there may be subtle differences between the treatment and control groups after matching, I conduct
doubly robust propensity score analyses by further adjusting for all covariates (Schafer and Kang
2008). Second, I minimize (though do not eliminate) unobserved heterogeneity by restricting the
sample to a potentially more appropriate comparison group, observations where the father
6. Fathers did not have to be interviewed at the five-year survey to be included in the analytic sample. Also, the analytic sample
used to estimate relationship dissolution between the five- and nine-year surveys is smaller (n ¼ 1,770) because it excludes par-
ents who did not participate in the nine-year survey.
508  Turney
experienced previous incarceration (LaLonde 1986). Third, I estimate Mantel-Haenszel bounds to
evaluate how sensitive the propensity score results are to such unmeasured characteristics (Becker
and Caliendo 2007). The Mantel-Haenszel bounds quantify how large unobserved factors would
have to be to render the association between incarceration and relationship dissolution statistically
insignificant.
In the second analytic stage (Table 5), propensity score models estimate the association between
incarceration and relationship dissolution for two subgroups: couples living together at baseline and
couples not living together at baseline. I consider variation by relationship status at baseline because
it is an important predictor of both union formation and dissolution (Carlson, McLanahan, and
England 2008; Tach and Edin 2013) and to ensure that I am measuring relationship status prior to in-
carceration. There are a small number of fathers incarcerated at the baseline survey. In the analyses
presented, these fathers are considered to be not living together at baseline; however, supplemental
analyses that instead consider them to be living together at baseline produce substantively similar
results.
In the final analytic stage (Table 6), I adjudicate between the direct and indirect association be-
tween incarceration and dissolution by considering four sets of mechanisms that may explain the as-
sociation between incarceration and relationship dissolution: extended incarceration, relationship
quality after incarceration entry, economic well-being after incarceration entry, and physical and men-
tal health after incarceration entry. Logistic regression models estimate relationship dissolution as a
function of the mechanisms, controlling for the treatment and the propensity for the treatment (Kirk
and Sampson 2013). Model 1 presents the baseline estimate for the association between incarceration
and relationship dissolution. Model 2 includes an indicator of extended incarceration. Model 3 in-
cludes relationship quality, Model 4 includes economic characteristics, and Model 5 includes physical
and mental health.7 Model 6 adjusts for all possible mechanisms. I compare Model 1 to Models 2, 3,
4, 5, and 6 to examine what percentage of the association between incarceration and relationship dis-
solution can be explained by these mechanisms. Because comparing coefficients across logistic regres-
sion models is not recommended (Mood 2010), I also estimate linear probability models and
compare the results from the logistic and linear probability models. Further, I conduct formal Sobel-
Goodman tests of mediation. The Sobel-Goodman tests the following: (1) the relationship between
incarceration and each proposed mediator; (2) the relationship between each proposed mediator and
relationship dissolution; (3) the relationship between incarceration and relationship dissolution with-
out the mediator; and (4) the relationship between incarceration and relationship dissolution without
the mediator (and the difference in the relationship with and without the mediator) (Baron and
Kenny 1986; Sobel 1986).8
Sample Description
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics of all variables. In the analytic sample, which includes parents in
a relationship when their children are three years old, almost two-fifths of relationships dissolved be-
tween the three- and nine-year surveys. About 21 percent of relationships dissolved within two years
(between the three- and five-year surveys), and an additional 16 percent dissolved between the five-
and nine-year surveys. With respect to the key explanatory variable, about 3 percent of fathers are in-
carcerated at the three-year survey.
With respect to demographic characteristics, more than one-quarter (28 percent) of the mothers
are non-Hispanic white, nearly two-fifths (38 percent) are non-Hispanic black, and nearly one-third
7. Father's and, especially, mother's repartnering may be another relationship characteristic that links incarceration to relationship
dissolution. Unfortunately, it is impossible to establish time ordering between repartnering and dissolution and, as such, I cannot
consider this mechanism in my analyses.
8. These tests were performed with the sgmediation command in Stata. However, because this command does not handle binary
outcomes or multiply imputed data, I conducted the analyses with linear probability models and one imputed data set.

(30 percent) are Hispanic. About 13 percent of couples are mixed-race couples. One-fifth of respon-
dents (20 percent of mothers and 21 percent of fathers) are foreign born. Mothers and fathers were,
on average, 26 and 29 years old when the focal child was born, respectively. Nearly two-fifths (39 per-
cent) of couples were married, two-fifths (41 percent) were cohabiting, and one-fifth (18 percent)
were in a non-residential romantic relationship at the birth. More than two-fifths (45 percent) of par-
ents have an additional child together, though many parents (30 percent of mothers and 28 percent
of fathers) have children with other partners. More than half (52 percent) of mothers and nearly
three-fifths (58 percent) of fathers did not have education beyond a high school diploma or GED.
More than one-fifth (21 percent) of fathers were incarcerated prior to the three-year survey.
RESULTS
Descriptive Differences in Relationship Dissolution by Incarceration
Descriptive statistics, presented in Figure 1, show dramatic differences in relationship dissolution by
fathers' incarceration. For example, nearly three-fifths (58 percent) of incarcerated fathers, compared
to just one-fifth (20 percent) of not incarcerated fathers, experienced relatively immediate relation-
ship dissolution (i.e., dissolution that occurred between the three- and five-year surveys). Further, af-
ter restricting the sample to couples that did not experience immediate dissolution, there are large
descriptive differences in delayed relationship dissolution (i.e., dissolution that occurred between the
five- and nine-year surveys). About 54 percent of incarcerated fathers and 20 percent of not incarcer-
ated fathers experienced dissolution.
Propensity Score Models Estimating Relationship Dissolution
Pre- and Post-Match Differences
The first step of propensity score matching involves generating propensity scores of incarceration as
a function of the covariates in Table 1. These analyses, not presented but available upon request, are
consistent with expectations. For example, non-Hispanic black mothers, compared to non-Hispanic
white mothers, have about 2.78 times the odds of sharing a child with an incarcerated father.
Employed fathers have a lower likelihood of incarceration than their non-employed counterparts, and
fathers' reports of relationship quality are negatively correlated with incarceration. This model fits the
data well, explaining about two-fifths (41 percent) of the variance in incarceration.
Next, I present descriptive differences between the treatment and control groups, both prior to
matching and after matching. The first three columns of Table 2 show that, as expected, there are
substantial descriptive differences between couples that did and did not experience the fathers'
incarceration. For example, incarcerated fathers and their partners are more likely to be racial/ethnic
minorities, have lower educational attainment, lower income-to-poverty ratios, and more multi-
partnered fertility. Incarcerated fathers also have more impulsive behaviors and are more likely to
have been previously incarcerated. The remaining columns in Table 2 present descriptive differences
between the treatment and control group after matching. These columns show that, after matching,
the differences between the treatment and control group are small and, across all imputed data sets,
statistically insignificant.
Estimating Relationship Dissolution
Table 3 presents estimates from propensity score matching that document differences in relationship
dissolution by incarceration. The unmatched estimates show that incarceration is associated with a
greater likelihood of immediate dissolution (b ¼ 1.743; OR ¼ 5.71, p < .001) and, among those cou-
ples who remain together through the five-year survey, a greater likelihood of delayed dissolution
(b ¼ 1.550, OR ¼ 4.71, p < .001). Although the matched differences are smaller in magnitude than
the unmatched differences, the link between paternal incarceration and immediate relationship
512  Turney
dissolution remains robust. Incarcerated fathers, compared to their counterparts, have more than two
times the odds of experiencing immediate relationship dissolution (b ¼ .820, OR ¼ 2.27, p < .01).
However, the matched estimates show no differences in delayed dissolution between incarcerated
and not incarcerated men, suggesting that, when partners manage to survive the initial period, incar-
ceration has no lasting consequences for dissolution.9
Table 3 also presents results from two strategies used to consider the robustness of the findings.
The first strategy, the estimation of doubly robust propensity scores, further adjusts for all covariates
included in the matching equation. These findings, which are consistent with the results that do not
adjust for these covariates, show that incarceration is associated with a greater likelihood of immediate
dissolution (b ¼ 1.063, OR ¼ 2.90, p < .01) but not delayed dissolution (b ¼ -.124, OR ¼ .88, n.s.).
The second strategy compares incarcerated men to a potentially more appropriate comparison group,
men who experienced prior incarceration but were not currently incarcerated. These results show that
incarcerated men, compared to their previously but not currently incarcerated counterparts, have a
greater likelihood of immediate dissolution (b ¼ 1.318, OR ¼ 3.74, p < .05).10 Finally, Table 4 pre-
sents results from the Mantel-Haenszel bounds sensitivity analyses, another strategy used to document
the robustness of the findings. Given the propensity score matching results show incarceration is only
significantly associated with immediate relationship dissolution, I restrict this table to that outcome.
These findings show that any unobserved characteristics not included in the propensity score would

9. Readers should exercise caution when interpreting these results, as the null findings may result from the small number of cases
in the treatment group instead of a lack of differences between the two groups, and future research with a larger sample should
investigate this possibility. I conducted two robustness checks (not presented but available upon request). First, I restricted the
sample estimating immediate relationship dissolution to the smaller sample used to estimate delayed relationship dissolution
(which is smaller because of higher attrition at the nine-year survey than the five-year survey). Results are consistent, suggesting
the differential findings for immediate and delayed dissolution do not result from different samples. Second, given the relatively
frequent relationship churning among couples in the Fragile Families data, I considered a more stringent measure of relation-
ship dissolution, considering couples to have dissolved their union if the mother reported not being in a relationship with the
father at the five- and nine-year surveys. Indeed, a nontrivial number of couples (16 percent) reported dissolution at the five-
year survey and a romantic relationship with the father at the nine-year survey. Results are even larger in magnitude when using
this more stringent dependent variable.
10. In estimates of delayed relationship dissolution, too few incarcerated men experienced previous incarceration to make meaning-
ful comparisons.

have to increase the odds of being incarcerated by 370 percent (C ¼ 3.7) for the full sample and by
140 percent (C ¼ 2.4) for the previously incarcerated sample. Thus, although it is possible that unob-
served characteristics could render the relationship between incarceration and relationship dissolution
statistically insignificant, these unobserved selection forces would need to be substantial.
Incarceration and Relationship Dissolution, by Relationship Status
In Table 5, I consider the possibility that the association between incarceration and relationship dis-
solution varies by relationship status prior to incarceration. Given that results for the full sample
show no association between incarceration and delayed relationship dissolution, I only consider im-
mediate relationship dissolution here. The first row considers the association between incarceration
and relationship dissolution among couples living together at baseline. The findings are consistent
with results for the full sample, with the matched estimates showing that incarceration is associated
with a greater likelihood of dissolution within two years (b ¼ 1.603, OR ¼ 4.97, p < .001). The sec-
ond set of models considers the association between incarceration and dissolution among couples
not living together at baseline, and the matched estimates show no association between incarceration
and relationship dissolution (b ¼ .126, OR ¼ 1.13, n.s.). Tests for differences across the two groups
(Paternoster et al. 1998) show the differences are statistically significant (z ¼ 2.378), suggesting that
results are concentrated among co-residential couples.11 See Figure 2 for predicted probabilities of re-
lationship dissolution by residential status prior to incarceration.
Mechanisms Underlying the Association between Incarceration and Relationship Dissolution
The association between incarceration and relationship dissolution may result directly from incarcera-
tion or may result from a number of pathways, and I consider these possibilities in Table 6. The base-
line estimate, a logistic regression model estimating relationship dissolution as a function of
incarceration and the propensity for incarceration, is presented in Model 1. In Model 2, I adjust for
extended incarceration, a dummy variable indicating that the father is incarcerated at the five-year

survey, which reduces both the magnitude (by 41 percent) and statistical significance of the
association. These results, especially, should be interpreted with caution, as fathers incarcerated at the
three- and five-year surveys were not necessarily continuously incarcerated and dissolution could
have preceded incarceration.
The next three models consider relationship quality, economic well-being, and health as mecha-
nisms. In Model 3, which adjusts for post-incarceration and pre-dissolution relationship quality, the
association between paternal incarceration is reduced by 61 percent and to statistical insignificance.

Considering each of the five indicators of relationship quality separately shows that shared responsi-
bility in parenting and cooperation in parenting are the most important mediators, explaining, respec-
tively, 67 percent and 22 percent of the association. Economic well-being (Model 4) and health
(Model 5) explain 3 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of the association between incarceration
and relationship dissolution. The model that includes all potential mechanisms, Model 6, shows no
statistically significant association between incarceration and relationship dissolution. In fact, in this
model even extended incarceration is not significantly associated with relationship dissolution.12

ity models estimating relationship dissolution as a function of incarceration and the mechanisms. These linear probability mod-
els produced results consistent with those from the logistic regression models. Extended incarceration, relationship quality,
economic well-being, and health explain, respectively, 42 percent, 75 percent, 1 percent, and 13 percent of the association be-
tween paternal incarceration and relationship dissolution. Furthermore, the salience of relationship quality--and, in particular,
shared responsibility in parenting and co-parenting--as a mediator is confirmed with formal Sobel-Goodman tests of
mediation.

DISCUSSION
A growing literature investigates the collateral consequences of mass incarceration for family life, doc-
umenting negative consequences for the women (Braman 2004; Comfort 2008; Geller et al. 2011;
Geller and Franklin 2014; Schwartz-Soicher et al. 2011; Sugie 2012; Turney 2014a; Turney et al.
2012; Wildeman et al. 2012) and children (Geller et al. 2012; Murray and Farrington 2008; Turney
and Haskins 2014; Wakefield and Wildeman 2013) connected to incarcerated and formerly incarcer-
ated men. But despite this burgeoning literature, and despite the fact that much research on the dele-
terious consequences of incarceration for women and children suggest these associations operate
through relationship dissolution (e.g., Geller et al. 2012; Schwartz-Soicher et al. 2011; Turney and
Wildeman 2013; Wildeman et al. 2012), little research considers how the liminal carceral period af-
fects relationship dissolution among parents with young children. This is an important oversight
given the large number of already disadvantaged children affected by both incarceration and the dis-
solution of parental relationships.
In this article, I use longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a data
source distinctively positioned to examine the collateral consequences of incarceration for relation-
ship dissolution. The results yield three main conclusions. Perhaps most consequentially, results
show that among couples with children, incarceration leads to a greater likelihood of relatively imme-
diate relationship dissolution (dissolution that occurs between the three- and five-year surveys). The
findings are consistent across a variety of specifications, all of which match incarcerated fathers to
their non-incarcerated counterparts. Importantly, given that couples dissolving their union before their
child was three years old are excluded from the analytic sample, these results are almost certainly con-
servative. Though I consider dissolution to be an undesirable outcome, primarily because of its harm-
ful consequences for children, it is also possible that incarceration has positive, liberating
consequences for women. Incarceration provides women with the freedom to reorganize family life
to exclude their incarcerated partner, perhaps paradoxically given the lack of freedom afforded to in-
carcerated and recently released men.
Second, I find that incarceration is associated with dissolution among couples living together prior
to incarceration but not among non-residential couples. Considering this variation by residential sta-
tus is important, as it bridges the quantitative research on the association between incarceration and
divorce (Lopoo and Western 2005; Massoglia et al. 2011; Siennick et al. 2014; Western 2006)
and the qualitative literature on mostly unmarried couples (Edin et al. 2004; Nurse 2002; Waller and
Swisher 2006; though see Arditti 2012; Comfort 2008). Couples in non-residential relationships face
an array of challenges to maintaining relationships (Tach and Edin 2010) and, accordingly, incarcera-
tion is not independently associated with the dissolution of these relationships. Importantly, by show-
ing that incarceration is consequential for both marital and cohabiting unions, these results also
suggest that previous quantitative research, which has nearly exclusively considered marital dissolu-
tion, may underestimate the consequences of incarceration for family life.
Third, I find that two plausible mechanisms--including extended incarceration and relationship
quality (especially mothers' relationship quality)--explain a rather substantial portion of the associa-
tion between incarceration and relationship dissolution. The findings about extended incarceration
are consistent with other research (Massoglia et al. 2011). And the findings about relationship quality
are consistent with other research finding that relationship problems (especially low marital love and
extra-marital sex) are important intervening mechanisms linking incarceration to divorce (Siennick
et al. 2014). Importantly, though, fathers' shared responsibility in parenting and cooperation in par-
enting are the most substantial intervening mechanisms. The fact that these parenting behaviors are
so important is broadly consistent with qualitative research on incarceration (Braman 2004), research
suggesting incarceration destroys co-parental relationships (Turney and Wildeman 2013), and re-
search on the "package deal" of marriage and parenthood (Tach et al. 2010).
Taken together, these findings make several important theoretical and empirical contributions.
Theoretically, I draw on the work of Turner (1969), who first put forth the idea of liminality
Liminal Men  521
(primarily to describe rites of passage), to suggest that incarceration embodies a liminal experience.
Incarcerated men are "betwixt and between" (Turner 1969:95). They are currently separated and iso-
lated from their families. But, at the same time, they are members of families and eventually will be
reintegrated into society and at least some of their family roles. Unfortunately, these data are not de-
signed to test the concept of liminality and, accordingly, this is merely a framework for understanding
the conditions of incarcerated men as family members. Future research, especially qualitative research
that may be especially suited to examine this (e.g., Menjivar 2006), should conceptualize and measure
the liminality experienced by the incarcerated, test hypotheses about the consequences of liminality
for family life, and compare and contrast consider additional types of liminal states (e.g., undocu-
mented immigrants, military personnel).
Empirically, these findings advance our knowledge about incarceration and relationship dissolu-
tion in several ways. First, I consider dissolution among married, cohabiting, and non-residential ro-
mantic couples. The consideration of multiple relationship types is important because the modal
prisoner is in a romantic relationship but not a marital one. This is also important because
children--especially children in disadvantaged communities where incarceration is common--are
increasingly born to unmarried parents and experience deleterious outcomes when these unions
dissolve. I also consider both short-term jail spells, the most common type of incarceration, and long-
term prison spells, although future data collection efforts should distinguish between jail and prison
experiences.
There are additional contributions of this research. I consider the family-level mechanisms linking
incarceration to relationship dissolution and adjust for characteristics of both partners, thereby as-
suaging some threats to causal inference. Also, the longitudinal data allows for a consideration of
both immediate and delayed relationship dissolution. This distinction is important, as findings show
that relationships surviving the initial post-incarceration period suffer no deleterious consequences, at
least with respect to dissolution, consistent with qualitative research showing that some relationships
thrive during incarceration (Comfort 2008). Finally, I consider men with children, an especially im-
portant demographic group given the consequences of father absence for child well-being (Sigle-
Rushton and McLanahan 2004).13
Limitations
Though these data provide an exceptional opportunity to examine the consequences of incarceration
for family life, and are commonly used to answer such questions, there are several data limitations,
many of which have already been discussed. First, these observational data, coupled with the non-
random selection of individuals into incarceration, preclude causal conclusions. Although I take great
strides to reduce unobserved heterogeneity--via propensity score matching, further adjusting for
observed covariates, restricting the sample to fathers at risk of incarceration, and considering how
large unobserved factors would have to be to render the association spurious--the analyses do not
rule out all possible unobserved heterogeneity, and future research should strive to employ creative
research designs situated in a counterfactual, or causal, framework.
Additionally, the incarceration measure is limited. It is possible that incarceration lasting one
month is likely differentially associated with relationship dissolution than incarceration lasting one
year, and prison incarceration and jail incarceration may differentially affect relationship dissolution.
Similarly, the association between incarceration and relationship dissolution may vary by the father's
distance from home or the frequency of mother's visits. These data provide inadequate opportunities
to consider such nuances. The data also do not include the precise timing of relationship dissolution,
and is instead limited to broad time periods (between the three- and five-year surveys and between
13. Importantly, results would likely be even stronger if I were to consider both men with and without children, as research sug-
gests that the association between incarceration and relationship dissolution is stronger for men without children (Apel et al.
2010).

the five-and nine-year surveys). Future quantitative research should collect data at more regular inter-
vals (e.g., weekly, monthly) to both more precisely identify the timing of dissolution and further un-
ravel the familial and decision-making processes leading to dissolution. Future qualitative research
should investigate how incarcerated men and their partners define and describe their relationships, as
cohabitation can be difficult to measure and the survey data shown here suggest that women report
living together with men who are incarcerated (Knab and McLanahan 2006).
Finally, a consideration of time ordering (e.g., ensuring incarceration precedes dissolution) neces-
sitates an examination of current incarceration--as opposed to incarceration that occurred in the re-
cent past--and, as such, the number of incarcerated fathers is small (even though the full Fragile
Families sample includes a relatively large number of incarcerated men). This is especially true be-
cause the sample is further limited by fathers at risk of relationship dissolution (those in a romantic
relationship at the three-year survey). However, descriptive analyses show few differences between
currently incarcerated men and recently incarcerated men and the careful consideration of time or-
dering is necessary to most rigorously estimate the relationship between incarceration and dissolu-
tion. The relatively small number of incarcerated men plagues most existing research on incarceration
and relationship dissolution (e.g., Massoglia et al. 2011; Siennick et al. 2014) and researchers should
consider designing a longitudinal survey of incarcerated men and their family members.
Conclusions
This article documents that paternal incarceration is associated with relatively immediate relationship
dissolution among parents and that this association is explained by both extended incarceration and
post-incarceration changes in relationship quality. Broadly, these findings add to a rapidly growing lit-
erature on the consequences of paternal incarceration for family life and family inequality. Similar to
the recent demographic changes that have transformed family life--such as trends in non-marital
childbearing--incarceration rates have increased rapidly over the past four decades. Incarcerated indi-
viduals, though, do not exist in isolation. Instead, while incarcerated, they experience a period of limi-
nality where they are both connected to and disconnected from families. By documenting how and
under what conditions the collateral consequences of incarceration extend beyond the offender, and
spill over to the families of offenders, this research highlights the considerable influence and unin-
tended consequences of the penal system.
