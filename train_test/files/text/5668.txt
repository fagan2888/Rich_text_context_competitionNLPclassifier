The void in studying the lives of Black women within
their own uniqueness calls for a repositioning of schol-
arship in the field of psychology in ways that make it
more contextually responsive to the lived experiences
of this population. Initially, this involves widespread
recognition of the discipline's ethnocentrism and its
failure to consider the sociocultural validity and gen-
eralizability of its research.
Thomas, 2004, p. 288
Historically, common knowledge and scientific evidence
have been used to rationalize mistreatment of certain racial
groups in the United States (Lopez, 1994, 1996). In com-
parison to White men, minority groups in the United States
occupy a particularly socially disadvantaged position.
Critical examinations of epistemology argue that White men
have established the guidelines for knowledge, and their
construction and reproduction of knowledge regarding how
the world is to be represented is often taken as absolute truth
(Code, 1991). This matter-of-fact approach to establishing
common knowledge gives rise to an environment that sup-
ports the appropriation of knowledge. The appropriation of
knowledge is a tool for maintaining and preserving power,
for once you control knowledge, your power is limitless.
People of color have a unique viewpoint that is often not
represented in the common knowledge perspective (Crenshaw,
Gotanda, Peller, & Thomas, 1995), which has led to a defi-
ciency in the Western scientific knowledge base.An important
point to consider is how this exclusion of minority groups in
the construction of knowledge has affected the comprehen-
siveness of available mental health knowledge and thus the
field of psychology. In 1999, Surgeon General David Satcher
summoned scholars globally to join efforts to generate a more
inclusive body of research exploring mental health data. For
instance, compared with non-Hispanic Whites, research
reveals that Blacks are more likely to suffer from a mental ill-
ness yet less likely to seek treatment, and when they do seek
treatment, they are more likely to use emergency rooms for
mental health care and thus are more likely to require inpatient
care (Fortuna, Alegria, & Gao, 2010; Satcher, 1999; Tara,
Alegría, Mendieta, & Linhart, 2011). Conversely, scholars
argue that mistrust and concerns of discrimination and inac-
curate diagnoses among Blacks affect the accuracy of these
trends (Burgess, Ding, Hargreaves, Ryn, & Phelan, 2008;
Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, 2007; Suite, Bril,
Primm, & Harrison-Ross, 2007).

"The Missing Link":The Exclusion of
Black Women in Psychological Research
and the Implications for Black Women's
Mental Health
Kamesha Spates1
Abstract
Critical examinations of epistemology argue thatWhite men have established the guidelines for scientific knowledge.Because
other groups were never allotted the opportunity to contribute to the immense knowledge base, the Western scientific
knowledge base remains deficient.The author calls for a more inclusive knowledge base that includes the voices of Black
women in the field of psychology.This inclusion is critical to better equip mental health clinicians to handle the unique needs
of this population.This article offers a historical analysis of the intricate relationship between race and scientific knowledge.
The author examines how the close-knit relationship between race and science has directly influenced the existing scientific
knowledge gaps surrounding Black women in the field of psychology and calls for literature to offer a more comprehensive
view of Black women's experiences.

Although misdiagnosing of mental illnesses occurs in the
general population, it occurs on a more frequent basis among
Blacks. For example, a recent study revealed an over diag-
nosing of schizophrenia in the Black population. The authors
conclude that widespread misinterpretation of African
American cultural differences and clinician biases play an
important role in misdiagnosing Blacks (Gara et al., 2012).
Although explanations for these discrepancies are unclear,
many scholars argue that practitioners' inability to identify
and comprehend viewpoints, behaviors, and mental health
outcomes of racially and ethnically diverse populations has
created daunting challenges in the field of psychology
(Alegria, Atkins, Farmer, Slaton, & Stelk, 2010; Comas-
Diaz, 1991; Thomas, 2004).
Existing knowledge gaps in mental health literature are
further magnified when exploring mental health issues
among Black women. Black women's experiences are sig-
nificantly lacking in the psychology literature. According to
Thomas (2004), this lack "results in missing bricks of foun-
dational knowledge" and "yield[s] a psychological knowl-
edge base that is faulty, inadequate, and incomplete" (p.
287). As a result, practitioners frequently have trouble
explaining culturally specific behaviors among Black women
within the traditional boundaries of psychology.
Contemporary feminist literature, such as feminist psy-
chology, offers social scientists a new framework to explore
the unique social stressors of women and girls in the mental
health arena. Yet, feminist psychology still neglects to exam-
ine the unique struggles of Black women. This article extends
the existing literature by offering a historical analysis of how
the strained relationship among race, gender, and science
was fundamental in constructing a social environment that
ultimately resulted in existing knowledge gaps regarding
Black women in the field of psychology. The author argues
that feminist psychology has failed to address the knowledge
gaps of Black women in the field of psychology and suggests
that combining Black feminist thought and feminist psychol-
ogy frameworks can provide mental health clinicians with a
more comprehensive perspective. This article also includes
discussions of the unique oppressive conditions of contem-
porary Black women and examines the direct mental health
implications of these occurrences.
Historical Constructions of Race
Through ScientificValidation
Science is embedded in various aspects of our daily lives.
However, concerns of the accuracy of some scientific
knowledge have emerged (Duster, 2003), as have concerns
over the lack of knowledge regarding viewpoints of minority
groups. To understand why basic information regarding
Black women is virtually absent from behavioral sciences,
particularly psychology, it is important to examine the asso-
ciation between Western science ideologies, common knowl-
edge (Lopez, 1996), and construction of race and gender in
the United States. Dating back to the 18th century, common
knowledge and scientific evidence have been used to ratio-
nalize mistreatment of certain racial groups in the United
States. Scientists of the day sought to scientifically validate
racialized and gendered perceptions of the "common" White
man (Lopez, 1996). As a result, common knowledge and
scientific validation, although actually contradictory, came
to be synonymous. This contradictory knowledge was used
to establish societal perceptions of racial and gender differ-
ences, and to deny women and people of color citizenship
and basic human rights, granting only White men authorita-
tive power over society (Bell, 2000; Kaplan, 2010; Lopez,
1994, 1996; Smedley & Smedley, 2005).
Scientific claims were used to justify the belief in the infe-
riority of women and people of color. For example, scientific
evidence garnered through craniometry and Eugenics was
heavily relied on to maintain the existence of gendered and
racial hierarchies. During the early 1900s, craniometry, which
declared that cranial size and brain weight were directly
correlated to intelligence, was regarded as providing valid,
reliable scientific evidence. It was assumed that the smaller
the individual's brain size, the less intelligent the person. This
study implied that women and African Americans were intel-
lectually underdeveloped (Haraway, 1997).
During the same era, Eugenics, which involves the study
of the physical and mental qualities of human beings
through genetics, was also a popular scientific explanation.
Eugenics attempted to label people of color as inferior
based on genetics, rather than brain size. Intelligence,
health implications, and scientific claims have all at one
point or another been linked to Eugenics, and some still are
(Duster, 2003). For instance, IQ tests are still administered
to children nationwide, despite the fact that these tests have
been proven to contain cultural biases. According to Smith
(2003), dependence on culturally biased tests is directly related
to education disparities, which result in elevated high school
dropout rates among minorities. Smith (2003) stated,
The reasons for this pervasive misidentification and
referral of African-American children were found by
the President's Commission to include "reliance on IQ
tests that have known cultural bias" and the fact that
"minority children are much more likely to be placed
in the emotional disturbance category because of
behavioral characteristics associated with the cultural
context in which a child is raised." The mental retarda-
tion category of Special Education is under the control
of specialists too often using IQ tests that were devel-
oped with a concern for their validity with White
populations and sub-groups, but with no concern with
their validity with minority populations. When their
originators found that girls were doing better than
boys on early versions of the test, they changed the
tests rather than their ideas about the relative skill of
girls and boys at such tasks. But when it was found
Spates 3
that the tests failed to deal equitably among ethnic and
racial groups, the test developers took this to be a con-
firmation of the tests' validity. This is not news. It is
now generally acknowledged that IQ tests, and the
very concept of IQ, were deeply implicated in early
twentieth-century racist theories. And yet they con-
tinue to be used. (p. 1)
Following craniometry and Eugenics, from the 1940s
through 1975, scientists began using ABO blood-maker fre-
quencies as a source of knowledge. This information was
used for all sorts of purposes, ranging from social sciences to
medical sciences. Scientists asserted that there were blood
differences between the racial and ethnic groups, and used
the implication that individual races had common blood
types to discourage miscegenation. Furthermore, according
to Haraway (1997), blood was used as an inclusive determin-
ing factor. Although the use of blood-maker frequencies is
no longer an appropriate measure, it does illustrate historical
evidence of the earlier blood­race relationship.
From 1975 to 1990, biological kinship categories shifted
from blood frequency tests to genetic mapping and deoxy-
ribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis. A person's DNA attaches
an individual to a gene, and this gene is said to provide a
map to our true heritage. Unfortunately, these results might
perpetuate racist beliefs (Dennis, 1995; Haraway, 1997;
Wade, 2007). For instance, if the general assumption is that
Native Americans are prone to alcoholism due to their
genetic makeup, society may tend to believe that Native
Americans will become alcoholics. Not only do these claims
support racialized presumptions of the group but they also
discount other contributing factors such as environmental
and structural inequities that may influence disease rates
(Feagin, 2010).
These scientific practices have had a tremendous impact
on the way society views race. Over the last few centuries,
many scientists made a conscious decision to extend sig-
nificant efforts into attempting to prove genetic-based
racial differences rather than seeking to contribute useful
information about people of color to our scientific wealth
of knowledge. It is no wonder, then, that we know very little
about the mental health of people of color. These choices
have had daunting consequences on scientists, particularly
psychologists. American mental health researchers are cen-
turies behind where they should be regarding fundamental
knowledge of diverse populations. Specific mental health
studies of people of color are few. Despite several failed
attempts to establish substantial evidence, science and
genetics are positioned in a unique yet somewhat strained
relationship.
Science and Feminism
The historical relationship between common knowledge
and science is one of great importance, but so too are its
consequences. As previously mentioned, Western science
ideologies and common knowledge embody the voices of
White men. Objectivity, neutrality, and common knowledge
are virtually synonymous with White men's viewpoints.
Consequently, various professionals from scientific back-
grounds are inquiring about the underrepresentation of
women and people of color in the sciences. Accordingly,
feminists' analyses attempt to expose the struggles of the
underrepresented, particularly women, as well as to offer
more inclusive suggestions to the field. Along these lines,
feminists would agree that implicating multiple perspectives
into their practices would be a huge milestone, not only for
women but also for science (Lederman & Bartsch, 2001).
A critical component of feminism examines the power
structure between men and women. Although the introduction
of feminism brought about numerous positive changes for
women and people of color, the field has failed to recognize
the power differentials that exist among women. Oppression
comes in all different forms, ranging from environmental to
physical to psychological; therefore, it is important to realize
that in general, women's circumstances are complex, and
potential resolutions will need to be as well.
The study of feminism has repeatedly expressed the
concerns of White middle-class women without acknowl-
edging the different forms of feminism. Feminist analyses
articulated by women of color have generally been mar-
ginalized (Comas-Diaz, 1991). In turn, women of color
tend to detach from the discipline. As Comas-Diaz (1991)
stated,
Researchers and activists alike have noted the rela-
tively small numbers of women of color participating
in feminist events and organizations that are typically
included in historical accounts. Several interpretations
were offered to explain this low level of involvement.
One argued that ethnic women tend to resist feminism
because it is egalitarian and universalistic and moves
from an imperfect present to a more perfect future . . .
The interpretation ignored the germinal contributions
of feminist activists from a variety of cultural back-
grounds and seemed to confuse participation with
attitudes. Indeed, researchers suggest that some
women of color endorse less traditional sex-role ste-
reotyping than white women. (p. 599)
In no way does this article attempt to downplay the dis-
crimination and oppression experienced by White women,
Black men, or any other member of a minority group. Both
White women and Black women continue to be victims of
gender oppression in the 21st century. However, Black
women are often criticized for not fitting into traditional sex
roles; thus, Black women's intricate identities place them in
an exclusive social position: gender and race. Black wom-
en's body parts have been exaggerated, and they are often
looked at as hypersexual beings, which can instigate acts of
4 SAGE Open
sexual violence and disrespect toward Black women (Collins,
2004; Craig, 2006; Miller-Young, 2008).
West (1999) declared that the voices of Black women are
rarely heard, and when they are, their opinions are frequently
taken out of context. They are considered too emotional or
not objective enough (West, 1999). When it comes to the
issue of racism, Black women are likely to feel powerless.
They claim that encounters with racism are thought of as a
Black man's problem. West interviewed Black women in an
attempt to grasp how they perceive their position in this
country, and one of the respondents revealed,
Being a black woman is difficult in the United States, to
say the least . . .. There's the dictum, I would say, in the
black community, that men come first, that black come
first, that black men are the ones that are oppressed, and
the rest of us need to support them in surviving racism.
Like, we don't have to survive racism, and we are
somehow privileged in this country that we get all the
good jobs; we get to go to college and we have it just
fine here. And the poor black men are the ones that we
need to somehow reach out to and help, and I don't
know, sacrifice our lives for. That has always just struck
me as being ridiculous. Anytime at all when racism is
discussed in this country, it's discussed in terms of
black males. Everyone else is a kind of fodder for their
tribulations. That what I think it means to be a black
woman. It's just like this kind of loss of a sense of self.
You are just kind of cast away. (p. 42)
Unfortunately, the notion of feminism neglected to
account for the roles of racial, historical, cultural, and struc-
tural conditions that Black women face. Thus, Black femi-
nist thought emerged.
Black FeministThought
The struggles and concerns of Black women have been vital
to the construction of Black feminist thought. Black femi-
nism is centered around an African American critique on a
Eurocentric approach to knowledge. For example, accord-
ing to Collins (1989), "Like other subordinate groups,
Black women not only possess distinct interpretations of
Black women's oppression but have done so by using alter-
native ways of producing and validating knowledge"
(p. 20). Black feminist thought encourages Black women
to articulate their own standpoint and to value their own
subjective knowledge (Collins, 1989, 2000). Black women's
acts of resistance dispute two prominent approaches to
studying the consciousness of oppressed groups. The first
approach claims that subordinate groups identify with the
powerful and have no valid, independent interpretation of
their own oppression. The second approach suggests that
the oppressed are less human than their rulers and, therefore,
are less capable of articulating their own standpoint. An
underlying assumption of the two approaches is that the
subordinate group's perspective is inferior to that of the
dominant group and that the subordinate group lacks the
enthusiasm to pursue any kind of political activism.
The severity of the oppression that Black women have
encountered has forced them to reinvent themselves
(Collins, 2000; Shorter-Gooden, 2004). Facing multiple
forms of discrimination at once is a daily reality of the con-
temporary Black woman. Consequently, Black women
occupy a unique social position, which thereby results in a
distinct set of experiences for the group. Sands (2001) con-
ducted an interview with Dr. Evelyn Hammonds, a Black
feminist author, who discussed the connection between
femaleness and Blackness. She explained,
They are not separate. Because they are not separate in
me. I am always black and female. I can't say "well,
that was just a sexist remark" without wondering
would he have made the same sexist remark to a white
woman. So does that make it a racist, sexist remark?
You know, I don't know. And it takes a lot of energy
to be constantly trying to figure out which one it is.
(p. 248)
Therefore, unlike with their counterparts (Black men and
White women), with Black women, femaleness and black-
ness are interlocking identities. Over time, Black women
have discovered that they must play several different roles to
survive. Multiple role-playing is exhausting and extremely
stressful, and it has physical and psychological consequences
on the individual. Furthermore, success does not make an
individual immune to discrimination. Feagin and Sikes
(1995) interviewed a successful Black woman entrepreneur,
who revealed,
What is it like to be a black person in white America
today? One step from suicide! What I'm saying is--the
psychological warfare games that we have to play
everyday just to survive. We have to be one way in our
communities and one way in the workplace or in the
business sector. We can never be ourselves all around. I
think that may be a given for all people, but us particu-
larly; it's really a mental health problem. It's a wonder
we haven't all gone out and killed somebody or killed
ourselves. (p. 1)
What you begin to see here is that racism and oppression
have real consequences, as evidenced in the interviewee's
referral to intense bouts of oppression as "psychological
warfare" (Feagin & Sikes, 1995). The next question to ask,
then, is this: "How do these consequences that result from
racism and oppression, along with the lack of knowledge on
the subject, affect Black women's overall well-being?"

Mental Health Implications
The disconnect between the literature and Black women's
cultural practices decreases the effectiveness of mental
health therapy that Black women may desperately need to
buffer the many social stressors that they face in the United
States. Thus, Black women's perspectives on their experi-
ences are essential in developing a comprehensive treatment
approach. Because of the severity of Black women's oppres-
sion, they offer a unique perspective unfamiliar to any other
group, including Black men, White women, and all other
non-Black women (Thomas, 2004). However, in the 21st
century, pertinent information necessary to explain Black
women's culturally specific behavior is still essentially miss-
ing from the field.
In response to misrepresentations of women and people of
color in behavioral sciences, feminist psychology emerged in
the early 1970s. Women rejected mainstream psychology
theories as harmful and declared that many of the medical
facts simply did not apply. Subtle representations of racist
and classist assumptions go largely unnoticed by White femi-
nist psychologists. In this manner, women of color call on
scholarly communities to broaden the contexts of feminist
psychology. As a result, a remaining challenge is to ensure
that the epistemological advances gained in the field move
beyond the White, Western, middle-class experience (Gergen
& Gergen, 2010; Greene, 1986). In addition, feminist
psychologists have developed theories to ensure that one's
social context is included as a psychological variable (Russo,
2010; Unger, 1990).
Perspectives from women, women of color, and lesbians
are oftentimes absent from mainstream psychology. Thus,
feminist psychologists have put forth a vast amount of effort to
diversify the perspectives within the field. However, despite
these attempts, the literature fails to reflect the experiences of
all women. Many psychologists assume that gender is not a
significant component to treating emotions. Yet, Western sci-
ence has played an intricate role in constructing polar opposite
gendered perceptions of emotion and reason. These percep-
tions have supported notions of the stereotyped "emotional
women" and the "rational man" (Lloyd, 1984; Russo, 2010).
Fischer and Manstead suggest that to truly analyze relation-
ships between gender and emotions, one must consider
the importance that the "Western dichotomy" has played in
constructing feminine (emotional) and masculine (rational)
meanings (Fischer & Manstead, 2000). Yet, emotional issues
are the reality of men and women alike. Despite resistance, it
is critical to continue to confront the biases that dominate
mainstream psychology. Related research and scholarship
continue to make huge strides for women in the field (Stewart
& Dottolo, 2006).
Feminist psychologists present five principles that are
particularly applicable to women from diverse backgrounds
(Brown, 1988; Mays & Comas-Diaz, 1988). The first prin-
ciple focuses on examining the relevance of the woman's
context. Although feminist psychology does acknowledge
sociocultural components of women's lives, women of color
claim that the approach fails to consider the influence of
ethno/sociocultural variables. The second principle involves
instilling in women that differences are not deficiencies.
Theories in human behavior and psychological applications
have too often neglected to take into account the cultural
context in which group members exist (Brown, 1988). It is
important that the premise of "difference" does not equate to
the pathological assumptions of "the other."
The third principle is the equalization of power. Feminist
psychology calls for the equal distribution of power between
social positions. This principle is particularly important for
women of color because they occupy positions of gender and
racial subordination (Cammaert & Larson, 1988; Walker,
2005). The fourth principle focuses on matters of empower-
ment. Feminist psychologists' goals of empowerment are
essential to those who are at a disadvantage. Helping a woman
understand that her grim circumstances are to some degree
attributed to oppression provides her with a sense of empow-
erment (Mays & Comas-Diaz, 1988; Russo, 2010). She
begins to see herself as a victim of society rather than a per-
sonal failure, and this perspective can lighten her stress load
almost instantaneously.
The final principle is one of social action. Feminist psy-
chology asserts that women's problems are based on a soci-
etal and personal context. However, women of color differ
from their counterparts in the aspect that their realities are
based on environmental, historical, societal, and personal
contexts. The basic premise of this principle is to encour-
age women from all backgrounds, to use their oppressive
realities to draw together as an apparatus for social change
in our paternalistic, racist, classist, and sexist society.
Therefore, feminist psychologists suggest that addressing
social issues through social action can act as a means of
coping, thus giving women of color more control over their
circumstances (Comas-Diaz, 1991).
As indicated earlier, Black women experience unique
stressors due to racism and sexism in the United States.
However, again, there is a lack of empirically and theoretically
based knowledge concerning this phenomenon. The vast
majority of the clinical research that has been done has studied
Black women from a pathological perspective (Washington,
2006). The negative mental health effects caused by issues
such as substance abuse, dysfunctional family circumstances,
and single parenthood issues are typically the topic areas of
study (Belle & Doucet, 2003; Fernquist, 2004; Klein, Elifson,
& Sterk, 2006). However, an examination of Black women
dealing with their oppressive realities along with the mental
health consequences deserves much more attention (Jones,
2004).
Researchers argue that psychiatrists often overlook the
psychological impact of racism in the lives of ethnic minori-
ties. They argue that the field of psychiatry reflects dominant
social values that can be oppressive toward nondominant
6 SAGE Open
populations (Bhugra & Ayonrinde, 2001). Bhugra and
Ayonrinde (2001) declared that there are direct correlations
among racism, racial life events, and mental health. However,
ethnic minorities are less likely to report racial incidents of
crime, often due to feelings of shame, inadequacy, hopeless-
ness, or mistrust. Finally, the authors call for therapists to
self-assess their present biases toward nondominant group
members. To provide the type of treatment necessary for
these groups, therapists must acknowledge their role in
alienating these clients.
In addition, Bhugra and Ayonrinde (2001) claimed that
oftentimes, minority groups experience stress due to their
minority status in society. On an institutional level, occurrences
such as stereotyping, rejection, prejudice, and devaluing non-
White culture are common; similarly, on an individual level,
stereotyping, rejection, prejudice, devaluation of non-White
culture, threats, and attacks can influence an individual's per-
ception of life events, thereby leading to additional stress.
Black women deal or cope with stress in different ways
compared with their counterparts. Dr. Angela Neal-Barnett
(2003) reported that White women are more likely to seek
support from others, such as friends and children, whereas
Black women are inclined to immerse themselves in a stress-
ful situation in an attempt to mend the situation. What is also
striking about Dr. Barnett's findings is that the majority of
the Black women in her study were either unaware that they
were stressed or were not willing to admit it (Neal-Barrett,
2003).
Implications for Future Study
Missing blocks of fundamental knowledge in psychology
concerning Black women coupled with the fact that racism
and sexism are causing mental health problems paint a
disturbing picture for Black women of the future. Social
scientists and their allies have warned of the problems at
hand (Satcher, 1999), and many practitioners have began
offering recommendations for how to treat Black women's
multifaceted dilemma (Martin & Martin, 2002; Poussaint,
2001; Williams, 2008; Wilson, 2001). The issue becomes
even more complicated when we examine the strained
relationship between erroneous scientific claims about
nondominant racial and gendered groups. With the face of
our nation changing, it is essential that we seek to promote
scientific knowledge outside that of the dominant paradigm.
Recommendations for future study include examining the
long-term consequences that racism/sexism have on Black
women's mental health. Black women are being forced to
find informal ways to cope with their oppression because the
mental health field is incapable of handling these issues. But
how effective are the coping strategies that Black women are
using to deal with these issues? Studies are showing that sta-
tistics in relation to Black women's depression rates are
either absent or unclear (Barbee, 1992; Carrington, 2006;
Kaba, 2008).
Existing knowledge gaps prove troubling to the mental
health of Black women in the United States. Black women's
mental health rates remain uncertain because scientific stud-
ies concerning women and non-Whites historically focused
much of its attention on validating claims of biological differ-
ences and thus inferiority. Consequently, rather than setting
out to prove biological differences, Western scientists must
now make a conscious effort to accurately speak to the expe-
riences of the groups that have historically been neglected.
In addition, the recent gains associated with the estab-
lishment of feminist psychology fall short in adequately
addressing concerns of inclusivity in psychology literature.
Scholars must evade attempts to explain Black women's
experiences by way of mainstream psychological knowl-
edge. I liken this phenomenon to the notion of attempting to
fit a "square peg into a round hole." Black women's strug-
gles are simply too unique for this approach.
The only adequate solution for widening our knowledge
base of the Black woman's experience as it relates to men-
tal health is to allow Black women themselves to contribute
the "taken for granted" knowledge often excluded from the
literature. I argue that one very reasonable approach to con-
sider in moving forward is to fuse feminist psychology and
Black feminist literatures. Incorporating an effective way
for psychologists and therapists to handle the ill effects of
racism and sexism into their practices is also necessary.
Regardless of the dominant discourse, race and gender
issues are very real, and the failure of mainstream scholars
and clinicians to position themselves to recognize and
appropriately treat the victims will have detrimental effects
on the society as a whole.
