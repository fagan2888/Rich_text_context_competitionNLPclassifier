ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION
Association Between Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D
Level and Upper Respiratory Tract Infection
in the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey
Adit A. Ginde, MD, MPH; Jonathan M. Mansbach, MD; Carlos A. Camargo Jr, MD, DrPH
Background: Recent studies suggest a role for vitamin
D in innate immunity, including the prevention of res-
piratory tract infections (RTIs). We hypothesize that se-
rum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels are in-
versely associated with self-reported recent upper RTI
(URTI).
Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey, a probability survey of the US population con-
ducted between 1988 and 1994. We examined the asso-
ciation between 25(OH)D level and recent URTI in 18 883
participants 12 years and older. The analysis adjusted for
demographics and clinical factors (season, body mass in-
dex, smoking history, asthma, and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease).
Results: The median serum 25(OH)D level was 29 ng/mL
(to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 2.496)
(interquartile range, 21-37 ng/mL), and 19% (95% con-
fidence interval [CI], 18%-20%) of participants re-
ported a recent URTI. Recent URTI was reported by 24%
of participants with 25(OH)D levels less than 10 ng/mL,
by 20% with levels of 10 to less than 30 ng/mL, and by
17% with levels of 30 ng/mL or more (P.001). Even
after adjusting for demographic and clinical character-
istics, lower 25(OH)D levels were independently asso-
ciated with recent URTI (compared with 25[OH]D
levels of 30 ng/mL: odds ratio [OR], 1.36; 95% CI, 1.01-
1.84 for 10 ng/mL and 1.24; 1.07-1.43 for 10 to 30
ng/mL). The association between 25(OH)D level and
URTI seemed to be stronger in individuals with asthma
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 5.67 and
2.26, respectively).
Conclusions: Serum 25(OH)D levels are inversely as-
sociated with recent URTI. This association may be stron-
ger in those with respiratory tract diseases. Randomized
controlled trials are warranted to explore the effects of
vitamin D supplementation on RTI.

UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT
infection (URTI), or the
"common cold," is the
most widespread infec-
tious disease and the
most common reason for US emergency
department visits and unscheduled out-
patient visits.1 More than 200 viruses con-
tribute to the clinical syndrome of cough,
nasal congestion, nasal discharge, sore
throat, and sneezing.2,3 Most adults in the
United States experience 2 to 4 URTIs per
year, and most children experience 6 to
10 per year, which carries enormous popu-
lation morbidity due to the high inci-
dence of disease and disruption caused by
symptoms.4,5
Because options for curing or prevent-
ing URTIs are limited, treatment relies on
symptom relief.6,7 For example, over-the-
counter preparations may have modest
benefit on symptom duration and sever-
ity.8 For many decades, vitamin C (ascor-
bic acid) has been marketed and used for
the prevention and treatment of URTIs de-
spite the lack of convincing evidence of
benefit in community populations.9 How-
ever, prevention of colds/influenza and
"immune boosting" remain among the top
reasons that Americans take vitamin and
herbal supplements.10
Althoughergocalciferol(vitaminD2
)and
cholecalciferol (vitamin D3
) are less com-
monly used vitamin supplements,10 the im-
portanceofvitaminDforgeneralhealthhas
expanded far beyond rickets.11 Indeed, vi-
tamin D is involved in the regulation of

tween November and March, there are insufficient UV-B
raystoproducevitaminD.Cannelletal13 assertedthatwin-
tertime vitamin D insufficiency may explain seasonal varia-
tion in influenza; this argument may also apply to other
RTIs.
The potential mechanism for this observation is sug-
gested by recent evidence that vitamin D plays an impor-
tant role in innate immunity, particularly through the an-
timicrobial peptide cathelicidin.14 Indeed, early
epidemiologic studies15-22 found a strong association be-
tween rickets and RTI. Although serum 25-hydroxyvita-
min D (25[OH]D) levels of at least 10 ng/mL (to convert
to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 2.496) prevent rick-
ets, levels of at least 30 ng/mL are advantageous for
general health, with approximately 40 ng/mL considered
optimal.23,24 Recent prospective cohort25 and case-
control26,27 studies have demonstrated a consistent asso-
ciation between low (including nonrachitic) serum 25
(OH)DlevelsandRTIs.Thesepreliminarystudies,although
promising, were based on small, nondiverse cohorts of pa-
tients; the association between 25(OH)D level and RTI has
not been explored on a population level.
In the present study, we examine the association be-
tween serum 25(OH)D level and recent URTI in a large
cross-sectional sample that represents the entire US popu-
lation. The primary hypothesis is that serum 25(OH)D
level is inversely associated with recent URTI.
METHODS
STUDY DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS
Between October 18, 1988, and October 15, 1994, the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics conducted the Third Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III).
We performed a secondary analysis of this nationally repre-
sentative, cross-sectional sample of the noninstitutionalized US
civilian population. We received a waiver from the Partners Hu-
man Research Committee and the Colorado Multiple Institu-
tional Review Board as an exempt study.
Full details of the survey methods, including sampling, in-
terview, examination, laboratory measurements, ethics ap-
proval, and informed consent, are described elsewhere.28 Briefly,
the survey used a complex, stratified, multistage probability
sample design. The NHANES III oversampled certain sub-
groups of people, including low-income persons, adolescents
aged 12 to 17 years, adults 60 years and older, blacks, and Mexi-
can Americans.
Individuals selected for participation were notified by let-
ter approximately 10 days before the home visit for the inter-
view. The NHANES III collected household interview data, in-
cluding demographic characteristics and data on health and
nutrition, for 22 266 of 27 145 invited participants (82.0%) 12
years and older. Most of these participants (19 784 [88.9%])
subsequently underwent physical and laboratory examina-
tions in a mobile examination center or at a home visit. We lim-
ited this analysis to the 18 883 participants with reported se-
rum 25(OH)D values, representing 195 million Americans.
Because physical and laboratory examinations occurred in mo-
bile examination centers, inclement weather was an issue dur-
ing data collection. To avoid these issues and improve re-
sponse, the NHANES III preferentially scheduled data collection
in the lower latitudes (further south) during the winter and in
the higher latitudes (further north) in the summer.29
DATA COLLECTION
From the household interview data, we analyzed information on
self-reported age, sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic sta-
tus, as measured by the poverty to income ratio (the ratio of a
family's income to the poverty threshold of a family of the same
size). We recorded smoking history (current smoking and pack-
years), current asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease (COPD) diagnosis from self-reported history. We defined
COPDbasedonresponsestoquestionsonemphysemaorchronic
bronchitis. From the examination data, we calculated body mass
index as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.
Blood samples collected during the examination were cen-
trifuged, aliquoted, and frozen to ­70°C on-site. They were then
shipped on dry ice to central laboratories, where they were stored
at ­70°C until analysis. Serum 25(OH)D levels were measured
using a radioimmunoassay kit after extraction with acetoni-
trile (DiaSorin, Stillwater, Minnesota) by the National Center
for Environmental Health (Atlanta, Georgia). We used the date
of the physical examination and laboratory data collection to
most accurately adjust for the effect of season on serum 25
(OH)D levels.
The primary outcome (recent URTI) was based on the re-
sponse to the following question: "In the past few days, have
you had a cough, cold, or other acute illness?" This question,
asked during the physical and laboratory examination visit be-
fore spirometric testing, was designed to identify participants
with recent URTIs, which could affect spirometry results. Se-
lection of this outcome variable allowed for temporal proxim-
ity between 25(OH)D level and recent URTI because serum
samples were also obtained during the physical and labora-
tory examination visit.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We performed statistical analyses using Stata 9.0 (StataCorp LP,
College Station, Texas). Using survey commands, we applied the
recommended subsample weights for the interview plus exami-
nation data to account for unequal probabilities of selection and
to accurately represent estimates for the US population. All of
the results are presented as weighted values. We calculated vari-
ance based on NHANES-provided masked variance units using
the Taylor series linearization method. All of the P values are
2-tailed, with P.05 considered statistically significant.

cent URTI (ie, serum 25[OH]D level, season, body mass index,
region, current cigarette smoking, smoking history in pack-
years, and asthma and COPD diagnoses), overall and in the sub-
set with recent URTI. We categorized serum 25(OH)D levels as
less than 10 ng/mL (25 nmol), 10 to less than 30 ng/mL (25-
74.9 nmol/L), and 30 ng/mL or more (75 nmol/L).11,23 To im-
prove interpretability of the analysis, we converted age, poverty
to income ratio, body mass index, and smoking pack-year his-
tory from continuous to categorical variables. In addition, we di-

tors and the outcome of recent URTI using the Pearson 2 test
for categorical variables and simple ordinal logistic regression
for ordinal variables.
To evaluate the independent association between serum 25
(OH)D level and recent URTI, we created multivariable mod-
els by progressively adding covariates that might confound or
alter the 25(OH)D-URTI association. Factors known to be as-
sociated with serum 25(OH)D levels30 but not directly related
to URTI, such as milk intake, vitamin D supplementation, and

sunlight exposure, were not included in the models owing to
collinearity. Because season may affect serum 25(OH)D levels
and recent URTI, we evaluated this important variable sepa-
rately and with other covariates. We reported odds ratios (ORs)
with 95% CIs for variables in the model. In addition, we evalu-
ated interaction terms for asthma and COPD, conditions that
we hypothesized might have clinically important effect modi-
fication on the 25(OH)D-URTI association.
RESULTS
Characteristics of the weighted NHANES III sample, strati-
fied by recent URTI status, are given in Table 1. The
participants had a median age of 38 years; 52% were fe-
male and 75% were white. Overall, the median serum 25
(OH)D level was 29 ng/mL (interquartile range, 21-37

present in 2% (95% CI, 2%-2%) of the population and
of 10 to less than 30 ng/mL in 53% (95% CI, 51%-55%).
The proportion of participants who reported recent URTI
was 19% (95% CI, 18%-20%).
The proportions of participants with recent URTI,
stratified by characteristics, are also given in Table 1. The
median serum 25(OH)D level was slightly lower in par-
ticipants reporting URTI (28 ng/mL) compared with those
without URTI (29 ng/mL) (P.001). Other character-
istics associated with recent URTI included winter and
fall seasons, age 12 to 19 years compared with age 20 years
and older, female sex, low socioeconomic status (pov-
erty to income ratio, 1), South region, current ciga-
rette smoking, more than 0 cigarette pack-years, asthma,
and COPD (P.05 for all).
Compared with individuals with serum 25(OH)D lev-
els of 30 ng/mL or more, those with levels less than 10
ng/mLor10tolessthan30ng/mLhad55%and27%higher
odds of recent URTI, respectively (Table 2, model 1). In
further stratification of the group with 25(OH)D levels of
30 ng/mL or more, those with levels of 30 to less than 40
ng/mL had similar odds of recent URTI compared with
those with levels of 40 ng/mL or more (OR, 0.99; 95% CI,
0.81-1.21). After adjusting for season, lower serum 25
(OH)Dlevelswerestillassociatedwithasignificantlyhigher
URTI (Table 2, model 2). Indeed, the 25(OH)D-URTI as-
sociation was consistent across all seasons (Figure).
Changing the months included for each season did not ma-
terially alter the results (data not shown). When all the
covariates were added to the model, serum 25(OH)D level
retained its significant inverse relationship with URTI
(Table 2, model 3). Winter season, younger age, current
cigarette smoking, asthma, and COPD also were associ-
ated with significantly higher odds of URTI.
Compared with participants without asthma, a similar
proportion of participants with asthma had serum 25

Participants with vs without COPD were more likely to
have serum 25(OH)D levels less than 10 ng/mL (3% vs
2%, P=.04), but this association was not significant after
adjusting for demographics, season, and smoking status
(P=.12). Among asthmatic participants, those with 25
(OH)D levels less than 10 ng/mL had a higher reported
rate of recent URTI than did those with levels of 30 ng/mL
or more (59% vs 22%, P.001). A similar association ob-
served in COPD participants was also observed by 25
(OH)D strata (45% vs 31%, respectively), although the as-
sociation was not statistically significant (P=.20).
While controlling for all other covariates, serum 25
(OH)D levels less than 10 ng/mL were associated with
5.67 higher odds of recent URTI in participants with
asthma compared with levels of 30 ng/mL or more and
2.26 higher odds in participants with COPD. In com-
parison, serum 25(OH)D levels less than 10 ng/mL were
associated with only 1.24 higher odds of URTI in par-
ticipants without asthma and 1.27 higher odds in those
without COPD. When individually adding interaction
terms to the final multivariable model, the interaction term
for COPD was not significant (P for interaction=.30) but
was significant for asthma (P for interaction=.007).
COMMENT
To our knowledge, this is the first population-based study
to evaluate and demonstrate an association between se-
rum 25(OH)D level and URTI. The association seems to
be robust, with a clinically and statistically significant as-
sociation present in all seasons and when controlling for
potential confounders. The dose-response association be-
tween lower levels of vitamin D and recent URTI pro-
vides further credibility to the findings.
Although early clinical studies14-22 supported an asso-
ciation between rickets found with serum 25(OH)D lev-
els less than 10 ng/mL and RTI, more recent studies25-27
have found an effect of low (including nonrachitic) se-
rum 25(OH)D levels. For example, Laaksi et al25 found that
young male Finnish soldiers with serum 25(OH)D levels
of less than 16 ng/mL at baseline had a 63% increased risk
of absence from duty due to RTI than did soldiers with
serum 25(OH)D levels 16 ng/mL or more during the fol-
lowing 6 months. In addition, case-control studies from
India26 and Turkey27 reported an association between se-
rum 25(OH)D levels of less than 20 ng/mL and acute lower
RTI in children and neonates, respectively.
In this study, we also found that individuals with res-
piratory tract diseases (ie, asthma and COPD) are of par-
ticular interest. Effect modification by asthma, and pos-
sibly COPD, on the association between serum 25(OH)D
level and recent URTI indicates that the role of vitamin D
may be of greater importance for individuals with these
common conditions. Potential explanations may be that
those with respiratory tract diseases are more susceptible
to RTI31,32 and have increased frequency of lower respira-
tory tract symptoms of higher severity and longer dura-
tion.33,34 These findings are particularly important given
the high morbidity from asthma and COPD exacerbation
and merit further investigation.
Preliminary studies on vitamin D supplementation and
RTI also have been promising. Two interventional co-
hort studies with 600 to 700 IU daily of vitamin D from
cod liver oil and multivitamin supplementation35 and
60 000 IU weekly from a vitamin D or calcium supple-
ment36 found a decrease in RTIs in children receiving
supplementation. One randomized controlled trial37 of
bone loss in postmenopausal black women found that
7.7% of women randomized to receive 800 to 2000 IU
of vitamin D daily reported respiratory tract symptoms
during 3-year follow-up compared with 25.0% in the con-
trol group. Another substudy38 of a randomized con-
trolled trial for fracture prevention found a nonsignifi-
cant 10% reduced odds of wintertime infection in
participants randomized to receive 800 IU of vitamin D
daily (P=.23). However, these studies were post hoc analy-
ses of adverse events reported in studies of skeletal health,
and dedicated trials are warranted.
The emerging role of vitamin D in innate immunity pro-
vides a plausible mechanism for the inverse association be-
tween serum 25(OH)D level and URTI.14 The only known
human cathelicidin, hCAP-18 (LL-37), enhances micro-
bial killing in phagocytic vacuoles, acts as a chemoat-
tractant for neutrophils and monocytes, and has a de-
fined vitamin D­dependent mechanism.39,40 Pathogenic
antigens interact with toll-like receptors on macrophages
to upregulate the expression of genes that code for the vi-
tamin D receptor and for the 1-hydroxylase enzyme that
converts 25(OH)D to the biologically active 1,25-
dihydroxyvitamin D.41,42 In turn, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin
D interacts with the promoter of the gene for cathelici-
din,43 which enhances the production of hCAP-18.44,45
The presence of sufficient levels of 25(OH)D, the ma-
jor circulating form of vitamin D, is necessary to acti-
vate hCAP-18 expression and to enhance macrophage
function and innate immunity.45 In studies of Mycobac-
terium tuberculosis, Liu et al42 found a direct association
of serum 25(OH)D levels with cathelicidin expression and
killing of intracellular M tuberculosis. Furthermore, black
individuals, known to have increased susceptibility to tu-
berculosis infection, had low serum 25(OH)D levels and
inefficient cathelicidin messenger RNA induction, but
supplementation of 25(OH)D to the reference range re-
stored induction of cathelicidin messenger RNA.42
The results from our article provide additional evi-
dence from a large, diverse population of the inverse as-
sociation between serum 25(OH)D level and RTI. Al-
though serum 25(OH)D levels of less than 10 ng/mL were
associated with the highest rate of recent URTI, serum
25(OH)D levels of 10 to less than 30 ng/mL also were
associated with higher adjusted odds of URTI compared
with levels of 30 ng/mL or more. Although individuals
with serum 25(OH)D levels of less than 10 ng/mL have
the least efficient cathelicidin expression, serum 25
(OH)D levels of 30 ng/mL or more may be necessary for
the optimal induction of cathelicidin messenger RNA.42
Although comparison of groups with 25(OH)D levels of
30 to less than 40 ng/mL and 40 ng/mL or more sug-
gested a possible plateau of effect after approximately 30
ng/mL, this analysis was underpowered to evaluate
whether higher 25(OH)D levels (ie, 40 ng/mL) provide
additional benefit.

Current recommendations for vitamin D supplemen-
tation (200-600 IU/d) are unlikely to achieve optimal se-
rum 25(OH)D levels (ie, approximately 30-40 ng/mL)
in most of the US population.46 Randomized controlled
trials of higher-dose vitamin D supplementation (1000
IU/d), particularly in the winter season, at higher lati-
tudes, and for individuals with respiratory tract dis-
eases, will help clarify the role of vitamin D supplemen-
tation in the reduction of RTI.
This study has some potential limitations. We could
not control for all potential confounders, but we se-
lected covariates most likely to be associated with se-
rum 25(OH)D level and recent URTI. Unmeasured con-
founders may have an effect on the association between
25(OH)D level and URTI. Thus, causal inference is not
possible, and we cannot exclude that the results are merely
an epiphenomenon; randomized controlled trials are valu-
able for determining the causal nature of an observed as-
sociation. Reverse causation (ie, lower serum 25[OH]D
levels due to recent URTI and, thus, decreased outdoor
activity) seems unlikely because the half-life of serum 25
(OH)D is 2 to 3 weeks11 and URTIs last only 3 to 4 days,3
but it may affect the enhanced vitamin D­URTI associa-
tion in participants with asthma and COPD owing to
longer symptom duration in those individuals.
Theprimaryoutcome(recentURTI)isarelativelycrude
and self-reported measure that may include other non-
RTIs; however, limitations on the accuracy of this out-
come would be expected to reduce the magnitude of as-
sociations. Serum samples were collected at only 1 point
in time and were preferentially collected in northern states
in the summer and in southern states in the winter. As a
result, serum 25(OH)D levels are likely higher than would
be expected by random sampling across all seasons. Al-
though the overall serum 25(OH)D level and the recent
URTI rate may be affected, it is unlikely that their asso-
ciation would be materially different. Nevertheless, we en-
courage efforts to replicate these findings in independent
samples.
In conclusion, serum 25(OH)D levels have an inde-
pendent, inverse association with recent URTI. Although
25(OH)D levels less than 30 ng/mL and URTI were higher
in the winter season, the inverse association was present
throughout the year. Individuals with respiratory tract dis-
eases, such as asthma, who have low serum 25(OH)D lev-
elsmaybeevenmoresusceptibletoRTI.VitaminDsupple-
mentation may reduce the incidence of URTI and
exacerbations of respiratory tract diseases. Randomized
controlled trials are warranted to explore the direct effect
of vitamin D supplementation and to establish optimal lev-
els of serum 25(OH)D in the prevention of RTI.
