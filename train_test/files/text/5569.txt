Since the foundational article by McKinlay and Little
(1977), the literature on foreign aid allocation has been
dominated by studies juxtaposing "recipient need" and
"donor interest" explanations (see, among others, Alesina
and Dollar, 2000; Berthélemy, 2006). These studies include
a set of aid-receiving-country variables purporting to proxy
for either recipient need (e.g. gross domestic product (GDP)
per capita, population, infant mortality rate) or donor self-
interest (e.g. donor exports, military assistance, status as a
former colony) in time-series cross-sectional regression
models; the results are interpreted as indicating the domi-
nance of either altruistic or selfish motivations on the part
of donors.
While broad correlations between recipient-country
characteristics and aid flows provide some insight into
donor decision-making, this literature rarely describes the
specific mechanisms by which variation in recipient coun-
try indicators translates into over-time variation in aid
flows. A recent wave of aid allocation studies has turned to
understanding how aid flows respond to specific geopoliti-
cal events. A number of these studies have focused on how
the rotation of aid-receiving countries into the 10 non-per-
manent United Nations Security Council (UNSC) seats
results in increased aid flows (Dreher et al., 2009a, 2009b;
Kuziemko and Werker, 2006; Vreeland and Dreher, 2014).
Kuziemko and Werker (2006) find that US aid flows
increase by 59% to countries rotating onto the Security
Council. Vreeland and Dreher (2014) find that temporary
UNSC members receive nearly twice as much aid as non-
members from the five major bilateral donors; are more
likely to participate in IMF programs with lower levels of
policy conditionality; and are more likely to receive multi-
lateral development bank projects. In sum, there is evidence
that international development actors change their behavior
toward countries that rotate into UNSC membership.
Foreign aid funnel? A placebo-based
assessment of aid flows to
non-permanent United Nations
Security Council members
Evangeline M. Reynolds and Matthew S. Winters
Abstract
A number of recent studies have found that temporary members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC)
experience increased foreign aid inflows. We use a constrained permutations approach to replicate analyses found in
Vreeland and Dreher (2014). Permuting the timing of country membership on the Security Council, we create placebo
UNSC membership histories which plausibly could have been observed. We use these placebos to construct a reference
distribution for the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between UNSC membership and foreign aid flows and
then observe whether or not the observed test statistic for the correlation found in the real-world data is in the tails of
this distribution. In other contexts, such empirically based hypothesis tests have revealed a high false-positive rate for
traditional, model-based time-series cross-sectional inference. Given the controversial nature of studies about increased
aid flows as secondary benefits of UNSC membership, it is valuable to subject such analyses to additional scrutiny. Our
reanalysis largely validates existing findings.

These studies argue that the institution of non-perma-
nent member rotation provides leverage for causal identifi-
cation. As Vreeland and Dreher (2014: 27) describe, "the
idiosyncratic selection process [of non-permanent UNSC
members] and the exogenously enforced term limits allow
us to make controlled comparisons of (1) individual coun-
tries on and off the UNSC over time and (2) different coun-
tries on and off the UNSC during the same period of time."
Although countries are not randomly assigned to serve on
the Security Council, the selection process is understood to
such an extent and limited in such ways as to make state-
ments about counterfactuals convincing.
Existing studies have relied on multivariate regression
methods for time-series cross-sectional data in order to
estimate the effect of UNSC membership. Characterizing
uncertainty in the findings therefore has depended on
assumptions about and adjustments to the standard errors
estimated in those regressions. The baseline assumption
of errors estimated by ordinary least squares regression is
that the observations are independently and identically
distributed. Clustering in the data means that the number
of informative observations in the data is less than the
raw N would suggest; unadjusted standard errors might
be overoptimistic (Angrist and Pischke, 2009; Erikson
et al., 2014). One solution--employed by existing studies
of the UNSC­foreign aid link--is to calculate standard
errors to account for clustering. In this paper, we test the
robustness of this correction using constrained randomi-
zation tests.
Standard regression methods estimate a test statistic
based on the ratio of an estimated coefficient to an esti-
mated standard error. When the coefficient is sufficiently
larger than the standard error, the test statistic appears in the
tails of a theoretical probability distribution, and the analyst
rejects the null hypothesis that the coefficient is equal to
zero, deeming the estimate "statistically significant."
Placebo-based randomization tests create a reference distri-
bution from the data itself, rather than relying on assump-
tions about the shape of disturbances in the data (Erikson
et al., 2014). In our constrained randomization test, we cre-
ate a reference distribution of test statistics based on 1000
plausible but invented Security Council. For each of these
placebos, we estimate the relationship between member-
ship and foreign aid flows using the replication dataset and
modeling strategy from Vreeland and Dreher (2014). We
then determine whether the test statistic produced by the
original data is truly outlying within the distribution of sta-
tistics estimated using the placebos. The placebo-based
method is less susceptible to false positives than traditional
distribution-based tests because the placebo data should
contain the real-world clustering and time dependence that
might lead to deflated standard errors in traditional tests.
Our constrained randomization tests largely replicate the
estimates of uncertainty from Vreeland and Dreher (2014).
Using a non-parametric test of statistical significance, we
demonstrate the robustness of their claims, providing addi-
tional evidence that there exists a meaningful correlation
between temporary UNSC membership and increased for-
eign aid flows.
The logic linking foreign aid to UNSC
membership
The idea that foreign aid is a tool of statecraft is well estab-
lished. As Morgenthau said, "Much of what goes by the
name of foreign aid today is in the nature of bribes ... a
price paid for political services rendered or to be rendered"
(Morgenthau, 1962: 302). Bueno de Mesquita and Smith
(2007, 2009) similarly describe foreign aid flows as quid
pro quo transfers. Given the temporary elevation in geopo-
litical prominence of states elected to the Security Council,
such states might be the target of additional aid. With regard
to services being rendered by these temporary UNSC mem-
bers in exchange for aid, Vreeland and Dreher (2014) pro-
pose that the most powerful countries in the world want to
gain increased legitimacy for the actions that they take by
winning UNSC votes by large margins.
While Vreeland and Dreher (2014) offer several exam-
ples of explicit quid pro quo exchanges (e.g. the United
States cutting foreign aid to Yemen in 1990 after it voted
against UNSC Resolution 678 to authorize the use of force
against Iraq), they suggest that increases in foreign aid to
non-permanent UNSC members result from a "complex
web" of connections among ambassadors and government
agencies. Because of a high-level desire to court the favor
of temporary UNSC members, foreign aid to these coun-
tries is more likely to be discussed within national aid agen-
cies and multilateral institutions.The quid pro quo exchange
may be more implicit than explicit.
Beyond the theoretical arguments for why UNSC mem-
bership might lead to increased foreign aid flows, this
explanatory variable has characteristics that are desirable
from the standpoint of causal inference. Rotation on and off
the Security Council allows us to make predictions about
precise windows during which treatment effects should be
observed. While service on the Security Council is not ran-
dom, the timing of service on the Security Council is
demonstrably orthogonal to other determinants of aid
flows, such as a state's level of economic development or
the amounts of aid that it has received in previous time peri-
ods (Bueno de Mesquita and Smith, 2010; Vreeland and
Dreher, 2014). In fact, the most important determinant of
service seems to be the amount of time since a country last
served on the Council (i.e. there exists a norm of turn-tak-
ing, particularly among African countries; Vreeland and
Dreher, 2014). Vreeland and Dreher (2014: 135) therefore
describe temporary UNSC membership as something that
can be considered "a chance event."

Existing methods
Although Vreeland and Dreher (2014) assert the exogeneity
of UNSC membership, their main analyses rely on multivari-
ate linear regression models controlling for background char-
acteristics that plausibly affect both election to the Security
Council and foreign aid flows. Specifically, they control for
whether a country--in a given year--is a pariah state or at
war, and also for the country's GDP per capita, regime type,
and level of incoming military assistance from the United
States. To control for other time-invariant country character-
istics, they include country fixed effects. They also include
year fixed effects and a region-specific quartic time trend. A
similar strategy is employed in Kuziemko and Werker (2006)
and Dreher et al. (2009a, 2009b). In a study of the effects
of UNSC membership on economic growth, democracy,
and press freedom, Bueno de Mesquita and Smith (2010)
use a nearest-neighbor matching analysis to identify the set
of counterfactual non-UNSC-member cases that are most
similar to temporary members in a given year in terms of
population, GDP per capita, and level of democracy.
The constrained permutation method
Building on Reynolds (2010, 2014), we use a constrained per-
mutation method to construct a randomization test. We com-
pare the test statistic for the observed correlation between
UNSC membership and foreign aid flows to a distribution of
teststatisticsfromcorrelationsestimatedusingplaceboSecurity
Council. This process yields an empirically derived p-value
that we compare to those in Vreeland and Dreher (2014).
Thinking about alternative UNSC membership profiles
that realistically might have been observed, we know that
exactly 10 countries will be on the Security Council each
year, and these countries obviously must be members of the
United Nations.1 We know that these countries will come
from five different regional groups.2 And we know that
treatment for each country will start and stop at a particular
moment in time and that, given the rule against reelection,
no country will receive consecutive treatments. Finally, we
recognize that some countries appear on the Security
Council with greater frequency than others.
Thus, our constrained permutation approach creates pla-
cebo Security Councils based on (a) membership rules and
(b) the observed frequency of UNSC participation. We
assign countries to terms on our counterfactual Security
Councils based on the number of times that they have his-
torically served on the Security Council (since 1946), while
respecting the regional distribution and the prohibition on
back-to-back terms. Brazil, for instance, has served on the
Security Council 10 times. Therefore, in each of our pla-
cebo UNSC histories, Brazil appears on the Security
Council 10 times. For each permutation, however, the spe-
cific terms for which Brazil has tenure on the Council have
been independently assigned.3
We also constrain our placebos to account for two tem-
poral variations in the operation of elections to the
Security Council. First, regional groupings changed in
1966. Our permutations, therefore, create hypothetical
Security Councils for the period 1946­1965 that draw on
the five regional groupings that existed over that time
period and hypothetical Security Councils for the period
1966­2014 that draw on the revised groupings. Second,
there have been 15 instances in which countries have
served only a single-year term. Three of these were on the
original 1946 Council, and the remaining 12 are spread
over the decade from 1956 to 1966. In our permutations,
these single-year terms are constrained to be single-year
terms in historical time, and a country that is assigned to
one of the relevant terms (e.g. the slot that was actually
held by the Philippines in 1963) serves only a single year
on that placebo Security Council rather than the standard
two years. Countries are assigned only to a tenure held by
a country from their same regional grouping and are
assigned only in the years during which they were UN
member states.4 As a general rule of thumb, we would
want someone knowledgeable about the Security Council
to have difficulty identifying which Security Councils
actually existed and which are placebos.
Other scholars have used permutation in a less con-
strained way. Erikson et al. (2014) scramble at random the
identities associated with countries for the independent
variable of interest in order to create a reference distribu-
tion in a time-series cross sectional setting. In the context of
UNSC compositions, we are less comfortable with such an
unconstrained permutation because such a procedure would
result in implausible compositions. For example, an uncon-
strained permutation might substitute Palau's Security
Council profile for Italy's. Such a move might contribute to
observing an incorrect number of states from the regional
groups or to countries being assigned an unrepresentative
number of times: Palau has never served on the Security
Council while Italy is a relatively frequent member. Our
comparisons therefore are constrained in the sense that per-
mutations are plausible given what we know about the his-
tory of UNSC elections.
We merge 1000 placebo UNSC histories with the data
from Vreeland and Dreher (2014), which covers the period
1960­2009. The results that we present below therefore
exclude the parts of the placebo histories that are outside of
this period. In Chapter 5 of their book, Vreeland and Dreher
(2014) present results from more than 50 multivariate lin-
ear regression models of foreign aid. There are four types of
models, each of which is estimated across 13 different
donors: the largest five bilateral donors and eight multilat-
eral donors.5 The first set of regressions model aid to 125
countries as a function of an indicator variable for tempo-
rary UNSC membership. The authors' estimate for the
UNSC indicator is statistically significant for Japan,
Germany, the International Bank for Reconstruction and
4 Research and Politics 
Development (IBRD), and the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR).6 The second set of regressions is iden-
tical except that the authors interact the UNSC indicator
with indicators of UNSC activity in a given year, classify-
ing each year as unimportant, somewhat important, or
important. In these models, Vreeland and Dreher (2014)
find statistically significant correlations between UNSC
membership during important years and aid flows from the
United States, Germany, and the IBRD.7 The third set of
models are estimated for 49 African recipient countries and
the authors find that UNSC membership significantly pre-
dicts increased aid flows to these countries from Japan, the
IBRD, the International Development Association (IDA),
the United Nations in general, the World Food Programme
(WFP), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and
the UNHCR.8 Finally, the fourth set of regressions model
aid toAfrican recipient countries as a function of serving on
the Security Council during important years or not.
Vreeland and Dreher (2014) find significant correlations
between UNSC membership by African recipients in
important years and aid flows from the United States, the
IBRD, the WFP, and the UNHCR.9
We replicate the regression models just described using
the set of 1000 placebo Security Councils. For each
regression model that we estimate, we use the same speci-
fication as Vreeland and Dreher (2014) and retain the esti-
mated t-statistic on the variable of interest (UNSC
membership in the first two sets of regressions and UNSC
membership during important years in the latter two sets
of regressions). The t-statistic on the coefficient of inter-
est is a "pivotal statistic" because it is adjusted for correla-
tion among the other variables included in the regression
(Erikson et al., 2014).
We create reference distributions and generate randomi-
zation-based two-tailed p-values by doubling the propor-
tion of test statistics in the reference distribution which are
more extreme than the observed t-statistic produced by the
statistical model of the real world data.10 This number tells
us whether or not that original t-statistic was outlying based
not on the Student's t-distribution but instead on an empiri-
cal distribution of t-statistics produced by analyzing the
patterns found in the placebo data.
Results
As can be seen in Tables 1­4, our randomization-based
p-values are almost always quite close to the distribution-
based p-values reported in Vreeland and Dreher (2014). In
some cases, they suggest slightly more precision (e.g. for
Japanese and German aid flows in Table 1), and in some cases
they suggest slightly less precision (e.g. for US and UNICEF
aid flows in Table 1).11 But generally speaking, the randomiza-
tion-based methods that we employ validate the levels of sta-
tistical significance reported in Vreeland and Dreher (2014).
The model for which we see a relatively substantial
change in the p-value linked to a regression coefficient that
Vreeland and Dreher (2014) consider to be statistically sig-
nificant is found in Table 2. The randomization p-value
reported for the coefficient on the relationship between
UNSC membership in important years and aid flows from
the United States is more than five times the distribution-
based p-value reported in Vreeland and Dreher's Table 5.1:
p < 0.33 as compared to p < 0.06. While Vreeland and
Dreher (2014) note that their estimate has a wide 90% con-
fidence interval and report that dropping certain control
variables from the model increases the size of the t-statistic,

our results suggest that we should remain skeptical about
the extent to which US aid flows to temporary members of
the Security Council increase in important years.
Figures 1 and 2 provide insight into how the permuta-
tion-based tests work. In each figure, we plot a theoretical
t-distribution and the t-statistic from the real-world data.
We then overlay the reference distribution created from the
t-statistics produced using data from the 1000 placebo
Security Councils, and we report the median t-statistic
observed in this reference distribution. Figure 1 draws on
the analyses of US aid flows; Figure 2 on analyses of
Japanese aid flows.
In the plot in the lower left-hand corner of Figure 1
(reflecting the models using the African subset and study-
ing all years) and across three of the four plots in Figure 2,
we see a very strong incidence between the Student's t-dis-
tribution and the randomization-based distribution. In the
remaining three plots in Figure 1 and in the fourth plot in
Figure 2, the coincidence of the theoretical and randomiza-
tion-based distributions is somewhat less. For the US data,
in particular, this non-coincidence of our placebo-based
reference distribution and the standard t-distribution sug-
gests that there are aspects of the data that make standard
significance tests inappropriate.
As the first rows of Tables 2 and 3--corresponding to
the two plots in the right-hand column of Figure 1--make
clear, the level of uncertainty in the findings for the United
States is somewhat greater than what conventional tests
indicate. The observed t-statistic of 1.90 from the real
UNSC data is not located as deeply in the tail of the pla-
cebo-based reference distribution as in the tail of the theo-
retical t-distribution. This more central location implies a
randomization p-value of p < 0.33, more than five times as
large as the p-value of p < 0.06 calculated using the theo-
retical t-distribution. In Figure 2, on the other hand, it is
easy to see how the observed t-statistics from the regres-
sions of Japanese aid on real-world UNSC membership are
in the tails for the plots related to Japanese aid flows to all
countries and to African countries, mirroring the small
p-values presented in Tables 1 and 3.
Conclusions
Previous work has pointed out that p-values produced by
standard statistical analysis of complicated time-series
cross-sectional data might not accurately reflect the level of
uncertainty in coefficient estimates (Erikson et al., 2010,
2014). One method for addressing this and creating more
accurate statistical significance estimates is to create a ref-
erence distribution for a test statistic based on a set of coun-
terfactual placebos generated by permuting the existing
data. Such permutation-based tests are popular in the
experimental literature (Gerber and Green, 2012) and have
been increasingly applied to observational data.
In this paper, we have replicated a substantial portion of
the analysis from Chapter 5 of Vreeland and Dreher's
(2014) book on how foreign aid flows respond to tempo-
rary membership on the Security Council. We largely
reproduce the statistical uncertainty estimates that those
authors obtain using clustered standard errors in a multi-
variate regression. We have provided additional validation
of the inferential claims that the authors make.
In doing so, we have made use of constrained permu-
tations. As also applied in Reynolds (2010, 2014), this
type of analysis creates a placebo test using a simulation
process that mirrors as closely as possible the data-gen-
erating process. In our case, we have constrained our
hypothetical Security Council to follow the regional dis-
tribution of temporary UNSC members and to respect
the prohibition of consecutive terms for temporary
UNSC members. Just as permutation-based tests in the
experimental literature make use of information that the
analyst has about the way in which the randomization of
treatment occurred, our constrained permutation tests
will be most plausible where the analyst has extensive
knowledge about the data-generating process. When this

is the case, we advocate using these tests as a compli-
ment to existing methods.
While the results reported here do not deviate signifi-
cantly from the original results, we might expect to see
more divergence in situations where the structure of the
data is less amenable to conventional statistical solutions
such as clustered standard errors (e.g. in the study of
dyadic data). In those cases, where there is unusual clus-
tering or unmodeled time-dependence in the data, a con-
strained permutation-based test may be more likely to
reveal unacceptable false positive rates for conventional
statistical tests.

Notes
 1. Before 1966, there were only six non-permanent members.
2. Specifically, there will be three non-permanent members
from the Africa Group, two from the Asia Group, two from
the Latin America and the Caribbean Group, one from
the Eastern European Group, and two from the Western
European and Others Group. There will be one representa-
tive from the League of Arab states as well, half of the time
as a representative for the Africa Group and half of the time
as a representative from the Asia Group.
 3. In relying only on the empirical probability of a country hav-
ing been on the Security Council over time, we make the
strong assumption that factors predicting election to the
Security Council are time invariant. In the future, the permu-
tation algorithm could weight the probability of assignment
by important time-varying factors, such as war and pariah-
state status (Vreeland and Dreher, 2014).
4. For each permutation, we begin by reassigning the tenures
of the countries that have served most frequently on the
Security Council. For instance, we assign Japan, which has
served 10 times as a non-permanent UNSC member, to the
relevant Asia seat for 10 hypothetical Security Councils. We
begin with the most frequent UNSC members in order to
reduce the probability of having to throw away a permuta-
tion because of back-to-back assignment (e.g. if there were
two Japanese tenures that remained to be assigned but the
only remaining seats were in adjacent years).
 5. The authors also study the African Development Bank, but
we do not replicate those results here.
 6. See the odd columns in Tables 5.1 and 5.4 and columns 1 and
5 from Table 5.3 of Vreeland and Dreher (2014).
7. Even columns in Tables 5.1 and 5.4 and columns 2 and 6
from Table 5.3 of Vreeland and Dreher (2014).
 8. Odd columns of Tables 5.2 and 5.5 and columns 3 and 7 of
Table 5.3 of Vreeland and Dreher (2014).
 9. Even columns of Tables 5.2 and 5.5 and columns 4 and 8 of
Table 5.3 of Vreeland and Dreher (2014).
10. This procedure is discussed in Rosenbaum (2010: 33).
11. The greater precision for the Japan results is coherent with
the findings in Vreeland and Dreher (2014) and also in Lim
and Vreeland (2013).
