Purpose of the Study: The study investigates
whether productive activities by older adults reduce
bodily inflammation, as indicated by C-reactive
protein (CRP), a biomeasure associated with the
risk of cardiovascular diseases. Design and
Methods: The study uses a representative sur-
vey of adults aged 57­85 from the National Social
Life, Health, and Aging Project (N = 1,790). Linear
regression models were used to analyze the effects
of multiple roles (employment, volunteering, attend-
ing meetings, and caregiving) and the frequency
of activity within each role on log values of CRP
concentration (mg/L) drawn from assayed blood
samples. Results: Number of roles for produc-
tive activities was associated with lower levels of
CRP net of chronic conditions, lifestyle factors, and
socioeconomic resources. When specific types of
activity were examined, volunteering manifested
the strongest association with lower levels of inflam-
mation, particularly in the 70+ group. There was
no evidence that frequent engagement in volunteer
activity was associated with heightened inflamma-
tion. Implications: Productive activities--and
frequent volunteering in particular--may protect
individuals from inflammation that is associated
with increased risk of hypertension and cardiovas-
cular disease.
Key Words: Productive activities, Volunteering, Social
participation, Acute-phase protein
Considerable research reveals that the vast
majority of older adults engage in productive activi-
ties, including employment, volunteering, and other
forms of social participation (Morrow-Howell,
Hinterlong, & Sherraden, 2001). Productive activi-
ties refer to paid or unpaid actions that make a con-
structive contribution to community life (Herzog,
Kahn, Morgan, Jackson, & Antonucci, 1989),
and many models of successful or optimal aging
consider them essential to well-being in later life
(Rowe & Kahn, 1997). Indeed, productive activi-
ties are widely extolled as salutary, and consider-
able research identifies that these activities can
enhance mental (Li & Ferraro, 2005) and physical
health (Morrow-Howell, Hinterlong, Rozario, &
Tang, 2003) and reduce mortality risk (Pynnönen,
Törnmakägas, Heikkinen, Rantanen, & Lyyra,
2012).
Despite extensive scholarly interest examining
productive activities and health in later life, most
studies rely upon self-reported measures of health,
disability, or physician-diagnosed illnesses, each of
which can be influenced by psychosocial resources
or access to health care. One wonders whether
productive activities exert effects on subclinical
measures of biological processes that are predictive
of major disease outcomes. If the relationship
exists, productive activities may be a palpable way
to prevent the development and onset of chronic
disease.

This study attempts to explicate the "upstream"
health protective effects of productive activities
by studying a marker of biological risk in older
adults. Specifically, we examine the link between
productive activities and C-reactive protein (CRP),
a measure of inflammation. CRP is a useful bio-
marker for this investigation because it typically
rises in later life, and high levels of CRP are linked
to cardiovascular diseases including heart attack
(Crimmins & Vasunilashorn, 2011).The main aims
of the article are twofold: (a) Identify the associa-
tion between the number of roles for productive
activities and inflammation; and (b) systematically
examine whether the relationship between produc-
tive activity and CRP varies by the frequency of
engagement within each activity.
Productive Activities and Health in Later Life
Considerable evidence supports the claim that
productive activity is beneficial to older adults'
health. Research on successful aging pioneered by
Rowe and Kahn (1997) points to the importance
of engaging in productive activities to maintain
health and well-being. Productive activity is a sig-
nificant element of maintaining health and func-
tioning, distinct from social relations or general
social embeddedness. Role theory has often been
used to explicate the health benefits of produc-
tive activities: volunteering or attending organ-
ized meetings provides individuals with a unique
opportunity to hold a meaningful social role and
remain similarly active in later life (Thoits, 2012).
Because most Americans subscribe to a busy ethic
and strive to engage in meaningful roles (Ekerdt,
1986), productive activities become a viable alter-
native for adults who typically experience multiple
role transitions in later life.
Previous research has used somewhat distinct
definitions of productive activities to predict health
outcomes. Volunteering and paid employment are
most commonly recognized as productive activities
(Burr, Mutchler, & Caro, 2007; Hinterlong, 2008;
Matz-Costa, Besen, James, & Pitt-Catsouphes,
2013; Musick & Wilson, 2003). Studies show
that volunteering is associated with well-being,
whether the outcome considered is depressive
symptoms (Li & Ferraro, 2005; Musick & Wilson,
2003), self-rated health (Lum & Lightfoot, 2005),
or hypertension (Tavares, Burr, & Mutchler, 2013).
Employment has similar health-promoting effects
in that employed men and women show virtu-
ally no decline in self-rated health and physical
functioning; however, healthier people are also
more likely to be employed (Ross & Mirowsky,
1995).
Caregiving is also widely recognized as an
important form of productive activity (Burr
et al., 2007; Hinterlong, 2008; Matz-Costa et al.,
2013). The contribution of middle-aged and older
caregivers generates enormous benefits for the
nation and for those served. Despite a large body
of research documenting caregivers' depression
and worse physical health (Pinquart & Sörensen,
2003), some studies demonstrate that caregiving
behaviors may improve adults' well-being (Brown,
Nesse, Vinokur, & Smith, 2003). Moen, Robison,
and Dempster-McClain (1995), however, found no
direct effects of concurrent or past caregiving on
health.
Although studied less frequently, community
engagement is another component of productive
activity that may have health benefits. Community
engagement includes a wide range of activities
such as voting, attending community meetings,
and contributing financially to or holding a leader-
ship position in a community organization (Burr,
Caro, & Moorhead, 2002; Mendes De Leon,
Glass, & Berkman, 2003). Some of these activities
require a considerable investment of resources, but
Mendes De Leon and coworkers (2003) argue for
the importance of tapping activities in which older
adults are commonly involved. Meeting attend-
ance is one of the more prevalent forms of com-
munity engagement for older adults, even though
it requires a commitment of time and skills (Burr
et al., 2002). Few studies, however, have examined
whether meeting attendance has a salutary effect
on health in later life.
Health benefits from such roles in later life may
accruefromthemeaningattachedtothem,including
status, influence, and emotional gratification
(Moen et al., 1995; Thoits, 1986, 2012). When
the types of productive activity are profiled across
the life course, younger adults typically engage in
roles that are related to their other statuses (e.g.,
parent or employee), whereas older adults are
motivated by more intrinsic reasons such as their
values in helping others or their interests in local
community (Herzog et al., 1989; Van Willigen,
2000). Thus, the meanings and values associated
with nonobligatory roles may be more salutary to
health than is the case for obligatory roles. If the
person feels generative by contributing to the well-
being of others, the benefits are manifest in lower
risk of impairment in activities of daily living and

mortality (Gruenewald, Liao, & Seeman, 2012;
Piliavin & Siegl, 2007).
Several theoretical and empirical studies also
suggest that productive activities may be espe-
cially beneficial for older adults. Role accumula-
tion theory suggests that multiple role occupancy
is relevant in older ages because reduction rather
than accumulation of roles becomes more com-
monplace in later life (Moen et al., 1995).
Empirical studies confirm this thesis. For instance,
Van Willigen (2000) used longitudinal data to
demonstrate that older volunteers (aged 60 and
older) are more likely than younger adults to
experience additional psychological health ben-
efits for each hour of participation. Also, Musick
and Wilson (2003) reported that volunteering
had a negative effect on depressive symptoms for
older adults but not for those less than 65 years
old. Because older adults may be more likely than
younger persons to derive a psychological benefit
from productive activity, one wonders whether
the effect extends to physical health phenomena
such as inflammatory processes.
Advancing the Literature
The literature on the health benefits of produc-
tive activities in older adults has yielded several
notable discoveries. Perhaps most impressive is the
breadth of outcomes considered. Previous research
demonstrates that productive activities among
older adults are associated with better self-rated
health (Hinterlong, Morrow-Howell, & Rozario,
2007; Lum & Lightfoot, 2005), fewer depressive
symptoms (Thoits & Hewitt, 2001), and greater
life satisfaction (Baker, Cahalin, Gerst, & Burr,
2005). Recent discoveries also reveal that produc-
tive activities reduce the risk of hypertension in
Americans (Tavares et al., 2013) and the risks of
institutionalization and mortality in Finnish older
adults (Pynnönen et al., 2012). As Rowe and Kahn
(1997) argue, productive activities have distinc-
tive health benefits because they provide not only
a sense of belonging to a group with whom one
shares common interests and activities but also a
unique chance to hold social roles that give pur-
pose and meaning to life (Thoits, 2012). Building
on the contributions of previous research demon-
strating the health benefits of productive activities,
we articulate three ways to advance the current
body of research.
First, most studies of productive activities rely
on self-reported measures of physical and mental
health. Although self-reported measures are widely
accepted as valid, investigations are warranted
that examine the influence of productive activi-
ties on biological measures, which are harbingers
of subsequent health problems. Indeed, the power
of using biomarkers in health research is the early
detection of bodily risks that might not yet register
clinically.
CRP, produced in the liver, is a useful biomarker
because it indicates systemic levels of inflamma-
tion and is linked to risk of heart attack, stroke,
and mortality (Crimmins & Vasunilashorn, 2011).
CRP is related to some modifiable cardiovascular
risk factors such as smoking, physical activity, and
obesity (McDade, Hawkley, & Cacioppo, 2006)
but is also inversely related to social integration:
Maintaining ties to a larger community and hav-
ing close and supportive relationships are related
lowering chronic inflammation (Loucks, Berkman,
Gruenewald, & Seeman, 2006). Accordingly, CRP
presents an important and novel way to explore
links between productive activities and physical
health in older adults.
Productive activities may, in fact, lower older
adults' inflammation through multiple pathways,
particularly when they select the role.One potential
pathway involves stimulating healthier responses
to environmental challenges or stressors. Indeed,
an observational study showed that social integra-
tion is related to quicker cardiovascular recovery
from a day's exertions (Evans & Steptoe, 2001).
Perhaps productive activities are similarly benefi-
cial by improving bodily response to stressors, but
we are unaware of any studies that examine the
link between productive activity and CRP.
Second, though the majority of existing research
examines a single indicator of productive activity,
some studies point to the importance of consid-
ering a more complex picture of individuals who
remain active (Baker et al., 2005; Hinterlong,
2008). Because concurrent engagement in multiple
activities is common, failure to consider multiple
roles may be misleading because the purported
salubrious effects of productivity activities might
be due to a related role that is not measured.
Third, though multiple roles may be beneficial
to health, the level of involvement in each role
may be consequential to the purported health
benefits (Matz-Costa et al., 2013). Scholarship
on volunteering also points to how burnout or
overcommitment can lead to termination of the
volunteer role or unfavorable health outcomes (Li
& Ferraro,2006; Rotolo,2000).Such role overload
832 The Gerontologist
can manifest itself on inflammation in two ways.
First, high level of time commitment in productive
activities may offset the purported benefits (i.e.,
diminishing returns). Second, and more generally,
it raises the question of whether the health benefits
of productive activities accrue primarily by regular
engagement in one role, modest engagement in
multiple roles, or some combination of both.
A longitudinal study of older adults included
multiple roles, suggesting that both the number of
roles and the amount spent engaging in each role
are significant predictors of happiness (Baker et al.,
2005).The current investigation examines both the
number of productive activities performed by older
adults and the frequency of participation within
each type of activity in predicting levels of CRP.
Drawn from the extant literature,we specify four
hypotheses to guide the analysis. First, we hypoth-
esize that older adults reporting more roles of
productive activity will have lower levels of inflam-
mation, measured by C-reactive protein. Second,
we hypothesize that the frequency of participation
within a role is negatively related to CRP. Testing
the first two hypotheses leads us to specify a third
that may be referred to as a role overload hypoth-
esis: The health benefits of productive activities
accrue until the person reaches very high levels of
participation in multiple roles (interaction hypoth-
esis). Fourth, given that other studies reveal that
older adults are more likely than younger adults
to reap health benefits from productive activity, we
hypothesize that the effect of productive activities
on CRP is stronger for adults 70 or older than for
those who have not yet reached 70 (interaction
hypothesis; Van Willigen, 2000).
Method
Sample
The study used data from the National Social
Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), a nation-
ally representative, population-based sampling
during 2005­2006 of 3,005 adults aged 57­85 in
the United States. In order to ensure representa-
tion of particular groups, the sample includes an
oversampling by age, race, and gender. Additional
information on the NSHAP sample is available in
a report by O'Muircheartaigh, Eckman, and Smith
(2009).
A random 83% sample of the 3,005 respondents
(n = 2,494) was selected to undergo whole blood
spot collection, and 1,939 individuals (85%
response rate) provided usable samples.The reasons
for eliminating cases include refusal, equipment
problem, and insufficient volume of blood. As is
standard in the literature, 136 additional cases
with very high CRP levels (>8.6mg/L), which may
be indicative of inflammatory response to acute
conditions such as cold, flu, or injury, were dropped
from the analyses (Herd, Karraker, & Friedman,
2012). Regardless, sensitivity tests demonstrated
no meaningful differences in the pattern of findings
when including the highest CRP values. Finally,
13 cases with missing information for race or
emphysema were excluded because the number of
these cases is small. The final analytic sample size
is 1,790.
Measurement
CRP Concentration.--During the interview, a
blood sample was collected via a fingerstick and
disposable lancet and applied to filter paper for
transport and storage. The blood spot assays were
conducted at the Laboratory for Human Biology
Research at Northwestern University (Williams &
McDade, 2009). As shown in Table 1, mean CRP
was 2.08 (SD = 1.98). Given the highly skewed
distribution of CRP, values were transformed for
the statistical analyses (natural logarithm; Herd
et al., 2012).
Productive Activities.--Four productive activi-
ties were examined: employment, volunteering,
attending meetings, and caregiving. We created a
binary variable for each role and summed them to
create number of roles (range from 0 to 4).
The frequency of activity was assessed by
items asking respondents how often they engage
in each activity. For employment, respondents
reported the number of hours they typically work
during 1 week. We defined those who work 40hr
or more a week as full-time workers. Additional
analyses examined alternative thresholds for
full-time employment, but the conclusions were
unchanged. For volunteering, respondents were
asked how often they volunteered for religious,
charitable, political, health-related, or other
organizations in the past 12 months. Responses
ranged from never (0) to several times a week (6).
Using the same response categories as for volun-
teering, respondents were also asked about their
frequency of attending meetings of any organized
groups. Consistent with prior studies, meeting
attendance is used as a measure of community
engagement--a component of productive activity
Vol. 54, No. 5, 2014 833
(Burr et al., 2002). Finally, respondents were
asked whether they are currently assisting an
adult who needs help with day-to-day activities
because of age or disability. If answered yes, they
were then probed how many days per week they
typically spend caring for this person. The origi-
nal response ranged from 0 to 7 days. However,
because only eight individuals answered that they
spend 5 days on caregiving, we combined 5 and
6 days. The final response categories ranged from
0 to 6, consistent with volunteering and attend-
ing meetings.
Additional Covariates.--In addition to pro-
ductive activities, several covariates were included
because of their association with chronic inflam-
mation (Schafer & Ferraro, 2011). Age is coded
in years, and sex is dichotomized with 1 indi-
cating female. Race was divided into a series of
binary variables (White, Black, and other race)
with non-Hispanic White serving as the refer-
ence group. Other race consisted of Hispanic
Americans, Native Americans, Asian or Pacific
Islander, and those identifying themselves as
multiracial. (Whereas most Hispanic Americans
identified as "other" race, supplementary analy-
ses distinguishing them were estimated but the
variable was nonsignificant in all specifications.)
Marital status was also dichotomized with 1
indicating married or cohabiting with a partner.
To tap socioeconomic resources, four categories
of educational attainment (less than high school,
high school, some college, and B.S. or more) and
a binary variable for low wealth were included in
the analyses. For wealth, participants were asked
to estimate their net worth including all of their
investment, properties, and other financial assets
minus debt. Then a binary variable was created
differentiating respondents in the lowest 20%
of the household net worth from those in the
top 80%.
For lifestyle variables known to be related
to CRP, we use self-reported information.
Participants who reported as currently smoking
cigarettes, pipes, cigars, or chewing tobacco were
classified as current tobacco users. Physical activity
was measured with an item probing respondents'
engagement in physical activities such as walking,
dancing, or exercise (0 = never, 1 = once a month,
2 = one to three times a month, 3 = one to two
times a week, 4 = three or more times per week).
Obese individuals were identified with body mass
index values  30kg/m2.
The analysis adjusts for physical and mental health
conditions that may be related to CRP. For mental
health, we also included depressive symp
toms based
on the 11-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies
Depression Scale (Cronbach's  = .93). Clinically
relevant chronic health conditions include dummy
variables for whether the respondent was ever diag
nosed by a physician for emphysema, asthma, and
diabetes. Given the documented inverse relationship
between lipid-lowering treatment and CRP (McDade
et al., 2006), lipid medication use was also included
in the analyses, measured with a binary variable.
Supplementary analyses considered additional covari
ates such as income, antihypertensive medicine use,
and self-reported physical and mental health. These
were omitted then from the final analyses, however,
because they were nonsignificant in multivariate
specifications.
Analyses
Analyses used ordinary least-squares (OLS)
regression to model the natural log of CRP. We
specified separate models to examine number of
productive activities and frequency within each
activity, as well as their joint effects. In addition
to an additive model with the independent varia-
bles, multiplicative models were estimated to test
interactions between the number of roles and fre-
quency of productive activity. We also tested the
robustness of our results in two supplementary
analyses: (a) OLS regression predicting raw CRP
values and (b) ordinal logistic regression with
ordinal CRP as others have done (Sesso et al.,
2003). Because CRP has clinical cutoffs that lend
themselves to logistic regression (<1, 1­2.99, and
3mg/L), we used the three-category classification
of CRP as the outcome variable in supplemen-
tary analyses. The results from the ordinal logis-
tic regression are provided in the Supplementary
Material, but we focus on the OLS results in
the text.
We handled missing values on variables by
employing multiple imputation (Stata 11) for 498
cases, 294 of which were missing information on
volunteering variable. We imputed five values for
each missing observation, averaged the coefficients
and calculated new standard errors that account
for the variation across multiple potential imputed
values (Rubin, 2004). We used all the information
available to impute for missing data on independ-
ent variables but did not impute for the outcome
measure (von Hippel, 2007).
834 The Gerontologist
Results
Table 1 displays the descriptive statistics for
each variable, and the mean CRP level of 2.08 is
regarded as average risk (>3 indicates high risk).
Most NSHAP respondents engaged in two to three
productive activities, with the largest proportion
engaging in meeting attendance (69.1%, distribu-
tion not shown) and the lowest proportion in car-
egiving (17.5%). Volunteers comprised 62.5% of
the sample; 31.9% of the sample was employed.
Note that more than one third of the entire sample
has a body mass index  30.
Turning to Table 2, the Model 1 results reveal
that each role of productive activity is associated
with lower CRP (b = -0.05, p < .05) even after
adjusting for all control variables. Women and
Black respondents generally had higher levels
of CRP, and higher educational attainment was
associated with lower CRP. Of the lifestyle fac-
tors, tobacco use and obesity were associated with
higher CRP, and physical activity was associated
with lower CRP. Given the gender differences,
we estimated supplementary models stratified by
gender but the substantive results were similar. In
order to further examine possible confounding
effects of lipid medication on productive activity
and CRP, we conducted supplementary analyses
with and without the lipid medication variable,
and the conclusions were unchanged.
In Model 2, we examined the frequency of
engaging in each productive activity while adjusting
for the covariates. Of the four types, only frequent
volunteering is associated with lower CRP (p < .05).
The other three types of productive activity were
not associated with CRP.
The effects of other control variables were simi-
lar to the previous model.
The final OLS model includes both number of
roles and frequency of each activity. The results
shown in Model 3 reveal that the frequency of vol-
unteering is associated with lower CRP, but num-
ber of roles is no longer significant. The results
lend partial support for Hypothesis 2 stating that
frequency of participation within a role (i.e., vol-
unteer) is negatively related to CRP.
As described earlier, we also estimated the
effects of productive activities on three categories
of CRP (Sesso et al., 2003); the results are pre-
sented in the Supplementary Material. The pattern
of results from the ordinal logistic regression is
very similar to those obtained with OLS. As shown
in Model 3 in the Supplementary Material, a unit
difference in volunteering is associated with an 8%
reduction in the odds of being in a higher category
of inflammation (odds ratio = 0.92, confidence
interval = 0.87­0.98).
Our next step was to complete additional analy-
ses to examine the role overload hypothesis. We
tested two specifications in the OLS analyses: (a)
A quadratic term for overall frequency of produc-
tive activities (to test for nonlinearity in the rela-
tionship between frequency and CRP) and (b) an
interaction between the number of roles and the
sum of activity frequency (across the four types).
Results from both tests give no evidence that high
levels of engagement in multiple roles are detri-
mental to health in older adults (results not shown
but available upon request).
Finally, we tested for the hypothesis that the
benefits of productive activity are stronger for
adults 70 years or older (OLS analysis). In doing
so, we focused on volunteering frequency because
the results from previous analyses revealed that

volunteering was the most consistent predic-
tor of CRP. We first tested the interaction of age
groups and volunteer frequency on CRP. The result
revealed that the model with the interaction term
was a better fit than the model excluding the prod-
uct term (F = 6.13, p = .01). Thus, we proceeded to
further investigate the age differences. Stratifying
the sample into 58­69 years and 70­85 years, we
discovered that the frequency of volunteering has
distinct effects on CRP in the two groups.Although
frequency of volunteering is associated with lower
CRP, the effect is actually stronger for those 70 or
older. As shown in Figure 1, among people with
low levels of volunteering, CRP levels differed little
by age group. By contrast, among persons engaged
in frequent volunteering, CRP was lower among
the respondents 70 or older. People who are
70­85 years of age and very active as volunteers
exhibited lower CRP than persons aged 58­69
who were not very active as volunteers.
The test of Hypothesis 4 focused on volunteer-
ing--the most consistent predictor of CRP--but we
conducted supplementary age-stratified analyses to
determine whether the other forms of productive
activity were related to CRP in either age group.
Even in the subsample < 70, the other forms of
productive activity (e.g., employment) were not
related to CRP.
Discussion
Using nationally representative data from older
adults, the current study showed that older peo-
ple engaged in more roles of productive activities
report lower CRP (Hypothesis 1). However, when
both frequency of participation and number of
roles were considered simultaneously, frequency
of participation in volunteering manifested the
most robust association with CRP (Hypothesis 2).
The findings are consistent with previous research
showing that volunteer activity improves various
health outcomes (Morrow-Howell et al., 2003).
Volunteering is associated with better health, pos-
sibly through emotional gratification (Morrow-
Howell et al., 2003), feelings of generativity
(Gruenewald et al., 2012), and increases in social
integration (Loucks et al., 2006). Regularly engag-
ing in volunteering has a special way of getting

"under the skin," resulting in what appears as a
younger biological profile for inflammation.
The study extends the research on health bene-
fits of volunteering and clarifies the need for inves-
tigating not only self-reported measures of health
but also biomeasures. Doing so will aid further
understanding of the mechanisms between produc-
tive activities and health. The findings of this study
point to a specific type of productive activity--vol-
unteering--as an agent for maintaining lower lev-
els of chronic inflammation.
The analysis also yielded an intriguing finding
related to age differences in the effects of productive
activities: frequent volunteering is particularly
beneficial on CRP among adults 70 years or
older (Hypothesis 4). NSHAP septuagenarians
and octogenarians who were frequent volunteers
had lower CRP levels than comparably active
volunteers who were 58­69 years old. This finding
shows that frequent volunteering benefits older
adults in terms of having a "younger" biological
profile. Although our findings are based on CRP
as the outcome, the conclusion is consistent with
findings of others that older people may reap more
positive health benefits from volunteering than is
the case for adults of younger ages (Van Willigen,
2000). Because it might be the case that younger
and healthier individuals are more likely to be
selected (or asked) into volunteering, we examined
mean CRP levels in different age groups using a
two-sample t-test. The results showed that mean
CRP levels do not differ across these groups.
This study examined the effect of multiple roles
of productive activity including volunteering,
employment, meeting attendance, and caregiving.
The results, however, showed clearly that volun-
teering is the type of productive activity most likely
to have health benefits.
We wondered whether the emphasis on volun-
teering in prior studies may have neglected health
benefits from other forms of productive activity,
but the results from this study suggest otherwise.
Perhaps some prior studies examined other forms
of social activities but, like the present investiga-
tion, found volunteering to be the most consequen-
tial to health. Whatever the case, our findings add
to the accumulated body of research demonstrating
that volunteering is distinctive in its health-giving
properties (Hinterlong et al., 2007; Li & Ferraro,
2006; Morrow-Howell et al., 2003; Tavares et al.,
2013; Van Willigen, 2000).
We also hypothesized that role overload
may nullify the purported health from produc-
tive activity (i.e., when older people are highly
engaged in many productive roles). We found
no evidence for the role overload hypothesis
even if people were very active in many roles
(Hypothesis 3). Although our findings are con-
sistent with much of the literature regarding the
overall benefits of productive activity, we could
not replicate the adverse effect on health due to
a high time commitment to volunteering (Van
Willigen, 2000). Perhaps the role overload thesis
applies to other health outcomes, but not to CRP,

or it may be due to measurement issues described
subsequently.
This study is limited in important ways, and
one may be related to our inability to replicate
the adverse effects of very high time commitments
in productive activities. Unlike other studies that
capture actual hours of productive activity, the
maximum value for productive activity in NSHAP
is "several times a week." In comparison to
accumulated hours in an activity, this is a crude
measure, perhaps resulting in a ceiling effect. We
thought that seven categories of frequency in most
of the productive activities, coupled with four roles,
would be sufficient to tap intense engagement in
multiple productive activities, but it would be
preferable to have a more detailed measurement of
frequency within each role.
Second, the measurement of productive activity
in the NSHAP is notably limited. When volunteer
activity is considered, the number of organizations
and types of activities may have significant impli-
cations on volunteers' health, but these are not
assessed in the survey. We used the available meas-
ures to examine the research question but welcome
future research with more complete measurement
of productive activity. Community engagement is
an important component of productive activity,
but our findings are limited by using one indicator:
meeting attendance. It would be very helpful for
future studies to tap other indicators of commu-
nity engagement such as voting, leadership roles,
and financial contributions to community organi-
zations. Studies that include a more comprehen-
sive measurement of productive activity may prove
especially useful for explicating the mechanisms by
which it is related to health.
Third, a notable limitation of this study is the
cross-sectional nature of the data, raising the con-
cern that healthy individuals (low CRP) might be
selected into participation in productive activi-
ties. Although the measurement of CRP obviously
occurred after the productive activities reported in
the interview, it is still possible that health selec-
tion is operant. To address this possible concern,
we accounted for health lifestyle factors, chronic
conditions, and depressive symptoms--and the
benefits of productive activity on CRP remained
despite the inclusion of these variables and socio-
economic resources. Although we think the risk of
reverse causality invalidating the results is quite
low, longitudinal tracking of productive activities
and CRP would be especially helpful to check on
the conclusions presented herein.
Finally,the sample comprised community-dwell-
ing adults, and the results cannot be generalized to
those living in assisted living, nursing homes, or
other types of congregate facilities. Future research
needs to investigate whether older adults living in
these environments reap the same health benefits
from productive activities as was observed for
community-dwelling adults in the NSHAP.
In sum, the study not only provides empiri-
cal support to the generalization that volunteer
activity is beneficial to health, but it contributes
to the literature by revealing that such health
benefits include lower inflammation. We are una-
ware of any previous study to report that produc-
tive activity, especially volunteering, is associated
with lower CRP. Given that CRP generally rises
with age, the benefits of volunteering to coun-
teract that trend are noteworthy. Moreover, we
uncovered that the benefit of frequent volunteer-
ing was actually stronger for the oldest members
of the sample, suggesting the health utility of sus-
tained engagement in volunteer activities.
