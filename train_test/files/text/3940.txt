The Concept of Social Interest
Alfred Adler's (1938/1964) concept of social interest is one
of the cornerstones of his personality theory and was his
most important personality trait. Adler stated, "Social inter-
est is the main characteristic of each person and is involved
in all his [sic] actions" (p. 774). Social interest involves a
sense of social feeling toward all humankind, and the
essence of social interest is the valuing of something outside
the self without ulterior motives. In other words, people with
social interest have an absence of self-centeredness, egocen-
tricity, and self-absorption. Social interest is based on one's
identification with others and a transcendence of one's own
interests, resulting in a genuine concern with and striving for
community and human welfare. Adler believed that social
interest is manifested in the life tasks of friendship, love, and
work, and he also believed that mental health requires that
one successfully cope with these major and pervasive chal-
lenges of life through social interest. Adler's theory stated
that social interest has important implications for personal
adjustment as well as for the well-being of society. Social
interest was seen as the foundation of mental health, and, as
a corollary, many intrapersonal and interpersonal difficulties
could be traced to an absence of social interest and commu-
nity feeling.
Empirical Support
for Social Interest Theory
Decades of research has established that individuals with
relatively high levels of social interest, as assessed by a vari-
ety of instruments, possess common personality traits, such
as friendliness, empathy, cooperation, tolerance, nurturance,
and constructive independence (e.g., Crandall, 1981; Leak,
Millard, Perry, & Williams, 1985; see Watkins, 1994, for an
especially helpful review). Such individuals have also been
found to have higher levels of marital satisfaction (e.g.,
Markowski & Greenwood, 1984), faith development, and
spiritual maturity (Leak, 1992), and fewer symptoms of neu-
roticism, such as anxiety, hostility, and depression (cited in
Watkins, 1994).
Measurement of Social Interest
With the Social Interest Index (SII)
Within the past three decades, at least six self-report mea-
sures of social interest have been developed. Perhaps the
most frequently used measure is the SII (Greever, Tseng, &
Friedland, 1973). This instrument is divided into four sub-
scales of eight items each, and it was designed to measure
one's level of social interest in the four Adlerian "life tasks"
of friendship, love, work, and self-significance. Prior research
(Watkins, 1994) and a recent meta-analysis (Bass, Curlette,
Kern, & McWilliams, 2002) have presented evidence sup-
porting the criterion validity of the SII.
Despite research indicating that the total score on the SII
may be a sound measure of social interest, it has received
some criticisms. The areas of greatest weakness seem to be

Confirmatory Factor Analysis
of the Social Interest Index
Gary K. Leak1
Abstract
Social interest was Alfred Adler's most important personality trait, and it reflects one's genuine concern for the welfare of
all individuals. Several measures of social interest are available, and the Social Interest Index (SII) is one of the most popular
in current use. This study is the first to report the results of a confirmatory factor analysis of the SII. Using college students,
three models were tested in an effort to find support for the factorial validity of this scale. All analyses showed a poor fit
between the theoretical model and scale items. The results paint a fairly negative picture of the factor structure of this
important scale.

its muddled factor structure (e.g., inappropriate factor load-
ings; Leak, 1982), and the factor structures found across stud-
ies have proven difficult to replicate (Leak, 1982; Watkins,
1994). Some studies have found a four-factor solution
(Zarski, Bubenzer, & West, 1983) whereas others have
found a five-factor solution (Zarski, West, & Bubenzer,
1981). Furthermore, some studies have found the existence
of a general social interest factor (Greever et al., 1973),
whereas others have not (Leak, 1982). Finally, the four sub-
scales have been plagued by low internal consistencies
( range = .35-.64; Greever et al., 1973).
Purpose of the Present Study
This research focused on the SII because it is one of the most
frequently used measures of social interest, and many stud-
ies have found support for its criterion validity (Bass et al.,
2002). Despite its popularity and promise, however, Leak
(1982, 2006) and Watkins (1994) have identified several
problems with the SII (reviewed above), such as conceptu-
ally and statistically flawed items (e.g., "I enjoy music and
literature" as an indicator of social feeling, and low or nega-
tive item-total correlations, respectively) and poor factorial
validity.
However, there is a serious limitation to factor analytic
studies mentioned above: They were based on exploratory
factor analysis (EFA) only. The superiority of confirmatory
factor analysis (CFA) over EFA is widely noted (e.g.,
Blunch, 2008; Brown, 2006; Kline, 2005). Examples of
these advantages of CFA are its ability to examine correla-
tions among factors (rather than scales), and the ability to
estimate parameters (e.g., factor loadings), without the influ-
ence of measurement error. In addition, CFA allows for a
more rigorous and precise test of the structure of a scale
(e.g., EFA allows all items to load on all factors whereas
CFA forces items to load on only certain factors.) To date no
assessment of the factorial validity of the SII using CFA has
been attempted. This study was designed to provide more
information about the factorial validity of the SII through the
use of CFA.
Method
Participants, Procedure, and Instrument
Undergraduate students (n = 500; 60% women; M
age
= 19.4)
at a Jesuit university were recruited from Introductory,
Developmental, and Personal Growth psychology classes.
Data were collected in groups of approximately 10 as part
of a larger project on social interest, religion, and psycho-
logical well-being. They were awarded extra credit toward
their course grade for their participation.
The SII (Greever et al., 1973) is a 32-item instrument with
items clustered into four scales of 8 items each, each designed
to assess the specific Adlerian "life tasks" of Friendship,
Self-Significance, Love, and Work. Respondents answered
on a 5-point Likert-type scale from strongly disagree to
strongly agree.
Results
Evaluation of the SII Using
the Original Theoretical Model
Initial analyses searched for violation of CFA assumptions
(e.g., multivariate normality). Next, a measurement model
was proposed based on the conceptualization of social inter-
est that guided the development of the SII. This was Model 1,
and it specified four factors or latent traits with 8 items per
factor. In other words, the model specified that social inter-
est is manifested in four psychological domains or latent
traits, and those traits are assessed with 32 items or indica-
tors from the original scale. Table 1 presents the factor load-
ings of each item on its putative latent trait.
An examination of the parameter estimates' critical ratios
indicated several weak items (SII Items 12, 29, and 31; p > .01).
Four items had low standardized regression weights (s < .20;
Items 12, 29, 31, and 32; mean coefficient = .46, range = -.01
to .72). Two of the covariances between factors were unac-
ceptably low (p > .01), and both involved the Work factor
(mean correlation between factors = .57). Furthermore, the
only factor variance to not reach acceptable significance
was, again, the Work factor (p > .01). Finally, the squared
multiple correlations (R2) between the 32 scale items or indi-
cators and their underlying factor revealed that 11 were
extremely low1 indicating weak linkages between the factor
and its indicators (mean R2 = .24; range = .00 to .51).
Table 2 presents fit indices for model evaluation. The
indices selected are among the most respected in the field
(Byrne, 2010), and they differ in terms of the information
they provide about model fit as well as the factors they take
into account in their calculation (e.g., being sensitive to the
parsimony of the model). Several fit measures indicated a
poor fit between the theoretical model and the observed
covariance structure in the data: 2 = 1,602, p < .001; com-
parative fit index (CFI) = .68; Akaike information criterion
(AIC) = 1,743. Root mean square error of approximation
(RMSEA), however, had a value of .07, and that value repre-
sents "reasonable errors of approximation" (Byrne, p. 80). A
large number of modification indices had values above 10
suggesting many areas of model weakness or "strain" con-
tributing to poor model-data fit.
Evaluation of a Revised Three-Factor,
24-Item Model
A second model was tested after removing the largest source
of ill-fit, the psychometrically weak Work factor and its
Leak 3
items from the model. This resulted in a 24-item, three-
factor model and labeled Model 2 in Table 1. Fit measures
suggested an improved but still poor (2, CFI, AIC) or ade-
quate (RMSEA) fit between the model and the data. A test
for the difference in fit between the two models, using a test
of the difference between chi-square values (Kline, 2005),
failed to establish that Model 2 was superior to Model 1,
2(209) = 3.5, p > .05. However, the Model 1 versus Model
2 CFI and AIC values argued for the superiority of Model 2.
Again, weak items were found that either (a) failed to
have significant critical ratios for their parameter estimates,
(b) had low standardized regression weights (s < .40), and/or
(c) had low R2 values.
Evaluation of a Three-Factor, 15-Item Model
Nine weak items identified in Model 2 were eliminated. The
new model, Model 3, generated an improved fit relative to
Model 2 in terms of changes in CFI and AIC values but not
in terms of change in chi-square values, 2(162) = 3.26,
p > .05, or RMSEA. Even though Model 3 is a better model
in some ways, the improvement over Model 2 is a relative
one; Model 3 still represents a poor fit in an absolute sense.
Even after eliminating the poorest items from Model 2, the
three-factor, 15-item model still did not adequately repro-
duce the empirical covariance matrix and thus has unaccept-
able factorial validity.2
Test of a Unidimensional Model
In light of the negative evidence to this point, it is possible
that the theoretical structure of the SII, based on various life
tasks or factors, is fundamentally incorrect. In other words,
it may indeed be best not to view it as a multidimensional
scale. Thus, a one-factor, 32-indicator model was tested.
There was no evidence of acceptable fit: 2 = 2,119, p < .001;
CFI = .53; RMSEA = .084; AIC = 2,245.

Note: SII = Social Interest Index. R2 is the coefficient of determination
and gives information on the amount of variance of the item that could
be predicted by its putative causal factor or subscale of social interest,
whereas 1 - R2 conveys the variance of an item that could be traced to
measurement error (see Note 1). A copy of the SII is available from the
author.

that generated the Social Interest Index (SII) and it contained four factors
and 32 indicators. Model 2 is the SII with the problematic Work factor
and its 8 items removed (i.e., retaining three factors and 24 items). Model 3
contains three factors and 15 items (i.e., after 9 statistically weak items
were removed from Model 2). For CFI, a well-fitting model should have a
value .95 (Byrne, 2009); for AIC and RMSEA, the smaller the values the
better the fit.

scale with four hypothesized latent traits) generated a severe
challenge to the factorial validity of the SII based on every
statistic of model fit used except one. Given previous chal-
lenges to the integrity of the factor structure of the SII using
EFA, coupled with the results presented here, I believe it
would be negligent to maintain faith in, and continue to use
in research, the original four subscales of SII as measures of
Adlerian life tasks. Especially problematic was the Work
factor, and it was deleted in Model 2. Again there was a poor
fit of the model to the data. Various statistics were used as
guidance in generating another hypothesized model to
obtain better fit. This resulted in the best fitting model: a
three-factor, 15-item scale, but although better than previous
versions, the solution remained inadequate by traditional
CFA standards (Byrne, 2009).
Implications
What can be concluded from the results of these analyses?
I believe three conclusions are reasonable. One, researchers
should not include the Work subscale and its psychometri-
cally weak items in social interest research. Second, the
revised Love factor (Model 3) was evaluated as a four-item
scale, and it had unacceptably low internal consistency reli-
ability to justify its use in research.2 This leaves only two
latent traits as the basis for two subscales, and one of those,
Self-Significance, is of dubious theoretical heritage.
(Watkins, 1994, has argued that self-significance does not
appear in Adler's writings and seem antithetical to the nature
of other-oriented social interest.) Third, do not be tempted to
use Model 3 as the foundation for a revised, shortened mea-
sure of social interest. The third model was certainly the best
one tested, but it still did not perform well in the CFA (see
Tables 1 and 2). Researchers cannot continue to justify their
faith in the SII or any of its progeny that emerged here as
measures of specific Adlerian life tasks. Researchers should
instead turn to other measures of social interest that have
shown greater promise (cf. Bass et al., 2002).

Notes
1. R2 < .20. This means that less than 20% of the variance on the item
(i.e., differences among people) could be predicted by its putative
causal factor of social interest, whereas more than 80% variance of
an item could be traced to systematic and/or random measurement
error and not differences among people in social interest.
2. Three brief scales were constructed from the 15 items in
Model 3. The alphas for the abbreviated Friendship, Self-
Significance, and Love scales were .79, .82, and .72, respec-
tively. A total score based on those 15 items yielded an alpha
of .81, and the alpha for the 32-item scale was .82 in this
sample.
