NOW THAT THE HUMAN GE-
nome has been sequenced,
and as scientists elucidate
the location and function of
all human genes, public health policy-
makers face the daunting task of mak-
ing complex decisions about the ap-
propriateness and usefulness of genetic
screening. To make such decisions, they
will first need population-based esti-
mates of the prevalence and pen-
etrance of these mutations. Heredi-
tary hemochromatosis (HH), a major
form of iron overload disease, can serve
as a model for making such decisions.
Hereditary hemochromatosis is a dis-
order of iron metabolism in which ex-
cess iron absorption leads to deposition
of iron in multiple organs, resulting in
cirrhosis, diabetes, cardiomyopathy, or
hypogonadism, and can lead to early
death.1 Hemochromatosis is one of the
most common autosomal recessive dis-
ordersamongwhitesintheUnitedStates.
The estimated prevalence is between 1
in200and1in500individualsinscreen-
ing studies conducted among patients in
primary care settings, employed indi-
viduals, blood donors, and other groups
inwhichcasedefinitionsarebasedonel-
evated levels of iron.2 A presumptive di-
agnosis of hemochromatosis is based on
elevatedfastingtransferrinsaturationlev-
els.3 When predisposition to iron over-
load is identified early in the course of
disease, organ failure can be prevented
by periodic phlebotomy.4

Context Population-based estimates of the prevalence of disease-associated muta-
tions, such as hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations, are needed to determine the
usefulness of genetic screening.
Objective To estimate the prevalence of the HFE mutations C282Y and H63D in
the US population.
Design Cross-sectional population-based study of samples in the DNA bank from
phase 2 of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted from
1992 to 1994.
Setting and Participants Genotyped samples of cells from a total of 5171 partici-
pants, cross-classified by sex, age, and race/ethnicity in the analysis.
Main Outcome Measures Estimates of the prevalence of C282Y and H63D mu-
tations.
Results The prevalence of C282Y homozygosity is estimated to be 0.26% (95% con-
fidence interval [CI], 0.12%-0.49%); 1.89% (95% CI, 1.48%-2.43%) for H63D ho-
mozygosity; and 1.97% (95% CI, 1.54%-2.49%) for compound heterozygosity. The
prevalence estimates for C282Y heterozygosity (C282Y/wild type) are 9.54% among
non-Hispanic whites, 2.33% among non-Hispanic blacks, and 2.75% among Mexican-
Americans. The prevalence estimates of the C282Y mutation in the US population are
5.4% (95% CI, 4.7%-6.2%) and 13.5% (95% CI, 12.5%-14.8%) for the H63D mu-
tation.
Conclusions Estimates of prevalence of HFE mutations are within the expected range
for non-Hispanic whites and blacks but the estimated prevalence of the C282Y mu-
tation among Mexican-Americans is less than expected. Mutation data now need to
be linked to clinically relevant indices, such as transferrin saturation level.

No study has provided a true esti-
mate of the prevalence of the 2 muta-
tions within the US population. Previ-
ous prevalence estimates were derived
from small, nonrepresentative US
samples, such as employed individu-
als (n=1653), or individuals recruited
as control subjects in studies compar-
ing them with patients with hemochro-
matosis (sample sizes ranged from
142-384).4,8,16,19 In addition, none of
these studies included a large sample
of individuals from minority groups.
To obtain an estimate of the preva-
lence of the C282Y and H63D muta-
tions in the US population, we geno-
typed 5171 specimens from a nationally
representative sample derived from the
Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III)
DNA bank.20 We then examined the
prevalence of the 2 mutations by race/
ethnicity, sex, and age. Ours is the first
study using this nationally representa-
tive sample to estimate the prevalence
of disease-associated mutations.
METHODS
Survey Design and Participants
NHANES is a series of national surveys
that the National Center for Health Sta-
tisticsbeganconductingin1966.Among
its several objectives, NHANES data are
used to estimate the national preva-
lence of common diseases and risk fac-
tors for those diseases in the US popu-
lation.AspartofNHANESIII,whichwas
conducted in 2 phases from 1988
through1994,21,22 certainpopulations,in-
cluding non-Hispanic blacks and Mexi-
can Americans, were oversampled. Both
phase 1 and phase 2 were nationally rep-
resentative. Prevalence estimates were
weighted to account for oversampling
and nonresponse to the household in-
terview and the examination.
Cell lines from 8205 participants in
phase 2 of NHANES III (1992-1994)
were immortalized with Epstein-Barr vi-
rus. Although the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention planned to col-
lect DNA for storage, the decision to es-
tablish cell lines occurred after phase 1
had already begun. Overall, 15946 in-
dividualsaged12yearsorolder(whodid
notlist"other"asrace/ethnicity)werese-
lectedaspartofphase2.Atotalof13012
(81.6%) were interviewed, 11960
(75.2%) were examined, and cell lines
were available for 8205 (69%) of exam-
ined individuals. All estimates are
weighted to represent the total US popu-
lation and to account for oversampling
and nonresponse to the household in-
terview and physical examination. The
sample for genotyping included phase 2
participants who were 12 years or older,
whowerenotpregnant,andwhodidnot
have"other"listedforrace/ethnicity.Be-
cause this sample was also used to study
associations between total iron-binding
capacity(transferrinsaturation)leveland
HFE genotype (a study still in progress),
we excluded participants for whom
transferrin values were missing (3.7%).
Serumironandserumferritinlevelswere
also obtained (in addition to transferrin
saturation levels, these data are not re-
ported herein). To ensure that previ-
ously masked specimens, which had
been given new identification num-
bers, remained anonymous (ie, no one
could link an HFE genotype to a per-
sonal identifier in the full NHANES data
set), it was necessary to guarantee that
nofewerthan5individualshadthesame
set of background characteristics (age,
sex,race/ethnicity).Thesecommonchar-
acteristicsconstitutedasamplingcell.Of
the individuals within a sampling cell
who did have a common set of back-
ground characteristics, we randomly
eliminated 20% or 2 of the subjects,
whichever number was larger. Two ad-
ditional specimens could not be ampli-
fied for genotyping, making the final
sample size 5171.
An institutional review board at the
National Center for Health Statistics ap-
proved the survey as well as the specific
analysis done for this report. All partici-
pants gave written informed consent for
the survey. Principles involved in con-
sideration of research on the samples are
represented in a previous publication.23
The specimens were masked, irrevoca-
bly destroying the ability to link HFE
genotype to individual participants, be-
cause informed consent did not ex-
pressly mention genetic studies (at the
time the survey was planned, there were
no specific tests planned that could be
described to participants and the insti-
tutional review board felt that a discus-
sion of DNA would not be helpful to
participants). Also, the penetrance and
clinical significance of HFE mutations
have yet to be established. Finally, study
participants were made aware of abnor-
malities in results of testing (all partici-
pants in NHANES III were notified re-
garding serum ferritin levels, although
it is possible that they could have had
HFE mutations without altered iron
indices).
Genotyping Methods
Specimens were genotyped in the Mo-
lecular Biology Branch of the Division
of Laboratory Sciences, National Cen-
ter for Environmental Health, Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, us-
ing genomic DNA extracted from Ep-
stein-Barr virus­transformed cell lines.

The wild type (WT) and C282Y and
H63D mutations were genotyped us-
ing TaqMan technology24-26 in which
amplification and genotyping are si-
multaneously performed using the ABI
PRISM 7700 (Applied Biosystems, Fos-
ter City, Calif).
Separate polymerase chain reac-
tions were performed for C282Y and
H63D sites using primers and probes
that were designed using Primer Ex-
press (Applied Biosystems) based on
published sequences. The H63D site
sequences used were as follows: for-
ward primer, 5TCTTTCCTTGTTT-

Discrimination between alleles was
accomplished by running allelic dis-
crimination using ABI PRISM 7700, fol-
lowing the manufacturer's protocol. In
addition, all allele calls were con-
firmed by visual inspection of the re-
sults of the multicomponent analysis of
the real-time polymerase chain reac-
tion. We randomly selected approxi-
mately 5% of the specimens for geno-
type confirmation using the restriction
fragment-length polymorphism method
described by Lynas.27 In addition, we
confirmed all samples with the C282Y/
C282Y genotype. Genotype calls, as de-
termined by the restriction fragment-
length polymorphism method, were
100% concordant with genotype calls
obtained by TaqMan polymerase chain
reaction analysis.
Statistical Analysis
NHANES III was designed so that both
phase 1 and phase 2 would be national
probability samples. Prevalence esti-
mates are weighted to give an estimate
representing the US population.22
Weightingaccountsforoversamplingof
non-HispanicblackandMexicanAmeri-
can populations, probability of selec-
tion,noncoverage,andnonresponse.For
each sample cell, we determined aver-
age weights and assigned them to each
individual in that cell. The average
weights were used to calculate the
weightedprevalenceestimatesusingSAS
software(SASInstituteInc,Cary,NC).28
Wecomputedweightedprevalenceesti-
mates of HFE mutations in the popula-
tionbydeterminingtheappropriatefunc-
tions that relate allele frequency to
genotype frequencies and then apply-
ingtheaverageweights,asbefore,using
SAS. For example, to compute the
weighted prevalence estimate for the
C282Y mutation, we determined the
weightedestimateofthevariableC282Y
using the following definitions: C282Y
= (2  C282_HO + C282_HE +
C282_H6)/2 in which C282_HO is the
NHANES III variable corresponding to
the homozygous C282Y/C282Y geno-
type, C282_HE is the variable corre-
spondingtotheheterozygousC282Y/WT
genotype, and C282_H6 is the variable
correspondingtothecompoundhetero-
zygous C282Y/H63D genotype.
We were unable to calculate SEs ac-
counting for the complex sample de-
sign because anonymity requirements
prevented access to cluster variables.
Therefore, to account for the complex
sampling design, we used the bino-
mial distribution to construct approxi-
mate CIs for the weighted estimates us-
ing sample sizes determined by dividing
actual sample sizes by an assumed de-
sign effect of 1.5. In reality, the design
effect for this analysis may be lower or
higher than 1.5. Random selection
within strata, for example, tends to
lower the design effect.29
Using an average design effect of 1.5,
we found that genotypes from 2454 par-
ticipants would be required to ensure
80% power to estimate a mean (SE)
prevalence of 0.4% (0.2%), which was
the expected prevalence of homozygos-
ity. At least 354 participants would be
needed to estimate a 10% (2.5%) preva-
lence, which was the expected preva-
lence of C282Y/WT heterozygosity.
We randomly selected 5171 speci-
mens for study from participant cells
cross-classified by sex, age, race/
ethnicity, and transferrin saturation
level. When weighted properly, these
specimens should be representative of
the US population.
RESULTS
Based on our results, homozygosity for
the C282Y mutation was estimated to
occur in 0.26% (95% CI, 0.12%-0.49%)
of the total US population, and com-
poundheterozygosity(C282Y/H63D)in
approximately 2% (TABLE 1). Among
WTheterozygousgenotypes(C282Y/WT
andH63D/WT),thegenotypeH63D/WT
was about 2.5-fold more common than
the genotype C282Y/WT. Homozygos-
ity for the H63D mutation was esti-
matedtooccurin1.89%(95%CI,1.48%-
2.43%) of the total US population.
When we estimated prevalence of
genotypes by ethnic group, we found
that the estimate for the C282Y/
C282Y genotype was 5- to 10-fold
higher in non-Hispanic whites than in
Mexican Americans or non-Hispanic
blacks (Table 1). The CIs for preva-
lence estimates for C282Y/C282Y over-
lapped among the 3 groups, but the es-
timates were made on the basis of only
1 person each in the Mexican Ameri-
can and non-Hispanic black groups.
The estimated prevalence for the H63D/
H63D genotype was highest among
non-Hispanic whites and lowest among
non-Hispanic blacks, with estimates for
Mexican Americans falling between the
2 previous groups. However, differ-
ences among the groups were statisti-
cally significant only between non-
Hispanic blacks and non-Hispanic
whites. Prevalence estimates for com-
pound heterozygotes (C282Y/H63D)
were also significantly higher for non-
Hispanic whites than for the other
groups. Although the C282Y/WT geno-
type was estimated to be significantly
more common in non-Hispanic whites
than in other groups, non-Hispanic
whites and Mexican Americans had
similar prevalence estimates for the
H63D/WT genotype, and both of these
groups had significantly higher preva-

non-Hispanic blacks.
Calculations using these genotype
frequency data indicated that the C282Y
mutation is estimated to be present in
5.4% of the total US population and the
H63D mutation in 13.5% (TABLE 2).
These percentages are slightly higher
when data from the non-Hispanic white
population are used in separate calcu-
lations.

prevalence estimates for genotypes be-
tween men and women when ethnic
groups were combined (TABLE 3). For
all genotypes, CIs around the estimates
for men and women overlapped. Al-
though there were generally no differ-
ences in prevalence of genotype by age,

ber of individuals, as only 3 individuals
younger than 60 years had the C282Y/
C282Y genotype (TABLE 4).
COMMENT
We evaluated the prevalence of the
C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE
gene in a representative sample of the
US population. These estimates are de-
rived from a nationally representative
sample of sufficient size to provide
powerforamorepreciseestimateofmu-
tations associated with HH. Data from
NHANES III indicate that the esti-
mated prevalence of the C282Y/C282Y
genotype, which is associated with 50%
to 100% of HH in the US population of
European descent,5,9-13 is 0.26% or ap-
proximately 1 in 385 individuals. This
frequencylevelfallswithinpublishedes-
timates of between 1 in 200 and 1 in 500
individuals and translates into approxi-
mately 718000 individuals who are ho-
mozygousfortheC282Ymutationinthe
United States.2 Prevalence estimates
for all other genotypes among non-
Hispanicwhitesweresimilartothosere-
ported in other studies that genotyped
large samples from populations of Eu-
ropean descent (TABLE 5). It is reason-
able to assume that the group of
NHANES III participants who identi-
fied themselves as non-Hispanic white
is likely to represent many individuals
of European descent.
Although NHANES was not de-
signed to estimate the prevalence of rare
genotypes, this population did offer a
sample of sufficient size to provide
power to estimate prevalence for both
the C282Y and H63D mutations. How-
ever, the power to estimate prevalence
of homozygosity for the C282Y muta-
tion with precision was sufficient only
for the total population of 5171 par-
ticipants. We compared demographic
variables of race/ethnicity, sex, and age

between the original sample of 8502
and our final sample of 5171 and found
no significant differences, thus indicat-
ing that the sample of 5171 was not
biased.
The largest and most recent esti-
mates of genotype and allele frequen-
cies by ethnic group32 were reported
from a study of 10198 adult members
of a California health maintenance or-
ganization. Although this was not a
population-based sample, estimates of
genotype prevalences were similar to
those reported in our analysis for non-
Hispanic whites (Table 5) and the same
was true for the C282Y and H63D mu-
tation frequencies. Small differences be-
tween our estimates and those from the
California study for mutation frequen-
cies among Hispanics (C282Y: 2.7%;
H63D: 12.4%)32 and blacks (C282Y:
1.1%; H63D: 5.1%)32 may have been
due to the small numbers of muta-
tions found in those groups. How-
ever, the California study did not re-
port CIs, so the significance of those
differences could not be determined.
Prevalence estimates for the
C282Y/WT genotype were between 9%
and 13% in other studies.17,18,30-33 We

PREVALENCE OF C282Y AND H63D MUTATIONS

found a slightly lower prevalence of
8.33% in the general population and
9.54% in the population who is pre-
sumably of European descent. Others
have estimated the prevalence of the
C282Y/WT genotype to be approxi-
mately 2% in black populations32,33; our
estimate was 2.3% in non-Hispanic
blacks. Because the C282Y mutation has
not been demonstrated in African popu-
lations,34-36 haplotype analysis is likely
to show that the C282Y mutation found
in blacks is the result of admixture with
the white population, as is the case for
C282Y mutations found in Chinese, Pa-
cific Islander, and Australian aborigi-
nal populations.37
The frequency of the C282Y/WT
genotype in a group of Spanish blood
donors was estimated to be 4.1%,13 simi-
lar to the 3.7% for Hispanics in Cali-
fornia,32 but slightly higher than the
2.7% (95% CI, 1.89%-3.99%) found in
our analysis of Mexican Americans. In
a previous study, researchers found no
C282Y mutations in a study of 54 chro-
mosomes from Mexican individuals,
but found a frequency of 3.2% in a study
of 78 chromosomes from Spanish
individuals.34 That was not a popula-
tion-based study, thus the representa-
tiveness of the data from the 54 chromo-
somes regarding genetic characteristics
of the general population is unknown.
It is possible that, due to population ad-
mixture, the prevalence of C282Y is
lower among individuals of Mexican
origin than among individuals of Span-
ish origin. Seemingly contrary to this
finding, a study based on California
health maintenance organization data
indicated that phenotypic expression of
hemochromatosis was as frequent
among Hispanics as among non-
Hispanic whites.38 Additionally, among
Mexican Americans, the prevalence of
elevated transferrin saturation levels, a
phenotypic indicator of hemochroma-
tosis, was similar to or slightly less than
that found among non-Hispanic
whites.39 Hence, it is possible that an-
other yet undiscovered mutation ex-
ists that may explain phenotypic ex-
pression of hemochromatosis in
Mexican American populations. How-
ever, the association of the C282Y mu-
tation with hemochromatosis among
Mexican Americans has not been re-
ported.
The frequency of the H63D muta-
tion among non-Hispanic whites and
Mexican Americans is similar to pre-
viously reported frequencies of be-
tween 6% and 30% in European popu-
lations and a mean (SE) of 6.6% (4.7%)
found in Mexican populations.32,34 The
frequency of this mutation among non-
Hispanic blacks, present at a low fre-
quency in sub-Saharan African popu-
lations, is probably the result of
population admixture.32,35,36
Because mutations accounting for a
large proportion of HH have been iden-
tified, and because expression of the dis-
ease is preventable, the question of
screening healthy populations for HH
using genetic testing has arisen. Ex-
perts recently reviewed the implica-
tions of screening for these common
mutations and concluded that popula-
tion-based screening for HH is not ap-
propriate because the prevalence and
penetrance of HFE mutations and the
optimal care of asymptomatic individu-
als who have the mutations are un-
known.9 Information presented here
representsthefirstnational,population-
based prevalence estimate, thereby add-
ing an important piece of the puzzle
needed for making policy decisions
about screening.
These findings have implications for
use of genetic tests for HH screening.
Information on prevalence of the mu-
tations among ethnic groups is impor-
tant for targeted screening when ap-
propriate. However, if the prevalence
for the homozygous genotype that has
been associated with expression of dis-
ease is higher than the rate of the dis-
ease, that is, if penetrance of the ge-
netic mutations is low, then the positive
predictive value of the relevant ge-
netic test may be low.
Results of our study suggest that the
prevalence of homozygosity for C282Y
among non-Hispanic whites and for the
total US population may not be equiva-
lent to (because of penetrance, for ex-
ample) but may parallel the preva-
lence of hemochromatosis as defined by
elevated serum iron levels.16,40 We need
additional information about other ge-
netic and environmental factors affect-
ing expression of hemochromatosis-
associated mutations. We also need
to identify new hemochromatosis-
associated mutations in populations not
of European descent, such as Mexican
Americans and non-Hispanic blacks,
to fully understand this relatively com-
mon and treatable genetic disorder.
Finally, an important step in under-
standing the public health signifi-
cance of HFE mutations will be to re-
late these mutations to clinically
relevant information, such as transfer-
rin saturation levels.41 An analysis of the
relationship between measures of trans-
ferrin saturation level and HFE muta-
tions in the NHANES III population is
in progress.
