Environmental Press and Adaptation to Disability
in Hospitalized Live-Alone Older Adults
Peter A. Lichtenberg, PhD, ABPP,1 Susan E. MacNeill, PhD, ABPP,2
and Benjamin T. Mast, MA3
Purpose: This study examined the ability of personal
competency variables at the time of hospital discharge to
predict primary instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs)
and secondary outcomes (living arrangements) in a sample of
194 urban, live-alone, older adults who had a new onset
disability. Design and Methods: Consecutively admitted
medical rehabilitation patients, 72% women and 85% African
American, participated in the study. Using path analysis, three
of the four competency variables collected at the time of
hospitalization (cognition, medical burden, activities of daily
living) predicted IADLs at 3 and 6 months after hospitaliza-
tion (e.g., cooking, telephone use, money management).
IADLs, in turn, predicted living arrangements at 3 and at 6
months after hospitalization. Results: The findings provided
strong support for the importance of assessing a broad range
of competency variables when investigating adaptation to
disability. Implications: The increased understanding of ad-
aptation in live-alone older adults with a new-onset disability
is particularly timely given the increase in live-alone older
adults and the dire consequences associated with change in
living arrangement (i.e., mortality and morbidity) in this group.
Key Words: Activities of daily living, Cognitive functioning,
Live-alone elders, Rehabilitation
This study focused on the ability of a broad range
of personal competencies, assessed at the time of
hospital discharge, to predict functional and living
arrangement outcomes 3 and 6 months after hospital-
ization for a new onset disability. The choice of which
personal competency variables to measure was guided
by Lawton's environmental press theory (Lawton,
1983). We were unable to collect all of the types of
data necessary to test fully Lawton's theory (i.e. envi-
ronmental variables); therefore, this investigation should
be viewed as a partial test of Lawton's theory. The
personal competencies component of Lawton's model
was tested in a group of elders who experienced a
new onset disability and consequently entered a
medical rehabilitation facility for treatment. The impact
of participants' competencies at the time of hospital-
ization was linked to functional abilities (instrumental
activities of daily living; IADLs) as a primary outcome;
and living arrangement as a secondary outcome 3
and 6 months after hospitalization.
Theory of Environmental Press
Lawton, (Lawton, Brody, & Turner-Massey, 1978,
and Lawton, 1983, 1985) presented to the gerontology
field a theoretical framework for understanding adap-
tation to the environment in older persons. The envi-
ronmental press theory is a theory of adaptation that
focuses on person variables (competencies), environ-
mental variables (environmental press), and the interac-
tion between the two variables. Competencies include
physical and functional health, cognitive and affective
functioning, and quality of life, including sense of ef-
ficacy or mastery. Environmental press variables in-
clude the person's home environment, their social
environment, and even their neighborhood environ-
ment. The fit between a person's level of competencies
and the demands from their environment affect how
well an individual is functioning. In the case of being
hospitalized for a disability, adaptation may be mea-
sured by both basic functional abilities as well as the
ability to resume living independently.
Lawton (1985) also recognized and stated clearly
that declining functional competencies would also
affect environmental press. Morgan and associates
(1984) reported findings that partially supported this
contention. Less competent individuals demonstrated
higher scores on an index of environmental press.
The research presented below is salient to the current
thrust of research initiatives that are focused on de-
clines in functional health and how well older persons
can adapt to their home environment (Gill, Robison,
Williams, and Tinetti 1999; Miller et al., 1999). Live-
alone elders constitute an appropriate group to test
and enhance the utility of the environmental press
theory, because living alone is becoming a more nor-
mative part of the aging process. Gerontological re-
searchers and practitioners are seeking to deepen their
understanding of the process of resuming independent

living after hospitalization for a new onset disability.
For older adults living alone, their individual compe-
tencies are likely to determine how well they adapt
to disability, both in terms of functional activities and
living arrangements.
Live-Alone Elders in American Society
Living alone is a growing phenomenon among older
adults, particularly among the older old of the U.S. so-
ciety. Whereas in 1960 20% of adults over age 65
lived alone, by 1980 the rate of older adults living
alone grew to 28%, and by 1990 the rate stood at 37%,
or 8.9 million older Americans (Krivo & Mutchler,
1989; Mui & Burnette, 1994). The growth of the live-
alone population is further highlighted by the fact that
over 1 million or 47% of those over age 85 live alone,
and this group is the most rapidly growing population
of older adults (Mui & Burnette, 1994). To date, living
alone has either been characterized in the literature as
an indicator of robust health or conversely as an indi-
cator of extreme frailty, and the study of this group has
lacked a general theoretical framework.
Researchers have pointed to live-alone elders as ag-
ing successfully. Mui and Burnette (1994), utilizing the
National Long Term Care Channeling Demonstration
project, compared live-alone older adults with those
who did not live alone. Eighty percent of those living
alone were women. The results pointed to an opti-
mistic view of living alone, as those living alone were
better educated, had fewer medical problems, had
fewer hospitalizations, had fewer ADL (activities of
daily living) and IADL (instrumental activities of daily
living) problems, and had less cognitive impairment
than those who did not live alone. Despite their robust
health, however, those living alone tended to report
increased levels of depression and more environmental
hazards (i.e., problems with home safety and mainte-
nance) than did those who lived with others.
Other research has characterized living alone as
an indicator of frailty. Living alone has been signifi-
cantly correlated with frailty among older adults re-
ceiving emergency medical services (EMS). Gurley,
Lum, Sande, Lo, and Katz (1996) investigated the ef-
fects of living alone on being found helpless or dead
by paramedics. A total of 387 individuals who lived
alone were found helpless in their homes during a
12-week period. The authors concluded that the
older old (those over age 75) who lived alone are at
greater risk of losing not only their physical indepen-
dence but also their lives.
Frailty combined with older age, exacerbation of
chronic medical conditions, or the onset of new medi-
cal crises characterize a subgroup of older adults who
are at a relatively high risk for losing independence.
Pearlman and Crown (1992), utilizing the National
Long Term Care survey data, found that older adults
who entered a nursing home were more likely to be
old-old, living alone, and having had a prior nursing
home stay. Rudberg, Sager, and Zhang (1996) re-
ported on risk factors for institutionalization following
hospitalization on 1,265 individuals from five hospi-
tals participating in the Hospital Outcomes Project
for the Elderly. Thirty-eight percent of the sample were
living alone at the time of hospitalization. Overall, 7%
of respondents were placed in a nursing home and
remained there after 3 months. Increased age and living
alone prior to admission were predictors of nursing
home placement.
Hospitalized live-alone elders appear to represent
a group at higher risk for new onset of disabilities.
Pompei and associates (1994) reported that delirious
patients were more likely to live alone and have evi-
dence of depression and alcohol abuse.
Research reports have consistently reported a signif-
icant relationship between declining functional and
cognitive abilities and change in living arrangement.
Worobey and Angel (1990) investigated the impact of
physical decline on living alone in older adults. Using
the Longitudinal Study of Aging, a national sample of
2,500 older adults, 66% of whom were living alone,
was surveyed in 1984 and recontacted 2 years later.
Increased functional incapacity was related to greater
tendency to live with others. Similar conclusions were
reported by Miller and colleagues (1999), who used
6 years of data from the Longitudinal Study of Aging
for their analyses of community-based moves. Deteri-
oration of advanced ADLs and poorer lower body
strength were significant predictors of a community-
based residential move. These authors specifically
advocated for the inclusion of change in residence as
a health outcome indication.
Other investigators have looked at changes in resi-
dence following hospitalization in live-alone elders.
Friedman (1995) presented one of the few studies
that investigated the long-term outcome of older
stroke patients who lived alone prior to their stroke.
At discharge from the hospital, only 33% returned to
living alone; 44% of these patients were placed in an
institution. At one year, those survivors who were in-
stitutionalized rose to 52%.
The primary shortcoming of the literature concerning
live-alone elders to date is the absence of theory to
guide the research. In the literature reviewed above,
living alone is treated as an independent predictor of a
variety of outcomes (e.g., ADLs, IADLs, living arrange-
ments). This is entirely consistent with an empirical
approach to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes.
Living alone has been a significant risk factor of several
health outcomes, including delirium and mortality,
but often this finding has been inconsistent, and/or me-
diated by several other variables such as poverty, gen-
der, cognition, and ADLs. In other studies, living
alone has been used as a predictor of optimal adapta-
tion for some people (i.e., high functioning at baseline)
and a predictor of least desirable adaptation for others
(i.e., low functioning at baseline; see Sarwari, Fred-
man, Langenberg, and Magaziner, 1998). Living
alone has suddenly become a significant predictor
variable in gerontological studies, but one with little or
no explanatory power. By using the theory of envi-
ronmental press to guide our research, we can better
understand adaptation in live-alone elders who have
suffered a new onset disability. The goal of this study
551
Vol. 40, No. 5, 2000
was to examine several competency variables in rela-
tion to functional abilities and living arrangements 3
and 6 months after hospitalization. These included
cognition, depression, medical burden, and functional
abilities.
Competency Variables Related to Adaptation
Cognitive Functioning.--Measures of cognitive func-
tioning reflect the integrity of the brain and the ability
to avoid disability. Epidemiological studies repeat-
edly identify cognition as one of the significant pre-
dictors of disability onset (Gill, Williams, Richardson,
& Tinetti, 1996; Miller et al., 1999; Sarwari et al.,
1998). Cognitive functioning has also been linked to
ADL recovery in hospitalized older adults (Hansen,
Mahoney, & Palta, 1999) and to change in living ar-
rangements in live-alone elders. Decreased cognitive
functioning may represent one of the more important
person variables that leads live-alone older adults to
become more dependent. Five studies of live-alone
hospitalized elders (Friedman, 1995; Pearlman &
Crown, 1992; Pompei et al., 1994; Rockwood, Stolee,
& McDowell, 1996; Zureik et al., 1995) found cogni-
tive functioning to be an independent predictor of
living arrangements after discharge and delirium dur-
ing hospitalization. Cognitive decline may represent
both a loss of skills necessary for independence as
well as a marker for progressive brain disease.
Depression.--Depression is also a predictor of
physical recovery from illness (Mossey, Mutran,
Knott & Craig, 1989). Recent evidence also suggests
that depression precedes disability onset in many
older adults. Livingston, Seeman, Merrill, and Blazer
(1994) used community-based cohorts from the Na-
tional Institute on Aging's Established Populations for
Epidemiological Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) to fol-
low 1,189 older adults. The cohort was interviewed
in 1988 and again approximately 2.5 years later. Ini-
tially, all subjects were independent in all ADLs. At
the second interview, 5.7% of men and 4.1% of
women reported ADL disabilities. For both men and
women, when controlling for other medical factors,
the presence of depression at time 1 emerged as a
significant predictor of disability onset. Increased lev-
els of depression have also been found in those el-
ders who live alone (Mui & Burnette, 1994).
Medical Burden.--Medical burden refers to the
collective impact of one or more chronic medical
diseases. The severity of comorbid medical disease
may play an important role in the ability to maintain
independence among live-alone older adults. Mos-
sey and colleagues (1989) described typical medical
comorbidities among hospitalized older adults. In
their sample the mean number of health conditions
was 3.5, with 60% of the sample having coronary ar-
tery disease, 53% hypertension, 51% osteoporosis
and 46% degenerative joint disease. Medical burden
may exert its effects on independence indirectly
through functional abilities. Moore and Lichtenberg
(1996) presented a double cross-validation study that
indicated a significant relationship between medical
burden and functional abilities. Similarly, Pearlman
and Crown (1992) found that medical burden was
not directly related to institutionalization but, rather,
was related to functional abilities.
Functional Abilities: ADLs and IADLs
Lawton (1983), in his Kleemeier award lecture, de-
fined ADL and IADL abilities as the most basic com-
petencies in gerontology. In research reviewed above
(Gill et al., 1996; Miller et al., 1999), functional abil-
ities are demonstrated to be central to adaptation in
older age and to stability of residence. Sawari and
colleagues (1998) demonstrated that older live-alone
women who report poor functional health at baseline
were the most likely to experience significant decline
in functional health relative to women who lived
with others. Recently, Dunlop, Hughes, and Man-
heim (1997) used longitudinal data to document the
hierarchy of ADL disability. Walking, bathing, and
transferring were the first ADL abilities to decline, fol-
lowed by dressing, toileting, and feeding.
Aims of the Study
Because of limitations in resources, this investiga-
tion could only test how well competency variables
predicted adaptation. We were not able to include
environmental hazard variables in this study. Three
hypotheses were derived, and they are focused on
the prediction of primary outcome (IADLs) and sec-
ondary outcome (living arrangement) measures.
· Hypothesis 1: The competency variables of cogni-
tion, depression, medical burden, and performance-
based ADLs at discharge from the hospital will
predict the primary functional outcome of self-
reported IADLs at 3 and 6 months following hospi-
talization.
· Hypothesis 2: The competency variables of cogni-
tion, depression, medical burden, and performance-
based ADLS during hospitalization will predict
living arrangement at 3 and 6 months following
hospitalization.
· Hypothesis 3: The relationship between personal
competency variables and living arrangement will
be mediated by self-reported IADLs that will directly
predict living arrangements at those time periods.
Methods
Participants
Participants were consecutive admissions to a free-
standing midwestern university-based urban medical
rehabilitation hospital who were over the age of 60,
living alone prior to admission, and who agreed to
participate in an interview and testing session at or
near discharge. Face-to-face data were collected at
baseline during hospitalization, and follow-up data
were collected by telephone interviews. Of 219 eligi-
552 The Gerontologist
ble individuals, 194 agreed to participate in the
study, making an 87% participation rate. Only age
and gender were collected for the nonparticipating
group, and these variables did not differ from the par-
ticipating group. Competency variables collected
included medical burden (Comorbidity Index),
performance-based ADLs (Functional Independence
Measure), cognition (Dementia Rating Scale), depres-
sion (Geriatric Depression Scale), and self-reported
ADLs and IADLs (Lawton & Brody, 1969). Mean age
of the sample was 74 years, with 72% women and
85% African American; the group had a mean 11
years of education. Principal rehabilitation diagnoses
included arthritic problems (28%, n  55), stroke
(21%, n  41), lower extremity fracture (16%, n 
31), gait abnormalities (13%, n  26), and circula-
tory system problems (7%, n  13); the rest were a
range of conditions (e.g., endocrine disorders, neo-
plasms, spinal cord injury; 14%, n  28). In terms of
complete data collection (living arrangements plus
competency variables) there were 194 at baseline,
131 at time 2, and 118 at time 3. Incomplete data
were due to mortality (n  21), a significant illness (n 
16) that precluded the telephone interview, signifi-
cant cognitive dysfunction (n  12), those lost to fol-
low-up (n  17), and refusals (n  10). Table 1 com-
pares the characteristics of those who had complete
data with those who did not have complete data. The
patients who had complete data at all three time
points scored significantly higher on the Mattis De-
mentia Rating Scale (Mattis, 1988) and had less im-
pairment on the Functional Independence Measure
at discharge, a performance-based measure of ADLs.
there were no differences by age, gender, race, edu-
cation, comorbid medical illness, or level of depres-
sive symptoms.
Measures
Primary Outcome Variable: Self-reported IADLs.--
Self-report of advanced self-care skills was assessed
using the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale
(Lawton & Brody, 1969), which examines patient
perceptions in the following domains: money man-
agement, telephone use, medication management,
and basic cooking. A total advanced self-care index
is calculated by summing scores on the subscales for
each participant, with a total possible score ranging
from zero (reporting total impairment) to 40 (report-
ing completely intact abilities).
Secondary Outcome Variable: Living Arrange-
ment.--Miller and colleagues (1999) have specifi-
cally called for categorical classification of living sit-
uation as either remaining living alone or changing
living arrangement to not alone. We therefore mea-
sured living arrangement in a dichotomous fashion
(alone vs not alone).
Predictor Measures
Cognition.--The Dementia Rating Scale (DRS) was
created for use with demented individuals and evalu-
ates domains including attention, initiation, memory,
abstract reasoning, and visuospatial construction (Mat-
tis, 1988). The DRS takes 20­45 minutes to adminis-
ter depending upon the patient's level of cognitive
functioning. The DRS has been found to have excel-
lent test­retest reliability (r  .97) and split-half reli-
ability (r  .90; Coblentz et al., 1973; Gardner, Ol-
iver-Munoz, Fisher, & Empting, 1981). Concurrent
validity is also satisfactory, with a significant correla-
tion between the total DRS score and WAIS IQ score
(r  .75, Mattis, 1988). Vangel and Lichtenberg
(1995) demonstrated that use of the DRS in cogni-
tively intact urban older adults was useful for clinical
and research purposes. Results from samples of
highly literate and educated older adults found the
DRS to have a ceiling effect (Mattis, 1988). Vangel
and Lichtenberg, in contrast, found the scores on the
DRS not to display a ceiling effect in urban older
adults, like due to lower levels of education. Indeed,
Lichtenberg (1998) reported that many commonly
used neuropsychological tests are more likely to have
floor effects when used with less educated, urban
older adults. Bank, Yochim, MacNeill, and Lichten-
berg (in press) have just finalized new age, and edu-
cation-corrected norms for the DRS in older cogni-
tively intact urban elders.
Depression.--This was assessed using the Geriat-
ric Depression Scale (GDS; Yesavage et al., 1983).
[The original GDS was developed for assessment
with geriatric populations, and is composed of 30
yes/no self-referent statements, and has well docu-
mented reliability and validity (Lichtenberg, 1998;
Rapp, Parisi, & Walsh,1998).] Past studies support

the use of the GDS with medically ill and mild to
moderate cognitively impaired older adults (Lich-
tenberg, Marcopulos, Steiner, & Tabscott, 1992;
Parmelee, Katz, & Lawton, 1989; Rapp et al., 1988).
Medical Burden.--The comorbidity Index (CMI;
Charlson, Pompei, Ales, & MacKenzie, 1987) was
originally created for use in predicting mortality. Our
own research (Moore & Lichtenberg, 1996), and that
by the Health Care Financing Agency (Deyo, Cher-
kin, & Ciol, 1992), however, have found it to be a
valid and excellent predictor of morbidity and dis-
ability outcomes. One advantage of the CMI is that it
can be culled from medical record databases, thereby
reducing the load on physicians. The CMI is both
sensitive to severity of different diseases, and efficient
to collect. The index was originally developed by as-
certaining what combination of diagnoses best pre-
dicted 1 year mortality in a group of hospitalized
patients (Charlson, 1987). Diseases significantly asso-
ciated with mortality were identified and weights
equivalent to adjusted relative risks assigned. The in-
dex was validated on a cohort of 685 medical pa-
tients by predicting 1 year survival accounting for a
greater proportion of the deaths due to comorbid
conditions than a simple measure of number of coex-
isting conditions. The relationship of the CMI to dis-
ability was demonstrated in a double cross-validation
study in which the CMI was the best predictor of ADL
recovery in medical rehabilitation patients (Moore &
Lichtenberg, 1996). Recently, Arfken, Lichtenberg,
and Kuiken (1998) validated the CMI as a predictor of
mortality using older medical rehabilitation patients.
Performance-Based ADL Measure.--The Functional
Independence Measure (FIM) is a seven-point rating
scale created as part of the Uniform Data System for
Medical Rehabilitation (Linacre, Heinemann, Wright,
Granger, & Hamilton, 1994). The FIM is a perfor-
mance-based measure that was designed to assess
the ability to carry out ADLs, including dressing, toi-
leting, ambulation, and grooming. Each of 18 self-
care tasks is rated on a 7-point scale by a physical or
occupational therapist ranging from completely inde-
pendent (7) to completely dependent (1). The FIM
has been shown to have high inter-rater reliability,
with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.97 for
the total score (Hamilton, Laughlin, Granger, & Kay-
ton, 1991). Validity has also been demonstrated with
brain-injured patients and stroke patients (Cook, Smith,
& Truman, 1994; Granger, Cotter, Hamilton, & Fied-
ler, 1993). Rasch analysis has provided support for
two clinically different aspects of disability (Granger,
Hamilton, Linacre, Heinemann, & Wright, 1993; Lin-
acre et al., 1994). Thirteen self-care and locomotion
items measure motor disability, and five communica-
tion and cognition items measure cognitive disability.
Moore and Lichtenberg (1996) and Lichtenberg (1998)
demonstrated that a 7-item ADL scale can be used to
measure feeding, dressing, grooming, transferring,
and toileting.
Statistical Procedures
To test our hypotheses, a series of path models
were tested using AMOS 3.6 (Arbuckle, 1997). In
these models, the relationships between baseline
competency variables and primary (IADL function-
ing) and secondary (living situation) outcomes at 3
and 6 months following discharge were examined.
All models were estimated with maximum likelihood
estimation and controlled for the effects of race, age,
and education. In the first model, baseline compe-
tency variables were used to predict IADL function-
ing at 3 months (IADL3) and 6 months (IADL6) post-
discharge. Paths were estimated between each of the
competency variables and IADL functioning at 3 and
6 months. In addition, a stability path was estimated
between IADL3 and IADL6. Living situations at 3
months (Alone3) and 6 months (Alone6) were added
into the second path model. Because Alone3 and
Alone6 are dichotomous variables, the standard er-
rors for the coefficients involving these two variables
may be underestimated and result in spuriously sig-
nificant results. To correct for this potential problem,
we followed West and associates' (1995) suggestion
to adjust the significance level to a more conservative
level (p  .01, rather than .05).
Results
Overall, the participant group represented elders
who had higher rates of disability and higher rates of
service usage than many samples of community-dwell-
ing elders. At baseline, 77% of the sample reported
being fully independent with ADLs prior to hospital-
ization. This decreased to 59% at 3 months and 51%
at 6 months. In contrast, those reporting three or more
ADL limitations grew from 10% at baseline to 14% at
3 months and 17% at 6 months. Fifty-four percent of
the sample used community services at baseline, 58%
at 3 months, and 58% at 6 months (housekeeper,
transportation, church volunteers, and Meals on
Wheels). Return to living alone is a dynamic charac-
teristic that increased from 44% at baseline to 60% at
3 months, and to 70% at 6 months. Transitions back to
living alone occurred equally between those dis-
charged to nursing homes and those discharged to
families. Living with family decreased from 28% to
hospital discharge to 14% at 3 months to 11% at 6
months. Living at a nursing home decreased from 20%
at discharge to 11% at 3 months to 8% at 6 months.
A model was developed to test part of the environ-
mental press theory. Medical burden, cognition, de-
pression, and performance-based ADLs were only
collected at baseline, whereas self-reported func-
tional abilities were collected at 3 and 6 months. In
each of the models described below, age, education,
and race were statistically controlled. Age was signif-
icantly associated with DRS (­.305) and FIM (­.217).
Race was not significantly associated with DRS, CMI,
FIM, or GDS. Education was significantly related to
GDS (­.318) and DRS (.478).
As described above, in the first path, model base-
line competency variables were used to predict IADL
554 The Gerontologist
functioning at 3 months and 6 months postdischarge.
These analyses indicated that all four competency
variables were significant predictors of IADL3 (Betas:
CMI  ­.259; DRS  .244; FIM  .526; GDS  ­.146)
and IADL6 (Betas: CMI  ­.239; DRS  .250; FIM 
.512; GDS  ­.193). However, when the stability
path between IADL3 and IADL6 was included, the
predictive relationships between baseline competen-
cies and IADL6 were fully mediated by IADL3. The
best predictor of IADL6 was IADL3 (Betas  .784).
Living situations at 3 months (Alone3) and 6
months (Alone6) were added into the second path
model. In the initial form of this model, each of the
competency variables predicted IADL3 and Alone3
and Alone 6. As in the previous model, competency
variables significantly predicted IADL3. In addition,
IADL3 and IADL6 both were significant predictors of
the living situation at their respective time periods.
However, the competency variables did not add sub-
stantially to the prediction of living situation above
and beyond their indirect effects via IADL function-
ing, suggesting that the influence of competency vari-
ables upon living situation is mediated by IADL func-
tioning. This final model with significant coefficients
is pictured in Figure 1; demographic effects and error
elements (i.e., zeta's) are not pictured in order to sim-
plify the diagram. Each of the coefficients between
the competency variables and IADLs were signifi-
cantly less than p  .05 and, as described above, the
paths between IADL3 and Alone3 as well as IADL6
and Alone6 are significant beyond p  .01.
Discussion
In the present study only half of Lawton's model--
the competency variables--could be tested. The re-
sults, nevertheless, provide support for that part of the
theory in that each competency variable was directly
related to functional abilities at 3 and 6 months after
hospitalization. Futhermore, each competency vari-
able was indirectly related to living arrangement at
those time periods as well. Functional ability, charac-
terized by the IADL scale, acted as a mediator vari-
able between the competency variables (i.e., cogni-
tion, depression, medical burden, and ADLs), and
living arrangement.
Lawton's environmental press is the first theoreti-
cal framework to be applied to the understanding of
live-alone elders. In this study only the impact of
competency variables was assessed. One can specu-
late that these elders may be more vulnerable to the
impacts of disability because living alone requires
broad areas of competency. New onset disability--
coupled, perhaps, with increased medical problems
and regimens, as well as decreased cognitive func-
tioning and increased depression--makes it prohibi-
tive for some elders to return to their homes during
the first 6 months after hospitalization. The theory,
when fully tested, may also provide a framework for
gerontologists to understand older adults' successful
adaptation following medical rehabilitation. The re-
sults clearly emphasize the importance of a variety of
different competencies that are best understood within
an interdisciplinary context. Although medical and
nursing personnel may best understand chronic dis-
eases and their treatments, physical and occupational
therapists may have the best understanding of func-
tional abilities, and psychologists and social workers
may be best able to assess cognitive and affective
functioning. The results clearly support the importance
of these domains of competencies in determining ad-
aptation and both primary (functional abilities) and
secondary (living arrangements) health outcomes.
Generalizability of the findings from this study are
clearly limited. The study participants were predomi-
nantly urban African American elders who were hos-
pitalized for a medical rehabilitation disorder. Live-
alone African American elders are in some ways quite
distinct from European American live-alone elders.
Our sample, consistent with previous research, found
a higher level of childlessness in live-alone African
Americans than in European Americans (35% vs 7%).
The challenge of maintaining independence and
high quality of life is intensified in urban Black el-
ders, both because of the racial disparities that exist
in terms of disease prevalence and functional disabil-
ities, and because of the effects of poverty on envi-
ronmental variables. Clark (1997) presented evidence
indicating that disabilities were not only more preva-
lent in Black than in White elders (33% vs 22%), but
that racial disparities in disabilities had increased
37% from 1982 to 1989. Miller and associates (1996)
reported that inner city African American elders had
worsening health, more IADL difficulties, and more
days of restricted activities than did samples of White
elders. Older African American adults living in urban
areas have also been shown to experience more
health problems than did previous cohorts. For ex-
ample, Ford, Haug, Roy, Hones, and Folmar (1992)
found that increases in the number of African Ameri-

can older adults in a midwestern city contributed to a
decreased overall health of the 1987 cohort of older
adults versus the 1977 cohort. Of particular note
were higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, and the
number of older adults who had four or more chronic
health conditions. These same researchers also noted
the African Americans were at greater risk for the de-
velopment of mental health problems. Coward and
colleagues (1997) specifically investigated racial dif-
ferences in health of live-alone elders. Overall, Black
elders had poorer health on all five indicators used,
and the authors concluded that factors such as edu-
cation, poverty, and gender mediated this finding.
Living alone may exacerbate the risk of social iso-
lation in Black elders. Simonsick, Kasper, and Phillips
(1998) found that older African American women who
lived alone were at particular risk for home confine-
ment. Other researchers have specifically compared
the rate of residence change in Black versus White
live-alone elders. Older urban African American
adults who live alone are more likely to change their
living arrangements and to end up living with others
than are urban White older adults (Choi, 1991; Hays,
Fillenbaum, Gold, Shanley, & Blazer, 1995). Rubin-
stein, Kilbride, and Nagy (1992) documented that
33% of the African American older adults they stud-
ied lived alone, and that women represented 77% of
this group. Eighty-six percent of their sample pre-
ferred to live alone, and health problems were the
predominant reasons that living arrangements were
changed.
The present research findings serve to further in-
form gerontologists about older live-alone African
Americans. Given the extra challenges of poorer
health conditions, poverty and neighborhood deteri-
oration, the importance of broad-based assessments
that tap into all of the competencies discussed above
are heightened. The environmental press theoretical
framework holds great promise in its application to
the understanding of changing adaptation during
times of changing competencies. Future investiga-
tions should clearly measure all variables relevant to
theory, including home hazards, and the social envi-
ronment in which older adults live.
