Introduction
High spontaneous renin­angiotensin system (RAS) activity
in terms of high serum angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) activity is associated with a clinically significant
elevated risk of severe hypoglycaemia in type 1 diabetes.
This has consistently been shown in seven studies in five
different cohorts by four independent research groups.1­7

Abstract
Introduction: High spontaneous activity of the renin­angiotensin system (RAS) results in more pronounced cognitive
impairment and more prolonged QTc interval during hypoglycaemia in type 1 diabetes. We tested whether angiotensin
II receptor blockade improves cerebral and cardiovascular function during hypoglycaemia.
Methods: Nine patients with type 1 diabetes and high spontaneous RAS activity were included in a double-blind,
randomised, cross-over study on the effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonist (candesartan 32 mg) or placebo for one
week on cognitive function, cardiovascular parameters, hormonal counter-regulatory response, substrate mobilisation,
and symptoms during hypoglycaemia induced by two hyperinsulinaemic, hypoglycaemic clamps.
Results: Compared to placebo, candesartan did neither change performance of the cognitive tests nor the EEG at a plasma
glucose concentration of 2.6±0.2 mmol/l. During candesartan treatment, the QT interval in the ECG was not affected.
No effect of candesartan was observed in the hormonal counter-regulatory responses, in substrate concentrations, or in
symptom scores. A 36% reduced glucose infusion rate during hypoglycaemia with candesartan was observed.
Conclusion: In conclusion candesartan has no effect on cerebral function during mild experimental hypoglycaemia in
subjects with type 1 diabetes and high RAS activity. Candesartan may reduce glucose utilisation or increase endogenous
glucose production during hypoglycaemia.

One study reported an additive effect of presence of three
RAS components ­ high serum ACE activity, high plasma
angiotensinogen concentration and homo- or heterozygosity
for theA-allele of the X chromosome-located angiotensin-II
receptor subtype 2 1675G/A polymorphism ­ on the risk of
severe hypoglycaemia in type 1 diabetes.8 This finding sug-
gests that increased angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 activa-
tion that is not counterbalanced by subtype 2 activation is
detrimental during hypoglycaemia in subjects with type 1
diabetes. Epidemiological data support this observation by
showing a lower rate of severe hypoglycaemia in subjects
with type 1 diabetes treated with RAS blockers (ACE inhib-
itors (ACEi) or angiotensin II (ANG II) subtype 1 receptor
blockers (ARBs)) compared with subjects treated with other
antihypertensive agents not influencing RAS.9
The mechanism of the association between RAS activity
and risk of severe hypoglycaemia is not clarified. To main-
tain self-care during hypoglycaemia and thereby avoid pro-
gression to severe hypoglycaemia, maintenance of normal
cognitive function is crucial. We have previously reported
that patients with type 1 diabetes and high RAS activity
developed more pronounced cognitive impairment during
controlled hypoglycaemia than subjects with low activity.10
A decline in alpha frequency in EEG recordings similar to
the shift seen during sleep or pre-coma was also observed
during hypoglycaemia in these subjects,10 thus suggesting a
mechanistic explanation of the association between RAS
activity and risk of severe hypoglycaemia. RAS activity
also affects heart rate and prolongation of the QT interval
during hypoglycaemia in type 1 diabetes.11­13 In patients
with type 1 diabetes the QT interval was more prolonged in
patients with high RAS activity than patients with low
activity during controlled hypoglycaemia.13 QT prolonga-
tion is a common finding during hypoglycaemia,11 and may
be involved in sudden death from ventricular tachyarrhyth-
mia, the so-called `dead-in-bed' syndrome.14,15 High RAS
activity is implicated in ventricular tachyarrhythmia.16
ThusAT1
receptor blockade may protect against unintended
cardiac changes during hypoglycaemia.
The present study tested the hypothesis that angioten-
sin II receptor blockade may have beneficial effects during
mild hypoglycaemia in type 1 diabetes by preserving cogni-
tive function and cardiac repolarisation. Furthermore, the
impact on hormonal counter-regulatory responses, substrate
mobilisation and hypoglycaemic symptoms was explored.
An intervention with candesartan was chosen as this drug
passes the blood brain barrier,18 has effects on the sympa-
thetic nervous system,19 and is associated with improved
cognition in ischaemic brain conditions.20
Methods
Subjects
Nine subjects with type 1 diabetes were recruited from
the outpatient clinics at Nordsjællands Hospital ­
Hillerød and Steno Diabetes Centre (Figure 1). The
patients were selected according to high spontaneous
RAS activity defined as a total score > 8 obtained by
measurements of plasma angiotensinogen concentration
(1­4; 4 highest quartile), serum ACE activity (1­4; 4
highest quartile) and AT2
receptor subtype 2 genotype (1
= GG; 2 = GA; 3 = AA). Furthermore, patients were not
allowed to take any RAS blocking agents (according to
their medical records). Other inclusion criteria were age
>18 years, duration of diabetes >5 years and negative
pregnancy test or verified menopause. Exclusion criteria
were use of any RAS blocking treatment (according to
the patient), antihypertensive treatment or medical treat-
ment interfering with cognitive function, presence of
severe late diabetic complications defined as recently
laser-treated retinopathy, symptomatic autonomous
Figure 1. Flow chart of recruitment to the study. Data on RAS activity was obtainable for 451 patients. After excluding patients
who were on RAS blocking treatment or centrally acting drugs and patients who suffered from conditions not eligible for
participating in a hypoglycaemic experiment (dementia, heart failure, cancer), 49 patients were eligible to participate in the study.
Thirty-three patients declined to participate, 16 patients came to the information meeting. We excluded four, two because of
proliferative retinopathy that did not respond well to laser treatment, one because of excessive alcohol consumption and one
because of a too tight schedule with a lot of travelling. Twelve patients were randomised. During the first experimental day one
patient was excluded because we could not get intravenous access, and two patients had a vasovagal episode.

neuropathy, reduced kidney function (plasma creatinine
100 µmol/l for men and >88 µmol/l for women), known
side effects to candesartan, heart failure (NYHA 3-4),
epilepsy, drug or alcohol abuse, and plasma potassium <
3.5 mmol/l or >5 mmol/l. Baseline characteristics are
shown in Table 1.
Design
The study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-
over study (Figure 2). Randomisation was done in blocs
of four patients and placebo and candesartan 32 mg cap-
sules were manufactured by the Pharmacy of the Capital
Region of Denmark. The medicine was blinded, packed
and sealed in identical containers with the numbers 1
and 2 on the label. Patients were randomised 8 days
before the first hypoglycaemia experiment. The patients
were instructed to take one capsule each evening before
bedtime for 7 days. The two experimental days were
separated by at least 5 weeks, allowing for a wash-out
period of >4 weeks (median 6 weeks; range: 5­14
weeks). The primary endpoint was effect of candesartan
on cognitive function during hypoglycaemia. Secondary
endpoints were electroencephalographic changes, cardi-
ovascular parameters, hormonal counter-regulatory
response, substrate mobilisation and symptoms during
hypoglycaemia.
The trial was approved by the Regional Ethics
Committee (H-C-2009-069) and the Data Protection
Agency (2009-41-3853) and registered on Clinicaltrials.
gov (NCT01116180). The Danish Medicines Agency did
not consider the study as an intervention trial, thus it
should not be approved as such. The trial was done accord-
ing to the Declaration of Helsinki, and all participants
signed informed consent before entering the study.
Experimental protocol
The study was conducted according to the Declaration of
Helsinki and all subjects signed informed consent before
entering the trial
Eight days before the experimental day
At the first visit, demographic and clinical characteristics
(including beat-to-beat analysis and biothesiometry) and
diabetes history were collected, and hypoglycaemia aware-
ness status was classified according to a validated
method.21 Blood pressure and weight were measured both
at the first and the second visit. The cognitive test battery
was trained. Blood was sampled to measure plasma potas-
sium and creatinine before the treatment initiation.
Figure 2. Flowchart of the study. The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study with 32 mg candesartan or
placebo. Cycles 1 and 2 were euglycaemic periods and cycles 3 and 4 were hypoglycaemic periods. In cycle 1 and 3, the following
measurements were done: blood samples, symptoms of hypoglycaemia, ECG, EEG, blood pressure, cognitive tests. In cycle 2 and 4,
the following measurements were done: symptoms of hypoglycaemia, blood pressure, blood samples and ECG.

The day before the experimental day
Patients had a continuous glucose monitor (CGM)
(Guardian® REAL-time, Medtronic Minimed, Northridge,
USA) mounted subcutaneously in order to detect possible
hypoglycaemia the night before the experiment. The hypo-
glycaemia alarm was set at 4.5 mmol/l in order to prevent
a hypoglycaemic event below 3.5 mmol/l. The CGM was
calibrated with a blood glucose meter (Contour® Link,
Bayer Health Care, Leverkusen, Germany) according to
the manufacturer's manual. Side effects of treatment were
reported and the cognitive tests were re-trained. Patients
were asked to take the capsules before bedtime to ensure a
standardised medication protocol.
Day of experiment
Subjects arrived at 7:30 a.m. after an overnight fast. CGM
data were downloaded and checked for hypoglycaemic val-
ues <3.5 mmol/l at two consecutive measurements. Patients
were asked if they had measured any blood glucose values
<3.5 mmol/l in the last 12 hours before the experiment.
None of the patients had experienced symptomatic hypo-
glycaemia the night before the experiments. Two patients
had an asymptomatic hypoglycaemic alarm and corrected
per protocol on the alarm (plasma glucose <4.5 mmol/l).
None of the patients had experienced plasma glucose levels
>20 mmol/l during the time they wore the CGM.
The patients were placed in a comfortable resting chair
and were equipped with (1) two intravenous antecubital lines
for infusion of insulin and glucose and for blood sampling,
(2) electroencephalography (EEG) cap, two ear lobe refer-
ences and two precordial ECG leads connected to a digital
EEG recorder (Cadwell, Kennewick Washington, USA), (3)
twelve-lead ECG to monitor heart rate during hypoglycae-
mia (MAC 5500, GE Healthcare, UK), and (4) an automatic
blood pressure unit (Microlife AG, Wildnau, Switzerland).
Patients were introduced to the hypoglycaemia symptom
score questionnaire and once more they trained the cognitive
tests while being clamped to euglycaemia.
The experiment was divided into two comparable peri-
ods, a baseline period (cycle 1 and 2) and a hypoglycaemic
period (cycle 3 and 4) (Figure 2(b)). Cycle 1 and 3 con-
sisted of blood-sampling, hypoglycaemia symptom scor-
ing, ECG, EEG, blood pressure measurements and
cognitive tests.. Cycle 2 and 4 consisted of hypoglycaemia
symptom scoring, blood pressure measurements, blood
sampling and ECG.
Hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemic
clamp procedure
Short acting human insulin (Actrapid®, Novo Nordisk,
Bagsværd, Denmark) mixed with heparinised plasma from
the patient and isotonic saline was infused at a rate of 1.0
mU × kg bodyweight-1 × minute-1 with a syringe pump
(Argus 600S, Argus Medical AG, Heimberg, Switzerland).
Plasma glucose concentrations were measured throughout
the study at 5-10 min intervals (YSI 2300 Stat Plus, Yellow
Springs, USA) and adjusted with a variable infusion of
20% glucose via an infusion pump (Argus 414, Argus
Medical AG, Heimberg, Switzerland). The plasma glucose
target was 5­6 mmol/l for 60 min during the baseline
period and 2.5­2.7 mmol/l during hypoglyceamia for 60
min (Figure 2).
Cognitive function tests
California Cognitive Assessment Package
(CalCAP)
Working memory was evaluated by the DanishAbbreviated
Reaction Time test (DART) of CalCAP (E.N. Miller,
California Cognitive Assessment Package, Norland
Software, Los Angeles, 1990). DART consists of three dif-
ferent reaction time tasks which run on a computer screen;
CRT1: a choice reaction task with reaction to number 7;
SRT1: a choice reaction task with reaction to two identical
one-figure numbers in a sequence; and SRT2: a choice
reaction task with reaction to a pair of one-figure numbers
in ascending order (e.g. 1­2 or 5­6). The software calcu-
lates the individual mean reaction times and number of
errors for each test.
Stroop's test
Stroop's test measures selective attention and cognitive
flexibility.22 The test consists of three pages, each with 100
items divided in 5 columns. On the first page the words
yellow, blue and red are typed randomly in black; the sub-
ject must read aloud the words. On the second page the
same colours are printed as "XXXX" and arranged ran-
domly; the subject must read aloud the colours of the X's.
On the last page the ink colour is different from the typed
colour and the subjects must read aloud the ink colour. The
number of items completed in 45 sec on each page is used
for test evaluation.
Trail-making test
The trail-making test measures visual scanning, attention,
concentration speed of eye-hand coordination and infor-
mation processing.23 Trail 5 was assessed in which sub-
jects must connect circled numbers and letters in alternating
sequences (e.g. 1-A-2-B-3-C....13). The time used to
complete the test is measured.
Neurophysiological tests
Electroencephalography
EEG was recorded using Cadwell standard EEG recording
system and silver­silver chloride electrocaps with the 19
standard positions of the international 10­20 system using
1040 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)
linked earlobe references. EEG was obtained in a 5-min
resting period during each glycaemic period. Patients were
asked to stay awake with their eyes closed during the record-
ings. Eight patients underwent EEG recordings on both
experimental days, and they were included in the analysis.
Data were exported to edf-format in the recording mon-
tage and analysed in Matlab (Matrix Laboratory (http://
www.mathworks.se/products/matlab/?s_cid). Data were
filtered with an eighth order Butterworth filter with a low-
cut of 0.5 Hz and a high-cut of 32 HZ. The two prefrontal
electrodes were associated with artefacts in several patients
and discarded in the process. Thus the following electrodes
were used for analysis: F7, F8, F3, F4, FZ, T7, T8, C2, C4,
CZ, P7, P8, PZ, O1 and O2. In each recording, 10 artefact-
free periods of at least 5 s duration were identified. The
mean centroid frequency (5­11 Hz) was used in the calcu-
lations and further five different groups were created to
evaluate the effect on the different areas of the brain. Thus
group F (the frontal cortex (F3, FZ, F4)), group C (the cor-
tex of the central sulcus (C3, CZ, C4)), group T (the tem-
poral cortex (F7, F8, T7, T8, P7, P8)), group P (the parietal
cortex (P3, PZ, P4)) and group O (occipital cortex (O1,
O2)) were created.
Cardiovascular parameters
ECG was measured using a MAC 5500 and saved elec-
tronically. Heart rate was calculated from the ECG. QT
intervals were calculated from five 12-lead ECG record-
ings of 10 sec duration in each cycle (c1­c4; Figure 2).
Semiautomatic QT analysis was performed by a trained
electro physiologist blinded to the treatment. The QT inter-
val was corrected for differences in heart rate (HR) accord-
ing to Bazett's (QTcb
= QT / RR1/2) and Fridericia's
formulas (QTcf
= QT / RR1/3).
Hypoglycaemic symptom scoring
An extended version of the Edinburgh Hypoglycaemia
Scale including dummy questions was used to assess
symptoms of hypoglycaemia.24 Symptoms are divided into
autonomic symptoms (sweating, trembling and warm-
ness), neuroglycopenic symptoms (drowsiness, tiredness,
hunger and weakness) and cognitive dysfunction (inability
to concentrate, blurred vision, anxiety, confusion, diffi-
culty in speaking and double vision). The highest scores
possible are 21 (autonomic symptoms), 28 (neuroglyco-
penic symptoms) and 42 (cognitive dysfunction). The sub-
ject rates the symptoms on a Likert scale from 1 to 7,
where 1 indicates that the symptom is absent while 7 indi-
cates that the symptom is at its maximum intensity.24
Laboratory analysis
Plasma glucagon concentrations were measured with a
radioimmunoassay directed against the C-terminus of the
glucagon molecule (antibody core no. 4305), which mainly
measures glucagon of pancreatic origin.25 Catecholamines
were measured in blood drawn in chilled tubes which was
pre-added a mixture of EGTA, glutathione and NaOH to
prevent catecholamine degradation. Levels of catechola-
mines were determined with a commercial ELISA kit (BA
E-5100, Labor Diagnostika Nord GmbH and Co, Nordhorn,
Germany). Serum growth hormone concentrations were
determined with a commercial fluorometric method
(Delfia, Wallac, Finland) using two monoclonal antibodies
against two separate antigenic determinants on the growth
hormone molecule. Concentrations of free fatty acids,
glycerol, ketones and lactate were determined by spec-
trometry (Roche Hitachi 912 Chemistry Analyzer, Roche,
Glostrup, Denmark). Cortisol, C-peptide and electrolytes
were measured with routine methods. All other samples
were centrifuged and stored immediately at -80 ºC to be
analysed after completion of the study.
Power calculation and statistics
The pre-study power calculation with a minimal relevant
difference (MIREDIF) = 50 ms for mean reaction time
prolongation (CalCAP, SRT2) and SD = 80 ms (10) and
type 1 and type 2 error risks of 5% and 20%, respectively,
showed that 20 patients should be included. Unfortunately
it was not feasible to obtain that number of participants
due to our rather strict in- and exclusion criteria (Figure 1).
All calculations were done with SPSS software package
19. Initially all variables were tested for normality visu-
ally and using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. When
comparing the euglycaemic and hypoglycaemic period,
non-parametric analyses were used when data were not
normally distributed. For the ANCOVA data were ln-trans-
formed and back-transformed after analysis. In case nor-
mality could not be obtained anANCOVAwas not possible
and Wilcoxon's signed rank test was used instead of paired
samples t-test. Euglycaemic values were compared with
hypoglycaemic values using a paired t-test in order to eval-
uate whether the endpoint changed from baseline during
hypoglycaemia. A mixed linear model ANCOVA was used
to investigate the impact of candesartan on the endpoints.
Analyses were done for each endpoint separately. Baseline
values were included in the analysis as a covariate and
fixed factor. Plasma glucose concentration at the time of
the cognitive test or symptom scoring was included as
covariate and fixed factor. Treatment was included as fixed
factor and patient number was random factor. The analysis
of counter-regulatory hormones and substrates were based
on peak values during hypoglycaemia and mean values
during euglycaemia.
Plasma glucose levels during hypoglycaemia on the
two days of experiments were compared using a paired
t-test. Calculations regarding cognitive function, EEG and
ECG were done blinded to the intervention. A p < 0.05
(two-sided) was considered statistically significant.

Results
Plasma glucose and glucose infusion rate
The mean plasma glucose (±SD) during euglycaemia was
5.5±0.4 and 5.2±0.3 mmol/l at the candesartan and placebo
days, respectively, (p = 0.18) and similar (2.6±0.2 mmol/l)
during hypoglycaemia on both experimental days (p =
0.96; Figure 3). Glucose infusion rate during hypoglycae-
mia were 36 % lower on the candesartan day (0.009±0.005
mmol × kg body weight-1 × min-1) than on the placebo day
(0.014±0.002 mmol × kg body weight-1 × min-1) (p = 0.05).
There were no differences in the lengths of euglycaemia
and hypoglycaemia during the candesartan and placebo
days (63±21 and 67±19 min, and 54±14 and 60±17 min,
respectively (p > 0.05)).
Cognitive function
Reaction time did not differ between euglycaemia and
hypoglycaemia at the CRT2, SRT1 and SRT2 tests either
on candesartan or on placebo. Similar results were obtained
for the placebo-corrected delta-values. For SRT1 error
and
SRT2 error
there was a significant increase in errors between
euglycaemia and hypoglycaemia on placebo but not on
candesartan (p = 0.03 and p = 0.05 respectively) while no
differences were observed for CRTerror
. In the trail-making
test and Stroopword
, Stroopcolour
and Stroopcolour/word
tests
deteriorations were seen in completion time (trail-making
test) and number of items completed (Stroop's test)
between the euglycaemic and hypoglycaemia periods for
both the candesartan and the placebo groups. In the
ANCOVAno effect of candesartan treatment was observed
at hypoglycaemia for any cognitive endpoints (p = 0.32­
0.92). See Table 2.
Neurophysiological test
On the EEG no differences in the mean centroid frequency
(mean of all 17 electrodes included) of the 5­11 Hz band
and the five groups representing the regions of the brain
(group F, C, P, T and O) between euglycaemia and hypo-
glycaemia was observed . No effect of candesartan treat-
ment was observed in the ANCOVA (p = 0.23­0.42). See
Table 3.
Cardiovascular parameters
Diastolic blood pressure at baseline was lower on the can-
desartan day (73±16 mmHg) than on the placebo day
(77±18) (p < 0.05). Systolic blood pressure showed a simi-
lar trend towards a lower level on the candesartan day
(120±28) than on the placebo day (127±25) (p < 0.1).
Blood pressure did not change significantly between eug-
lycaemia and hypoglycaemia on the two days and there

euglycaemia was 5.5±0.4 and 5.2±0.3 mmol/l at the candesartan and placebo days, respectively (p = 0.18), and similar (2.6±0.2
mmol/l) during hypoglycaemia on both experimental days (p = 0.96).

was no effect of candesartan in this normotensive cohort.
Heart rate did not change in response to hypoglycaemia on
the candesartan day and this was due to candesartan in the
ANCOVA. QTcb
and QTcf
increased from baseline to
hypoglycaemia, with no differences observed between
groups. See Table 4.
Table 2. Cognitive function was evaluated by the Danish Abbreviated Reaction Time test (DART) of CalCAP that measures
working memory, Stroop's test that measures selective attention and cognitive flexibility, and the trail-making test that measures
visual scanning, attention, concentration, speed of eye-hand coordination and information processing. Below results of univariate
analyses between euglycaemia and hypoglycaemia on the two experimental days are displayed. The effect of candesartan is displayed
in the ANCOVA column. In the ANCOVA baseline values and plasma glucose at the specific test were included as fixed covariates,
candesartan as fixed factor and patient as random factor. Numbers are mean (SD).

Table 3. EEG was evaluated by the centroid frequency (5­11 Hz). The mean centroid frequency was used in the calculations and
further five different groups were created to evaluate the effect on the different areas of the brain: group F (the frontal cortex),
group C (the cortex of the central sulcus), group T (the temporal cortex), group P (the parietal cortex) and group O (occipital
cortex). ANCOVA was performed as mentioned in Table 2 but instead of plasma glucose at the time of the EEG mean plasma
glucose during hypoglycaemia was used. Numbers are mean (SD).

Hormonal counter-regulatory response,
substrate mobilisation and symptoms of
hypoglycaemia
An adequate hormonal counter-regulatory and substrate
mobilisation response to hypoglycaemia was observed on
both days except for adrenaline that only rose on the can-
desartan day and glucagon that did not change in response
to hypoglycaemia on neither of the experimental days. No
effect of candesartan was observed for any measurements.
An efficient response to hypoglycaemia in terms of hypo-
glycaemic symptoms was observed on both experimental
days and there were no effect of candesartan. (See
Supplementary tables 1­2 online).
Discussion
Treatment with 32 mg candesartan daily for 7 days did not
affect the measured protective responses to hypoglycae-
mia during a hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemic clamp
procedure. Thus, hypoglycaemic changes in cognitive
function, cardiac repolarisation and other endpoints did
not differ between candesartan and placebo. The only dif-
ference between the treatments was a 36% reduced glu-
cose infusion rate during hypoglycaemia with candesartan,
suggestive of either increased endogenous glucose produc-
tion or reduced glucose consumption.
The negative result concerning cognition contrasts pre-
vious studies in patients with type 1 diabetes and healthy
subjects with high spontaneous RAS activity.10,26 In these
subjects cognitive function deteriorated significantly
(CalCAP test) during hypoglycaemia compared to subjects
with low RAS activity. Both these studies obtained a plasma
glucose level during hypoglycaemia similar to that in the
present study, but since they did not use a clamp approach
there was no glucose infusion during hypoglycaemia. It is
therefore possible that a potential effect of candesartan in
this study is masked by the higher glucose infusion rate in
the placebo arm. Another potential explanation for the dif-
ference between the studies is that the subjects with low
spontaneous RAS activity had the G-allele of the angioten-
sin II receptor subtype 2 that confers high expression of the
receptor, while the participants in this study had theA-allele
that confers low receptor expression. The candesartan
blockade blocks only the subtype 1 receptor, but does prob-
ably increase subtype 2 activity.
The QT intervals increased in both treatment arms in
response to hypoglycaemia in accordance with previous
findings in patients with high spontaneous RAS
activity.13
We did not observe any effect of candesartan on coun-
ter-regulatory hormone or substrate responses to hypogly-
caemia. This is in contrast to a study of healthy men treated
with losartan,27 which reported an attenuated adrenaline
response to hypoglycaemia in the treatment arm compared
to placebo and in line with a study of healthy men treated
with captopril andACE inhibitor reporting no difference in
symptoms and counter-regulation.28 The symptom scores
were not affected by candesartan treatment. A study com-
paring losartan (an ARB) and placebo during mild hypo-
glycaemia in healthy men indicated that ARB treatment
attenuates hypoglycaemic symptoms and adrenaline
response,27 thus contrasting our previous findings.28 The
hormonal counter-regulatory response to hypoglycaemia
is, however, different in healthy people and patients with
type 1 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes the glucagon response is
blunted or absent after a few years of diabetes.29 After a
decade with type 1 diabetes the adrenaline response is also
blunted in some patients leaving them with weakened
autonomic symptoms and the slower responding cortisol
and growth hormone secretion as the salvage of hypogly-
caemia.29 The hormonal counter-regulatory response is
also blunted in response to recurrent hypoglycaemia.30
Therefore it is not possible to extrapolate data on the hor-
monal counter-regulatory response in healthy people to
patients with type 1 diabetes.
Table 4. Cardiovascular parameters were calculated from the ECG and by an automatic blood pressure unit. Heart rate and QTc
intervals were calculated from five 12-lead ECG recordings of 10 sec duration in each cycle (c1­c4; Figure 2(b)). The QT interval
was corrected for differences in heart rate (HR) according to Bazett's (QTcb
= QT / RR1/2) and Fridericia's formulas (QTcf
= QT /
RR1/3). Analysis is carried out as in Table 3. Numbers are mean (SD).

The strength of our study is its double-blind, placebo-
controlled, cross-over design and extensive examinations.
The use of CGM made it possible to avoid hypoglycaemia
prior to the study, thereby avoiding a blunted hormonal
counter-regulatory response to hypoglycaemia. The cogni-
tive tests were trained twice at every visit prior to the
experimental day ­four times in total ­ in order to mini-
mise a possible learning effect.
The main limitation of the study is the number of sub-
jects included. According to the pre-study power calcula-
tion 20 patients should be included to obtain the calculated
difference. Only nine subjects were included mainly due to
strict in- and exclusion criteria. Another limitation of the
study may be that the patients were not effectively RAS
blocked at the time of the hypoglycaemic phase. We took
this into account by choosing candesartan that ­ even
though the plasma half-life is 9­12 hours ­ has a blood
pressure lowering effect of more than 24 hours as a meas-
ure of the blocking effect on the receptors. In the present
study candesartan had an antihypertensive effect during
euglycaemia, suggesting adequate RAS blockade at the
time of the experiment.
In conclusion, RAS blockade with candesartan had no
effects on cognitive function or other responses to hypo-
glycaemia, but resulted in a diminished need for glucose
supply during hypoglycaemia. The reason for the lower
GIR during hypoglycaemia in the candesartan arm is spec-
ulative but could be associated with the adrenaline response
observed on the candesartan day but not on the placebo
day. This was, however not mimicked in the glucagon
response being only numerically higher during hypogly-
caemia on the candesartan day. The mechanism of high
spontaneous RAS activity on deteriorated cognitive func-
tion during hypoglycaemia is thus not clarified by this
study using AT1
receptor inhibition. Studies of the effect of
ARBs or ACE inhibitors on endogenous glucose metabo-
lism during hypoglycaemia are warranted to further
explore their potential in minimising severe hypoglycae-
mic events in patients with type 1 diabetes.
Novelty statement
RAS blockade with candesartan has no effect on:
·
· Cognitive function
·
· Counter-regulatory hormones
·
· Symptoms of hypoglycaemia
But the glucose infusion rate is 36% lower during hypo-
glycaemia on the candesartan day than on the placebo day.
