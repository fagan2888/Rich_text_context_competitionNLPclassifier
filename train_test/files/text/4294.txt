Article
Evidence generally supports the notion that children placed
in foster care are at heightened risk of maladjustment owing
to past experiences of maltreatment (physical or sexual
abuse, or neglect) and placement related-risk conditions
(Taussig, 2002). However, information about foster children
quality of sleep is sparse. Given that foster children have
experienced chaotic and inconsistent care prior to placement,
they may be particularly frightened at night and not view
foster caregivers as sources of regulation of fears (Tininenko,
Fisher, Bruce, & Pears, 2010). In particular, there is a need to
identify sleep habits of young foster children and determine
how experiences of maltreatment and placement conditions
might be related to sleep quality and disruptions.
Sleep Disorders in Young Children
Sleep disorders are highly prevalent in children, as shown in
epidemiologic studies indicating that up to 50% of children
experience a sleep problem (Carter, Hathaway, & Lettieri,
2014). The most prevalent sleep disorders in children are
behavioral insomnia and parasomnias. The former is mostly
characterized by bedtime resistance, frequent nighttime
awakening, and/or an inability to sleep alone, whereas the
latter are characterized by awakenings from deep sleep, such
as sleepwalking, bruxism, enuresis, sleep terrors, and night-
mares (American Academy of Sleep Medicine [AASM],
2014).
Multiple factors related to individual and relational char-
acteristics are associated with child sleep (Touchette, Petit,
Tremblay, & Montplaisir, 2009). For instance, sleep distur-
bances are linked to child internalizing and externalizing dis-
orders (Gregory & Sadeh, 2012) and to greater psychological
distress in mothers (Martin, Hiscock, Hardy, Davey, & Wake,
2007). Low quality of mother-child interactions and stressful
family life events are associated with poor sleep in non-
clinical samples (Bélanger, Bernier, Paquet, Simard, &

Abstract
This exploratory study investigated child sleep in a sample of maltreated children living in foster care and examined its
associations with placement conditions and history of maltreatment. Participants included 25 foster children and their foster
caregiver. Children were on average 60.24 months of age (SD = 18.70). Foster mothers completed questionnaires assessing
parenting stress and quality of child sleep while maltreatment/placement history was retrieved from children Child Protection
Services (CPS) records. Shorter nocturnal sleep duration and parasomnias were related to placement at a younger age. The
non-restorative sleep index was significantly related to time spent in the foster home and parenting stress and marginally
related to number of placements and sexual abuse and neglect. Poor sleep was associated with past experience of sexual
abuse and neglect and parenting stress. No relationships were found between sleep characteristics and past experiences of
physical abuse or type of foster family. These findings provide an opportunity to uncover how foster children experiences
are related to sleep disturbances.

Carrier, 2013; Sadeh, Raviv, & Gruber, 2000). A low socio-
economic status is also associated with poorer sleep, includ-
ing sleep-onset difficulties (Petit, Paquet, Touchette, &
Montplaisir, 2010). Taken together, these studies suggest that
sleep is sensitive to not only child or parent characteristics but
also to the exposition of adverse environmental conditions.
Sleep Characteristics of Children in
Foster Care
Children placed in foster care face an alarming combination
of risk conditions, including experiences of early maltreat-
ment and separations from their primary caregivers, which
can result in emotional and behavioral disturbances (Villodas,
Litrownik, Newton, & Davis, 2016). Yet, to our knowledge,
only one study has specifically assessed sleep of young fos-
ter children. In this study, sleeping behavior was assessed
using sleep actigraphy and parent-report measures among
groups of children (3-7 years of age) living in foster care or
community settings (Tininenko et al., 2010). Results showed
that foster children have greater difficulty initiating sleep
than community children. However, children living in treat-
ment foster care (receiving preventive intervention address-
ing socio-emotional needs) had a longer sleep duration than
those living in regular foster care or in a low-income com-
munity. Sleep duration did not differ between children in
regular foster care and those of the community. Overall, this
study suggests that parental status and placement type relates
to child sleep characteristics. However, it did not assess fos-
ter children's living conditions that could be affecting sleep,
such as placement conditions and past experiences of mal-
treatment. Moreover, no information related to parasomnias
was reported.
Studies assessing the impact of maltreatment on quality of
child sleep are very limited. Whereas one study has found
that sexually abused children (mean age 5.9 years) had more
sleep problems as reported by parents (e.g., being overtired,
sleeping less or more than most children, and having trouble
sleeping) than the comparison group (Dubowitz, Black,
Harrington, & Verschoore, 1993), another showed that expe-
riences of physical abuse but not sexual abuse were related to
poor quality of sleep in children (7-14 years of age) as
assessed by actigraphy (Sadeh et al., 1995). Finally, prepu-
bertal abused children were twice as active at night as control
and depressed children and had prolonged sleep latency and
decreased sleep efficiency (Glod, Teicher, Hartman, &
Harakal, 1997). No study has yet confirmed the hypothesis
that neglect should impact on child sleep.
The present exploratory study is the first report on multi-
ple indicators of sleep, including sleep difficulties and para-
somnias, in a sample of young children placed in foster care
after being exposed to parental maltreatment. The investiga-
tion of child history of maltreatment is an opportunity to
uncover how these life experiences can relate to child sleep.
The tested hypothesis was that past experiences of abuse and
placement-related risk conditions, including foster caregiver
psychological distress, would be related to poor quality of
child sleep.
Method
Participants
Twenty-eight foster mothers and children (19 boys) were
recruited through Child Protection Services (CPS) in a small
urban community in the province of Québec (Canada) to par-
ticipate in a study evaluating the efficacy of a home-visiting
relationship-based intervention program. CPS agencies were
asked to refer foster families who (a) were fostering a child
between 36 and 84 months of age, (b) had been fostering the
child for at least 2 months, and (c) were engaged in long-
term foster care or in an eventual adoption. Only children
with severe organic developmental problems (e.g., cerebral
palsy) were excluded from the study. Identification of fami-
lies was accomplished through liaison with an employee of
the CPS who had legal access to family records. Between the
initial contact with foster mothers and the assessment, three
children were removed from their foster family. Therefore,
the final sample included 25 dyads.
Children were on average 60.24 months of age (SD =
18.70, range: 36 to 84 months of age), and foster mothers
were on average 44.16 years of age (SD = 8.63, range: 32 to
57 years). All participants were Caucasian. Thirty-six per-
cent of foster families had an income below Can$40,000,
24% earned between Can$40,000 and Can$75,000, and 40%
earned Can$75,000 or more. Mean income in Canada was
Can$78,500 at the time of data collection, and the poverty
threshold was Can$27,844 (Gouvernement du Québec,
Institut de la statistique, 2012). Eighty-four percent of foster
families were composed of two parents (84% in the Canadian
population), and 60% of foster mothers had completed a
postsecondary education level (73.2% of woman in the
Canadian population).
Measures and Procedure
CPS employees initially approached eligible families and
obtained their consent to transfer personal information to a
research assistant. Those who accepted were contacted by a
research assistant and received information about the
research purposes. Prior to data collection, written consent
was obtained from foster and biological mothers who con-
sented to their own and their child participation. The protocol
was approved by the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières's
research ethics committee. Participating families completed
initial measures during a 1-hr laboratory visit in which foster
mothers filled different questionnaires including child sleep.
Quality of foster child's sleep. Foster caregivers were asked to
complete Your Child Sleep, a questionnaire that was used in
a preschool sample of adopted children (Tessier, Larose,
Dubois-Comtois et al. 3
Moss, Nadeau, & Tarabulsy, 2005). This questionnaire pro-
vided information on total sleep time at night and during the
day and on different child sleep characteristics that were
rated by foster mothers on a 0 to 3 Likert-type scale (never/
rarely, sometimes, most of the time, always). Three theoreti-
cally driven indexes of sleep were computed by summing the
score (0-3) for each behavior/symptom included in the
indexes: (a) the non-restorative sleep index includes difficul-
ties waking-up in the morning, sleepiness after final morning
awakening, tiredness during the day, and falling asleep dur-
ing the day; (b) the poor sleep index includes having diffi-
culty falling asleep, difficulty getting back to sleep following
an awakening, and being anxious at night/afraid of darkness;
(c) the parasomnia index includes body rocking, sleep brux-
ism, enuresis, bad dreams/nightmares, night terrors, and
irregular breathing during sleep (see International Classifica-
tion of Sleep Disorders­Third Edition [ICSD-3]; AASM,
2014).
Parenting Stress Index (PSI­Short Form). Foster mothers com-
pleted the 36-item PSI­Short Form, a maternal self-report
measure focusing on sources of perceived stress related to
the parental role (Abidin, 1995). Items are rated on a 0 to 5
Likert-type scale and are summed to generate three scales:
parental distress, parent-child dysfunctional interaction, and
difficult child. The PSI shows excellent internal consistency
and convergent validity with respect to prenatal stress, other
indices of postnatal stress, and the quality of parent-infant
interactions (Abidin, 1995). Good internal consistency was
found for the three scales in the current study (Cronbach's
alpha between .77 and .89).
History of maltreatment and placement conditions. This infor-
mation was retrieved from each child CPS record and
included reasons for initial placement (i.e., substantiated
abuse and/or neglect), age at initial placement, and total
number of placements. Age at the time of placement in the
current foster family, type of foster home, and characteristics
of the foster home (income, marital status, number of chil-
dren) were obtained from foster mothers who completed a
sociodemographic questionnaire. Type of foster home
included regular non-kin foster care (placed with unknown
adults), kinship foster care (placed with relatives), and fos-
ter-to-adopt families (placed to potentially be adopted).
Table 1 presents characteristics of placement conditions and
history of maltreatment.
Statistical Analyses
Data manipulation and analysis was performed using the
SPSS (Version 21.0.0.1; SPSS windows). Pearson correla-
tion analyses were undertaken to evaluate associations
between child sleep, history of maltreatment/placements,
and foster mother parental stress. Given that all children
in our sample were exposed to neglect, analyses on
maltreatment were only performed on physical and sexual
abuse. According to Cohen, Cohen, West, and Aiken
(2003), effect sizes, which provide a better interpretation
of the results weight are preferred to statistical signifi-
cance tests and are as follows: r  .1 represents a small
effect size; r  .3 represents a medium effect size, and r 
.5 represents a large effect size. Marginal results (ps > .05
< .10; see Pritschet, Powell, & Horne, 2016) with medium
to large effect sizes were reported.
Results
Sleep Characteristics of Foster Children
Table 2 presents the proportions of sleep conditions (habits
and disturbances) in our sample. Proportions of participants
having specific sleep conditions occurring sometimes to
always vary from 8% to 54%. Mean nocturnal sleep dura-
tion was 10.32 hr, and mean total sleep duration per 24 hr,
including daytime sleep, was 11.22 hr. Scores on the
indexes were normally distributed and suggest that in aver-
age, children in our sample did not present high levels of
sleep problems.
ANOVAs revealed no significant differences in sleep
(duration and indexes) as a function of child gender, marital
status, or income. Correlations revealed no significant asso-
ciations between sleep (duration and indexes) and foster
mother age, or number of children in the foster family. Child
age was significantly related to the parasomnia index,
r = .53, p < .01, and marginally related to total sleep duration,
r = -.36, p < .10, but unrelated to the other sleep variables.
To account for the impact of age on child sleep, subsequent
analyses were covaried with age.

Associations Between Sleep Characteristics,
History of Maltreatment, and Placement
Conditions
Partial correlation controlling for age were conducted
between sleep characteristics, history of maltreatment, and
placement conditions. Several significant and marginally
significant associations (medium to large effect sizes) were
found between sleep variables and maltreatment and place-
ment conditions.
Correlation analyses showed that the parasomnia index
scores were significantly related to total sleep duration (r =
-.45, p < .05) and marginally related to poor sleep index
scores (r = .37, p < .10) but were not associated with the non-
restorative index scores. The non-restorative and poor sleep
indexes were marginally interrelated (r = .36, p < 10) but
were not associated with sleep duration.
Shorter nocturnal sleep duration was related to earlier
placement and longer stay in the foster family (marginal), r =
.44, p < .05 and r = -.41, p < .10, respectively. Sleep duration
(nocturnal or over a 24-hr period) was not related to other
placement conditions or to history of abuse. Greater non-
restorative sleep index scores were significantly related to
time spent in the foster family (r = .44, p < .05) and two of the
parental stress scales (maternal distress: r = .47, p < .05; dif-
ficult child: r = .56, p < .01), and marginally related to number
of placements and sexual abuse, r = .41, p < .10. Higher
scores on the poor sleep index were associated with past
experiences of sexual abuse (r = .50, p < .05) and with greater
parenting stress (caregiver distress: r = .39, p < .10; difficult
child: r = .47, p < .05; dysfunctional interactions:
r = .47, p < .05). Higher parasomnias index scores were
related to earlier placement (r = -.42, p < .05) but unrelated to
other placement conditions. Foster children sleep (duration
and indexes) was not significantly related to past experiences
of physical abuse and neglect or to type of foster family.
Past experiences of physical abuse were marginally
related to experiences of sexual abuse (r = .35, p < .10) and
to children seen as being more difficult (r = .37, p < .10). Past
experiences of sexual abuse were also related to greater par-
enting stress pertaining to child difficulty and dysfunctional
interactions, r = -.42, p < .05. Longer stay in the actual foster
family was related to earlier initial placement (r = -.54, p <
.01), and time spent in the foster home was associated with
foster parent distress (r = .55, p < .01).
Discussion
This exploratory study is the first to describe the association
between history of maltreatment and caregivers reports of
parenting stress and sleep quality and parasomnias of young
children placed in foster families. Foster children in our
study had a mean total sleep duration of 11.22 hr and a mean
nocturnal sleep duration of 10.32 hr, which is more than what

was found in another sample of foster children (3-7 years of
age; Tininenko et al., 2010) but similar to numbers found in
a large normative sample (2.5-8 years of age; Petit et al.,
2010). These results could suggest that after being placed in
a safe and stable environment, previously neglected children
present with adequate sleep duration. To that effect, it was
shown in Tininenko et al. (2010) study that children living
with foster caregivers who received a preventive interven-
tion addressing child socio-emotional needs had a longer
sleep duration than children living in a regular foster family.
In our study with children living in a non-treatment foster
family, shorter nocturnal sleep duration was related to earlier
placement and longer stay in the foster family. It is possible
that children exposed at an earlier age to very problematic
home environments have more difficulty to recoup sleep
duration. Information about placement age was not available
in Tininenko et al. (2010) study but earlier placements could
possibly account for their sample's shorter nocturnal sleep
duration. These results support the association between an
insecure and inconsistent environment and sleep disruption.
Our results showed that greater non-restorative sleep
index scores were marginally related to more placements.
Children with multiple placements experienced more insta-
bility and relationship disruptions, factors that have been
associated with anxiety (Taussig, 2002) and sleep disruptions
(El-Sheikh, Buckhalt, Mize, & Acebo, 2006). In our study,
higher scores on the non-restorative sleep index were signifi-
cantly related to foster mothers' distress and children diffi-
cult behaviors. Because of its impact on behavioral regulation
and control, inadequate amounts of sleep may affect chil-
dren's behavioral and social adjustment during the day and
vice versa (Touchette et al., 2009). It has been shown that
children with disrupted sleep schedules had less positive and
more negative adjustment in preschool, even after consider-
ing the roles of family stress and parenting practices (Bates,
Viken, Alexander, Beyers, & Stockton, 2002). Not only does
children's sleep disruption being related to their adaptation
but it is also associated with their parents' functioning.
Mothers of children who had significant sleep disruptions
reported more parenting stress and caregiving overload
(Meltzer & Mindell, 2007), similar to results found in our
study.
Findings of the current study also indicate that foster chil-
dren showing higher scores on the non-restorative sleep and
poor sleep indexes were more likely to have experienced
sexual abuse. The latter association is quite impressive con-
sidering its large effect size. Observed behaviors related to
the poor sleep index can be associated with inappropriate
sleep associations in children or to inadequate limit setting
by the caregiver. Given that nighttime and darkness may be
directly associated with experiences of abuse (Sadeh, 1996),
it is not surprising that foster children who were sexually
abused show more anxiety and difficult behaviors around
bedtime and during the night. Foster mothers of sexually
abused children reported having more dysfunctional
interactions with them and described them has being more
difficult in general, which is consistent with findings of other
studies (Taylor & Brook, 1986). Because child abuse and
neglect increases risk of developing posttraumatic stress dis-
order (PTSD) and trauma symptoms in childhood (Milot,
Éthier, St-Laurent, & Provost, 2010), it is possible that sexu-
ally abused and neglected children in our sample are more
likely to experience emotional and behavioral disturbances
both during the day and the night because of such
vulnerability.
Foster children showing greater scores on the poor sleep
index were also more likely to have dysfunctional interac-
tions and to show difficult behaviors, which is consistent
with findings from children living with their biological par-
ents (Adam, Snell, & Pendry, 2007; Bélanger et al., 2013).
Taken all together, these studies show that sleep is sensitive
to family context. Conversely, children's poor sleep may also
impede on the foster mother-child relationship. For these
families, fostering a child with difficulties falling asleep or
who is demanding because of sleep anxiety constitutes an
additional burden.
In our study, the parasomnia index was related to earlier
placements, suggesting, for these children, an earlier exposi-
tion to pathogen family environments (e.g., domestic vio-
lence, neglect, abuse). It is noteworthy that these children
were exposed at a younger stage of development to maltreat-
ment, a condition that is known to affect brain development
(Cicchetti & Toth, 2005). One could hypothesize that the
associations found in the present study between sleep and
placement age or time spent in the foster home may be
explained by child age. Because age was included as a
covariate, the variance pertaining to child age was excluded
from the equation, suggesting that placement age and time
spent in the foster home have a unique influence on sleep.
Limitations
This study has several limitations that are important to note.
First, the assessment of child sleep relied on foster mother
report. Given that foster mothers may underestimate children
sleep disturbances (Tikotzky & Sadeh, 2001), further studies
should include objective measures of sleep. Second, because
of the cross-sectional nature of our data, the directionality of
our findings is subject to debate. Third, the relatively small
number of participants affected statistical power. It will be
important to replicate the study findings on a larger sample
and to follow children over a period of time to assess change
in foster children sleep.
Conclusion
The current exploratory study sheds light on sleep quality
and habits of young children placed in foster care after being
exposed to child maltreatment. Age at initial placement,
number of placements, past experiences of sexual abuse and
6 SAGE Open
neglect, and foster caregiver's level of parenting stress were
all associated with poor quality of sleep. The significance of
our findings is strengthened by the medium to large effect
sizes, indicating statistical robustness despite the small sam-
ple size. Considering the impact of sleep disturbances on
multiple aspects of development, sleep disturbances could
exacerbate developmental problems in foster children.
