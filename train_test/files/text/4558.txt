In the past 100-odd years of research exploring human intel-
ligence only a select few studies have adequately explored
whether known broad cognitive abilities can be identified
when tests are presented via modalities other than visual (see
Danthiir, Roberts, Pallier, & Stankov, 2001; Horn & Stankov,
1982; Roberts, Stankov, Pallier, & Bradley, 1997; Stankov,
Seizova-Cajic, & Roberts, 2001). The abilities referred to are
those identified in current taxonomies of human intelli-
gence--including theory of fluid intelligence and crystal-
lized intelligence (Gf­Gc theory; see, for example, Horn &
Noll, 1994) and Carroll's (1993) three-stratum theory--and
the issue is of interest because the extent to which these abili-
ties might reflect modality-specific versus general cognitive
processes is not entirely clear. Moreover, it has been noted
previously that an adequate description of intelligence will
reflect knowledge of the basic forms in which it is manifest
within each of our sensory­perceptual modalities (Horn &
Stankov, 1982). This knowledge is still lacking.
There is reason to suppose that intelligence is revealed
other than just via the visual system. Consider the auditory
modality: It is the prime channel for communicating and
acquiring information during infancy, and this reliance only
shifts to the visual system at about 5 years of age (Sloutsky
& Napolitano, 2003). Thus, auditory abilities are crucial for
the normal development of intelligence, and children with
hearing impairments, or total hearing loss, are disadvantaged
because of lack of exposure to abstract concepts (Stankov,
1994). Research showing that the average IQ of deaf people
is lower than that of people with normal hearing (Vernon,
2005) and of the blind (see Stankov, 1994) supports the inte-
gral role audition plays in human intellectual functioning.
Despite this obvious importance, audition has been
referred to as the neglected domain in intelligence models
and tests (Seidel, 2005). Stankov (1971), for example, long
ago noted that prior to his PhD study there was nothing in the
field of intelligence research concerned specifically with
general auditory intelligence (Ga). Although previous
research had explored the various abilities manifested in the
auditory modality, unlike Stankov's study, these studies were
not themselves concerned with how auditory abilities posi-
tion themselves within the taxonomy of intelligence or relate
to existing cognitive abilities (for a review of this auditory
research see Shuter-Dyson, 1968; Shuter-Dyson & Gabriel,
1981). More than two decades after Stankov, Carroll (1993)
noted again that evidence on the structure of auditory abili-
ties remained scant because most factor-analytic studies had
"totally neglected the domain of auditory abilities" (p. 365).
Carroll's and Stankov's concerns have remained unheeded,
however, and Seidel (2008) recently reiterated the ongoing
neglect of putative auditory cognitive abilities. Our under-
standing of general auditory intelligence (Ga) has pro-
gressed. However, research concerning how these auditory
abilities relate to established broad intellectual factors (e.g.,
Gf) and other traditional measures of intelligence remains
scarce.

Developing Auditory Measures of General
Speediness:A Pilot Study
IanT. Zajac1, Nicholas R. Burns1, andVanessa Danthiir2
Abstract
This study examined whether the broad ability general speediness (Gs) could be measured via the auditory modality. Existing
and purpose-developed auditory tasks that maintained the cognitive requirements of established visually presented Gs
markers were completed by 96 university undergraduates. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses showed that the
auditory tasks combined with established visual measures to define latent Gs and reaction time factors.These findings provide
preliminary evidence that suggests that if auditory tasks are developed that maintain the same cognitive requirements as
existing visual measures, then they are likely to index similar cognitive processes.

Stankov (1994) has previously proposed that auditory
abilities form three hierarchically organized layers compris-
ing sensory, perceptual, and thinking processes. Abilities at
the sensory level relate weakly with each other as well as to
the higher order processes (Seidel, 2008), and they relate
weakly to abilities in other sensory modalities. They are best
measured using acuity tasks that determine thresholds for
frequency discrimination, loudness discrimination, spatial
localization, and the like. At the highest thinking level, how-
ever, the abilities are intellective in nature and the reliance on
audition is incidental. Auditory speech abilities are an exam-
ple of this highest level. According to Carroll (1993), speech
abilities rely not on the sensory and thus modality-specific
aspects of the tasks, but rather on the ability to grasp the
complex and demanding relationships among elements of
the problem (Stankov, 1994). In this sense, these auditory
speech tasks are similar to traditional visual Gc marker tests
in which performance does not rely so much on the percep-
tion of two visually presented words, for example, but rather
on the cognitive processing required to decide whether they
are synonyms or antonyms. According to this logic then, it
would appear that broad cognitive abilities that have been
traditionally measured using visual tasks might also be mea-
surable using the auditory modality provided that the audi-
tory tasks are designed to maintain the same cognitive
requirements as corresponding visual tasks, as opposed to
more modality-specific type processes.
Some of Stankov and Horn's studies (Horn & Stankov,
1982; Stankov, 1978; Stankov & Horn, 1980) support this
theory. Correlations between a select few auditory tasks and
broad factors defined by traditional visual measures suggest
that Gf and Gc can be measured auditorily. Listening to ver-
bal comprehension, for example, loads moderately on Gc
(Horn & Stankov, 1982), whereas tonal series and chord
series have been shown to load on Gf (Stankov, Horn, &
Roy, 1980). Elsewhere, there is evidence that auditory tem-
poral discrimination tasks might possibly relate to memory
functions (see, for example, Stankov et al., 1980; Zajac &
Burns, in press), and indeed, the Woodcock-Johnson III Tests
of Cognitive Abilities (Woodcock, McGrew, & Mather,
2001) includes auditory measures of short- and long-term
memory, which are considered independent from the Ga
tasks in that battery. The research literature regarding so-
called elementary cognitive tasks (ECTs) indicates that there
might also be a link between performance on auditory ECTs
and general speed of processing (Gs). For example, studies
of auditory inspection time (AIT) suggest the existence of a
relationship between auditory functions measured by AIT
tasks and Gs-type abilities, with the spatial version of AIT
exhibiting stronger and more consistent relationships in this
regard than other versions of this task (see Zajac & Burns,
2007, 2011 for a detailed review of AIT research). Similarly,
visual RT (VRT) tasks relate well to Gs (Danthiir, 2005;
Danthiir, Wilhelm, Schulze, & Roberts, 2005), and they also
relate strongly to auditory reaction time (ART) tasks (Sen,
Jensen, Sen, & Arora, 1983). Given the apparently similar
processes tapped by them, it is plausible that ART might also
relate to broad Gs, and there appears some preliminary evi-
dence supporting this idea (Zajac & Burns, in press).
A pertinent issue concerning these putative relationships
between auditory tasks and broad abilities other than Ga is
that there have been few such reports, and they have received
little attention because the studies have been primarily inter-
ested in auditory abilities themselves. Moreover, in studies
that have reported such relationships, the broad abilities with
which the auditory tasks correlate have generally been poorly
defined, often being measured by only a single marker test.
Consequently, this leaves these associations open to many
different interpretations.
The purpose of the current study was to begin to fill the
void in research concerning the relationship of auditory abil-
ities to other, specific broad factors in the taxonomy of intel-
ligence. Rather than adopting the approach of administering
a battery of auditory tasks and subsequently assessing their
correlations with traditional ability measures, this study
aimed to explore whether auditory tasks can be purpose
designed to measure a single, specific broad factor. We felt
this method was advantageous because it potentially permits
an understanding of the relationship of auditory abilities to a
specific broad ability as well as providing a new understand-
ing of the broad ability itself. More specifically, if auditory
tasks are developed that maintain the same cognitive require-
ments as visual tasks, then the visual and auditory tasks
should correlate well. However, if no relationships are found,
it may be necessary to question the generality of the relevant
broad ability and why it was not possible to measure it audi-
torily, for instance, "Should this broad ability be regarded as
vision specific, given that only visual tests appear to define
it?"
The present study focused on the broad ability Gs for two
reasons: First, some existing ECTs such as ART and AIT
have been suggested as measuring Gs, but they have never
been systematically investigated. Second, traditional Gs tests
are quick and easy tasks, and many lend themselves readily
to adaptation to presentation in the auditory modality. When
developing new auditory tasks, the nature of Gs must be
carefully considered and preserved if the tasks are to prove
successful. In short, Gs subsumes intellectually easy tasks
that require rapid scanning and responding (Horn & Noll,
1994). The elementary nature of these tasks is paramount
because this is what distinguishes Gs from higher level
(accuracy-based) factors, where performance is a function of
difficulty. Controlling item difficulty in pure tests of speed
ensures that performance only reflects the rate at which par-
ticipants complete the items in the test (Carroll, 1993). Thus,
the rationale for this research dictated that auditory tests be
obtained or designed to represent processes analogous to
existing visual Gs marker tests. Therefore, some tasks have
been adapted from previous work--such as ART--whereas
others were newly developed. Regarding the latter, we
Zajac et al. 3
selected visual tasks that we thought could be translated into
an auditory format, thereby ensuring consistency in the cog-
nitive requirements across modalities. Examples of these
visual Gs tasks include Symbol Digit (McPherson & Burns,
2005), Number Comparisons (Ekstrom, French, Harman, &
Derman, 1976), and Finding As (Danthiir et al., 2005).
The study reported herein was designed to pilot these new
auditory tasks. Our primary aims were to (a) gather data
regarding the test­retest reliability of these auditory mea-
sures; (b) examine the correlations between the auditory and
visual tasks, specifically the auditory/visual analogous; and
(c) explore the underlying factor structure of the auditory
and visual tasks to determine whether they load on the same
factors as opposed to modality-specific type factors.
Method
Participants
Participants were (N = 96) undergraduate psychology stu-
dents of the University of Adelaide. There were 69 females
and 27 males, and the mean age of the sample was 20.0 years
(SD = 4.0 years). All participated as part of their 1st-year
psychology course requirements.
Apparatus
The presentation of all tasks and recording of responses
were controlled by one of three identical Pentium 4 class
computers. Visual stimuli were presented on 17-inch LCDs.
Auditory stimuli were presented via Sony MDR-XD100
stereo headphones. All auditory tones were calibrated prior
to the study using a Radio Shack 33-4050 Sound Level
Meter.
RT Measures
Simple ART. To begin each trial, the participant pressed the
number "5" key in the numeric keypad of the keyboard. This
key acted as a nonfunctional home button only and ensured
that responses originated from the same position on each
trial. After 300 ms a cue-tone (100 ms at 880 Hz) was pre-
sented, followed, after a silent interval of variable duration
(1,300 ms, 1,700 ms, 2,100 ms, or 2,500 ms), by a target
tone--a 500 ms "bell" sound centered on a frequency of 800
Hz. Participants lifted their finger off the number "5" key
and pressed the number "8" key as quickly and as accurately
as possible. Participants were required to complete 10 cor-
rect trials out of 10 before they proceeded to the test. The
outcome measure was mean RT--time between onset of tar-
get and pressing of response key--calculated after the
removal of outliers (±3 SD) and errors.
Two-choice ART (ART
2
). The target tone in this task was
presented to the left or right ear only. Participants responded
by pressing the number "4" key if the target tone was played
to the left ear or number "6" if it was played to the right ear.
All other aspects of the task were identical to ART.
Three-choice ART (ART
3
). During this task, the target tone
was presented to the left ear only, both ears, or right ear only.
Participants responded by pressing the number "4" key in the
numeric keypad for the left ear, number "8" if it was played
to both ears, or number "6" for the right ear. All other aspects
of the task were identical to ART.
VRT. This task was functionally equivalent to ART but
required participants to respond on the illumination of an
empty circle, 4 cm in diameter, presented against the black
background of the computer screen. The white outline of the
circle was presented at the onset of each trial and acted as a
cue, and the circle illuminated red after a variable duration of
1,300; 1,700; 2,100; or 2,500 ms.
General Speed of Processing Measures
Symbol Digit. A computerized coding task was used as a
measure of Gs (see McPherson & Burns, 2005, for a detailed
description of this task). A code table was presented at the
top of the computer screen throughout the task. This com-
prised nine symbols arranged horizontally to which nine dig-
its, presented directly beneath them, were paired. For each
item, one symbol was presented in the center of the computer
screen and participants responded by left clicking the mouse
on its corresponding digit in a 3 × 3 numerical grid posi-
tioned at the bottom of the screen. Subsequent items did not
commence until a correct response was registered. Partici-
pants were required to complete two practice trials correctly
before they proceeded to the test. The outcome measure was
the number of items correctly completed in 2 min.
Audio code (AC). This task was developed to be an auditory
analogue of the Symbol Digit task described above. A code
table was displayed at the top of the computer screen for the
duration of the task, comprising of pictures of eight musical
instruments arranged horizontally, to which one of the num-
bers one through eight was paired. The instruments include a
snare drum, trumpet, guitar, cymbals, piano, bell, harp, and
violin. For each item, the sound of one of the instruments
was presented via headphones at an intensity of 65 dB. Par-
ticipants responded by left clicking the mouse on its corre-
sponding digit in a 2 × 4 numerical response grid positioned
at the bottom of the screen. Subsequent items commenced
after a response was registered. Participants completed two
familiarization phases: In the first, instrument names were
presented and participants clicked on the corresponding
instrument (two trials each) and in the second, instrument
sounds were presented instead of text (two trials each). Fol-
lowing this, participants were required to complete four test
trials for each instrument correctly before they could proceed
to the test phase. The outcome measure was the number of
items correctly completed in 2 min.
Chasing-digits auditory (CD
A
). This was designed to be an
auditory analogue of the digit­digit task used by McPherson
4 SAGE Open
and Burns (2005), which was found to share substantial vari-
ance with Gs marker tests. It incorporated a 3 × 3 numerical
response grid positioned in the center of the computer screen
against a black background. For each item, one of the digits,
one through nine, was presented auditorily to participants via
headphones at an intensity of 65 dB; trial order was pseudo-
randomized with the restriction that no digit could be pre-
sented on successive trials. The participant responded as
quickly and accurately as possible by left clicking the mouse
on the corresponding number in the response grid. Subse-
quent items commenced 200 ms following the response. Par-
ticipants were required to complete 10 correct trials out of 10
before they proceeded to the test. The outcome measure was
the number of items correctly completed in 60 s.
Tone comparisons (TC). This task was developed to be an
auditory analogue of Number Comparisons from the Kit of
Factor-Referenced Cognitive Tests (Ekstrom et al., 1976).
Trials consisted of two sequentially presented tones, which
were identical or differed by either a semitone or tone. Tones
were presented at an intensity of 65 dB, and participants
clicked the on-screen response button "Yes" if they thought
the tones were identical or "No" if they were different. Par-
ticipants were required to complete five correct trials out of
five before they proceeded to the test. The outcome measure
was the number of items correctly completed in 90 s.
Hearing As (HA
S
). This task was an auditory version of the
search task, Finding As (see, for example, Danthiir et al.,
2005; Roberts & Stankov, 1999). In this version, stimuli
were nouns, five to eight letters in length. All words had a
concreteness-of-imagery value of 600 or above, on a scale
ranging from 100 to 700; the lowest value indicated maxi-
mum abstractness and the highest indicated maximum con-
creteness. Of the 60 words, 15 contained the letter "A," and
all of these used the long vowel pronunciation. The purpose
of this was to reduce any potential spelling confusion that
might occur for the short vowel sound--where the pronun-
ciation of the "A" is not as distinct--or in the case of silent
"A." Participants were informed of this restriction.
Words were presented pseudorandomly--one at a time--
at an intensity of 65 dB. To respond, participants pressed the
on-screen button "Yes," if the word contained an "A" or
"No," if it did not. Participants were required to complete
five correct trials out of five before they proceeded to the
test, and practice trials used different stimuli to the test phase.
The outcome measure was the number of items correctly
completed in 90 s.
Visual InspectionTime (VIT)
The vertical lines inspection time task was used to estimate
VIT. Stimuli were presented on a video monitor at a viewing
distance of approximately 60 cm. Preceding the target figure
was a warning cue of approximately 520 ms; the cue was a
small white plus (+) sign measuring 6 × 6 mm presented
in the center of the computer screen. The target figure
consisted of two vertical lines: one measured 15 mm and the
other 30 mm. These were joined at the top by a horizontal
line of approximately 18 mm. The shorter line appeared on
either side of the target figure equiprobably. A "flash mask"
(see Evans & Nettelbeck, 1993) of 375 ms immediately
replaced the target figure and consisted of two vertical lines
35 mm in length, shaped as lightning bolts. Participants
indicated on which side the short line appeared by clicking
either the left or right mouse button, respectively. Practice
trials required 10 correct trials out of 10 with stimulus onset
asynchrony (SOA) of approximately 835 ms, 10 correct tri-
als out of 10 with SOA approximately 420 ms, and 9 correct
trials out of 10 with SOA approximately 250 ms. The esti-
mation process began with SOA approximately 250 ms and
followed an adaptive staircase algorithm (Wetherill &
Levitt, 1965). The average SOA--or mean VIT threshold--
was calculated over eight reversals of direction on the stair-
case, giving an estimate of the SOA with an associated
probability of 79% of making a correct response.
Procedure
On arriving at the testing session, participants were seated in
a cubicle in our laboratory, and they were guided through the
test battery automatically by the computer. Detailed instruc-
tions and practice phases were presented prior to the onset of
each task, and the first author was present to answer any
questions. Participants completed the tasks in the following
order: ART, CD, HA
S,
VIT, AC, ART
2,
TC, ART
3,
Symbol
Digit, and VRT. Each RT task consisted of 60 trials, and the
total testing session lasted for 1 hr and 45 min.
To obtain test­retest reliability estimates for the new
auditory tasks, n = 17 participants returned 6 weeks after the
initial testing session. Because of limited time, participants
completed ART
2
only, along with the new tests AC, CD,
HA
S
, and TC. Test­retest reliability estimates were not
obtained for the VIT task because of time restrictions and
the fact that it is typically good (see Kranzler & Jensen,
1989).
Results
Data Preparation
Outliers (±3 SD) and errors were removed from individual
RT data files and the average number of trials used to calcu-
late RT scores was as follows: ART (M = 58.49, SD = 1.20),
ART
2
(M = 58.33, SD = 1.98), ART
3
(M = 57.35, SD = 2.04),
and VRT (M = 58.58, SD = 0.81). Across the remaining
variables, there were three missing values and eight outliers
(i.e., ±3 SD). These values were deleted and subsequently
imputed using the expectation maximization algorithm in
SPSS v.15.

Reliability Estimates
Table 1 presents reliability estimates for the tasks. Split-half
reliability is presented where possible and test­retest esti-
mates are provided for the auditory measures. As can be
seen, reliability was generally good, with split-half and test­
retest estimates being acceptable for the new auditory mea-
sures.
Descriptive Statistics and Correlations
Table 2 presents the descriptive statistics for the test battery.
Of interest is that, although AC maintained very similar
cognitive requirements to Symbol Digit, the number
of items completed was markedly lower, t(95) = 18.34,
p < .001, d = 1.80. The simple RT tasks showed the opposite
effect, however, with ART performance being significantly
faster than for VRT, t(95) = 7.62, p < .001, d = 0.66.
Table 3 shows the full correlation matrix for all measures.
To summarize, AC and Symbol Digit correlated moderately,
suggesting that they measure a similar construct. The simple
RT tasks--ART and VRT--also correlated strongly. HA
S
,
CD, and TC were developed based on existing Gs marker
tests, and they related weakly to AC and Symbol Digit, and
shared variance with the RT measures also. The RT tasks
generally correlated moderate-to-strongly with each other.
Factor Analysis
As we had developed the auditory measures to be analogous
to existing visual speed tasks, we had explicit expectations
about the factorial structure underpinning the test battery.
Specifically, we expected that RT tasks would define a latent
RT factor and that AC, Symbol Digit, HA
S
, TC, CD, and VIT
would define a latent Gs factor. Despite these hypotheses,
rather than use confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in first
instance, we erred on the side of caution and instead used
exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to assess whether this
expected structure would emerge naturally.
First, we explored the suitability of the data for EFA using
Bartlett's Test of Sphericity, 2(340) = 45.00, p < .001, and
the Measure of Sampling Adequacy (.75), and both showed
that the data were acceptable for EFA. Next, the visual and
auditory speed tasks were entered into a principal compo-
nents analysis. There were two components with eigenvalues
greater than 1 (3.75 and 1.69) accounting for 37.5% and
16.9% of the variance respectively. An inspection of the
scree plot confirmed two dominant factors. Using the eigen-
value and scree criteria as a guide, we extracted two factors
using maximum likelihood estimation with promax rotation.
Table 4 presents the results of these analyses.
As can be seen, the expected structure emerged well.
There is a clear RT factor defined by the visual and auditory
RT measures. There is also a possible speediness (Gs) factor
defined by the remaining visual and auditory speed tasks. Of
interest, although it was assumed that CD would share more
in common with the Gs-type measures, it appears to load
more strongly on the RT factor.
We tested the reliability of this EFA solution in Mplus
(Muthen & Muthen, 1998) using CFA with maximum likeli-
hood estimation. In our first model, we tried to confine CD
to the Gs factor as per our initial expectations, but despite all
tasks having moderate loadings, results showed that the fit of
the model was not adequate, 2(34) = 88.49, p < .001, com-
parative fit index [CFI] = .80, root mean square error of
approximation [RMSEA] = .13, standardized root mean
square residual [SRMR] = .09. Therefore, we followed the
EFA solution with regards to CD as well as the theoretically
sensible suggestion of modification indices to allow the
residuals of ART and VRT to covary. Permitting these
changes in a subsequent model resulted in adequate fit, 2(33)
= 53.13, p = .01, CFI = .93, RMSEA = .08, SRMR = .06.

6 SAGE Open
This model is shown in Figure 1. As can be seen, the correla-
tion between the RT and Gs factors was moderately strong
and in the expected direction. Importantly, loadings of the
visual tasks--Symbol Digit, VIT, and VRT--were as strong
as those for the auditory tasks suggesting that the latent fac-
tors may not be reflecting modality-specific processes.
Discussion
The purpose of the present study was to pilot some newly
developed auditory tasks designed to measure the broad abil-
ity Gs. The tasks were derived from existing paradigms or
were purpose-developed to maintain the cognitive require-
ments of established visually presented Gs marker tests. To
the extent that the auditory tasks were successful measures of
Gs, we expected to find correlations between them and visual
Gs tasks that have typically measured speed of processing.
First, we assessed the reliability of the auditory measures
and found these to be generally acceptable. Of particular
interest were the new auditory measures, with the strong
split-half reliability estimates indicating that the constructs
measured by these tests did not appear to change much dur-
ing the course of completing them. This provides some evi-
dence that item difficulty was consistent within the individual
measures, an important characteristic of speed tasks because
it ensures that performance reflects the rate at which examin-
ees complete the items in the test, rather than item difficulty
(Carroll, 1993). Test­retest reliability estimates were col-
lected approximately 6 weeks after initial testing, and they
were also acceptable, showing that the measurement con-
structs did not alter over this period.
Second, EFA suggested that two latent factors under-
pinned performance on the auditory and visual tasks. Based
on factor loadings, these were identified as latent RT and Gs.
Subsequent confirmatory analysis supported this solution,
and latent RT and Gs factors shared 35% of their variance.
Importantly, the two visual tests loading on Gs (VIT, Symbol
Digit) had moderate loadings of a similar magnitude to the
auditory measures on this factor. Similarly, VRT loaded on
RT moderately and comparably with the three ART tasks.
This suggests that both the Gs and RT factors might not be
reflecting auditory-specific processes because, if this were
so, the loadings of visual tasks on these factors might be
expected to be markedly weaker than those observed herein.
As already noted, these data were collected during a pilot
study of auditory tasks, and consequently, these results
should be considered in light of several limitations. For
example, test­retest reliability estimates were only gathered
for a relatively small subsample of participants. Thus,
although they appeared adequate in the present study in
terms of their magnitude, they need to be replicated in a
larger sample. Similarly, for the CFA undertaken herein, the
present sample of N = 96 should not be considered optimal.
Future investigations of these auditory tasks should increase
sample size to at least N = 200 to ensure these complex pro-
cedures have sufficient statistical power (see, for example,
Barrett, 2007).Based on the above analyses, which showed
that auditory and visual tasks combined to define latent fac-
tors and that the loadings of visual tasks relative to auditory
tasks were comparable, we have speculated that the speed
factors may not be modality specific but rather reflect cogni-
tive processes underpinning performance across all tasks. It
is certainly the case, however, that visual tasks are underrep-
resented in this pilot study, and this is a serious limitation.
The number of visual tasks was limited due to the nature of
this pilot study and in light of time restrictions on participant
testing. Elsewhere, it has been noted that the identification of
latent factors generally requires three or more measures

(Carroll, 1993, p. 52). Thus, it is entirely plausible that dis-
tinct visual speed factors did not emerge during the present
analyses because we did not meet this requirement for the
visual tasks. It is essential that this issue be addressed in
future research by ensuring that a sufficient number of tasks
from each modality are used to permit the identification or
otherwise of modality-specific speed factors. An alternate
method of exploring this issue would include administering
more typical auditory ability (Ga) tests in conjunction with
these auditory speed tasks and examining their shared
variance.
Notwithstanding these limitations, the present study pro-
vides preliminary evidence that broad cognitive abilities
such as general speediness (Gs) might be measurable via
alternate modalities such as audition. It appears that if audi-
tory tasks are designed to engage the same cognitive pro-
cesses as visual tasks, then they should index the same broad
cognitive abilities. These preliminary findings should at least
encourage research into other broad abilities and the extent
to which they might be measured auditorily. Such research
might ultimately result in the development of more "truly
balanced" measures of intelligence (Horn, 1968).
