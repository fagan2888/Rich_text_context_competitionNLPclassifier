The Signaling Theory of Symptoms:
An Evolutionary Explanation of the
Placebo Effect
Leander Steinkopf1
Abstract
Placebo research shows that the subjective quality of care and social support, as well as the patients' expectations of treatment,
influence therapeutic outcomes. However, this phenomenon, known as the placebo effect, does not usually cure the disease, but
rather can provide symptomatic relief: It may soothe symptoms such as pain, swelling, or nausea that constitute part of an immune
response. The function of this mechanism remains unclear. This article puts forward the Signaling Theory of Symptoms (STS) as a
possible explanation. According to STS, discernible aspects of an immune response, such as pain, swelling, or nausea, not only
serve a defensive and healing function but also a signaling function: symptoms signal the need for care and treatment to potential
helpers. Once help and treatment are granted, the signaling function is fulfilled and the symptoms diminish. This mechanism may
have been a significant advantage in preindustrial environments, when sufferers depended on extensive social support and per-
sonal treatment. Nowadays, from the point of view of modern materialist medicine, the mobilization of social support no longer
seems so crucial, and thus the placebo effect has been assigned a somewhat mysterious quality.

Introduction
The placebo effect has been known for a long time and has been
replicated in many studies (Beecher, 1955; Howick et al.,
2013). Originally, the term ``placebo effect'' or ``placebo
response'' stood for an improvement of the patient's clinical
state caused by a physiologically inert treatment (Benedetti,
2014). However, it is not the inert treatment itself, but rather
the meaning that it has for the patient, which causes the effect
(Moerman, 2013; Moerman & Jonas, 2002). Consequently, the
term placebo effect does not refer exclusively to allegedly inert
treatments, such as sugar pills or saline injections, but also
includes other psychosocial aspects of the medical environ-
ment, such as care and a positive doctor­patient relationship
(Benedetti, 2013; Hart & Dieppe, 1996; Kelley, Kraft-Todd,
Schapira, Kossowsky, & Riess, 2014). New terms such as
``meaning response,'' ``contextual healing,'' ``belief effect,''
and ``interpersonal healing'' have been introduced to capture
this broadened understanding of the placebo effect (Chiappedi,
2009; Evans, 2003; Miller, Colloca, & Kaptchuk, 2009; Moer-
man & Jonas, 2002). However, even if the placebo effect can be
powerful, its scope is limited. For example, placebo treatment
may reduce cancer-induced pain, but it cannot cure cancer
itself (Benedetti, 2014). Most of the time, placebo treatment
does not cure the disease, but it reduces the symptoms (Miller
et al., 2009; Spiro, 1997). Furthermore, placebo effectiveness is
limited to certain conditions such as pain, swelling, depression,
and irritable bowel syndrome (Evans, 2005; Howick et al.,
2013; Hro
´bjartsson & Gøtzsche, 2004; Kirsch, 2011; Miller
et al., 2009; Miller & Kaptchuk, 2008). Remarkably, most of
these conditions are aspects of an immune reaction or are at
least closely related to it (Dantzer, O'Connor, Freund, Johnson,
& Kelley, 2008; Evans, 2003, 2005; Hart, 1988; O
¨ hman &
Simr´
en, 2010). Still, it remains an open question as to why

social support and physiologically inert treatments have an
impact on these symptoms (Miller et al., 2009).
This article suggests an answer to this question by introdu-
cing the Signaling Theory of Symptoms (STS). This theory
assumes that easily discernible features of an immune reaction,
namely symptoms such as fever, swelling, apathy, obvious
signs of pain, and so on, not only serve defense and healing
purposes but also signal the need for help and treatment to
potential helpers. The stronger the symptoms, the higher their
signaling efficacy. Therefore, symptoms are exaggerated to
heighten the likelihood of mobilizing help and treatment. Once
help and treatment are received, this signaling function is ful-
filled and the symptoms can diminish.
First, I will give an overview of previous evolutionary the-
ories on the subject in order to provide a basic framework and
draw attention to the open questions. In the following sections,
the adaptive problem of infection and injury will be discussed
as well as the probable adaptive solutions to this problem,
namely the immune system and the help and treatment by
others. Against this background, STS will be introduced and
developed. A further section will assemble empirical evidence
supporting STS, and testable hypotheses will be derived.
Finally, the article will be summarized and some implications
will be elucidated.
Theoretical Background
Placebo research is rather interested in the proximate mechan-
ism of the placebo effect, specifically in how it is mediated
physiologically (Benedetti, 2013). However, research in this
field has yet to answer questions concerning the function which
this mechanism fulfills and, hence, why such a mechanism
exists (Miller et al., 2009).
According to the pain researcher Patrick Wall (1999), pain
is not only an alarm system that informs the sufferer of tissue
damage, but it also motivates appropriate action. Pain can
express the need to withdraw from a harmful situation (e.g., a
hot stove), the need to adopt a relieving posture, or the need to
seek help and treatment. The mere act of providing help and
treatment fulfills the need and allows the pain to fade. Wall's
conception suits the evolutionary perspective well, since he
regards pain as having the function of motivating appropriate
action in case of sickness or injury. According to this theory,
the placebo effect can be seen as one small aspect of this
adaptation, ``[ . . . ] the placebo is not a stimulus but an appro-
priate action'' (Wall, 1999, p. 155). The patient, unaware of the
physiological ineffectiveness of the placebo treatment, believes
that appropriate action has been taken, and thus that the need
state has been fulfilled, hence the pain diminishes. However,
Wall's theory remains restricted to pain and placebo analgesia.
Humphrey (2002, 2004; see also Humphrey & Skoyles,
2012; Trimmer, Marshall, Fromhage, McNamara, & Houston,
2013) puts forward the theory of the ``health management sys-
tem'' or ``health governor.'' Self-healing and defense should not
be an automatic reaction to infection and injury. Rather, they
should be employed selectively after a cost­benefit analysis:
Pain and swelling of the broken ankle should be postponed when
a person is in immediate danger from the proverbial lion. Fight-
ing the flu should be postponed when there are immediate
options for procreation. Moreover, a lack of food and bodily
energy reserves might not allow for a full immune response.
Thus, the regulation of self-healing should be based on a calcu-
lation of costs, opportunity costs, and potential benefits. This
calculation is based on the individual's subjective judgment of
environmental conditions, that is, in the terminology of placebo
research, on expectations. According to Humphrey, the placebo
treatment modifies this cost­benefit analysis--it gives the
impression that it will assist the immune system and in this way,
it improves the prospects of a rapid recovery. The ``health gov-
ernor'' assumes that the circumstances have changed for the
better and allows a full immune response.
Evans (2003) disagrees with Humphrey's thesis, claiming
that the placebo effect is not concerned with enhancing immune
activity but rather with suppressing it. Evans observes that the
placebo-responsive conditions, such as pain, depression, and
irritable bowel syndrome have something in common: They are
each symptoms of an acute-phase response or at least closely
related to it. Evans regards the placebo effect as a special case of
the broad phenomenon of immune conditioning. He refers to
evidence from the respective field, suggesting that immune reac-
tions are up or down regulated, depending on environmental
factors and previous experience. However, Evans finds more
empirical evidence for conditioned immune suppression than for
conditioned immune enhancement. Therefore, he suggests that
immune conditioning might have evolved as a ``[ . . . ] protec-
tive mechanism, to save the immune system from unnecessary
expenditure, and not as a general-purpose learning mechanism to
enable the immune system to respond in any way to any psy-
chological input'' (Evans, 2003, p. 105).
According to Evans, one opportunity to save resources would
occur when effective treatment and care provided by others
contribute to a task that the immune system would otherwise
perform alone. If extensive care and effective medicine have
existed long enough, the selective pressure to save resources
could have shaped a mechanism like the placebo effect. Still,
Evans' theory does not explain what he also tried to claim,
namely why the placebo effect is restricted to symptoms of the
acute-phase response. Evans speculates that in some situations,
it might be adaptive to suppress the acute-phase response in
order to allow an earlier onset of the adaptive immune response.
However, he does not elaborate on this further.
Previous evolutionary theory provides foundations as well
as open questions for further theoretical development. Wall's
theory gives a convincing explanation of pain, but not of other
placebo-responsive conditions. Humphrey's theory applies to
all placebo-responsive conditions, but it does not agree well
with empirical findings. Finally, Evans' theory applies to all
placebo-responsive conditions and is supported by empirical
evidence, but it does not answer the question of why the pla-
cebo effect is restricted to certain symptoms.
The present article will attempt to fill these gaps. Further, it
will try to broaden the focus, so that it not only regards the
2 Evolutionary Psychology
sufferer who is helped and treated but also others who decide
either to help and treat the sufferer or to refrain from doing so.
Specifically, it explains the placebo effect as part of an adaptive
signaling mechanism.
Just like other theories in evolutionary medicine, STS is
based on the assumption that humans are not adapted to their
modern environments, but rather to the hunter-gatherer envi-
ronment, the so-called environment of evolutionary adapted-
ness (Nesse, 2005; Nesse & Williams, 1995; Williams &
Nesse, 1991; Wilson, 1978). As a consequence, in order to
understand the regulation of the immune system, and thus the
placebo effect, it is necessary to identify how the adaptive
problems of illness and injury were solved during human evo-
lution, especially in hunter-gatherer environments.
The Environment of Evolutionary
Adaptedness
The risk of injury and infection has been a crucial adaptive
problem throughout evolutionary history, and the immune sys-
tem developed as its adaptive answer (Nesse & Williams, 1995).
However, an immune reaction also has substantial costs. On the
one hand, there are direct costs, such as higher energy consump-
tion or potential tissue damage due to high fever (Bonneaud
et al., 2003; Eraud, Jacquet, & Faivre, 2009; LeGrand & Alcock,
2012). On the other hand, there are opportunity costs. Immune
system activation is associated with so-called sickness behavior
such as sleepiness, apathy, and social withdrawal, reflecting a
motivational shift away from social, sexual, and aggressive
behavior that allows maximization of immune activity (Aubert,
1999; Dantzer & Kelley, 2007; Hart, 1988). Due to this change
in priorities, sick animals miss out on opportunities for mating,
bonding, and fighting for places in dominance hierarchies. Fur-
ther, avoidant behavior of conspecifics may contribute to these
social costs (Avitsur, Cohen, & Yirmiya, 1997). In certain situa-
tions, opportunity costs are so high that the immune response is
suppressed in order to enable normal behavior (Aubert, Goodall,
Dantzer, & Gheusi, 1997; Lopes, 2014; Lopes et al., 2013;
Lopes, Adelman, Wingfield, & Bentley, 2012; Owen-Ashley
& Wingfield, 2006). For example, male zebra finches whose
immune systems were artificially provoked, display symptoms
of illness when they are housed in a single cage, but when housed
in a group cage, they do not display these symptoms (Lopes
et al., 2012). More specifically, when sick male zebra finches
are in the presence of a female zebra finch, their symptoms
vanish, presumably to enable mating (Lopes et al., 2013).
However, in some species the opportunity costs of an
immune system are partly compensated by support of conspe-
cifics. For example, house sparrows breed in couples and feed
offspring together. When the female shows symptoms of sick-
ness, the male sparrow collects more food to compensate for
her absence (Bonneaud et al., 2003). Hart (1990, 2011) sum-
marizes a series of observational studies about animals helping
sick conspecifics. Female chimpanzees reduced their travel
speed to let a sick group member keep pace. They also took
care of the sick mother's son while she was sleeping. In a group
of wild mongooses, an injured group member was extensively
groomed and even provided with food. While provision of food
to sick group members is observed only in some nonhuman
animals, mutual support in case of sickness or injury is a crucial
part of life in human hunter-gatherer societies and, moreover,
some have conjectured that this social support is one of the
reasons for human longevity (Gurven, Stieglitz, Hooper,
Gomes, & Kaplan, 2012; Sugiyama, 2004).
In contemporary hunter-gatherer societies, injuries and sick-
nesses that temporarily keep a group member from gathering
and hunting are common (Gurven, Allen-Arave, Hill, &
Hurtado, 2000; Hagen, Hames, Craig, Lauer, & Price, 2003;
Hill & Hurtado, 2009; Sugiyama, 2004; Sugiyama & Chacon,
2000). However, the resulting temporary inability to join hunt-
ing or foraging does not result in the starvation of the sick
persons, since their absence from foraging is buffered by the
group. Sick and injured group members are provided with food
(Gurven et al., 2000; Sugiyama, 2004; Sugiyama & Chacon,
2000), notably, without the possibility of direct reciprocity
from the sick person (Sugiyama, 2004; Sugiyama & Chacon,
2000; Tooby & Cosmides, 1996). The altruistic act of sharing
food might be explained through delayed reciprocity or
improved reputation on the part of the donor (Hawkes, 1991;
Nesse, 2007; Sugiyama & Chacon, 2000; Tooby & Cosmides,
1996). Thus, helping can be an honest signal of mate quality
and worthiness as a cooperation partner (Barclay, 2012, 2013;
Barclay & Willer, 2007; Fehrler & Przepiorka, 2013; Gintis,
Smith, & Bowles, 2001; McAndrew & Perilloux, 2012;
Sylwester & Roberts, 2013). Helping can also signal indispen-
sability and act as ``insurance'' against the helpers themselves
becoming sick or injured (Gurven et al., 2000; Jaeggi &
Gurven, 2013; Sugiyama & Sugiyama, 2003). In fact, group
members who distributed more food when in a healthy con-
dition receive more support when they are sick (Gurven et al.,
2000; Sugiyama, 2004; Sugiyama & Chacon, 2000).
Further, humans have probably had knowledge of simple
medical treatments since the time of homo neanderthalensis.
There is a wide range of effective herbal medicines and it is
possible that some of these might have been in use in ancient
hunter-gatherer societies (Halberstein, 2005). Flowers found in a
Neanderthal grave have remarkable medical efficacy and might
have been chosen as a funerary object on this basis (Lietava,
1992). The use of red ochre is well-documented among Nean-
derthals across Europe (Roebroeks et al., 2012). Besides for per-
sonaldecorationandcave paintings,redochreisusedformedical
purposes by modern hunter-gatherers and this might also have
been the case for Neanderthals (Roebroeks et al., 2012; Velo,
1984). The iron salts in red ochre are antiseptic, can arrest bleed-
ing, and promote the healing of wounds (Velo, 1984).
Further treatments are imaginable, since symptoms have
clear demand characteristics: a feverish head demands cooling
and a shivering body warmth. Cooling a feverish head could
protect the brain from overheating, despite a high fever in the
rest of the body. Shivering serves the function of creating heat,
and warming may contribute to this adaptive reaction. So, in
humans, the opportunity costs, as well as the direct costs of an
Steinkopf 3
immune response, are partly compensated by social support
and treatment.
Still, it is important to note that some kinds of help and
treatment can be counterproductive. For example, consuming
iron-rich food counteracts the body's strategy of sequestrating
iron to limit bacterial growth (Nesse & Williams, 1995; Wein-
berg, 1984). Similarly, certain lipoproteins serve, on the one
hand, for the transport of lipids in the blood and, on the other
hand, aid the functioning of the immune system (Adamo, Bar-
tlett, Le, Spencer, & Sullivan, 2010; Steiner & Romanovsky,
2007). Thus, a low intake of fat could assist the immune sys-
tem, whereas high fat consumption could counteract proper
immune functioning (Adamo et al., 2010). Also, soothing
symptoms such as fever may relieve suffering but at the same
time may undermine the immune reaction (Nesse & Williams,
1995). This problem of counterproductive treatment might be
partly solved by the sufferer's feelings toward the help that is
granted, for example disgust toward fatty or iron-rich food.
Symptoms as Cues
Providing support for sick or injured group members requires
others to detect them. Therefore, the seemingly trivial question
arises of how sickness and injury are detected. Some injuries
can be perceived directly either visually (e.g., blood loss) or
haptically (e.g., the unusual mobility of broken bones). Infec-
tions, however, can only be directly perceived through modern
means: Microscopes make bacteria visible, and antibody tests
provide evidence for the presence of certain viruses. Without
these modern means, humans have had to rely and still rely on
symptoms to detect sickness in people. Accordingly, what we
perceive as a sickness in everyday life is not the presence of an
infection itself but the easily discernible symptoms, such as
pain, fever, cough, sneezing, shivering, loss of appetite, and
so on. Notably, these symptoms are not caused by the infection
itself but are part of the body's response to the infection. This
immune reaction obviously functions as a defense against the
infection, as in the example of fever, which creates an uncom-
fortable situation for pathogens, or coughing and sneezing,
which expels them. However, as elucidated above, some
aspects of this immune reaction are discernible to other group
members: They provide cues which render the sickness percep-
tible. In other words, an immune reaction not only fulfills the
function of a defense against infections but also, as a bypro-
duct, produces discernible symptoms that inform other group
members about the need for help and treatment. Along the
same lines, Thornhill and Thornhill (1989) suggest that psy-
chological pain has a dual function. On the one hand, psycho-
logical pain drives the individual's attention to the source of
pain, motivates introspective analysis and, in this way, might
lead to a solution. On the other hand, psychological pain serves
as a social display of need. Also, Wall regards pain as a need
state that drives the sufferer's attention to a possible solution.
At the same time, without elaborating on it, Wall makes it clear
that pain has two sides: ``private pain and public display''
(Wall, 1999, p. 1).
Cues Becoming Signals
Once the tendency to help the sick appeared in evolutionary
history, discernible symptoms of an immune reaction no longer
had only a defensive function but also happened to act as cues
for potential helpers to discover sick individuals. It might be
reasonable to assume that individuals differed in their symptom
structure, for example, the peak of their fever, the expression of
their pain, the intensity of coughing and sneezing, and so on. As
individual immune systems differ in their defensive effective-
ness, the discernible symptom structure of immune reactions
might also differ in their effectiveness as cues. Some individ-
uals might have had a symptom structure that mobilized sup-
port more effectively, while others had symptoms that were
less effective in mobilizing help. The former had an evolution-
ary advantage over the latter since, as described above, mobi-
lizing help is crucial for survival. This would result in a
selection pressure for more effective cues. Thus, the immune
system, alongside its defensive function, was also selected for a
symptom structure that most effectively elicits support from the
group. According to the terminology of Williams (1966) and
Gould and Vrba (1982), the discernible symptoms of an
immune reaction form part of the immune system, that is, a
complex set of adaptations for the function of defense, but the
discernible symptoms are also an exaptation with the effect of
mobilizing help. Thus, there is a second selection pressure for
better cues of sickness, which causes the symptoms to turn into
a secondary adaptation for this function. However, the initial
defense function persists, making the discernible symptoms an
adaptation which serves two ultimate functions: defense and
providing cues. The symptoms are now also signals, since they
are shaped by evolution for a communicative purpose.
Presumably, stronger symptoms provide more convincing
signals than weaker symptoms. Thus, higher fever, stronger
appearance of pain, louder sneezing and coughing, worse ane-
mia, more obvious nausea, and so on should mobilize the most
social support. The symptom strength optimal for mobilizing
help is probably higher than the optimal symptom strength for
defense. Thus, symptoms should be exaggerated above the
level that is optimal for defense to improve the chances of
receiving social support. Similarly, Trivers (1974) suggests that
crying by young infants is not only a cue for need but an
exaggerated signal to extract more resources from the parents
than they would otherwise give. However, in some severe dis-
eases, optimal symptom strength might be so high that exag-
geration is neither necessary nor feasible.
In summary, I suggest that discernible symptoms serve two
functions: defense and signaling the need for help. The two
functions result in a trade-off. Optimal signaling means subopti-
mal defense, while optimal defense means suboptimal signaling.
In general, trade-offs are a common reason for the imperfections
of the human body (Nesse, 2005; Nesse & Williams, 1995;
Williams & Nesse, 1991). The double function of discernible
symptoms is based on an evolutionary path dependency: a con-
straint in the terminology of evolutionary medicine (Nesse,
2005; Nesse & Williams, 1995; Williams & Nesse, 1991).
4 Evolutionary Psychology
Costly, and Thus, Honest Signals
Generous social support usually entails the problem of free
riders, which, within the scope of this article, refers to people
faking sickness. However, the symptom signals are quite dif-
ficult to fake, since they are highly costly for the sender. First,
discernible symptoms like fever are costly in terms of energy
(Benhariz, Goulet, Salas, Colomb, & Ricour, 1997; Kluger,
1989; Stettler, Schutz, Whitehead, & Jequier, 1992) and they
become more costly the more exaggerated they become. Sec-
ond, the symptoms not only harm the pathogens but also the
body itself (Eraud et al., 2009; LeGrand & Alcock, 2012).
Likewise, they do more harm the more they are exaggerated.
Third, being sick has opportunity costs which arise from typical
sickness behavior: fatigue, lack of sexual interest, and loss of
appetite (Dantzer & Kelley, 2007; Hart, 1988). A sick person
refrains from social activities that might provide a pay-off in
terms of reputation, rank, or mating opportunities. In short,
transmitting convincing signals of sickness is highly costly and
likely only pays off for those who are really in need of help, not
for those who only aim to take time off on full board.
These costs also limit the exaggeration of the symptoms for
the sake of signaling. This can be illustrated by an imaginary
hunter-gatherer band that features several sick members at the
same time. In this case, the sick individuals compete for the
help of others. Other factors being constant (like the respective
sick individual's reputation or importance within the group),
the sick individual will probably receive more support the nee-
dier they appear to be, that is, the stronger the symptoms they
display. However, other factors being constant (like the energy
reserves of the respective sick individual), the sick individuals
should only invest as much in the signaling as the hoped-for
help is worth. Thus, again, even exaggerated symptoms are a
reliable signal for the need for help. Costly signals are honest
signals (Spence, 1973; Veblen, 1899; Zahavi, 1977; Zahavi &
Zahavi, 1996).
Cost and Benefits of Helping
For the sufferer, sending convincing signals of sickness is
highly costly. And for potential helpers, altruistic behavior is
costly in terms of the time and resources it takes to feed and
treat the sick and to absolve the sick of other duties. Further-
more, contact with individuals who carry parasites bears the
risk of contagion. In fact, close contact with sick conspecifics,
as compared to contact with, for example sick animals or rotten
food, is especially risky, because parasites are adapted to par-
ticular species (Curtis, 2014).
There is a great deal of research on adaptations to the risk of
contagion, among them the tendency to avoid sick conspeci-
fics. This body of research predominantly deals with the emo-
tion of disgust within the theoretical framework of the
behavioral immune system (Curtis, Aunger, & Rabie, 2004;
Curtis, de Barra, & Aunger, 2011; Oaten, Stevenson, & Case,
2009; Schaller & Park, 2011; Tybur, Lieberman, Kurzban, &
DeScioli, 2013). This behavioral immune system is so sensitive
that it not only reacts to contagious conspecifics but also to
noncontagious deviations from the norm, such as facial disfig-
urements, overweightness, old age, and physical disabilities
(Duncan & Schaller, 2009; Lieberman, Tybur, & Latner,
2012; Park, Faulkner, & Schaller, 2003; Park, Schaller, &
Crandall, 2007; Ryan, Oaten, Stevenson, & Case, 2012).
However, there are some factors that mitigate the drive to
avoid sick conspecifics. First, disgust and avoidance are
weaker when considering familiar people and in-group mem-
bers, as compared to out-group members and strangers (Case,
Repacholi, & Stevenson, 2006; Curtis et al., 2004; Peng,
Chang, & Zhou, 2013). This makes sense from the standpoint
of pathogen avoidance, since strangers are more likely to carry
novel pathogens for which the immune system is not yet pre-
pared (Fincher & Thornhill, 2012; Navarrete & Fessler, 2006;
Stevenson & Repacholi, 2005). Second, the fast automatic
reaction of avoidance can be overridden by a slow, controlled,
and rule-based process that takes into account social norms and
social pressure (Kleck, 1969; Kleck, Ono, & Hastorf, 1966;
Pryor, Reeder, Yeadon, & Hesson-McInnis, 2004; Stone &
Potton, 2014). One of these social norms might be to help sick
group members (Schaller, 2011). Also, helping the sick might
be rewarded with especially high social prestige (Schaller,
2011). In fact, helping the sick greatly improves reputation,
as reflected in the especially high reputation of members of
the medical professions. Rankings of occupational prestige in
the United States show physicians ranking first and nurses fifth,
while similarly, in Germany, physicians rank first and nurses
second (Institut fu
¨r Demoskopie Allensbach, 2013; Pollack,
2014).
Furthermore, a sick group member could put pressure on
other group members who are dependent. Sharing a similar
basis, the ``social navigation hypothesis'' (Watson & Andrews,
2002) and the ``bargaining model of depression'' (Hagen, 1999,
2002, 2003, 2011; see also Rosenstrom, 2013) explain self-
harming behavior in depression from drug abuse to suicide
attempts. In interdependent relationships, like the family or a
foraging group, harming oneself also imposes costs on others:
Other people who usually depend on or cooperate with the
depressed individual are left to their own devices when the
self-harmer is injured or dead. In this way, self-harming beha-
vior on the part of the depressed individual can put pressure on
family or group members to help.
Similarly, exaggerated symptoms may also mobilize help by
putting pressure on potential helpers. Exaggerated symptoms
may not only be costly to the bearer but they may also impose
costs on others who depend on the well-being of the sufferer.
Overly exaggerated symptoms are a kind of self-harming beha-
vior that might serve an extortive function to elicit social sup-
port from dependent others.
The Regulation of Signaling Symptoms
One of the primary functions of the immune response, and also
its discernible symptoms, is fighting pathogens. When the
infection is eliminated, this defensive function is fulfilled and
Steinkopf 5
the immune reaction can thus diminish. The same should be
true for the hypothesized secondary function, the signaling
function of symptoms. Signaling symptoms have high costs
in terms of energy and create the risk of tissue damage. There-
fore, the signaling symptoms should not be continued longer
than necessary. As soon as the status of sickness is acknowl-
edged by the group, once support and treatment is granted, the
signaling function is fulfilled and the immune reaction can
diminish. As described above, Wall (1999) claims that the mere
act of giving help and treatment fulfills the need and allows the
pain to fade. From the perspective of STS, the same might be
true for any other discernible symptom.
But how does an individual judge (consciously or uncon-
sciously) whether it has been supported and treated properly
and, in this way, whether the signaling function of the immune
system has been fulfilled? Medical research provides informa-
tion about the state of the art of treatment for the respective
disease and thus makes clear which kind of treatment the sick
person should be satisfied with. However, the human body has
not yet adapted to modern circumstances, but rather to the
environment of evolutionary adaptedness (Nesse & Williams,
1995; Williams & Nesse, 1991; Wilson, 1978). The regulation
of the signaling symptoms may therefore still be largely cali-
brated for a Stone Age environment.
It is not known exactly how medical treatment was in the
Paleolithic age, but two self-evident assumptions can be made.
First, there was no machinery, so any kind of treatment was
done by people and always involved social contact with famil-
iar group members. Second, just like any other part of culture,
medication and rituals of treatment probably changed over time
and differed between groups. The human need for help and
treatment in case of sickness should be shaped accordingly.
As there was no effective treatment without extensive personal
care, humans should have a universal need for personal care in
case of sickness. As medication and rituals of treatment dif-
fered between times and groups, humans should have a variable
need for medication and treatment that is shaped by their
respective medical culture. The regulation of signaling symp-
toms should be calibrated accordingly. On the one hand, there
should be a general response to social support. On the other
hand, there should be a rather open response, based on the
beliefs of effectiveness of the sick person, shaped by the
respective cultural environment.
Empirical Support for the STS
The STS assumes that discernible symptoms of an immune
reaction serve a second function alongside defense and healing:
namely, signaling the need for help and treatment. Discernible
symptoms, such as swelling, apathy, loss of appetite, and the
obvious distress of pain, signal to others the need for support
and treatment. These symptoms are exaggerated to enhance the
signaling efficacy and, in turn, to more reliably mobilize social
support and treatment. Once social support and treatment are
granted, the signaling function is fulfilled and the signaling
symptoms may decline. However, this need for help and
treatment is shaped by the selective pressures of the environ-
ment of evolutionary adaptedness. First, due to a lack of med-
ical machinery, any treatment had to be performed by people,
and sufferers were thus selected for the demand for personal
help by actual humans. Second, medical cultures differed
between tribes and changed over time, so humans were selected
for flexible treatment demands depending on the respective
medical culture.
Precisely these two factors--a general response to social
support and an open response based on individual beliefs of
effectiveness--can be found in empirical studies of the placebo
effect. Two factors trigger the placebo effect: on the one hand,
care and social support (Benedetti, 2013; Kelley et al., 2014;
Miller et al., 2009) and, on the other, the patient's expectation
of amelioration (Benedetti et al., 2003; Stewart-Williams &
Podd, 2004).
For example, an early study on the placebo effect used an
ultrasound device designed to reduce swellings caused by
dental treatment (Hashish, Hai, Harvey, Feinmann, & Harris,
1988). The subjects were treated with the device, and the
swelling was reduced, even when the device was turned
off--a placebo effect. The placebo effect, however, was
found only when an experimenter administered the device
to the patient. It did not work when the subject used it alone.
This finding points to the significance of social support for the
placebo effect. From the point of view of STS, the excessive
swelling was a signaling symptom that had fulfilled its func-
tion once someone helped the sufferer. The function was not
fulfilled when the sufferer administered the treatment alone,
in which case the excessive swelling prevailed. In a much
more recent study, intranasal administration of oxytocin has
been shown to increase the analgesic effect of a placebo oint-
ment applied to the forearm (Kessner, Sprenger, Wrobel,
Wiech, & Bingel, 2013). Oxytocin increases trust (Kosfeld,
Heinrichs, Zak, Fischbacher, & Fehr, 2005), and in this case it
probably raised the subject's trust in the doctor applying the
placebo ointment (Kessner et al., 2013). In the view of STS,
signaling symptoms should continue as long as the sufferer
distrusts the potential helper's intentions. By raising trust, oxy-
tocin may change the appraisal of the situation in such a way
that the signaling functions seem to be fulfilled. Similarly, the
facial expression of potential helpers might also change the
appraisal of the situation. Presenting facial expressions to the
subject alters the magnitude of the placebo effect in placebo
analgesia (Valentini, Martini, Lee, Aglioti, & Iannetti, 2014). A
sad face enhances the placebo effect when compared to a neu-
tral face, but a happy face enhances the placebo effect even
more. This makes sense in view of STS, since a sad face indi-
cates that a potential helper empathizes with the sufferer, which
can be seen as a precondition of helping. A happy face can be
seen as an indicator that help is very likely.
Helping included physical contact in the environment of
evolutionary adaptedness (EEA). In contemporary medicine,
treatments rarely include touching as part of the treatment
itself. However, even the slight physical contact typical of
medical settings can soothe pain (Fishman, Turkheimer, &
6 Evolutionary Psychology
Degood, 1995). Still, there seems to be a demand for treatments
which involve greater physical contact: Many alternative and
complementary treatments feature ``light touch þ a healing
meaning'' (Kerr et al., 2011, p. 785). Acupuncture, for exam-
ple, involves significant physical contact and causes a strong
placebo effect (Kaptchuk et al., 2006, 2008). From the perspec-
tive of STS, these treatments satisfy the patient's general need
for helping through physical contact. Once this need is ful-
filled, the signaling symptoms can diminish. These examples
show that the humane aspects of medicine are crucial for
patients' well-being. This observation does not fit with con-
temporary approaches to medicine, which are entirely materi-
alist, but it fits perfectly well with STS.
The STS further suggests that there is a flexible component
of immune regulation that adapts to developments and cultural
differences. Patients can learn which treatment is effective and
then develop a placebo effect according to this belief. Accord-
ingly, the advertising of a drug--a kind of manipulative teach-
ing--enhances the drug's placebo effect (Kamenica, Naclerio,
& Malani, 2013). Similarly, a patient can learn that a treatment
is effective from a doctor who is convinced of its effectiveness
and, in this way, can exhibit a placebo effect (Gracely, Dubner,
Deeter, & Wolskee, 1985). From the perspective of STS, the
advertisements or the authority of the doctor teaches the patient
which treatment is effective and, therefore, the signaling symp-
toms diminish once the patient receives the respective treat-
ment. The patients can also learn from their own experiences:
Classical conditioning is one of the main mechanisms of the
placebo effect (Benedetti et al., 2003; Stewart-Williams &
Podd, 2004). Furthermore, culture influences the placebo
effect: For 30 years, the placebo effect of antidepressant med-
ication has increased while the treatment effect remained the
same (Undurraga & Baldessarini, 2012; Walsh, Seidman,
Sysko, & Gould, 2002). This can be interpreted as an effect
of learning on a large scale. Slowly, antidepressants have
become a part of popular medical culture and it has become
a standard means of treating depressed moods (Kirsch, 2011;
Moerman, 2013). From the point of view of STS, patients have
learned that antidepressants are an appropriate treatment, and
thus signaling symptoms are regulated accordingly. Taken
together, these examples show that people can learn the mean-
ing, the significance and, in this way, the expectation of med-
ical treatments through advertisement, authorities, and their
own experiences. The placebo effect, and hence the regulation
of signaling symptoms, adapts to the current medical culture
through these mechanisms, as reflected in the growing placebo
effect of antidepressants.
This section has shown that STS fits well with the empirical
findings of placebo research. In a modern medical environment
that owes its advances to a materialist way of thinking, it seems
puzzling that patients should respond to treatments that do not
have direct physiological effects. However, from the perspec-
tive of the STS, the much-discussed but nevertheless poorly
understood placebo effect is an adaptation to a medical envi-
ronment where the social component was much more important
for adequate treatment.
Predictions and Testable Hypotheses
The STS assumes that discernible symptoms not only serve
defense and healing purposes but also the signaling of a need
for help and treatment. Accordingly, signaling makes sense
when there are recipients of the signals. Therefore, STS pre-
dicts that the exaggeration of the immune reaction should
rather take place in the presence of potential helpers.
Hypothesis 1: Patients should show stronger symptoms in a
social environment as compared to in isolation.
The hypothesized exaggeration of symptoms within a social
environment depends on the behavior of the people who are
present. The symptoms should only be exaggerated as long as
the other people are passive and do not demonstrate acknowl-
edgment of the status of the sick individual. Once they
acknowledge the status and start helping, the signaling symp-
toms have fulfilled their function and may diminish.
Hypothesis 2: When other people acknowledge the status of
the sick individual and start helping, then the symptoms
should diminish.
When there is only one sick individual, it is sufficient to
convince the helpers of the sickness status. However, when
there are more sick individuals and helpers are scarce, compe-
tition among the sick individuals would emerge for the support
of potential helpers, thus symptoms should be even stronger.
Hypothesis 3: The more sick individuals compete for help
and the more scarce potential helpers are, the stronger the
expression of symptoms of sick individuals should be.
However, the idea that symptoms serve as signals applies
only to discernible symptoms. It does not make sense to exag-
gerate aspects of the immune response that potential helpers do
not notice. Fever, anemia, cough, and sneezing are easily dis-
cernible, while the concentration of antibodies is not.
Hypothesis 4: The aforementioned hypotheses (Hypotheses
1­3) should only be valid for easily discernible symptoms
but not for indiscernible aspects of the immune reaction.
When testing this last hypothesis, the fact that different
aspects of the immune system are closely interrelated must
be taken into account. Different symptoms and sickness beha-
viors, such as fever, swelling, and pain, loss of appetite, loss of
sexual interest, and apathy, usually come together and they are
of course highly correlated with the high cytokine levels that
are causing them. For example, there is a reliable placebo effect
for the treatment of stomach ulcers, which would seem to con-
tradict STS. However, stomach ulcers are an inflammatory
disease and, therefore, include other discernible symptoms
such as nausea, loss of appetite, and abdominal pain. Similarly,
depression is hypothesized to be an inflammatory disease,
though in this case the cardinal signs of inflammation such as
swelling, redness, and heat are not visible. Nevertheless,
Steinkopf 7
sickness behaviors, such as apathy, tiredness, and loss of sexual
interest, are very well discernible. So, it might be difficult to
separate the discernible from the undiscernible aspects of the
immune response.
Further, symptoms suitable for signaling should not only be
discernible, they should also cause the least disgust and avoid-
ance in potential helpers. Natural selection should have favored
those symptoms for signaling that most reliably motivated oth-
ers to help, and at the same time prevented disgust that could
counteract this motivation.
Hypothesis 5: The placebo effect should rather be found in
symptoms that do not elicit disgust in potential helpers.
This hypothesis has the same difficulties as the previous
one, as different symptoms that elicit more or less disgust are
correlated. Also, there is no research that compares the degree
of disgust that different symptoms elicit. Still, the theory of the
behavioral immune systems suggests that disgust should be
strongest when infection is most likely. So, symptoms of pain
and depression should be suitable signals. Accordingly, these
are also the symptoms that show the most reliable placebo
effects. Following the assumption further, coughing and sneez-
ing should be less suitable signs, as they bear the risk of droplet
infection. Still, coughing and sneezing can be viable signals as
long as they are only used when the potential helper is distant,
but suppressed when the helper comes closer. Conversely,
fever would be a better signal when potential helpers are close,
because fever is not recognizable from afar and it does not raise
the risk of infection. Following this line of thought, the previ-
ous hypothesis can be further specified.
Hypothesis 6a: When helpers are distant, the sufferer
should have strong symptoms that are recognizable from
far, such as noises like sneezing, coughing, and cries of pain.
Hypothesis 6b: When helpers are close, the sufferer should
not have symptoms that raise the risk of infection of poten-
tial helpers, such as coughing and sneezing. Instead, the
sufferer should have strong symptoms, such as fever, that
are recognizable from close proximity and that do not raise
the risk of infection.
Finally, STS has comparative implications. Signaling need
for care makes only sense in species where care for the sick can
be found. Notably, this hypothesis is not about the presence of a
placebo effect in these species as the placebo effect found in
animals is usually based on classical conditioning.
Hypothesis 7: Signaling symptoms should only be found in
species, where care of the sick can be found.
Accordingly, the most complex regulation patterns of symp-
toms of sickness can be found in highly social species (Hen-
nessy, Deak, & Schiml, 2014). However, as mentioned above,
the evidence of care for sick conspecifics in species other than
humans is scarce. Therefore, the hypothesis might be limited to
the comparison of humans with other species. The idea of
Hypothesis 7 could apply to further species when it is translated
from a comparative into a developmental hypothesis. Maternal
care is much more common in nonhuman species than care for
the sick is. Therefore, young animals could have signaling
symptoms to extract more maternal care.
Hypothesis 8: In species that show maternal care, but not
care for sick adults, signaling symptoms should be found in
young animals but not in adults.
Conclusion
According to the STS, the human immune system is adapted to
Paleolithic times, when medical care consisted of different
kinds of social support and when, in case of illness, it was
crucial to mobilize this help. Thus, openly discernible aspects
of an immune reaction's symptoms have not only been natu-
rally selected for defense but also for their signaling effective-
ness. They are exaggerated to mobilize help. Exaggerated
symptoms are trustworthy because they are costly. Further-
more, some exaggerated symptoms can be interpreted as a
self-harming behavior on the part of the sufferer, which may
extort help from interdependent group members. When support
and treatment are granted, the function of the signal is fulfilled,
and the immune reaction can decrease to the intensity level that
is optimal for defense.
STS serves as a theoretical explanation of the placebo effect.
Placebo treatment, a good patient­physician relationship, as
well as treatments from complementary and alternative medi-
cine might be effective by granting the social support sick
humans are selected to demand. Still, STS does not compete
with other evolutionary theories of the placebo effect, such as
Humphrey's model of the ``health governor.'' The two theories
are not mutually exclusive, but complementary, since the term
placebo effect probably subsumes numerous different mechan-
isms (Benedetti, Carlino, & Pollo, 2010).
The STS points to the importance of social support for
soothing signaling symptoms and, in this way, promoting
well-being and health. In contemporary society, social interac-
tion is an increasingly less important aspect of medical exam-
ination and treatment. Certainly, modern medicine can
ascertain and treat the material causes of illnesses more effec-
tively than ever before, but at the same time, it no longer fulfills
the social needs of patients (Hart & Dieppe, 1996). According
to STS, however, these social needs are a crucial part of the
regulation of the immune system. Just as symptoms persist
when their material cause is not treated, symptoms might also
persist when the cause is treated but the evolutionarily shaped
need for help and interpersonal treatment is left unsatisfied.
The assumptions of the STS could also be developed into an
explanation of chronic symptoms that do not seem to have a
real material cause, such as chronic pain or irritable bowel
syndrome. A hypothetical example for the development of irri-
table bowel syndrome from the perspective of STS could be the
following: Due to a false alarm of the immune system, a person
8 Evolutionary Psychology
develops symptoms of abdominal pain and discomfort. The
person's spouse does not take the complaints seriously, and the
doctor rejects the person's worries about the abdominal pain, a
second doctor does the same, and so does a third. In fact, the
doctors are right in their diagnoses but they do not satisfy the
patient's social need. With each doctor the symptoms worsen,
because the signal strength does not seem to suffice to convince
potential helpers. The person becomes accustomed to the per-
sistently unsatisfied social need and, hence, might end up
developing chronic symptoms, even though a simple acknowl-
edgment and social support might have soothed symptoms at
the outset. In the end, the person is treated by a spiritual healer,
who takes every complaint seriously, if only to earn money
from the patient. Here, the person's symptoms are finally
acknowledged and treated interpersonally. Finally, the signal-
ing function is fulfilled and the symptoms soothed.
Certainly, it is no solution to shut down medical labs and
switch off medical devices to compensate for this social deficit.
Nonetheless, the STS suggests that social support and a good
doctor­patient relationship is an important supplement for
treatment in the paradigm of western medicine. This position
is nothing new, and in fact it is quite common sense. Empiri-
cally, it is based on overwhelming evidence (Benedetti, 2013;
Hart & Dieppe, 1996). Theoretically, however, it has received
little support outside of humane arguments. The STS shows
that these ``soft factors'' are crucial for some conditions, rather
than just decorative accessory of the materialist approach. By
connecting these ``soft factors'' to evolutionary medicine, STS
provides the opportunity to argue for them from a more solid
scientific foundation.
