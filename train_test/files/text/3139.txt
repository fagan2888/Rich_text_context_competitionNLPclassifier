Teachers and administrators in many K-12 schools are no
longer exclusively responsible for ensuring that students are
behaving and attending class. They are often assisted by
school resource officers (SROs) who are sworn law enforce-
ment personnel deployed in schools. Indeed, it is estimated
that as many as one half of public schools in the United
States have at minimum a part-time police presence
(Raymond, 2010), with additional estimates suggesting that
as many as 17,000 SROs are employed nationwide (James &
McCallion, 2013). The recent school shooting incident at
Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut has resulted
in a further push for the placement of police officers in
schools (Brenchley, 2013), particularly in elementary schools
where a police presence has been rare (e.g., Na & Gottfredson,
2013). Research suggests that students and school personnel
view SROs favorably (Watkins & Maume, 2012), but there
are still prevailing questions in the literature about the pre-
cise role of SROs and their preparedness to work in an edu-
cational environment (Cray & Weiler, 2011).
The current study focuses on SROs by reviewing news
articles reporting on the nature of criminal acts committed by
school police officers. It is argued that police officers are
more likely to be compliant when their purpose is well
defined and they are sufficiently prepared to complete this
function (Manning, 1977). There is some contention--
largely found in the debate surrounding the "school-to-
prison" pipeline--that SROs can suffer from role ambiguity
and are insufficiently prepared to work with young persons
in a school setting (e.g., Fowler, Lightsey, Monger, &
Aseltine, 2010; Mukherjee, 2007; Petteruti, 2011). SROs
therefore represent an important segment of law enforcement
to study officer misconduct. Very few studies have system-
atically focused on the behavior of SROs despite the wide-
spread use of these police personnel.
The Presence of Police Officers in
Schools
Sworn police officers have long served a role in schools.
Lambert and McGinty (2002) noted that prior to the 1950s
police officers were periodically invited to schools to instruct
students on traffic and bicycle safety. Police officers assumed
a more permanent role in some schools beginning primarily
in the 1950s and 1960s (Patterson, 2007). Schools in cities
such as Flint (MI) and Miami (FL) established at that time
what are now referred to as "School Resource Officer
Programs" (Lambert & McGinty, 2002; Patterson, 2007;
Streater, 2008). These programs place sworn police officers
in schools on a full- or part-time basis with the primary goal
of improving the safety of students and school personnel
(Kupchik & Monahan, 2006).
The number of schools with a full- or part-time police
presence has grown dramatically since the 1970s (Raymond,
2010; Watkins & Maume, 2012). During the 1995-1996
school year, for instance, there were 243 SROs employed in

The Nature of Crime by School Resource
Officers: Implications for SRO Programs
Philip Matthew Stinson Sr.1 and Adam M. Watkins1
Abstract
School resource officers (SROs) have become a permanent presence in many K-12 schools throughout the country. As a
result, an emerging body of research has focused on SROs, particularly on how SROs are viewed by students, teachers,
and the general public. This exploratory and descriptive research uses a different focus by examining the nature of crimes
for which SROs were arrested in recent years with information gathered from online news sources. The current findings
are encouraging insofar as they reveal that SROs are rarely arrested for criminal misconduct. When SROs were arrested,
however, they are most often arrested for a sex-related offense involving a female adolescent. These sex-related incidents
generally occurred away from school property or during nonschool hours and rarely involved the use of physical force. The
implications of these findings for SRO programs are discussed.

North Carolina public schools. Thirteen years later, the num-
ber of SROs assigned to work in North Carolina public
schools had increased more than threefold to 849 (Center for
the Prevention of School Violence, n.d.). A comparable pat-
tern has emerged nationally. In 1999, 54% of all students
aged 12 to 18 who completed the School Crime Supplement
(SCS) to the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)
reported the presence of security guards and/or police offi-
cers in their school. By 2007, this number had increased to
nearly 70% (Robers, Kemp, & Truman, 2013). Na and
Gottfredson (2013) similarly found that more than 60% of
urban and suburban high-school principals reported that at
least one full-time SRO was stationed at their school during
the 2007-2008 academic year. The most recent data from the
Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics
(LEMAS) survey found that there were more than 17,000
SROs deployed in public schools nationwide in 2007 (James
& McCallion, 2013).
There is some indication that the placement of police offi-
cers in schools has slowed since the early 2000s due to stag-
nate or shrinking funds. The Office of Community Policing
Services (COPS) served as a federal funding source for
SROs starting in 1999. Na and Gottfredson (2013) noted that
"as of July 2005, COPS has awarded in excess of $753 mil-
lion to more than 3,000 grantees to hire more than 6,500
SROs" (p. 621). May, Hart, and Ruddell (2011) indicated,
however, that in recent years, the COPS Office made other
funding areas a priority. Indeed, the COPS Office ended its
Cops in Schools (CIP) program during the 2005 fiscal year
and the use of federal funds to hire school security personnel
through the Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities
Act ended during the 2009 fiscal year (James & McCallion,
2013). The elimination of these federal funding sources
resulted in less grant or soft money being available for
schools to hire SROs. May and colleagues (2011) also indi-
cated that many schools and local police departments have
had to reassess their own funding priorities because of tight-
ening budgets related in part to the national recession of
2008 and 2009. Schools may have a difficult time justifying
the expansion or preservation of "nonacademic" programs,
such as an SRO program, when confronted with cost-saving
decisions (May et al., 2011, p. 130; Rosiak, 2011). Data from
the SCS to the NCVS offer some confirmation that the pres-
ence of SROs and other school security personnel has waned
in recent years. The percentage of students who reported a
police or security guard presence in the SCS has largely
remained unchanged--at roughly 70%--from 2003 to 2011
(Robers et al., 2013).
The school shooting incident at Sandy Hook Elementary
School in December 2012 placed a renewed focus on police
officers in schools. Soon after this incident President Obama
announced that federal money would be used to place police
officers in schools (Brenchley, 2013). The COPS Office
recently fulfilled this promise through its COPS Hiring
Program by awarding 141 agencies nearly 45 million dollars
to hire 356 SROs for the 2013 fiscal year (Community
Oriented Policing Services, n.d.). Evidence also suggests
that since Sandy Hook a number of states such as Indiana
(Elliott, 2013), North Carolina (Burns, 2013), Ohio
(Candisky, 2013), and Virginia (Meola, 2013) have appro-
priated or plan to appropriate funds for the hiring of addi-
tional SROs. This allocation of state and federal dollars
suggest that once again there is an upward trend in the use of
SROs, particularly in elementary schools where SROs were
rarely deployed prior to the shooting at Sandy Hook
Elementary School (e.g., Na & Gottfredson, 2013).
Views and Responsibilities of SROs
Few studies have systematically focused on SROs even
though police officers have played a role in schools for sev-
eral decades and are now deployed in many schools. The
existing research offers few answers to such basic questions
as how SROs are selected, the nature and extent of SRO
training, and the strategic uses of SROs. An exception is a
line of research that has addressed how SROs are generally
viewed by students, teachers, or school administrators.
Brown and Benedict (2005) found that the vast majority of
primarily Hispanic students surveyed in Brownville, TX,
were partial to having a police officer present at school.
Schuiteman, Aikens, and Thornton (2001) reported a similar
finding among a large sample of middle- and high-school
students in Virginia (see also Kupchik & Bracy, 2010a).
Other studies also indicate that teachers and school adminis-
trators generally favor a police presence in schools because
the officers can assume a number of important roles or
responsibilities including legal advisor, security coordinator
for school-related activities, and a first responder for serious
acts of school violence (e.g., Finn, Shively, McDevitt,
Lassiter, & Rich, 2005; Travis & Coon, 2005). Additional
evidence also suggests that the public generally supports the
placement of police officers in schools (Benigni, 2004). The
level of public support for SROs is not surprising given that
schools are often depicted as unsafe places in the media
(Kupchik & Bracy, 2009), and schools are often character-
ized as "soft" targets in need of additional security measures
(e.g., Hull, 2011; Trump, 2011). The visible presence of
SROs may symbolically signal to parents and community
members that student safety is an institutional priority
(Watkins & Maume, 2012).
Most school and community stakeholders are supportive
of a police presence in schools, yet concerns persist regard-
ing the general fit and uses of SROs. Cray and Weiler (2011)
broadlyspoketothispointwhentheystatedthatschool-police
partnerships are challenging because they bring "together
agencies with potentially competing orientations, practices,
and assumptions regarding the behavior of K-12 students"
(p. 168; see also Fowler et al., 2010; Portune, 1971). Much of
the delinquency committed by students in schools would not
be subject to police involvement if committed in the
Stinson and Watkins 3
community because school incidents are largely of a minor
nature (e.g., verbal threats; see Robers et al., 2013). Bittner
(1990) noted that it is precisely for this reason that police
officers have traditionally assigned little value to working
with juveniles. Police officers earn institutional recognition
by making the "big bust," not by resolving relatively trivial
incidents involving minors (Bittner, 1990). Although there is
strong reason to assume that events like Sandy Hook have
altered many police officers' views on the utility and merits
of working in schools with juveniles, there may be a prevail-
ing belief in law enforcement that the "serious" police work
occurs in the community with adults (e.g., Morimune, 2012;
Commons, 2005).
Police officers placed in schools often spend time on tasks
that are not traditional law enforcement functions such as
patrol and investigations. Trump (2002) analyzed the survey
responses of more than 600 SROs who attended the National
Association of School Resource Officers (NASRO) Annual
Conference in 2002 and found that roughly 60% of these
SROs reported that they spent "most" of their time serving as
an instructor/teacher or counselor/mentor. Only 41% of these
officers indicated that most of their time was spent as a "law
enforcement officer" (p. 45; see also Ruddell & May, 2011).
A 1996 survey of 217 SROs in North Carolina revealed that
on average these officers reported spending one half of their
time on law enforcement duties and the other half of their
time on counseling and teaching (Barnes, 2008). Some SROs
spend considerably more time on law enforcement functions
(e.g., May, Cordner, & Fessel, 2004), but the prior research
studies suggest that many SROs embrace the "triad" model
(counselor, educator, and police officer) promoted by
NASRO and the COPS Office (see Rosiak, 2011).
It is unclear though to what extent SROs are trained to be
effective mentors, counselors, educators, or intervention spe-
cialists in schools. The work of Thurau, Buckley, Gann, and
Wald (2013) indicates that entry-level police academy and
in-service training that police officers typically receive is not
sufficient for working with juveniles in the community and is
certainly not sufficient for working with juveniles in an edu-
cational environment. Research suggests that because of this
lack of training, many SROs are required or expected to
complete some form of specialized training that focuses on
the school setting (Clark, 2011; Cray & Weiler, 2011; Finn,
Shively, et al., 2005). Specialized training is not completed
by all SROs (e.g., Dycus, 2008, Fowler et al., 2010), and
training opportunities are limited for some SROs because of
logistical and/or budgetary reasons (e.g., Finn, Shively, et
al., 2005; May et al., 2011).
The Current Study
This exploratory study examines the nature of instances
where an SRO was arrested for one or more criminal offenses
and it was reported in the news media. There are at least three
reasons that justify such a focus on SROs. First, despite the
widespread use of SROs, there is little systematic research
that focuses on the behavior of school security personnel
(Brown, 2006; James & McCallion, 2013; Na & Gottfredson,
2013; Theriot, 2013). Second, Manning (1977) noted that
police officers are more likely to engage in prosocial behav-
ior when their role is well defined and they are sufficiently
trained to execute this role. In the case of SROs, questions
remain as to whether police officers are prepared to effec-
tively work in a school setting because of possible role ambi-
guity, insufficient training, and the differing institutional
norms and priorities of schools versus police agencies (e.g.,
Langberg, Fedders, & Kukorowski, 2011). Indeed, similar
arguments have been raised when considering the role of
SROs in supplying the "school-to-prison" pipeline (Fowler
et al., 2010; Hirschfield, 2008; Kupchik, 2009). Because of
such possible role, training, and institutional factors, SROs
represent an important, and growing, segment of law enforce-
ment to study officer misconduct. Third, research suggests
that school personnel generally hold favorable views of
SROs and consider them beneficial to the school environ-
ment (e.g., Travis & Coon, 2005). The general acceptance of
SROs has evolved to a point where "there is no critical dis-
cussion among the public or policy-makers, and extremely
little among academics, about whether police ought to be in
public schools" (Kupchik & Bracy, 2010a, p. 80).
Nonetheless, when officer misconduct occurs it places a
school's SRO program in a negative light and may force
some schools to reassess its investment in the program, par-
ticularly given that SRO funding--a nonacademic expense--
is a budgetary challenge for many schools (e.g., May et al.,
2011). In some schools, therefore, SRO retention may
depend on averting any officer misconduct that undermines
the typically favorable views of school-based police person-
nel. Systematic efforts to avert officer misconduct are aided
by research that provides a better understanding of the nature
of such incidents.
This research also examines the nature of crimes commit-
ted by police officers who are not deployed at schools. SROs
often take on counseling and teaching responsibilities that
require regular interaction with young persons in a non-
threatening environment. The adoption of such responsibili-
ties clearly suggests that the day-to-day demands and
challenges of SROs are disparate from those of community-
based police officers. Anecdotal evidence indicates that
schools and police agencies are sensitive to these divergent
responsibilities and try to hire a "teacher with a badge" or
officers who are not overly preoccupied with "chasing bad
guys" (e.g., Thurau & Wald, 2010). Given the unique dynam-
ics of the job at school and the presumably distinct career
orientation of SROs, there is reason to suspect the nature of
misconduct by school and nonschool police officers is
dissimilar.
The extent and nature of crime by police officers is still
largely unknown (Anechiarico & Jacobs, 1996; Kane, 2007;
Stinson, Liederbach, & Freiburger, 2010). Prior research has
4 SAGE Open
shown that police officers commit a variety of crimes on-
duty and off-duty. Crimes by police officers committed
while on-duty include acceptance of bribes, theft, and drug
shakedowns (Knapp Commission, 1972; Reiss, 1971;
Stinson, Liederbach, Brewer, Schmalzried, et al., 2013).
Some police officers commit crimes while off-duty and it is
often difficult to determine whether such crimes are related
to or stem from an officer's employment (Fyfe & Kane,
2006). All of this is complicated by the fact that police offi-
cers are generally exempt from law enforcement (Reiss,
1971). Police officers do not like to arrest other officers, and
often minor transgressions are ignored whereas similarly
situated nonpolice citizens would be arrested for their crimes
(Black, 1976). The off-duty crimes for which officers are
sometimes arrested include domestic violence and other
assaults, driving under the influence (DUI), and various sex
crimes (Stinson, Liederbach, Brewer, & Todak, 2013;
Stinson, Liederbach, & Freiburger, 2012; Stinson &
Liederbach, 2013).
Method
The current data were collected as part of an ongoing com-
prehensive study on police crime. The larger study was
designed to locate cases reported in the news media in which
sworn law enforcement officers had been arrested for one or
more criminal offenses. The primary information source was
the internet-based Google NewsTM search engine and its
Google AlertsTM email update service. Google News is a
computer-generated news site developed and operated by
Google that aggregates news articles from more than 50,000
news sources (Bharat & Beckmann, 2010). Automated daily
queries of the Google News search engine can be performed
by user-defined search terms previously entered into the
Google Alerts application.
Data Collection and Coding
Data were collected in real time on a daily basis from January
1, 2005, through December 31, 2011. Google Alerts searches
were conducted using the same 48 search terms developed
by Stinson (2009). The Google Alerts email update service
sent a message each time one of the automated daily searches
identified a news article in the Google News search engine
that matched any of the designated search terms. The auto-
mated alerts contained a link to the URL for the news arti-
cles. The articles were located, examined for relevancy,
printed, scanned, and indexed in a digital imaging database
for subsequent coding and content analyses.
After the universe of news reports were identified, the
case-related information was recorded using a multipage
coding instrument. Data were coded on such information as
arrested officer characteristics, the nature of criminal charges
filed against an officer, and victim characteristics. Criminal
offenses charged against officers were coded using a
two-step process. Each offense charged was initially coded
using the data collection guidelines of the National Incident-
Based Reporting System (NIBRS) as the protocol for each
criminal offense categories (U.S. Department of Justice,
2000, pp. 21-52). A total of 57 offenses are included in the
NIBRS, including 46 incident-based criminal offenses in 1
of 22 basic crime categories, as well as 11 additional arrest-
based minor crime categories (pp. 9-12). Additional non-
NIBRS offense categories were added to the coding
instrument following a pilot study because officers were
often arrested for criminal offenses not included in the
NIBRS. The non-NIBRS offense categories are as follows:
indecent exposure, online solicitation of a child, criminal
deprivation of civil rights, destroying or tampering with evi-
dence, false reports/statements and perjury, hit and run,
obstructing justice, official misconduct (including official
oppression and violation of oath), and restraining/protection
order violations.
The news articles were also coded using Stinson's (2009)
typology of police crime. This typology differentiates police
crime that is violence-related, sex-related, drug-related, alco-
hol-related, and/or profit-motivated. The use of this broad
typology overcame initial issues we encountered with the
data. For instance, the criminal charges filed against an offi-
cer in some cases failed to accurately reflect the nature of the
criminal acts described in the narratives of the news articles
analyzed, suggesting that preferential initial charging deci-
sions were made as a professional courtesy to some of the
officers who were arrested. On other occasions, officers were
charged with generic "official misconduct" crimes in lieu of
specific crimes that would prove an embarrassment for the
employing law enforcement agency if the true nature of the
offense were an element of the offense charged. This
occurred in some cases involving SROs, where the news
source disclosed that an SRO was arrested for initiating an
inappropriate relationship with a student but more detailed
information was unknown or not published. It is common for
news media to withhold victim names and other personally
identifiable information when reporting on sex crimes, espe-
cially when the victim is a child (Putnam & Finkelhor, 2006).
These dynamics generated a need for a broad coding strategy
that captured the nature of crimes committed by offenses.
Use of the 65 specific arrest categories was also not possible
due to the size of the current SRO sample (n = 52). The use
of the specific offense categories resulted in many cells hav-
ing few or no cases when frequency tables were generated.
Efforts were made to triangulate data sources in that mul-
tiple news articles and sources were available for many of
the cases reported and, as available, copies of official court
records were obtained specifically to determine eventual
case outcomes. Coding of the offenses was completed by one
of the authors. Procedures were undertaken to ensure the
reliability of the data. One of the most widely accepted tests
of reliability for content analyses is the percentage of agree-
ment test, where the percentage of agreement among two or
Stinson and Watkins 5
more coders is calculated (Riffe, Lacy, & Fico, 2005). A sec-
ond coder was used to independently code a random sample
of 5% of the total number of cases in our database (n = 106).
The overall level of simple agreement (96.85%) between the
two coders across the variables established a degree of reli-
ability well above what is generally considered "acceptable"
(Riffe et al., 2005, p. 147).
Results
All of the SROs in the current sample were male, and most
had worked in law enforcement for more than 5 years prior
to their arrest. The average length of service was slightly
more than 10 years at the time of arrest and their average age
was 39. Table 1 displays the distribution of offenses for
which SROs were arrested. The second column in Table 1
indicates the number (n) of SROs who were arrested for any
one of the broad category of offenses listed. The five offense
categories listed in Table 1 are therefore not mutually exclu-
sive. Two SROs in the sample, for instance, supplied female
adolescents with alcohol and then had sexual contact with
the girls. These two officers are found in the alcohol- and
sex-related categories in Table 1. We found, however, that in
most cases SROs were arrested for either a single offense or
for multiple offenses that were similar in nature. One SRO in
the sample, for example, was arrested for possession of child
pornography and sexual abuse of middle-school students,
both sexually related offenses.
It is also worth noting that all of the violence-related
offenses in Table 1 were nonsexual in nature. Most SROs
who committed sex-related crimes chose a teenage victim. A
majority of these crimes were described in news sources as
consensual even in instances where direct physical contact
occurred. The only exceptions involved cases where it was
not known or made clear by news sources whether an officer
used physical force, perhaps as a courtesy to the young vic-
tim and her family. In these instances, it was impossible to
determine whether a sex-related offense involved the use of
physical force and thus violence-related.
The data presented in Table 1 show that by a considerable
margin, SROs in the sample were most often arrested for
sex-related offenses--nearly 62% of all offenses. When
SROs did commit a sex crime, students were often the
victim. Of the SROs who were arrested for sex-related
crimes, 56% (n = 18) chose a victim(s) enrolled at the school
at which they were employed. Six additional SROs commit-
ted sex crimes against a nonfamily member who was of
school age, but it was unclear whether the victim was a stu-
dent at the school where the SRO worked. We find that 75%
(n = 24) of SROs arrested for sex-related crimes targeted
nonfamily youths almost entirely of middle and high school
age.
Many of the school-age victims were teenage girls.
Specifically, 62% (n = 20) of the SROs arrested for sex-
related crimes were charged with offenses against teenage
girls who were not their family member. One incident
involved an SRO who kissed a student enrolled in a junior
cadet program he supervised and then days later sent sexu-
ally explicit text messages to the girl's cell phone. Another
SRO was charged with having sex with a female student.
Prior to his arrest, school officials had expressed concerns
about how this SRO was interacting with the female student.
When direct physical contact occurred in the sex-related
offenses, news sources often did not report on the precise
time and location of the incident. The limited information we
do have suggests that these incidents occurred mostly during
nonschool hours and/or off school grounds.
Unlike the sex-related offenses, other offenses for which
SROs were arrested typically did not involve students or
minors. The alcohol-related offenses largely involved arrests
for DUI, whereas the violence-related offenses were domi-
nated by domestic violence incidents. Profit-motivated inci-
dents dealt with crimes such as SROs stealing police- or
school-issued equipment or falsifying the amount of over-
time worked. These nonsexual crimes once again were gen-
erally not committed in the company of students or minors.
Table 2 displays the general types of offenses for which
police officers, excluding SROs, were arrested over the same
time period. In all, 95% (n = 1,674) of these police officers
were male, with an average age of 37 years, and had nearly
10 years of sworn law enforcement experience at the time of
their arrest. The current results indicate that in terms of gen-
der, age, and experience, arrested SROs were demographi-
callysimilartoarrestednonschoolpoliceofficers.Differences
between the two groups of officers become apparent when
the types of offenses for which they were arrested are

examined. Table 2 displays results from bivariate chi-square
tests that assess whether significant arrest differences exist
between SROs and other officers. These tests reveal that
nonschool police officers were significantly more likely to
be arrested for violence-related offenses, whereas SROs
were significantly more likely to be arrested for sex-related
offenses. The measure of association, Cramer's V, between
officer type and arrest type indicates that distributional dif-
ferences are most distinct for sex-related offenses. Among
the nonschool officers in Table 2 who were arrested for a
sex-related offense (n = 399), 45% targeted unrelated minors
(compared with 75% in the case of SROs). Table 2 also
reveals there are no significant differences between SROs
and nonschool officers for alcohol-related, drug-related, and
profit-motivated offenses. These bivariate statistical tests
should be interpreted with caution, however, given the low
expected contingency table cell counts for certain incidents
including drug-related offenses involving SROs.
Discussion
Our methodology produced data on police crime that would
be difficult, if not impossible, to obtain using other methods.
There are no official data or comprehensive statistics avail-
able on the phenomenon of police crime (Kane, 2007;
Stinson et al., 2010). This research compliments existing
studies in the "newsmaking criminology" tradition whereby
criminologists interpret news reports about crime (Barak,
1988, 2007). Studies in newsmaking criminology most com-
monly involve the analysis of news content to gain knowl-
edge about the nature of crime-related media coverage, but
news content can also provide valuable information on the
nature of the criminal behavior that underlies the media cov-
erage (see, for example, Morris, 2010). The news reports we
analyzed provide an unparalleled amount of information on a
large number of crimes committed by police officers, includ-
ing those by SROs.
There are four primary limitations with the current data.
First, the research is constrained by the content and quality of
information provided on each case in the news articles ana-
lyzed. The amount of information on each case varied, and
data for some of the variables of interest were missing in
some cases. Second, the data are limited to cases involving
an official arrest. Data on cases of police crime that failed to
come to the attention of law enforcement or prosecutors, or
failed to result in arrest were unavailable. Third, these data
are the result of a filtering process that includes the exercise
of discretion by media sources. Media sources exercise dis-
cretion in terms of the types of news stories covered and the
nature of the content devoted to particular news stories
(Carlson, 2007). This discretion raises concerns that media
accounts of police crime may not be representative of actual
officer misconduct. Some research suggests, however, that
news coverage of certain types of officer misconduct is con-
sistent with official police records of these events (e.g.,
Ready, White, & Fisher, 2008). Research also suggests that
police agencies are not especially effective at controlling
media accounts of officer misconduct (Chermak, McGarrell,
& Gruenewald, 2006). Fourth, there are a relatively small
number of arrest cases involving SROs (n = 52) in our unique
sample. Among the limited number of studies that have
focused on SROs, most were undertaken with small or non-
probability samples (e.g., Kupchik & Bracy, 2010b). Despite
this weakness, these exploratory studies have been instru-
mental in advancing research on SROs. This descriptive
study aims to do the same by focusing on the implications of
the findings for SRO programs.
It is estimated that as many as one half of public schools
in the United States have at minimum a part-time police
presence (Raymond, 2010), and the number of police offi-
cers deployed in schools will certainly increase in coming
years given that state and federal governments have made
SROs a budgetary priority after the 2012 shooting at Sandy
Hook Elementary School (Brenchley, 2013). The placement
of SROs in many schools has not been accompanied by a
corresponding investment in research that systematically
focuses on school police officers. We contribute to this sparse
line of research by examining news articles to identify the
general types of offenses for which SROs are arrested. SROs
are an important segment of law enforcement to study officer
misconduct because of some level of role ambiguity, limited
training, and the differing institutional norms and priorities
of schools versus local law enforcement agencies.
Our results are encouraging insofar as they indicate that
very few SROs are arrested for a criminal offense. More spe-
cifically, recent estimates suggest that there are more than
15,000 SROs nationwide (James & McCallion, 2013), yet
we identified only 52 school police officers who were
arrested for a criminal offense over a 7-year period. The trou-
bling aspect of our findings is that when these few SROs
were arrested, they were most often arrested for sex-related
offenses that typically involved female students enrolled at
the schools they patrolled or frequented. All of the student-
involved cases in our study represent instances where an
SRO engaged in inappropriate behavior by making sexually
explicit remarks or initiating sexual contact with a student.
As mentioned, SROs are often encouraged to assume
responsibilities not directly related to law enforcement
including counseling and mentoring students (e.g., Finn,
McDevitt, Lassiter, Shively, & Rich, 2005). The activities
provide students with nonadversarial opportunities to inter-
act with police officers (Jackson, 2002). Many of these
encounters occur outside the classroom in small group or
one-on-one situations where informal conversations about
matters unrelated to school regularly occur. Indeed, SROs
are often deployed in large urban public schools attended by
students with unstable home lives (Lawrence, 2006). SROs
in such schools likely encounter emotionally charged stu-
dents whose words and actions are attributable to circum-
stances away from school. These encounters often result in
Stinson and Watkins 7
the SRO taking on a nonpolice role comparable to that of a
social worker or family member. As one SRO in a large
urban school put it, his job "goes beyond policing" because
he is often a "father figure," "uncle," or "everything" to some
students (Snyder, 2011, p. 5).
Teachers are also often much more than educators. They
often self-assess their own interactions with students to make
sure they do not become too invested or friendly with some
students (Aultman, Williams-Johnson, & Schutz, 2009).
These questions can be difficult to answer when research
consistently finds that students who express a stronger con-
nection to their teachers perform better academically
(Andrzejewksi & Davis, 2008). When SROs take on duties
unrelated to law enforcement such as counseling students
and teaching classes, they too are likely confronted by the
same relational questions. It is perhaps not surprising then
that we found that the types of crimes for which SROs are
arrested are more consistent with the types of offenses com-
mitted by teachers (e.g., American Association of University
Women [AAUW], 2001; Shakeshaft, 2004) rather than
police officers (e.g., Stinson et al., 2012). The current find-
ings generally revealed that the circumstances surrounding
offenses for which nonschool police officers were arrested
were often much different than the crimes committed by
SROs. The community-based police officers were in particu-
lar less likely than SROs to be arrested for sex-related
offenses, but they were more likely to be arrested for vio-
lence-related incidents such as a domestic dispute.
Our findings, along with research on teacher misconduct
(e.g., Shakeshaft, 2004), highlight the importance of having
school personnel establish and maintain relational boundaries
with students. Indeed, education experts have strongly
encouraged school administrators for decades to formally
address student relational boundaries when training teachers
in part because self-report research indicates that students are
regular victims of teacher-perpetrated sexual misconduct
(AAUW, 2001; Hutchings, 2009). The problem, however, is
that such relational training is sparingly administered to
teachers (Shakeshaft, 2004). The same likely holds true for
SROs. Although most states do not require that SROs "receive
any specialized training before becoming an SRO or working
with youth" (Thurau & Wald, 2010; p. 998), research indi-
cates that most SROs do eventually complete some special-
ized training--usually no more than 40 hr--such as
participating in courses offered by NASRO and/or becoming
certified to teach Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE)
or other prevention-related curriculums (see, for example,
Finn, Shively, et al., 2005; Finn, Townsend, Shively, & Rich,
2005). A tertiary examination of the content of such special-
ized training opportunities suggests that relational boundaries
with students are sparsely addressed if at all.
Our findings also suggest that such training should serve
experienced police officers in addition to officers who are
new to the job. Most of the SROs arrested for sexual inci-
dents involving students had worked in schools for more
than 2 years. Perhaps issues with student relational boundar-
ies become more salient as officers spend more time in
schools and have greater opportunities to informally interact
with students. Prior research indicates that SROs assume
more non-law-enforcement responsibilities the longer they
remain at a school (e.g., Finn, Shively, et al., 2005).
The news articles that covered the arrests of SROs for
sexual misconduct often raised pointed questions about the
supervision of these officers. Although many of these sex-
ual incidents took place away from school, research with
educators has shown that when sexual encounters occur
between teachers and students, there is often an escalation
of events where an emotional attachment becomes a physi-
cal one (Johnson, 2010). As that happens, there may be
opportunities to identify questionable behaviors that occur
at school--such as repeated closed-door or after-school
meetings--and intervene (Shakeshaft, 2004). Although all
school personnel should be cognizant of potential misbe-
havior and related warning signs, immediate supervisors
bear a particular responsibility. In the case of SROs, their
immediate supervisor is often located off-site at a local
police department or tends to balance multiple responsibili-
ties that severely limit the amount of time they spend at any
one school. In fact, of the 19 SRO programs that Finn,
Shively, and colleagues (2005) evaluated, they noted that
most police supervisors "do not conscientiously supervise
their SROs" (p. 47). In instances where an SRO's supervi-
sor is located off-site or supervising multiple SROs
deployed across different schools, it is all the more "essen-
tial that the SRO's police supervisor maintain regular con-
tact with school administrators to assess the officer's
progress throughout the school year accurately" (Clark,
2011, p. 98).
Many police departments have implemented comprehen-
sive personnel assessment systems to collect data on all
sworn officers within their agency (Walker, Alpert, &
Kenney, 2000). These early intervention systems could be
used to identify officers at risk of engaging in criminal
behaviors and sexual misconduct (International Association
of Chiefs of Police, 2011). Police and school administrators
are in a position to adopt such promising personnel systems
for SROs, but the effectiveness of these systems is certainly
reliant on the consistent oversight and supervision of SROs.
The current findings indicate that SROs are rarely arrested
for criminal misconduct. These infrequent incidents typi-
cally involved sexual misconduct directed at a student. The
nature of these incidents suggests there may be benefit to
having SROs receive some basic training on relational
boundaries in the school environment, something that has
been strongly advocated for teachers given the sexual nature
of offenses they commit (Shakeshaft, 2004). In addition, pre-
venting infrequent acts of misconduct by SROs is likely dif-
ficult given that most police officers presumably have
substantial autonomy in schools, but the use of early inter-
vention systems that ensure active and consistent supervision
8 SAGE Open
of SROs may facilitate the identification of problematic
behavior before it escalates to a serious nature. The effective
training and monitoring of SROs will be a source of contin-
ued discussion and debate as state and federal governments
make greater investments in the placement of police officers
in schools.
