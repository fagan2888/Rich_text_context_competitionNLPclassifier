Introduction
In 2015, the mortality associated with coronary artery dis-
ease (CAD) was 2.6% higher than in 2013, and with an
ageing population in China, the number of deaths from
cardiovascular disease (CVD) is still increasing rapidly.1
According to the 7th edition of the Diabetes Atlas by the
International Diabetes Federation (IDF), there were nearly
410 million diabetes mellitus (DM) patients around the
world in 2015, of which approximately 46.5% have not yet
been diagnosed. The China Cardiac Survey collected clini-
cal data from 3513 patients in seven cities across the coun-
try, which revealed a high percentage (up to 77%) of
hyperglycaemia in patients with CAD.2
Over the past few years, non-coding RNAs have been
considered the `dark matter' of the genome because of
their indefinite types and functions. However, studies
have shown that non-coding RNAs are able to regulate
gene expression even though they cannot code for pro-
teins directly.3 Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of
closed circular non-coding RNAs derived from reverse
splicing of exons, introns or both.4,5 With a ring structure
lacking the 5-end cap and the 3-end poly(A) tail, circR-
NAs cannot be recognized or hydrolysed by RNA exonu-
clease, and therefore, circRNAs possess relatively higher
biological stability than linear RNA.6 The regulatory gene
expression mechanisms of circRNAs vary. As an `miRNA
sponge', circRNAs play an important regulatory role at
the post-transcriptional level via competitive binding to
miRNAs.7 The circRNAs can also regulate transcription
by interacting with small nuclear RNA (snRNA) or RNA

Abstract
Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify the expression characteristics of circular RNAs in the peripheral
blood of coronary artery disease patients and type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.
Methods: Circular RNA in the peripheral blood from 6 control individuals, 6 coronary artery disease patients, 6 type 2
diabetes mellitus patients and 6 coronary artery disease combined with type 2 diabetes mellitus patients was collected
for microarray analysis, and a further independent cohort consisting of 20 normal individuals, 20 type 2 diabetes mellitus
subjects and 20 coronary artery disease subjects was used to verify the expression of five circular RNAs chosen for
further analysis. The findings were then tested in a third cohort using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
Results: In total, 40 circular RNAs differentially expressed between the three experimental groups and the control group
were identified by microarray analysis: 13 were upregulated in the experimental groups, while 27 were downregulated.
Of the five circular RNAs chosen for further analysis, three were significantly downregulated in the experimental groups.
The crude odds ratios and adjusted odds ratios of hsa-circRNA11783-2 showed significant differences in both the
coronary artery disease group and type 2 diabetes mellitus group. We then verified hsa-circRNA11783-2 in the third
cohort, and it remained closely related to both coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Conclusion: Hsa-circRNA11783-2 is closely related to both coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

polymerase II in the nucleus8 and competitively regulate
RNA splicing by binding to transcription factors.9 In addi-
tion, the expression of circRNAs is tissue specific and
time specific; for example, ciRS-7 is highly expressed in
brain tissue.10 Moreover, there are significant differences
in the type and expression of circRNAs at different stages
of biological development.11,12
Previous research has shown that circRNAs are closely
related to certain human diseases. Burd et al.13 found that
cANRIL, the circular isoform of long non-coding RNA
(lncRNA)-ANRIL, may influence the development of
CAD by affecting the expression of the INK4/ARF gene.
Wang et al.14 discovered that miR-7 might be involved in
the occurrence of DM by reducing regeneration of pancre-
atic  cells. Qin et al.15 demonstrated that hsa_circ_0005075
is a potential biomarker for liver cancer. In this study, we
investigated the relationship between circRNAs with CAD
and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Microarray analysis
was conducted to compare the expression profiles of circR-
NAs in the peripheral blood of normal individuals, CAD
patients, T2DM patients and CAD combined with T2DM
patients, and the results were verified in larger cohorts.
Materials and methods
Patient population
The 289 participants in the study were divided into three
cohorts (the clinical and demographic features of each
cohort are shown in Supplementary Tables 1 to 3).
Participants were enrolled from the Departments of
Cardiology and Endocrinology of the People's Hospital of
Zhengzhou University from July 2015 to June 2016. All
participants received coronary angiography (CAG) and an
oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to identify the presence
of CAD and/or T2DM. Clinically matched participants (24
in total; control group, n=6; T2DM group, n=6; CAD
group, n
=
6; CAD combined with T2DM group, n=6)
were enrolled for microarray analysis. CircRNA expres-
sion was verified in the second cohort (control group,
n=20; T2DM group, n=20; CAD group, n=20), and the
circRNA with the best performance was selected and
tested in the third cohort (control group, n=60; T2DM
group, n=64; CAD group, n=81). The exclusion criteria
were as follows: (1) liver or kidney dysfunction, (2) auto-
immune disease, (3) malignancy, (4) any other clinically
acute or chronic inflammatory systemic disease, (5)
uncontrolled hypertension, (6) endocrine disease aside
from T2DM or (7) previous history of acute myocardial
infarction (AMI), percutaneous coronary intervention
(PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
Definition of CAD and T2DM
In this study, CAD was diagnosed according to theAmerican
College of Cardiology/American Heart Association
guidelines (at least one coronary artery stenosis: 50%).16
The extent of coronary artery stenosis was measured by two
independent cardiologists by visual observation.
T2DM was diagnosed according to the 1998 Standards
of the World Health Organization (WHO);17 T2DM was
diagnosed when one of the following criteria were met: (1)
fasting blood glucose (FPG)
126mg/dL (7.0mmol/L),
where fasting was defined in the study as abstinence from
any calories for at least 8
h or (2) 2-h post-load plasma
glucose200mg/dL (11.1mmol/L) during the OGTT.
In this study, control individuals showed no sign of
coronary atherosclerosis or microvascular disease investi-
gated by negative treadmill exercise testing (TET) and
emission computed tomography (ECT), and their 2h post-
load plasma glucose levels in the OGTT and FPG test
were less than 140
mg/dL (7.8
mmol/L) and 110
mg/dL
(6.1mmol/L), respectively.
Collection of blood samples, RNA extraction
and quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction
After an overnight fast, 2mL of blood was collected from
the median cubital vein in the early morning before break-
fast and stored in a vacuum blood collection tube contain-
ing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) anticoagulant.
Within 20min (during which time the blood samples were
stored in an ice box at 4°C), total RNA was extracted from
the whole blood (1mL) with a total RNA rapid extraction
kit (CapitalBio Corp., Beijing, China) following the manu-
facturer's instructions. RNA was dissolved in ribonuclease
(RNase)-free water, and the concentration and purity of
total RNA were determined using a NanoDrop 2000 spec-
trophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
The integrity of RNA was assessed with 1% formaldehyde
denaturing gel electrophoresis. Subsequently, reverse tran-
scription was performed by applying a PrimeScript RT
reagent kit (Takara Bio, Inc., Shiga, Japan) to obtain the
complementary DNA (cDNA). Quantitative Real-Time
Polymerase Chain Reaction (Q-PCR) was performed using
SYBR-Green Premix Ex Taq (Takara Bio, Inc.) and moni-
tored with an ABI PRISM 7500 Sequence Detection
System (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Foster
City, CA, USA). The relative expression levels of circR-
NAs were determined by Q-PCR. Primers used for Q-PCR
are listed in Supplementary Table 4.
Microarray analysis of circRNA
Participants (normal individuals, CAD subjects, T2DM
subjects and subjects with both CAD and T2DM; six cases
in each group) were enrolled to conduct the microarray
analysis. Digestion, dephosphorylation, degeneration and
amplification of RNA were performed in accordance with
the instructions of the manufacturer. RNA was labelled
512 Diabetes & Vascular Disease Research 14(6)
with Cy3-dCTP, and purified RNA was hybridized to a
microarray (human circRNA Array V2.0, CapitalBio.,
Beijing, China) containing 170,340 human circRNA
probes.GeneSpringSoftwareV13.0(AgilentTechnologies,
Santa Clara, CA, USA) was employed to analyse microar-
ray data. To select the differentially expressed circRNAs, a
threshold value of fold change 2 or -2 with a p<0.05
determined by a t test was used.
Statistical analysis
Variables of different distributions are expressed as the
mean±
standard deviation or percentages. In the scatter-
plot showing circRNA expression, the horizontal lines rep-
resent the median values. A chi-square test was conducted
for categorical variables; Kolmogorov­Smirnov and
Shapiro­Wilk tests were performed to check data normal-
ity for continuous variables, followed by testing for homo-
geneity of variance. Significant differences in clinical and
demographic indicators were tested using one-way analy-
sis of variance (ANOVA) or a Kruskal­Wallis H test.
Logistic regression analysis was applied to obtain odds
ratios (ORs) after the relative expression of circRNAs
expanded to 10 times, and adjusted ORs were also esti-
mated after shared risk factors for CAD and T2DM were
introduced: smoking, hypertension, total cholesterol (TC),
triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and
low-density lipoprotein (LDL). For all tests, a p value
under 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All
analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics 22.0 soft-
ware (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results and discussion
Characteristics of circRNA expression profiles
The results showed significant differences in circRNA
expression between the control group and the three experi-
mental groups. Microarray analysis identified 2036 circR-
NAs differentially expressed between the control group
and the CAD group; 376 were upregulated and 1660 were
downregulated in the CAD group (Supplementary Table 5),
while 489 were differentially expressed between the con-
trol group and the T2DM group. In addition, 78 were
upregulated in the T2DM group, whereas 411 were down-
regulated (Supplementary Table 6). Similarly, 220 circR-
NAs were also differentially expressed in the control
group and the CAD and T2DM group, of which 147 were
upregulated, and the other 73 were downregulated
(Supplementary Table 7). Further analysis indicated that
40 circRNAs were differentially expressed in all three
experimental groups, of which 13 circRNAs were upregu-
lated and 27 were downregulated in the experimental
groups (Supplementary Table 8). Then, seven circRNAs
were screened under improved screening criteria, with a p
value less than 0.005 and fold change >2.1; five circRNAs
showing relatively larger fold changes were then selected
for the following validation, namely, hsa_circ_0009036,
hsa_circ_0054129, hsa-circRNA11806-28, hsa-cir-
cRNA6510-1 and hsa-circRNA11783-2 (highlighted in
Supplementary Table 8).
The circRNA expression profile verified by
Q-PCR
We used the second cohort (control group, n=20; T2DM
group, n=20; and CAD group, n=20) to validate the five
circRNAs selected in the previous step and the results are
shown in Figure 1. The expression levels of hsa_
circ_0009036 and hsa_circ_0054129 were not signifi-
cantly different between groups, while the levels of

individuals, 20 CAD patients and 20 T2DM patients. The
relative circRNA levels were normalized to the level
of the control (-actin): expression levels of (a) hsa-
circRNA11806-28, (b) hsa-circRNA6510-1 and (c) hsa-
circRNA11783-2.
Li et al. 513
hsa-circRNA11806-28, hsa-circRNA6510-1 and hsa-cir-
cRNA11783-2 were significantly lower in both the T2DM
group and CAD group compared with the control group
(Table 1).
Logistic regression analysis of the differentially
expressed circRNAs
Logistic regression analysis was further performed to
compare correlations between the three circRNAs and
CAD and T2DM, and the analysis was adjusted by intro-
ducing risk factors: smoking, hypertension, TC, TG, HDL
and LDL (Table 2). The results indicated that hsa-cir-
cRNA11783-2 had a stronger correlation with CAD and
T2DM than hsa-circRNA11806-28 and hsa-cir-
cRNA6510-1. We then verified hsa-circRNA11783-2 in
the third cohort.
Independent cohort validation with larger
sample size
The significance of differential hsa-circRNA11783-2
expression was validated in the third cohort (control
group, n=60; T2DM group, n
=
64; and CAD group,
n
=
81) (Figure 2). Hsa-circRNA11783-2 was downregu-
lated in both the CAD and T2DM groups compared with
the control group, and the corresponding fold changes
were 0.4 (p=0.014) and 0.5 (p<0.001) in the CAD and
T2DM groups, respectively. Logistic regression analysis
indicated that the crude OR of hsa-circRNA11783-2 was
0.740 [95% confidence interval (CI)
=
(0.630­0.869),
p<
0.001] in the CAD group and 0.778 [(0.659­0.919),
p
=
0.003] in the T2DM group. After introducing the
shared risk factors of CAD and T2DM (TC, TG, HDL,
LDL, smoking and hypertension), the adjusted OR was
0.688 [(0.571­0.829), p<
0.001] in the CAD group and
0.723 [(0.591­0.883), p=0.002] in the T2DM group. The
results suggested that hsa-circRNA11783-2 is closely
related to both CAD and T2DM.
Discussion
The high morbidity and mortality of CAD and T2DM
impose a huge social and economic burden worldwide,

which severely reduces quality of life. The mortality of
patients with CAD complicated by T2DM is signifi-
cantly higher than that of patients with normal glucose
metabolism.18,19 The single-nucleotide polymorphism
rs10911021 is closely related to the morbidity and mortality
of CAD patients in the setting of T2DM.20 Thus, it is impor-
tant to find targeted circRNAs associated with both CAD
and T2DM that could further our understanding of the
associations between CAD and T2DM at the genetic level.
In this study, we first explored differentially expressed
circRNAs in control individuals and patients with CAD or
T2DM and in patients with both CAD and T2DM. A total
of 40 circRNAs were differentially expressed between the
control group and the three experimental groups. The gene
ontology and pathway enrichment analysis results sug-
gested that these circRNAs are correlated with biological
adhesion, cell adhesion and mitotic cell cycle. Then, five
selected circRNAs were verified in a second cohort with a
larger sample size. The results suggested that hsa-cir-
cRNA11783-2 is more closely related to CAD and T2DM
than the other selected circRNAs. Subsequently, the above
results were verified in a third cohort, and the significant
role of hsa-circRNA11783-2 in CAD and T2DM was con-
firmed by the corresponding results.
There is currently no definitive evidence demonstrating
the biological function of hsa-circRNA11783-2. Hsa-
circRNA11783-2 is located at chr18:28650691­28672263,
and its source gene name is ENST00000251081. This gene
encodes a member of the desmocollin protein subfamily.
Mutations in this gene are associated with CVDs,21 but
there is no evidence showing that this gene is related to
diabetes. CircRNAs can regulate gene expression by act-
ing as `miRNA sponges'. There are some binding sites for
miR-608 and miR-3907 in hsa-circRNA11783-2, and
these miRNAs are associated with tumours and the female
reproductive tract.22,23
This study is the first to explore the expression of circR-
NAs in subjects with CAD and T2DM. Our results indi-
cated that hsa-circRNA11783-2 is closely related to both
conditions. However, this study is single centred, and the
geographical distribution of participants was relatively
concentrated. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether
these results are relevant to subjects from other regions
and countries. To study a homogeneous population, we
excluded patients with kidney disease and prior CVD, and
our conclusions need to be validated in cohorts with a
larger sample size and in patients with these conditions.
Finally, the specific roles of hsa-circRNA11783-2 in CAD
and T2DM require more attention and further exploration
in future studies.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this study is the first to verify that certain
circRNAs are correlated with CAD and T2DM.
Hsa-circRNA11783-2 exhibited the strongest correlation
with both CAD and T2DM.
