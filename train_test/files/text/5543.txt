Introduction
In Azanism: A Critical Analysis of the Mytho-Reality
Complexity of the Azanian Nation (Guevara, 2009/2011), I
took considerable pains to reintegrate the subcultures of the
indigenous population of colonialAfrica into the main culture
school of the Bantu/Cushitic-Ethiopians kingdom (hence-
forth Azania) situated then in Karnak/Thebes. Hence, ethno-
culturally, I discussed the concept of "Pan-ism" in relation to
precolonial/prepoliticalAfrican--that is, theAzanian (or later
ancient Egyptian) pan-deity Min.1 Moreover, although I dis-
cussed the importance of the "Ritual of Resurrection" (see
Guevara, 2009/2011, pp. 183-200, esp. pp.189-192) and its
twin culture process of the "mummification of the indigenous
Pharaohs" to the objective of the Azanian national culture, I
stressed that such symbolic culture practices are supplemen-
tary to that nation's culture commitment to the eternal essence
of life, Manfou[i]r/Menefre (the Greco-European Memphis).2
It is in light of such culture commitment and the fact that the
whole Nile Valley region was an inextricable part of these
culture processes that I questioned the national essence of the
pan-African Movement(s)/PAMs and/or the numerous irre-
dentist movements on Africa's political plain, especially
given most African leaders subscription to the colonial ideal
(theAfrican states) through which a United States ofAfrica or
Africa's newly emerging tribal entities (e.g., the Biafras,
Hutustan, Eritrea, Somali-land, etc.) could be forged.
Put simply, ethnic and culture reasons prompted my cri-
tique of both Pan-Africanism and Africa's tribal (pseudoeth-
nic) irredentism. For instance, after meticulously scrutinizing
the process by which Eritrea forged its national identity, and
on the basis of which it eventually achieved statehood, and
Somaliland's apparent route to secession, the scholar
Dominique Jacquin-Berdal (2002) came to the conclusion
that in both cases it was the "colonial self" rather than ethnic-
ity that provided the basis for secession, while it was "war"
that proved to be the catalyst of nation formation. Three key
events are important in her analysis of the formation of
Eritrea in particular: The first was the creation of Eritrea as a
colonial state, an event which not only provided Eritrea with

Pan-Africanism: A Contorted Delirium or
a Pseudonationalist Paradigm? Revivalist
Critique
Raul Diaz Guevara1
Abstract
This essaic-article goes against established conventions that there is anything ethno-cultural (and hence national) about the
so-called African tribes. Drawing largely from the culture history of precolonial/prepolitical Africans--that is, the Bantu/
Cushitic-Ethiopians (Azanians)--the author has demonstrated vividly that far from being distinct ethno-culture national
communities, the so-called tribes of African states are better considered subculture groups, whose regional culture practices
erstwhile paid tribute to their nation's main culture center in Karnak. For example, using the culture symbols and practices
of some local groups and linking them to the predynastic and dynastic Pharaonic periods, I argued that there is compelling
evidence against qualifying Africa's tribes as distinct ethno-culture national entities. In genuine culture context, I stressed that
the Ritual of Resurrection and its twin culture process of the mummification of deceased indigenous Pharaohs tend to suggest
that the object of the Bantu/Cushitic-Ethiopians national culture was life (in its eternal manifestation) and then resurrection
later, and that there are recurring (culturally sanctioned) ethical examples among the culture custodians of these subculture
groups that generally pay tribute to the overarching culture norm. Furthermore, the fact that the Ritual of Resurrection
began in the Delta region and ended at the Sources of the Nile, where the spirit of the deceased indigenous Pharaohs was
introduced into the spiritual world of their ancestors, contradicts conventional perceptions that ancient Egypt was a distinct
national community isolated from precolonial/prepolitical Africa/Azania.

its name and geographical identity, but with a history distinct
from that of Ethiopia. The second was the period of
Federation (1952-1962) during which Eritrea acquired the
institutions and symbols of autonomy, and finally the libera-
tion war itself, during which the nationalist struggle gradu-
ally spread from a small elite to encompass the Eritrean
masses. It was also during this period that Eritrea's identity
was cemented and given its present characteristic by the
"dominant Movement," the Eritrean People's Liberation
Front (EPLF). In other words, while Dominique's position
seems close to sharing the ethno-symbolist perception that
one cannot make bricks without straw (Anthony, 1991/1986),
however, in her analysis of Africa's state-nations that straw
was not ethnic. Thus, in her critique of the ethnic interpreta-
tion of the origins and spread of nationalism, her argument is
simply that in much of Africa, ethnicity as much as national-
ism is a modern creation. She maintains accurately that, the
colonial administration's need to "map" the population under
its control led to the establishment of categories whose con-
tours were in many cases substantially different from those
that had previously prevailed (Jacquin-Berdal, 2002).
Dominique's lucid analysis, among others, has proven
critical to the novel concept of pseudoethnicity and pseudona-
tionalism developed in Azanism with specific reference to
contemporary African politics. This is particularly true of
Muamar Gaddafi's recent (preassassination) approval of the
partitioning of Nigeria into Christians and Islamist dominated
states. Subsequently, this essaic-article which is meant to
strengthen the ethno-culture paradigm of real nations shall
thus expand on the concept of genuine-/pseudonationalism so
as to elaborate on that position. Because this article is gener-
ally meant to expose the culture deficit of postcolonialAfrican
politics, it will thus be reasonable to critically review the
major inconsistencies characterizing the political mandate of
some key PAM(s) figures (e.g., the late Kwame Nkrumah,
Julius Nyerere, and Muammar Gaddafi). This should demon-
strate how PAMs' political mandate continues to adversely
affect the indigenous people's culture quest for genuine free-
dom(see"QuestioningthePan-AfricanistUnionistParadigm"
section).
Indeed Gaddafi's approval of pseudoethnic entities/iden-
tities on Africa's political plain accords with early colonial-
ist attempts to create tribal states in colonial Africa. Such a
divisive heritage, which doubtlessly has become synony-
mous with contemporary African politics, can rightly be
contrasted with the urge in Azanism to rediscover the ethno-
culture origin of the Azanian nation. Following this ethno-
culture emphasis in Azanism, I will thus seek to explore the
ethnic affinities spanning across the subculture groups of
Nhana (ancient Ghana) with the view to reintegrating them
in the culture fold/school of the Azanian nation (see "Are
We at the Verge of a Genuine Ethno-Cultural National
Reawakening?" section).
Questioning the Pan-Africanist Unionist
Paradigm
A Review of Muammar Gaddafi's Approval of
Pseudoethnic Identities in Colonial Africa
Prior to his assassination in August 2011, Muammar Gaddafi
was generally heralded by advocates of pan-Africanism as a
great unionist leader--despite obvious facts to the contrary.
In fact, some even considered him then to be the rightful heir
to Nkrumah's pan-Africanism (and hence the champion of
African Unity [AU]). Such fortuitous approval of Gaddafi
unionist credentials had--mirabile dictu--been made in bla-
tant disregard to his divisive stance vis-à-vis Nigeria's polit-
ico-religious crisis, which could easily be replicated across
the whole of colonial Africa. In any event, the prevailing ido-
lum that the culture values of the indigenous peoples of colo-
nial Africa are inferior to the dominant politico-religious
cultures imposed on them by agents of colonialism is widely
approved by local politicians. It should therefore not come as
surprise that the main beneficiaries of Gaddafi's financial
intrigue among the satraps (leaders?) of the African states
(and leaders of African communities in the diaspora) had in
the past overlooked the divisive statements of that erratic
character, who until his demise disguised himself for a
staunch defender of the AU.
For example, speaking to the mammoth crowd that braved
the afternoon heat in Nakivubo War Memorial Stadium after
leading the Thuhur (afternoon) prayers, Muammar Gaddafi
(on the occasion to openAfrica's largest Mosque in Kampala)
stated that "any Bible or Tora (Old Testament) that does not
mention prophet Mohamed was written by mankind and
therefore a fraud."3
Despite his Islamic bias, Professor Ali A. Mazrui--on
the occasion of Kwame Nkrumah's 100th Anniversary--
postulated Gaddafi as the timely heir to Nkrumah's legacy
of pan-Africanism (Mazrui, 2009). Even Gaddafi's app-
roval of the partitioning of Nigeria into Christians- and
Moslems-dominated pseudoethnic state-nations had also
been largely overlooked by most local commentators. In
fact, the official condemnation issued by the foreign min-
istry in Nigeria (after Gaddafi's divisive remarks) amounts
to such nugatory statement as "Colonel Gaddafi's irre-
sponsible utterances" or "his theatrics and grandstanding
at every auspicious occasion have become too numerous to
recount." Astonishingly, that was the official response to
Gaddafi's overt approval of the partition of India in 1947
as the kind of historic solution that could benefit Nigeria.4
If anything, such a divisive statement does not seem to
have come from someone who in 2009-2010 was the chair-
person the AU.
True, prior to becoming the AU chairperson in 2009,
Gaddafi was factitiously outspoken about the urgent need for
Guevara 3
a United States of Africa,5 And had once stated that "I shall
continue to insist that our sovereign countries work to
achieve the United States of Africa."6 He even went as far
"envisaging a single military force, a single currency, and a
single passport for the Africans to move freely around the
continent."7 Probably attracted by the Bantu-Ethiopian
Pharaonic title, the then Libyan strongman had earlier a
group of 200 traditional African chiefs named him the "King
of kings," thus signaling his disdain for the prevailing demo-
cratic nostrum being imposed on the African states by
Western powers. Speaking at the AU summit in Addis Ababa
in 2009, Gaddafi was aplomb and perhaps atarvistic about
the shortcomings of democracy in Africa. As he puts it,
Africa was essentially tribal; and multiparty democracy only
worsens the situation as most political parties draw their core
support base along tribal lines. Thus, his radical solution for
Africa's tribal political allegiances was the Libyan example
where opposition parties were outlawed.8
His Arabo-Islamic bias became more apparent when he
insisted on the inclusion of the Islamic code of practice in
AU decision-making process in which "silence on important
policy issues is considered a tacit approval."9
Gaddafi's Arabo-Islamic bias notwithstanding, his cun-
ning admiration of the indigenous Pharaonic model10 doubt-
lessly earned him then the allegiance and support of some
traditional chiefs, which, in the event of genuine national
revival, would have weighed significantly on the conscience
of the Azanians. This notwithstanding, it should be empha-
sized that not all pan-Africanists were comfortable with
Gaddafi's grand political ambitions. For instance, Yao
Graham, who is critical of the AU's choice of Gaddafi as the
Union chairperson in 2009, argued vehemently against con-
fusing Gaddafi's political opportunism with Nkrumah's pan-
African dreams. Citing the much quoted phrase of David
Rooney's Critical Biography on Kwame Nkrumah, "His
hopes were encapsulated in his ultimate goal of a united
Africa in which its rich natural resources would benefit its
people and not the capitalist system and other exploiters," he
cautioned against accrediting Gaddafi with Nkrumah's grand
unionist credentials (Yao, 2009).
Indeed, whether or not Gaddafi merits the credit of a gen-
uine unionist leader is ineluctably pivotal in that while he
would have imposed the Arabic language and the Islamic
faith on the indigenous people of a United States of Africa;
and had in the past also used the pelf of Libya to finance the
destabilization of African states south of the Nubian Desert
(e.g., Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Somalia, Ethiopia,
Nigeria, and Uganda); and had even implicitly sponsored the
displacement and misappropriation of indigenous land in
Mali, Niger and Mauritania, and so on to make more
"Lebensraum for the `Second-Phase' of Arabs colonial
expansion" (Chinweizu, 2006); there is no doubt that most
pan-Africanists would rather shy away from Nkrumah's
political shortcomings vis-à-vis his people's culture quest for
real freedom and national unity.
I observed in Azanism that Kwame Nkrumah was also
forthrightly outspoken about his internationalist ambitions
and, above all, his commitment to scientific socialism. Thus,
in genuine national context (in which the freedom of a peo-
ple is the inspiration behind nationalist movements), that
Kwame Nkrumah--in light of his fortuitous conviction to
the lineal/progressive economic ideal of scientific social-
ism--would have exonerated Karl Marx11 (from his ambiva-
lent approval of British colonial rule in India or the superior
Germanics colonization of Peasant Slavs in Europe) is bound
to taint Nkrumah's national credentials significantly.
Nkrumah's generous political (and not cultural) commitment
toAU until his death in 1972 could be summed up in his link-
ing of Gold Coast or modern Ghana's independence to that
of the rest of colonial Africa, as in this statement
die Freiheit und Unhängigkeit Ghanas ist bedeutunglos, wenn
sie nicht mit den totalen Befreiung Afrikas verknüft wird [The
Independence of Ghana is meaningless unless it is linked up
with that of the total liberation of the African continent].
(Hannah, 1967, p. 203)
However, his ambivalent approval of the atrocities associ-
ated with scientific socialism raises more questions about his
genuine commitment to the freedom of his people. If any-
thing, it should thus be emphasized that Kwame Nkrumah,
like Yao Graham who today (like most pan-African cadres)
lauds his democratic bias, was equally enthusiastic about his
contemporary "Scientific Socialism."12
Inevitably, Nkrumah's myopic political obligation to the
lineal economic ideal of his contemporary scientific social-
ism made him, like some of his predecessors,13 yet another
victim of similar political marriages that was to later cement
the incremental infiltration and destruction of the Bantu/
Cushitic-Ethiopians culture institutions by economically
inspired political influx mainly from the north and northeast-
ern fringes of the Azanian nation. Lamentably, that such
political influx then and now has the intent of seizing control
of the culture centers of the Azanian nation and her vast natu-
ral resources also found mention in Diop's (1974) African
Origin of Civilization: Myth or Reality.
The Persistence of the Indigenous Culture and Its
Importance to National Revival
In light of the fact that, prior to being a committed pan-
Africanist, Nkrumah was first an advocate of West Azania's
(Africa's?) independence and unity via scientific socialism
(as this is evidenced by his invocation of the concept of
Nhana/ancient Ghana for his supposedly newly indepen-
dent Gold Coast), let's critically review the culture essence
of Nhana so as to demonstrate why national emancipation
process that fails to embrace the institutions of indigenous
4 SAGE Open
culture(s) is bound to be superficial and tenuous. For
instance, Diop (1959), who had researched the social history
of the Bantu-Ethiopians extensively, traces the concept of
Nhana back to the demise of Meroe14--one of the last ref-
uges of the retreating custodians of the Azanian national cul-
ture. Although there is still no academic consensus about the
origin of Nhana per se, most scholars now agree that that
kingdom was a genuine indigenous communal or social
endeavor; and that most of the indigenous subculture groups
of (what is formally) the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) region played a pivotal role in its
foundation (Hannah, 1967). Importantly, in its over thousand
years history (which began around the 1st century a.d.), the
culture and political influence of Nhana stretched from the
Western fringes of present day Sudan covering the whole of
the ECOWAS region (West Sudan) and parts of Southern and
Central Algeria and Morocco. Consequently, any political
attempt to resuscitate the concept of Nhana would inelucta-
bly have had wider cultural implications for the region's
indigenous communities. In fact, judging from that concept
of culture significance and/or its indispensability in terms of
those people's moral obligation to the institutions of Azanian
culture (e.g., in Manfou(i)r [Menefre]/Memphis, Aiwn [On]
Beth-Shemesh or Heliopolis, Karnak/Luxor/Thebes, and or
Meroe, etc.), it would have been inconceivable for genuine
nationalists to associate themselves with such economically
derived external political ideas which historically are respon-
sible for the demise of the Azanian culture.
Even if one would contest the Azanian nationalists proc-
lamation that the foundation stone of Nhana was laid by
descendants of the Bantu-Ethiopian Pharaohs, who, in that
critical period of their nation's social history, were busily
relocating that nation's invaluable culture heritage to a secure
location, the convincing parallels drawn in Azanism between
the Moabas Sun-God Hyen-Nu (One Hand) and the dynastic
Ethiopian (and later Egyptian) Heru/Horus (or Amon and
Aton15), and the similarities also shown in that work between
the kingship title of the Moab[a]s, Bét (messenger, announcer,
teller, etc.) and Bes-Ptah of the early Pharaonic culture unde-
niably tilts in favor of culture contiguity. In fact, according to
the mythological stipulation of the Moabas origin, especially
the group which identifies itself as "Luok-Niib" (inhabitants
of the Underworld16), their early male ancestor (Nyaan), like
Bes-Ptah (and his seven deified-assistants), who founded the
first earthly Order (after the perfect/prehuman World Order
founded by Hyen-Nu), had four wives--each representing
probably the geographical axis of mainland Azania or the
quadrant angles the matriarchal foundation of the Pyramids--
who bore him seven sons. These became the seven extant
ethnic extensions of that Bantu-Ethiopian subculture group,
which could not only be rightly paralleled with the assistants
of Bes-Ptah, but also made up the 12 astronomical figures
represented in the so-called ancient Egyptian Calendar. Also,
in his Signs and Symbols of Primordial Man: The Evolution
of Religious Doctrines from the Eschatology of Ancient
Egyptians, Albert Churchward (1994), who researched the
traditional customs of the local population, observed that that
symbolic culture figure "Seven" is in widespread use across
the whole of Azania. Thus, if anything, it is culturally impel-
ling that the elderly of the Moabas are morally constrained
from eating the flesh of the predynastic Crocodile deity
Subk/Sebek. And the same is true of the culture custodians of
the Bawulés (in Ivory Coast), who until today refrain from
eating the flesh of rams--the culture symbol of Amon. By
similar analytical token, a critical review of that mysterious
culture animus, Bamaka-Koo (Crocodile of water), from
whence Bamako (Mali's capital) is derived, would confirm
that Bamaka-Koo has indeed conceptual affinity with the
Sebek deity of the dynastic period. And the same could be
argued of the mysterious eternal giant black Serpent of the
Dogon Pantheon.
Not surprisingly, the wealth and demise of ancient Ghana
unavoidably found mythological elaboration in a ritualistic
practice in honor of a giant black Serpent, Bida. However,
unlike the giant black serpent which, in a genuine culture
context, symbolizes the eternal Spirit of the Bantu-Ethiopians
common ancestry (placed on an Island at the sources of the
White Nile in Azanism), Bida had--by the time of Nhana's
demise--inherited the cannibalistic psychology associated
with the political cultures of the incoming barbarians (from
the north and northeastern fringes bordering the Azanian
nation), who, as noted earlier, were largely responsible for
the incremental destruction of the institutions of the Azanian
culture.17 Thus, whether or not such interrelated and sym-
bolic culture practices and/or norms, especially the moral
refrain from cannibalism, reflect the true objective of the
Azanian culture,18 it can be stressed without erring that the
Moabas played a central role in the foundation of Nghana. In
fact, in Azanism, I derived the concept of Nghana (am I
good?) from Moar/Molé--the language of the Moabas. This
culturally pivotal Bantu-Ethiopian group is referred to in
William's (1989) work as Patan-Grumah (a federation of the
former Mossi Kingdom). He described them as a sedentary
folk, who (in Azanism) are still found in present day Chad,
Guinea, modern Nhana (Ghana?), Mali, Niger, Sudan,
To[n]go, and probably beyond. Accordingly, despite the fact
that the social psychology of those who still associate them-
selves with the concept of colonial Africa is being influenced
by external political ideas, the Azanians could forestall the
pan-Africanists political preference of pseudoethnic entities
(e.g., Biafra, Hutustans, Eritrea, etc. in Africa) by adversely
opting for the total liberation of Azania (and with it the rein-
stitutionalization of her culture institutions).
Alas, Kwame Nkrumah was not alone in his readiness to
relinquish northern Azania to Arabs colonial occupation. In a
privately circulated article titled, "Nyerere's Last Advice to
Black Africa--Retreat From Continentalist to Sub-Saharan
pan-Africanism," Chinweizu (1987), the author of
Decolonizing the African Mind, hinted to the fact that the late
Julius Nyerere, who in 1963 considered colonial Africa to be
Guevara 5
single geopolitical unit (with its present inhabitants repre-
senting one geopolitical constituency), was apt to declare in
1997 that Africa South of the Sahara should henceforth be
considered a distinct political unit which is quite separate in
its identity and destiny from the Arabs-occupied part of
Africa (see Godfrey, n.d.). While Chinweizu is doubtlessly
vocal about the resurgence of Arab colonialism in Africa
since the 1960s--after the "First Phase" was interrupted by
the political development of the Ottoman Empire--and later
West Europeans colonial inroads into Africa between the 17
and 20th centuries, and tends to share Nyerere's proposition
to unify the indigenous population of colonial Africa South
of the Nubian (Sahara?) desert, it seems rather unclear
whether such a political union would imply relinquishing the
"Sacred Land" of the Bantu-Ethiopians national culture to
Arab colonialism. This notwithstanding, Chinweizu's lament
about the erosion of traditional culture norms amid the con-
tinuing colonial pressures and his urge on the need for the
indigenous people of colonial Africa to resuscitate the cul-
ture institutions of their forebears as guidance for the
future--in many of his privately circulated writings--merits
nationalists attention.
Also, despite most pan-Africanists capitulation to the
pending Arab colonialism, there is no doubt that Kwame
Nkrumah's invocation of such culture terms as Nhana
(1957) and Azania (1958) for the former Gold Coast and
South Africa, respectively, and/or Nyerere's perception of a
people's identity and destiny would resonate ethno-culturally
among revivalist intellectuals. Furthermore, Professor Ali A.
Mazrui's distinction between "Africans of the Blood and
Africans of the Soil" is contemporaneous with national
reproduction ideas in that he rightly includes the Azanians
(Africans?) of the Diaspora (i.e., the Azanian Americans) in
his list of the indigenous Azanians (or his Africans of the
Blood and Soil). Notably, he defined this original group in
racial and genealogical terms; and hence identifies them with
the Blackness of Cham/Kemit. However, most Algerians,
Libyans, Egyptians, Tunisians, and Moroccans are those of
the soil and not necessarily of Blood (see Mazrui, 2009).
In genuine national context, revivalists could reasonably
argue that in addition to the irreducibility of the Nile Valley
region to the culture custodians of the Azanian nation
(because of the process of the "Ritual of Resurrection"), the
fact that among the citizens of Arabs-occupied part of colo-
nial Africa there are indigenous Azanians (e.g., the Nubians,
the assimilated or aboriginalArabs such as the blackArabs in
Sudan or the so-called Semitic Ethiopians or Somalians) is
bound to have serious ethno-culture and national implica-
tions for those Pan-Africanists who (in their blind service of
the colonial ideal [Africa's 53 states]) would rather forego
the sacred land of the Azanians to Arab colonialism. Despite
their subordinate economic and political status under the
pending Arab colonial occupation, these marginalized and
neglected indigenous Azanians must be encouraged to resist
the colonial pillage of their ancestral (Cham's) land.
Are We at the Verge of a Genuine
Ethno-Cultural National Reawakening?
Even provided we eschew Gaddafi's plaudit of pseudoethnic
entities in Africa because of the political reality in Libya
today, the fact that key members of the AU overtly condoned
the NATOAir Strikes which led to overthrow of the Gaddafi's
regime (and his consequent assassination) shows how futile
the AU really is. Already, Gaddafi's early emphatic approval
of the creation of pseudoethnic entities in Nigeria amounts to
declaring the whole pan-African project moribund. So, even
if the pan-Africanists would forgive the late Gaddafi for his
direct role in the destabilization of other African states (e.g.,
Chad, Mali, Niger, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Uganda,
etc.) in the recent past, the universal indifference of Arab
leaders to the systematic genocide and ethnic cleansing in
Sudan (e.g., in Dafur, South Kordofan, the Nuba Mountains,
etc.), and/or their silence on the deportation of hundreds of
thousands of indigenous Azanians from Mauritania in the
late 1970s and 1080s indicate that Arab leaders have an
entirely different agenda for participating in the political pro-
cess of the AU. For instance, I noted in Azanism that revival-
ist intellectuals do not necessarily have to invoke the decline
of the culture institutions of Uruk (Sumer/Sumeria), which at
the onset was founded and controlled by Anu (and his daugh-
ter Ishtar/Isis),19 and/or the directly related historic occupa-
tion of the Delta region by the Hyksos, to grasp the
geographical reach of their nation's culture institutions. In
fact, Amélineau Abbé Emile (1916), who had mistaken the
Anu for an ethnic group, is also quoted in Diop's (1974)
African Origin of Civilization: Myth or Reality (see Guevara,
2009/2011) as stating that the Anu people were the original
inhabitants of Egypt and Arabia Patraea. So, the fact that
some of these occupied territories are now considered indig-
enous to Arab colonialists suffices as a warning to revivalist
intellectuals who still see the Great Nile Valley region as an
irreducible part of their nation's culture practices.
In essence, this analytical discernment which, as men-
tioned earlier, is meant to reintegrate the subcultures of the
indigenous Azanians into the main culture school in Karnak/
Luxor does not necessarily imply that Karnak is the birth
place of the Bantu/Cushitic-Ethiopians national culture.
Thus, in referring to the celestial orientation of the Bantu-
Ethiopians national culture, I argued in Azanism that the
placement of the green Nile goddess Hapi on the Mountain
of the Moon (mountain Kilimanjaro), the Highest peak in
Azania, prior to the construction of the miniature Pyramids
in Meroe and then later the Great Pyramids of Giza--built
during the period of the Solar Mythos (as by then the culture
custodians of the Azanian nation would have probably
established the precise location from which they could com-
municate proficiently with the celestial bodies)--suggests
that the origin of that particular national culture lies further
South, as in this Neferti's optimism about the eventual res-
toration of the Maat:
6 SAGE Open
A king will come from the South;
Ameni, the justified, is his name,
The son of a woman of Nubia,
and a child of Upper Egypt,
He shall receive the white crown and wear the red crown.
(Neferti, 57-59, quoted in Karenga, 2006, pp. 73-74ff)
This perception is further strengthened by the fact that the
popular "Ritual [of Ausar/Osiris] Resurrection," which at its
peak, began with the introduction of the Sektit/Seher (also
called Hennu's) Boat through the tale of the Great Nile in the
Delta region ended at the source of the great Nile River in the
Congo-belt, where the eternal Spirit of the Bantu-Ethiopians
ancestors (in the form of a giant black Serpent) was origi-
nally located. Eventually, whether or not one equates the
symbolic culture act of having to travel upstream against the
waves of the great Nile River with the idea of traveling
through the culture symbol of the eternal Spirit of the
Azaninans'common ancestry, it remains to be said that (from
the perspective of the Azanian national culture) the quest for
eternity was never meant to be entrusted to the profane or the
vulgar demoi. Hence, neither the wheel of the Hennu's Boat
nor the presentation of the Maat was confided to the profane/
demoi. In other words, that all Azanians are in line with the
moral objective of their nation's culture entitled to the right
kind of knowledge about eternal life does not necessarily
reduce the gerontocratic constitution of the Bantu/Cushitic-
Ethiopians pharaonic culture. In this sense, the embracement
of the market-led liberal democratic institutions by both the
founding fathers and current leaders of PAMs and/or the AU
not only shows how disingenuous these really are on the sub-
ject of the emancipation of the Azanians but also how irrec-
oncilable their political objectives are in juxtaposition to that
of the Azanian culture.
The eternal essence of that nation's culture practice has
found its convincing elaboration in Doctrina Azanica
(Azanism). This position is also shared in Maulana Karenga's
Maatian ethics. For instance, drawing on King Kheti's justifi-
cation for the practice of Maat, Karenga (2006) observed that
"the stress on justification is not simply in the sense of being
just but also in a sense of living Maat that would justify
immortality" (p. 60). Maat is described as "nourishment for
Ra (the perfect embodiment of life); Ra lives by it, it is offered
to him and it is also his daughter" (Karenga, 2006, p. 64).
Maat is also a nourishment for all the divinities as well as
humans who strive for eternity, as stressed in Coffin Text
(CT) IV, 62, 170. Accordingly, the Maatian ethics which orig-
inated from the cultural history of the Old Kingdom was, first,
established as a moral order with divine, natural and social
dimensions. Secondly, Maat is counter-posed with isfet (evil,
chaos, wrong-doing) as well as with . . . grg (falsehood) and
wrong-doing. Thirdly, Maat is a standard and measure of both
moral life on the personal and social level. Fourthly, Maat is tied
to the concept of moral and social excellence . . . and the resultant
worthiness. Finally, the ground of Maat is that it's God's will,
and thus the King's will and that it is good, effective and life-
giving. (Karenga, 2006, pp. 54-55)
Economic Agents' Political Role in the Demise of
the Azanian Culture
If from the onset of their nation's social history, the Azanians
had the moral obligation to endure such an indispensable cul-
ture journey that is likened to the traversing of the inner part
of a black Serpent (as in the Ritual of Resurrection), one
could reasonably foresee why the alliance of external and
internal political agents--inspired by myopic economic
objectives--have until today proven so detrimental to that
nation's culture institutions. Notably, "the divine inspiration
to cultivate a perfect humanity capable of inhabiting both the
terrestrial and celestial provinces"20 (as illustrated in the
celestial orientation of the Azanian culture earlier) is doubt-
lessly irreconcilable with the sanguinary trait of the econom-
ically inspired state system, whose expansive policies are
today responsible for the destruction of preestablished
culture(s). In terms of the demise of the institutions of the
Azanian national culture, historic records attest that the sys-
tematic/incremental infiltration (and usurpation) of that
nation's culture institutions by state agents goes as far back
as the antiquity. Early record of such economically inspired
political incursions is associated with the southward expan-
sion of the Greco-Europeans, who are generally known to
have introduced the patriarchal system (capitalist patriarchy)
in Azania. Importantly, one should read early Greco-
European migrations and settlements in three waves; and,
above all, in light of the culture deficit (and/or failures) of the
expansive state system. Ostensibly,
the first is associated with the Ionian and Dorian migrations of
the last century of the 2nd Millennium BCE, which resulted in
the settlements of City-States in Western Anatolia and was
probably associated with the "Sea Peoples" (Hyksos) who later
appeared in Egypt and Canaan (as the Philistines). The second
and third waves, which occurred around 800 and 600 BCE, were
highly organized land rush ... where City-States sought to
expand their influence and relieve over-population. (Guevara,
2012)21
Notably, the remark about the perpetual trend of the native
populations--and state agents rational historic response to
such a natural phenomenon through state expansionism--is
inevitably culturally imperative. That in turn impels this
ancient testimony about the economic mind approach to
native lands--the invaluable/irreducible culture assets of all
nations: "Joseph bought all the land of the Egyptians, except
only the land of the priests" (Genesis 47.22; Guevara, 2012,
pp. 11-12; Kalopoulos, 2003, p. 249), which was ceded to
Guevara 7
them by Ausar (Osiris; the god King) to cover the cost of
their rituals (Diodorus Siculus, 1.21.7; Guevara, 2012, pp.
11-12; Kalopoulos, 2003, p. 249). To get to that point, where
the indigenous population of the then occupied Egypt (north-
ern part of Azania) were politically coerced into selling their
land (the source of earthly life) in exchange for a grain of
corn from that early external capitalist agent (Joseph), the
bible tells us that there was this terrific famine of all times in
that part ofAzania.Although the bible has until now remained
silent on the question whether that could possibly have been
a man-made famine intended to force the local population off
their ancestral land, it can rightly be argued that such polit-
ico-economic developments explain why the culture custodi-
ans of the Bantu-Ethiopian kingdom have historically been
at the forefront of national emancipation and revival move-
ment. Notwithstanding, it is worth adding that by the turn of
the 7th century b.c. the culture center of the Azanian nation
(Karnak/Thebes) was largely under the political influence of
the alliance of external and internal economic forces. This
then explains the relocation of that nation's culture institu-
tions to other parts ofAzania, including Meroe whose demise
herald the rise of Nhana (ancient Ghana). And as we will
soon see, because the founders of Nhana not only inherited
the culture institutions of their forebears, but also, lamenta-
bly, the political intrigue that earlier cemented the disintegra-
tion of theAzanian nation, it was only a matter of time before
they too became victims of similar intrigue.
Indeed, economically, early Greek, Roman, and Christian
writers had extolled the fruits of the Bantu-Ethiopians
national culture, as in Homer's Iliad:
Royal Thebes
Egyptian treasure house of countless wealth,
Who boast her hundred gates through each of which,
With horses and two hundred warriors march. (see Homer's
Iliad, 9, 381ff; Guevara, 2009/2011, pp. 219-220)
Regarding the economic autarky of the ancient Ethiopian
Kingdom, Strabo described ancient Egypt as "from the begin-
ning the most self-sufficient land on the earth" (Kalopoulos,
2003, p. 252 cited in Guevara, 2009/2011, p. 220). A point
also reiterated in early biblical scripts "was watered as
Gardens of the Lord, as the land of Egypt" (Genesis 13.10;
Guevara, 2009/2011, pp. 219-220; Kalopoulos, 2003, p. 252).
By similar analytical token, it could be stressed without
erring that, in its over thousand years history, the kingdom of
Nhana boasted similar
economic achievements with extensive economic relations
stretching as far as Portugal, Spain, and probably beyond. In the
culture front, credible evidence attests that late Egyptian,
European, and Asian students had erstwhile studied Philosophy,
Law, Mathematics, and Medicine in the tertiary institutions/
Universities of ancient Ghana. (Hannah, 1967, p. 201)
Subsequently, the mythological stipulation about the
wealth and decline of ancient Ghana through the giant black
serpent (Bida), whose psychological existence depended on
the blood of virgin lives (Auset/Isis's life?), not only amounts
to a total aberration from the ethical norms of the Azanian
culture, but, above all, also reveals an unbearable state of
moral decadence, at least on the part of that kingdom's elites,
by the time of Nhana's demise. In contrast to the life-serving
purpose of the Azanian national culture, we are told that the
sanguinary Bida demanded an annual sacrifice of beautiful
virgins in return for guaranteeing the prosperity of ancient
Ghana. The year in which the fiancé (Mamadu Sarolle) res-
cued the intended victim unleashed Bida's wrath in the form
of a drought that covered the whole kingdom. Consequently,
gold mining, among others, fell into decline and with it the
disintegration of ancient Ghana.22
Apart from the analogy of Bida's mythology with the
human-sacrificing rituals known of the Artemis cult (and/or
other foreign deities like Allt and Ashirath, etc.), whose fol-
lowers were to later incrementally infiltrate and usurp the
institutions of the Bantu/Cushitic-Ethiopians national cul-
ture, the fact that the then Islamized Mamadu Sarolle was the
fiancé of Bida's last victim, whose rescue unleashed that ser-
pent's scorching wrath culminating in the demise of Nhana,
suggests that by the time of Nhana's disintegration external
political influence had indeed permeated the psychology of
some local leaders (and with them the large sections of the
local population as well). Critics could, for example, contrast
Bida's deviant sanguinary reach with the biblical testimony
that Abraham refrained from sacrificing his son Isaac after
his encounter with the culture symbol of Amon, the ram.
Furthermore, Maulana Karenga, who has critically
explored the traditional emphasis of the Maatian ethnics,
draws our attention to the centrality of traditional norms
through the valuable teachings of Merikare:
Emulate your fore-parents, your ancestors.
Lo, their words endure in books.
Open and read them and emulate their knowledge.
For one who is taught becomes skilled. (Karenga, 2006, pp.
60-61; Merikare, pp. 35-3623)
Hence, the Maatian ethics, which was originally meant to
instruct the wise, "comes to her/him in its pure essence like
the condition of the sayings of the ancestors" (Karenga,
2006, p. 60).
As Karenga further observes, the Book of Khunanup,
commonly called "The Story of the Eloquent Peasant,"
which he described as a text on social justice and moral
8 SAGE Open
narrative, not only urges leaders to live Maat (truth, justice,
righteousness) but also reminds them that long life and
immortality are based on Maatian conduct. Thus, "doing
Maat (justice), so Khunanup (the Peasant), is like a breath to
the nose" (Karenga, 2006, p. 70). Moreover, the rejection of
isfet (evil) through the Maatian conduct is not only in line
with tradition, but is importantly a yearning for the eternal
qualities of Ra, the authentic source of Maat and light-giver.
Thus, in CT II, 149, the deceased says, "I shine like Ra daily,
I establish Maat and expel falsehood."
I am (one) who obeys no magic, who is not scorched by fire nor
wet by water.
I will be like Ra every day
One who will be fashioned everyday by the
Sun-folk who saw yesterday. (CT II, 54; Karenga, 2006, p. 64)
Despite having derived such fervent nostalgic longing for
tradition from the First Intermediate and Middle Kingdoms,
the literary texts from these periods diverge considerably
from that of the Old Kingdom. Texts dated from this period
show evidence of provincial rulers increasing independence
and years of famine which created huge problems (Karenga,
2006; Vandier, 1936) across the kingdom. As Assmann
rightly observed,
a fundamental characteristic of Maatian discourse in the Old
Kingdom is that there appears to be, at least formally, an implicit
"Selsbtverständlichkeit" attached to Maat. [Hence,] it was not
put in question and therefore not thematized. Everyone knew
what Maat was. There arose no communicative need to come to
an understanding concerning it. (Assmann, 1990, p. 55; Karenga,
2006, pp. 55-56)
But with the breakdown of social order from this period,
"L'évidence naturelle de la Maat, incoprporée dans le roi
s'est decompose. La Maat, devenue problématique, deviant
thématisable" [The natural evidence of MAAT embodied in
the King was decomposed. MAAT having become problem-
atic, became thematizable] (Assmann, 1989, p. 34). Not sur-
prisingly, "Offering Maat to God which earlier is posed as
social practice later emerges as a central ritual as depicted in
the iconography of the New Kingdom and Late periods"
(Karenga, 2006, pp. 55-58; Teeter, 1990, 1997).
Ostensibly, I have explored in considerable detail (in
Azanism) the role external and internal political forces played
in undermining the institutions of the Bantu-Ethiopians phar-
aonic culture, especially during the reign of Amenophis III
and IV. For our present purpose, let's then assume that
Akhenaten/Echnaton's radical aberration from traditional
culture norms (as validated by the sand mounds of al Amarna
in Arabs-occupied Egypt) was the historic precedent of
Bida's transformation from being originally the symbolic
representation of the eternal Spirit of the Bantu-Ethiopians
common ancestry into a monstrous political deity, whose
psychological existence depended on the blood of virgin
Auset(s). Without such external political interventions the
pseudocultural developments that was to later cement the
demise of the institutions of the Azanian culture would have
been unthinkable--not in Manfouir/Menefre (Greeks
Memphis), Iwnu/ [w]anu (Greeks Heliopolis, Jewish Beth-
Shemesh or the biblical On), Karnak/Thebes, Napata, Meroe,
or later Kimbé Salah/Saleh (the capital of Nhana).
As for the demise of Nhana, Arabo-Islamic tradition also
attests to the fact that Almoravid Muslims from the North
succeeded in infiltrating the kingdom incrementally and
eventually invaded it. Initially, the Islamic community at
Kimbé Saleh remained a separate community some distance
away from the king's palace. It even had its own mosques
and schools, while the king retained his traditional beliefs. In
the kingdom's closing days, however, traditional kings had
to rely on Muslim scholars to run the administration of the
territory. With Takrur to the west already transformed into an
Islamic community, which then evolved ever closer trading
ties with the Arabs-occupied part of colonial Africa, it was
only a matter of time before Kimbé Saleh, whose local lan-
guages in some parts of the city were already deemed sacri-
lege for Islamic practices, would succumb to the same
political pressures that earlier cemented the demise of the
Azanian nation.
With the demise of Nhana in the 13th century a.d.,24 it
was only ineluctable that such weak unviable tribal entities
as theAshanti-, Mali-, Mossi-, Shongai- and the Oyo empires,
and/or, tragically, the Hausas's city-states became the univer-
sally approved political norm in the entire region. As we are
by now aware, these have since been replaced by the postco-
lonial African states, which lamentably also owe their origin
to the Westphalian heritage. At this analytical juncture, genu-
ine nationalist/revivalist intellectuals are simply reminded
that the relative ease with which Ivory Coast, Libya, and
Mali recently succumbed to the prevailing colonial yoke
suggests that maintaining the African states amounts to noth-
ing less than an ethnocide.
Ethnic and Culture Reintegration as Nationalist
Rejection of the Colonial Heritage
If indeed the enfeebled Hausas's city-states, which in the
18th century fell so miserably to Osman Dan Fodio's Arabo-
Islamist forces (not to mention the fact that both Mali and
Nigeria, in short the AU, are presently heavily reliant on
their former European colonial masters in their fight against
the resurgent Arabo-Islamic colonialism), are the future
political ideal pan-African intellectuals and leaders would
envisage for Africa's pseudoethnic (tribal) entities, they
should be reminded that--in genuine national context--the
Hausas, like other subculture groups of Nhana, attest to
sharing the same ancestral lineage with the rest of the Bantu/
Guevara 9
Cushitic-Ethiopians. In fact, Dan Masanin--a Hausa histo-
rian, Maitama Sule, who is also a leading figure in the Kano
Emirate, not only believes in an authentic ethnic connection
spanning the whole of the indigenous inhabitants of Azania
but also argues credibly that the Hausas are ethno-culturally
linked to the rest of the Cushitic-Ethiopians. He even goes
further to cite linguistic similarities as well as the fact that
these subculture groups shared the worship of the Sun-god
prior to the introduction of Christianity and Islam in colo-
nial Africa. If anything, most informed Hausas not only
believe to be the original inhabitants of the Nubian
(Saharan?) Desert region but are also convinced that some
of their leaders are descendants of the indigenous Pharaohs.
Even today, the palace of Daura contains a sword which
some Hausas believe came from the pharaohs.25
Furthermore, in the mythological stipulation about the
origin of the Hausas, we also learn about the "Hausa Bakwai"
(seven Hausas), Kano, Zazzau (Zaria), Gobir, Katsina, Rano,
Daura, and Biram, and the "Banza Bakwai" (Zamfara,
Kebbik, Nupe, Gwari, Yauri, Yoruba, and Kororofa). This
other seven Hausas are considered to be the descendants of
an extramarital affair between the Hausas's male ancestor
Bawa and a concubine. The significance of this latter narra-
tive is not only the inclusion of Yoruba among the common
lineage of the Hausas but also the fact that it contains a fan-
tastic twist that purports a genealogical link between the
Hausas and the Arabs. And as we shall see, this latter legend-
ary narrative merely reveals the creative genius of later
Islamized Hausa scholars, who might have desperately tried
to reconcile local myths with incoming Arabo-Islamic influ-
ences. Thus, just as early Arabic and Islamic scholars estab-
lished a spurious ancestral link with the biblical Abraham
and his Cushitic-Ethiopian (Egyptian?) wife, so too did polit-
ical-expedient Hausas, whose legitimacy as leaders was by
now not based on their elevated knowledge of the local cul-
ture but instead dependent on their genealogical link to the
founder (prophet) of Islam, see the need to reinvent their
ancestral history in line with the Arabo-Islamic leadership
model. In any event, Islamized Hausas and Fulanis are not
idiosyncratic in making such spurious claims. It is an estab-
lished norm in colonial Africa that most local leaders subser-
vient to Arabo-Islamic political influence are one way or the
other genealogical linked to Prophet Mohammed. Thus,
when I left Luanda ([A]Ngola, South West Azania,) in the
early 1990s, Islam was virtually nonexistent. It was recently
introduced into that part of Azania by local converts from the
Great Lakes region and/or West and North Azania. But that
should not preclude the possibility that there might already
be some politically conscious converts who conceive the
need to establish such a genealogical lineage. One must not
forget that the legitimacy and future of Morocco's (heredi-
tary) Monarchy hinges on similar spurious assumptions.
If anything, this critical review of the mythology of Bida
and that of the Hausas's origin suffice to validate the forego-
ing arguments. In the myth of the Hausas origin, we are told
that the son of Bagdad king (Bayajidda or Abuyazidu) had a
quarrel with his father, and, consequently, left Bagdad only
to find himself in Daura (one of the seven city-states of the
Hausas, north of Kano). While in Daura, Bayajidda (out-
sider) found out that the local inhabitants were being terror-
ized and deprived of drinking water by a giant serpent, which
took over the well of the local community. As gratitude for
Bayajidda's brave act in killing that giant serpent, the king of
Daura gave him his daughter to marry. Their first son Bawa
(servant) went forth to give birth to the Hausa­Bakwai
(founders of the seven city-states of the Hausas).26
Putting aside the question why the entire population of
Daura would in those days have depended on a single well
for its source of drinking water, critics are reminded that the
time Osman Dan Fodio's Arabo-Islamic forces captured the
city-states of the Hausas Bagdad (Iraq) was among the most
important centers of Islamic scholarship. Moreover, with the
inclusion of the "Hausa Bakwai" and "Banza Bakwai" in this
legend, one could reasonably perceive a rational incorpora-
tion of incoming Arabo-Islamic patriarchal influences in the
myth of Hausas's origin. Thus, just as Sarah--Abraham's
first and legitimate wife--begot Isaac (the male ancestor of
the Hebrews), and his illegitimate Nuba­Egyptian wife,
Hagar, begot Ismael (the presumed male ancestor of the
Arabs), so too had the Hausas's male ancestors both legiti-
mate and illegitimate sons. Bayajidda's killing of the giant
black serpent (the primordial embodiment of the eternal
spirit of the Bantu-Ethiopians ancestry) tends to add even
more to that romanticized legend in that it not only incorpo-
rates elements of the mythology of Bida but also implicitly
invokes the wholly politicized biblical narration depicting
Abraham's sacrificial killing of the culture symbol of Amon
(ram) in the place of his son Isaac--during the occupation of
Lower Egypt by the Hyksos. In viewing this, are we not deal-
ing here with a systematic external political attempt to extir-
pate the culture/mythical symbols of the Bantu-Ethiopians
national culture?
In contrast, I observed in Azanism that the blood that cir-
culates the veins of the culture symbols of the Bantu-
Ethiopians Kingdom (e.g., the Ram or the Apis Bull of
Manfouir/Menefre) is dependent entirely on the vegetation
(remedy) ofAusar/Osiris resurrection. Moreover, thatAnubis
and the Subk/Sebek deity, the predynastic crocodile deity of
the Moabas (Moabites of pre-Israelite Canaan?) or later the
culture symbol of the capital of the present day Mali
(Bamaka-ko [Crocodile of water]), were also included
among the Judges of the Dead during the dynastic Pharaonic
period begs the conclusion that the custodians of the Azanian
culture had erstwhile succeeded in acculturating these latter
cannibalistic animals in accord with the life-serving purpose
of genuine culture(s). In the case of Anubis, after it had lost a
survival (intellectual) contest against the Rabbit.27 With this
analytical discernment, revivalist intellectuals would simply
like to remind the pan-Africanist (and other pseudonational-
ist) intellectuals that we share the genuine
10 SAGE Open
nationalists position that the Bantu-Ethiopians are ethnically
and culturally akin, and that the prevailing (divisive) colonial
model influencing the psychology of the subjects of colonial
Africa is not a realistic substitute for genuine identity forma-
tion process. To strengthen this position, let's expound on the
history of the Dagbon (also known as the Dagbon-Molé) of
modern Nhana (Ghana?), as this adds more to the ongoing
analytical discernment in support of an ethno-culture national
identity for the Azanians.
In the mythology of the origin of the Dagbon-Molé one is
told that their male ancestor, Tohadzie--the red hunter--
descended from Zamfara (one of the "Banza Bakwai" of the
Hausas). The young Tohadzie, who, like his grandfather
Bayajidda, was doubtlessly driven by sociopolitical ambi-
tions, left Zamfara only to find himself in a town of the then
nascent Mali Empire. It would seem Tohadzie arrived in
Mali shortly after the disintegration of the kingdom of
Nhana. For, unlike Bayajidda, who earlier rescued the
indigenous inhabitants of Daura from the terror of a giant
black serpent which took control of the locals'only source of
drinking water, the brave Tohadzie had to grapple this time
with a black buffalo (the "Apis Bull" of Manfouir?), which
astonishingly not only took control of that Malian commu-
nity's only source of drinking water but also killed anyone
who dared to fetch water from that town's river.After leading
the drought-stricken community to slain their bestial enemy,
Tohadzie was also not only offered a Malian princess (called
Pagawugba) for marriage but he also eventually inherited the
throne of that local community. If anything, the newly wed-
ded royal couple eventually gave birth to a son (Kpognambo),
who, in line with the hereditary norm of the incoming patri-
archal model, was also imbued with Tohadzie gallantry and
hunting qualities.
Inasmuch as the killing of the eternal spirit of the Bantu-
Ethiopian ancestors by Bayajidda or the killing of the sacred
Apis Bull of Manfouir by his grandson Tohadzie is con-
cerned, it could reasonably be argued that the "Green
Crown," which originally had served as the legitimate geron-
tocratic title of the Pharaonic system had (after the demise of
Karnak) lost its culture significance, and the political events
that unfolded since then right through to the current political
crisis engulfing the whole ECOWAS region amounts to what
one could readily qualify as genuine political sorcery.
Succinctly, after the death of Kpognambo's parents, he
traveled westwards from the then Malian Empire to Buin (in
Fadan Grumah),28 where after defeating the Tendana, he
usurped the kingdom's throne and ruled it until his death.
In Buin, Kpognambo married two wives, Sihisabiga
(daughter of Buin spiritual leader) and Suhuyini (the daugh-
ter of the king of Fadan Grumah). Suhuyini gave birth to
Gbewaa29 and Sihisabiga gave birth to Malgimsi, Nyelgili,
and Mamzisheli.
After Kpognambo's death, and with replacement of the
gerontocratic constitution of the Azanian culture with the
incoming economically inspired patriarchal model, and with
four sons of an early political marriage vying for the throne
of Buin, it was only a matter of time before internal dissen-
sion fractured that kingdom. The ensuing conflicts forced
Gbewaa and his followers to emigrate to Pusiga, the Upper
Eastern region of modern Nhana (Ghana). Here, Naa
Gbewaa and his followers established the kingdom of greater
Dagbon, which he ruled until his death. Kpognambo's other
sons, Nyelgili founded the chieftainship of Nangodi and
Namzisheli founded Tongo.
Following the death of Naa Gbewaa, similar succession
wars ensued among his sons and grandsons. Such divisive
conflicts reached their peak when Zirli murdered his brother
Kufogu to inherit Biun's throne--and this much to the dis-
agreement of his other siblings. With that act, the final stage
was set for further conflicts leading to the eventual breakup
of the Dagbon Kingdom into the modern Dagbon kingdoms
(with their lion rulers; Staniland, 1975).
It was in the midst of such perdurable political crisis that
other Naa Gbewaa's sons, Sitobu, Tohagu, and Mantambo
migrated further southwards from Pusiga and found the
Manprusi Kingdom (Tohagu), the Nanun Kingdom
(Mantambo), and Sitobu, the modern Dagbon Kingdom.
Hence, the Nanun, Mamprugu, and Dagbon people consider
each other as brothers. In addition, a daughter of Naa
Gbewaa, Yentuagri, married a Patan Grumah and they found
the Mossi Kingdom. The narrative even goes on to add the
Kusasis and other groups of modern Ghana, To[n]go, and
Burkina Faso among descendants of the Dagbon.30 That the
Patan-Grumahs are today found in Mali, Niger, Guinea,
Chad, Sudan, and parts of Southern Libya, and so on suffices
to remind critics of the complexity involved in terms of iden-
tity formation process in Azania as a whole.
Important about this concise history of the Dagbon-Molé
is the interrelated ethnic role the Hausas and Patan-Grumahs
(the Moabas) have played in the emergence of the other sub-
culture groups (tribes?) of that region. Subsequently, in
Azanism, I referred to the Bantu-Ethiopian subculture group
called "Luok Niib" (inhabitants of the underworld) whose
seven male ancestors shared the same ancestral lineage and
who until today not only maintain the Subk/Sebek deity of
the predynastic period but also continue to worship Hyen-Nu
(Heru/Horus?).31 Furthermore, while the kingship titles of
the other subculture groups of Nhana are Nam, Naan, Naba
(also linked to Meroe), Nana, and so on, "Bét" (messenger),
which I paralleled with "Bes-Ptah" inAzanism, is the authen-
tic kingship title of Moabas. It is even culturally significant
that "Nab" in Moar/Molé means cow; and indigenous
Pharaohs during the dynastic era were known to be referred
to as "bulls, either of the sky or earth" (Christopher, 2002).
Therefore, the custodians of the Azanian national culture,
who until this day consider the total liberation of the Nile
Valley region as concomitant to the reintroduction of the
"Ritual of Resurrection," which, as noted elsewhere, is irre-
ducibly bound with that peoples' culture quest for real free-
dom (as life in its eternal manifestation), will lament African
Guevara 11
leaders' and pan-African intellectuals' subscription to the
colonial African ideal as a total aberration from the genuine
national cause.
In fact, culturally speaking, apart from the promise of
paradise after the violent death of the profane in her or his
myrmidon service to the state system, leaders of the world's
dominant political religions, which continue to influence the
psychology of the subjects of colonial Africa, are far from
convincing genuine nationalists with their economic response
to the imminent culture challenge humanity faces, namely,
the perpetual growth of native populations. However, in con-
trast to the murderous reach of these political sorcerers (as in
the human-sacrificing rituals remarked elsewhere of foreign
political deities, which in contemporary context is merely
transmogrified into the incessant rivalries of the expansive
states), the custodians of theAzanian national culture were--
from the onset of their nation's social history--not only pre-
scient of that imminent culture challenge but even anticipated
that through the appropriate culture measures humanity is
intellectually capable of attaining real freedom. Accordingly,
the well-known "Ritual of Resurrection" in the "Book of
Coming Forth by Day" and the closely related culture pro-
cess of the "Mummification of the deceased indigenous
Pharaohs" should be seen as supplementary to the underly-
ing objective of theAzanian culture--that is eternity first and
then resurrection.
To transpose the afflatus of the Azanian culture radically,
the custodians of the culture institutions of the Bantu/
Cushitic-Ethiopians Pharaonic system are unanimous in their
convictionaboutthehomogeneity oflocal/nationalculture(s).
Nevertheless, they also tend to maintain that in each earthly
nation's culture quest for a superior (immortal) identity, lead-
ers of the various earthly nations would ineluctably arrive at
an epistemological junction (in the form of an Ankh), where
they would be summoned by the conscience of Universal
Existence to present their distinctive culture documents (e.g.,
the Maat) as testaments to each nation's nonpareil service to
Life. But, in light of the foregoing analysis, the panache of
the Bantu-Ethiopians culture school is simply that such a
conscious voluntary integration of the earthly nations culture
documents (is this the Universal Constitution of Nations?) at
the advent of a perfect humanity, which is capable of transit-
ing the terrestrial and celestial provinces must not be con-
fused with the democratic constitutions of existing Polities
(which are mainly composed of economic adventurers/spec-
ulators, political sorcerers, mother murderers, homosexuals,
pedophiles, etc.)--because the objective of the overarching
Constitution is the service of Life in her eternal manifesta-
tion. In other words, the perception that pristine culture must
be subservient to Life's purpose unequivocally contradicts
the prevailing multicultural casuistry at the base of the demo-
cratic constitution of the nation-state system, which, as
observed elsewhere, is--even if somehow panurgic and for-
tuitous--fully embraced by both AU leaders and PAMs
intellectuals.
Conclusion
Apodictically, this essaic-article took critical issue with the
mainstream views espoused mainly by agents of colonialism,
leaders and intellectuals of the PAMs and those of Africa's
tribal irredentism, that there is anything ethno-cultural (and
hence national) about the so-called African tribes. Drawing
largely from the social history of precolonial/prepolitical
Africa, that is, the Bantu/Cushitic-Ethiopians kingdom
(Azanian nation), I demonstrated lucidly and vividly that far
from being distinct ethno-culture nationalities as is often
portrayed in the mainstream scholarship, the African tribes
are better considered subculture groups, whose providential
and provincial culture norms and practices erstwhile paid
tribute to the objective of the Azanian culture. For instance,
using the culture symbols and practices of some local groups
and linking them to that of predynastic and dynastic
Pharaonic periods, I observed that there is compelling evi-
dence against qualifying the so-called African tribes as dis-
tinct ethno-culture national communities. In genuine culture
context, the old age Ritual of Resurrection and the interre-
lated culture process of the mummification of a deceased
indigenous Pharaohs attest that the moral objective of that
nation's culture is irreducibly subservient to Life's purpose
as exemplified by the immortality of Hyen-Nu (Heru/
Horus?). Furthermore, there are recurrent culturally sanc-
tioned ethical instances among the elderly of these subcul-
ture groups (e.g., the moral constraint from eating the flesh
of any of the culture symbols assigned to their nation's cul-
ture institutions such as the Subk/Sebek deity, the Apis Bull,
the ram symbol of Amon, etc.), which genuinely pay tribute
to the overarching culture norm. Moreover, the fact that at its
apogee, the process of the Ritual of Resurrection began in the
Delta region of the Nile Valley and ended at the Sources of
the White Nile, where the spirit of the deceased indigenous
Pharaohs was introduced into the pneumatic habitation of
their ancestors, contradicts conventional wisdom that ancient
Egypt (during the reign of the indigenous Pharaohs) was a
distinct national community isolated from the rest of Azania.
Therefore, the emphatic approval of the pending Arab colo-
nial occupation of the sacred land of the Bantu/Cushitic-
Ethiopians Kingdom-Azania and/or the approval of the
emergence of pseudoethnic identities on Africa's political
plain by the AU leadership and PAMs intellectuals indicate
how really disingenuous these are on the question of national
emancipation and unity.

Notes
1. Diop (1974), who discussed the culture significance of the
ancient Ethiopian Pan-deity Min in his African Origin of
Civilization: Myth or Reality, also stressed that only the indig-
enous Ethiopians were permitted to worship that national
deity. In Azanism, I derived the concept of "Min/Miné" (me)
from Moar/Molé in that the Moaba(s) are the only subculture
group of the Azanian nation which until today worship the
ancient Bantu-Ethiopians (and later ancient Egyptians) Sun-
God Hyen-Nu (One Hand). A concept later misappropriated by
the Greco-Europeans as Heru/Horus.
 2. Manfouir in Moar/Molé means Life. But it also means infi-
nite phenomenon, thereby making life an infinite phenom-
enon. Etymologically, it is a combination of two words,
Maann (phenomenon) and Fou(i)r (infinite), which is derived
from the verb fou(i)n (respiration). The belief in the infinite
phenomenal respiratory organism such as Life is derived
mythologically from the love between Geb and Hyen-Nu.
The difficulty involved in that laborious and numinous task
meant to demonstrate Hyen-Nu's nonpareil love to earthly
life is illustrated by the description of rain as the sweat from
the pores of Hyen-Nu and Earth/Geb. N[y]un is the primor-
dial water which nourishes the rivers and oceans earthy life
depends on. It is also the interaction between Hyen-Nu (in
the form of Sun rays/Ani) and Geb that the crude air (vapor?)
which earthly life breath is generated and purified by the veg-
etation/remedy of Ausar's resurrection.

10. In discussing the indigenous Pharaonic model of leadership
and linking it to the presentation of Maat at the advent of a
King/Queen legitimate ascension to the Pharaonic throne,
I gave priority to the authentic gerontocratic monarchy as
opposed to hereditary monarchy, which was undoubtedly
introduced in Azania by colonial agents.
11. On Karl Marx's defends of British colonial policies in India,
see John Gray (2007).
12. Having researched extensively in Ngola (Angola) during the
war years, I have firsthand knowledge of the exact role inter-
nationalists forces played in the liberation struggle in colonial
Africa. This notwithstanding, that the economic and political
objectives of Scientific Socialism are in most cases contrary
to the indigenous Azanians culture quest for real freedom has
been simply overlooked by most African leaders and PAMs
intellectuals (see Guevara, 2009/2011, pp. 156-158 further
details).
13. The Doctrina Azanica (Guevara, 2009/2011) not only links
the culture center of Sumer (Uruk), which at the onset was
presided by Anu and his daughter Auset (Ishtar/Isis), to the
Azanian culture center in Karnak, but also explores the politi-
cal intrigue surrounding the demise of that culture center's
security--the conservationist Enkidu (discussed in the Epics
of Gilgamesh) in light of similar political marriages in the
courts of Amenophis III and IV, which doubtlessly facilitated
the infiltration and destruction of the culture institutions of the
Bantu-Ethiopians Pharaonic system.
14. Nhana in Moar/Molé, the language of the Moabas (simply
means am I good?) (also see Guevara, 2009/2011).
15. In Guevara (2009/2011, pp. 241-244), I noted that there is
no credible academic justification to discriminate between
Hyen-Nu, Amon, Aton, and/or A-Nu (Anu), as all refers to
the same Sun-God in Moar/Molé. Amon (A = you [are])+Mon
(red) is merely referring to the reddish radiance of the rising or
descending Sun; whileAton (A+ton [hot]) is made in reference
to the glowing radiance of the same Sun-God.
16. Luok, in essence, simply means an existential state of either
dwelling in a deep pit or a cave, and Nu-rua, the singular of
(Niib), means the creature of Hyen-Nu. The general idea of
inhabiting a cave made in reference to this Bantu-Ethiopian
group makes sense given the celestial orientation of the
Azanian culture. In addition, a parallel could be drawn between
that existential state and that of Bes-Ptah as the first anthropo-
morphized deity of the Azanian culture, who (together with his
seven assistants) created the first earthly order in pursuit of the
original/perfect world order attributed to Hyen-Nu.
17. For the cannibalistic tendencies associated with the politi-
cal cultures of the Nordic gods, see Guevara (2009/2011,
pp. 113-114); on early Greek and Roman attestation of the
rejection of Azanian culture of such sanguinary practices see
Guevara (2009/2011, pp. 196-198).
18. A thorough study would also prove that committed elderly of
the Bantu-Ethiopian subculture groups (e.g., the Ashantis, the
Bamuns [Ba-Amun], Bawulés, Ba-Congos, Zulus, etc.) are
until today morally constrained from eating the flesh of any
one of the symbolic animalistic deities of the Azanian culture.
19. Unlike Amélineau Abbé Emile and Diop who tend to consider
Anu/Ani as an ethnic group and the original builders of the
ancient Ethiopian (Egyptian?) city of Aiwn (On), I observed
in Azanism that there is no genuine academic justification
to discriminate between A+Nu (Anu) and Hyen-Nu. In fact,
there are different hieroglyphic symbols denoting Heru/
Horus (e.g., One Eye, Falcon, One Finger, One Hand, etc.).
Accordingly, A (You/r) + Nu (Hand) merely refers to the origi-
nal Self-created-creating-Hand.
20. The trend of human population suggests that the custodians
of the Azanian culture were indeed right in equating earthly
beings with the stellar bodies. Thus, the infinite expansion
of the stars means the human population has the natural pro-
pensity of attaining the 100 billion mark on Earth which thus
impels the culture quest for perfect being.
