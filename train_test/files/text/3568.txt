Introduction
Yoruba is the name given to represent the ethnic group and
language of those living in South-West Nigeria. The Yorubas
have a very rich culture with a strong spiritual background.
These cultural wealth and spiritual beliefs are exhibited dur-
ing their festive periods. Although there are festivals cele-
brated in all the Yoruba communities, some are peculiar to
certain Yoruba communities. These festivals are often staged
on an annual basis. One of the most popular festivals peculiar
to the Ijebu-speaking community, a subgroup of the Yoruba
ethnic group, is the Ojude Oba (the frontage of the king) fes-
tival, which is an annual event. The festival celebrates some
of the unique features of the community such as their aes-
thetic taste in clothes, music, costumes, food, and so on.
People of all cultures celebrate festivals unique to their
culture and customs. Festivals serve as a means of commu-
nity assembly and unity. They are also a way of placing the
people at the heart of their culture and social environment.
Owusu-Frempong (2005) in one of his articles noted that
African festivals are "medium of cultural education and
intergenerational communication and play an important role
in the preservation of our cultural heritage, transmitting
knowledge and our experiences as a people to future genera-
tions" (p. 730). The Ojude Oba serves all these functions,
and in addition, it plays a religious role in the life of the peo-
ple of the community.
The Ijebu Kingdom
The Ijebus are located in the south-central part of
Southwestern Nigeria, regarded as Yorubaland. Ijebuland is
bordered in the north by Ibadan, in the east by Ondo and
Okitipupa, and the west by Egbaland (Sote, 2003). The
southern border is close to the sea with the coastlines of Epe,
Ibeju-Lekki, and Ikorodu. Although the people have always
regarded themselves as one, modern Nigeria political divi-
sion has placed three Ijebu-speaking local government coun-
cil areas (Epe, Ibeju-Lekki, and Ikorodu) in Lagos State,
whereas the larger part of Ijebuland is in Ogun State
(Abimbola, 2011; Oladiti, 2009).
There are legends that link the Ijebus to biblical Jebusites
and Noah (Ijebu Kingdom, 2012). For this reason, the Ijebus
call themselves "Omoluwabi"--omoti Noah bi--"the chil-
dren of Noah," but this is a claim quite difficult to prove. The
term Omoluwabi is also said to have come from omo-olu-
iwa-bi ("the child or children born of Olu-Iwa"). The refer-
ence to Olu-Iwa can be found in the document given to the
local British official in 1937 by Ijebu Ode community lead-
ers. The document states that the king of Ile-Ife gave his
daughter Gborowo as wife to Olu-Iwa. The marriage resulted
in the birth of Ogborogan, which was the nickname (a dis-
used term for addressing the king) of Obanta (the progenitor
of Ijebu Kingdom; Oduwbi, 2006).1 A British officer in
1906 quoted local sources who mentioned that the word
Ijebu was coined from the name of two of three brothers
Ajebu and Olode (the third was Osi who became the first

Ijebu Ode's Ojude Oba Festival: Cultural
and Spiritual Significance
AbdulGafar Olawale Fahm1
Abstract
Yoruba festivals are numerous and multifarious. For this reason, some are of the view that the Yorubas are deeply spiritual.
In addition to the generally celebrated festivals among the Yorubas, each Yoruba tribe has its own festivals. A series of these
festivals called the Ojude Oba festival is celebrated by the Ijebus who are renowned for both their enterprise and affluence.
This article examines the cultural and spiritual significance of the Ojude Oba festival. It analyzes the early beginnings of the
festival while providing insights into the epoch of the Ijebus. The festival constitutes a major commercial activity that brings
about economic integration and development of the Ijebu community. This article argues that the Ojude Oba festival should
not be seen simply for its entertainment value, but as a manifestation of Yoruba cultural, socio-economic, and spiritual values.

king of Ijebu, but he later abdicated for Obanta--eldest son
of the king of Ife--on his arrival). The three brothers were
reported to have come from Ile-Ife (National Archives,
1906).
Another legendary story of the Ijebu claims that they
migrated to their present place from a province in Sudan
called "Owodaiye," corrupted to "Wadai." This opinion is
supported by the present king Oba Sikiru Adetona and pre-
ferred by the traditional historians (Hashimi, 2005-2006).
Some evidences given in support of the claim that the Ijebus
migrated to Nigeria from Sudan are as follows: the Sudanese
tribal marks that are similar to the Ijebus three tribal vertical
marks to show a true indigene of the region; the closeness of
the original Arabic dialect spoken in the border of South
Sudan and Ethiopia to the Ijebu dialect; names such as Esiwu,
Saba, and Meleki (Menelik) found among the Ijebus and the
Southern Sudanese people; and the musical flute that was
used in the previous coronation of theAwujales, which is still
in vogue among the Ethiopian and Southern Sudanese peo-
ple (see Figures 1 and 2; Ijebu Kingdom, 2012).2
In the 18th and 19th centuries, Yorubaland witnessed sev-
eral political power struggles in the form of the Owu war
(1821), the Gbedeke war (1831), the Apomu war (1879), the
Kiriji war (1879), and the Ekiti Parapo war (1894). One of
the reasons for these wars was that most towns wanted to get
slaves to sell to the British. The war also caused people from
different cultural backgrounds to leave their homes and settle
in new places. What is interesting is that the Ijebu kingdom
was the only kingdom that survived the political chaos and
anarchy that devastated most towns and villages in the region
(Hashimi, 2005-2006).
The Ijebus are known for their business acumen and
apprenticeship that can be connected to their long-time rela-
tion with the European world since the early 19th century
(see also Abayomi & Dedeke, 2006; Mabogunje & Kates,
2004). By 1900, Ijebu Ode had become the capital of
Ijebuland with a population of about 20,000, 10% of the
entire Ijebuland population (Ayandele, 1992). Ijebu Ode is
located on latitude 60 49 N and longitude 30 55 E, more or
less in the center of the most densely settled districts of the
Ijebu province, which occupy south-central Western Nigeria.
It is the headquarters of the Ijebu and is surrounded by a ring
of smaller towns having between 2,000 and 5,000 residents
each (Abdul, 1967).
The Ijebus have their own dialect, and cultural and insti-
tutional identity. The Agemo3 and Osugbo4 play important
political and judicial roles. The most prominent institution is
the Awujaleship. The Awujale is the office of the king of
Ijebuland. The Awujale's role is to provide spiritual lordship
in its relationship with various districts. The main city or the
capital of Ijebuland is Ijebu Ode. The people of Ijebu Ode
sometimes regard themselves as the "super Ijebus" and see
other areas as rural inhabitants. It is in Ijebu Ode that the
Ojude Oba (the frontage of the king) festival is held.
Islam in Ijebuland
Islam came to Ijebuland around 1879 during the reign of
Awujale Afidipote (d. 1885), through an Ilorin slave servant
of Tubogun, a merchant from the Porogun ward of Ijebu
Ode. The slave servant's name was 'Ali. Tubogun gave 'Ali
the freedom to worship in any manner his religion dictated to
him. He later took his master's name and became 'Ali
Tubogun (Botu, 1937). According to another account, Islam
entered Ijebuland through Epe. This was as a result of Epe's
contact with Islam during the 1851 exile of Oba Kosoko and

his staunch supporter, Salu, who was then Imam of the Lagos
Muslims. While in Epe, Salu and his followers continued the
proselytization of their faith, which later reached the Ijebu
Epe areas, a hitherto secluded coastal town with link to
Ijebuland (Abdul, 1967).5
In another historical account, a trader from Gbogunja in
Isale Iwade, with the name 'Ali Akayinode came in contact
with some Ilorin Muslims during his many travels outside
Ijebu Ode. He learnt from them about the religion and kept
it private to himself, but on hearing about 'Ali Tubogun and
his strange religion, he decided to befriend him to learn
more. The friendship also emboldened Akayinode to discuss
the message of his new faith among his friends in his com-
munity. The coming together of the freeborn and slave ser-
vant changed the people's perception of the religion; soon
friends of 'Ali Akayinode joined him and the congregational
prayers were held in his house. Later, a suggestion came
from one of the new members that the Muslim call to prayer
(Azn) be made. The call drew the attention of the king's
traditional priests (Odis).6 The Odis protested and most pro-
test from the Odis often led to grave consequences.
Akayinode had to leave the town as soon as he received the
message that the Odis were coming for him. He returned to
Ijebuland 6 years later after receiving the news that the
reigning Awujale had a free disposition to the religion
(Abdul, 1967). As time went by, the number of the Muslims
in the community increased with some of the closest allies
of the reigning king, Awujale Atunwase (1886-1895), con-
verting to the religion. While Akayinode was away, Sanni
Oboromboro filled the vacuum, and also bought an Ilorin
slave with the name Ilyas to teach the faith to the new
Muslims. On Akayinode's return, Oboromboro abdicated
the seat of Imam for Akayinode. Oboromboro's reason for
taking such action was that Akayinode was more knowl-
edgeable and older than him.
Later on, the need arose for an Eid prayer ground and a
request was made to the Awujale. He granted the request and
directed that a piece of land around the eastern outskirt of the
town be given to the Muslims. The first Eid was said to have
been celebrated with great pomp and pageantry, as members
of Imam Akayinode's age group rode on horses to and fro the
Eid prayer ground (Botu, 1937). As the number of Muslims
increased, a request was again sent to Awujale Atunwase for
a central piece of land that would be dedicated for the Friday
congregational prayer. The king granted the request, and the
Etital central mosque currently stands on the land. Few days
later, representatives from the Muslim community were sent
to the Awujale to express the Muslims' gratitude for the
king's support and kindness. It was at this occasion that one
of the eminent personalities of the community (Chief Kuku
Oduyingbo and later Balogun Kuku), impressed by the
Muslim gestures, donated five shillings toward the building
of the proposed masjid. He also decided to join the religion.
Balogun Kuku embracing the faith marked an important
turning point in the history of Islam in Ijebuland, as multi-
tude followed suit (Abdul, 1967).7
Historical Background of Ojude Oba
Ojude Oba which means, "the king's fore-court or frontage,"
could also be translated as "majestic outing." The Ojude Oba
festival in Ijebu Ode is known to the Ijebus as a major festi-
val that brings them together. The native age groups (reg-
beregbe), indigenes, their friends, and associates from far
and near throng the palace of the Awujale of Ijebuland for the
carnival-like celebration. The festival is celebrated on the
third day after Id-El-Kabir. Ojude Oba is one of the most
glamorous cultural and spiritual festivals in Ijebuland and in
Ogun State in general. This is a celebration that has tradi-
tional, cultural, religious, social, and military significance. It
has been celebrated for more than 100 years.
According to oral historical accounts, the festival began
when Balogun Kuku, one of the leading personalities in the
community, accepted Islam. He decided to gather his friends,
families, and well-wishers to pay homage to the king for giv-
ing them the opportunity to practice their religion peacefully
(Balogun Kuku, n.d.). In another account, the festival was said
to have started when Imam Tunwatoba led his friends and
family members to pay homage to his friend, who was also the
Awujale of Ijebuland, Oba Fidipote during the eid-l-adha fes-
tival. Imam Tunwatoba thanked the king for being instrumen-
tal to the freedom enjoyed by the Muslims in the community
to practice their faith in a peaceful atmosphere (Babatunde,
2007). They prayed for the monarch to enjoy a long life, good
health, and for the progress and prosperity of Ijebuland. Since
then, what began as a visit has grown in leaps and bounds to
assume the status of a flagship cultural festival.
The Festival
The glitz and colors associated with the festival rank among
the most celebrated cultural festivals in Nigeria. Ijebu sons
and daughters, Muslim and non-Muslim, always look for-
ward to this event. It is an agelong tradition. The ceremony
takes place every year on the third day of eid-l-adha, when
Muslims and non-Muslims go to the Awujale palace, singing
and dancing with the principal chiefs of the town and riding
on horses to pay homage to the Awujale, no matter his reli-
gious affiliation. What is important is that he sits on the
throne throughout the length of the ceremony to receive his
people (Danmole, 2008). Different age groups in specially
tailored dresses dance around the town (Oladipupo, 1967).
Although the festival began as purely a Muslim affair, it has
over the years acquired new meaning as it now embraces fea-
tures of local traditions (Danmole, 2008).
The Ojude Oba festival normally begins with prayers by
the Imam of Ijebuland, followed by the National Anthem,
Ogun state Anthem, and the Awujale Anthem, and finally the
lineage praise of the Ijebus. The Awujale anthem goes thus:
Kaabiyesi o (2ce)
Alaiye Oba wa,

k'adepel'ori.
K'odigbapel'orun,
Ki Oba petiti,
Ki ijobatuwalara,
kaabiyesi o.
Oba waoninu re.
Kaabiyesi o (2ce).8
After the anthems and lineage praise, the parade of differ-
ent ages in the community known as Regberegbe begins. The
age grade societies were established in the 18th century.
Wompari is the general name given to all the age grade soci-
eties. Some of the age grades are Egbe Gbobaniyi male and
female (1962-1964), Egbe Bobagunte male and female
(1956-1958), Akile of Ijebu (1959-1961), Mafowoku, Egbe
Arobayo male and female, Egbe Jagunmolu (1965-1967),
Egbe Bobakeye, and Egbe Bobagbimo. All the age grades
present their special gift to the king as they parade (see
Figures 3 and 4).
The Wompari is a unique and agelong institution, designed
to wield the society into age groups, male and female, and for
bringing development and progress to the community. Most
of these groups comprise heads of industries, top managers,
and chief executive officers. They dance before the king one
after the other. Each group is expected to clad in the latest
fashion. They file past in turn with their drummers to pay
homage to the king.
During the 1-day event are the glowing tributes of a festi-
val that is responsive to social trends, while retaining the tra-
dition of having different age groups to entertain and renew
their allegiance to the traditional ruler. It is usually a dance,
but more importantly, a dance with meaning. Each age group
displays at the expansive lawn that separates the king and his
guests from the crowd. That makes the festival an inspiring
experience.
The Ojude Oba festival has always had enough visual
pleasantries for every visitor. Some of the attractions are the
beauty of a group of people in the same age group coming
together in service of their motherland. Many of the groups'
names are related to the king such as Obafuwaji, Bobakeye,
Gbobayo, Gbobaniyi, and Gbobalaye (see Figure 5).
Each of these groups has its uniqueness, either in the man-
ner of appearance, style of dressing, or dance pattern. The
Gbobaniyi comprises young middle-age men, and has
Governor Gbenga Daniel as its patron (2004-). They make

their appearance known by dressing in rich traditional Aso-
Oke clothes. They all hold walking sticks and dance like con-
querors. The Bobagbimo, true to the group's name, always
appear in learned and cerebral attire. The group has little of
dance and pleasantries but more of grins, nods, and prayers.
Gaiety and dance are the hallmarks of the all-female
Gbobaleye, which has the Waka Music Superstar, Queen
Salawa Abeni, as one of its prominent members. The parade
of the Baloguns and Eleshins is usually the most colorful and
breathtaking event of the festival.
A Balogun or an Eleshin is a direct descendant of the war
heroes who gained notable victories for the Ijebu during the
inter-ethnic Yoruba wars in the pre-colonial history of
Nigeria. It is commonly believed that it was at Ojude Oba
that the families of the war heroes led by the reigning
Balogun and deputies exhibited their equestrian prowess by
simulating mock battle shows and displays (see Figures 6
and 7).
It is always a performance to behold when each Balogun
and Eleshin family takes its turn to pay homage to the king
amid martial music, jubilation, and hilarity of an estimated
crowd of over one million both at the palace square and
through the town including participants, visitors, and tour-
ists. This was what made Oba Sikiru Kayode Adetona to
describe the Ojude Oba day as the Ijebus' national day.
"Ojude Oba is now maturing into a world class event. It has
all the ingredients of uniqueness and greatness" (Okoli,
2005).9
Artistic Beauty of the Ojude Oba
Festival
Art plays a significant role in the Ojude Oba festival. It is one
of the reasons people from completely different cultural set-
tings find the festival very interesting. While looking at the
artistic beauty of Ojude Oba, we would take into consider-
ation the manner of dressing of the different age groups,
music and musical instruments, the design on the horses of
the Balogun families, the pattern of the banners and fans
used in the ceremony, and so on.
Dressing
In many Yoruba societies, dresses or the traditional robes
play important roles in ceremonies. It is one of the ways to
display one's economic status within the society. In Ojude
Oba, the age grades try to beat one another through the kind
of dress they wear. Therefore, it is not surprising when we
see different age grades dressed in the most expensive kinds
of cloth known to the people of the community.
In the age grade that comprises men and women, all are
supposed to dress in the same pattern of cloth. The sheer
impact of bulk and color and stripes created by an assem-
blage of individuals in close proximity, each person robed in
identical pattern and hue, is indeed considerable. The attire
worn in the previous festival would not be repeated in the
next festival. This is to show their economic status and
wealth and make a statement that they are doing fine in their
age grade. Most often, it is an entirely different dress that
would be worn in the next Ojude Oba. The difference would
not only be in color but also in style.
Traditionally, the favorite colors of the Yoruba are tan, the
rich natural tone of the silk known as sanyan, and blue, rang-
ing from the palest to the deepest blue black obtainable from
the indigo dye pots. Reds and an occasional yellow are also
traditional preferences. More recently, however, innovations
in pattern and hue have come to be prized, so that there is a
more varied palette and an increased reliance on commer-
cially manufactured yarns rather than dependence on hand-
spun and locally dyed weaves. This is why today, some age
grades would wear agbada (big overall cloth for men), laced
with green damask.
In one of the previous Ojude Oba festivals, all the age
grades wore the same pattern of cloth; the only difference
Figure 6. The Eleshin age grade entering the parade ground.
Figure 7. One of the heads of the Balogun family on his way to

6 SAGE Open
was the color of caps for men and the headgear of the ladies.
The reason for this was that that year's festival was used to
campaign for the creation of an Ijebu state for the Ijebu peo-
ple. On the cloth worn by the age grades, the Ijebu state was
written all over it (see Figures 8-10).
Music and Musical Instruments
Music is an important part of the Ojude Oba festival and
among the Yorubas, traditional music can to a certain degree
be described as music drama. The dramatic aspect of this
music is given its highest expression in situations of a cere-
monial nature in which music, dance, speech, physical move-
ment, costume, and art objects all combine to constitute a
complete performance (Euba, 1970). In Ojude Oba, all these
are combined to the fullest and are part of what makes the
festival memorable. Popular musicians within the country as
well as those who are from Ijebuland, such as Salawa Abeni
and Wasiu Ayinde Marshal among others, are also invited to
the festival (see Figures 11 and 12).
Musical instruments used during the festival are another
aesthetic part of the celebration. There are various types of
drums such as Agere, Aran/Ipese, Igbin, Bata, Dundun. Also,
there is the sèkèrè (a netted bottle gourd that rattles), which is
Figure 8. People of the same age grade often chose same
pattern of cloth.

often used in a wide range of traditional Yoruba praise songs
and social dance styles (Waterman, 1990).Anewly introduced
instrument however is the trumpet (see Figures 13 and 14).
Banners/Emblems
Another interesting aspect of the festival is the various ban-
ners and emblems that signify those who are present to honor
the king depending on what is written on the banner. The
banners/emblems come in various colors and sizes. The pop-
ular colors are black and brown, but there are also pink, pur-
ple, red, and yellow. The Balogun Kuku family uses brown,
whereas theAlausa uses black. Some of the banners/emblems
are decorated with wool whereas others are decorated with
feathers. Most of the banners have the name of the family
written on them, with images of horses and the crown in
some of them (see Figures 15-17).
The Horses
The excessive decoration of the stallion horses is another
interesting thing about the festival. Everything about the
horse is decorated, from the head to its hoof. After all the
decorations on the horses are done, one finds it difficult to

call them horses, but rather moving artwork. Almost all col-
ors can be found in the decoration of the horses. They also
use cloths that have beads on them to create a glittering
effect. This is why for most people, the parade of the
Baloguns (warlord) is the most interesting part of the festival
(see Figures 18 and 19).
The Mock War
Looking at the life of the Yorubas, one will quickly notice
how entertainment is injected into almost every facet of their
life. From the naming ceremony to burial ceremony, from
conferment of chieftaincy title to festivals, just name it and
one will find entertainment and drama. The mock war is a
significant part of the festival. All the Baloguns/Eleshins
take part in this show. In fact, movie actors sometimes not
from Ijebuland are invited to take part. The sound of Dane
guns and various kinds of hunters' guns are heard by all the
spectators. Furthermore, to show their skills in riding horses,
the horses are made to dance and perform various kinds of
tricks like standing on their hind legs and so on. In the mock
war, there are no winners or losers; the focus is on participa-
tion (see Figures 20 and 21).
Cultural Significance of the Festival
Culture has been defined in different ways by different schol-
ars. Ilesanmi (2004) quoted Menamparampil (1996, p. 9) to
have defined culture as

. . . the total manner in which a human society responds to an
environment. It includes customs characterizing a social group;
social heredity of a particular community; meaning, values,
norms, their actions and relationships; beliefs, laws, traditions
and institutions; religions, ritual, language, song dance, feast,
living habits, crafts, equipment. (p. 7)
Going by the above definition, culture entails all facets of
human endeavor. It is a long-term process that is transferred
from one generation to another. Culture varies from one soci-
ety to another. It is life in all its totality, it is not static; it
changes from time to time. AYoruba festival like Ojude Oba
has a socio-cultural importance. The festival has been used
as a means of projecting the image of the Yoruba in general
and the Ijebus in particular.
The Ojude Oba gives the Ijebus an opportunity to renew
their allegiance to their king every year they return home
from different places within and outside Nigeria. During the
festival, they express their support for the king and wish him
a peaceful tenure.
Another cultural significance is that the festival serves
as an avenue for people to serve their motherland. The
king in one of his speeches after the festival acknowl-
edged the contributions of the age grades to his domain
when he said,
We are pleased to observe the positive contributions that our
unique regberegbe institution continues to make to the
development of Ijebuland. We are pleased to see a healthy
rivalry among them in their efforts to do something tangible for
our society so as to immortalise their names in the annals of
Ijebu history. (Ijebu Kingdom, 2012)
The festival also promotes cultural contact. The festival is
usually graced by people from all works of life. Other ethnic
groups in Nigeria also participate in the festival whereas
people from neighboring countries are not left out. This has
promoted peace, tranquility, and harmony, which contribute
to socio-economic development and integration.
The festival also signifies Yoruba flair for traditional
attire. A typical Yoruba man wears gbariye, agbada, and
dansiki for social activities whereas the women tie their iro,
buba, iborun, and ipele. These clothes show the beauty of the
Yoruba culture. More so, music, dance, and drums are an
integral part of the Yoruba culture. There is no occasion in
Yorubaland that is not accompanied by music; each festival
has its peculiar music, be it religious or social. Music brings
life and meaning to cultures and traditions (Jekayinfa, 2002).
Music, dress, chieftaincy titles, and respect for the monarch
are carried over from the African culture, which the Ojude
Oba festival depicts.
Spiritual Significance of the Festival
Islam is a religion brought to Yorubaland through the efforts of
Hausa-Fulani jihadist (Gbadamosi, 1978). Since the advent of
the new faith, it has had a great impact on the norms, customs,
and traditions of our society. Part of Islam influence on
Africa is that, there emerged a number of festivals which
have gained prominence over the traditional ones.
Mujahid (2001) also opined,
In the history of Islam, as Islam began to spread far and wide
into various foreign lands, strange and new ideas began to
appear amongst the new Muslims. These ideas were foreign to
the Muslims of Arabia who had received their Islamic education
through the pure teachings of the prophet's companions. Many
of those who had accepted would often maintain certain beliefs
and superstitions that were present in their societies and culture
before their conversions to Islam. (p. 4)
A festival like Ojude Oba is an aspect of African culture
imported to Islam. Primarily, the spiritual significance is
derived from the origin and aim of the festival. It was started
by Muslims during their eid-l-adha, which is considered one
of the important events for Muslims.
Furthermore, the festival is seen as a continuation of the
eid-l-adha celebration by the Muslims in the community, as
it is held on the third day of Eid. The festival is not only cel-
ebrated by Muslims; Christians as well as people from other
faiths join the Muslims in this celebration. The Ojude Oba
festival encourages peaceful co-existence of people of differ-
ent faiths. More so, the festival always begins with an open-
ing prayer by the Imam of Ijebuland. As such, the festival
serves as an avenue to pray for the king, his members of cabi-
net, the people, and community as a whole.
Conclusion
In this article, we have attempted to expound, albeit briefly,
the guiding beliefs of the Ijebu people with regard to the cel-
ebration of the Ojude Oba festival. The festival, it should be
noted, finds its basis in the people's belief in honoring the
paramount ruler of Ijebuland. It is also a time for the people
to display their aesthetic taste in fashion. The artistic and cre-
ative talents of the people in terms of dressing, drama, music,
and oral communication are also put into great use.
However, beneath the hustle and bustle, and sparked dis-
play of colors of this traditional festival, one can discern its
attendant religiocultural significance. Through this festival,
the people are not just entertained but the religious and cul-
tural values find an outlet too. In addition, it is also the time
most Ijebu people come home to celebrate and reconnect to
their roots, reflecting the religious, social, and cultural
responsiveness on the part of the people.

Notes
1. Oduwbi went further to state that the Ijebu community lead-
ers might have inclined toward the idea of omoluwabi to coun-
ter Rev. Samuel Johnson's The History of the Yorùbás (written
in 1897 and published 24 years later). Johnson records two
traditions of servile origins for the Ijebus. One account was
that the Ijebus ancestors were "victims offered in sacrifice by
the King of Benin to the god of the ocean, hence the term Ìjèbú
from Ije-ibu, i.e., the food of the deep" (Johnson, 1921, p. 18).
The second account states that Obanta was actually a victim
of sacrifice made by the Olowu of Owu. Obanta was expected
to have died after the sacrifice, but survived, and later went on
to establish the Ijebu kingdom. Thus, Oduwbi observes that
"to counter the notion of servile origins, a rebuttal seemed to
have been contrived that conceived the Ìjèbú as omólùwàbí,
the traditional Yorùbá term for the freeborn, as distinct from
eru, the slave. For a morphological breakdown of the term,
mlùwàbí (m -olú-iwa-bí) could literally be translated
as `the child/children born of Olú-Iwa.' The name Olú-Iwa
would therefore appear to have been adopted from omólùwàbí
to discount any suggestion of the Ìjèbú as an inferior Yorùbá
subgroup. It is within this context that claims of a consanguin-
eous relationship between Olú-Iwa and banta . . . are also
presumably to be understood. Equally worthy of mention is
the claim in the 1937 document that Oduduwa prognosticated
that banta's `kingdom shall . . . become great, and neither he
nor his people shall be slaves to any man.'This was fulfilled, it
is further stated, for `the Ìjèbús were never made slaves . . .' It
may therefore be suggested that `Olú-Iwa' is a fictitious char-
acter invented as a response to Johnson's The History of the
Yorubas; and hence the absence of the name in local historical
traditions as first reported in 1906" (Oduwbi, 2006, p. 151).
2. However, there is a strong evidence of the existence of the city
in the 16th century. Duarte Pacheco Pereira (1460-1533), a
Portuguese captain, explorer, soldier, and cartographer wrote,
"twelve or thirteen leagues up this river [i.e. the Lagos lagoon]
is a very large city called Geebuu, surrounded by a great moat.
The ruler of this country in our time is called Agusale [i.e.
Awujale], and the trade is mainly in slaves . . . but there is some
ivory" (Pereira, 1937, p. 123).
3. The Agemo cult is one of the traditional institutions that unite
all Ijebu lands. This is why one of the appellations of the Ijebus
is Ijebu Omo Alagemo merindinlogun meaning "Ijebu child of
the sixteen Agemos." There are three very important priests
of Agemo and the most notable can be said to be the Oliwo
Agbadagbodo. The Agemo represents continuity and survival
and is in charge of protecting the community from external
aggression.
4. This is the society of community elders. They are venerated
because of the belief in their closeness to the ancestors. They
have immense knowledge and wield significant power within
the community.
5. AlthoughAbdul (1967) believes this is highly unlikely because
"the Muslim leaders in Epe who were certainly strangers had
neither the cause nor the courage to extend their activity to
Ijebu Ode; so, the possibility of introducing Islam to Ijebu Ode
from Epe seems very remote. Because of this exclusiveness of
Ijebu Ode to strangers it appears that the only one who could
carry on any activity in Ijebu Ode should be one who had
gained entry, unqualified one, to the town and had also been
resident there" (p. 22).
6. The Odis likened the sound to the one made by the Oro (a spirit
god worshipped among the Yorubas and who resides in the
bush). The shrill sound or voice of the Oro is said to emanate
from "bull roarer" who is the representative of the god.
7. Balogun Kuku was said to declare that he was a Muslim on the
day he opened his new house, which has a mosque attached
to it, in 1902. He called the building "Olorunsogo" ("God
is Wonderful"). Guests were invited from Lagos, Abeokuta,
Ilorin, Ibadan, and Epe, and among them was also a sheriff
from Cairo. His declaration before a mammoth crowd also
led about 300 persons to declare for Islam on the same day.
They were not just ordinary Ijebu citizens but also impor-
tant dignitaries of the community such as 'Abbs Odunsi,
'Abbs Odejayi (the Otun Balogun), Giwa Kuye of Gbogunja,
Sumonu Apapalolaiye of Imose, 'Al Luyadi, Ajayi Logun,
'Al Omoba, Bello Odedina, and the entire members of Egbe
Mafowoku (those born between 1845 and 1848) and their
immediate junior age group (Egbe Bobajolu, born between
1849 and 1852; Botu, 1937).
8. Your Excellency our king, may you live long on the throne,
may your reign be peaceful, our merciful king. Your excel-
lency, O king (2ce) (Soyingbe, 2008).
9. The festival for that year was themed "Reaching New Heights
in Cultural and Social Progress" by the organizers.
