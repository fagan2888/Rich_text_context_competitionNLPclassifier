Introduction
Police officers encounter multiple potentially traumatic inci-
dents and extremely stressful situations (e.g., violent crimi-
nals, loss of a partner while on duty) as part of their work.
Special Forces Police (a.k.a. SWAT [special weapons and
tactics]) are tasked with responding to the most critical situ-
ations, including incidents that require specialized skills and
equipment beyond typical policing activities (Scanff &
Taugis, 2002). For example, as reviewed by Ollhoff (2012),
SWAT teams are activated in hostage and terrorist situations,
active shooter incidents (e.g., school shootings), and to cap-
ture dangerous criminals involved in drug and gang activities
among many other high risk duties. SWAT officers are
involved in long missions that often turn into high pressure
critical incidents that require life and death decisions to be
made extremely quickly. Some research indicates that due to
selection criteria, police officers, and particularly, SWAT
officers may be generally more resilient than the average
civilian (Galatzer-Levy, Madan, Neylan, Henn-Haase, &
Marmar, 2011). However, continuous exposure to chronic
and severe stress and potential traumatic events, associated
with the unpredictability of the job, is associated with sig-
nificant physiological reactivity (Gilmartin, 2002). Enhanced
and prolonged physiological stress reactivity can, over time,
negatively affect the mental and physical health of officers
(Andersen et al., 2010; Violanti et al., 2006). Police officers
are at elevated risk of mental health conditions such as
depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), burnout,
and substance abuse (Asmundson & Stapleton, 2008;Austin-
Ketch et al., 2012) and elevated risk of physical health
conditions such as heart disease, gastrointestinal disorders,
and diabetes and even early mortality (Violanti et al., 2005;
Violanti, Vena, & Petralia, 1998).

Abstract
Police Special Forces (a.k.a. special weapons and tactics [SWAT]) officers are tasked with responding to the most critical
situations, including incidents that require specialized skills and equipment beyond typical policing activities. In this study, we
tested the feasibility of applying Arnetz and colleagues' resilience promotion training that was developed for patrol officers
to SWAT team officers (n = 18). The resilience promotion training program included psychoeducation focused on police
stress and resilience, and the practice of resilience promotion techniques (controlled breathing and imagery) while listening
to audio-recorded critical incident scenarios. The aims of this study were to (a) examine if a resilience training program
was relevant and accepted by SWAT team officers and (b) assess participants' physiological stress responses (heart rate,
respiration) during the resilience training sessions to note if there were improvements in stress responding over time.
Our findings revealed that participants were able to significantly reduce their average heart rate and improve their ability
to engage in controlled respiration (i.e., breathing) during simulated critical incidents over the course of the 5-day training.
Improvements in stress responding were observed even when the critical incident scenarios became more graphic. Results
suggest that an intervention to reduce stress responses of SWAT officers to critical incident scenarios works in a simulated
training setting. Translation of these findings to real-world occupational hazards is a recommended next step.

Physical and mental health symptoms can affect occu-
pational performance. Covey and colleagues (2013) found
that police officers with symptoms of anxiety were more
likely to shoot inappropriately in simulated critical incidents.
Furthermore, organizational policies that the officer cannot
control, shift work, and family stressors add to the burden of
multiple and cumulative operational stressors (Papazoglou,
2013). Ultimately, the cumulative stress, health conditions,
and burnout increase the risk of absenteeism, job dissatisfac-
tion, and poor job performance (Conrad & Kellar-Guenther,
2006; Norvell, Belles, & Hills, 1998; Wright & Saylor,
1991). Given the marked risks of cumulative stress on the
health and quality of life for the officer, and concern for pub-
lic safety, researchers have begun to develop resilience-
building intervention programs to address stress-related
problems for patrol officers (Arnetz,Arble, Backman, Lynch,
& Lublin, 2013; Arnetz, Nevedal, Lumley, Backman, &
Lublin, 2009; Backman, Arnetz, Levin, & Lublin, 1997).
However, resilience interventions have not been applied to
SWAT officers. In this article, we review two existing resil-
ience intervention programs designed for patrol officers
(Arnetz et al., 2013; Arnetz et al., 2009; Backman et al.,
1997; McCraty, Atkinson, Lipsenthal, & Arguelles, 2009,
2012) and detail the manner in which we combined these
programs and tested the feasibility of this combined program
to address stress responses among SWAT officers.
Existing Resilience Interventions for Patrol
Officers
Empirical evidence is clear that chronic and uncontrollable
stressors confer the largest toll on physical and mental health
(McEwen, 1998; Sapolsky, 2004). Therefore, prior interven-
tions targeting police stress were based on the premise that
providing officers with techniques to reduce the stressfulness
of critical incidents and enhance the perception of predict-
ability and control would improve health and performance
outcomes (Arnetz et al., 2013; Arnetz et al., 2009; Backman
et al., 1997). To test this theory, Backman and colleagues
(1997) and Arnetz and colleagues (2013; Arnetz et al., 2009)
designed and conducted a 10-week randomized, controlled
intervention that contained the following components: (a)
psychoeducation regarding stress responses to critical inci-
dents, (b) the use of guided imagery to facilitate officer expo-
sure to critical incident stress while in a safe classroom
environment, (c) the application of relaxation techniques to
manage stress reactions, (d) mental rehearsal of police best
practices (i.e., tactical skills) during the imagery exposure,
and (e) learning coping strategies to address the health effects
of stress. This intervention strategy was applied to Swedish
Police officers as they completed their initial training (Arnetz
et al., 2013; Arnetz et al., 2009; Backman et al., 1997).
Significant and clinically relevant improvements were found
at follow-up, specifically, enhanced problem-based coping
skills, reductions in psychological distress, and improvements
in physical health (i.e., reduced digestive distress, fewer
sleep problems, and less exhaustion).
McCraty and colleagues (2009, 2012) designed and tested
a stress reduction intervention based on the premise that
reducing psychophysiological reactivity (i.e., cardiovascular
and respiratory parameters) during critical incident scenarios
would improve health and performance outcomes for police
and correction officers in the line of duty (McCraty et al.,
2009, 2012). Classroom sessions (approximately 16 hr total)
included five training modules covering the following top-
ics: (a) psychoeducation about stress, risks to health, and job
performance; (b) instruction on a breathing technique to
be used during stressful situations to control physiological
responses to stress (e.g., to enhance physical and emotional
control during critical incidents); and (c) instruction about
communication and coping strategies to be applied in the
workplace and at home. Prior to the training program, par-
ticipants took a number of health measures (i.e., sleep, stress
hormones, heart rate variability, c-reactive protein, choles-
terol, blood pressure, and glucose regulation) to indicate
stress responsivity, risk for cardiovascular disease, and men-
tal health symptoms (i.e., negative mood, depressive and
anxiety symptoms, vitality). Researchers found improve-
ments in all health parameters before, during, and following
critical incidents and at long-term follow-up (McCraty et al.,
2009, 2012). Mental health gains such as increased positive
emotion, vitality, reduced negative emotion and depressive
symptoms, and improved self-regulation in response to stress
weredemonstrated(McCratyetal.,2009,2012).Furthermore,
the authors reported significant health savings to police orga-
nizations in terms of a 14% reduction in annual health care
costs, which translated into a cost savings of $1,179 per
employee per year.
Given the significant positive outcomes of both the
above-mentioned resilience interventions for patrol officers,
we applied a combination of these programs to test the
feasibility of resilience programming for SWAT officers. To
maximize the benefits of both the Arnetz and colleagues
(2013; Arnetz et al., 2009; Backman et al., 1997) and
McCraty and colleagues (2009, 2012) interventions, the
psychosocial components of the Arnetz et al. (2013; Arnetz
et al., 2009) program were combined with the psychophysi-
ological techniques of the McCraty and colleagues (2009,
2012) intervention.
The Current Study
Our prior work has demonstrated that, although highly
trained, SWAT officers are not immune to the stressors of the
job and experience significant stress responses in training
exercises and real-world missions (Andersen et al., 2015).
We extend prior literature by examining both the psychologi-
cal and physiological responses to a resilience intervention
applied to SWAT officers. We hypothesized that (a) SWAT
team officers would be actively engaged in the resilience
Andersen et al. 3
promotion training intervention delivered to them as part of
their regular tactical training program and (b) officers would
be better able to control their physiological stress responses,
as measured by heart rate and controlled respiration, over the
course of the resilience training program as they learned
and practiced the program techniques (controlled breathing
and mental imagery in response to audio exposure to critical
incidents).
Method
Participants
Participants (n = 18) were male SWAT team police officers
(M age = 33.66; SD age = 4.81; range age = 13) serving in
Finland. Although we use the term SWAT for parsimony in
this article, the established name of the teams in Finland are
known as Special Response Teams (SRTs). There are both
regional SRTs and federal SRTs in Finland. The participants
in this article consisted of members of regional SRTs. The
average number of years of police service (M-regular ser-
vice) was 9.75, and the number of years specifically served
in the SWAT team (M-SWAT) was 6.67. This study was
approved by the University of Toronto as well as the Finnish
National Police Research Board. All participants accepted
our invitation to participate in the resilience intervention pro-
gram and signed the ethics approved consent form.
Procedure
The resilience training program was delivered to partici-
pants at the Police University College of Finland located in
Tampere, Finland, by licensed psychologists and an experi-
enced SWAT trainer (who was trained in the techniques by
the study authors). Participants were completing a 5-day
tactical training program that included both classroom and
simulated town critical incident scenarios (e.g., local train
station, bus and apartment searches and hostage situations).
The resilience intervention was conducted in the following
manner. On each of the 5 days, a 60-min resilience training
session was held, which included the psychoeducational and
imagery components of the Arnetz and colleagues (2013;
Arnetz et al., 2009) intervention. Specifically, each session
began with (a) a 10-min overview of the relevant topics of
stress and stress management in policing; (b) the facilitators
answered any concerns or questions raised by the partici-
pants related to previous sessions' procedures; (c) the
practice of the psychophysiological techniques outlined
in the McCraty and colleagues intervention (2009, 2012).
Specifically, the psychophysiological intervention consists
of focusing on positive emotion while engaging in con-
trolled breathing (5 s inhale and 5 s exhale) arising from the
chest (Institute of HeartMath, 2014; McCraty & Atkinson,
2012). (d) While engaging in controlled breathing, the offi-
cers listened to critical incident scenarios on iPod devices.
The scenarios were developed by Arnetz and colleagues
(2013; Arnetz et al., 2009; Backman et al., 1997) and repre-
sented police incidents that were rated, by police officers
and trainers with many years of experience, as the most
stressful incidents that police typically encounter in the line
of duty. Officers were instructed to imagine themselves
involved in the critical incident and what actions they would
take. Scenarios were translated into Finnish and recorded
by Finnish actors. Scenarios increased in severity over
the course of the 5 days, thus enhancing the potential for
increased stress responses: Day 1--car chase, Day 2--
armed robbery, Day 3--crazed man, Day 4--domestic vio-
lence, Day 5--murder scene. Each scenario had two
recordings: (a) a basic scenario that simply described a criti-
cal incident from the perspective of the officer and was
developed to arouse physiological and emotional responses
from the participants and (b) an advanced scenario that was
the same as the first but included the voice instructions of
the "best practices" from a trained police officer to aid the
participant in knowing the correct action to take during such
a critical incident. The purpose of listening and imagining
oneself in a critical incident while in a controlled, non-
stressful environment is to instill confidence and familiarity
into the police officer so that when they encounter such a
stressor in the line of duty the incident is more predictable,
controllable, and thus less threatening (Arnetz et al., 2013;
Arnetz et al., 2009). Between the basic and advanced com-
ponent of each scenario, participants received feedback
from the SWAT trainer facilitator. Following the advanced
component of the scenario, the facilitators encouraged par-
ticipants to share their thoughts and feelings related to the
session's imagery and breathing techniques. At the end of
each session, the psychologist facilitators debriefed partici-
pants. In addition, participants were given 15 extra minutes
during the evening to practice the psychophysiological
breathing technique.
Measures
Stress reactivity
Heart rate.Participants were fitted with a chest-band
monitor (i.e., Zephyr Bioharness) to collect heart rate and
respiration parameters. The chest-band is non-invasive
and fits next to the skin under clothing. This method of
measurement has formally been used with police and cor-
rectional officers (McCraty & Atkinson, 2012; McCraty
et al., 2009). Physiological signals were recorded (moment-
by-moment) on the device and were reviewed and analyzed
by the researchers at a later date. A person's heart rate rises
as a result of autonomic nervous system activation during a
stressful incident (Anderson, Litzenberger, & Plecas, 2002).
A moderate, as opposed to extreme, increase in the heart rate
during a stressful situation indicates better adaptability and
more optimal mental and physical functioning during stress
(Anderson et al., 2002; Vrijkotte, van Doornen, & de Geus,
4 SAGE Open
2000). We operationalized improvement in stress response
physiology as a participant's ability to reduce heart rate
arousal during the critical incident scenarios, indicating a
moderate versus high increase in heart rate over the course of
the 5-day intervention, even as the critical incident scenarios
became increasingly more stressful. Two measures of heart
rate stress reactivity were calculated. First, heart rate max
(HR
max
) indicates the highest heart rate reached during the
critical incident scenario, and second measure is heart rate
average (HR
average
), the average heart rate maintained during
the critical incident scenario.
Achieving autonomic nervous system control.The psycho-
physiological technique, as outlined by McCraty and Toma-
sino (2004), consists of controlled breathing (5 s inhale and
5 s exhale) and has been shown to result in the increased
synchronization of the sympathetic and the parasympathetic
nervous system. The resulting benefits include (a) reduced
stress reactivity and basal level stress hormones (i.e., cor-
tisol) and cardiovascular reactivity (Arnetz et al., 2009;
McCraty & Atkinson, 2012), and (b) control of autonomic
nervous system activity does not allow for extreme anxiety or
panic to occur, but instead the individual is able to maintain a
moderate level of arousal, which has been shown to be ideal
for logical thought and application of learned knowledge
(Jamieson, Mendes, Blackstock & Schmader, 2010). To mea-
sure the improvement in autonomic nervous system control,
participants wore a pulse oximeter device attached to their
earlobe. This device plugged into an iPod with an application
(Inner Balance for iOS 30 Pin Sensor) for viewing the data
in real time as it was collected and saved. The device mea-
sures oxygen saturation in the blood calculated from pulse
rate, heartbeat, and respiration. The Inner Balance software
uses visual and auditory biofeedback that trains users how to
maintain a certain breathing rate to synchronize sympathetic
and the parasympathetic nervous system activity (McCraty
& Tomasino, 2004). The Inner Balance app provides infor-
mation about user's ability to attain a synchronized state
(i.e., coherence score) and ability to maintain this state (i.e.,
achievement score) as measured by the amount of time spent
in a coherent state. The Inner Balance application provides
a scale of the coherence score level (0.5 basic­good begin-
ner level, 1.0 good, 2.0 very good, 3.0+ excellent; Institute
of HeartMath, 2014). Similarly, the achievement score refers
to all coherence scores calculated every 5 s during a session
(Institute of HeartMath, 2014). An achievement score of 300
points per day is associated with stress hormone, cardiovas-
cular and cognitive improvements (Institute of HeartMath,
2014; McCraty & Atkinson, 2012).
Focus Group--Group Feedback Session
After the completion of the resilience training program,
researchers, SWAT team trainers, and SWAT team officers
(participants) of the study had a focus group--feedback
session scheduled. The first and second authors of this article
were the group facilitators of the session. The aim of the
focus group was for researchers and SWAT team trainers to
listen to the feedback of the participants about the techniques
(breathing and imagery) included in the resilience training
program. Participants were encouraged by researchers to (a)
share their experiences in participating in the resilience pro-
motion program, (b) suggest possible changes about the sce-
narios presented in the daily sessions, (c) provide feedback
about the specific techniques applied over the resilience pro-
gram, and (d) share with the group any additional general
comments or recommendations they had for similar future
resilience research endeavors with SWAT teams. At the end
of the focus group session, group facilitators administered a
brief five-question survey to be completed by the partici-
pants. The brief survey was developed on a Likert-type scale
(1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree) and aimed to
receive participant's feedback on the effectiveness of the
training in helping them reduce their stress levels. Some of
the questions included in the brief survey were as follows:
"Do you believe that this training helped you reduce your
stress responses to critical incidents?" "Do you think that the
breathing technology used helped you to decrease your
stress responses?" "Would you recommend the techniques
instructed over the training to be taught to other officers?"
Results
Stress Reactivity to Critical Incident Scenarios
Cardiovascular stress reactivity. T-test analyses revealed a
reduction in average heart rate (HR
mean
) between Day 1
(HR
mean
= 84; SD = 8.28) and Day 5 (HR
mean
= 78; SD = 7.97,
t = 4.09; p < .001) during the period that the SWAT officers
were listening to critical incident scenarios (see Figure 1).
There were no significant differences in the maximum heart
rate observed between Day 1 (HR
max
= 107; SD = 21.18) and
Day 5 (HR
max
= 106; SD = 8.48; see Figure 2).
Autonomic Nervous System Control
Controlled breathing. T-test analyses revealed an improve-
ment in achievement scores from the beginning of the train-
ing (Day 1 = 1.81; SD = 0.87) until the end of the training
(Day 5 = 1.83; SD = 0.59). There were no significant differ-
ences in coherence scores observed between the first (Day 1
= 1.81; SD = 0.87) and last day (Day 5 = 1.83; SD = 0.59).
Group Feedback
During the focus group session, participants referred to the
important role of the resilience promotion training program
in helping them better manage stress. Officers also contrib-
uted constructive comments about the adaptation of the
program for training SWAT teams in the future. For instance,
Andersen et al. 5
they mentioned that the delivery time of the resilience
program was too brief and recommended a program that was
longer than five sessions. They also suggested that the sce-
narios be better tailored to the type of team maneuvers and
weapons relevant to SWAT team's specific tasks. For
instance, they noted that they respond to the critical incidents
as a group and they never respond to the incidents in dyads.
Results from the brief surveys related to the SWAT team
officers' satisfaction in participating in the training were as
follows: Most of the participants (61.11%) were very or
highly satisfied with the stress reduction techniques. In terms
of the technology used over the training sessions, most par-
ticipants (72.23%) reported that the devices used were very
helpful or highly helpful for them to facilitate their stress
reduction processes. Similarly, the majority of the partici-
pants (72.22%) agreed or strongly agreed that the technology
used over the training is capable of helping individuals
manage stress in their daily lives. In terms of knowledge
dissemination, participants reported that they were confident
(72.22%) or highly confident that they would recommend
the techniques of the resilience training program to their
peers. Similarly, most of the participants stated that it is
important (83.33%) or vitally important to provide this
resilience training to their peers.
Discussion
The aims of this study were to (a) examine if a resilience
training program was relevant and accepted by SWAT team
officers and (b) assess participants' physiological stress
responses (heart rate, controlled respiration) during the resil-
ience training sessions to note if there were improvements in
stress responding over time. In accordance with the first aim,
we found that the SWAT officers were eager to participate in
the resilience promotion training program and they all com-
pleted the program. The officers reported learning, some of
them for the first time, about stress management and resil-
ience promotion techniques over the course of the program.
The officers reported benefits of the program, including self-
reported reductions in stress physiology in reaction to the

scenarios and believed this reduction in stress may improve
their performance in the line of duty. Participants also
reported that they felt that resilience training should be pro-
vided to SWAT officers and would recommend the program
for their peers.
In accordance with the second aim of the study, our find-
ings revealed that participants were able to significantly
reduce their physiological stress responses over the course of
training. Specifically, reductions in cardiovascular arousal,
as measured by average heart rate, and improved autonomic
nervous system control, as measured by the achievement
scores on the iPod devices, were observed. Participants sig-
nificantly improved in their ability to engage in controlled
respiration (i.e., breathing; achievement scores) from the
first session (Day 1) to the last session (Day 5) of training.
The findings from the coherence and achievement scores are
in line with what we would expect trained athletes and highly
trained police officers to display. Specifically, participants'
coherence scores were high from the beginning of the train-
ing (good to very good coherence score = 1.8), not showing
a significant improvement over time. This means that SWAT
officers were already quickly able to achieve a state of auto-
nomic nervous system control. They understood the tech-
nique rapidly and were able to successfully maintain a
balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic control
while sitting stationary. This finding is not surprising, given
that athletes and police trained in marksmanship (both of
which apply to SWAT officers) are required to maintain high
levels of physical functioning and body control during
focused activities. However, what SWAT officers had not
been taught before was the ability to maintain and improve
autonomic nervous system control during highly stressful
incidents with potential life threat. A moderate, as opposed to
extreme, increase in physiological arousal during stressful
situations indicates better adaptability and more optimal
mental and physical functioning during stress (Anderson
et al., 2002; Vrijkotte et al., 2000). Maintaining moderate
arousal is critical to the ability of a SWAT officer to think
logically during life and death situations and make decisions
in line with their training (Covey et al., 2013). The SWAT
officers' achievement scores reflected their improvement in
the ability to achieve physiological control and maintain this
control even as the critical incidents became more graphic,
complex, and stress arousing.
A resilience promotion training program had never been
applied to SWAT team police officers before this current
study. However, we did not have to "re-invent the wheel"
since Arnetz and colleagues (2013; Arnetz et al., 2009)) and
Backman and colleagues (1997) successfully applied a resil-
ience promotion training program to police recruits.
Therefore, our main goal was to applyArnetz and colleagues'
(2013; Arnetz et al., 2009) and Backman and colleagues'
(1997) program to SWAT team police officers.
During the focus group session, participants provided both
researchers and trainers with constructive feedback based on
their experience with the SWAT team. More specifically, they
suggested that a resilience training program could be ought
to include more than five sessions, as five sessions were
considered a brief period of time for the participants to famil-
iarize themselves with the instructed techniques and begin
applying these techniques effectively. For instance, Arnetz
and colleagues (2013; Arnetz et al., 2009) had 10 (90-min)
scheduled sessions for their resilience training with police
recruits. In this study, we only had five scheduled (60-min)
sessions because the SWAT team's training program was
inundated with numerous other activities (e.g., tactical
training, defense tactics, shooting range), and the training
was scheduled to be completed within 5 business days.
Furthermore, participants suggested that the audio-recorded
scenarios needed to be better customized to the SWAT team
tasks. For instance, some of the scenarios referred to a police
officer and his or her partner as opposed to the team-oriented
(all platoon) mission of the SWAT. In addition, other sce-
narios (e.g., crazy man scenario) described officers patrol-
ling and their conversations with the "crazy man."
Participants in this study reported that the SWAT team's mis-
sion is to respond to a "crazy man" situation and instantly
arrest him, so that public safety would not be at risk. It is
interesting to note, however, that the largest physiological
increases (see Figure 2) were in response to the interaction
with an individual with a mental health condition. The find-
ings are in line with the self-reports from both patrol and
SWAT officers that, typically, officers face the hardest time
addressing mental health situations, for example, when to
shoot or not. Also, the consequences of shooting a person
with a mental health disorder can be severe. Based on our
current findings, we recommend that additional imagery
time be spent addressing the concerns and challenges that
officers face in managing issues related to mental health and
policing. Relevant training is becoming particularly impor-
tant in these times of increasing terrorist threat. SWAT mem-
bers have to make quick decisions to place a suspect into a
particular category.
Implications
This study reflects the first attempt to customize a stress
resilience intervention to SWAT officers. The intervention
was developed from two evidence-based resilience programs
for patrol officers. The outcomes of the study indicate that
the application of a resilience promotion training program to
SWAT officers is feasible, well received, and physiologically
beneficial. We include suggestions from SWAT officers to
increase the length and specificity of resilience program and
training sessions to cover more SWAT-specific incidents and
provide greater time for practice of the techniques.
Future Directions
Results suggest that an intervention to reduce stress responses
of SWAT officers to critical incident scenarios works in a
simulated training setting. Translation of these findings to
Andersen et al. 7
real-world occupational hazards is a recommended next step.
A randomized controlled trial, testing the efficacy of resil-
ience training among SWAT in real-world settings, is the
next step for researchers to pursue.
