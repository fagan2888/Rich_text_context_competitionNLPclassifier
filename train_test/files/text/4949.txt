Abstract
We report a novel illusion­­curvature blindness illusion: a wavy line is perceived as a zigzag line.
The following are required for this illusion to occur. First, the luminance contrast polarity of the
wavy line against the background is reversed at the turning points. Second, the curvature of the
wavy line is somewhat low; the right angle is too steep to be perceived as an illusion. This illusion
implies that, in order to perceive a gentle curve, it is necessary to satisfy more conditions­­
constant contrast polarity­­than perceiving an obtuse corner. It is notable that observers exactly
``see'' an illusory zigzag line against a physically wavy line, rather than have an impaired perception.
We propose that the underlying mechanisms for the gentle curve perception and those of obtuse
corner perception are competing with each other in an imbalanced way and the percepts of corner
might be dominant in the visual system.

Perception of contour and shape is one of basic functions of vision. To this end, visual system
processes information in a hierarchical way; first it extracts local orientations, then it
integrates the local orientations into intermediate representations of contour, and finally it
forms global shape percepts (Loffler, 2008). The intermediate representation of contour
would include concavity, convexity, corner angle, curvature, and so forth. Although it is
obvious that the physical shape is determined by combination of the local orientations,
perceptual shape is susceptible to several factors. Accordingly, as visual illusions
demonstrate, percepts are not necessarily veridical. For example, the cafe
´ wall illusion
(Pierce, 1898) demonstrates that parallel horizontal lines are perceived as different angles
to each other.
Here, we report a novel illusion­­curvature blindness illusion­­that will provide novel
implications for contour perception, in particular, for the underlying mechanisms of curve
and corner perception. Figure 1 demonstrates this illusion. One must see the pairs of wavy
lines (i.e., gentle curves) and pairs of zigzag lines (i.e., obtuse corners) on the gray
background. Physically, however, all lines are wavy lines with an identical shape; there is
no triangular wave and hence there is no corner. One would find that all the lines on the white
and black background are wavy. As the effect magnitudes are quite strong, unless one

carefully stares at the region that looks like a corner, it is hard to find that all lines are
physically wavy. Despite the simplicity and effect magnitudes, to the best of our knowledge,
no one has reported about this phenomenon.
Psychophysical, physiological, and computational studies have excessively investigated
the underlying visual process of curve and corner perception (Loffler, 2008). The basic idea
is a hierarchal process, that is, the outputs from local and neighboring orientation filters in
V1 are integrated at the later stages, V2, V3, or V4, and the curvature or angle information
are extracted as intermediate representations of contours (Dumoulin & Hess, 2007; Ito &
Komatsu, 2004; Kramer & Fahle, 1996; Levi & Klein, 2000; Snippe & Koenderink, 1994).
The end-stopped cells would also play a role in detecting relatively high curvature
(Dobbins, Zucker, & Cynader, 1987, 1989; Skottun, 1998). However, these studies have
addressed how the visual system discriminates different curvatures, detects a low curvature
from a straight line, discriminates different corner angles, or detects obtuse angles from a
straight line; thus, the perception of curve and corner have been studied in a different
context.
Accordingly, little is known regarding how the visual system discriminates a curve from a
corner and how these two percepts are related to each other (Ito, 2012, may be one
exception). As the curvature blindness illusion demonstrates that the low curvatures are
perceptually replaced by the obtuse corners, it postulates that the underlying mechanisms
of curve and corner perception could not be independent, but rather would interfere or
compete with each other. Therefore, disentangling this illusion should provide a unified
view of curve and corner perception and also extend the current understandings of
contour perception.
In the present study, we conducted three experiments to explore the determining factors
and mechanisms underlying curvature blindness. Experiment 1 investigated the effects of the
position of color change. Experiment 2 investigated the effects of background luminance.

one would see obtuse corners rather than gentle curves for some sine waves on the gray background.

Finally, Experiment 3 investigated which of the two plays a crucial role: color change or line
discontinuity.
Experiment 1
Experiment 1 investigated the effects of the strength of the curvature or angle of wavy and
zigzag lines as well as how sensitive to the difference in the position of color change. These
investigations would reveal the basic characteristics of the illusion in terms of the spatial
configuration.
Methods
Eight nai¨ve university students participated as paid volunteers after giving written informed
consent. All of the participants had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity. The study
was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Tokyo and conducted in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
The experiment was conducted in a quiet and dimmed room. The visual stimuli were
presented on a CRT monitor (the refresh rate was 75 Hz, resolution was 1024 Â 768 pixels)
at a viewing distance of 57 cm. The stimulus presentation and response acquisition were
controlled by the Apple Mac Mini and PsychoPy (Peirce, 2007, 2008).
The visual stimulus was a triangle wave (zigzag line) or a sinusoidal wave (wavy line)
presented on a grey background (18.1 cd/m2), as shown in Figure 2. The wavelength of the
line was 40 pixel (1.57) and the horizontal range of the line was 800 pixel (30.7). We presented
two curvature or angle strengths. The range on the vertical axis was 10 pixel (0.39) and 20 pixel
(0.78) for low and high curvature, respectively; hence, the corner angle was right (90) and
obtuse (126.9) for the high and low curvature or angle, respectively. The line was painted
alternately with black (0.38 cd/m2) and white (98.0 cd/m2) with an alternation frequency of p.
The offset of alternation was manipulated from 0 to 0.5p with 0.1p intervals. The offset 0.5p
(e.g., third from top row in Figure 2) indicates that the line color changes in the middle of two
turning points, while the offset 0p (e.g., top row in Figure 2) indicates that the line color
changes at the turning point. In addition, the line painted with white was also presented
(bottom row in Figure 2).
The participant began a trial by pressing a spacebar. A visual stimulus was presented for
one frame (13.3 ms) after 500 ms blank screen. The participant's task was to indicate whether
the line was zigzag or wavy by pressing the corresponding key (F or J). After six practical
trials, each condition was presented 16 times in a pseudorandom sequence, leading to 448
trials in total (2 shape Â 2 angle Â 7 offset Â 16 repetition).
Results
Figure 3 shows the results of Experiment 1. A three-way repeated measures ANOVA (with
Huynh­Feldt correction) of shape, angle, and offset revealed the significant three-way
interaction, F(6, 42) ¼ 24.9, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ 0.78. Thus, as shown in Figure 3, the effects of
offset differed among the conditions. The effect was significant for the low-curvature wavy
shape condition, F(6, 42) ¼ 45.6, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ 0.87. A paired comparison (corrected by
Ryans method) revealed that the accuracy of 0p condition was lower than the other
conditions as well as that of 0.1p condition was lower than the other (except for 0p)
conditions. On the other hand, the effects of offset were not significant in the other
conditions--high-curvature wavy shape: F(6, 42) ¼ 2.70, p ¼ .12, Z2
p
¼ 0.28; low-curvature

2 ¼ 0.32; high-curvature zigzag shape: F(6, 42) ¼ 2.11,
p ¼ .10, Zp
2 ¼ 0.23.
We also tested that the accuracy rate was biased to the illusory perception. Consistent with
our observation, the results demonstrated that the wavy line with low curvature was
misperceived as a zigzag line when the color changed at the turning point (offset ¼ 0p).
The accuracy rate was below chance (95% CI ¼ [0.09, 0.40] against the chance level 0.5),
which indicates that the participants exactly ``see'' an illusory zigzag line against a physically
wavy line, rather than have an impaired percepts of the line shape.
Experiment 2
Experiment 2 investigated the effects of the luminance contrast of the line color and the
effects of background luminance. These manipulations would reveal which color change of

illusion.
Methods
Eight nai¨ve university students different from those participating in Experiment 1 were
recruited. The methods were identical with Experiment 1, except for the following.
Figure 4 shows some examples of the visual stimuli. In Experiment 2, only the low
curvature or angle stimuli were presented. The offset of the color change was either 0.0,
0.17, 0.33, 0.50p, or no color change (white line). The background was either black (pixel
value ¼ 0, 0.38 cd/m2), grey (pixel value ¼ 128, 18.1 cd/m2), or white (pixel value ¼ 255,
98.0 cd/m2). The luminance contrast of the line color was also manipulated. The contrast
was either strong (75% of the maximum contrast, pixel value was 32 and 224, and luminance
was 0.53 and 72.45 cd/m2, respectively) or weak (25% of maximum contrast, pixel value was
96 and 160, and luminance was 8.37 and 31.7 cd/m2). Each condition was presented eight
times in a pseudorandom sequence, leading to 480 trials in total (2 shape Â 3 background Â
2 contrast Â 5 offset Â 8 repetition).
Results
Figure 5 shows the results of Experiment 2. We performed a four-way repeated measures
ANOVA of shape, background, contrast, and offset. As the four-way interaction was
significant, F(8,56) ¼ 6.90, p < .01, Z2

condition. The effects of offset were significant in the all gray background conditions and
white background conditions with the high contrast, Fs(4, 28) > 3.88, ps < .05, Zp
2 > 0.36.
The significant bias from the wavy to zigzag line was observed at the offset 0p in both strong
(95% CI ¼ [0.02, 0.39]) and weak contrast (95% CI ¼ [0.01, 0.31]) conditions with the gray
background. No other condition showed significant bias. These results showed that the
curvature blindness illusion takes place only when the background is gray. In this
condition, the luminance contrast polarity of the wavy line was reversed against the
background at the turning point. We also found that the contrast strength of black and
white on the line has little effects. The detection of a zigzag line was difficult when the
color changed around the middle of the turning point (offset ¼ 0.33p, 0.50p).
Experiment 3
Assuming the shadowing by a single light source, the change in luminance at the corner gives the
impression of the change of surface orientation. Indeed, we can see depth for the patterns with
offset 0p in Figures 2 and 4. Given the potential involvement of the depth perception, it would be
reasonable that the surface is straight rather than curved since the luminance is constant along the
segmented regions of lines. In other words, if a surface is curved, the shadowing will make a
gradual change of luminance. Therefore, it is possible to argue that the curvature blindness
illusion would arise from the inference of surface orientation from the depth percepts and
shadowing. To test this possibility, in Experiment 3, we made the pattern wherein the contrast

polarity is discontinuous but depth cue is not available (Figure 2, row 7, left). If the depth
percepts are crucial, this pattern should not induce the curvature blindness illusion.
Methods
Eight nai¨ve university students different from those in Experiments 1 and 2 were recruited.
The methods were identical with Experiment 1 except for the following. Figure 1 shows some
examples of the visual stimuli. In Experiment 3, only the low curvature or angle stimuli were
presented. We presented the black or white alternation conditions and the black segment
conditions (Figure 1, second and third from bottom). The alternation condition was identical
with Experiment 1. In the segment condition, black segments were placed on a white line
instead of alternating white and black color. Each condition was presented 16 times in a
pseudorandom sequence, leading to 480 trials in total (2 shape Â 2 color change Â 7
offset Â 16 repetition).
Results
Figure 6 shows the results of Experiment 3, which replicated Experiment 1. Furthermore, the
black segments on the white line efficiently induced the curvature blindness illusion. A three-
way repeated measures ANOVA of shape, color change, and offset revealed the significant
three-way interaction, F(6, 42) ¼ 2.74, p ¼ .02, Zp
2 ¼ 0.28. The pattern was similar across the
white or black alternation and black segments on white line, which was supported by no
significant interactions in the two-way repeated measures ANOVAs of offset Â color change;

General Discussion
The present study reported and explored a novel illusion wherein a wavy line is perceived as a
zigzag line (Figure 1). The following were the identified prerequisites for this illusion to occur.
First, the luminance contrast polarity of the wavy line needs to be reversed against the
background at the turning points (Experiment 2). Second, the polarity can be reversed
before and after the turning point or only at the turning point. In both cases, the illusion
is efficiently induced (Experiment 3). Thus, the depth percepts would not be a crucial factor
for this illusion. Third, the curve needs to be somewhat gentle; the right angle is too steep for
the illusion to occur (Experiment 1).
This illusion has two implications. First, the percepts of a gentle curve (wavy line) are
impaired by discontinuity of contrast polarity at the turning point, while the percepts of an
obtuse corner are not; this implies that the mechanisms of the gentle curve and obtuse corner
detection are separable in terms of contrast polarity. Second, the illusory percepts of an
obtuse corner (zigzag line) appears and replaces the gentle curve, which indicates the
imbalanced competition between these two percepts.
Some models propose that the end-stop cells play a role in curvature detection (Dobbins
et al., 1987, 1989; Skottun, 1998). These models, however, efficiently work with relatively high

details.

curvature. Experiment 1 revealed that the high curvature is not impaired by the discontinuity
of contrast polarity. Therefore, the curvature detection mechanism including end-stop cells
are not susceptive to the discontinuity of contrast polarity and not relevant to the curvature
blindness illusion.
The models of low-curvature detection presume combination of the outputs from
orientation selective cells (Loffler, 2008; Poirier & Wilson, 2006; Wilson, 1985; Wilson &
Richards, 1989). Although these models did not consider the contrast polarity of the
orientation cells, other psychophysical studies demonstrated that the mechanisms of
curvature detection are selective to the luminance contrast polarity (Bell, Gheorghiu, Hess,
& Kingdom, 2011; Gheorghiu & Kingdom, 2006). The present study also implies that the low
curvature detector would combine the local and neighboring orientation filters in a selective
way depending on the contrast polarity of orientation filters. Taken together, the local
orientation filters need to have the same contrast polarity to be combined to construct the
low-curvature representation; otherwise, the low curvature is hardly detected.
The failure of the detection of the low curvature might be related to the impaired curvature
detection by line segmentation (Watt, 1984, 1985). In a series of psychophysical studies, Watt
and his colleagues demonstrated that the segmentation of a curved line by line intersections
(Watt, 1985) or gaps (Watt, 1984) elevated the curvature detection threshold. In the present
study, the change of luminance contrast resulted in the percepts of segmentation, which
would disrupt the curvature detection. Note that, since the illusory effect was absent for
the segmented lines in the high-curvature condition (Experiment 1) and in the white and
black background condition (Experiment 2), the line segmentation might be necessary
condition yet would not be sufficient condition.
The perception of obtuse corner was not impaired by the discontinuity of contrast polarity
at the corner. Like a detection of curvature, the detection of corner is also modeled as the
combination of orientation filters (Ito & Komatsu, 2004; Snippe & Koenderink, 1994).
Unlike the low-curvature detector, however, the obtuse corner detector would combine the
local orientation filters regardless of their contrast polarity.
Thus, even though low-curvature detection and obtuse corner detection would be achieved
by combining the local and neighboring orientation filters, the visual system seems to have
separable integration processes, intermediate representations, and detectors for low curvature
and obtuse corner.
The illusion demonstrates that one exactly ``sees'' an illusory zigzag pattern against a
physically wavy pattern. Even if the curvature and corner are detected in a separate
process, impairment of the percepts of low curvature does not necessarily mean that the
percepts of obtuse corner will appear. Then, how can the physically wavy lines be replaced
by the perceptually zigzag lines? Here, we speculate the relation between the low-curvature
detector and the obtuse corner detector.
The first assumption is that the visual input of low curvature would satisfy the requirement to
trigger the obtuse corner detector, since there are surely two different orientations before and
after the turning point of the low curvature. The second assumption is that the low-curvature
detector combines the outputs from the local orientation filters with the same luminance
contrast polarity, whereas the obtuse corner detector does not care of the contrast polarity of
local orientation filters. The first assumption would be supported by the physiological studies
that identified some cells responding both curves and angles (Hegde
´ & Van Essen, 2007). In a
normal condition, however, we do not perceive an obtuse corner against a low curvature. This is
because a low curvature detector, which was also triggered by the input of the low curvature,
interferes with the output of the obtuse corner detector. Thus, the percepts of low curvature
``win'' there. On the other hand, in the curvature blindness illusion, the visual inputs of low
Takahashi 9
curvature do not activate the low curvature detector because of the inverted contrast polarity
across local orientation filters. However, the obtuse corner detectors still respond to the low-
curvature inputs because the contrast polarity does not matter (second assumption). Then, there
is no interference from the obtuse corner detector; thus, even if the input is a wavy line, the
percepts of zigzag corner ``win'' without fighting.
This account of unbalanced competition would be consistent with a previous study on
shape adaptation (Ito, 2012). This study demonstrated that the adaptation to a circle (i.e.,
low curvature) induces the afterimage of a hexagon (i.e., obtuse corner). They also reported
that one (including me) notices that a circle deforms to a polygon during simple observation.
These results indicate that the low-curvature detector and obtuse corner detector compete to
each other. Furthermore, while some people reported that the adaptation to a hexagon
induces the afterimage of a circle, the transformation from a circle to a hexagon seems to
be more effective than the transformation in the opposite direction. These results also indicate
that the rivalry between the low-curvature detector and obtuse corner detector are not
balanced but that the corner detector is dominant. Taken together, it seems to be a robust
effect that the percepts of obtuse corner appears when the percepts of low curvature are
impaired by fatigue due to adaptation (Ito, 2012) or reversal of contrast polarity (curvature
blindness illusion). Further investigation on the interaction between different detectors­­
rivalry, imbalance, and dominance­­would be a promising way to draw a whole picture of
contour and shape perception.
Finally, not directly related to the curvature blindness illusion, we note the puzzling effects
of the obtuse corner detection. When the contrast polarity was reversed around the middle of
two corners (offset ¼ 0.33p and 0.5p), the corner detection was impaired in all experiments.
Indeed, this pattern (see Figure 4, right column, row 4) gives an impression that the angle is
less steep. See also the bottom-right (a white zigzag) and one above it (black segment on a
white zigzag) in Figure 2. While there is no difference at the corner, the corner of the former
pattern is easy to detect while the corner of the latter is rather difficult (Experiment 3,
Figure 6). The reason is open, but global shape perception might have influenced the local
obtuse angle detection (Kennedy, Orbach, & Loffler, 2006, 2008). Another interesting
observation is that the perceived frequency of the waves is increased when the contrast
polarity changes at the middle of two turning points (Figures 2 and 4, offset ¼ 0.5p
conditions). Further investigation of these unexpected effects will allow us to extend the
understanding of the mechanisms of corner detection.
