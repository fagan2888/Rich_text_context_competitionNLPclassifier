Article
Immunizing children is a complex practice that requires
health professionals to appreciate global contexts, local prac-
tice guidelines, and scholarly evidence. The article begins by
introducing two global initiatives, the Decade of Vaccines
(2011-2020) and the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP;
World Health Organization [WHO], 2012). The global initia-
tives invite countries around the world to collectively con-
tribute to immunization solutions to protect child health.
Next, the Canadian publicly funded immunization approach
is reviewed, along with two key practice guidelines. Three
key Canadian immunization competencies for health profes-
sionals are then highlighted: communication with parents,
including those who are experiencing vaccine hesitancy;
administration of immunizing agents; and documentation of
immunizations. The selected literature review informs the
analysis of the three immunization competencies. In conclu-
sion, Canadian health professionals are encouraged to con-
sider Canadian practice guidelines and scholarly evidence to
ensure evidence-informed immunization competencies are
developed that will protect child health in their home
communities.
The selected literature review focuses on meta-analyses
from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Search
terms included communicating with parents about immuni-
zations, vaccine hesitancy, administering child immuniza-
tions, and documenting immunizations. Four meta-analyses
were identified. Additional select literature is included. As is
widespread in the literature, the terms vaccination and immu-
nization are used interchangeably in this article, while
acknowledging there are subtle differences (Kaufman et al.,
2013). According to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC, 2012), vaccination refers to the injection
of a weakened or killed disease organism to stimulate a pro-
tective response and prevent future disease. Immunization
refers to a protective response process in a person that pro-
tects them from a specific disease with immunizing agents
(CDC, 2012).
World Health: Decade of Vaccines and
Global Vaccine Action Plan
The World HealthAssembly endorsed the years 2011 to 2020
as the "Decade of Vaccines" with a target of saving the lives
of two million children (WHO, United Nations International
Children's Emergency Fund [UNICEF], & World Bank,
2009). In 2010, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
announced their support for the Decade of Vaccines at the
World Economic Forum (Rappuoli, Mandl, Black, & De
Gregorio, 2011). Their US$10 billion commitment supports
the discovery, development, and delivery of vaccines to the

Immunizing Children: Current Canadian
Health Professional Competencies
Geraldine Jody Macdonald1, Margaret A. McIntyre2,1,
and Maureen A. Barry1
Abstract
This article addresses the complex contexts within which Canadian health professionals engage in immunizing children
and focuses on the Canadian practice guidelines and current scientific evidence that direct Canadian health professional
competencies. The article begins by presenting two current global vaccine initiatives and links these to immunization in
Canada. A selected literature review identifies current best immunization practices. With the purpose of promoting quality
improvement, three key Canadian immunization competencies for health professional are highlighted: communication with
parents, including those who are experiencing vaccine hesitancy; administration of immunizing agents; and documentation of
immunizations. Health professionals are encouraged to reflect on immunization competencies and ensure evidence-based
practices underpin vaccine delivery in their primary care settings.

people in the poorest countries of the world (Ozawa et al.,
2011). Other key collaborators included Global Alliance for
Vaccines and Immunization Alliance, WHO, U.S. National
Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, UNICEF, and
the African Leaders Malaria Alliance (WHO, 2012).
The GVAP (WHO, 2012) was subsequently adopted by
the WHO as a strategy to promote global health through vac-
cinations. The GVAP builds on a prior global initiative that
created ongoing collaborations between diverse arrays of
stakeholders involved with immunizations (WHO, 2012).
Collaborators include public and private sectors, manufac-
turers and academics, civil society, and the media (WHO,
2012). Key goals of the GVAP include meeting vaccine cov-
erage targets worldwide, elimination of poliomyelitis, and
reduction of child mortality (WHO, 2012; WHO, UNICEF,
& World Bank, 2009).
Six core principles guide the GVAP beginning with coun-
try ownership (WHO, 2012). Each country must take full
responsibility for developing and funding effective immuni-
zation programs for all citizens. This will guide their contri-
bution to the global "Decade of Vaccines." Five additional
guiding principles include shared responsibility between all
stakeholders, equitable access to immunizations, integration
of the immunization programs within the primary health care
system, guarantee of sustainability of the immunization pro-
gram, and support for innovation that will ensure ongoing
quality improvement (WHO, 2012). Detailed goals, mea-
sures of success, and objectives direct global/local imple-
mentation of the GVAP (WHO, 2012). In Canada, health
professionals contribute to child health through administer-
ing publicly funded immunizations.
A Canadian Perspective: Publicly
Funded Immunization
Canada has a publicly funded health care system, although
health care is the responsibility of the 10 provinces and three
territories. There are a few exceptions such as health care for
First Nations and Inuit in Canada. First Nations and Inuit
health care involves an intricate, inter-reliant health system
that is managed by First Nations and Inuit, federal, provin-
cial, and territorial jurisdictions (Health Canada, 2012).
Canada does not have a national immunization program.
In 2003, Canada adopted a National Immunization Strategy
(NIS; Public Health Agency of Canada [PHAC], 2009). The
NIS promotes the effectiveness and efficiency of immuniza-
tion programs in Canada. Collaboration with federal, provin-
cial, territorial, and other partners is essential. Childhood
immunization programs are publicly funded across Canada
and delivered by a combination of public health profession-
als and primary care practitioners. The NIS also identifies
"Immunization Competencies for Health Professionals" to
ensure Canadians are optimally protected from vaccine-pre-
ventable diseases (PHAC, 2008).
Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization
[NACI], a committee of experts, produces evidence-based
national immunization guidelines (Erickson, DeWals, &
Farand, 2005). Individual provinces and territories decide
which vaccine programs they will include in their publicly
funded immunization schedules. Health professionals need
to keep up-to-date with their current provincial/territorial
immunization schedule.
In December 2012, "The Canadian Immunization Guide
(CIG)­Evergreen Edition" (NACI & PHAC, 2012) was
launched. The CIG­Evergreen Edition is an innovative,
online, best practices resource that provides up-to-date infor-
mation that is readily available. The CIG­Evergreen Edition
is updated regularly by PHAC (2011) and, within it, specific
provincial/territorial immunization schedules can be
accessed by health care professionals and parents. Canada's
NACI reviews vaccine research on an ongoing basis to
ensure the national immunization guidelines are based on the
best available evidence.
Canadian children who receive their publicly funded vac-
cine series in infancy and childhood are protected from diph-
theria, pertussis, tetanus, polio, Haemophilus influenzae
Type b (Hib), pneumococcal disease (childhood immuniza-
tion protects against 13 of the most common serotypes of
pneumococcal disease), measles, mumps, rubella, and
Hepatitis B. All provinces and territories offer vaccines to
prevent meningococcal serogroup C. Many provinces and
territories provide protection from four different meningo-
coccal serogroups, via the quadrivalent vaccine ACYW-135,
in late childhood or early adolescence (PHAC, 2014). All
provinces and territories have single-dose varicella immuni-
zation programs and currently, eight provinces have added a
second dose for better varicella protection. Since 2011, five
provinces and two territories added rotavirus oral vaccine to
the infant schedule (PHAC, 2014).
Human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine was approved in
2007 and by 2010 was delivered to females across Canada
through school-based programs. Males do not have access to
publicly funded HPV vaccine in Canada, with two excep-
tions. Prince Edward Island expanded its HPV vaccine pro-
gram to include males this past school year (PHAC, 2014).
Alberta announced plans to include males in the upcoming
school year, beginning September 2014 (Alberta Health,
2014). Advocating for access to publicly funded vaccines is
an important role for Canadian health professionals.
Canadian Health Professional
Competencies
Canadian health professionals who immunize children are
guided by the Canadian immunization competencies for
health professionals (PHAC, 2009). Developing and main-
taining health professional immunization competencies link
to the GVAP principle of promoting innovation and quality
Macdonald et al. 3
improvement. Three immunization competencies are of par-
ticular interest to health professionals at this moment in time:
communication with parents, including those who are expe-
riencing vaccine hesitancy; administration of immunizing
agents; and documentation of immunizations. The three
competencies are addressed in this article by creating an
analysis of best practices based on the Immunization
Competencies for Health Professionals (PHAC, 2009), the
Canadian Immunization Guide (NACI & PHAC, 2012), and
four meta-analyses from the Cochrane Database of
Systematic Reviews. Meta-analyses identify the best quality
of scholarly evidence available. A number of additional arti-
cles are integrated into this analysis including systematic lit-
erature reviews, concepts/definitions, and emerging
innovative approaches of particular value that were known to
the authors.
Communication With Parents
Health professionals have an important role communicating
with parents about their children's vaccinations. Health pro-
fessionals are aligned with the GVAP when dialoguing with
parents about vaccine-preventable diseases in prenatal set-
tings, well child visits, hospital settings, schools, daycares,
homes, workplaces, faith communities, and telephone hot
lines. Ideally, parents are engaged partners in decisions
regarding the health care of their children and they feel com-
fortable bringing questions and concerns about immuniza-
tions forward to health professionals (Austvoll-Dahlgren &
Helseth, 2010).
Health professionals who are aware of the influences of
the social determinants of health on parents'vaccine decision
making will be in a position to offer supportive advice and to
anticipate barriers to vaccination. Despite having a publicly
funded health care system, barriers remain in Canada.
Barriers may include the lack of funds for transportation to
the clinics or an inability to take time off of work to bring
their children to the clinic to receive publicly funded vacci-
nations. Advocating with decision makers for resources for
parents such as bus tickets or evening clinics will support
both vulnerable parents/families and the goals of the WHO's
"Decade of Vaccines." Such interventions link to Primary
Health Care [PHC] principles of health promotion, public
participation, and appropriate technology and the PHC val-
ues of social justice and equity (Smith, Van Herk, &
Rahaman, 2012; WHO, 2008).
However, health professionals have more to learn about
how to be effective in their key role of communicating with
parents about vaccinations. Kaufman et al. (2013) published
a Cochrane meta-analysis as one part of a 2-year multi-stage,
global research project called "communicate to vaccinate"
(Kaufman et al., 2013). The "communicate to vaccinate"
global research project focuses on improving vaccine cover-
age by systematically developing new knowledge and under-
standing about effective communication interventions in low
and middle income countries (Kaufman et al., 2013).
Kaufman et al.'s (2013) meta-analysis is titled "Face to face
interventions for informing or educating parents about early
childhood vaccinations." Face to face offers parents/consum-
ers an opportunity to talk with health care professionals in
either one-to-one or group settings that facilitate questions
and sharing of concerns and/or preferences (Kaufman et al.,
2013).
The authors began their review with a thorough search
strategy that yielded more than 9,000 articles (Kaufman et
al., 2013). They ended up including just seven trials, six ran-
domized control trials [RCTs], and one cluster RCT in their
analysis (Kaufman et al., 2013). The combined seven trials
included 2,976 participants (Kaufman et al., 2013). The stud-
ies had high heterogeneity, which restricted the authors'abil-
ity to consider them together. While several studies found
limited positive responses to face to face interventions, col-
lectively they did not.
As the authors state, "The limited evidence available is
low quality and suggests that face to face interventions to
inform or educate parents about childhood vaccination have
little to no impact on immunization status, or knowledge or
understanding of vaccination" (Kaufman et al., 2013, p.21).
There was not enough evidence, however, to suggest a
change in current face to face practices despite the lack of
affirming data. Future research is recommended to determine
effective face to face communication interventions (Kaufman
et al., 2013).
A related study is underway, also part of the 2-year "com-
municate to vaccinate" global research project (Kaufman,
2013). This systematic review is titled, "Community-directed
interventions informing and/or educating about early child-
hood vaccination" (Saeterdal, 2012, p. 1). Community inter-
ventions target populations or local community groups while
face to face interventions target individuals. The meta-analy-
sis is in protocol stage and the results are not yet available.
The findings will contribute a valuable perspective on the
effectiveness of community interventions in communicating
about childhood immunizations, specifically linking knowl-
edge and vaccination uptake.
Brunson's (2013) small study (N = 196) is innovative and
provides vital insight into the potential significance of social
networks in influencing first-time parental vaccine deci-
sions. An imaginative social networking analysis was used to
examine how conforming and nonconforming first-time par-
ents used social networks, including the people and the
sources they consult for guidance and information (Brunson,
2013). Social relationships, including "spouses/partners,
family members, and friends" (Brunson, 2013, p. 1404),
were found to have the most influence on first-time parent
vaccine decision making. Brunson (2013) names these "peo-
ple networks" (p. 1399) and found "people networks" also
include peers at work, parenting educators, and health
professionals.
The most predictive factor in Brunson's (2013) study was,
paradoxically, identified as first-time parents whose people
networks advocated for nonconformity. First-time parents
4 SAGE Open
who were advised not to follow recommended vaccination
schedules by trusted family, partners, and friends were most
likely to be influenced by this advice, even if the advice chal-
lenged personal perceptions (Brunson, 2013). Brunson
(2013) concluded that social networks, particularly people
networks, play a key role in shaping vaccine decisions for
first-time parents. People networks were found to be more
influential than source networks including television, celeb-
rity reports, and social media via online sources (Brunson,
2013). Future research is recommended to focus on commu-
nity interventions that reach the diverse people whom par-
ents are most likely to consult prior to vaccine decision
making (Brunson, 2013).
Brunson's (2013) study highlights the importance of
health professionals engaging with first-time parents, becom-
ing part of their "people networks," taking time to listen to
parents' concerns and preferences, and exploring what par-
ents' "people networks" have advised them to do. Through
forming trusting relationships with first-time parents, health
professionals will have the opportunity to positively influ-
ence their decision making about child immunizations.
Additional research about the influence of social and "people
networks" on parents with multiple children would provide
valuable guidance for health professionals who are hoping to
influence experienced parents to make informed vaccine
decisions. Community social network intervention research
may offer an important approach as it has the potential to
increase awareness of people networks within an entire
community.
Communicating with parents who are vaccine hesitant.An
emerging challenge for health professionals is communicat-
ing with parents who are reluctant to immunize their chil-
dren. Although the concept is not new, vaccine hesitancy is a
relatively recent term that identifies less than ideal vaccine
acceptance in a population despite accessible vaccination
programs (Larson, 2013). Another definition focuses on con-
fidence, complacency, and convenience, as evidenced by the
following quote:
Vaccine hesitancy is a behavior, influenced by a number of
factors including issues of confidence (do not trust vaccine or
provider), complacency (do not perceive a need for a vaccine, do
not value the vaccine), and convenience (access). (WHO, 2013,
p. 1)
Eisenstein (2014), a journalist, insightfully suggests that
parents are expected to give their child injections with bio-
logical matter that most people do not understand and pre-
vent diseases that they have never seen, which can create a
sense of hesitancy. Parents may be worried about potential
side effects of vaccines, including minor swelling and, rarely,
seizures and anaphylaxis (Eisenstein, 2014). They may also
have been scared by myths that are still circulating, such as
the discredited claim of a link between autism and measles
mumps rubella vaccine known as MMR vaccination
(Eisenstein, 2014).At the same time, parents may be unaware
of the threat to their child's health from vaccine-preventable
diseases. Threats may include living through a serious illness
such as pertussis/whooping cough, lifelong complications
such as amputations, and even death (Eisenstein, 2014;
Geddes, 2014; Rainey et al., 2011).
Renowned photographer Anna Geddes (2014) released an
e-book titled Protecting Our Tomorrows: Portraits of
Meningococcal Disease, which includes haunting, posed
photographs of physical losses related to meningococcal dis-
ease. The images are supplemented by distressing yet resil-
ient stories shared by these survivors of meningococcal
infections. To view the images, press control and click on the

Geddes's (2014) e-book highlights tragic complications
related to meningococcal infection. The impact of this book
is uncertain, but it is powerful and memorable. Anna Geddes
(2014) hopes that her art will help parents recognize the
value of immunizing their children and avoiding the heart-
ache that survivors and their families have endured. Research
to study the impact of Geddes's (2014) approach would con-
tribute to our understanding of the effectiveness of the arts in
communicating with parents about the value of
immunization.
Sadaf, Richards, Glanz, Salmon, and Omer (2013) com-
pleted a Cochrane meta-analysis of interventions to reduce
vaccine refusal and hesitancy including parent education,
vaccine exemption policies, and state laws. Thirty studies
were reviewed. The authors concluded that there was a lack
of strong evidence on effective interventions to reduce paren-
tal refusal or hesitancy and recommended future research
(Sadaf et al., 2013). The lack of strong evidence on effective
interventions to guide practice with hesitant parents is chal-
lenging for health professionals.
The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) is the
principal advisory group to the WHO for vaccines and immu-
nization. There is an earnestness to address vaccine hesitancy
because the anticipated achievements of the "Decade of
Vaccines" and the "GVAP" cannot be realized without the
co-operation of the global community of parents, as well as
professionals, and organizations (WHO, 2012; WHO,
UNICEF, & World Bank, 2009). SAGE recently completed a
literature review on vaccine hesitancy. This literature review
associates vaccine hesitancy with a complex set of factors,
relationships, and priorities (SAGE Working Group on
Vaccine Hesitancy 2013). To connect to the review, press
control and click on the following link: http://www.who.int/
immunization/sage/meetings/2013/april/2_Systematic-lit_
Review.pdf . This literature review offers insights into hesi-
tant parents that are of value to health professionals.
Confidence in vaccines falls on a continuum from com-
plete refusal to complete trust in the safety of vaccines and
the vaccine delivery system (SAGE Working Group on
Vaccine Hesitancy, 2013). Lack of confidence in vaccines
Macdonald et al. 5
can result in total refusal, delay, or selective acceptance of
childhood vaccinations (SAGE Working Group on Vaccine
Hesitancy, 2013; WHO, 2013). In "Working With Vaccine
Hesitant Parents," Macdonald and Finlay (2013) suggest that
motivational interviewing and directed evidence-based
information are most helpful in developing a working rela-
tionship with hesitant parents. The NIS goals incorporate
professional and public acceptance of vaccination programs
as well as reassurance that optimal safety and effectiveness
strengthen confidence resulting in vaccine acceptance.
Vaccine complacency happens when parents are unable to
define or recognize the risk of their child contracting a vac-
cine-preventable disease (SAGE Working Group on Vaccine
Hesitancy, 2013; WHO, 2013). Convenience reflects the
parental vaccination experience as it relates to ease of access
and comfort (WHO, 2013). Time, place, comfort, and afford-
ability are all considerations for vaccine programs. The
CIG­Evergreen Edition (NACI & PHAC, 2012) notes that
pain and anxiety related to the injection are determinants of
vaccine hesitancy. Health care providers have an important
role in addressing parental and child concerns.
Parental concerns about vaccinations for healthy children
are different from parental concerns related to health care for
a child suffering from an illness or a condition (NACI &
PHAC, 2012). Despite their overall positive uptake at a com-
munity level, 40% of Canadian parents surveyed express
fears related to the safety of vaccines for their children
(PHAC, 2011). Parents expect to understand the risks and
benefits associated with vaccinations, prior to making an
informed choice (Dube et al., 2013; Hagood & Herlithy,
2013; Larson, 2013). Educating parents about vaccine safety
increases confidence and is an important role for all health
care professionals, not just for health professionals who actu-
ally vaccinate children. It will take a collective effort to
ensure Canadians continue to enjoy positive child health out-
comes related to vaccination programs (Hagood & Herlithy,
2013).
Open and supportive communication between health pro-
fessionals and parents is a key strategy to promote informed
parental choices about childhood immunization (Austvoll-
Dahlgren & Helseth, 2010). Health professionals need to
develop an excellent knowledge base to be able to skillfully
facilitate parents' learning about the complexity of child
immunizations, and they need to engage in a parent-centered
approach (NACI & PHAC, 2012). This dialogue should
include building on current client knowledge and referring to
reputable websites for vaccine-preventable diseases
(Austvoll-Dahlgren & Helseth, 2010; NACI & PHAC,
2012).
Accurate evidence presented within a client-centered rela-
tionship is currently identified as the most supportive
approachtowork withthevaccine-hesitantparent(Macdonald
& Finlay, 2013; NACI & PHAC, 2012). For example, parents
often worry about the total number of vaccines their children
receive, through childhood immunizations. Taking the time to
listen to parents' concerns and clarify the science underlying
immunizations is an important health professional role. When
parents learn that in the 1980s, 3 childhood immunizations
exposed children to 3,044 antigens, while today, prevention
against 16 diseases, via 14 vaccinations, exposes children to
only 177 antigens (Smith & Marshall, 2010), they are able to
make a more informed choice about vaccinating their
children.
Parents today readily access the Internet and are able to
locate research articles, without necessarily having the skills
to critically appraise the value of the research. They also hear
health news via television and social media, which may
report on a new research study or a concerning experience
related to vaccinations. Health professionals utilize commu-
nication skills to discuss parental concerns that arise from
social media, media, and published research. For instance, if
parents read about a new vaccine for pregnant women that
reduces newborn infection, they may seek advice from
trusted health professionals about its value. Health profes-
sionals can listen to parental concerns, educate parents about
the complex process of expert review for new vaccines, and
clarify whether the new immunization is on the approved
public health vaccination schedule.
Health professionals are expected to review the scholarly
literature and keep up-to-date with new developments so
they are ready to respond to questions from parents such as
those related to vaccinations in pregnancy. Two of the four
retrieved Cochrane Collaboration meta-analyses examine
the outcomes of immunizing pregnant women against vac-
cine-preventable diseases to prevent newborn infection.
Chaithongwongwatthana et al. (2012) reviewed pneumococ-
cal vaccination during pregnancy and concluded that there
was inadequate evidence to assess the impact of maternal
vaccination on infant infections. Currently, the CIG­
Evergreen Edition states that pneumococcal vaccine is rec-
ommended for pregnant women with underlying conditions
making them at risk of invasive disease (NACI & PHAC,
2012).
Chaithongwongwatthana et al. (2012) suggest that trials
of neonatal pneumococcal immunization would be of value
and might eliminate the need for further studies of pneumo-
coccal vaccination on pregnant women. A second meta-anal-
ysis by Sangkomkamhang, Lumbiganon, and Laopaiboon
(2011) found insufficient evidence available to assess the
impact of immunizing pregnant women, with Hepatitis B
vaccine, on infant infection; future RCTs were
recommended.
It is important that health professionals are up-to-date
with both the current scholarship on vaccinations and the
experts who guide care in their own health care contexts.
Some country guidelines recommend pertussis vaccine dur-
ing pregnancy. Currently in Canada, experts do not routinely
recommend pertussis vaccine during pregnancy. Pertussis
containing vaccine can be given post partum if the mother is
not already vaccinated to help protect the newborn or in
6 SAGE Open
particular situations when benefits outweigh the risks in late
pregnancy (NACI & PHAC, 2012). Understandably, this can
be confusing for parents. Health professionals who are pre-
pared to respond to parental questions support the goals of
the GVAP.
Administration of Immunizing Agents
Perhaps the biggest shift in immunization practice is the new
urgency to reduce and manage immunization pain and anxi-
ety in children and youth, including educating parents about
pain management during injection (Taddio et al., 2012). By
the time a Canadian child reaches the age of 19 years,
depending on provincial/territorial programs, most will have
received up to 26 immunization injections (Laroche & Diniz,
2012). Research has established that immunization injec-
tions are the most common reason for iatrogenic or proce-
dure-induced pain in infants and children (Taddio et al.,
2010). Pain from the shot or needle puncture has been noted
as a common barrier to receiving vaccines and can lead to
nonadherence to vaccine recommendations across the life
span, needle avoidance, vaccine hesitancy, and increased
vaccine-preventable diseases (Taddio et al., 2012).
An effective pain management approach improves the
immunization experience of children, parents, and the immu-
nizer, and promotes vaccine program acceptance (Taddio et
al., 2010). One identified best practice for infants is com-
bined analgesia, which produces approximately 10 minutes
of analgesia. Combined anesthesia begins with establishing a
good latch and breastfeeding an infant for 1 minute prior to
injection, then continuing to breastfeed for several minutes
following the needle (Taddio et al., 2010). Cuddling, promot-
ing sucking, and a sweet taste work in combination to
enhance the analgesic effect (Taddio et al., 2010). Other
infant analgesic methods advocated by Taddio et al. (2010)
include offering babies unable to breastfeed under 1 year
between 2 and 10 mL of a sugar­water mixture (one packet
of sugar dissolved in 10 mL of water) using a small cup, oral
syringe, or pacifier.
Other physical approaches to pain management include
keeping babies and children in an upright supported position
and encouraging parents to cuddle during the injection, a
cost-free approach to pain reduction (Taddio et al., 2010).
For 3-year old children, child led distractions such as blow-
ing bubbles or deep breathing are shown to be helpful. For a
child above 4 years, stroking the skin near the injection site
creates analgesia for injection (Taddio et al., 2010). Using
topical anesthesia creams designed for immunizations and
giving the more painful immunization injection last when
administering more than one vaccine at a visit are also known
to provide pain control (Taddio et al., 2010). Advocating for
government procurement of vaccines, which cause less pain
than alternatives, is an important health professional and
public health policy role.
In the case of school-based childhood vaccination pro-
grams, one qualitative study found that participants, girls,
aged between 11 and 12 years, experience fear waiting to be
vaccinated for HPV in the school (Cooper Robbins, Bernard,
McCaffery, & Skinner, 2010). Pain management was more
readily accepted when it followed education about the value
of having the HPV vaccine (Cooper Robbins et al., 2010).
Distraction methods of pain management such as listening to
an iPod and peer support during immunization were used
effectively in this age group (Cooper Robbins et al., 2010).
Health professionals are encouraged to integrate client
focused pain management techniques when vaccinating.
Studies on the use of oral analgesics such as acetamino-
phen, prior to vaccination, have shown no effect on pain at
the time of injection (Taddio et al., 2012). In addition, advis-
ing children that the needle will not hurt is ineffective and
may undermine a trusting relationship between the child and
health care provider (NACI & PHAC, 2012; Taddio et al.,
2010, pp. 1992-1993).
To administer immunizations safely, health professionals
need to follow vaccine product delivery directions and up-to-
date immunization guidelines. Aspiration is no longer con-
sidered a best practice for either subcutaneous or
intramuscular injections of vaccines and immunization
(Crawford & Johnson, 2012). There are no research data to
support the use of aspiration, but there is evidence to show
that aspiration and slow prolonged injection time cause an
increase in pain in children (Crawford & Johnson, 2012;
Taddio et al., 2010). Current best practices focus on injection
technique, correct needle size, careful land-marking, and
speed of injection (Crawford & Johnson, 2012; Ipp, Taddio,
Sam, Goldbach, & Parkin, 2007).
Vaccination administration best practice techniques that
health professionals need to incorporate with subcutaneous
injections are use of a 1.6 cm (5/8 inch) 25-gauge needle,
with a pinch of skin lifted from the muscle, and a 45° angle
insertion (NACI & PHAC, 2012). Intramuscular injection
best practices include use of a 22- to 25-gauge needle, use of
a needle that is long enough to reach muscle, holding the skin
taut and a 90° angle needle insertion, in addition to use of the
vastus lateralis muscle (anterolateral thigh) in infants <1 year
of age, and normally, using the deltoid muscle of anyone 1
year of age (NACI & PHAC, 2012). If two injections are
being given, the use of two limbs is advised while for multi-
ple injections, more than one injection can be given in a sin-
gle limb, as long as there is at least one inch between
injections and precise site documentation is completed
(NACI & PHAC, 2012).
Documentation of Immunization
No meta-analyses were identified that review documenta-
tion of immunizations. Current best practices are based on
Canadian practice guidelines. Best practices confirm the
need for health professionals to record vaccines accurately
and completely each time they give a vaccine (NACI &
PHAC, 2012). The minimum data to be recorded in the cli-
ent's record include the name of the vaccine, the date (day,
Macdonald et al. 7
month, and year) and route of administration, the anatomical
site, the name of the vaccine manufacturer, the lot number,
and the name and title of the person administering the vac-
cine (NACI & PHAC, 2012). The completed document pro-
vides a reference point in the uncommon event of an adverse
event following immunization (AEFI; NACI & PHAC,
2012).
In 2013, the CIG­Evergreen Edition vaccine safety sec-
tion was updated to further support Canadian practitioners'
understanding of vaccine pharmacovigilance including iden-
tification and reporting of AEFIs (NACI & PHAC, 2012).
An AEFI report includes a detailed description of the event,
its duration, health care utilization, treatment, and the final
outcome (NACI & PHAC, 2012). AEFI reports are analyzed
to monitor vaccine safety and to detect possible vaccine
safety signals which may warrant further research, and might
lead to an action, such as recalling a vaccine lot (NACI &
PHAC, 2012). While we do not have mandatory reporting of
AEFIs nationally, laws requiring health professionals to
report AEFIs have been enacted in some Canadian provinces
and territories (Gahunia, Bigham, Konrad, & Snow, 2013).
Complete and accurate documentation by those vaccinating
contributes to timely and thorough reporting of AEFIs and
reassures the public about immunization safety.
Health professionals are encouraged to keep separate or
easily retrievable summaries of vaccination records to expe-
dite vaccine eligibility assessment when the client is in the
office (NACI & PHAC, 2012). In addition, depending on
your province/territory and the child's age, either the health
care provider or parent is required to ensure the local public
health system is updated with the recent vaccines received by
the child (NACI & PHAC, 2012). This provides data for pub-
lic health professionals to assess immunization coverage,
plan and evaluate public health programs, as well as target
vaccine promotion and programs for families in communi-
ties with lower vaccine coverage rates (NACI & PHAC,
2012).
Vaccine registries enable vaccine record keeping, and
have wide-ranging benefits. These information software
applications have the capacity to issue recall/reminders if
overdue for a vaccine, record immunization events, and
notify clients when immunizations are due (Laroche & Diniz,
2012). At a population level, comprehensive vaccine regis-
tries are the gold standard for the assessment of vaccine cov-
erage, vaccine effectiveness, and vaccine safety (Laroche &
Diniz, 2012). The registry can include barcoding of vaccines
with a scan function to assist with data accuracy (Laroche &
Diniz, 2012). An ongoing Canadian goal is to establish a
compatible comprehensive national immunization registry
similar to Australia's (Laroche & Diniz, 2012).
Following vaccine administration and recording, health
professionals need to ensure that parents are prepared for
their responsibilities. Health professionals provide each
child's parents with a personal copy of their child's vaccina-
tion record card and remind parents to keep it in a safe place
and have it updated whenever their child receives a vaccine
(NACI & PHAC, 2012). Parents need to know that they are
responsible for providing a photocopy of the record when
requested for school entrance, camp enrolment, and other
registrations. Promoting safe keeping of and accurate child
health records remains a challenge in Canada. Laroche and
Diniz (2012) reported that 30% of parents misplace immuni-
zation records, 15% report incomplete records, and 24% of
records contain data entry errors. Technology may offer an
improved opportunity for parental record keeping.
Recently, the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (2012)
developed a smart phone application (app) for recording
immunizations and reminding parents when the next vaccine
is due. The iPhone app, "ImmunizeON," was introduced in
Ontario for infants born after August, 2011. This new tech-
nology is a welcome alternative to the traditional yellow
card, appealing to young parents who are technologically
savvy and utilize smart phone apps in many aspects of their
lives. Parents have access to timely, reliable vaccine infor-
mation, they are advised when immunizations are due, and
their child's immunization status is tracked onto an elec-
tronic yellow immunization card (Ottawa Hospital Research
Institute, 2012). This app has recently been released by
Immunize Canada and is available for parents to use across
Canada. The ImmunizeCA app is free and can be down-
loaded from iTunes, GooglePlay, or BlackBerry World via
http://www.immunize.ca/en/app.aspx
Completing an individual immunization record after each
child vaccine is administered will produce a record of all the
vaccines a person has in infancy, childhood, and adoles-
cence. This documentation contributes to health care
throughout the life span. For instance, a young adult present-
ing for medical care with symptoms of measles would be
assessed based on his or her clinical, travel, and vaccination
history. They would carry a lower index of suspicion if they
had received the recommended schedule of measles vaccina-
tions. The efficacy of vaccination with two doses of MMR
vaccine after the first birthday approaches 100% protection
from measles infection (NACI & PHAC, 2012). In addition
to vaccination status, the client assessment would include
epidemiological links to confirmed measles cases, travel to
measles endemic areas, and presenting symptoms.
Another instance where the lifetime vaccine record is
needed follows acceptance of employment in a health care
setting. These data ensure the health worker is protected
from vaccine-preventable diseases at work and prevent the
need for costly reimmunizing or laboratory blood testing as
proof of immunity for employment purposes.
Conclusion
Canadian health professionals are encouraged to reflect on
immunization competencies and ensure evidence-based
practices underpin vaccine delivery in their primary care set-
tings. Vaccine hesitancy can be addressed through effective
8 SAGE Open
communication, including evidence-based discussion about
vaccinations. Health professionals who communicate about
immunization using parent-centered approaches, provide
children with adequate pain management when administer-
ing vaccinations, and rigorously document each vaccination,
play a key role in protecting child health in their communi-
ties. New research on effective approaches to respond to
parental concerns and reduce vaccine refusal and hesitancy is
needed to increase vaccine acceptance in the future.
Canadian health professionals contribute to achieving the
vision of the WHO's "Decade of Vaccines" and GVAP by
immunizing Canadian children. Health professionals in other
countries contribute to the WHO's "Decade of Vaccines" and
GVAP by immunizing children in their home countries.
Collectively, we are protecting the health of the world's
children.
