In the past, Historically Black Colleges and Universities
(HBCUs) relied on their history and tradition to attract the
best African American students. As doors opened at majority
institutions, HBCUs had to form strategic initiatives to dem-
onstrate what they offered to attract diverse students, so as to
increase their incoming freshmen class. In addition to deal-
ing with recruitment and diversity challenges, they must also
deal with a population of students that already exists within
the student body: lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender stu-
dents. In the last decade, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgen-
der (LGBT) students have become very visible at HBCUs,
but this visibility is not reflected in some colleges' student
programs and activities. Only a few HBCUs, such as Howard
University inWashington, D.C., and Spelman and Morehouse
College in Atlanta have made an attempt to recognize these
students. What I mean by visibility at this point and through-
out this project in reference to LGBT students on campus is
the fact that they are simply not recognized or acknowledged
in the governing and activities of the university. We are a
long way from the visibility of having outward LGBT repre-
sentation among faculty, administrators, and in athletic pro-
grams, which would be true visibility.
Also, only a few HBCUs are on the LGBT-Friendly
Campus Climate Index, and of the 106 federally designated
HBCUs, only 21 or 22% hosted LGBT student organizations.
Acknowledging that the LGBT community is significant and
exists, and fostering such support, comes up against a steep
wall of religious tradition and doctrines, and conservative
administrations. HBCUs must foster a sexual discourse of
resistance to hetero-patriarchy to create and support safe
spaces for LGBT students to articulate and envision their
identity as part of the general campus community without
alienation or fragmentation. The purpose of this article is to
assess and critique the need for unified involvement in creat-
ing an accepting and empowering atmosphere for LGBT stu-
dents at HBCUs.
All first time students in general find college stressful, but
LGBT students usually stand "outside the dominant cultural
`codes of heteronormativity'" (Morris, 1998, p. 276). They
often disrupt the binaries of normalcy in social institutions and
structures that make their environments much more stressful
(Butler, 2004; Dilley, 2005; Johnson & Henderson, 2005;
Luhmann, 1998; Means & Jaeger, 2013; Meiners, 1998;

The Difference Safe Spaces Make: The
Obstacles and Rewards of Fostering
Support for the LGBT Community at
HBCUs
Kendric Coleman1
Abstract
In the last decade, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) students have become very visible at Historically Black
Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), but this visibility is not reflected in some colleges' student programs and activities. Only
a few notable HBCUs, such as Howard University and Spelman College, have made a concerted effort. Acknowledging that
the LGBT community is significant and exists, and fostering such support, comes up against a steep wall of religious tradition
and doctrines, and conservative administrations. It is imperative that HBCUs address LGBT issues and create and support
a safe space for students to articulate their identity. Meanwhile, many LGBT students on these campuses find voice and
understanding in Black scholars and writers such as Audre Lorde's Zami: A New Spelling of My Name and Charles Michael
Smith's Fighting Words: Personal Essays by Black Gay Men.

harassed because of their sexuality or their perceived sexuality
by other students who can navigate within dominant cultural
codes (Mays & Cochran, 2001; McCabe, Bostwick, Hughes,
West, & Boyd, 2010; McMurtrie, 2013; Petrosino, 2003;
Rankin, 2004; Savin-Williams, 1994; Wells, 2009; Yost &
Gilmore, 2011). According to R. L. Miller (2008), college is a
critical time when many LGBT students explore their sexual-
ity, but they often find very little support in coping with both
their academic demands and sexual identity on campus (Choi,
Han, Paul, & Ayala, 2011; Poytner & Washington, 2005).
Thus, these students face the most problems when it comes to
discrimination during their undergraduate years (Rankin,
2004).
Tomlinson and Fassinger (2003) posit that campus cli-
mate plays a crucial role in the psychosocial development of
LGBT students because of homophobia and heterosexual
normalcy. The lack of safe spaces that provide support for
LGBT students lead to higher rates of distress, alienation,
and discrimination (Mays & Cochran, 2001; McCabe etal.,
2010) compared with their heterosexual counterparts, forc-
ing LGBT students to navigate on their own and often mak-
ing them more susceptible to depression and suicidal
behavior (Kisch, Leino, & Silverman, 2005). After analyzing
15,977 college students who participated in the National
College Health Risk Behavior Survey (NCHRBS), Kisch
and colleagues (2005) found that LGBT students were 2.6
times more likely to consider or attempt suicide compared
with heterosexual students. Thus, there is a critical need to
provide a positive environment for LGBT students, espe-
cially at HBCUs.
Current Status of HBCUs and LGBT
Population
HBCUs have been slow to meet and respond to the needs of
the LGBT community on their campuses. According to
Harper and Gasman (2008), some are known for having
unsupportive environments. Others are known for making
some progress by allowing LGBT student organizations on
campus but with relatively little to no inclusion in larger cam-
pus politics. And yet, some have attempted to take bold steps
to normalize their campus environment by integrating the
LGBT community within the larger community of the univer-
sity as a whole. According to the University of Pennsylvania
Graduate School's study (Gasman, 2013), "The Changing
Face of Historically Black Colleges and Universities,"
HBCUs are beginning to change their attitude toward LGBT
students. Howard University has had an on-campus support
organization for LGBT students since the 1980s. Spellman
College served as an example for HBCUs when it sponsored
a national conference in 2011 on HBCUs and LGBT issues.
They also have student organizations as well. Putting them
well ahead of most HBCUs, Bowie State University opened
its Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, and
Allies Resource Center in 2012. Morehouse offered its first
LGBT course in 2013 taught through Skype by a Yale faculty
member, which focuses on Black gay, lesbian, bisexual, and
transgender history. Thus, slowly, HBCUs are beginning to
recognize and validate other sexualities and identities.
Conceptual Framework and Method
This project answers the following question: Why do LGBT
students find the campus climate difficult to negotiate at
HBCUs? This article is an evaluative study that analyzes the
LGBT experience using multiple fields of inquiry that
include archival study of the Black church and homosexual-
ity; HBCUs and social conservatism regarding homosexual-
ity, which includes campus climate for students and faculty,
and administrators' perception and tolerance; and exclusion
in class and course curriculums and personal narratives. This
project is framed around Jones and McEwen's (2000) Model
of Multiple Dimensions of Identity (MMDI), which posits
that the MMDI "is a fluid and dynamic one, representing the
ongoing construction of identities and the influence of chang-
ing contexts on the experience of identity development"
(p. 408). The model explains a person's identity status within
a particular time frame and shows how individuals experi-
ence various identities at both the core and external levels.
The core identity is the internal self-identity that is "some-
what protected from view" (p. 408) and includes one's per-
sonal characteristics, values, and attributes. Race, gender,
and religion are examples of socially constructed labels that
make up external identities (Davis, 2008), which may vary in
terms of their importance and complexity to the individual.
Some of the aspects of both identities become intersecting
circles; therefore, "one dimension may be understood singu-
larly; or it can be understood only in relation to the other
dimensions" (Jones & McEwen, 2000, p. 410).
The prioritization and placement of these identities deter-
mines the level of salience that external identities have in
relation to the core identity. The context in which MMDI is
experienced affects whether or not the dimensions become
more or less salient "as they interact with contextual influ-
ences such as family background, sociocultural conditions,
current life experiences, and career decisions and life plan-
ning" (Jones & McEwen, 2000, p. 410). The ignoring of
these identities by HBCUs fosters a problematic environ-
ment for their LGBT population.
The Black Church and the Veil of
Resistance
When HBCUs do not account for the way LGBT students
negotiate their identity, their environments render LGBT stu-
dents and faculty invisible and marginalized. The same
occurs within the Black church as well.As a result, the LGBT
community at HBCUs and some Black church members seek
other ways to negotiate their place and space within unrecep-
tive environments. The environment of HBCUs for LGBT
Coleman 3
students can be both hostile and rejecting to neutral and
unconcerning (Kirby, 2011; R. L. Miller, 2007; Poynter &
Washington, 2005). Neutral means that they are neither
acknowledged nor denied. The backbone of resistance to the
quest for inclusivity for the LGBT community at HBCUs
and the birthplace of social conservatism practiced by admin-
istrators is the Black church, the most recognized central,
oldest, and influential institution in the Black community
(Cantey, Bland, Mack, & Joy-Davis, 2013; Kirby, 2011). A
number of HBCUs were founded by churches or church
organizations (Baptist, Christian Methodist, African
Methodists Episcopal, United Methodist, and Presbyterian;
Cantey et
al., 2013). But even more critical, "the Black
church is the spiritual ark that also preserved and empowered
Black people socially, psychologically, and physically dur-
ing slavery" and other difficult times (R. L. Miller, 2001,
p. 1).
The Black church not only greatly influences regular
churchgoers but also indirectly influences the lives of Blacks
who are not churchgoers through its ideology and imagery
with which many were raised. This continues to influence
their later beliefs and practices in other areas of their lives.
Thus, the Black church and HBCUs become two powerful
pillars in the Black community that perpetuate and foster
homophobic environments against the backdrop and in sup-
port of their Christian values (R. L. Miller 2007; Patton,
2011; Schulte, 2004). Through interviews and commentary,
producer Clay Cane's (2015) long overdue online BET
(Black Entertainment Television) documentary Holler If You
Hear Me: Black and Gay in the Church discusses and ana-
lyzes the spiritual abuse and violence some Black churches
heap upon their LGBT members, forcing them to participate
in their own oppression to be a part of the church family.
However, it is important to note that Black churches are not
the only source of homophobia in the Black community.
According to Ward (2005), three different types of expla-
nations have been posited that make up the roots and charac-
ter of homophobia in Black churches within the United
States: religious belief, historical sexual exploitation, and
race survival consciousness. "All of these are intimately
related to the history of slavery, underscoring the complex
background influence of racism in the genesis of homopho-
bia" (Ward, 2005, p. 494).
The first of these perspectives, religious belief, relates
homophobia to literalist theological view in which theologi-
cal and biblical scholars move Christian groups toward
greater biblical integrity on homophobia by giving contex-
tual clarity to passages long adhered to as justification for
homophobia (Ward, 2005). Many Black religious figures see
this view as a White hegemonic approach. Black ministers
and congregations, who have been distrustful and rather
immune to White-dominated approaches, however, have
rejected such biblical scholarship and revisionism. Therefore,
one can argue that homophobia in the Black church is directly
related to the "authority given to a perceived literal
interpretation of scripture" (Ward, 2005, p. 495). Douglas
(1999) suggests that it is understandable in the context of
their historical experience why Black people use the Bible to
condemn homosexuality when one considers how enslaved
Blacks sought refuge and found freedom in the literalness of
scripture.
When considering the second explanation of these per-
spectives, historical sexual exploitation, one needs to con-
sider the historical stereotypes that developed during and
after slavery, the mammy, jezebel, and the hyper-sexual brute
to name a few. The media has basically reincarnated these
characters through the domineering matriarch, the welfare
queen, and the criminalized, violent, and sexually promiscu-
ous Black man, which indicates how ingrained these images
are and what they suggest in the psyche today. What is prob-
lematic about this, according to West (1993), is that institu-
tions in the Black community have historically and
purposefully ignored addressing the fundamental issues of
sexuality, particularly in public, out of fear that it may con-
firm stereotypes that some Whites have long held. This out-
of-sight-out-of-mind mentality leads these institutions to let
social and cultural problems fester beyond repair, especially
in the name of religion.
In terms of the third explanation of homophobia in the
Black church, many African Americans feel that addressing
such an issue is not worthy due to what Crichlow (2004) calls
"race survival consciousness" (p. 32). Lemelle and Battle
(2004) argue that Blacks adopted the immoralism of homo-
sexuality of Western culture during slavery, colonialism, and
imperialism, which caused a melding of both Western and
traditional African religious beliefs. Thus, the urgency of
racial consciousness of survival and preservation among
Blacks who sought to construct Black masculinity as they
struggled against White domination has combined with
homophobic religious moralisms (Ward, 2005). The deposits
of this joining and what Ward (2005) calls "religion-driven
homophobia and bio-nationalism" have been that Whites and
homosexuality are both understood to connote weakness and
femininity; conversely, Black masculinity has been con-
structed in hyper-masculine terms (p. 495). Anything that
threatens this construct will be ignored, not only in the Black
church but in other areas of African American life as well.
These explanations of homophobia shed light on the diffi-
culty that many Black churches have when dealing with
homosexuality among their congregations and within their
own ranks, and in turn, as the central social institution of the
Black community, addressing issues such as HIV.
Although a number of cases speak of the prevalence of
homosexuality in the church in all aspects, the Black church
doctrine usually casts a silent veil over these internal issues
while condemning it externally. One case in point is the law-
suit filed in 2010 against Bishop Eddie Long who was the
bishop of the New Missionary Baptist Mega Church in
Lithonia, Georgia. Long was sued by several males who
accused him of allegedly gaining their affection with gifts
4 SAGE Open
and a loving father relationship when they were teenagers,
then allegedly leading to a sexual relationship. Despite the
fact that evidence was mounting, Long vehemently denied
the accusations when he addressed his congregation.
Eventually, he settled out of court with each alleged victim
for an undisclosed amount of money. What is most interest-
ing is that the majority of his congregation stood behind him
without any type of investigation or probational removal.
What is even more disturbing is that the church did not take
this opportunity to deconstruct old damnation rhetoric
against queer identities to establish an inclusive forum of dis-
cussion. Instead, the silencing effect was implemented, as
staff writer Patrick Johnson (2010) makes clear in The
Christian Science Monitor in his response to the Long
situation:
. . . Black theologians say the mega church leader's decision
both to deny the charges and claim fallibility in the eyes of God
is part of a pervasive "don't ask, don't tell" reflex in the Black
church, where outwardly stated condemnations inhibit frank
discussions about sexuality of any sort. It's a situation that leads
many Blacks, by force of culture, religion, and tradition, to live
double lives: one in the church, and one at home.
Here Johnson is commenting on the direct homophobic rhet-
oric that is part of everyday day life in some Black churches.
Long was considered one of the most anti-gay pastors. I have
personally attended churches where derogatory gay and les-
bian terms were used in highflying sermons to make clear
that homosexuality is an abomination.As the authority figure
of the church, the minister usually goes unchallenged, even
when members are aware that he is gay or has committed
other "sins," members of the choir are gay, and many in the
congregation are gay. No one in the church questions such
religious dogma within the church. Strikingly enough, "some
Black gay men remain in traditional Black churches that are
unabashedly homophobic and endure the oppression" (Ward,
2005 p. 499). Thus, the Black church doctrine toward queer
identities leaves many in the LGBT community in psycho-
logical turmoil as they try to reconcile with who they are and
to feel loved by God at the same time without shame. As
Griffin (2006) posits,
. . . to be cut off from the Black church is really being cut off
from the Black community, the Black family, because "aint no
place else" you can be just by virtue of being Black and be
somebody. You're a child of God; you're someone with dignity;
you're someone who holds the promise of a new world, of God's
kingdom will be done. To be cut off from the Black church is to
be cut off from your lifeline. (p. 188)
Although many aspects of the Black church are becoming
commercialized, it is still the primary place where African
Americans receive religious and personal therapy to cope
with the vicissitudes of life. To maintain this lifeline, many
LGBT people, after years of self-discovery, create double
lives as to participate in their religious community and
secretly maintain their sexual identity. This is the result of
the disembodied belief system, hate the sin, love the sinner
that many pastors preach (Samuel, 2015) according to Rev.
Kenneth Samuel of Victory for the World Church in Stone
Mountain, Georgia, during his interview in the documentary
Holler If You Hear Me: Black and Gay in the Church.
According to Samuel, one cannot separate one's existence as
homosexual from one's individual personhood and humanity
that this disembodied belief system purports, which creates a
contradiction in faith for many in the LGBT community. As
a result, the LGBT community has started its own churches
such as The Vision Cathedral Church in Atlanta where they
can worship God as a complete individual. When LGBT
people are forced to live a covert existence, it leaves little
room for compassionate and inclusive discourse on queer
identities in the Black church.
In response to the silent veil used by the Black church,
Douglas (1999) calls for a "sexual discourse of resistance"
that challenges the Black church to become a voice for those
who are marginalized, outcast, or oppressed because of who
they are (p. 139). She emphatically asserts, "for the church to
be homophobic and heterosexist is for the church to be
Antichrist" (Douglas, 1999, p. 140). According to Gary
Lemons (2010),
for as clearly as Brown maps the deadly effects of these twin
evils in her book, the New Testament charts the life and life-
saving "acts" of Christ to demonstrate that sinners are those who
foster racism, sexism, and homophobia and those who nurture
racist, sexist, and heterosexist structures and systems--likened
to the Antichrist. (p. 76)
Thus, Lemons is calling for a more liberating biblical dis-
course. Such a discourse is needed if the Black church is to
once again be the political, social, and cultural force it was
during the Civil Rights Movement to adequately address
issues in the Black community (sexuality, HIV, crime, etc.)
rather than becoming a paragon of commercialized jargon
and showbiz religion used to put on a show for its parishio-
ners who leave high off rhetoric and low on long-term
empowerment. This type of abusive discourse may also lead
heterosexual men "who might not normally express hyper
masculinity to feel pressure to do so as a result of repeated,
impassioned church-inspired homophobic messages; `. . .
indeed, it may even vindicate their beliefs and fears about
homosexuality,'" which makes them less tolerant in other
aspects of their lives (Ward, 2005 p. 498).
The Battle for Voice and Identity
Against Social Conservatism
As always with any suppressed group, a way of expression is
found regardless of acceptance from the dominant populace.
The participants in E. Patrick Johnson's (2008) study, Sweet
Coleman 5
Tea: Black Gay Men of the South, several of whom were
alumni of HBCUs, describe how Black gay men are "incor-
porated into the fabric of student life . . . and how sometimes
they are cordoned off into their own discrete organizations"
(p. 285). These formal and informal existences are noticeable
in fraternities and sororities, gospel choirs, fashion shows,
and within other social networks. The lack of acknowledg-
ment of the LGBT community on the campus by universities
as a whole and the secret societies that Johnson speaks of
suggest that HBCUs are contradictory environments when it
comes to recognizing the existence of queer identities.
What prevents these sexualities from becoming a recog-
nized norm is the social conservatism that exists on the cam-
puses of many HBCUs, even those that have managed to
establish social groups and organizations for Black queer
students. This conservatism is usually accompanied by social
practices that attempt to regulate and eradicate sexual diver-
sity. One example that articulates this practice is the incident
in 2002 at Morehouse College in which a supposedly gay
male student was beaten to death for allegedly making a pass
at another male student in the shower. This incident forced
the issue of homosexuality to the surface and forced admin-
istrators to move beyond a position of tolerance to a position
of recognizing and understanding the diverse sexualities that
existed on the campus. Prior to this, Morehouse was reluc-
tant to address any notion that challenged their vision of
masculinity embodied in the "Renaissance Man," which
Morehouse established as the type of man all their students
would become during and after their tenure at the college.
Harper and Gasman's 2008 National Black Male
Achievement Study explores 12 HBCUs and 76 participants
in an attempt to examine how Black male students character-
ize, respond to, and make sense of environmental politics
(Harper & Gasman, 2008). The study notes one particular
written policy toward sexual behaviors of one HBCU where
"sexual misconduct is defined as including, but not limited to
sexual intercourse, adultery, rape, sodomy and homosexual
acts" (Harper & Gasman, 2008, p. 353). This language basi-
cally equates consensual sex between adults with rape.
According to the study, homosexuality was cited as sexual
misconduct in a number of other documents reviewed. A
number of participants in the study spoke at length about
institutional resistance to same-sex relationships, mostly
from faculty and administrators. James, a FloridaAgricultural
and Mechanical University student, describes the resistance
to the ways in which LGBT people are treated in the larger
Black community: "this campus is like the rest of Black soci-
ety; it is not accepting of gay culture. And so, they are defi-
nitely on the outskirts of this campus. They are not included"
(Harper & Gasman, 2008, p. 342).
Other participants in the study noted how LGBT students
had been rendered invisible despite the presence of gay Black
males who outwardly express themselves through feminine
aesthetics. It was noted, however, that these students were
usually not part of, or functioned within, heterosexual Black
male peer groups; they regulated themselves to other students
with the same expressive style. This type of peer bonding and
exclusion was especially noticed at Morehouse, the only sin-
gle-sex HBCU in the study. Participants in the Morehouse
study group noted that a significant number of gay men
attended the college, but dialogue and meaningful interaction
between these students and heterosexuals were routinely
avoided. For example, "Ross, a senior, characterized
Morehouse as "a very heterosexual place, and he observed
that gay male students were not befriended by many hetero-
sexual males on campus" (Harper & Gasman, 2008, p. 343).
Another Morehouse student had strong concerns about how
the institution was handling heterosexism and homophobia:
Seeing how this is an all-male school, seeing how we're in the
middle of Atlanta, and that Blacks are notoriously homophobic,
how are we going to manage it? Are we just going to sweep it
under the carpet? That's what's usually done. (Harper &
Gasman, 2008, p. 343)
According to the study, a number of participants reported
that structured conversations about LGBT issues were not
facilitated by administrators or faculty unless a student was
harmed or the issued received a lot of media attention.
A perfect example that supports the participants' observa-
tions is another situation that disrupted the vision that
Morehouse prescribed for Morehouse men to develop when
an organization that represented an aspect of the LGBT com-
munity called "The Plastics" was formed. Issues surrounding
"The Plastics" received a lot of media attention. It is impor-
tant to mention that this was not an official university organi-
zation. "The Plastics" can best be described as a group of
males who function as interstitial figures and disrupt the bor-
der of feminine aesthetics through clothing styles and man-
nerism to develop their own distinct identities. Because of
this group of students, as well as those male students who
wore more urban attire such as do-rags, hoodies, and saggy
pants, Morehouse instituted a broad dress code policy that
banned such clothing in 2009, both in classrooms and at for-
mal events. The most telling statement that resulted from the
incident is listed in the Morehouse College, Division of
Student Services (2013) as Appropriate Attire Statement
Number Nine: "wearing of clothing associated with wom-
en's garments." This statement attempts to protect the foun-
dation of the university: masculinity, or rather the university's
prescribed notion of masculinity.
"The Plastics" inferred that the ban of feminine attire vio-
lated their freedom of expression (King, 2010). Of course,
Morehouse could and did cleverly argue that the new dress
code was dealing with the larger issue of defining what best
represents a Morehouse man. According to Morehouse Vice
President of Student Affairs at the time, Dr. William Bynum,
The university respect[ed] the identity and choices of all young
men at Morehouse; however, "the Morehouse leadership
development model sets a standard of how [they] expect[ed] the
6 SAGE Open
young men to dress, and this attire [that `The Plastics' used for
expression] does not fit within the model." (King, 2010)
The model is based on the tenth president of Morehouse,
Dr. Robert M. Franklin Jr.'s, call for the college to produce
"Renaissance Men with a social conscience and a global per-
spective to uplift and serve" (Morehouse College, Division of
Student Services, 2013). His vision centered on what he called
the "Five Wells: well read, well spoken, well-travelled, well
dressed and well balanced" (Morehouse College, Division of
Student Services, 2013). Although Morehouse's leadership
model does include internal qualities of what a Morehouse
man is, the foundation of the leadership model is a fundamen-
tal outward and physical manifestation of masculinity based
on a performance of masculinity. The policy does a good job
teaching the general student body the importance of dress and
appearance, but it forces some gay males to conform in a way
that may go against who they are and how they should act.
In essence, by using clothes as a prescription for masculin-
ity, Bynum is articulating that to be a leader one must possess
notions of prescribed masculinity (talking, walking, and dress-
ing a certain way) by following a strict norm of hetero-fashion
that has little to do with intellect, respect, confidence, and
responsibility. Although these qualities are more empowering
constructs of masculinity, they will not always come in the
package that Morehouse prefers. Simultaneously, this dress
code defines "The Plastics" and other transgender persons as
incapable of being leaders at Morehouse and as an unrecog-
nizable gender. Certainly no one is questioning Morehouse's
right to set standards for Black men by requiring a dress code,
which ensures order and continuity, but the statement that
speaks against wearing women's garments further marginal-
izes certain students and creates a culture of homophobia on
campus, while instilling such warped homophobia in future
leaders who will certainly face diverse sexualities in the work-
place. Of course, Morehouse is in a peculiar situation as an
all-male college; anything other than heterosexuality goes
against the very foundation the college is built on. The college
faces the difficult challenge of trying to include different sexu-
alities without emasculating itself in the eyes of heterosexual
and conservative supporters and fostering a platform that may
intentionally lead to more gay and transsexual students apply-
ing to the university who may lean toward feminine aesthetics.
However forming an appropriate dress code for those gay stu-
dents with "so-called" feminine aesthetics would have been
much more inclusive rather than issuing a broad statement that
speaks against such an aesthetic with very little explanation.
The major argument for dress codes is based on the theory
that learning socially appropriate manners and wearing
appropriate attire to specific occasions and situations are
critical factors in the total educational process. It is true that
limited modalities of dress limit distractions, but there is
something much more deliberate going on: control. The con-
trol of one's image that matches and perpetuates what society
has deemed as normal ways of dressing and acting for men
and women. There is no room for in-betweeness or extrem-
ism. These dress code (and sometimes hair-style) restrictions
not only fight against the criminalization of urban wear by
police profiling and gangsta rap, but also draw from a
Victorian discourse of rigidity when it comes to male and
female attire. This is especially true on the campus of some
HBCUs, as indicated by the conservative dress code policies
of Oakwood University, Edward Waters College, Paul Quinn
College, Norfolk State University, Virginia Union University,
and Hampton University. All these universities filter their
dress codes through the lens of gender-specific codes.
These gender-specific codes position the male body as
always cloaked in fabric whereas the female body is more
revealed with tight fitting outfits, regardless whether it is
business or casual dress, as objects of desire (Penney, 2012).
In other words, whereas a tight short mini skirt and low cut-
ting halter-top may violate the dress code for women, tight
business suits and heels do not. This standard of dress is part
of a much broader view in the tradition of western dress prac-
tices. Diana Crane (2000), a feminist scholar, notes that "for
approximately the past one hundred years, the expression of
sexuality in men's clothes has been largely taboo, while
women's clothes throughout the period remained sexually
expressive" (p. 194). Laura Mulvey (1975), another feminist
scholar, adds to Cranes' notion by positing that this western
tradition of dress is organized around the principles of "the
male gaze and the female's to-be-looked-at-ness" (p. 6).
Thus, male patriarchal privilege enforces concealment for
men whereas women are revealed as their objects of desire.
Because sexuality and female liberation have become more
visible in society in general, these tightly structured dress
codes have met with resistance. As early as the 1980s, a
number of designers of urban male wear experimented with
more fitted and skin-tight clothes for men by presenting the
male as a sexual object. Today you have hip-hop moguls
such as Kayne West, P. Diddy, Pharrel Williams, and other
designers moving beyond urban street wear to high fashion
where skinny jeans, which were once considered off limits
for urban males, are now very popular. You only need to look
at the performers of the 2014 BET Hip-Hop awards to see
how much. Such clothing presents important symbolic "chal-
lenges to hegemonic masculinity" (Crane, 2000, p. 195).
It has been difficult for males who choose to do so to flip the
script, so to speak, and reveal their bodies with tight clothes; this
might signal their own desire and interest in their own or another
male's sexual objectification and violate the established gender-
specific codes of hip-hop fashion, which greatly influence
young Black men's attire in general. To remedy this, Black
males usually sag their skinny jeans or if they are wearing form
fitting pants, they usually wear a long shirt-like garment that
sometimes comes to their knees as not to draw attention to their
form. Tight clothes that draw attention to the male form are per-
ceived as dangerous and threatening not only to the perceived
notion of masculinity but also to the entire western patriarchal
order because of the potential of de-phallicization.
Coleman 7
One must be aware, however, that arguments presented by
Crane and Mulvey have not and do not always hold true for
AfricanAmerican males. For example, the body of Black male
slaves, according to Roach, was always presented nude during
the slave auction to show strength and work potential (Roach,
1996). It must be noted, however, that Black males did not
have ownership of their bodies during slavery. The history of
Black male style in the States has also included a number of
interpreted examples of flamboyant and body-focused dress
styles, even when framed within a definitive heterosexual con-
text. For example, the form fitting style of Black dandyism
was prevalent in the 19th century (M. L. Miller, 2009). Dandy
is defined as a man who affects extreme elegance in clothes
and manners. The clothes may be loose or fitted. Dandyism
has experienced a revival of sorts with the appearance of
music artist Jidenna and his hit song "Classic Man" (Mobisson,
Kwabena, & Wonder, 2015), which celebrates elegant dress-
ing and well-groomed hair (sometimes finger waves), good
manners, and taking care of your business. A similar style was
echoed during the disco era of the 1970s, which consisted of
form fitting bell-bottom pants for both men and women. It is
important to note that the standards of dress concerning Black
males are sometimes inflected by race, class, and a number of
other factors. The critiques presented here are just helpful
ways to understand the ways in which these gendered specific
codes of hip-hop are situated within the broader cultural con-
text of the United States.
Nonetheless, because of the challenges to these dress codes
and other incidents involving LGBT students, Morehouse
College in particular must be given credit for a number of
forums on homosexuality and masculinity offered each semes-
ter. For spring 2013, Morehouse's Sociology Department
offered the first course for the Black LGBT community for the
university titled "A Genealogy of Black LGBT Culture and
Politics" (Lee, 2013). Dr. Jafari Allen, a Morehouse alumnus
and professor at Yale University taught the course by video-
conference. This is progress, but a more powerful statement of
purpose could have been made with a newly developed or
revamped course/curriculum on campus. And, the videocon-
ference course in some ways still positions the university lead-
ers as distancing themselves from the issues rather than
actively engaging in them as faculty and administrators.
Nevertheless, the offering of this course is progress for the
university, but it is only a charge for Morehouse and other
HBCUs to mend the psychic distance between tolerance and
acceptance and move beyond an ideology of neutrality to a
more thoughtful, intentional engagement of issues relevant to
the Black LGBT community on their campuses.
Creating Empowering Environments
for LGBT Students
Such intentional and inclusive engagement would allow all
identities and sexualities to navigate and be fully recognized
by the university. LGBT students, staff, faculty, and adminis-
trators are instrumental in creating friendlier environments
according to Morrow and Messinger's (2006) survey of 20
institutions. This can be accomplished by allowing LGBT
students and organizations to present informational work-
shops at convocation and throughout the semester. Guest
speakers and experts may also be invited to take part in these
workshops. Students may be allowed a day each week or
each month to express themselves as they really see them-
selves in decent fashion, a decency that needs to be defined
through a collaboration between the university and LGBT
students. Such special days can coincide with events on cam-
pus by these students to share their world, their joys, and
pains with the university community through entertainment
events and discussion forums. This allows a conversation
about sexualities to begin and a culture of existence, accep-
tance, and tolerance to take root. Once again, dress codes
alone only further marginalize LGBT students, making them
the targets of homophobia.
Morehouse is used here as an example of only one institu-
tion of social conservatism in practice. A number of HBCUs
are facing the same problem. But what is impeding the
acknowledgment, acceptance, and tolerance of LGBT stu-
dents are the administrators of HBCUs. HBCUs themselves
fail to recognize and are ignorant of the fact that LGBT col-
leagues exist among their ranks. These are colleagues who
could potentially support and foster such change; however,
LGBT faculty members are less likely to support any initia-
tive that goes against administrators without true protection
of their jobs in place. Other administrators who may want to
support such agendas may refrain because offering their sup-
port may be viewed as a critique of their own sexuality,
regardless of whether or not they are gay. As a result, LGBT
students have very few support mechanisms to support their
cause.
Although all universities have the stipulated policy that
they are "equal opportunity employers who do not discrimi-
nate against religion, sexual orientation, and people with dis-
abilities etc.," and some now include gender identities, the
statement for the most part fulfills a requirement for legal
purposes rather than an embodiment and belief in the state-
ment. During my 13-year tenure at an HBCU, before recently
joining the faculty of a majority institution, there was never
any recognition of LGBT faculty by the administration.
When I arrived at my current institution, I immediately
noticed that all invites indicated faculty members and their
"significant others or partners were welcomed" to social
functions. This was not only the tone from top administrative
offices but also the tone across the board. It appears that the
administration made a concerted effort to send a positive
message to LGBT faculty and an attempt to be inclusive.
Such statements do not automatically mean that the atmo-
sphere is what it should be, but LGBT faculty pay special
attention to the type of language used when addressing this
particular issue to detect any hints of awareness.
8 SAGE Open
Without faculty and administrative support, fostering
changes such as creating formal safe zones or safe spaces,
forming student organizations and finding an advisor, and host-
ing official programs and events to create and promote net-
works of visible people on campus who identify openly as
advocates and/or allies for LGBT students and the issues that
concern them will be a challenge for colleges and universities.
Afull-time professional member to support such issues or even
to teach is less likely to be hired, advisory committees will not
be formed to cast a watchful eye, and no experts on sexualities
and identities will be brought to the university as part of its
lecture series in a hostile, unsupportive administrative climate.
On the campuses of many HBCUs, LGBT students have to
settle for using the Ombudsman's office or counseling center,
which may not have professionals capable of dealing with their
particular issues. In essence, to make progress and have a sig-
nificant impact on LGBT issues, HBCUs must strive for diver-
sity among their administrative ranks and promote inclusivity
in their policies and procedures.
One of the main problems, however, is that many HBCUs do
not understand and are not informed about the complex culture
of the LGBT community to begin to articulate their needs. At
the HBCU where I worked, some administrators and faculty
were afraid to even use the word homosexual or gay. It was
always whispered as some dark secret or totally ignored despite
the fact that most were aware that there was a significant LGBT
community among faculty and students. Thus, many of the
administrators do not have or understand the language needed to
foster understanding of the LGBT community on their campus.
It is no wonder that some administrators at HBCUs who are in
the closet prefer to navigate their sexuality below the radar and
not engage in any university activity that questions their identity
in a climate that may be hostile to non-heterosexuals.
There is one aspect of the university where a progressive
and transformational process could have an immediate
impact on a university's culture on all levels: the curriculum.
Although many HBCUs administrators are still seeking
knowledge about LGBT students, the LGBT students have
empowered themselves by seeking out Black pioneers in
queer studies. Because these students have such a thirst for
knowledge about themselves and a confirming desire to see
themselves represented, they tune into anything that is about
them: movies, music, TV shows, out and coming out celebri-
ties. What is even more impressive is that these students are
turning to past and contemporary literature in Black queer
studies that lets them know who they are and that they were
never alone. These students are reading Rudolph Byrd and
Guy-Sheftall's collection of critical essays TRAPS: African
American Men on Gender and Sexuality, Patrick Johnson
and Mae Henderson's Black Queer Studies: A Critical
Anthology, James Earl Hardy's B-Boys Blues, and Audre
Lorde's Zami: A New Spelling of My Name, and a plethora of
other critical essays and literature that can give them the
voice and language to articulate their political and social
struggles, and their identities.
Ergo, it is no coincidence that many of the transforma-
tions that take place at HBCUs in regard to the LGBT com-
munity occur in women and gender studies departments, or
in the case of the institution where I was, a single course:
Introduction to Women Studies. This course was mostly
designed and taught by one of my colleagues, an African
American female, who is a very nurturing scholar. My col-
league and I noticed a generation of Black female students in
general from all backgrounds dealing with abuse, pregnancy,
sexuality, and a host of other problems in addition to trying
to get a degree on our campus. I noticed many of the males
going through similar issues with the maintenance of mascu-
linity. We both have always used our African American lit-
erature classes to empower our students by helping them
understand their very complex space and place in the world
as African American men and women; however, she found
that a women and genders course was needed to address the
complex issues of women, gender, and sexuality. It is through
this course that heterosexual and LGBT students found voice
and understanding through literature. When she proposed a
major in women and gender studies, she met administrative
resistance and political lip service, as administrators blew
her off for so-called more pressing concerns of recruitment,
retention, and finances without realizing that many LGBT
students, because of their thirst for knowledge about them-
selves and the creative enterprises they used to express their
identity, often possess an intellectual confidence and stability
that universities value in students. Because of the social con-
servatism that was rampant on campus, she was only able to
retain the one introductory course.
The response that my colleague received from administra-
tors sheds light on how many HBCUs approach queer identi-
ties as something new when in reality it is only more
noticeable now because more LGBT students are coming out
of the shadows of heterosexual hegemony and normativity
into the fray of acknowledgment and existence. This is where
curricular changes through course content and development
that foster a commitment to addressing Black queer identity
can be most effective at decolonizing the university's cur-
riculum, especially in African American studies programs
and courses that already exist but give little attention to queer
studies in African American culture despite their own strug-
gles to promote institutional transformation at HBCUs and
majority institutions. As Ferguson (2010) posits,
In this way, the histories of Black gender and sexual formations
would cease to be marginal issues at HBCUs and become
foundational to the liberal arts education at Black colleges and
universities . . . in order to produce a social and intellectual climate
that would engage the Black LGBTcommunity [and the university
as a whole] in the most intelligent way possible. (p. 69)
As mentioned earlier, it is not surprising that transformational
changes concerning sexuality on the campus of HBCUs usu-
ally occur in women and gender studies departments and
Coleman 9
courses because Black women have laid a solid foundation
for the struggle for sexual autonomy through a plethora of
literature and critical essays readily available. Essex Hemphill
(1991), a Black gay poet, situates the importance of this
established Black feminist foundation in the introduction to
his anthology Brother to Brother. He called the Black feminist
movement for sexual autonomy and visibility the second
renaissance in African American literature:
Black women, [according to Hemphill], opened up new
dialogues and explored uncharted territories surrounding race,
sexuality, gender relations, family, history, and eroticism. In the
process, they angered some Black male writers who felt they
were being culturally castrated and usurped, but out of necessity,
Blackwomenrealizedtheywouldhavetospeakforthemselves--
and do so honestly. As a result of their courage, Black women
also inspired many of the Black gay men writing today to seek
our own voices so we can tell our truths. Thus, we are at the
beginning of completing a total picture of the African American
Experience. (p. 40)
Here, Hemphill is calling for Black queer aesthetics to be
channeled through the struggle of Black feminists to bring
about university-wide institutional and communal change to
develop "a politics of decolonization that protects and pro-
motes gender and erotic autonomy as an extension of the
institutional imagination of Black studies and Black femi-
nism" (Ferguson, 2010, p. 71).
The classroom has a direct and positive impact on com-
munal and institutional change. The challenge is to educate
teachers in a way that allows them to recognize the complex
issues of race, culture, gender, and sexuality, and how such
awareness of these issues is important to teaching the whole
identity of a student. Often however, these dynamic intersec-
tions are ignored or repressed in the classroom. In general,
multicultural education discourse is well established, "but
stereotypic representations and repressive silence persist in
the sphere of practice" (Asher, 2007, p. 65).
From my experience in talking with students about iden-
tity issues in their classes, they indicate in most cases how
teachers ignore homophobic slurs by pretending not to hear
them or by addressing the noise that disturbs the class but not
the content of the message. "Such practices promote and rei-
fie the stereotypical binaries of `us'and `them'[and] continue
to essentialize identities, and deny multiplicities and nuances"
(Asher, 2007, p. 65). The problem is that multicultural educa-
tion has most often focused on race, while practically failing
to address differences of race, gender, and class. When framed
through the lens of Fanon's (1967) notion of the White male
gaze, multicultural education as we know it today fails to
shake patriarchal foundations of the "master's house" (Lorde,
1984), much less dismantle it, making it even more difficult
for it to be used as a model for discourse on sexuality.
Institutions in general must foster among their teachers
"critical, self-reflective ways of teaching that promote equity
and democratic ways of being" (Asher, 2007, p. 66), or as
Doll (1998) says, "queering the gaze" (p. 287). For Nieto
(2004), this type of multiculturalism directly affirms, focus-
ing on both similarities and differences present in school and
society. "It is about asking and telling about--and, of course,
listening to and seeing the differences, contradictions and in-
betweeness from which one tends to shy away" (Nieto, 2004,
p. 66). The best way to begin to implement such a pedagogi-
cal approach is to create a safe space for students to express
both their difference and resistance to social transformation,
so that they can be engaged rather than ignored. "By encour-
aging educators to examine disjunctures, ruptures, break-
ups, and fractures in [their] own and other's educational
practices, [they can in turn `queer' theory, practice, and the
self unfamiliar" (J. Miller, 1998, p. 370). It is this act of unfa-
miliaring that fosters a safe space in the classroom because
students are not bound by so-called "normal" binaries. Such
an examination by faculty can breakdown the institutional-
ized rejection of difference. Audre Lorde (1984) makes the
implications of such rejection clear:
Institutionalized rejection of difference is an absolute necessity
in a profit economy which needs outsiders as surplus people. As
members of such an economy, we have all been programmed to
respond to human differences between us with fear and loathing.
(p. 115)
Here, Lorde is commenting on how institutions ignore the
MMDI and try to erase difference and enforce silence by cre-
ating a perceived norm about race, gender, and sexuality, and
disregard any in-between locations of being. By promoting
such normativity, institutions and teachers fail to see how we
are all implicated in these relations, and fail to take advan-
tage of the opportunity to introduce students to other ways of
being to promote tolerance rather than waiting for them to
encounter this "otherness" on their own, which may lead to
fear, anger, defensiveness, resistance, and even hatred toward
such "others." According to Lorde's (1984) framework for
defining difference, patriarchal consciousness "conditions us
to see human difference in simplistic opposition to each
other: dominant/subordinate, good/bad, up/down, superior/
inferior" (p. 114). Thus, differences are conceptualized and
responded to in a way that homogenizes difference, that is,
pretend that everyone is the same. "When teachers and stu-
dents end up closeting or repressing certain aspects of their
hybrid identities, they end up . . . erasing part of themselves
and limiting the overall educational experience [for all stu-
dents]" (Asher, 2007, p. 69). The façade of normalcy must be
disrupted to get past cultural relativism to learn through con-
flict (Kumashiro, 2000).
Toward a Conclusion: Self-Liberation
At the core of improving understanding, tolerance, and
acceptance of queer identities is taking a liberal approach in
10 SAGE Open
social and cultural institutions. It is in these social and cul-
tural institutions that our youth are socialized and prepared to
navigate society. Institutions must promote what Lemons
(2010) calls a "vision of sexual discursive transgression by
crossing homiletical boundaries between theology, autobiog-
raphy, and scholarship" (p. 75; on Black feminist pedagogy)
to offer a "critique of homophobia and heterosexism in the
Black church, [and other institutions], at the intersections of
race, gender, and spirituality" (p. 76).
When we fail to diversify our curriculum on the basis of
religions doctrines and personal beliefs, we foster and per-
petuate a system of hate, misunderstanding, and marginaliza-
tion. We are also teaching people to hide who they are and
attack others who are "supposedly different" according to
society's standards.
When we teach, [preach, and lead] beyond the fear of internalized
heterosexism [and biblical damnation], we may find that the
classroom [the pulpit and office] can be a place of redefinition
and revision where teacher and student, [and pastor,
congregation, administrators, and faculty] can cross the borders
of gender, race, and sexuality to affirm education and [religion]
as the practice of self-liberation. (Lemons, 2010, p. 85)
The late Marlon Riggs (1999) articulates this notion of
self-liberation:
An inheritance from Black Cultural Nationalism of the late
sixties and Negritude before that, today's Afrocentrism, as
popularly theorized, premises an historical narrative which runs
thus; before the white man came, African men were strong,
noble protectors, providers, and warriors for their families and
tribes. In pre-colonial Africa, men were [just] truly men. And
women--were [just] women. Nobody was lesbian; nobody was
feminist. Nobody was gay. (p. 292)
Here, Riggs is calling for a deconstruction of the mecha-
nisms of homophobic oppression and of "white racism's his-
tory of and tendency to hypersexualize, pathologize,
demonize and mystify Black sexuality" (Thomas, 1996,
p. 66). Only then can Black social and cultural institutions
such as HBCUs be fully liberated and transgress textual,
social, cultural, and religious boundaries.
President Barack Obama gave a very liberating speech
when he told the Morehouse graduating class of 2013 to love
and support their loved ones and set examples of what it
means to be a good man, a good citizen. But it is not so much
what he said to the all-male graduating class at an all-Black
male college, but how he said it:
Keep setting an example for what it means to be a man. Be the
best husband to your wife, or your boyfriend, or your partner. Be
the best father you can be to your children, because nothing is
more important. ("Transcript: Obama's," 2013)
Obama's inclusive comments deconstruct the notion of hetero-
sexual patriarchy when it comes to masculinity by redefining
notions of prescribed masculinity. Society must embrace a
more inclusive and liberating approach in the operation of all
social institutions because the LGBT community is part of
every facet of our society, and they recognize the transforming
power that they hold. Those who resist may soon find that they
are the ones who are marginalized, "for it is not difference
which immobilizes us, but silence, and there are so many
silences to be broken" (Lorde, 1984, p. 14).
An evaluation of the literature indicates that universities
must include issues concerning the LGBT community when
governing the university. Because when universities do not,
LGBT students are forced into a perpetuated societal norm
that essentializes their experiences. As a result of this essen-
tialization, LGBT students are placed outside the heterosex-
ual/nonheterosexual binary and are viewed as abnormal
(Abes & Kasch, 2007). Such placement and view only cause
more misunderstanding to the university community as a
whole and internalized homophobia for some LGBT students.
Thus, campus communities need to have more educational
opportunities that allow for conversations about gender and
sexuality to combat the myths and stereotypes that have been
perpetuated about the LGBT community. The literature also
indicates that safe space groups, organizations, and training
help to provide much-needed peer support for LGBT stu-
dents. And because "the majority of social activities during
the undergraduate years are heterosexually based" (Wall &
Evans, 1991, p. 30), the ways in which institutions exclude or
marginalize members of their community must be examined
to provide more representative experiences. Overall, research
shows how important it is for HBCUs, and universities in
general, to understand sexual identities in broader terms.
Because even within the LGBT community, there are even
more complex identities to address, especially when it comes
to transgender students. To improve campus climates, there
must be a space or spaces that allow for the natural expression
and exploration of multiple identities. The more educated the
campus community is about LGBT students and issues, the
more natural it will be for them to talk about such issues.
