A Research Yearning
There has been an expressed need in recent years for what
has been referred to as a "decolonised methodology." The
term refers to a way of studying "peoples and nations whose
own histories were interrupted and radically reformulated by
European imperialism" (Smith, 2012, p. 19). A reason for
advocating such a methodology is to avoid the perceived ten-
dency for socio-scientific research in former Western colo-
nies to be linked to some of the excesses of colonialism.
Indeed, there is evidence that researches on colonized and
indigenous peoples have often been seen as disrespectful and
exploitative. For example, in the American Indian context,
"Many tribes now require that research proposals be
approved by either tribal councils or cultural committees"
(Battiste, 2008, p. 183). At the same time, scholars such as
Connell (2007) have sought to overturn the false equation
that Western knowledge equals universal knowledge, both
by contextualizing Western knowledge production as being
located in a very specific time, place, and culture, and by
presenting writing from Southern knowledge traditions.
Central to this decolonizing project is the reality of colo-
nization and other historic encounters of imperialism
between the West and the rest. Research guidelines and pro-
tocols now need to take cognizance of the fact that the very
word research currently conjures up or evokes bad memories
among indigenous and colonized people. Such use collectiv-
izes the African experience alongside that of millions of
others who encountered colonial imperialism. The grand
scale of the colonization of Africa has already been suffi-
ciently documented (Rodney, 1972). Thus, the need for a
decolonized methodology for research among indigenous
peoples is particularly pertinent to Africa. At issue here
therefore is not necessarily "foreigners" researching about
Africans and other colonized people. The concern includes
those, like us, researching among rural African communities
but trained within the Western academy. The perception of
such researchers is one of "the outsider within" or "outsiders,
because of their Western education" (Smith, 2012, p. 5).
Having attempted a decolonized methodology, we intend
to delineate here some helpful principles of a community-
based approach to research in Africa. This is done through a
fourfold structure. First, this brief article outlines the essen-
tial tenets of a community-based research (CBR). It points
out the relevance of the CBR principles for research in
Africa, highlighting examples of adaptation of CBR within
feminist and cultural perspectives. Second, it then argues that
the existing CBR does not satisfy the fundamental elements
of the African culture. It explains what constitutes these

Toward an African Community-Based
Research (ACBR) Methodology
John-Okoria Ibhakewanlan1 and Simon McGrath1
Abstract
Based on an expressed need in the past few years for an appropriate research methodology for colonized peoples, this article
proposes a way of conducting research that is faithful to the essential tenets of the African culture. The article delineates
principles of a community-based participatory approach to research in Africa. After first outlining the essential tenets of a
community-based research (CBR) that are relevant for research projects in Africa, the article argued that the existing CBR
lacked a specifically African philosophical basis. It explained the uniqueness of the African philosophy. It then summed up the
research principles based on that philosophy. Last, the challenges of conducting such a research study in Africa were outlined.
Despite the African emphasis of the overall approach, this proposed methodology may be employed in similar settings where
issues such as decolonization are important variables in the research strategy.

basic elements. Third, the article outlines the principles of a
more comprehensive approach to an African Community-
Based Research or ACBR approach. Last, some challenges
of ACBR are expressed. As we will explore in more detail
later in the article, we write in term of "Africa(n)" while
acknowledging the dangers of any such shorthand term.
Defining the Existing CBR
CBR has become prominent in recent years. "Universities
and funding agencies are increasingly calling for collabora-
tive research between community partners and academics"
(Ryser, Markey, & Halseth, 2013, p. 11). CBR is not new. It
is traceable to the revolutionary approaches of the 1970s by
oppressed communities in South America, parts of Asia, and
much of Africa. These oppressed peoples were attempting to
establish self-critical communities in the post-colonial
period. Their approach also found much common ground
with concurrent trends in feminism (Maguire, 1987).
Brazilian educator, Paulo Freire, provided the "critical
grounding" for the CBR approach (Minkler, 2005, p. 4).
Therefore, CBR could be seen as an orientation to research
with specific assumptions while employing any qualitative
or quantitative methodology.
CBR draws upon constructivism and shares in some of
the wider criticisms of positivism. It sees research as deeply
contextual. Not only does the setting matter hugely, but the
methods adopted should be determined by the purpose of the
study. Such methods must respect "the input of community
participants . . . in understanding of the phenomenon under
study" (Israel, Schulz, Parker, & Becker, 1998, p. 176).
CBR emphasizes the socially created nature of knowl-
edge and thus seeks the participation and influence of com-
munity members (as non-academic researchers) in the study
or research process. Members of the community are under-
stood here as possessing common symbols and shared norms.
Based on respect for the community, CBR attempts to build
on such shared values so as to address communal concerns
(Israel et al., 1998). It should also encompass the socio-cul-
tural factors that affect research. As such, each culture or
society would adapt CBR to its own history or specific con-
text. Based on the above summary of CBR, four tenets are
deducible from this research approach:
·
· Constructivist
·
· Context based
·
· Purpose driven
·
· Community participation
A fifth element, ethical consideration, is essential to all
academic researches (British Educational Research
Association, 2011). However, we believe that legal defini-
tions of ethics must be framed according to theAfrican world-
view and understanding of the individual. This worldview
will be explained later. Otherwise, these tenets and other
variations and additions to CBR approaches are universally
relevant.
Relevance of CBR Principles for
Research in Africa
·
· Constructivist: The constructivist approach of CBR
finds resonance in the African view of knowledge and
reality--as will be explained later.
·
· Purpose driven: African thinkers such as Kwasi
Wiredu agree that one must accept any mode of
inquiry from "our erstwhile colonisers" if it is benefi-
cial to the African community. What is rejected is that
which is imposed and may not be beneficial to the
community (Wiredu, 1998). Smith similarly reiterates
the purpose-driven aspect of researches among colo-
nized peoples by saying that, irrespective of who the
researcher may be, such studies must be of "useful-
ness" to the local community. It must also be "ethical"
and "respectful" of local communal values (Smith,
2012, p. 9).
·
· Community participation: This is an important
dimension of CBR for research activities in Africa.
According to Higgs, CBR in Africa contrasts with
action research, as it is more "process oriented" and
not necessarily targeting a specific "product" but
aimed at strengthening the knowledge of the commu-
nity (Higgs, 2010, p. 2419). It also differs from ethno-
methodological research because it is not merely
about the community; instead it is done with the com-
munity. Higgs uses the term trans-traditional vantage
to describe the notion that although CBR in Africa
highlights the African way of knowing, it also
acknowledges the validity of other non-African
knowledge systems.
·
· Context based: The context-based aspect of CBR
refers to the adaptation of CBR to local contexts. It is
not clear precisely what aspects of the local context. Is
this a material or ideological adaptation? This will be
taken up later as the basis for our approach. Currently
various participative adaptations of CBR have taken
the form either of a cultural or feminist perspective.
Such participative approaches place emphasis on
hegemony. Two examples may suffice here:
First, a participative approach to research has been used to
address feminist concerns. By involving the actual experi-
ences of women, this approach to CBR combines knowl-
edge with action so as to bring about social change toward
eliminating gender disparities or oppression of women. In
"An Emergent Africana Feminist Methodology," Assatai
Zerai explores an Africana feminist sociological perspec-
tive and framework. The approach considers ways in
which "nation, race, class, gender, sexuality, globalisation,
and other dimensions of oppression" may intersect and
Ibhakewanlanand McGrath 3
impact the experiences and agency of research partici-
pants. Zerai's focus is on those with health care and social
support in Zimbabwe (Zerai, 2014). By adapting the intel-
lectual work of Africana feminists, the work proposes a
new Africana feminist methodology.
A second example of the context-based approach is from
a cultural perspective. Whatever the research topic, health
or education, culture is at the center of the study. This is
particularly pertinent to CBR in Africa. By involving the
community in the study, this approach to CBR situates
culture at the hub of combining knowledge with action
toward achieving the aim of the study. The PEN-3 cultural
model is a practical example of a research approach
designed to guide researchers to always begin with the
positive contexts of human culture and behavior. PEN-3
is an acronym for three separate factors within three dis-
tinct domains. In the Cultural Identity domain, PEN
stands for Person, Extended Family and Neighbourhood.
In the domain of Relationships and Expectations, it stands
for Perceptions, Enablers and Nurturers. Thirdly, in the
Cultural Empowerment domain, PEN stands for Positive,
Existential and Negative. This cultural model is men-
tioned here only as an example of a cultural perspective of
the context-based approach. "Culture in this context refers
to shared values, norms, and codes that collectively shape
a group's beliefs, attitudes, and behaviour through their
interaction in and with their environments" (Iwelunmor,
Newsome, & Airhihenbuwa, 2014, p. 21). This model,
has been applied in health-related research projects among
ethnic minorities.
Whether from gender issues or a cultural perspective,
CBR approaches have ensured collaboration that equitably
involves and recognizes all stakeholders in the research pro-
cess. However, as some have noted, "the philosophy and
methods of this approach is the cornerstone of improved
community-based research" (Ahmed, Beck, Maurana, &
Newton, 2004, p. 141).
The Limitation of CBR in Africa
Any research methodology must attach itself to a specific
philosophy (Duberly, Johnson, & Cassell, 2013). The above
CBR principles may be helpful for research work in Africa,
but they do not indicate the philosophy they represent. This
is what we consider as the central weakness of the context-
based aspect of CBR. Without specifying its philosophical
foundation as African, a CBR approach in Africa may not
address a crucial issue underpinning research work in the
continent, namely, the issue of decolonization. The term
decolonization as used here means establishing the African
ontological and epistemological perspectives as the basis of
the research inquiry. The aim of decolonization is to counter-
act the continued impact of colonization on African research.
Although the full extent of the human and cultural
destruction suffered by Africa remains untold, some authors
(Abdi, Puplampu, & Dei, 2006) point out that the most dev-
astating aspect of colonization is the damage done to the
African mind--cut off from its philosophical roots. Thus, for
a research study to be decolonized, ultimately to be African
or make claims about Africa, it needs to adopt the African
perspective.
Africa's Unique Perspective
The four principles identified in CBR do not seem to include
what we consider as the fundamental elements of an African
culture. These underlying elements constitute a worldview,
which would doubly serve here as the philosophical basis for
the research methodology that will be proposed as an ACBR.
Any claim for a worldview for such a vast continent requires
detailed explanation or justification. The many and various
African perspectives will not be examined; rather, as philos-
ophers like Diop (1962) have argued, beneath the diversity of
views lies a "cultural unity" in Africa (p. 7). For the purpose
of framing the philosophical underpinning of ACBR, three
aspects of this cultural unity will be presented:
·
· A relational understanding of the individual,
·
· A social view of knowledge/existence, and
·
· A theocentric perspective of the environment.
A Relational Understanding of Person
A point of convergence in the perspectives of experts on the
continent is in the African understanding of the human per-
son (Holdstock, 2000; Jegede, 1999; Kenyatta, 1938/1979;
Kvale, 1992; Mbiti, 1969; Menkiti, 1979; Rains, 1999;
Semali & Kincheloe, 1999). According to this perspective of
person, the individual exists only as a part of the community.
For the Yoruba tribe of West Africa, this relational view of
the individual has moral implications:
The corporeal individual, essentially, cannot continue in-being
without a community . . . Since the social life of a group of
individual beings is sustained by a spirit of sodality, any form of
self-alienation for the purpose of pursuing a purely selfish aim
is, morally speaking, an error or sin . . . . (Akiwowo, 1986,
p. 353)
Various other descriptions exist in other African commu-
nities showing the strictly social connection of the individ-
ual. This African view of the person as relational is often
presented in contrast to the Western understanding of the
person as unconnected to any community (e.g., Higgs, 2010).
To emphasize the contrast between the African and Western
understandings of the person, one finds statements such as,
"Nobody is an isolated individual" (Kenyatta, 1979, p. 297)
in contrast to "not some isolated static quality of rationality"
(Menkiti, 1979, p. 158)--referring to the Western perception
4 SAGE Open
of the person. Descartes' cogito ergo sum, "I think, therefore
I am" (Descartes, 1637/1881) is also contrasted with the
Zulu expression "Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu," "I belong,
therefore I am," or, as translated by Mbiti, "we are, therefore,
I am" (Mbiti, 1969, p. 109).
In summary, this view of the person as necessarily in rela-
tion to the rest of the community is referred to as communal-
ism. According to Wiredu, "a communalist outlook seems to
be quite widespread in traditional life on the (African) conti-
nent" (Wiredu, 1998, p. 21). Communalism is described by
John Mbiti in terms of "whatever happens to the individual
happens to the whole group" and vice versa (Mbiti, 1969,
p. 109). This means that there is no lone researcher-genius
detached from a community of learners. However, commu-
nalism does not subjugate the freedom or autonomy of the
individual. Rather, as an African research perspective, com-
munalism means that the individual researcher finds identity
and meaning in the community while retaining his or her
own rational independence. Again, the idea of a lone
researcher would therefore be invalid in this perspective.
Ultimately, in line with the constructivist principle, the com-
munity's reality is constructed socially (Ibhakewanlan,
2014). The validity of that reality or knowledge thereof lies
in the fact that it is a product of the shared discourse of the
community--this is the next point.
A Social View of Knowledge/Existence
The community's shared discourse or the social view of
knowledge is related to the above understanding of the indi-
vidual. In other words, the individual and the communal are
two sides of the same coin. Two aspects will be looked at in
this communalist view: the epistemological (view of knowl-
edge) and the nature of existence (ontological). Thus, com-
munalism also guides the epistemological and ontological
positions of this approach.
Epistemological view.Although epistemology refers to "the
nature of knowledge," there are as many epistemological
perspectives as there are theoretical traditions (Merriam,
2014, p. 8). TheAfrican epistemological perspective detaches
itself from the paradigm wars based on the viewpoint ofAfri-
can philosophers (Anyanwu, 1989; Appiah, 1989; Wiredu,
1980). According to this view, the validity of any African
academic discourse lies in the question of relevance or use-
fulness to the African community at any particular time. This
means knowledge is circumscribed by the community's time
and place as well as other local factors.
Such an epistemological assumption has implications for
the overall methodology. For example, a positivist episte-
mology would mean carrying out research study with a "sci-
entific mentality" that emphasizes a "pursuit of objectivity"
(Cohen, Manion, & Morrison, 2011, p. 18). In the African
epistemological view, knowledge is non-objectivist but
requires "community-validity." By community-validity is
meant the shared discourse based on communalism. To
explain briefly, the term community-validity is used here to
refer to the common point of reference in the shared dis-
course. For example, when Mbiti quotes the Zulu expression
Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu, it is presumed that everyone in
the Zulu community understands what the term means. It is
that degree of common understanding and awareness of a
particular social reality that is meant by community-validity.
Central to this view is the African understanding of commu-
nity and the place of the individual in society. The shared
discourse does not presuppose unanimity. Because no com-
munity may enjoy perfect unanimity on all issues, the degree
of unanimity is directly proportional to the extent of the com-
munity-validity. This reflects the constructivist dimension to
this epistemology, for knowledge is understood as con-
structed by the community. The truth of what is known
through research then becomes dependent on the scope and
scale of the community-validity.
Is there still objective truth if knowledge is socially con-
structed? Yes, but any such truth claim would be directly pro-
portional to the community-validity. On the question of the
status of eternal truths independent of the community, we
would require an eternal community to behold an eternal truth
that is independent of any community. In other words, as the
next paragraphs will hopefully make clearer, such a question
is nonsensical from the perspective of communalism.
An ontological view.What the ontological question asks is
whether "social reality is external" or the "product of indi-
vidual consciousness" (Cohen et al., 2011, p. 7). With the
above epistemological view that saw knowledge as socially
constructed, does objective reality exist? Another way of
asking the question is whether research findings in Africa are
true outside the community members' experience. The Afri-
can reality is not eternal or unchanging but exists as it is
experienced here and now by the specific community. This
again raises a relativist implication.
Is the ontological status of the social reality constructed
by a community true, beyond the consciousness of its indi-
vidual members? The various individual "consciousnesses"
experiencing a particular social reality merely constitute the
communal discourse specific to that community. As every
communal discourse is its own validity, so too is the proof of
a given knowledge inherent in the knowledge itself. In a sim-
ilar way, reality is its own proof. There may be a hierarchy of
knowledge and of existence; some peoples may learn from
others, a culture from another, or even one species from
another; yet every reality remains capable of retaining its
own communal-validity. These insights about knowledge
and reality could be represented by an endless series of con-
centric circles as depicted in Figure 1 below.
Take for instance a Western engineer and a Masai herds-
man who are mutually unaware of each other's reality. To the
engineer, the reality constructed at a fire-side chat in Africa
may appear to lack objectivity, but so too would be the
Ibhakewanlanand McGrath 5
reality of iPad programming to a Masai community. Yet each
social reality exists independent of individual perception or
cognition based on their particular community-validity (the
shared discourse of that community). What this means is that
reality and community ought not to be separated but expanded
to embrace each other. If the Masai herdsman joins the iPad
manufacturing community, the programming of that gadget
becomes part of the Masai's reality. The more iPad engineers
join the fire-side chat in the rural African village, the more
"external" (Cohen et al., 2011, p. 7) is the social reality cre-
ated through the chat.
Yet our view is that the "external" and "internal" distinc-
tion is illusory. The distinction is only a handicap of space and
time--taking, for example, the when and where of the Masai
herdsman and the Western engineer. The "external" nature of
a reality socially constructed is objective for those who are
part of the communal discourse. When others outside the
community join the discourse, its "external" status becomes
validated--but only for those joining the circle of discourse.
In the above image, each circle is complete in its own right.
As with an expanding universe that creates new space, and its
ontological status is not dependent on the to-be-created
"external" space, social reality exists independent of any indi-
vidual consciousness that is not yet part of the communal dis-
course. Hence, for all practical purposes, it does not make
sense to speak of a social reality existing outside a commu-
nity. How can space exist without matter? Every reality
requires a community to represent it or experience and
describe it. These are the ontological and epistemological
positions, which also affirm the African philosophy of com-
munalism that should form the basis of a CBR in Africa.
A Theocentric Perspective of the Environment
The third aspect of the cultural unity to be presented is the
place of nature and religion in Africa. People in rural African
villages have a sense of relationship to nature, which is
almost like a reverence. As African villagers are traditionally
subsistence farmers, with some hunting alongside, there is a
daily dependence on the physical world (of plants, animals,
the elements and physical features). "To people of this kind
land was something akin to water or air; it had no owner . . ."
(Mitchell, 1954, p. 159). Rather than view the physical and
non-human world as something to be owned and exploited,
they are viewed as respectable "beings" that exist in a rela-
tionship with the community and a divine or transcendent
reality.
For the "scientific" minded, this relationship to the physi-
cal and non-human world would be interpreted as animism,
nature worship, and earth cult. Such an interpretation would
reflect a lack of appreciation of the symbolism of the African
culture--for such cults/nature worship are not true of the vil-
lages studied by this researcher:
It might be expected that cults of the sun and the moon would
play a large part in the life of African peoples, since such cults
were of great importance in ancient Egyptian religion. But in
fact such worship is rare even in the pantheons of West Africa.
(Parrinder, 1954, p. 44)
It is true that "many things are held in great esteem for
religious reasons, such as mountains, waterfalls, rocks, some
forests and trees, birds, animals and insects" (Mbiti, 1991,
p. 33). However, this esteem is not immediately at the level
of worship or religion, but only reflects the unity of relation-
ship that these people experience with the cosmic and divine
realities. This unity of relationship, between the divine and
material/human world, is often presented as the striking
dichotomy between the Western and African approaches to
knowledge. As Chivaura puts it,
The differences between African and European worldviews . . .
relate to differences in their attitudes towards the material and
the spiritual. Africans regard them as compatible. (Chivaura,
2006, p. 214)
The distinction between the African and Western perspec-
tives may appear overly dichotomous, but it at least reflects
the African emphasis on these issues. We believe these
African elements are also somewhat present in the Western
approach to knowledge and understanding of the person.
However, to dismiss the claims of African intellectuals to
what is generally seen as a people's worldview only height-
ens the dichotomy:
With rural people, and even with many township dwellers in
South Africa, the role of divine beings, ancestors, sacred places
(like isivivane), sacred people and sacred objects needs to be
addressed. To touch on these issues is to compel our
Westernised intellectuals to experience severe conceptual
violence, and yet many of them secretly subscribe to these
beliefs. (Ntuli, 2002, p. 63)
A Summary of the African Perspective
The above three aspects of the African perspective of knowl-
edge can be summed up in one word: costheantropic. The
Figure 1. Knowledge and reality as concentric circles.
6 SAGE Open
pattern is one of a holistic relationship to three realms: their
physical environment, cosmos; their strong religious spirit
and sense of the Divine, theos; last, anthropos, their relation-
ship to others or communalism. Three Greek words (cosmos,
theos, and anthropos) are used here to represent the African
sense of these physical and non-human worlds, the transcen-
dent world, and the world of people (Ibhakewanlan, 2003).
The researcher's relationship to these realms is represented
in Figure 2.
Thus, in the African cultural perspective, people are natu-
rally in relationship with their physical environment, a divine
realm, as well as with other people--in a unity:
·
· The ACBR investigator should feel himself or herself
as part of the environment (cosmos) and engaging
with it in the production of knowledge. Can the
researcher share in this cosmic feeling?
·
· The research participants (anthropos) are teachers and
co-learners. They are co-researchers. Hence the self-
ish or individualistic "I" seeking knowledge, in "my
name" as sole researcher, must give way for relation-
ship with others. Can the researcher admit the rural
participants as fellow researchers?
·
· Then, there is the question of accepting that there is
a non-physical reality (theos or transcendent)
beyond the human and physical world. For exam-
ple, there is currently a pervasive religiosity across
the African continent in a way that is not evident in
the West. To quote Mbiti's popular statement,
"Africans are notoriously religious" (Mbiti, 1969,
p. 1).
Applying ACBR becomes a relational, ecological, and
transcendent approach to life in general, not just as a research
paradigm or methodology. The sense of the transcendent, as
with the natural environment and other people, is also a rela-
tionship rather than a metaphysical discourse. The researcher
should feel and acknowledge himself or herself in such a
triune relationship. Only with such acknowledgment could a
research study claim to adopt an ACBR approach.
Précis Principles of ACBR
We have argued that communalism, as understood by phi-
losophers as a distinctive African attribute in understanding
the individual and the community, should be integrated into
the basic tenets of a research study in or about Africa. In
addition, there is need to acknowledge the African relation-
ship to nature as well as the sacred or transcendent. These
salient aspects of the culture have been encapsulated in the
term costheanthropic. This deepens the notion of CBR and
seeks to make it authentically African by grounding it onto-
logically and epistemologically in African reality.
Operationally Defined Criterion
In Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to
Fight Global Poverty, the following claim is made based on
a research study: "Tanzania experiences a rash of witch kill-
ings whenever there is a drought--a convenient way to get
rid of an unproductive mouth (an old woman in the commu-
nity) to feed at times where [sic] resources are very tight"
(Banerjee & Duflo, 2012, p. 28). Tanzanians and other
Africans with whom we have shared the above finding have
expressed surprise. Would the result or interpretation of such
a study have been different if the local people were co-
researchers in the entire process? What philosophical prin-
ciple is used in the analysis and interpretation of such
research studies in or about African communities?
For a research study to be true about Africa, we believe it
should be as far as possible based on some aspects of the
African philosophy ­ as it is generally conceived. Such a
study would, for example, acknowledge reverence for the
environment, the role of the transcendent and a communal
view of the individual and of knowledge/reality. These three
aforementioned aspects must also be seen as a unity of per-
spective. The data collection process, analysis, and report-
ing, in fact the entire research protocol, would require
faithfulness and grounding on African philosophy and prin-
ciples as already explained. Again, these African themes
include a relational understanding of the individual, a com-
munalist view of knowledge/existence and a theocentric per-
spective of the environment. Above all, it would enhance the
research credibility if the researcher shared the aboveAfrican
perspectives.
Challenge of ACBR
In this section, we reflect on an attempt to use the ACBR
approach during doctoral fieldwork. The details of the spe-
cific case are not given as they are not crucial to the argu-
ment and may undermine the confidentiality agreements
made with participants.

Orality and History
Anyone conducting a participative research in Africa may
have to be prepared for a relative scarcity of documents
(written information) compared with the volume of informa-
tion available by oral transmission. There is no real alterna-
tive to talking with the people. The African communities
visited during the study seemed to retain a fairly oral culture,
as people still preferred to ask for directions rather than use
maps. Although this orality has its obvious weakness, it
should be seen in the context of communalism, people rather
than paper, which shows the emphasis placed here on human
relationship and community.
The philosophical principles of ACBR are ultimately not
based on historical accounts traceable to classical figures as
those of the Western intellectual tradition, such as Josephus
or Plato. The dearth of ancient historical scripts in most
African societies has in the past led some to argue that
Africans have no history. Hegel, the German philosopher,
dismissedAfrica as the land of childhood (Hegel, 1830/1975).
More recently the Oxford historian Trevor-Roper stated that
there is no history of Africa except that of Europeans in
Africa (Trevor-Roper, 1965, 1969). Such conclusions are the
product of a non-decolonized research approach. An ACBR
approach would not subscribe to nor produce such a narrow
understanding of history or culture, in terms of "recorded
progress"--mostly understood in Western terms of techno-
logical advancement. Rather, as already explained in terms
of community-validity, the view here is that the culture of
any community should not be valued or devalued using the
criteria of any other society. Is not much of written history a
distortion of the past to suit one's prejudice? As defined by
Rousseau, history is "the art of choosing, from among many
lies, that which most resembles the truth" (Durant, 1927,
p. 617). Nonetheless, without enough surviving African
texts, it is difficult to assert the African philosophy upon
which we have based the ACBR approach.
Vastness and Variety
Traveling by road around East and West Africa, the vastness
of Africa became more obvious: The African continent is
larger than the combined landmass of the United States,
Western Europe, and the Indian sub-continent. This is con-
trary to the general perception thatAfrica (20% of the world's
landmass and only until recently reached 14% of the world's
population) is overpopulated. The vastness of the continent
is only surpassed by its variety. With relatively low popula-
tion density, there are many scattered small communities
with distinctive cultures. Hence it is difficult to speak of a
harmonious African community. More than 350 mutually
unintelligible languages are spoken in Nigeria alone (Okonjo-
Iweala, 2012). Therefore ACBR may not be accepted as
valid by all in Africa. In light of the diversity of the conti-
nent, it will remain debatable whether it is even justifiable to
speak of an "African culture." That is a criticism to which
this and similar papers on "Africa" will remain open. Overall,
this methodology is a process of becoming or a process-ori-
ented research approach. A unified approach to ACBR may
not be tenable in the near future.
Conclusion
This has been an attempt to delineate some helpful principles
of a community-based participatory approach to research in
Africa. This was done through a fourfold structure. First, the
article outlined the essential tenets of a CBR, which are rel-
evant for research projects in Africa. It then argued that the
existing CBR lacked a specifically African philosophical
basis, and then explained the uniqueness of the African phi-
losophy. Third, it summed up as ACBR the research princi-
ples based on that philosophy. Lastly, the challenges of
conducting such a research study in Africa were outlined.
The approach to ACBR we outline is not entirely of our
own making. In the spirit of the argument above, and of "I
belong, therefore I am," we draw on the decades of important
work done by researchers in the CBR tradition, as well as
African philosophers such as Higgs and Mbiti and other
Southern scholars such as Smith. However, where our contri-
bution lies is in seeking to make more explicit theAfricanness
of our version of CBR. ACBR is not simply a progressive
approach driven by ideology but is ontologically grounded in
African realities. This leads us to highlight the costhean-
thropic core of African cultures and bind this closely to the
methodological principles of ACBR. In doing so, we believe
that we make a contribution to an African philosophy of the
social sciences that sits within a wider tradition of various
"Southern knowledges" (Connell, 2007) that talk back to the
universalist pretentions of Western social science. In attempt-
ing such an ambitious project, we undoubtedly run the risk of
essentializing and homogenizing Africa. However, we
believe that this risk is justified to advance the crucial project
of building an alternative approach that is grounded in the
people and their cultures.
