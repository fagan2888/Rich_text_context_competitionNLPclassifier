PROVISION OF PRIMARY CARE BY
OFFICE-BASED RHEUMATOLOGISTS
Results from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys, 1991­1995
MICHAEL M. WARD
Objective. To determine the extent to which office-
based rheumatologists provide primary care to patients
without rheumatic diseases or provide principal care to
patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Methods. The National Ambulatory Medical Care
Survey was used to determine national probability
estimates of the nature and types of conditions treated
by office-based rheumatologists in 1991­1995. At each of
1,074 patient visits, the rheumatologists recorded up to
3 diagnoses and 3 patient-reported reasons for the visit,
as well as information on the treatments provided at the
visit.
Results. In only 9.8% of new consultations and
11.9% of return visits was neither a rheumatic disease
diagnosis nor a musculoskeletal complaint recorded,
indicating that the rheumatologist was likely acting as a
primary care provider at a minority of patient visits.
Among continuing patients with RA, the patient's pri-
mary reason for the visit was something other than a
musculoskeletal complaint in only 9.9% of visits, and
any nonrheumatic complaint was recorded in 30.4% of
visits, indicating that at only some visits was the rheu-
matologist acting as the principal caregiver. In addition,
only 31.1% of visits included the provision of medication
for a nonrheumatic condition.
Conclusion. In 1991­1995, most visits to rheuma-
tologists involved the provision of specialized or consul-
tative care to patients with rheumatic diseases or mus-
culoskeletal complaints, and few visits were made by
patients without either indication. Provision of princi-
pal care by rheumatologists to patients with RA is not
currently widespread.
The continued oversupply of specialist physicians
and perceived need for more primary care physicians has
focused the attention of health care planners and poli-
cymakers on the role that specialists play in providing
primary care. Specialists may provide primary care in
one of two ways: by being a primary care provider to
patients who have no medical condition relating to the
given specialty, or by providing primary care along with
specialized care to patients who have a chronic illness
related to the specialty. This latter mode of providing
primary care along with specialized care has been
termed "principal care," to distinguish it from primary
care in general. For most persons in the US, access to
specialists is not restricted by administrative barriers,
and patients may refer themselves to specialists. Con-
cern has been expressed that underworked specialists
may spend a substantial amount of time providing
primary care that, while comparable in quality with the
care provided by generalists (1­4), often involves greater
use of health care resources and higher costs (5­7).
Specialists who provide primary care are often required
by health care insurers to choose to provide either only
specialty care or only primary care. However, having
specialists provide principal care may be attractive be-
cause the efficiency of this mode of providing effective
primary and specialty care may offset any associated cost
differences.
There is little information available about the
roles of rheumatologists in the provision of primary care,
principal care, or strict specialty care. A national survey
in the mid-1970s indicated that more than half of visits
to rheumatologists involved principal care, but that

study did not examine primary care separately (8).
Surveys of community-based rheumatologists in the
1970s indicated that up to 40% of their patients did not
have a rheumatic disease (9,10), while a 1996 survey of
members of the American College of Rheumatology
(ACR) showed that primary care visits accounted for
only 6% of visits (Sheahan K, ACR: personal commu-
nication). These surveys did not include assessments of
the provision of principal care by rheumatologists, an
important omission given the recent endorsement of
principal care by the ACR (11).
In the present study, data from the National
Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys were used to investi-
gate the nature and types of visits by patients to a
representative national sample of rheumatologists in
1991­1995. The goal was to determine the frequency
with which rheumatologists provided primary care by
examining the proportion of visits by patients without a
rheumatic disease or musculoskeletal complaint. The
provision of principal care was also examined by inves-
tigating the presenting complaints and treatments of
continuing patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a
subgroup likely to receive principal care from rheuma-
tologists.
METHODS
The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey gath-
ers data on aspects of medical care provided to ambulatory
patients in physicians' offices. The survey is a research study
conducted annually by the National Center for Health Statis-
tics (NCHS); it provides nationally representative data on the
use of ambulatory medical care services, derived via a multi-
stage sampling scheme (12). This scheme includes probability
sampling of defined geographic areas, sampling of physician
practices within those areas, and sampling of patient visits
within those practices. Practices that were eligible for sampling
included those of all office-based physicians listed in the
American Medical Association or American Osteopathic As-
sociation master files who were principally involved in patient
care and who were not federal employees. Specialty designa-
tions in these master files are those reported by the physicians.
In the present study, data from the surveys conducted from
1991 to 1995 were used, and the analyses were restricted to
visits by patients age 18 years and older. The number of
physicians included in the surveys in each year ranged from
1,354 to 1,883 (response rates of 70­73%). The total number of
visits sampled was 145,716. The sample included 1,074 patient
visits to 39 rheumatologists.
The sampling unit of the survey was the patient-
physician visit. For each visit, information was collected on the
patient's demographic characteristics, the reasons for the visit
as reported by the patient (up to 3), physician diagnoses by
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clin-
ical Modification codes (up to 3), whether or not the physician
had seen the patient previously, diagnostic and preventive
health care services provided at the visit, medications, and
disposition. The patient-reported reason for the visit was
coded using a detailed scheme based on reported symptoms
(general symptoms or those referable to 1 of 9 organ systems),
specific diseases, injuries, diagnostic or preventive services,
provision of specific treatments (i.e., immunizations) or test
results, or administrative reasons (12).
To determine the proportion of visits to rheumatolo-
gists that involved strictly the provision of primary care, the
proportion of visits in which none of the 3 physician-reported
diagnoses included a rheumatic disease diagnosis and none of
the 3 patient-reported reasons for the visit included a muscu-
loskeletal complaint, symptom, or disease was computed.
Visits for laboratory testing, test results, injections, prescrip-
tion renewal, and those termed "progress visits" by the patient
were all considered to be rheumatic disease­related visits.
Proportions were computed separately for visits by new pa-
tients and visits by continuing patients. To provide an indica-
tion of the role of primary care in the work of rheumatologists
compared with other medical subspecialists, similar analyses
were performed for 5,708 visits to cardiologists, 2,166 visits to
gastroenterologists, 2,611 visits to pulmonologists, 1,558 visits
to hematologist-oncologists, 766 visits to nephrologists, and
793 visits to endocrinologists included in the survey.
To calculate the proportion of rheumatologist visits
that involved principal care, the patient-reported reasons for
the visit among continuing patients with RA were analyzed.
This subgroup was chosen for analysis because continuity of
care is one of the markers of principal care, and because
patients with RA represented the largest diagnostic subgroup
(n  285) likely to receive principal care from rheumatologists.
Care for nonrheumatic complaints is an indication of compre-
hensiveness, another hallmark of principal care. Therefore, the
extent of provision of principal care among these patients was
estimated by computing the proportion of visits in which a
nonrheumatic complaint was reported by the patient to be the
primary reason for the visit, and the proportion of visits in
which a nonrheumatic complaint was included among the 3
possible recorded reasons for the visit. As in the above analysis,
"progress visits" and visits for laboratory testing, test results,
injections, and prescription renewals were all considered rheu-
matic disease­related visits.
The proportion of visits in which nonrheumatic medi-
cations were prescribed, ordered, or administered was also
computed. In contrast to merely noting the presence of a
nonrheumatic complaint, the provision of medication for a
nonrheumatic problem signifies recognition by the physician of
some responsibility for treating the problem and serves as a
more specific indicator of a principal care relationship. In this
analysis, analgesics, antiinflammatory and second-line anti-
rheumatic medications, medications for the prevention and
treatment of osteoporosis, and medications for peptic ulcer
disease were considered to be medications for rheumatic
diseases. All other medications, including antidepressants,
were considered to be nonrheumatic medications.
Provision of preventive care is also a marker of prin-
cipal care. Therefore, the likelihood that continuing patients
with RA treated by rheumatologists would receive counseling
on diet, weight reduction, cholesterol levels, exercise, and
smoking cessation was compared with the likelihood that such
410 WARD
counseling would be provided in 32,647 visits by continuing
patients of general internists, family physicians, and general
practitioners included in the survey. The relative likelihood of
each type of counseling by rheumatologists compared with
generalist physicians was computed as an odds ratio, based on
logistic regression models with adjustment for patient age, sex,
and race. Generalized estimating equations were used to
adjust for the effects of clustering of patients by physician (13).
To produce unbiased national estimates of patient
visits and medication use, and to account for the complex
sampling design of the National Ambulatory Medical Care
Survey, the NCHS has assigned weights to each visit that adjust
for the probability that a given visit was selected, for nonre-
sponse, and for selection by physician specialty (12). These
weights inflate the number of visits in a manner that permits
extrapolation from the sampled visits to the entire US popu-
lation. For example, the 1,074 visits to rheumatologists repre-
sent 24.7 million such visits nationally, and the 285 visits by
continuing patients with RA represent 5.7 million such visits
nationally. All data on proportions of visits presented here are
based on these weighted estimates. Standard errors and 95%
confidence intervals for these proportions were computed
using formulas provided by the NCHS (ref. 12 and Shimizu I,
NCHS: personal communication). All statistical analyses were
performed using SAS programs (Statistical Analysis Systems,
Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Of the 1,074 sampled visits to rheumatologists,
21.1% were made by patients age 18­44 years, 36.7% by
patients age 45­64 years, and 42.1% by patients age 65
years or older. Seventy-two percent of visits were made
by females, and 90.7% by whites. Fifty-nine percent of
visits were made by patients with private medical insur-
ance (including 15.7% with prepaid insurance), 32% by
patients with public insurance, and 9% by patients
without medical insurance. New consultations com-
prised 12.3% of visits, and continuing patients accounted
for 87.7% of visits. Joint pain (not otherwise specified)
was the most common primary patient-reported reason
for the visit, for both new consultations (15.3%) and
continuing patients (17.9%). Four of the 10 most com-
mon primary reasons for new patient consultations and
for continuing patient visits were for pain in specific joint
areas, and "arthritis" was reported as the primary reason
for the visit by 7.5% of new and continuing patients. RA
(15.7% of new consultations, 24.4% of continuing visits)
and osteoarthritis (9.7% of new consultations, 10.3% of
continuing visits) were the most common principal diag-
noses reported by rheumatologists. Diagnostic or evalu-
ative tests were ordered at 95.5% of new consultations
and 90.2% of continuing visits. Medications were or-
dered at 83.1% of new visits and 90.3% of continuing
visits.
Among new consultations by rheumatologists,
22.0% of visits were by patients who did not report a
musculoskeletal complaint, and 19.9% of visits were by
patients who did not have a rheumatic disease diagnosis
(Table 1). Among continuing patients, these proportions
were 21.2% and 18.1%, respectively. Visits by patients

PRIMARY CARE IN RHEUMATOLOGY PRACTICE 411
with neither a musculoskeletal complaint nor a rheu-
matic disease diagnosis (which most likely represent
primary care visits) comprised 9.8% of new consulta-
tions and 11.9% of continuing visits. Compared with
other medical subspecialists, rheumatologists had
among the lowest proportion of primary care visits.
These findings indicate that physicians in other medical
subspecialties are more likely to see patients with con-
ditions outside of their specialty than are rheumatolo-
gists, whose practice is largely restricted to patients with
rheumatic conditions.
To assess the provision of principal care by
rheumatologists, the presenting complaints of continu-
ing patients with RA were examined. In 90.1% of visits
(95% confidence interval [95% CI] 83.7­96.5%), the
patient's principal reason for the visit was a musculo-
skeletal complaint. Diffuse joint pain was the single most
common reason for the visit (41.8%), while "arthritis"
was the reported reason for the visit in 13.0%. In only
9.9% of visits (95% CI 3.5­16.3%) was the primary
reason for the visit not a musculoskeletal complaint. A
nonrheumatic complaint was recorded as any of the 3
potential reasons for the visit in 30.4% of visits (95% CI
20.5­40.3%), indicating that other health concerns were
raised in only a minority of visits. In 31.1% of visits (95%
CI 20.6­41.6%) a nonrheumatic medication was or-
dered, indicating that rheumatologists were acting as
principal care providers for a minority of continuing
patients with RA. Classification of medications for the
treatment of osteoporosis and peptic ulcer disease as
nonrheumatic medications increased the proportion of
visits at which a nonrheumatic medication was pre-
scribed to 41.0% (95% CI 29.9­52.1%). Seventy-two
percent of rheumatologists prescribed nonrheumatic
medications to continuing patients with RA on at least 1
visit, but only 12.5% of rheumatologists prescribed non-
rheumatic medications on more than half of patient
visits.
Provision of preventive care and counseling is
another indicator of the degree to which rheumatolo-
gists were providing principal care to continuing patients
with RA. Compared with visits to generalist physicians,
visits by patients with RA to rheumatologists were
significantly less likely to include counseling on choles-
terol and weight reduction (Table 2). For example, visits
to rheumatologists were only 56% as likely to include
counseling on weight reduction as were visits to gener-
alist physicians. Counseling on diet, smoking cessation,
and exercise did not differ significantly between these
provider groups.
DISCUSSION
The findings of this study indicate that most of
the work of rheumatologists is focused on providing care
to patients with rheumatic complaints. Only about 10%
of visits to rheumatologists involved patients with nei-
ther a musculoskeletal complaint nor a rheumatic dis-
ease diagnosis. Such visits for conditions or concerns
outside the rheumatologists' area of specialty expertise
most likely represent visits for primary care. The pro-
portion of primary care visits in this study was closely
comparable with the proportion of primary care visits
reported in a recent survey of ACR members (6%). In
earlier surveys that indicated much higher proportions
of primary care visits to rheumatologists, the estimates
may have been inflated due to the instruments' record-
ing of only whether the principal diagnosis was of a
rheumatic disease rather than also noting secondary or
tertiary diagnoses, and not considering patients' present-
ing complaints (9,10). Alternatively, changes in referral
patterns and health care practices over the last 20 years
may have also decreased the proportion of patients
without rheumatic complaints who are seen by rheuma-
tologists.
Principal care appeared to be practiced more
commonly than primary care. Based on both the patient-
reported reasons for the visit and the provision of

nonrheumatic medications, 30% of continuing pa-
tients with RA appeared to be receiving some portion of
their primary care from their rheumatologist. This esti-
mate is intermediate in relation to 2 previously reported
estimates of the proportion of principal care provided by
rheumatologists (8,14), but the operational definitions
of principal care differed between these studies. Aiken
and colleagues reported that 52.9% of visits to rheuma-
tologists involved principal care, which the authors de-
fined as visits by continuing patients for whom the
rheumatologist reported providing the majority of the
patient's care (8). A recent study of visits by Medicare
beneficiaries to 57 rheumatologists in Washington state
found 19.2% of visits to be for problems other than
rheumatic diseases (14). Neither report stated whether
the patients seen by rheumatologists had any rheumatic
disease or musculoskeletal complaint, and therefore
they did not precisely distinguish whether these visits
involved principal care by rheumatologists to their pa-
tients with rheumatic conditions, or primary care.
Continuity, comprehensiveness, and preventive
care are among the major hallmarks of primary care
(15), and are also the hallmarks of principal care. In this
study of principal care, the analysis was restricted to
continuing patients with RA, thereby ensuring the re-
quirement for continuity. Although the main assessment
of principal care was based on the comprehensiveness of
care provided these patients as determined by examining
the types of patient complaints noted and treated, the
provision of preventive care to this subgroup was also
examined. Counseling on cholesterol levels and weight
control was less commonly provided on visits by RA
patients to rheumatologists than on visits by other
patients to generalist physicians, in analyses that in-
cluded adjustment for group differences in age, sex, and
race. While patients with RA may be less in need of such
services, it may also be that rheumatologists were less
likely to provide these services because they did not see
themselves as the principal care provider for most of
these patients. These results support the view that
rheumatologists provide principal care to only a portion
of their continuing patients with RA.
The strengths of this study are its large size and
nationally representative sample, and the availability of
data not only on physician diagnoses, but also on pa-
tients' presenting complaints and treatment. However,
this study is limited, as are most previous studies of this
topic (8,9,14), by the need to infer the provision of
primary care and principal care from the nature of the
conditions reported and treated, rather than assessing
them in a more direct way. It was also not possible to
distinguish whether principal care was provided as a
result of an explicitly established relationship between
the patient and his or her rheumatologist, or whether
this care was of a more incidental nature. The finding
that many rheumatologists prescribed nonrheumatic
medications, but that they did so infrequently, suggests
that most of the primary care they performed was
incidental. Knowing the extent of dedicated principal
care relationships between patients and their rheuma-
tologists would be more important than knowing the
extent of incidental primary care provided by rheuma-
tologists.
Because the survey sampled only single patient-
physician encounters, the range of providers who treated
each patient (information that might have corroborated
whether rheumatologists were the primary or principal
caregivers for individual patients) also could not be
examined. The sample size did not permit adequate
study of the relationship between the patient's type of
medical insurance and receipt of principal care. Infor-
mation on the work setting of the physicians, which
might have influenced their propensity to provide pri-
mary care or principal care, was not available.
Most of the work of rheumatologists is within the
domain of their subspecialty, and little of their work is
devoted to providing exclusively primary care. Although
evidence of principal care relationships between rheu-
matologists and patients with RA exists, these relation-
ships are not widespread, and may more often represent
care for incidental problems rather than dedicated prin-
cipal care relationships. Additional research is needed to
determine if patients who receive principal care from
specialists have comparable or better health outcomes at
lower costs than patients who see both specialists and
primary care physicians. While adoption of this ap-
proach to patient care would not be difficult and may be
clinically effective and cost effective (11), doing so would
involve a change in the current nature of rheumatology
practice.
