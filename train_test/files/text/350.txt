The role of inorganic arsenic exposure in chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, is
a major public health research question. This has been underscored by recent
epidemiologic1­4 and experimental5­8 evidence supporting increased risks at low expo-
sure levels. In this context, it is critical to understand the biology and the technical
limitations of biomarkers of inorganic arsenic exposure, usually measured in urine.9­11
Total urine arsenic integrates exposure from multiple sources including inorganic (arsen-
ite, arsenate) and organic (mainly arsenobetaine, arsenosugars, and arsenolipids)
arsenic compounds and their metabolites (Fig. 1). In population-based studies, arsenic
speciation in urine is important to differentiate inorganic from organic exposure
because organic arsenicals, mostly found in seafood, have little toxicity relative to
inorganic arsenic and its metabolites. Despite analytic advances in the measurement
of arsenosugars, arsenolipids, and their metabolites,9 their determination remains
technically challenging in epidemiologic studies. For example, those compounds were
not measured in the 2003­2004 National Health Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES). Moreover, because arsenite, arsenate, and methylarsonate--species that
directly reflect inorganic arsenic exposure and metabolism (Fig. 1)--were measured in
NHANES 2003­2004 with high limits of detection,9,12­14 only total arsenic, dimethy-
larsinate, arsenobetaine and arsenocholine (a minor seafood arsenical) were available
for analyses of arsenic and health end points.
To evaluate the association of inorganic arsenic exposure with the prevalence of
type 2 diabetes in NHANES 2003­2004,2 we reported 2 main strategies to remove the
contribution of organic arsenicals of marine origin to total urine arsenic. First, we
conducted analyses of the association between total urine arsenic and the prevalence
of type 2 diabetes adjusted for sociodemographic factors, diabetes risk factors, and 2
markers of seafood intake (urine arsenobetaine and blood mercury). More importantly,
we reported analyses of the association between total urine arsenic and the prevalence
of type 2 diabetes adjusted only for sociodemographic and diabetes risk factors but
restricted to participants with low arsenobetaine levels (ie, participants with unlikely
seafood intake, in whom urine arsenic would be derived mainly from inorganic
arsenic). The magnitude of the association in this subgroup was similar to the analysis

adjusting for urine arsenobetaine and blood mercury, dem-
onstrating that the association between arsenic and type 2
diabetes identified in the whole sample was driven by
inorganic arsenic exposure and was not dependent on the
statistical method used to control for organic arsenicals of
marine origin.
In a reanalysis of the association between arsenic ex-
posure and diabetes in NHANES 2003­2004 published in this
issue of EPIDEMIOLOGY, Steinmaus et al15 used total urine
arsenic minus urine arsenobetaine and urine arsenocholine (in
13 individuals in whom it was detected) as an "estimate of
inorganic arsenic exposure," in an attempt to remove the
contribution of organic arsenicals of marine origin to total
urine arsenic. Total urine arsenic minus arsenobetaine and
arsenocholine, however, is an inadequate estimate of inor-
ganic arsenic exposure because it does not remove other
unmeasured organic arsenicals and their metabolites derived
from seafood. Indeed, the correlation between arsenobetaine
and total urine arsenic minus arsenobetaine and arsenocholine
in NHANES 2003­2004 remained moderately strong (r 
0.51, Fig. 2). In their Discussion, the authors indicated that
after subtracting arsenobetaine and arsenocholine from
total arsenic, 24% of the variance in the remaining arsenic
was still explained by arsenobetaine "probably due to
some dimethylarsinate and some other arsenosugars that
are present in the same seafoods that contain arsenobe-
taine."15 The magnitude of the misclassification induced
when estimating inorganic arsenic by total urine arsenic
minus arsenobetaine and arsenocholine in the NHANES
sample can be further appreciated by comparing the dis-
tribution of total arsenic minus arsenobetaine and arseno-
choline (20th, 50th, 80th, 90th, and 99th percentiles of 2.7,
6.0, 11.9, 18.4, and 73.6 g/L, respectively) with the
distribution of total urine arsenic among participants with
undetectable (0.4 g/L) urine arsenobetaine (20th, 50th,
80th, 90th, and 99th percentiles of 1.9, 3.9, 7.7, 11.8, and
30.4 g/L, respectively). As a consequence, any analysis
that uses total urine arsenic minus arsenobetaine and
arsenocholine as an estimate of inorganic arsenic exposure
still needs to adjust for markers of seafood intake, such as
arsenobetaine itself. Furthermore, the misclassification in-
duced by using total urine arsenic minus arsenobetaine and
arsenocholine as an index of inorganic arsenic exposure is
aggravated in categorical analyses, for example, quintiles.
Many participants in the highest quintile (80th percen-
tile) of total urine arsenic minus arsenobetaine and arseno-
choline in NHANES 2003­2004 were exposed to substan-
tial amounts of organic arsenic compounds from seafood,
and categorization in this situation could reduce the effi-
cacy of statistical adjustment for seafood intake in multi-
variable models.
Given the longstanding experience of Steinmaus et al
in investigating the health effects of arsenic, it is difficult
to understand why the authors used total urine arsenic
minus arsenobetaine and arsenocholine as an estimate of
inorganic arsenic exposure without controlling for seafood
intake in their main analyses and conclusions. Indeed,
when controlling for seafood intake, Steinmaus et al re-

sonate (MA), and arsenocholine were below the limit of de-
tection in 96%, 94%, 65%, and 98% of study participants,
respectively. Other metabolites of arsenosugars and arsenolip-
ids (thio-arsenic and oxo-arsenic compounds, etc.) were not
measured. As a result, only total arsenic, dimethylarsinate
(DMA), and arsenobetaine were available for arsenic analyses
in NHANES 2003­2004.

of their manuscript.)
UPDATED ANALYSIS IN NHANES 2003­2006
Since the publication of our study using NHANES
2003­2004 data,2 new urine arsenic data has become
available for NHANES 2005­2006. Sampling and labora-
tory methods (including limits of detection for arsenic
species) are consistent with NHANES 2003­2004, so that
4 years of data can be combined to evaluate the association
between arsenic exposure and the prevalence of type 2
diabetes in US adults. Using NHANES 2003­2006, we
have thus updated our original analysis, adding total ar-
senic minus arsenobetaine and arsenocholine as an expo-
sure variable. The exclusion criteria and end point defini-
tion were similar to those in our original paper,2 except for
participants missing glycosylated hemoglobin (an end
point not used here). A total of 1279 participants (160 with
diabetes) aged 20 years or older were included. Statistical
analyses were performed as described previously, taking
into account the complex NHANES sampling design and
specific weights for arsenic analyses, as recommended by
the National Center for Health Statistics.
Median (interquartile range) urine concentrations for
total arsenic, total arsenic minus arsenobetaine and arseno-
choline (in 21 participants with detectable concentrations),
and arsenobetaine were 7.4 (4.0, 14.6) g/L, 5.4 (3.0, 9.7)
g/L, and 1.0 (0.3, 4.0) g/L, respectively. Among study
participants with undetectable (0.4 g/L) arsenobetaine
concentrations (n  381), the median (interquartile range)
total urine arsenic concentration was 3.6 (2.0, 6.6) g/L.
Total arsenic was highly correlated with arsenobetaine
(r  0.78). Total arsenic minus arsenobetaine and arseno-
choline also showed a moderately strong correlation with
arsenobetaine (r  0.50), confirming again that subtracting
arsenobetaine is not sufficient to eliminate the contribution
of unmeasured organic arsenicals from total urine arsenic.
We conducted analyses of total arsenic (as in our
original study2) and total arsenic minus arsenobetaine and
arsenocholine (as in Steinmaus et al15), progressively ad-
justing for markers of seafood intake (urine arsenobetaine
and blood mercury). The findings (Table) were similar to
our original analyses. In the categorical analyses, the
highest quintiles of total urine arsenic and total arsenic
minus arsenobetaine and arsenocholine were not clearly
associated with an increased risk of diabetes because,
rather than high inorganic arsenic, these quintiles mostly
included participants with high intakes of organic arsenic
compounds from seafood that are difficult to control for in
the analysis. The percentage of subjects with undetectable

urine arsenobetaine levels decreased markedly from 57%
in the lowest quintile to 12% in the highest quintile of total
arsenic minus arsenobetaine and arsenocholine.
Restricting the analysis to participants with undetect-
able arsenobetaine concentrations, and adjusting only for
sociodemographic and diabetes risk factors, participants
with diabetes had 28% (95% confidence interval: 7%­
53%) higher total arsenic concentrations compared with
participants without diabetes, and the odds ratio for dia-
betes comparing participants at the 80th versus the 20th
percentiles of total urine arsenic (7.4 vs. 1.6 g/L) was
2.60 (95% CI  1.12­6.03) (Table). These analyses were
not adjusted for arsenobetaine, ruling out collinearity as an
explanation of our findings. The corresponding odds ratio
for diabetes comparing the highest versus the lowest quin-
tiles (80th vs. 20th percentile) of total urine arsenic in
this subgroup was 4.26 (0.83­21.8) (Table). This odds
ratio directly estimates the association between exposure
to inorganic arsenic and the prevalence of diabetes without
assuming a linear dose-response relationship.
In summary, when adequately controlling for mark-
ers of seafood intake, our original analysis2 and those of
Steinmaus et al15 of NHANES 2003­2004 resulted in
similar conclusions. Furthermore, updated findings in
NHANES 2003­2006, presented here, confirm that inor-
ganic arsenic is associated with the prevalence of diabetes
in US adults and rule out collinearity as an explanation to
our findings. As we indicated in our original paper, these
findings are inherently limited by the cross-sectional na-
ture of NHANES data. Prospective evidence in popula-
tions exposed to a wide range of arsenic exposure levels,
including arsenic in drinking water 50 g/L and other
sources, is clearly needed. We also recognized that the use
of spot urine samples and the need to account for urine
dilution are limitations of our data common to many
epidemiologic studies, and that single urine arsenic mea-
sures may not reflect long-term arsenic exposure.
From the perspectives of both science and public
health, there can be no question about the need to evaluate
the impact of inorganic arsenic exposure on diabetes de-
velopment at low to moderate exposure levels (and not
only at arsenic levels in drinking water from 50 to 200
g/L, as Steinmaus et al indicate). First, evidence linking
arsenic with diabetes end points in populations exposed to
low1 and moderate16 levels is already available. Second,
increasing experimental evidence supports several diabe-
togenic mechanisms of arsenic.5,6 Third, low to moderate
arsenic exposure levels are widespread, affecting most
populations worldwide. Inorganic arsenic is an established
carcinogen and a high priority contaminant for screening
in drinking water sources.17 Although 10 g/L is the current
safety standard for arsenic levels in drinking water in most
countries, the World Health Organization indicated that 10
g/L is a provisional standard because many uncertainties
remain at low exposure levels, in particular for noncancer end
points.17,18 Evaluating these health effects of low to moderate
arsenic exposure is a public health priority. Knowledgeable
use of biomarkers of arsenic exposure,10,11 high quality
laboratory methods with adequate limits of detection,19­21
high-quality prospective epidemiologic designs, and adequate
statistical analysis techniques are needed to evaluate the
impact of low to moderate inorganic arsenic exposure on
cardiovascular disease and diabetes risk.
