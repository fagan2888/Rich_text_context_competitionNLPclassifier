Growing Internet Use May Help
Explain The Rise In Prescription
Drug Abuse In The United States
ABSTRACT The rising availability through the Internet of commonly
abused prescription drugs has raised public health concerns. We
examined whether the growth of US prescription drug abuse may be
explained by the parallel growth in high-speed Internet use. We find that
for every 10 percent increase in high-speed Internet use at the state level,
associated treatment facility admissions for prescription drug abuse rose
by 1 percent. Admissions for abuse of alcohol, cocaine, and heroin, which
are not readily purchased online, had minimal or negative growth during
the same period. The results suggest that better surveillance of online
prescription drug sales is warranted, and aggressive efforts to curb
illegitimate online pharmacies may be necessary.
Online pharmacies have grown tre-
mendously in recent years. From
1999 to 2003 alone, US online
sales of prescription drugs in-
creased from $160 million to
$3.2 billion.1 Although the growth of legitimate
online pharmacies has benefited patients
through lower costs and added convenience, im-
portant concerns have been raised about the
growth in illegitimate Internet pharmacies that
promote unfettered access to both ordinary pre-
scriptionmedicationsand controlleddrugswith-
out any direct physician examination and some-
times without physician approval.1­7
Several studies have offered evidence that the
dramatic increase in US admissions to treatment
facilitiesfor abuse of prescription drugs--includ-
ing a nearly fivefold increase from 1997 to 2007
in admissions for abuse of narcotic painkillers8--
may partially stem from wider online availability
of these drugs.9,10
Although the majority of online pharmacies
operate no differently than standard brick-and-
mortar pharmacies that rely on prescriptions
originating from actual doctor-patient inter-
actions, a growing number of illegitimate phar-
macies have emerged that do not abide by these
safeguards.2,6,11 Illegitimate pharmacies have
taken on two forms, neither of which require a
patient to visit a doctor or other practitioner in
advance to obtain a prescription: "questionnaire
pharmacies," which require users only to com-
plete an online questionnaire before medication
is dispensed, and "rogue pharmacies," which
require neither a prescription from a physician
or other practitioner in advance nor the provi-
sion of a medical history.
In 2007 the National Center on Addiction and
Substance Abuse at Columbia University esti-
mated that 581 websites offered to sell controlled
prescription drugs; only two of the pharmacies
were legitimately certified by the National Asso-
ciation of Boards of Pharmacy.12 Nearly 85 per-
cent of the websites did not require a prescrip-
tion, and of the remaining sites, 57 percent
required only that a prescription be faxed, which
made it possible for customers to forge prescrip-
tions or use the same prescription multiple
times.12
Responding to concerns about the rising avail-
ability of controlled prescription drugs on the
Internet, in 2008 the federal government
enacted the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Con-
sumer Protection Act. The law, which was named

for Ryan Haight, who died in 2001 at the age of
eighteen after overdosing on prescription nar-
cotics purchased online, went into effect in April
2009. It amended the existing Controlled Sub-
stances Act of 1970 by prohibiting the delivery,
distribution, and dispensing of controlled pre-
scription drugs over the Internet without a pre-
scription from a physician who interviewed and
examined the patient in person.13
Months later, in November 2009, the Food
and Drug Administration issued warnings to
more than 100 online pharmacies for prescrib-
ing violations that included the sale of controlled
drugs without prescriptions and, in some instan-
ces, the sale of medications not yet approved for
distribution. An example was the antiobesity
medication Acomplia.14
Despite the growing presence of illegitimate
pharmacies on the Internet and federal regula-
tions seeking to curb them, relatively little is
known about rates of prescription drug abuse
originating from these pharmacies and, more
important, whether the observed increase in
overall prescription drug abuse may partially
stem from wider online availability. Survey evi-
dence from small, locally conducted samples, as
well as national samples of prescription drug
abusers, estimate that between 1 percent and
11 percent of controlled prescription drug abus-
ers purchased their medications online. Most
surveys attribute approximately 3 percent of
use to online purchases.15,16
Surveys may underestimate the prevalence of
Internet-based prescription drug abuse. People
most likely to purchase controlled prescription
drugs online may not have been included in sur-
veys because of where those surveys were con-
ducted. For example, surveys of patients at meth-
adone clinics may yield a downward-biased
estimate of online prescription drug purchasing
because Schedule II drugs such as methadone are
more difficult to acquire online than drugs in
Schedule IV such as zolpidem (Ambien).16 Con-
trolled substance schedules are generally de-
fined by the potential for abuse; higher sched-
ules (III and IV) consist of drugs with lower
potential for abuse. As another example, surveys
will naturally not include those involved in the
illegal street distribution of controlled prescrip-
tion drugs.
The National Drug Intelligence Center at the
Department of Justice reports that large
amounts of Schedule III and IV medications
are purchased through the Internet by local drug
dealers. The center also reports increasing
involvement of street and motorcycle gangs in
the distribution of controlled prescription drugs
acquired online.16,17 Wider availability of con-
trolled prescription drugs on the Internet may
therefore affect rates of abuse not only through
individuals purchasing drugs but also through
organized purchasing and local distribution.
In addition to the limited survey evidence on
abuse of controlled prescription drugs acquired
through Internet pharmacies, other studies of
illegitimate online pharmacies have examined
the ease with which prescription drugs may be
obtained without valid prescriptions or doctor-
patient interactions. In each of these studies,
including a 2004 study by the Government Ac-
countability Office,4 research investigators at-
tempted to purchase controlled prescription
drugs online and demonstrated readily available
access to commonly abused prescription drugs
such as narcotic pain killers, stimulants, sedative
hypnotics, and anxiolytics (drugs for treating
anxiety).17,18
The extensive availability of commonly abused
prescription drugs on the Internet raises the pos-
sibility that widespread Internet growth may it-
self have contributed to the observed trend in
prescription drug abuse. During the period
2000­07 admissions to substance abuse facili-
ties for nonheroin narcotics such as oxycodone
increased 374 percent, while admissions for al-
cohol abuse actually declined by 5 percent,8 sug-
gesting that general trends in substance abuse
behavior alone may not explain the growth in
narcotic painkiller abuse.
During this same period, Internet use grew. In
1997, 18 percent of US households had Internet
at home; by 2007 the number was 61 percent.19
Nearly half of those households were using the
Internet for purposes that included health care.20
Almost all of this growth in overall Internet use
stemmed from growth in high-speed access, and
only 4 percent of households in 2008 were using
dial-up modems.21
We explored whether overall growth in Inter-
net use may partly explain observed prescription
drug abuse growth in the United States. To gauge
this, we used state-level data on high-speed In-
ternet penetration and admissions to substance
abuse facilities for treatment of controlled pre-
scription drug abuse. Internet-based dispensing
of general prescription drugs increased nearly
fifteenfold from 1999 to 2003, due in large part
to widerInternetuse by consumers.1 By thissame
mechanism, growth in Internet use may have
plausibly led to the purchase and abuse of con-
trolled prescription drugs also available online.
Study Data And Methods
To test the hypothesis that increases in Internet
use have been partially responsible for recent
increases in prescription drug abuse rates, we
obtained annual state-level data on high-speed

Internet penetration and admissions to sub-
stance abuse facilities for prescription drug
abuse between 2000 and 2007. For each of four
classes of prescription drugs--narcotic pain-
killers, stimulants, anxiolytics, and sedative-
hypnotics--we estimated longitudinal linear re-
gression models in which the key explanatory
variable was high-speed Internet penetration
within a state and the dependent variables in-
cluded one of two measures of prescription drug
abuse: admission to a substance abuse treatment
facility and self-reported use.
To account for unobserved varying trends in
prescription drug abuse within states--for exam-
ple, changing attitudes toward substance abuse
or changing access to commonly abused drugs--
we accounted for fixed state characteristics and
state-specific trends through state indicators
and state-year trends, respectively.We conducted
additional "falsification tests" in which we re-
peated the analysis with the treatment facility
admission rate for abuse of either alcohol, co-
caine, or heroin. We assumed that Internet
growth could more plausibly be linked to pre-
scription drug abuse growth if it were also un-
associated with substance abuse growth among
substances not readily purchasable online.
Internet Use We measured Internet penetra-
tion across states using publicly available data
from the Federal Communications Commission
high-speed Internet deployment database. In
2000 the commission instituted a formal data-
collection program to gather information about
state-level subscriptions to high-speed Internet
services.22 Among other information, Internet
service providers were required to report the
number of high-speed Internet lines (defined
as carrying more than 200 kilobits in one direc-
tion) to residential customers in each state.
Combining this information with intercensal
state population estimates from the Census Bu-
reau (provided each year with a reference date of
July 1), we calculated the number of residential
Internet lines per capita for each state and year
for the period 2000­07 and used this as our
estimate of state-level Internet use. Growth in
this use has been associated with state-level
growth in other major online markets, including
online dating and pornography.23,24
Rates Of Prescription Drug Abuse Annual,
state-level estimates of prescription drug abuse
are generally difficult to obtain. As a baseline
measure of prescription drug abuse, we used
data on treatment admissions to substance abuse
programs in the United States, which are pub-
licly available from the Treatment Episode Data
Set maintained by the Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Services Administration.8 The
data set consists of treatment admissions to pub-
lic and private substance abuse programs receiv-
ing public funding; the unit of observation is
treatment admission to a substance abuse fa-
cility.
Each observation contains information on the
substance abused, including alcohol, cocaine,
heroin, prescription opiates (including syn-
thetic opiates), benzodiazepines and other
anxiolytics, barbiturates and other sedative
hypnotics, and amphetamines and other stimu-
lants.We computed rates of substance abuse ad-
missions for each state and drug category by
dividing the total number of admissions within
a state by that state's population.
Although the Treatment Episode Data Set does
not contain all substance abuse admissions
within a state, available inclusion rates suggest
that facilities in the data set account for nearly
70 percent of total known admissions.8 Although
comparisons across states are limited by differ-
ences in the extent to which substance abuse
admissions are recorded in the data set, compar-
isons within states over time are less subject to
this measurement error.
It is possible that changing treatment environ-
ments in substance abuse facilities over time may
lead to spurious associations between state-level
growth in Internet use and measured prescrip-
tion drug abuse. For example, if over time treat-
ment facilities located in states with large growth
in Internet use more frequently admitted pa-
tients abusing prescription drugs because of bet-
ter insurance reimbursement or public funding
for prescription drug abuse, we would falsely
attribute changes in substance abuse admissions
for prescription drugs to Internet growth.
Although the inclusion of separate state-year
trends in our regression model would presum-
ably account for these unobserved factors,
changing treatment patterns that remain corre-
lated with state-level Internet growth are
possible.
In addition to our baseline measure of pre-
scription drug abuse, we explored other options
for measuring prescription drug abuse at the
state level. The Drug Abuse Warning Network
collects data on emergency department visits
for a number of prescription drug classes but
continually collected information for only
thirteen cities during the period 2000­07.25
Although a time-series of Internet use at the city
level was not readily available to us, the cities for
which we had data on emergency department
visits were also large metropolitan centers that
probably varied little in Internet growth.
We also explored the possibility of computing
state-level inpatient hospital admission rates for
abuse of prescription drugs using the National
Inpatient Sample, an approximately 20 percent

sample of all US hospital admissions.26 Admin-
istrative coding of hospital discharge data did
not allow us, however, to specifically identify
admissions for prescription drug abuse.
As a second measure of state-level prescription
drug abuse, we ultimately relied on state esti-
mates of narcotic painkiller and cocaine abuse
self-reported by respondents of the National Sur-
vey of Drug Use and Health. This annual, cross-
sectional survey gathers information on rates of
substance abuse among the US noninstitution-
alized population age twelve and older.15 We fo-
cused on reported state-level estimates of nar-
cotic painkiller and cocaine abuse as only
these drugs had annual data available for each
state during the period 2002­05 (but not the full
2000­07 period for which substance abuse treat-
ment admission data were available).
Statistical Analysis In our baseline model,
we estimated longitudinal linear regressions of
the association between high-speed Internet use
and admissions to substance abuse treatment
facilities for each of several prescription drug
abuse categories: nonheroin opioids (includ-
ing synthetics), benzodiazepines, sedative hyp-
notics, and stimulants (including amphet-
amine).
For each drug in question, the dependent var-
iable was the natural log of the substance abuse
rate in state s in year t, and the key explanatory
variable was the natural log of high-speed Inter-
net lines per capita in state s in year t. In order to
account for unobserved fixed state characteris-
tics and trends over time, we included both state-
level fixed effects and state-specific year trends.
To validate our model, we also conducted sepa-
rate "falsification tests," in which we replaced
the dependent variable with treatment facility
admission rates for abuse of alcohol, heroin,
and cocaine separately.
Because none of these substances are known
to be readily purchasable online, the absence of
any relationship between Internet use and abuse
rates of these substances would further suggest
that any observed relationship between Internet
use and prescription drug abuse might be causal.
To account for changing demographics not cap-
tured in state-year trends, all models included
controls for the percentage of the population
in each state and year that was male, and the
percentage younger than age thirty.
Sensitivity Analyses As an additional sensi-
tivity analysis to our baseline model, we ac-
counted for other factors that may be associated
with changes in prescription drug abuse rates
over time. Because states with greater high-
speed Internet growth may also have experi-
enced greater legal prescriptions for commonly
abused substances, we accounted for the overall
prescribing environment in a given state and
year by including as a covariate the number of
prescriptions per Medicaid beneficiary of each
drug we considered.27 In addition to changes in
legal prescribing behavior, coincident increases
in criminal enforcement for heroin and cocaine
use and trafficking may have occurred in states
that experienced high-speed Internet growth.We
therefore included a covariate of drug arrest
rates (as a percentage of total arrests in a given
state and year) obtained from the National Con-
sortium on Violence Research, which itself com-
puted rates from Federal Bureau of Investigation
Uniform Crime Reports.28
Asa final sensitivityanalysis, in additionto our
baseline model, which used state treatment fa-
cility admission rates as a measure of substance
abuse, we also estimated the association between
self-reported state cocaine and narcotic pain-
killer abuse rates and high-speed Internet use.
Because ourdataspannedonly fouryears (2002­
05), our longitudinal linear regression model
used state fixed effects (rather than state-year
trends) and controlled for state Medicaid pre-
scription rates for narcotic painkillers as well
as state drug arrest rates.
Study Results
Exhibit 1 displays growth in per capita rates of
high-speed Internet access and admissions to
substance abuse treatment facilities in the
United States in the period 2000­07. During that
time, high-speed Internet access in the United
States increased from 1,816 residential lines per
100,000 people to 24,674 lines per 100,000.
There was significant variation in growth across
states, with the bottom five states (Massachu-
setts, Nebraska, New Hampshire, California,
and Rhode Island) growing substantially more
slowly during the seven-year period than the
top five states (Montana, Maryland, Indiana,
Kentucky, and Delaware)--734 percent versus
5,232 percent, p < 0:001. Admissions to sub-
stance abuse treatment facilities for prescription
drugs grew dramatically during this period. Ad-
missions for abuse of nonheroin opioids grew
184 percent, followed by benzodiazepines, stim-
ulants, and sedative hypnotics. Importantly, sub-
stancesof abusenot readily purchasable online--
alcohol, heroin, and cocaine--all witnessed
either negative or minimal growth during this
same period.

tion narcotic abuse varied with growth in state
Internet use. The figure arrays state ranks in
order of increasing Internet growth (the lowest
being Massachusetts, and the highest Delaware)

substance abuse treatment admissions for nar-
cotics during that same time (a list of states in
their rank order and a graph showing the same
relation between growth in Internet use and al-
cohol related admissions are available in an on-
line Appendix to this paper).29 This provides the
conceptual basis of our estimation model, which
examines other substance abuse categories
as well.
This exhibit demonstrates that states with
larger high-speed Internet growth during
2000­07 also experienced greater growth in sub-
stance abuse admissions for prescribed narcot-
ics. A fitted regression line demonstrates that for
each 10 percent increase in high-speed Internet
use within a state between 2000 and 2007, there
was an associated 0.3 percent increase in pre-
scribed narcotic abuse admissions (p ¼ 0:04).
During the same period, fitted estimates suggest
that for each 10 percent increase in Internet use
within a state, there was virtually no change in
alcohol abuse admissions (0.01 percent,
p ¼ 0:74) (Appendix Exhibit 2).29

presents estimated coefficients from our base-
line substance-specific longitudinal regression

models. For each substance-specific model, we
accounted for state fixed effects and state-
specific trends.
Growth in Internet use across states was nei-
ther practically nor statistically significantly cor-
related with growth in abuse of substances not
readily purchasable online: alcohol, cocaine, or
heroin. Forexample,ourestimates suggest that a
10 percent increase in Internet use was associ-
ated with only a 0.18 percent increase in treat-
ment facility admissions for cocaine abuse
(p ¼ 0:51). At the same time, growth in Internet
use across states was significantly correlated
with growth in three out of four substances
known to be readily purchasable online, namely
prescription opioids, sedative hypnotics, and
stimulants. Estimated associations were similar
in magnitude: a given 10 percent increase in
Internet use was associated with a roughly 1 per-
cent increase in treatment facility admission
rates for these three prescription drugs.
We explored how accounting for legal pre-
scription rates of commonly abused prescription
drugs and drug arrests within a state affected the
estimated association between state high-speed
Internet use and admissions to treatment facili-
ties (Exhibit 4, left side). After we controlled for
both of these factors as well as state fixed effects
and state-specific time trends, growth in Internet
use across states was still significantly correlated
with growth in prescription narcotics, sedative
hypnotics, and stimulants. For each 10 percent
increase in Internet use, treatment facility ad-
mission rates for these three drugs continued
to rise by roughly 1 percent.
We found similar results when focusing on
self-reported cocaine and prescription narcotic
use as opposed to treatment facility admission
rates (Exhibit 4, right side). Accounting for state
fixed effects, legal prescription rates of narcot-
ics, and drug arrests within a state, a 10 percent
increase in state high-speed Internet use was
associated with a 0.06 percent change in self-
reported cocaine use (p ¼ 0:43) and a 0.43 per-
cent increase in prescription narcotic use
(p ¼ 0:02).

controlled substances without prescription on
the Internet, little is known about how prevalent
such purchasing is and whether the observed
increase in prescription drug abuse in the United
States could in part be linked to Internet-based
purchasing. Our analysis of the potential link
between online availability of commonly abused
prescription drugs and actual abuse was moti-
vated by the first-time treatment of a patient by
one of us (Jena) for tramadol (Ultram) toxicity
from extensive and prolonged Internet purchas-
ing of this synthetic opioid medication.
We hypothesized that given the availability of
commonly abused prescription drugs on the In-
ternet, growth in overall Internet use might ex-
plain some of the growth in prescription drug
abuse in the United States. Using the facts that
high-speed Internet growth has accounted for
nearly all of the recent growth in Internet use
and that nonprescription drugs should not have
been affected by this growth, we demonstrated
that states with greater high-speed Internet
growth had more growth in prescription drug
abuse but no detectable change in abuse of drugs
not readily purchasable online.
Our results were robust to adjustments for
unobserved state-specific factors that trended
linearly over time, as well as observed factors
such as legal prescription rates of commonly
abused prescription drugs and drug arrest rates.
Our results suggest that for every 10 percent in-
crease in state high-speed Internet use, associ-
ated admissions to substance abuse treatment
facilities for prescription drug abuse rose by
roughly 1 percent.
Our work is hypothesis generating: It raises
the possibility that the observed growth in US
prescription drug abuse may partially stem from
wider Internet availability through online phar-
macies that sell prescription drugs illegally.
There are, however, important limitations of
our analysis.
First, although we used falsification tests with
substances not readily purchasable online, our
results ultimately reflect an association that
might more convincingly be causal if there were
natural experiments to exploit. For example, had
there been variations in state laws or law enforce-
ment policies to shut down illegitimate online
pharmacies (there are no specific state laws of
which we are aware), one could explore whether
states with such laws experienced declines
in prescription drug abuse. More generally,
although we accounted for factors such as drug
arrests, legal prescription rates, and unobserved
state-specific factors that varied linearly over
time, unobserved state factors such as general
attitudes toward prescription drug abuse may
still confound our association.
Second, using administrative data such as sub-
stance abuse treatment facility admissions has
its own limitations. Changes in how data are
collected over time may lead us to spurious asso-
ciations simply because specific abused sub-
stances such as prescription drugs may have bet-
ter data recorded over time.
Third, prescription drug abuse and access to
the Internet are hard to define. Increases in treat-
ment rates may not necessarily reflect increases
in the prevalence of substance abuse, though we
do find such associations for the single case of
self-reported prescription drugs that we con-
sider, namely narcotics. Access to high-speed
Internet use within a state may be a poor proxy
for access to illegal online pharmacies, yet nearly
all of the recent growth in Internet use has been
driven by expansion of high-speed Internet ser-
vices and access to such sites by definition re-
quires access to Internet.
Despite these important limitations, our re-
sults suggest that better surveillance is war-
ranted to understand the extent to which pre-
scription drug abuse occurs due to drugs
purchased online, either by individuals or by
organized dealers who then distribute drugs lo-
cally. Our findings provide a first glimpse that
growing Internet use may partly explain why US
prescription drug abuse rates have risen
dramatically while other substance abuse rates
have not.
Based on our findings, recent efforts by the
Food and Drug Administration to shut down ille-
gitimate pharmacies not only seem warranted
but may also lead to substantial reductions in
prescription drug abuse. The success of these
efforts will, of course, depend not only on the
ability of the Food and Drug Administration to
serially monitor the emergence of new, rogue
Internet pharmacies but also on the agency's
ability to promptly shut down pharmacies by
coordinating with Internet service providers.
However, these efforts are complicated by the
emergence of international sites that ship
medications to the United States, creating com-
plicating jurisdictional and regulatory over-
sight.
