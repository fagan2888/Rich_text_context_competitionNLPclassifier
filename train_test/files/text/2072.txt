Previous studies have reported two SNPs and a haplotype marker within the Microsomal Transfer Protein
gene associated with extreme longevity. Here, we test this finding in a longitudinal study of nonagenarians
and in an association study. Participants in the Danish 1905 cohort study (1651 participants aged 92­93
years) were genotyped for the two SNPs (rs2866164 and Q95H) in the Microsomal Transfer Protein gene
recently reported to be associated with longevity. The 1905 Cohort has been followed for 6.5 years, during
which period 83% of the cohort has died. Furthermore, a group of 575 middle-aged Danish twins (mean
age 53.7 years) were tested as a younger control group. The risk haplotype had no significant survival
disadvantage (P-values: 0.56, 0.31 and 0.97 in the total population of nonagenarians, males and females,
respectively) after 6.5 years of follow-up. The distributions of the suggested risk alleles (rs2866164-G and
Q95) and the resulting haplotypes are very similar and not statistically different between the two age
cohorts. The frequency for rs2866164-G is in the middle-aged compared to the nonagenarians 25.4 and
23.6% in males and 23.0 and 26.1% in females. The frequency for the risk haplotype is in the middle-aged
compared to the nonagenarians 22.7 and 19.2% in males and 18.1 and 21.8% in females. In conclusion,
our longitudinal study of survival in the 10th decade of life and an association study in a genetically
homogeneous population provided no support for an association between the Microsomal Transfer
Protein gene and extreme longevity.

Introduction
Major efforts have been made for identifying genes
involved in ageing. An increasing number of studies are
reporting genes influencing human longevity including
cytochrome P450 genes, mitochondrial DNA and genes
involved in lipoprotein metabolism and coagulation.1
However, only the Apolipoprotein E gene has consistently
been associated with age-related changes in frequency.2 ­ 4
Recent studies performed a genome-wide linkage scan in
long-lived individuals and provided evidence for a locus for
longevity at chromosome 4 near microsatellite marker
D4S1564.5,6 Fine mapping of the region identified Micro-
somal Triglyceride Transfer Protein (MTP) as the gene

responsible for the chromosome 4 linkage peak,7 although
a confirmatory study in a French population did not
confirm this observation.7 The two SNPs found to account
for the majority of the variation at the locus were
rs2866164Fa SNP in complete linkage disequilibrium
with rs1800591 (À493G/T), an MTP promoter mutation-
Fand MTP Q/HFa semiconservative mutation in exon 3
of MTP (glutamine to histidine at aminoacid 95).7 The
rs2866164-G allele and the haplotype composed of
rs2866164-G/MTP-Q95 were found to be significantly
underrepresented in long-lived individuals compared to a
group of younger controls.
MTP is essential for the assembly of apolipoprotein
B-containing lipoproteins by the liver and small intestine8
and lack of the protein leads to abetalipoproteinemia, a
rare genetic disorder characterized as an inability to
produce chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins.
MTP is a good candidate for a gene involved in human
longevity as its functions and critical position in lipo-
protein assembly resembles Apolipoprotein E, the most
extensively studied and consistently reproduced gene
affecting human longevity.3,4 Lipid-lowering therapy is
established as a proven intervention to reduce athero-
sclerosis and its complications. MTP is an investigational
target for a new generation of lipid-lowering drugs and has
reached trials in animal models.9
It is important to point out that the finding by Geesa-
man et al (2003) was not confirmed in the French data
reported in the same paper. Given this discrepancy, there is
a need for independent studies to confirm the reported
association between MTP and exceptional longevity using
large and well-defined samples and preferable longitudinal
studies. In the Danish 1905 cohort study, we assessed the
complete Danish 1905 cohort in 1998.10,11 In total, 2262
participated in the survey, which included an interview,
physical and cognitive tests, as well as collection of
biological material (1651 participants provided a DNA
sample). Hence, they were 92­93 years when they entered
the study and have been followed regarding mortality until
January 2005. We examined the two reported SNPs in the
complete Danish 1905 cohort study. If MTP does infact
play a role in human longevity, a longitudinal study of
nonagenariansFa population with a very high mortality
and 6.5 years of follow-upFshould be able to detect a
mortality difference. To rule out that a selection has taken
place before the age of 92 years, a younger control group of
575 middle-aged Danish twins (mean age 53.7 years) were
included.
Methods
The participants were selected from two major surveys
conducted by our group, the 1905 cohort, all Danes
born in 1905 (1651 DNA samples)10 ascertained in 1998
when they were 92­93 years and the study of Middle-Aged
Danish twins (MADT), a random sample of twin pairs
born between 1931 and 1952 (4171 DNA samples).12
These studies comprised a home-based 2-h multidimen-
sional interview and the sampling of DNA by means of a
finger prick or a cheek swab. All samples from the 1905
cohort (28.2% males) were included and 575 samples
(mean age 53.7 years, age range 45­67 years, 47.9%
males)Fonly one from each twin pairFwere chosen from
MADT.
Genotyping
DNA was isolated from cheek swabs and blood spots with
the use of QIAamps DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany). The
Taqman technology was used to genotype for the two
polymorphisms related to MTP. Primers and probes were
designed using Primer Expresss software (Applied Bio-
systems). Primers and probes used were rs2866164:
sense 50-GTTTAAACAAGAAATCTCAAACCATATCTAC-30,
antisense 50-CTTGTAAATATAGTATATTTACCATATCTTAGT
AAGTAAA-30, C-probe 50-FAM-CTGTTTACCAGACTGCTT,
G-probe 50-VIC-CTGTTTAGCAGACTGCT and MTP Q/H:
sense 50-CTTTCTGTTACTCCAGATGAAGGATGT-30, anti-
sense 50-TTTCCCATTATTTTAGATGGGCTTT-30, Q-probe
50-FAM-CTCTCCTCTCTGCTGATT, H-probe 50-VIC-CT
CTCCTCTGTGCTGATT. All probes contain minor groove
binder groups and a nonflourescent quencher attached to
their 30 ends. The real-time analyses were performed at the
ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System equipped with
the allelic discrimination module (software version 1.7;
Applied Biosystems). DNA was amplified in a total volume
of 10 ml containing 5 ml Taqman Universal Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems), 900 nM of each primer (DNA Tech-
nology), 200 nM of each probe (Applied Biosystems) and
B10 ng DNA at an annealing temperature of 601C and 40
PCR cycles. In total, 26 subjects from the 1905 cohort and
24 of the middle-aged twins could not be genotyped for
one or both polymorphisms due to a poor quality of DNA.
Only subjects that could be genotyped for both poly-
morphisms are used in the statistical analysis. Four subjects
gave unclear genotyping results for H95Q and exon three
in the MTP gene was sequenced. A missense mutation
under the probe, E98D, was found in these samples. Only
three of the expected four haplotypes were seen as
expected, since the rs2866164-C/H95 haplotype has not
previously been detected.
Statistical analyses
The participants were followed from the date of blood
sampling and until emigration, death or end of study
period (January 2005). Information on emigration or death
was retrieved from the Danish Central Population Register,
which is continuously updated. The Kaplan­Meier method
was used to plot cumulative survival curves. For the
survival analysis, the subjects were stratified by the

occurrence of the suggested risk haplotype composed of
the rs2866164-G and the Q95 allele.
The difference in distribution of the risk alleles/haplo-
type (rs2866164-G, MTP-Q95 and the haplotype composed
of rs2866164-G/MTP-Q95) between the two age cohorts
was tested with a critical ratio (Z) test, which calculates a
95% confidence interval of the difference between the two
populations and a two-sided P-value.13,14 Stata version 8
(Stata Corporation) and EpiCalc 2000 (version 1.02;
Gilmann and Myatt, Brixton, England) were used for
statistical analysis.
Results
The Kaplan­Meier cumulative survival curves for the
nonagenarian males and females are shown in Figures 1
and 2. Age is not a confounding factor as all participants
are born in 1905. There is no significant survival difference,
as tested by the logrank test, despite the large sample size
and although more than 83% deceased at the end of the
follow-up period; the P-values are 0.56, 0.31 and 0.97 in
the total population of nonagenarians, males and females,
respectively.
The genotyping results are shown in Tables 1­3. The
distribution is in Hardy­Weinberg equilibrium for both
SNPs and haplotypes in both age groups (PZ0.29). None of
the prevalence differences of the suggested risk alleles
(rs2866164-G and MTP Q95) and the combined risk
haplotype is significant on a 0.05 level (Tables 1­3).
Furthermore, there is no statistically different distribution
between the subjects from the 1905 cohort alive at the last
follow-up in January 2005 (6.5 years after recruitment) and
those who died before January 2005.
Discussion
In contrast with the previous publication in PNAS by
Geesaman et al,7 our data fail to provide evidence for a role
for MTP in human longevity. There is no increased
mortality among carriers of the `risk haplotype' composed
of the rs2866164-G and the Q95 allele in the longitudinal
study of 1651 nonagenarians and, furthermore, there is no
significant difference between the distribution of the two
SNPs and the `risk haplotype' in the two tested age cohorts.
The paper by Geesaman et al,7 included a confirmatory
study of a French centenarian cohort compared to younger
French controls. There was no significant difference in
allele frequencies with respect to the risk haplotype.
However, the risk haplotype was found to be out of

Hardy­Weinberg equilibrium with the other haplotypes in
the centenarians, but not in the controls. We find
frequencies in our middle-aged population very close to
the French control groupFthe frequency is 24.1% for
rs2866164-G compared to 26.4% in the French population
and for the `risk haplotype' the frequency is 20.1%
compared to 19.6%. The risk haplotype is in Hardy­
Weinberg equilibrium in our cohorts for both the indivi-
dual SNPs and the combined haplotypes.
One explanation for the discrepancy between the study
by Geesaman et al,7 and our data could be that the
American population is less homogeneous than ours. A
major problem in genetic association studies is the failure
to adequately match the genetic backgrounds of the cases
and controls, and in the study of Geesaman et al, the cases
and controls were born more than 50 years apart. The
Danish population is known to be genetically and
ethnically very homogeneous and therefore well suited
for association studies in different age groups. The middle-
aged twins were born and grew up in Denmark. Very little
immigration has taken place in Denmark in the years
between 1905 and 1960. The minimal immigration into
Denmark in the cohorts comprised by these surveys, the
high response rate in both surveys (63% in the 1905 cohort
study and 80% in the middle-aged twins) and the high
genetic homogeneity in the Danish population, minimize
population stratification as well as selection bias within the
population. Furthermore, we have the ability to conduct a
longitudinal study on nonagenarians as we have followed
the 1905 cohort for 6.5 years, which is not affected by any
population stratification. And the results all point in the
same directionFno haplotype-dependent mortality differ-
ence in the 1905 cohort and no significant difference in
frequency of the tested SNPs between the middle-aged
population and the 1905 cohort. However, although the
Danish population is very homogeneous, no cross-genera-
tional comparisons are necessarily immune from stratifica-
tion and it is therefore possibleFbut very unlikelyFthat
our results are false-negative due to stratification.
Our population is slightly younger than that of Geesa-
man et al.7 Their long-lived individuals had a mean age
of 100.8 years. Participants in our study population were
92­93 years when they entered the study and 99 years at
the end of follow-up - and intuitively this seems to be an
already much selected population, close to becoming
centenarians. However, being 92­93 is only `half way to
becoming a centenarian' in terms of selection: only about
one in 20 of the 1905 cohort made it of age 92­93, but it is
also only about one in 20 of these survivors to age 92­93
who will celebrate a 100-year birthday. Hence, the Danish
1905 cohort provides a powerful opportunity to test for
selection against a genotype marker and even though our
cases are slightly younger, this large study of 1651 subjects
aged 92­93 years should be able to detect a significant
difference. As can be seen from Figures 1 and 2, there is no
significant survival difference between those carrying the
suggested risk allele and those without this allele. In males
there is even a smallFnot significantFtendency to a
better survival of those homozygous for the suggested risk
allele.
The finding of the linkage to exceptional longevity at
chromosome 4 near the MTP gene was the result of a
genome-wide scan in 308 extremely long-lived individuals
in 137 sib ships with the use of non-parametric linkage
analysis.5 Longevity is a complex trait and is probably
modulated by multiple genes. Our group has previously
shown that mapping a rare dominant genetic variation
that reduces hazard of death by half with the use of
nonparametric linkage analysis would require a sample of
more than 600 long-lived pairs15 to ensure acceptable
power. In the case of localization of recessive genes, the
power is larger and the method is able to localize recessive
genes with relatively small effects with the same sample
size (600 pairs). So although the power issue may depend
heavily on the true genetic nature in maintaining survival,
the results from small-scale sib-pair investigations, such as
the study of Puca et al, 5 should be interpreted with caution
and should be subject to independent replications. Statis-

tical evidence for an association between an allele and a
phenotype theoretically comes from three different situa-
tions, the allele itself might be functional, the allele may be
correlated with a causative gene nearby or the association
is attributable to chance.16 Population stratification can
induce important bias, but the original study by Geesaman
et al,7 used proactive matching of cases and controls to
protect against stratification-induced false positives, so it is
unlikely that population stratification is in fact the source
of the discrepancy. The results from Geesaman could be
caused by random chanceFsimply a false-positive fluctua-
tionFalthough true population genetic differences or
gene­environment differences between the two popula-
tions cannot be ruled out.
To conclude, a previous study7 reported a haplotype
marker within the MTP gene as a modifier of human
lifespan, but our confirmatory study does not support an
association between extreme longevity and the Microso-
mal Transfer Protein. Replication studies are crucial to cope
with the false positive results in mapping human complex
trait genes. The fact that our results, based on a large and
well-defined sample, fail to confirm the association
between the MTP gene and longevity reported by Geesa-
man et al illustrates the necessity of replication studies in
mapping genes which affect human longevity.
