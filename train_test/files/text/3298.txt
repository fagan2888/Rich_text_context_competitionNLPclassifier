Abstract
In this article, we explore how entrepreneurial journalists from a wide variety of national
contexts present `impact' as one of the aims in their work. By exploring the variety,
incongruences, and strategic considerations in the discourse on impact of those at the
forefront of journalistic innovation, we provide a much-needed empirical account of
the changing conceptualisation of what journalism is and what it is for. Our data show
how impact becomes an ideologically as well as strategically driven endeavour as the
entrepreneurs try to carve out their niche and position themselves both in relation to
traditional counterparts and other startups. Ultimately, we provide empirical insight
into a number of tensions that remain underlying in the discourse on constructive
journalism, an increasingly popular conceptualisation that refers to a future-oriented,
solution-driven, active form of journalism. We show how our interviewees marry
different, commonly-deemed incompatible practices and values, thus challenging binary
distinctions at the heart of conceptualisations of journalism, also perpetuated in the
discourse on constructive journalism. As pioneers in the field, startups can be argued
to inspire journalistic as well as social innovation, and furthermore push for a more
inclusive understanding of the divergent conceptualisations and practices that together
make up the amalgam that we call `journalism'.

Introduction
In this article, we explore the central focus of entrepreneurial journalists from a wide
variety of national contexts on impact, and we relate this to the idea of constructive jour-
nalism, defined as future-oriented, focusing on solutions, and inspiring change in society
(Gyldensted, 2015; McIntyre, 2015). With the journalistic field facing many challenges,
we find that emerging forms of journalism seek to set themselves apart from mainstream
journalism in how they define and do journalism. The emerging forms reveal the `tension
between change and stasis among actors competing to define the journalistic field'
(Carlson and Usher, 2016: 566): both the discourse on constructive journalism and the
discourses of entrepreneurial journalists that we researched stress how what they do is
different, while `reinforcing existing journalistic modes and normative commitments'(p.
568). In both, the idea that journalism needs to have an impact is central to the journalis-
tic self-understanding. In this article, we critically investigate how entrepreneurial jour-
nalists position themselves in relation to other journalists and society by exploring their
understanding of journalism's impact in society.
In both the discourses on entrepreneurial and constructive journalism, the argument is
that society needs a type of journalism that moves beyond `mere' reporting, in which
journalists assume a more active role in the development of events reported on. At the
same time, there are interesting differences between their conceptualisations of journal-
ism. Our data show that journalists'perceived role in society is complex and that the way
the notion of impact is used is not straightforward. We provide a layered and in-depth
account of their use of the notion of impact, showing it is not necessarily monolithic or
congruous. Moreover, it shows that innovation in journalism entails an interesting inter-
play between traditional and alternative conceptualisations and practices. Diverging
from the mainstream holds strategic value and innovative potential, yet at the same time
we should not underestimate the influence of traditional conceptions of journalism,
embodied in established and esteemed journalistic organisations and journalists that are
part and parcel of its shared self-understanding.
Our research data draw from interviews with 129 entrepreneurial journalists on four
continents in the period 2014­2017.1 They stem from two different projects that consider
journalistic startup culture in comparative perspective: The research project `Beyond
Journalism', led by Mark Deuze and Tamara Witschge, and the project `Entrepreneurship
at Work' led by Tamara Witschge.2 As part of these projects, interviews have been con-
ducted by graduate students and researchers with freelance and startup journalists, as
well as designers and web developers at the journalistic startups where relevant, in dif-
ferent countries. These semi-structured interviews were conducted using an interview
guide that focused on the everyday practices, routines and experiences of these journal-
ists in relation to their understanding of journalism and its societal role. The interviews
had an average duration of one hour.

With this sample we have not sought representativity, but rather geographic and pro-
fessional spread to explore diversity in practices and whether patterns can be found. To
this end, data were coded using a qualitative coding scheme. We investigate how those
journalists who arguably are at the forefront of journalistic innovation consider journal-
ism's role in society. This allows us to respond to the need for analytical clarity. Providing
this account of how these journalistic innovators perceive and imagine journalism's role
in society, we show the diversity in conceptualisations of the impact and role of journal-
ism. Moreover, we interrogate how these pioneers relate their strive for impact to values
and practices of traditional journalism. Through this we provide insight into a number of
tensions that remain underlying in the discourse on constructive journalism, as we will
highlight below.
We start with a discussion of the discourse on constructive journalism. Second, we
discuss our results detailing how entrepreneurial journalists aim to have impact on differ-
ent levels: that of the individual, community and society. Third, we discuss how journal-
ists consciously position themselves by advocating alternative conceptualisations of
journalism. The data show how journalists do not necessarily aim to present a cohesive
or comprehensive definition of journalism, nor do their conceptualisations radically
overhaul existing ways of classifying journalism. In the conclusion, we theorise these
journalists as pioneers that actively and consciously construct a particular role for them-
selves in society ­ thereby challenging not only other journalistic practices, but also,
indirectly, our analytic concepts.
Constructive journalism
The notion of what constructive journalism entails has not fully crystallised yet (McIntyre,
2015: 7), and there are different proponents and closely related conceptualisations, such
as constructive news (Haagerup, 2014), positive journalism (Dagan Wood, 2014), and
solutions journalism (McIntyre and Sobel, 2017). Here, it is not our aim to trace its his-
tory or give a comprehensive account of all the actors currently active in this field, but
rather to outline some of its main features as expressed in the discourse on constructive
journalism. Commonly, the term is suggested to refer to quality journalism that is `future-
oriented', or in the words of its advocates: constructive journalists ask, next to the tradi-
tional journalistic questions `who, what, where, when, why', the question `what now?'
(Gyldensted, 2015: 175­181). It aims to highlight inspiring examples of people or events,
discuss solutions and contribute to solving certain societal issues (Gyldensted, 2015;
McIntyre, 2015 see also Hermans and Gyldensted, this issue). At the same time, propo-
nents stress that constructive journalism is more than just covering positive news stories
or only integrating a discussion of possible solutions (for an overview of the differences
between constructive journalism and related notions, see: McIntyre, 2015: 13­16).
Influenced by civic and public journalism (Gyldensted, 2015; McIntyre, 2015), propo-
nents of constructive journalism aim to empower the public, providing them with infor-
mation and tools that either strengthen their belief in change or facilitate their actual
potential to bring about change (Gyldensted, 2015; McIntyre, 2015).
Since 2015, when she published her book From Mirrors to Movers, Gyldensted has
become one of the most visible advocates of constructive journalism. Gyldensted bases
4 Journalism 00(0)
herself on `positive psychology', a sub discipline of psychology that according to
McIntyre (2015) aims `to find and foster the factors that allow individuals, communities,
and societies to thrive' (p. 9). Starting point is that traditional journalism, adhering to the
objectivity regime, focuses too much on negative news about what is wrong in the world
(Gyldensted, 2015: 5­6). This has resulted, Gyldensted (2015) argues, in people's
increasing disengagement from important societal issues as the news gives them `a feel-
ing of hopelessness' (p. 6). She envisions a more active and involved role for journalists
where they not only point out the wrongs, but also show how to resolve these wrongs
(Gyldensted, 2015).
Constructive journalism can be argued to be a response to a number of issues in jour-
nalism that have been highlighted more widely in recent years. It, for instance, fits with
the idea that the crisis of journalism is not simply technological or economic, but ideo-
logical (Broersma and Peters, 2013). It responds to the declining authority of journalists
in society that has been observed (see, for instance, Bogaerts and Carpentier, 2013;
Wahl-Jorgensen, 2017). Advocating the re-engaging of the audience and rekindling of
journalism's role in democratic society, proponents argue that constructive journalism
addresses a number of factors in the so-called `crisis' of traditional journalism
(Gyldensted, 2015; McIntyre, 2015).
In aiming to rethink journalism's connection to the audience and journalists' role in
society, constructive journalism has been met with different responses, two of which we
would like to highlight here. First, the emphasis on the need to offer solutions and com-
mitment to inspire change in society is seen as negating journalists' independence and
critical stance (Van Genugten, 2015; Winterbauer, 2017). However, advocates emphasise
that their practice is not a form of one-sided coverage or `biased' journalism, and should
not be mistaken for advocacy journalism or activism (McIntyre, 2015; see also:
Verheyden, 2015). Moreover, they explicitly state that constructive journalism upholds
`journalism's core functions i.e.: Serving as a watchdog, alerting the public of potential
threats, disseminating important information in order to create an informed electorate'
(Gyldensted, 2015: 13; see also: McIntyre, 2015: 15).
Interestingly, the second response also relates to this emphasis on the importance of
traditional values and functions for constructive journalism and questions the innovative
nature of constructive journalism. Dutch journalist Ward Wijndelts, for example, asks
`whether constructive journalism isn't "just" what every serious journalists does'(quoted
in Smouter, 2017). Similarly, though generally positive about constructive journalism,
Verheyden (2015) asks: adding the question `What Now?'as proposed by its proponents,
`isn't that just journalism?' (similar questions are raised more implicitly in: Winterbauer,
2017). As these responses suggest, advocates of constructive journalism carefully posi-
tion themselves between adhering to and diverging from `traditional' journalism prac-
tices and values.
In this balancing act, this notion has gained considerable traction: journalism curric-
ula and journalistic networks,3 research centres,4 faculty chairs,5 and symposia and con-
ferences on constructive journalism6 suggest a growing popularity of this answer to the
so-called crisis in journalism. However, focusing on the success of this new conceptuali-
sation may conceal a number of important things. Let us highlight two: One, it seems that
the popularity and attention is limited to specific regions, most prominently North-West
Wagemans et al. 5
Europe. Second, though practitioners have been active in the development and promo-
tion of the idea, constructive journalism, at least for now, seems to be much more a dis-
course than a set of coherent and identifiable practices. The question remains: how are
values put into practice? This is particularly interesting given the balancing of tradition
and innovation that constructive journalism proposes. Rather than accepting and repro-
ducing the discourse on constructive journalism as if this is something that exists unprob-
lematically, we need to critically explore this phenomenon empirically. Given the
strategic positioning within the field by its proponents vis-à-vis other actors in the field,
it is especially important to examine how constructive journalism's core features get
translated into practice and explore its place in the field of journalism.
Doing so, we see that the core features proposed by advocates of constructive journal-
ism are not exclusively reserved for the denominator `constructive journalism', but are
appropriated and practised more widely. Though the specific terms that the interviewees
use to describe it vary, our data show a clear indication of the importance of the impact-
driven conceptualisation of journalism among new forms of journalism beyond `con-
structive journalism'. More importantly, our research allows us insight into the complex
interplay of traditional and alternative values in journalistic understanding and practice:
they show how the notion of `impact' is multi-layered, and that the emerging forms of
journalism both converge and diverge from traditional conceptualisations.
Aiming for impact in entrepreneurial journalism
As indicated, impact is a central theme in our interviews with 129 entrepreneurial jour-
nalists from various continents. It is important to note here that impact is not a monolithic
concept: There are varying ways in which the interviewees refer to impact as main driver
for their work. Interviewees use different phrasings, such as `making a difference',
`doing something that matters', `changing people's lives for the better', `driving social
change', `causing a chain reaction', `enabling people', and `educating people'. While a
clear way to differentiate, this is certainly not the only means by which they position
themselves vis-à-vis established media and other startup media, but we focus on this
here, as it provides an interesting starting point in relation to the recent popularity of the
discourse on `constructive journalism' (for a discussion of other ways in which startup
journalists position themselves in the field, see, for instance, Carlson and Usher, 2016;
Harbers, 2016; Wagemans et al., 2016).
The wish to create a form of journalism that is useful for their audiences and has an
impact on society is a recurrent theme in the interviews. However, where the discourse
on `constructive journalism' suggests impact to be an unambiguous or simple concept,
our data show it to encompass a variety of meanings; there are differences in the types of
impact that the interviewees seek or say to aspire. Here, we identify three levels, which
we map onto the data: the level of the individual, of the community and of society as a
whole. This is not to suggest a hierarchy or that these are all the ways in which impact is
relevant to our interviewees. However, there was a striking difference in the foci that
journalists had when talking about the type of impact they aimed for, which shows that
impact is not necessarily a straightforward concept. The discussion here about the levels
of impact that interviewees aspire to, is thus not to suggest a neat distinction, but rather
to show the diversity present.
6 Journalism 00(0)
The many faces of impact
Our data show that impact comes in many forms and guises. First, journalists aim to be
helpful for people on a very concrete level. Journalists strive to produce stories that are
directly relevant for their audience. This means that audience members need to be able
to recognise how a story relates or influences their own everyday lives. As the following
quote shows, this goal of impacting their audiences directly affects the selection of their
stories, making it an important consideration in determining what is worthy of coverage
and what is not:
I think that our goal is to say: `Here's a story, and here's how it directly impacts you'. And if it
doesn't impact our readers, if it's not something tangible, that makes them say: `Okay, this is
how it's going to affect me', then it's not really for us [to cover]. (Editor,7 Corner Media, USA,
2016)
Impact at the individual level refers to journalists' desire to help people in their day-
to-day lives by giving information about such things as traffic in town or upcoming
events (see Eldridge and Steel, 2016 on user's perspectives on this). Such information is
provided through short announcements or listicles, which enable people to anticipate
these events and structure their everyday lives on a practical level: `It's having useful,
just the most useful tangible things, like event listings that are accurate that actually tell
people what is going on in town tonight' (Editor, Alaska Dispatch News, USA, 2016).
Impact on the individual level, however, also involves startups helping to equip indi-
viduals to deal with bigger problems, whether by offering advice, such as on how to
prevent soil erosion, or by providing tools that people can use to improve their daily
lives, such as the Medicine Price Comparison Tool and the Domestic Workers Tool
developed by C4SA. Startups aim to provoke social change by presenting information in
new ways, and making existing information more accessible, including through data-
bases and tools. Impact on the individual level is aimed at empowering individual people
by providing useful information, not only so they can improve their living conditions,
but also to strengthen their position as citizens (see also Baack, 2015). This focus on
strengthening the individual's capacity as citizens shows how even impact at the indi-
vidual level spills over into the other levels, and how it is intertwined with impact at the
community and societal level.
Second, we identify a community level: startups aspire to have impact on the people
journalists see and interact with, who are close to them either geographically or `digi-
tally'. The following quote of this New York­based local editor illustrates nicely at
which level they are seeking to have an impact:
You won't bring down Nixon or anything like that. But it looks like there's going to be a new
traffic safety light going up in the community that's going to make a dangerous intersection
safer, partly because of an article I wrote. (Editor, Corner Media, USA, 2016)
This type of community-oriented journalism includes a wide variety of activities,
such as opening up possibilities for dialogue between the community and journalists or
among different members of the community, connecting people, and sharing knowledge
within the community, educating people in the community, bringing people in
Wagemans et al. 7
the community closer together, learning about each other, but also doing journalism to
prevent small businesses from closing or to get a dangerous playground sorted (see also
Hess and Waller, 2017).
We see that at this level, impact refers both to journalism that is used to solve concrete
problems and to promote inclusiveness, so as to strengthen the local community. This
becomes clear from this quote of an Alaskan editor, who states he is `happiest' when:
Producing work that connects with the community, makes the community a better place, that
pulls the community together, that is memorable for a lot of people, that is productive, that
makes the community, that solves the problem. (Editor, Alaska Dispatch News, USA 2016)
In line with constructive journalism's aim to empower the public and facilitate and
inspire citizens to solve issues they encounter (Gyldensted, 2015), journalists aim at
bridging the divides they see in their communities, helping their communities overcome
obstacles, giving voice to those who are not being heard and help making visible those
who have been overlooked by existing media. As such, these startups seem to share a
political agenda with community media, which also aspire to give voice to and strengthen
the local community in which they are based (cf. Fenton et al., 2010).
Most of these journalists come from startups that differ in organisation from their
community media colleagues, in terms of business model, which is much less based on
public funding, and much less relying on the role played by amateurs and volunteers in
the startups (cf. Fenton et al., 2010). Nevertheless, a number of these startups do involve
community members in content creation, encouraging people to actively contribute to
the content, so they feel part of the outlet as if it were a community itself. In addition,
there seems to be a greater involvement of the journalists with the people in their com-
munity than is the case with traditional top-down legacy media (cf. Lewis et al., 2014).
MMU Radio, for instance, wishes to disseminate the university's research for the benefit
of that community, and aims to facilitate an exchange of information by allowing listen-
ers, students and researchers to come to the studio and broadcast something
themselves:
If a villager here is able to come in the radio station, [he could] broadcast a program, or possibly
teach the rest of the communities better methods of agriculture, or how to improve the
agriculture in the vicinity here. (Radio host, MMU Radio, Uganda, 2016)
Where bigger newsrooms have moved out of the cities that they write about, and local
news tends to be less and less locally produced (cf. Fenton et al., 2010), we see that the
`community' is a concept that is very much alive for these startup journalists, whether it
relates to the group of people they want to belong to, connect to, give voice to or whose
lives they seek to improve. Moreover, some of them explicitly state they are fulfilling a
role in local journalism that has been neglected by large legacy outlets.
Third, we identify the aspiration to have impact at the societal level. This connects to
the broader concept of the common good, where the startups' activities are seen as con-
structive for an abstract national or international community, or are conceived as a public
service. What is of interest here is that though it touches upon a similar sentiment, it also
8 Journalism 00(0)
differs from the professional ideology of journalism, which traditionally includes a
notion of safeguarding democracy and providing a public service (Deuze, 2005).
Although the discourses that ideologically position journalism refer to keeping the pow-
ers in balance, or performing a watchdog role, here this political involvement takes on a
new dimension for the journalistic startups in our data. In the interview material, this
presents itself as advocacy for social causes, as activism against government policy, and
the organisation of and participation in demonstrations.
We can see this, for example, when a Radio Sagarmatha/Naya Pusta editor from
Nepal explains how they were involved in campaigns, demonstrations, and even lawsuits
against non-governmental organisations (NGOs), the government, or corporations:
We have fought with the government in the court of law, we have been against some hydro
powers. If those were established then it could have harmed a very rich and diverse city in
Eastern Nepal. (Editor, Radio Sagarmatha/Naya Pusta, Nepal, 2016)
And even if the journalists do not go as far as to involve themselves in a court of law,
the French Mediapart articulated support for movements like the recent `Nuit Debout',8
and a campaign against the construction of a dam in an ecological area,9 and co-organ-
ised an event to defend freedom of information in Greece.10 These examples show how
they combine activities that are traditionally labelled more journalistic with those more
activist (see also Benkler, 2013 on the relation between these).
Understanding impact in context
Aiming to show the multi-layered and diverse nature of the concept of impact, we need
to address the diversity in historical, social, political and economic contexts of journal-
ists. As noted above, our research locates constructive journalism in a limited geographic
scope, most notably Western and affluent democracies. Our interviews with entrepre-
neurial journalists worldwide show that when we want to understand the diversity of the
conceptualisations of journalism, we need to situate the concept of impact in its contexts
(see also Nerone, 2013). The journalists in our sample highlight the context from which
they are working as an important conditioning factor in terms of the type of impact they
can make.
In this light, we see that MMU Radio in Uganda primarily focuses on giving people
basic information and educating them about essential needs, whether it is getting a fair
price for their goods, achieving a successful harvest, or healthy sanitary conditions.
Code4SouthAfrica (C4SA) in South Africa is creating tools to help citizens compare the
different prices for medication and to decide on a fair remuneration for their domestic
workers. Mediapart in France and IRPI in Italy also want to educate people, but are
focused more on exposing and changing what they believe is a malfunctioning govern-
ment system. For entrepreneurial journalists in Hungary, the belief in change is alto-
gether more limited, and as such aspirations are adjusted accordingly. As a Hungarian
journalist (anonymous) notes: `if the situation doesn't worsen, we're apparently having
an impact'. In Nepal, similarly the sentiment is that change is hard to establish. This
Wagemans et al. 9
reflects the similar discursive repertoires invoked in talking about the aims and aspira-
tions of emerging players in journalism.
If we take into account the diversity of national, economic, cultural, and political
contexts that journalists work within, we see that we need to contextualise the main fea-
tures identified in the discourse on `constructive journalism': what is activism in one
context, is not necessarily so in another, what is an act of protest or labelled as subjective
reporting in one instance, may be conceptualised as empowering audiences and watch-
dog reporting in another. C4SA, for instance, defines being activist as having a social
agenda and their members state that their goal is to achieve tangible change in society. In
other instances, activism is defined as highlighting one side of a story, a view Radio
Sagarmatha/Naya Pusta puts forward:
In our part of the world the richer people have access to and they control the news. They control
politics. And they control the information that should reach the people. And then we are the
people who inform them: `this is not true'; `there is another part of the story'. (Editor, Radio
Sagarmatha/Naya Pusta, Nepal, 2016)
Beyond the diversity of contexts, it becomes clear that the interviewed journalists do
not see it as their task to `simply' produce output, `relaying' what is going on in the
world; they want to make a difference, inspire change, leave a mark, and make their work
matter. And yes, in some cases, the journalists state they do so as activists, doing activist
work, or feeling involved in a `movement' rather than journalism per se. Some use the
term subjective, instead of activist, to refer to those instances where they give more atten-
tion to some angle in the story because they deem it important, but underrepresented in
traditional outlets. They describe how they are trying to increase engagement, encourage
dialogue or educate their audiences. They refer to caring about the subjects and the com-
munities they cover as an important characteristic of a journalist. We argue here, that
rather than understanding that as part of the age-old debate between subjective, biased
and objective reporting, or labelling it as activism rather than journalism, we need to
understand these within the contexts that journalists are working from.
Re-imagining journalism beyond dichotomies
We have shown in the above how journalistic entrepreneurs throughout the world focus
on making a difference, having an impact. We have also shown that both the forms of
making an impact as well as the contexts from which these actors are operating are
diverse. These ways of viewing impact not only show diversity in the way in which
impact is conceptualised, but also in the conceptualisation of what journalism is and
what type of journalism is needed in society. There are interesting parallels with the way
in which authors and practitioners of constructive journalism imagine the practice and
aim of journalism. These parallels show the complexity that underlies the practices and
understandings of journalism. As Ryfe (2006) states (p. 203), the rules or norms that
guide production are in flux, and there is both `great consistency and great variability',
and this becomes clear from our research too.
10 Journalism 00(0)
Entrepreneurs combine and navigate between traditional and alternative values seem-
ingly effortlessly. What is more, the interviewees show a reflexivity that indicates an
awareness of the latitude available to them to re-imagine journalism and its societal role.
Here, we address these in turn. First, in terms of the self-understanding, we see that in the
discourses of entrepreneurial journalism, the distinction between doing activism and
`active' journalism is recognised but not necessarily experienced as tension. Whereas
constructive journalism proponents highlight that what they do is not activism, our inter-
viewees do not seem to have as much qualms with taking on the title of `activist', as the
following quote illustrates:
In college I used to march with the student organisations before I turned into a student journalist.
[...] Journalism affords you the opportunity to actually engage with leaders across the table,
which is more civil. I'd say that I'm more of a sophisticated activist. I won't be on the streets,
[...], I will not be jumping around, I will be in an office, but what I am doing is for the benefit
of you. (Freelancer, C4SA, South Africa, 2014)
At the same time, our data show the multiformity of new journalistic endeavours,
some of which focus on `simply' providing `facts':
There will be a higher focus on just a factual education and then allowing the reader to make
conclusions on their own. (Analyst, Inka Binka, USA, 2016)
What makes our data particularly interesting is that they show that we cannot simply
continue the perceived dichotomy of `active' versus `passive' or `neutral' versus `activ-
ist'to analyse the startups as the interviewees'understandings and practices do not easily
or necessarily fit only one of the two categories (see also Eldridge, 2018: 35­36). The
journalists marry or navigate between these forms with a seeming ease and elegance. For
them, journalists do not necessarily need to choose between `stating facts'on the one end
or actively proposing and pushing forward a solution on the other. Both have their place
and are not necessarily conflicting for the interviewees. This is clearly illustrated by a
senior editor at De Correspondent when he reflects on their campaign to get people to
switch to a bank that focuses more on sustainability. For him pointing out `what is going
on in the world' and propagating a certain solution or line of action are not
incompatible:
Ultimately, it should remain journalism in essence as it is about gaining insight from the world.
So that can also be `these are the problems you will encounter, and this is what you have to take
into account'. That is gaining insight from the world. And it is not a problem if that is related to
`do this [switch to a different bank]' (Senior editor of De Correspondent, Netherlands)
Interestingly, this editor's reference to the `essence' of journalism that needs to be
upheld suggests that there are limits to what can be considered journalism. At the same
time, though, the quote shows what is more widespread in the interviews: the breaking
away from the idea that certain practices are incompatible with each other (see also
Benkler, 2013). In their discourses, interviewees combine what is commonly deemed to
Wagemans et al. 11
be contrasting, such as well-known oppositions like `objective' and `subjective', `neu-
tral' and `committed', or `detached' and `involved'.
What is more, the interviewees show a remarkable understanding of this:
What also interests me is that journalists strive to be objective. It is never really the case, but
you strive to tell an objective story and inform people. But if you combine journalism with
activism, you've got a goal you want to achieve. That combination interests me. How to
combine striving for a goal with striving for objectivity. (Developer, C4SA, South Africa,
2014)
In general, the data point to a conscious positioning within the field by the journalists.
Their awareness of their own positioning, or their deliberate construction of what is jour-
nalism seems to provide the journalists with a certain leeway in their practices and self-
understanding. They actively experiment and test the boundaries of what journalism is,
and we could argue that this in a way `liberates' the entrepreneurial journalists: It allows
them to break free from the naturalised and static conception of journalism that has
developed over time (cf. Deuze and Witschge, 2018). Though each startup needs to con-
sider its niche, there seems to be much more space for alternative and rich
conceptualisations:
There are a hundred different definitions of it [strong journalism] as far as I'm concerned. It's
being useful to the users, to the readers, it's explaining the world, it's accountability journalism
that holds public institutions accountable, holding a mirror up to the community, it's providing
strong breaking news coverage of events that are happening as they are happening. (Editor,
Alaska Dispatch News, USA, 2016)
It is perhaps precisely the fact that these startups need to find a niche audience
(Singer, 2017) ­ rather than cater to and compete for the general public ­ that makes
them more open to alternative conceptualisations of what journalism is and what it is
for. As such, we see that the definition of what journalism is, is connected to the actual
audience they are targeting and this can vary even for different parts within the same
company, as the case of The Post Online from the Netherlands illustrates: for their
magazine, the niche is quality journalism `for people who are willing to consume and
pay for it', for their online free output it is the `critical tone of the content', a freelancer
explains (Interview conducted in 2015).
Such niche-driven understandings of journalism suggest that understandings and
practices are not only ideologically driven but also influenced by strategic considera-
tions. They involve conscious targeting and catering to particular audiences, setting
themselves apart from competitors. This puts the traditional distinction between com-
mercial and public interests served by journalistic organisations (Phillips and Witschge,
2012) in an interesting new light. It is important, though, to consider that this is very
much context-dependent. Though the startups are all connected by their ideological
stance to have impact in society, the economic, political, and journalistic contexts differ
greatly and thus also their ability and desire to strategically and financially position their
startups.

Conclusion
In this article, we have considered a specific type of journalists, entrepreneurs, to explore
some of the strands in the discourse on constructive journalism. What makes this group
of journalists particularly interesting is that they can be seen as pioneers in the field (see
also Hepp and Loosen, 2017), thus shaping not only the content of media, but also its
form and thus its role in society. Hepp defines pioneering communities as `experimental
groupings related to new forms of media-technology related change and collectivity for-
mation' (Hepp, 2016: 920). They `have a sense of mission' and have `a sense that they
are at the "forefront" of a media-related transformation of society as a whole' (Hepp,
2016: 924­925). This is very much the case with entrepreneurial journalists too. They
see it as their mission to seek innovation, both technological as well as ideological, to
further the societal role attributed to journalism (for a reflection on how entrepreneurial
journalists explore the affordances of digital technologies and expand the definitions of
what journalism is, see also: Witschge and Harbers, 2018). Furthermore, they are aware
of the role that they play not only in society, but also in defining what is journalism. This
reflexivity is characteristic of pioneering communities where knowledge is `highly
`reflexive'given that the pioneers `are engaged in a continual process of interpretation of
themselves' (Hepp, 2016: 927).
Our exploration of how these pioneers understand and actively construct their role in
society provides an important empirical counterpart to the discourse on constructive
journalism. As we have discussed above, the discourse on constructive journalism sug-
gests that impact is a straightforward notion that sets constructive journalism apart from
traditional forms of journalism. Of course, strategically this makes sense, as traditional
journalism provides a clear reference point against which constructive journalism can
position itself, and, as all specific forms of journalism tries to, make its boundaries dis-
tinct (Eldridge, 2018: 50­53). Yet, if anything, our analysis shows how emerging players
in the field combine, complement, and interweave seemingly opposing practices and
values, moving beyond the traditional/alternative divide. Rather than seeing the marry-
ing of seemingly opposing values and practices as necessarily problematic, such diver-
sity and divergence in practices and values allow us to see the complexity and variety
that is existent in the field (Deuze and Witschge, 2018).
Acknowledging that notions such as `constructive journalism' are not neutral or
unambiguous, we can start to see how they are used and appropriated by journalists to
anchor, inspire and delimit practices. As eloquently expressed by Lakoff and Johnson
(1980), the concepts people refer to are informative about how they look at the world:
The concepts that govern our thought are not just matters of the intellect. They also govern our
everyday functioning, down to the most mundane details. Our concepts structure what we
perceive, how we get around in the world, and how we relate to other people. (p. 3)
The discourses and practices employed by the journalists we interviewed here, as
such do not only perform a strategic role in allowing them to find their niche, to gain
cultural or economic capital, but also challenge us as researchers. Where we have the
tendency to neatly categorise the tensions, trying to `explain' contradictions, these
Wagemans et al. 13
practices show us, or perhaps highlight and remind us of the complexity of the field (see
also: Costera Meijer, 2016).
We have shown how the practices and discourses of entrepreneurial journalists both con-
firm and challenge traditional conceptualisations and delineations. This shows how neither
the discourse on constructive journalism, nor the definitions that entrepreneurs hold of jour-
nalism provide any definitive answers to the long-lasting debate about what journalism is and
what it should be. The interviewees remind us that the practice and conceptualisation of jour-
nalism is an on-going, context-specific, and diverse process, rather than a static and fixed
project and that dichotomies long put at the centre of our understanding and analysis of jour-
nalism are not as informative as we consider them to be (see also Witschge e t al., 2018)­
whether they relate to `neutrality' versus `engagement', `subjectivity' versus `objectivity' or
`informing' versus `activating' the audience. Our challenge is to develop ways to theorise
concurrent practices that we have previously labelled `incompatible' or `contradictory' and
embrace the divergent conceptualisations and practices that together make up the amalgam
that we call `journalism'.

 7. Many of the interviewees do not refer to themselves using job titles typical for the journalistic
profession, such as `editor' or `reporter'. Some of the interviewees do not recognise them-
selves as journalists at all or only partially. Moreover, even those who do have `journalistic'
job titles, often indicate that their actual work is not properly reflected by this job title, as they
fulfil a variety of tasks within the startup.
