DIABETES PRESENTS A SIGNIFI-
cant public health burden on
the basis of its increased
morbidity, mortality, and
economic costs.1,2 Individuals with di-
agnosed diabetes are at an increased risk
for vascular disease, including micro-
vascular complications (eg, retinopa-
thy, neuropathy, and nephropathy) and
macrovascular complications (eg, coro-
nary heart disease and stroke), and
lower extremity amputations.3-6 Im-
proved glycemic control clearly re-
duces the risk of microvascular dis-
ease among individuals with diagnosed
diabetes and is associated with lower
risk of atherosclerosis and macrovas-
cular disease.4,7-12 While treatment for
individuals with diabetes has tradition-
ally focused on control of glycemia to
reduce these vascular complications,
there is growing evidence highlight-
ing the importance of controlling blood
pressure and cholesterol levels.9,13-16 In
addition, while intensive control of gly-
cemia, blood pressure, and choles-
terol levels all improve health out-
comes for individuals with diabetes,
control of blood pressure has been re-
ported to be the most cost-effective in-
tervention.17

Context Control of blood glucose levels, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels is proven
to reduce the risk of vascular disease among individuals with diabetes mellitus; how-
ever, the current state of control of these risk factors among individuals in the United
States is uncertain.
Objectives To examine 1999-2000 national data on control of risk factors for vas-
cular disease among adults with previously diagnosed diabetes and to assess trends
during the past decade.
Design, Setting, and Participants Review of data from the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, conducted 1988-1994) and NHANES
1999-2000, cross-sectional surveys of a nationally representative sample of the non-
institutionalized civilian US population. Participants were adults aged 20 years and older
with previously diagnosed diabetes who participated in both the interview and ex-
amination in either NHANES III (n=1265) or NHANES 1999-2000 (n=441).
Main Outcome Measures Levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c
), blood pres-
sure, and total serum cholesterol in reference to target goals.
Results Compared with NHANES III, participants with previously diagnosed diabe-
tes in NHANES 1999-2000 were similar by age and sex, were less likely to be non-
Hispanic white, were diagnosed at an earlier age, had a higher body mass index, and
were more likely to use insulin in combination with oral agents. In NHANES 1999-
2000, only 37.0% of participants achieved the target goal of HbA1c
level less than 7.0%
and 37.2% of participants were above the recommended "take action" HbA1c
level
of greater than 8.0%; these percentages did not change significantly from NHANES
III (P=.11 and P=.87, respectively). Only 35.8% of participants achieved the target
of systolic blood pressure (SBP) less than 130 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)
less than 80 mm Hg, and 40.4% had hypertensive blood pressure levels (SBP 140 or
DBP 90 mm Hg). These percentages did not change significantly from NHANES III
(P=.10 and P=.56, respectively). Over half (51.8%) of the participants in NHANES
1999-2000 had total cholesterol levels of 200 mg/dL or greater (vs 66.1% in NHANES
III; P.001). In total, only 7.3% (95% confidence interval, 2.8%-11.9%) of adults
with diabetes in NHANES 1999-2000 attained recommended goals of HbA1c
level less
than 7%, blood pressure less than 130/80 mm Hg, and total cholesterol level less than
200 mg/dL (5.18 mmol/L).
Conclusion Further public health efforts are needed to control risk factors for vas-
cular disease among individuals with diagnosed diabetes.

tionsthroughcontrolofglycemia,blood
pressure, and blood lipid levels, as well
as through smoking cessation.18 The
ADA goal for control of glycemia is gly-
cosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c
) level less
than 7%; additional treatment is sug-
gested for individuals with HbA1c
lev-
els greater than 8%. The goal for con-
trol of blood pressure is systolic blood
pressure less than 130 mm Hg and dia-
stolic blood pressure less than 80
mm Hg.18 The Joint National Commit-
tee on Prevention, Detection, Evalua-
tion, and Treatment of High Blood Pres-
sure (JNC) also now recommends this
level of blood pressure control al-
though the recommended diastolic tar-
get was 85 mm Hg until 2003.19 The
ADA goal for lipid management is
aimed at lowering levels of low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol to less
than 100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L), in-
creasing levels of high-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol to greater than 45
mg/dL (1.16 mmol/L) for men and 55
mg/dL (1.42 mmol/L) for women, and
lowering levels of triglycerides to less
than 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L).18 In ad-
dition, the National Cholesterol Edu-
cation Program Adult Treatment Panel
III (NCEP-ATP-III) sets a goal for total
cholesterol levels of less than 200 mg/dL
(5.18 mmol/L).20
Previous analysis of nationally repre-
sentative surveys found that individu-
alswithdiabeteshadpoorcontrolofrisk
factors for vascular disease.21-23 How-
ever, these results were based on na-
tional surveys conducted in the early
1990s and may not accurately reflect the
current state of control of risk factors for
vascular disease among individuals with
diabetes in the United States.
We examined the trends in control
of risk factors for vascular disease
among adults with diagnosed diabetes
in the United States over nearly a de-
cade using data from 2 national health
surveys: the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) conducted from 1988-
1994 and the NHANES 1999-2000.
Specifically, we compared HbA1c
lev-
els, blood pressure, and total choles-
terol levels among adults with previ-
ously diagnosed diabetes between these
surveys to assess whether control of risk
factors for vascular disease has changed.
METHODS
Surveys
The survey instruments, physical ex-
amination, and laboratory measure-
ments of NHANES III and NHANES
1999-2000 have been described in de-
tail.24-28 Both surveys comprised na-
tionally representative samples of the
noninstitutionalized civilian US popu-
lation, obtained by a complex, strati-
fied, multistage probability cluster
sample design. Both surveys over-
sampled non-Hispanic blacks, Mexi-
can Americans, and individuals aged 60
years and older; NHANES 1999-2000
also oversampled low-income individu-
als. Participants were interviewed in
their homes to ascertain sociodemo-
graphic, medical, and family history
data. A standardized set of physical ex-
aminations and laboratory measure-
ments was performed in a mobile ex-
amination center. Blood pressure was
measured using a mercury sphygmo-
manometer. In NHANES III, the aver-
age of the second and third values was
used; in NHANES 1999-2000, 3 to 4
blood pressure measurements were av-
eraged after excluding the first. In both
surveys, HbA1c
measurements were
standardized to the Diabetes Control
and Complications Trial (DCCT)
method and levels of total serum cho-
lesterol were measured enzymatically.
The overall response rate for comple-
tion of the interview and physical ex-
amination was 78% in NHANES III and
75% in NHANES 1999-2000.
Participants
We included adults aged 20 years and
older who completed the interview and
examination and who answered "yes"
when asked whether a physician (or a
health care professional, in NHANES
1999-2000) ever told them they had dia-
betes (n=1265 in NHANES III and
n = 441 in NHANES 1999-2000).
Women who reported a history of dia-
betesonlyduringpregnancywerenotin-
cluded. To determine the percentage
with diagnosed diabetes in each survey
we included all adults aged 20 years and
older who completed the interview
(NHANES III, n=18822; NHANES
1999-2000, n=4874).
Analysis
To define categories of desirable and un-
desirable HbA1c
levels and blood pres-
sure, we used the ADA standards of
medical care for persons with diabe-
tes.18 For desirable and undesirable lev-
els of total cholesterol, we used guide-
lines from the ADA18 and the NCEP-
ATP-III.20 We did not evaluate levels of
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or
triglycerides, since few participants with
diagnosed diabetes in NHANES 1999-
2000 (n=99 and n=111, respectively)
had valid measurements.
Microalbuminuria was defined as
30 µg or more of albumin per milli-
gram of creatinine determined by spot
urine collection for participants in each
survey who reported fasting at least 6
hours prior to collection.18 A history of
cardiovascular disease was defined as
a history of angina, heart attack, or coro-
nary heart disease. Participants were
considered to be current smokers if they
reported smoking at least 100 ciga-
rettes in their lifetime and reported
smoking on at least some days within
the past 30 days.
Risk factors for vascular disease were
reported for participants in both sur-
veys overall and by sex. Due to the small
number of individuals with diagnosed
diabetes in NHANES 1999-2000, we
were unable to stratify by age or race/
ethnicity.
We report the unadjusted and age-
standardized prevalence of diagnosed
diabetes in NHANES III and NHANES
1999-2000. We age-standardized the
prevalence of diagnosed diabetes to the
2000 US Census population using 3 age
groups (20-39 years, 40-59 years, and
60 years) and corresponding weights
(0.40589, 0.36621, 0.22790).
To compare characteristics and risk
factors between the surveys, we age-
standardized the NHANES III results by
the direct method to the NHANES
1999-2000 diabetes population using

3 age groups (20-39 years, 40-59 years,
60 years) and corresponding weights
(0.0505,0.2283,0.7212).TheNHANES
1999-2000 diabetes population was se-
lected as the standard to minimize ran-
dom variability.29 Since NHANES III
and NHANES 1999-2000 are indepen-
dent samples, we used 2-sample t tests
for testing differences in means and pro-
portions.30
Analyses were performed using
SUDAAN version 8.0 (Research Tri-
angle Institute, Research Triangle Park,
NC) with appropriate sampling weights
to account for the complex survey de-
sign and to provide nationally repre-
sentative estimates. Although the
NHANES surveys oversampled differ-
ent groups, survey weighting ensures
that the results from the 2 surveys are
comparable. Since the primary sam-
pling units and strata were not pro-
vided in the NHANES 1999-2000 pub-
lic release data set, we used the replicate
weights provided with the jackknife
command. Unreliable estimates, ie,
those with a relative standard error
greater than 30%, are noted in the
tables.31,32
RESULTS
The prevalence of diagnosed diabetes
and the characteristics of adults with
diabetes are shown in TABLE 1. The un-
adjusted prevalence of diagnosed dia-
betes in adults aged 20 years and older
in NHANES 1999-2000 was 5.9% (SE,
0.52). The age-standardized preva-
lence of previously diagnosed diabe-
tes did not increase significantly from
NHANES III (5.4%; SE, 0.21) to
NHANES 1999-2000 (6.1%; SE, 0.52)
(P=.17). Participants with diagnosed
diabetes were similar by age and sex in
the 2 surveys. In NHANES 1999-
2000, there were significantly fewer
non-Hispanic whites, similar propor-
tions of non-Hispanic blacks and Mexi-
canAmericans,andasignificantlylarger
proportion of participants of other race/
ethnicity groups compared with
NHANES III. These changes in race/
ethnicity between the 2 surveys re-
flect the changes in the US Census be-
tween 1990 and 2000. However, the

decrease in the proportion of non-
Hispanic whites and the increase in the
proportion of persons of other race/
ethnicity are more substantial among
individuals with diabetes than in the
general population (data not shown).
Mean body mass index (BMI, calcu-
lated as weight in kilograms divided by
the square of height in meters) among
adults with diagnosed diabetes in-
creased significantly from 29.9 in
NHANES III to 32.3 in NHANES 1999-
2000 (P=.002), and the percentage of
those with diagnosed diabetes who were
obese (BMI 30) increased from 41.6%
to 54.6% (P=.008).
Individuals with previously diag-
nosed diabetes in NHANES 1999-
2000 had been diagnosed at a signifi-
cantly younger age (46.7 vs 50.7 years;
P=.003) and had a significantly longer
duration of diabetes (12.5 vs 10.2 years;
P=.03) than those in NHANES III.
There was no significant change in the
prevalence of microalbuminuria or his-
tory of cardiovascular disease.
Medication Use
Use of insulin alone decreased signifi-
cantly (27.6% vs 17.0%, P=.002), and
insulin use in combination with oral
agents increased significantly (3.5% vs
10.4%, P=.01) over the 2 surveys. The
percentage of adults who reported no
pharmacological treatment for diabe-
tes decreased (24.8% vs 18.7%; P=.06)
and use of blood pressure medications
increased (77.0% vs 85.2%; P=.05). Use
of blood pressure medications could
be underreported if use of renin-
angiotensin system agents were attrib-
uted to nephropathy rather than to
hypertension. Among adults with di-
agnosed high cholesterol, medication
use for high cholesterol was more than
2-fold higher in NHANES 1999-2000
(56.1%) compared with NHANES III
(27.7%) (P.001). There was no dif-
ference in regular use of aspirin.

adults in NHANES 1999-2000 had
HbA1c
levels at the ADA goal of less than
7.0%. The percentage of participants
with HbA1c
levels less than 7.0% did not
change significantly from NHANES III
(P=.11) and did not differ by sex. Over-
all, the percentage of participants with
HbA1c
levels greater than 8%, the level
suggested by the ADA for focused treat-
ment action, was 37.2% in NHANES
1999-2000 and was unchanged from
NHANES III (P=.87).
Blood Pressure Levels
The mean systolic blood pressure
among adults with diagnosed diabetes
was significantly lower in NHANES
1999-2000, particularly in men, but the
diastolic blood pressure did not change
appreciably between the surveys (Table
2). There was a slight increase in the
percentage of participants with blood
pressure at the level currently recom-
mended by the ADA (systolic 130
mm Hg and diastolic 80 mm Hg) from
NHANES III (29.0%) to NHANES
1999-2000 (35.8%) (P=.10), with a cor-
responding small decrease in the per-
centage with high normal (28.2% vs
23.8%; P=.19) and hypertensive (42.9%
vs 40.4%; P=.56) blood pressures. The
proportions based on the recom-
mended levels by the ADA in 1995 (sys-
tolic 130 mm Hg and diastolic 85
mm Hg) also did not change signifi-
cantly from the NHANES III (1988-
1994) (32.1%) to NHANES 1999-
2000 (36.6%) (P=.29).
Total Serum Cholesterol Levels
Overall, total serum cholesterol levels
decreased significantly from NHANES
III to NHANES 1999-2000 (P.001)
(Table 2). However, in NHANES 1999-
2000, 50.0% of men and 53.8% of
women still had total serum choles-
terol levels of 200 mg/dL (5.18 mmol/L)
or greater, below which is the NCEP-
ATP-III goal.
Combined Control of Risk Factors
Overall, the percentage of adults with
diagnosed diabetes in NHANES 1999-
2000 who achieved currently recom-
mended goals of HbA1c
level, blood
pressure, and total serum cholesterol
level was only 7.3% (95% confidence
interval, 2.8%-11.9%) (FIGURE). This
is similar to the percentage who had
these recommended levels in NHANES
III (5.2%; 95% confidence interval,
3.8%-6.6%).
COMMENT
Compelling evidence from well-
designed, randomized clinical trials
demonstrates that control of glucose
levels, blood pressure, and cholesterol
levels can dramatically delay or pre-
vent the microvascular and macrovas-
cular complications of diabetes.8,9,11-15
Based on these data, the ADA,8 the
JNC,19 and the NCEP20 have devel-
oped guidelines for control of blood glu-
cose levels, blood pressure, and cho-
lesterol levels in individuals with
diabetes. Despite these evidence-
based guidelines, only a small fraction
(2.8% to 11.9%) of adults with diag-
nosed diabetes in the United States are
achieving the currently recommended
levels of control. Other studies exam-
ining diabetes care in various clinical
settings also have found that current
medical practice is not achieving goals
for management of glucose levels, blood
pressure, and lipid levels in individu-
als with diabetes.23,33-36 This study pre-
sents contemporary data from a nation-
ally representative sample of
noninstitutionalized adults in the
United States with previously diag-
nosed diabetes. Comparison of the cur-
rent data and representative data from
approximately a decade earlier, ob-
tained through similar standardized
procedures, demonstrates significant
improvement in the control of total cho-
lesterol levels, but little to no change
in control of blood glucose levels and
blood pressure.
The period between NHANES III
(1988-1994) and NHANES 1999-
2000 has seen a substantial accumula-
tion of evidence regarding the benefits
of glycemic control. In 1993, the land-
mark DCCT study showed that inten-
sive glycemic therapy of type 1 diabe-
tes reduced the risk of microvascular
disease by up to 70%.8 Similar dra-
matic reductions in risk of microvas-
cular complications in type 2 diabetes
were subsequently found in the United
Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study
(UKPDS).9 Despite this compelling evi-
dence of benefit, an ADA recommen-
dation of an HbA1c
target level of less
than 7.0% in January 1995, the cre-

tion Program (NDEP) in 199737 to pro-
mulgate the importance of glycemic
control, and the advent of several new
classes of medications for glycemic con-
trol,38 NHANES 1999-2000 found no
change in mean HbA1c
values or in the
fraction of adults with diabetes with
HbA1c
levels below the target levels.
Long-term follow-up of the DCCT
study population provides impressive
new evidence of the importance of gly-
cemic control. The period of im-
proved glycemic control in the inten-
sively treated arm of the DCCT
continues to yield potent reduction in
risk of microvascular disease well be-
yond the period of intensive implemen-
tation11 and the beneficial effect of gly-
cemic control now extends to
macrovascular disease, indicated by re-
duced carotid artery wall thicken-
ing.12 These latest observations should
strengthen public health efforts to trans-
late intensive glycemic control into
clinical practice.
Impressive evidence that intensive
control of blood pressure in adults with
type 2 diabetes prevents both micro-
vascular and macrovascular diseases
also emerged during and after NHANES
III,13,14,39 leading to recommendations
by the JNC-5 in 1993 and the ADA in
1995 that blood pressure levels for pa-
tients with diabetes should be lower
(130/85 mm Hg) than in other hy-
pertensive groups. The recommended
blood pressure level was further re-
duced to less than 130/80 mm Hg by
the ADA in 200118 and the JNC-7 in
2003.19 From NHANES III to NHANES
1999-2000, the prevalence of hyper-
tension increased significantly in the
general US population, and its preva-
lence was associated with risk factors
for diabetes including older age, non-
Hispanic black race, and higher BMI.40
When individuals with diabetes were
excluded from analysis, the preva-
lence of hypertension was no longer sig-
nificantly increased. That analysis of in-
dividuals with diagnosed hypertension
found that the percentage of those with
diabetes and hypertension controlled to
less than 140/90 mm Hg declined non-
significantly (to 46.9%) in those with
diabetes. We found a small but statis-
tically significant decrease in mean sys-
tolic blood pressure in individuals with
diagnosed diabetes and a small and non-
significant increase in the fraction of
participants with diabetes with nor-
mal blood pressure. The new guide-
lines for control of blood pressure is-
sued near the conclusion of NHANES
III may have contributed to the small
but statistically significant decrease in
mean systolic blood pressure in indi-
viduals with diagnosed diabetes in
NHANES 1999-2000, but there has
been minimal, if any, effect in reduc-
ing the proportion of those with blood
pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or greater.
Data from NHANES 1999-2000 was
collected just after clinical trials dem-
onstrated that, by lowering lipid lev-
els, individuals with diabetes can sub-
stantially reduce the risk of developing
cardiovascular disease.15 Moreover, in
1998, diabetes was identified as a risk
factor for cardiovascular disease equiva-
lent to having preexisting coronary ar-
tery disease.41 The ADA guidelines on
management of lipid disorders issued
in 1993 were revisited in 1998 based
on these new data42 and the American
Heart Association43 and the NCEP20 also
subsequently issued guidelines for lipid
management in diabetes. Thus the im-
provement in total cholesterol levels ob-
served in NHANES 1999-2000 oc-
curred on the cusp of new data showing
the benefits of lowering lipid levels, and
further reductions in total cholesterol
levels may be anticipated in the future
as a result of dissemination of the new
guidelines.
Progress in improving risk factors for
vascular disease among individuals with
diagnosed diabetes in the United States
over nearly a decade has been modest.
While there has been increased aware-
ness among physicians and individuals
with diabetes of the use of HbA1c
levels
to monitor glycemic control,23 only
37.0% of adults with diagnosed diabe-
tes in the United States are achieving the
ADA goal of HbA1c
levels less than 7.0%.
In addition, 37.2% of adults with diag-
nosed diabetes have HbA1c
levels greater
than 8.0%, the level of additional treat-
ment action suggested by the ADA. Al-
though the percentage of adults with di-
agnosed diabetes and diagnosed
hypertension who use blood pressure
medication has increased in the past de-
cade, only 35.8% of individuals with di-
agnosed diabetes have achieved the cur-
rent ADA blood pressure goal of less
than 130/80 mm Hg and only 36.6%
achieved the ADA goal set in 1995
(130/85 mm Hg); 40.4% have hyper-
tensive blood pressure levels. Finally, al-
though the percentage of adults with di-
agnosed high cholesterol levels has
increased and twice as many of these
adults report taking medication for their
high cholesterol in NHANES 1999-
2000 compared with NHANES III
(1988-1994), more than half the indi-
viduals with diagnosed diabetes have
total cholesterol levels greater than 200
mg/dL(5.18mmol/L).Theincreaseduse
of medication to control high choles-
terol levels and high blood pressure has
not been accompanied by attention to
lifestyle change; fewer adults with dia-
betesreporteatinglessfattocontrolcho-
lesterolthanapproximatelyadecadeago,
and there has been no change in the use
of weight control or exercise to control
lipid levels or blood pressure. Due to the
small sample size, we were unable to
stratify the analysis by previously diag-
nosed high blood pressure or high cho-
lesterol levels.
Biological and behavioral character-
istics of individuals with diagnosed dia-
betes are likely to affect control of risk
factors for vascular disease. The ear-
lier age at diagnosis of diabetes in
NHANES 1999-2000 may reflect an ear-
lier onset of disease or may be due to
increased screening for undiagnosed
diabetes leading to individuals being di-
agnosed at an earlier point in the dis-
ease pathway. This earlier age at diag-
nosis corresponded to a significantly
longer duration of diabetes in 1999-
2000. The longer duration might also
reflect increased longevity due to bet-
ter treatment. The increase in BMI of
adults with diagnosed diabetes in the
United States over nearly a decade mir-
rors the increase in prevalence of over-
weight and obesity in the US popula-

tion as a whole.44 Both longer duration
of diabetes and increased BMI are likely
to correspond to higher levels of gly-
cemia, blood pressure, and choles-
terol; however, these levels did not ap-
pear to increase over the past decade.
This may be due in part to the greater
use of medications for control of blood
glucose levels, blood pressure, and cho-
lesterol levels that was observed in
NHANES 1999-2000. Thus, although
progress toward achieving guidelines
for therapy has been disappointing,
maintenance of levels of HbA1c
con-
trol, in the face of increased BMI and
duration of diabetes, may reflect inten-
sification of therapy. The greater im-
provement in cholesterol levels com-
pared with glycemic control may reflect
differences in the complexity of the
medical regimens for these condi-
tions, as well as the earlier initiation and
broader dissemination of messages from
the NCEP compared with the NDEP.
These factors could influence both pre-
scription of and adherence to therapy.
A major limitation of this study is the
small number of participants with di-
agnosed diabetes in NHANES 1999-
2000, which limits analyses by sub-
groups, specifically by age, race/
ethnicity, or treatment group. In
addition, the surveys only include non-
institutionalized adults. There were
68500 residents with a diagnosis of dia-
betes in nursing homes in 199545 and
81700 residents in 1999.46 We have no
information on risk factors for vascu-
lar disease among these individuals with
diagnosed diabetes. In addition, the
NHANES surveys are cross-sectional in
design. Although we can draw infer-
ences on trends among participants
withdiagnoseddiabetes,differentadults
participated in each survey and there-
fore we cannot draw conclusions on
temporal relationships of observa-
tions.
Rapidly increasing rates of type 2 dia-
betes in the United States have been at-
tributed to aging of the population, in-
creased prevalence of overweight and
obesity, and decreased physical activ-
ity.47,48 We recently reported49 and show
here a slight trend for an increase in the
overall prevalence of previously diag-
nosed diabetes among adults aged 20
years and older, although the change
was not significantly different. The lack
of a statistically significant increase in
the prevalence of previously diag-
nosed diabetes in NHANES 1999-
2000 could be due to the small sample
size of the survey. The 95% confi-
dence interval for the change in the
prevalence of diagnosed diabetes be-
tween the 2 surveys ranges from a de-
crease of 0.34 percentage points to an
increase of 1.98 percentage points. The
estimated prevalence of diagnosed dia-
betes in NHANES 1999-2000 is simi-
lar in magnitude to that obtained by the
National Health Interview Survey
(prevalence of 5.9% for persons aged
18 years in 2000), which interviews
a much larger number of participants
resulting in more precise estimates.50
The cost of providing care for dia-
betes and its complications in the
United States is rapidly increasing and
was estimated at $132 billion annu-
ally in 2002.2 The failure to achieve rec-
ommended levels of control of vascu-
lar risk factors, coupled with the rise
in type 2 diabetes and its occurrence in
individuals at earlier ages--which in-
creases the risk of duration-depen-
dent vascular complications--have
ominous implications for the future
burden of morbidity, mortality, and
health care costs associated with dia-
betes.
The increased awareness of the im-
portance of controlling risk factors for
vascular disease among adults with dia-
betes has led to national programs such
as the "Control the ABCs" (for which
A, B, and C indicate HbA1c
, blood pres-
sure, and cholesterol, respectively) cam-
paign by the NDEP37 and the Diabetes
Quality Improvement Project.51 While
these programs represent important
steps toward improving the quality of
diabetes care, further measures are
needed to reduce the large proportion
of adults with diagnosed diabetes in the
United States who continue to have
high levels of blood glucose, blood pres-
sure, and total cholesterol. Ongoing
monitoring and measurement of the
quality of care, empowering clinicians
with medical decision-support tools and
patients with information to improve
the quality of care they receive, and
building incentives for providing com-
prehensive care into the health care de-
livery system52 are essential to trans-
lating into practice the therapies that
have been proven effective in reduc-
ing the risk of vascular disease in indi-
viduals with diabetes.
