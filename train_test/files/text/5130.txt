The newest rules for global trade
After years of opaque negotiations, the Trans-Pacific
Partnership, or TPP, was signed on 5 October 2015 by
twelve Pacific-Rim countries. The TPP represents a notable
development in global trade and has attracted much atten-
tion, but it is far from the first preferential trade agreement
(PTA) for any of the dozen signatories. Indeed, each coun-
try has signed multiple other PTAs over the past decade.
Thus we set out to compare the TPP to the many agree-
ments signed before it in order to reveal where the contents
in the TPP come from and which member(s) played the
greatest role in crafting the agreement.
As the most high-profile trade agreement in years, the
TPP could establish important guidelines for global trade
moving forward. This agenda-setting rationale is empha-
sized by leaders across the membership, including President
Obama, who professes the following logic: "...the TPP
means that America will write the rules of the road in the
21st century...if America doesn't write those rules--then
countries like China will" (Obama, 2015). This raises an
important but thus far unanswered question: whose vision
for modern trade agreements does the TPP best reflect?
Dictating new rules is an important way for states to exer-
cise influence on the global stage, and the answers to this
question can inform general debates about whether interna-
tional institutions are driven by powerful states and how
ideas spread globally.
We evaluate the TPP in a new way by systematically
comparing the recently-released text of the TPP to the lan-
guage in previous trade agreements that its members have
signed. Our text-as-data analyses reveal that the language
in the TPP comes disproportionately from US trade agree-
ments. The ten PTAs that most closely resemble the TPP
are all US agreements, and the contents of the most contro-
versial chapters in the TPP draw heavily from US PTAs.
Who wrote the rules for the
Trans-Pacific Partnership?

Abstract
Twelve governments recently signed the much-anticipated Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), sparking heated debate about
its merits. As a primary motivation for this first "mega-regional" agreement, US President Barack Obama argues that the
TPP is a way for the USA, and not China or someone else, to write the global trade rules of the future. This begs some
important questions, namely which country or countries really did write most of the TPP and thus whose agenda for
21st century trade might it advance? To answer these questions, we compare the recently-released text of the TPP to
the language in the 74 previous trade agreements that TPP members signed since 1995. Our text-as-data analyses reveal
that the contents of the TPP are taken disproportionately from earlier US trade agreements. The ten preferential trade
agreements (PTAs) that most closely match the TPP are all US PTAs. Moreover, the contents of controversial chapters,
such as the one on investment, are drawn even more heavily from past US treaty language. Our study and findings apply
power-based accounts of international institutions to a landmark new agreement, and portray a more active, template-
based process of international diffusion.

These findings provide an important new example of how
powerful states use international institutions strategically to
advance their interests (Drezner, 2007). They also suggest a
more active global diffusion story (Solingen, 2012) ­ one in
which countries have competing blueprints for what should
be included in international agreements and work actively
to insert their preferred rules into landmark treaties.
The evolution of the TPP
The TPP resulted from a decade-long process in which par-
ticipation gradually expanded. The first major development
was the signing in 2005 of the Trans-Pacific Strategic
Economic Partnership Agreement by New Zealand,
Singapore, Chile, and Brunei. In 2008 the USA entered into
negotiations with these four, all of whom were joined later
that year by Australia, Peru and Vietnam. Over the next five
years the advancing TPP negotiations were joined by
Malaysia (2010), Canada and Mexico (2012), and ulti-
mately Japan (2013). The TPP is intended as a "living
agreement," meaning that any future TPP members ­
including China ­ would be asked to sign the agreement as
is, thus accepting what the original signatories have speci-
fied. This makes the language in the TPP critically impor-
tant for the future.
For years our knowledge of the TPP was based on con-
jecture, unofficial comments from participants, and the
release via Wikileaks of controversial draft chapters. But
since the negotiated text was released on 5 November
2015, the entire agreement has been publicly available to
researchers and observers. Particularly notable are compet-
ing studies of the agreement's macroeconomic effects, with
the pro-trade Peterson Institute for International Economics
concluding that the TPP would boost wages and exports
(Petri and Plummer, 2016) and a study by Tufts University's
Global Development and Environment Institute predicting
lower wages and significant job losses (Capaldo et al.,
2016). Other studies emphasize the mostly-positive effects
in selected sectors (Peterson Institute for International
Economics, 2016) or negative effects in others (Powell
et al., 2016). The investment chapter, particularly the
section on investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), has
attracted considerable attention, nearly all of it negative
and from organizations that long have been critical on these
issues (e.g. Bernasconi-Osterwalder, 2015; Johnson and
Sachs, 2015). We take a different approach toward answer-
ing our question about the TPP, by analyzing the entire
agreement using a novel and unbiased methodology.
The TPP needs to be placed in the context of the many
bilateral and plurilateral trade agreements negotiated since
the World Trade Organization (WTO) was established in
1994. Given the continued gridlock in WTO trade negotia-
tions, preferential agreements like the TPP have become a
way for states to advance trade cooperation with willing
partners beyond their WTO commitments (Mansfield and
Reinhardt, 2003). As the first "mega-regional" agreement,
the TPP could become the new standard for all future trade
agreements ­ and perhaps the basis for any future multilat-
eral negotiations at the WTO. Therefore, the country or
countries that had the greatest hand in writing the TPP
could see their influence magnified if the contents of the
TPP become the standard legal text and spread into future
agreements. This dynamic suggests that countries like the
USA can dictate future trade cooperation if they dominate
emergent institutions like the TPP (e.g. Barnett and Duvall,
2005; Drezner, 2009).
Comparing the TPP to previous PTAs
Comparing the TPP to pre-existing PTAs is facilitated by
the fact that WTO-era PTAs are structured similarly and
typically address the same issues. The TPP is broad with its
30 chapters, yet nearly all existing PTAs involving TPP
members also include chapters on issues such as dispute
settlement, antidumping, safeguards, and general services.
Most also include TPP-parallel chapters on electronic com-
merce, financial services, investment, and intellectual prop-
erty, among others.
At the same time, we emphasize that the many PTAs
signed by TPP members exhibit considerable heterogeneity
­ particularly from one country to the next ­ and there is
scant evidence of a common template. As an important
foundational step we compare the pre-existing PTAs of
TPP members to one another using our primary text-com-
parison methodology, which we describe more fully in the
next section.1 The heat map in Figure 1, which is organized
by TPP members, depicts the relationships between each of
these 74 PTAs.2 Most apparent is the overall lack of simi-
larity among them ­ with the vast majority of the cells in
the heat map indicating less than 25% shared content
between pairs of PTAs.3 Also note that the few Chinese and
European Union PTAs represented in Figure 1 have little
overlap with the other PTAs, thus validating claims that the
global economic powers have different visions for trade
cooperation. The only areas in Figure 1 that exhibit signifi-
cant similarity are those that compare PTAs including the
same TPP member, which are clustered along the diagonal.
US PTAs, in particular, have a high degree of internal con-
sistency, indicating that the USA pursues its interests in
negotiations by reusing preferred language. Thus we con-
clude that earlier PTAs signed by TPP members are quite
distinct, with some individual TPP members inserting cer-
tain core contents in all of their PTAs.
That governments bring a preferred template with them
to trade negotiations is a view held widely by scholars and
practitioners (Allee and Lugg, 2016; Arbia, 2013) and is
consistent with journalistic accounts of the TPP negotia-
tions (DePillis, 2015). Therefore, we assume that on bal-
ance each TPP member's previous PTAs represent its
revealed preferences; that is, what it would like to see, or
Allee and Lugg 3
at a minimum would be comfortable with, in any new
agreement. This assumption is bolstered by the earlier
revelation that a country's own PTAs often overlap sig-
nificantly, and by existing research which holds that coun-
tries frequently use past PTAs as a model for future ones
(Allee and Elsig, 2015). As a starting point we assume all
of a country's PTAs since 1995 could serve as a template,
but later we prioritize selected agreements for each coun-
try as possible templates.
To determine which members had the greatest hand in
writing the TPP, we evaluate the concordance between the
language in each member's past PTAs (over the past two
decades) and the language in the final text of the TPP.
Comparing texts in this manner is appropriate, since much
of the TPP negotiations centered on whose preferred lan-
guage would be adopted. Text analysis is increasingly
used in the social sciences (e.g. Grimmer and Stewart,
2013) and we argue that it is particularly appropriate for
analyzing deliberate, written content such as treaties ­
where precise wording and legal interpretation are crucial
(Manger and Peinhardt, 2016, Spirling, 2012). It also
allows us to evaluate the entire TPP text, which others
have not done, and to measure the contents of particular
TPP chapters in a more comprehensive way than can be
done with numeric coding.4
Our central proposition is that past agreement language
from the most powerful TPP members, particularly the
USA, should be pre-eminent in the TPP. The USA is the
largest actor in terms of market size, entered negotiations
early, and has many past PTAs from which to borrow lan-
guage. This expectation of US influence is inspired by a
well-established literature which maintains that powerful
states design international institutions in ways that serve
their interests (e.g. Drezner, 2007; Gruber, 2000). In this

power-centered portrayal of international institutions,
prominent examples of international cooperation, such as
the TPP, occur because key actors view such initiatives as a
meanstoadvancetheirgoals(e.g.Gilpin,1987;Morgenthau,
1978). This was evident two decades ago with the estab-
lishment of the WTO (Steinberg, 2002; Stone, 2011), but
has not been applied to recent trade institutions such as the
TPP. Thus we investigate this prominent logic in a contem-
porary, relevant, and consequential context.
Data and methodology
Because we are interested in the extent to which actors
obtained their preferred content in the TPP, we first compile
and prepare the texts of the relevant trade agreements, start-
ing with the recently-released text of the TPP.5 Next we uti-
lize the Design of Trade Agreements project and website
(Dür et al., 2014) and WTO Trade Agreements Gateway to
identify all PTAs signed by TPP members since 1995, a
period that provides a sufficient time-window for compari-
son but also ensures that comparisons are among modern,
new-generation agreements. There are 74 such PTAs, all of
which have official versions in English. To facilitate con-
sistent comparison, we eliminate idiosyncratic information
at the beginning and end of agreements (signed dates and
locations, pronouncements, etc.), convert all text to lower-
case, and remove punctuation.
Several features of our study lead us to eschew the bag-
of-words approach to analyzing speech and text, which dis-
regards text order and is often deployed inductively.6 First,
the structure of our analysis is dictated by theory and known
to us ex ante, since we want to compare the TPP with a
specific collection of possible source PTAs. Second, the
order of text is important, since we are analyzing carefully-
crafted agreement language that is laid out in a deliberate
structure. Likewise, the precise wording of the text also
matters because even small differences in text can have a
profound effect on legal interpretation (Spirling, 2012).
Therefore, we adopt a methodology that computes tex-
tual similarity for any two documents ­ in our case the
TPP and each of the 74 existing PTAs ­ by identifying
perfectly-matching text in common word sequences
greater than six words.7 Relying on common 6-grams or
greater allows us to preserve important information con-
tained in word order and ensures that simple, everyday
phrases do not constitute a match.8 This approach, and
these same metrics, have been used in other social-science
applications (e.g. Corley et al., 2011; Ehsbaugh-Soha,
2013). For each PTA­TPP pairing we generate the num-
ber of perfectly matching words, which we then divide by
the total words in the PTA to produce a "percentage cop-
ied" number that is comparable across agreements. We
also aggregate these agreement percentages at the country
level, to see which of the 12 members was most successful
in getting its preferred contents in the TPP.
The prominence of US language in the
TPP
Our analyses reveal that US treaty language is pre-eminent
in the TPP, suggesting that the USA had heavy influence in
writing this important new agreement. Figure 2 depicts the
existing PTAs of TPP members that have the most lan-
guage replicated in the TPP. The prevalence of US agree-
ments, highlighted with blue dots, is striking. The ten
closest-match agreements all include the USA, with none
of the other TPP members achieving anything close to the
same level of "success" in penetrating the TPP. The US
agreements at the very top of Figure 2, which include bilat-
eral PTAs with Bahrain, Oman, and South Korea, each
have about 50% of their contents that can be found verba-
tim in the TPP. TPP members Peru, Australia, and Chile
enter into the top fifteen ­ but only by virtue of their agree-
ments with the USA.
To obtain a better sense of what is being taken from past
PTAs, we present in theAppendix a few side-by-side exam-
ples from actual PTA texts, which come from different PTA
chapters (intellectual property, investment, and telecommu-
nications). First note that the common text across PTAs (in
red) is overwhelmingly substantive as compared to generic.
Moreover, large sections of TPP language are copied en
masse from earlier US PTAs. The TPP text highlighted in
the left column also can be found verbatim in the parallel
US agreements on the right ­ whether those with Bahrain
and Colombia (intellectual property), Oman and Panama
(investment), or Peru (telecommunications). By compari-
son, the non-US agreements share more limited (Malaysia­
Pakistan, and Singapore­European Community) or
incomplete (Peru­European Community­Colombia, and
Peru­Japan) amounts of text in common with the TPP.
The evidence thus far indicates that the TPP draws
heavily from US agreements, yet we investigate further
from a country-by-country perspective. For each TPP
member, we calculate the average percentage of its text
that is replicated in the TPP across the various 74 PTAs to
which it is a signatory. These country-averages appear in
Figure 3. As expected, the USA leads by a substantial mar-
gin. On average, nearly 45% of the text of US PTAs from
1995­2015 can be found verbatim in the TPP. This far out-
paces the percentages for those next on the list, Australia,
Canada, and Peru, who see just over 30% of their past PTA
contents in the TPP. Most others are in the mid-20% range,
including Japan, which is somewhat surprisingly next-to-
last on the list, and Mexico, which is at the bottom.9
Furthermore, the results of systematic statistical tests con-
firm that the USA is distinct from all other TPP signatories
in terms of the amount of language from their previous
PTAs that was copied into the TPP.10
The country patterns in Figure 3, and the unique role of
the USA, are robust to different methods of comparison
(see Table 1). The country-level averages above compare
Allee and Lugg 5
all of a country's past PTAs (since 1995) to the TPP, but
now we utilize only those PTAs that might best reflect a
country's current preferences toward trade agreements.
First we compare only each country's most recent (since
2005) PTAs to the TPP. These overlap percentages with
the TPP increase slightly for the USA and nearly every-
one, as one might expect (Table 1, column 3).11 Next we
consider three additional methods to isolate the PTAs that
might best reflect each country's trade preferences. We
re-calculate the TPP-overlap averages for Peru, Chile,
Australia, and Singapore after removing their bilateral
agreements with the USA ­ and their averages drop by
2­3%. Next we eliminate any past PTAs that were signed
with a fellow TPP member, where preferences could be
conflated. These numbers (in the fourth column) remain
largely stable, although they drop notably for Peru, Chile,

and Malaysia. Lastly, we include only those PTAs in
which the country was the dominant partner; that is, had
the largest gross domestic product among the PTA mem-
bers. For most countries this pushes the TPP-overlap per-
centagesmodestlyhigher.Finally,werelaxtherequirement
of perfectly-matching text and instead allow highly simi-
lar language to count as matching. The resulting compari-
son percentages (presented in the final column in Table 1)
trend upward by 2­3%.12 Across the varied comparisons
in Table 1, then, the rankings and intervals are stable and
depict a strong US role in writing the TPP.
We also pursue more focused comparisons in which we
compare chapters of the PTAs directly to corresponding
chapters in the TPP. We conduct these comparisons for fif-
teen chapters commonly found in PTAs ­ all of which are
included in the TPP. Table 2 lists these chapters and pre-
sents the findings for each of them. Once again, US suprem-
acy is apparent. For 11 of the 15 chapters analyzed, US
language is the most successful; that is, a greater
percentage of content from US PTAs makes its way into the
TPP. For the remaining four chapters, the USA has the sec-
ond-highest percentage.
The six most-copied chapters in the TPP (investment,
financial services, general services, telecommunications,
and safeguards) draw particularly heavily upon past US
agreement language. This includes some TPP chapters in
which two-thirds or more of an earlier US PTA chapter is
copied verbatim. Although substantially behind the USA,
Australia tends to be next in line in terms of its agreements'
presence in various TPP chapters (highest percentage on
environmental provisions, and second-highest percentage
on several other issues). Peruvian PTAs are surprisingly
present in the TPP, too (highest average percentage content
on procurement and electronic commerce).
Interestingly, US content is most prevalent in the TPP in
the areas of greatest importance to US political and economic
interests. A Congressional Research Service (CRS) report
claims that: "(a) high priority for the USA in its negotiations
of bilateral and regional free trade agreements has been
increased market access for services providers, especially
financial services" (Fergusson et al., 2015: 17). Indeed, gen-
eral services and financial services are among the chapters
with the highest percentage of US content in the TPP, at 62%
and 68% on average, respectively. In fact, 72% of the general
services language in the 2006 US agreement with Colombia
can be found in the TPP, and six US PTAs have more than
70% of their financial services content that is copied into the
parallel chapter of the TPP. Furthermore, labor is another
area highlighted in the CRS report (Fergusson et al., 2015:
38­40) and US agreements score highest in this area too (see
Table 2). Importantly, many of the above are areas in which
there is less consensus at the WTO, which makes the impact
of writing the rules in these areas potentially greatest.
The most striking result in Table 2, however, concerns
the agreement language on investment. As noted earlier,
selected parts of the TPP's investment chapter have attracted
substantial attention and controversy. Investment is widely

considered among the most important chapters of the TPP
and long has been "a high priority for the USA in its FTA
negotiations" (Fergusson et al., 2015: 36). We consider the
contents of the entire chapter, not just the subset on ISDS,
and find that a staggering 80% of the language from past US
PTA chapters on investment is included in the TPP's invest-
ment chapter, as depicted in the left side of Figure 4 (and
also Table 2). This is by far the highest percentage for the
USA or any other TPP member across any chapter. Indeed,
more than 80% of seven US investment chapters are copied
verbatim into the TPP's investment chapter, as shown in the
right side of Figure 4. One of the text illustrations in the
Appendix, on minimum standards of treatment for
investment, also shows this dominance. Furthermore, the
amount of text being copied is significant: more than 7500
words from past US investment chapters are written directly
into the TPP's investment chapter ­ a final piece of evidence
that the US "got what it wanted" in this controversial area to
an extent even greater than is realized.
Conclusion
Text analysis is increasingly popular in the social sciences,
and the methodology is particularly valuable when the text
being analyzed is consequential and deliberate. The TPP is
both. Our research represents a new approach toward studying

the TPP as well as international cooperation generally. It pro-
vides much-needed context by showing that the TPP is best
thought of as a competition among members to insert their
vision for trade cooperation into an important new agreement.
The TPP and other PTAs are lengthy and wide-ranging docu-
ments, and we provide a new way to quantify them, and their
most important parts, in their entirety.
Our findings regarding the sizeable US role in writing the
TPP have implications for several literatures. To begin, we
suggest that international diffusion is not always passive or
due to mimicry, but instead can occur because governments
actively champion a particular blueprint for international
cooperation. Whose model prevails in negotiations is deter-
mined largely by bargaining power. Thus notable initiatives
like the TPP cannot be separated from power politics and
their geopolitical context. Looked at in this way, the TPP is
best thought of as an attempt by the USA to shift trade coop-
eration away from the deadlocked WTO to a new venue
where it can successfully write the trade rules for the future.
This agenda-setting motivation is central to understanding
the TPP, and it will be interesting to observe whether PTAs in
the near future draw heavily upon the language in the TPP.
Lastly, our findings provide new information to inform
long-standing debates about the trade regime and imminent
debates about TPP ratification. We have shown that modern
PTAs are quite heterogeneous. The TPP represents an inter-
esting amalgam of its members' priorities ­ since a certain
amount of past language from each can be found in the new
agreement. Perhaps this suggests some movement toward
convergence of trade rules. Yet it appears that any future con-
vergence will be on US terms. We can say with confidence
that the USA took a lead role in writing these newest trade
rules, both overall and on the most controversial and unset-
tled issues. What remains to be seen is whether the TPP is
ratified and where global trade cooperation advances next.

Notes
 1. See the discussion in the `Data and methodology' section for
details on how the texts are compared to one another.
2. We organize the preferential trade agreements (PTAs) in
the heat map by country, beginning with the Trans-Pacific
Partnership (TPP) member with the largest gross domestic
product (GDP) (the USA) down to the member with the
smallest GDP (Brunei). In the cases where an existing PTA
includes more than one TPP member, we include it for the
member with the larger GDP.
 3. The average similarity is less than 18%, and three-quarters
of the dyads among these 74 preferential trade agreements
contain less than 25% of overlapping text.
 4. Efforts such as the Design of Trade Agreements project (Dür
et al., 2014) represent a major advance because they unpack
preferential trade agreements (PTAs) and code their contents
with dozens of numeric variables. But even well-conceived
numeric codings can be unavoidably blunt, capturing things
such as whether a PTA has a particular chapter, without being
able to distinguish the fine-grained details of what is in those
chapters.
5. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) text is taken from the
website of the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs
and Trade, which has cleaned and verified the entire agree-
ment (http://www.tpp.mfat.govt.nz/text). Since the TPP is
presented by chapter, we also create a single document that
combines the text from across the various TPP chapters and
thus represents the "full text" of the TPP.
 6. The bag-of-words assumption emphasizes the frequency with
which terms appear across a set of documents and does not take
word order into account. This approach is common in data min-
ing and text analysis applications where the goal is topic mod-
eling, sentiment analysis, or the inductive discovery of author
ideal points (see Manning et al., 2008; Spirling, 2012).
7. To do so, we utilize Wcopyfind 4.1.4, a program written by
Bloomfield (2014). The source code can be found at: http://pla-

8. Most common phrases are shorter than six words and thus
are not counted. However, even longer common phrases
such as "This article is without prejudice to" would comprise
only 0.006% (6/100,000) of a document containing 100,000
words, a typical length for a preferential trade agreement.
9. Although a detailed explanation of these other-country
trends is beyond of the scope of this paper, one possibility
for Japan and Mexico is that their low percentages are due to
them joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership late.

indicate a statistically significant difference between the
average amount of text replicated across the Trans-Pacific
Partnership signatories. Furthermore, post-hoc analyses
using Tukey's honest significant difference test confirm that
the difference between the mean total of replicated text by
the USA is higher than all 11 pairwise mean comparisons
(all p-values < 0.02). See the explanatory note associated

11. Brunei and Vietnam are omitted from Table 1 because their
original percentages are unchanged across the different com-
parison criteria.
12. We allow up to 5 imperfections in the text as long as these
imperfections do not account for more than 80% of the text
in a matching sequence. For example, if a world is mis-
spelled or pluralized it will be skipped over to match adja-
cent, perfectly-matching text.
