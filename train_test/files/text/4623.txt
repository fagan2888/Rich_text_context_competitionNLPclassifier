Introduction
I have a secret, I have a secret. [cries] We don't talk about it. . . .
It's not diabetes where you need regular treatment, and it's not
TERT syndrome or any other known syndrome. The very fact
that it's not spoken about means that I have a secret--a secret
I'm aware of because it wasn't repaired from birth and I had to
live on pills. I'm telling you that from birth they hooked me up
to a "respirator" that I can only be disconnected from when I'm
18. (Or, November 6, 2009)
Hearing this testimony represented a foundational,
insightful moment for me as a person who has been research-
ing the intersexed body for the past 7 years. This was the
moment at which I first understood the significance and pro-
found power of the secret in the everyday living experience
of many intersexed people. I had known that intersexed peo-
ple were told lies and lived with secrecy (Chase, 1998; Cote,
2000; Ford, 2000; Harper, 2007; Holmes, 2002, 2008;
Preves, 2003), yet, even when for years the secret and secrecy
surrounding intersexed people made it difficult for me to col-
lect research data and contact intersexed people and parents
of intersexed children and adults in Israel, I accepted this
situation as a given, assuming that the phenomenon itself
was an extremely private matter, kept within the confines of
hospitals to maintain patients' privacy.1 But when Or cried
and explained how the secret controls and damages her social
and familial life and how suicidal thoughts ran through her
head, I realized that I needed to reframe the secret as a force-
ful social agent that threatens the very being of intersexed
people. In my doctoral dissertation Meoded Danon, 2012), I
examined the ways in which the secret is a significant part of
the medical treatment of intersexed people in Israel and other
countries (Audi, 2014; Karkazis, 2008; Kerry, 2008) and
explored the ways in which the secret is reproduced by par-
ents of intersexed children and becomes part of family lives.
In this article, I focus on the embodied particular experi-
ence of the secret in the narratives of three intersexed adults.
I chose to focus on only three narratives to explore in depth
each individual's experience of living with an intersexed
body and the secret that surrounds it. While every participant
in this study experienced the powerful secrecy that surrounds
their bodies and is manifested in the complexity of the body/
secret relationship, the narratives of these three participants
in particular highlight the complexity of living with the
secret and secrecy as well as the practice of body/secrecy in
familial, medical, and personal relations. Hence, I chose to
focus on each of these narratives to reveal the particular,
unique living experiences that they portray.
In these narratives, the motifs of secrets and secrecy are
prominent, as they are in narrative studies and other kinds of
studies that focus on the life experiences of intersexed peo-
ple. Secrets and secrecy characterize both treatment policies
and the behavior of the parents of intersexed people, thus
comprising an integral element in their life stories. Secrets

The Body/Secret Dynamic: Life
Experiences of Intersexed People in Israel
Limor Meoded Danon1
Abstract
Intersexed subjects experience their bodies through the repercussions of treatment policies implemented in their bodies at
birth and throughout their lives. Secrets and secrecy comprise a major element of the treatment policy toward intersexed
subjects in Israel and act as a disciplining and normalizing force in the life experience of intersexed subjects. This article
presents case studies of intersexed adults, subjects through whom we can learn about both historical and contemporary
treatment policy toward intersexed people as well as about the perpetual conflict between the particular corporeal existence
of individuals and the experience of the secret and secrecy in their lives. The purpose of this article is to shed light on the
dynamics that exist between the secret and intersexed bodies and the paradoxical consequences of body/secret relations.

and secrecy encourage stigma, shame, low self-esteem, lone-
liness, lack of trust in others, difficulty in creating intimate
relationships, and a host of other problems (Feder, 2006;
Karkazis, 2008; Kerry, 2008, Meoded Danon, 2012, 2014;
Lev, 2006; Preves, 2003). Paradoxically, treatment policies
have historically attempted to prevent these negative phe-
nomena, so they have often attempted to normalize the body
through surgery and hormones, tailoring it to one of the two
typical sexes/genders: male/female, man/woman.
The moment of discovering the secret, that is, their par-
ticular "intersex" physical condition and their treatment his-
tory, was perceived by intersexed people as a significant,
life-changing event that not only legitimized their emotions
both in the past and in the present but also opened many
questions and left them with a great deal of anger and frustra-
tion toward their doctors and parents, who had concealed
information from them. Studies of the life experience of
intersexed people, such as those of Sharon Preves (2003),
Katrina Karkazis (2008), and Stephen Kerry (2008), have
often related to the intersexed body as a discursive, medical
body, a passive product of biomedical science. Unlike previ-
ous studies, this one aims to demonstrate how the material
intersexed body, like any other human body, is dynamic, and
senses, experiences, and even opposes attempts to normalize
it in its own unique ways. Moreover, this study describes the
complex relationship between the body and the secret and
reveals how the secret is experienced as a foreign object that
the body cannot tolerate. It also interrogates the ways in
which the secret is established in the body and its effects on
the embodied subject, and explores what causes intersexed
people to feel alienation from their lives in general and their
bodies in particular.
The existence of the intersexed body and the act of keep-
ing it secret have been linked, in an institutionalized manner,
through the traditional protocol2 outlined by Johns Hopkins
Hospital in the 1950s. At the time, John Money and his col-
leagues were conducting pioneering clinical and psychologi-
cal studies on "hermaphroditism,"3 and were considered the
leading authorities on the subject. The Johns Hopkins profes-
sionals believed that gender role and gender identity (Gender
R/I) should establish and guide the treatment policy of "her-
maphrodite" children. According to this perception, the core
problem of "hermaphrodite" adults was being assigned to the
"wrong gender," which caused social alienation, stigma, and
psychopathological problems. Hence, they claimed, her-
maphrodite children should be assigned a coherent gender
role as early as possible (no later than 18 months of age), and
raised in accordance with it, while those with ambiguous
external genitalia should undergo surgical correction. Money
and his associates asserted that normal looking external geni-
tals are more crucial than chromosomes, gonads, and internal
and other sexual characteristics for establishing a "normal"
gender role/identity (Money, 1955; Money, Hampson, &
Hampson, 1955, 1957). The Johns Hopkins medical team
focused on diminishing and concealing bodily ambiguity as
quickly as possible, which would allow "hermaphrodite"
children to be socially accepted and unstigmatized. In fact,
Money et al. (1955) encouraged doctors to "talk frankly"
with hermaphrodite children, and claimed that "truth is sel-
dom as distressing as the mystery of the unknown" (p. 294).
Theoretically, they argued in their article that "hermaphro-
dite" children should not be kept in the dark regarding their
physical state, but, unfortunately, we revealed that only four
decades later, there is a tremendous gap between their theory
and the actual realities of intersexed people.
Since the 1990s, much criticism has been voiced against
the "Money Protocol," especially regarding the problematic
connection between gender identity and the "true sex" of
intersexed people. For example, Suzanne Kessler claimed
that Money and his colleague evaluated penis size ("a good-
sized penis") as the sole condition for raising a newborn as a
boy. Chromosomes and other physiological characteristics
were less relevant than penis size, so babies with penises
smaller than the ideal of the medical staff, with hypospadias,
with XY46 sex chromosomes and testes were forced to
undergo "corrective" genital surgery and raised as girls
(Kessler, 1990, pp. 12-13). Anne Fausto-Sterling (1993)
argued in her pioneering article "The Five Sexes: Why Male
and Female Are Not Enough" that the biomedical profes-
sionals at Johns Hopkins disciplined intersexed bodies
according to stereotypical gender norms, instead of seriously
and deeply studying the many (at least five) sexes of the
human body. In the summer of 1993, soon after the publica-
tion of "The Five Sexes," Sheryl Chase, an intersexed activ-
ist, established the Intersex Society of North America
(ISNA), the first organized group of intersexed activists.
Chase, like most ISNA members, had been treated and oper-
ated on according to the "Money protocol," for 60 years,
which was internationally recognized and followed. ISNA
began to voice its criticism of this protocol on the Internet, in
the popular media, and in literature. The writings presented
in the book Intersex in the Age of Ethics (Dreger, 1999)
brought to light the living experience of many intersexed
people, revealing that they had grown up unaware of their
physical diagnosis and the significance of their physical­
surgical histories, as their physicians and families had lied
and concealed this information from them, and they had to
discover it on their own. For most of them, this discovery
was traumatic. They felt that they had been living a lie for
years and were forced to cope alone with the consequences
both of the surgeries carried out on their bodies, which
caused much physical and emotional damage, including lack
of genital­sexual sensation, and of the revelation of their
bodily secret.As more studies were published and an increas-
ing number of intersexed people revealed their stories, the
secrets and secrecy surrounding their bodies have become
known as a familiar feature of the dominant narrative and an
integral element of traditional treatment policy (Chase, 1998,
2003; Dreger, 1999; Feder, 2002, 2006; Hillman, 2008;
Holmes, 2002; Lev, 2006; Morland, 2001, 2009; Preves,
Meoded Danon 3
1998, 2002, 2003; Sutton et al., 2006). The Chicago
Conference of 2005, organized by the ISNA4 and other inter-
sex advocates and biomedical professionals, aimed to change
the traditional and problematic "Money Protocol." The main
changes of the medical treatment concerned clinical and
pathological nomenclature, with the term Disorder of Sex
Development (DSD) replacing the old terms "hermaphrodit-
ism" and "intersex conditions" (Lee, Christopher, Faisal, &
Leuan, 2006). The new guidelines are more centered on
patients and families. Experts advocate sharing information
on patients' physical condition and treatment with parents,
and the optimal sex/gender of the newborn is determined by
multidisciplinary teams that consider the best interests of
patients and families. Interestingly, these teams do not
include intersexed subjects who could talk about their expe-
riences and the consequences of treatment. Other changes
primarily involve improved biomedical diagnostic technol-
ogy and better surgical techniques (Ganka et al., 2010).
Nonetheless, the new DSD guidelines are still motivated by
concealing bodily ambiguity, especially ambiguous external
genitalia, and assigning "normal" sex/gender to "DSD" chil-
dren. The bodily autonomy of intersexed children is still in
great doubt under the terms of current treatments.
Furthermore, the very term DSD, as Davis (2011) claimed,
"constructs `sex' as a scientific phenomenon" in ways that
maintain biomedical authority over intersexed bodies.5
Theorizing Intersexed Bodies and the
Power of the Secret
"Intersexed" bodies include a broad range of physical states
that challenge the significance, components, and develop-
ment of the sexual body. They comprise various configura-
tions of sex chromosomes and different structures of the
external and internal genitalia. Just as the body cannot be
defined as male or female in a separate, stand-alone category,
and the one always depends on and is compared with the
other, so it is impossible to define and diagnose the inter-
sexed body except in comparison and in relation to typical
female or male bodies. Male and female are sexes that were
established in the past continue to be established by the bio-
social establishment and are not disconnected from cultural
biases and heteronormative perceptions of sex, gender, and
sexuality.
Michael Foucault's (1973, 1990, 1995, 2006) poststructur-
alist discursive view of the human body, established through
power relations (especially the biopower of human science)
and the discipline of knowledge, influenced writers such as
Judith Butler (1990, 1993, 2004), Myra Hird (2004), Anne
Fausto-Sterling (1993, 2000), and others, who challenge the
normative Western discourse on sex and gender categories.
Poststructuralism critiques the notion that sex categories are
natural, claiming that, like other social categories, they are the
result of a discourse based on and formed through power rela-
tions. Biomedical science is not disconnected from social
power relations and a heteronormative perception of gender,
so its research, gaze, and perception of the body are all fil-
tered through language, through a system of meanings that
mark the body as female-feminine or male-masculine. The
paradox is that the normative sexual order is imaginary;
physical-sexual reality is not organized into two unambigu-
ous sexes. Science, in its attempt to characterize or assess the
factors or characteristics of the development of sex in the
body, repeatedly encounters "undesirable" results in bodies
(whether those of mice or people) that challenge its
assumptions.6
In contrast to poststructuralism, which perceives the
human body as "discursive," a product of construction and
social power relations, the phenomenological approach to
the body, established through the work of Maurice Merleau-
Ponty (1978), relates to the "subjective" body, focusing on
corporeal, sensory experience. Merleau-Ponty claims that
our perceptions, consciousness, knowledge, and understand-
ing of the world are manifested through our own bodies,
which are situated in the world as the heart is in the organ-
ism, breathing life into it, carrying it inside itself, and shap-
ing our perception and understanding of the world around us.
In other words, our flesh, our material, sensual body con-
structs our living experience, our being in this world. A phe-
nomenological approach allows us to analyze the experience
of intersexed people through their own feelings, senses, and
ways of adjusting to social norms through their own particu-
lar bodies.
A secret, like a human body, is difficult to define and
frame theoretically. It is elusive and hard to estimate accord-
ing to any measure, because it is multidimensional and mul-
tihued. The secret depends greatly on the different contexts
and social interactions within which it exists. Sissela Bok
notes that the Latin source of the word secrecy (secretum) is
secernere, to separate, to create a kind of boundary between
the external, those who do not know the contents of the
secret, and the internal, those who conceal it (Bok, 1984).
This word actually implies the kind of internal conflict inher-
ent in all secrets. Evan Imber-Black (1998) described differ-
ent types of secrets, including positive ones, which strengthen
interpersonal relationships; negative, toxic ones, which poi-
son relationships, limiting our lives and our ability to make
clear and effective decisions; and dangerous ones, which
pose immediate physical or emotional danger and can cause
damage to others and even lead to suicide (Imber-Black,
1998). These toxic and dangerous secrets are the ones rele-
vant to our context of intersexed people, because they poison
bodily experience and make the existence and experience of
intersexed people extremely difficult. For Georg Simmel
(1906) and Erving Goffman (1963), secrets and secrecy are
positive and essential in social life, and help to protect us
from stigma and keep us from harm while we interact with
others. Simmel describes what he calls the dialectic of the
secret, in which, for example, the secret creates boundaries
and increases diversity among people, but, however, entails
4 SAGE Open
the temptation to break down boundaries and blur differ-
ences, especially when it is revealed. On one hand, the secret
acts as a protective sheath that gives power to those who
know it, but on the other, it produces the tension and danger
associated with its revelation (Simmel, 1906). Unlike
Simmel, Bok (1984) claimed that holders of secrets experi-
ence negative tensions and conflicts that are embodied in
everything they do.
The dynamics of power can be destructive, as Mark
Karpel (1980) explained with regard to family secrets, claim-
ing that holders of secrets have a sort of "nuclear bomb" that
is saved for later use, and the only way to be saved from the
cruel secret and its destructive repercussions is to reveal it (p.
296). In a more particular, practical, embodied way, cogni-
tive researchers such as Julie Lane and Daniel Wegner (1995)
describe the difficulty of keeping a secret, explaining how
much energy and effort we need to expend to manage our
thoughts, our behavior, and especially our body language
when keeping a secret. Paradoxically, the more we try to
conceal it, the more we reveal the existence of the secret,
because techniques for discovering secrets improve over
time and constantly threaten the shell of secrecy, and also
because our own bodies struggle with the secret. To theorize
the relationship between intersexed bodies and the power of
the secret, I embrace both the poststructuralist and the phe-
nomenological approaches to the body and demonstrate the
tension that exists between them. While these two approaches
differ from one another, combining them provides a theoreti-
cal perspective that focuses on the phenomenology of social
power that describes how the subjective body experiences
the power exerted upon it through the agents of social power
in general and the power of the secret in particular. This
approach corresponds with that of Chris Shilling (2005),
who coined the term "corporeal realism" to describe both the
connection between body and society and the distinction
between them. Shilling's approach ignores neither the estab-
lished social forces, their influence on the experience of the
body, nor the body's unique power, development, and mate-
rial traits. Therefore, this article adopts Shilling's perspec-
tive, and both offer an analysis of the power relations that
discipline the body, in our case the intersexed body, and con-
sider the particular bodily experience of individuals and their
reactions to social power relations.
Method and Secrecy
This article is part of a comprehensive study conducted in
Israel between 2005 and 2012. It examined the attitude and
treatment of intersexed people and the life experience of
intersexed adults. It included 22 semistructured interviews
with biomedical and other professionals in Israel. The most
difficult task was to reach intersexed people. Fortunately, a
support group for intersexed people began to operate at the
same time that I started my research). One of the endocri-
nologists gave me their brochure and suggested I speak with
the moderator of this group, who had been born intersexed
and would be happy to help. It took me 3 years to find other
intersexed people for my study. After publishing calls for
participants on various Internet sites and forums, in particu-
lar endocrinology, parenting, and fertility forums, I eventu-
ally made contact with 11 intersexed adults and 7 parents of
intersexed children and adults. All of the names of the par-
ticipants have been changed to maintain their anonymity, and
each of the participants signed a consent form, which
described the purpose of the research, their right to stop and
leave the study at any time, their right to secrecy and ano-
nymity, and my contact information, including phone num-
ber and email address.All the participants chose the locations
and times of their interviews, to ensure a relaxed and pleas-
ant atmosphere. With seven of the intersexed adults, I con-
ducted follow-up interviews to learn more about the changes
in their lives and to examine many aspects and themes that
were absent in the first interview. During the study, I realized
that the secret and secrecy were integral parts of the treat-
ment policy and the life experience of intersexed people, so I
played a role in keeping their secrets. I had to build their trust
in me and provide a comfortable and safe space in which
they could expose their lives to me. To foster their trust, dur-
ing the interviews I informed all the participants about the
various stages of the study, its purpose, and what I had
learned so far.
During the research process, as I conducted the interviews
and analyzed my findings, I used the stages and ideas of
grounded theory (Charmaz, 2006; Corbin & Strauss, 1990).
Grounded theory makes it possible to focus on the dynamics
and changes of the research field, and data from the field
form the core of the theory. The processes of sampling and
finding participants were actually part of the fundamental
theme of this research. Only after several interviews with
intersexed people did I understand that the reason for the
great difficulty involved in finding intersexed people in
Israel was the forceful social agent of the secret. In contrast
to the public activism of intersex support groups in North
America, the United Kingdom, Germany, and other coun-
tries, in Israel this group and intersexuality in general are
shrouded in secrecy. There are few participants, not because
of the number of intersexed people in Israel, but because the
secret surrounding intersexed bodies is reproduced and man-
ifested beyond hospital walls, assimilated into and practiced
in everyday social interaction. There are very few (closed)
group meetings during the year, and there is no critical activ-
ity that challenges the biomedical discourse. As in other
Western countries, the biomedical system in Israel is authori-
tative and asserts its power over intersexed people.
The term I coined to describe the whole treatment process
of intersexed people is "the min-guf process" (Meoded
Danon, 2012). Min in Hebrew means sex, kind, or type. Guf
means body. My term, min-guf, implies both the separation
(the human body is more than the sum of its sexual organs)
and the connection (intersexed bodies treated by the medical
Meoded Danon 5
establishment as unfixed sexual bodies) between sex and
body. In English, it could be understood as "the sexing pro-
cess" or the sexual transformation of the body. I chose this
term to focus on the sex category and its various manifesta-
tions in the human body and on the bodily consequences of
medical treatment. Rather than considering the gender cate-
gory as the main frame for normalizing and disciplining
intersexed people, I claim that sex and gender categories,
much like the body and society (sex­body/gender­society),
are intimately integrated and historically manifested in one
another; that there is no actual, clear line between them.7 The
stages of the min-guf process that intersexed people undergo
throughout their lives embody the blurring of the boundaries
between sex/gender and body/society. These stages include
diagnosing the sexual characteristics of the body, shaping the
body according to one of two typical sexes (female or male),
and performing clinical follow-up of the development of the
body according to its new conditions. The secret is an insepa-
rable part of the min-guf process, as I will describe in the
following three case studies of intersexed adults. Each of
these stories presents a unique example of the problematic
and paradoxical living experience engendered by the min-guf
process, which aims to conceal intersexed bodies. Despite
the fact that the experiences described in these stories took
place decades ago, and biomedical technology in many
countries, including Israel, has changed considerably in the
meantime, the secrets and secrecy surrounding intersexed
bodies still have not changed and continue to exist alongside
urgent physical intervention at a very early age.
Through the stories of the intersexed subjects of this
study, I will explore the ways in which the secret is estab-
lished in the body and examine the dynamics of the secret in
each particular, embodied subject's life. It is important to
emphasize that these stories are not intended to reflect the
life experience of all intersexed people; on the contrary, they
aim to expose the subjective embodied experience of indi-
vidual subjects to emphasize the particular struggles with the
social forces that act on each body. Bodily particularity
informs us, casting doubt on the existence of any universal or
unisexual physicality.
Shai: "A Hospital Child" (August 22,
2008)
Shai was born in Israel in 1955. Despite his age, his body
looks like that of a young boy. Large green eyes illuminate
his face, his hands and feet are small, and he is short. At the
beginning of our meeting, Shai showed me a 1958 medical
document that described his physical diagnosis and the deci-
sions his doctors made about his body. This is the only medi-
cal document Shai has obtained from his own medical file.
Shai does not know about everything that happened to his
body during his childhood and is interested in reading his
medical file, but the hospital where he was treated is conceal-
ing his records, despite his legal right to see them and his
attempts to obtain them. Before I introduce the contents of
the document, let us connect to Shai's experience of child-
hood and adolescence:
I always felt unusual, different, let's say, from infancy, but I
didn't understand why. I looked like a girl. . . . I was in the
hospital all the time, sometimes for long periods, which
automatically makes you feel different. . . . To the outside world
I showed that I was a boy in an extreme way, being the epitome
of what a bad boy was and pushing this to the limit, because I
felt different. . . . For example, from a very young age I felt
attracted to boys, but I realized that it was forbidden, that you
were not allowed to talk about it and no one should know. I used
to play secretly with dolls. I loved playing with dolls.
Social responses to Shai's appearance sometimes led peo-
ple to mistake him for a girl and treat him like one, which
caused him frustration, pain, and a counterreaction that man-
ifested itself in a radicalization of his "boy" behavior. Thus,
his behavior toward the world was extreme, extroverted, and
interpreted by him and those around him as "boyish," in con-
trast to his behavior in his own world, without peer pressure,
where he could express his feelings and desires. His physical
appearance as a boy­girl caused a contradiction, a dialectic
between his inner world and the outside world, as he explains,
You have to understand that all my life I've simply been acting,
and I'm a very, very honest person, so it always bothered me that
I had to act. . . . Outside, I looked different. Even today, when
everyone knows me, they call me "Shai, a man with balls." In
point of fact, I have no balls at all [laughs], "Shai with the ostrich
eggs" everyone calls me.
Shai was unaware of the cause of the hospitalizations and
his physical characteristics, but he understood his body as
"sick." The third important issue in the context of Shai's
sense of difference is his sexuality and attraction to boys,
which was perceived as forbidden in his social environment
and never spoken of. Thus, Shai learned to conceal his sexu-
ality and keep it secret.
Secondary sex characteristics, the growth of the penis and
pubic hair, appeared in Shai's body at a very young age (5-6),
and he was ashamed of them. His communication with his
parents was minimal, and he did not ask questions about his
physical condition or share with them the physical changes
he was undergoing. This surprised me because parents are
usually aware of physical changes in their children's bodies,
but Shai claims that he learned to be independent at a young
age, to shower alone, and take care of his own needs.
During his childhood hospitalizations, he felt that his
body was perceived by doctors as something rare, but he was
not sure why:
You're a little kid and all day they strip you and dress you and
look at you; that's how it was. I understood that mine was a rare,
special case, so they all wanted to see, they all wanted to touch,
that's how it was. Just like an exhibit in a museum.
6 SAGE Open
Despite Shai's otherwise excellent memory, his recollec-
tion of the years when he was hospitalized has been erased.
During these years, a number of surgeries were performed on
his body, including one to remove his uterus, ovaries, and
fallopian tubes.
By the time he was 13, Shai's body had developed in
accordance with its material terms (due to increased andro-
gen secretion, he underwent puberty very early, but from age
13, he stopped growing and remained quite short). Each
month, Shai would arrive at the hospital for monitoring. He
describes how the doctor treated him like an object, without
asking how he felt. He would ask him to strip and check the
length of his bones, limbs, and penis. For some reason, even
when it was obvious that his bones were not growing, the
doctor ignored this fact.
At 17, Shai received his first draft notice for compulsory
military service and underwent a physical examination,
including an examination of his scrotum. During the exami-
nation, it became clear to Shai, through the body language of
the doctors as they looked at one another, that something was
amiss with his genitalia. They said nothing to him. He
dressed and went home. One month later, he received a letter
stating that he was exempt from military service (on grounds
of being "permanently unsuitable"). He attempted to appeal
the decision and asked to volunteer, in any capacity, "just to
wear a uniform," but without success. In retrospect, Shai
says that he understands why the military doctors never told
him anything, as this would have been an extremely difficult
task and a great responsibility to assume, considering that the
doctors who treated him during his childhood had not told
him anything. So the military doctors maintained his civilian
doctors' rules of secrecy.
Two years later, Shai was surprised to receive a draft
notice for 3 years' service. He now refused to join both
because the army had rejected him in the past and because he
had continued with his life and now had a job and plans for
the future, so he appealed the recruitment and was subse-
quently summoned to a meeting of the Medical Committee.
Before the meeting, he unexpectedly received a large pack-
age containing all his medical documents. This is how Shai
describes his experience of discovering the secret:
It said "female pseudohermaphrodite,"8 but one sentence deeply
shocked me. I'll remember it to my dying day. . . . It said they
were making me into a boy because my parents were primitive
Moroccans. . . . I remember that I went to the committee and like
an idiot gave them all the documents. . . . I understood why I felt
different and what was different and what was wrong with me. .
. . I didn't want to talk about it, I was ashamed. . . . I buried it in
some corner of my body and covered it with stones and didn't
want to talk about it.
Among all the medical documents in the package was the
document Shai presented to me early in our meeting. It includes
a description of the min-guf process that Shai underwent during
his childhood, and reflects both the medical­technological
conditions in Israel at the time and the biosocial perceptions
of Shai's physicians. The document notes the following:
Empty right scrotum. On the left side a small mass can be felt,
large penis, uterus, ovaries are present. In conclusion, the child
is genetically female, gonadal sex female with completely male
external genitals, the penis is large, urethral tube inside the
penis, a well-structured but empty scrotum. Regarding the
child's future, of course he will have to live as a male, and this is
due to the following: the external genitalia are completely male.
Constructing a proper vagina to allow a normal sex life as a
female is a complicated and difficult thing, and the results are
doubtful. The condition of the ovaries cannot be determined
with certainty. Will there be fertility? If he continues to live as a
male it would be possible to stop administering cortisol.
Increased androgenization will ensure the development of
menstrual periods. In the meantime, we will not perform any
surgery, and if there is a need, we will perform the following
required surgeries: partial or complete hysterectomy and
removal of the ovaries. We see no justification for shocking
[words deleted from the document] the parents and telling them
about our findings. We released the child with a recommendation
to administer 25 mg of cortisone and instructed the parents to
bring him back for a follow-up visit in 10 days.
Shai's physical characteristics are described here in a way
that presents different kinds of sex: genetic sex, gonadal sex,
and external sex. His multisexual body shocked the doctors,
so they could not justify telling his parents about his physical
characteristics. The medical document suggests that the doc-
tors were being considerate of the parents and preventing
them from being shocked, but in the document that Shai read
and is now unable to obtain the doctor wrote that his parents
were "primitive Moroccans," so the reason for concealing
the information from them was the prejudiced perception of
his doctors, who assumed that because of their ethnicity, his
parents would not be able to understand and cope with Shai's
physical condition. Keeping Shai's intersexed body a secret
caused his physicians to perform the min-guf process on him
without sharing it with his parents and without their permis-
sion. Shai became a "hospital child," a child who belonged to
the world of those who treated him and its perceptions.
Shai was born with classical congenital adrenal hyperpla-
sia (CCAH), which involves a lack of salt in the body and
hormonal imbalances that result from an increased secretion
of androgens. Shai's doctors sexed his body as masculine,
the reason for this decision being the appearance of his penis,
in particular its size. Shai's uterus and ovaries were removed,
silicone testicles were implanted in his body, and cortisone
was administered to balance his hormones.
In a conversation I had with Prof. B., one of Shai's doc-
tors, he related the following9:
I remember a patient who came from Pediatric Surgery at age
two and a half. In a general exam, the doctor said his penis was
large. The person who conducted the Barr body test [used for
detecting the X chromosome] said, "You know, it's female.
Meoded Danon 7
What shall we do with him now? Cut him? He has a functioning
uterus, ovaries. If he's treated with cortisone he'll reach sexual
maturity and then what? The ovaries will wake up, estrogens
will make breasts, and then there will be menstruation, he'll
`urinate'blood. It has to drain into something. It will accumulate
in the uterus. What can we do to remedy the problem?" So if you
decide to raise the child as a male, you remove the uterus. . . . We
told the parents there was an "incompatibility." [long silence] At
the age of two and half, the child was already big--there was no
choice. I believe we made the right decision. Here you have to
decide whether to amputate this penis. I remember my boss said,
"You don't amputate a penis like this!"
The doctor's words indicate that treatment practices in
Shai's case--that is, the process of sexing him as mascu-
line--were carried out because of his large penis. This is in
line with the Johns Hopkins University approach of the time,
the phallocentric approach, according to Kessler (1998),
which related to penis size. However, there is ambiguity
regarding the process of the medical monitoring of Shai's
body, the ramifications of the surgery for his body, and what
all the doctors did when they noticed during follow-up that
Shai's bones had stopped growing, his body had stayed the
same size, and his "large penis" was now relatively small, as
he stopped growing at age 13. Shai is angry at his doctors,
who prevented his body from growing and did not prescribe
hormone replacement therapy for him. He realizes in retro-
spect that the reason for this was to keep the secret from him:
In order not to reveal the truth, [the doctor] would not give me
hormones so I wouldn't ask questions. . . . If you decide to make
me a boy, let me look like a boy! For G-d's sake, give me the
hormones on time! Everyone in our family is tall, so if you see .
. . that I have stopped growing, give me [the hormones], help me
grow. . . . So, you see that all the signs show that he simply did
not want this secret to be revealed.
At the age of 22, when Shai discovered the secret, he con-
cealed it from his friends and family, maintaining the rules of
secrecy and hoping that it would disappear. He did not share
the discovery with his parents and was especially angry at his
father because he thought that he (who had accompanied him
to the hospital during his childhood) had known about every-
thing and been involved in the doctors' decision making.
Only in 1997, years after his father's death, when Shai was
able to read all the medical documents, did he realize that his
parents actually had not been informed.
Shai decided to tell Dr. H., the new endocrinologist who
replaced the doctor who had treated him throughout his child-
hood, that he knew what had happened to him and that it both-
ered him that people mistook him for a girl. Dr. H. never
spoke to Shai about his physical history, but he was kind to
him, explains Shai, and prescribed testosterone, which Shai
has taken ever since. He describes the changes in his body:
I started shaving, which made me very happy. [smiles] I also
grew a beard. For years I had a beard to show that I was male
and not female. . . . I had a somewhat feminine voice, but
relatively low. The hormones made my voice much lower.
Today, Shai undergoes hormonal monitoring in the adult
endocrinology department, with a kind new endocrinologist
of whom he is very fond. She arranged for Shai to have sur-
gery to replace the small silicone testicles implanted when he
was a child with larger ones.
As Shai began to deal with the secret of his life and learn
about his medical past, he became severely depressed and
required psychological and psychiatric treatment. The more
he investigated, the more new things he discovered, includ-
ing flashes of negative experiences from the hospital and
physical and emotional abuse by his doctors. Shai's coping
alone with the discovery of the secret, while he continued to
hide it from others, threatened his life to the point where he
considered suicide, but he decided not to bury his secret with
him. Several years ago, he began to suffer extreme pain in his
lower abdomen and underwent a series of tests that revealed
the stump of a uterus in his body, a kind of historical, mate-
rial remnant through which the body signaled, in its own
way, the physical secret it held inside.
The bodily secret, that is, the social, material product of
the min-guf process, caused Shai to live in a world divided
between the external and the internal. These divisions, the
same separation that produces the secret, as Bok (1984)
claimed, are experienced by the body. The differences
between his internal and external worlds caused Shai to learn
to become an excellent actor, especially in highlighting his
so-called "masculine" features in his social environment as
opposed to his "feminine" features in private. Shai was seen
by his friends as a "man with balls," a kind of "bad boy" who
acted violently and stood out. My intention in pointing out
this behavior is not to distinguish between "masculine" and
"feminine" features and to perceive them as given, or to
reproduce gender stereotypes, but rather to show how Shai
distinguishes between these two worlds and to demonstrate
how this separation establishes embodied negative emotions,
frustration, and loneliness. Here, the body itself undermined
the concealment of the secret, especially in the external
"boy­girl," appearance that caused people to mistake Shai
for a girl. The more people mistook him for a girl, the more
extreme were his reactions--"bad boy" behavior and chang-
ing his appearance as an adult, growing a beard, and having
larger silicon testicles implanted. However, the concealment
game is exhausting and frustrating. For Shai, the hormones
are "a sham," not a part of him. He says that he would like to
rest from his frustrating struggle with the bodily secret and
social conservatism.
Shai's min-guf process established a bodily secret that
transformed his body and poisoned its being. The treatment
policy, together with the bodily secret, led to Shai's body being
neither female nor male, but rather a different kind of body, a
body without internal sex organs, with a small penis and sili-
cone testicles, a body that depends on synthetic hormones.
8 SAGE Open
Shai physically experiences resistance to the bodily secret in
various ways. For example, the body remembers its missing
organs, as evidenced by the experience of physical pain that
caused Shai to discover the stump of the uterus in his body.
In addition, Shai has always experienced the bodily secret in
his own unusual nature and difference, through his frequent
hospitalizations and through the way in which his doctors
looked at his body as though it were an object in a museum.
Thus, even when he was unaware of the contents of the
secret, it was palpable and real in his life, like a foreign body.
Ronnie: "I Once Had Testicles" Is
Similar to "I Have Testicles" (October
7, 2005, November 21, 2008)
Ronnie's story is very different from Shai's; they grew up in
different environments, at different socioeconomic levels,
with different cultural values and different intersex condi-
tions. Yet, a similarity exists between them in terms of their
embodiment and their bodily experience, which are closely
linked to the secrets that surround their bodies. The course of
Ronnie's life intersects with that of her sister, who is 4 years
older. Both were born with Complete Androgen Insensitivity
Syndrome (CAIS).10 Although her sister did not participate
in the current study, her presence was felt in Ronnie's story,
because she experienced the min-guf process and the estab-
lishment of the bodily secret first, and Ronnie later went
through the same process. This is how Ronnie began her life
narrative:
I was twelve, and my older sister was sixteen and hadn't gotten
her period, and my parents took her to all kinds of tests because
of this matter. Later, they also took me for tests. Everything she
went through, I went through, and they didn't explain why and I
didn't ask too many questions. . . . They told me I had been born
without a uterus and couldn't have children and I wouldn't
menstruate. They even took the trouble to tell me that studies
prove that the girls who have this syndrome are pretty, tall, and
not hairy. I remember that I didn't believe them and thought it
was nice of them to tell me this, but it was clear they had done it
to be kind, to make me feel good after the blow they had just
dealt me.
When Ronnie describes the "matter," and what she calls
"this syndrome," there is a sense of alienation, a certain dis-
tance--alienation that I feel as a listener and alienation and
distance experienced by Ronnie. The common perception is
that androgen insensitivity syndrome produces "beauty"--
girls who are pretty, tall, and not hairy. This is how doctors
present the characteristics of this physical condition to par-
ents. This myth of "beauty" is also reflected in popular litera-
ture, for example, in the novel Middlesex by Jeffrey
Eugenides (2002) and in the media (in one of the episodes of
the television series House).
Ronnie cannot describe in words what she felt after her
parents told her she would not menstruate or bear children.
She felt terrible and cried all night. Until that evening, she
had expected to menstruate--Menstruation was something
everyone was talking about as teenagers. Later, Ronnie lied
to her friends said she had gotten her period. She bought
sanitary pads and kept them in a cupboard. When her mother
saw them she asked Ronnie why she had them, Ronnie was
embarrassed and explained that if a friend needed a pad, she
would have one. Ronnie lied to decrease the social pressure
around her, thus participating in the establishment of the
bodily secret.
Ronnie began to undergo examinations by the gynecolo-
gist who treated her older sister with no explanation about
the nature of the tests or the reason for them. She underwent
the examinations as part of her routine, asking no questions.
After examining her, the gynecologist told her mother that
Ronnie could have normal sex--that is, heterosexual sex--
because she had a vagina. In some cases of CAIS, the vagina
is narrow and doctors recommend expanding it with
surgery.11
Ronnie and her sister each experienced the min-guf pro-
cess alone. Ronnie's sister underwent surgery at this time to
remove her testes. This process was not shared with Ronnie.
When Ronnie began to mature, the physical examinations
were geared toward surgery to remove her gonads. This is
how she describes the experience:
In the summer between eighth and ninth grade, I had surgery.
My mother told me to say that it was hernia surgery, and that's
what I said. . . . I was told that they were removing my residual
ovaries, so I wouldn't get cancer or something. I didn't know it
was something else. . . . I have scars on my lower abdomen
[from the surgery].
Ronnie's parents lied, concealing the real reason for her
surgery; instead of telling her that testicles were being
removed, they told her that residual ovaries were being
removed to prevent them from becoming cancerous. Ronnie
told her friends that she had hernia surgery, as her mother
asked her to. The scars from her surgery remain on her lower
abdomen, a sign that her body remembers what happened to
it, a mark of its physical history. Following surgery, Ronnie
began to take synthetic hormones. In this way, through medi-
cal treatment and her parents' cooperation with it, the secret
was established in Ronnie's body.
One day her sister sent her an email with a link to the
Androgene Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS) group in England.
Ronnie kept the email in a folder and did not open it. When I
asked her why, she replied,
When I saw that in the initials "AIS" the first word was androgen,
my only familiarity with that word was that it had to do with
someone whose biology and gender are undefined, something
between a man and a woman, and it was very frightening to me.
. . . I put it in a folder and forgot about it. After about two years
. . . I told my friend, a doctor. . . . I told her what I tell everyone,
and then she asked me, "So when did have your testicles
Meoded Danon 9
removed?" and I felt like I'd been punched in the stomach, just
ashamed that I didn't know. So I told her at age fourteen, as if I
suddenly had made all the connections to the surgery I had had
then. Then she left, and I went to the website that my sister had
sent me . . . and only then did everything become clear to me.
Ronnie experienced the moment of the secret's revelation
in her body as a punch in the stomach, a feeling directly con-
nected to her abdominal surgery, which the body remembers
through a scar. Ronnie immediately made the connection
between her surgery at 14 and the removal of her testes. The
secret, now revealed, that her body had contained testes, and
not damaged ovaries, frightened and deeply troubled Ronnie,
because the organ she most associated with masculinity had
been part of her body. She explains,
The subject of the testicles was the most problematic for me then
and has been ever since. I didn't tell my boyfriend about the
testes, but only that I don't have a uterus, and he took it with
indifference. I don't want to tell him about the testicles, because
I think this would have been a sexual turn-off for him.
After uncovering the secret, Ronnie began to explore her
physical condition; she read studies and wrote an academic
paper on the different forms of AIS, which she gave to her
sister and parents to read. Ronnie also recognizes the bene-
fits of her physical condition, such as being tall and not being
hairy. Ronnie expresses her discomfort with the term
"intersex":
I don't think of myself as intersex. . . . I don't have any problem
with my sex. I also think it has to do with the form of the
syndrome that one has. The physical appearance of those with
complete AIS is that of a woman and it's different from other
syndromes, where there are elements of both sexes. . . . Despite
my condition, it's clear to me that I'm a woman; my sex was
confused, but my gender was not. I will elaborate. Yes, I had
problems when I was younger. I was flat-chested and had short
hair, so people would mistake me for a boy and I was very
insulted. My hands are not feminine either, but I cannot imagine
living life as a man.
Ronnie's "physical reality" is dialectical, expressed in the
tension between her internal corporeality and the external
corporeality resulting from her "syndrome." The dialectic is
between her internal "masculinity" (testes, XY46 sex chro-
mosomes) and phenotypical femaleness (female external
genitalia). On one hand, Ronnie says that her corporeality,
her outer appearance as a woman with CAIS, is that of a
woman, unlike what outer appearance may be in other physi-
cal conditions of intersexuality. On the other hand, she says
that her physicality as a child made people mistakenly think
she was a boy, and that she had been offended by this.
Similarly, she adds that her "sex" is confused, but her "gen-
der" is stable, clear, and decidedly feminine. When I asked
Ronnie to describe what it means to her to "feel like a
woman," she responded that she had no idea, but that she still
knew she was a woman and not a man in the existing social­
gender dichotomy.
Ronnie, like Shai, experienced the physical dialectic. This
took place during the surrogacy process, 3 years after our first
interview. Ronnie told me that she had married her partner and
they had begun the surrogacy process, during which she was
required to undergo general medical examinations and provide
medical documentation confirming her inability to conceive:
When I do an ultrasound there is something comfortable in the
doctor just writing "uterus and ovaries not detected" and not
"but testicles were detected" . . . because there is still a
dissonance between the self-concept, the gender I chose, and the
fact that I once had testicles. It's a dissonance that needs to be
dealt with, and this solves the problem of the need to deal with
it. It doesn't completely solve it because, bottom line, "I once
had" is similar to "I have," but it still allows me to deal with it
and explain myself to myself and not explain it to the ultrasound
technician, let's say.
Ronnie's bodily secret continues to exist, even when there
are no testicles in her body. Ronnie says that she deals with
the secret by keeping it to herself. Thus, she maintains the
dissonance--the bodily dialectic. In retrospect, Ronnie
explains that the secret has affected her life, her social abili-
ties, her interpersonal relations, and her trust in others.
The min-guf process that Ronnie underwent created a
physical secret that, in turn, produced a dialectic in her life
between her body and her gender. The bodily secret here is
actually a family secret, shared by her older sister, their par-
ents, and their doctors. The secret no longer depends on the
material physical characteristics of the intersexed body; even
after Ronnie's testes were removed, she experienced the ten-
sion produced by the bodily secret. The removal of the testes
did not produce a blurring or disappearance of intersexed
corporeality, but rather strengthened it and preserved it as a
bodily secret. The body is the secret, but at the same time it
also undermines the secret. The feeling that Ronnie describes,
the self-dissonance, threatens to reveal the secret. In other
words, on one hand, the physical secret, concealing the inter-
sexed physicality, protects Ronnie from the threat and the
response to the disturbing physicality associated with mascu-
linity. But, on the other hand, the body cannot conceal the
secret, and leaves the physical scars of the min-guf process.
There are also emotional scars that are experienced physi-
cally, for example, the sense that the testicles exist even in
their absence. The secret provides power, presence, and exis-
tence to the particular intersexual corporeality.
Or: "I Was Hooked Up to a
Respirator" (November 6, 2009,
December 25, 2009)
Or, 28, is an academic. She is interested in researching the
genetics of her physical condition--congenital adrenal
hyperplasia (CAH). Or is active in the CAH community on a
10 SAGE Open
well-known Internet site and often provides biomedical
information to parents of intersexed children and to inter-
sexed people with CAH. She begins with the story of her
birth:
I was born prematurely, in the eighth month, and it was a breech
birth. I've always been kind of contrary. They noticed something
strange and my mother told me that there was a doctor who . . .
recognized the syndrome. Actually I was, I am, a classically
difficult case. The term is CAH due to 21OH deficiencies, which
means CAH due to damage to enzyme 21 accompanied by the
loss of salts. I have all the problems. Aside from that, he
recognized that I did not look normal and so they monitored me
closely, so I did not become dehydrated.
Immediately after birth, Or underwent a series of tests to
monitor levels of hormones and salts in her body. Her exter-
nal genitals included an "enlarged clitoris" and closed labia,
and this situation brought about the initiation of the min-guf
process and diagnostic tests to determine her physical condi-
tion. She and her parents were referred to the best hospital
available at the time--Johns Hopkins University, which spe-
cialized in these surgeries. She recalls,
By age 5, I actually already realized that I was different. I didn't
go to change clothes in the locker room at the pool. At five I
underwent the first surgery. And then they arranged the external
form [of my genitals], arranged what needed to be arranged.
Or reveals here that at an early age, she had become aware
of the physical differences reflected in the appearance of her
external genitals. She describes the difference she sensed at a
very young age when she saw that the women in the locker
room did not have the same organ as she did. Or explains
how she experienced her difference: "From the day I first
knew who I was, I knew somehow that I was not normal. To
have surgery at age five pretty much establishes this fact."
Or's statement attests to the fact that genital surgeries
themselves increase the sense of difference in intersexed
children and do not facilitate their adaptation or sense of
social belonging, as biomedical experts claim. Or does not
remember many details of the meeting with the psychologist
at the clinic before her surgery, but she recalls that her mother
talked with the psychologist, and she mainly played with
toys she defines as "boys'toys"--tractors and trucks. During
her childhood, Or remembers, she had to take medications,
which increased her sense of difference and alienation
regarding her corporeality.
At 12, Or underwent a second operation to continue the
construction of her external genitals. While the first surgery
constructed the outer labia, corrected the urethra, and reduced
the size of the clitoris, the second was aimed at constructing
a vagina and allowing the passage of menstrual fluid from
the cervix. Or reports her recollection of learning from her
mother about the second surgery: "I remember she explained
that I had to have surgery so I could lead a normal life. I
remember I asked why they hadn't removed my uterus dur-
ing the first operation."
Or was aware of her corporeality early on. Her response
to her mother's news about the impending surgery can be
seen as an attempt to resist ordinary life, a uterus, fertility,
the kind of life her mother wishes for her. Or traveled to the
United States with her mother to undergo the second opera-
tion. She does not remember pain, but recalls that she recov-
ered quickly and was released early. After surgery, she had to
preserve the vagina in her body and to use different expand-
ers to widen it. As this was very painful for Or and for her
mother, who tried to help her, in time they stopped. After the
second surgery, Or increasingly shut out her friends. When I
asked her why she thinks she isolated herself, she replied,
The main reason, I think, is that when I was born the doctors
advised my parents not to tell. They told the grandparents, aunts
and uncles, and that was it. I mean, they knew what I had, but it
didn't come up. . . . The parents didn't tell. You understand, they
didn't talk about it. My siblings don't know.
At age 17, Or had a third operation and later an additional
one to open and expand the vagina, which her body had
closed over time. The purpose of the operations was to
encourage her sexuality, especially the act of penetration. Or
claims that, although she is not in a relationship and does not
want to be in one, she still preserves the opening of the
vagina because it is threatening to close again.
Or's min-guf process and the establishment of her physi-
cal secret caused her alienation and self-hatred. She does not
like to be photographed or to see herself in pictures, and is
revolted by psychologists. Her sense of alienation is increased
and reproduced both by the expansion of her vagina and the
operations she underwent and through her bodily secret,
which is not spoken of. This is a kind of vicious circle--a
bodily secret that is not mentioned, but which controls her
life and threatens its existence.
Or attempted to escape this vicious circle. When she was
drafted into the army at age 18, she decided to stop taking the
dexamethasone (a type of cortisone) she had taken all her
life. Or decided to get, as she says, "off the respirator" to
which she had been attached since birth, which meant break-
ing free from her bodily secret. When her doctor called her in
for a blood test, Or told her that she had stopped taking the
pills. The doctor informed her parents at once, and they
asked her to resume taking the medication. Thus, the doctor
violated medical confidentiality, and Or claims that if she
had filed a complaint, the doctor would have lost her license.
But she did not file a complaint. The physical effects of stop-
ping her medication included fatigue, depression, and facial
hair growth.
Or and her parents conceal the secret from her siblings,
and thus the physical secret becomes a family secret that cre-
ates a boundary between those who share it and those who do
not within the family system. The secret sabotages family
Meoded Danon 11
relationships and communication between family members.
The relationship between Or and her siblings and her parents
is cool and distant.
When I asked Or about love and intimate relationships in
her life, she explained that she has never experienced love
that it is impossible for her:
How can I tell someone I was born different, that what you see
now is the result of a successful plastic surgeon, more or less? I
have no idea what I look like compared to someone normal. I
would argue that the work they did wasn't one hundred percent
perfect, that I'm quite different. I don't know, I mean they forgot
to tattoo an orientation map on my genitals [laughs].
Or asks how she can develop a relationship with another
person when she is unable to accept herself. She has a great
deal of anger that erupts dramatically when someone annoys
her. Or's anger is directed at herself, and she often sinks into
depression and talks to no one.
Or's most dominant conflict is the struggle between the
body and the secret. Throughout her life, the secret was
established in her body with the aim of concealing the body
and its physical history. It thus undermines and suppresses
the particular experience of the body, its appearance, its
being in the world, and particularly its interaction with its
environment and with others. Throughout her life, Or learned
that her body was a secret, something different, and therefore
everyone was concealing it. The medications she takes, the
surgeries she has undergone, and keeping the secret all reaf-
firm and intensify her difficult feelings. The bodily secret
poisons her existence and causes conflicts and alienation
from herself and others.
Conclusion
The min-guf process of intersexed people, the surgical, hor-
monal practices, the deliberate concealment of the intersexed
body, and the attempt to make it "disappear" all establish a
bodily secret. The secret is embodied as an organic feature
through treatment practices. Over time, it becomes a foreign
object that undermines the body's orientation and existence.
The bodily secret is a force that surrounds the body and pro-
duces stress, frustration, and the alienation of intersexed sub-
jects from their bodies. Physical secrets, like other toxic and
dangerous secrets, cause the subjects who experience them
to occupy opposing worlds. On one hand, intersexed subjects
live in a world run and disciplined by the rules of the secret
and its agents, a world whose social, gender, and sexual
norms are reproduced, filed under an imaginary sexual/gen-
der ideal. On the other hand, they experience in their bodies
a world that opposes both the rules of the secret's game and
the secrecy and social norms regarding sex/gender. The body
does not "know" how to conceal the secret and treats it like a
"foreign body," causing tension and unease. Thus, it reveals
the secret through pain, inflammation, scarring, residual
internal genitalia, and the side effects of synthetic hormones,
producing a kind of dialectical "corporeal realism" (Shilling,
2005) experienced by the intersexed subject, according to
which his or her body simultaneously exists/does not exist, is
present/absent, is hidden/visible. This dialectical corporeal
realism produces a vicious circle; when intersexed subjects
reveal the physical secret and become aware of the differ-
ence between their bodies and social sex and gender norms,
they become its agents and reproduce the rules that conceal
it. Thus, Or, Shai, and Ronnie conceal their physical secrets
from their siblings and other relatives, just as individuals
with conditions such as CAIS, ovotestis, or gonadal digene-
sis may conceal their chromosomal and gonadal characteris-
tics, or CAH individuals conceal their presurgery genital
characteristics, from intimate partners. But the body objects
and responds in its own particular terms, a situation that cre-
ates tension and conflict with the rules of concealment and
often leads to a continuation of the "normalization" of the
body into a particular sexual ideal. And yet, the more the
bodily secret continues to operate in the lives of the inter-
sexed, the longer they try to conceal it from those around
them and from themselves, the more they experience alien-
ation from the body, alienation caused by the body and expe-
rienced in the body. The bodily secret disconnects and
separates body and mind, and distinguishes between them as
well as between consciousness and being and between soci-
ety and its norms and the material body. Bodily secrets pro-
duce a constant conflict that makes the existence of embodied
subjects impossible, as they are caught between conflicting
worlds. The only way to escape the vicious circle in which
intersexed people are imprisoned is to end the paradoxical
attempt to conceal the intersexed body in the public space in
general and from intersexed subjects in particular. That is,
the surgical practices and the secrecy that surround them,
whose goal is to reproduce some kind of typical sexual/gen-
der ideal and not necessarily to save lives or prevent physical
danger (except in rare cases in which gonads become cancer-
ous), do not ensure the welfare and happiness of intersexed
subjects. On the contrary, they endanger their lives and
undermine their social, familial, and intimate relationships.
The intersexed body has existed since the dawn of history.
Attempts to make it disappear or to conceal it are damaging
not only to intersexed people and their families but also to
biomedical science, which, instead of attempting to normal-
ize intersexed bodies, could learn much from them about the
different ways in which the human body develops and the
many challenges that it presents.

Notes
1. I understood the difference between privacy and secrecy at
a later stage of my research. While privacy and secrecy are
similar in that they both include an element of concealment,
researchers who differentiate between these two concepts
claim that privacy is legitimate and ethical because every per-
son has a right to protect his privacy as long as it does not
harm others. While secrets and secrecy are supposed to be
concealed, this concealment is directed at people from whom
the secret is concealed, to whose lives the secret is connected.
When information connected to the life, emotions, or body of
another person is involved, the secret is unethical and damages
the lives of others, from whom it is kept and to whose lives it
is connected (Bok, 1984).
 2. This traditional protocol was also called the "Money Protocol"
(Davidson, 2009, p. 63).
3. Hermaphroditism was the traditional clinical term for inter-
sexed patients and was replaced in 2005, following the Chicago
conference, to "Disorder of Sex Development" (DSD).
 4. Intersex Society of North America (ISNA) fell apart follow-
ing its support of the term "DSD" and Chase, now called Bo
Laurent, became the head of Accord Alliance group, which is
devoted to supporting research and clinical cooperation with
biomedical professionals.
5. Currently, various intersex and interdisciplinary groups are
acting to raise awareness of intersexed peoples' rights and to
change medical treatment. Among these are the Organization
of Intersex International (OII), European Network for
PsychSocial studies in Intersex/DSD (EUROPSI), Accord
Alliance, and others.
 6. Joan Fujimura (2006) analyzed the protocols of genetic stud-
ies and the attempt of science to determine which genes cause
the formation of female and male sex. It was found that sci-
ence is deliberately ignoring findings that are inconsistent with
the dual sexual perception. For example, while scientists sug-
gest that SRY is the gene that causes the formation of male
characteristics such as testicles, they ignored a fertile female
mouse with an XX chromosome bearing the SRY gene, pos-
sibly because they could not explain this finding.
 7. Can we separate the human body from social forces, language,
and norms? Examining and researching human bodies, the
medical discourse makes no separation between sex and gen-
der norms. How can we capture the gender category and its
manifestation in the sexual body? Parents use gendered lan-
guage with their babies, but could they really predict that their
babies will grow up to be a sis-gender person? Where does
sex (body) begin and gender (socialization) end? Intersexed
people become "intersexed" immediately after integrating
with the biosocial gaze, which characterizes and defines them
according to normative sex/gender frames. I would like to
thank the reviewers for their insightful comments on this point.
 8. This is an outdated medical term that indicates a situation in
which the internal sex organs are "female," and include uterus,
ovaries, and fallopian tubes, while the external physical char-
acteristics (phenotype) are male and the external genitals
appear "male." In Shai's case, this took the form of a penis
with a "normative" urethral opening at the tip of the penis and
not elsewhere as happens in similar conditions (adrenal hyper-
plasia) and the structure of a scrotum, but no testes.
9. I interviewed Shai's endocrinologist to get a historical per-
spective on treatment methods in cases of the intersexed in
Israel. Without being asked, the doctor began to tell me about
a unique case that he had treated and I understood that he was
talking about Shai.
10. This syndrome is attributed to people with XY46 sex chro-
mosomes. There are two forms of "androgen insensitivity
syndrome"--complete and partial. In the complete form, the
body does not respond to androgens and does not develop as
male. The gonads--testicles--are undeveloped and remain in
the groin (in some cases creating a hernia) or abdomen. The
phenotype appears "female," with female external genitalia--
external labia, vagina, and clitoris. Frequency is 1 in 13,000 to
20,000 births. In the partial form, the body responds to andro-
genic hormones partially, testes develop, and the phenotype
is integrated--"ambiguous genitalia." The older term for AIS
was "testicular feminization syndrome" (Harper, 2007).
11. For example, Ronnie told me about a woman with Complete
Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS) whom she met, who
told her she had vaginismus, a condition in which the vagina is
tight or shrinks during intercourse (with penetration), and that
it caused her pain and discomfort.
