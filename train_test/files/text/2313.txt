IMPORTANCE Despite evidence of the increasing use of psychotropic medications, little is
known about the broader changes in the delivery of outpatient mental health treatment to
children, adolescents, and adults.
OBJECTIVE To assess national trends and patterns in the mental health care of children,
adolescents, and adults in office-based medical practice.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Outpatient visits to physicians in office-based practice
from the 1995-2010 National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys (N = 446 542). Trends
(1995-2010) in visits with mental health care indicators are first compared between youths
(<21 years) and adults (21 years) and then between children (0-13 years) and adolescents
(14-20 years). Background and clinical characteristics of recent visits (2007-2010) resulting in
a mental disorder diagnosis are also compared among children, adolescents, and adults.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Visits resulting in mental disorder diagnoses, prescription
of psychotropic medications, provision of psychotherapy, or psychiatrist care.
RESULTS Between 1995-1998 and 2007-2010, visits resulting in mental disorder diagnoses
per 100 population increased significantly faster for youths (from 7.78 to 15.30 visits) than for
adults (from 23.23 to 28.48 visits) (interaction: P < .001). Psychiatrist visits also increased
significantly faster for youths (from 2.86 to 5.71 visits) than for adults (from 10.22 to 10.87
visits) (interaction: P < .001). Psychotropic medication visits increased at comparable rates
for youths (from 8.35 to 17.12 visits) and adults (from 30.76 to 65.90 visits) (interaction:
P = .13). While psychotherapy visits increased from 2.25 to 3.17 per 100 population for youths,
they decreased from 8.37 to 6.36 for adults (interaction: P < .001). In 2007-2010, 27.4% of
child visits, 47.9% of adolescent visits, and 36.6% of adult visits resulting in a mental disorder
diagnosis were to a psychiatrist.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Compared with adult mental health care, the mental health
care of young people has increased more rapidly and has coincided with increased
psychotropic medication use. A great majority of mental health care in office-based medical
practice to children, adolescents, and adults is provided by nonpsychiatrist physicians calling
for increased consultation and communication between specialties.

Over the last several years, a number of important
changes have occurred in the mental health care of
children and adolescents in the United States.1-3
Perhaps most importantly, there has been an increased
clinical emphasis on pharmacological management.4 This
emphasis has been supported by large randomized
controlled trials of stimulants for attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),5 antipsychotics for bipolar
mania6 and behavioral problems associated with autism,7
and antidepressants for major depressive disorder8 and sev-
eral anxiety disorders.9 Advances in pharmacological man-
agement, alongside development of evidence-based psy-
chotherapies for common child and adolescent psychiatric
disorders,10 have been incorporated into disorder-specific
clinical practice guidelines.11-14
Changes in the delivery of outpatient mental health care
to young people are taking place in the context of a modest
increase in the number of individuals of all ages who are
receiving outpatient mental health care in the United States.
The number of individuals receiving outpatient mental
health treatment increased from 16.1 million in 1998 to 23.3
million in 2007.15 During this period, there has been
increased public acceptance concerning the appropriateness
of treating major psychiatric disorders with prescription
medications.16
Some trends in child and adolescent mental health care
are readily understood as reactions to discrete events in the
practice environment. Following the US Food and Drug
Administration's safety warnings for antidepressants in
2004, for example, there was a slowdown in the overall
growth of antidepressant use by young people,17 a decrease
in the number of individuals receiving antidepressants
for depression,18 and a compensatory increase in the num-
ber of children and adolescents receiving psychotherapy
for depression.19 Increasing awareness of the adverse
metabolic effects of second-generation antipsychotic
medications20 is widely thought to have recently slowed
the growth in the use of antipsychotic treatment among
young people.1,21 Other changes, such as an increase in the
number of children who received a diagnosis of ADHD3
or autism spectrum disorder,22 are somewhat more diffi-
cult to pin on specific events or changes in the practice
environment.
Our current understanding of national trends in child
and adolescent outpatient mental health care largely
derives from analyses of individual classes of psychotropic
medications1,2,23 and diagnostic groups.3,24 In an effort to
provide a more unified overview of recent changes in the
delivery of outpatient child and adolescent mental health
care, we present data from nationally representative sur-
veys of office-based medical visits of broad trends and pat-
terns of mental health care for children and adolescents in
relation to adults. We focus on office-based medical visits
resulting in clinical diagnoses of mental disorders, treat-
ment by psychiatrists, prescription of psychotropic medica-
tions, and provision of psychotherapy, and we contrast the
trends seen in children and adolescents with the those seen
in youths and adults.
Methods
DatawereobtainedfromtheNationalAmbulatoryMedicalCare
Survey.25 This survey, which is conducted annually by the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics, samples a nationally rep-
resentative group of visits to physicians in office-based prac-
tice. Following the recommendations of the National Center
for Health Statistics, we combined data from contiguous sur-
vey years (1995-1998, 1999-2002, 2003-2006, and 2007-2010)
to derive more stable estimates. Across the 16 survey years, re-
sponse rates varied between 58.3% (2010) and 72.8% (1995),
with a mean rate of 65.7%. For each visit, the treating physi-
cian or member of the physician's staff provided information
about the patient's sociodemographic and clinical character-
istics, as well as the medications prescribed or supplied to the
patient.
Demographic Characteristics
On the basis of patient age, visits were first grouped into adult
(21 years) and youth (<21 years) visits and then subgrouped
into child (0-13 years) and adolescent (14-20 years) visits. In
some analyses, visits were also grouped by sex (male and fe-
male) and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, and Hispanic).
Indicators of Mental Health Care
The 4 general indicators of mental health care included clini-
cal mental disorder diagnosis, psychotropic medication pre-
scription, psychotherapy provision, and psychiatric care. Vis-
its with these indicators are correspondingly referred to as
mental disorder visits, psychotropic medication visits, psy-
chotherapy visits, and psychiatrist visits.
Diagnoses were made according to the International Clas-
sificationofDiseases,NinthRevision,ClinicalModification(ICD-
9-CM). Visits were grouped by the presence of a mental disor-
der (ICD-9-CM codes 290-319), disruptive behavior disorder
(ICD-9-CM code 309.3, 312.0-312.4, 312.8-312.9, 313.81, or 314),
mooddisorder(ICD-9-CMcode293.83,296,298.0,300.4,301.1,
311, or 313.1), anxiety disorder (ICD-9-CM code 293.84, 300.0,
300.2, 300.3, 308.3, 309.21, or 309.81), psychoses/
developmental disorder (ICD-9-CM codes 290.0-295.9, 297.0-
298.0, 298.3-299.9, 310.0-310.9, or 317-319), and other mental
disorders (ICD-9-CM codes 290-319, not included in above-
mentionedcodes).Preliminaryanalysesrevealedthatthenum-
ber of visits resulting in psychotic disorder and developmen-
tal disorder diagnoses were too small to be considered as
separate categories. In some analyses, mood disorder visits
were further subgrouped by the presence of a depressive dis-
orderdiagnosis(ICD-9-CMcode296.2,296.3,296.82,311,300.4,
or 298.0) or a bipolar disorder diagnosis (ICD-9-CM code 296.0,
296.1, 296.4, 296.5, 296.6, 296.7, 296.80, 296.81, 296.89, or
301.13). A comorbid mental disorder diagnosis variable in-
dexed the presence of 2 or 3 diagnostic groups (mood, anxi-
ety, disruptive behavior, psychoses/developmental, or other)
within a single visit.
Visits in which psychotropic medications were either sup-
plied or prescribed were classified into 5 medication groups:

antipsychotic medications; stimulants and other medica-
tions to treat ADHD (atomoxetine hydrochloride, guanfacine
hydrochloride, and clonidine hydrochloride); antidepres-
sants; anxiolytics, which also included hypnotics; and mood
stabilizers. Antipsychotics included first- and second-
generation drugs. Anxiolytics included benzodiazepines and
nonbenzodiazepine sedatives and anxiolytics. Mood stabiliz-
ersincludedlithiumcarbonate,carbamazepine,divalproexso-
diumÂ­valproate sodiumÂ­valproic acid, and lamotrigine. All an-
tidepressants (including duloxetine hydrochloride and
trazodone hydrochloride, which are also used for nonÂ­
mental health indications) were included as antidepressants.
Burpopion hydrochloride, although also approved for treat-
ment of ADHD for individuals 6 years of age or older, was also
considered as an antidepressant.
Separate variables indexed whether the treating physi-
cian was a psychiatrist (including a child and adolescent
psychiatrist or an adult psychiatrist compared with a non-
psychiatrist physician, including pediatricians and other
nonpsychiatrist physicians). We also examined whether psy-
chotherapy was provided by the physician at the visit and,
for cross-sectional analyses, whether the nonpsychiatrist
physician specialized in pediatrics, general practice, family
medicine, internal medicine, or another medical specialty.
Source of Payment
Datawerecollapsedinto4mutuallyexclusivecategoriesofpri-
mary source of payment: (1) private insurance, such as Blue
Cross/Blue Shield and other commercial insurance; (2) Medi-
care; (3) Medicaid and other government insurance; and (4) a
residual category ("self-pay/other") that combined patients
with self-payment, no charge, workers compensation, those
whose source of insurance was unknown, and those who re-
ceived uncompensated care. For visits with more than 1 source
of payment, assignment was hierarchical, with visits as-
signed to private, Medicare, Medicaid, and self-pay/other in-
surance groups in descending order.
Analytic Strategy
Population-basedproportionsandassociated95%CIsofoffice-
based adult (21 years) and youth (<21 years) visits with each
of the 4 general mental health care indicators were deter-
mined for years 1995-1998, 1999-2002, 2003-2006, and 2007-
2010. Denominators were derived from intercensal estimates
from the US Bureau of the Census26 of the corresponding age
groups (Table 1). Similar population-based proportions were
determined for youths by mental disorder group (Figure 1) and
psychotropic medication class (Figure 2). For each mental dis-
order group and psychotropic medication class, population-
based proportions were derived separately for children (0-13
years) and adolescents (14-20 years) (eTable 1 in Supple-
ment).Population-basedproportionswerethencomparedover
time between youth visits to psychiatrists and nonpsychia-
trist physicians by mental disorder group and psychotropic
medication class (eTable 2 in Supplement). Finally, the per-
centage of visits resulting in a mental disorder diagnosis in
2007-2010 for children, adolescents, and adults were com-
pared with respect to the demographic and clinical variables
(Table 2).
Logistic regression models were used to assess time
trends in the probability of visits with the 4 general mental
health care indicators and the specific mental disorder diag-
nosis groups and psychotropic medication classes. A study
period variable was defined for each survey year running
from 0 for 1995 to 1 for 2010. The outcome of interest was
the odds of the mental health care indicator occurring

across the entire period (1995-2010). For example, an odds
ratio of 2.0 for any mental disorder diagnosis denotes twice
the odds of a visit resulting in a mental disorder diagnosis at
the end (2010), compared with the start (1995), of the study
period. Separate regressions were constructed for each level
of visit characteristic of interest. An interaction term was
added to many of the regressions to assess whether trends
in the mental health indicators significantly differed across
the groups. The P values associated with these interaction
terms are presented in Tables 1 and 2 and eTable 2 in
Supplement. For years 2007-2010, the difference in propor-
tion test was used to compare the background and clinical
characteristics of visits resulting in mental disorder diagno-
ses for children, adolescents, and adults. Analysis of vari-
ance was used to compare visit durations across the 3 age
groups.
Supplemental analyses examine the distribution of
child, adolescent, and adult visits resulting in mental
disorder diagnoses (2007-2010) by geographic region, met-
ropolitan area status, and visit disposition (eTable 3 in
Supplement). They also assess trends in 4 mental health
service indicators in young people by sex and racial/ethnic
group (eTable 4 in Supplement) and mental health reasons
for the visit (eTable 5 in Supplement). These reasons
included anxiety and nervousness, fears and phobia,
depression, anger, restlessness, and behavioral distur-
bances.
Analyses were adjusted for visit weights, clustering, and
stratification of data using design elements provided by the
National Center for Health Statistics. When adjusted for these
elements, survey data represent annual visits to US office-
based physicians.25 Analyses were conducted using SUDAAN
software (RTI International); all analyses were 2-sided, and the
levelwassetat.05.Population-basedestimateswithoutover-
lapping confidence intervals are considered to be signifi-
cantly different from one another.

Results
Youth and Adult Mental Health Care
On a per capita basis, all 4 general indicators of office-based
mental health care (mental disorder diagnosis, psychotropic
medication prescription, psychotherapy provision, and vis-
its to a psychiatrist) were significantly less prevalent among
youths than adults. The number of visits including a psycho-
tropic medication prescription significantly increased in both
agegroups.Bycontrast,thenumberofvisitsresultinginamen-
tal disorder diagnosis and the number of visits to a psychia-
trist nearly doubled for youths but did not significantly change
for adults. The number of psychotherapy visits decreased for
adults but remained little changed for youths (Table 1).
In supplemental analyses of reasons for visits, there was
a significant increase in the population rate of visits by young

ber of visits for restlessness. Among adults, there were signifi-
cant decreases in the number of visits for depression, anger,
and restlessness (eTable 5 in Supplement).
Mental Health Care of Young People
Throughout the study period, disruptive behavior disorders
were the most common mental disorder diagnosis among
youths (Figure 1). A significant increase occurred in per capita
youth visits resulting in diagnoses of disruptive behavior dis-
order, mood disorder, anxiety disorder, and psychoses/
developmental disorder. Visits per 100 population of young
people that included 2 or more mental disorder diagnoses in-
creased from 1.34 (95% CI, 0.95-1.73) in 1995-1998 to 2.47 (95%
CI, 1.80-3.15) in 1999-2002 to 3.46 (95% CI, 2.63-4.28) in 2003-
2006 to 3.66 (95% CI, 2.66-4.65) in 2007-2010 (odds ratio, 2.60
[95% CI, 1.78-3.79]) (data not shown).
Significantincreaseswereevidentamongyouthvisitswith
prescriptions for stimulants and other medications to treat
ADHD, for antidepressants, for antipsychotics, and for mood
stabilizers(Figure2).By2007-2010,stimulantsandothermedi-
cations to treat ADHD were the most commonly prescribed
class of psychotropic medications for youths.
Mental Health Care of Children and Adolescents
Population rates of visits with mental disorder diagnoses
and psychotropic medication prescriptions significantly
increased for children and adolescents during the study
period. Visits resulting in a diagnosis of psychotic or devel-
opmental disorder increased significantly faster among chil-
dren than among adolescents, to the point where the 2 age
groups had similar population-based visit rates by 2007-
2010. By contrast, visits resulting in diagnoses of disruptive
behavior disorders and visits resulting in prescriptions for
stimulants and other medications to treat ADHD increased
significantly more rapidly among adolescents than among
children. By 2007-2010, children and adolescents had simi-
lar population rates of visits in which these medications
were prescribed (eTable 1 in Supplement). In a post hoc
analysis, stimulants accounted for 91.26% of child visits and
89.24% of adolescent visits in which medications to treat
ADHD were prescribed in 2007-2010.
Mental Health Care of Young People by Psychiatrists
and Nonpsychiatrist Physicians
Among youths, the rate of visits resulting in mental disorder
diagnoses increased significantly more quickly for nonpsy-
chiatrist physicians than for psychiatrists. Significantly faster
growth in nonpsychiatrist than psychiatrist visits occurred for
disruptive behavior disorders, mood disorders, and the re-
sidual group of mental disorders. The rate of youth psycho-
tropic medication visits significantly increased for both pro-
vider groups but differed by psychotropic drug class.
Antidepressant and antipsychotic visits increased signifi-
cantly faster for nonpsychiatrist physicians than for psychia-
trists, but the reverse was true of anxiolytic visits. In 2007-
2010, nonpsychiatrist physicians provided significantly more
overall psychotropic medication visits than psychiatrists, in-
cluding significantly more visits resulting in prescriptions for
anxiolytics, and stimulants and other medications to treat
ADHD (eTable 2 in Supplement).
Characteristics of Child, Adolescent,
and Adult Mental Disorder Visits
In 2007-2010, several differences were apparent in the demo-
graphic and clinical characteristics of mental disorder visits by
children, adolescents, and adults. Compared with adult and
adolescent mental disorder visits, child mental disorder vis-
its included the largest percentage of male patients, Hispanic
or non-Hispanic black patients, and Medicaid patients. From
child to adolescent to adult mental disorder visits, there was
an increase in the proportion of mood and anxiety disorder di-
agnoses and in antidepressant and anxiolytic prescriptions.
Psychiatrists provided a smaller percentage of mental disor-
der visits to children than to either adolescents or adults
(Table 2). Psychotherapy, which was provided in a minority of
mental disorder visits to each age group, was least prevalent
among child mental disorder visits.
In post hoc analyses (2007-2010), we found that 86.6% of
child, 88.7% of adolescent, and 91.2% of adult mental disor-
der visits that included psychotherapy were to a psychiatrist.
Among mental disorder visits that included a psychotropic
medication prescription (2007-2010), 25.4% of child, 24.9% of
adolescent, and 24.6% of adult visits included new prescrip-
tions. Among mental disorder visits resulting in new psycho-
tropic prescriptions, 72.8% of child, 64.1% of adolescent, and
75.9% of adult visits were to nonpsychiatrist physicians.
Discussion
In contrast to adults who underwent little change in the num-
berofmentaldisordervisitsonapopulationbasis,childrenand
adolescents had an increasing number of visits in which men-
tal disorders were a focus of treatment. This increase was
largely driven by a marked expansion in mental health visits
topediatriciansandothernonpsychiatristphysiciansbyyoung
people. The importance of these trends is underscored by the
substantial role played by office-based medical practices in US
health care; most pediatricians (68.8%), psychiatrists (64.8%),
and adolescent psychiatrists (71.8%) work in office-based
settings.27
The increase in office-based medical visits by youths with
mental disorder diagnoses was broad based and extended to
disruptive behavior disorders, mood disorders, anxiety dis-
orders, and psychoses and developmental disorders. Be-
cause only about one-half of children and adolescents with se-
vere mental disorders28,29 receive treatment for their
symptoms, the growth in the volume of office-based mental
health visits by young people suggests that progress has been
made in reducing the large number of young people with un-
treated psychiatric disorders.
Psychiatrists and nonpsychiatrist physicians serve sepa-
rate but overlapping functions in the delivery of office-based
mental health care to young people. During the study period,
pediatricians and other nonpsychiatrist physicians became
more involved in treating not just ADHD and other disruptive

behavior disorders, but also anxiety, mood, and even devel-
opmentalandpsychoticdisorders.Theseevolvingpracticepat-
terns likely reflect a regional lack of psychiatrists who can treat
children and adolescents,30 changes in mental health treat-
ment-seeking patterns, new mental health financing arrange-
ments, and shifting professional roles. Because most pedia-
triciansbelievethatitistheirresponsibilitytoidentifyandrefer
rather than treat child and adolescent mental disorders other
than ADHD,31,32 their increasing treatment of a far wider range
of mental disorders underscores the need to strengthen the
lines of communication between primary care physicians and
psychiatrists.33 Inresponsetothesepressures,somestateshave
developed programs that provide pediatricians with access to
training and telephone consultations from child and adoles-
cent psychiatrists and other mental health specialists at neigh-
boring academic centers.34 The rapid growth of these
programs35 represents a rational policy response to the sharp
increase in demand for outpatient child mental health care in
office-based medical practice.
An impressive increase occurred in the number of psycho-
tropicmedicationvisitsbychildrenandadolescents.Thenum-
ber of visits resulting in prescriptions for stimulants and other
medications to treat ADHD grew very rapidly for adolescents.
By 2007-2010, the population-based rate of visits resulting in
prescriptions for stimulants and other medications to treat
ADHD was comparable for children and adolescents. The in-
creasing number of children and adolescents being pre-
scribed stimulants and other medications for the treatment of
ADHD may be related to the maturation of ADHD treatment
advocacy campaigns,36 the dissemination of practice guide-
lines for ADHD,37 and a steady stream of new medications and
formulations approved by the US Food and Drug Administra-
tion to treat ADHD in young people.
The growth in the number of stimulant prescriptions to
adolescents raises potential safety concerns. These include ad-
verse psychiatric events,38 risks associated with combining
stimulants with alcohol and other sedatives,39 and the poten-
tialforstimulantabuse.40 Yetsuchsafetyconsiderationsshould
be balanced against the known efficacy of stimulants in treat-
ing ADHD11 and the evidence of undertreatment. A nationally
representative survey conducted in 2002-2004 reported that
40.2% of adolescents with ADHD had never received mental
health services for their symptoms29 and that only 20.4% had
received stimulant medication in the last year.41
Antipsychotics were the fastest growing class of psycho-
tropic medications among young people. Although psychia-
trists continue to account for most office-based antipsy-
choticvisitsamongyoungpeople,thenumberofantipsychotic
prescriptions made by nonpsychiatrist physicians grew very
rapidly during the study period. Concern exists that much of
the growth in antipsychotic treatment of children and adoles-
cents is the result of treating disruptive behavior disorders42
and that antipsychotics are not generally considered a first-
line treatment for these conditions43,44 owing to safety
concerns.45 As pediatricians, family practitioners, and gen-
eral practitioners assume a more prominent role in prescrib-
ing antipsychotics to children and adolescents, more consul-
tations with psychiatrists and other mental health specialists
will be needed to ensure appropriate diagnostic assessments
together with appropriate symptom and adverse event
monitoring.46
The survey data do not offer insight into the determi-
nants or clinical consequences of the disproportionate in-
crease in antipsychotic and antidepressant treatment of young
people by nonpsychiatrist physicians. Detailed practice-
based services research is needed to compare nonpsychia-
trist physicians and psychiatrists with respect to patient se-
lection for these medications, their use in relation to
psychosocial treatments, and duration of treatment. Beyond
characterizing psychotropic treatment patterns, a compara-
tive effectiveness research agenda is needed to compare out-
comes of mental health care provided by generalists and men-
tal health specialists to inform evidence-based guidelines for
when it is appropriate for generalists to treat, as opposed to
diagnose and refer, their patients with psychiatric disorders.47
The number of visits resulting in antidepressant prescrip-
tions to young people also significantly increased. This in-
crease was particularly evident among visits to nonpsychia-
trist physicians. The number of antidepressant prescriptions
to young people by nonpsychiatrist physicians increased be-
tween 1995-1998 and 2003-2006 before decreasing in 2007-
2010, a pattern that may reflect greater reluctance to pre-
scribe antidepressants following the black box warning in
October 2004. During the study period, treatment guidelines
werepublishedthatendorsedantidepressanttreatmentofado-
lescent depression14 and some anxiety disorders.13 In addi-
tion, several antidepressants received the approval of the US
Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of depres-
sion (fluoxetine hydrochloride in 2003 and escitalopram oxa-
late in 2009), panic disorder (sertraline hydrochloride in 1997),
and obsessive-compulsive disorder (fluvoxamine maleate in
1997, sertraline hydrochloride in 2002, and fluoxetine hydro-
chloride in 2003) among youths.
Beyond specific factors, some general considerations may
have further fueled the increased number of psychotropic vis-
its among children and adolescents. During the study period,
individuals in the United States became more willing to take
psychotropic medications for different conditions, including
relatively minor concerns such as coping with the stresses of
life.48 The US Food and Drug Administration Modernization
Act (1997) encouraged pharmaceutical manufacturers to study
their approved drugs in pediatric populations by extending ex-
isting marketing protections for an additional 6 months. The
decreasing stigma associated with seeking treatment for men-
tal health problems, which has been especially pronounced
among younger individuals, may have further contributed to
the increasing number of prescriptions of psychotropic medi-
cations to young people.49 Although probably less important
foryoungpeoplethanadults,thedevelopmentofdiseaseman-
agement and other insurance- and employer-driven mental
health quality-of-care efforts for depression and other men-
tal disorders may have contributed to the increase in the num-
ber of psychotropic and mental disorder visits during this
period.50-52
Psychotherapy visits to physicians by children and ado-
lescents remained fairly constant during the study period and

substantially more common among adolescents than chil-
dren. Although substantially fewer youth visits include psy-
chotherapy than psychotropic medications, considerable
progress has been made in the development of specific
evidence-based psychotherapies for some of the most com-
mon child and adolescent mental disorders.53-55 Moreover, it
remains far from clear whether ongoing changes in the orga-
nization and financing of mental health care will continue to
support a robust role for psychiatrists and other physicians in
providing psychotherapy to young people.56 In evaluating
these trends, it is important to bear in mind that psycho-
therapy provided by psychologists and social workers, which
accounts for approximately one-half of psychotherapy provi-
sion, is not included in the analysis.15
In contrast to adult mental disorder visits, which were pre-
dominantly by female patients, adolescent and especially child
mental disorder visits were mostly by male patients. This sex
difference likely reflects underlying differences in the treated
mentaldisorders.Disruptivebehaviordisorders,whicharemore
commonly diagnosed in male patients than female patients,57
accounted for most of the child mental disorder visits. Anxiety
and mood disorders, which occur more commonly among
female patients than male patients,58,59 were the most com-
mon diagnoses among the adult mental disorder visits. Higher
rates of disruptive behavior disorders among ethnic/racial
minorities60,61 may also help to explain the larger proportion of
child,ratherthanadolescentoradult,mentaldisordervisitsthat
were by Hispanic and non-Hispanic black patients. Medicaid,
which is available to all low-income children, paid for a larger
shareofchild,ratherthanadult,mentaldisordervisitsandmay
also help to account for the ethnic/racial visit distributions.
These analyses have several limitations. First, the Na-
tional Ambulatory Medical Care Survey samples visits rather
than patients. Because an unknown quantity of patient dupli-
cation occurs, it is not possible to derive the number of unique
people who are treated in office-based practice with various
indications of mental health care each year. However, be-
cause each physician is randomly assigned to 1 of 52 weeks in
the survey year, duplication likely has only a limited effect on
national estimates of unduplicated visits. Second, diagnoses
are based on the independent judgment of the treating phy-
sician, rather than research diagnostic interviews. Third, in-
formation is not available concerning dosages of the psycho-
tropic medications, duration of treatment episodes, which
medications are intended to treat which disorders, type of psy-
chotherapy provided by nonphysician health care profession-
als, and medication prescriptions by nonphysicians. Fourth,
physician nonresponse may have biased the observed pat-
tern of mental health care use. Finally, the sample is restricted
to physician visits in office-based and community health cen-
ter practices and therefore does not capture visits to commu-
nity mental health centers, hospital outpatient clinics, emer-
gency departments, and various other outpatient settings that
may disproportionately serve low-income families.62 For these
reasons, the population-based results should not be inter-
pretedasrepresentingpopulation-widementalhealthcareuse.
Conclusions
Overthelastseveralyears,therehasbeenanexpansioninmen-
talhealthcaretochildrenandadolescentsinoffice-basedmedi-
cal practice. This growth, which coincided with an increase in
the number of prescriptions of psychotropic medications, of-
fers new clinical opportunities to relieve the psychological dis-
tress associated with the common childhood and adolescent
psychiatric disorders. Yet it also poses risks related to adverse
medicationeffects,45,63 deliveryofnonÂ­evidence-basedcare,64
and poorly coordinated services.65 The bulk of the increased
provision for child and adolescent mental health care in office-
based medical settings occurred outside of psychiatric prac-
tice. With these evolving practice patterns, tensions will in-
evitably arise between access and quality of care. To meet this
challenge, there is a pressing need to develop and implement
effective models of collaboration among pediatricians, fam-
ilypractitionersandothernonpsychiatristphysicianswhotreat
children and adolescents, and suitably trained mental health
care specialists.35,66
