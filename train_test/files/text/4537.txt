Abstract
Objective: To investigate emergence times with different fresh gas flow rates, following desflurane
anaesthesia.
Methods: Patients undergoing surgery with desflurane anaesthesia were randomly assigned to
receive fresh gas flow rates of 100% oxygen during emergence of 2 l/min (group D2), 4 l/min (group
D4) or 6 l/min (group D6). Time to eye opening, spontaneous movement and extubation
(emergence time) were assessed after desflurane discontinuation. The end-tidal concentration of
desflurane and bispectral index were recorded at each of these timepoints.
Results: A total of 105 patients were included in the study, with 35 in each of the three groups.
Mean times to extubation were 17.6 min, 9.9 min and 9.1 min in groups D2, D4 and D6,
respectively. Times to eye opening, spontaneous movement and extubation in group D2 were
significantly longer than in groups D4 and D6.
Conclusions: These results suggest that there is the potential to predict emergence time based
on fresh gas flow rate following desflurane anaesthesia. It should therefore be possible to use a low-
flow technique during the emergence period, in addition to the maintenance period, without
delaying recovery if the inhaled anaesthetic is stopped at the predicted time before the end of
surgery.

Introduction
Reducing the fresh gas flow rate during
anaesthesia could reduce both costs and the
emission of environmental contaminants.
The use of `low-flow' anaesthesia during
induction is problematic, because initial
delivery of the anaesthetic gas to the lungs
and the brain must be rapid.1 However, low-
flow techniques have been introduced
successfully during the maintenance of
anaesthesia, and have had substantial eco-
nomic benefits.2­7 As a result, the use of low
flow rates (2 l/min or below) has increased.8
To achieve fast recovery of consciousness,
ventilation with high flow rates of oxygen
(5 l/min or more) during the emergence
phase is common.9 However, the adminis-
tration of inhaled anaesthetics is generally
continued until the surgery is complete.
Despite the potential economic and envir-
onmental advantages of terminating the
administration of inhaled anaesthetics early
during emergence,1,10 no study to date has
investigated the time to emergence in this
context or evaluated the economic benefits
of early cessation of inhaled anaesthesia. In
low-flow anaesthesia, the alveolar concen-
tration of inhaled anaesthetics changes very
slowly; therefore, after their administration
is terminated, their concentration decreases
only gradually. The consumption of inhaled
anaesthetics could theoretically be reduced
by stopping their administration at a calcu-
lated point before the end of the surgery,
with the patient remaining under anaesthe-
sia. The aim of the present study was to
investigate the emergence time after the
termination of desflurane using different
fresh gas flow rates.
Patients and methods
Patients
Patients aged 18­64 years and classified as
American Society of Anesthesiologists class
I or II, scheduled to undergo elective surgery
under general anaesthesia using desflurane
in the Department of Anaesthesia and Pain
Medicine, Hanyang University School
Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea,
between October 2012 and April 2013 were
recruited to the study. Exclusion criteria
included cardiovascular disease with a left
ventricular ejection fraction of <40%, sur-
gery time of >5 h, pregnancy or lactation,
tonsillectomy, nasal surgery, dental surgery,
surgery in a prone or lateral position, heart
surgery and lung surgery.
The methods and aims of the study were
explained to the patients, all of whom
provided written informed consent. The
study protocol was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Hanyang
University Seoul Hospital (approval
number 2012-07-012-005, approval date
September 25, 2012) and was registered in
a public trial registry at the Clinical
Research Information Service (http://cris.
nih.go.kr/cris/index.jsp) (KCT0000603).
General anaesthesia conditions
All patients fasted and did not take any
analgesics or sedatives for 12 h before sur-
gery. In the operating room, the patient's
vital signs were monitored using electrocar-
diography, a noninvasive blood pressure
monitor and pulse oximetry. The patient's
level of consciousness was monitored using a
bispectral index (BIS) sensor attached to the
forehead and connected to a BIS monitor
(2000A, Aspect Medical Systems, Norwood,
MA, USA).
Anaesthesia was induced by an intraven-
ous injection of propofol (1.5 mg/kg), fol-
lowed by rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg) to
facilitate intubation and remifentanil
(0.25 mg/kg) as an analgesic. During the
operation, anaesthesia was maintained with
desflurane in oxygen (inspiratory fraction 0.5
at a flow rate of 2 l/min) in the presence of
remifentanil, using a Dra
¨ ger Cato anaes-
thetic machine (Dra
¨ ger, Lubeck, Germany).
1286 Journal of International Medical Research 42(6)
Desflurane administration was maintained to
give an end-tidal concentration of 5­6 vol%
until termination of inhaled anaesthesia.
The infusion of remifentanil was adjusted
for eachpatient during the operation, depend-
ing on their vital signs and BIS values.
Emergence conditions
Approximately 20 min before the termin-
ation of desflurane administration, pyri-
dostigmine and glycopyrrolate were
administered to reverse muscle relaxation,
indicated by a train of four !90% (mea-
sured using MiniStimÕ, Life-Tech, TX,
USA). Remifentanil was maintained at
0.05 mg/kg per min until the patient gained
consciousness and responded to verbal com-
mands. Desflurane administration was ter-
minated at the end of the surgery.
Patients were randomly assigned, using a
computerized randomization program, to
receive fresh gas flow rates of 100%
oxygen after discontinuation of desflurane
of 2 l/min (group D2), 4 l/min (group D4) or
6 l/min (group D6). One anaesthetist woke
the patients after surgery, while a second
anaesthetist simultaneously recorded all
emergence-related data.
If no spontaneous ventilation was
observed at the termination of desflurane
administration, the ventilator was switched
to synchronised intermittent mandatory
ventilation mode. If spontaneous ventilation
was present, manually assisted ventilation
was performed, keeping pace with the spon-
taneous ventilation. The partial pressure of
end-tidal carbon dioxide was maintained at
30­40 mmHg. No stimulation or suction
was provided until the patient opened their
eyes or moved. Once the patient had
responded to a verbal command, the admin-
istration of remifentanil was terminated.
Deep breathing with 100% oxygen
(6 l/min) was then administered to patients
in all three groups. After suction of the
endotracheal secretions, the endotracheal
tube was removed. The patient was moni-
tored for excessive agitation during emer-
gence and recovery (for up to 60 min),
indicated by an inability to communicate
or the need for medication or restraints due
to overexcitement.
Monitoring during emergence
Patients were asked to open their eyes 3 min
and 6 min after the termination of desflurane
and every 1 min after that. The time to eye
opening, time to spontaneous movement
and time to extubation (emergence time)
were recorded. The end-tidal desflurane
concentration and BIS were also recorded
at each of these time points. From the end of
desflurane administration until the endotra-
cheal tube was removed, mean arterial
pressure and heart rate were recorded
every 3 min, then at 1 min after extubation.
The patient's memory of the surgery was
tested by verbal questioning 30 min after
transfer to a recovery room and then 24 h
after surgery.
Statistical analyses
In a pilot study of 35 patients (unpublished
data), times to extubation were 17.4 Æ
4.3 min, 8.8 Æ 1.8 min and 9.8 Æ 2.1 min in
groups D2, D4 and D6, respectively; extuba-
tion times were significantly longer in group
D2 than group D4 (P ¼ 0.017) and group D6
(P ¼ 0.025), but there was no significant
difference between groups D4 and D6. In
order to detect a 1-min difference between the
groups at a 5% level of significance and 80%
power, at least 33 patients would be required
in each group. To allow for dropouts, a
group size of 35 patients was chosen.
Data were reported as either the
mean Æ SD or n. Fisher's exact test was
used to analyse differences according to sex.
The three groups were compared via one-
way analysis of variance followed by a post-
hoc Dunnett's test for multiple comparisons.

Pearson's correlation analysis was per-
formed to assess relationships between the
demographic variables and emergence time
(time to extubation). A P-value <0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant. All
statistical analysis were performed using
SAS software version 9.2 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, USA).
Results
A total of 105 patients were included in the
study, with 35 in each of the three groups.
There were no significant differences
between the groups in terms of sex, age,
height, weight, body mass index, duration of
surgery or duration of anaesthesia (Table 1).
Time to eye opening, time to spontaneous
movement and time to extubation were
significantly longer in group D2 than
in groups D4 and D6 (P < 0.001 for all)
(Table 2). There were no significant differ-
ences in these parameters between groups
D4 and D6.
There were no significant differences in

increased as flow rate decreased, with all

emergence or recovery.
Discussion
In the present study, the times from desflur-
ane discontinuation to extubation were
17.6 Æ 5.6 min, 9.9 Æ 2.8 min and 9.1 Æ
3.2 min in groups D2, D4 and D6, respect-
ively, which are in good agreement with the
results of the pilot study (17.4 Æ 4.3 min,
8.8 Æ 1.8 min and 9.8 Æ 2.1 min, respect-
ively). These results suggest that it is possible
to predict emergence time based on fresh gas
flow rate following desflurane anaesthesia.
As expected, the time to extubation
increased with decreasing fresh gas flow
rate; with a low gas flow rate the proportion
of inhaled anaesthetic in the patient's body
and the anaesthetic circuit that is discharged
through the vacuum pump system is small
during emergence, and the patient's
rebreathing rate will be increased. As a
result, the anaesthetic concentration will
decline very gradually. Therefore, if desflur-
ane administration is terminated at a pre-
determined time before the end of surgery, a
low-flow rate can be continued until
emergence.
Contrary to expectations, there were no
statistically significant differences in time to
eye opening, time to spontaneous movement
or time to extubation between groups D4
and D6. Likewise, no significant difference
was detected between end-tidal desflurane
concentrations measured at these times
(except at time to spontaneous movement).
This could be because fresh gas flow rates of
4 l/min or above matched the minute venti-
lation very closely, such that little or no gas
was reused in the system.11 Therefore, it is
likely that a rate of 4 l/min is sufficient to
wake patients. As oxygen and anaesthetic
gases are expensive, increasing the flow rate
to more than 5 l/min may not be economical,
especially if it is unlikely to improve
outcomes.
In group D2, the end-tidal desflurane
concentration was significantly higher than
that of the other groups at eye opening,
spontaneous movement and extubation.
Because the BIS values did not differ between
the low-flow group and the other treatment
groups, inadequate emergence did not seem
to occur. All the end-tidal desflurane con-
centrations were lower at these timepoints
than the minimum alveolar concentrations
at which an anaesthetized patient responds
appropriately to spoken commands reported
by Song et al.12 and Chortkoff et al.13 This is
likely to be due to the effect of remifentanil,
as opioids can reduce minimum alveolar
concentration values via interaction with
inhaled anaesthetics.14­16
Because the administration of inhaled
anaesthetic should be terminated early in
clinical applications, there was concern
about whether patients would be more
aware than would usually be expected.
However, none of the patients reported
having any memory of the surgery.
As the anaesthetic concentration
decreased slowly in the low-flow group
during emergence, the difference in concen-
tration between the brain and the lungs was
small. Because the rates of emergence agita-
tion, and of increased mean arterial pressure
and heart rate, are likely to be lower than in

time to extubation and other variables following

high-flow groups, a more stable and smooth
emergence was originally expected in the
low-flow group. However, in the present
study there was no particular advantage in
terms of emergence agitation, mean arterial
pressure or heart rate in the low-flow group,
possibly because remifentanil was also used.
In the present study, body weight and the
associated characteristic of body mass index
were both significantly correlated with time
to extubation, whereas age, sex and height
were not. However, since patients aged
! 65 years were excluded from the study,
these results cannot be generalised to those
in this age group.
The lowest fresh gas flow rate used in the
present study was 2 l/min. However, it may
be necessary to study emergence at even
lower flow rates. The results of the present
study allow prediction of the emergence time
with fresh gas flow rates of 2, 4 or 6 l/min, a
mean end-tidal desflurane concentration of
5.4 vol% at the termination of desflurane
administration for an approximately 3-h
surgical procedure using desflurane and
remifentanil. Many factors can affect the
recovery pattern.17­22 The rate of recovery is
faster with desflurane anaesthesia than with
sevoflurane, and is faster with sevoflurane
anaesthesia than with isoflurane.
Furthermore, it is also delayed with a pro-
longed operation time, lower fresh gas flow
rate and higher fraction of inhalation anaes-
thetic. Thus, adjustments will be required
according to the individual situation. The
development of devices for automatically
controlling the end-tidal inhalation anaes-
thetic concentration has allowed the main-
tenance of the targeted end-tidal volatile
anaesthetic concentration at a low fresh gas
flow with small amounts of inhalation
anaesthetic.23,24 If this strategy is used
during the emergence period, patients can
be awakened more comfortably and cost
effectively, compared with other strategies.
The findings of the present study failed to
clarify the economic benefits of a rate of 2 l/
min during emergence. While the economic
benefits of low flow rates have been reported
previously,1,2,4,6 they are extremely difficult
to estimate during the emergence phase
alone. Using the computer simulation pro-
gram Gas ManÕ version 4.2 (http://
www.gasmanweb.com/software.html), with
a low fresh gas flow of 2 l/min during surgery
and emergence and an end-tidal desflurane
concentration of 5.4 vol% (patient body
weight 60 kg), about 1 l of desflurane can
be saved compared with a high flow rate of
6 l/min, giving a cost saving of $1.6 at a
liquid desflurane cost of $35.5/100 ml. If
anaesthesia is maintained at 4 l/min, about
1.9 l of delivered desflurane can be saved,
resulting in a cost saving of $3.2. The savings
in terms of cost and volume of inhalation
agent used are small, and the cost of anaes-
thesia is much lower than the cost of
surgery, suggesting that, if only emergence
was considered, the economic benefits
would be minor. However, even if the
economic benefit in each individual patient
is small, the cumulative savings could be
large.
In conclusion, it is possible to use a low-
flow technique during the emergence period
as well as the maintenance period without
delaying recovery if the inhaled anaesthetic
is stopped at a predicted time before the end
of surgery. This may help to reduce anaes-
thetic consumption, with potential global
environmental and economic benefits.
Further clinical trials to investigate low-
flow rates during emergence are warranted.
