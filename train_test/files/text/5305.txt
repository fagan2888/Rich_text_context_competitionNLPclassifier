Introduction
Studies by thousands of scientists have established that
human activities are changing the Earth's climate, princi-
pally through raising the concentration of radiatively active
(greenhouse) gases in the atmosphere. Reports from the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC; 2013)
bring much of this evidence together. National science acad-
emies, and organizations representing hundreds of thousands
of scientists, have issued their own statements or reports on
the risks of anthropogenic climate change (ACC; National
Aeronautics and Space Administration [NASA], 2016).
Direct surveys of scientists find levels of agreement on the
reality of ACC ranging from 87% among American
Association for the Advancement of Science members gen-
erally, to 93% among working PhD Earth scientists (Pew
Research Center, 2015) or 97% among active climate
research scientists (Anderegg, Prall, Harold, & Schneider,
2010; Doran & Zimmerman, 2009). Two analyses of pub-
lished research similarly report high-90s agreement on the
reality of ACC (Cook et al., 2013; Oreskes, 2004).
Synthesizing recent studies, Cook et al. (2016) observe that
the level of consensus rises with expertise of the scientists
considered: Agreement is strongest among the most active
researchers.
In contrast to the overwhelming consensus among scien-
tists, acceptance of ACC remains stubbornly lower among
the U.S. public--until recently, polling mostly in the mid-
50s on surveys (e.g., Hamilton, Hartter, Lemcke-Stampone,
Moore, & Safford, 2015; Leiserowitz, Maibach, Roser-
Renouf, Feinberg, & Rosenthal, 2015). Similar fractions of
the public concede a scientific consensus on the reality of
ACC. Individual perceptions that ACC is real, and that most
scientists agree on this point, correlate with each other and
have similar background predictors (e.g., Hamilton & Saito,
2015), to such an extent they could be two indicators for one
underlying dimension (Kahan, 2015a; Kahan, Jenkins-
Smith, & Braman, 2011). Other researchers have argued that
their correlation reflects causality. According to this view,

Public Awareness of the Scientific
Consensus on Climate
Lawrence C. Hamilton1
Abstract
Questions about climate change elicit some of the widest political divisions of any items on recent U.S. surveys. Severe
polarization affects even basic questions about the reality of anthropogenic climate change (ACC), or whether most scientists
agree that humans are changing the Earth's climate. Statements about scientific consensus have been contentious among
social scientists, with some arguing for consensus awareness as a "gateway cognition" that leads to greater public acceptance
of ACC, but others characterizing consensus messaging (deliberate communication about the level of scientific agreement)
as a counterproductive tactic that exacerbates polarization. A series of statewide surveys, with nationwide benchmarks,
repeated questions about the reality of ACC and scientific consensus many times over 2010 to 2016. These data permit tests
for change in beliefs and polarization. ACC and consensus beliefs have similar trends and individual background predictors.
Both rose gradually by about 10 points over 2010 to 2016, showing no abrupt shifts that might correspond to events such as
scientific reports, leadership statements, or weather. Growing awareness of the scientific consensus, whether from deliberate
messaging or the cumulative impact of many studies and publicly engaged scientists, provides the most plausible explanation
for this rise in both series. In state-level data, the gap between liberal and conservative views on the reality of ACC did not
widen over this period, whereas the liberal­conservative gap regarding existence of a scientific consensus narrowed.

awareness of the scientific consensus comprises a gateway
cognition: a key belief or understanding which, if accepted,
makes people more likely also to accept that ACC is real, or
that action is needed to slow it (van der Linden, Leiserowitz,
Feinberg, & Maibach, 2014). Experimentally, consensus
messaging or providing information about the extent of sci-
entific agreement can increase subsequently expressed
acceptance of ACC (Lewandowsky, Gignac, & Vaughan,
2013; Maibach, Myers, & Leiserowitz, 2014; van der Linden,
Leiserowitz, Feinberg, & Maibach, 2015; van der Linden,
Leiserowitz, & Maibach, 2016). Some analyses of survey
questions about consensus and climate report findings con-
sistent with this gateway role (Ding, Maibach, Zhao, Roser-
Renouf, & Leiserowitz, 2011; McCright, Dunlap, & Xiao,
2013; also see Aklin & Urpelainen, 2014).
Experimental and survey approaches have complementary
strengths and limitations. Experiments can show that certain
responses change after exposure to information, which pro-
vides good evidence for causality in that context, but does not
answer how effects scale up over longer periods in uncontrolled
social environments where contrary information is abundant.
Non-experimental surveys sample views from such uncon-
trolled environments, but provide mainly indirect evidence
about causality. The gateway and same-dimension hypotheses
need not be mutually exclusive, however. That belief in agree-
ment among scientists might in some instances or for some
people influence beliefs about ACC, whereas in other cases
they measure essentially the same thing, is quite plausible
although analytically intractable.
Kahan (2016) takes a position against consensus messaging:
"All the `social marketing'of `scientific consensus'does is aug-
ment the toxic idioms of contempt that are poisoning our sci-
ence communication environment." In part, his view is based on
data in which public perceptions about the scientific consensus
show less polarization than perceptions about ACC itself. Also,
the degree of polarization (the gap between people with oppo-
site ideologies or worldviews) tends to be widest among those
with higher education or information by several measures. More
basically, he argues that there has been little movement in con-
sensus or ACC perceptions despite "a decades-long social mar-
keting campaign" to inform people (Kahan, 2015b).
But has there been recent movement on either question?
Is polarization consistently rising? These questions are test-
able with data from a lengthening time series of random-
sample surveys covering one northeastern U.S. state since
2010. The surveys carried two basic questions assessing pub-
lic thoughts on the reality of ACC and agreement among sci-
entists. Benchmarked by nationwide surveys that asked the
same questions, the statewide data provide unique temporal
resolution for tracking change.
Survey Data
Since spring of 2010, the Granite State Poll (GSP), run by the
Survey Center at the University of New Hampshire, has car-
ried the same basic climate-change question alongside its
usual mix of political and other topics including science and
environment.1 Table 1 gives the wording of the climate-change
Hamilton 3
question (climate); the order of response choices is rotated by
telephone interviewers to avoid possible bias. One of these
choices--climate change is happening now, caused mainly by
human activities--corresponds to the central point of many
statements by scientific organizations (e.g., the first sentence
inAmerican Geophysical Union [AGU], 2013).As of summer
2016, this question had been asked in more than 15,000 inter-
views in 26 New Hampshire surveys, plus a similar number of
interviews in other regional or national surveys (Hamilton
et al., 2015; Hamilton, 2016).
A second question with parallel wording (consensus) asks
whether respondents think most scientists agree that climate
change is happening now, caused mainly by human activi-
ties. This question appeared on 11 of the New Hampshire
surveys. Table 1 gives probability-weighted response per-
centages for climate and consensus from the most recent year
of New Hampshire surveys (2016), and for comparison also
the same questions on the U.S. nationwide Polar,
Environment, and Science (POLES) survey conducted in
August 2016 (Hamilton, 2016). Background characteristics
age, gender, education, and ideology are summarized for
both surveys as well.
Figure 1 graphically compares the climate and consensus
responses. Sixty-three percent of both New Hampshire and
U.S. respondents think that climate change is happening
now, caused mainly by human activities; and 64% or 66%
think that most scientists agree on this point. The visual simi-
larity between climate and consensus beliefs is striking, and
its implication of substantial overlap is true. Of those who
think that climate change is happening now, caused mainly
by human activities, 85% (New Hampshire) or 86% (United
States) also think that most scientists agree on this point.
How representative are the New Hampshire data? In
terms of the overall percentages, Figure 1 suggests they are
close. Hamilton et al. (2015) show overlapping confidence
intervals across a larger set of New Hampshire and national
surveys that asked the same climate question. A Gallup sur-
vey in March 2016, with differently worded questions, pro-
vides another national benchmark: 59% ± 4% believe the
effects of global warming have already begun and 65% ± 4%
believe that increases in global temperatures over the past
century are due more to human activities than to nature (Saad
& Jones, 2016). Although mildly inconsistent with each
other, either Gallup result roughly agrees with the 63% ± 2%
of New Hampshire respondents choosing now/human. Both
Gallup percentages in 2016 were the highest for at least 8
years. The 63% now/human responses to climate on the 2016
POLES survey likewise is notably higher than on national
surveys that had asked this question in 2011, 2012, or 2014.
New Hampshire results conform to a similar pattern, with
2016 percentages that are highest in the 7-year history of this
question.

From these comparisons and others, it appears that New
Hampshire provides a usable proxy, giving similar-to-national
overall percentages on climate issues although generally
wider-than-national divisions by political party (Hamilton
et al., 2015). The regional scope of the New Hampshire sur-
veys is a limitation, but they also have strengths: sharper
(quarterly) temporal resolution than national counterparts,
with consistent frames, wording, and methods under the same
investigators throughout the whole series.
Changing Views on Climate and
Consensus
Figure 2Agraphs the percentage of now/human responses to cli-
mate on 26 New Hampshire surveys (n = 15,931) from April
2010 to July 2016, along with four national surveys.AJuly 2016
New Hampshire survey and the August 2016 U.S. POLES sur-
vey form the two rightmost data points in Figure 2A. This plot
suggestsanunevenupwardtrendinacceptanceofACC,amount-
ing to about 10 points over this period. New Hampshire's confi-
dence intervals overlap with each of the four national surveys.
National Community and Environment in Rural America
(NCERA) is a representative 50-state telephone survey orga-
nized by University of New Hampshire researchers in sum-
mer 2011 (n = 2,006).
General Social Survey (GSS) is a representative national
survey based on face-to-face interviews, conducted by the
National Opinion Research Center, University of Chicago, in
2012 (n = 1,295).
iMediaEthics Poll on Climate Change (IME) is a repre-
sentative national telephone survey conducted by Princeton
Survey Research Associates International in July 2014 (n =
1,002).
POLES is a representative national telephone survey
organized by University of New Hampshire and Columbia
University researchers in August 2016 (n = 704).
Hamilton et al. (2015) give references concerning the
NCERA, GSS, and IME surveys. The supporting informa-
tion archived with that paper includes complete NCERA and
IME data sets. The August 2016 POLES survey is described
by Hamilton (2016).
Ideological or partisan divisions are a dominant feature of
climate-change questions in surveys. For the New Hampshire
time series, Figure 2B breaks down the percentage of now/
human responses to climate by ideology, on a 5-point scale
from liberal to conservative.2 Percentages based on the
smaller subsamples forming each ideological category exhibit
more random variation, but show a persistently wide gap
between conservatives and liberals. Figure 2B visualizes the
strong polarization of climate-change responses in surveys.

The most conservative respondents are farthest from other
groups; see Hamilton and Saito (2015) for other instances of
that pattern.
Figure 3 employs a similar format to display results for the
consensus question, tracking the percentage of respondents
who think most scientists agree that human activities are chang-
ing the climate. It bears emphasizing that this consensus ques-
tion asks whether respondents think that most scientists agree
about the existence of ACC, not about all of its details where
scientific disagreements and new advances naturally occur.
Although based on fewer interviews (n = 5,872 from 11 sur-
veys for New Hampshire, along with the NCERA, IME, and
POLES national surveys), the consensus results in Figure 3
generally resemble those for climate in Figure 2. There is an
uneven upward drift of roughly 10 points overall (Figure 3A).
Again, the confidence intervals of New Hampshire results
overlap with those of contemporary national surveys. The lib-
eral­conservative gap in Figure 3B is slightly narrower than
that in Figure 2B: Beliefs about agreement among scientists are
marginally less polarized than beliefs about ACC itself.
Individual Background and Ideology Effects
In Figures 2 and 3, climate and consensus beliefs exhibit
similar patterns of slow upward drift. To test formally
whether the percentage accepting ACC or recognizing agree-
ment among scientists has risen, we can include year in a
standard regression framework that has been widely used to
model individual-level predictors of climate beliefs.
Table 2 gives results from weighted logit regression of
climate and consensus on respondent age, sex, education,
and ideology (questions and coding defined in Table 1).3
Models 1 and 2, based on New Hampshire data, also test for
net effects from survey year (2010-2016). Model 1 does so
using data from all 26 New Hampshire surveys that carried
the climate question (estimation sample, n = 14,265),
whereas Model 2 employs only the 11 surveys that asked the
consensus question (estimation sample, n = 5,313). Models 3
and 4 give results from the POLES survey for a national
comparison (2016 only). The fit of each model is summa-
rized by probability-weighted versions of the count R2 and
adjusted count R2 statistics described in Long and Freese
(2014).
Interaction effects involving education and ideology have
been detected in many survey and experimental data sets.
Their common form is that ideological divisions regarding
climate change widen with education, such that the best edu-
cated partisans stand the farthest apart. This occurs not only
with education but also with other information indicators
such as self-assessed understanding, or more objective tests

of science literacy, numeracy, cognitive reflection, or science
intelligence. It occurs also whether ideology is indicated by
respondent's self-identification on a liberal to conservative
scale, political party, religiosity, or more elaborate measures
of worldview (e.g., Hamilton, 2008, 2011; Hamilton &
Keim, 2009; Hamilton, Cutler, & Schaefer, 2012; Kahan,
2015a; Kahan et al., 2011; McCright & Dunlap, 2011; Shao,
Keim, Garland, & Hamilton, 2014). Finally, such interac-
tions affect some non-climate views too--for example,
regarding evolution, vaccines, scientists, or environmental
protection in general (e.g., Hamilton, Colocousis, & Duncan,
2010; Hamilton, Hartter, & Saito, 2015; Hamilton & Safford,
2015; Hamilton & Saito, 2015).
The models in Table 2 fit reasonably well (adjusted count
R2 from 18%-34%) and confirm that climate-change and
consensus beliefs have mostly the same individual-level pre-
dictors. Coefficients shown are odds ratios, or multiplicative
effects on the odds of thinking that humans are changing the
climate (climate = 1) or that most scientists agree (consensus
= 1). The odds of thinking that humans are changing the cli-
mate, or that most scientists agree on this, decline with age.
Women more often than men accept that humans are chang-
ing the climate, but gender makes little difference in percep-
tions of the scientific consensus. Odds ratios significantly
above 1.0 for the main effect of education indicate that
among moderate respondents (ideology = 0), the odds of
accepting ACC, or that scientists agree, increase with higher
education. Odds ratios below 1.0 for the main effect of ideol-
ogy indicate that among respondents with technical school or
some college education (education = 0), the odds of accept-
ing ACC, or that scientists agree, decline as ideology
becomes more conservative.
Figure 4 visualizes the New Hampshire education × ide-
ology interaction effects, which are significant and similar in
the U.S. POLES data as well. These adjusted marginal plots
(Mitchell, 2012) depict probabilities and 95% confidence
intervals. Their right-opening megaphone shapes resemble
those found in many studies cited above. Here, we see that
among liberals and moderates, the probability of thinking
that humans are changing the climate, or that most scientists
agree on this point, rises with education. Among moderately
conservative respondents, however, education has virtually
no effect. Among the most conservative, belief that humans
are changing the climate or that most scientists agree declines
with higher education.
Viewing plots of this general type, some analysts have
concluded that information itself causes polarization. Given
the occurrence of similar patterns with diverse information
or education indicators, however, it seems more plausibly
attributed to general processes of biased assimilation
(Corner, Whitmarsh, & Xenias, 2012; McCright & Dunlap,
2011), elite cues (Brulle, Carmichael, & Jenkins, 2012;
Darmofal, 2005), and related concepts (Campbell & Kay,
2014; Kahan et al., 2011; Taber & Lodge, 2006; Wood &
Vedlitz, 2007). Better educated or informed individuals more
actively acquire information, which sometimes involves fil-
tering to support ideological beliefs. In reactions to experi-
mental scenarios, such processes might appear left/right
symmetrical, with opposite bias affecting both ends of the
spectrum. In practice, however, it is much easier to find top-
ics (such as climate or evolution) where liberal and moderate
views align with a major scientific consensus, whereas con-
servatives oppose it, rather than the reverse. A corresponding
asymmetry appears in survey findings that liberals and mod-
erates express greater trust than conservatives regarding sci-
ence in general (Gauchat, 2012; Nadelson et al., 2014), or as
a source of information in specific domains including not
only climate and evolution but also vaccines, nuclear power
safety, and genetically modified organisms (Hamilton, 2015;
Hamilton et al., 2015).

Time plots in Figures 2A and 3A suggest that public
acceptance of ACC and a scientific consensus have drifted
upward over the past 7 years. Models 1 and 2 in Table 2 test
this hypothesis by including survey year along with respon-
dent characteristics among the predictors. Both find signifi-
cant (p < .001) positive effects. The odds of thinking that
human activities are changing the climate increased about
6% (multiplied by 1.06) per year over this period, whereas
the odds of thinking that most scientists agree increased
somewhat faster, by about 9% per year. If awareness of the
scientific consensus acts as a gateway cognition, then we
might expect acceptance of ACC to change a bit more slowly
as it seems to do here.
Trends in Polarization
The New Hampshire analysis agrees with national reports
that public belief in the reality of ACC, and of a scientific
consensus on this point, have recently risen (Saad & Jones,
2016). There also is evidence that national polarization con-
currently increased (Dunlap, McCright, & Yarosh, 2016), but
in New Hampshire, it appears to have decreased. Figure 5
quantifies polarization as the distance between climate views
of liberal and conservative respondents, or between those of
moderately liberal and moderately conservative respondents.
Graphed points correspond to distances from lowest to high-
est lines (or from second lowest to second highest) in Figure
2B. Averaged by simple regression in the graph, the liberal/
conservative gap narrows slightly, and not significantly, from
66 to 58 points. The moderately liberal/moderately conserva-
tive gap remains unchanged at about 36.
Figure 6 performs a similar analysis addressing the more
contentious (among researchers) issue of polarization about
the scientific consensus. In this case, both trend lines show
mild but statistically significant narrowing, by about 10
points, of the gap between liberals and conservatives. Thus,
our New Hampshire time series indicate that contrary to
national trends (Dunlap et al., 2016), polarization regarding
ACC did not increase over this period, and regarding the sci-
entific consensus it clearly declined.
Although trends in ideological polarization are inconsis-
tent, national and state data agree that overall public accep-
tance of ACC and consensus has been rising through small
gains across the ideological spectrum. Whether ideological
divisions have decreased from high levels (as in New
Hampshire), or increased from somewhat lower levels (as
nationally), they remain presently quite wide. Ideological
indicators dominate the variation in individual views, and
ideology moderates effects from education, otherwise the
second most important background predictor.

agree on this reality (B).

Discussion
The scientific case for ACC was well developed before these
surveys began (Weart, 2008), with evidence from many disci-
plines that seemed persuasive to most scientists (Oreskes,
2004). Incremental advances have continued over the past 7
years, but from a public perspective, the contributions of indi-
vidual studies are hard to judge, and prominent new studies are
quickly dismissed with scientific-sounding counterarguments
from contrarians (Dunlap & McCright, 2015). Recognizing

that the general public has limited ability to evaluate research,
or weigh contradictory but scientific-sounding claims, a grow-
ing number of science organizations and individual scientists
engaging with the public have moved to emphasize the extent
of scientific agreement (consensus messaging). This is meant
as a useful heuristic to help non-scientists sort through com-
peting claims, without asserting that whatever scientists agree
upon must be true--broad agreement on the reality of ACC
reflects scientists'own evaluations of the evidence, rather than
being evidence for climate change in itself.
Some commentators have proposed that people acknowl-
edge a scientific consensus, while rejecting the reality of ACC,
because they think most scientists are not credible--and that
this group of doubters is growing.Accusations of hoax and con-
spiracy fuel such a narrative (Dunlap & McCright, 2015;
Lewandowsky, Gignac, & Oberauer, 2013), although the parti-
san sources making those accusations tend also to deny the exis-
tence of a scientific consensus, painting climate research instead
as the project of relatively few individuals and organizations.4
In terms of background characteristics, however, survey
respondents who say they think that ACC is not happening,
but also think most scientists agree that it is (i.e., respond
climate = 0 but consensus = 1) resemble an unsure and pos-
sibly transitional group, rather than committed believers. In
several data sets, those with mixed views tend to be some-
what younger, less educated, and more likely to identify as
moderate or liberal, compared with more "consistent"
respondents who reject both ACC and consensus (i.e., cli-
mate = 0 and consensus = 0).5
Conclusion
Tracked by a series of closely spaced statewide surveys (bench-
marked by nationwide surveys), public acceptance of the real-
ity of ACC and of scientific agreement rose gradually from the
low fifties in 2010 to low sixties by 2016. The observation that
acceptance ofACC and consensus both increased is compatible
with the proposition that implicitly or explicitly communicat-
ing evidence of agreement among scientists encourages public
acceptance of ACC itself. It appears incompatible with the
reverse, that communicating evidence of scientific agreement
could depress overall public acceptance of ACC.
At the individual level, perceptions regarding the reality
of ACC and consensus have similar background predictors.
Ideology is the strongest of these predictors. Moreover, ideo-
logical differences on ACC and consensus tend to be greatest
among respondents with higher education. Over 2010 to
2016, the gap between consensus perceptions of liberals and
conservatives decreased in New Hampshire, although it
increased nationwide, and in both cases remains large.
Has deliberate or incidental communication reinforcing
public awareness of the scientific consensus helped to shift
people's views, or raised acceptance ofACC itself? Our survey
results cannot establish causality. But given the lack of visible
impacts from events, cumulative efficacy in communicating
the scientific consensus appears a plausible explanation for
gradually rising public acceptance of the reality of ACC.
Although public acceptance of ACC rose over the years
studied, it remains well below the level of agreement among
scientists. Public concern also has not translated into voting
behavior because parties have become social identities in the
United States. People's social commitment to keeping the
other party from power overcomes the mixture of views they
might hold on particular issues (Dunlap et al., 2016; Mason,
2015). Our findings give encouragement but no cause for
complacency among scientists engaged with the public; if
public engagement has had some success, it still has a long
way to go. And public opinion, unlike melting ice sheets, can
reverse course very quickly. Future surveys in this series will
continue monitoring, for good or bad news.

Climate questions on the Granite State Poll have been supported by
a grant from the National Science Foundation (New Hampshire
EPSCoR EPS-1101245), and by the Carsey School of Public Policy
and the Sustainability Institute at the University of New Hampshire.
Support for the POLES survey was provided by the PoLAR
Partnership grant from the National Science Foundation (DUE-
1239783), with additional help from the New Hampshire EPSCoR
Safe Beaches and Shellfish project (IIA-1330641). The NCERA
survey was supported by a grant from the Ford Foundation.
Notes
1. The Granite State Poll (GSP) employs trained and supervised
interviewers, calling randomly selected landline and cell telephone
numbers. Interviews last about 15 min and cover approximately 40
questions,includingwithoutemphasisafewaboutclimate.Response
rates over this period ranged from 16% to 32% by the American
Association for Public Opinion Research's (AAPOR; 2006) defini-
tion 4. Probability weights are calculated to allow minor adjustments
for design or sampling bias, and applied to all analyses in this article.
TheGSPfacesrealitytestingwitheachelection,andbecomesnation-
ally prominent every 4 years in the context of New Hampshire's
presidential primary (Moore & Smith, 2015). It has proven to be a
capable platform for basic research (e.g., Hamilton, 2012).
2. The GSP asks respondents to place themselves on a 9-point scale
from extremely liberal (1) to extremely conservative (9), with mod-
erate (leaning neither way) in the center (5). Detailed analysis finds
that in practice, some of these are not very different. For example,
the distinction between moderate, leaning a little more toward the
10 SAGE Open
conservative side (6 on the scale where 5 is simply moderate) and
somewhat conservative (7) does not seem to be sharp in many
people's minds, judging by the similar answers these two groups
give to other questions. We obtain more consistently interpretable
results using a simpler scheme with five categories: liberal (origi-
nally 9 or 8), moderately liberal (7 or 6), moderate (5), moderately
conservative (4 or 3), or conservative (2 or 1). People who say they
do not know or otherwise declined to answer the ideology question
(about 7% of the total) do not appear to form a coherent group, so
are set aside for analyses involving ideology.
3. Some studies employ much longer lists of predictors, but
these often reduce precision (raise standard errors and reduce
sample size) while showing inconsistent effects. In contrast,
the compact set of predictors used here has proven replicable
across dozens of independent data sets, often with agreement
not only on statistical significance but effect magnitudes (e.g.,
odds ratios) as well. For example, Hamilton et al. (2015) apply
this general regression framework to the climate question
asked in 35 separate surveys.
4. Michael Mann (2013) characterizes the politically focused
attacks on individual scientists (rather than large organiza-
tions or disciplines that hold similar views) as a "Serengeti
strategy," referencing the way African predators separate indi-
vidual prey animals from the herd.
5. Similar observations apply to the mirror-image group (about
the same size) who accept anthropogenic climate change
(ACC) but do not think most scientists agree (climate = 1 and
consensus = 0). They likewise tend to be younger, less edu-
cated, and more ideologically diverse than others who share
their acceptance of ACC.
