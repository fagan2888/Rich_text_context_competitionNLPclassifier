Introduction
Investors' decisions are based on the analysis of market
opportunities that meet their risk­return optimization crite-
ria. Considering this rational behavior of investors, founda-
tions for the mean­variance optimization framework and
portfolio diversification were laid in traditional finance the-
ory that gave birth to a trend marked by the development of
different risk management models, including Capital Asset
Pricing Model (CAPM), Fama-French, and Poster Stemberg
to facilitate investors' decision making and to explore alter-
natives such as mutual fund, real estate, and commodities.
Commodity investments greatly drew widespread attention
in periods of high financial markets' volatility during the
19th century by exhibiting their potential for portfolio diver-
sification and inflation protection. Later, commodity futures
contracts were introduced in 1922 when U.S. Congress
enacted the Grain FutureAct to regulate the pricing seasonal-
ity in commodity investments. There are several factors
which differentiate price variations in commodities from
stock investments such as state of economy, weather condi-
tions, government policies, and facilities of transportation
and storage. Commodity futures exchange of Pakistan which
was established on May 11, 2007, is currently at an infancy
stage with appreciable future growth prospects. Being a new
investment avenue, commodity's investments are perceived
to have equity such as returns, diversification, and inflation
hedging potential based on previous studies in developed
economies. There is a discernible distinction between the
dynamics of developed and developing economies (Elder &
Jin, 2007; Satyanarayan & Varangis, 1996).
Traditional investments have witnessed many periods of
financial turmoil, for example, global financial crisis of
2008, which motivated investors to take refuge in alternative
investments including commodities. Since the past one
decade, commodities have shown remarkable performance
making investors' preferences shift toward commodity's
investments. Commodities (metal, energy, and agriculture)
have long-standing history from consumption and invest-
ment perspective as a store of value or to mitigate the risk.
Commodities that fall in real assets'domain have unique tan-
gible features, intrinsic value (roll, convenience, and income
yield), and can be used in the production process. However,
real assets can be segregated into two broad categories: dura-
ble assets that are used in the wealth production process, for
example, transport vehicles; and non-durable assets that are

Commodities and Stock Investment: A
Multivariate Analysis
Syed Jawad Hussain Shahzad1, Naveed Raza1, and Aneese
Hayat Awan2
Abstract
This study is a multivariate analysis of commodities and stock investment in a newly established market scenario. Return
distribution asymmetry is examined with higher order movements. Skewness in commodity future's return is largely
insignificant, whereas kurtosis is highly significant for both stock and commodity future contracts. Correlation analysis is
done with Pearson's and Kendall's tau measures. Commodities provide significant diversification benefits when added in a
portfolio of stocks. Compared with stocks, commodity future's returns show stronger correlation with unexpected inflation.
The volatility is measured through Glosten-Jagannathan-Runkle - Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity
(GJR-GARCH) model and reflects that commodities have inverted asymmetric behavior, that is, more impact from the
upward shocks compared with downward. Stocks have asymmetric volatility, that is, more impact from negative shocks
compared with positive. Gold has highest inverted asymmetric volatility. Tail dependence, measured through Student's t
copula, shows no combined downside movement. In conclusion, commodity investments provide diversification and inflation
protection.

consumed in the wealth production process, for example,
fuel for transport vehicle. Commodity prices depend on
short-term supply and demand factors, for example, high
demand for wheat to fulfill current demand of bread.
Increasing prices of physical commodities are a source of
inflation and thus show correlation with inflation (Bodie,
1983; Elder & Jin, 2007; Gorton, Hayashi, & Rouwenhorst,
2013; Kat & Oomen, 2006). The price of production process
comprises wages of laborer, cost of capital and raw material.
For a given price of production process, if short-term cost of
labor is considered constant and cost of raw material
increases, the cost of capital must decrease. Similarly, if the
cost of capital increases, the cost of raw material must fall.
Thus, commodity prices and capital asset prices are nega-
tively correlated (Daskalaki & Skiadopoulos, 2011; Fuertes,
Miffre, & Rallis, 2010; Jacobs, Müller, & Weber, 2010).
However, the correlation between commodities and stocks is
time-dependent and highly volatile (Creti, Joëts, & Mignon,
2013; Silvennoinen & Thorp, 2013).
Event risk profile of commodities is different not only
from each other but also from stock and bonds. Financial
assets are claims on real assets or cash flows derived from
utilizing the real assets. Nature of these two asset classes
(stocks and commodities) is different and the way these are
affected by economic variables also varies across the catego-
ries (Fuertes et al., 2010). When the business cycle is at its
peak, commodity prices tend to be high, reflecting higher
demand for raw material. This booming business activity
causes interest rates to be high and expectations for growth
to slow down causing financial assets to perform poor.
Commodities are affected by short-term economic fluctua-
tions, whereas financial assets are affected by long-term
growth expectations. Stocks and commodities being exposed
to different factors and events also exhibit different return
distributions (Kat & Oomen, 2006). Both investments are
exposed to extreme shocks reflecting the outlier behavior in
the tail where there are more chances of returns falling close
to mean and also more chances for returns to be falling far
from the mean. Both stocks and commodity investments
have a non-linear pattern in returns distributions, which a
standard correlation cannot properly account for, especially,
when both these are tail-dependent. This tail dependence
(Delatte & Lopez, 2013) can have dangerous effects from the
portfolio perspective as there are chances that both these
investments move parallel creating losses (Börger, Cartea,
Kiesel, & Schindlmayr, 2009).
Owing to the complexities in risk­return profiles of stocks
and commodities highlighted in above discussion, this study
focuses on the asymmetric behavior of returns, strength of
relationships, asymmetric volatility and tail dependence of
stocks and commodities in a portfolio context. Rest of the
study is organized as follows. Section "Data and Method"
presents the data and methodological aspects. Section
"Results and Analysis" discusses result and analysis, and
Section "Conclusion" concludes the study.
Data and Method
Monthly price series of 25 stocks (source: http://www.kse.
com.pk/), 3 commodities (in Pakistani rupee [PKR] and U.S.
dollar) over a period of September 2004 to August 2012, and
10 commodity future contracts (source: http://www.pmex.
com.pk/) from December 2009 to August 2012 are used as a
sample for analysis. Details of secondary data with specifica-
tion are shown in Appendix A. Return1 is calculated as
r P P

With the premise that commodity prices often reflect high
upward spike, one may start feeling that commodity spot and
futures returns are positively skewed. However, stocks have
also reported spike behavior and investors. The following
three skewness (Kat & Oomen, 2006) measures are used in
this study:

If return distribution tails become fatter, there is more likeli-
hood of loss. Commodities are popular for having frequent
and aggressive price roller coaster, therefore they may have
high excess kurtosis (EK). EK reflects the probability of
intense outcome (Daskalaki & Skiadopoulos, 2011; Roache
& Rossi, 2009). Kurtosis I, II, and III (Kat & Oomen, 2006)
applied for the analysis are as under:

outliers, whereas Skew-II and Skew-III are more robust
(Kim & White, 2004). Skew-I is unbound, whereas Skew-II
and Skew-III are bounded between +1 and -1. Similar condi-
tion holds for kurtosis measures.
The association of commodities and stocks' returns with
each other and with unexpected inflation is measured with
Shehzad et al. 3
Pearson's (r) and Kendall's tau () measures. Later, non-
parametric measure is used keeping in view the asymmetric
nature of return distribution. Following are the equations for

Volatility analysis of commodities return is done using
minimum, maximum, 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles, annualized
standard deviation ( c ), ratio of commodity standard devia-
tion to 25 stocks ( RS ) and ratio of commodity standard
deviation to Index ( RI ).
The asymmetric volatility is a market phenomenon and
indicates dependence of volatility on up and down market
movements. This phenomenon may have been attributed by
the volatility feedback, effects of leverage, and psychologi-
cal attributes that are related with risk/return level in a par-
ticular market. It has been extensively examined and
confirmed; however, drivers of this phenomenon lack con-
sensus. The Generalized Autore-gressive Conditional
Heteroskedasticity (GJR-GARCH) model by Glosten et al.
(1993) is used to examine the asymmetric (different impact
of good and bad news) volatility of all sample returns. The
use of model is motivated by the notion that basic situation is
to be studied first before moving into complexities.
Asymmetry of volatility along with the above measures will
help frame a better picture for investment in commodity spot
and futures. The specification of the conditional variance

Results and Analysis
Skewness pattern for stocks and commodities requires spe-
cial attention when adding in the portfolio. If mean and vari-
ance of portfolio are constant, adding an investment
(commodity or stock) with positive skewness will shift
median return below the mean. This clustering of returns on
the negative side creates undesirable results for the investors
when market conditions are stable. Portfolio with positively
skewed return will underperform as compared with no or
negative skewness. Whereas when market conditions remain
volatile, returns of two portfolios will strike a balance.
Intuitively, skewness measures whether there is an increased
probability of a pleasant (positive skewness) or nasty (nega-
tive skewness) surprise. Of course, ceteris paribus, people
will prefer positive over negative skewness (Kat & Oomen,
2006). Detailed comparison of skewness and kurtosis mea-
sures over long and short time horizon is provided in Table 1.
Spot commodity's returns have significant negative skew-
ness. However, the skewness values are very low and range
between 0.68 and -1.35. After adjusting outliers, the spot
and future commodities returns are not skewed, consistent
with the results of the other two skewness measures. The
commodity future contracts show similar results where only
one gold contract (Gold Kilo) has high positive Skewness
III. Two gold contracts and a silver contract also have low
positive Skewness III. Commodity futures results are similar
to commodity spot. Given the frequent floods in Pakistan
(2007, 2010, and 2011) and resulting increase in agricultural
prices due to sharp supply cuts, one may expect high skew-
ness values. However, commodity exposure to positive
shocks does not generate positively skewed returns (Kat &
Oomen, 2006).
Stocks have the tendency to portray negative skew returns
(Bodie, 1983; Elder & Jin, 2007; Froot, 1995). Large cap
value stocks have positive skewness where Pakistan
Petroleum Ltd. (PPL) has the highest value. Large cap
growth stocks report negative skewness. Karachi Electric
Supply Corporation (KESC) has very high positive skew-
ness, which is consistent with the conclusion of Shefrin and
Statman (2000) and Miffre and Rallis (2006). All commodi-
ties-based firm stocks (indirect exposure) also show mar-
ginal positive skewness in both long and short time periods.
Kurtosis I, II, and III measures show that commodity
futures contracts and stocks have above normal kurtosis.
Commodity spot return's EK is comparable with commodity
futures. Gold future contracts seem more prone to severe
outcomes. Crude oil future contracts have more chances of
extreme events compared with spot oil returns. Stocks have
EK but within the range of 0.5 to 4. Commodity futures
results indicate higher EK compared with Karachi Stock
Exchange (KSE) Index returns in contrast with the results of
previous studies (Kat & Oomen, 2006) conducted in well-
developed futures markets. Higher sensitivity of commodity
4 SAGE Open
futures returns to extreme events, in comparison with stocks
and index, in a newly developed futures market indicates that
investment attributes depend on the state of market develop-
ment, storage infrastructure of commodities, and traders'
experience. EK of all stocks is comparable and maximum
EK touches the value of 4 over a long period of time. Indirect
commodity exposure also shows low EK values.
Commodity or stock investment may seem riskier from a
stand-alone perspective, but when added to portfolio, it is the
association which matters (Kat & Oomen, 2006). Results of
Pearson's correlation (see Table 2) between different com-
modities and stocks show weak correlation and even nega-
tive in few cases. In commodities, Gold spot shows
correlation with silver spot and futures. There is also a very
low correlation between crude oil, rice, and wheat.
Gold and crude oil futures indicate lowest correlation
when measured with Kendall's . Adding stocks to gold and
crude further reduces the portfolio's correlation.
Diversification benefits can be enhanced by adding small cap
value stocks in a portfolio. Stocks have low correlation with
commodity futures compared with commodity spot.
Commodities and stocks have low or negative association
over a longer period of time compared with short time hori-
zon. Commodity spot and futures contracts show no sign of
bondage or movement with KSE 100 index over both long
and short time periods. It is also a signal that index invest-

ment along with commodities can be a good source of port-
folio diversification.
Investment in commodities has the property to protect
investors from ravages of inflation. Stocks and bonds have
been criticized historically for purchasing power loss.
Comparing the data (see Table 3) for long and short time
periods reveals that stocks protect investor's purchasing
power over a longer period of time.
Stocks show no sign of inflation hedging for short period
of time. All large cap growth stocks have low significant
association with inflation over a longer period of time. For
short time period, no significant association is witnessed. All
stocks show similar results over a longer time period. Only
commodity-based firms (NML, ATRL, NFoods, RMPL)
have low significant association with inflation for both short
and long time periods. Both commodity spot and future
returns have high and significant association with unex-
pected inflation. Commodity futures have out surpassed both
commodity spot and stocks inflation hedging property.
Within group (metal class), gold has offered more inflation
hedging property compared with silver and within gold class,
TGold 100 and TGold 50 have strong association with infla-
tion. TGold 50 has the highest Kendall's  association within
and across commodity groups. Crude oil futures contract has
the highest Kendall's  association value of .838.Agricultural
commodity futures contracts also show medium-level asso-
ciation with inflation where Palmolien has more association
compared with rice futures contracts. It shows that agricul-
tural commodity future contracts have low inflation protec-
tion property. KSE 100 index and consumer price index
(CPI) show weak association. Gold and crude oil futures
have strongest Kendall's  correlation with inflation and neg-
ative association with stocks, which makes them strongest
candidate for portfolio diversification and inflation hedging.
According to the theory of storage (Kaldor, 1940), volatil-
ity of commodity prices is inversely related to inventory lev-
els. Infrequent price shocks can be balanced with the
adequate storage facilities. Storage requirements also differ
depending on the nature of commodities. For agricultural
commodities, weather conditions play a vital role in supply
variation. Floods (2007, 2010, and 2011) in Pakistan are of
particular attention in this setting. The volatility analysis of
commodity spots and futures is presented in Table 4. In com-
modity futures contracts, RICEIRRI-6, CRUIDE100, and
PALMOLEIN have the highest volatility ratios. Commodity
spots volatility ratio with index ( RI ) is between 1.36 and
2.96. Silver PKR spot has the highest volatility ratio ( RI )
with a value of 1.35. Gold PKR spot has the highest " RI "
value over a longer period of time. Crude oil spot has the
highest " RS " value of 1.04 over a long time period. Major
difference is observed in Gold spot where the ratios consid-
erably changed between shorter and longer time periods.
Results are in contrast with those of Kat and Oomen (2006).
The volatility of commodity prices is higher than stock and
index. For investment point of view, simply relying on diver-
sification parameters may not be enough as the things change
during crises.
Asymmetric volatility (last column) in GJR-GARCH
model is shown in Table 5. Negative coefficient values imply
that downward (negative) surprises demonstrate a lesser
force on the volatility than upward (positive) shocks. From
another perspective, upward shock of asset classes enhances
volatility of asset more than downward shocks. All stocks
show asymmetric volatility. Gold and other commodities
reflect inverted asymmetry. In the case of commodities, gold
has highest volatility (also evident through volatility analy-
sis) along with inverted asymmetry, implying that increase in
gold prices has more volatility impact than decrease in price.
Baur (2012) argues that this effect is related to the safe-
heaven property of gold. The higher gold prices may be con-
sidered as an indication of future adverse conditions and
uncertainty in other asset markets. This perceived uncer-
tainty by the investors results in higher volatility in gold mar-
kets. The inverted volatility effect of gold can lower the
aggregate risk of a portfolio for specific correlation levels
(Baur, 2012). Traditional use of gold as ornament in Pakistan
(inelastic demand) may have also contributed to higher
prices during uncertain markets. All commodity spot and
futures show similar results with varying magnitude of asym-
metric volatility.

Tail dependence is examined through Student's t copula
in this study. Tail dependence, from a risk management and
portfolio perspective, has captured increased attention of
investors and portfolio managers. It helps determine the joint
downside movement of two investments when downside risk
is concerned. It captures the true behavior, especially when
investment returns are not linearly related and their return
distributions are not normal. Student's t copula has a better
ability to capture the joint downside, keeping the flexibility
of center of the distribution. Commodity futures contracts
(gold, crude oil, and rice) have negative tail dependence with
each other, which shows no joint downside movement. Other
futures contracts show no sign of significant tail dependency,
good news from the investor's risk management perspective.
Commodity futures and stocks show no sign of tail depen-
dency for both short and long time periods. Results are in
contrast with those of Delatte and Lopez (2013). Comparing
commodity spot tail dependence pattern, there are cases
where tail dependence is witnessed over the long period.
Silver spot and Gold spot show significant tail dependence
but with low magnitude. Same is the case with silver and oil.
Stocks of different styles reflect significant tail dependency
when assessed within category. Large cap value and growth
stocks show significant and above medium tail dependency
with KSE 100 index, whereas small cap growth and value
stocks show below medium tail dependency with KSE 100.
Within large cap growth and value stocks, almost all stocks
reflect significant tail dependency with each other, while
across group tail dependency decreases for small cap and
commodity-based firm stocks. Graphs of selected Student's t
copula are provided in Appendix C.
Conclusion
In a multivariate analysis of stocks and commodities, the
results of this study indicate that stocks have marginally
positive skewness. Stocks'returns have significant and pos-
itive skewness over longer period of time but no or mar-
ginal negative skewness over a shorter time period. We may
conclude that stocks do not provide better results when
investment is made for a short time period. Commodity
spot and futures reflect little or no positive skewness after
accounting for outliers. Hence, the commodities are not
exposed to positive shocks. These results make commodity

high EK. Commodity futures EK is comparable with large
cap stocks. Indirect commodities' returns have low EK val-
ues and hence make them a strong candidate for risk-averse
investors.
The analysis also highlights that the risk­return relation
can be changed by adding commodities in a portfolio of
stocks. Commodities and stock investments show no associ-
ation with each other, indicating potential diversification
benefits. However, all the commodity futures do not offer
same diversification benefits, also highlighted by Faber
(2007) and Walton (1991). Commodities spot and futures
have strong protection against inflation, a property not found
in stocks investments. Gold and crude oil futures show high-
est diversification and inflation hedging benefits. These
results are in line with those of Bodie and Rosansky (1980),
Fortenbery and Hauser (1990), Faber (2007), Walton (1991),
Satyanarayan and Varangis (1996), Gorton et al. (2013).
Stocks have low significant correlation with inflation over a
longer period as compared with short time period, a bad sign
for investors expecting short-term inflation protection.
Gold has highest inverted asymmetry, while stocks
exhibit high asymmetric volatility. The inverted asymmet-
ric volatility of gold and other commodities along with
asymmetric volatility of stocks can benefit the investors by
reducing overall portfolio risk. The volatility impact is not
same for both commodities and stocks. Increased volatility
of commodities becomes good news for the investors pro-
tecting their wealth in period of uncertainty in financial
markets. In a portfolio of stocks and commodities, high
volatility of commodities complements the advantageous
negative correlation during economic turmoil. These find-
ings are consistent with Baur and Mcdermott (2010),
McCown and Zimmerman (2006), and Glosten et al.
(1993).
Both commodities and stocks show no sign of tail depen-
dency. Large cap value and growth stocks show significant
and above medium tail dependency with KSE 100 index,
whereas small cap growth and value stocks show below
medium tail dependency with KSE 100. This pattern is
appropriate as KSE 100 is capitalization value weighted
index and therefore large cap stocks have high impact on the
movement of the index than small cap stocks. Commodity
future contracts and stocks can be added to portfolio as both
these investments are not moving jointly on the downside.
The reported results are of Student's t copula, which may
vary if another copula function is applied. Our analysis finds
that investment in commodities can be a good diversifier for
stocks portfolio and it also protects the purchasing power of
investments. However, these findings are subject to change
over time.
