Abstract
Background. Elevationsinserum phosphorusare associated
with renal decline in animal models and progression of estab-
lished chronic kidney disease (CKD) in human observational
studies. We examined whether serum phosphorus levels in-
crease the risk of incident CKD or end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) in two population-based prospective cohort studies.
Methods. Overall, 2269 participants free of CKD [esti-
mated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/
1.732] from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS; mean
age 42 years; 53% women) and 13 372 participants from
the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III; mean age 44.3 years, 52% women) contrib-
uted to the present study. In the FHS, we evaluated the
relationship between baseline phosphorus category (<2.5
mg/dL, 2.5­3.49 mg/dL, 3.5­3.99 mg/dL and !4 mg/dL)
and incident CKD (n ¼ 267). In NHANES, we examined the
relationship between phosphorus below and above 4 mg/dL
in relation to incident ESRD (n ¼ 65).
Results. FHS participants in the highest phosphorus
category had an increased risk of CKD [odds ratio 2.14;
95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07­4.28; P ¼ 0.03] in
multivariable-adjusted models when compared to the refer-
ent group (2.5­3.49 mg/dL). Similarly, NHANES III par-
ticipants with phosphorus levels !4 mg/dL demonstrated
an increased risk of incident ESRD compared to those
<4 mg/dL (relative risk 1.90; 95% CI 1.03­3.53; P ¼ 0.04).
Conclusions. In prospective studies of the general popula-
tion, serum phosphorus levels in the upper-normal range
were associated with a doubling in the risk of developing
incident CKD and ESRD.

Introduction
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major worldwide health
problem associated with substantial morbidity, including
hypertension, metabolic abnormalities [1], anemia [2],
bone disease [3], cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke
[4], end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and death [5]. ESRD
carries substantial economic burden, with a cost of $24
billion per year in the USA, a figure that is increasing
annually [6]. Despite this, our understanding of the causes
of kidney disease is limited.
In animal models of CKD, serum phosphorus concentra-
tion is directly associated with renal structural changes and
functional decline [7]. In humans, hyperphosphatemia is as-
sociated with rapid progression of established CKD [8­10]
and the development of ESRD [8, 10]. Hyperphosphatemia
as observed in advanced kidney disease [11] or tumoral
calcinosis [12] is associated with accelerated vascular calci-
fication and the development of arteriosclerosis in humans.
In light of these observations, we sought to determine
whether serum phosphorus is associated with incident CKD
intheOffspringcohortoftheFraminghamHeartStudy(FHS).
In a complementary analysis, we further assessed whether
serum phosphorus is associated with incident ESRD in the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III), a nationally representative study in the USA.
Materials and methods
FHS sample
The design of the Framingham Offspring Study is detailed elsewhere [13].
For the present analysis, participants who had serum phosphorus measured

exam cycle (2005­08), were included. Overall, 2275 participants attended
both examinations and also had serum creatinine measured at baseline and
follow-up and 6 were excluded due to missing covariates, resulting in a
final study sample of 2269 for the analysis. The median follow-up was
25.1 years. All participants provided written informed consent, and the
institutional review board of the Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massa-
chusetts approved the study.
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
A full description of NHANES III is available elsewhere [14]. Briefly,
NHANES III was a national probability sample of US non-institutionalized
civilians conducted between 1988 and 1994. Analyses were restricted to
adults !18years of age whounderwenta baselinephysical examinationand
laboratory testing, had vital status information available at follow-up and
available linkage to Medicare and Medicaid files (n ¼ 13 372). The median
follow-up of participants included in the present analysis was 9.1 years.
NHANES III was approved by the institutional review board of the National
Center for Health Statistics and each participant signed an informed con-
sent. The institutional review board at the Albert Einstein College of Med-
icine determined the current NHANES analysis to be exempt.
Assessment of serum phosphorus level
Fasting serum phosphate levels were drawn at the baseline visit in FHS. In
NHANES, a random subset of approximately one-third of participants was
assigned to fast overnight prior to their study visit. The remaining approx-
imately two-thirds of the sample did not fast. In the FHS, serum pho-
sphorus was measured using a standard colorimetric method (Roche
Diagnostics, Alameda, CA), and the intra-assay coefficient of variation
was 5.6%. In NHANES III, serum phosphorus was measured using a
Hitachi model 737 multichannel analyzer (Boehringer Mannheim Diag-
nostics, Indianapolis, IN). The coefficient of variation was 1.8­2.8%.
Measurement of risk factors in FHS
In FHS, participants underwent examinations approximately every 4 years.
Each examination visit comprised a detailed medical history, physical ex-
amination including blood pressure (BP) measurements, anthropometry
and laboratory assessment of risk factors. Two BP measurements were
taken using a mercury sphygmomanometer after 5 min of rest, and the
average was used in the analyses. Hypertension was defined as systolic
BP ! 140 mm Hg, diastolic BP ! 90 mm Hg and/or use of antihypertensive
medications. Body mass index (BMI) was defined as weight in kilograms
divided by the square of height in meters. Persons who reported having
smoked cigarettes during the previous year were classified as current smok-
ers. Fasting levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and blood
glucose were measured using standardized assays. Diabetes mellitus was
defined as a fasting blood glucose level of 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher
or the use of insulin or any hypoglycemic agents. Proteinuria was assessed
using urine dipstick tests (Ames Labstix, Elkhardt, Indiana) dipped for 1
min in spot urine samples collected during the clinic visit [15]. Proteinuria
was defined as dipstick protein trace or above.
Prevalent CVD was defined as a history of one or more of the follow-
ing: non-fatal myocardial infarction, angina pectoris (stable or unstable),
stroke or transient ischemic attacks, peripheral vascular disease or con-
gestive heart failure. CVD events were adjudicated by a committee of three
experienced investigators.
Measurement of risk factors in NHANES III
In NHANES III, interview questions, physical examination and laboratory
values were assessed at baseline and processed per a standardized protocol
[14]. BP was measured six times following a standard protocol. Hyper-
tension, diabetes and BMI were defined as in FHS. Participants were
considered to have baseline CVD if they reported a history of heart failure,
stroke and myocardial infarction or had reported a surgical or percutaneous
intervention for any of the above. Participants who reported having
smoked !100 cigarettes during their lifetime were classified as current
smokers if they answered affirmatively to the question `Do you now
smoke cigarettes?' Low socioeconomic status was defined as 200% of
the poverty index. Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio was assessed using
a spot urine sample. Albumin-to-creatinine ratio and C-reactive protein
(CRP) were log-transformed to achieve normality for statistical analyses.
Assessment of eGFR and incident CKD outcome
In the FHS, the primary outcome studied was the development of incident
CKD, defined as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.732 using the Modification of Diet
in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation [16], by the eighth examination cycle
(2005­08). This definition of incident CKD is consistent with our prior
work in this area [17]. It has been widely used in prior epidemiological
studies, has relatively good agreement with other definitions of incident
CKD and demonstrates relatively consistent risk factor associations
[18]. Serum creatinine levels were measured using the modified
Jaffe
´ method. In NHANES III, ESRD incidence was defined as initiat-
ing chronic dialysis. ESRD cases through 1 July 2001 were identified
through linkage of the NHANES III database with Medicare files. Spe-
cifically, the ESRD Patient Master File and Death Notification (Form
2746) was used to identify participants initiating chronic dialysis ther-
apy following their NHANES III study visit. In both studies, calibration
of serum creatinine values to the Cleveland Clinic Laboratory standard
was performed using the correction factor of 0.23 mg/dL (20.33 lmol/
L) [19].
Statistical analyses
Framingham Heart Study. Baseline characteristics of study participants
were calculated by phosphorus category and the statistical significance of
differences compared using v2 tests for categorical and one-way analysis
of variance for continuous variables. Correlation between serum phospho-
rus values and CKD risk factors were evaluated using Pearson's correla-
tion test. Baseline phosphorus was considered both in categories (<2.5
mg/dL, 2.5­3.49 mg/dL, 3.5­3.99 mg/dL and !4 mg/dL) and as a con-
tinuous variable (per 1 mg/dL higher phosphorus level). The association
between phosphorus category and risk of CKD was tested using logistic
regression models. Two sets of regression models were constructed: (i)
adjusting for age, sex and eGFR, (ii) a multivariable model adjusting for
age, sex, eGFR, BMI, diabetes mellitus, systolic BP, treatment for hyper-
tension, smoking and HDL cholesterol. In these regression models, the
reference category for the phosphorus levels was 2.5­3.49 mg/dL, which
contained the highest number of individuals. A linear trend in odds ratios
(ORs) was calculated across categories.
As serum phosphorus is associated with CVD risk and cardiovascular
mortality [20, 21], and because CKD and CVD may be causally linked
[22], we performed a sensitivity analysis. Specifically, we repeated the
logistic regression analyses after excluding individuals with prevalent
CVD in a secondary analysis. We performed two additional sensitivity
analyses, adjusting for serum calcium and dipstick proteinuria.
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. As in FHS,
baseline phosphorus was considered as both a categorical and continuous
variable in NHANES III. However, there were insufficient ESRD cases in
NHANES III (n ¼ 65) to perform an analysis using four baseline phos-
phorus categories. As the risk for kidney disease appeared to increase in
participants with serum phosphorus !4 mg/dL in FHS, we categorized
NHANES III participants as having serum phosphorus !4 mg/dL or <4
mg/dL in the categorical analyses. In sensitivity analyses, we also eval-
uated levels above and below 3.5 mg/dL and 4.5 mg/dL, separately. Base-
line characteristics of the study participants were calculated by phosphorus
level (<4 mg/dL and !4 mg/dL). Poisson regression models were used to
calculate the relative risk (RR) for incident ESRD associated with serum
phosphorus. Follow-up time for each individual was calculated as the
number of days between their baseline visit and the incidence of ESRD,
death or 31 December 2000, whichever occurred first. Due to the small
number of events, statistical adjustment was made using propensity score
analysis. The propensity for having phosphorus levels !4 mg/dL was
determined using a logistic regression model with age, sex, race/ethnicity,
hypertension, history of CVD, diabetes mellitus, BMI, HDL cholesterol,
use of cholesterol-lowering medications, CKD, serum albumin, log uri-
nary albumin-creatinine ratio, log CRP and low socio-economic status as
the covariable vector. In addition, serum phosphorus was also modeled as
a continuous variable. As in the FHS analysis, secondary analyses were
conducted for participants without CVD at baseline.
Analyses of FHS were performed using SAS, version 9.1 (SAS Insti-
tute, Cary, NC). NHANES analyses were performed using Stata version 10
(Stata Corp., College Station, TX), accounting for its complex survey
design. Also, to account for the over-sampling of subgroups and partic-
ipant non-response, all NHANES III analyses incorporated sampling
weights. A two-tailed P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Role of the funding source. FHS is funded by the National Heart, Lung
and Blood Institute (N01-HC-25195). The funding sources had no role in
the design, conduct or reporting of the study or in the decision to submit
the report for publication. NHANES III and Medicare linkage data was
performed and made publicly available by the National Center for Health

Statistics (NCHS). The NCHS had no role in the design, conduct, reporting
or the decision to submit for publication.
Results
Cross-sectional correlates of serum phosphorus level in
FHS
The demographic characteristics of the FHS participants
are shown in Table 1. The mean age was 42 years and
53.2% were women. Serum phosphorus levels were
higher in women (P < 0.0001) and current smokers (P
< 0.001) and those with a lower BMI (P ¼ 0.04). A
negative correlation was observed between phosphorus
levels and BMI, systolic BP, serum glucose and HDL
cholesterol, whereas a direct correlation with eGFR was
observed (r ¼ 0.06, P ¼ 0.002).
Association between serum phosphorus level and
incident CKD in FHS
Incident CKD developed in 267 FHS participants (11.7%)
during follow-up. Participants in the highest phosphorus
category (!4 mg/dL) demonstrated an increased risk of
incident CKD compared to the referent group in age, sex
and eGFR-adjusted analyses (OR for CKD 2.15, 95% con-
fidence interval (CI) 1.10­4.22, P ¼ 0.026, Table 2).
Results were not materially different after multivariable
adjustment for CKD risk factors (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.07­
4.28, P ¼ 0.03). Additional adjustment for dipstick protei-
nuria and serum calcium resulted in minimal attenuation of
CKD risk [OR 2.06 (95% CI 1.01­4.20, P ¼ 0.047)] and
2.06 (95% CI, 1.01­4.18, P ¼ 0.046).
No significant association with incident CKD was ob-
served when serum phosphorus was analyzed as a contin-
uous variable in either age-, sex- or eGFR-adjusted (OR per
1 mg/dL increase in serum phosphorus 1.0, 95% CI 0.97­
1.04; P ¼ 0.9) or multivariable-adjusted analyses (OR 1.0;
95% CI, 0.97­1.04; P ¼ 0.64).
Secondary analyses in FHS
The association of serum phosphorus levels with increased
risk of CKD was similar when analyses were repeated ex-
cluding participants with prevalent CVD (multivariable-
adjusted OR 2.03; 95% CI, 0.98­4.21, P ¼ 0.058).
Cross-sectional correlates of serum phosphorus level in
NHANES III
The baseline characteristics of the participants in NHANES
III are presented by serum phosphorus in Table 3. Partici-
pants in NHANES III with serum phosphorus levels !4mg/
dL were more likely to be female, Mexican-American, have
baseline CKD, use cholesterol-lowering medication, have a
lower serum hemoglobin and a higher serum calcium and
HDL cholesterol compared to participants with serum
phosphorus levels <4mg/dL.
Associations between serum phosphorus level and
incident ESRD in NHANES III
During a median of 9.1 years (interquartile range 7.6­10.7),
65 NHANES III participants developed ESRD. Similar to
the observations with incident CKD in Framingham, par-
ticipants with baseline phosphorus ! 4 mg/dL had an in-
creased risk of ESRD in both age, sex and race/ethnicity
adjusted (RR 2.41; 95% CI 1.29­4.50; P ¼ 0.007) and
multivariable-adjusted analyses (RR 1.90; 95% CI 1.03­
3.53; P ¼ 0.04; Table 4) compared to those with baseline
phosphorus < 4mg/dL. When serum phosphorus was ana-
lyzed as a continuous variable, an increased risk for ESRD
was observed (multivariable-adjusted models RR 2.01;
95% CI 1.32­3.07; P ¼ 0.002).

The multivariable-adjusted RR of ESRD was 5.41 (95% CI
1.60­18.4; P ¼ 0.008) in NHANES III participants
with serum phosphorus !4.5 mg/dL compared with those
<4.5 mg/dL. Additionally, the multivariable-adjusted RR
of ESRD associated with serum phosphorus !3.5 mg/dL
was 3.27 (95% CI 1.43­7.50; P ¼ 0.006) compared with
participants with serum phosphorus of <3.5 mg/dL.
When participants with prevalent CVD were excluded
from multivariable analysis, the RR for incident ESRD was
attenuated in NHANES III participants with serum phos-
phorus !4.0 mg/dL compared with those <4.0 mg/dL (RR
1.52; 95% CI 0.55­4.22; P ¼ 0.41). The multivariable-
adjusted RR was 2.01 per 1 mg/dL increase in serum phos-
phorus (95% CI, 1.32­3.07; P ¼ 0.002) after excluding
NHANES III participants with prevalent CVD.
Discussion
Our data suggest an association between serum phosphorus
levels in the `high-normal' range and an increased risk for
incident CKD. We were able to extend our findings and
additionally document an association between serum phos-
phorus and ESRD in the nationally representative
NHANES III study.
Hyperphosphatemia is a common complication of estab-
lished CKD and the relationship between phosphorus and
progression of kidney disease has been characterized in this
context [23]. Several studies report elevated serum phos-
phorus levels as predictive of the rapid progression of kid-
ney disease [8­10] and the development of ESRD [10]. The
present study extends the current literature by demonstrat-
ing an independent association between phosphorus level
and both incident CKD and ESRD.
There are several potential mechanisms that may explain
our observations. First, baseline eGFR was substantially
increased in the highest phosphorus group in FHS, repli-
cating a relationship observed in an earlier analysis of the
Cholesterol and Recurrent Events study [21]. A confounder
likely mediates this association, as neither phosphorus ad-
ministration nor serum phosphorus concentration has a di-
rect effect on GFR [24, 25]. Diet is one such potential
confounder, as serum phosphorus concentration correlates
directly with dietary phosphate intake in humans [26]. A
high-protein diet induces renal hyperfiltration in animal
models, [27] patients with CKD [28] and in healthy volun-
teers [28], and may accelerate renal functional decline in

individuals with mild renal insufficiency via this mecha-
nism [29]. Conversely, dietary protein restriction attenuates
hyperfiltration in animal models of kidney disease [30­36]
and delays the progression of established kidney disease in
humans [37­39]. Processed foods high in phosphorus-
based food additives [40] are associated with elevated
phosphate intake and serum concentrations in CKD pa-
tients [41], and increasing poverty is also independently
associated with increased serum phosphate, possibly medi-
ated by a diet rich in such processed foods [42].
Secondly, the association between serum phosphorus
and risk of CKD may be explained by renal calcific arterial
disease. Serum phosphorus is associated with CVD risk in
the general population [20] and in those with known CVD
[21]. Evidence suggests that this risk is mediated by phos-
phorus-induced arteriosclerosis and vascular calcification
[43], and hyperphosphatemia may directly stimulate arte-
rial calcification via upregulation of core binding factor a-1
in vascular smooth muscle cells [44].
Finally, it is possible that a higher prevalence of subclin-
ical renal disease existed in the highest phosphate group
than is indicated by the MDRD eGFR equation. It has
been suggested that as MDRD was originally developed
in disease-based cohorts, it may perform poorly in healthy
populations [45]. Misclassification of mild CKD could po-
tentially explain both high phosphorus concentration and
the higher risk of CKD/ESRD. However, as the MDRD
equation generally overestimates the prevalence of CKD
in a general population sample [46], any effect due to mis-
classification is likely to be small.
Notably, when analyzed as a continuous variable, serum
phosphorus was associated with an increased risk of ESRD
but not incident CKD. This may be due to differences in the
composition of the two study samples, such as the inclusion
of participants with baseline CKD in the NHANES III anal-
ysis or differences in the ethnic composition of the samples,
which is known to influence phosphorus level [47].
The finding that serum phosphorus in the upper range of
normal is associated with incident kidney disease may have
important public health implications. As serum phosphorus
levels !4.0 mg/dL, but within the normal range, are asso-
ciated with both incident CKD and CVD [20, 21], the
currently accepted upper limit of the `normal range' of
4.5 mg/dL may require revision downwards.
There are several strengths to this study, including the
well-characterized participants from FHS and NHANES
III, the well-defined CVD risk factors and the long duration
of follow-up. By making use of data from two distinct
studies, we were able to extend our observations from in-
cident CKD to ESRD. Also, there are some important lim-
itations. Dietary information was not available for
participants in this FHS exam cycle, and we cannot exclude
its importance as a confounder. A time-to-event analysis
would have been preferable in FHS, as was performed in
NHANES III, but was not possible due to the cyclical
nature of follow-up in that study and consequent inability
to time CKD onset. The FHS sample was predominantly of
European ancestry, which may limit the generalizability
of these findings. However, we note that NHANES III is
a multi-ethnic nationally representative sample that pro-
duced comparable results. We used slightly different ana-
lytic strategies in FHS as compared to NHANES because
of low numbers of ESRD cases in NHANES and the lack
of laboratory follow-up. We did not adjust for other un-
measured potential confounders of the associations seen
including FGF-23, parathyroid hormone levels and uri-
nary biomarkers. Also, laboratory follow-up for identify-
ing incident cases of CKD was not available in NHANES
III. As both studies have an observational design, causality
cannot be inferred. Finally, a survival bias may have ex-
isted in our analysis, as participants were required to attend
both the initial and follow-up examinations, and those
with the greatest risk factor burden may have died during
the long follow-up.
In conclusion, serum phosphorus levels in the high-
normal range are associated with a 2-fold higher risk of
developing new-onset CKD and ESRD in the general
population. Further research is required to investigate the
causes of this association between phosphorus homeostasis
and an increased risk of developing renal disease.
