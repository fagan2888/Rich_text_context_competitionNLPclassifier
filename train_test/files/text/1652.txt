The health consequences of obesity and overweight have been well documented, but less research has exam-
ined their social and economic consequences. This paper examines the long-term consequences of early adult
overweight for midlife health and socioeconomic attainment using prospective nationally representative panel data
from American adults in the Monitoring the Future Study (1986­2008). Growth mixture models identified 2 distinct
latent classes of trajectories of body mass index (BMI) from age 19 to 35 years: a persistently overweight class
(BMI >25 kg/m2) and a second class exhibiting more moderate growth in BMI to age 35 years. Women (odds ratio
(OR) ¼ 2.16, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.39, 3.36) and those from a lower childhood socioeconomic position
(OR ¼ 1.71, 95% CI: 1.30, 2.24) were more likely to be in the persistently overweight class. Compared with those in
the moderately increasing BMI class, those in the persistently overweight class were more likely to have a chronic
health problem at age 40 years (OR ¼ 2.74, 95% CI: 2.20, 3.43), to have no further education beyond high school
(OR ¼ 1.33, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.69), and to have a higher odds of receiving welfare or unemployment compensation at
age 40 years (OR ¼ 1.76, 95% CI: 1.49, 2.04). These findings highlight the importance of addressing persistent
obesity and overweight early in the life course.

The prevalence of obesity has been increasing (1­6), with
well-documented health consequences (7, 8). Obesity has
repeatedly been associated with increased risk for cardiovas-
cular disease, diabetes, cancer, and physical disability (9­
12), with adverse effects of lifetime cumulative obesity for
subsequent mobility limitations (13), mortality (14­16), and
the onset of physical impairment up to 50 years later (17).
A parallel but smaller body of work has examined the
social and economic consequences of early life obesity
and overweight. Obesity is associated with lower self-
esteem in adolescent girls (7, 18) and with persistent dele-
terious effects on self-esteem (19), as well as lower wages
(20), into adulthood. American women who were obese in
adolescence were found to have lower levels of social
achievement in early adulthood (fewer years of advanced
education, lower rates of marriage, higher rates of poverty)
than women whowere not obese at the same ages (21). Similar
findings were found using data from the British Cohort Study,
where persistent obesity in women between the ages of 10 and
30 years was associated with never having been gainfully
employed and not having a current partner (22). However,
obesity limited only to childhood showed no persistent socio-
economic effects into adulthood (22).
From a life course perspective (23, 24), the long-term
health and socioeconomic consequences of early life over-
weight and obesity may unfold through processes of cumu-
lative disadvantage (25­30). Evidence from clinical and
population studies suggests that early life socioeconomic
disadvantage beginning in utero leads to low birth weight
and rapid growth during infancy, which increases the risk for
childhood as well as adult obesity, along with the subse-
quent risk for adult chronic diseases (31­37). In turn, health

problems decrease socioeconomic reserves to manage and
cope with existing conditions, resulting in the progression of
health problems and reinforcement of socioeconomic disad-
vantage throughout the life course.
Yet, most of the literature on the long-term implications
of overweight and obesity is not based on prospective lon-
gitudinal data with repeated measures to permit a full ex-
amination of this process of cumulative disadvantage over
the life course. Typically, researchers use 2 data points to
relate early life weight with later life health and mortality
(e.g., Viner and Cole (22)). As a result, the full scope of
variability within 2 discrete data points is ignored. More-
over, it is unclear from these studies whether it is simply
early life obesity or persistent obesity across adulthood
that has consequences for later health and socioeconomic
attainment--issues that cannot be differentiated with only
2 data points.
This paper uses repeated measures of weight gathered
prospectively from age 19 to 40 years to capture the full
course of weight change across the transition from young
adulthood to midlife. We hypothesize that there may be
distinct patterns of weight gain over adulthood with differ-
ent consequences for midlife health and socioeconomic
attainment. We bring together the literatures in life course
epidemiology with those in obesity research using nation-
ally representative prospective data on American young
adults and their transition to mid-adulthood over a 22-year
period.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
Data were drawn from the Monitoring the Future project,
a nationwide school-based survey of substance use and re-
lated attitudes and beliefs conducted annually in the United
States since 1975 (38). The survey also includes self-reported
measures of respondents' weight and height collected since
1986. Monitoring the Future is a cohort sequential study
(described in more detail elsewhere (39)) involving a nation-
ally representative sample of high school seniors surveyed in
the spring of each year (approximately 15,000 per year).
Each year's data collection takes place in about 135 public
and private high schools selected to provide an accurate
representative cross section of 12th graders throughout the
coterminous United States.
A representative subsample (~2,400 students/year) is ran-
domly selected from each cohort for 7 biennial follow-ups
to the age of 32 years, and then at age 35 years and every
5 years thereafter, using self-completed mailed question-
naires. Drug users were oversampled for participation in
the panel component by a factor of 3.0 and then reweighted
in the analyses, as discussed below. To ease respondent
burden, panel respondents are randomly assigned to receive
1 of 5 different questionnaires, each with its own set of
questions. Since 1986, a random one-fifth of respondents
(approximately 480 students per class) received the ques-
tionnaire asking about height and weight. For our purposes
we focus on subjects in 11 high school cohorts entering the
study between 1976 and 1986 (inclusive), yielding 5,233
individuals who were between the ages of 19 and 40 years
over this 22-year period. Repeat measures of height and
weight are modeled from 1986 forward to 2008 or age
40 years, whichever comes first. There were no exclusion
criteria. All study procedures are reviewed and approved on
an annual basis by the University of Michigan's Institutional
Review Board for compliance with federal guidelines for
the treatment of human subjects.
Measures
Weight gain over adulthood was captured with measure-
ment of body mass index (BMI; kg/m2). A BMI score of 25­
29 is used to define ``overweight,'' while a BMI score of 30
or above represents ``obese'' (40). Three variables capture
key indicators of early social position found to be related to
lifetime obesity as well as to midlife health and socioeco-
nomic attainment: 1) gender; 2) race/ethnicity (self-reported
by respondents and modeled using 3 dummy variables con-
trasting black, Hispanic, and other race/ethnic (including
Asian) respondents with non-Hispanic white respondents);
and 3) childhood socioeconomic status (SES) (the maxi-
mum of the respondent's parents' education, dichotomized
as high school degree or less vs. college degree or higher).
Region of residence in senior year of high school (South,
North Central, Northeast, and West) captures elements of
the surrounding socioeconomic and environmental context
that may be related to BMI trajectories over and above in-
dividual socioeconomic and sociodemographic risk (41).
We also adjust for high school academic performance cap-
tured through an ordinal 9-category measure of average
grade in high school (modeled using the midpoint value of
each category).
Five measures capture health and social position at age 40
years. The presence of any chronic health problem is cap-
tured with a dummy variable to indicate any 1 of 6 medi-
cally diagnosed chronic health conditions reported by the
respondent at age 40 years (hypertension, diabetes, asthma,
chronic lung disease (including chronic bronchitis or em-
physema), heart disease, and cancer). Four dummy variables
capture social and economic hardship at age 40 years: was
on welfare or received unemployment compensation in the
previous year; home ownership; no current partner; and
those who, by age 40 years, had not received any further
education beyond high school.
Statistical analyses
We used generalized growth mixture modeling to identify
latent classes of individuals according to their long-term
patterns of BMI growth and then examined the relation
between trajectory classes and midlife health and social
outcomes at age 40 years. Growth mixture modeling is an
extension of conventional growth modeling that relaxes the
assumption of a single population trajectory. By using latent
trajectory classes (categorical latent variables), the growth
mixture model allows different classes of individuals to vary
around different mean growth curves (42, 43). The trajec-
tory of interest in this paper is weight gain (captured with
BMI), measured prospectively from young adulthood (age
Midlife Consequences of Persistent Overweight 541
Am J Epidemiol 2010;172:540­548
19 years) to age 35 years, as it relates to midlife health and
social outcomes at age 40 years.
The structural part of the model incorporates the growth
model within a larger latent variable model by relating the
growth factors to other observed and latent variables. Of
particular interest is the latent trajectory class variable,
which represents the unobserved subpopulation of member-
ship for respondents. Early life sociodemographic covari-
ates predict class membership in a multinomial logistic
regression. As a general extension of the growth mixture
model, we include distal outcomes, health, and socioeco-
nomic attainment at age 40 years, which are predicted from
the growth model controlling for early life sociodemo-
graphic covariates (43).
Model building proceeded in a sequential process by
first specifying the measurement model and then incremen-
tally increasing the number of latent classes. Good-fitting
models are characterized by 1) a low value for the Bayes-
ian Information Criterion and Akaike Information Crite-
rion; 2) a statistically significant Lo-Mendell-Rubin
likelihood ratio test; 3) distinct posterior probabilities for
individual class membership; and 4) differences in the
mean outcome variable across classes (42, 43). All models
are estimated in Mplus version 5.2 (44) using full informa-
tion maximum likelihood with robust standard errors. Mul-
tiple random starts are used to minimize local optimal in
the likelihood. Respondent-level weights are used to adjust
for unequal selection probabilities in the panel study.
Retention rates in the panel respondents are highest in the
first follow-up after high school (averaging 70%) and fall to
an average of 64% in the biennial follow-ups through to age
32 years. Longer-term retention rates (at ages 35­40 years)
are about 52% (38). Using logistic regression analysis (with
backward elimination), we modeled the probability of study
retention to age 40 years according to a broad array of
baseline characteristics and found that white race and re-
porting of a higher average grade in high school increased
the odds of retention. By including these variables in our
models, maximum likelihood produces unbiased coeffi-
cients under the assumption that the attrition process is con-
ditional on observed variables in our models (45­47).
RESULTS
Sociodemographic characteristics at senior year for the
study sample are presented in Table 1. On average, respon-
dents had a normal weight in the year following high school
(BMI ¼ 22.6; standard deviation, 3.0; Table 1), but these
cohorts of American adults gained weight steadily over adult-
hood, reporting an average BMI of 27.0 (standard deviation,
4.4) by age 40 years. Consistent with other national surveys
(e.g., the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
1999­2000), hypertension was diagnosed in almost one-fifth
of the study sample by midlife, and roughly one-third had any
1 of 6 chronic health problems. A minority of respondents
were receiving welfare or unemployment compensation at the
age of 40 years, and just under half had no further education
beyond high school.
Table 2 reports the fit statistics for a progression of growth
mixture models. The first row (model A) pertains to the
linear single-class model. Average BMI at age 19 years is
22.4 (intercept) and increases by 0.23 points each year
(slope, P < 0.001) until age 35 years. (The distribution of
BMI at each time point is roughly normal, justifying the
linear model.) The fit of the model improves by allowing
for correlated error between BMI measures at adjacent time
points (model B) (all 7 correlations are statistically significant
at P < 0.0001).
The third row of Table 2 (model C) reports the fit statistics
for the 2-class solution. The change in the Bayesian Infor-
mation Criterion and Akaike Information Criterion values,
coupled with a significant Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ra-
tio test (P < 0.001), suggests that a 2-class solution is pref-
erable to a single-class model. Membership in each class
showed good classification quality, with individuals most
likely to belong to their predicted class (posterior probabil-
ity is markedly higher (>0.90) than for the other class).
Adding a third class (model not shown) did not result in
any improvement in model fit, and the posterior probabili-
ties did not differentiate class membership well.
Figure 1 shows the estimated growth curves for BMI from
age 19 to 35 years according to the 2-class solution (ob-
served mean BMI scores are also plotted for each class).
The 2 curves represent 2 distinct trajectories of BMI growth
from early adulthood: Class 1 (with 80.9% of the sample)
represents the majority of the sample, which we term the
``normative class,'' with an average BMI of 21.4 following
high school and a steady rate of growth in BMI up to age
35 years (slope ¼ 0.18, P < 0.001). Conversely, individuals
in class 2 (19.1% of the sample) were on average overweight
at high school graduation (mean BMI ¼ 25.7) and gained
weight more rapidly throughout the next 15 years
(slope ¼ 0.30, P < 0.001), whom we term the ``persistently
overweight class.'' The model supports a class-varying fac-
tor covariance matrix, where the growth factor variances are
allowed to differ across classes. Results indicate greater
variance around the intercept and slope for the persistently
overweight class (r2 ¼ 23.41 and 0.102, respectively) com-
pared with the normative class (r2 ¼ 3.64 and 0.004,
respectively).
Model D in Table 2 adds the covariates to the model,
regressing gender, race/ethnicity, childhood SES, region,
and academic performance on class membership. The model
also specifies class-specific effects of the covariates on the
growth factors. For ease of model interpretation, average
grade in high school is centered at the mean. The fit of the
model improves significantly, and the results provide insight
into the underlying reasons for the different trajectory pat-
terns. Table 3 reports the results from the logistic regression
for class membership (adjusted odds ratios and 95% confi-
dence intervals using the normative latent class as the ref-
erence class. Compared with individuals in the normative
class, individuals in the persistently overweight class are
more likely to be female and to come from a lower socio-
economic background. (See also descriptive statistics by
latent class, Table 1.) The odds of membership in the per-
sistently overweight class are significantly reduced among
those with a higher average grade in high school (controlling
for childhood SES and other covariates). There was no
significant association between race/ethnicity and class

position.
The within-class influence of the covariates on the growth
factors varies significantly across class. Table 4 presents the
unstandardized regression coefficients (with standard errors)
for the effects of the covariates on BMI intercept and slope
for each of the 2 latent classes. Within the persistently over-
weight class, the rate of growth in BMI is more rapid for
women (although their initial status at age 19 years is some-
what lower on average than that of men). On the other hand,
the rate of growth in the persistently overweight class is
significantly attenuated among those residing in the North
Central and South regions of the United States. Within the
normative class, Hispanics have a much faster rate of growth
in BMI than whites, all other factors held constant.
The next step in the modeling process adds the distal out-
comes at age 40 years. In these models, membership in a par-
ticular latent trajectory class between ages 19 and 35 years
predicts health and SES at age 40 years, controlling for early
life sociodemographic factors. Table 5 presents the odds ratios
for these midlife outcomes using the normative class as the
reference class. Relative to those who leave high school with
a normalBMIand gainweightgraduallyoveradulthood,those
who are persistently overweight have odds of reporting any
medically diagnosed chronic health condition at age 40 years
that are over 3-fold higher (odds ratio (OR) ¼ 3.33, adjusted
for baseline covariates). Part of this effect appears to operate
through mediating processes that may lie on the causal path-
way, including financial hardship (being on welfare or collect-
ing unemployment compensation), a lack of further education
beyond high school, and lack of a current partner (adjusted
OR ¼ 2.74), but there remains a net direct effect of persistent
overweight on the risk for chronic health problems at age 40
years. There is also a net effect of persistent overweight on the
absence of higher education (adjusted OR ¼ 1.33, P < 0.05),
which remains after adjusting for potential confounders and
mediators.
When adjusted for baseline sociodemographic characteris-
tics, the odds of reporting socioeconomic hardship at age 40
years in the form of receiving welfare or unemployment
compensation are over 50% greater for those who remain
persistently overweight compared with those in the normative
class (OR ¼ 1.76). However, most of this effect operates
through intervening statuses, including the onset of health
problems and the lack of further education and a current
partner (adjusted OR ¼ 1.36). Thus, it is the elevated risk
for socioeconomic hardship and health problems associated
with persistent overweight that increases the risk for receiv-
ing welfare or unemployment compensation at age 40 years,
not the history of persistent overweight per se. Similarly,
some of the effect of persistent overweight on having no
current partner in midlife operates through intervening mech-
anisms such as health problems and socioeconomic hardship.
However, there remains a moderate (marginally statistically
significant) net effect of persistent overweight on having no

DISCUSSION
This paper considers the long-term consequences of
young adult weight gain for health and socioeconomic at-
tainment in midlife. We found 2 distinct patterns of BMI
growth over early adulthood (ages 19­35 years) in a national
sample of Americans followed over a 22-year period. One
pattern is slow, steady growth following a normal BMI in
high school. The other represents people who started out
with a high BMI in high school (BMI >25) and remained
persistently overweight throughout early adulthood. We
found notable health and socioeconomic consequences of
being in the persistently overweight class. Those who were
persistently overweight were more likely to have a medi-
cally diagnosed chronic health problem at age 40 years.
These include nontrivial medical conditions surfacing at
a relatively young age. Compared with those experiencing
more gradual weight gain, the persistently overweight
were also more likely to have pursued no further education

Midlife Consequences of Persistent Overweight 545

beyond high school and to have no current partner. Persis-
tent overweight was also associated with higher odds of
receiving welfare or unemployment compensation at age
40 years, which was found to operate partly through health
and socioeconomic pathways.
Early life disadvantage is a critical factor in membership
in these 2 trajectories. Persons from low SESs were more
likely to be in the persistently overweight class, controlling
for gender, race/ethnicity, and geographic region of the
United States. As early life socioeconomic disadvantage in-
creases exposure to risk and as socioeconomic advantage
increases exposure to opportunity (29), the ``Matthew ef-
fect'' comes into play (48). Referring to the Gospel of
St. Matthew--``For unto every one that hath shall be given
and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall
be taken away even that which he hath''--the Matthew ef-
fect describes how those in advantaged social circumstances
are better able to reinforce their position by accruing better
jobs and income and more education and health benefits over
the course of their lives, thereby reducing their exposure to
risk factors and lifestyles that typically compromise health.
Conversely, those with fewer resources are at increased risk
for health and socioeconomic decline as exposure to disad-
vantage multiplies over the life course in the form of cumu-
lative inequality that reinforces their position of social and
economic disadvantage (27, 29, 30).
However, we also found that the odds of membership in
the persistently overweight class were significantly reduced
among those with a higher average grade in high school
(controlling for childhood SES), suggesting that individual
resources and other collective social capital operating in the
school setting can attenuate the risk for obesity and over-
weight even among those from a lower SES. These findings
suggest that strategies aimed at supporting socially disad-
vantaged youth in the school context may hold promise for
altering their trajectory of weight gain and subsequent
health and socioeconomic challenges. Consistent with find-
ings that suggest that reducing educational disengagement
and increasing academic performance can contribute to less
cigarette and other drug use (49), our results here suggest
that academic performance in high school, to the extent that
it can be fostered and promoted in socially disadvantaged
youth, has the potential to alter the trajectory of adult weight
gain and subsequent midlife outcomes.
Regarding limitations, we cannot be certain of the causal
associations assumed in these analyses, although the use of
longitudinal data identifies the temporal sequence consistent
with the assumed casual sequence. Ideally we would have
liked to include a control for early life health status, but such
a measure is not available in these data. However, we endeav-
ored to account for early life health and social risk by in-
cluding measures of childhood SES and race/ethnicity, which
are highly correlated with early life health status (50, 51).
Another limitation includes nonrandom attrition in the panel
data, but this was to some degree statistically adjusted for in
the analyses. Self-reported measures of weight tend to be
underestimated (52), and this varies by education, gender,
and race/ethnicity. However, if this underreporting is consis-
tent over time, the slope estimates for the growth trajectories
should not be affected.
In sum, these results highlight the importance of under-
standing midlife health and socioeconomic attainment from
a life course perspective, where early life disadvantage man-
ifests in more rapid weight gain throughout early adulthood,
with adverse consequences for midlife outcomes. Tailoring
policies and interventions to the needs and circumstances of
the poorest population groups is therefore critical for stem-
ming the cycle of cumulative disadvantage.
