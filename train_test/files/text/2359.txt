Objectives. Widowhood may result in declines in health and potentially stressful changes to daily routines. However,
little research has examined how daily stressors contribute to physical and emotional well-being in widowhood. The
objectives of the current study were to examine daily stressor exposure and reactivity in widowed versus married older
adults.
Method. Participants included all 100 widowed and 342 married adults aged 65 and older from the National Study
of Daily Experiences, a daily diary study from the second wave of the Midlife in the United States. Daily stressors were
measured using the Daily Inventory of Stressful Events; multilevel modeling assessed daily reactivity to stressors using
daily negative affect (emotional reactivity) and daily physical symptoms (physical reactivity) as outcomes.
Results. Married participants reported more stressors in general, and specifically more interpersonal stressors (e.g.,
arguments). Both married and widowed participants were reactive to daily stressors. Married participants were physically
and emotionally reactive to interpersonal stressors. Widowed participants were more physically reactive to home-related
stressors.
Discussion. Attention to the types of daily stressors that widowed older adults experience in daily life and the poten-
tial physical effects of daily stressors during widowhood may help to alleviate some of the physical distress that widowed
older adults may experience.
Key Words: Stress--Well-being--Widowhood--Daily diary.
Widowhood is a common and stressful life event,
which is likely to be accompanied by changes in all
aspects of daily life, and for some widows(er)s who have
recently experienced bereavement, a decline in mental and
physical health (Wilcox et al., 2003). Compared with their
married counterparts, widowed older adults have increased
risk of mortality and morbidity (Stroebe, Schut, & Stroebe,
2007). In addition, widowed older adults, compared with
married older adults, have, on average, a 44% lower eco-
nomic status (McGarry & Schoeni, 2005). Declines in
physical and mental health and disruptions to finances may
collectively result in distress for widowed older adults that
may potentially compromise long-term health and well-
being. Much of the widowhood research has examined the
well-being of widowed older adults using mainly clinical
or retrospective global measures of well-being, and less is
known about how this distressing life event may give rise to
other types of stressful experiences, such as subtle day-to-
day stressors or hassles.
Daily hassles are the minor, frequently occurring
challenges of daily life, such as household chores or having
a disagreement with a family member (Almeida, 2005;
Bolger, Delongis, Kessler, & Schilling, 1989; McIntyre,
2008) that have immediate, direct effects on health and
well-being (Bolger, Davis, & Rafaeli, 2003). The chronic
experience of stress, such as that which may occur in
response to continued daily stress within the context
of widowhood may lead to increased proinflammatory
cytokines (Kiecolt-Glaser, McGuire, Robles, & Glaser,
2002) and an overactivation and dysregulation of the body's
stress response that may result in a decreased ability to
respond to stress and potentially negative health outcomes
(Finch & Seeman, 1999). Previous research indicates that
individuals who experience repeated exposure to stress
(e.g., caregivers) or stressful life events have an increased
risk of worse physical and emotional health (Nolen-
Hoeksema & Ahrens, 2002; Pinquart & Sörensen, 2003).
Furthermore, it has also been suggested that disruption to
daily activities may be a possible mechanism by which older
adults with increased genetic, biological, or environmental
risk of depression experience depressive symptoms (Fiske,
Wetherell, & Gatz, 2009). Over time, widowhood may
require adjustment to new and different routines, identities,
and roles compared with previously established routines,
daily activities, or personal identity (Naef, Ward, Mahrer-
Imhof, & Grande, 2012).
The dual process coping model posits that bereavement
involves not only adjustment and coping with the emotional
19
HAHN ET AL.
loss of the spouse (loss-orientated coping) but also
adjustment to the changes in roles, responsibilities, and
daily routines after the death of the spouse (restoration-
oriented coping; Stroebe & Schut, 1999). Restoration-
oriented coping has been found to be more common a
year or more after the death of the spouse and has been
associated with positive outcomes, such as self-reported
personal growth and increased daily living skills (Caserta &
Lund, 2007). Caserta and Lund (2007) expanded on the dual
process model by incorporating the measurement of loss-
orientated and restoration-oriented coping in the Inventory
of Daily Widowed Life, which includes 22 items of daily
life activities assessed retrospectively during the past week,
including visiting with friends or relatives, engaging in
volunteer or work activities, and managing household
responsibilities. Research is needed to prospectively
examine naturally occurring daily experiences among
widowhood to better understand whether the long-term
changes in daily experiences as a result of widowhood are
related to differential exposure to stressors. Furthermore,
research is also needed to better understand how the
potentially different frequency and type of stressors that
widowed older adults experience may be associated with
physical and emotional well-being as a potential explanatory
mechanism for increased distress in widowed older adults.
The current study aimed to further contribute to this
research and address some of the gaps in the literature by
examining widowed older adults' adjustment to daily life.
The current study used a daily diary approach to examine
the potential role of daily stressors in relation to physical
and emotional well-being by examining differences in the
daily stress process between married and widowed older
adults. Advantages of the daily diary approach include the
measurement of events and experiences that "meaningfully"
vary over a short period of time and the ability to explain
the short-term variability in individuals (Affleck, Zautra,
Tennen, & Armeli, 1999; Bolger et al., 1989).
The daily stress process model incorporates both the
measurement of stressors and their effects on health as well
asthelikelihoodthattheseconceptswillvarywithintheshort
term in individuals. The daily stress process considers both
the likelihood that an individual will encounter a stressor
(i.e., stressor exposure) and an individual's emotional,
physiological, or behavioral response to that stressor (i.e.,
stressor reactivity; Almeida, 2005; Bolger & Zuckerman,
1995). Using this daily stress process model, past research
has identified that individuals report more physical symp-
toms and higher negative affect (Almeida, 2005) when they
experience more daily stressors. The model also incorpo-
rates the measurement of characteristics of stressors (e.g.,
stressor content) as well as resilience and risk factors (e.g.,
bereavement or health factors; Almeida, 2005). In order to
better understand the possible mechanisms of distress and
inform intervention and supportive services for widowed
older adults, the model emphasizes the importance of not
only examining stressors as a whole but also of examin-
ing specific types of daily stressors (e.g., stressors at home,
conflict with relative or friend) that may be related to worse
outcomes (Almeida, 2005; Dohrenwend, 2006).
Marital Status and Daily Stressor Exposure
Widowhood is a risk factor that may result in significant
changes to everyday life and increased exposure to stressful
or negative daily experiences. Previous research has found
that men report an increase in the number of hours spent
doing housework activities after the loss of their spouse
(Utz, Reidy, Carr, Nesse, & Wortman, 2004). For older
adults who may have relied on their spouse for daily tasks
or who are not proficient in completing those tasks, different
routines may be particularly distressing after their spouses'
death (Carr et al., 2000; Carr & Utz, 2001). Caserta and
Lund's (2007) Inventory of Daily Widowed Life identifies
other possible disruptions or changes to daily life following
widowhood, including "learning to do new things," "deal-
ing with financial matters," and "finding ways to keep busy
or occupied." Previous research has also identified greater
daily exchanges of support with friends or relatives among
widowed older adults compared with married older adults
that may be due to changes in household responsibilities
(Hahn, Cichy, Almeida, & Haley, 2011). As a result, rela-
tionships with friends and relatives may be particularly
important for widowed older adults (Ha & Ingersoll-Dayton,
2011). Supportive relationships with family and friends
help with widowed older adults' adjustment (Utz, Carr,
Nesse, & Wortman, 2002); however, increased contact with
family and friends also present opportunities to experience
stressful interpersonal events, such as arguments or disa-
greements. Despite the possible changes to daily routines,
research has yet to examine whether widowhood is associ-
ated with greater exposure to daily stressors and whether
different types of stressors, such as household responsibili-
ties or interpersonal stressors, occur more frequently among
widowed adults compared with their married counterparts.
Marital Status and Daily Stressor Reactivity
Reactivity in daily life may be a marker of the effect
of stressors on health and well-being. Previous research
examining reactivity to daily stressors has examined both
physical and emotional reactivity to stressors (i.e., daily
affect and physical symptoms; Affleck, Tennen, Urrows,
& Higgins, 1994; Birditt, Cichy, & Almeida, 2011).
Daily stressors have been associated with higher daily
negative affect among older adults (Mroczek & Almeida,
2004; Sliwinski, Almeida, Smyth, & Stawski, 2009).
However, other research has found similar emotional
reactivity to stressors among older and younger adults
(Stawski, Sliwinski, Almeida, & Smyth, 2008) or lower
emotional reactivity among older compared with younger
adults (Neupert, Almeida, & Charles, 2007). Research
that investigates differences in emotional reactivity as a
20
DAILY STRESSORS AND WELL-BEING
function of marital status may help to inform the current
state of research on emotional reactivity among older
adults. Increased risk of morbidity and decreased financial
resources during bereavement may alter widowed older
adults' capacity to respond to stressors over time, possibly
resulting in decreased resilience. Previous research suggests
that widowed older adults may experience physical effects
of stressors as evidenced by increased heart rate and
increased heart rate variability compared with depressed
and nonrecently bereaved participants (O'Connor, Allen, &
Kaszniak, 2002).
Stressors may not only affect physical health but daily
stressors may also affect emotional health. Emotion
regulation, such as in the context of coping with daily
stressors, has been identified as an important risk fac-
tor for bereavement outcomes (Stroebe & Schut, 1999).
Arguably, the chronic concerns widowed older adults
face, such as financial hardship, may exhaust their cop-
ing resources, leaving them more vulnerable than their
married counterparts to the negative effects of daily has-
sles, such as an argument with a friend or an unexpected
problem at home. Despite the evidence suggesting possi-
ble increased physical reactivity in widowed older adults
and the importance of daily emotional well-being for
long-term outcomes, research is limited that examines
both emotional and physical reactivity to daily stressors
among widowed older adults.
Current Study
Our study examined both within-person (WP) and
between-person (BP) differences in responses to daily
stressors in widowed and married older adults. In other
words, analyses were conducted that examined how indi-
viduals compare with themselves (WP effects or intraindi-
vidual variability) and how they compare with others (BP
effects or interindividual variability). The WP analyses
examined whether an outcome (e.g., daily negative affect)
is significantly associated with increased stressors com-
pared with that person's typical level of stressors. The BP
analyses examined whether individuals who experience
more stress, on average, have higher daily negative affect.
The current study has four specific research hypotheses.
First, widowed participants will experience a greater num-
ber of daily stressors compared with married participants
(Hypothesis 1). Second, participants will report higher
daily negative affect and more physical symptoms on
stressor days than on nonstressor days (WP stressor effect;
Hypothesis 2). Third, participants who experience more
stressors, in general, will have greater negative affect and
a greater number of physical symptoms compared with
participants who experience fewer stressors, in general (BP
stressor effect; Hypothesis 3). Fourth, we examined the
extent to which marital status (i.e., married vs. widowed)
moderated both WP and BP effects of daily stressors. We
hypothesized that widowed participants would experience
greater emotional and physical reactivity to daily stressors
compared with their married counterparts (Hypothesis 4).
Method
Procedure and Sample
Respondents are from the second wave of the National
Study of Daily Experiences (NSDE II;Almeida, McGonagle,
& King, 2009). NSDE II is one of the in-depth satellite
studies of the second wave of the Midlife in the United
States Survey (MIDUS II), a nationally representative tele-
phone­mail survey study of 4,963 people aged 35­86 years
(Keyes & Ryff, 1998; Lachman & Weaver, 1998; Mroczek
& Kolarz, 1998). The 2,022 respondents involved in the
NSDE II study were randomly selected from the larger
MIDUS II study, and the response rate for the NSDE II
sample was 86%. As part of NSDE II data collection, par-
ticipants completed up to eight daily interviews once a day
for eight consecutive days. On average, married participants
aged 65 and older in the current study completed 7.6 out of
8 interviews and widowed participants completed on aver-
age 7.4 interviews out of 8 compared with an average of 7.2
out of 8 interviews in the larger NSDE sample. Chi-square
analyses revealed no statistically significant differences in
the percentage of missed days for widowed versus married
participants (p > .05).
The current study includes 100 widowed and 342 mar-
ried participants aged 65 and older who participated in
NSDE II. There was not an adequate number of single or
divorced adults aged 65 and older to make a meaningful
comparison, so the current study includes only married and
widowed adults. Participants received $20 for participating
in the project, which consisted of nightly telephone inter-
views, where respondents answered questions about their
day. Participants were on average, 72 years of age, half
were female (54.98%), and most participants were White
(92.76%). Approximately 40% had some college education.
The widowed participants were significantly older, more
likely to be female, and reported lower levels of education.
Widowed participants had been bereaved for an average of
11 years (Table 1).

Measures
Daily stressors.--Daily stressors were measured each
day using the Daily Inventory of Stressful Events (DISE;
Almeida, Wethington, & Kessler, 2002). In the full DISE
measure, participants were asked whether they experienced
any of seven types of stressors that day. Participants
reported (a) whether they experienced an argument or
disagreement, (b) whether they avoided an argument or
disagreement (something happened that they could have
argued about but they decided to let it pass), (c) whether
they experienced a work- or school-related stressor, (d)
whether they experienced a home-related stressor, (e)
whether they experienced discrimination, (f) whether they
experienced a network stressor (something that happened to
a close friend or relative), and (g) if anything else happened
that was stressful for them. Participants responded yes (1)
or no (0). Based on previous research, the current study
incorporated four of the seven stressors that are the most
commonly occurring types of stressors (Almeida, 2005)
and that were believed to be relevant in the older adult
widowed population, including interpersonal stressors (i.e.,
arguments or avoided arguments), home stressors, and
network stressors. Network stressors refer to events that
do not directly involve the respondent that still turn out
to be stressful for the respondent, such as learning about
a friend's illness. Work- or school-related stressors were
excluded because of the age of the current sample (aged
65 and older), and discrimination and "any other" stressors
were excluded because of their low frequency of occurring
(<3.5% of days) in the NSDE sample (Almeida, 2005).
Daily negative affect.--Daily negative affect was meas-
ured using an adapted inventory of emotions from the Non-
Specific Psychological Distress Scale and the Positive and
Negative Affect Schedule (Kessler et al., 2002; Mroczek
& Kolarz, 1998; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988).
Respondents reported how often during the past day they
experienced 14 different negative emotions (e.g., worthless,
hopeless, and restless or fidgety) using a 5-point scale rang-
ing from 0 (none of the time) to 4 (all of the time). Items
for negative affect were summed for each day with higher
scores reflecting higher negative affect, and reliability for
the measure was high ( = .91).
Daily physical symptoms.--Participants reported each day
whether they experienced any of 25 physical symptoms (e.g.,
pain and musculoskeletal symptoms, gastrointestinal, flu and
respiratory symptoms, and other physical symptoms). The
number of symptoms were summed (range 0­25), and higher
scores reflected a greater number of physical symptoms.
Covariates.--Descriptive variables were assessed at
baseline and included the following covariates: age, edu-
cation (percent with high school degree), race (White or
non-White), gender, and depressive symptoms. Time since
widowhood was included as a descriptive characteristic
among the widowed sample, measured continuously as
the number of years since the spouse's death. Scores for
depressive symptoms ranged from 0 to 7. Specifically, par-
ticipants answered yes (1) or no (0) to the following seven
items: "During 2 weeks in the past 12 months, when you
felt sad, blue, or depressed, did you, `lose interest in most
things,' `feel more tired out or low on energy than usual,'
`lose your appetite,' `have more trouble falling asleep than
usual,' `have a lot more trouble concentrating than usual,'
`feel down on yourself, no good, or worthless,' or `think
a lot about death'" (Kessler, Mickelson, Walters, Zhao, &
Hamilton, 2004). The number of years since widowhood
was used as a covariate in the main analyses, and the aver-
age length of time since spousal death was imputed for mar-
ried participants (M = 11.30 years).
Analytic Strategy
Stressor exposure.--First, correlations were conducted
to check for multicollinearity between predictor variables.
Second, chi-square analyses were run to examine differ-
ences in daily stressor exposure (stressor day vs. nonstressor
day) between married and widowed participants (Hypothesis
1) for any stressors and for the specific stressor types (inter-
personal stressors, home stressors, and network stressors).
Stressor reactivity.--Second, reactivity models were
estimatedusingmultilevelmodels(MLM)withPROCMixed
in SAS Version 9.2. Because WP and BP predictors can
provide unique information about how individuals vary from
their own average and how individuals vary from each other,
both WP and BP predictors of the two outcome variables
were estimated (Curran & Bauer, 2011). Prior to conducting
analyses, an unconditional model was run to calculate the
intraclass correlation coefficient to determine the proportion
of WP and BP variability in both negative affect and physical
symptoms. Results of the unconditional models suggest
that 67% of the variability in daily physical symptoms was
between participants, and 33% of the variability was within
participants. For daily negative affect, 46% of the variability
was BP and 54% of the variability was WP. MLM estimated
the WP and BP effects of interpersonal stressors, home
stressors, and network stressors as predictors of negative
affect (Model 1) and number of physical health symptoms
(Model 2). For the WP analyses, the stressor variable was
coded as 1 for days when the participant reported a stressor
and 0 for days when the person did not report a stressor, and
the variable was also person-mean centered for multilevel
analyses to examine how participants vary from their own
average (Hypothesis 2). For the BP analyses, we aggregated
the number of daily stressors over the course of 8 days for
each person (Hypothesis 3).
22
DAILY STRESSORS AND WELL-BEING
Finally, the interactions between stressors and marital sta-
tus were also entered into each model to examine the extent
to which marital status moderates emotional and physical
reactivity to daily stressors (Hypothesis 4). For all analyses,
covariates were grand-mean centered. In both Models 1 and
2, age, gender, and education were included as covariates
because there were group differences in those covariates
for married and older adults. Depressive symptoms were
included as a covariate because of the significant relation-
ship with the outcome variables. Race was not included in
the models because there were no significant group differ-
ences, and it was not significantly related to either outcome
variable. Day of data collection (i.e., time) was included
as a covariate in all models because there was a significant
decrease in the reporting of physical symptoms and nega-
tive affect over the course of the 8 days of data collection.
Results
Exposure to Daily Stressors by Marital Status
Contrary to our hypothesis, married participants reported
experiencing "any stressor" on a greater percentage of days
than widowed participants (26.8% vs. 21.0%, p < .001).
Married participants also reported experiencing an interper-
sonal stressor on a significantly greater percentage of days
than widowed participants (16.7% and 12.5%, p < .001). Both
married and widowed participants reported experiencing home
stressors on approximately 6% of days, and network stressors
were reported on approximately 5% of days, and there were no
group differences (p > .05).
Emotional Reactivity to Daily Stressors
Results revealed older participants and those with higher
depressive symptoms at baseline were more likely to report
higher daily negative affect. Time was a significant predictor
of negative affect, suggesting a decrease in negative affect
over the course of the daily diary collection. Results of the
main analyses examining emotional reactivity to stressors
suggest that after controlling for other types of stressors,
interpersonal stressors were significantly predictive of
higher daily negative affect at both the WP and BP levels
(Table 2). The WP effect suggests that on days when
individuals reported an interpersonal stressor, they reported
higher negative affect compared with days when they did not
experience an interpersonal stressor. The BP effect indicates
that individuals who on average have more interpersonal
stressors report greater negative affect. In addition, increased
WP and BP home-related stressors were significant predictors
of increased negative affect, and higher WP network stressors
predicted higher daily negative affect. These results suggest
thatondayswhenapersonreportsahome-relatedstressorora
network stressor, they report higher negative affect compared
with a day when that person does not report a home-related
or network stressor. Also, people who in general report more
home-related stressors also report higher negative affect.
Marital status differences.--Marital status was a signifi-
cant moderator of emotional reactivity to WP interpersonal
stressors. The interaction effect is illustrated in Figure 1 and
shows that on days when both widowed (Estimate = 0.05,
SE = 0.02, p = .01) and married adults (Estimate = 0.11,
SE = 0.01, p < .001) reported an interpersonal stressor,

they reported higher negative affect than on a day when
they did not report an interpersonal stressor; however, this
effect was stronger for married adults compared with wid-
owed participants. Figure 1 also shows that on nonstressor
days, widowed participants report higher negative affect,
and they are similar to married participants on interper-
sonal stressor days resulting in less emotional reactivity
among the widowed participants from a nonstressor day to
a stressor day; however, they report higher negative affect
overall across nonstressor and stressor days. Marital sta-
tus did not moderate emotional reactivity to other types of
daily stressors.
Physical Reactivity to Daily Stressors
Results indicated that participants who were older,
female, married, and had higher depressive symptoms were
significantly more likely to report a greater number of daily
physical symptoms. Time was also a significant predictor,
suggesting a significant decrease in daily physical symp-
toms over the course of the week of daily diary collection.
Controlling for other types of stressors, increased home-
related stressors were significant predictors of a greater
number of daily physical symptoms at both the WP and BP
levels (Table 2). These results indicate that on a day when
a person reports a home-related stressor, they report more
physical symptoms than on a day when they do not report
a home-related stressor. In addition, people who in general
report more home-related stressors also report more physi-
cal symptoms, on average. The BP effect of interpersonal
stressors remained a significant predictor of a greater num-
ber of daily physical symptoms, suggesting that participants
who, on average, report more interpersonal stressors also
report a greater number of physical symptoms.
Marital status differences.--Marital status was a signifi-
cantmoderatorofWPphysicalreactivitytoWPhome-related
stressors (Figure 2). In other words, widowed participants
report significant increases in physical symptoms on a day
with a home-related stressor (Estimate = 0.53, SE = 0.18,
p = .004), whereas married participants do not report
increased physical symptoms on days when they report a
home-related stressor compared with days when they do not
report a home-related stressor. Marital status did not moder-
ate physical reactivity to the other types of daily stressors.
Discussion
The current study examined widowed older adults'
adjustment to daily life by examining whether daily stressor
exposure and stressor reactivity varied between married and
widowed adults. The results of this study suggest that (a)
married participants reported more stressors in general,
and in particular, more interpersonal stressors compared
with widowed participants; (b) married and widowed par-
ticipants were both emotionally reactive to interpersonal
stressors, but married participants were significantly more
emotionally reactive; and (c) widowed participants were
physically reactive to home-related stressors. In support of
the daily stress process model and partially in support of our
hypotheses, daily stressors were associated with increased
negative affect for all participants, and emotional and physi-
cal reactivity was moderated by marital status. In support of
our hypothesis, widowed participants were more physically
reactive to home-related stressors. In contrast, our finding
of greater emotional reactivity to interpersonal stressors
among married participants was unexpected.
Marital Status and Daily Stressor Exposure
Contrary to our hypothesis, married participants reported
significantly more stressors, in general, and specifically
married participants reported more interpersonal stressors.
We also found that married participants experienced greater
emotional reactivity to interpersonal stressors compared
with widowed participants. Constant interaction with a
spouse may put married participants at increased risk of
repeated exposure to interpersonal tensions. In additional
post hoc analyses examining the person with whom married

DAILY STRESSORS AND WELL-BEING
versus widowed participants experienced interpersonal
tensions, married participants reported the majority of their
arguments involved their spouse (68%), whereas widowed
participants reported the most arguments with "friends" or
"others." When spousal arguments are excluded from the
comparison of daily stressors between married and widowed
participants, the significant differences in reports of "any
stressors" and "interpersonal stressors," as illustrated in
Figure 3, were reduced to nonsignificant levels (p > .05),
suggesting that married older adults' greater stressor
exposure, particularly to interpersonal tensions, is largely
attributable to married older adults' increased opportunities
to argue or disagree with their spouse.
There were no differences in exposure to network or
home stressors between married and widowed participants.
However, because long-term widowed older adults may
have adjusted to daily life and are more likely to have more
confidence in daily living skills (Caserta & Lund, 2007),
incorporation of widowed participants with a range of years
since widowhood may mask some variation in exposure to
daily stressors among the recent widowed older adults.
Marital Status and Daily Stressor Reactivity
Unexpectedly, married participants were more emo-
tionally reactive to interpersonal stressors than widowed
participants. However, widowed participants were not
immune to the negative effects of other daily stressful
events as evidenced by similarity in emotional reactivity
to network and home-related stressors among married and
widowed older adults and higher negative affect overall
on noninterpersonal stressor and interpersonal stressor
days. These findings also support previous research that
finds some evidence of stability and resilience in the long
term for widowed older adults (Bonanno, Moskowitz,
Papa, & Folkman, 2005). Married participants, however,
may be more emotionally reactive to interpersonal stress-
ors because for married adults, these events are likely to
include a spouse. In an analysis of emotional reactivity to
stressors as a function of marital status excluding spousal
arguments, the effects of increased emotional reactivity
to interpersonal stressors among married participants are
reduced to nonsignificant. These results suggest that both
widowed and married participants report emotional reac-
tivity to interpersonal stressors, and that marital status dif-
ferences in emotional reactivity to interpersonal stressors
are driven by spousal relations. Previous research has indi-
cated that marital relationships may be a particularly sali-
ent relationship for older adults as illustrated by a stronger
relationship between marital quality and psychological
well-being among older adults compared with younger
adults (Bookwala & Jacobs, 2004).
In support of our hypotheses, our findings also provide
some evidence of decreased resilience in the daily lives
of widowed participants. The widowed participants in our
study were more physically reactive to home-related stress-
ors. Our finding of greater physical reactivity among wid-
owed older adults in a sample with a range of years since
the loss of their spouse suggests that they may be more
physically vulnerable to the changes in daily life during
widowhood even after many years of adjustment to the loss
of a spouse. The dual process model of coping suggests
that restoration-oriented adjustment to widowhood may
include coping with tasks of daily life (Caserta & Lund,
2007) and that widowed older adults may better adjust to
these tasks over time. Our finding of similar exposure to

home-related stressors in widowed and married older adults
despite greater physical reactivity to home-related stressors
among widowed participants suggests that the changes to
daily life that accompany the loss of a spouse may, in fact,
have lingering effects. The daily stress process model pos-
its that risk factors may increase vulnerability to the nega-
tive effects of stressors (Almeida, 2005), and our findings
suggest that widowhood may be a possible risk factor. The
differences in reactivity by stressor types also support the
importance of identifying and examining different types of
stressors, as suggested by the daily stress process model
(Almeida, 2005). The greater physical reactivity to home-
related stressors in the widowed population and greater
emotional reactivity among married participants suggests
that while older adults, regardless of marital status may
experience reactivity, different daily routines, activities, and
interactions that may vary based on marital status may be a
mechanism by which adults experience differential declines
in health and well-being.
The finding of significant effects in both WP and BP
analyses illustrates the importance of examining both
intraindividual and interindividual variations in the asso-
ciations between stressors and well-being. The intrain-
dividual variations may produce temporary distress in
day-to-day life as a result of daily events and particular
experiences, and the interindividual variations may result
in negative outcomes over time associated with repeated
stressor exposure. These results collectively suggest that
the experience of daily stressors is associated with both
physical and mental health among older adults, regardless
of marital status. However, there may also be differences in
the extent and type of reactivity based on stressor type and
marital status of the participants that may help to increase
our understanding of the mechanisms contributing to over-
all health status.
In addition, the finding of greater physical symptoms
among married compared with widowed participants was
unexpected. Research has shown that with increasing age,
individuals are more likely to self-report their physical
health more positively (Idler, 1993). Despite our controlling
for age in the analysis of marital status and the age range
of both the widowed and married participants being more
than 65 years, there may be a potential confounding
unmeasured variable associated with age, marital status,
or physical symptoms that resulted in higher reporting
of physical symptoms in the sample of married older
adults. Furthermore, repeated exposure to stress may have
cumulative effects over time (McEwen & Seeman, 1999),
and the greater overall exposure to stressors may contribute
to participants reporting more physical symptoms regardless
of the type of day (stressor day vs. nonstressor day). Finally,
married participants may report more physical symptoms
because they are more accustomed to sharing their physical
symptoms with their spouse and are therefore more likely to
report symptoms as part of a study.
Study Limitations and Future Directions
Some limitations in the current study and suggestions
for future research should be mentioned. First, the obser-
vational measurement of reported stressors, daily negative
affect, and daily physical symptoms does not examine
causal relationships that would further inform the cur-
rent understanding of marital status and stressor reactiv-
ity. Future research examining reported daily affect and
daily physical symptoms before and after the experience
of widowhood and before and after the experience of a
daily stressor is needed to better understand the tem-
poral order and the role of stressors in daily health and
well-being. Previous research has examined reactivity to
stressors using measures both before and after a stressor in
other populations, including middle-aged and older adults
who are working versus retired (Wong & Almeida, 2012)
and reactivity to daily stressors in younger versus older
adults (Dijkstra, Charness, Yordon, & Fox, 2009). Similar
research is needed among widowed older adults com-
pared with older adults of other marital statuses, includ-
ing married, single, and divorced older adults. Second, the
significant decrease in the outcome variables over time
(i.e., negative affect and physical symptoms) suggests a
possible reporting bias where participants may be report-
ing (but not experiencing) fewer symptoms and emotions
over repeated daily interviews. The current study included
time as a covariate to control for possible effects of this
drop-off in reports of negative affect and physical symp-
toms. Moreover, we attempted to control for group dif-
ferences in demographic characteristics by using them as
covariates in the analyses, but another method would be
to match samples on these characteristics (Cook, Steiner,
& Pohl, 2009), but the relatively small sample size in the
current study precluded such an approach. In addition, it is
also possible that because of the differences in covariates
between the married and widowed participants, we were
unable to account for differences in the slope, or the rela-
tionship between stressors and outcomes (negative affect
and physical symptoms) that may vary as a function of
the covariates. Larger sample sizes that are matched by
demographics or that include the covariates as moderators
in the marital status by stressor interaction effect would
provide a better understanding of the role of demograph-
ics in the reactivity relationship for widowed versus mar-
ried participants. Similarly, because of the relatively small
sample size, we did not examine gender differences in the
proposed relationships between daily stressors and reac-
tivity to stressors. Given the evidence of possible differ-
ences in exposure and reactivity to stressors as a function
of gender (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2001), future research with
adequate sample sizes should examine potential gender
differences. Third, the study only examined a few types
of stressors believed to be associated with widowhood.
Future research should continue to examine daily stressors
within the context of other factors that may be associated
26
DAILY STRESSORS AND WELL-BEING
with health and well-being in widowhood, such as the
preference for help with daily activities or the levels of
and desire for social contact. Fourth, there may be some
group differences, which were not included in the current
analyses, such as marital satisfaction for the married par-
ticipants and for the widowed participants, time since the
death of their spouse. For most widowed participants in
the current study, it has been 5­10 years since the death
of a spouse, so findings might differ if research consid-
ered daily stressors among more recently widowed older
adults. Also, in the current study, our interaction effects
were relatively small, suggesting further work is needed to
prospectively examine daily stressor exposure and reactiv-
ity in a larger sample with multiple marital status groups to
better determine the meaning of the results.
Conclusions
In conclusion, although widowhood may not result
in increased exposure to stressors, our findings provide
support for both similarities and differences in stressor
reactivity among married and widowed older adults.
Married older adults were more emotionally reactive to
interpersonal stressors, whereas widowed older adults
were more physically reactive to home-related stressors.
Attention to the types of daily stressors that widowed older
adults experience in daily life, and the potential physical
effects of daily stressors during widowhood may help to
alleviate some of the physical distress widowed older adults
may experience. In addition, further research is needed to
better understand how intervention and supportive services
targeting physical reactivity in widowhood may help to
alleviate potential long-term health risks associated with
physical responses to home-related stressors.
