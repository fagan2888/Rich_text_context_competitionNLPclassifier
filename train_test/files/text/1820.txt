Background: Increased C-reactive protein (CRP) con-
centration and insulin resistance (IR) are associated
with increased rates of adverse cardiovascular events.
We sought to examine the relationship of CRP with
surrogate measures of IR among nondiabetic adults in
the US.
Methods: We conducted analyses using data from the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
1999­2002. We analyzed a nationally representative
sample of 2514 men and nonpregnant women age >20
years who were non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, or Mexican American.
Results: After adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity,
smoking status, systolic blood pressure, and serum
concentrations of HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and
triglyceride, CRP was significantly associated with 10 IR
measures (all P values <0.01). The strength of the
association attenuated after further adjustment for waist
circumference (change in adjusted regression coeffi-
cients ranging from 60.0% to 75.1%). The association of
CRP with each IR surrogate was similar (standardized
regression coefficient ranges from 0.06 to 0.09). The
association of CRP (>3 vs <1 mg/L) with the homeosta-
sis model for assessment of IR (>75th vs <75th percen-
tile) was statistically significant among people with a
body mass index >30 kg/m2 (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% CI,
1.3­5.1) or with a body mass index <25 kg/m2 (odds
ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5­4.2).
Conclusions: CRP was significantly associated with the
surrogate measures of IR among nondiabetic adults.
Obesity may play an important role in the association of
CRP with IR in this nationally representative sample.

Insulin resistance (IR)5 is a pathophysiological state char-
acterized by a subnormal physiological response to insu-
lin concentrations within reference intervals. Experimen-
tal and epidemiological studies have demonstrated a
strong association of IR with many diseases or metabolic
abnormalities, including coronary heart disease, stroke,
type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, systemic
inflammation, and atherogenesis (1, 2).
It is estimated that approximately 20.6 million adults
aged 20 years or older in the US have diabetes, with the
majority of these having type 2 diabetes in 2005 (3). The
prevalence of hyperinsulinemia has increased by 35%
among nondiabetic adults in the US in the past decade (4).
It is believed that IR and subsequently compensatory
hyperinsulinemia develop much earlier than -cell dys-
function and may exist and progress years before even
prediabetes would be diagnosed by the detection of

Several studies have demonstrated that early interven-
tions, including lifestyle modification and pharmacologi-
cal treatment, can effectively delay the onset of diabetes
in prediabetic individuals and therefore decrease the
incidence of cardiovascular disease and other diabetes-
related chronic illnesses (5, 6). Thus, early identification
of individuals who have developed IR is particularly
important in clinical practice, but diagnosis is challenging.
Although IR can be determined by a variety of meth-
ods, they are difficult to apply in daily clinical practice,
particularly in outpatient care settings. Evidence indi-
cates that compensatory hyperinsulinemia is highly cor-
related with IR (7) and may offer a more useful way to
identify insulin-resistant patients than measurements of
glucose intolerance. However, analytic methods for insu-
lin measurements are not standardized, and it is difficult
to relate absolute values of plasma insulin concentrations
from one laboratory to another (8).
C-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker for systemic subclin-
ical inflammation and may have prognostic value in identi-
fying persons who are at an increased risk of developing
type 2 diabetes and subsequent cardiovascular complica-
tions (9). Given its ease of measurement, biological stability,
and improved high-sensitivity method, CRP may be useful
as a clinical measure for identifying individuals at risk for IR
(10). CRP has been associated with increased adiposity (11),
but only a few studies have demonstrated that CRP is
associated with IR independent of obesity (12).
Because it is not feasible to directly measure IR in
large epidemiologic studies, surrogate measures using
fasting insulin or the combination of fasting insulin
with fasting glucose or triglyceride (TG) have been
proposed (13­21). Little is known, however, about the
association of CRP with different surrogate measures of
IR. In this study, we used data from the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999­2002
to examine the association of CRP with a series of surrogate
measures of IR.
Materials and Methods
study design and participants
NHANES 1999­2002 is a stratified, multistage probability
sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized US population.
Trained interviewers, using a computer-assisted personal
survey system, spoke to participants at home. Respon-
dents were then asked to attend a mobile examination
center, where they completed additional questionnaires,
underwent various examinations, and provided blood
samples. Details of the NHANES 1999­2002 surveys may
be found elsewhere (22, 23). This analysis was limited to
men and nonpregnant women who were 20 years old,
were non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or Mexi-
can-American Hispanics, did not use hormone therapy,
had no diagnosed diabetes or hypoglycemia medications
or fasting glucose 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L), had morn-
ing blood drawn with fasting time 8 h, and had CRP
concentration 10 mg/L (n  4040).
procedures
Detailed descriptions of blood collection and processing
have been previously provided (24). In brief, serum
specimens were frozen at 70 °C, shipped on dry ice,
and stored at 70 °C until analysis. CRP concentrations
were quantified at the University of Washington Medical
Center, Seattle, WA, by latex-enhanced nephelometry, a
high-sensitivity assay, on a BN II nephelometer (Dade
Behring). Control materials of 2 concentrations from Bio-
Rad Laboratories were used for QC purposes, and CVs
ranged from 4.93% to 7.84%.
Serum insulin concentration was measured using an
RIA reagent set from Pharmacia Diagnostics. The cross-
reactivity of Pharmacia insulin antibody with proinsulin
is approximately 40%. All insulin assays for NHANES
1999­2002 were performed by the same laboratory at the
University of Missouri-Columbia. Identical laboratory
procedures for insulin assays and their QC were per-
formed. The overall CVs were 3.3%­5.4% in NHANES
1999­2002. Plasma glucose concentration was measured
using an enzymatic reaction. Serum TG concentration
was measured enzymatically after hydrolyzation to glyc-
erol, and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) was measured after
the precipitation of other lipoproteins with a heparin-
manganese chloride mixture.
Up to 4 blood pressure readings were obtained in
the mobile examination center. The mean of the last 2
measurements for participants who had 3 or 4 mea-
surements, the last measurement for participants with
2 measurements, and the single measurement for par-
ticipants who had only 1 measurement were used to
establish blood pressure status. Body mass index
[BMI  weight (kg)/height (m)2] was calculated using
measured weight and height, and BMIs were catego-
rized into 3 groups (1, 25; 2, 25­29.9; and 3, 30)
according to WHO criteria (25). Waist circumference
was measured with a steel measuring tape to the
nearest 0.1 cm at the high point of the iliac crest at
minimal respiration.
surrogate measures of ir
A total of 10 surrogate measures of IR were used in this
study, including fasting insulin, homeostasis model as-
sessment (HOMA) of IR, log (1/HOMA), empirical fast-
ing IR index, fasting insulin:fasting glucose ratio,
Raynaud index, Bennetts index, quantitative insulin sen-
sitivity check index, Avignon index, and McAuley index
(see Appendix). Nine indices were derived from the
measures of fasting insulin and fasting glucose or TG.
The formulas for calculating these indices are provided
in the Appendix. In addition, we included the C-peptide
concentrations as a marker of insulin secretion because it
is cosecreted with insulin in equimolar amounts but is not
subject to hepatic clearance (26).

statistical analysis
We assessed continuous variables for gaussian distribu-
tion and performed logarithm transformation for fasting
insulin, CRP, and C-peptide to approximate a gaussian
distribution. Means and Pearson correlation coefficients
were calculated for all surrogate measures of IR and
CRP. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed
to assess the association of CRP with IR surrogate mea-
sures, adjusting for potential confounders including age,
sex, race/ethnicity, smoking status, systolic blood pres-
sure (SBP), and concentrations of HDL-C, LDL cholesterol
(LDL-C), and TG. Additional adjustment for waist cir-
cumference was made to examine the role of central
obesity in the association. Using the standardized score of
dependent and independent variables, a standardized
regression coefficient of CRP for each IR measure was
calculated to facilitate the comparisons of association
between CRP and the IR surrogate measures with differ-
ent units.
Because no standardization of insulin assay is avail-
able, a universal cutoff value of fasting insulin or HOMA
to define IR is not available. Therefore, we defined the
HOMA-IR using the 75th percentile of HOMA generated
among nondiabetic adults in NHANES III as a cutoff
value according to the suggestion of the European Group
for the Study of Insulin Resistance (27). In addition, we
categorized CRP into 3 groups (1, 1 to 3, and 3 mg/L)
(28). To examine the role of obesity for the association of
CRP with IR surrogate measures, odds ratios and 95% CI
of CRP for HOMA-IR were estimated in multiple logistic
regression models stratified by the 3 BMI categories. An 
of 0.05 was used to define statistical significance for
2-sided tests. All analyses were conducted using SAS
(version 8.2) and SUDAAN software (Release 9.0, Re-
search Triangle Institute), to account for the complex
sampling design.
Results
Among participants who met inclusion criteria for our
analyses (n  4040), we further excluded those with
missing data for fasting insulin, glucose, C-peptide, TG,
HDL-C, or LDL-C (n  1392), and for smoking, SBP,
weight, height, or waist circumference (n  134). The final
analytic sample (n  2514; 62.3%) comprised 56.7% males,
79.7% whites, 12.0% blacks, and 8.3% Mexican Americans.
The percentage of current smokers was 25.9%, 27.3%, and
23.7% for white, black, and Mexican-American respon-
dents, respectively. As shown in Table 1, black and
Mexican-American participants were younger than
whites (P 0.0001). Compared to white participants,
blacks had higher SBP (P 0.01), fasting insulin (P 0.01),
HDL-C (P 0.01), and body weight (P 0.01), but lower
fasting glucose (P 0.01), C-peptide (P 0.01), TG (P
0.0001), and LDL-C (P 0.01). In contrast, Mexican
Americans had lower SBP (P 0.01), HDL-C (P 0.01),
LDL-C (P 0.01), and body weight (P 0.01), but higher
fasting insulin (P 0.0001) than whites. There were no
significant differences in geometric means of CRP (P 
0.38) and waist circumferences (P  0.45) among race/
ethnic groups. Black participants had higher mean fasting
insulin:fasting glucose ratios and McAuley indices than
whites.
The unadjusted Pearson correlation coefficients of CRP
with the 10 measures of IR ranged from 0.32 to 0.39
among whites (P 0.001), from 0.28 to 0.36 among blacks
(P 0.01), and from 0.29 to 0.36 among Mexican Ameri-
cans (P 0.001) (Table 2). The correlation coefficients were
not statistically significant between CRP and log fasting
insulin, HOMA, log (1/HOMA), empirical fasting IR
index, and fasting insulin:fasting glucose ratio across the
3 racial or ethnic groups. In contrast, the correlation
coefficients were statistically significant between CRP and
Raynaud index, Bennetts index, quantitative insulin sen-
sitivity check index, Avignon index, and McAuley index
across the 3 racial or ethnic groups.
Multiple linear regression analyses showed that CRP
was significantly associated with all 10 measures of IR
after adjustment for age, sex, race or ethnicity, smoking
status, SBP, HDL-C, LDL-C, TG (except for the McAuley
index) (model 1; Table 3). The associations were attenu-
ated after further adjustment for waist circumference
(model 2; Table 3). The change in adjusted regression
coefficient of CRP on IR surrogate measures between
model 1 and model 2 ranged from 60.0% to 75.1%. The
partial R2 of CRP decreased after additional adjustment
for waist circumference.
The associations of CRP with the surrogate measures of
IR were statistically significant among participants with
BMI 25 kg/m2 (P ranged from 0.001 to 0.005) and
among participants with BMI 30 kg/m2 (P 0.001 for all
measures), but not statistically significant among partici-
pants whose BMI was between 25 and 30 kg/m2 (P
ranged from 0.18 to 0.67) (Table 4).
Participants with CRP 3 mg/L and BMI 30 kg/m2
had the highest prevalence of IR (76.2%), whereas those
with CRP 1 mg/L and BMI 25 kg/m2 had the lowest
prevalence of IR (6.6%) (Fig. 1). After adjustment for age,
sex, race/ethnicity, smoking status, SBP, serum concen-
trations of HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG, the association of CRP
(3 vs 1 mg/L) with HOMA-IR (75th vs 75th
percentile) was statistically significant among people with
a BMI 30 kg/m2 (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.3­5.1) or with
a BMI 25 kg/m2 (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5­4.2). The
linear trend in the odds ratios of CRP (1, 1 to 3, 3
mg/L) for HOMA IR was statistically significant among
people with a BMI 25 kg/m2 (P  0.0003) and with a
BMI 30 kg/m2 (P  0.01), but not statistically significant
among people with a BMI between 25 and 30 kg/m2
(P  0.77). There was a marginally significant interaction
between CRP and BMI on HOMA-IR (P  0.07).
Discussion
Using the recent nationally representative sample, we
found that CRP was significantly associated with all 10
2154 Meng et al.: CRP and IR
surrogate measures of IR among nondiabetic US adults.
This association appeared to be consistent across the 3
racial or ethnic groups. Approximately 60%­75% of the
variance for the association of CRP with IR was explained
by central obesity status as measured by waist circumfer-
ence. Among obese participants with a high concentration
of CRP (3 mg/L), approximately 76% had IR as defined
using the 75th percentile of HOMA. More importantly,
our data showed that CRP was significantly associated
with surrogate measures of IR among people with a BMI
25 kg/m2.
The unique results of our study are the consistent
significant associations of CRP with all 10 surrogate IR
measures and across the 3 racial or ethnic groups. Among
the 10 surrogate measures of IR, CRP appeared to be more
strongly associated with fasting insulin, Raynaud index,
quantitative insulin sensitivity check index, and McAuley
index. The common feature of these 4 IR indices is that
they involve only fasting insulin or an addition of fasting
glucose or TG, suggesting that the fasting glucose concen-
tration does not always correctly reflect the status of IR or
insulin action. Previous studies have shown that fasting
insulin alone may be a simple and effective surrogate
measure of IR (29). Our results are consistent with these
studies in that fasting insulin was at least as good as other
complex indices of IR in relation to CRP.
Our results were consistent with previous studies that
have examined associations of some measures of IR, such

as fasting insulin and HOMA, with CRP in diabetic
patients (30) and nondiabetic Asians (31). It is interesting
that although measurements of fasting glucose concentra-
tions are necessary for the diagnosis of prediabetes and
diabetes according to the current clinical guidelines, in
nondiabetic individuals these measurements may not be
necessary for identifying IR, whereas measurements of
fasting insulin can be quite useful. Commercial laborato-
ries should consider reporting not only the absolute
insulin concentration but also information as to where the
value falls within the laboratory's frequency distribution
of nondiabetic individuals.
As shown in our study, approximately 60%­75% of the
variance for the association between CRP and IR can be
explained by waist circumference, suggesting that central
obesity plays an important role in the association of CRP
with IR. Numerous studies have shown that both CRP
and IR are related to obesity (28, 32­34). However,
whether obesity plays a role as a moderator or mediator
for the association of CRP with IR is still elusive. Recent
studies have demonstrated that obesity was a major
determinant for the association of CRP with metabolic
syndrome among patients with type 2 diabetes (35) and in
the general adult population (36). Our results add further
support for the notion that central obesity as measured by
waist circumference or overall obesity as measured by
BMI could be a mediator for the association of CRP with
IR among nondiabetic adults.
In addition, consistent with recent studies (34), we
found that this relationship was also significant among
people who had normal weight (BMI 25 kg/m2). Al-
though the mechanism for the association between CRP

2156 Meng et al.: CRP and IR
and IR is not fully understood, study evidence suggests
that low-grade, chronic inflammation state may lead to IR
because of the role of inflammatory cytokines released
from adipocytes (34). This and other previous studies (34)
reporting the association of CRP with IR independent of
obesity suggest that another pathway linking inflamma-
tion and IR among nonobese individuals is also plausible.
In the high IR tertile, about 1 in 6 people was of normal
weight (37); thus the search for clinically useful biomar-
kers of IR among this subpopulation is necessary. Al-
though BMI, a less expensive and convenient measure,
may serve as an indicator for IR among people with
excessive weight, CRP could be 1 of the novel biomarkers
for IR among people with normal weight.
One of the interesting findings in our study was the
lack of association between CRP and surrogate measures
of IR among people who were overweight (i.e., BMI
between 25 and 29.9 kg/m2). The exact physiological and
biochemical mechanisms for this observation are un-
known, but this finding might be attributable to the poor
discriminatory power of BMI for body fat and lean mass.
A recent study demonstrated that a BMI 30 kg/m2
had good specificity but poor sensitivity, whereas a BMI
25 kg/m2 had good sensitivity but poor specificity to
detect obesity as defined by body fat 25% in men and
35% in women (38). Small increases of BMI as seen in
overweight people could be due to increases in body fat
or increments in lean mass or both. Preserved and in-
creased lean mass have been associated with better fitness
and exercise capacity, whereas excessive body fatness has
been associated with adverse metabolic profiles (39).
Further studies are warranted to examine the mechanisms
for the interrelations of CRP, IR, and body composition.
Alternative methods might be needed to accurately char-
acterize people who truly have excessive body fat vs those
who have increased muscle mass, especially when their
BMI is mildly increased.
Our study has several strengths. First, we used 10
surrogate measures of IR and C-peptide as a measure-
ment of -cell function (26) to examine the association of
CRP with IR and insulin secretion. Our results showed
that the association appeared to be consistent using any of
these measures. Second, we used a large representative
sample of US adults; therefore, we were able to conduct
analyses stratified by race or ethnicity or body weight
status. Our results indicated that the association of CRP
with IR is potentially generalizable across different racial
or ethnic groups because the association between CRP
and some surrogate measures of IR (e.g., fasting insulin
and HOMA) appeared to be similar by race/ethnicity.

There are several limitations in the present study. First,
we used a cross-sectional design; therefore the observed
association between CRP and surrogate measures of IR
may not be assumed causal. It is likely that IR could
contribute to the increase of CRP (33). Second, we did not
have a direct measure of IR in our data; thus, we were
unable to validate the surrogate measures. Previous eval-
uation studies have shown that simple indices, particu-
larly fasting insulin, are valid and reliable surrogate
measures of IR in large epidemiologic studies. The 3rd
limitation was related to the use of a single insulin assay
measured with the Pharmacia Insulin RIA reagent set.
Because no standardization of insulin assays is available
thus far, caution may be needed when comparing our
results with other assays. The cross-reactivity of Pharma-
cia insulin antibody with proinsulin (approximately 40%)
may overestimate the true insulin concentrations in the
population. However, because proinsulin concentration is
relatively low among people without diabetes (40), the
impact of cross-reactivity between insulin and proinsulin
on our results could be minimal.
In conclusion, because we are unable to routinely measure
IR in clinical practice, efforts to find simple measures for
IR are ongoing. One of the clinical challenges of identify-
ing individuals with IR is the cumbersome nature of the
assays. Obesity, particularly central obesity, plays an
important role for the association between CRP and IR;
however, it is conceivable that the use of CRP in clinical
settings could facilitate an earlier identification of IR
among people who may not achieve certain clinical
thresholds for measures of adiposity or fasting glucose. In
addition, by providing a simple and cost-effective way to
identify high-risk individuals with IR, the measurement
of CRP concentration might facilitate preventive interven-
tions in patients who are at greatest risk of developing
diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, or cardiovascular
complications.
