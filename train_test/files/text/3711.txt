Introduction
The renin-angiotensin system (RAS)
The RAS is a proteolytic cascade that consists of multiple
enzymes and effector peptides. Angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) is one of the major enzymes in the RAS
catalyzing the proteolytic conversion of the decapeptide
angiotensin I (Ang I) to the octapeptide angiotensin II
(Ang II, Ang 1-8).1,2 Ang II is involved in blood pressure
and volume homeostasis as well as the development of
hypertension, by promoting vascular smooth muscle cell
migration, hypertrophy and delayed hyperplasia.2 All
components of the RAS are present in human plasma
with renin the rate-limiting enzyme of the RAS, catalyz-
ing the conversion of pro-hormone angiotensinogen
(10 N-terminal amino acids of the 452 amino acid-secreted
protein) to Ang I.3 Ang I is the substrate for the production
of the other angiotensin metabolites. Angiotensinogen is

Abstract
Objective: The objective of this study was to make use of a quantitative and qualitative approach comparing the
systemic renin-angiotensin system (RAS) of hypertensive black and white African men by using RAS equilibrium analysis.
Materials and methods: This sub-study involved 23 black (n = 15) and white (n = 8) hypertensive men aged 39.5­41
years, living in the North West Province of South Africa. The RAS-Fingerprinting was determined with LC-MS/MS
quantification of angiotensin peptides. Blood pressure and other variables were determined with known methods.
Results: The main finding of this study was the significant lower Ang I (<5.0 and 45.1 pg/ml; p = 0.005) and Ang
II (15.6 and 123.9 pg/ml; p  0.001) encountered in the hypertensive black African men compared to their white
counterparts. Levels of Ang 1-5 (downstream metabolite of Ang 1-7) (1.8 and 3.0 pg/ml), were detected in black and
white hypertensive men, respectively.
Conclusions: The observed differences between circulating RAS components, which are reflected via equilibrium
angiotensin levels, point to a distinctive molecular regulation of the RAAS in the two study cohorts. The increased
peripheral resistance observed in hypertensive black individuals might take over a dominant role in control of blood
pressure in this study population. A novel highly sensitive LC-MS/MS method resolved the issue of peptide recovery
variations during sample preparation by using internal standards for each individual angiotensin metabolite.

produced by the liver and secreted to the circulation, gen-
erating a pool of angiotensinogen with concentrations in
humans normally in a range of 5­50 µg/ml (100­1000 nM).3
Typical baseline values for plasma renin activity (PRA)
in humans range between 0.1 and 2.35 (nmol/l)/h,4 while
PRA values up to 20 (nmol/l)/h might be reached under
pathologic conditions or on treatment with RAS blockers.5,6
Concentration and post-translational modifications of angi-
otensinogen can affect PRA.7
High renin levels result in increased Ang II formation,
could be detrimental to the vasculature and may play a role
in hypertension, stroke, retinal detachment, myocardial
infarction, heart and kidney failure, renal fibrosis, nephrop-
athy and albuminuria.3,8,9 However, Opie and Seedat10
suggested that low plasma renin might also be one of the
contributing factors to hypertension in sub-Saharan black
populations and ascribed the low renin levels to be envi-
ronmental in origin. The trend toward low renin levels
may also be due to abnormalities such as excessive renal
sodium reabsorption,10­12 reduction in the rate of renin
secretion13 and genetic abnormalities in the RAS or related
genes.10 It seems that not only high renin states but also
low renin hypertension is associated with detrimental
end-organ damage and a worse prognosis compared to
hypertension with normal renin levels.14,15
A novel method of RAS analysis
The biochemical analysis of the RAS represents a major
challenge to analytical procedures, as it is well known that
the quantification of angiotensin peptides is associated
with technical issues. A novel highly sensitive liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)/MS method1
resolved the issue of peptide recovery variations during
sample preparation by using internal standards for each
individual angiotensin metabolite.1 Internal standards are
spiked to each sample before starting extraction proce-
dures and are simultaneously detected in the final readout
using an MS/MS analyzer operated in-line with an ultra-
performance LC unit, which allows highly accurate quan-
tification of angiotensin metabolites in tissue and plasma
samples. The second major obstacle in biochemical evalua-
tion of the RAS in patients is represented by pre-analytical
variations. Angiotensin peptides are components of a
rapidly flowing metabolic pathway characterized by the
ongoing formation and degradation of individual angioten-
sin metabolites in vivo. Standard procedures are aiming
to block all enzymes involved in this metabolism during
blood collection. This is a valid approach if it can be
ensured that the inhibitor cocktail used contains all inhibi-
tors necessary to block all angiotensin-processing enzymes
involved in peptide metabolism, which is not achieved by
using commercially available protease inhibitor tubes,
usually lacking appropriate renin or aminopeptidase inhib-
itors. Beside the qualitative composition of these protease
inhibitor cocktails, the blood collection process itself can
result in artifacts if mixing the inhibitor cocktail with the
blood sample takes too long, which is a critical issue in
animal studies using mice.
We followed a quantitative and qualitative approach
comparing the systemic RAS of hypertensive black and
white African men by using RAS equilibrium analysis.
Equilibrium analysis provides a valid alternative to the
measurement of circulating angiotensin levels and can
be measured in standard Li-heparin or serum samples.
Equilibrium angiotensin profiles are composed of absolute
levels of up to 10 angiotensin metabolites determined in a
single sample and therefore provide an integrated picture
of the activation state and enzymatic properties of the
systemic RAS, which serves as a substrate supply for
RAS enzymes on endothelial surfaces and in tissues.
Methods and materials
Study design and participant selection
This is a sub-study of the South African study regarding the
role of Sex, Age and Ethnicity on Insulin sensitivity and
Cardiovascular function (SAfrEIC) study. This sub-study
involved 23 black (n = 15) and white (n = 8) hypertensive
men aged 39.5­41 years, living in the North West Province
of South Africa. Exclusion criteria for this study were:
previously diagnosed with diabetes (type 1 and 2), heart
disease (bypass surgery, myocardial infarction or angina),
stroke, asthma or any other serious medical conditions or
use of any chronic medication. The inclusion criteria were:
apparently healthy men and the hypertensives included
in this sub-study were newly diagnosed after the study
commenced. Newly diagnosed hypertensives who received
medications that could interfere with the RAS were
excluded in the analysis of this sub-study.
The Ethics Committee of the North-West University,
Potchefstroom campus, approved this study. Before being
recruited, all interested participants were fully informed
about the objectives and procedures of this study. An inter-
preter was available to relay the information to individuals
in their home language. Written informed consent was
obtained from all individuals who decided to participate.
Organizational procedures
Participants reported to the Metabolic Unit facility on the
Potchefstroom campus of the North-West University at
07:00 a.m. All the participants were introduced to the
set-up and after the organizational procedures were
explained to them, they all signed informed consent forms.
Individuals received a participant sheet that guided them
through the different research stations where the various
measurements were performed. During the course of the
morning, basic health and demographic questionnaires
were completed, a fasting blood sample was taken and
anthropometric measurements were performed.Afterwards
blood pressure and pulse wave velocity measurements
van Rooyen et al. 3
were taken with a Finometer and a Complior device. When
all questionnaires and cardiovascular measurements were
completed, each participant received a small financial
compensation for travel purposes, as well as a breakfast.
In the event of an individual being newly identified with
hypertension or diabetes, individuals were referred to their
local clinic, hospital or physician. Participants received a
short report containing their health information.
Biochemical analysis
Serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine
and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) were analyzed with
the Konelab20iTM auto-analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Vantaa, Finland). The serum amino-terminal pro-hormone
B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels were deter-
mined with an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay
(Elecsys 2010, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).
Equilibrium RAS-Fingerprint analysis:
Quantification of angiotensin metabolites in
equilibrated serum
Serum was obtained by centrifugation (2000 g, 4°C, 10
min) and stored at -80°C until shipped for analysis.
Following ex vivo incubation at 37°C for one hour
(pH = 7.4), serum was stabilized and subjected to LC-MS/
MS quantification of equilibrium angiotensin peptide
levels (Attoquant Diagnostics, Vienna, Austria). Briefly,
stable-isotope-labeled internal standards for angiotensin
metabolites (Ang I, Ang 1-9, Ang II, Ang 2-8, Ang 3-8,
Ang 1-7, Ang 1-5, Ang 2-7, Ang 3-7 and Ang 2-10) were
added to the samples at a concentration of 200 pg/ml each.
Following C18-based solid-phase-extraction, participants
underwent LC-MS/MS analysis using a reverse-phase ana-
lytical column (Acquity UPLC® C18, Waters) operating
in line with a XEVO TQ-S triple quadrupole mass spec-
trometer (Waters) in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)
mode. Two different mass transitions were measured per
peptide, and angiotensin concentrations were calculated
by relating endogenous peptide signals to internal standard
signals under consideration of the corresponding response
factors determined by sample specific calibration. A signal-
to-noise ratio of 10 was considered as the quantification
threshold for endogenous peptide signals, resulting in indi-
cated lower levels of quantification.
Equilibrium RAS analysis, which has been used in this
study, does not require any stabilization during sample col-
lection, allowing standardized analysis of clinical samples.
Following separation of serum using standard serum tubes,
samples were frozen and shipped for analysis. Following
rapidly thawing of the serum, the peptide cascade was
allowed to re-establish under controlled pH at 37°C.
Angiotensinogen is present in a vast excess, resulting
in a constant Ang I formation rate that leads to the estab-
lishment of stable equilibrium levels of downstream
angiotensin metabolites, which are readily formed as all
angiotensin metabolizing enzymes are still active in the
sample and present at huge amounts when compared to
the very low concentrations of angiotensins, which are in
the picomolar range. After reaching equilibrium, where the
formation and the degradation rate of each individual pep-
tide are equal, these levels can be rapidly and effectively
stabilized and are further subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis
as described above. The combination of equilibrium analysis
with LC-MS/MS analysis is compatible with frozen hepa-
rin plasma and serum samples and can be used to access the
biochemical state of the RAS at the patient-specific level
without pre-analytical or methodological obstacles.
Anthropometric measurements
Body height was measured using the Invicta Stadiometer
(IP 1465, London, UK). Body mass was measured using
a digital scale (Precision Health Scale, A & D Company,
Japan) in order to calculate the body mass index (BMI).16
The Baecke physical activity questionnaire was employed
to obtain the Total Activity Index of each participant.
Cardiovascular measurements
Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured using the
Complior SP apparatus (Artech Medical, Pantin, France).
The following distance was measured on the left side of
each participant: carotid dorsalis-pedis (from the supraster-
nal notch to the pedalis artery in the foot) distance. The
subtraction method was used--the distance from the
carotid artery to suprasternal notch was subtracted from
the distal measurement. The PWV was measured while the
participant was in a supine position.
A five-minute continuous measurement of cardiovascu-
lar variables using the FinometerTM device (FMS, Finapres
Measurement Systems, Amsterdam, Netherlands)17,18 was
taken and analyzed with the Beatscope 1.1 software pro-
gram. This device computed all cardiovascular variables
and stored the data in computer files. The information was
further integrated to obtain the systolic (SBP) and diastolic
blood pressure (DBP), arterial Windkessel compliance
(Cwk) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) of each
individual.
Statistical analysis
The data were statistically analyzed by making use of the
Statistica 13 software (StatSoft Inc, Tulsa, OK, USA).
Data are presented as mean values or median values with
lower and upper quartiles. Because of the small sample,
non-parametric statistics were used. To compare two
independent sample groups, the Mann-Whitney U Test
was used to determine significance. Probability values of
p < 0.05 were regarded as significant. Spearman rank
order correlations were also determined.

Results
From Table 1 it is evident that the white men were
overweight compared to their black counterparts (30.1 vs.
20.7 kg/m2, p  0.001). No differences were encountered
in the Total Activity Index if black and white participants
are compared. The blood pressures of both groups are in
the hypertensive range (140 mmHg and/or 90 mmHg)
according to the European Society of Hypertension guide-
lines.19 Heart rate (HR) (64 vs. 61 beats/min, p = 0.028)
and TPR (1.33 vs. 1.01 mmHg.s/ml, p = 0.047) were sig-
nificantly higher in the black- compared to the white men,
and the Cwk was significantly lower in the black compared
to the white men (1.38 vs. 2.43 ml/mmHg, p = 0.002). The
c-dPWV was significantly higher in the black men com-
pared to their white counterparts (9.55 vs. 8.16 m/s, p =
0.001). From the equilibrium RAS-Fingerprint (Figure 1),
Ang I and Ang II were significantly lower in the black men
compared to their white counterparts (Median values: Ang
I, <5 vs. 45.1 pg/ml, p = 0.005;Ang II, 15.6 vs. 123.9 pg/ml,
p  0.001).Ang 1-5 andAng 3-8 did not differ significantly,
although these downstream metabolites of Ang II were
detected only in samples from individuals with elevated
RAS activity characterized by Ang II levels ranging in
the upper quartile. There are both in black and white
hypertensive groups detectable levels of Ang 1-5, which is
the downstream metabolite of Ang 1-7 that can be used as
a surrogate for an alternative RAS pathway in the absence
of ACE inhibition. The GGT was significantly higher
in the black compared to the white men (78.9 vs. 41.4 U/l,
p = 0.023). The creatinine clearance was significantly
lower in the black men compared to the white men (1.52
vs. 1.72 ml/min, p = 0.005). The NT-proBNP appeared to
be higher in the black compared to the white hypertensives
although the differences were not significant. Angiotensin
II correlated inversely and borderline significant with
NT-proBNP only in the black hypertensives (see Table 2),
(Spearman R= -0.472, p = 0.076).
Discussion
The aim of this study was to explore the differences in the
RAS of hypertensive black and white men by using a novel
method for determining the effector molecules. The main
finding of this study is the significant lower Ang I and Ang
II encountered in the hypertensive black African men com-
pared to their white counterparts. This result is in accord-
ance with the common notion that black individuals are
more prone to have low renin hypertension10­12 accompa-
nied by a suppressed RAS than white individuals. From the
results of this study it is further shown that the black men
had stiffer blood vessels (higher c-dPWV) than whites,
also reported in the literature;20 lower vascular compliance
and higher TPR compared to their white counterparts.
From the Sympathetic activity and Ambulatory Blood
Pressure in Africans (SABPA) study it is also evident that
in low-renin normotensive black participants a higher TPR
was reported compared to high-renin participants.21 In
the regression model from the mentioned study the TPR
contributed to the albumin-creatinine ratio, a marker of

end-organ damage.21 These findings strengthen the notion
that in individuals with low-renin hypertension an addi-
tional cardiovascular risk may be posed.
In our study the median value of NT-proBNP was
higher in the black compared to the white hypertensive
men although not significant (29.6 (2.5­63.7) vs. 16.4 ng/ml
(10.4­18.5), p = 0.428) due to the large variation in the
data. These elevated NT-proBNP levels reflect higher
volume loading in the hypertensive black men. The
NT-proBNP, which is a hemodynamic marker of volume
loading,22,23 is higher in black compared to white men.24
In our study Ang II correlated borderline with NT-proBNP
only in the black hypertensives. Because of the higher
volume loading and the myogenic phenomenon, it seems

that a physiological protective mechanism is in action
where the resistance to blood flow in arterioles increases in
order to protect the peripheral tissue and capillaries against
edema or rupture25 with the long-term result of higher
blood pressure. From the literature it is also evident that
African Americans exhibit larger systemic vascular resist-
ance compared to white individuals and the peripheral
resistance may play a larger role in regulation of ambula-
tory blood pressure.26 This is confirmed in our study at
least in hypertensive black men because the TPR is signifi-
cantly higher in the black men with suppressed renin and
low Ang II levels compared to the white men.
The findings of this study should be interpreted within
its strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge
it is the first study in which equilibrium RAS-Fingerprint
analysis was employed for simultaneous biochemical
characterization of the RAS peptides in a black and white
population from South Africa and holds promise to under-
stand the RAS better in different ethnic groups as well as
in different pathologic states. The systemic RAS peptides
and the interaction between components provide new
therapeutic targets1,27 for treatment of cardiovascular
diseases like hypertension in this population group. Our
results proved the compatibility of standard collected
serum samples with patient-specific biochemical charac-
terization of endogenous angiotensin metabolism using
LC-MS/MS. We further support previous studies reporting
low-renin hypertension in black African men showing that
equilibrium Ang I and Ang II peptide levels are signifi-
cantly lower in the black population.28 The small sample
size, which is also reflected by the differences in median
and mean values for equilibrium angiotensin peptides
(Table 1, Figure 1), as well as the fact that aldosterone and
sodium intake and/or excretion were not determined, are
limitations of the study. The BMI differences observed in
the two study cohorts might appear to be a confounder
variable of the study. Functional interactions between the
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and obesity
have been established in previous studies and the local
RAAS in adipose tissue has been discussed in terms of its
contribution to hypertension.29 Importantly, the systemic
RAAS, represented by plasma-circulating components,
were clearly shown not to correlate with BMI,30 proving
that the effects observed in our study are not related to
differences in the BMI of investigated cohorts although in
a large study conducted in African Americans published
recently,31 it was shown that visceral adiposity is associ-
ated with components of the RAAS in African Americans.
The observed differences between circulating RAS
components, which are reflected via equilibrium angioten-
sin levels, point to a distinctive molecular regulation of the
RAAS in the two study cohorts. Despite the low number of
patients, the differences observed in equilibrium angioten-
sin levels were highly significant indicating that profound
differences in systemic RAAS biochemistry might be
present. This could affect the efficacy of therapeutic
approaches targeting the RAAS that are currently employed
to treat hypertension in South Africa.
The increased peripheral resistance observed in hyper-
tensive black individuals might take over a dominant role
in control of blood pressure in this study population, which
could have resulted in an underrepresentation of the circu-
lating RAAS in the control of blood pressure.
