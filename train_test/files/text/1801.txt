Background/Objectives: To observe fruit and vegetable consumption as it relates to body mass index (BMI) and other variables,
by analyzing the health surveys of two countries--the United States and France--with traditionally distinct diets, and identifying
factors that may explain the differences.
Subjects/Methods: Two nationally representative surveys that assess food intake via 24-h diet recalls. Respondents include 2126
women and 1911 men from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and 1572 women and 1141 men from
the French Nutrition Barometer Survey. Standard linear regression models and t-tests of both simple and predictive marginal
means were run employing the software package SUDAAN.
Results: Americans appear to consume fruits and vegetables less often than their French counterparts (1.04 vs 1.33 times per
day fruits; 1.98 vs 2.29 times per day vegetables). American men consume fruits and vegetables least often (0.98 times per day
fruits; 1.88 times per day vegetables) than do American women or French men (1.10 vs 1.25 times per day fruits; 2.07 vs 2.18
times per day vegetables). French women consume fruits and vegetables most often (1.41 times per day fruits; 2.41 times per
day vegetables). The French have lower mean BMI than Americans (23.34 vs 28.22 women; 25.20 vs 28.02 men). Regression
analyses showed that age, BMI and educational attainment are strongly associated with frequency of consumption.
Conclusions: These results support our hypothesis that the French tend to eat fruits and vegetables more often than Americans.
This study proves to be an important first step in determining some of the influential factors that may affect various populations'
consumption of fruits and vegetables.

Introduction
The World Cancer Research Fund estimates that up to
30­40% of global cancers could be prevented through a
change in dietary patterns (World Cancer Research Fund,
1997; Holdsworth et al., 2000). Fruits and vegetables contain
many phytochemicals, vitamins and nutrients that are
essential for good overall health. Moreover, studies reveal
that high consumption of these foods may be associated
with lower body mass index (BMI) and a decreased
prevalence of obesity, select forms of cancer and other
chronic diseases (Vecchia, 2004).
Research indicates that individuals who adhere to a
Mediterranean diet consume more fruits and vegetables
than those eating a more conventional Western diet
(Cordain et al., 2005). While a Mediterranean diet is
characterized by an abundance of fruits and vegetables,
legumes, fish, olive oil and other unsaturated fats, as well as
whole-grain foods (Vecchia, 2004; Perrin et al., 2005), the
Western diet is typified by dairy products, refined sugars and
cereals, saturated oils, fatty meats and a low intake of fruits
and vegetables (Cordain et al., 2005). The disparities in
intake may also account for lower rates of diet-related

conditions such as heart disease and diabetes among certain
Mediterranean groups (Irala-Estevez et al., 2000; Vecchia,
2004) and higher rates in countries where a Western diet is
the norm (Cordain et al., 2005).
Though France is one such Mediterranean country where
more healthful eating habits are mainstream (particularly in
the southern regions), a typical French meal can be rich in
fat, especially saturated fats derived from various cured
meats, butter, cheese and pastries (Volatier and Verger,
1999). Still, France is known for its copious year-round
outdoor markets that sell fresh local products, especially
fruits and vegetables (Volatier and Verger, 1999).
France's first national dietary survey (1993­1994),
conducted by l'Association Sucre et Produits Sucre
´s Consom-
mation et Communication, revealed that fruit and vegetable
intake was low, especially with regard to young people, labor
workers and individuals residing in northern parts of the
country (Volatier and Verger, 1999). In an effort to combat this
growing problem, l'Institut National de Pre
´vention et d'E
´duca-
tion pour la Sante
´ (INPES) and le Ministe
`re de la Sante
´ created
a campaign called Programme National Nutrition Sante
´
(PNNS). PNNS' mission is to help improve the overall health
of the French population by stressing energy balance, while
placing particular focus on enhanced dietary habits to include
more fruits and vegetables and less fat and alcohol (Le
Programme National Nutrition Sante
´, 2007). PNNS recom-
mends that the French eat at least five fruits and vegetables
each day (Le Programme National Nutrition Sante
´, 2007).
These recommendations have become critically imperative at a
time when, according to l'Institut National de la Sante
´ et de la
Recherche Me
´dicale, one out of 10 children will be obese by
the age of 10 years. This number has doubled over the past two
decades (Institut National de la Sante
´) and evidence suggests
that 16% of French children are currently overweight (Institut
National de la Sante
´ et de la Recherche Me
´dicale, 2006).
Across the United States, a Western diet is noted as the
standard regimen (Cordain et al., 2005). As of 2005, based on
a 2000-cal intake, the United States Department of Agricul-
ture recommends that the Americans consume nine servings
of fruits and vegetables per day (Office of Disease Prevention
and Health Promotion, 2005). While there is some question
whether this intake can be achieved, studies have shown
that a low intake of fruits and vegetables combined with an
increased intake of calories plays a prominent role in the
high rates of obesity observed in the United States today
(Cutler et al., 2003). According to the National Center for
Health Statistics, 30% of US adults over the age of 20 are now
obese, and 16% of children between the ages of 6 and 19
years are overweight (National Center for Chronic Disease
Prevention and Health Promotion, 2007).
The purpose of this study was to examine adult fruit and
vegetable consumption, as it relates to BMI and other
variables in the United States and France, and to identify
factors that may explain potential differences. This study is
the first international comparison of fruit and vegetable
intake between the two countries.
Materials and methods
Questionnaires
The National Center for Health Statistics: National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey. For the United States, we used
the 2001­2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES), composed of 11 039 individuals, aged 6
months to 85 þ years (National Center for Health Statistics,
2002). NHANES, established in the 1960s, is a series of
reports that evaluates the health and dietary status of adults
and children across the United States. This nationally
representative survey includes both in-person and telephone
interviews, as well as physical examinations. The diet intake
interview portion includes 24-h diet recalls and a food
frequency questionnaire.

Nutrition Barometer Survey
For France, we used the 2002 Nutrition Barometer Survey
(NBS), conducted by INPES, which comprised 3153 indivi-
duals, aged 12­75 years (Baudier et al., 2002). Launched
in 1996, this questionnaire examines change and progres-
sion in behaviors, knowledge and attitudes with regard to
food in the French population. NBS is a nationally
representative telephone survey and includes a single 24-h
diet recall, a dietary history, a food frequency questionnaire
and a 2-week food recall.
Comparable coding
While there were 5575 distinct food choices available for
the NHANES instrument, only 635 individual food choices
were available for the NBS survey. Unlike NHANES, NBS
does not query specific details of each food eaten or serving
sizes. Instead, participants were asked to choose from a list of
foods provided by the interviewer. The NHANES 24-h recall
elicited participant responses for all foods eaten along with
serving sizes, thus allowing for a much larger list of food
codes.
Food codes of explicit interest were identified on both
surveys, while primarily focusing on fruits and vegetables,
and omitting most foods and mixtures deemed not princi-
pally fruit- or vegetable based. It must also be noted that
vegetable sources with poor nutritional value such as French
fries were excluded from both surveys. Accordingly, 322
NHANES food codes were labeled as fruits and 842 food
codes were coded as vegetables; 47 NBS food codes were
labeled as fruits and 71 food codes were coded as vegetables.
Study population and variables
We restricted our analysis to respondents aged 20­74 years
for both surveys because we wanted to look at variables such
as educational attainment and marital status. For the United
States, height and weight were measured by the interviewers,

whereas the French survey relied on self-report. Height
and weight were used to determine BMI, defined as
(weight in kilograms)/(height in meters)2. Additional
variables of interest were gender, age and `day of
intake'. Final study population resulted in 2126 women
and 1911 men for NHANES, and 1572 women and 1141 men
for NBS.
Consumption frequency
For this study, we included a single 24-h diet recall for
both NHANES and NBS. To obtain fruit and vegetable
consumption frequencies, we computed the number of
times an individual mentioned consuming a food, summing
up 24-h diet recall mentions of these foods for each person to
achieve estimated daily frequencies of fruit and vegetable
consumption.
One of the authors (TA-C), a registered dietitian, further
collapsed the collections of selected NHANES and NBS fruit
and vegetable food codes into smaller groups that cogni-
tively corresponded to particular fruit and vegetable items;
for instance, `potato salad' became `potato'.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analysis required the use of the software package
SUDAAN (version 9.1) to properly account for the complex
sampling designs used for both NHANES and NBS. Both
surveys were treated as stratified cluster samples. NHANES
provided stratum and cluster identification, whereas NBS did
not. Thus, it was assumed that the entire NBS sample was
derived from a single stratum; hence, each individual in NBS
was treated as a separate cluster. Both surveys provided
poststratification weights to ensure that the samples repre-
sented the populations from which they were drawn. Due to
differences in the weighting schemes, and because the two
instruments were carried out independently, each survey was
analyzed separately.
We analyzed mean daily consumption frequency in each
survey for fruits, vegetables and their sum (overall, and by
gender). We used two-sample t-tests to determine whether
the mean frequencies differed between subgroups in
the same populations and also to test for differences between
the two countries.
We then examined the estimated distribution of cate-
gorized demographic and other study variables in the two
countries. Since there is evidence that individuals consume
differently on weekends than on weekdays (Baranowski
et al., 2000; Haines et al., 2003), we controlled for the effect
of `day of intake' in subsequent analyses.
Linear regression models were used to determine if
observed variations in the distribution of demographic
covariates (that is, age, marital status and education)
explained part of the noted differences in fruit and/or
vegetable consumption frequency, while controlling for
`day of intake' (weekend/weekday) and BMI (o25, normal
weight; 25­29.9, overweight; X30, obese). Separate
regression models were run for fruit and vegetable consump-
tion frequency as well as the sum.
For each fitted model, an adjusted mean frequency of
consumption was estimated using the method of predictive
margins (Korn and Graubard, 1999) that was obtained
by directly standardizing the predictive means from the
regression model to the estimated joint distribution of
covariates in the analysis.
Results
Demographic and other variables in the target populations
were comparable, as shown in Table 1. The proportion of
women is approximately 50% for both countries and
the mean ages are 42.8 (United States) and 44.6 (France).
The distribution of BMI in the two countries is strikingly
different with 30.92% of the United States with a
BMI X30 kg mÀ2, compared to 8.12% of the French
population. Although the French have lower mean BMI
than the US population, the education distribution is
reversed; 56.87% of the US population has an education
above high school, which is roughly the same percentage of
the French population with an education below high school.
Finally, while not a demographic variable per se, it must be
noted that nearly 65% of NHANES participants' 24-h diet
recall fell on a weekend (Friday, Saturday or Sunday); a
more even split between weekend and weekday was observed
in NBS.
We identified significant differences in consumption
frequency for fruits, vegetables and their combination across
populations and genders. Table 2 illustrates that French
women consumed the most fruits and vegetables (1.41 times
per day fruits; 2.41 times per day vegetables), followed by
French men (1.25 times per day fruits; 2.18 times per day
vegetables) and American women (1.10 times per day fruits;
2.07 times per day vegetables), whereas American men
consumed the least (0.98 times per day fruits; 1.88 times
per day vegetables).
When examining fruit intake solely (data not shown),
number of mentions increased with age in both the US and
French populations and between both the genders. BMI was
a predictor for the US population (Po0.01) only, while
education was highly significant for all four combinations,
with number of mentions rising with level of education.
Number of vegetable mentions also increased with age in US
women and among the French (data not shown). BMI was a
predictor for US women (Po0.05), and education was highly
significant for US women and men.
Finally, the predictive marginal for overall fruit and
vegetable consumption (Table 3) increased with age in both
the US and French populations and between both genders.
BMI was highly significant for US women (Po0.01),
significant for French women and US men (Po0.05) and
not significant for French men. Marital status had a

significant effect for US women and men, and education was
significant for all four combinations. Lastly, `day of intake'
was not significant except for French men.
In general, when controlling for covariates and demo-
graphic subgroups, the predictive marginal of fruit
frequency, vegetable frequency and the sum of both, shows
significant differences between the United States and France,
with the French having significantly higher consumption
frequencies (Po0.05). Exceptions include women and men
in the 70­74 years age bracket and BMI o25 kg/m2 category,
men in the divorced/widowed cluster and both genders in
the above high school level of education group.
Discussion
Numerous studies have examined dietary patterns in the
United States and France separately (Volatier and Verger,
1999; Perrin et al., 2002; Stables et al., 2002; Serdula et al.,
2004). However, not only have few studies endeavored to
compare nutrition-related factors between these two specific
countries (Drewnowski et al., 1996; Rozin et al., 2003), but
also, to our knowledge, none has focused exclusively on fruit
and vegetable consumption. Consequently, little is known
about both common and distinct factors that influence
intake in these two populations.
Our results show a negative association between fruit and
vegetable intake and BMI. There is an unmistakable

difference between the two groups, with the French eating
fruits and vegetables more often and maintaining lower
levels of BMI. Frequency of consumption among the French
seems to be affected by the same factors that impact
American consumption frequency. Unsurprisingly, stark
disparities in intake by gender can be observed in both
countries.
Education, arguably a proxy for income/socioeconomic
status, has been shown to be one of the strongest influences
on fruit and vegetable intake in the United States (Adler and
Newman, 2002; Stables et al., 2002; Gregory-Mercado et al.,
2006). In France, we found this relationship holds true to a
lesser degree. In effect, some purport that one of the most
pressing and shaping determinants of dietary habits is, in
fact, culture (Holdsworth et al., 2000; Perrin et al., 2002).
In France, as in many other nations, food practices are seen
as an important distinctive aspect between diverse popula-
tions and are heavily molded by cultural and societal
influences, which help set apart different groups (Ghadirian
et al., 1995; Holdsworth et al., 2000). These cultural
differences, environment and lifestyle variances often
impact nutrition patterns. This might occur more so in
France, where food appears to be so readily ingrained
in the population's cultural values, identification and pride
(Holdsworth et al., 2000; Perrin et al., 2005). As such, French
citizens may place more emphasis on the experience of
eating (variety, moderation and quality vs quantity), and a
higher priority on food-related ecological factors such as
what they eat, how much they eat and how much time they
spend eating, than their US counterparts (Rozin et al., 2003;
Rozin, 2005). The extent to which these cultural and
environmental imprints are so in either country remains to
be seen, as relatively few epidemiologic studies have yet
to characterize, measure and analyze such issues, owing to a
lack of defined metrics to truly measure culture. It is our
contention that until such metrics are identified, we have, at
best, an incomplete picture of what influences fruit and
vegetable consumption in the United States and France.
Based on our findings, the consumption frequency of
fruits and vegetables of the least formally educated group in
France is comparable to even the most formally educated
group in the United States. This detail, coupled with the
differences in education distribution observed, might lead
one to think that if a more equivalent division were noted,
and if education were as much of a driving force in France as
it appears to be in the United States, overall differences in
intake might be even greater.
Among study limitations, NBS only permitted us to
examine mentions of fruits and vegetables rather than
portion sizes for foods consumed. Although this method is
not ideal, using the frequencies allowed for a general
comparison between the two countries. The NHANES 24-h

recall elicited participant responses for all food eaten, thus
allowing for a much larger list of food codes than observed in
the NBS. Since the US survey had more food codes, it should
have favored higher fruit and vegetable frequencies when
compared to France; however, since the opposite was noted,
we believe this methodological bias did not affect our results.
Another limitation is the cross-sectional design used for both
surveys and the utilization of one 24-h diet recall for
comparison. As a result of this, only a single snapshot in
time comparing fruit and vegetable frequency for each
country is provided.
In addition, a misclassification for overweight and obesity
may exist due to differing methods used to assess height and
weight. For the United States, height and weight were
measured directly by the interviewer, whereas the French
survey relied solely on self-report. Still, measured and self-
reported weights and heights have strong correlations
(Field et al., 2007; McAdams et al., 2007); self-report appears
to be reliable with younger adults (Kuczmarski et al., 2001),
and is a valid measure in epidemiological studies (McAdams
et al., 2007). Since a substantial difference was discerned in
that roughly 31% of the US NHANES sample was found to be
obese compared to only 8% of the NBS French participants,
we believe that the discrepancy is unlikely due to reporting
differences.
As previously noted, the method in which both surveys
was carried out differs. NBS was a telephone survey, while
NHANES used a face-to-face interview approach. It is possible
that characteristics of individuals with telephones might
be dissimilar in France compared to the United States.
Nonetheless, we believe there are very little variations
between the two populations in this respect since 95% of
French households subscribe to a fixed telephone line
(Moreau et al., 2004), which is similar to the United States
(Brogan et al., 2001).
Another limitation is that a large majority of the NHANES
24-h recalls was conducted on a weekend, whereas a more
even split between weekday and weekend was observed for
the NBS interviewees. This could have potentially introduced
a comparability issue in that a fair representation of fruit
and vegetable intake between all days of the week was not
achieved. In order to minimize this concern, we controlled
for `day-of-the-week'.
It is also true that fruit and vegetable consumption
patterns may vary according to season; thus, the effect of
seasonality would be important to explore. Unfortunately,
though the NHANES survey is carried out over the course of
an entire year (and so the 24-h noted are approximately
equally distributed along the year) we do not have access to
geographic locations by calendar time. Likewise, we do not
have seasonality information for the NBS, as the survey is
only carried out from early February to late March.
Finally, we were unable to examine disparities in income
due to a lack of comparability between the two countries.
Nevertheless, we feel this study may be an important first
step in determining some of the influential factors that may
affect various populations' fruit and vegetable consumption
frequency.
In summary, while both groups fall short of their
respective country's minimum fruit and vegetable recom-
mendations, we find that the French consume fruits and
vegetables more frequently than their US counterparts, even
when demographic and BMI differences are taken into
account. Our findings underscore the need for additional
research to verify these results and to investigate those
country-specific underpinnings that could serve to better
understand the disparities found. A variety of factors such as
culture, public health campaigns and initiatives and other
relevant lifestyle factors not considered in this study could
provide further insight. In turn, this knowledge may be
helpful in promoting long-term behavior change through
increased fruit and vegetable intake among populations.
