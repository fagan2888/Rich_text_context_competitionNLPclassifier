Introduction
National elections for a variety of offices are held every 2
years in the United States. Members of the House of
Representatives serve 2-year terms, while Senators serve
6-year terms and the President serves a 4-year term. As such,
every House seat and approximately one third of the Senate
seats are up for election during each election cycle (2-year
period), with presidential elections occurring every other
cycle. Collectively, the Senate and House constitute the two
chambers of Congress, and control of each chamber is deter-
mined by the political party that possesses a majority of the
chamber's seats. Control of the presidency is determined by
whichever party's candidate is elected. There is a great deal
of interest in predicting which party will control which
chambers of Congress and the presidency.
Rigdon, Jacobson, Cho, Sewell, and Rigdon (2009) pro-
posed a Bayesian model to estimate the probability that a
presidential candidate would win each particular state given
the available polling data, and then combined the state-by-
state predictions into an overall probability of a candidate
winning the presidency by using the dynamic programming
algorithm of Kaplan and Barnett (2003). This article dis-
cusses an extension of the original model to handle Senate
and House races. During the 2012 and 2014 elections, the
model was used to make forecasts throughout the election
cycle, with updates occurring when new polling data became
available. All results were made available on the Election
Analytics project website. Results for 2012 can be found at
http://election12.cs.illinois.edu while results for 2014 can be
found at http://electionanalytics.cs.illinois.edu.

election process in the United States and highlights some

Background
In presidential races in the United States, the winner is deter-
mined through votes in the electoral college and not through
a direct popular vote. Electoral votes are allocated to the
states based on the number of senators and representatives
that they have, for a total of 538. Each presidential candidate

Forecasting the 2012 and 2014 Elections
Using Bayesian Prediction and Optimization
Steven E. Rigdon1, Jason J. Sauppe2, and Sheldon H. Jacobson2
Abstract
This article presents a data-driven Bayesian model used to predict the state-by-state winners in the Senate and presidential
elections in 2012 and 2014. The Bayesian model takes into account the proportions of polled subjects who favor each
candidate and the proportion who are undecided, and produces a posterior probability that each candidate will win each
state. From this, a dynamic programming algorithm is used to compute the probability mass functions for the number of
electoral votes that each presidential candidate receives and the number of Senate seats that each party receives. On the
final day before the 2012 election, the model gave a probability of (essentially) one that President Obama would be reelected,
and that the Democrats would retain control of the U.S. Senate. In 2014, the model gave a final probability of .99 that the
Republicans would take control of the Senate.

competes in separate races for each of the states, and the win-
ner of the state typically receives all of the electoral votes of
that state (with the exception of Maine and Nebraska, which
may split their electoral votes). To secure the presidency, a
candidate must win an absolute majority (270 or more) of the
electoral votes. Because of this, predictions for the presi-
dency should use forecasts for the outcomes in each state to
determine the likely electoral vote totals of each of the
candidates.
Within the U.S. Senate, each state has two senators, each
of whom serves a 6-year term. Approximately one third of
the seats in the Senate are up for election every other year,
and the election cycle is set up such that no state ever has
both its seats up at the same time (barring special elections to
handle unexpected vacancies). There are currently 100 sena-
tors, so each election usually involves 33 or 34 seats. Control
of the Senate belongs to the party that holds a simple major-
ity (51 or more) of the seats.
In the U.S. House of Representatives, states receive a
number of representatives in proportion to their population
(as measured during the most recent census), with the total
number of representatives across all states set at 435.
Representatives serve 2-year terms, and thus seats in the
House are up for election every 2 years. As with the Senate,
control is typically defined by having a simple majority of
the seats (218+). For both the House and the Senate, predic-
tions for which party will have control of the chamber should
rely on race-by-race polls to forecast the results of the indi-
vidual races, and then combine these results to forecast the
total number of seats that each party secures.
Election forecasting has received a great deal of scholarly
attention over the years. As new sources of information
become available, researchers continue to hunt for any
insights and trends that can be found. Numerous forecasting
models have been presented that make use of these insights
and the available data in a variety of ways (Brown &
Chappell, 1999; Christensen & Florence, 2008; Linzer,
2013). Some models rely on fundamentals such as economic
indicators, candidates' incumbent status, campaign spend-
ing, and historical trends to predict the outcomes of the cur-
rent election, while other models utilize pre-election polling
data at the national and state levels to construct forecasts.
These two sources of information can also be combined. For
a more detailed review of election forecasting models, see
Linzer (2013).
The Bayesian model of Rigdon et al. (2009) attempts to
estimate the true proportion of voters for each candidate in
each race on election day. These estimates are initially based
on prior election results and are updated using race-specific
polls as they become available throughout the election cycle.
The forecasts provided by the model are perhaps more appro-
priately called snapshots, as they summarize the current state
of knowledge about the likely voter preferences and repre-
sent the outcomes if the election were held on that day. The
focus of this article is to demonstrate how the original model
of Rigdon et al. (2009) can be extended to handle Senate
races, and also to provide a summary of the application of the
model to the 2012 and 2014 elections. All forecasts were
published online and updated throughout the election cycle
at the project website. Many other websites also provided
forecasts for the 2012 and 2014 elections. Among the most
notable are the following:
·
· FiveThirtyEight, run by Silver (2012, 2014);
·
· Princeton Electoral Consortium, run by Wang (2012);
·
· Votamatic, run by Linzer (2012, 2014) and based on
the work of Linzer (2013);

· The Upshot, run by Cox and Katz (2014);

· Election Lab, run by Sides, Elliot, Nelson, and Pezon
(2014).

websites.
The Forecasting Model
Forecasting is divided into two stages: predicting the out-
comes of the individual races, and then using these predic-
tions to determine national outcomes of interest. The former
is described in section "The Bayesian Model" while the latter
is described in section "The Dynamic Programming
Algorithm." The assumptions and limitations of this fore-
casting approach are described in section "Assumptions and
Limitations."
The Bayesian Model
The Bayesian model of Rigdon et al. (2009) utilized polling
data for each of the individual races to predict which candi-
date will win each race. These data came from polls con-
ducted by various organizations throughout the election
cycle, with each poll summarizing the voting preferences of
a sample of individuals from the (potential) voting popula-
tion. Individuals' responses varied depending on the specif-
ics of the race, and Rigdon et al. (2009) considered responses
indicating preferences for the Democrat, the Republican, any
independent or third-party candidate, and undecided in a
presidential poll. These categories are usually reasonable for
the presidential election because very few independent or
third-party candidates are competitive. However, this may
not be the case in Senate races. As such, the model of Rigdon
et al. (2009) needed to be adjusted to allow for more poten-
tial responses in polling data.
Priors and polling data. Polling results can be broadly classi-
fied into k categories, where k depends on the specifics of
Rigdon et al. 3
the race. Categories 1 through k - 2 correspond to com-
petitive candidates in the race (e.g., Democrat, Republican,
leading Independent), category k -1 corresponds to all non-
competitive candidates, and category k corresponds to
undecided. In U.S. national elections, it has typically been
the case that k  5, implying that there are at most three
viable candidates. Generalizing the model to allow for an
arbitrary value of k ensures that it can be applied to a wider
set of elections.
Given a set of k voting categories, let pi , 1 2
  -
i k ,
represent the proportion of voters who intend to vote for can-
didate i on election day, let pk-1 represent the proportion of
voters who intend to vote for any non-competitive candidate,
and let pk represent the proportion of voters who remain
undecided until election day, with pi  0 for 1  i  k and

The parameters bi are chosen to reflect prior beliefs about
the actual values for pi . For the presidential race, Rigdon

For the Senate races, the bi can still be constructed using rules
similar to the above, but it is less clear which previous election
results should be used. Possible choices include the results of
the last general election for any Senate seat in a given state, the
results of the last general election for the seat currently up, or
the results of the last special election in the state for either
Senate seat or for the seat that is currently up. The Senate
model presented here used the results of the last election (gen-
eral or special) for the specific seat that was up. (Thus, in
2012, for Arizona the results of the 2006 general election for
the Senate seat held by Kyl through 2012 were used to con-
struct priors, while the priors for Massachusetts were based on
the results from the 2010 special election between Brown and
Coakley, as Brown's seat was up in 2012.) When an incum-
bent candidate is present, this approach uses the results of the
most recent race in which the candidate was (re-)elected.
Additional historical election results and other race fun-
damentals such as economic indicators can also be used to
construct the prior parameters for the Bayesian model, and
doing so can potentially improve the accuracy of initial fore-
casts. However, the model of Rigdon et al. (2009) relied pri-
marily on polling data, and as such the choice of priors had a
relatively minor impact on the outcomes after polls become
available. Because of this, more complicated schemes for
constructing priors were not considered. Other forecasting
models such as those of Silver (2012) and Linzer (2012)
make more comprehensive use of race fundamentals.
Once the priors for a particular Senate race have been
determined, they are updated using appropriate polling data
as they become available. Polls are assumed to follow
a multinomial distribution, with the random vector
X = X X Xk

viduals in a poll of size n whose voting intentions fall in
each category. The likelihood function for the multino-

Only race-specific polls are used, as they are likely to be
the most reliable indicators of actual voter turnout in a par-
ticular race. Although national polls or polls from other races
could be used to supplement races with infrequent polling
(Linzer, 2013), such an approach was not incorporated here.
The justification for not doing so is because races with infre-
quent polling are (typically) polled infrequently for a reason:
one candidate is very strongly favored over the remaining
candidates (either from initial polling data, historical trends,
4 SAGE Open
or both), and so the outcome is believed to be known.
Evidence for this is presented in Figure 1, which plots the
margin of victory against the number of polls in a state.
Because of the inverse relationship between these two quanti-
ties, using external polls to update races with infrequent poll-
ing is not likely to significantly alter the forecast for that race.
When multiple polls are available for a race, the data are
weighted based on how recently the poll was conducted. If
three or more polls are available within the past 2 weeks,
then polls within the past week have a weighting factor of 1,
polls between 1 and 2 weeks old have a weighting factor of
0.5 (i.e., the sample size is reduced by half while the propor-
tions for each candidate remain constant), and polls older
than 2 weeks have a weighting factor of 0. If two or fewer
polls are available within the most recent 2 weeks, then the
three most recent polls are used, with polls within the past
week having a weighting factor of 1 and polls older than 1
week having a weighting factor of 0.5. If no polls are avail-
able for a race, then only the priors are used.
More sophisticated weighting schemes for polling data
are certainly possible, including a more complicated decay
factor or correcting for house effects (Jackman, 2005; Linzer,
2013; Silver, 2012). Such considerations were neither
included in the original model of Rigdon et al. (2009), nor
were they incorporated into the 2012 or 2014 models.
Extending the model to include these components is a pos-
sible direction for future research.

who fall in each of the voting

The selection of the wi values can be used to represent
different possibilities for the behavior of undecided voters.
Rigdon et al. (2009) considered five different swing scenar-
ios for the 2008 presidential election, with these choices rep-
resenting between 0, 5, and 10 percentage point swings of
undecided voters toward one of the two primary party candi-
dates. All results presented in this article are for a neutral
split of undecided voters, though the 2012 website also
shows forecasts for other scenarios.
When no swing is present (i.e., w w wk
1 2 2
= = = -

) the
region of integration is somewhat simplified because the last
set of inequalities can be replaced by p p
j i
 for
1 2
<= <=
i k - , and i  j. Rigdon et al. (2009) demonstrated
how the integration process works for two competitive can-
didates under the no swing scenario. In this case, a double
integral needs to be computed to determine the probability
that Candidate 1 wins, which occurs when p p
1 2
> . In addi-
tion, the probability that Candidate 2 wins is just one minus
the probability that Candidate 1 wins. The presence of more
than two competitive candidates or a non-uniform undecided
split for the candidates requires the evaluation of three or
more integrals. After computing the appropriate integrals,
this process yields the posterior probability that each candi-
date wins the race given the available polling data.
For the Senate races in 2012 and 2014, no race featured
multiple competitive independent candidates, so at most
three competitive candidates (Democrat, Republican, and
Independent) were needed. The 2012 races with three com-
petitive candidates were Maine, with Dill (D), Summers (R),
and King (I) and Maryland, with Cardin (D), Bongino (R),
and Sobhani (I). In 2014, only the race in Kansas featured
three competitive candidates at any point in time, with Taylor
(D), Roberts (R), and Orman (I). However, Taylor dropped
out in September, resulting in a two-way race once his name
was officially removed from the ballot. To simplify the inte-
gration procedures for these races, it was further assumed
that the trailing candidate would not win, and so only the
potential proportions of voters for the leading two candidates
were compared. This assumption was justified by the polling
data: Initial polls in both Maine and Maryland indicated that
one candidate was clearly leading (polling at or above 50%),
and these candidates maintained their leads through election
day. As such, the Bayesian model consistently predicted with
probability 1.0 that the proportion of votes received by these
leading candidates would exceed the proportion of votes
received by the runners-up. Thus, the probability that the
third-place candidate in the polls would receive more votes
than the leading candidate was safely assumed to be zero.
This assumption allowed the two-candidate model of Rigdon
et al. (2009) to be applied directly to all of the 2012 and 2014
Senate races. However, had the polling data indicated a close
three-way race between the candidates, the general model
would have been required. For the 2012 House races, all
independent candidates were considered non-competitive.
House races were not considered in 2014.
Additional considerations.An additional complication for the
Senate model occurs due to the later primaries for some of
the races. For example, Wisconsin had a Senate seat up in
2012, but its primary elections for that seat were not held
until August 14. Prior to the primary, there were several
Republican candidates (Thompson, Hovde, Neumann, and
Fitzgerald) in the running. Thus, early surveys presented to
Wisconsin voters had two levels. The first level asked
respondents which candidates they preferred within each
party (e.g., Thompson, Hovde, Neumann, or Fitzgerald for
the Republican primary), and the second level asked respon-
dents who they would vote for in hypothetical matchups
between the primary candidates from opposing parties. For
example, Wisconsin voters could be asked who they would
vote for in a race involving Baldwin (the Democrat) and
Thompson, Baldwin and Hovde, Baldwin and Neumann, or
Baldwin and Fitzgerald. Thus, before its primary, Wisconsin
had potentially four sets of polling data that could be used to
predict which party would win the state, based on which
Republican candidate won the primary.
Similar issues occur with presidential polling, except that
typically one candidate emerges from each party as the inevi-
table winner long before the primaries are finished, and often
before major polling gets underway. As such, foregoing pres-
idential forecasting until a fairly clear consensus has devel-
oped on who the candidates will be does not sacrifice much.
The same does not hold for Senate races, however; in some
cases no clear winner is present prior to the primary, and so
it is necessary to wait until the actual votes come in before
being certain which set of polling data should be used. This
is not ideal, particularly because some states have fairly late
primaries (e.g., Wisconsin on August 14, Arizona on August
28). To address this issue in 2012, the model of Rigdon et al.
(2009) was adapted to use polling data from the candidates
who were currently leading (as determined by the Real Clear
Politics, 2012, weighted averages) in their respective prima-
ries at the time of the forecast. For example, if Hovde was the
6 SAGE Open
leading Republican candidate on a specific date, then the
forecasting model would use polling data from a hypotheti-
cal matchup between Baldwin and Hovde, whereas if
Thompson was leading, the Baldwin and Thompson polling
data would be used. For the 2012 elections, the only states
where this issue arose were Wisconsin and Missouri.
In 2014, a more comprehensive solution to this problem
was used. Forecasts were constructed for each primary and
each potential general election matchup based on the avail-
able polls. Each general matchup's probability of occurring
was equal to the probability of both candidates in that
matchup winning their respective primaries. The probability
of a candidate winning the seat was then computed as a
weighted sum of the probability of winning each matchup in
which that candidate participated. Similarly, the probability
of a party winning the seat was computed by summing the
probabilities of all candidates in the party. A hypothetical
example with two Democratic candidates and two Republican
candidates is shown in Figure 2. Once the primaries were
finished, the extraneous matchups were dropped.
Some states use a non-partisan blanket primary in which
all candidates appear on the same primary ballot and the top
two candidates, regardless of political party, advance to the
general election. Additional considerations need to be made
when constructing forecasts for these races. For the 2012
election, both California and Washington had non-partisan
blanket primaries. California's primary was on June 5, prior
to the start of forecasting, with one Democrat (Feinstein)
and one Republican (Emken) advancing to the general elec-
tion. Washington's primary was on August 7, but the out-
come of the primary (Democrat Cantwell and Republican
Baumgartner) was expected prior to that based on initial
polling. Thus, the model did not need to be adjusted to
account for this issue in 2012.
In 2014, a closely related issue was present in Louisiana,
which uses a jungle primary system. Whereas the non-partisan
blanket primary is typically held before the general elec-
tion, Louisiana's jungle primary is held on the day of the
general election. If no candidate in the jungle primary
receives more than 50% of the vote, then a runoff race
between the top two candidates is held on a later date. To
account for this possibility, the model of Rigdon et al.
(2009) was adjusted to compute the probability of a runoff
race occurring as

This requires computing the probability that each candi-
date receives at least 50% of the vote, which can be done by
integrating over the appropriate region. Once this is com-
puted, the probability of a candidate winning the seat is equal
to the probability of that candidate winning the jungle pri-
mary outright plus the probability of that candidate winning
the runoff, weighted by the probability of the runoff actually
occurring. This computation does not take into account
which pair of candidates will advance to the runoff, however.
Instead, only the runoff race with the two leading candidates
from the jungle primary was considered at the second stage.
This assumption was reasonable for 2014, as every race that
could lead to a runoff only featured two competitive

The Dynamic Programming Algorithm
After determining the candidates' probabilities for winning
each of the individual races, these probabilities can be com-
bined to construct a comprehensive forecast. In the case of the
presidential election, this consists of identifying the distribu-
tion of electoral votes that each candidate receives, whereas
in the case of the Senate and House, it consists of identifying
the distribution of seats secured by each of the major parties.
Kaplan and Barnett (2003) developed a dynamic program-
ming algorithm for finding the posterior distribution of elec-
toral votes for each presidential candidate conditioned on all
of the polling data. The algorithm proceeds through all 50
states plus the District of Columbia, and at each stage it cal-
culates the posterior distribution for the accumulated number
of electoral votes for all states through the current stage. After
the last stage, this yields the exact posterior distribution of
electoral votes given the candidates' probabilities of winning
each state. An adaptation of this algorithm for the Senate is
discussed in the following sections.
The Senate algorithm. For the Senate, the goal is to determine
how many seats each party will secure given the candidates'
probabilities in each of the individual Senate races. The com-
putations are completed in stages by considering each Senate
race one by one in alphabetical order. The first stage deter-
mines the probabilities for each of the possible numbers of
seats that the Democratic party (or Republican, or indepen-
dents) could win when considering only the first race (in 2012,
this was Arizona). The only two possibilities are either zero
seats or one seat--either the Democratic party wins the seat
that is up inArizona, or it doesn't. In the second stage, the first
two states with Senate races are considered, after which the
Democratic party could win either zero, one, or two seats. This
proceeds all the way through the last Senate race, at which
point the probability that the Democratic party wins any spe-
cific number of seats when considering all races is obtained.
To formalize this, let qi denote the probability of the
Democratic party winning race i , and let D j k
( , ) represent
the probability of the Democratic party winning exactly j
seats from the first k races. The base case is

Once the probabilities D j k

can be used to determine a variety of useful quantities. For
example, to determine the probability that the Democratic
party holds exactly 51 Senate seats after the 2012 election,
the number of seats held prior to the election (in this case, 30)
is first subtracted to yield the number of seats the Democrats
need to gain as a result of the election (in this case, 21). The
probability of the Democrats winning exactly 21 of the 33
seats that are available in the 2012 elections is D( , )

With the presidential model, it suffices to compute the prob-
abilities of the Democratic candidate (Obama) winning any
specific number of electoral votes, as these probabilities can
be used to compute the probabilities that the Republican can-
didate (Romney) wins any specific number of electoral
votes. This is done by using the fact that the number of elec-
toral votes received by Romney is 538 minus the number of
electoral votes received by Obama, because these two were
the only candidates with non-zero probabilities of winning
any state. However, such a relationship does not hold in the
Senate, or more generally, when there are more than two fac-
tions competing for the units of interest (e.g., electoral votes
or Senate seats). Thus, it is necessary to compute for each
party the probabilities of securing any number of Senate
seats.
There is one additional complication with the Senate
results, namely, that independent candidates, if elected, gen-
erally choose to caucus with one of the two major parties.
This can potentially affect the balance of power in the Senate.
Analyzing the possible effects of independents' caucus
choices can quickly become intractable even for a moderate
number of candidates. Fortunately, for the 2012 elections
there were only two independents who had a non-zero prob-
ability of winning in their respective states, and both inde-
pendents were widely expected to caucus with the Democrats.
Because of this, the likely size of the Democratic caucus
could be determined by applying the dynamic programming
algorithm with the probability of winning each seat set to the
probability of the Democrat winning plus the probability of
the independent winning. This approach was used for all
forecasts for the 2012 and 2014 Senate races.
Senate ties.In a two-party system, a tie in the Senate can
occur if both parties secure 50 seats. The probability of such
an event is equal to the probability that one of the parties
secures exactly 50 seats, because the other party must then
secure the remaining 50 seats. However, when third-party
candidates must be taken into account, the situation becomes
more complicated. For example, a tie could occur with both
major parties securing 50 seats, or with both major parties
securing 49 seats and two seats going to independent candi-
dates, or with both major parties securing 48 seats and four
seats going to independent candidates, and so on. One way to
simplify this is to make assumptions regarding the parties
with which each third-party candidate will caucus, and then
treat those candidates as members of the appropriate party
for the purposes of determining seat totals and probabilities.
As mentioned previously, in the 2012 elections, both third-
party candidates who had a non-zero probability of winning
their respective race were expected to caucus with the Demo-
crats, so this simplifying step could be applied when comput-
ing the probability of a 50­50 Senate seat split between the
coalition of Democrats and independents and the Republi-
cans. Using this procedure in 2012, there was a significant
probability of a tie in the Senate (between .25 and .30) during
the summer (June 26 through September 16), but after Sep-
tember 17 this probability dropped significantly and stayed
below .04 after that. In 2014, the probability of a tie remained
significant throughout the election, though it started to drop
in mid-October and ended at .01 in the final election day
forecast.
Assumptions and Limitations
The primary assumptions made by the model of Rigdon et al.
(2009) are reviewed here. The purpose of presenting these
assumptions is to identify and highlight the model's strengths
and limitations. These assumptions are as follows:
1. The impact of race fundamentals is captured in poll-
ing data, and so these fundamentals are not explicitly
incorporated into the model.
2. Forecasts for races are made using only race-specific
polling data. Infrequently polled races are assumed to
be those whose outcomes are unlikely to change.
3. House effects from pollsters will tend to cancel out
when averaging polls for each race and so adjust-
ments for these effects are not incorporated into the
model.
4. Polls are representative of the actual election turnout.
Any possible biases, systematic errors, or other prob-
lems within the polling data are not taken into
account.
5. Outcomes across races are assumed to be indepen-
dent, with no correlated error in the polls.
If any of these assumptions are incorrect, then the fore-
casts from the model will most likely be misleading or inac-
curate. Other forecasting models relax or remove some of
these assumptions by attempting to compensate for them,
though this adds complexity to the model and has the possi-
bility of introducing additional noise into the forecasts
(Jackman, 2005; Linzer, 2013; Silver, 2012; Wang, 2012). A
comparison of several models for the 2012 and 2014 elec-
tions can be found in the section "Comparisons to Other
Forecasting Sites."
Assumption 4 in particular implies that no uncertainty is
added to the forecasts to account for possible problems with
polls. As such, forecasts tend to be overconfident in the out-
comes of individual races and consequently also in the
national outcomes. Interpreting each forecast as a snapshot
Rigdon et al. 9
of the current state of the election puts the probabilities into
a better perspective, where they can be viewed as estimates
of likely outcomes if the election were held on that day.
Assumption 5 simplifies the process of translating race
forecasts into national forecasts. For example, if Ei (Ei) is the
event that the Democrat wins (loses) race i , thenAssumption 5
guarantees that Pr | Pr | Pr
E E E E E
i j i j i
( ) = ( )= ( ) for races
i and j with i  j. This does not prohibit polls from other
races being used to estimate the probability of the Democrat
winning in a particular race, only that the actual outcomes of
other races do not influence the outcome of that race.
When Assumption 5 is valid, the dynamic programming
algorithm of Kaplan and Barnett (2003) computes the exact
distribution of electoral college votes whereas simulation
methods that use independent coin flips for each race approxi-
mate this distribution. If this assumption is not made, then
some model of dependency between the races is necessary to
estimate probabilities for national outcomes from the individ-
ual races. For example, if simulation is used to approximate
the distribution of electoral college votes for a candidate, then
it would be necessary to know how to update the probability of
the candidate winning race i based on which of the preceding
races he or she had won in that particular iteration.
One reason why Assumption 5 might not hold would be
the presence of correlated errors within the polling data. For
example, polls across all races might overstate the actual
level of support for one candidate, and thus if that candidate
loses in one race, then it becomes more likely that he or she
will lose in the other races as well. However, Assumption 5
is made not so much because it is believed to hold, but rather
because incorporating dependency between the races seems
more likely to introduce noise in the forecasts if it is not
modeled correctly. The fact that Assumption 5 can be used to
considerably simplify the calculations of national outcomes
is an added benefit. Correlated error in the polls can be par-
tially accounted for by the various swing scenarios, which
shift the proportions of undecided voters uniformly across all
races. To update candidates'polled levels of support directly,
the forecasting model could be extended to include a random
variable that represents global bias across all polls. Simulated
draws from the distribution of this random variable could be
used to update the polling data based on the sampled value,
recompute the candidates' probabilities of winning, and then
apply the dynamic programming algorithm to compute the
exact distribution of electoral votes or Senate seats under that
particular realization of the random variable. Repeating this
process many times and averaging the resulting electoral col-
lege distributions would provide one way to potentially
account for the possibility of correlated error within the polls
without having to explicitly model the dependency between
states. An approach such as this appears to have been used by
Silver (2012), though without the dynamic programming
component. Relaxing Assumption 5 within the model of
Rigdon et al. (2009) is a direction for future research.
Forecasts for the 2012 and 2014
Elections
Throughout the 2012 and 2014 elections, polls for the vari-
ous races were monitored through the Real Clear Politics
(2012) website. As new polling data became available, it was
used to update the probabilities of each presidential candi-
date securing a majority of electoral votes and each party
securing a majority of seats in the Senate and House. All
forecasts were made available online (Sauppe, Jacobson, &
Rigdon, 2012, 2014).
Presidential Forecasts
In 2012, the primary presidential candidates were Democrat
Barack Obama, the incumbent running for his second term,
and Republican Mitt Romney, the challenger. The priors for
this election were constructed using the 2008 presidential
election results.
Figure 4 shows a time-series plot of the probabilities of
Obama winning, Romney winning, and a tie. A timeline of
some of the important events in the election campaign are
shown across the top of the graph. The figure indicates that
Obama had a very high probability of winning at every point
during the election, though Romney had a few surges. The
details of the state-by-state results (based on data published
on the morning of election day) are shown in Table A1 in the
appendix. On the day of the election, the model correctly
predicted the outcomes in 50 of the 51 states, missing only
Florida, which had the smallest margin of victory (.007) of
all the states.
Figure 5 shows a probability histogram of the posterior
distribution for the number of electoral votes for Obama on
the morning of November 6, 2012. Electoral vote totals that
would lead to Obama (Romney) winning are shown as blue
(red) bars. The bar at 270 is black, representing the probabil-
ity of a tie. Nearly all of the probability lies on the numbers
greater than or equal to 270, making it virtually certain that
Obama would win. Because there are so few close races, just
four scenarios account for about .77 of the total probability:
·
· 303 electoral votes for Obama, probability of .46,
Obama wins VA, Romney wins FL;
·
· 290 electoral votes for Obama, probability of .17,
Romney wins VA, Romney wins FL;
·
· 332 electoral votes for Obama, probability of .10,
Obama wins VA, Obama wins FL;
·
· 319 electoral votes for Obama, probability of .04,
Romney wins VA, Obama wins FL.
The actual outcome of the election was the third scenario,
with Obama winning 332 electoral votes. The final forecast
gave an expected value of about 304 electoral votes for
Obama.

Senate Forecasts in 2012
The 2012 Senate election involved 21 of the 51 seats held by
the Democrats, 10 of the 47 seats held by Republicans, and
both of the seats held by independents (Lieberman from
Connecticut and Sanders from Vermont, both of whom cau-
cused with the Democrats), for a total of 33 seats. Priors for
each of the seats were based on the last relevant election.
Table A2 in the appendix shows the race-by-race
probabilities for each party on the morning of the election,
along with the winning party. Of the 33 Senate races, the
forecasting model correctly predicted 31 of the winners,
missing only Montana (predicted Democrat/Republican
probabilities of winning were .474 and .526, respectively,
whereas the actual turnout was 48.8% Democrat to 44.7%
Republican) and North Dakota (predicted Democrat/
Republican probabilities of winning were .135 and .865,
respectively, whereas the actual turnout was 50.5% Democrat

to 49.5% Republican). The Democrat Party garnered 23 seats
for a post-election total of 53, the Republican Party garnered
18 for a total of 45, and independents won the remaining two
seats.
Senate Forecasts in 2014
The 2014 Senate election involved 21 of the 53 seats con-
trolled by the Democrats, 15 of the 45 seats controlled by the
Republicans, and neither of the two seats held by indepen-
dents (Sanders from Vermont and King from Maine, both of
whom caucused with the Democrats), for a total of 36 seats.
Table A3 in the appendix shows the race-by-race probabili-
ties for each party on the morning of the election, along with
the winning party. The forecasting model correctly predicted
35 of these races, missing only North Carolina (predicted
Democrat/Republican probabilities of winning were .959
and .041, respectively, whereas the actual turnout was 47.3%
Democrat to 49.0% Republican). The races in Louisiana and
Georgia were both expected to be decided by runoff races,
though this occurred only in Louisiana; in both cases the
eventual winner was correctly identified. The Democrats
won 12 seats while the Republicans won 24, for post-elec-
tion totals of 44 seats and 54 seats, respectively.
House Forecasts in 2012
Every seat in the House was up for election in 2012. Prior to
the election, the Democrats had approximately 190 seats
while the Republicans had approximately 240 seats. (These
totals fluctuated during the run-up to the election due to
vacancies and the appointment of temporary replacements.)
Due to political districting, most of these seats were consid-
ered safe for the party currently holding them.
There were several issues and limitations for the forecasts for
the 2012 House races. First, the construction of priors for the
House races in 2012 was complicated by the redistricting that
occurred after the 2010 census. Because the previous House
elections in 2010 used potentially different districts than those in
2012, it was not always clear how to use election results from
2010 races to estimate priors for the 2012 races. Because of this
difficulty, all House priors were based on a combination of pun-
dits'subjective ratings. Second, many House races were consid-
ered to have a clear winner prior to the election so no polls were

conducted for them. Even for close races, polling data were
typically limited due to the difficulties associated with collect-
ing the data. These two factors meant that the House forecasts
depended heavily on the subjective priors.
House forecasts were posted on the project website from
October of 2012 through election day. On the day of the elec-
tion, the model correctly predicted 408 of the 435 House
races, incorrectly predicted 14 races, and considered 13 races
too close to call (50/50 split between candidates). The elec-
tion day forecast predicted a Republican-controlled House
with the Democrats securing 193 seats and the Republicans
securing 242, whereas the actual election led to 201 seats for
the Democrats and 234 seats for the Republicans. No House
forecasts were made for 2014.
Comparisons With Other Forecasting Sites
Tables 1, 2, and 3 present the election day probabilities of
Democratic victories in the battleground states for the 2012
presidential election, 2012 Senate election, and 2014 Senate
election, respectively, for several forecasting models. The fore-
casts are EA (Election Analytics; Sauppe et al., 2012, 2014),
538(Silver,2012,2014),PEC(PrincetonElectoralConsortium;
Wang, 2012), Votamatic (Linzer, 2012, 2014), and Pollster
(Boice et al., 2012; Bycoffe et al., 2014; Bycoffe et al., 2012).
The Actual column indicates whether or not the Democratic
candidate won the race. Probabilities for EA were taken from
the project website. For all other sites, the 2012 probabilities
were taken from Branwen (2012) while the 2014 probabilities
were taken from the respective websites. All numbers were
rounded to two decimal places. The # Correct row indicates the
number of states where the probabilities favored the eventual
winner. For the presidential election, both 538 and PEC are
given half a point for listing Florida as essentially a toss-up.
Table 4 provides a list of Brier scores for the election day
forecasts of various models computed across all races in the
election. The model of Rigdon et al. (2009) fared worst in the
presidential election, due primarily to the poor prediction in
Florida. For the 2012 Senate election, it performed slightly
better than the model of Silver (2012) by hedging more on
Montana and North Dakota, but it lost to the model of Wang
(2012), which correctly predicted both of those races. In
2014, the model came in third out of seven, losing only to
Linzer (2014) and Sides et al. (2014) due to a higher uncer-
tainty in Kansas and a lower uncertainty in North Carolina.
These results demonstrate that the model of Rigdon et al.
(2009) performed competitively with other models and was
able to produce accurate forecasts in almost all races in 2012
and 2014, missing only four states in the presidential and
Senate elections. Thus, the assumptions discussed in section
"Assumptions and Limitations" did not significantly affect
the quality of the final forecasts. One limitation of this analy-
sis is that these comparisons are for the final election day
forecasts, not forecasts made in the weeks before the elec-
tion. Assessing the model's accuracy throughout the election

cycle and identifying ways in which forecasts can be
improved are left as directions for future research. In addi-
tion, constructing a metric for measuring the costs and
increased model complexity associated with mitigating the
assumptions discussed in the "Assumptions and Limitations"
section will help in identifying whether or not potential
improvements should be made.
Conclusion
This article describes an extension of the Bayesian model of
Rigdon et al. (2009) that allows it to forecast which party
will control a majority of seats in each chamber of Congress.
The model uses race-specific polls to estimate the likelihood
of each candidate winning each individual race in the elec-
tion. These individual race outcomes are then aggregated to
assign probabilities to national outcomes of interest such as
the seat totals for each political party in the U.S. Senate and
House of Representatives.
The model was applied to the 2012 presidential and congres-
sional elections and the 2014 Senate elections. Forecasts were
updated throughout the election cycle and made available
online. The 2012 presidential election was not close at any time,
with Obama's probability of winning exceeding .80 throughout
most of the presidential campaign. On the morning of election
day, the probability that Obama would win the election was esti-
mated to exceed .999. In contrast, the model indicated a close
2012 Senate election until mid-September, at which point
Democratic control was expected with high probability up
through election day. For 2014, the model indicated a close race
through mid-September, after which the Republicans were
increasingly favored to take control of the Senate.
