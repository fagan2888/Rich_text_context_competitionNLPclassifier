Abstract
Objective: Movement dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) is well documented but its cause
remains unclear. This study examined whether motor symptoms are caused by sensory
impairment, executive dysfunction or other factors.
Methods: We examined the integration of tactile and motor programmes using functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in early stage PD patients compared with neurologically normal
controls, to investigate neural mechanisms underlying movement dysfunction.
Results: Twenty-two control participants exhibited activation in an extensive network of cortical
regions involved in tactile­motor integration. Decreased activation in somatosensory and motor
regions during performance of passive tactile and movement tasks was found in 21 PD patients.
The extrastriate visual cortex exhibited greater activation in controls during performance of the
tasks. In contrast, greater activation in bilateral prefrontal regions was found in PD patients.
Conclusions: These results indicate that the extrastriate visual cortex is a multisensory region
playing an important role in sensorimotor integration. The findings suggest that PD patients exhibit
decreased activation in the extrastriate visual cortex, possibly related to dysfunctional integrative
processing, and compensatory activity in the prefrontal cortex.

Introduction
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive
neurological disorder characterized by
tremor, rigidity and slowness of movement;
it is associated with progressive neuronal
loss of the substantia nigra and other brain
structures.1 Movement symptoms involved
in PD may be caused by interference of
motor programme execution, which results
from dysfunctional basal ganglia motor
cortex circuits and abnormalities in periph-
eral afferent inputs or central processing.2,3
The successful execution of a voluntary
movement critically depends on peripheral
sensory feedback. Sensorimotor integration
is the process by which sensory input is
integrated by the central nervous system
(CNS) and then used to assist in motor
programme execution.4 Compared with
neurologically normal people, patients with
PD are more reliant on external sensory
information for motor initiation and
execution, suggesting that impaired pro-
prioception may play a role in PD
symptomatology.5
Abbruzzese and Berardelli5 proposed
that some types of movement disorder are
characterized by a lack of inhibition at
multiple levels of the CNS and by defective
sensorimotor organization.6 In addition, it
has been demonstrated that patients with
PD, especially those with early stage disease,
exhibit severely depressed frontal respon-
siveness to sensory stimuli, as tested with
sensory evoked potentials.7 Forss and
Jousma
¨ ki proposed that the secondary som-
atosensory cortices are also important in
sensorimotor integration.8 An increasing
body of evidence indicates that, compared
with neurologically normal people, in
patients with PD, the supplementary motor
area (SMA) commonly exhibits hypoactiva-
tion, whereas other cortical motor regions
(such as the cerebellum, premotor area
[PMA] and parietal cortex) exhibit hyper-
activation while performing motor tasks.9,10
A fundamental question in motor
research is how motor planning operations
and sensory feedback are implemented in
the human brain.11 Studies have indicated
that several separate sensory systems are
involved in motor planning, including the
haptic, visual and auditory systems.11,12 To
prepare for and accomplish an action suc-
cessfully, information from these systems
must somehow be integrated. For people
with PD, a deficiency may exist in the
sensory­motor integration process,12 and
the prefrontal lobe may constitute the
neural substrate of this dysfunction.13 Lack
of a definite correlation with clinical features
means that it remains unclear whether
abnormalities of sensorimotor integration
play a major role in the development of
akinesia.
We used multitask functional (f) mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI) to investi-
gate which brain regions are involved in the
integration of tactile­motor information,
and to determine whether activity in these
regions differs when patients with early PD
are compared with normal controls.
Patients and methods
Participants
This study was carried out at The First
Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University,
Hangzhou, China between July 2007 and
September 2012. All procedures were
approved by the Institutional Review
Board of Zhejiang University. All partici-
pants gave written informed consent before
taking part in the study.
The diagnosis of early PD was made by
X.Z., an experienced neurologist, based on
medical history, standard physical and
neurological examinations, response to
standard levodopa or dopaminergic ther-
apy, laboratory tests and MRI scans to
exclude other diseases. Patients were exam-
ined only after their medication had been
withdrawn for !15 h. Patients were assessed
504 Journal of International Medical Research 42(2)
using the Unified Parkinson's Disease
Rating Scale,14 the Hoehn and Yahr dis-
ability scale15 and the Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE) while they were off
medication.
Patients with Hoehn and Yahr15 stages 1
or 2 PD were eligible for study inclusion.
These early PD patients, selected by the
neurologist in the outpatient department,
were asked whether they wanted to partici-
pate in this study. After patients signed the
informed consent forms, they had to agree
to routine MRI scanning of brain to rule
out any other abnormal conditions. All
patients were recruited from the First
Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University.
Neurologically normal subjects participated
in this study as controls. All of the healthy
volunteers were from Zhejiang Province,
China, and were recruited over the internet.
They were matched with the patients for age
and sex. Control subjects were aged between
30 and 75 years, had no history of neuro-
logical or psychiatric disorders and were
screened for dementia and depression using
the MMSE before study entry, as well as
undergoing routine MRI scanning of the
brain to exclude any abnormalities. All
participants were right-handed, as assessed
by the Edinburgh handedness inventory.16
Study design
The multitask paradigm included tactile
stimulation, right-hand motor tasks and
tactile­motor integration tasks, described
below. These tasks were presented in the
following order: passive tactile stimulation
task; motor task; integration task. Each task
unit consisted of a 30-s performance period
followed by a 30-s rest (control) period
(Figure 1(a)). There were three epochs,
with a total testing period of 4.5 min and a
5-min control period. The total fMRI time
for 19 blocks was 9.5 min. All participants
were fully trained on how to perform the
tasks before the scanning session. During
practice, errors were recorded and feedback
was provided, to inform participants
whether their finger movements were correct
or incorrect. Training continued until all
participants performed all tasks correctly.
Passive tactile stimulation task
The stimuli in this task consisted of two
commercially available, round wooden
wheels: one had a smooth rim; the other
had a serrated rim. Both wheels were
2.80 cm in diameter and 1.20 cm thick. A
block design paradigm was used in which
tactile stimulation was applied in some
blocks. The duration of blocks was 30 s.
During this stimulation task, an experi-
menter manually applied the two tactile
stimuli (smooth or serrated) by rolling one
of the wheels over the participant's right
index fingerpad. The stimulation was
applied for 2 s per trial, with a 1-s interval,
rolling the wheel in a fixed orientation. The
stimuli were alternated in a pseudorandom
order, i.e. the order of stimuli seems to be
random, but in fact it was set in advance by
the experimenter, with the aim of obtaining
a genuine response. There were 10 trials
within each block and participants were
never allowed to see the stimuli.
Motor task
The procedure for this initiative motor task
was the same as that for the tactile task,
except that a standard finger tapping move-
ment replaced the tactile task. Subjects
tapped their own fingers using the thumb
and index fingers, during simultaneous fix-
ation on visual cues.
Tactile­motor integration task
During the tactile­motor task, an experi-
menter manually applied the wheel stimulus
to the participant's right index fingerpad for
2 s per trial, alternating in a pseudorandom
Zhao et al. 505
order. Participants were instructed to do
nothing if they felt the smooth rim, and to
tap the thumb and index fingers once if they
felt the serrated rim.
fMRI procedure
Participants were scanned using a 1.5T GE
Signa EXCITE MRI scanner (GE
Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) with an
8-channel head coil. Each scanning session
began with a high-resolution T1-weighted
three-dimensional volume acquisition for
anatomical localization (voxel size,
1 Â 1 Â 1 mm3). This was followed by acqui-
sitions of echoplanar T2*-weighted images
with blood oxygenation level-dependent
(BOLD) contrast (echo time, 35 ms; flip
angle, 90). A total of 190 volumes were
acquired per fMRI session. Each volume
contained 22 slices of 5 mm thickness
(matrix size, 64 Â 64 pixels; voxel size,
2.35 Â 2.35 Â 7 mm3).
Participants lay supine in the scanner
with the right arm extended and the right
hand supinated. The arm was comfortably
supported by foam padding, which also
functioned to minimize the transfer of gra-
dient coil vibration to the upper extremity.
Foam blocks, as well as chin and forehead
straps, were used to reduce head movement.
Earplugs were worn to protect the partici-
pant's hearing.

Using the block design paradigm
described above, each functional run con-
tained 19 stimulation blocks, each with a
duration of 30 s. Nine experimental and 10
control blocks were presented in an alter-
nating order (Figure 1(a)). Each stimulation
block contained 10 3-s trials. Thus, there
were 30 trials for each condition per run.
Two conditions were contained in each
scanning session: these were defined as the
`rest' and `task' conditions. Each condition
lasted 30 s and was repeated three times in
each session. In the rest condition, partici-
pants were instructed to relax and focus on
the screen in front of them. When partici-
pants performed tasks they were also
instructed to focus on the screen.
Immediately before each block, participants
were presented with a visual cue with a black
background, on the screen. The sequence
and timing of stimuli were guided by
preprogrammed instructions, displayed to
the participants and experimenter on a
computer screen using E-prime software
(Psychology Software Tools, Sharpsburg,
MD, USA). All stimulus cues were projected
on a screen positioned outside the scanner at
a distance of 2 m from the gantry (Figure
1(b)). Participants viewed the projected
screen via a mirror mounted on the head
coil. During scanning, no feedback was
provided to communicate to participants
whether their finger movements were correct
or incorrect.
Imaging and statistical analyses
The BOLD signal obtained during perform-
ance of tactile, movement and tactile­move-
ment integration trials was compared with
that obtained during the corresponding
period in the control condition. Intergroup
analyses were also conducted.
Image analyses were performed with
SPM2 software (Wellcome Institute of
Cognitive Neurology, London, UK).
Functional images were aligned to the first
image of each session using a rigid-body
transformation procedure. After spatial nor-
malization, images were then transformed
into Talairach space17 and smoothed with a
7-mm full-width at half maximum Gaussian
filter. First- and second-level analyses were
performed. In the first-level, data were
analysed for each participant separately on
a voxel-by-voxel basis using the principles of
the general linear model, extended to allow
the analysis of fMRI data as a time
series.18For within-group analyses, a one-
sample t-test model was used to identify the
brain activity associated with each task
(P < 0.001, without correction for multiple
comparisons), using a cluster size >20 voxels
as a spatial extent threshold. As this step is
dependent on the amplitude of head move-
ments, all data in which the head movement
was over 5 voxels were abandoned, to avoid
the need for corrections that may indeed
give a false activation. This procedure has
been performed by others.19,20
For intergroup comparisons, two-sample
t-tests (P < 0.05, uncorrected) were used to
explore the differences between PD patients
and normal controls during each task.
Locations of activated areas for different
conditions were displayed by superimposing
them on the Montreal Neurological Institute
(MNI) template using SPM2. All
co-ordinates were reported in Talairach
space converted from MNI space, based on
an algorithm (www.mrccbu.cam.ac.uk/ima-
ging/mnispace.html). Specific areas within
the cortex were identified as numbered
Brodmann areas (BA).
In addition, age data were presented as
mean Æ SD.
Results
Participants
Twenty-one right-handed patients with
Hoehn and Yahr stage 1 or 2 PD (11
female, 10 male; age range, 43­81 years,
mean age 60.43 Æ 9.65) were included.
Zhao et al. 507
Twenty-two neurologically normal subjects
(11 female, 11 male; age range 42­75 years,
mean age 59.23 Æ 11.12) also participated in
this study as controls. Baseline demographic
and illness characteristics for the PD group
are shown in Table 1.
Tactile tasks
In the control group, the tactile stimulus was
associated with significantly increased acti-
vation in the bilateral somatosensory cor-
tical areas, in BA 2 on the right and BA 40
on the left, relative to the resting condition
(Table 2, Figure 2a). A number of visual
regions ­ sometimes referred to as the
middle temporal gyrus, V521­23 and the
left occipital lobe (BA 17/18) ­ were also
activated (Table 2). The cerebellum also
exhibited activation increases (Table 2,
Figure 2b).
Intergroup comparisons showed greater
activation in the control subjects compared
with the PD patients in the bilateral som-
atosensory cortex (BA 1/3), parietal lobe
(BA 7/31), left premotor cortex (BA 6), and
right visual cortex (BA 19) (Table 3). In
contrast, less activation was found in
the bilateral frontal lobes (BA 9/10/47)
of control subjects compared with PD
patients (Table 3).

Discussion
Results presented in this paper suggested
that the right dorsal premotor BAs (PMdr),
posterior parietal cortex, cerebellum, left
postcentral gyrus and precentral gyrus com-
prised a sensorimotor integration neural
network in neurologically normal subjects
because they were activated during integra-
tion tasks. These regions could also be part
of the striatal­thalamo­cortical loop, since
this loop includes several parallel circuits,
including the sensorimotor, associative and
limbic circuits.10,24,25 The sensorimotor cir-
cuit projects somatotopically from the pri-
mary sensorimotor area, PMA and SMA to
the putamen, then through the thalamus and
back to these cortical motor areas.26,27
Studies have suggested that the PMd (espe-
cially the PMdr), is involved in integrating
spatial information with motor program-
ming to produce precise sequential move-
ment maps that are necessary to facilitate
complex movements.28,29 In addition, the
posterior parietal cortex is thought to inte-
grate visual, somatic and other information,
and provides a sensory representation of
extrapersonal space.26
In PD patients, the sensorimotor integra-
tion networks probably include the bilateral
middle frontal gyrus (BA 6/10; Table 2), left
middle temporal gyrus/V5 and the right
occipital lobe (BA 18), since they are
activated during integration tasks.
Observations in PD patients, including
reports of excessive reliance on visual infor-
mation during movement tasks, have sug-
gested an abnormality in the sensorimotor
integration process. Some studies reported
that training associations between auditory
or visual cues in PD patients produced
greater improvements than conventional
treatments.30,31 Our present findings sup-
port the notion that visual cues can provide
a supplementary source of information to
improve the efficacy of the visual­motor
pathway, since the right middle frontal gyrus
(BA 6) was activated. Importantly, the left
middle temporal gyrus is involved in move-
ment perception, and the left parietal cortex
is involved in temporospatial movement
control.32 We observed abnormal activation
in the left middle temporal gyrus when PD
patients performed motor tasks.
Our study revealed decreased visual acti-
vation in PD patients during tactile, move-
ment and sensorimotor integration tasks
when compared with controls. Extrastriate
visual regions correspond to right BA 18,
BA 19 and the inferior temporal gyrus (BA
20). Our results also revealed activity in the
bilateral middle temporal gyrus/V5 during
all three tasks in both groups. We hypothe-
size that decreased activity in the visual
cortex may relate to hypokinetic movements
in PD.
The term visual cortex refers to the
primary visual cortex (also known as striate
cortex or V1) and extrastriate visual cortical
areas, including V2, V3, V4 and V5. The
primary visual cortex is anatomically
equivalent to BA 17. A hierarchical rela-
tionship between a primary cortex and sec-
ondary cortices is found in several parts of
the brain, including the sensory, motor and
auditory cortices, which as a whole perform
information processing on a more global
level.33 Several fMRI studies have confirmed
that these multisensory areas are involved in
tactile and movement perception, in normal
subjects.21,34,35
In accordance with such findings, our
results confirmed an activation in extrastri-
ate visual cortical areas during tactile tasks
and, importantly, during movement and
integration tasks in neurologically normal
controls. However, our findings revealed
significantly decreased activity in right BA
18 and BA 19, in patients with early PD
compared with neurologically normal
controls.
The BAs 18 and 19 are involved in the
translation and interpretation of visual
impressions transmitted from BA 17.
Although simple and complex cells are

found in visual association cortex, the region
is predominantly populated by hypercom-
plex (both higher and lower order) neurons,
most of which are involved in the determin-
ation of precise geometric form, as well as
the assimilation of signals transmitted from
the primary cortex.35 In addition to visual
input, neurons in the superior portions of
BA 19 respond to tactile stimuli.36 We
propose that decreased activation at these
loci (BAs 18 and 19) is likely to be involved
in the dysfunction of tactile perception in
PD and may play a role in sensorimotor
integration.
Visual area middle temporal gyrus/V5 is
thought to play a major role in the percep-
tion of motion, the integration of local
motion signals into global percepts and the
guidance of some eye movements.37
Research has demonstrated that neurons in
this area are capable of responding to visual
information, often in a direction-selective
manner, even after V1 has been destroyed or
deactivated.38 Lesion research has con-
firmed the role of the middle temporal
gyrus/V5 in motion perception, with a
neuropsychological report of a patient with
lesions in this area who was unable to
visualize motion, instead seeing the world
in a series of static `frames'39 Our surprising
finding of decreased activity in the middle
temporal gyrus/V5 in PD patients during the
movement task suggests that this region may
play a key role in sensorimotor computation
and movement dysfunction.
The present study has some limitations.
We were unable to get an accurate correl-
ation in the tactile­motor procedure, which
is the aim of our next study. The effect of
medication was minimized as much as pos-
sible, otherwise PD patients would have
been unable to fulfil the tasks due to
tremor. While high-quality images were
needed for this study, PD patients find it
difficult to control their movements. For this
reason, early stage PD patients were
selected. The study began in 2007 and
continued for >5 years due to the difficulty
in recruiting suitable participants. The soft-
ware package we used (SPM2) was current at
the start of the study, but has been updated
in subsequent years. Although the older
version lacked consistency and was less
compatible with toolboxes than later ver-
sions, we believe the results are still credible.
Based on these observations, we propose
that extrastriate visual responses to object
shapes and perception of motion might be
similarly integrated, enhancing the popula-
tion response to sensorimotor stimuli.
Understanding the precise role of this area
in perception and cognition will require
additional research in future.
To conclude, the current results provide
novel insights into the cortical components
of sensorimotor integration that may under-
lie the motor symptoms of PD. In particular,
our findings suggest an important role of
initial sensory input and movement out-
comes related to extrastriate visual cortex
activity. Future work should focus on
elucidating the precise multisensory role of
the extrastriate visual cortex.
