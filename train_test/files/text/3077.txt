ALTHOUGH CARDIOVASCULAR DIS-
ease (CVD) does not manifest
until adulthood, CVD risk fac-
tors, such as elevated blood
pressure, excess weight, and abnormali-
ties in plasma lipoprotein levels, are pres-
ent in childhood1 and persist into adult-
hood.2 Furthermore, CVD risk factors are
associated with the presence of athero-
sclerosis in children and young adults.3-5
Ethnic differences in CVD risk fac-
tors in children are of special impor-
tance because of the premature mortal-
ity from CVD and high levels of CVD risk
factors experienced by adult ethnic mi-
nority populations, most notably Afri-
can American and Mexican American
populations, which constitute the 2 larg-
est minority groups in the United States.
For example, CVD mortality rates for Af-
rican American and white women 45 to
64 years old were 274 and 107 per
100 000, respectively, in 1992. For Af-
rican American and white men, rates
were 511 and 299 per 100 000, respec-
tively.6 In addition to higher CVD mor-
tality rates, African American adults have
higher prevalences of excess weight,
physical inactivity, diabetes, and hyper-
tension than do white adults.7-9 Studies
of CVD mortality among Mexican Ameri-
cans are much less conclusive10; how-
ever, Mexican American adults are more
likely to be overweight and physically in-
active, to have diabetes, and to have
higher levels of untreated and uncon-
trolled hypertension than are white
adults.9,11-13
Past studies of ethnic differences in
CVD risk factors among children have
most commonly focused on school-

Context Knowledge about ethnic differences in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk fac-
tors among children and young adults from national samples is limited.
Objective To evaluate ethnic differences in CVD risk factors, the age at which dif-
ferences were first apparent, and whether differences remained after accounting for
socioeconomic status (SES).
Design Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-1994.
Setting Eighty-nine mobile examination centers.
Participants A total of 2769 black, 2854 Mexican American, and 2063 white (non-
Hispanic) children and young adults aged 6 to 24 years.
Main Outcome Measures Ethnicity and household level of education (SES) in rela-
tion to body mass index (BMI), percentage of energy from dietary fat, cigarette smok-
ing, systolic blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c
), and non­high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (non­HDL-C [the difference between total cholesterol and
HDL-C]).
Results The BMI levels were significantly higher for black and Mexican American
girls than for white girls, with ethnic differences evident by the age of 6 to 9 years (a
difference of approximately 0.5 BMI units) and widening thereafter (a difference of
2 BMI units among 18- to 24-year-olds). Percentages of energy from dietary fat
paralleled these findings and were also significantly higher for black than for white
boys. Blood pressure levels were higher for black girls than for white girls in every age
group, and glycosylated hemoglobin levels were highest for black and Mexican Ameri-
can girls and boys in every age group. In contrast, smoking prevalence was highest
for white girls and boys, especially for those from low-SES homes (77% of young men
and 61% of young women, aged 18-24 years, from low-SES homes were current smok-
ers). All ethnic differences remained significant after accounting for SES and age.
Conclusion These findings show strong ethnic differences in CVD risk factors among
youths of comparable age and SES from a large national sample. The differences high-
light the need for heart disease prevention programs to begin early in childhood and
continue throughout young adulthood to reduce the risk of atherosclerosis.

aged children ranging from 5 to 18 years
of age. These studies suggest that Afri-
can American and Mexican American
children have higher levels of body mass
index (BMI [weight in kilograms di-
vided by the square of height in me-
ters]), physical inactivity, lipoproteins,
insulin, glucose, and blood pressure than
white children, and that these differ-
ences may occur as early as middle child-
hood.1,14-22 Whilethesestudieshavemade
substantial contributions, most are lim-
ited by restricted geographic regions of
study, limited power from small sample
sizes, and nongeneralizable samples. Fur-
thermore, few have controlled for po-
tential confounding from socioeco-
nomic status (SES), a powerful predictor
of CVD.23,24
Although there is some evidence that
childhood SES can affect CVD in adult-
hood,25 to our knowledge, there are no
national studies of children that have
evaluated the impact of both ethnicity
and SES on multiple CVD risk factors.
However, several recent national stud-
ies of adults have found that ethnic dif-
ferences in CVD risk factors remained af-
ter accounting for individual as well as
family-level indicators of SES.9,26 While
adjusting for SES does not fully ac-
count for all of the attributes of socio-
economic position, these studies sug-
gest that biological, behavioral, cultural,
medical, and societal factors may con-
tribute to ethnic variations in CVD risk
factors independently of SES.
In this article we used data from a large
national probability sample of black,
Mexican American, and white (non-
Hispanic) children and young adults. We
examined ethnic differences in CVD risk
factors, the ages at which ethnic differ-
ences were first apparent, and whether
ethnic differences remained after ac-
counting for 2 different measures of SES.
METHODS
The Third National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (NHANES III),
conducted by the National Center for
Health Statistics, was designed to assess
thehealthandnutritionalstatusoftheUS
noninstitutionalized civilian popula-
tion.27 It oversampled black and Mexi-
can American populations and included
a total sample of 33 994 persons, aged 2
months and older.28 The survey was con-
ducted at 89 locations in two 3-year
phases: phase I, 1988 to 1991, and phase
II,1991to1994.Thesurveyusedastrati-
fied, multistage probability cluster sam-
pling, similar to that used by previous
NHANE surveys. Weights indicating the
probabilityofbeingsampledwereassigned
toeachrespondent,enablingresultstorep-
resent the entire US population.
The NHANES III staff conducted sur-
veys in households, administering ques-
tionnaires to families, adults, and chil-
dren. The survey included demographic,
SES, dietary, and health history ques-
tions. All survey instruments were avail-
able in both English and Spanish. Fol-
lowing the survey, standardized medical
examinations were conducted by physi-
cians and health technicians in NHANES
III mobile examination centers.
Our analysis sample includes 7686
black, Mexican American, and white chil-
dren and young adults, 6 to 24 years of
age. We excluded younger children be-
cause of substantial missing data. We also
excluded data for young women who
were pregnant (n = 164) and individu-
als who were not from black, Mexican
American, or white ethnic groups
(n = 385), whose surveys were coded as
unreliable (n = 6) or who completed the
home but not the medical examination
(n = 485). The 485 individuals who com-
pleted only the home questionnaire were
similar to the 7686 individuals who com-
pleted both the home questionnaire and
medical examination for most sociode-
mographic characteristics, including age
(14.9 vs 14.0 mean years, respectively),
education of the head of the household
(11.6 vs 10.9 mean years, respectively),
and country of birth (88% vs 87% born
in the United States, respectively).
Measures
Age was calculated in years from the sub-
ject's reported birthdate. Race or ethnic-
ity was based on asking respondents to
identify themselves as follows: black;
Mexican or Mexican American; white,
non-Hispanic; Asian or Pacific Is-
lander; Aleut, Eskimo, or American In-
dian; or other Latin American or other
Spanish. Respondents who chose 1 of the
first 3 categories are included in our
analyses. The NHANES III collected data
on several indicators of SES. We used
educational attainment of the head of the
household as our primary indicator of
SES because, unlike income and occu-
pation, education had little missing data,
isavailableregardlessofemployment out-
side the home, and is unlikely to be in-
fluenced by CVD-related morbidity.29 We
used poverty-income ratio as our sec-
ondary indicator of SES. The poverty-
income ratio is the ratio of 2 compo-
nents: the numerator is the family income
and the denominator is an assessment of
the income level that is minimally ad-
equate for a family of that size for that
calendar year. Education of the head of
the household and poverty-income ra-
tio were moderately correlated (r = 0.42,
P.001), a finding consistent with pre-
vious research.29
Indicators of CVD Risk
Indicators of CVD risk were as follows:
· Body mass index, a preferred mea-
sure of body fatness for children and ado-
lescents.30
· Percentage of energy from dietary fat,
estimated on the basis of a single 24-
hour dietary recall, administered by a
trained dietary interviewer with a proxy,
if necessary, for children 6 to 11 years
of age.
· Current cigarette smoking status, de-
fined as smoking at least 100 cigarettes
during one's lifetime and currently smok-
ing cigarettes, based on self-report and
not assessed for children younger than
8yearsofage.Serumcotininelevels (74
nmol/L [13 ng/mL]),31 available for
phase I participants, were used to vali-
date smoking status.
· Systolic blood pressure, measured in
millimeters of mercury. The mean of the
second and third of 3 readings, mea-
sured on the right arm using a mercury
sphygmomanometer while the partici-
pant was seated during the medical ex-
amination, is reported. Diastolic blood
pressure is not reported because of sub-
stantially more missing data (12% miss-
ing diastolic vs 4% missing systolic).

· Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c
),
a percentage of total hemoglobin, ana-
lyzed from whole blood in 1 laboratory
(DIAMAT HPLC/Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Columbia, Mo)27 and used as a marker
for the blood glucose concentration dur-
ing the previous 2 to 3 months.32 Gly-
cosylated hemoglobin, the only indica-
tor of diabetic status available for children
in NHANES III, has been related to ath-
erosclerosis in youth and may indicate
a preclinical stage of diabetes.33
· Non­high-density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol (non­HDL-C), measured in mil-
limoles per liter and calculated as the dif-
ference between total cholesterol and
HDL cholesterol.34 Measurements were
taken from serum specimens and ana-
lyzed by standardized protocols. Non­

erogenic lipoprotein particles than indi-
rectly estimated low-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol,34 does not require fasting

*Linear models incorporated sampling weights. Independent variables were age, ethnicity, years of education of head of household, and all first-order interactions between inde-
pendent variables. Regression coefficients are unstandardized. HbA1c
indicates glycosylated hemoglobin; HDL, high-density lipoprotein; and SES, socioeconomic status.
Coefficients for this binary outcome are based on multiple logistic models. To calculate an odds ratio, exponentiate the  coefficient.
White youths coded as the reference group for both black and Mexican American groups.

blood samples, and therefore was avail-
able for the entire NHANES III sample.
Total cholesterol is reported as a second-
ary measure.
Missing data ranged from 1% to 5%
for BMI, percentage of energy from fat,
smoking, and blood pressure, to 10% to
12% for glycosylated hemoglobin and
non­HDL-C levels.
Data Analysis
The data were analyzed using SUDAAN,
version 7.11 (Research Triangle Insti-
tute, Research Triangle Park, NC), a soft-
ware program that adjusts for the com-
plex NHANES III sample design. All
analyses incorporated sampling weights
that adjusted for unequal sampling prob-
abilities. SUDAAN was used to calculate
weighted means, percentages, and SEs;
SAS,version6.12(SASInstituteInc,Cary,
NC) was used to calculate weighted SDs.
We used multiple linear regression
models for continuous outcomes and lo-
gistic regression models for binary out-
comes. The dependent variables in our
models were the 6 CVD risk factors de-
scribed above. The independent vari-
ables were age (in years, centered at the
sample mean to aid in the interpreta-
tion of the regression coefficients); eth-
nicity (black and Mexican American
youth compared separately with white
youth; each comparison used white
youth as the reference group); and years
of education of the head of the house-
hold (continuous and centered at 12
years). We included all first-order inter-
actions between independent variables
(age and ethnicity, age and education,
ethnicity and education). All P values are
2-tailed.
In 2 ancillary analyses, we used the
poverty-income ratio rather than edu-
cational attainment, and total choles-
terol level rather than non­HDL-C level
in the linear models to examine whether
these measures would produce similar
findings.
RESULTS
There were 2769 black, 2854 Mexican
American, and 2063 white children and
young adults for whom data were com-
plete for the home questionnaire and the
medical examination (TABLE 1). There
were substantial numbers in groups at
the extremes of educational attainment
that are commonly underrepresented in
studies of ethnic differences in CVD. For
example, there were large numbers of
white youths from homes with lower lev-
els of education (n = 212 from homes
with 9 years of education; n = 257 from
homes with 10-11 years of education)
and Mexican American youths from
homes with higher levels of education
(n = 401 from homes with 13 years of
education). White youths were the least
likely to live in urban areas, were from
homes having the highest levels of edu-
cation, and were the least likely to live
in poverty. More than 40% of black and
Mexican American youths lived below
the poverty level.
TABLE 2 presents the multivariate re-
sults for the 6 CVD risk factors. The co-
efficients are presented for the black-
white comparisons, the Mexican
American-white comparisons, for SES,
and for age. All interactions with ethnic-
ity that were statistically significant at
P.01 are also presented. After account-

*Means, SDs, and percentages were calculated with normalized sample weights. HbA1c
indicates glycosylated hemoglobin; HDL, high-density lipoprotein.
Non-HDL cholesterol values were highly correlated with NHANES III low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values (r = 0.95) and were, on average, 0.65 mmol/L (25 mg/dL) higher than
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
Data for women, aged 25-34 years, are presented for reference.

to 24-year-olds. For young women who
were aged 18 to 24 years and of average
height in this analysis (162 cm [5 ft,
4 in]), each BMI unit is equivalent to 2.6
kg (5.9 lb). An ethnic difference of 2 BMI
units indicates that black and Mexican
American women who were 162 cm
(5 ft, 4 in) tall were, on average, approxi-
mately 5.4 kg (12 lb) heavier than white
women of the same height.
A similar early onset of ethnic differ-
ences in percentage of energy from fat and
glycosylated hemoglobin level was seen
for black and Mexican American girls. For
systolicbloodpressure,blackgirls,butnot
Mexican American girls, had higher val-
ues than white girls by 6 to 9 years of age
and in every age group thereafter.
Among black and Mexican American
boys, glycosylated hemoglobin levels
were higher than among white boys by
6 to 9 years of age and in every age group
thereafter. A similar pattern was seen for
percentages of energy from fat for black
boys by 10 to 13 years of age.
Ethnic differences in cigarette smok-
ing were evident by 10 to 13 years of age
for both girls and boys. White girls and
boys showed a sharp increase at 14 to
17 years of age, which more than doubled
for girls and more than tripled for boys
at 18 to 24 years of age. Smoking rates
of Mexican American boys kept pace with
white boys through 14 to 17 years of age
and doubled at 18 to 24 years of age.
There was also a dramatic age-related in-
crease in smoking rates among black boys
and black and Mexican American girls
when they reached 18 to 24 years of age,
narrowing the gap with whites.
In general, the ethnic differences in
BMI, percentage of energy from fat, blood
pressure, and glycosylated hemoglobin
level were also apparent in adults, 25 to
34 years of age. Smoking rates in adults
remained low for Mexican American
women and increased for black men.
These comparisons between age groups
offer insight into the progression of eth-
nic differences in CVD risk factors into
adulthood. However, the data are based
on cross-sectional surveys; thus, when
the youth from younger age groups grow
older, they may not show the same risk
factor levels that were observed for youth
from the older age groups in this sample.
The significant interactions noted in
the linear models (Table 2) can be seen
in Tables 3 and 4 and the FIGURE. For
BMI, black girls and boys had steeper in-
creases in BMI levels than white girls and
boys across age groups, resulting in
greater ethnic differences in the older age
groups than the younger age groups (sig-
nificant interaction between black eth-
nicity and age). For smoking, ethnic dif-
ferences were larger at the lower levels
of education than at the higher levels. As
shown in the Figure, white youths, 18
to 24 years old, from families with lower
educational attainment reported sub-
stantially higher smoking rates than black
and Mexican American youths from fami-
lies with similar educational attainment
(77% of young white men and 61% of
young white women were current smok-
ers compared with 35% of minority
youth). With increasing education,
smoking rates decreased sharply and
were similar across ethnic groups.
COMMENT
Thesefindingsareamongthefirsttoshow
higher levels of BMI, energy from di-
etary fat, blood pressure, and glyco-
sylated hemoglobin, and lower rates of
smoking for black and Mexican Ameri-
can youths than white youths of compa-
rable SES and age from a national sample.
The findings are especially important be-
cause they add insight into the course of
development of ethnic differences in CVD
risk factors from childhood to young
adulthood. Because the cardiovascular
health of adults is determined, in part, by
personal behaviors and societal influ-
ences present during childhood and
young adulthood,9,25,35 it is important to
learn when ethnic differences in CVD risk
factors are first apparent so that preven-
tive interventions can be initiated before
unhealthy lifestyles are established.
Ourfindingsareconsistentwithanum-
ber of studies comparing black and white
youth, or Mexican American and white
youth, on BMI,14,17,22,36 dietary in-
take,15,20 blood pressure,17,36 smoking,37
and markers for diabetes.16,18,36 Other
studies have not always found the same
significant ethnic differences in CVD risk
factors; for example, our findings con-
trast with some studies for BMI, blood
pressure, smoking, and lipoprotein lev-
els.1,17,38,39 However, our findings are the
first from a nationally representative
sample of children and young adults,
spanning the entire age range from 6 to
24 years. Some of the differences may be
explained by selection bias in previous
studies, not accounting for SES, or eth-
nic groups that do not overlap sufficiently
in SES distributions to permit valid ad-
justment for SES.
Strengths and Limitations
NHANES III is the most comprehen-
sive national survey with data on CVD
risk factors for children and young adults
in the United States. The survey in-
cludes an oversampling of black and
Mexican American children, the 2 larg-
est groups of ethnic minority children.
Because NHANES I and II did not in-
clude large numbers of Mexican Ameri-
can children and the Hispanic HANES
did not include white children, this is the
first NHANE survey to allow a direct
comparison of Mexican American and
white children. It also includes large
numbers of children in each ethnic group
from households at both the upper and
lower levels of educational attainment.
Extensive data are available from the
home survey and medical examination,
includingstandardizedmeasuresofblood
pressure, lipids, and glycosylated hemo-
globin, and several measures of SES.
Despite these strengths, our results
should be interpreted with caution be-
cause of several design and measure-
ment limitations. First, the cross-
sectional design of NHANES III limits our
ability to draw inferences about devel-
opmental or causal pathways and high-
lights the need for longitudinal studies
to provide more definitive answers to re-
sults from cross-sectional studies. Sec-
ond, our measures of SES may exhibit a
certain degree of residual confounding
with ethnicity, even after adjustment for
educational attainment or poverty level.
It is well-known that the same level of
SES does not confer the same economic
and social benefit to ethnic minority
youth as to white youth.40-42 In a previ-

ous NHANES III analysis, we found that
equal levels of education did not trans-
late into equal levels of income; for ex-
ample, black and Mexican American
women with a high school diploma were
2 to 3 times more likely than white
women of the same educational level to
live in poverty.9 Third, there is the po-
tential for bias from self-reported ques-
tions such as those on smoking and di-
etary fat. We validated self-reported
smoking by examining a biochemical
measure, serum cotinine. Among par-
ticipants who reported being nonsmok-
ers, 5.1%, 2.5%, and 4.7% of black,
Mexican American, and white youths,
and 3.7%, 4.5%, and 3.4% of youths
from homes where the educational level
was less than 12, 12, and more than 12
years, respectively, had positive coti-
nine values, indicating low levels of un-
derreporting of smoking. Although self-
reported measures of dietary intake are
problematic, the 24-hour dietary recall
is considered an appropriate measure for
assessing average population-based di-
etary data.43 Finally, the NHANES III data
lack consistent physical activity ques-
tions for youth. There were 2 questions
about exercising that were asked of youth
8 to 16 years old; neither of these 2 ques-
tions were asked of older youth, who in-
stead were asked about leisure time ac-
tivity. As a result, we did not include
physical activity in our analysis.
Implications
Our findings suggest potential critical pe-
riods during childhood when preven-
tive interventions may be most effec-
tive. Interventions to reduce ethnic
differences in excess weight should start
in early childhood and continue through
adulthood, with particular attention to
black and Mexican American girls.1,44
Special attention should be devoted to
interventions to reduce fat intake20,45 and
increase physical activity.46 The large eth-
nic differences in BMI at early ages are
especially important because excess
weight in children is a risk factor for coro-
nary heart disease morbidity and mor-
tality47,48 and may precipitate early on-
set of other CVD risk factors, including
elevated blood pressure, adverse lipid lev-
els, and type 2 diabetes.35,49 Interven-
tions to prevent type 2 diabetes should
also focus on black and Mexican Ameri-
can girls and boys, as glycosylated he-
moglobin levels were already greater than
those of white girls and boys by 6 to 9
years of age.
The high rates of smoking among
white youth from families with lower
educational levels are alarming (ie, 61%
of young women and 77% of young men
aged 18 to 24 years from these homes
smoked). This group is often over-
looked because data for white youth are
usually presented aggregated across lev-
els of SES, thus masking the greatly el-
evated rates among lower SES youth. The
lower smoking rates among black and
Mexican American youth should not pro-
mote complacency since new evidence
shows dramatic increases in their smok-
ing rates.50 Our finding that lower SES
youth from each ethnic group have
higher smoking rates than their higher
SES counterparts highlights the need to
understand individual and societal fac-
tors that influence lower SES youth to
start and continue to smoke.
Our results suggest that preventive in-
terventions for many CVD risk factors
need to start early in childhood and con-
tinue throughout adolescence and into
adulthood. The ethnic differences we
found in risk factors, including BMI, en-
ergy from dietary fat, cigarette smok-
ing, systolic blood pressure, and glyco-
sylated hemoglobin, evident as early as
6 to 9 years of age, reinforce the need for
early interventions.37 The focus of atten-
tion in youth should be on promoting
population-wide, heart-healthy behav-
iors in both children and their parents
through programs at the family, school,
community, and public policy levels.
Given the increasing diversity of Ameri-
cans, it is critical to tailor programs to
the culture of youths, their group-
specific attitudes, perceptions, expecta-
tions, norms, and values, and to appro-
priate languages and literacy levels.
Finally, it is essential that preventive in-
terventions be placed in a social con-
text because of the countervailing soci-
etal forces that affect heart-healthy
lifestyles.
