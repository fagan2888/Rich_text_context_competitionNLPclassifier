Introduction
Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the world and
post-stroke disability places a heavy burden on our soci-
ety.1 Strong evidence from genetic association studies
indicates that genetic predisposition, in addition to recog-
nized risk factors such as hypertension, smoking, diabetes,
obesity, and advanced age, contributes to the development
of stroke.2 In addition, individuals with a family history of
stroke are more likely to suffer a stroke. Understanding
these genetic influences may lead to better prevention of
and intervention in stroke.
Adiponectin, an adipose tissue-specific plasma pro-
tein, is structurally homologous to collagens VIII and X
and complement factor C1q3 and plays an important
role in regulating energy homeostasis, glucose and lipid
metabolism, and anti-inflammatory responses in the
vascular system.4­6 Low plasma concentrations of adi-
ponectin have been associated with myocardial
infarction7 and ischemic stroke.8 Recent evidence has
implicated the genetic polymorphism of the adiponectin
gene (ADIPOQ) in association with risk of coronary
heart disease and ischemic stroke.9­20 Three single-
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including rs266766
(T is converted to G), rs1501299 (G is converted to T)

Abstract
Background: Previous studies have reported the relation between the adiponectin polymorphisms and the risk of
ischemic stroke. However, the findings is inclusive. In the present study, we performed a meta-analysis to clarify the
relation between the adiponectin polymorphisms and the stroke.
Methods: Relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Wiley
Online Library, Wanfang database in China, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases (CNKI) through
July 2013 and other method such as reviewing the reference of retrieved literatures. We selected literatures that reported
Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the relation between the ischemic stroke and the adiponectin
genetic polymorphisms. With 1720 stroke cases and 5549 controls, were included. Our results showed that rs2241766
was associated with the risk of ischemic stroke in a recessive model (GG vs (TT+TG), OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.01­1.64, p
= 0.04). However, rs1501299 and rs266729 were not found to be associated with ischemic stroke in our analysis.
Conclusion: The present study suggested that rs2241766 polymorphism of adiponectin gene was associated with the
risk for ischemic stroke.

and rs266729 (C is converted to G) were focused on in
these studies. However, the conclusions of these studies
were inconsistent. Leu et al.18 did not find any associa-
tion between ADIPOQ polymorphisms and ischemic
stroke. But Liu et al.19 found a positive association of
ADIPOQ polymorphisms with ischemic stroke. In their
studies, compared with CC genotype, GG genotype of
rs266729 increased the risk of ischemic stroke in a
Chinese Han population (odds ratio (OR) = 2.062, 95%
confidence interval (CI) = 1.145­3.715, p = 0.016).
After adjustment for potential risk factors by multivari-
ate logistic analysis, rs266729 remained in positive cor-
relation with ischemic stroke (OR = 2.165; 95% CI =
1.116­4.197, p = 0.022). Also, Arregui et al.'s findings11
suggest that rs2943634 of ADIPOQ is associated with
ischemic stroke risk and with plasma levels of high-
density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and adiponectin
in this German population.
Since the relatively small sample size of a single study
may not have enough power to detect slight effects of
ADIPOQ on stroke, meta-analysis may provide more cred-
ible evidence by systematically summarizing existing
data. In this study, we have extensively reviewed the litera-
ture and performed a meta-analysis based on all eligible
case-control published data to evaluate the association
between ADIPOQ genetic polymorphisms and stroke
susceptibility.
Materials and methods
Literature search and selection
We carried out a publication search in PubMed,
EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Wiley
Online Library, Wanfang database in China, and Chinese
National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases
with the following search terms: ("ADIPOQ" or "adi-
ponectin") and ("stroke" or "brain infarction" or "cere-
brovascular disease") and ("SNP" or "polymorphism" or
"mutation") by two independent investigators.
Publication language was not restricted in our search.
Abstracts, reviews or editorials were not included. The
references of all identified publications were searched
for any additional studies, and the related articles option
was used to search for further potentially relevant arti-
cles. The following criteria have to be meet by the
included studies. 1)the study must be case-control study;
2) the ischemic stroke diagnosis must confirmed by
computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI); 3) reported the relation between
ADIPOQ polymorphism and ischemic stroke and 4) suf-
ficient data for examining an OR and 95%CI. If a study
in line with 1) patients were under 18 years of age, or 2)
original genotype data were not provided must be
excluded from the meta-analysis.
Data extraction
The data extraction was performed by two independent
investigators (DZS and SLX). The first author's last name,
the publication year, country, the genotype data of cases
and controls, and the methods for genotyping for each
study were collected.
Statistical analysis
We recalculated the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)
by 2 test. The OR value of each polymorphism and its
95%CI were calculated to measure the strength of the
genetic association. Meta-analysis was performed by
using RevMan 5.0 software provided by the Cochrane
Collaboration. We directly used Q-test and I2 test to exam-
ine the heterogeneity between each study. By heterogene-
ity test, if p > 0.05, we select the fixed-effects model, and
if p < 0.05, we selected the random-effects model to merge
OR. Analysis of sensitivity includes the difference of
point estimation and CIs of the combined effects value at
a different model, to observe whether it changes the result.
To test the publication bias, we used the RevMan 5.0 sta-
tistical software to make the funnel plot. Each SNP was
tested for associations with stroke susceptibility based on
different genetic models. To contrast the wild-type
homozygote, we first estimated the risk of the rare allele
homozygote and heterozygous genotypes on stroke, then
evaluated the risk of stroke under a dominant model and a
recessive model. The statistical significance of the pooled
OR was determined with the Z test, and a p value of <0.05
was considered significant.
Results
Literature search
As shown in Figure 1, 213 literatures were searched firstly. Of
these, we excluded 198 studies for significant irrelevance to
our study aim. We reviewed the full texts of fifteen studies and
further excluded 8 literatures because of overlapping cases or
their data were not extractable or having no control popula-
tion. Finally, a total of seven articles met the criteria and were
included the present meta-analysis.16,18,19,21­24
Study characteristics
As shown in Table 1, we summarized the characteristics of
included studies. These eight included studies were pub-
lished between 2005 and 2011 involving 7269 subjects
(1720 of stroke patients and 5549 of control individuals).
There were seven studies of Asian descendants and one
study of European descendants. In all of these eight studies,
a classic polymerase chain reaction assay were carried out.
The genotype distributions in each study were in agreement
with HWE.

Meta-analysis
The association between ADIPOQ polymorphisms and
susceptibility to stroke was analyzed in eight independent
studies with 1720 ischemic stroke cases and 5549 control
subjects. Results of the meta-analysis are shown in Figures
2­4. Q-test in all of the genetic models showed no signifi-
cant heterogeneity. Therefore, fixed-effects model was
used to analysis the association. As shown in Figure 2,
rs2241766 was associated with the risk of stroke in a reces-
sive model (GG vs (TT+TG), OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.01­
1.64, p = 0.04) (Figure 2(b)). We did not find any
association between rs2241766 and stroke in a dominant
model (TT vs (TG+GG), OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.77­1.07, p
= 0.23) (Figure 2(a)), an additive model (GG vs TT, OR =
0.76, 95% CI: 0.54­1.08, p = 0.12) ( Figure 2(c)), and
another model (TG vs TT, OR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.79­1.11,
p = 0.43) ( Figure 2(d)).
As shown in Figures 3 and 4, we did not find any asso-
ciation between rs1501299 or rs266729 and susceptibility
to stroke in any of the genetic models. For rs1501299, GG
vs (GT+TT), OR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.76­1.13, p = 0.45; TT
vs (TG+GG), OR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.65­1.14, p = 0.30; TT
vs GG, OR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.60­1.23, p = 0.40; TG vs
GG, OR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.76­1.16, p = 0.57.
For rs266729, CC vs (CG+GG), OR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.80­
1.05, p = 0.19; GG vs (CG+CC), OR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.69­
1.03, p = 0.10; GG vs CC; OR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.65­1.10,
p = 0.21; GC vs CC, OR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.80­1.07, p = 0.29.
Test of heterogeneity and sensitivity
No heterogeneity between studies was observed in our
analyses (p > 0.05, I2 = 0%). For the sensitivity analysis,
we deleted one single study from the overall pooled analy-
sis each time to check the influence of the removed data set
to the overall ORs. The pooled ORs and 95% CIs were not
significantly altered when any part of the study was omit-
ted, which indicated that any single study had little impact
on the overall ORs.
Publication bias
Funnel plot and Egger's test were performed to assess the
publication bias of the literature. Symmetrical funnel plots
were obtained in the SNPs tested in all of the models.
Egger's test further confirmed the absence of publication
bias in this meta-analysis (p > 0.05) (Figure 5).
Discussion
In this meta-analysis, an association between the three
common SNPs in ADIPOQ (rs2241766, rs1501299 and
rs266729) and ischemic stroke risk was evaluated by the
pooled results from eight published studies. The results
demonstrated that rs2241766 was associated with an
increased risk for developing ischemic stroke, and that
rs1501299 and rs266729 were not observed to be associ-
ated with stroke.

This is the first meta-analysis to evaluate the associa-
tion of ADIPOQ genetic polymorphisms with ischemic
stroke. Although several previous studies focusing on the
relation between ADIPOQ polymorphism and ischemic
stroke did not come to same conclusion, the present study
clarified this association.
Adiponectin is also called GBP-28, apM1, ADIPOQ
and Acrp30.25 It was identified as an adipocytokine, a

diseases. Furthermore, low levels of plasma adiponectin
have been linked to ischemic cerebrovascular disease
(CVD).7,8 And a recently published paper suggested the
genetic polymorphisms of ADIPOQ were associated with
ischemic stroke.9­24 In this meta-analysis, a total of eight
case-control studies were analyzed to provide a comprehen-
sive assessment of the association between ADIPOQ poly-
morphisms and ischemic stroke. Genotypes in all studies
were detected with genetic DNAfrom blood samples using a
total of three genotyping methods.All of the studies checked
genotypes for quality control. Genotype distribution of con-
trols in all studies was consistent with HWE. By the meta-
analysis, our results did support a genetic association
between rs2241766 and susceptibility to ischemic stroke.
Exploring heterogeneity is one of the important goals of
meta-analysis. In the present study no significant heteroge-
neity was found among the included studies. Sensitivity
analysis also showed that omission of any single study did
not have a significant impact on the combined ORs.
Furthermore, funnel plot did not reflect obvious asymme-
try, and Egger's test further indicated no considerable pub-
lication bias in this meta-analysis. This made the results of
this meta-study more reliable to some extent.
Be that as it may, there remained some limitations in
this meta-analysis. In the studies included, the genotyping
methods used were not the same. In addition, other clinical
factors such as age, sex and different chemotherapies in
each study might lead to bias. Determining whether these
factors influence the results of this meta-analysis would
need further investigation.
Conclusion
Our study suggested that SNP rs2241766 in the ADIPOQ
gene was associated with a significantly increased risk
of ischemic stroke. Larger well-designed
