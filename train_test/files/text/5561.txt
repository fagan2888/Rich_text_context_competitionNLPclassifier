The social media image

Abstract
How do the organization and presentation of large-scale social media images recondition the process by which visual
knowledge, value, and meaning are made in contemporary conditions? Analyzing fundamental elements in the changing
syntax of existing visual software ontology--the ways current social media platforms and aggregators organize and
categorize social media images--this article relates how visual materials created within social media platforms manifest
distinct modes of knowledge production and acquisition. First, I analyze the structure of social media images within data
streams as opposed to previous information organization in a structured database. While the database has no pre-
defined notions of time and thus challenges traditional linear forms, the data stream re-emphasizes the linearity of a
particular data sequence and activates a set of new relations to contemporary temporalities. Next, I show how these
visual arrangements and temporal principles are manifested and discussed in three artworks: ``Untitled'' (Perfect Lovers) by
Felix Gonzalez-Torres (1991), The Clock by Christian Marclay (2011), and Last Clock by Jussi A
¨ ngesleva
¨ and Ross Cooper
(2002). By emphasizing the technical and poetic ways in which social media situate the present as a ``thick'' historical unit
that embodies multiple and synchronous temporalities, this article illuminates some of the conditions, challenges, and
tensions between former visual structures and current ones, and unfolds the cultural significations of contemporary big
visual data.

Introduction
After the digital image of the 1990s, and the networked
image (digital images on the Web) of the 2000s, we now
have the social media image as the new dominant cul-
tural visual form of the 2010s. In its ever-increasing
scales of production across wide geographic zones
and temporal scopes, the social media image--pro-
duced, manipulated, shared, and organized via social
media streams--manifests distinct modes of socio-cul-
tural expression.1 Are these images different in kind
from earlier images? What are the ways in which they
offer to shape our experience of ourselves and of the
world today? How do these images allow us to know
the world differently, and how is this knowing different
in kind from earlier kinds of understanding?
This article discusses the ways in which
contemporary large-scale visual materials created
within social media platforms suggest changing prac-
tices of knowledge production and acquisition.
Analyzing core elements in the changing syntax of
existing visual software ontology--the ways current
social media platforms and aggregators organize and
categorize social media visual materials--I trace the
levels in which the social media image offers new experi-
ences, conceptions, and interactions in regard to con-
temporary cultural productions.2 Doing so requires us
to redefine the dynamic processes by which visual
knowledge, value, and meaning are made in contem-
porary conditions.
I start by analyzing the organization of visual mater-
ials within the social media data stream--a continuous
presentation of multiple information units from many

users, places, and times. Contrary to a database struc-
ture that has no predefined notions of time, and conse-
quently does not favor the temporal and linear
organization of data objects, the data stream presents
the temporal element as its core organizational and
communicational factor. Using examples from existing
social media platforms and aggregators, I show how the
data stream re-conceptualizes a new understanding of
time and thus suggests a new experiential mode of con-
temporary history.
Finally, I analyze how these new temporal arrange-
ments are manifested and discussed in three artworks:
``Untitled'' (Perfect Lovers) by Felix Gonzalez-Torres
(1991), The Clock by Christian Marclay (2011), and
Last Clock by Jussi A
¨ ngesleva
¨ and Ross Cooper
(2002). As I argue, the works situate the contemporary
image within a new ``order of stream time'' and poet-
ically reflect on the experience and symbolic signifi-
cances of this particular time.
From database to data stream
What are the material conditions (i.e. structure, imple-
mentation, organization) by which the social media
image emerges or can be defined today? What are the
representational implications of these material condi-
tions? These questions draw upon a long research trad-
ition devoted to trace the ways in which knowledge and
meaning productions are structured by representational
forms--ranging from the study of esthetic properties as
symbolic forms (Panofsky, 1991), to the analysis of his-
torical literacy (Goody, 1977; Ong, 1982), to more
recent efforts by software and algorithmic studies
(Beer, 2009; Fuller, 2008; Manovich, 2013). While dif-
ferent forms of materiality have been considered from
this perspective, they all explore the particular shapes of
information; how these forms influence our experience
of it; the types of analyses and interpretations it sup-
ports; and how it reflects particular values and hierar-
chies of particular times and places (Dourish and
Mazmanian, 2013).
The materiality of information that concerns me
here are the ways in which visual information within
social media platforms is structured, processed, and
presented, and the consequences of these forms for
the ways we understand and experience these images.
Specifically, I situate the social media image within a
new order of time and elaborate on the experience,
meaning, and analyses of this particular time.
To illustrate this point, I focus on the organization
and presentation of visual materials within the social
media data stream, contrary to information arrange-
ments in a structured database. While the database des-
ignates a rather stable organization of data objects,
recent online developments signal a paradigm shift
toward the transient data stream (Berry, 2011a,
2011b; Borthwick, 2009; Manovich, 2012). As opposed
to the database, where updates and queries are made
infrequently (and thus used to define the static ``desti-
nation web'' [Berry, 2011a: 142]), the stream is a
dynamic, continuous flow of items that keeps updating
according to new data that arrives from multiple, time-
varying sources.
The data stream has been in use since the beginning
of the 2000s in an increasing number of applications
that require real-time processing of continuous data
flows from geographically distributed sources
(Aggarwal, 2007; Babcock et al., 2002; Della Valle
et al., 2009; Cugola and Margara, 2011). While exam-
ples of such applications come from diverse
fields--financial applications, network monitoring,
security, sensor networks, and others--it is the incorp-
oration of the stream as the core mechanism in social
media platforms that has transformed former everyday
communication patterns and structured new social
experiences. Examples such as Twitter, Facebook,
Instagram, or Newsfeed represent a new class of com-
munication technologies, all structured as streams of
information (status messages, images, videos, and
links) contributed by many users from many places
(Naaman et al., 2010).
As apposed to previous mechanisms that work on
opening and closing server connections, and pulling in
information on request, this new type of data process-
ing performs a continuous query for new data units
that arrive in the database and pushes the result into
the stream according to the filter being used. The result
is thus a persistent, real-time connection between a
server and a user (Marz, 2011). These data units
appear to us from the current time backward and are
restricted to the recent now, as older objects quickly
disappear from the stream and are available only by
searching the application database. What we have
here is a continuous, rapid presentation of multiple
data units from many users, places, and times--all
appear to us almost at the same, synchronous, time.
What is most important to understand is that while
the database stores sets of relatively static recodes with
no pre-defined notions of time (objects or data values
are not necessarily organized by the time of creation or
uploaded to the database unless time indications are
explicitly added), the data stream is a continuous
sequence of items that are organized by their arrival
time or by a time stamp that is associated with an
object (Golab and Ozsu, 2003). In this way, if the data-
base suppressed traditional linear forms (as it has no
pre-defined notions of time), and marked an informa-
tional ontology that formed a new way to structure our
contemporary experience in and of the world
(Manovich, 1999: 81), the data stream seems to
2 Big Data & Society
emphasize once again the linearity of a particular data
sequence, and thus re-conceptualize new types of con-
temporary knowledge formations and acquisitions.
What type of linearity is it, and how does it manifest
itself in regard to visual materials in the social media
data stream? How does the organization of images in
the stream structure our understanding of social visual
data today? Put differently, if the stream brings back
the temporal element as its core organizational and
communicational factor, what type of collective rela-
tionship with time does it suggest? How does the
presentation of the stream construct our understanding
of this collective time, and how does this time differ
from earlier times encapsulated in former data
presentations?
It might be useful to think about the near-simulta-
neous real-time structure of the data flow within the
stream in terms of what historian Franc
¸ ois Hartog
has called ``presentism'': a ``regime of historicity'' (or
a temporal order) in which the present has become the
most crucial ordering mechanism of contemporary
society (Hartog, 2003). In this new temporal
regime--formulated by others as timeless (Castells,
2000), or atemporal time (Sterling, 2010)--the ``experi-
ence'' of the present is one of enervating depthlessness
that traps us in an omnipresent present, a withdrawal
into the present as an absolute value that absorbs the
past and the future and eliminates them. Such a regime
signals a disconnection from past historical concep-
tions--such as the modern order of time, which was
marked by the idea of progress and a continuous orien-
tation toward the future--and undermines the mere
possibility of history (Ross, 2006).
How might this work if applied to the structural
logic and presentation of the stream? While the
stream seems to take part in Hartog's ``presentism,''
as it is in real-time and continuous updates of recent
``presents'' appear to us almost at the same time, it also
diverges from it by offering a particular form of pres-
entism. As the data stream is a multiplicity of coexisting
temporalities or ``worldviews'' from many people and
places, the experience of viewing the stream is a con-
tinuous comparison of temporal representations: a com-
parison of the present time experienced by an individual
launching the application to all other presences
expressed by other individuals in the same feed, all
posting images in temporal proximity to each other.
The effect of this comparison is the resynchroniza-
tion of our own living bodies' temporality with the
temporalities of others, fusing all together in order to
make them ``one.'' This does not mean, however, a lack
of time, or an ``atemporal'' or ``timeless'' state in which
we are all at the same time together. Rather, it is a
condition in which time becomes times, a performance
of the contemporary flow of synched and meshed times
and the relations between them. In this condition of
time, the past, present, and future are constructed in
a relationship that is not about the passage of time (as
in former modern organizational forms such as the
film), but about being at the same time with other
users (viewing the stream as it updates), being after
users' time (browsing past events), or being before
users' time (experiencing an event before it is uploaded
to the stream by other people).
In other words, contrary to Hartog's view of pre-
sentism as disconnected from the past and the future
the stream actually facilitates their conditions of possi-
bility. The stream enables the present of the viewer/user
to break down into the past and the future times of
other users. It creates a montage of ``temporal dialect-
ical images'' that coincide with one another (``close''
times), or completely incommensurable times (``differ-
ent'' times). By so doing, the stream activates a set of
co-occurring temporal relations (before/after/at the
same time) and thus brings the past, present, and
future of many users closer together as a simultaneous
duration of multiple temporalities.
These new temporal relations are best understood in
their historical context. As famously discussed by
Walter Benjamin, the modern experience of temporality
is one of a ``homogenous empty time,'' in which time is
conceived as the uniform, ``empty'' units represented by
the calendar and the clock (Benjamin, 1968: 261). As
this idea was later developed by Benedict Anderson,
this understanding of time encompassed a new experi-
ence of simultaneity, in which unrelated people can feel
themselves unified and together by occupying the same
homogeneous temporal moment (according to
Anderson, this understanding of time was mostly
derived from the 19th century mass circulation of
daily newspapers, through which thousands of people
shared the same experiences by reading the daily news).
In other words, this new sense of simultaneity enabled
us to imagine ourselves as members of the same socio-
logical reality, in which all co-occur at the same, homo-
geneous, time-space (Anderson, 1991: 22­36).
Benjamin borrowed the idea of homogeneous empty
time from Henri Bergson, who argued that while tem-
porality actually consists of heterogeneous moments of
duration that permeate one another, our mental appar-
atus reconfigures time as homogeneous by laying it out
in a unified spatial sequence (Bergson, 1910: 237). In
this way, as explained by Mitchell (2000), modernity
can be characterized as a ``form of temporality'' with
a homogeneous spatial expression, in which we are all
the same empty, imagined, time-space. The result of
this simultaneity was what made it possible to construct
the idea of historical time: history is the story of a civ-
ilization, culture, or people whose distinct and detached
lives are reimagined and reassembled into one unit in
Hochman 3
order to create a sense of progress from one simultan-
eous moment to another (pp. 14­15).
When this becomes clear, it is easier to understand
how the data stream activates a new contemporary
form of temporality. If the modern conception of
time, epitomized by printing technologies, was an
experience of homogeneous empty times that rests on
giving temporality a unified spatial expression (the spa-
tialization of time), and the postmodern, emblemed by
the structure of the database, undermined and rejected
this time (the annihilation, distraction, and death of
time), the stream mechanism can be thought of as the
temporalization of space, giving spatiality a fragmented
temporal expression (the expansion of time).
As time is viewed from many places, and space is
viewed from many different yet close times, the
stream thickens contemporary views of time and
space into a parallel display of multiple temporalities
from various spatialities. These extensions of time and
place, however, do not unfold as expanded presents in
which the visual flow constitutes a continuous or dis-
continuous chronology. Rather, the informational
mechanism of the stream turns temporal synchroniza-
tion into a new experiential mode of contemporary his-
tory, in which the past, present, and future of images
from many locations and users temporally coexist with-
out the need to manifest a sense of modern linearity or
a historical progression between them.
Imagined data communities
While the resynchronization of times enabled by the
stream velocity, frequency, and immediacy offers a
new subjective experiential mode of contemporary tem-
poralities, its expansion into a new condition of con-
temporary history is facilitated by the projection of this
idiosyncratic experience into larger sets of collective
data productions and presentations. Each action
taken within the stream is fed into a structured data-
base that complies with an archival impulse to fulfill the
potential of real-time stream drives (Gehl, 2011: 6). In
this reciprocal mechanism, the stream recedes back into
a retrievable, structured database that is then (or most
often) used to restructure distinct individual streams for
specific users according to their historic actions/data
(Weltevrede et al., 2014: 6) and aggregate temporal
multiplicities from many people, places, and times.
This new condition is enabled by an infrastructural
stability of information atomization, fragmentation,
and presentation within uniformed real-time streams.
The organization of streams as nodes of ``international
styles'' (visual, textual, etc.) forces each individual
information unit to look, act, and speak the same
way and supports a relationality that enables the con-
joining of different indexical datasets that are diverse in
variety, exhaustive in scope, and fine-grained in reso-
lution (Kitchin, 2014). This process permeates the
global and the local, the technical and the social,3 and
enables us to move from individual knowledge units to
their juxtaposition with countless other near-simulta-
neous data units, and then move back to graspable
forms of knowledge by locating connections and rela-
tions, only now on a larger scale and sense.
How does this work in relation to social media
images? The transformation of images within the
stream into a retrievable structure is enabled by
manual and automatic procedures that ``fragment'' or
``atomize'' individual images into small informational
units and present them in collections with all other
images that share informational proximity in a data-
base. The first most common manual visual classifying
systems are based on information annotation with key-
words. This type of manual indexing has been known as
tagging, and the index terms or keywords are referred
to as tags (Avery, 2010). The basic principle is that
users of social media services do ``subject indexing,''
and the assigned tags are shown immediately on the
Web along with the posted image (Vob, 2007). In
some cases, content annotation is performed by out-
sourced labor using services such as Mechanical Turk
(2005), Crowd Flower (2014), etc. In these instances,
social media platforms outsource micro tasks such as
tagging photos, filtering abusive content, or judging the
news relevance of content items (Twitter engineering
blog, 2013).
The second automatic organization of visual mater-
ials in social media platforms is based on ``external''
annotation of images with metadata (such as location
coordinates, a time stamp, a user name, etc.) and
``internal'' analysis of visual content. While the
former dominates current social media data organiza-
tion, recent developments in artificial intelligence and
computer vision analysis signal potential classification
systems based on visual content (Camfind, 2013;
GoogleGoggles, 2013; Impala, 2014; IQ Engines,
2013; Jetpack, 2014; Pixlogic, 2012; TinEye, 2014).
Aiming to transform the way in which people search
and browse theirs and others' photos, these systems
automatically analyze and recognize searchable visual
content such as objects, text, or faces and automatically
add searchable tags to images and videos where those
items are ``seen'' by the software.4
These types of visual data management are becom-
ing ever-more synchronous with the act of picture
taking within and outside of the stream and operate
both on the level of the individual's image collection
and over collective datasets from many people. They
offer to group small and large sets of images based on
inherent content attributes and then divide these visual
sets according to various categories.

The result of this twin data-control process (auto-
matic and manual tagging of image segments and
other information) reconditions the terms under
which text, images, and numbers come together and
opens up new relations between them. In these new
relations, text, numbers, and images are synchronously
``born'' and dissolved into one another without the pre-
cedence of one over the other (i.e. text does not come
after the image as a means to explicate what is in the
image but rather it is an inherent part of it). This recent
transformation of visual, verbal, and numerical identi-
ties does not reduce an image into language or a
number, but rather dissolves their historical borders
as fixed boundaries in order to form new relations of
the visual to the outside world.
Let us look at a particular example of this process.
The visual data stream consists of real-time docu-
mented events that appear to us right now, but it also
includes photos that were taken hours, days, weeks,
and sometimes years before they were uploaded to the
stream. When uploaded to the stream, these old photo-
graphic events are assigned with the elements of a new
event and ascribed as a ``new'' here and now (as their
time indication of when it was uploaded to the stream
indicates its recentness). But these past events are com-
monly assigned by users with textual tags that indicate
their ``original'' time (such as the common tags ``tbt,''
which stands for ``throw back Thursday,'' or
``latergram''), and together with all other time
indications within the stream (1 minute ago, 2 weeks
ago, etc.), they make the gap between the past and
the present obvious--and in this way, they ``thematize''
the flow of time within the stream.
But there is more to these changing relations
between images and their surrounding texts and num-
bers. Words and numbers are not meant to explicate an
image (as an indexical sign) but rather to group it with
all other images that share data similarity. What this
atomization process facilitates is that images that once
pointed toward themselves (i.e. our interest was first
directed to what is going on inside the image and
then toward the outside world--what has been known
as the symbolic aspect of images) now point directly
outside, looking for connections, relations, and pat-
terns with other items in a collection. Put differently,
the social media image directs our attention from the
inside toward the outside: toward its potential position-
ing with all other images in the same ``social (media)
space and time''; toward its spatial boundaries (i.e.
where similar images with the same tag were taken
around the world; see, for example, Figure 1) and its
temporal boundaries (i.e. when these images are taken;
see Hochman and Manovich, 2013).
We can articulate these relations in another way. If
earlier visual forms such as a work of art, a film, etc.
have been discussed and conceived as a representation
of an ``imagined world,'' and what was going on inside
the image was interpreted as reflecting (or not) larger

cultural patterns, for the social media image, these rela-
tions are turned once again on their head. The ``ima-
gined'' aspects of an image are no longer inherent to the
individual pictorial surface and the construction of its
various visual elements, but rather it is constructed
from the relations of these elements with countless
other similar pictorial elements in other social media
images. Everything that is outside of the image or
actively ``dissected'' from the image (i.e. content units
such as people, buildings, etc.) connects it to imagined
data communities that only potentially and relationally
exist. In other words, while what is going on inside the
image shows us what the world is right now (derived
from the immediate registration and the shared space of
everyday life), everything that is going on outside that
image considers the what if or what might be, or how we
might think about what the world is through the lens of
aggregated, simultaneous representations of particular
data units. In short, the ``real'' is everything that is
going on inside an image (images of particular subjects
in the world), while the symbolic is everything that is
outside of that image and connected to it via similar
fragmented data units (Figure 2).
In this way, if the computer--or the ``meta-
medium'' (Kay and Goldberg, 1977)--facilitated the
conditions for the rise of ``meta-media''--software
tools that allow the user to manipulate and change
the original structure of a media object (Manovich,
2005)--the rise of visual social media platforms facili-
tated the conditions for the rise of what we can call the
``meta-image'': a visual media interface that offers both
the original object (i.e. image, video) and software tools
that allow users to manipulate and change this object,
add descriptions, and also share, organize, and store
the image in distinct ways. In turn, each of these
image's textual and numerical descriptions (filters,
tags, location) becomes the ``DNA'' of an image, or
its unique ``signature,'' and is then used as metadata
to group this image with countless other images that
share similar data units. As such, the social media
image is a meta-image because it is always an image
about and within larger groups of images, associated
with them by shared identical data units (such as loca-
tion, time, filter, tags, content, etc.).
Due to this process of continuous fragmenta-
tion--derived from the need to ``control'' and order
massive amounts of visual materials--the social media
image is emerging as a significant cultural form not
only in terms of the structure of an individual image
within a media interface but also in terms of its organ-
ization within complete image collections. It is this type
of collective image organization that opens new creative
possibilities to organize, present, and interface large
visual data within and outside of the stream, and it is
the ways in which these images are grouped, when, and
why, that determine the significance of their organiza-
tion and the meaning of each image in relation to all
other images in that group.5
Horizon of temporalities
Within the social media domain, recent ``collective''
organizational forms of social media data act as aggre-
gators that collect data streams from existing social
information sources through API (application
programming interface) calls and act as ``live stream
readers'' that pull together data from various social
networks and are known as ``social network aggrega-
tors'' (Wikipedia, 2014), or as ``analytics dashboards''
that provide synthesized and often algorithmically sum-
marized views of data streams to extract meaningful
insights known as ``social media control centers''
(HootSuite, 2013). In regard to the visual stream, the
former currently includes applications that offer, for
example, to follow all social media data images that
are produced in a confined area in real time (see, for
example, Co Everywhere, 2013; Geofeedia, 2014; Now
App, 2013), while the latter offers to automatically re-
create live events and summarize insights about them
by crawling the Web for relevant photos, videos, and
first-person accounts (Seen, 2014) or detect live events
in the city according to social media data (images and
texts) that are produced within it (CityBeat, 2014).
What is unique about these visual aggregators is that
they replicate the individual experience of viewing a
near-simultaneous personalized visual stream consist-
ing of only people you follow, and turn it into a sum-
marized view of recent social media chronologies
produced by all other ``worldviews'' that are shared
within the stream in confined areas, particular places,
or specified events. In other words, if the individual
stream is a ``curated'' presentation of only people we
follow and we choose to synchronize ourselves with, or
of performances of time we want to compare ourselves
with, the aggregated stream acts in an opposite way: it
allows us to bring all other people from a particular
location into our own flow of time.
The CityBeat aggregation system is a particularly
interesting case in point (Figure 3). The system seg-
ments the city into a grid of small squares
(1500 Â 1500 feet) and measures real-time social
media production rates within each square (Xia et al.,
2014). In this way, each square acquires a ``temporality
rate'' according to the number of images and other
social media data produced within it at different times
of the day and over long durations in order to detect
abnormalities in an area (the system measures higher or
lower production rates compared with average rates at
different times of the day over time). The result is a
presentation of simultaneous ``abnormal temporalities''
6 Big Data & Society
or ``events'' in the city that allows you to zoom in and
examine the particular social media manifestations that
report various visual and textual aspects of what is
going on in this area in real time.
Because what we see are multiple representations of
data abnormalities in the city, the system activates the
present as an organizing principle of the past (every
image posted in an area is measured to all other past
images posted in this area), and this present is also a
measuring tool that prefigures near-future images from
the same area. Put differently, and more in line with our
former discussion, the linear structure and presentation
of the aggregated stream is unique because it systemat-
ically both synchronizes all present temporal passings
in a confined place and also reactivates recent histori-
cities in that place that are derived from the aggregation

bridges between tags and cities. Bigger tags are used more often. The tags in the center constitute a shared vocabulary across the
cities, while the ones on the outside are more specific to one (or sometimes two) cities. The visualization was created as part of the

and synchronization of these temporalities over time. In
other words, present simultaneous temporalities in a
particular location are compared with all other past
synchronous temporalities in this location and are
also compared with simultaneous temporalities in
other locations in order to reveal historical relations
between these temporalities.
In this way, these aggregators suggest an alternative
regime of historicity that automatically generates simul-
taneous larger wholes while bringing the recent past into
the present to prefigure the near future. The stream is
thus a new temporal condition that shifts away from
modern conceptualizations of time as a continuous uni-
fied sequence toward a ``presentifying'' esthetics of mul-
tiple temporalities and their relations in time and space.
What these aggregators do is to bring together diverse
temporal segments of particular events or geographical
areas into the recent present. They intensify the temporal
experience of the present and blow it up into multiple
scales (specific events, places, or individuals, the entire
city, the country, or the earth), while segmenting it into
what might be called a ``horizon'' of simultaneous tem-
poralities.6 It turns the older spatial organization of the
horizon (think, for example, of an image where the sky
meets the earth and construct a straight horizontal line)
into a temporalized one, which is now constructed from
us viewing the co-linearity of a synchronized time that
has now become times (Figure 4).
This is now
This description of some aspects of the conditions of
visual materials within the stream points toward the
ways in which the social media image might offer new
experiences, conceptions, and interactions in regard to
contemporary visual productions. As I have shown, the
structure of the social media image shapes the questions
that we can ask of it and determines how it can be used
to understand and view the world.
These new worldviews--constructed from particular
visual arrangements and temporal principles--also have
consequences for particular kinds of creative and poetic
representational practices. In what follows, I discuss
three such examples. Each in its own distinct way, the
works ``Untitled'' (Perfect Lovers) by Felix Gonzalez-
Torres (1991), The Clock by Christian Marclay (2011),
and Last Clock by Jussi A
¨ ngesleva
¨ and Ross Cooper
(2002), poetically reflect on the experience and symbolic
significances of our new ``order of stream time.'' By
doing so, the works illuminate some of the challenges,
conditions, and tensions between ``former'' visual struc-
tures and contemporary (emerging) ones and draw our
attention to the material conditions of big visual data
today and its emerging symbolic cultural significations.
The work ``Untitled'' (Perfect Lovers) by Felix
Gonzalez-Torres from 1991 consists of two identical
clocks placed side by side and presents analogous

data.

times (Figure 5). They are set to show exactly the same
time, yet due to batteries running down at different
rates in each of the two clocks, they are slightly out
of synch. It is a juxtaposition of two perfectly aligned
times that gradually run down and advance at differing
rates, a metaphorical unfulfilled desire of two nearly
identical and symmetrical beings to become one--and
thus: ``Perfect Lovers.''
The work is also a poetic manifestation of particular
principles of expression of contemporary temporalities.
Coupled with the viewer's time, the experience of the
work is one of a continuous comparison of three differ-
ent times, a set of near-simultaneous temporal relations
that will never be unified (the time of the viewer's clock
is always before/after/at the same time with the other
two clocks). As I explained before, this is also the
experience of the stream, which offers the resynchroni-
zation of temporalities that could never be completely
synched.
However, the work tells us something more refined
in relation to these new temporal conditions. The dif-
ferences between the two clocks are shrinking to their
minimum, and their temporal gaps from one another
remain roughly the same as they keep presenting similar
or close times. This is an acute observation if applied to
the temporal mechanism of the stream. As real-time
information units from many users, places, and times
keep flowing into the stream, past events quickly dis-
appear in favor of new events, and thus the presenta-
tion of information is always from the recent past,
present, or near future (i.e. 1 second ago, 10 minutes
ago, or 1 day ago, but usually not past that time span).
However metaphorical ``Untitled'' (Perfect Lovers)
might be, its material structure forces the viewer to be
within different times, and, most importantly, in close
distance from these unique times. By so doing, the
work pre-echoes a fundamental condition in the experi-
ence of our current ``stream time,'' underscoring its
structure as a continuous comparison of temporalities
that their distance from each other (and us) remains
always roughly equal and close. This temporal experi-
ence, as meticulously visualized by Gonzalez-Torres, is
not about the passage of time as a succession of events
laid out on a unified spatial sequence such as the timeline
(a la Bergson), but one of being in relation to others who
are always in a similar, short temporal distance from us.7
While ``Untitled'' (Perfect Lovers) is an early meta-
phorical articulation of core principles in the structure

and experience of contemporary stream time, more
recent works elaborate on the complexities of current
time representations. Christian Marclay's The Clock is
a 24-hour video that assembles, samples, edits, and
remixes together thousands of short film clips--all fea-
ture clocks, watches, or people announcing or referring
to time. These short cinematic time indications are then
organized chronologically to represent the progression
of a full day and synchronized with the actual time of the
viewer. The result is a 24-hour timepiece, which meticu-
lously ticks the time (minutes and sometimes the sec-
onds) of a full day, while confronting the viewer with
short historical cinematic moments that are synchro-
nized and timed with the outside world (Figure 6).
By creating ``a sort of homemade Web engine'' (Smith,
2011), a fabricated algorithmic aggregation system that
seems to automatically search and cross-reference count-
less cinematic materials that refer to time in one way or
another, Marclay poetically signifies the problem of scale
itself: it is not only about how to deal with the exponential
growth of data, but rather how to generate a significant
cultural object (be it a work of art, a historical account,
cultural theory, etc.) based on this data. In fact, in the case
of The Clock, the problem is how to say something about
the changing nature of our current time, while the acute
problem is that you have countless, different, expressions
of this time, or, more precisely, how do we encapsulate the
meaning of contemporary time on a planetary scale and in
a planetary sense?
Marclay's solution here is to organize his large-scale
dataset according to real-world time, to synchronize the
screen time (the time presented in each clip) with the real
time of the viewer. The result is a database of cinematic
segments that are decontextualized, devoid of meaning,
can be replaced by others, and are equal in their import-
ance, relevance, and contribution to the overall meaning
of the collection. It is a continuous artificially constructed
fragmented stream of time-stamped images (both with the
original cinematic time and a real-world time indication),
a fictional hybrid of historical cinematic moments that
appear to us as if they are accruing right now.
Within these new temporal conditions, the experience
of the work is of a continuous tension between the linear
and the cyclical: the cyclical, in the form of particular
time indications that repeat themselves potentially for-
ever (the actual time of the viewer synchronized with
screen time), and the linear, in the form of constantly
disturbed autonomous film fragments (the construction
of meaning by conventions of causality within the image
or a sequence of images). In this way, the work overrides
the symbolic nature of the original film clip, its distance
and distinction from the world, in favor of a more direct
association with larger networks of meaning that
happen to us right now.

What we get here is a mixture of old and new, a para-
doxical timeline of negated times that are, surprisingly,
completely synchronized. This is not a traditional time-
line, as its historical axes are not parallel but conjoined
to each other. Each image is not organized and perceived
according to its original cinematic or creation time, but
by multiple other real and potential times that operate
within it. We can call it a relational timeline, a timeline
that is interested not in the organization of information
according to its substantial features (in terms of a fixed
content, creation date, etc.) but rather in potential rela-
tions, connections, and continuities among its countless
fragments. Very much like social media stream time, the
work presents us with a timeline that forces you to be
within time (the present time) but also inherently against
it (as you are constantly occupied by the juxtaposition of
different times together).
In light of my earlier discussion of current visual
informational processes within the stream, it is useful
to think about The Clock as an expression of the
desire for a film to become a contemporary image. It
articulates a tension between a cinematic modern linear-
ity that is controlled by a singular worldview of a
filmmaker to the arbitrary organization of many world-
views by constantly changing equally important data
attributes. By so doing, it juxtaposes and confronts
two inherently different pictorial logics and draws our
attention to the material configurations and cultural sig-
nifications of contemporary visual stream productions.
Similar informational and representational processes
take place and are intensified in the work Last Clock by
Jussi A
¨ ngesleva
¨ and Ross Cooper (the work was first
released as an interactive installation in 2002 and was
later adapted to mobile phones in 2011). While The
Clock still carries the identification of a singular mod-
ernist artwork that remains the same every time you
watch it, in Last Clock, the cinematic database is
replaced or eliminated with a continuous stream of
image slices that are captured live by a mobile phone
camera. Each of the clock's hands, as they rotate
around, leaves a trace or a ``slice'' of what has been
captured by the mobile camera phone. In this way,
what seems at first a traditional analog clock with
second, minute, and hour hands showing the current
time quickly transforms into a visual representation of
the temporal nature or ``rhythm'' of individuals in a
Figure 6. Christian Marclay, The Clock, 2010. Single channel video, duration: 24 hours.

particular space. In other words, the software of Last
Clock captures ``slices'' of reality through the mobile
phone camera and stitches them together in such a
way that every change in position, perspective, or envir-
onment of the camera phone directs the shape of time
(Figure 7).
Instead of a fixed representational ``universal'' time
that is being determined a priori as in all other regular
clocks, time here is ``personalized'' by capturing
momentary slices of space and positioning them on
the screen both in time and as time itself. The result is
a monitoring clock that detects the changing nature of a
space or movement in space and forces an individual to
understand themselves as a point in that time and place.
Similarly to The Clock, the work connects a former
representational time to an individual time. The result
is a representation of different scales of visual time
(minutes, hours, or seconds) that moves from the uni-
versal, global time to the local, idiosyncratic time, while
not reducing the latter in favor of the former.
As the hands of the clock rotate at different rates,
displaying the last minute, hour, and 12 hours as its
history, they continually overwrite the past with the
present. While this speaks to stream mechanisms dis-
cussed before (such as the close distance between dif-
ferent temporalities that remains roughly equal and
close), Last Clock also elaborates on the question of
the representational pace of time. Even though the
same slice of the video feeds all three hands of the
clock, the fact that the hands move at different rates
means that each ring shows a different algorithmically
constructed representation of the same time.
As apposed to The Clock, where the viewer was con-
fronted with the multiplicity of temporalities at the
same time, Last Clock manipulates and juxtaposes the
same singular temporality but places it within three dif-
ferent temporal rates. This points directly to the fabri-
cation of stream time and its medium specificity. A
stream is not only the flow and convergence of the
multiplicity of different, yet close, times, but it is also

a manipulated representational mechanism of time
determined by the mesh of algorithms, content, and
users' actions (Weltevrede et al., 2014: 18). In this
new state of matter, an actionable, malleable, informa-
tional stream feeds an archival database that constantly
constructs and reconstructs the form and pace of its
own representational stream time.
Conclusion
In this article, I addressed a key question of temporality
that arises in the shift from database to data stream in
relation to social media images. I analyzed the structure
of social media images within the stream, charted some
of the current ways to organize and categorize these
images, and theorized the representational implications
of these new structures for the ways in which we might
``know'' and understand these images. Additionally, I
showed how these visual arrangements and temporal
principles facilitated by the stream are poetically mani-
fested and discussed in three artworks that position
contemporary time as their main subject of inquiry.
Both the visual stream and our discussed artworks
situate the contemporary (social media) image within a
new order of time and elaborate on the experience,
meaning, and analyses of this particular time. By
emphasizing technical and poetic ways in which social
media platforms and aggregators situate the present as a
``thick'' historical unit that embodies multiple and syn-
chronous temporalities, I tried to illuminate some of the
conditions, challenges, and tensions between former
visual structures and current ones and unfold the cul-
tural significations of contemporary big visual data.
As apposed to prevalent conceptions of contempor-
ary time as trapped within a paralyzing presentism of
simultaneous flows with no past or future (Castells,
2000; Hartog, 2003; Sterling, 2010)--and in reaction
to recent attempts to undermine the study of this eter-
nal ``plastic'' present (Uprichard, 2012)--this article
insists that this ``now'' is actually just one temporal
aspect of many, facilitated by the stream. As such, my
goal was to start pointing to the distinctive qualities in
which the visual stream facilitates a complex multipli-
city of ways of being in real-time(s) today. In particu-
lar, I tried to bring attention to the cruciality of what it
is to be in stream time that promotes the awareness for
the ``presence'' of other kinds of times, including algo-
rithmic times.
This is for me what is truly inscribed into recent
notions of ``velocity,'' and the main challenge for
research interested in the experience of Big Data
streams presentism: recognizing, characterizing, and
analyzing the variety of presence(s) in each platform,
for different groups of users, and for different geogra-
phies, and the ways in which these presence(s) are
constructed by larger (cultural, social, political, and
technological) forces.
It is only in these circumstances--to bring us back to
our original starting point of the image within a new
regime of time--that we may say that image taking is
shifting from being ``of the world'' and is becoming
``for the world.''8 The social media image thus demands
that we trace, visualize, and analyze its encounters,
coherence, and negation with other images across dif-
ferent times, following the circumstances that give
shape to its existence and operation within particular
stream time(s).

Notes
1. My use of the term social media is restricted here to ``social
awareness streams'' (SAS), characterized by their public
(or personal­public) nature of the communication, the
brevity of posted content, and a highly connected social
space (Naaman et al., 2010). As such, what I refer to here
as the social media image denotes a particular type of
image that is taken, manipulated, and shared within
social media awareness streams (natively uploaded
images) and is archived in a retrievable public or semi-
public database. In doing so, I am not accounting for
those contemporary social media platforms that are not
organized as streams and that their images are not pre-
dominantly created for and within a particular application
(for example, platforms such as Pinterest, which is orga-
nized around building collections that are not stream or
real-time oriented); nor do I refer to non-retrievable and
non-public images (i.e. apps like Snapchat that are orga-
nized around a specific ephemeral logic).
2. This is a rather general conception of ontology. For the
specific meaning of the term ``software ontology'' in infor-
mation and computer science, see Oberle et al. (2009: 383­
402).
3. This description aligns and follows Star and Ruhleder's
classic definition of infrastructure (1996: 114).
4. For example, Flickr and Pinterest recently incorporated
visual search mechanisms that automatically recognize
visual content in images and enable users to search their
database by image themes and concepts, or recognize par-
ticular items (i.e. the shape of clothing) and show similar
items the viewer might be interested in (Constine, 2014;
Panzarino, 2014). Moreover, in addition to simple and
now most common face identification in digital cameras,
face detection has found its way into popular services such
as iPhoto, Picasa, Facebook, Instagram, Googleþ, etc.
(Banerjee and Anderson, 2013). In Facebook, for example,
faces are not just detected but also automatically tagged
Hochman 13
and matched as they are uploaded into the stream
(Taigman et al., 2014).
5. This organizing principle of images as a ``group'' is a spe-
cific choice, but one of many. Other perspectives could
equally highlight, for example, the potential within big
datasets to trace the circulation of a single image across
collections, platforms, time, and space.
6. This follows Heidegger's understanding of time as ``the
horizon of the understanding of being in terms of tempor-
ality. . .'' (Heidegger, 1996: 15).
7. Terry Smith (2013: 281) characterizes this as the ``temporal
paradox'' of contemporary artistic compositions: ``Past
times or imagined futures are no longer events strung
along history's chain or thread, but are actions that
occurred, or might be imagined to have occurred, at a
roughly equal temporal distance from us.''
8. A similar transition in regard to contemporary art produc-
tions is identified by Terry Smith (2011: 325).
