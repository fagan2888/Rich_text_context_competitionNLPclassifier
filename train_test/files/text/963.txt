Scraps of Paper? Agreements and
the Durability of Peace
Virginia Page Fortna
Why does peace sometimes last and sometimes fall apart? What, if anything, can
be done to enhance the durability of peace in the aftermath of war? Some cease-
fires fall apart within days or months, others hold for years, while others last in-
definitely. Why, for example, did a cease-fire in the Arab-Israeli war in 1948 fail
within three months, while the next one lasted for years? Why has peace so often
faltered between India and Pakistan but held, despite ongoing tensions, between
North and South Korea? Surprisingly little theoretical or empirical work has ex-
plored this important question.
States have devised a number of mechanisms to try to make it easier to main-
tain peace. These mechanisms are often implemented as part of a cease-fire agree-
ment. States set up demilitarized zones, accept international peacekeeping missions,
establish dispute resolution procedures, sign formal agreements, and undertake other
steps to try to enhance the prospects for peace. Do these measures work? If so,
why? This article begins to answer this question by analyzing the duration of peace
after international wars ending between 1946 and 1997. It draws on and develops
theories of international cooperation to argue that measures such as these help
enemies overcome the cooperation problem inherent in the aftermath of war. Stu-
dents of international relations have long drawn on contracting theory and the new
economics of organization literature to examine how actors can achieve coopera-
tion even as anarchy makes it impossible to write enforceable contracts.1 Scholar-

ship in this vein points to a number of ways in which cease-fire agreements might
influence the chances of maintaining peace. I argue that mechanisms within agree-
ments can make durable peace more likely by changing the incentives to break a
cease-fire, by reducing uncertainty about actions and intentions, and by prevent-
ing accidental violations from triggering another round of fighting. If this argu-
ment is correct, the content of cease-fire agreements should affect whether peace
lasts. Individually and collectively, these measures should be associated with more
durable peace, all else being equal.
Scholars of international relations in the realist tradition likely would argue that
cease-fire agreements and the measures within them are at best epiphenomenal. In
these scholars' view, agreements may reflect other factors that affect durability,
but arguments that they themselves shape the chances for lasting peace are ideal-
istic. In this view, agreements are merely "scraps of paper." They are not binding
in an anarchical system and should have no independent effect on international
behavior, least of all on decisions about war and peace.2 To test the effects of
agreements on the durability of peace, one therefore needs to control for other
factors that affect the baseline prospects for peace. If, once these variables are
included, agreement mechanisms have no effect, then one can conclude that agree-
ments are only scraps of paper. If, however, agreements matter even when the
baseline prospects are accounted for, this would support the argument that even
deadly enemies can overcome the obstacles to cooperation.
A small but growing literature has begun to examine what makes peace easier
or harder to maintain. For example, a number of scholars, including Zeev Maoz
and Paul Hensel, have found that decisive victories tend to be more stable than
stalemates.3 Hensel also found that conflicts over territory were more likely to
reemerge. In what is probably the most comprehensive examination of this issue
to date, Werner finds that changes in relative capabilities over time provide the
best explanation for the breakdown of peace.4 She argues that the durability of
peace is best examined as a decision to restart the war as part of an ongoing bar-
gaining process, so that changes taking place after the fighting stops are most likely
to affect whether it starts again.
The growing literature on "enduring rivalries" is closely related to the study of
the resumption of war.5 By selecting only cases of repeated conflict, much of this
literature cannot address the question of why some rivalries endure while others
do not. However, Stinnett and Diehl tackle this issue in their study of the paths
to rivalry. They find, for example, that conflicts between contiguous states, be-
tween major powers, or between recently independent states are more likely to be

repeated; that joint democracy reduces the likelihood of more conflict; and that
territorial disputes and those ending in stalemates are more likely to endure.6 At
the other end of the rivalry life span, Bennett finds that domestic political factors
such as regime type and issue salience affect the termination of rivalries.7
While scholars are beginning to learn why peace is harder to maintain in some
cases than in others, there is not yet a good understanding of what can be done to
make peace more likely to last. Existing works have only tangentially addressed
whether deliberate mechanisms to try to maintain peace have been effective.8 No
systematic studies have explored whether and how the content of cease-fire agree-
ments matters in the construction of lasting peace.9 Are cease-fire agreements merely
scraps of paper that have no effect on stability? Or is it the case that agreements
can improve the prospect of a lasting peace?
The first section of this article develops cooperation theory to explain how spe-
cific mechanisms within cease-fire agreements might affect the durability of peace.
This argument suggests that measures such as the withdrawal of forces, creation
of demilitarized zones, formal cease-fire agreements, peacekeeping, third-party guar-
antees, and dispute resolution procedures should help foster peace that lasts. The
more of these measures implemented, the longer peace should last, all else being
equal. This section also lays out the counterargument and explores other variables
that might be expected to affect the baseline prospects for peace. It is important to
include these variables to guard against the possibility of finding spurious effects
if these factors influence both the content of agreements and the duration of peace;
in other words, to show that agreements are not epiphenomenal. The second sec-
tion describes the econometric model and the data set of cease-fires in inter-
national wars used to test these hypotheses. The findings, presented in the third
section, show that agreements are not merely scraps of paper; rather, the imple-
mentation of specific mechanisms within cease-fire agreements can help make peace
last. Strong agreements lead to more durable peace.
In this study I define peace merely as the absence of war. I do not distinguish
between relations that become very friendly and those that remain acrimonious
despite the absence of violence. Under my definition, North and South Korea have
been at "peace" for half a century. Clearly, not all varieties of peace are equally
desirable, nor does stability necessarily coincide with social justice. Nevertheless,
most wars cause poverty, disease, and dislocation, and all entail the large-scale
loss of human life. Repeated conflict only exacerbates these tragedies. This study
not only indicates that states can overcome obstacles to maintaining peace in war-
torn areas, but also identifies the most effective ways of doing so.

Cooperation Theory and Agreements
Maintaining peace in the aftermath of war requires cooperation. Because war is
costly, there is shared interest in avoiding renewed hostilities. This shared interest,
however, does not automatically lead to peace. Recent belligerents have deeply
conflicting interests and strong incentives to take advantage of each other.10 They
also have good reason to fear each other's intentions. Cooperation is therefore
difficult to achieve. I argue that cease-fire agreements can foster cooperation in
several ways, by changing incentives, by reducing uncertainty about actions and
intentions, and by controlling accidental violations of the cease-fire.
This argument rests on three assumptions: (1) that states are rationally led; (2)
that war is costly, and not desired for its own sake; and (3) that each ex-belligerent
has incentives to take advantage of its opponent, or good reason to fear its oppo-
nent's intentions. I do not assume that both belligerents reach a cease-fire on equal
footing." There are usually winners and losers in war, and at least one side's ac-
ceptance of a cease-fire may have been "coerced." However, unless one side is
completely eliminated in war, both sides can impose costs on each other, and the
problem of cooperation maintains.12
First, by "rationally led" I mean that leaders make decisions purposefully and
that they consider the expected costs and benefits of their actions. Leaders are not
omniscient; they can make mistakes. But I assume that leaders do not act ran-
domly, nor will they act in ways that they expect will be contrary to their inter-
ests. I do not assume that states are unitary actors, however. Leaders are subject to
domestic political pressures, and may not exercise full control over all of those in
whose name they lead.
Second, to say that actors prefer peace to war is not to say, naively, that they
prefer peace to the possibility of winning a war and dictating terms, but to say that
they would prefer to reach the outcome of war without the cost of fighting it. War
is costly in terms of lives and money, and it is risky--there is always the chance
of losing rather than winning. As Fearon has explained, war is "ex post ineffi-
cient." 13 Unless fighting is preferred for its own sake, even enemies would prefer
to settle their disputes without resorting to war.
The inefficiency of war does not necessarily result in peace, however. This study
concerns states who were recently at war, and who are, by definition, deadly en-
10. A shared interest in peace combined with conflicting individual interests constitutes the prob-
lem of cooperation. On the distinctions between harmony, cooperation, and deadlock, see Keohane 1984.
See also Oye 1986.
11. For the sake of simplicity, I discuss the problem of cooperation as involving only two states. A
number of wars in this study have multiple belligerents. These are split into separate dyadic observa-
tions in the quantitative research discussed below.

emies.14 I assume, third, that relations between adversaries are marked by seri-
ously conflicting interests and deep mistrust. It is unlikely that the war settled the
conflict to both parties' satisfaction. Indeed the war may have caused new issues
of conflict. Both sides face incentives to take advantage of each other. They are
bargaining over some disputed issue. If either side thought it could march in and
take what it wanted without meeting much resistance, it would probably choose to
do so. States prefer peace to war, but not to settling the dispute on their own terms.
Conflicting interests give belligerents an incentive to break the cease-fire in a bid
to make unilateral gains on the battlefield. This is the familiar game of prisoner's
dilemma.
There may also be cases where neither side would prefer to attack, even un-
opposed. However, there is no easy way for actors to know this. In an atmosphere
of deep mistrust in the aftermath of war, each side has good reason to fear attack
from its opponent. Uncertainty and fear about the other's intentions can under-
mine cooperation even where perfect information would automatically yield a co-
operative outcome. Security dilemma dynamics and their spirals of fear and hostility
are especially likely among states who have recently engaged in mortal combat.15
With communication channels severed during the war, and enemies likely to as-
sume the worst about each other, incidents along the cease-fire line, even if acci-
dental or the result of rogue forces, can reignite war. Peace is precarious.
A hypothetical case helps illustrate the obstacles to peace. Imagine two states
that have just fought a war over a piece of territory (Israel and Syria in 1973,
perhaps, or El Salvador and Honduras after the 1969 Football War). The war was
costly and the two states would prefer not to fight again, but they would each like
more of the disputed land, preferably all of it. Both believe it to be rightfully theirs,
and domestically, occupation of any part of it by the enemy is seen as a travesty.
The side that lost territory in the war has an incentive to try to win it back, and the
side that gained may hope it can now claim more. Both sides therefore have in-
centives to try to encroach upon the other, or even to make a dramatic advance, to
push the cease-fire line farther toward the other side.
Moreover, both states have good reason to fear encroachment or attack by the
other. These fears have likely been exacerbated by leaders' inflammatory remarks
for domestic consumption. Both sides will be particularly wary of military maneu-
vers, resupply efforts, or anything that might be a precursor to a new attack. When
the fighting stopped, soldiers were likely left in close proximity to their enemies,
facing each other "eyeball-to-eyeball" across the cease-fire line. The chance of
troops firing across the line or of skirmishes as each side tries to improve its po-
sition is quite high. If irregular troops were involved in the fighting, or if com-

mand and control are somewhat loose, there may be incidents of unauthorized
attacks or advances. In such a tense atmosphere of mistrust, with normal diplo-
matic channels cut, such small clashes can easily escalate. Whether through delib-
erate action, spirals of fear and preemption, or accident and involuntary defection,
the probability of war erupting anew is high.16
Although both sides are better off with peace, they cannot simply declare peace
and leave it at that. Their commitments to maintain peace are not credible.17 An
actor with hostile intentions has an incentive to say it will abide by the cease-fire
so that its partner will cooperate and be "suckered" into letting down its guard
and perhaps leaving itself vulnerable to attack. In international relations, of course,
there is no external enforcement power to prevent actors from such cheating. This
is the central problem of cooperation under anarchy in international relations.
So how do deadly enemies ever achieve peace? Cease-fire arrangements rely on
reciprocity and mutual deterrence. Each side stops fighting in exchange for the
other side doing the same. If either breaks the cease-fire, the other will respond in
kind. It is the prospect of return fire that deters attack. This is so central to the
notion of a cease-fire that it may seem quite obvious. However, for reciprocity
and deterrence to work, several things must be true: the cost of reinitiating con-
flict must outweigh the incentives to attack; it must be easy to distinguish com-
pliance from noncompliance; both sides must be reassured about each other's
intentions, especially if a there is a military advantage to striking first; and acci-
dents must be prevented from triggering another war. These requisites suggest both
the obstacles to peace and strategies for overcoming them.
Cease-fire agreements can employ three types of strategies to ensure that peace
lasts: changing incentives by making it more costly to attack; reducing uncer-
tainty about actions and intentions; and preventing or controlling accidental vio-
lations. These strategies suggest specific observable mechanisms, the effects of
which are tested below.
Altering Incentives
War will resume if the incentives to attack exceed the cost of breaking the cease-
fire. But there are steps belligerents and the international community can take to
increase the costs of an attack. These steps widen the bargaining space between
belligerents and make another bout of war less likely. Adversaries can tie their
16. Reiter 1995 found preemption to be rare as the sole cause of war. But conflicts that start or
escalate to war through preemption are most likely among deadly enemies, such as Israel and its Arab
neighbors in 1967. Similarly, wars rarely start purely by accident, but escalating clashes, often at least
partially the result of accidents or unauthorized action, can contribute to the spiral toward war. Such
was the case between India and Pakistan in 1965, and arguably again in 1999. Escalating clashes led to
the second war between China and Vietnam, and to serious fighting short of full-scale war between
Honduras and El Salvador in 1976.

own hands by physically constraining their ability to attack. Withdrawal of troops
from the front line, creation of a demilitarized buffer zone, and arms control make
remobilizing for war more difficult. These actions also make a successful surprise
attack much less likely.
Belligerents may also be able to alter incentives by declaring their cease-fire
formally. By signing a formal agreement, states invoke international law. Of course,
with no higher authority to enforce it, international law is not binding in the way
that domestic law is. International agreements can be broken, but breaking them
risks losing international aid and military support, and legitimizes retaliation by
the other side. Formal and public declaration of a cease-fire thus invokes inter-
national audience costs.18
Actors may also turn to outsiders to help them enforce a cease-fire. Commit-
ment by a third party to guarantee the peace serves as a deterrent, again by raising
the cost of noncompliance. An external guarantor takes on some of the responsi-
bility for retaliation in the event of defection. The presence of peacekeeping troops
interposed between forces may also serve as a physical and reputational buffer to
ensure the cease-fire.
Reducing Uncertainty About Actions and Intentions
Agreements can reduce uncertainty by specifying the terms of a cease-fire. Mark-
ing the exact location of the cease-fire line provides a focal point that can help
prevent "salami tactic" attempts to push the line to either side's advantage. Spell-
ing out the rules of the cease-fire explicitly helps to define compliance and non-
compliance, which serves to prevent misunderstandings and avoid unnecessary
tension. The more specific the agreement, the less uncertainty there will be about
what constitutes compliance.
Verification mechanisms can alleviate concerns about detecting aggressive moves
by the opponent in time to respond. Monitoring may be less important in cease-
fire agreements than other sorts of agreements, because states are likely to rely on
national intelligence for warning of an attack, and it is difficult to hide aggression
once it starts.19 However, neutral referees can play an important role in fostering
stable peace. Because it is costly to be seen as the aggressor, states will try to
blame the other side for any fighting that starts. Without neutral observers, claims
of being the victim of aggression are not credible and there are bound to be
disputes over "who started it." Monitors to investigate incidents and provide

domestic audience costs if peace is unpopular with some groups. Both Anwar Sadat and Yitzhak Rabin
paid, tragically, with their lives. In cases such as these, audience costs serve a very different role:

mitment. Martin 1993.

unbiased information on compliance are therefore important for distinguishing un-
provoked aggression from legitimate retaliation. The international audience costs
of breaking a cease-fire, therefore, often depend on impartial monitoring.
Physical constraints, audience costs, and third-party guarantees or peacekeep-
ing efforts change belligerents' incentives, but also serve as important signaling
devices that can reduce uncertainty about intentions. Willingness to accept mea-
sures that make war more costly is a credible signal of benign intent. States con-
templating an attack will be less willing than those with nobler intentions to sign
on to measures that increase the physical or political cost of fighting. Critics might
argue that this concedes the point that agreements are epiphenomenal; only those
who intend to abide by the cease-fire will agree to strong mechanisms, but it is the
intentions, not the mechanisms, doing the causal work. This argument is unfalsi-
fiable, as is there is no way to measure intentions a priori (if there were, inter-
national relations would be very different and war might not exist at all). But it
also misses the point. Of course intentions matter. One of the ways in which agree-
ments affect the durability of peace is by providing credible ways of signaling
these intentions and overcoming the security dilemma.
In the abstract, there are two distinct causal pathways possible: one in which
agreement mechanisms influence peace directly by constraining states or provid-
ing information, and another in which mechanisms simply signal intentions. How-
ever, the two pathways are not so easily distinguished in reality. As the literature
on signaling and "cheap talk" suggests, if there are incentives to misrepresent, as
there surely are among deadly enemies, signals are only credible if they are costly.
For a state to limit its ability to wage war, or to open itself up to verification is
costly, and therefore credible. That is, the indirect signaling function depends in
large part on the more direct effects of agreement mechanisms.20
Controlling Accidents
Reciprocal strategies can be very vulnerable to accidents and misunderstandings.
If troops stray over the cease-fire line, or fire accidentally, and the other side re-
taliates, the situation can quickly spiral back into full-blown war. If leaders do not
exercise full control over their troops (or in some cases over civilians), rogue groups
opposed to peace can easily upset it by violating the cease-fire and provoking
retaliation.
Ongoing negotiations and dispute resolution procedures can alleviate this dan-
ger by preventing misunderstandings and providing a forum for resolving differ-
ences before a spiral of retaliation is triggered. However, because both sides have
20. Some of the mechanisms examined here signal by "tying hands," creating costs only if a state
reneges on its commitment. This is true of the reputational costs invoked by a formal agreement, for
example. Others "sink costs" by requiring payment ex ante, for example withdrawing from territory.
Others, such as verification measures, may do both. On this distinction, see Fearon 1997.

an incentive to blame violations on accidents or rogue factions, communication
by itself may not always be credible.
Withdrawal of forces, buffer zones, and arms control can help prevent accidents
and misunderstandings from occurring in the first place.21 "Confidence-building
measures" to regulate and make transparent behavior (such as military exercises)
that is likely to cause tension can also prevent misunderstandings and alleviate
suspicions. Cease-fire agreements often hold each state responsible for violations
coming from its own territory, to prevent these violations from being used as an
excuse for intentional defection. Agreements may also include concrete measures
for internal control to deal with this problem of "involuntary defection."22 In ad-
dition to acting as referees, international monitors investigate and mediate small
clashes and disputes to keep them from escalating.
The theory put forth here is an institutionalist argument about mechanisms to
overcome the obstacles to cooperation. I hypothesize that agreements can enhance
the durability of peace by raising the cost of breaking a cease-fire, reducing un-
certainty, and preventing and controlling accidents. While these three strategies
for maintaining peace are presented separately, their functions are intimately con-
nected, and specific mechanisms often serve several purposes. For example, mon-
itoring by peacekeepers reduces uncertainty by ensuring that defectors will be
caught. This also raises the cost of reinitiating war. In practice, much of peace-
keepers' day-to-day work entails mediation and the prevention of small clashes
from spiraling out of control. Physical constraints that alter the incentives for war
also necessarily reduce fears of impending attack and reduce the likelihood of ac-
cidents. Belligerents' willingness to implement measures to tie their own hands
and raise the cost of attack serves as a credible signal of commitment and thereby
reduces uncertainty and makes accidents easier to control.
While analytically distinct, the strategies of raising costs, reducing uncertainty,
and controlling accidents therefore overlap in practice. The strategies themselves
cannot be observed directly. But the specific mechanisms discussed above can be
observed and their effects tested empirically. I focus on the following measures:
withdrawal of forces, establishment of demilitarized zones, arms control, mea-
sures to control potential rogue groups, third-party involvement, peacekeeping,
confidence-building measures, dispute resolution procedures, the specificity of
agreements, and whether agreements are formal or tacit.
I use the term "strength of agreement" to refer to the number and extent of the
measures implemented as part of a cease-fire. Agreement strength varies from none,
if a cease-fire takes place with no agreement or without implementing any of the
measures listed above (as when the second war between China and Vietnam sim-

ply fizzled out with no real cease-fire agreement), to very strong if the agreement
implements significant buffer zones, peacekeepers, confidence-building measures,
is formal and very specific, and so on. (The agreements reached between Israel
and Egypt after the Yom Kippur war, as well as the Korean Armistice, are exam-
ples.) If the cooperation theory spelled out here is correct, peace should last lon-
ger, ceteris paribus, the stronger the agreement implemented. Furthermore, each
of the individual measures should be associated with more durable peace. Both
together and separately, these mechanisms are hypothesized to increase the stabil-
ity of peace.
Political Settlement
Altering incentives, reducing uncertainty, and controlling accidents are all rather
apolitical strategies for avoiding war. But the political content of an agreement
should also be important. Resolving the underlying issues of conflict, if it is pos-
sible, is a way of removing the reason to fight. Whether an agreement purports to
settle the political issues over which the war was fought, rather than simply to
stop hostilities, should affect stability. I focus on the more mechanical tools for
maintaining peace, because settlement of the basic political issues, whether by
agreement or by force, is quite rare in the post-World War II era. Most wars end
with the fundamental issues still in dispute, even if one side clearly won the war
(Israel's decisive victory in 1967 did not settle the Arab-Israeli issue, for example).
Nevertheless, when a settlement of substantive political issues is reached, whether
imposed or agreed to, one should expect it to be associated with stable peace.
The Counterargument: Agreements Are Epiphenomenal,
Merely "Scraps of Paper"
All else being equal, stronger agreements should lead to more durable peace. All
else is not equal, however. The agreement aside, peace will be easier to maintain
in some cases than in others. The counterargument to the hypothesis that agree-
ments can foster peace is that when cooperation is relatively easy, parties will be
able to draft strong agreements. These are the very cases in which peace will last
in any case. Conversely, when cooperation is difficult and the chances of peace
falling apart are high for other reasons, belligerents will be unable to conclude
agreements that do anything more than paper over differences. Any apparent rela-
tionship between the strength of agreements and the duration of peace is therefore
spurious. According to this argument, agreements are merely epiphenomenal; they
reflect other factors that determine the duration of peace but have no independent
effect of their own.
In related research I have tested this counterargument directly, examining whether
stronger agreements are implemented when these situational variables make peace
easier or harder to maintain. I have found little evidence that states only imple-
ment strong agreements in the easy cases. If anything, just the opposite is true,

with strong agreements more likely when they are most needed; that is, when these
control factors make peace most precarious.23 Nonetheless, it is crucial to control
for other variables that might affect the baseline prospects for peace (the "degree
of difficulty," as it were) to test accurately the effects of cease-fire agreements.24
In the empirical tests below, I control for a series of factors that make peace more
or less difficult to maintain. Following other studies of the resumption of war, one
should expect peace to last longer after decisive military victories than after stale-
mates.25 Because the cost of war is the main reason to cooperate in the first place,
one might also expect peace to be more stable the more costly the war just fought.
Belligerents with a history of conflict before the war are likely to have a harder
time maintaining peace, either because repeated conflict is a good indicator of the
intractability of the dispute or because conflict breeds future conflict. One might
expect cooperation to be most difficult when war threatens states' very existence
or when the fight is over territory.26 Because contiguous states are more likely to
fight in the first place, one might expect them to be more likely to fight again than
states separated by more than a border.27 Changes in relative military capabilities
should also affect the durability of peace. Research on democracy and war sug-
gests that dyads that become jointly democratic should be able to maintain peace.28
Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman's measure of states' "expected utility for war"
might help one predict when a war will resume.29 Whether the war was bilateral
or included more than two states might also affect stability.
If the counterargument that cease-fire agreements are epiphenomenal is correct,
the strength of agreements should have no bearing once these other factors are
taken into account.
Method: Model and Data
The Econometric Model
This article examines the duration of peace; why some cease-fires fall apart quickly
while others last longer. Early studies of durability judged the success or failure
of peace dichotomously by whether the conflict resumed within some time period

(five years, say). The use of an arbitrary time period is problematic, however. What
one chooses as the time limit by which to judge success can significantly affect
results. One could instead use the criterion of whether war has ever resumed to
distinguish permanent peace from any cease-fire that fails. This would at least be
an analytic, rather than arbitrary, distinction between the two categories. How-
ever, this method runs into another problem--the issue of "censored data." Peace
that has lasted to date may not continue to hold. Even if peace has lasted quite a
long time, one cannot know how long it will continue to last. Israel and Syria
have not fought a full-fledged war in almost twenty years, but they might yet.30
Those cases in which peace has lasted to date are considered "censored."
Fortunately, a class of econometric models exists that avoids all of these prob-
lems. Duration models (also known as hazard rate or survival time models) esti-
mate the effects of independent variables on the length of time something lasts,
and the models can incorporate our uncertainty about how long the phenomenon
(in this case, peace) will continue into the future. Of the several duration models
to choose from, I use a Weibull model. Unlike some models, it does not require an
assumption that the hazard rate (the instantaneous rate of failure given survival to
a given point) is constant over time. The Weibull, therefore, allows us to test com-
peting hypotheses about whether peace becomes easier or harder to maintain over
time. The Weibull does, however, assume that the shape of the hazard rate is mono-
tonic. To see whether this is a reasonable assumption, I have also run a Cox pro-
portional hazard model that makes no assumption about the shape of the hazard.
The findings are not significantly different, suggesting that the Weibull model is
appropriate. The Weibull gives more precise estimates in a small data set like the
one used here.31
The Cease-Fires Data Set
To test the hypotheses laid out above, I constructed a data set that includes infor-
mation on cease-fires and how long they lasted; on the situation between the bel-
ligerents at the time of cease-fire (their history of conflict, the decisiveness of
military victory, etc.) as well as changes over time (in relative capabilities, regime
type, etc.); and detailed information on the nature and content of any agreement
and peace mechanisms that accompanied or followed the cease-fire.
The data set covers cease-fires in international wars ending between 1946
and 1997. Each case is a cease-fire between a pair of principal belligerents in the
30. India and Pakistan fought a war in the Kargil region in 1999 after the data used here were
censored, underlining the importance of treating with care our uncertainty about peace that has lasted
to a certain point.

Correlates of War Version 3 (COW) data set's list of interstate wars.321 split multi-
lateral wars from the COW data set into separate dyads and eliminated minor par-
ticipants.33 A cease-fire is defined as an end to or break in the fighting, whether or
not it represents the end of the war. It need not be accomplished through an ex-
plicit agreement. COW wars in which fighting stopped and started again are di-
vided into separate cases, one for each cease-fire. During the first Arab-Israeli war
in Palestine, for example, there was a break in the fighting in 1948 in accordance
with a United Nations (UN) Security Council resolution ordering a cease-fire. Three
months later, the cease-fire failed when Israel launched an offensive to seize the
Negev. Another cease-fire ended the war in 1949. I treat these as distinct cases.
History tends to forget the failed cease-fires, focusing only on the ones that suc-
ceeded in ending the war. Breaking these into separate cases is therefore crucial to
avoid selecting on the dependent variable.34 Cease-fires range in length from two
weeks (the first Turco-Cypriot cease-fire) to fifty years and counting (Korea).
Because wars that start and stop again are treated as separate observations, and
because multilateral wars are split into dyads, not all of the cases in the data set
are independent of one another. I correct for the statistical problem of autocorre-
lation by calculating robust standard errors,35 but a substantive caveat should also
be noted. Because the Arab-Israeli conflict has been both multilateral and oft-
repeated, much of the data set thus consists of Middle East cases. Domination of
the data set by one conflict raises issues of generalizability. However, in neither
the quantitative work, nor related case-study research have I found significant dif-
ferences between the Middle East cases and others that would skew results.36
There are forty-eight cease-fire cases in the data set. They are listed in Appen-
dix 1. Each of these cease-fires is a subject for which there are multiple observa-
tions over time, each of a year or less, for a total of 876 observations. This allows
me to record changes in military capabilities over time, the arrival or departure of
peacekeepers, or the fact that a new agreement has been reached implementing
new measures. These are known as "time-varying covariates" in the duration analy-
sis lingo. For each subject, the time spans run continuously to the start of a new
war or the end of the data at the beginning of 1998. The duration model treats
32. One interstate war from the COW list is dropped because it never reached an interstate cease-
fire. The war between Vietnam and Cambodia "ended" with the installation of a pro-Vietnam govern-
ment, but the fighting between this new government and the Khmer Rouge continued as a civil war.
33. Defined as those contributing less than one-tenth the number of troops committed by the largest
provider of troops.
34. I used COW data on when states "left" and "reentered" the war, supplemented by my research,
to determine these breaks in the fighting. It is possible that I have missed some very short-lived cease-
fires. This selection bias should work against my own argument, however, as brief cease-fires are much
more likely to be reported if accompanied by strong agreements than by weak ones.
35. These are calculated using Huber's method, with cases clustered by conflict. All of the Arab-
Israeli cases are one cluster, all of the India-Pakistan cases another, and so on. Cases are assumed to be
independent between clusters but not necessarily within clusters.
36. Where controlling for Arab-Israeli cases made a significant difference in the results, it is dis-
cussed below.

each subject as a history, focusing on whether peace survived each time period in
the history. Peace is considered to fail at the start of another COW war between
the same two belligerents. The data set is censored at the end of 1997.37 War re-
sumes eventually in twenty-one cases, and is censored in the other twenty-seven.
Data on the various aspects of agreements come from my research on each case.38
I investigated and coded the following aspects of agreements: the extent of with-
drawal of forces, demilitarized zones, arms control measures, peacekeeping (whether
a monitoring mission or a peacekeeping force, and whether the mission was new
or was left over from a previous mission before the war broke out), third-party
involvement in peacemaking or guarantees of the peace, the specificity of any agree-
ment, whether it was formal or tacit, dispute resolution procedures, confidence-
building measures, measures to control possible rogue action, and whether the
political issues over which the war was fought were settled.39 See Appendix 2.
Not all of the cease-fires are accompanied by agreements, of course. The data
set includes a number of cases in which fighting stopped with a unilateral with-
drawal, in which war simply fizzled to an end with no explicit cease-fire, or in
which fighting ended with the installation by one side of a "friendly" government
for the other (as in Hungary in 1956). In such cases, the mechanisms under dis-
cussion here are coded as zero unless measures were implemented in the absence
of an agreement.
Agreement strength is measured in two ways. One is simply an index of the
mechanisms implemented, with a point for a demilitarized zone, another for arms
control measures, half for a monitoring mission or one for an armed peacekeeping
force, and so on. This measure is crude but has the benefit of being objective and
replicable by others. It ranges from 0 to 10. The other is a more subjective coding
of the extent of the measures implemented. This measure is a five-point scale rang-
ing from none for cease-fires with no mechanisms (Russo-Hungary or Uganda-
Tanzania, for example) to very strong for formal, detailed agreements with
peacekeeping contingents, demilitarized zones, dispute resolution procedures, and
so on (the Korean Armistice and the Egyptian-Israeli agreements after 1973 fall
into this category). It is derived from a qualitative comparison of all of the cases
in the data set.40 The objective and subjective measures are highly correlated (.88).
37. The North Vietnam-South Vietnam case is censored immediately because South Vietnam ceased
to exist.
38. Sources included references surveying international conflict in the postwar era (including Ber-
covitch and Jackson 1997; Brogan 1992; Butterworth 1976; Goldstein 1992; Miall 1992; and Tillema
1991), secondary sources on each conflict, and primary documents, including cease-fire agreement
texts.
39. To prevent my own knowledge of outcomes from biasing my coding, I coded the cases "blind,"
that is, hiding proper names or other information that would allow me to identify the case. While it
was not feasible to have someone duplicate the entire data set to check inter-coder reliability, a re-
search assistant "spot checked" randomly selected cases.
40. Note that neither measure includes whether the agreement settled the political issues over which
the war was fought, which I consider separately.

Using both helps ensure that the subjective coding is not biased and that the ob-
jective coding is fairly accurate.
Data on situational or control variables come from existing data sets. A dummy
variable marks whether the war ended in a tie or in a military victory for one side.
The COST OF WAR measure is based on battle deaths, HISTORY OF CONFLICT mea-
sures the extent to which the belligerents' shared past is marked by serious dis-
putes. I include measures noting whether one side's very existence was threatened
by the war, whether the fight was over territory, whether belligerents are contigu-
ous, and whether the war involved more than two states. Following Werner, I use
the COW material capabilities data to measure changes in relative capabilities.41
Measures of expected utility were generated in EUGene.42 Appendix 2 provides
more specific details of coding and data sources.43
Findings
Baseline Prospects for Peace
With a relatively small data set, it is not possible to test all of the hypotheses
outlined above simultaneously. I begin with an assessment of the baseline pros-
pects for peace, leaving the agreement aside for the time being. Table 1 shows the
statistical results. Coefficients indicate the effect of variables on the hazard of war
resuming. Positive coefficients indicate variables associated with peace that falls
apart more quickly (a higher hazard of failing), and negative coefficients mark
variables associated with more durable peace (a lower risk of another war). To
give a sense of the relative size of effects, the right-hand column presents esti-
mated hazard ratios for variables found to have a significant effect. Hazard ratios
are interpreted relative to a baseline of one: a ratio of 0.50 indicates that the hazard
is cut in half, while a ratio of 2.0 indicates a doubling of the risk of another war.
Wars that end in a tie are much (twenty-seven times) more likely to be repeated
than those that end with a decisive victory for one side. More costly wars are
followed by substantially more durable peace, all else being equal. Peace is signifi-
cantly more fragile between belligerents with more acrimonious shared histories,
and is almost six times more precarious when one side's existence is threatened
41. Because democratic dyads never fight, there are no cease-fires between democratic states, but
some dyads become jointly democratic after a cease-fire is in place (for example, Britain and Argen-
tina after 1983). Joint democracy may make peace more durable, but the finding depends largely on
how one codes Cyprus during the extremely short-lived cease-fire in 1974. It is also called into ques-
tion by the 1999 Kargil War between India and Pakistan (which occurs after the data used here are
censored). For further discussion of these cases and the relationship between democracy and the
durability of peace, see Fortna forthcoming, chap. 3. Here, I control for the possible effects of the
democratic peace by dropping those few observations in which both states are democracies (based on
Polity data) in some tests.

by the conflict.44 Contrary to many other studies of the importance of territorial
conflict, Model 2 shows that wars over real estate are not significantly more likely
to resume than wars over other issues. Territorial disputes may be more salient
than other issues over which states rattle their swords, but not more important
than other issues over which states have already deemed it worth fighting a war.
Neighboring states are estimated to be twice as likely to fight again, but this find-
ing is not always statistically significant.45
As Werner's argument would predict, changes in relative capabilities over time
do seem to be associated with the resumption of war. But it is not entirely clear
from this finding which way the arrows run. Do changes in relative capabilities
lead to war, or does war lead to changes in relative capability? For example, was
the India-Pakistan war over Bangladesh caused by Pakistan's falling capabilities,
or did the war, which severed Pakistan in two, cause our measures of capability to
drop? Because many of the factors that go into the measure of a state's capability
(population, energy consumption, and iron and steel production, among other things)
are not likely to have an immediate effect on war-fighting capability, I lagged the
measure of the change in relative capabilities by one year (see Model 3). The pos-
itive effect on the risk of war drops away completely. In fact, the lagged variable
shows that power shifts are associated with much more durable peace. This is
probably the result of a missing data bias,46 as it is unlikely that shifts in power
are actually stabilizing. These results, however, cast significant doubt on the find-
ing that changes in relative capabilities cause peace to break down.47
The results for predictions of conflict in Buena de Mesquita and Lalman's
expected-utility international interaction game are inconsistent over various spec-
ifications of the model; in many (such as Model 4), they are associated with more
durable peace, exactly the opposite of what their predictions would expect.48 Con-
trolling for the democratic peace by dropping cases in which both sides have be-
come democratic does not significantly change other results.49
44. The latter finding is driven largely, but not entirely, by the Arab-Israeli cases.
45. While neighbors are more likely to fight in the first place, all of the states in these data have
proven themselves to have both reason to fight and the ability to reach each other militarily. It is thus
not surprising that the effects of contiguity are weaker for the resumption of war than for propensity to
fight in the first place.
46. Data for this lagged variable are missing for the first year of each cease-fire. Inclusion of this
variable thus excludes the most short-lived cease-fires, those that fail within one year.
47. This hypothesis deserves further testing with finer grain measures of military capabilities. Some
components of the COW capability index (military manpower and expenditures, for example) are likely
to affect war-fighting ability more quickly than others (those tapping industrial power). War also is
likely to affect some components more quickly than others. To further complicate the picture, it may
be that states ramp up their military capabilities in anticipation of impending war, so that changing
capabilities may be an indicator, rather than a cause, of war.
48. The results are no stronger if I generate predictions using S, as suggested by Signorino and
Ritter 1999, rather than Tau-B to measure policy similarity.
49. Democracy in one but not both states is associated with very unstable peace, but this finding is
driven entirely by the cases involving Israel and India and is not robust to alternative model specifica-
tions. While states in transition to democracy might be especially war-prone, democratization has no
significant effect on the durability of peace. See Mansfield and Snyder 1995.

These findings suggest that it will be much harder to maintain peace in a case
like the 1948 cease-fire in the Arab-Israeli War--which took place without a clear
victor, between states whose entire history was marked by violence, and with the
very existence of one side at stake--than in a case such as the Falklands War, fought
by states a long distance from each other with little previous history of militarized
conflict, ending in a very lopsided victory for Britain, with a relatively low death toll.
In sum, then, to control for the baseline prospects for peace, one needs to con-
trol for the decisiveness of victory, the cost of war, the belligerents' previous his-
tory of conflict, and whether the war threatened one side's existence. To be safe,
one might also want to control for contiguity, joint democracy, and for changes in
relative capability, though the latter might be spurious.
Agreement Strength
Table 2 shows the effects of the strength of cease-fire agreements (measured in
two different ways) on the durability of peace. Estimates of both coefficients and
hazard ratios are given. The subjective coding of agreement strength is a cate-
gorical variable (none, very weak, weak, moderate, strong). Model 1 shows the
comparison to the omitted middle category (weak). As expected, the strongest agree-
ments yield the most durable peace, and moderately strong agreements perform
better than weak ones. Compared to the median agreement (weak), moderate agree-
ments reduce the risk of another war by an estimated 57 percent (as indicated by
the hazard ratio of 0.43), and strong agreements reduce the hazard of failure by
more than 80 percent. Very weak agreements are associated with the least durable
peace, faring perhaps even worse than no agreement at all. But compared to the
middle category, peace falls apart more quickly with both very weak and no agree-
ments. These effects are jointly significant.50
The findings are even clearer if one uses the objective index of agreement strength
(Model 2). The negative and statistically significant coefficient indicates that the
stronger the agreement, the longer peace lasts, all else being equal. A unit increase
in agreement strength is associated with about a 20 percent reduction in the risk of
another war. Overall, I find fairly strong support for the hypothesis that the con-
tent of agreements matter. Even when one takes the baseline prospect for peace
into account, stronger agreements lead to more durable peace.
As this finding contrasts with Werner's finding that the existence of a peace
treaty has no significant effect on the durability of peace, it is worth exploring the
discrepancy further.51 Werner's peace treaty variable codes whether the war ended
50. Joint significance is determined with F-tests using STATA's "test" command.
51. Werner 1999. Neither the difference in time period examined, nor whether all belligerents or
only principal participants are included accounts for the discrepancy in our findings. Neither restrict-
ing her model to post-1945 cases only, nor dropping minor participants from it makes a significant
difference to her results. Adding minor participants to my data would only strengthen the finding that
strong agreements last (most of these cases involve the Korean Armistice, a very strong agreement that
has lasted a very long time).

with a peace treaty as opposed to a cease-fire or armistice, or no agreement at all.
I draw a distinction between the political content of the agreement--that is, whether
the political issues were settled (discussed below)--and the more mechanical tools
that make peace more durable even in the absence of a political settlement. The
Korean Armistice is a good example: it is a very strong (in my terms) agreement
that did not settle the underlying issue of the war.52 Plugging my variables of agree-
ment strength into Werner's model suggests tentatively that stronger agreements
yield more durable peace. The coefficient for the index of strength becomes neg-
ative, unlike the coefficient for Werner's treaty variable, indicating a reduction in
the hazard rate.53 The coefficient is not statistically significant, but with so few
cases (and particularly so few peace failures) left in the data set, neither are the
variables that Werner concludes are important. This brings us to the second issue.
In Werner's data, only twelve of sixty-three post-World War II cases experi-
ence another round of fighting. Werner does not include cease-fires that fell apart
so quickly that the new fighting was considered part of the same war. As ex-
plained above, this results in selection bias. By ignoring the resumption of fight-
ing after a two-week cease-fire during the Turco-Cypriot War, for example, or the
breakdown of the first attempt at peace during the 1948-49 Arab-Israeli War, Wern-
er's data truncates the dependent variable. Because these short-lived cease-fires
tend not to be accompanied by strong peace agreements, omitting them biases find-
ings away from the conclusion that such agreements affect the durability of peace.
By coding not just the existence of an agreement but its content, and by including
cease-fires that failed very quickly, I show that agreements matter.
Assessing Individual Peace Mechanisms
Although mechanisms to alter incentives, reduce uncertainty, and control acci-
dents are effective in the aggregate, examining the effects of each peace mecha-
nism individually is important to know how best to maintain peace. Tables 3 to 5
show the results of each mechanism in turn, controlling for the baseline prospects
for peace. Unfortunately, the small data set and problems of multicolinearity mean
it is not possible to test all of these measures simultaneously. Because many as-
pects of agreements are correlated, it is difficult to reach strong conclusions about
which measures are most effective relative to each other. For each mechanism, I
checked the results controlling for the other aspects of agreements that were highly
52. In the data set used here, the variable political settlement (discussed further below) comes clos-
est to Werner's variable. But note that the variables differ in some cases. We agree that Israel and
Egypt eventually signed a peace treaty after the Yom Kippur War, for example, but while she treats the
second Kashmir War as ending with a peace treaty, I code the Tashkent Agreement as a cease-fire, as it
did not settle the issue of Kashmir.
53. Results of tests using Werner's data are available online at (http://www.columbia.edu/~vpf4/
scraps.htm). The results are similar for the categorical coding of agreement strength.

correlated with the measure under consideration.54 Including correlated aspects of
agreements solves the omitted variable bias but introduces multicolinearity, which
reduces the efficiency of the estimates. Note that while the trade-off between mul-
ticolinearity and omitted variable bias makes it difficult to assess precisely the
relative merits of each aspect of agreements, it does not call into doubt the general
finding that agreements matter in the construction of durable peace. The bias arises
because the omitted agreement mechanisms also affect the durability of peace,
contradicting the null hypothesis that agreements do not matter.
As Table 3 indicates, withdrawing forces from the cease-fire line may reduce
the risk of another war, but not significantly so. Troops withdraw to the status
quo ante in about one-third of the cases examined here, suggesting that the norm
against taking (and keeping) territory by force is fairly strong. Failure to with-
draw from land captured during war has often laid the seeds for another round
of fighting (the continuing strife over territories occupied by Israel in 1967 being
the best example). But returning to the prewar lines does not ensure peace.
Israel and Egypt fought again after Israel withdrew from the Sinai in 1956, for
example.
Demilitarized zones (DMZs) to separate troops help foster durable peace. Even
partial or very limited zones can help reduce the danger of accidents and skir-
mishes (for example, the number of incidents between India and Pakistan dropped
markedly when narrow DMZs were established after the first and second Kashmir
wars), but this effect is only marginally significant. However, full DMZs (defined
as those 2 km wide or more, running the full length of the cease-fire line) have a
clear stabilizing effect, reducing the hazard of another war by about 90 percent.
DMZs have contributed to peace between El Salvador and Honduras after the Foot-
ball War, in Korea, and between Israel and Syria in the Golan Heights. Arms con-
trol measures have not reduced the likelihood of recurrent war.55
Nor have measures to establish internal control over potential rogue groups made
peace more stable. A number of cease-fire agreements specify that each side is
responsible for any hostile action coming from its territory. Such statements are
not effective at making states rein in irregular forces; in fact these statements are
more likely an indicator of a serious problem with rogue groups. In some cases
(such as the Football War), there is evidence that concrete measures to disarm
irregular forces can help cement peace. But in many cases, the problem has not
been one of "involuntary defection" by rogue groups, but of the voluntary use of
irregular forces to carry out covert aggression. This problem, especially promi-
nent in India and Pakistan and in the Middle East, has not been effectively dealt
with.
54. These checks produce far more output than can be printed here (complete data is available on-
line at (http://www.columbia.edu/~vpf4/scraps.htm). Where findings are not robust to these changes
in model specification, I note this in the discussion below.
55. The sign of the coefficient for arms control flip-flops depending on model specification.

Durability of Peace 359
The effect of third parties on peace depends on their level of involvement. Out-
siders often help mediate a cease-fire, as the United States did for Israel and Egypt
in 1970 to end the War of Attrition, or as Iran did in Armenia and Azerbaijan in
1992. Third parties may also pressure client states to stop fighting, as in the Sinai
War and the Iran-Iraq War. This level of involvement may help warring states reach
a cease-fire to begin with, but it does not help them keep it. If anything, cease-
fires reached with outside mediation appear to be more likely to break down quickly
(the coefficient is positive but not significant). Explicit guarantees, though not ter-
ribly frequent, are much more successful. There are no cases of peace failing when
an outside state has explicitly underwritten the cease-fire. Unlike in civil wars,
such guarantees are not necessary56 (there are many cases of durable peace with-
out them), but they clearly help reduce the risk of another war.
Table 4 shows the effect of peacekeeping. The international community has sent
monitors or armed peacekeepers to about two-thirds of the interstate cease-fires in
the post-World War II era. These efforts have helped keep the peace, but the ef-
fectiveness of peacekeeping can be easily undermined. The presence of monitors
appears to lengthen the duration of peace.57 However, the presence of armed peace-
keepers does not have a statistically significant effect. A look at peacekeeping's
record suggests an important difference between missions deployed at the time of
the cease-fire, and those already in place before the war broke out. More than half
of peacekeeping's failures (that is, cases where peacekeepers were present and
war resumed) were those of missions deployed long before the cease-fire. In many
cases these missions were largely inactive and had been discredited by their ear-
lier failures. The UN Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP), had been deployed in 1964 to
help keep peace between Turkish and Greek Cypriots in an internal conflict. It
could do nothing to prevent military action by Turkey in 1974, nor was its pres-
ence effective in maintaining a cease-fire in the midst of the Turco-Cypriot War.
Both the UN Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) in the Middle East and
the UN Military Observer Group (UNMOGIP) in Kashmir were effective in the
early years of their deployments, but after more bouts of fighting--in 1956 and
especially 1967 in the Middle East, and in 1965 in Kashmir--these missions were
rendered useless. Both missions remain in place today, but are inactive.
If one drops cases in which peacekeeping contingents were already deployed be-
fore the war (for example, keeping the first Arab-Israeli cease-fire when UNTSO
was first established but dropping subsequent cases in which UNTSO is the only
peacekeeping mission), one can see that new peacekeeping missions have been quite
effective.58 Of course, new peacekeeping missions are not foolproof, or there would
56. Walter 2001.
57. This finding is not as strong when the Arab-Israeli conflict is controlled for. Deploying a larger
number of peacekeepers seems to reduce the risk of another war, but this effect is not statistically
significant (results not shown).
58. Note that because almost all of the omitted cases are wars that ended with a decisive victory but
were repeated, the hazard ratio for the variable tie is highly exaggerated.

results they report in Table 4 suggest that both active and operational involvement by the UN reduce
the risk of another dispute.

The jury is still out on the effectiveness of confidence-building measures, be-
cause they are relatively rare. The risk of another war appears to be lower in cases
where measures such as notification of troop rotations or hotlines between mili-
tary commanders have been implemented (see Table 5). But these measures have

been employed in only a few cases, making it is possible that this finding is merely
an artifact of the data.
I examined two types of dispute resolution between belligerents: that provided
by ongoing third-party mediation after a cease-fire has been reached;60 and joint
commissions made up of representatives from both states in the war. The former
is not an effective dispute resolution tool; in fact it is associated with peace that is
significantly more likely to break down quickly. But joint commissions such as
those set up after the Korean War, between Ethiopia and Somalia in 1988, or be-
tween El Salvador and Honduras in 1980, have been much more successful. The
history of the armistice commissions between Israel and its Arab neighbors sug-
gests that willingness to work within such a forum can provide an important sig-
nal of intentions. These commissions worked well in their early years to settle
disputes over land use and fishing and farming rights, as well as to handle small
incidents between soldiers. Conversely the breakdown of these regimes both sig-
naled and contributed to increasing hostility on both sides.61
All else being equal, the more specific the cease-fire agreement, the longer peace
tends to last. More specific agreements also tend to implement other measures to
keep peace, but the finding that specificity reduces the hazard of another war holds
up even when these other measures are controlled for. The most detailed agree-
ments, such as the Korean Armistice and the Israeli-Egyptian peace agreement,
have been followed by lasting peace. Cases of medium detail (China-India, the
Gulf War, and the two Kashmir Wars, for example) have had mixed success, and
the much less detailed agreements (for example, the Six Day War and the first
Turco-Cypriot cease-fire) have tended to fail quickly. Demarcating the exact loca-
tion of the cease-fire line put a halt to efforts on both sides to push for slight
advantages in the early days of each cease-fire between India and Pakistan.62 Of
course, deliberate attacks cannot be stopped by specifying the location of the cease-
fire line, but defining compliance can clearly help prevent skirmishing as both
sides try to improve their positions.
Peace tends to last longer after formal agreements than after tacit or unilaterally
declared cease-fires, all else being equal, but the difference is not significant sta-
tistically, nor terribly robust to different model specifications. Concern about in-
ternational audience costs often plays a role in states' decisions about whether,
when, and how to fight each other. India and Pakistan, for example, have both
tried hard not to appear as the aggressor in their repeated wars, using proxy forces
rather than regular troops to initiate hostilities.63 These two states have also fought

surgency in East Pakistan (Bangladesh) in 1971.

in places where their formal agreement left loopholes, as on the Siachen Glacier
in the early 1980s.64
However, formalizing a cease-fire may not be crucial for invoking international
audience costs. The general norm against aggression means that costs may be paid
even for breaking an informal cease-fire. The international reaction has often been
muted, either by great powers turning a blind eye for strategic reasons (especially
during the Cold War), or by a UN reluctant to threaten its impartiality by naming
an aggressor.65 Formalism may, therefore, not be the best way to test for the role
of international audience costs.
In sum, arms control, third-party mediation, and attempts to control irregular
forces have not helped maintain peace, and may in fact be associated with espe-
cially fragile peace. Confidence-building measures, formalizing an agreement, and
withdrawal of forces may help, but the evidence to support their role is unclear.
The most effective tools for maintaining peace in the aftermath of war are demili-
tarized zones, explicit third-party guarantees, peacekeeping, joint commissions for
dispute resolution, and making the cease-fire specific.
Political Settlement
Not surprisingly, political agreement on the issues over which the war was fought
leads to very durable peace (see Table 6). In fact, there are no cases in the wars
examined here in which both sides agreed explicitly to a political settlement and
war later resumed. But, as mentioned earlier, such settlement is quite rare in the
post-World War II period. Only three wars led to an explicit agreement on the
basic dispute over which the war was fought: the Yom Kippur War between Israel
and Egypt; the Iran-Iraq War, in which Iraq conceded the Shatt al'-Arab waterway
to secure its flank with the outbreak of the Gulf War; and the Gulf War itself, in
which Iraq formally renounced its claim to Kuwait when it surrendered.66 Wars
that end leaving the basic issues unsettled, as in the Korean Armistice, have been
the norm rather than the exception. Even if one includes settlements imposed uni-
laterally by a decisive victor (but without official acceptance by the defeated side,
as in the Falklands), settlement is rather rare.67 This de facto category also ap-
64. Lamb 1991, 325-26. The cease-fire line is not marked on the glacier, both because the territory
is so inhospitable, and because specifying a terminus would require agreement on the disputed border
with China.
65. A blatant example of this was the UN's decision not to blame Pakistan for its role in starting the
1965 war with India. For Secretary General U Thant's rationale, see UN document S/6651 (3 Septem-
ber 1965), 7.
66. In a few other cases, belligerents eventually settled their political conflict many years after the
war ended, as Israel and Jordan did in 1994.
67. The basic issue of the war has been settled unilaterally in eight wars (nine dyads) in these data:
Russia-Hungary, China-India, Vietnam (North versus South), India and Pakistan in 1971, the second
round of the Turco-Cypriot War, Uganda-Tanzania, the Falklands War, and the second part of the Azeri-
Armenian War.

the Kashmir issue, which continues to be actively contested.

lying issues remain disputed, it is the other mechanisms examined in this study
that can be used to maintain peace.
Duration Dependence
Intuitively, one might expect peace to be most precarious immediately after a cease-
fire and to stabilize over time. The antagonism generated by the fighting is most
raw just after hostilities end, and once things settle down, states should have a
somewhat easier time maintaining peace. This would suggest negative "duration
dependence"; that is, a cease-fire's likelihood of failing (given that it has held thus
far) goes down over time. But if Fearon and others are right that one of the rea-
sons states fight costly wars is the inability to gauge each other's capabilities and
resolve (the combination of private information and incentives to misrepresent),
then one might expect peace to be easiest to maintain in the early stages.69 The
war just fought will have revealed information about military capabilities and po-
litical resolve. Over time, however, uncertainty will creep back in. This would
lead one to expect positive duration dependence for the survival of peace; the risk
of another war should increase with time.70
The shape parameter p, specifically whether it is greater than or less than one,
gives an estimate of whether the risk of another war goes up or down, or stays the
same over the course of a cease-fire. In most of the models presented here, the
shape parameter p is less than one, indicating that the hazard rate is decreasing.
The shape parameter p is only greater than one in models that are likely affected
by missing data bias. This finding fits better with the intuitive notion that peace is
most fragile early on and solidifies over time than with the hypothesis derived
from the perspective that sees war as a problem of information. But one should
note that the value of this parameter is not always statistically significant. The risk
of war may simply be constant over time.71
Conclusion
Are some war-torn areas simply doomed to repeated conflict and warfare, or is
there something that can be done to improve the chances for peace? The findings
of this article warrant optimism. Peace is hard to maintain among deadly enemies,
but mechanisms implemented in the context of cease-fire agreements can help re-
duce the risk of another war. Peace is precarious, but it is possible. Agreements
are not merely scraps of paper, their content affects whether peace lasts or war
resumes.

71. Note that independent variables should "soak up" or explain some of the duration dependence,
so it is not surprising that in more completely specified models, p is closer to one.

The job of building peace is harder in some cases than in others. It is more
difficult when wars end in stalemates, when states' previous history is riddled with
conflict, and when war can threaten the very existence of one side. It seems to be
harder for neighbors, but it is easier when states have just fought a very deadly
war, giving a greater incentive to avoid further bloodshed.
But given these givens, states can act to improve the chances for peace. I have
focused on measures that: alter incentives by raising the cost of an attack either
physically or politically; reduce uncertainty by specifying compliance, regulating
activities that are likely to cause tension, providing credible signals of intention;
or help prevent or manage accidents from spiraling back to war. Do these mea-
sures help encourage durable peace? I find that, in general, they do. All else being
equal, peace lasts longer when stronger agreements, implementing more of these
measures, are in place. A counterargument suggests that strong agreements are
only associated with durable peace because they are implemented in the easy cases.
But the effects of agreements do not wash out when the baseline prospects for
peace are controlled for.
While some international relations scholars might be surprised to learn that states
can institute measures to overcome the obstacles to peace, practitioners probably
know this already. For them, the value of this research is in its lessons about which
mechanisms work better than others. Because these measures are often imple-
mented in conjunction with each other, one cannot reach conclusions about this that
are as strong as one might like. But the history of cease-fires over the past half-
century suggests that creating buffer zones between opposing armies is quite ef-
fective. Making the terms of the cease-fire, including the location of the cease-fire
line, as specific as possible is also important, as is setting up joint commissions to
discuss the inevitable conflicts and misunderstandings that arise in the aftermath
of fighting. Confidence-building measures, formal agreements, and withdrawal of
forces do not hurt, but the evidence that these measure help is less clear-cut.
For their part, outsiders interested in helping belligerents maintain peace can
improve its chances by providing an explicitly stated guarantee of the cease-fire,
and by deploying international monitors or troops as peacekeepers. But third par-
ties should be aware that mediation to reach a cease-fire may be counterproduc-
tive in the long run. Peacekeeping can easily become discredited. Leaving a mission
in place after it has failed does little to bolster the prospects for peace.
That states can implement measures to reduce the risk of another war raises the
question of whether they can do more to prevent war breaking out in the first
place. If demilitarized zones or peacekeeping can help maintain peace after war,
can they do so beforehand? Obviously one cannot answer this question defini-
tively without a wider study, but at least in theory, the measures discussed above
should be effective preemptively. The challenge is likely to be in convincing states
to implement them. It is normal, and therefore politically more acceptable, to take
measures to ensure peace in the aftermath of war. Giving up territory to create a
buffer zone or allowing international peacekeepers to infringe on their sover-
eignty before hostilities break out, of course, is more difficult.

Durability of Peace 367
Whether or not the measures examined here can help prevent war in the first
place, I have shown that measures to reduce uncertainty, alter incentives, and man-
age accidents can help maintain peace in the hardest cases--among deadly en-
emies with strong incentives to take advantage of each other and in an atmosphere
of deep mistrust. Maintaining peace is difficult, but even bitter foes can and do
institute measures to avoid another war. Creating a durable peace requires work,
but it is possible.
