Associations of Television Viewing With Eating
Behaviors in the 2009 Health Behaviour
in School-aged Children Study
Leah M. Lipsky, PhD, MHS; Ronald J. Iannotti, PhD
Objective: To examine associations of television view-
ing with eating behaviors in a representative sample of
US adolescents.
Design: Cross-sectional survey.
Setting: Public and private schools in the United States
during the 2009-2010 school year.
Participants: A total of 12 642 students in grades 5 to 10
(mean [SD] age, 13.4[0.09] years; 86.5% participation).
Main Exposures: Television viewing (hours per day)
and snacking while watching television (days per week).
Main Outcome Measures: Eating (1 instance per
day) fruit, vegetables, sweets, and sugary soft drinks; eat-
ing at a fast food restaurant (1 d/wk); and skipping
breakfast (1 d/wk).
Results: Television viewing was inversely related to in-
take of fruit (adjusted odds ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88-
0.96) and vegetables (0.95; 0.91-1.00) and positively re-
lated to intake of candy (1.18; 1.14-1.23) and fast food
(1.14; 1.09-1.19) and skipping breakfast (1.06; 1.02-
1.10) after adjustment for socioeconomic factors, com-
puter use, and physical activity. Television snacking was
related to increased intake of fruit (adjusted odds ratio,
1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10), candy (1.20; 1.16-1.24), soda
(1.15; 1.11-1.18), and fast food (1.09; 1.06-1.13), inde-
pendent of television viewing. The relationships of tele-
vision viewing with fruit and vegetable intake and with
skipping breakfast were essentially unchanged after ad-
justment for television snacking; the relationships with
intake of candy, soda, and fast food were moderately at-
tenuated. Age and race/ethnicity modified relationships
of television viewing with soda and fast food intake and
with skipping breakfast.
Conclusion: Television viewing was associated with a
cluster of unhealthy eating behaviors in US adolescents
after adjustment for socioeconomic and behavioral
covariates.

DIETARY INTAKES OF US
youth fall short of recom-
mendations for whole
fruit, whole grains, le-
gumes, and dark green
and orange vegetables and exceed recom-
mendations for fat, sodium, and added sug-
ars,1-3 increasing the risk of obesity and
chronic disease throughout the life-
span.4-12 Further understanding of the fac-
tors contributing to youth eating behav-
iors is necessary to improve dietary intakes
and associated health outcomes.
Television viewing (TVV) in youth has
been associated with unhealthy dietary in-
take and food preferences that may track
into early adulthood.13 Positive associa-
tions have been found with intakes of fast
food,14-18 soda,16,17,19-27 refined grains,28 and
energy-dense foods,17,20,25,27,29,30 as well as
with energy intake.6,16,25 In addition, TVV
has been inversely associated with fruit and
vegetable intake.16,19-21,25,27,31
A primary explanation for these find-
ings is the impact of exposure to food ad-
vertisements, which highlight primarily
energy-dense, nutrient-poor products and
influence food preferences and intake in
a variety of youth populations.32-34 Eating
while watching TV is another hypoth-
esized mechanism for observed relation-
ships between TVV and diet,17,29,35,36 al-
though, to our knowledge, this has not
been tested in a nationally representative
sample of US adolescents. In addition, de-
spite evidence of sociodemographic dif-
ferences in TVV37,38 and eating behav-
iors,39,40 few studies have investigated
potential effect modification by these vari-
ables.6,41,42

The objective of this study was to examine associa-
tions between TVV and eating behaviors in a nationally
representative sample of US adolescents. We also sought
to investigate differences across age, sex, and race/
ethnicity and to ascertain the role of snacking while watch-
ing TV. Specific eating behaviors examined included in-
take of fruit, vegetables, sugar-sweetened soda, and sweets;
eating at a fast food restaurant; and skipping breakfast.
METHODS
STUDY DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS
The Health Behaviour in School-aged Children Study is a sur-
vey of adolescents conducted every 4 years in the United States
beginning in 1995 to monitor and understand youth health be-
haviors, their social context, health, and well-being. Data col-
lection and procedural details have been published else-
where.43 We used data from the 2009-2010 US survey, which
included a nationally representative sample of 12 642 stu-
dents in grades 5 through 10 (mean [SD] age, 13.4 [0.09] years).
The sample was selected using a 3-stage stratified clustered sam-
pling procedure, with school districts as the primary sampling
unit. The survey was administered in classrooms by indepen-
dent research staff. Black/African American and Hispanic stu-
dents were oversampled to produce reliable estimates for these
groups. There was 86.5% participation among 14 620 eligible
students. Questions were validated in several countries in tar-
get age groups. Youth assent and active or passive parental con-
sent were obtained as required by participating school dis-
tricts. The institutional review board of the Eunice Kennedy
Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Devel-
opment approved study procedures.
VARIABLES
Television viewing time was assessed by asking (separately for
weekdays and weekends), "About how many hours a day do
you usually watch television (including videos and DVDs) in
your free time?". Response categories included "none at all,"
"about half an hour a day," "about 1 hour a day," "about 2 hours
a day," and so on to "about 7 or more hours a day." Similar
questions and identical responses were used to assess com-
puter use. The survey asked (separately for weekdays and week-
ends), "About how many hours a day do you usually play games
on a computer or games console (PlayStation, Xbox, Game-
Cube, etc) in your free time?" and "About how many hours a
day do you usually use a computer for chatting online, Inter-
net, e-mailing, homework, etc, in your free time?". Weekday
and weekend responses were combined to obtain average daily
hours of TVV and computer use. The combined variable for
computer use for games and other purposes was used in final
analyses because of the lack of an independent contribution of
separate computer use variables in regression models.
Eating behaviors were assessed by asking, "How many times
a week do you usually eat or drink . . . " followed by "fruits,"
"vegetables," "sweets (candy or chocolate)," and "Coke or other
soft drinks that contain sugar" (soda), with response options
for "never," "less than once a week," "once a week," "2 to 4
days a week," "5 to 6 days a week," "once a day, every day,"
and "every day, more than once." Skipping breakfast was as-
sessed by asking (separately for weekdays and weekends), "How
often do you usually have breakfast (more than a glass of milk
or fruit juice)?". Weekday response options included "I never
have breakfast during weekdays," "1 day," "2 days," "3 days,"
"4 days," or "5 days." Weekend response options included "I
never have breakfast during the weekend," "I usually have break-
fast on only 1 day of the weekend (Saturday OR Sunday)," and
"I usually have breakfast on both weekend days (Saturday AND
Sunday)." Weekday and weekend responses were combined to
create a single variable indicating whether breakfast was skipped
at least 1 day per week. Eating at a fast food restaurant was as-
sessed by asking, "How often do you eat in a fast food restau-
rant (for example, McDonald's, KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell)?,"
with response options for "never," "rarely (less than once a
month)," "once a month," "2 to 3 times a month," "once a week,"
"2 to 4 days a week," and "5 or more days a week."
Snacking during TVV and computer use were assessed in
participants in grades 7 through 10 by asking, "How often do
you eat a snack while you . . . " followed by "watch TV (in-
cluding videos and DVDs)" and "work or play on a computer
or games console," with response options for "never," "less than
once a week," "1 to 2 days a week," "3 to 4 days a week," "5 to
6 days a week," and "every day." Leisure-time vigorous physi-
cal activity was assessed by asking, "Outside school hours: how
many hours a week do you usually exercise in your free time
so much that you get out of breath or sweat?," with responses
for "none," "about half an hour," "about 1 hour," "about 2 to
3 hours," "about 4 to 6 hours," and "7 hours or more."
Students reported age, sex, race ("What do you consider your
race to be?," with response options for "black or African Ameri-
can" [hereafter referred to as black], "white," "Asian," "Ameri-
can Indian or Alaska native," "Native Hawaiian or other Pa-
cific Islander," and "other" with a blank space provided), and
ethnicity ("What do you consider your ethnicity to be?," with
response options for "Hispanic or Latino" and "not Hispanic
or Latino"). We combined responses to create a 4-category race/
ethnicity variable: non-Hispanic white (white), non-Hispanic
black/African American (black/African American), Hispanic, and
other. Socioeconomic status was assessed by the Family Afflu-
ence Scale, a measure with demonstrated content and external
validity44 that was developed for the Health Behaviour in School-
aged Children Study on the basis of responses to questions about
computer and automobile ownership, whether the student shares
a bedroom, and frequency of family vacations.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Descriptive statistics were calculated and compared by sex, age,
and race/ethnicity using regression analysis for continuous out-
comes and the Pearson/Wald test for binary outcomes. Mul-
tiple logistic regressions assessed relationships between TVV
(hours per day) and daily intake of fruit, vegetables, sweets,
and soda, as well as skipping breakfast at least 1 day per week
and eating at a fast food restaurant at least 1 day per week. We
examined interactions of TVV with age, sex, and race/ethnicity
withmultiplicativeinteractiontermsandstratifiedanalyseswhere
warranted. Relationships between TVV and dietary behaviors
after controlling for frequency of TV and computer snacking
were explored in grades 7 through 10; we further examined the
interaction of TVV and TV snacking in this subpopulation. All
independent variables were continuous except sex and race/
ethnicity. Analyses accounted for the complex survey sam-
pling design using STATA, version 11 (StataCorp).
RESULTS
There were significant sociodemographic differences in
most eating behaviors except fast food, which was not
different by sex but was more frequent for older (aged
13 years) vs younger (13 years) participants and for
racial/ethnicgroupscomparedwithwhiteyouth(P.001)

(Table 1 and Table 2). Odds of daily intake of fruit
and vegetables were higher for younger than older par-
ticipants, for girls compared with boys, and for white and
other groups compared with black and Hispanic youth.
Odds of daily intake of sweets were highest for older vs
younger youth, for girls vs boys, and for black youth com-
pared with other racial/ethnic groups. Odds of drinking
soda at least daily were highest for older vs younger youth,
for boys vs girls, and for black and Hispanic youth com-
pared with other racial/ethnic groups. Skipping break-
fast was more common for older than younger partici-
pants, for girls vs boys, and for black, Hispanic, and
"other" youth vs white participants.
Television viewing did not differ by age group but was
lowerforgirlsthanboys(approximately0.1h/d)andhigher
for black participants vs other racial/ethnic groups (ap-
proximately1.0-1.4 h/d). Computer use was lower for
youngervsolderparticipants,forgirlsvsboys,andforwhite
vs other racial/ethnic groups. Television snacking did not
differ by sex or age but was more frequent for black youth
vs other racial/ethnic groups. Computer snacking was less
frequent for girls than boys (approximately0.25 d/wk) and
more frequent for black participants vs other ethnic/
racial groups (approximately0.8-1.2 d/wk). Leisure-time
vigorous physical activity was lower for girls vs boys (ap-
proximately0.4 h/wk) and higher for white participants
vsotherracial/ethnicgroups(approximately0.2-0.4h/wk).
Television viewing time was inversely related to fruit
and vegetable intake and positively related to sweets and
soda intake, fast food intake, and skipping breakfast in
models adjusted for computer use, physical activity, age,
sex, family affluence, and race/ethnicity (Table 3). Re-
lationships differed by age and race/ethnicity (Figure);
we did not find differences by sex. Relationships with soda
(Figure, A) and fast food (Figure, B) intake and with skip-
ping breakfast (Figure, C) differed according to race/
ethnicity, whereas relationships with skipping break-
fast differed as well by age (Figure, C). There was a positive
relationship of TVV with soda intake for all race/
ethnicities, although the relationship was weaker for black
(adjusted odds ratio,1.13; 95% CI,1.05-1.21) com-
pared with white (1.30; 1.22-1.39) youth (P=.001). Tele-
vision viewing time was positively related to fast food in
white youth (adjusted odds ratio,1.19; 95% CI,1.12-
1.27) and in Hispanic youth (1.10; 1.05-1.15); the rela-
tionship with fast food was not significant for black youth.
Skipping breakfast was not related to TVV in youth aged
13 or older (1.03; 0.99-1.07). In participants younger than
13, there was a positive relationship between TVV and
skipping breakfast in white youth (adjusted odds ratio,
1.21; 95% CI, 1.12-1.31) but an inverse relationship in
black youth and no significant relationship in Hispanic
youth (1.01; 0.97-1.35) (Figure, C). Estimates were simi-
lar between white and other participants.
Television viewing time and TV snacking were inde-
pendently related to eating behaviors in participants in
grades 7 through 10 in adjusted models (Table 4). Tele-
vision snacking was positively related to daily intake of

fruit, candy, and soda and to fast food but was unrelated
to vegetable intake and skipping breakfast. Indepen-
dent relationships of TVV with intake of candy and soda
and with fast food were moderately attenuated but re-
mained statistically significant after adjustment for TV
and computer snacking (relationships with eating be-
haviors unadjusted for TV and computer snacking were
similar in participants in grades 7 through 10 as in the
overall sample, so separate estimates are not reported).
Independent relationships of TVV with fruit and veg-
etable intake and skipping breakfast were essentially un-
changed after adjustment for TV and computer snack-
ing. We found no interactions between TVV and TV
snacking for any eating behavior (results not shown).
COMMENT
This study provides estimates of associations of TVV and
eating behaviors in a diverse representative sample of US
adolescents. Television viewing time was associated with
lower odds of consuming fruit or vegetables daily and

models adjusted for computer use, physical activity, age,
sex, race/ethnicity, and family affluence. The relation-
ship of TVV with this unhealthy combination of eating
behaviors may contribute to the documented relation-
ship of TVV with cardiometabolic risk factors.4,45,46
Many of our prevalence estimates vary somewhat from
previously reported findings, likely because of differ-
ences in assessment methods. Our estimates of TVV (2.4
h/d) and computer use (2.8 h/d) are similar to and more
than an hour greater, respectively, than previous esti-
mates.38,47 Reported vigorous physical activity in our
sample is substantially lower than previous estimates of
moderate to vigorous physical activity.38,47-49 Report of
skipping breakfast in our sample (54.8%1 d/wk) was
higher than a recent National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey estimate (20%).50 In addition, our es-
timate of frequency of eating at a fast food restaurant is
lower than findings of a study of California adolescents,
in which 46% reported eating fast food at least 2 times
per week51 and recent estimates from a nationally rep-
resentative sample reporting a mean 2 to 3 fast food meals
per week,52,53 although multiple fast food meals may be
consumed on a single day.
Relationships of TVV with soda intake, fast food, and
breakfast behaviors differed according to race/ethnicity.
The relationship with soda intake was attenuated for black
participants compared with white participants, al-
though relationships were positive for all groups. In ad-
dition, the relationship of TVV with fast food was not sig-
nificant for black youth, whereas this relationship was
positive in other racial/ethnic groups. We found differ-
ential relationships of TVV with skipping breakfast by
both race/ethnicity and age. Among respondents younger
than 13, TVV was positively related to skipping break-
fast in white adolescents but inversely related to skip-

ping breakfast in black adolescents. There was no rela-
tionship in Hispanic adolescents or in those aged 13 or
older of any race/ethnicity. These findings are poten-
tially explained by a relationship of TVV with sleep du-
ration and morning sleepiness in youth that may vary with
respect to factors associated with child age and race/
ethnicity.54 Our results indicated that relationships of TVV
and intake of fruit and vegetables did not differ accord-
ing to race/ethnicity, contrary to findings of a previous
study using data from the 1999 national Youth Risk Be-
havior Survey.42 In addition, relationships were not dif-
ferent according to sex, as has been suggested in previ-
ous research.6,41 Likely because of the heterogeneous
make-up of the "other" subgroup, we found few differ-
ences from white participants, apart from overall lower
odds of drinking soda daily and higher odds of skipping
breakfast. Differential associations by race/ethnicity sug-
gest the importance of social, cultural, or other contex-
tual factors42,55 that may contribute to variability in as-
sociations of TVV with eating behaviors. However, despite
differential associations by sociodemographic factors, our
findings of associations of TVV and eating behaviors across
all races/ethnicities were nearly universally inconsistent
with healthful eating patterns.
Our results demonstrated relationships of TV snack-
ing with several eating behaviors after adjustment for TVV,
computer use, physical activity, computer snacking, and
sociodemographic characteristics. Although a measure
of overall snacking frequency was not available, our find-
ing of independent relationships of eating behaviors with
both TV and computer snacking suggest that these mea-
sures represent specific modes of snacking rather than
serving as proxies for overall snacking. Results indicat-
ing positive relationships of TV snacking with candy and
soda intake and with eating at a fast food restaurant sup-
port previous research documenting adverse associa-
tions of eating while watching TV and nutritional qual-
ity of foods consumed.20,21,56,57 Previous experimental
research has also demonstrated a positive association of
eating while watching TV on food quantity consumed in
undergraduates29 and children.36 This evidence sug-
gests TV snacking may influence the amount and qual-
ity of food consumed.
Relationships of TVV with eating behaviors were es-
sentially unchanged after adjustment for TV snacking,
and we found no evidence of effect modification be-
tween TVV and TV snacking, suggesting that TV snack-
ing does not fully account for relationships between TVV
and eating behaviors. This evidence, together with our
finding that TVV was strongly and positively related to
the intake of highly advertised foods and either weakly
related or unrelated to rarely advertised foods, supports
a hypothesized influence of TV food advertisement ex-
posure on dietary intake consistent with experimental re-
search.58,59 Although data indicate a recent decrease in
adolescents' exposure to candy and soda advertise-
ments, exposure to fast food restaurant advertisements
has increased.60 In addition, the nutritional quality of ad-
vertised foods is poor,33,34,61 and fruit and vegetable ad-
vertisements are essentially nonexistent.34,60,62-64 Alter-
natively, these findings may reflect a clustering of
unhealthy behaviors related to unobserved factors, such
as an increased tendency to snack during essentially un-
occupied time or preferential selection of foods condu-
cive to snacking. Associations of TVV and TV snacking
with eating behaviors were evident after adjustment for
severalcovariatesintendedtoreduceconfoundingbychar-
acteristics such as general preference for health and re-
lated behaviors, although the potential for residual bias
persists in observational research.
Interpretation of these findings must take into ac-
count the relative strengths and weaknesses of this study.
Our findings rely on a brief assessment of dietary intake
rather than a more detailed method (eg, food frequency
questionnaire or dietary recall), which may have hin-
dered our ability to detect significant relationships. An
important limitation is the cross-sectional study design,
which does not allow for determination of causality be-
cause of the inability to establish temporality and the po-
tential for confounding by unobserved factors. Thus, we
cannot rule out, for example, the possibility that youth
with poor dietary behaviors, including a greater ten-
dency toward snacking, are more likely to watch TV. How-
ever, previous interventions to reduce TVV in children
and adolescents have shown evidence of a beneficial in-
fluence on eating while watching TV65,66 as well as on total
energy intake41,67 and fruit and vegetable intake,41,68 sup-
porting a causal role of TVV on dietary intake. In addi-
tion, the internal validity of our findings is strength-
ened by our adjustment for several behavioral and
socioeconomicconfounders.Ourstudyisfurtherstrength-
ened by the high participation rate and the use of a rep-
resentative sample of US adolescents, including over-
sampling of black and Hispanic youth to enable subgroup
analysis.
These findings show that TVV is related to a cluster
of unhealthy eating behaviors in US adolescents after con-
trolling for TV snacking, computer snacking, socioeco-
nomic variables, computer use, and physical activity. Re-
lationships of TVV with eating behaviors were modified
by age and race/ethnicity, suggesting the importance of
cultural or social factors. Future research should eluci-
date the independent contributions of TVV, food adver-
tising, and TV snacking on dietary intake in this popu-
lation. If these relationships are causal, efforts to reduce
TVV or to modify the nutritional content of advertised
foods may lead to substantial improvements in adoles-
cents' dietary intake.
