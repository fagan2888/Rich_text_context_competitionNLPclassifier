OBJECTIVE -- To investigate the association between stature-related measurements (height,
leg length, and leg length­to­height ratio) and adiposity, insulin resistance, and glucose
intolerance.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of a
nationally representative sample of 7,424 adults aged 40­74 years, from the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988­1994). The main outcome measures were
percent body fat, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and glucose
intolerance based on the World Health Organization's 1985 criteria for an oral glucose tolerance
test.
RESULTS -- Shorter height and leg length, and lower leg length­to­height ratio, were asso-
ciated with higher percent body fat, especially in women. Lower leg length­to­height ratio was
associated with greater insulin resistance estimated by HOMA-IR. In multinomial regression
models adjusting for potential confounders, including percent body fat, the relative prevalence
of type 2 diabetes per 1-SD lower values in height, leg length, and leg length­to­height ratio were
1.10 (95% CI 0.94­0.29), 1.17 (0.98­1.39), and 1.19 (1.02­1.39), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS -- Our study supports the hypothesis that adult markers of prepubertal
growth, especially leg length­to­height ratio, are associated with adiposity, insulin resistance,
and type 2 diabetes in the general U.S. population.

Barker et al. (1) have hypothesized an
association between impaired nutri-
tion in utero and later development
of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascu-
lar disease, hypertension, and diabetes.
Children who are born small and then
display "catch-up growth" are thought to
be at highest risk (2,3). To facilitate the
epidemiologic study of these hypotheses,
it is helpful to focus on adult traits that are
indicators of childhood development.
Stature is one such trait.
Adult stature and its components re-
flect childhood growth patterns: leg
length is an indicator of prepubertal
growth (4), evidence of which is usually
hard to obtain directly in adulthood. Nor-
mal growth curves show that leg length-
ening slows at about 13 years of age for
girls and 16 years of age for boys (4). The
ratio of sitting height to leg length falls
rapidly between birth and 4 years of age
(5,6). A recent study showed that attained
leg length was positively associated with
having been breast-fed (7,8) and with en-
ergy intake at 4 years of age (8).
Several studies have established an
association between short stature in
adulthood and the risk of obesity (9­11),
insulin resistance (11,12), and glucose in-
tolerance (10,13­22). Furthermore, some
studies have suggested an association
with leg length in particular (9,10,12,22).
However, previous studies of anthropom-
etry and glucose metabolism focused only
on gestational diabetes (17­19,22) or
used samples of only men (12) or only
women (10,11). None used samples of
the general U.S. population (9­22), and
many studies did not account for the po-
tentially confounding effects of socioeco-
nomic status (9,11,13­16,18­20,22) or
lifestyle (9,11,14­22). We, therefore, an-
alyzed data from the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) (23) to test the hypothesis
that shorter height and leg length, and
lower leg length­to­height ratio, are in-
dependently associated with greater like-
lihood of adiposity, insulin resistance,
and glucose intolerance in the general
U.S. adult population.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- NHANES III was con-
ducted using a multistage sampling design
to be representative of the noninstitution-
alized civilian population in the U.S. from
1988 through 1994 (23). Subjects for the
present analysis were adults aged 40­74
years who completed physical examina-
tions and laboratory tests at the mobile
examination center. Pregnant women
were excluded. Because all analyses were
based on sex- and race/ethnicity-specific
distributions of anthropometric measure-

ments, individuals other than non-
Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks,
and Mexican Americans were excluded
from this analysis due to small sample
size. We also excluded 55 subjects with
insulin-treated diabetes diagnosed before
age 40 because they presumably had type
1 diabetes. In total, 7,424 adults were
deemed eligible.
Exposure assessment
Height was measured using a specially de-
signed stadiometer (24). Leg length was
calculated by subtracting sitting height,
measured with the subject sitting on a
specially made measurement box on the
stadiometer (24), from standing height.
Measurements were taken to the nearest
tenth of a centimeter for height and sitting
height (24).
Information on age, sex, race/ethni-
city, parental history of diabetes, physical
activity, education, annual household in-
come, smoking history, and age at men-
arche were collected in a standardized
interview (25,26). Race/ethnicity was cat-
egorized into three groups: non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican
American. Subjects were classified as hav-
ing parental history of diabetes if either
their biological father or mother had dia-
betes (26). Physical activity was classified
into four categories (vigorously active,
moderately active, lightly active, and sed-
entary) based on frequency and intensity
of reported physical activities (27). Edu-
cation level was dichotomized at 12 years.
Annual household income was dichoto-
mized at $20,000. Subjects were classi-
fied as "ever smokers" if they reported that
they had smoked at least 100 cigarettes
during their lives; otherwise they were
classified as "never smokers."
Outcome assessment
Adiposity was defined using percent body
fat estimated with bioelectrical imped-
ance (Valhalla Scientific Body Composi-
tion Analyzer 1990 B) (28). Participants
who were pregnant, who had cardiac
pacemakers, or who had previously un-
dergone limb amputation were excluded
from the measurement of biometrical im-
pedance (29). Estimates of percent body
fat were available for 6,778 of 7,424
(91%) eligible subjects.
Homeostasis model assessment of in-
sulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calcu-
lated with HOMA2 Calculator version 2.2
for subjects whose plasma glucose ranged
from 3.0 to 25.0 mmol/l and whose insu-
lin ranged from 20 to 400 pmol/l (30,31)
and who fasted as instructed (12 h for
morning session and 6 h for afternoon
and evening sessions) (25). Subjects with
diabetes were not included in the
HOMA-IR analysis (32), as the inputs for
HOMA-IR, glucose and insulin, can be
pharmacologically manipulated. Serum
insulin and plasma glucose were mea-
sured using radioimmunoassay and a
hexokinase enzymatic method, respec-
tively (33). HOMA-IR data were available
for 4,658 of 4,701 (99%) nondiabetic
subjects with complete data on glucose
tolerance status.
Among the 7,424 subjects in the
study, 839 reported that they had been
previously diagnosed with diabetes by a
physician. Among those who had not
been diagnosed with diabetes by physi-
cian, 705 did not complete a 75-g oral
glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for various
reasons. In addition, 775 subjects who
completed the OGTT were excluded be-
cause they did not fast as instructed (25)
or because their second blood sample was
not drawn within 120  15 min after the
challenge (34). The remaining 5,105 sub-
jects were classified into three categories
of glucose tolerance based on the World
Health Organization's 1985 criteria for
OGTT (35): "normal" for fasting plasma
glucose 7.8 mmol/l and 2-h plasma glu-
cose 7.8 mmol/l, "impaired glucose tol-
erance" (IGT) for fasting plasma glucose
7.8 mmol/l and 2-h plasma glucose
7.8­11.1 mmol/l, and "diabetes" for fast-
ing plasma glucose 7.8 mmol/l or 2-h
plasma glucose 11.1 mmol/l. While no
longer in use, the 1985 classification
scheme was standard through the early
1990s, when NHANES III was con-
ducted. For participants assigned to ei-
ther the afternoon or evening session, the
2-h glucose cutoff value was modified to
13.9 mmol/l (25,36). Combined with the
839 subjects who had physician-
diagnosed diabetes, 5,944 subjects
(2,831 men and 3,113 women) had com-
plete data on glucose tolerance status.
People without valid glucose tolerance
data tended to be younger non-Hispanic
blacks or Mexican Americans, with
$20,000 annual household income, no
parental history of diabetes, and lower
BMI compared with those who provided
valid glucose tolerance data.
Statistical analyses
All analyses accounted for the complex,
multistage, stratified, cluster-sampling
design of NHANES III by using sample
weights provided by the survey designer
as part of public data (23).
Anthropometric measurements of in-
terest were converted to sex- and race/
ethnicity-specific weighted z-scores
based on the 7,424 eligible subjects in this
study using sample weights,
Z 
(x  x
¯w
)
SDw
,
where x is an anthropometric measure-
ment for an individual, x
¯w
is the weighted
mean across subjects, and SDw
is the
weighted SD.
For percent body fat and HOMA-IR,
both continuous dependent variables, we
used multivariate linear regression.
HOMA-IR was log transformed to reduce
skewness. This transformation produces
linear models in which -coefficients are
interpretable on a multiplicative scale
rather than an additive scale. In contrast,
for glucose intolerance, we used multino-
mial logistic regression models with
three-level dependent variable: 1) normal
glucose tolerance, 2) IGT, and 3) type 2
diabetes with normal glucose tolerance.
For each analysis, we constructed
three nested models: 1) a basic model ad-
justing for age only, 2) a model with other
potential confounders (parental history of
diabetes, physical activity, education,
household income, smoking, and age at
menarche) in addition to age, and 3) a
model that also included percent body fat.
We pooled across sex and race/
ethnicity unless consistent interactions
were observed. To minimize the possibil-
ity of confounding by age-related loss of
stature due to osteoporosis, analyses were
repeated in a subset of adults aged 59
years and younger. Analyses were per-
formed with Stata version 8.2 (37) using
pseudomaximum likelihoods with vari-
ance estimations by linearization or Fay's
modification of the balanced repeated
replication method (38). We set the sta-
tistical significance level at a two-tailed
type I error of 0.05.
RESULTS -- After exclusions, 7,424
subjects (3,609 men and 3,815 women)
remained eligible. Selected characteristics
of the 5,944 subjects with complete data
on glucose tolerance are displayed in Ta-
ble 1. Distributions of anthropometric
measurements, from which sex- and race/
ethnicity-specific z-scores were calcu-
lated, are shown in Table 2.

Correlation between the z-scores of
anthropometric measurements
Height and leg length were highly corre-
lated (r2  0.86; P  0.01). Leg length­
to­height ratio was moderately correlated
with leg length (r2  0.69; P  0.01) but
weakly correlated with height (r2  0.23;
P  0.01).
Percent body fat and anthropometric
measurements
Since there were significant interactions
between sex and anthropometric mea-
surements in predicting percent body fat,
we stratified these analyses by sex. In
women, percent body fat was significantly
higher in those with shorter height,
shorter leg length, and lower leg length­
to­height ratio, even after adjustment for
potential confounders (Table 3). In men,
point estimates showed a similar pattern
of associations, but none of these asso-
ciations were statistically significant
(Table 3).
HOMA-IR and anthropometric
measurements
Lower leg length­to­height ratio was sig-
nificantly associated with greater
HOMA-IR among those without diabetes,
even after adjusting for a variety of poten-
tial confounders (Table 3; model 2). Ad-
ditional adjustment for percent body fat
attenuated this association but only
slightly. Even after complete adjustment,
a 1-SD lower leg length­to­height ratio
was associated with a 5% greater mean
HOMA-IR (-coefficient from linear re-
gression model for the log-transformed
HOMA-IR  1.05). In contrast, neither
height nor leg length showed a consistent
relationship with HOMA-IR (Table 3;
model 3).
Diabetes, IGT, and anthropometric
measurements
Shorter height, shorter leg length, and
lower leg length­to­height ratio were all
associated with higher prevalence of dia-
betes after adjusting for age (Table 3;
model 1). Shorter leg length and lower leg
length­to­height ratio remained associ-
ated with diabetes after multiple adjust-
ments (Table 3; model 2). The association
between leg length­to­height ratio and
diabetes was slightly attenuated after fur-
ther adjustment for percent body fat, but
remained significant (Table 3; model 3): a
1-SD lower leg length­to­height ratio
was associated with a 19% greater risk of
having diabetes (prevalence ratio 
1.19). Across the full range of leg length­
to­height ratio, this corresponds to two-
fold greater risk (Fig. 1). This relationship
was consistently present in men and
women and in non-Hispanic whites and
Mexican Americans but was absent in
non-Hispanic blacks.
Patterns of association with IGT were
similar but weaker. Height and leg length
were inversely associated with prevalence
of IGT, although none of the associations
remained significant after multiple ad-
justments (Table 3). There was no overall
association between leg length­to­height
ratio and IGT, but Mexican Americans
showed a larger and significant effect of
leg length­to­height ratio for the preva-
lence ratio of IGT (P value for the interac-
tion 0.01); the fully adjusted prevalence
ratio for IGT associated with a 1-SD lower
value in leg length­to­height ratio was
1.40 (95% CI 1.21­1.62).
To minimize the possibility that
age-related osteoporosis might have in-
fluenced stature and its metabolic associ-
ations, we conducted additional analyses
limited to adults aged 60 or younger.
These analyses yielded similar patterns of
results. For example, in this subgroup,
1-SD lower values in height, leg length,
and leg length­to­height ratio were asso-
ciated with prevalence ratios for diabetes

percent body fat.
CONCLUSIONS -- This cross-sec-
tional study in the general adult popula-
tion of the U.S. demonstrates that two
indicators of suboptimal prepubertal
growth, short leg length and low leg
length­to­height ratio, are associated
with insulin resistance and type 2 diabe-
tes and, in women, are also associated
with adiposity. These relationships were
graded and were independent of many
potential confounders. Shorter overall
stature showed similar patterns of associ-
ation but failed to maintain statistical sig-
nificance after multiple adjustment.
Our findings are consistent with re-
sults from three previous studies of leg
length and diabetes-related outcomes in
adults. The British Women's Heart and
Health Study (10) demonstrated inverse
associations of leg length and leg-to-trunk
ratio with BMI, HOMA-IR, and diabetes
in elderly women. Two other studies
(9,12) did not report on diabetes but did
find inverse associations between BMI
(9,12) and HOMA-IR (9) and leg length
and leg-trunk ratio in middle-aged
adults.
Insofar as short leg length and low
leg-to-height ratio in adults indicate im-
paired growth during childhood (39),
there are three potential pathways linking
impaired prepubertal growth to the risk
of obesity and diabetes in middle age. The
first pathway involves nutrition in early
childhood. Being breast-fed and higher
energy intake at 4 years of age are associ-
ated with longer leg length in adulthood
(8). Being breast-fed may also lower the
long-term risk of obesity (40) and type 2
diabetes (41).
The second pathway involves hor-
monal factors relevant to growth. Insulin-
like growth factor-I, a major determinant
of fetal and childhood growth (42), ap-
pears to predict a lower risk of diabetes in
adulthood (43). Vitamin D is an alterna-
tive candidate. Some polymorphism in
the vitamin D receptor gene appears to be
associated with both childhood growth

(44) and with insulin resistance in adult-
hood (45).
The third pathway involves the intra-
uterine environment, which could influ-
ence both stature and the subsequent risk
of diabetes via fetal programming of me-
tabolism (1). Nutritional and hormonal
environments in utero may affect the
structure and function of -cells in the
adult pancreas through various mecha-
nisms, such as vascularity, innervation, or
islet morphology (46). In animal studies,
suboptimal nutrition in utero leads to in-
sulin resistance in the liver, skeletal mus-
cle, and adipose tissue (47).
We observed a significant interaction
between sex and anthropometric mea-
surements for percent body fat. Earlier
puberty may be associated with greater
body weight in both boys and girls, and
the establishment of the menstrual cycle
in girls requires a certain amount of body
fat (48). It is possible that the attained
body height is associated with body fat
during puberty, especially in girls, which
may be carried over into adulthood. We
also observed a significant interaction be-
tween race/ethnicity and anthropometric
measurements for the glucose tolerance.
Since no previous related publications are
based on a typical U.S. population, this
finding needs further investigation in
other studies.
Two study limitations deserve men-
tion. First, we lacked data on perinatal
and childhood growth (e.g., birth weight
and length) and thus could not determine
the independent contributions of pre-
versus postnatal factors on metabolic ab-
normalities in adulthood. Although leg
length is considered a more specific indi-
cator of postnatal growth (39) than
height, it would be the best to conduct the
study prospectively with anthropometric
data in utero or at birth. Second, the
cross-sectional design of this study pre-
cluded investigation of temporal se-
quence. However, we believe that this
poses only a minor threat, at least for the
outcome of type 2 diabetes, since adult
stature is typically attained before the dis-
order develops. There remains the possi-
bility of reverse causality: type 2 diabetes
might lead to shortened stature, for exam-
ple, through osteoporosis, although evi-
dence for the association between type 2
diabetes and osteoporosis is inconsistent
(49). Mitigating against this possibility,
however, is the similar pattern of results in
adults aged younger than 60 years, a group
at lower risk for significant osteoporosis.
Our study shows that adult stature
can be helpful in predicting the risk of
diabetes independently from other
known risk factors. Insofar as adult stat-
ure is an indicator of development and
growth during early life, the risk of obe-
sity, insulin resistance, and diabetes in
adulthood might begin to accrue before
puberty, as supported by longitudinal
studies (50,51). The biologic pathways
underlying this association still require
further research, specifically on nutri-
tional and hormonal environments dur-
ing childhood in combination with
environments in utero. Interventions to
improve prepubertal nutrition could rep-
resent novel means to combat the epi-
demic of obesity and type 2 diabetes.
