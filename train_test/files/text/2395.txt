Objectives. Provide recommendations for researchers on the use of the Big Five personality battery in the National
Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), and ensure that the battery does proxy the Big Five. Also, describe the
levels of Big Five traits across gender and age.
Method. We used an Exploratory Structural Equation Model (ESEM) to analyze NHSAP's personality battery, com-
paring NSHAP with the National Longitudinal Study of Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) and the Health and
Retirement Study (HRS).
Results. ESEM revealed a 5-factor structure in the NSHAP battery, but with considerable cross-loadings. When these
cross-loadings were not included in the model, model fit notably worsened. Reliabilities of Big Five scales were compa-
rable to the HRS and MIDUS, even though NSHAP's battery is shorter. Women were considerably more Agreeable than
men, although this gender gap closed among the oldest in the sample (80 years or older).
Discussion.Researchers will be able to make use of NSHAP's personality battery to examine a range of social,
biological, and psychological factors at older ages, in light of individuals' general traits. We recommend models which
allow for cross-loadings.
Key words: Big Five--Factor analysis--NSHAP--Personality traits.
The purpose of this paper is to analyze variation
in National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project
(NSHAP's) battery of personality items. We will show that
the variation in these items is primarily explained by five
factors which correspond closely to what have been identi-
fied as the Big Five, a commonly used model of person-
ality (John, Naumann, & Soto, 2008; Marsh, Nagengast,
& Morin, 2013; Specht, Egloff, & Schmukle, 2011).
Following this analysis, we provide recommendations to
researchers on how to use this battery in research on aging,
traits, health, and social connectedness. The presence of the
Big Five in NSHAP provides researchers with a new and
unique opportunity to link personality traits and social fac-
tors together in terms of how they produce good health at
older ages, and this paper provides researchers with meth-
odological guidance for such analyses.
Personality traits describe characteristic differences in
individuals' thinking, emotion, and behavior in relation to
their environment (Eysenck, 1998 [1947]; Funder, 2001;
Roberts, 2009). In the past 10 years, a large and growing
body of literature has linked differences in personality traits
todifferencesinphysicalandmentalhealth(Hampson,2012;
Ozer & Benet-Martínez, 2006; Shannahan, Hill, Roberts, &
Eccles, 2012). The effect of Conscientiousness on mortal-
ity is comparable to that of socioeconomic status (Roberts,
Kuncel, Shiner, Caspi, & Goldberg, 2007), and there is a
strong and positive association between Extraversion and
subjective well-being (Ozer & Benet-Martínez, 2006).
Overall, research has shown that personality matters across
a range of social, psychological, and physical domains
(Hampson, 2012; Hampson, Goldberg, Vogt, & Dubanoski,
2007; Shannahan et al., 2012). Furthermore, because traits
describe the way that a person interacts with his or her envi-
ronment, the features of this environment will be conse-
quential for how personality does or does not contribute to
good health and well-being (Eysenck 1998 [1947]; Roberts,
2009; Shannahan et al., 2012). Findings that emphasize this
perspective, which sees personality and the environment in
terms of dynamic relationships, may be enriched by data
on the characteristics of individuals' social environments,
linked to data on personality traits (Lodi-Smith & Roberts,
2007; Roberts, 2007, 2009; Shannahan et al., 2012).
The present paper describes nationally representa-
tive data on personality traits, available from the NSHAP,
which may be uniquely valuable to researchers interested
in integrated, interdisciplinary models of the aging process
because of its rich set of measures on networks, neigh-
borhoods, social support, and marital quality (Cornwell,
Laumann, & Schumm, 2008; Cornwell & Waite, 2009;
Lindau, Laumann, Levinson, & Waite, 2003). Our aim is
S117
Iveniuk ET AL.
to provide researchers with a validation of these meas-
ures within the NSHAP sample, since they were modified
from previous versions, and also to recommend methods
for using these measures in future papers. The first wave
of NSHAP produced a number of findings related to older
adults' social networks, psychological well-being, and
physical health (Cornwell et al., 2008; Cornwell & Waite,
2009, 2012; Lindau et al., 2007). However, the first wave did
not include measures of psychological traits. NSHAP Wave
2 includes a personality battery, adapted from the Midlife
Development Inventory (MIDI), that proxies the Big Five
(Costa & McCrae, 1992a; John et al., 2008; Lachman &
Weaver, 1997).
The Big Five
TheBigFivetraitsare:Opennesstoexperience,orseeking
variety in types of experiences; Conscientiousness, or being
norm-abiding and delaying gratification; Extraversion, or
being lively and sociable; Agreeableness or being com-
munally oriented and altruistic; and finally Neuroticism or
emotional instability, which entails a vulnerability to nega-
tive affect (John et al., 2008). These traits can be abbrevi-
ated into the mnemonic acronym "OCEAN."
The Big Five is perhaps the most well-validated taxo-
nomic system for personality, vis-a-vis four important crite-
ria. First, while there may be traits that are beyond or outside
of the Big Five, many other traits are nested within the Big
Five as subscales or sub-dimensions of the space of possi-
ble traits (Costa & McCrae, 1992a; Digman, 1990). Second,
the Big Five components can be found across social status,
ethnicity, gender, language, or culture, (Costa & McCrae,
1992a; Schmitt, Allik, McCrae, & Benet-Martínez, 2007).
Third, Big Five traits have strong interrater reliability, as
well as agreement between self-ratings and outside observ-
ers (Costa & McCrae, 1992a). Fourth, Big Five traits are
highly stable over the life course, especially at older adult-
hood, meaning it is plausible to assume for most of the
NSHAP sample that their traits have been stable for some
time before they were interviewed (Cobb-Clark & Schurer,
2012; Roberts & DelVecchio, 2000). Existing work sug-
gests that test­retest correlations of Big Five traits asymp-
totically approach 1.0 as age increases, and the gap between
test and retest decreases (Roberts & DelVecchio, 2000).
The Big Five is therefore an integrated taxonomic system
for classifying individuals according to personality traits,
allowing researchers to proxy factors which are temporally
(and perhaps causally) prior to some outcome of interest.
Method
The second wave of NSHAP was collected in 2010­
2011, 5 years after the first wave in 2005­2006. The first
wave interviewed 3,005 older adults, with a response rate
of 75.5%. Seven hundred and forty-four respondents were
not reinterviewed at W2, for various reasons including
death and poor health. This left 2,261 returning respond-
ents. However, the second wave also instituted a partner
module, where 955 spouses or cohabiting romantic part-
ners of respondents were given the same survey instru-
ment as W1 returning respondents. Some respondents who
declined to participate in W1, and who were not coded as
hostile by the interview team in W1, were also contacted
again to see if they would reconsider participating in the
survey. Altogether, including partners and new respond-
ents, interviews were completed with 3,377 respondents
in W2. The data collection process at both waves involved
a 90-min in-person interview, which captured the major-
ity of biological, psychological, and social measures.
Following this, the respondent was given a leave-behind
questionnaire, to return on their own time, which included
the MIDI. The NSHAP MIDI is a list of 21 adjectives
that the respondent is asked to use to rate themselves, on
a four-point scale, ranging from "not at all" to "a little,"
"some," and "a lot." In households where both partners
participated, both were asked to fill out the leave-behind
questionnaire.
It is worth describing how the MIDI compares with other
personality batteries that also measure the Big Five, since
there are multiple instruments which purport to capture these
same traits (Costa & McCrae, 1992b; Gosling, Rentfrow, &
Swann, 2003; Lachman & Weaver, 1997). Using personal-
ity batteries as part of a omnibus in-home survey creates a
problem, because these batteries tend to be quite long (Costa
& McCrae, 1992b), and therefore burdensome. Shortening
these batteries can also lead to severe problems with reliabil-
ity and validity (Gosling et al., 2003). The MIDI is relatively
short, but according to previous analyses of its factor struc-
ture, long enough that it accurately taps the traits of inter-
est, according to numerous previous tests of the measure's
validity (Lachman & Weaver, 1997; Zimprich, Allemand, &
Lachman, 2012). The developers of the MIDI carried out a
pilot study of 574 men and women, and then selected a list
of adjectives with high item-to-total correlations and factor
loadings for use in the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS)
study (Goodwin & Gotlib, 2004). The NSHAP team further
modified the MIDI to shorten it further, in order to fit it into an
already lengthy leave-behind questionnaire. The differences
between the MIDUS MIDI, Health and Retirement Study
(HRS) MIDI, and the NSHAP MIDI battery are shown in
Table 1. In NSHAP W2, 2,949 individuals returned the leave-
behind questionnaire (87.3%), and 2,848 individuals filled out
any of the MIDI questions (84.3%). The adjective with the
least amount of missing data was "responsible," which 2,754
people answered, and the adjectives with the most missing
data were "nervous" and "warm," tied with 2,688 nonmissing
values each. After dropping those cases which had missing
values on all adjectives (529 respondents), 2,193 respondents
had no missing values out of 2,848 (77.0%). Data are publicly
available (NSHAP Wave 2: Waite, Linda J., Kathleen Cagney,

Results
Factor Structure of the NSHAP MIDI
We now turn to an analysis of the MIDI factor struc-
ture. We carried out an Exploratory Structural Equation
Modeling (ESEM) analysis on the MIDI personality bat-
tery, in order to ascertain that a Big Five factor structure
existed within these adjectives after they had been modi-
fied by the NSHAP investigative team. We chose ESEM
because other authors have argued that confirmatory factor
analyses (CFAs) are not adequate to the complex structure
of the Big Five personality traits (Marsh et al., 2010, 2013).
All analyses were carried out using MPlus v.6.2 statisti-
cal software using mean and variance-adjusted weighted
least squares (WLSMV), (Muthén & Muthén, 1998­2011),
because WLSMV is appropriate for binary or ordinal out-
come variables in an ESEM context (Muthén & Muthén,
1998­2011; Rhemtulla, Brosseau-Liard, & Savalei, 2012).
Exploratory factor analyses (EFAs) using Maximum
Likelihood produced very similar results, with only five fac-
tors having eigenvalues over 1.0. EFA with WLSMV pro-
duced identical results, which is expected, since ESEM is
EFA in an SEM framework (Asparouhov & Muthén, 2009).
WLSMV handles missing data by computing pairwise
polychoric correlations between all variables in the data
set, rather than restricting the analysis to individuals with
complete information on every variable, and this procedure
has been shown to be more efficient than listwise deletion
(Asparouhov & Muthén, 2010; Flora & Curran, 2004).
Factor scores can therefore be estimated even for those who
did not answer some of the items, though with less preci-
sion. Latent factors predicted manifest, measured adjectives
using ordinal probit links--which assumes that each vari-
able reflects an underlying, normally distributed variable--
and the factor analysis underwent a varimax rotation. The
root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) was
below 0.06 when there were at least five factors (0.056); the
comparative fit index (CFI) and Tucker­Lewis index (TLI)
were 0.97 and 0.94 respectively, indicating good model fit.
Chi-squared statistics comparing the fitted model to a satu-
rated model were significant up to 10 factors, which is not
surprising given the chi-squared test of model fit is sensitive
to sample size, and therefore is almost always significant
with large samples (Ullman & Bentler, 2003). Although the
fit is less than perfect, a five-factor solution fits the data
reasonably well, and is commensurate with the expectation
that the MIDI does proxy the Big Five. We therefore chose
a five-factor solution.
Table 2 shows the varimax-rotated factor loadings. Cells
were left blank if factor loadings were not significant at
p < .05; entries are bolded for the largest factor loading
in each row. Note as well that there are two exceptions to
the expected factor structure. First, "active," which is sup-
posed to load on to Extraversion, loads more strongly on
to Conscientiousness. This may be because at older ages
"staying active" is a phrase that is often associated with
exercise, and as such, may be more readily understood as
an expression of conscientiousness (Mitka, 2001). Second,
"warm" seems to load on to Extraversion, although it
has a very similar, and almost as large, factor loading on
Agreeableness, its expected factor. For the most part,
though, the factor structure presents as expected. Splitting
the sample by gender also produced very similar results. We
therefore hold that the MIDI appropriately captures the Big
Five in NSHAP.
Researchers could also carry out a CFA, which con-
strains factor loadings to zero if the adjective does not load
on its theoretically specified latent factor (i.e., the adjec-
tive "active" could be constrained to only load on the

latent factor for Extraversion, and have no cross-loadings).
However, such a model could be a worse fit to the data,
and therefore be less effective at capturing the latent factors.
To test this, we used an EFA in a CFA framework, which
allowed cross-loadings. We then calculated a chi-squared
test comparing the fit of two, nested models to each other,
one with cross-loadings, and one without. The chi-squared
test was significant at p < .001, meaning we can confidently
reject the null hypothesis that allowing for cross-loadings
does not improve model fit. Furthermore, the constrained
EFA-in-CFA had notably worse model fit according to the
CFI (0.83), the TLI (0.80), and the RMSEA (0.10). We
therefore concluded that factor scores from a model which
allows for cross-loadings, were a better fit to the data, and
more useful to researchers. (Previous studies have also
shown that the MIDI factor structure is largely invariant
across age groups, recommending it for use among older
adults [see Zimprich et al., 2012].)
Comparison of Factor Scores Versus Scales
We compared the factor scores from this analysis to scales
constructed from the adjectives; when we say "scores" we
mean predicted values of the latent variables produced
from the factor analysis in Table 2, while "scales" are the
unweighted average of the adjectives that theoretically load
onto the latent factors (see Table 1). Alpha reliabilities for
these scales were generally good and comparable to alphas
from other nationally representative surveys that employ
the MIDI. In Table 3, we show the results from calculat-
ing the alpha values for personality scales from the second
wave of the MIDUS study, as well as the 2010 wave of the
HRS. We used the entire sample of each survey's wave
to compute these results. We can see that Neuroticism in
NSHAP had the lowest alpha value, and was lower than
expected given the alphas in MIDUS and HRS, however,
it is still within an acceptable range. Note the difference
from MIDUS and HRS, suggesting that shortening the
scale may have led to this drop in reliability. We also tested
the correlations between the more restricted scales, used
in NSHAP, and the fuller scales using data from the 2010
wave of the HRS. Looking at Table 1, we can see that the
scales for Openness, Conscientiousness, and Agreeableness
are shorter in NSHAP than they are in HRS.
We also looked at the intercorrelations within scales,
and the correlation between scores and scales; these are
shown in Table 4. This table contains two separate corre-
lation matrixes. The first panel shows correlations among
the scales, and one result is that the scales are all intercor-
related. It is possible that the varimax-rotated factor scores
and the scales do not capture the same latent construct. This
could be the case since some adjectives, like "active" and
"warm," do not load on to the factor that we would theoreti-
cally expect. In order to test this, panel 2 correlates scores
with scales. We can see that all correlations along the diago-
nal--that is, between a score and its scale counterpart--are
greater than .90, and in the case of Neuroticism, the correla-
tion is almost perfect. This may be because Neuroticism is
the most distinct factor from the other four, in that it has the
most minimal cross-loading with other factors. One reason
for this might be that the neuroticism scale is composed of
three negative items and one positive item, whereas all the
other scales are composed of positive items.
Given the high correlation between scales and scores for
the same construct, as well as potential problems arising from
collinearity among scales, we recommend the use of factor
scores. Fitting an SEM with WLSMV, or some other proce-
dure capable of assuaging problems with missing data, could
also prove useful when computing factor scores. In addition
to the method presented here, a researcher could employ

a more sophisticated form of SEM in order to account for
the high intercorrelations among the four, positive-sound-
ing personality traits, such as the use of a general factor
(Schermer & Vernon, 2010), second-order factors (Digman,
1997), or a bifactor model (Holzinger & Swineford, 1937;
Jennrich & Bentler, 2011), on the assumption that the com-
mon variance among the OCEA factors is accounted for by
some additional factor or factors. Regardless, whenever pos-
sible, it seems preferable to use factor scores.
Age and Gender
A great deal of research on personality is focused on the
question of age differences in personality, and as such, it
provides us with heavily replicated findings concerning
age trajectories in personality traits (Roberts, Walton, &
Viechtbauer, 2006; Soto, John, Gosling, & Potter, 2011;
Srivastava & John, 2003). In older adulthood, individuals
should be largely stable in terms of their personality traits
(Roberts & DelVecchio, 2000), although some evidence

suggests that the scale values that people report on all five
personality traits may drop in later life (Soto et al., 2011).
Figure 1 shows line graphs which plot the mean factor
scores by age category and gender. Lines were produced
using the command in Stata. Lines also possess 95% confi-
dence interval (CI) bars, in order to call attention to gender
differences that are significant at p < .05. Point estimates
were calculated using NSHAP W2 sampling weights, and
CI bars were computed using settings within Stata, using
the command to obtain correct variance estimates for the
individuals who returned the leave-behind questionnaire.
Individuals who fell outside the W2 returning respond-
ents' age range--that is, 64­90--were excluded from the
analysis. Otherwise, all respondents were included, mean-
ing these figures do include partners. Finally, note that the
y-axes all have the same range, in order to further facilitate
comparisons between these graphs. Recall that the factor
scores are standardized, and as such are centered on zero
for the whole sample of men and women at every age. Also,
note that these are estimated factor scores, since the true
values of the latent construct are unknown.
Numerous personality traits do show age-related declines,
although the change is most dramatic for Openness. Men
and women also generally have similar levels of the Big
Five traits over the age range in NSHAP, with one important
exception: women were generally much more agreeable
than men, and in the youngest age group, their point esti-
mate for Agreeableness is more than a full standard devia-
tion higher than for men. This gap begins to close in the
middle age category, and for the oldest old in the NSHAP
sample, there is no longer a significant difference. Both
men and women contribute to closing this gap, although
men more so. This pattern of convergence seems to be
unique to Agreeableness in the sample. Other traits, such as
Openness and Neuroticism, seem to show the widest gender
gaps in the middle age category. For Conscientiousness and
Extraversion, the gender gap never appears significant.
Discussion
Several patterns emerged in our analyses. We found
that women generally had higher Agreeableness than men,
which is commensurate with previous studies that have
shown that women generally score higher on Agreeableness
(Costa, Jr., Terracciano, & McCrae, 2001; Feingold, 1994).
We also described age trends in Agreeableness, Openness,
Extraversion, and Conscientiousness. However, we cannot
use these results to say that any of these traits change with
age. The MIDI battery was added to the second wave of the
NSHAP survey, and we are not able to compare the results of
this analysis to results fromW1. The language above has tried
to refrain, therefore, from discussing age differences in terms
of age-related changes. Without longitudinal data on these
measures, we cannot separate cohort, period, and age-related
effects. The patterns that we describe in Agreeableness and
Openness are, however, in accord with studies describing
the relationship between personality traits and age (Roberts
et al., 2006; Specht et al., 2011). Regardless, it is apparent
that there are age-related differences between individuals in
the NSHAP sample in personality scores, especially in men's
Agreeableness. The large gap between men and women
on this trait suggests that gender may be an important con-
founder in any multivariate analysis predicting some out-
come using Agreeableness. The converse may also be true:
gender differences in health behaviors, attitudes, psychologi-
cal well-being, and quality of life may be partially attribut-
able to differences in Agreeableness.
Another important methodological consideration aris-
ing from our analysis is that if a researcher estimates factor
scores, and then uses them as predictors in some regres-
sion analysis, then this assumes that the scores are produced
without error, and that the score produced by the factor anal-
ysis is an accurate depiction of the individual's position in
the trait space. Simultaneously, estimating latent traits and
predicting outcomes using those traits (i.e., fitting a SEM)
would be a solution to this issue. Scales, similarly, should
be approached with caution, considering the alpha values
of the scales are modest, implying that they are less reliable
than factor scores in proxying the underlying traits; the con-
siderable number of cross-loadings are likely responsible for
these low alpha values, since the true trait is seemingly not a
function of the theoretically specified adjectives alone (e.g.,
both Extraversion and Agreeableness affect how highly one
rates oneself on the adjective "warm"). Alternative mod-
eling strategies such as bifactor and general factor models,
may provide additional information about the properties of
the MIDI battery, as well as substantial insights into person-
ality processes and structure. In any event, it seems prefer-
able to use factor scores instead of scales.
Conclusions
In this article, we offered recommendations for the use of
the MIDI in multivariate analyses using NSHAP. We con-
cluded that factor scores rather than averaged scales would be
more appropriate for such analyses, for several reasons. First,
the MIDI factor structure contains a considerable number of
cross-loadings, and without taking these cross-loadings into
account, model fit suffers considerably; this corresponds with
findings from a similar analysis carried out on the MIDI in
MIDUS (Zimprich et al., 2012). Secondly, fitting a model to
the data using WLSMV allows for less missing data, mean-
ing multivariate analyses using factor scores will not be as
reduced in sample size, compared with analyses that used
averaged scales. Third, regressions predicting some conse-
quential outcomes could be combined with an ESEM or CFA
in a single model, meaning factor scores would not need to be
estimated, and factors could be related to this consequential
outcome directly. Fifth, there may be less attenuation when
using the scores as covariates, due to the shrinkage involved

in estimating the factor scores, depending on how scores are
estimated. However, both scores and scales are likely to be
useful in multivariate analysis, and the range of variables
contained in NSHAP offer a unique opportunity to describe,
and theorize, interactions between persons and environments
through the medium of personality traits.

Box 1: Summary of Guidelines for Using the
MIDI Personality Battery in NSHAP
· The NSHAP version of the MIDI does capture the
Big Five trait structure, and as such can be used by
researchers to examine the interrelationships between
traits, social context, and well-being.
· Factor scores are preferable to scales, due to the large
number of cross-loadings.
· Age and gender may be important confounders in anal-
yses predicting consequential outcomes using traits.
This is likely to be especially true for Agreeableness.
· Correlations between traits and outcomes may be
attenuated by moderate reliabilities for the Big Five
measures
· Therefore, alternative specifications of the Big Five,
such as bifactor models, may provide additional trac-
tion on theoretical problems and empirical predictions.
