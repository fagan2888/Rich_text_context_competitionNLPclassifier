The number of people incarcerated in the United States has
significantly increased in the past three decades. In 1980,
approximately 330,000 people were incarcerated (Beck &
Gilliard, 1995), but by the end of 2010, there were over 1.6
million people in federal and state prisons (Guerino,
Harrison, & Sabol, 2011), greater than the population of
Idaho (U.S. Census, 2010). At the end of 2010, 4.1 million
people were on probation and 841,000 were on parole
(Bonczar & Glaze, 2011) and more than 700,000 state and
federal prisoners return to civilian society every year
(Guerino et al., 2011). Nearly two thirds of released prison-
ers are rearrested for a new crime within 3 years of their
release and half are sent back behind bars (Urban Institute,
2009). The cost in human suffering and the sheer enormity of
the problem has fostered a surge of interest in the topic of
prisoner training and reentry (Bucklen & Zajac, 2009). Given
the public health and public safety issues associated with
reentry, developing policies and programs that promote suc-
cessful reentry and prevent reoffending are indispensable for
a healthy community (Wheeler & Patterson, 2008).
Several studies (e.g., Laub & Sampson, 2003; Tripodi,
2010) have identified events, such as marriage and forming
strong ties to work, which can alter criminal trajectories.
Other studies (e.g., Giordano, Cenkovich, & Rudolph, 2002;
Maruna, 2001; van der Knaap, Alberda, Oosterveld, & Born,
2011) have found evidence that psychological changes are
even more important than keystone events in stopping or
slowing down the rate of offending. Interventions that target
antisocial attitudes, poor decision-making, problem-solving
skills, self-control or self-regulation skills, association with
criminal friends, and substance abuse can reduce recidivism
by upwards of 20 percentage points compared with programs
that ignore these needs (Andrews & Bonta, 2003). Bucklen
and Zajac (2009) concluded, "The greatest problem for
parolees was managing themselves in a prosocial manner
while facing demands from their environment" (p. 239).
Communication can be a critically important element of
prosocial behavior. A prime example, as described in the
General Aggression Model (C. A. Anderson & Bushman,
2002), is the use of verbal aggression, a catalyst to physical
assault among violent criminals (Infante & Rancer, 1996;
Toch, 1969). The use of verbal aggression is significantly
correlated with the extent of resorting to physical assault (C.
M. Anderson & Rancer, 2007; Infante & Wigley, 1986), fel-
ony offenses (Spillane-Grieco, 2000), and physical aggres-
sion in correctional centers (Cornell, Peterson, & Richards,
1999; Mejovsek, Buðanovac, & Suur, 2000). A number of
researchers have found that a deficiency in verbal skills is a
major cause of verbal aggression (e.g., Bandura, 1973;
Infante, Chandler, & Rudd, 1989; Roberto, 1999; Toch,
1969). It follows that teaching communication skills is an

Abstract
Freedom Project trains prisoners in nonviolent communication and meditation. Two complementary studies of its effects
are reported in this article. The first study is correlational; we found decreased recidivism rates among prisoners trained
by Freedom Project compared with recidivism rates in Washington state. The second study compared trained prisoners
with a matched-pair control group and found improvement in self-reported anger, self-compassion, and certain forms of
mindfulness among the trained group. Ratings of role-plays simulating difficult interactions show increased social skills among
the group trained by Freedom Project than in the matched controls.

important intervention aimed at reducing aggression and vio-
lence in society.
Compassionate social communication can be taught
according to the concept of Nonviolent Communication
(NVC), originated by Marshall Rosenberg (1999), which
involves noticing others' behaviors, examining the accom-
panying feelings, making requests, and acknowledging the
needs that have been met/unmet. In this way, during con-
flicts, there is no blame or fault assigned to either party.
NVC has been extensively used to train educators, manag-
ers, mental health care providers, gangs, lawyers, military
officers, clergy, government officials, individuals, and
families (Rosenberg, 2003); it has also been used to train
prisoners in the United States and other countries (Niebuhr,
2001). Correctional facilities in Washington (Freedom
Project, 2009), Oregon (Center for Compassionate Living,
2012), California (Bay Nonviolent Communication, 2008),
British Columbia, Denmark, and Sweden (Bryson, 2000)
have maintained their support and use of NVC for many
years There is a small but growing body of academic lit-
erature, including research, surrounding the efficacy and
implications of using NVC within various contexts and
settings (Branscomb, 2011; Cox & Dannahy, 2005;
Dougan, 2011; Fullerton, 2009; Hulley, 2006; R. Jones,
2005; S. Jones, 2009; Nonviolent Communication
Experimental Project, 1999; Savic, 2005; Steckal, 1994;
Young, 2011).
Two of the best-designed studies were carried out by
Donna Riemer (2007, 2009), who researched the outcome of
interventions involving NVC at maximum and medium
security forensic psychiatric units in Wisconsin. In both set-
tings, Reimer found remarkable decreases in violence, use of
restraints, and involuntary seclusion on the ward when com-
pared with pre-NVC-training levels. A more recent study
involving parolees showed that NVC training was associated
with significant increases in empathy .
The NVC process consists of four basic skills: (a) observ-
ing a situation without evaluation, (b) acknowledging the
accompanying feelings, (c) understanding how those feel-
ings are a result of a met/unmet need, and (d) clearly request-
ing concrete actions and exploring how to honor all parties'
needs in a flexible and creative manner, without demands
(Rosenberg, 1999).
These basic skills require mindfulness for their imple-
mentation. Mindfulness meditation has been shown to ame-
liorate aggression, anxiety, recidivism in prisoners, and drug
use (Alexander, Walton, Orme-Johnson, Goodman, &
Pallone, 2003; Hawkins, 2003; Parks et al., 2003; Perkins,
1998). Meditation and mindfulness have also been used suc-
cessfully to help nonprison populations overcome intractable
conflict (Horton-Deutsch & Horton, 2003), to help parents
whose children behave in particularly challenging ways
(Koren-Karie, Oppenheim, & Getzler-Yosef, 2008), and for
counselors who work under stress (Christopher, Christopher,
Dunnagan, & Schure, 2006).
Mindfulness has been described as "the awareness that
emerges through paying attention on purpose, in the present
moment, and nonjudgmentally to the unfolding of experi-
ence moment by moment" (Kabat-Zinn, 2003, pp. 145-146).
Mindfulness meditation can improve the capacity to regulate
emotion, combat emotional dysfunction, improve patterns of
thinking, and reduce negative mind-sets (Siegel, 2007, p. 6).
Samuelson, Carmody, Kabat-Zinn, and Bratt (2007) offered
a vivid example of the beneficial effects of mindfulness-
based training in correctional facilities; this study examined
1,350 inmates trained in mindfulness-based stress reduction.
The authors found significant pre- to post-training improve-
ments in hostility, self-esteem, and mood disturbances.
The body of research on mindfulness and the proven
effects of NVC lead to the theory that mindfulness can sup-
port NVC by increasing awareness, sharpening observational
skills, and creating time and space to formulate a response; in
turn, NVC can support mindfulness by decreasing violent
outbursts that interfere with presence of mind.
The combination of NVC and meditation has been taught
by Freedom Project in some of Washington State's correc-
tion facilities. Freedom Project is a program for inmates run
mostly by former inmates and volunteers. It has offered
prison programs since 1999; there have been anecdotal
reports of success and increased participation, but no formal
studies of the program's effectiveness. Freedom Project pro-
vides introductory and advanced trainings in NVC and mind-
fulness practices such as NVC study groups, support groups
for inmate facilitators, and multi-day theme-based work-
shops on anger, empathy/self-empathy, reconciliation, con-
necting couples, and parenting. Inmates' participation in the
trainings is always voluntary, never obligatory (Freedom
Project, 2009).
The purpose of the set of studies presented here is to
explore the effects of the training offered by Freedom Project.
The first study examines the relation between training and
recidivism rates. The second study compares trained and
untrained inmates in their use of nonviolent communication
skills during simulated and challenging social interactions;
self-reports of mindfulness, self-care, and anger manage-
ment are also compared. These two studies are presented as
a unit because together they illuminate the effects of Freedom
Project training for society and for individuals. The conclu-
sions are strengthened by including different modes of mea-
surements, such as official records, behavioral observations,
and self-report. The combined findings allow for the explo-
ration of whether the training is associated with improve-
ment during incarceration and upon release, as well as which
specific skills and attitudes change.
General Training Method
Freedom Project's training of inmates is based on Marshall
Rosenberg's nonviolent communication approach that has
been detailed elsewhere (Leu, 2003; Rosenberg, 1999). The
Suarez et al. 3
materials and specific activities used during the training have
been compiled and published in the book Nonviolent
Communication (NVC) Toolkit for Facilitators (Gill, Leu, &
Morin, 2009).
Prisoners of the Monroe Prison Complex are offered
2-day workshops every third weekend of every month. In
addition, every month there are three, 3-hr evening classes in
both NVC and mindfulness. All classes are offered within
the prison compound. Workshops are either introductory or
organized around themes such as conflict, empathy, healing,
or couples and family relationships; all workshops include
mindfulness. Teaching styles vary from trainer to trainer and
according to the workshop theme. Twice a year, specific
mindfulness meditation workshops are offered as part of the
theme-based workshop series.
Class sizes range from 15 to 25 participants, and work-
shop participant numbers range from 20 to 45. All training is
done in groups and participation is always voluntary and
may be repeated. Freedom Project training is one of several
training options offered to inmates in the Washington State
prison system. Prisoners who have received NVC basic
training are given preference for workshop participation;
some prisoners with long sentences have accumulated many
hours of training. Freedom Project programs are open to all
prisoners who choose to enroll. There are no early release or
special treatment incentives offered for participation.
The program was not designed or conducted as a formal
research study, and limitations imposed by administrative
constraints and the need to adapt to differences among the
various prison settings necessitated some modifications. The
training circumstances themselves are not optimal: for exam-
ple, the training rooms are usually small, cramped, hot in
summer, cold in winter, and with windows that do not open.
Study 1
In the first study, we considered the relationship between
Freedom Project training and recidivism. We compared the
percentage of recidivism in trained inmates with the general
recidivism rates in Washington State for the same period. We
hypothesized that inmates who had received training would
have a lower recidivism rate than those who were not trained.
In addition, we proposed that the number of hours of training
in NVC and mindfulness might predict whether trainees
would reoffend or not when they reentered the community.
Method
Participants. Training data were collected on 1,315 inmates
of the Monroe Correctional Complex in Monroe, Washing-
ton, including the Minimum Security Unit; the Twin Rivers
Unit; and the Washington State Reformatory. Crimes leading
to incarceration included sex offenses, drug crimes, burglary,
armed robbery, assault, kidnapping, and murder. The Wash-
ington State Department of Corrections (DOC) supplied
information about release and reoffenses for most of the
sample inmates, except for 136 for whom data were not
reported and 20 for whom some identifying information did
not match the training data. In addition, 274 of the trained
inmates were not yet released from custody; recidivism
could not be studied for them. The final sample was com-
posed of 885 inmates who were trained by Freedom Project
volunteer staff; complete release and reoffense data were
known on these inmates.
The 885 trainees included in this analysis were all men,
who averaged 37.2 years of age (SD = 9.8, range = 57.9) on
the date of their final training. Of the 885 trainees, 654 were
White (74%), 178 were Black (20%), 27 were North
American Indian (3%), 17 were Asian/Pacific Islanders
(2%), 1 was Eskimo, 6 were of other ethnicities, and 2 were
of unknown ethnicities. Comparable demographic data for
the general prison population used as a comparison group
were available for those released in 2007: White (63.6%),
Black (18.6%), Hispanic (11.1%), North American Indian
(3.9%), Asian/Pacific Islanders (2.5%), and Other/Unknown
(0.3%; Evans, 2011). The trained group were more likely to
be White and less likely to be Hispanic than the general pop-
ulation, but otherwise were of comparable ethnicities. The
inmates were trained an average of 35.2 hr (SD = 66.1, range
= 1,057.8). Those released as of 12/31/2008 (n = 667) had
been released an average of 39.4 months (SD = 29.4, range =
118.6).
Results
In 2008, the Washington State DOC reported a 37% recidi-
vism rate; of the 5,999 general prison population inmates
released in 2000, 2,220 returned to prison within 5 years
(Evans, 2010). In contrast, the DOC-reported data showed a
21% recidivism rate for Freedom Project-trained inmates; of
the 885 inmates who were trained by Freedom Project and
subsequently released from prison, 188 had been returned to
prison across the period of the study (1998-2008).
To compare recidivism rates of trained and untrained
inmates, the data for all prisoners released in 2000 by the
Washington State DOC were corrected by eliminating the
Freedom Project trainees released in that same year (N = 30)
from the totals. A chi-square analysis revealed a highly sig-
nificant trend, with fewer Freedom Project trainees returning
to prison than expected and more from the general popula-
tion returning to prison than expected, 2(1) = 84.2, p <
.0001. Of the 697 trained inmates who remained released on
December 31, 2008, 175 (23%) had been released for greater
than 5 years, 76 (17%) had been released for between 4 and
5 years, 82 (13%) had been released for between 3 and 4
years, 89 (12%) had been released for between 2 and 3 years,
116 (11%) had been released for between 1 and 2 years, and
159 (25%) had been released for less than 1 year.
Because approximately 30% of the Freedom Project
trainees were sex offenders, and sex offenders may have a
4 SAGE Open
lower rate of recidivism for any crime than nonsex offenders
(Hanson & Bussière, 1998), the data were reanalyzed to
determine if recidivism remained lower for the Freedom
Project trainees than for the general population of prisoners
once the sex offenders were eliminated from the analysis.
First, the trainees were coded as sex offenders if any of the
crimes for which they were incarcerated in a Washington
State prison was a sex crime (including "Rape 1," "Rape 2,"
"Rape of a child 1," "Other violation child sex," "Nonviolent
sex with child," "Indecent liberties," and "Sex Crime,
other"). The 268 released trainees coded as sex offenders
reoffended at a rate of 11.2%, compared with a recidivism
rate of 25.6% for the nonsex offenders. The chi-square was
then recalculated, eliminating the 268 sex offenders from the
885 released trainees and comparing the recidivism rates of
the remaining 617 trainees. There was still a highly signifi-
cant trend with fewer Freedom Project trainees returning to
prison than expected and more from the general population
returning to prison than expected, 2(1) = 31.6, p < .0001.
A one-tailed t test assuming unequal variances was per-
formed to determine if the number of hours of training dif-
fered between the subgroup of the 885 trained inmates who
committed a reoffense that returned them to prison (n = 182)
versus the subgroup who were still released on December 31,
2008 (n = 685). First, the training hours data were inspected
for outliers, using the definition of outliers as scores that
were greater than the mean plus three standard deviations for
the subgroup. Five outliers were identified and removed for
the subgroup that had been returned to prison, leaving data
for 177 trainees. Sixteen outliers were identified and removed
for the subgroup of those who were still released on
December 31, 2008, leaving data for 669 trainees. Those
who returned to prison had significantly fewer hours of train-
ing (M = 20.6, SD = 10) than those who were still released
(M = 26.3, SD = 19.7), t(566) = 5.3, p < .0001. Because the
training-hours data for both groups were positively skewed,
a nonparametric test of differences was also calculated that
translates the training hours data (again with outliers
removed) to ranks for each group. Median training hours for
the group who did not reoffend was 19 hr, for the group that
reoffended 18.3 hr, Mann-Whitney U = 70,971.5, n
1
= 697,
n
2
= 182, p = .013.
Discussion
The first hypothesis of Study 1 was that inmates who had
received training would have a lower recidivism rate than
those who were not trained. This hypothesis was supported.
We chose to focus on recidivism data reported by Washington
State for 2008 because we used 12/31/08 as the date by
which trainees had to be released to study their reoffenses for
this study. By eliminating the counts of trained prisoners
from the 2008 recidivism data, we had a recidivism rate for
prisoners who were not trained. This general prison popula-
tion comparison group had fewer members who claimed a
White ethnicity and more who identified as Hispanic than the
Freedom Project group. Despite the demographic differ-
ences, both the percentages of those reoffending (37% vs.
21%) and the statistical analysis of frequencies led us to
reject the null hypothesis that training made no difference in
recidivism. Recidivism as a measure has been criticized.
First, the associations between crime, arrest, and imprison-
ment vary (cited in Gehring, 2000); therefore, reimprison-
ment as a sole measure of an individual's successive criminal
activities can be inaccurate. Race and socioeconomic status
affect whether or not imprisonment occurs (Blair, Judd, &
Chapleau, 2004). Racial profiling might have allowed the
Hispanic members of the general prison population to be
reimprisoned at a higher rate than the White members of that
comparison group. Second, outside-of-state convictions are
generally not incorporated into within-state rates of recidi-
vism. Finally, different states and different entities within a
state often use different definitions of recidivism (Evans,
2010; Gehring, 2000). In the Freedom Project study, the first
two limitations apply; however, the same Washington State
DOC office produced the recidivism data for the trained and
untrained prisoner groups. While the proportion of sex
offenders in the trained group was high (30%), even when
that subgroup was removed from the trained group data,
recidivism rates still differed significantly between the
trained group and the state-reported data for the general pop-
ulation of prisoners.
The second hypothesis that trainees who reoffended
would have fewer hours of training than those who did not
reoffend was also supported. The nonnormal shape of the
training hours distributions led us to rely on a nonparametric
approach to conclude that the distributions of training hour
differed significantly between those trainees who reoffended
and those who did not.
Study 2
Given the relationship between lower recidivism rates and
Freedom Project participation, this second study considered
what changes might have been brought about by the Freedom
Project training in inmates. In other words, we were inter-
ested in knowing how the training worked and what effects it
had on individual inmates.
We hypothesized that inmates who underwent the NVC
and mindfulness training, in comparison with untrained
inmates, would show increased mindfulness, increased use
of nonviolent communication skills when asked to address
difficult interpersonal interactions, increased self-compas-
sion, and decreased anger.
Method
Participants' characteristics. This is a matched-pairs study that
compared inmates trained by the Freedom Project with
untrained inmates matched on key demographic variables.
Suarez et al. 5
The 26 participants were male prison inmates at the Monroe
Correctional Complex in Monroe, Washington. At the time
of their evaluation, their ages ranged from 24 to 66 years old.
All participants were Caucasian. To ensure that the partici-
pants understood all the questions and instructions correctly,
only inmates fluent in English were invited to participate. No
inmate was ruled out due to participation in any other train-
ing program available in the prison. The crimes the inmates
were convicted of included rape, rape of a child, murder,
indecent liberties, and assault.
Sampling procedures. The study used matched-pair sampling
to look at the relationship between Freedom project training,
and mindfulness and anger. The Trained group consisted of
13 inmates selected because they had already undergone at
least one full cycle of training in mindfulness and NVC with
Freedom Project, and because they had agreed to take part in
this study. The hours of training provided by the Freedom
Project ranged from 100 to 1,591. The Untrained group con-
sisted of inmates matched and paired with the Trained group
by crime category and age. The Washington State DOC
selected matched untrained inmates from its files. The
selected men were invited by Freedom Project to volunteer
for the study. When there was a pool of untrained inmates
who matched the same trained participant, only one of the
untrained men was included in the study. Untrained partici-
pants were randomly selected from the matched pool to form
comparable matched pairs. The final sample was composed
of 26 Caucasian male participants who were matched on age
(range = 24 to 66 years old, or 42 years) and crime category
(rape, rape of a child, murder, indecent liberties, or assault).
Procedure. This experiment was approved by the Washington
State DOC's Institutional Review Board and Antioch Uni-
versity Seattle's Institutional Review Board. In accordance
with the Institutional Review Boards'agreement, no identifi-
able data were provided back to the Washington State DOC
regarding an individually identifiable performance, comple-
tion of participation, or if an inmate declined participation.
Each inmate who showed up for the testing session received
a thank you letter and a chocolate bar, regardless of their
completion of the testing protocol. Some participants did not
complete all the assessments, in which case the data from
both members of the matched pair were eliminated from the
study. In one case, there was a tape recorder malfunction,
limiting the number of role-plays available for scoring and
analysis. A total of 26 men took part in the study.
Fifty-five inmates were initially screened using the
Symptom Checklist-90­Revised (SCL-90-R; Derogatis,
1983) to eliminate participants with psychotic features; none
were excluded from the study based on that criterion. Each
testing session took less than an hour and was conducted by
trained volunteers. The paper and pencil questionnaires were
completed by participants in a group assessment session; the
role-plays were done individually and privately.
Measures.
Paper-and-pencil questionnaires included the
SCL-90-R (Derogatis, 1983) as a screening device, Mindful-
ness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS; Brown & Ryan,
2003), Self-Compassion Scale (Neff, 2003), and Brief Anger
and Aggression Questionnaire (BAAQ; Maiuro, Vitaliano, &
Cahn, 1987). Inmates also participated in a role-play involv-
ing difficult interpersonal situations; the role-plays were
adapted from Rosenberg's work (1999).
The SCL-90-R (Derogatis, 1983) is a self-report psycho-
logical symptom checklist. It is composed of 90 questions
that measure psychological distress. The checklist is based
on a 5-point Likert-type scale where a lower score indicates
less symptom severity. The items are rated on a scale of 0
(not at all) to 5 (extremely).
The MAAS is a self-report 15-item questionnaire devel-
oped by Brown and Ryan (2003) that is based on a Likert-
type scale where a higher score indicates increased
mindfulness. Items are rated on a scale of 1 (almost always)
to 6 (almost never). The MAAS has good convergent, dis-
criminant, and construct validity; internal consistency across
samples (explicit measures  = 0.85; state mindfulness  =
0.92); and excellent test-retest reliability (r = .81, p < .0001;
Brown & Ryan, 2003). The MAAS indicates the presence or
absence of attention to and awareness of what is occurring in
the present; it does not necessarily indicate attributes such as
acceptance, trust, empathy, or gratitude. Some sample
MAAS items include "I find it difficult to stay focused on
what's happening in the present" and "I do jobs or tasks auto-
matically, without being aware of what I'm doing."
The Self-Compassion Scale (Neff, 2003) measures the
ability to recognize a broader human context and lessen self-
judgment. It consists of a 26-item self-report questionnaire
based on a Likert-type scale where a higher score indicates
more self-compassion. The items are rated from 1 (almost
never) to 5 (almost always). The internal consistency of the
Self-Compassion Scale equals .92; it has good construct,
convergent, and discriminant validity; and it has a test-retest
reliability of .93 (Neff, 2003). According to Neff's conceptu-
alization and psychometric construction of the test, self-com-
passion implies mindfulness and the Self-Compassion test
includes a Mindfulness subscale. The Mindfulness subscale
particularly measures over-identification with what is occur-
ring. Some examples of items from the Mindfulness subscale
include "When something upsets me I try to keep my emo-
tions in balance," "When I'm feeling down I try to approach
my feelings with curiosity and openness," and "When I fail
at something important to me I try to keep things in
perspective."
The BAAQ (Maiuro et al., 1987) includes items that
address assault, indirect hostility, irritability, negativism,
resentment, and verbal hostility. The BAAQ is a self-report
6-item questionnaire based on a 5-point Likert-type scale
where a higher score indicates greater anger. The items are
rated on a scale of 0 (extremely unlikely) to 4 (very likely). It
has an internal consistency of .82 and reliability of .84. It
6 SAGE Open
provides a good general measure of anger and dyscontrol
behavior (Maiuro et al., 1987). Examples of items include
"When I really lose my temper I am capable of hitting or
slapping someone" and "When I get mad I say threatening
and nasty things."
The role-play protocol is reported in Table 1 and scoring
categories in Table 2. The protocols were adapted, with per-
mission, from Rosenberg's Nonviolent Communication: A
Language of Compassion (1999). Six interviewers were
trained in how to instruct the participants on the task and
introduce the role-plays. The interviewers worked one-on-
one with each participant. A training scenario and two
scorable role-plays were serially presented to each partici-
pant. Participants were allowed to respond to the protocol
questions at will. All the role-play responses were tape
recorded, transcribed, and coded by trained coders blind to
participants' group memberships. The coders were two grad-
uate students trained in the scoring protocol via education
about NVC concepts and scoring of mock responses until
establishing an inter-rater reliability of 75%.
Based on the transcription, each phrase uttered by a partici-
pant was rated for the presence or absence of each of the four
response criteria (Table 2); in other words, each phrase was
rated dichotomously four times. The number of "yes" answers
in each category represents the number of times the partici-
pants said a phrase that met that NVC evaluative criteria.
Results
A paired-sample t test for the SCL-R-90, which was used as
a pre-screening test, revealed no significant differences
between the groups (M
trained
= 52.2, SD = 39.6; M
untrained
=
59.8, SD = 42.8), t(24) = 0.47, p = .64, indicating similar
levels of mental health symptomatology in both groups.
To look at the relationship among Freedom Project train-
ing and mindfulness and anger, we conducted a MANOVA

Table 2. Main Evaluative Criteria for Qualitative Assessment of Nonviolent Communication Skills.
A. Identifying and expressing own feelings
 Adjectives or adjectival clauses describing psychological or emotional state
and  Use "I" or "we"
or  An assessment or description of "how I feel" vs. "how I think."
or  Don't follow "feel" with
^that, like, as if, I, you, he, she, they, it
 ^names or nouns
^passive voice
or  Conditional feelings--would, might, may, could--followed by feeling word
B. Taking responsibility for own feelings
 "Because" must be followed by "I" or "we"
and  Don't blame others
and  Do not use "it" or "that" as the subject noun
and  Not conditional feeling
C. Explains own needs/requests what he wants
 Uses positive language. I want it. vs. I don't want it.
and  Uses concrete and clear language
and  Does not attack, judge, criticize if request not met
or  Asks question expecting an answer
D. Receives empathetically
 Ask permission before offering advice or reassurance
and  Don't intellectualize
and  Verbalize other's observations, feelings, needs, requests
and  Don't try to fix it by giving advice
or Paraphrase
Note. If there is a "yes" and "no" within one category, the final decision is "yes."

with one independent variable with two levels (training and
control) and three dependent variables (MAAS, Mindfulness
subscale from the Self-Compassion Scale, and BAAQ). Of
significance were the omnibus test of significance ( =
.8086), F(1, 24) = 5.69, p = .02, and the effects of training on
the Mindfulness subscale, F(1, 24) = 4.55, p = .04, and
BAAQ, F(1, 24) = 4.30, p = .04; the effect on the MAAS was
not significant, F(1, 24) = 0.09, p = .76.
A Pearson Correlational Analysis of the BAAQ and the
number of hours of training (excluding those who received
no training) showed a significant correlation (r = -.368, p =
.02). The more training hours completed, the lower the anger
score. A histogram revealed that the number of hours of
training was not linear with the Mindfulness subscale.
Role-play data analysis. A total of 90 phrases were uttered by
all participants, which gave a grand total of 360 coded
responses. Fifty-three out of the 64 responses (83%) coded
as meeting a criterion of NVC communication were given by
Freedom Project trained participants. Out of the 296
responses, 135 (46%) that were neutral or did not meet the
NVC criteria were given by the trained participants. A chi-
square analysis was highly significant, with more responses
given by Freedom Project trainees meeting the NVC criteria,
2(1) = 29.19, p < .01.
As most of the phrases rated as "Identifying and express-
ing own feelings" were also rated as "Taking responsibility
for own feelings" and these two rating criteria might not
have been independent, the statistical analysis was repeated,
excluding the first category; in other words, a total of 90
responses (22 "yes" counts and 68 "no" counts) were dropped
from the analysis, leaving 270 ratings. The chi-square analy-
sis remained highly significant, with more responses given
by Freedom Project trainees meeting the NVC criteria, 2(1)
= 16.46, p < .01.
Discussion
Although mindfulness training is already well established as
an intervention for inmates, we found that different measures
of mindfulness tapped different concepts and resulted in dif-
ferent effects. The Freedom Project training had a significant
effect on the mindfulness component of the Self-Compassion
scale, which focuses on maintaining a balanced view of a
situation, in other words, on equanimity. No effects were
found on the MAAS, which is a mindfulness measure more
concentrated on attentional focus.
Substantial effects were noted on the BAAQ, indicating
reduction in anger among inmates who had received Freedom
Project training. The number of hours of training was signifi-
cantly related to a reduction in anger.
According to the role-play analysis, inmates who had
been trained in the Freedom Project approach were signifi-
cantly more likely to use nonviolent communication skills
than their untrained counterparts. Inmates who had received
training were much more likely to identify and express their
own feelings, to take responsibility for them, to be able to
explain their own needs or make requests without imposing
demands, and to express empathy. In other words, partici-
pants trained in the Freedom Project skills gave responses
that were not commonplace among the general prison
population.
Summary and Concluding Discussion
The aim of this article was to explore the effects of Freedom
Project training. The first study investigated whether the train-
ing in mindfulness and nonviolent communication affected the
recidivism rate. Results indicated significantly less recidivism
among former inmates trained by Freedom Project than among
those who were not. Even among trained men, those who were
more likely to return to prison had significantly fewer hours of
training. Extrapolating, if 37% of returnees are expected to
reoffend, but only 21% of Freedom Project trainees did so, and
if the cost of keeping a man in prison is U.S. $98 per day, train-
ing by Freedom Project has saved the state of Washington
US$5,065,320.00 per year (Table 3).
We also explored specific behavioral and attitudinal out-
comes of training that may prevent reoffending. The results
of the second study found significant differences between the
group of inmates trained by the Freedom Project and a
matched pair group of inmates with no training. The results
are based on a small, matched-pair sample and are prelimi-
nary. The study found that self-reports of inmates trained by
Freedom Project showed significantly improved self-com-
passion and mindfulness when compared with matched con-
trols as measured by the Self-Compassion Scale, but not as
measured by the MAAS. The measurement of anger (BAAQ)
showed improvement: the more hours of training, the less
anger expressed by participants. A replication with a larger
sample is highly recommended. Behavioral observations
demonstrated very striking differences in the communica-
tions styles of the trained and untrained groups, with Freedom
Project trained inmates being significantly better able to use
the basic NVC skills of identifying and expressing their own
feelings, taking responsibility for them, and explaining their
own needs without imposing demands.

In spite of the limitations of research based on pre-exis-
tent interventions, the evidence is strengthened by the use of
a wide variety of measurement modes, including long-term
follow-up effects, self-report measures, and behavioral
observations. We believe the results from these studies are
suggestive of behavioral improvement and promising of
highly beneficial social impact of the training. We hope to
see further research continued. Recommended further
research would include a replication of this study with a
larger population, placebo-controlled studies of recidivism
after training, process research including correlates with
physiological measures and analysis of the relationship
between improvements in anger and nonviolent communica-
tion skills on the one hand, and incidence of disciplinary
action while incarcerated on the other. In addition, the gener-
alizability of the second study can be improved by including
diverse cultural and ethnic participants. Random-assignment
control trial studies are also recommended, because of the
problem of self-selection into the training group.
