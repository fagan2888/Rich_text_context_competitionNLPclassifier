Background: The prevalence and incidence of end-
stage renal disease in the United States are increasing, but
milder renal disease is much more common and may of-
ten go undiagnosed and undertreated.
Methods: A cross-sectional study of a representative
sample of the US population was conducted using
16589 adult participants aged 17 years and older in the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES III) conducted from 1988 to 1994. An
elevated serum creatinine level was defined as 141
µmol/L or higher (1.6 mg/dL) for men and 124
µmol/L or higher (1.4 mg/dL) for women (99th per-
centile for healthy young adults) and was the main out-
come measure.
Results: Higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures,
presence of hypertension, antihypertensive medication
use, older age, and diabetes mellitus were all associated
with higher serum creatinine levels. An estimated 3.0%
(5.6 million) of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US popu-
lation had elevated serum creatinine levels, 70% of whom
were hypertensive. Among hypertensive individuals with
an elevated serum creatinine level, 75% received treat-
ment. However, only 11% of all individuals with hyper-
tension had their blood pressure reduced to lower than
130/85 mm Hg (the Sixth Report of the Joint National
Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of
High Blood Pressure recommendation for hypertensive
individuals with renal disease); 27% had a blood pres-
sure lower than 140/90 mm Hg. Treated hypertensive in-
dividuals with an elevated creatinine level had a mean
blood pressure of 147/77 mm Hg, 48% of whom were pre-
scribed one antihypertensive medication.
Conclusion: Elevated serum creatinine level, an indi-
cator of chronic renal disease, is common and strongly
related to inadequate treatment of high blood pressure.

ADEQUATE BLOOD pressure
control is widely recog-
nized as an essential fac-
tor in slowing the pro-
gression of chronic renal
disease and preventing its main sequelae,
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and car-
diovascular disease.1-7 As a result, antihy-
pertensive blood pressure treatment goals
are lower for individuals with both
hypertension and chronic renal disease
(130/85 mm Hg for individuals with
1 g/d of proteinuria and 125/75 mm
Hg for individuals with 1 g/d of pro-
teinuria) than for hypertensive indivi-
duals without target organ damage
(140/90 mm Hg).6 At the same time, in-
dividuals with chronic renal disease are
usually asymptomatic and often go undi-
agnosed. Thus, hypertension may be un-
dertreated among patients with chronic re-
nal disease. Data on the adequacy of blood
pressure treatment in this group are criti-
cal for preventive efforts to stem the epi-
demic of ESRD8 and cardiovascular dis-
ease in chronic renal disease.9
The Third National Health and Nu-
trition Examination Survey (NHANES III)
data offer the first opportunity to study the
prevalence and number of people with
chronic renal disease (detected by an el-
evated serum creatinine level) in a nation-
ally representative sample. An initial analy-
sis from NHANES III showed that the
prevalence of elevated serum creatinine
level was higher among non-Hispanic
blacks than non-Hispanic whites and
higher among older than younger indi-
viduals.10 The present analysis was under-
taken to measure the prevalence of el-
evated serum creatinine level across
different categories of blood pressure and
antihypertensive medication use. In ad-
dition, we examined the number and type
of antihypertensive medications used and
the achieved blood pressure among indi-
viduals with elevated serum creatinine lev-
els who were prescribed medicine for hy-

both elevated serum creatinine levels and hypertension
are inadequately treated.
RESULTS
Table 1 gives the number of survey participants by de-
mographic group, diabetes mellitus, and blood pressure
category as well as estimates of the proportion of indi-
viduals, mean serum creatinine levels, and prevalence of
elevated creatinine levels for the civilian, noninstitution-
alized US population. Overall, from 1988 to 1994, the
prevalence of elevated serum creatinine level was 3.0%,
corresponding to 5.6 million adults (803 survey
participants). Older age and diabetes mellitus were very
strongly associated with a higher prevalence of elevated
creatinine level. Non-Hispanic blacks had a higher preva-
lence and Mexican Americans had a lower prevalence of
elevated creatinine level than non-Hispanic whites. Higher
categories of blood pressure, hypertension status, and use
of antihypertensive medications were associated with
higher mean serum creatinine level and a higher preva-
lence of elevated serum creatinine level. Elevated serum
creatinine level was 8 times more common in hyperten-
sive (9.1%) than normotensive (1.1%) individuals and
8 times more common in people already using medica-
tion for high blood pressure compared with people not
using such medication (13.0% vs 1.6%).
Figure 1 shows that the prevalence of elevated se-
rum creatinine level was markedly higher in individuals
treated for hypertension compared with untreated indi-
viduals at every category of blood pressure. Among un-
treated individuals, prevalence of elevated serum creati-
nine level increased monotonically with higher blood
pressure categories from 0.8 % to 13.6%. Among treated
individuals, the association of prevalence of elevated se-
rum creatinine level with blood pressure was J-shaped.
Prevalence was lower in individuals with normal blood
pressure (6.3%) compared with individuals with opti-
mal blood pressure (9.8%) or higher levels of blood pres-
sure. The higher prevalence of elevated creatinine level
among treated hypertensive individuals with an opti-
mal blood pressure cannot be estimated reliably given the
relatively small size of this group (189 participants; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 3%-16%). In persons with high-
normal blood pressure, the prevalence was 13.6%, fol-
lowed by a steady increase from 13.3% to 22.5% in hy-
pertension stages 1 to 3. The ratio of prevalence rates of
treated to untreated individuals declined with increas-
ing blood pressure category from 12.2 for optimal blood
pressure category to 1.7 for stage 3 hypertension; hence,
the relative difference in prevalence between the un-
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
We estimated the burden of hypertension-related chronic re-
nal disease using 16589 participants aged 17 years and older
in NHANES III. This survey, conducted from 1988 to 1994
by the National Center for Health Statistics (Hyattsville, Md)
of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta,
Ga), provides cross-sectional, nationally representative data
on the health and nutritional status of the civilian, noninsti-
tutionalized US population.11,12 Non-Hispanic blacks and
Mexican Americans as well as the elderly and children were
deliberately oversampled in this survey. This oversampling
makes it possible to obtain reliable estimates of the distribu-
tion of creatinine in the 2 largest minority groups of the ci-
vilian,noninstitutionalizedUSpopulationaswellasinabroad
range of age groups. Standardized questionnaires were ad-
ministered in the home, followed by a detailed physical ex-
amination at a mobile examination center.
MEASUREMENTS
Blood pressure measurements were obtained 3 times dur-
ing the home interview and another 3 times during the ex-
amination. Each measurement was made using a mercury
sphygmomanometer, with the participant seated. The arith-
metic mean was then calculated using all available sys-
tolic and diastolic readings. In this analysis, individuals with
a systolic blood pressure lower than 140 mm Hg and di-
astolic blood pressure lower than 90 mm Hg who were not
receiving antihypertensive treatment were defined as nor-
motensive. Individuals were classified as hypertensive if they
had a mean blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher (sys-
tolic) or 90 mm Hg or higher (diastolic) or reported
current use of medication for hypertension.13 Among the
hypertensive participants, we further categorized individu-
als by treatment status. Individuals were considered not
treated if they had hypertension at the time of the survey
and did not report taking antihypertensive medication, re-
gardless of whether these individuals had been previously
diagnosed as hypertensive. We also analyzed the medica-
tions prescribed and classified them as angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers,
-blockers, -blockers or -agonists, or diuretics.
Serum was collected at the mobile examination cen-
ter and creatinine measurements were performed at the
White Sands Research Center laboratory, Almogordo, NM,
by the modified kinetic Jaffe reaction14 using a Hitachi 737
analyzer (Boehringer Mannheim Corporation, Indianapo-
lis, Ind) and were reported using conventional units (1 mg/
dL=88.4 µmol/L). The coefficient of variation for creati-
nine determination ranged from 0.2% to 1.4% during the
6 years of the NHANES III study. Data on physiologic varia-
tion in creatinine level were obtained in a sample of 1921
participants who had a second creatinine measurement. The
assay had very stable quality-control measures for the du-
ration of the study. A review of the College of American
Pathologists Survey data indicates that the laboratory mean
value for serum creatinine levels during 1992-1994 was
within acceptable limits but higher than the mean value of
all laboratories surveyed.
Blood pressure was categorized according to the Sixth
Joint National Committee Report on Detection, Evalua-
tion, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-VI).6 Per-
sons were categorized into 6 groups based on the higher
of their systolic or diastolic blood pressure measurement:
(1) optimal blood pressure (120 mm Hg systolic and 80
mm Hg diastolic); (2) normal blood pressure (120-130

treated and treated groups narrowed at categories of higher
blood pressure.
Figure 2 shows that the distribution of individuals
with elevated serum creatinine levels across blood pres-
sure categories is markedly different from the association
of prevalence rates with blood pressure categories shown
in Figure 1. The prevalence of elevated serum creatinine
level was greatest in persons with stage 3 hypertension. In
contrast, the largest number of the individuals with an el-
evated serum creatinine level was in the stage 1 hyperten-
sion category (Figure 2), the most common form of hy-
pertension (56% of all hypertensive individuals). More
individuals with an elevated serum creatinine level were
treatedthannottreatedforbloodpressurecategoriesofhigh-
normal and above. The largest number of cases within a
specific category was in treated persons with blood pres-
sure in the stage 1 hypertension category (n=1.1 million
treated and 0.5 million untreated or 29% of all individuals
with an elevated serum creatinine level). Among the
hypertensive individuals with elevated serum creatinine
levels, 75% were treated, of whom only 36% had a blood
pressure lower than 140/90 mm Hg (the JNC-VI recom-
mendation for hypertensive individuals without target
organ damage) and only 14% had their blood pressure re-
duced to lower than 130/85 mm Hg (the JNC-VI recom-
mendation for hypertensive individuals with renal
disease).6,16 Overall, only 11% of all hypertensive individu-
als with an elevated serum creatinine level had their blood
pressure reduced to lower than 130/85 mm Hg and 27%
hadabloodpressurelowerthan140/90mmHg.Usinglower
or higher cutoff values to define elevated serum creatinine
level influenced the prevalence of elevated creatinine level
(11.7%ofmenhadacreatininelevelof124µmol/L[1.4
mg/dL] and 9.3% of women had a creatinine level of 106
µmol/L [1.2 mg/dL]) but not the shape of the associa-
tion with blood pressure category.
Table 2 also gives the prevalence and number of
cases of elevated serum creatinine level in the major eth-
nic subgroups as well as among older individuals. The
number of individuals in subgroup analyses was smaller,
which resulted in decreased precision as indicated by the
higher standard errors. The prevalence rate of elevated
serum creatinine level among treated hypertensive indi-
viduals was greatest in non-Hispanic blacks (19.3%), fol-
lowed by non-Hispanic whites (11.9%) and Mexican
Americans (8.1%). Among individuals older than 60 years,
the prevalence of elevated creatinine level was higher
among treated (18.0%) than untreated (6.9%) individu-
als. Seventy-seven percent of all individuals with el-
evated creatinine were at least 60 years old.
Individuals using antihypertensive medication for
controlling blood pressure consistent with stage 1 hy-
mm Hg systolic and 80-85 mm Hg diastolic); (3) high-
normal blood pressure (130-139 mm Hg systolic or 85-89
mm Hg diastolic); (4) stage 1 hypertension (140-159
mm Hg systolic or 90-99 mm Hg diastolic); (5) stage 2
hypertension (160-179 mm Hg systolic or 100-109 mm Hg
diastolic); and (6) stage 3 hypertension (180 mm Hg
systolic or 110 mm Hg diastolic).
The primary outcome measure in this analysis was el-
evated serum creatinine level (defined as a sex-specific cut-
off point of 141 µmol/L [1.6 mg/dL] for men and 124
µmol/L [1.4 mg/dL] for women). These cutoffs, which
are higher than the reported reference range for serum cre-
atinine level using this assay, were used to provide greater
specificity when defining chronic renal disease based on a
single serum creatinine measurement. These criteria cor-
respond to the 99.4th and 99.8th percentiles for men and
women aged 20 to 39 years without diabetes or hyperten-
sion in this study. In this young healthy group, the mean
(SD) creatinine level was 101 (13) µmol/L (1.14 [0.15] mg/
dL) for men and 80 (15) µmol/L (0.91 [0.17] mg/dL) for
women (29% and 35% lower than the cutoffs for elevated
serum creatinine level). Because serum creatinine level is
inversely proportional to glomerular filtration rate, young
individuals with elevated serum creatinine levels are likely
to have lost approximately a third of their renal function
while older persons with elevated creatinine levels will have
lost even more function because muscle mass and creati-
nine production decreases with age. Analyses were re-
peated using alternative cutoff points and yielded similar
results.
Diabetes was defined by participants' medical history
as well as their blood glucose value. The primary analysis
stratified individuals based on a history of diagnosed dia-
betes mellitus because this information was available for
nearly all individuals and could be used by physicians for
risk stratification. Ancillary analyses examined the impact
of using the American Diabetes Association (ADA) crite-
ria15 for diabetes mellitus in the subset of individuals who
fasted at least 8 hours.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The complex survey design of NHANES III incorporated
differential probabilities of selection. To derive national es-
timates, sampling weights were used to adjust for noncov-
erage and nonresponse. All prevalence estimates were
weighted to represent the civilian, noninstitutionalized US
population and to account for oversampling and nonre-
sponse to the household interview and physical examina-
tion.12 All data analyses were conducted using STATA svy
commands (Stata Corporation, College Station, Tex; 1999)
for analyzing complex survey design data with 49 strata and
98 primary sampling units. A total of 16589 participants
(82.7%) of 20050 examined had both blood pressure and
serum creatinine data available for this analysis. The rate
of missing data was higher among older than younger in-
dividuals (individuals missing data were 4 years older),
higher among men than among with women (17.9% vs
16.7%), and lower among Mexican Americans and other
ethnicities (14%) than among non-Hispanic whites (19%)
and non-Hispanic blacks (18%). These differences were pri-
marily owing to missing phlebotomy data. To minimize bias,
the combined mobile examination center and home ex-
amination weights were divided by the proportion of par-
ticipants missing creatinine data in each of the design age,
sex, and race ethnicity strata. This corrected differences
caused by missing data across sampling strata but as-
sumed that data are missing randomly within strata.

pressure categories in both individuals with diabetes melli-
tus and individuals without diabetes mellitus, which is
similar to the total population. Individuals with diabe-
tes mellitus treated for high blood pressure (18.4%) had
a higher prevalence of elevated serum creatinine level than
treated individuals without diabetes mellitus (12.0%). Un-
treated individuals with diabetes mellitus (7.8%) had a
higher prevalence of elevated serum creatinine level than
untreated individuals without diabetes mellitus (1.4%).
The associations with blood pressure categories were simi-
lar to those in the total population. The inclusion of un-
diagnosed individuals with both diabetes mellitus and fast-
ing hyperglycemia (2.7% of the population17) increased
the prevalence of diabetes mellitus and slightly de-
creased the prevalence of elevated serum creatinine level
among individuals with diabetes mellitus, but it altered
very little the prevalence among the much larger num-
ber of individuals without diabetes mellitus.
Hypertensive individuals were more likely to be non-
Hispanic black and older and have diabetes mellitus than
the rest of the general population. With the use of logistic
regression analysis (after adjustment for age, race, sex, dia-
betes, and a history of stroke, congestive heart failure, and
cardiovascular disease) the prevalence of elevated serum
creatinine level was still directly associated with higher
blood pressure category, with the highest risk seen at stage
3 hypertension (Table 4; P=.001). Repeating the analy-
sisbyestimatinganadjustedoddsratioforeachoftheblood
pressure categories by hypertension treatment group com-
pared with individuals with optimal blood pressure with-
out treatment (last 2 columns of Table 4) yielded wider
CIs and some attenuation of the association. However,
the prevalence of elevated serum creatinine level re-
mained associated with both elevated blood pressure and
blood pressure treatment.
Table 5 gives the number of antihypertensive medi-
cations used to treat hypertensive individuals by the pres-
ence of elevated serum creatinine level and achieved mean
blood pressure (this analysis is unweighted owing to small
numbers in some data cells). Hypertensive individuals
with an elevated serum creatinine level were more likely
to be treated than hypertensive individuals with a lower
serum creatinine level (75% vs 49%; P.001). When
treated, persons with an elevated serum creatinine level

were prescribed a higher mean number of medications
(1.7 vs 1.4; P=.001) and, consequently, were more likely
to be prescribed every type of antihypertensive medica-
tion. In a logistic regression model among individuals with
hypertension (which adjusted for the number of medi-
cations prescribed, age, sex, race, and diabetes) the pres-
ence of elevated creatinine level was positively associ-
ated with the prescription of diuretics (odds ratio, 1.7;
95% CI, 1.4-2.2), negatively associated with prescrip-
tion of -blockers (odds ratio, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-0.9), and
not associated with prescription of angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitors (odds ratio, 0.8; 95% CI,
0.6-1.0) or other agents.
Regardless of the number of medications they re-
ceived, individuals with an elevated serum creatinine level
had a slightly higher mean systolic blood pressure than
individuals with a lower serum creatinine level (signifi-
cant before but not after adjustment for age). In con-
trast, their mean diastolic blood pressure was slightly, al-
though often not significantly, lower with 48% of
individuals prescribed only 1 medication. Individuals pre-
scribed 2 medications had a lower mean blood pressure
than individuals prescribed 1 medication, despite the ten-
dency to prescribe more medications to individuals with
more severe underlying hypertension.
The analyses were repeated using different defini-
tions of antihypertensive medication treatment and dif-
ferent cutoffs for elevated serum creatinine level to ex-
amine the consistency of our results. The proportion of
individuals with an elevated serum creatinine level who
were taking antihypertensive medications for any indi-
cation was 66%, somewhat higher than the percentage
of these individuals reporting medical treatment for hy-
pertension (52%). However, the pattern of the associa-
tion between elevated serum creatinine level and blood
pressure category as well as medication use was similar.

A sample of 1921 NHANES III participants had a
second creatinine measurement at a mean (SD) of 17.5
(8.0) days after the initial examination. The second cre-
atinine measurement showed good agreement with the
initial creatinine measurement. The mean (SD) percent
difference between the 2 measurements was 0.2% (9.7%).
The percent difference was independent of the time dif-
ference between the visits and the absolute creatinine level.
This amount of measurement error was added to the ob-
served creatinine data in a computer simulation to esti-
mate its possible impact on prevalence estimates. The
prevalence of elevated serum creatinine level increased
by a factor of 1.19 in women and 1.25 in men, suggest-
ing that the effect of measurement error and short-term
physiologic variation on our estimates of the prevalence
of elevated serum creatinine level was moderate.
COMMENT
Our results show that approximately 5.6 million indi-
viduals in the civilian, noninstitutionalized US popula-
tion have elevated serum creatinine levels, 25 times the
number of prevalent ESRD cases, and 108 times the num-
ber of incident ESRD cases in 1991 (the midpoint of
NHANES III). Elevated serum creatinine level is rare
among young and middle-aged individuals with opti-
mal blood pressure (1% prevalence) and becomes in-
creasingly more common among individuals in higher
blood pressure categories as well as among individuals
using antihypertensive medications. Most (75%) hyper-
tensive persons with elevated serum creatinine levels in
the US population are treated with antihypertensive medi-
cations, but most are treated suboptimally. These cross-
sectional data are consistent with the hypothesis that
poorly controlled hypertension is responsible for much
of the high-burden chronic kidney disease, but the data
can only demonstrate a strong association, not temporal
sequence or causation. The largest number of individu-
als with an elevated serum creatinine level have blood
pressure in the stage 1 hypertension category. Only half
of the treated hypertensive individuals with an elevated
serum creatinine level are receiving more than 1 antihy-
pertensive medication, and only 36% of them meet the
blood pressure guidelines for individuals without target
organ damage (140/90 mm Hg, also the target blood
pressure for all hypertensive individuals since 198816,18),
while only 14% of treated hypertensive individuals meet
the blood pressure guidelines proposed in 199119 for per-
sons with renal disease (130/85 mm Hg). Given that
effective antihypertensive treatment can slow the pro-
gression of renal disease, this finding implies that im-
proved management of hypertension might have a ma-
jor impact on stemming the epidemic of ESRD and
cardiovascular disease in chronic renal disease.
Individuals with chronic renal disease have an in-
creased risk of developing ESRD or death.20-23 End-stage
renal disease is a major public health problem in the
United States. Data from the US Renal Data System shows
a prevalence of 304083 treated ESRD cases (110/
100000) and an incidence of 79102 cases (28.7/100000
person years) in 1997.8 Mortality among patients treated
by dialysis is approximately 23% per year, with cardio-
vascular disease being the major cause of death. Annual
treatment costs for patients treated with dialysis ex-
ceeded $15 billion in 1997.
High blood pressure is an important independent
predictor of the development and progression of chronic
renal disease as well as morbidity and mortality in pa-
tients with chronic renal disease.2,24,25 Prospective stud-
ies have shown the relationship between blood pressure
and incidence of renal disease to be positive and con-
tinuous throughout the entire spectrum of blood pres-
sure categories.2,24,26 As a result, the JNC-VI guidelines
suggest lower target blood pressure goals for individu-
als with renal disease (130/85 mm Hg for individuals
without proteinuria and 125/75 mm Hg for individu-
als with proteinuria).6 Experience from recent clinical tri-
als (Hypertension Optimal Treatment [HOT], Antihy-

pertensive and Lipid Lowering to Prevent Heart Attack
[ALLHAT], United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study
[UKPDS], and Controlled Onset Verapamil Investiga-
tion of Cardiovascular Endpoints [CONVINCE]) has
shown that low blood pressure goals can be achieved with
high rates of success.27 More than 90% of the patients in
the HOT trial achieved the diastolic blood pressure goal
of 90 mm Hg or lower. The 470 HOT trial participants
with a serum creatinine level of 132.6 µmol/L (1.5 mg/
dL) or higher required more antihypertensive medica-
tions than patients with a lower serum creatinine level
(2.8 vs 2.4 medication escalation steps) but achieved their
blood pressure target just as often (71% vs 70%).28 Par-
ticipants in the African-American Study of Kidney Dis-
ease and Hypertension (AASK) had a glomerular filtra-
tion rate of 70 mL/min per 1.73 m2 or lower at baseline
and were randomized to a mean arterial pressure lower
than 92 mm Hg or 102 to 107 mm Hg. At entry, 66% had
a mean arterial pressure higher than 107 mm Hg. After
4 months on the assigned treatment, this was reduced
to 27% of the participants assigned to the blood pres-
sure goal of 102 to 107 mm Hg and 11% of the partici-
pants assigned to the goal of lower than 92 mm Hg. These
marked improvements in blood pressure control were
achieved in a relatively uniform manner across educa-
tion and income subgroups.29
The prevalence of elevated serum creatinine level
was much higher among individuals treated for hyper-
tension compared with untreated hypertensive indi-
viduals across all categories of blood pressure. These
cross-sectional data should not be used to argue that an-
tihypertensive treatment does not slow the progression
of renal disease. First, despite similar current blood pres-
sure levels in treated and untreated individuals, treated
individuals are likely to have a longer duration of high
blood pressure as well as a greater past severity of hy-
pertension, both of which are risk factors for nephro-
sclerosis.30 Second, antihypertensive medications may de-
crease glomerular filtration rate by decreasing systemic
and glomerular capillary pressure and thus increasing se-
rum creatinine levels. Angiotensin-converting enzyme in-
hibitors, for example, often increase serum creatinine lev-
els by up to 20% at the initiation of therapy with greater
increases seen among patients with bilateral renal vas-
cular disease31 and smaller increases in unselected pa-
tients with chronic renal disease.32-34 Third, and most im-
portantly, a wealth of clinical trial data supports the benefit
of effective antihypertensive therapy in slowing the pro-
gression of renal disease.
Blacks have a disproportionately higher incidence
of ESRD than whites overall, especially ESRD due to hy-
pertension.35-38 Our data show that although there are
more whites (4.2 million) than blacks (1.1 million) with
elevated serum creatinine levels, blacks have a greater
prevalence of elevated serum creatinine level than whites
(5.3% vs 2.9%). The number of cases with an elevated
serum creatinine level in each group can be compared
with the number of incident ESRD cases in 1991 based
on the US Renal Data System.39 This ratio is 1.3 ESRD
cases per 100 individuals with an elevated serum creati-
nine level for blacks compared with 0.8 ESRD cases per
100 individuals with an elevated serum creatinine level
for whites. These data suggest that blacks are at an ap-
proximately 1.7 times higher risk of an elevated serum
creatinine level progressing into ESRD compared with
whites (the ratio is higher if a definition of elevated se-
rum creatinine level with higher cutoffs for blacks than
whites is used). This observation also raises the ques-
tion of whether competing causes of death differ be-
tween blacks and whites among patients with elevated
serum creatinine levels.
Most individuals with elevated serum creatinine lev-
els are in older age groups. While the prevalence of el-
evated serum creatinine level is associated with higher
blood pressure in this group, 6.1% of older individuals
without hypertension have an elevated serum creati-
nine level. This represents 18% of all individuals with el-
evated serum creatinine levels and emphasizes the need
for interventions other than blood pressure control to slow
the progression of renal disease. It also emphasizes the
limitation of screening for renal disease only among in-
dividuals with hypertension.
Use of a single cutoff to define an elevated serum
creatinine level may have limited accuracy in light of age
and ethnic differences in serum creatinine levels. Younger
individuals, especially among men and blacks, have
slightly higher serum creatinine levels owing to greater
muscle mass. Adjusting for muscle mass was not pos-
sible because of limited availability of data in NHANES
III. Although there is no gold standard to measure the
actual specificity of our definition, it is possible to ob-
tain a lower-limit estimate of specificity by assuming that
none of the individuals with optimal blood pressure with-
out antihypertensive treatment have renal disease. Only
0.8% of these individuals have elevated serum creati-
nine levels, indicating an approximate specificity of at
least 99.2%. The specificity is likely to vary by race and
age because the definition was sex specific, but not race
or age specific. The percentages of untreated individu-
als with an optimal blood pressure who did not have el-
evated serum creatinine levels were 99.1%, 98.8%, and
99.8% among non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks,
and Mexican Americans, respectively, and 99.7%, 99.4%,
and 93.7% among patients aged 17 to 39, 40 to 59, and
over 60 years, respectively. Different definitions of el-
evated serum creatinine level would yield somewhat dif-
ferent estimates of the number of individuals with an el-
evated serum creatinine level in the population. However,
the pattern of the association with blood pressure cat-
egory and antihypertensive treatment was largely unaf-
fected.
Although a stringent criterion for elevated serum cre-
atinine level was used overall, a single measurement of
serum creatinine level has limitations in measuring true
renal function. First, although serum creatinine level var-
ies inversely with the level of glomerular filtration rate,
it is also affected by factors other than glomerular filtra-
tion rate. In addition to age, sex, and race, dietary in-
take of protein (in particular cooked meat) is an inde-
pendent determinant of creatinine production. Second,
increased tubular secretion of creatinine causes the rise
in serum creatinine level to lag behind the decline in glo-
merular filtration rate. Third, numerous studies have
shown that a reduced glomerular filtration rate is not a

sensitive indicator of chronic renal disease. Glomerular
adaptations such as increased glomerular capillary pres-
sure and hypertrophy can increase single nephron glo-
merular filtration rate, thereby maintaining a normal glo-
merular filtration rate despite a reduction in nephron
number.40 Misclassification is especially likely in the el-
derly because of the simultaneous age-related decline in
glomerular filtration rate and muscle mass, leading to only
minimal elevation in serum creatinine level despite re-
duced renal function. Therefore, misclassification of older
individuals is especially likely.
Equations exist to estimate creatinine clearance41 and
glomerular filtration rate42 based on serum creatinine level,
but their application requires a number of assumptions,
which are avoided by use of an empirically observed preva-
lence of elevated serum creatinine level. Despite the above
limitations, studies have shown that serum creatinine level
has a high specificity but low sensitivity for detecting
chronic renal disease43 (thus indicating the high prob-
ability of correctly identifying the presence of disease),
but many cases of chronic renal disease will be missed
by applying this and any other diagnostic criterion based
on serum creatinine level alone. Our results, therefore,
should be considered an underestimate of the number
of individuals with impaired renal function, especially
among the elderly.
CONCLUSIONS
The burden of chronic renal disease extends far beyond
ESRD. There are 25 cases of elevated serum creatinine level
for every prevalent ESRD case and 108 cases of elevated
serum creatinine level for every incident ESRD case. Our
results show that chronic renal disease is strongly associ-
ated with inadequate blood pressure control. Most indi-
viduals with chronic renal disease are hypertensive and
receive medications for controlling blood pressure. How-
ever, most of these patients seem to be undertreated. The
largest number of individuals with an elevated serum cre-
atinine level had stage 1 blood pressure (140-159 mm Hg
systolic or 90-99 mm Hg diastolic). These national esti-
mates suggest that there is a great potential for decreas-
ing renal disease incidence and cardiovascular mortality
by optimizing blood pressure treatment in this high-risk
population.
