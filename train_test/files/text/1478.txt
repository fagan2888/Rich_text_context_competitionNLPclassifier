Abstract
This study built on limited knowledge about patterns and trends of adult snacking in the US. We selected adults aged 19 y
and older (n = 44,754) between 1977­1978 and 2003­2006 with results weighted and adjusted for sample design effects.
Differences testing, by a Student's t test, used STATA 10 (P # 0.01). We defined a snacking event as intake of foods over a
15-min period and excluded food defined as snacks but eaten at a meal. Dietary data were obtained from the first 2 d for
the 1977­1978 Nationwide Food Consumption Survey (NFCS 77) and the 1989­1991 Continuing Survey of Food Intake by
Individuals (CSFII 89); and 2-d dietary data from the 1994­1996 CSFII (CSFII 96) and the NHANES from 2 consecutive
surveys: NHANES 2003­2004 and NHANES 2005­2006 (NHANES 03­06). Results showed that snacking prevalence
increased significantly from 71 to 97% in 2003­2006 with increases in both the 1989­1994 and the 1994­2006 periods. In
all adults, snacking occasions increased 0.97 events over this time period (P , 0.01) and the contribution of snacks to total
energy intake increased from 18 to 24% (P , 0.01). The energy density of snacks (food plus beverages) also increased
progressively over the time period studied. Important changes in snacking food sources were found among desserts, salty
snacks, candies, and sweetened beverages. More research is needed to gain a better understanding of the implications
for overall energy intake and energy imbalance. J. Nutr. 140: 325­332, 2010.
Introduction
Obesity among U.S. adults has increased markedly over the past
few decades. Approximately 29% of 20- to 39-y olds, 37% of 40-
to 59-y olds, and 31% of those aged .60 y are obese (1). Different
dietary factors, including intake of energy beverages, away from
home eating, portion sizing, and snacking have been related to the
excess of energy intake and obesity at different life stages (2­18).
Meal and snack patterns, including the frequency of daily eat-
ing occasions, are suspected to affect health outcomes, including
cardiovascular disease and glucose intolerance (19,20). However,
the contribution of meal frequency and snacking to overeating and
body weight remains unclear. Many studies in adults of all age
groups have reported higher values of BMI related to lower eating
frequency (4,11,21,22), whereas others have found no relation
(23,24) or gender differences to BMI (25,26). Snacking, usually
defined as eating occasions different from main meals (breakfast,
lunch, dinner/supper), has been commonly regarded as contrib-
uting to excess weight (26,27). Late night eating, greater intake of
energy-dense salty snacks and energy beverages, or increased
portion sizes of snacks are among other behaviors noted (28­32).
Other studies on snacking related to BMI have shown inconsistent
results (21,33,34). These inconsistencies may be due to under-
reporting (35) of energy-dense snack and dessert-type foods
(36,37), especially among obese people. Recent research among
adults has found a higher BMI is associated with a higher total
daily energy intake and a higher energy intake at all eating oc-
casions (38). Moreover, energy intake has been found to increase
with snacking frequency in both males and females, irrespective of
physical activity. This increase is markedly higher in obese
individuals (26). According to these results, increased snacking
may be associated with a greater risk of energy imbalance and
increased overweight and obesity.
Previous studies among young adults and children reported
large increases in snacking frequency and higher contribution of
snacking to total energy intake between 1977 and 1994 (28,29).
Among U.S. adults, only 1 paper examined this topic and did not
find large increases in eating frequency or snacking from 1971 to
2002 (39). This previous study used very precise food- and meal-
based measures of snacking and adjusted as much as possible for
some measurement differences by linking foods and food com-
position tables over the full period studied. We examined sys-
tematically overall patterns of snacking, shifts in energy intake
from snacking, snacking occasions, and energy intake per snacking
event. We also examined the shifts in snacking food and beverage
sources, in addition to the overall trends of the energy density of
snacks and meals.
Participants and Methods

selected for analysis consisted of 44,754 adults aged 19 y and older who
reported 1 or 2 d of intake. The USDA data come from 17,464
respondents from the 1977­1978 Nationwide Food Consumption
Survey (NFCS)4 77; 8340 from the 1989­1991 Continuing Survey of
Food Intake by Individuals (CSFII) 89, and 9460 from the 1994­1996
CSFII (CSFII 96). From the NHANES, there were 9490 respondents
from 2 consecutive surveys: NHANES 2003­2004 and NHANES 2005­
2006 (NHANES 03­06). The USDA and NHANES surveys are based on
a multistage, stratified area probability sample of noninstitutionalized
U.S. households. Detailed information about each survey and its
sampling design has been published previously (40­44). The major
difference is that although the NHANES sampling system is nationally
representative, it does not represent each region by season and is
not randomly distributed over the days of the week as the earlier
USDA surveys were (45). By utilizing secondary USDA and NHANES
data, we were exempt from institutional review board concerns for this
paper.
Dietary data. All dietary survey data utilized a comparable food
composition table and collection methods developed by the USDA. The
NFCS 77 and CSFII 89 surveys contain information on dietary intake
that was collected over 3 consecutive days using a single interviewer-
administered 24-h recall followed by a self-administered 2-d food record.
Dietary data from NFCS 77 and CSFII 89 surveys consisted of all foods
eaten at home and away from home during the previous day (24-h recall)
and the records of the foods eaten on the day of the interview and the
following day (2-d records). The CSFII 1994­96 (CSFII 96) survey
collected interviewer-administered 24-h recalls on 2 nonconsecutive days
(3­10 d apart). The NHANES 03­06 surveys (a survey integrating USDA
dietary methodology into the NHANES system) included 2 nonconsec-
utive days of 24-h dietary recall data. The d 1 interview is conducted by
trained dietary interviewers in the Mobile Examination Center and the
d 2 interview is collected by telephone 3­10 d following the Mobile
Examination Center interview. For NHANES 03­06, the USDA's
Automated Multiple Pass Method, a 5-step computerized dietary recall
instrument, was used for collecting 24-h dietary recalls, either in person
or by telephone. For our purpose of studying snacking behavior over
time, the first 2 d of dietary intake from each survey have been included
in this analysis to provide fairly comparable measurement periods and
protocols. In the cases where either d 1 or 2 results were not obtained, the
individuals with only the other day were included.
Snack vs. meal definitions. The USDA and NHANES surveys
collected information on eating occasions, such as snacks and meals.
Each eating occasion was determined by the respondent in each survey.
Respondents were asked to name the type of each eating occasion. The
time when the eating or drinking event began was recorded for each food
or beverage. The snack category included those eating occasions defined
by the respondent as "snack," plus the occasions related to snacking,
such as food and/or coffee/beverage breaks. Meals were defined by the
respondent as breakfast/brunch, lunch, and dinner/supper. People often
consume more than 1 food item when having a snack. Therefore, we
combined all snack foods consumed within 15 min of each other as a
single snacking occasion. To determine whether participants were
snackers or not, we classified them as snackers if they snacked on any
day of intake. For those individuals who snacked on d 1 and 2, we
computed the contribution of snacking for each day and then averaged
these contributions. Also, some people defined foods eaten at the same
time as both snack and meal. We changed them all to meal if any were
defined as a snack, as in all cases most of the foods were identified as 1 of
3 meals (e.g. eating chips with a lunch). In NCFS 77, CSFII 89, and CSFII
96, we found eating occasions defined as "other" or "no answer." If a
person did not have 3 meals, the missing values were recoded as meals
according to the eating time. The remaining eating occasions were
assigned to meals if the person did not eat 3 meals. Finally, the remaining
missing eating occasions were considered as snacks. In summary, we
have set 3 principal meals, if possible, and then we have studied the
snacking behavior outside them in all the years surveyed.
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill food grouping
system. To determine those food items contributing to energy intake,
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) food
grouping system was used. This food grouping system links all foods
from 1965 to the present. Comparable food composition Latin names
and nutrient compositions are used to link the same foods in each food
group over time. All the foods reported in the USDA surveys were
assigned to the 107 UNC-CH food groups. First, we assigned the major
food groupings designated by the USDA and then further classified them
according to fat and fiber content. The UNC-CH food grouping system
has been previously described (46). For all individuals, the amount of
snacking energy provided by each UNC-CH food group was calculated
and then divided by the total energy from snacking of all individuals.
Those food groups contributing the most to snacking energy intake are
reported. Diet soft drinks and sweetened or unsweetened coffee/tea were
excluded as snacks from analysis of shifts in energy in the food group
analysis. These food items accounted for a very low percent of energy of
the total snacking daily energy.
Water as a beverage was collected differently across the surveys.
Because plain water was added as a food item in 2003, we determined
that water accounted for up to 5% of all the reported foods in 2003­
2006 compared to 0% in all the other previous surveys. Water was
deleted as a food item in all the years studied.
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as means 6 SE. Snacking trends
were studied dividing the population into 3 groups: 19­39 y old, 40­59 y
old, and 60 y and older. We used survey commands to account for survey
design, weighting, and clustering (47,48). The proportion of adults (19 y
and older) consuming 0­2 snacks/d, 3­5 snacks/d, and .6 snacks/d
within each sociodemographic characteristic and classified by BMI was
determined in NHANES 03­06. The proportion of snackers within each
age group by key sociodemographic groups was also determined in
NHANES 03­06 but varied little between all subpopulations (Supple-
mental Table 1). For each survey year, the percentage of individuals who
reported snacking on d 1, 2, or both was determined. For snackers, we
computed each survey year by age group. We used both the mean
number of snacking occasions per day, mean energy intake (kJ and kcal),
and g consumed per snacking occasion for this computation. The
contribution of snacking to total energy intake was also determined. The
energy density of snacks (food and beverages or both) and meals (food
and beverages or both) was calculated dividing the total energetic
content of each category by the total amount of g consumed from them.
Differences testing, by a Student's t test, used STATA, version 10 (47), to
weight the results and control SE for sample design effects. A P-value #
0.01 was considered significant.
Results
Proportion of adults by snacking groups. Some sociodemo-
graphic characteristics were related to a higher snacking habit
defined in terms of number of daily snacking events (Table 1).
Males, non-Hispanic Whites, and people with higher income
level and education were mainly included in the group with 3­5
snacks/d (P , 0.01). Other descriptive characteristics such as
BMI classified a higher proportion of normal and obese individ-
uals in the group of 3­5 snacks/d, although these proportions did
not differ from the group of 0­2 snacks/d.
Dynamic increases in snacking behavior. The prevalence of
snackers over a 2-d period increased over all adults ($19 y) from
71% in 1977 to 97% in 2003­2006 (percent of snackers on d 1,
2, or both) (Fig. 1). For the same period and age group, the
percentage of snacking on both d 1 and d 2 increased from 42 to
78% (data not shown).

Behavioral changes in snacking habits. Snacking occasions
increased in all adults from 1977­1978 to 2003­2006 (~1 snack
more) (P , 0.01) (Table 2). The middle-aged group (40­59 y)
accounted for the highest number of snacks per day in 2003­
2006 (2.35 6 0.03). The age group with .60 y experienced the
highest increase in the number of snacks per day, around 1.12
occasions more over the 1977­2006 time period. Regarding the
energy intake per snacking event, changes between 1977­1978
and 2003­2006 were significant and large (P , 0.01) (Table 2).
We found the largest increase in the energy intake per snacking
event in the younger group (19­39 y) between 1977­1978 and
2003­2006 (~416 kJ more). Moreover, people between 19 and
39 y had more energy per snack than the others in 2003­2006
(1105 6 20.60 kJ). The total g per snacking occasion increased
across all age groups (P , 0.01) and participants aged 19­39 y
had the highest amount of g per snacking occasion in 2003­2006
(374 6 9.78). Finally, for total energy from snacks, the amount
increased across all groups between each year (except 1994­
2006 for those aged 19­30 y) (P , 0.01).
The increase in the total percentage of energy intake from
snacking occasions in all age groups between 1977 and 2006
was significant (P , 0.01) (Fig. 2). There was also an increase
between each time period in all age groups (P , 0.01), except for
an insignificant change for young adults in the 1994­2006 time
period. The percent of daily energy from snacks increased
progressively in adults aged .19 y (~922 kJ/d more), contrib-
uting almost one-fourth of energy intake by 2006. Energy from
snacks increased between 6 and 7 percentage points for all age
groups over the 1977­2006 time period.
Snacking food and nutritional impact. Table 3 presents the
energy density of snacks and meals (foods, beverages, and both
combined) in adults. Over the time period studied, we found a
significant increasing trend for total snacking (food plus bever-
ages) in all the age groups studied. The energy density of
snacking beverages also increased in all the adults aged .19 y.
Meals food also showed a significant increasing trend in all the
adults for the studied periods.
The top 5 sources of energy were desserts, salty snacks, other
snacks, sweetened beverages, and juices/fruit (Fig. 3). The major
increase from 1997­1978 to 2003­2006 was found in low-fat
and high-fat salty snacks, with small increases also in candies,
nuts/seeds, alcoholic beverages, fruit drinks, and sport drinks.
We found decreases for overall desserts (although low-fat
desserts increased), milk/dairy, and juices/fruit.
Discussion
Over the past 2 decades, U.S. adults have steadily increased the
number of daily snacking occasions. The percentage of energy
intake from snacking occasions has increased to 24%. Interest-
ingly, our results show significant shifts in snacking between the
1977­1978 period and the mid-1990s and again in the past
decade. Not only do we find major increases in snacking
behavior, but food sources of snacks have changed. Major shifts
toward increased intake of salty snacks, chips, and nuts have
occurred along with smaller shifts toward reduced amounts of
desserts, dairy products, and fruit.
Snacking occasions and snacking foods for this study are
based on a definition that focuses on self-selected snacking
events but removes as snacks the foods that were eaten at meals.
We also utilize food groups based on foods that are linked over
time so the same foods are in the same food groups (48).
Nevertheless, we differ from other scholars. For example, one
recent study reported across the 4 NHANES surveys [I (1971­
1975), II (1976­1980), III (1988­1994), and 1999­2002)] a
decline in snacking prevalence (39). That we used only surveys
with 2 d of dietary data may have been one reason for the
different interpretation. Another may be our exclusion of snack
foods such as chips consumed at a meal. NHANES collected
only 1 d of dietary intake data before the integration in 2003
with the USDA and a combination of 1 d of direct face-to-face
recall with a subsequent telephone interview. Other earlier
research, with slightly less restrictive definitions of snacking
events, found increased snacking patterns and a higher contri-
bution to total daily energy over the 1977­1996 period (28,29).

In a previous survey (mid-1990s) of U.S. individuals aged from
18 to 54 y, ,1% reported no snacks (49). By focusing across all
adults, utilizing the same food composition table, and using 2 da
of dietary data in all time periods, we attempted to provide a
more consistent measurement over time.
Small English snacking studies based on mid-1990s data
found that adult snacking provided 17­29% of the total daily
energy with younger and middle-aged adults consuming a larger
proportion of energy from snacks (27,50). Our study, consistent
with this last approach, states that the young adults (19­39 y

old), and especially the middle-aged adults (40­59 y old),
present critical snacking trends as was shown in the last periods
(1989­1996 and 1996­2006).
This study is based on nationally representative data and
found increased portion sizes in terms of both energy per
snacking occasion and g per eating occasion. Our findings are
consistent with others that reported increased portion sizes in
U.S. surveys (13,14). Higher portion sizes might be linked to
increased energy intake (51,52). Another component of possible
sources of increased energy intake (along with number of
occasions and portion sizes) is energy density, defined as the
energy content per g of the eating event (snack or meal) that
includes beverages, foods, and both combined (53­55). This
study shows important trends toward higher energy density of
snacks (meals plus beverages) and meals food over the 1977­
2006 period.
There are limitations to our analysis of snacking trends.
Different methodologies were used in the dietary surveys,
particularly the shift into the 1990s from the 1980s. Subsequent
changes have been much smaller. To capture more accurately the
total diet, both USDA and NHANES, and later the combined
system of the 2003­2006 period, increased the number of passes
through the day with repeated queries on what has been eaten in
the 1990s. The most important subsequent change, a shift to a
second day of dietary intake data for NHANES, started after the
merger with the USDA survey system in the 2003­2006 period.
The introduction of the multiple pass method in the 1990s may
have added additional snacks in that period; however, the
methodological changes between the 1990 and most recent data
are smaller. Furthermore, the consequences of these methodo-
logical changes have not been measured with a bridging study as
was done between shifts in methods in the 1970s to the1980s
(56). Also, for NHANES in particular, different nutrient
databases have been used for each survey. For both, shifts in
the measurement and accuracy of data for foods and the changes
in the food supply could affect the composition of these nutrient
databases. We addressed these food composition table concerns
by using the system developed by this UNC team. This allowed
us to link food coded and collected in the last survey with foods
consumed by respondents in earlier surveys and ensure consis-
tently high-quality estimates of nutrient values over time (57).
There were also a different number of days of data collection in
each survey. While NFCS 77 and CSFII 89 collected 3 d of
intake, in CSFII 96 and NHANES 2003­2006 only 2 d of intake
were recorded. Using 3 d of data would create noncomparable
information. Further, the record data for d 3 provides surpris-
ingly distinct and less believable results (only 4% of participants
reported snacking on d 3) (28). Selection of comparable 2-d
periods seemed the best way to provide comparable data. Using
2 d is a closer approximation of usual intake, although it would
be better if these days were always measured randomly many
days apart.
We developed a restrictive approach to the definition of
snacking. We combined all the snacks consumed within 15 min
of each other and we recoded those foods defined as snacks, but
eaten as part of a meal, as a meal only. There have been different
considerations of snacking, based on the name occasions
reported by the participants, and/or counting each snack food
eaten at a unique time interval as 1 snacking occasion (39,58).
Others defined snacks according to the time of day or type of
foods consumed (49,50,59,60). To date, there is no consensus
about the snack foods or meal foods definitions. However, we
think self-identification of a snacking occasion provides some

consistency over time, particularly with the large variance in
time at which identified meals are consumed over time and
across our age groups.
This study shows important shifts in the number of snack-
ing occasions, foods consumed, and total contribution of
snacks to overall energy intake across 3 age groupings of U.S.
adults. The implications of these changes for overall energy
intake, energy imbalance, and metabolic functioning need to be
understood.
