The Karnofsky Performance Status Scale
An Examination of its Reliability and Validity in a Research Setting
VINCENT MOR, PHD,' LINDA LALIBERTE, MS,t JOHN N. MORRIS, PHD,S AND MO-IAEL WIEMANN, MDÂ§
The Karnofsky PerformanceStatus Scale (KPS)is widely used to quantify the functionalstatus of cancer
patients. However, limited data exist documenting its reliability and validity. The KPS is used in the
National Hospice Study (NHS) as both a study eligibility criterion and an outcome measure. As part
of intensive training, interviewers were instructed in and tested on guidelines for determining the KPS
levels of patients. After 4 months of field experience, interviewers were again tested based on narrative
patient descriptions. The interraterreliability of 47 NHS interviewerswas found to be 0.97. The construct
validity of the KPS was analyzed, and the K P S was found to be strongly related (P < 0.001) to two
other independent measures of patient functioning. Finally, the relationship of the KPS to longevity (r
= 0.30) in a population of terminal cancer patients documents its predictive validity. These findings
suggest the utility of the KPS as a valuable research tool when employed by trained observers.

the impact of disease on the patient. Loss of function is
generally related to the cumulative physical, physiologic,
and psychologicaleffectsof the disease process. In cancer

to be an important predictor of response to therapy and

The Karnofsky Performance Status Scale (KPS)is the
most widely used method of quantifying the functional
statusofcancer The KPS is an 11-pointrating
scale which ranges from normal functioning (100)to dead
(0).Alternate categorizations have been developed and

are widely The KPS, or comparable measures,
have been used for research purposes to stratify patient
subsets exposed to various treatment intervention^.'.^ It
has also been used as an outcome measure to compare
differences in the functional abilities of patients before
and after exposure to an intervention.'
Despite widespread use, little systematic data sup
porting the reliability or validity of the KPS exist. Use
of the JSPS has been criticized because of its subjective
nature, variability in scoring between observers, and the
tendency for the score to be influenced by acute but self-
limited events.'
In this article we report the results of analyses of the
reliability, construct, and predictive validity of the KPS.
The data on which these analysesare based weregathered
as a part of the National Hospice Study (NHS), a na-
tionwide evaluation of the impact of hospice care on the
quality of life and health care costs experienced by ter-
minally ill cancer patients. The KPS is routinely obtained
on all patients at study entry by raters exposedto training
proceduresdesignedto counter the lack of interrater con-
sistency associated with clinical scales."

admitted to the NHS between August 1, 1981 and July
31, 1982who had died by November 30, 1982 and who
had a KPS score of 50 or less at the initial interview.
Methods
The NHS interviewer makes initial contact with the
NHS participant 3 to 10days followingadmission to the
hospice. At this initial contact, the interviewer spends
approximately 1 hour with the patient and the patient's
family, gathering information on pain, symptoms, sat-
isfactionwith care,satisfactionwith life,and servicesbeing
utilized. During this period, the interviewer has the o p
portunity to observe the patient's subtle dependencies
and interactions within the existing support networks to
amve at a KPS assessment based on that single visit.
Additional selected functional assessment information is
gathered either independently by hospice clinical staff at
the time of the patient's admission or from the patient's
family at the initial contact. The interviewer continues
to visit the patient and the patient's family regularlyuntil
the patient's death.
Training
The NHS interviewers were selected primarily on the
basis of their prior interviewing and research experience.
Consideration was also given to their familiarity with
medical and insurance/billing terminology. There were
9 nurses among the 47 interviewers; the remaining 81%
had very limited clinical experience in a medical setting.
Prior to the training period, as a general background
the interviewerswere asked to become familiar with ter-
minology contained in a medical glossarywhich had been
prepared by NHS staff. Formal training began with an
orientation to the basic principles of cancer biology,
symptoms, epidemiology, and therapy. Led by a clinical
oncologistand an oncologic nurse, this 3-hourorientation
included practical exercises in which the interviewers
demonstrated their ability to abstract selected items of
information from the medical records of terminal cancer
patients.
Following this orientation, the interviewers took part
in a 2-hour trainingsessionconductedby the sameclinical
team. The KPS index used by the NHS interviewers is
shown in Table I. Operational specifications were de-
veloped to provide objective guidelines for nonclinical
staff in the use of this judgement rating scale. The goal
of the training was to enable interviewers to rate and
compare patient profiles at subtly different performance
levels,generalizingthis experienceto include all types of
patients.
Followingtheir introduction to the overall rating pro-
cess,interviewerswere tested with aseriesof brief narrative
descriptions of patients and their respective KPS scores
until there was thorough agreement on the basis for each
particular rating.

As noted above, although the Kps is widely used by
clinicians,recent evidencesuggeststhat ratings frequently
are not comparable." In research applications, however,
raters using the KPS have been found to achieve at least
a moderate level of interrater agreement.I I Reliability re-

assessors. To test whether consensus among interviewers
was achieved,a written quiz similar to that given during
the trainingprocess was administeredto interviewersafter
4 months of field work. Forty-seven interviewers were
asked to rate 17 narrative examples of patients at widely
varyingKPS levels.The results of this quiz were analyzed
to determine interrater reliability. Interviewers' ratings
werecompared usingCronbach'scoefficientalpha, which
treatsjudges asitemsin a scaleand the narrative scenarios
as observations. This approach was supplemented by a
variant of the intraclasscorrelationsuggestedby Winer.
'*
Both approaches yielded interrater reliability coefficients
of over 0.97 of a maximum of 1.00. This value is statis-
tically significant beyond the 0.001 probability level.
Construct Validity
The KPS is a complex, syntheticmeasure of a patient's
activity levels. It isa multidimensionalconstruct reduced
to a unidimensional scale. One of the reasons for the
popularity of the KPS is precisely its concise approach
to classifyingand ranking patients whose individualclin-
ical status is far more complicated. By comparing the
KPS with other discrete observable variables which con-
ceptually or theoretically tap the same measurement do-
main, its construct validity can be e~a1uated.l~
In the NHS, a series of independent physical func-
tioning measures is available with which to test the con-
struct validity of the Karnofsky Performance Index. At
the time of intake, hospice staff complete a series of de-
tailed functional assessments on the subjects based on
the general model of the Katz ADL Index.14The patient's
primary care person completes an overall physical QL
(quality of life) assessment at the initial and each sub-
sequent interview contact. While the three sets of as-
sessments are not identical in content or intent, they do
measure facetsof the same underlyingphenomenon, pa-
tient performance.Consequently,there shouldbe a strong
relationship between these other two sets of functional
measures and the KPS. The descriptors of the various
KPS levels suggest not only a physical performance di-
mension but also medical care needs. Symptompresence
and extent of disease,therefore, should conceptually cor-
relate with the KPS. Data regarding the presence and
severity of symptoms, including pain, are obtained from
the patient during the initial interview. The patient's
medical record was used to record the locationand num-
ber of metastases.
The performance level for activities of daily living for
patients at different KPS scoresis shown in Table 2. The
chi-square tests for all categoriesindicatethat differences
in performance level for each KPS score are significant
(Pc 0.001), with the proportion o
fpatients able to func-
tion independentlyincreasingas the patients'KPS scores
increase. As the KPS scores decrease, the proportion of
patientsunable to perform these activitieswith or without
assistance increasesdrastically, indicating a severely dis-
abled population at a KPS of <30.
A severity index was constructed from the functional
variables listed in Table 2. For each variable, a score of
0 was assigned if the patient could perform the activity
independently,a scoreof 1 was assigned if assistancewas
necessary, and a 2 was assigned if the patient was unable
to perform the activity. The scores range from 0 (most
functional)to 14 (least functional) and have been distri-
butionallycategorized.Table 3 presents the severityindex
forpatientsat eachKPSlevel.Thechi-squaretestindicates
significantdifferences among categories(P-=0.001) and
a very strongrelationshipbetween increasingKPS scores
and higher functional status (contingency coefficient
= 0.49). Over 50% of the cases in the two worst KPS
levelsare in the worst severitycategory,while 40% of the
patients with a KPS of 50 are in the "most functional"
severity category.
The relationship between the KPS and the physical
QL is given in Table 4. There are significantdifferences
No. 9 THEKARNOFSKY

(P< 0.001)between the KPS levels in the proportion of
persons with low physical QL values-the lower the KPS
values, the higher the proportion of persons with poor
physical QL. The relationships between these two mea-
sures are very strong, as can be seen by the Kendall'stau
statistic(0.35).Thus, both the interviewerand the patient's
primary care person (usually the spouse or a child) tend
to rate the patients similarly with respect to the physical
dimensions of performance status.
In addition to these functional variables, the degree of
pain reported by patients at various Kps scoreswas mea-
sured using a modified version of Melzack's pain ques-
ti~nnaire.'~
No significant relationship to the patient's
KPS rating was found. Similarly,there was no significant
relationship between the KPS score and other physical
symptoms reported by the patients. Although not sig-
nificant, shortnessof breath showeda strongerrelationship
to performance status than either nausea, dry mouth,
constipation, dizziness, or fever. Patients' experience of
pain and symptoms should logically limit their ability
and willingness to perform normal daily activities. How-
ever, for the extremely debilitated terminal patients rep
resented in this sample, symptoms are not a relevant
factor in reduced performance status. The absence of
patients in the upper ranges of the KPS may detract from
what would othenvise be a positive association between
reported symptoms and KPS in a population of patients
with metastatic disease. Additionally, over 30% of the
500 patients in the sample able to respond to the pain
question reported experiencingno pain at all. While most
patients reported at least one of the six symptoms, the
number of reported symptoms was also not related to
KPS. Clearly, for this sample of patients, reduced KPS
is not attributable to the experienceof the more common
symptoms associated with cancer patients. The low KPS
is apparently associated with a systemic disease which
has reduced the patient's vitality.
Primary cancer site as well asthe location and number
of metastaticsiteswas ascertained from patients'medical
records. None of these factorswas significantlyrelated to
the KPS score. Lung and brain metastatic involvement,
which logically should have the greatest debilitatingeffect
on functioning, were only moderately associated with a
lower KPS. This pattern of findings suggeststhat disease
characteristicscan vary substantiallyamong personswith
the same KPS. At earlier stages in the advance of met-
astatic disease, the location of the metastases and the
number of metastatic sites might be associated with the
rate of decline in KPS.

psychological causes(notwithstandingother complicating
factors),the more impaired the cancer patient, the more
advanced the systemic involvement and consequently,
the closer the patient is to death. Thus the KPS, as a
measure of the degree of impairment, should be able to
predict the length of survival of terminal cancer patients.
An analysis of variance (ANOVA) with KPS as the
independent variable and survival in days as the depen-
dent variable was performed. The results presented in
Table 5 show a direct monotonic relationship between
KPSand survivalwhich issignificantat beyond the 0.00I
probabilitylevel. Nine percent of the variance in survival
is accounted for by the KPS as seen by the "eta squared"
which is comparable to the standard R2emerging from
regression analyses. However, as can be seen from the
standard deviation in longevityassociatedwith each Kps
level, there is considerable overlap in the longevity dis-
tributionsof the variousKPSlevels.The median longevity
associatedwith each KPS level (uniformly lowerthan the
average) suggests very skewed distributions.

To complement the ANOVA results, the ordinal KPS
score was regressed on survival in days. The purpose of
thisanalysiswas to furtherexaminethe predictivequalities
of the KPS. Confirming the ANOVA approach, a zero
order correlation of 0.30 was obtained, signifyingan R2
of 0.09 which is significant at beyond the 0.001 level.
Each increase in one KPS level, e.g., 20 to 30, yields an
increaseof approximately 15daysof survival.Regression
analysesalso revealthat a higher proportion of prediction
errors (standardized residuals greater than
+ or -2.0)
occur among patients with KPS levels of 40 and above;
over 6%of caseswith KPSscoresof 40 or 50were "errors,"
whereas only 4% of KPS level 30 and 2% of KPS level
20 were errors. Furthermore, significant errors of pre-
diction were uniformly in the direction of longer lives.
This is largely a function of the skewed longevity distri-
bution for this sample seen in the median being lower
than the mean.
In view of these findings,a categoric form of longevity
was constructed. The proportion of "short-lived" and
"long-lived" patients at each KPS level was examined.
Three longevitygroups were created: (1) 18days or less;
(2) 29 to 36 days;and (3) more than 36 days. The results
are presented in Table 6. As can be seen, the majority
of patients with KPS scores of 10 or 20 die within 18
days of hospice admission, while most (70.4%) of those

with KPS scoresof 50 live longer than 36 days. Kendall's
tau associated with this table is 0.30, which is significant
beyond the 0.001 level. Interestingly, the proportion of
patients at each KPS level found in the mid-range lon-
gevity group is fairly comparable.
These analyses substantiate the predictive validity of
the KPS when applied to a sample of terminal cancer
patients. While the relationship is highly significant, its
predictive accuracy and therefore case-specific clinical
applicability is limited. Clearly, however, the lower KPS
levels are much more likely to be "death-imminent."
Discussion
The wide use of the KPS among physicians and par-
ticularly oncologists suggests it is a meaningful measure
of a patient's functional status. However, for this or any
similarmeasureto be meaningful,it isessentialthat those
using it be systematically trained to assure a common
perspective.The training module designedforthe current
evaluation could be readily adapted by other researchers
and by cliniciansworking in a practiceor researchsetting.
Our finding of high levels of interrater reliability among
noncliniciansfollowingexposureto training attests to the
feasibility of using the KPS in systematicresearch efforts.
The functional variables adapted from Katz ADL In-
dex14and used to test the construct validity of the KPS
are objective and quantifiable. Thus, the strong relation-
ship between these variables and the KPS as shown in
Table 2 suggests that although the KPS is a subjective
rating, it is based on objective factors. The strong rela-
tionship obtained between the KPS and a single item
physical QL judgement made by patients' primary care
personsindicatesthe consistencywith which the construct
of performance status can be measured. This construct
validity, therefore, supports the view that the KPS is a
reliable measure of functional status.
Perhaps most important is the findingthat the KPS is
a predictor of length of survival in terminally ill cancer
patients. The predictive relationship that emerged, while
accounting for only 9% of the variation in longevity, is
consistent with other researchers' efforts to predict lon-
gevity in chronically ill and aged population^.^^-^' The
more limited relationship to survival reported by Yates
and associates" was presumably due to greater hetero-
geneity in his sample. By limiting the sample to patients
with confirmed metastaticdiseasewith an acknowledgedly
poor outcome, the relationshipbetween performance sta-
tus and longevity becomes apparent. However, even in
this population, the predictive accuracy attained is in-
sufficientto guide clinical practice and decision-making.

outcome of interest or is related to other outcomes of
interest. In view of the strong relationship between KPS
and survival, even randomized clinical trials could gain
considerable power by using the KPS asa study eligibility
criterion and as a stratifying variable during analyses. On
the basis of the high short-term mortality among patients
in the lowest KPS groups, it might be reasonable to ex-
clude them from studies requiring some minimal exposure
time. The widespread use,ease ofmeasurement, and gen-
eral acceptance of the measure make the KPSa reasonable
candidate as a stratifying variable as long as the reliability
of the raters is assured.
Future investigations into the predictors of survival
time among terminal cancer patients will explore other
factors, i.e.,concurrent disabling diseases, prior treatment
patterns, etc., that, together with the KPS,can refine such
predictions.
