Gaus has recently offered a novel argument for an open
society, connecting it to recent methodological debates
regarding ideal and non-ideal theory (Gaus, 2016). The
argument, briefly put, is that political philosophies based
upon the search for an ideal state of affairs to anchor their
critical and prescriptive ambitions, so-called "ideal theo-
ries," are bound to fail:
under the conditions of human existence, we cannot know
what such an ideal would be...only those in a morally
heterogeneous society have a reasonable hope of actually
understanding what an ideal society would be like, but in such
a society we will never be collectively devoted to any single
ideal. (Gaus, 2016: xix)
Thus, the argument is composed of two smaller claims. The
first, the "Ideal theory claim," is that ideal theory cannot
conceptually live up to its billing: the best possible case for
doing ideal theory should lead us to recognize that such
endeavors are conceptually incoherent or lead to morally
perverse outcomes. The second claim, the "Open Society
claim," is that the best way to approximate a knowledge of
the optimal institutional state of affairs is to organize insti-
tutions around the goal of maximizing perspectival diver-
sity, not according to an ideal blueprint. Put together, Gaus
claims that ideal theory leads to irresolvable dilemmas, and
that the best way to make good on what ideal theory strives
for is to not strive for ideal theory at all.
The problem for Gaus, I argue, is that the "ideal theory
claim" is so well established that it undermines his "Open
Society claim." Precisely because ideal theory has the
problems that Gaus skillfully illuminates, we should be
skeptical about the picture he paints of the Open Society. I
begin this short commentary by rehearsing Gaus's argu-
ments about ideal theory and the Open Society, and then
show that the Open Society suffers the same pathologies as
ideal theory, which I illustrate through a discussion of the
current debate surrounding free speech.
Ideal Theory and "The Choice"

Abstract
Gaus has recently offered a novel argument for an open society, connecting it to recent methodological debates regarding
ideal and non-ideal theory. The argument, briefly put, is that political philosophies based upon the search for an ideal
to anchor their critical and prescriptive ambitions, so-called "ideal theories," are bound to fail. The best possible case
for doing ideal theory should lead us to recognize that such endeavors are conceptually incoherent or lead to morally
perverse outcomes. Consequently, the best way to approximate a knowledge of the optimal institutional state of affairs
is to organize institutions around the goal of maximizing perspectival diversity, what Gaus calls the "Open Society,"
not according to an ideal blueprint. I argue that precisely because ideal theory has the problems that Gaus skillfully
illuminates, we should be skeptical about the picture he paints of the Open Society.

realization condition," which says that an ideal theory must
establish a set of evaluative criteria that can be used to
"evaluate the justice of various social worlds, which realize
to different extents, and in different ways, the relevant prin-
ciples or standards of justice"; and the "orientation condi-
tion," which says that these evaluative criteria cannot only
refer to the inherent justice of a social world, but also to a
social world's proximity to the ideal. Ideal theory is both
practical1 and necessary when it can tell us how just a state
of the world is, and whether moving toward some particular
state of the world will move us in the direction of the opti-
mal state of the world.
The "orientation condition" is where the action is in
Gaus's argument. What distinguishes an ideal theory from
a more pragmatic, problem-solving approach, or Sen's
"climbing model," is that an ideal theory is oriented toward
something beyond the moral problems of the day, or mere
normative evaluation. Making the claim "state of affairs X
is intolerably inegalitarian or illiberal or inefficient" does
not require imagining an ideal state of affairs U where
equality, liberalism, or efficiency is perfectly achieved.
Whereas Sen or a pragmatist will advocate "climbing" the
mountain we find ourselves upon with the evaluative crite-
ria at hand, ideal theory, if it's adding anything other than a
rhetorical flourish to a set of evaluative criteria, must also
be in the business of orienting us toward the ideal
mountaintop.
The reason why this matters is because the evaluative
criteria and the ideal orientation can pull in opposite direc-
tions. Because institutions are complex and interdependent,
particularly when it comes to their relationship to justice,
"the justice of an institution, practice, or policy can be
dependent on what other institutions or policies are in
effect" (Gaus, 2016: 63). A committed social democrat, for
example, may very well think that, all things being equal, a
more just society would be one where universities have no
tuition, since that would make higher education accessible
to people of all socio-economic backgrounds. However,
this conclusion will likely be conditional on other institu-
tions and policies obtaining: relative equality in secondary
education, equal access to information about universities,
and publicly provided SAT prep programs. Absent these
pre-conditions, pursuing a tuition-free university could be
counterproductive from a social democratic perspective, as
it would essentially be subsidizing richer students' access
to university. While we may move closer to the more just
institutional arrangement by implementing tuition-freeness,
our society is made less just because we have not secured
the background conditions necessary to make that institu-
tional innovation justice-promoting.
As Gaus puts it, institutional complexity and interde-
pendency create a "rugged optimization landscape,"
where institutional similarity is not well-correlated with
justice. The landscape is rugged because the route to the
"peak" optimal institutional arrangement will involve
innovations resulting in "valleys" of less just states of
affairs. Creating the institutions necessary to secure opti-
mal justice, in other words, will involve "worse-before-it-
gets-better" movements en route to the optimum. We
cannot assume that getting closer, in terms of institutional
design, to the ideal will be justice-promoting, and we can-
not assume that justice-promoting improvements move us
closer to the ideal institutional configuration.
Consequently, a theory that makes use of an ideal model
will produce evaluative criteria and an orientation that
pull in different directions: there is no reason to assume
that making things more just here and now will orient us
toward the ideal.
The ideal theorist's response to this is simple enough:
sacrificing small improvements in justice is worth the end-
result of reaching optimal justice.After all, it's an optimum!
This response, however, assumes a heroic amount of
knowledge and confidence in our assessments: it ignores
the fact that we know much more about social worlds that
are like our own, that are in our "neighborhood" (Gaus,
2016: 76), than hypothetical "yet-to-be realized" worlds
(Gaus, 2016: 78). When presented with a choice between
an institution that would incrementally improve the justice
of our society, and one that would lead us toward the ideal,
we have good reason to be more confident in our assess-
ments of the former than the latter. The complexity, interde-
pendency,andnoveltyoftheidealinstitutionalconfiguration
conspire to rob us of our confidence in it.
Because of this, ideal theorists invariably face "The
Choice":
incaseswherethereisaclearoptimumwithinourneighborhood
that requires movement away from our understanding of the
ideal, we often must choose between relatively certain (perhaps
large) local improvements in justice and pursuit of a
considerably less certain ideal, which would yield optimal
justice. (Gaus, 2016: 82)
This is the crux of the ideal theory claim: ideal theorists
must be committed to an orientation condition of their the-
ory; however, because of institutional interdependency and
our better knowledge of more proximate social worlds,
local justice and optimal justice will often pull in opposite
directions, with our confidence in achieving the former
being much greater than the latter. The Choice, which
results, is the unpalatable consequence of being committed
to articulating ideals and using them as guides in our nor-
mative analyses.
The Open Society
Given the problems that ideal theory faces, Gaus offers an
argument for an Open Society. The Choice arises because
of our inability to be confident in the ideal, our lack of
knowledge of its shape and functioning, relative to our
Singer 3
understanding of more local improvements. So, a way of
alleviating the problem is by increasing our knowledge of
what we want to achieve in society and our confidence in
its achievability and workability. Gaus contends that our
ability to make accurate predictions is increased by (1) the
existence of perspectival diversity and (2) the ability for
these diverse perspectives to communicate with one
another. Gaus's Open Society is meant to achieve both.
First, the Open Society requires the existence of secure, sta-
ble, and recognized institutions: by establishing institu-
tions, an open society creates common ontological
categories for citizens and "common sources of interpreting
those categories" (Gaus, 2016: 178), which can serve as the
basis for, and conduits of, communication amongst them.
Second, and most important, is that in an open society,
the design of these institutions is not based on a pre-decided
ideal of what we want out of social cooperation. Instead,
institutions ought to be designed with the aim of accom-
modating extant diverse perspectives and allowing the
introduction and development of new diverse perspectives
(Gaus, 2016: 174­176), since such diversity is our best
asset for answering the question of which ends we want our
social institutions to be oriented towards. Put differently,
perspectival diversity can contribute to discovering the
knowledge of the ends that ideal theory tries to find; how-
ever, achieving that diversity requires giving up attempts to
organize our institutions around such knowledge.
So, which institutions are required for an "open soci-
ety"? Gaus offers three basic categories, and implies a
fourth. First, law and morality ought to be organized around
moral prohibitions, not permissions (Gaus, 2016: 195­
198). Because an open society seeks to achieve maximal
perspectival diversity, permissiveness should be the default;
in the Open Society, the basic idea is "Do it unless we say
not to" and not "Don't do it unless we say you can." Going
the other way, thinking that an action is permitted only
when a moral rule permits it, will unduly limit the sorts of
lifestyles, perspectives, and ideological viewpoints that
populate the Open Society.
Second, the Open Society requires that there be "juris-
dictional rights," in order to mitigate the complexity that a
maximally diverse society will necessarily engender.
Because a public order based on the actually-existing per-
spectives of its members will be constantly in flux, as views
and perspectives come and go, we must provide individuals
with the ability to establish "jurisdictions" within which
they have control over what happens. Private property
rights, for Gaus, are the quintessential jurisdictional rights,
allowing people to make "small social worlds" for them-
selves without negotiating with, or concerning ourselves
with, others' perspectives (Gaus, 2016: 201). More gener-
ally, the basic rights familiar to liberal society (association,
religion, privacy) are jurisdictional rights, in that they
establish protected individual and associational realms in
which one's perspective can hold court.
The third institution follows from the emphasis placed
on private property: markets, the institution par excellence
of facilitating cooperation without thick agreement (Gaus,
2016: 202). Markets can do this because they focus our req-
uisite agreement on relatively less controversial things (like
what is being traded and the terms on which it is being
traded) without requiring agreement on the metaphysical
nature or moral worth of things. A society wishing to avoid
imposing values upon others, like the diversity-oriented
Open Society, must be a market society of some sort.
Fourth, though stated less explicitly, the Open Society
requires some brand of democratic politics. The basic idea
of the Open Society--that we ought not, and cannot, know
or decide upon what we ought to strive for a priori, and
therefore must allow for a diverse and pluralistic society to
figure such things out themselves--presumes some mecha-
nisms for translating these diverse perspectives into public
policy, and procedures to enact and pursue some measures
and not others. Gaus suggests that this is the domain of
democracy (2016: 202). While Gaus is clear that specifying
one of the many democratic choice procedures in the
abstract is impossible (2016: 225), a democratic procedure
of some sort is still necessary to produce a social choice.
This is the Open Society claim. Perspectival diversity is
the best bet for achieving the knowledge presupposed by
ideal theory, yet achieving this diversity requires us giving
up designing institutions according to some ideal. Instead,
we should seek to create the institutions of an open society,
designed to maximize diverse perspectives, and facilitate
communication between them: permissive moral-legal
codes; jurisdictional rights; markets; and democratic proce-
dures and institutions.
The Open Society as an Ideal
The question that suggests itself is this: If "the ideal theory
claim" is accurate, is Gaus entitled to offer the "Open
Society claim"? Gaus wants to say that because its content
is not pre-ordained, that its institutions are designed to
make that content an ongoing debate, the Open Society
does not fall victim to the pathologies of ideal theory. In
ideal theory, the moral principles set the stage for deriving
institutions; in the Open Society, the institutions set the
stage for deriving moral principles. And yet, according to
Gaus, a commitment to openness and perspectival diversity
does direct us toward certain institutional configurations.
We can say that the Open Society displays the pathologies
of ideal theory if its institutional configuration entails insti-
tutional interdependency such that getting one aspect of the
Open Society correct without others could be less desirable
than an otherwise sub-optimal alternative. Or, put differ-
ently, it has the trappings of ideal theory if it gives rise to
The Choice. Even with a commitment as minimal as the
Open Society, I argue, we still find ourselves facing The
Choice; pursuing the Open Society entails foregoing local
4 Research and Politics 
improvements to justice, requiring something like an article
of faith when weighing it against other alternatives.
Gaus's insistence upon markets as an institutional core of
the Open Society is important to note here, since markets are
complex, requiring several interdependent institutions. As
Rodrik (2008: 156) notes, markets require various compo-
nents: property rights, regulatory institutions, stabilizing insti-
tutions, institutions for providing social insurance, and
institutions for conflict management. This is true of the institu-
tions necessary for the Open Society more generally: the pro-
tection of liberal "jurisdictional" rights requires a variety of
effective governance structures, legal codes with roughly-
accepted interpretations, and so forth. All of which is to say:
the institutions of the Open Society, as minimal as they are, are
not inherently a "package deal." One can have property rights
without the institutions necessary to secure that exchanges are
happening voluntarily or fairly; the ability to exchange prop-
erty rights can be secured without establishing competitive
markets; we can have corporations without the bureaucratic
and legal bodies necessary to effect legitimate corporate gov-
ernance regimes, etc. Furthermore, one can have these things
without having other aspects of a liberal society that an open
society seems to require: a society can have competitive and
smoothly running markets with secure private property rights,
but also not have established institutions protecting free speech
or association (see Chang, 2002: 71­110).
This becomes even more complicated when we consider
the democratic institutions presumed by the Open Society.
Again, Gaus is agnostic on the precise nature of these dem-
ocratic politics. Still, we note that even a minimal concep-
tion of democracy has several institutional prerequisites:
regular and free elections; universal suffrage; protection of
civil liberties; and so forth. Each of these can be had with-
out the others, resulting in authoritarianism, not democracy
(Levitsky and Way, 2010). Democratic procedures--like
the permissive codes, the jurisdictional rights, and the mar-
ket economy, which are part and parcel of the Open
Society--exhibit high levels of institutional complexity
and interdependency: there is no reason to think that mov-
ing toward this institutional configuration in part, but not in
total, is an inherently positive thing.
Faced with moving toward this Open Society or invest-
ing time and resources into, say, industrialization or growth,
one faces precisely "The Choice" that Gaus warns of ideal
theory. We must choose to pursue this Open Society despite
the institutional interdependence that will render the pursuit
a "rugged optimization landscape." This means potentially
forgoing surer local improvements to achieve a grander
picture of society, the preferability of which is based on
what looks an awful lot like an ideal theory, Gaus's protes-
tations to the contrary notwithstanding.
The fact of this complexity and interdependence makes
sense of the actual historical development of such institu-
tional configurations. As we know, private property, com-
petitive markets, liberal rights and institutions, and
democratic government were not established ex nihilio, but
against a background of local norms, customs, and specific
practices of exchange and ownership. Thus, even if we
approve of the liberal societies that came later, the fact is
that they required a large amount of "worse-before-it-gets-
better" moves to develop. Private property required break-
ing up and disrupting established patterns and relationships
of land-tenure and production (Moore, 1993; Scott, 1998),
causing hardship and pain for those accustomed to such
practices, only to get an initially fledgling, unequal, and
imperfect system of property rights in return. Establishing
competitive markets has required the displacement and dis-
ciplining of large swaths of population in order transform
them from peasant workers to wage laborers (Polanyi,
1944). This, again, was not simply a matter of moving incre-
mentally toward the market, but rather disrupting extant
relationships and imposing costs upon people with the
promise of a better institutional configuration in the future.
Similarly, the rights and procedures associated with lib-
eral democracy have often not been developed spontane-
ously and without harm, but through violent and colonial
means. Armed with ideas about the preferability and right-
eousness of liberal democratic institutions and norms, colo-
nialists have been all too willing to subject peoples to
hardships in the pursuit of an ideal--even when the ideal is
liberal openness and inclusivity (e.g. Mehta, 1999). Now, no
doubt Gaus is aware of this history, and is certainly no pro-
ponent of such actions. One may think we ought to pursue
the Open Society, and still be critical of how we have his-
torically gone about pursuing it. Still, this history should
give us pause as it illustrates the more general point: the
Open Society is not something that can be created spontane-
ously and all at once. Instead, choices must be made to enact
it, choices which will involve breaking up past ways of
doing things and foregoing other potential alternatives. This
makes the force and violence underlying transformations to
liberalism look less like an unfortunate historical hypocrisy,
and more like the consequences of pursuing a set of institu-
tions far from the neighborhood in which one finds oneself.
In this light, maximizing perspectival diversity, and
the institutions necessary to achieve it, looks more like an
ideal that, if we heed its call, will orient policy and insti-
tutional design away from local improvements in justice.
A society that finds itself in a traditional sort of gift econ-
omy, or organized around norms that privilege group-
oriented modes of consensus or elder rule, may eventually
be improved if it were to develop markets, "jurisdic-
tional" rights, permissive legal/moral orders, and demo-
cratic procedures. However, moving closer to this
institutional configuration does not mean we are approxi-
mating or moving closer to the freedom and perspectival
diversity such a configuration promises: instilling prop-
erty rights without competition or exchange will likely
create more power imbalances than it will mitigate; creat-
ing "markets" without recognized and legitimate legal
Singer 5
regimes to enforce property rights can give moral cover
to coercive market "exchanges"; establishing electoral
procedures without universal suffrage or fair competition
is not obviously an improvement upon the local and tra-
ditional means of decision-making; and so forth. Put dif-
ferently, the decision to create such institutions will look
much like "The Choice" that generically plagues ideal
theory, because such institutions are complex, interde-
pendent, and imperfectly correlated with the outcome
they strive to achieve.
In attempting to deal with the problems raised by ideal
theory, Gaus inadvertently demonstrates their ubiquity.
The Case of Free Speech
To put all this another way: a principled commitment to open-
ness is in inherent tension with the conservatism (cf. Estlund.
2017) inherent to Gaus's principled resistance to ideal theory.
By way of illustration, consider the current debate surround-
ing the protection of hate speech. Park's (2017) New York
Times op-ed is exemplary of a growing attraction to the idea
that speech ought to be restricted because of its ability to
injure or harm. Park argues that theACLU's current policy of
protecting all free speech claims regardless of its content--
for example, protecting the speech rights of the KKK or neo-
Nazis--is misguided because it ignores the current context in
which such speech takes place: "the question [the ACLU]
should ask itself is this: could prioritizing first amendment
rights make the distribution of power in this country even
more unequal and further silence the communities most bur-
dened by histories of censorship?"
I discuss this stance here not to endorse it, but to point
out that there is a Gausian logic to Park's rather un-Gausian
argument. Here, the ACLU looks like an organization
enraptured by the ideal of free speech; pursuing this ideal
leads the ACLU away from a more local optimum, where
extant injustices are taken into account and inform our pro-
tection of public speech. Allowing the KKK or neo-Nazis
to march results from The Choice to pursue the open ideal
instead of a more local improvement where hatemongers
are not empowered to spread their vitriol.
Undoubtedly Gaus would demur. Perhaps there are good
reasons to restrict speech in some circumstances; however,
we would only have epistemic confidence in the justice of
such an intervention given the initial achievement of a per-
spectivally diverse Open Society. To know whether the
ACLU ought to be restricted, something like the current
ACLU position would have to prevail. But Park has a handy
response: why should we have confidence that such a state
of affairs is achievable and desirable now? As Wiens (2018:
25) puts it: "Gaus has yet to explore the causal mechanisms
by which we could bring about the Open Society given the
mechanisms that are operative at the status quo."2 Not
allowing Nazis to speak seems to allow us to reach a more
local optimum, where minorities and the oppressed don't
have to suffer the indignities of hate speech (Waldron,
2014). It's not obvious why we should forego that optimum
to pursue the less proximate, and therefore less sure, condi-
tion of perspectival diversity.
The dilemma turns on what "neighborhood" we think
we're in. If we are in the neighborhood of the Open Society
then it would make sense to follow the current ACLU pol-
icy. If, however, we are far off from such a neighborhood,
we would have no reason to follow such a policy, and it
would appear prudent to heed Park's advice. Now, maybe
we have some reason to believe that we currently are or
aren't in the neighborhood of the Open Society. But for
Gaus's claim to work--for the Open Society to be a "non-
ideal" and thereby escape The Choice--we'd need to think
that it is always optimizing to pursue openness, that pursu-
ing it would never require foregoing a surer improvement
to justice. Otherwise the Open Society looks more like any
other hypothetical institutional configuration, the wisdom
of pursuing which will be a function of our proximity to it.
Conclusion
While my discussion in this short memo has been focused
specifically on Gaus's arguments against ideal theory and for
the Open Society, by discussing the problem of hate speech,
my hope is to suggest a more general point. I have sought to
challenge the idea that by minimizing the standards of one's
normative theory, one is divesting oneself of the pathologies
of ideal theory. A commitment to openness as a normative
ideal is still a normative ideal. If one wishes to articulate an
integrated normative political theory (see Simmons, 2010:
21­24) with any sort of institutional detail, then, given exist-
ing norms and practices, pursuing a "nonideal" like the Open
Society will involve many of the same dilemmas that pursu-
ing the ideal society raises. In light of this, perhaps ideals are
necessary not because we can always act on their behalf, but
precisely because we will unavoidably face difficult practical
choices that force us to stray from them. If The Choice is
ubiquitous, then perhaps we need an ideal not for purposes of
orientation, but, as Carens (2013: 126) has put it, so that we
can keep in mind "the difference between what we should
embrace and what we should only endure."

1. Note that this is an important qualification. Cohen (2003:

philosophy is not what we should do but what we should
think, even when what we should think makes no practical
difference."
2. Wiens comes to a similar conclusion as I do here--that Gaus's
Open Society looks more like an ideal theory than Gaus seems
to realize. However, whereas Wiens emphasizes the black box
of Gaus's "justice score," I emphasize The Choice.
