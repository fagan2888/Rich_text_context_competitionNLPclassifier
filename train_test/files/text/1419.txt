American and US Caucasian populations: analysis of data from the
third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

In previous analyses of transferrin satura-
tion data in African Americans and Cauca-
sians from the second National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES II), subpopulations were found
consistent with population genetics for
common loci that influence iron metabo-
lism. The goal of this new study was to
determine if these transferrin saturation
subpopulations have different levels of
iron stores. Statistical mixture modeling
was applied to transferrin saturation data
for African Americans and Caucasians
from the third National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (NHANES III),
and then the mean serum ferritin concen-
trations were determined for the trans-
ferrin saturation subpopulations that were
identified. After adjustment for diurnal
variation, 3 subpopulations of transferrin
saturation were identified in each racial
group. Satisfying Hardy-Weinberg condi-
tions for major locus effects, in both
racial groups the sum of the square roots
of the proportion with the lowest mean
transferrin saturation and the proportion
with the highest mean transferrin satura-
tion was approximately 1. When weighted
to reflect the US adult population as a
whole, these subpopulations of increas-
ing transferrin saturations had progres-
sively increasing mean age-adjusted se-
rum ferritin concentration values in each
ethnic grouping as stratified by sex (trend
test, P < .002 for all). These results are
consistent with the concept that popula-
tion transferrin saturation subpopula-
tions reflect different levels of storage
iron. (Blood. 2001;98:2345-2351)

Introduction
We previously used mixture modeling of transferrin saturations
measured in the second National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES II) to study possible genetic influences on iron
metabolism in the African American population1 and the Caucasian
population2 of the United States. In the study of NHANES II
Caucasian data, we analyzed the distribution of transferrin satura-
tion after removing values for individuals possibly homozygous for
the gene responsible for hemochromatosis and found evidence for
2 subpopulations, one postulated to be predominantly unaffected
by the gene for hemochromatosis and the other predominantly
heterozygous for hemochromatosis.2 More recently, we examined
NHANES II data from African Americans from which markedly
elevated transferrin saturation values were not removed, and
mixture modeling provided evidence for 3 subpopulations of
transferrin saturation.Although the type of hemochromatosis found
in Caucasians may be rare in African Americans, our findings for
African Americans were consistent with population genetics for a
common locus that influences iron metabolism.1
Transferrin saturation can be reduced with inflammation as well
as iron deficiency3 and the same measurement can be elevated by
increased iron stores and a variety of other conditions.4 Therefore,
it is not completely clear that, on a population basis, elevated
transferrin saturation reflects increased iron stores. In fact, in a
recent analysis of data from the third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III), only 11% to 22% of adults
with elevated serum transferrin saturation as defined by various
cutoff values had a concurrently elevated serum ferritin level.5 In
the present study, we analyzed data from the NHANES III to
determine if subpopulations based on transferrin saturation have
different levels of storage iron as assessed by measurements of
serum ferritin concentration.
Materials and methods
Sources of data
The primary source of data for this study was NHANES III, which surveyed
a representative sample of the noninstitutionalized US population in
1988­1994. There were 31 311 persons examined from 89 primary
sampling units (county or small group of contiguous counties). The lower
age limit was set at 2 months with no upper limit in age. Based on an
interviewer's observation, each person was classified by race as non-
Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, Mexican American, or other.6 For the
purposes of this study, we did not analyze data from Mexican Americans
because of the lack of estimates of the admixture of Caucasian genes in this
population. Although NHANES III provides the categories of non-Hispanic

black and non-Hispanic white, in this paper we refer to these categories as
African American and Caucasian, respectively.
Serum iron concentration and total iron-binding capacity were mea-
sured colorimetrically by using an Alpkem RFA analyzer (Alpkem,
Clackamas, OR); a 1% thiourea solution was added to complex Cu to
prevent copper interference. Serum transferrin saturation was calculated by
dividing the serum iron level by total iron-binding capacity and multiplying
by 100. Information regarding methodologic variation over the assays was
provided by Gunter and colleagues.7 The coefficients of variation for
analyses of control pools averaged 3.1% and 3.3% for serum iron and total
iron-binding capacity, respectively. Serum ferritin concentration was mea-
sured by using the Quantimmune IRMA kit (Biorad Laboratories, Hercules,
CA). The coefficient of variation for serum ferritin control pools covering a
range of medium to high concentrations (approximately 25-440 ng/mL)
was 5.4% on average, and for low-concentration pools (5-10 ng/mL) it was
10.5%.7
Selection criteria
Data were extracted from the NHANES CD-ROM.7 For the analysis, we
selected transferrin saturation and serum ferritin values from 19 263 men
and nonpregnant women who were at least 20 years of age. These included
10 507 Caucasians and 8756 African Americans. We excluded subjects with
abnormally low hemoglobin or hematocrit values because anemias of
various causes are associated with abnormally high8-10 or low3,11 transferrin
saturations and serum ferritin concentrations. We excluded subjects with
abnormally low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) levels because a low
MCV can be associated with iron deficiency and inflammation,3 either of
which can lead to altered transferrin saturation and serum ferritin val-
ues.10-13 It has been shown that hemochromatosis probands have mean
MCV values significantly higher than wild-type control subjects,14 and
therefore we did not exclude subjects with MCV values above the reference
range. We excluded subjects with elevated erythrocyte protoporphyrin
because this finding is associated with iron deficiency and inflamma-
tion.15,16 We excluded subjects whose liver function tests were twice the
upper limit of the normal reference range (serum alanine aminotransferase,
serum aspartate aminotransferase, serum -glutamyl transferase, serum
total bilirubin, and serum lactate dehydrogenase) or who had a positive or
borderline serum hepatitis B surface antigen or positive serum hepatitis C
antibody because transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentration
elevations can be associated with hepatocellular damage attributable to
concurrent viral disease and alcohol or drug usage.17 We excluded subjects
with an increased serum C-reactive protein level because inflammation can
affect measures of iron status.18,19 In this study we were unable to account
for intraindividual variation in transferrin saturation due, in part, to diet at
the time of the last meal before the blood collection.
Adjustment of transferrin saturations for diurnal variation
Because transferrin saturation has a diurnal variation,12,20 including
samples obtained at different times of the day, without appropriate
adjustment, might alter the distribution of transferrin saturation. To
address this possibility, regression methods were used to adjust trans-
ferrin saturation values for blood samples drawn in the afternoon or
evening to the predicted values for blood samples drawn in the morning
in the same individuals.1 For each data set, transferrin saturation values
were divided into deciles and a regression equation was determined to
predict the adjusted average value for morning transferrin saturation for
each decile. For blood samples drawn in the afternoon or evening, the
predicted average transferrin saturation value was computed. The final
race- and gender-specific data sets consisted of the actual transferrin
saturation values from samples drawn in the morning and the predicted
values for samples drawn in the afternoon or evening.
Adjustment of the data from African Americans to account for a
possible admixture of Caucasian hereditary
hemochromatosis genes
The data were modified to allow for the possibility that the distribution
of transferrin saturations among African Americans is affected by
individuals who are heterozygotes or homozygotes for hereditary
hemochromatosis. The gene frequency for the hereditary hemochroma-
tosis locus in the Caucasian population is estimated to be 0.067.4
Assuming a 25% admixture of Caucasian genes in the African American
population,21 the gene frequency for the hereditary hemochromatosis
locus in African Americans would be 25% of 0.067 or 0.017. The actual
frequency for the Cys282Tyr mutation among African Americans was
somewhat lower in 2 geographic areas of the United States, a reported
0.011 in San Diego, California22 and 0.007 in Jefferson County,
Alabama.23 Assuming a nationwide gene frequency of 0.017, population
genetics would then project a proportion of homozygotes for the
hereditary hemochromatosis gene of 3/10 000 (0.0172) and a proportion
of heterozygotes of 330/10 000. We assumed that for African Ameri-
cans, the transferrin saturation values from heterozygotes for the
hereditary hemochromatosis locus would be normally distributed with
the same means and SDs as found in our previous study of Caucasian
Americans in NHANES II.2 Under this assumption, to adjust for
hemochromatosis heterozygosity, we removed 3.3% of the 1301 values
from the data set for men (n  43) that were closest to 43 random values
generated from a normal distribution with a mean of 46.5% and an SD of
7%. Similarly, we removed 3.3% of the 1089 values from the data set for
women (n  36) that were closest to 36 random values generated from a
normal distribution with a mean of 43.4% and an SD of 7%. In the case
when several transferrin saturation values were equidistant from a
randomly generated value, one of these values was selected randomly.
Because the number of transferrin saturations arising from homozygotes
for hereditary hemochromatosis was projected to be less than one for
men and women, no further adjustments for possible admixture were
made to the data sets.
Statistical modeling of transferrin saturations
Data sets for transferrin saturation modeling consisted of 1258 African
American men, 1053 African American women, 2328 Caucasian men,
and 2483 Caucasian women (Table 1). As described previously, mixture
distribution modeling was applied to determine the best fit of each
grouped frequency distribution1,2,24 using the DISFIT computer pro-
gram.25 In brief, transferrin saturation values were sorted into intervals
of 2% and the frequency of values within each interval was computed.
The physiologic models we considered were a single normal distribu-
tion, a mixture of 2 normal distributions, and a mixture of 3 normal
distributions. We have previously established that transferrin saturations
in a homogeneous population follow a normal distribution.2 The
expectation-maximization algorithm was applied to the distributions of
transferrin saturation values for parameter estimation.26,27 The statistical
test used to determine the best fitting model was based on the likelihood
ratio statistic. Using a hierarchical structure to analyze each observed
distribution, the maximized log-likelihood function for a mixture of 3
normal distributions was evaluated (Log L3
) and compared with the
maximized log-likelihood function for 2 normal distributions (Log L2
)
and for single normal distribution (Log L1
). Significance of the
likelihood ratio statistics [2Log (L3
/L2
)] and [2Log (L3/
L1
)] at the
0.01 level was assessed using a resampling technique.28 For the
3-population model, the methods of Crump and Howe were used to
compute confidence intervals for proportions.29
Estimation of gene frequency for possible loci
that influence iron status
Accepting the possibility that our findings might represent the presence
of loci that influence iron metabolism, we assumed that the 3 normal
distributions of transferrin saturation in our analyses would represent
predominantly a subpopulation of normal homozygotes, a subpopulation
of heterozygotes, and a subpopulation of affected homozygotes. We
estimated the proportions of normal homozygotes, heterozygotes, and
affected homozygotes as the proportions in the populations with the
lowest, intermediate, and highest mean transferrin saturations, respec-
tively. According to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium equation, p2 (the

proportion of normal homozygotes)  2pq (the proportion of heterozy-
gotes)  q2 (the proportion of abnormal homozygotes)  1. We
estimated the gene frequency of the abnormal allele (q) as the square
root of the proportion from the population with the highest mean
transferrin saturation. We estimated the gene frequency of the normal
homozygotes (p) as the square root of the proportion from the
population with the lowest mean transferrin saturation. We then
examined whether the model distributions were consistent with popula-
tion genetics for a major locus effect in which p  q  1.
The means for transferrin saturation within corresponding subpopula-
tions were compared between African Americans and Caucasians of the
same gender using the independent sample t test.
Comparison of mean serum ferritin concentrations within
subpopulations determined on the basis of
transferrin saturation
A goal of our study was to determine if subpopulations of individuals,
determined on the basis of transferrin saturation, have significantly different
mean iron stores. Considering the transferrin saturation data sets used for
mixture modeling, 26 subjects did not have measurements of serum ferritin
concentration. After removal of values for these individuals, the data sets
for analysis of serum ferritin concentration consisted of 1252 African
American men, 1047 African American women, 2322 Caucasian men, and
2475 Caucasian women. Because of the marked skewness in the distribu-
tions of serum ferritin concentration, the square root transformation was
applied to each data set. Because serum ferritin concentration tends to
increase with age,30-37 we developed a method for age standardization based
on statistical regression analysis. Linear, piece-wise linear, and nonlinear
regression models, stratified by race and gender, were examined by
regressing the square root of the observed serum ferritin concentration on
the age at interview. The best fitting models showed an increase to middle
age followed by steady state or decline in serum ferritin. Because of the lack
of a biologic explanation for age-related decline in serum ferritin in terms of
reduction of iron stores, we adopted a conditional approach to the modeling.
For individuals below 60 years of age we used race- and gender-specific
linear regression equations to calculate the predicted serum ferritin at age
60. For individuals 60 years of age or older, the observed serum ferritin was
used in further analyses.
The probability that an individual serum ferritin concentration value
belonged to one of the 3 transferrin saturation subpopulations was
computed. Given the total sample size, the number of expected
observations within each transferrin saturation interval was calculated.
Within a given transferrin saturation interval, each observation was then
assigned a probability by random assignment from a uniform (0,1)
distribution and these probabilities were used to assign individual serum
ferritin concentration values to a given subgroup according to the
expected proportions within transferrin saturation subpopulations. Two
hundred repetitions of the assignment of serum ferritin concentration
values to subpopulations were made and the average mean and variance
for serum ferritin concentration within subpopulations were computed.
The parametric trend test38 was used to compare the mean square root of
serum ferritin concentration within each of 3 transferrin saturation
subgroups, taking into account the unequal sample sizes for subgroups
of subjects.
Weighting the results to reflect the US population as a whole
The assumptions underlying our analysis were that transferrin saturation
values are independent and identically distributed; that is, each observation
has an equal chance of being selected and that all observations come from
the same distribution. However, because individuals in the NHANES III
sample did not have an equal probability of selection, sample weights must
be used to calculate parameter estimates that reflect the US population. For
NHANES III, a multistage estimation procedure was used to calculate
sample weights so that point estimates would reflect the US population. The
sampling weights were based on the March 1990 and March 1993 Current
Population Survey, adjusted for undercounts, for the civilian noninstitution-
alized US population.39 The methods described above were used to
compute parameter estimates from the weighted transferrin saturation
distributions to reflect results for African American and Caucasian men and
women in the US population fitting our exclusion criteria. It was not
possible to adjust the variance estimates to account for the complex design
of NHANES III.

Results
Analysis of unweighted transferrin saturation data
The primary analysis was performed on transferrin saturations for
7122 individuals. The transferrin saturations had been adjusted for
diurnal variation and for the possible presence of an hereditary
hemochromatosis allele in African Americans. Figure 1 shows the
effect of diurnal variation on measurement of transferrin saturation
for African American men. The graphs indicate the relationship
between decile means for transferrin saturations, determined from
blood drawn in morning examination sessions, and the correspond-
ing mean transferrin saturations determined from blood drawn in
afternoon sessions (Pearson correlation coefficient, r  0.999) and
evening sessions (r  0.997). The regression equations based on
the unweighted data (Figure 1A) are as follows:
Morning session transferrin saturation  0.6  1.0  (Afternoon
session transferrin saturation).
Morning session transferrin saturation  1.5  1.2  (Evening
session transferrin saturation).
These regression lines differed significantly as judged by the F
test for the equality of regression lines (F  262.2 with numerator
and denominator degrees of freedom of 2 and 16, respectively;
P  .0001). Similar results were found for data from African
American women and Caucasian men and women. For each group,
the correlation between decile means for transferrin saturations,
determined from blood drawn in morning examination sessions,
and the corresponding mean transferrin saturations determined
from blood drawn in afternoon sessions and evening sessions was
strong (r  0.99 for all) and the regression lines differed
significantly as judged by the F test for the equality of regression
lines (F test, P  .0001 for all).
Results of statistical mixture modeling indicated that the fit of
the unweighted data to a mixture of 3 normal populations with
unequal variances was significantly better than the fit to a mixture
of 2 normal populations forAfricanAmerican men (likelihood ratio
statistic, 24.1, P  .01) and women (18.8, P  .01) as well as for
Caucasian men (35.3, P  .01) and women (39.7, P  .01).
Similarly, the fit of the data to a mixture of 3 normal populations
was significantly better than the fit to a single normal population for
all:AfricanAmerican men, likelihood ratio statistic, 221.1, P  .01,
and women, 119.7, P  .01; Caucasian men, 416.9, P  .01, and
women, 469.4, P  .01. Figure 2 shows the distribution of
transferrin saturation for African American men (A) and women
(B) and for Caucasian men (C) and women (D). The fitted
subpopulations are superimposed over the histograms of the
observed data. Table 2 gives mixture model parameter estimates for
transferrin saturation subpopulations and shows that for each ethnic
subgroup and gender, transferrin saturation subpopulations were
identified with increasing means (trend test P  .0001 for all). The
findings are consistent with population genetics for single major
loci affecting the distribution of transferrin saturations. For example,

ing afternoon () and evening () examination
sessions for African American men. Panel A shows
unweighted data and panel B data weighted to represent
the US population as a whole. The regression lines are

for African American men the sum of the square roots of the
proportion with the lowest transferrin saturation (p  0.854) and of
the proportion with the highest transferrin saturation (q  0.146)
was approximately 1 (pq  1.000). Corresponding results were
found for African American women (p  0.905, q  0.095) and for
Caucasian men (p  0.902, q  0.098) and women (p  0.927,
q  0.073) where pq  1.000 for all.
Analysis of unweighted serum ferritin concentration data
Our analysis of transferrin saturations demonstrated that 3 subpopu-
lations of individuals could be detected within each ethnic sub-
group and gender. We then compared the age-standardized mean
serum ferritin concentrations for these subpopulations (Table 2).
Trend tests demonstrated an increase in mean serum ferritin
concentration, standardized to age 60, with increasing mean
transferrin saturation for African American men (trend test 2
statistic with 1 degree of freedom, 1385, P  .0001) and women
(858, P  .0001) and for Caucasian men (1746, P  .0001) and
women (418, P  .0001). The mean transferrin saturations within
the middle and upper subpopulations for African American men
and women are significantly lower than those for Caucasians (Table
2). For the second subpopulation, the mean transferrin saturation
value for African American men was 8% lower in absolute value
than that of Caucasian men (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.8%,
9.1%). The mean transferrin saturation for African American
women was 10% lower in absolute value than that of Caucasian
women (8.7%, 11.6%). Considering the upper subpopulation, the
mean transferrin saturation values were 14% (8.2%, 19.2%) lower
in absolute value for African American men than in Caucasian men
and 16% (8.4%, 22.9%) lower in African American women
compared to Caucasian women.
Weighted results for African American and
Caucasian populations
Figure 1B confirms the effect of diurnal variation on measure-
ment of transferrin saturation values using the weighted data.
For African American men, the regression lines differed signifi-
cantly (F  192.9 with numerator and denominator degrees of
freedom of 2 and 16, respectively; P  .0001). Table 3 gives the
mixture modeling results after the data (adjusted for diurnal
variation and age effects in African American and Caucasian
individuals and for the potential presence of hemochromatosis
in African Americans) were weighted to reflect the US popula-
tion as a whole. The weighted results for transferrin saturation
are similar to our primary results using unweighted data, which
suggests that the unequal probability of selection in NHANES
III did not have a major input on the transferrin saturation and
serum ferritin concentration distributions. For example, for
African Americans, the findings for weighted data are consistent
with population genetics for a single major locus affecting the
distribution of transferrin saturations. For men, the sum of the
square roots of the proportion with the lowest transferrin
saturation (p  0.854) and of the proportion with the highest
saturation (q  0.146) is approximately 1 (1.000). Similarly, for
women the sum of the square roots of the proportion with the
lowest transferrin saturation (p  0.904) and of the proportion
with the highest saturation (q  0.104) is also approximately 1
(1.0085). For both ethnic subgroups and each gender, trend tests
demonstrated an increase in mean serum ferritin concentration,

standardized to age 60, with increasing mean transferrin satura-
tion (Table 3; P  .002 for all).
An estimated proportion of 0.861 of Caucasian men studied
were included in a subpopulation with a mean transferrin saturation
of 29.6%, whereas 0.134 comprised a subpopulation with an
intermediate mean saturation of 48.3% and 0.005 formed a
subpopulation with a mean saturation of 82.0%. An estimated
proportion of 0.865 of Caucasian women studied were included in
a subpopulation with a mean saturation of 25.9%, whereas 0.130
comprised a subpopulation with an intermediate mean saturation of
45.5% and 0.005 formed a subpopulation with a mean saturation of
79.3%. From these results, the estimated gene frequencies for
hereditary hemochromatosis were 0.072 (0.070-0.075) for Cauca-
sian men and 0.070 (0.060-0.081) for Caucasian women correspond-
ing to prevalences of 5.2/1000 and 4.9/1000, respectively.
Discussion
In the present study, we identified 3 transferrin saturation subpopu-
lations in African Americans and Caucasians by using specialized
modeling of data from NHANES III. The proportions of these
subpopulations are consistent with Hardy-Weinberg criteria for a
major, common genetic influence on iron metabolism in each of
these 2 broad ethnic groups.
We previously analyzed transferrin saturation data for African
Americans in the NHANES II study and obtained similar findings
regarding a possible major locus affecting iron metabolism.1 In this
regard, it is of interest that an iron-loading genetic defect, distinct
from the Cys282Tyr mutation in HFE that is responsible for most
hemochromatosis in Caucasians,40 may be present in the sub-
SaharanAfrican population,41,42 and that mutations in HFE are very
rare in the African American population.41 The present results are
also consistent with the possibility of an iron-loading genetic defect
in the African American population distinct from that in the
Caucasian population and producing different phenotypes. For
example, the mean transferrin saturations within the middle and
upper subpopulations for African American men and women were
from 8% (95% CI, 6.8%-9.1%) to 16% (8.4%-22.9%) lower,
whereas mean serum ferritin concentrations were substantially
higher than those for Caucasians of the same gender.
In the present study, the estimated gene frequencies for heredi-
tary hemochromatosis in Caucasians based on transferrin saturation
subpopulations were 7.2% (7.0%-7.5%) for men and 7.0% (6.0%-
8.1%) for women corresponding to prevalence estimates of 5.2/
1000 for men and 4.9/1000 for women. These results are consistent
with the reported prevalence of hereditary hemochromatosis and
the frequency of the Csy282Tyr mutation in the HFE gene. For
example, a meta-analysis by Lucotte and Mercier, comprising the
results of recent studies conducted in 40 European populations,
showed an overall frequency of 5.5% for the Cys282Tyr allele,
corresponding to a prevalence estimate of 3/1000 (0.303%) for
Cys282Tyr homozygotes.43
Since NHANES III was conducted before the discovery of the
HFE gene, a limitation of this study is that testing for the
Cys282Tyr mutation and other mutations was not performed.
About 28% of Caucasians have the His63Asp mutation in the HFE
gene.22,44,45 Heterozygotes for His63Asp have only minor changes
in the transferrin saturation22 and are probably included in the
lower Caucasian subpopulation of the analysis of the present study,
whereas homozygotes for His63Asp and compound heterozygotes
(Cys282Tyr/His63Asp) have elevations in transferrin saturation
similar to Cys282Tyr heterozygotes22,46 and are probably included
in the middle Caucasian subpopulation. Only about 10% of African
Americans have the His63Asp mutation with most being heterozy-
gotes and less than 0.5% being homozygotes.22 In the present
analysis of transferrin saturations from African Americans, it is
possible that His63Asp heterozygotes were included in the lower
subpopulation, whereas His63Asp homozygotes were included in
the middle subpopulation. Among Caucasian women, our finding
of an elevation in mean serum ferritin for the middle subpopulation
is consistent with the results found for Cys282Tyr heterozygotes in
the large study conducted by Beutler and colleagues,22 but in
contrast to other investigations in which Caucasian women,
heterozygous for the Cys282Tyr mutation, did not have elevations
in ferritin as compared to normal homozygotes.44,46
We have considered the possibility that adjustment of trans-
ferrin saturations for diurnal variation potentially could introduce
an element of artifact in the analyses. To evaluate this possibility,
we reanalyzed the data using the unadjusted values. As in the
analyses of the adjusted data, these reanalyses identified 3 trans-
ferrin saturation subpopulations with increasing means for each
ethnic subgroup and gender (trend test P  .0001 for all), although
the estimated percentage of cells in corresponding subpopulations
differed slightly (results not shown). Similarly, before correction
for diurnal variation, the means for transferrin saturation within the
middle and upper subpopulations for African American men and
women were 5% (4.4%-6.4%) to 16% (7.3%-24.1%) lower, and the
means for serum ferritin concentration were substantially higher
than those for Caucasians of the same gender. Trend tests also
demonstrated an increase in mean serum ferritin concentration,
standardized to age 60, with increasing mean transferrin saturation
for each group (P  .0001 for all), consistent with the results
observed in the analyses of the adjusted data.
Even among Cys282Tyr homozygotes there is considerable
variability in disease expression,22,47 and the place of testing for the
Cys282Tyr mutation in screening for hemochromatosis has not
been determined. Although serum ferritin concentration was once
suggested as a screening marker for homozygosity for the hemochro-
matosis allele,48 transferrin saturation has been regarded for some
time as the best single screening test for hemochromatosis.49,50
Recent large studies of Caucasians in which both phenotypic
testing with transferrin saturation and genotypic testing for the
Cys282Tyr mutation were performed have shown that screening
with transferrin saturation does not identify all Cys282Tyr homozy-
gotes,22,47 underscoring the fact that the ideal approach to pheno-
typic screening for hemochromatosis has not yet been developed.
In our study of NHANES III data using statistical modeling
methodology, subpopulations identified on the basis of increasing
transferrin saturation had progressively increasing mean age-
adjusted serum ferritin levels in each ethnic group, stratified by
gender. These results suggest that it may be possible to develop a
practical approach to the initial screening for iron overload that
includes the combination of transferrin saturation and serum
ferritin concentration measurements.
