Introduction
The conclusion of an argumentative essay usually reminds
the readers of its central point and concludes the essay grace-
fully and naturally. Rosenwasser and Stephen (2011) asserted
that the concluding part has social function of escorting the
readers to go out of the essay. Conclusion is invariably
stressed in writing instruction and examinations. For exam-
ple, in the Test for English Majors Band 4 (TEM-4) and
TEM-8 in China, a composition without a conclusion is
regarded as incomplete and gets a lower score. Much research
has been conducted on the moves and discourse markers in
the conclusions of academic papers (Brunton, 2005; Dong,
1998; Paltridge, 2002; Yang & Allison, 2003). But there is a
lack of published research on the conclusions of English as
Foreign Language (EFL) essays. And, fewer studies in EFL
argumentative essays have addressed such aspects as moves,
L1 rhetorical transfer, and proficiency level. Thus, the goal
of this study is to fill the gap.
Conclusions of English Argumentative
Essays
Some studies analyze the concluding part in terms of moves.
Bhatia (1993) contended that a move is designed for the real-
ization of a specific goal and intention although the ultimate
goal of this move is to fulfill discourse communication.
Rosenwasser and Stephen (2011) proposed three moves in a
concluding part: accomplishing a full circle by revisiting the
way an essay begins, pursuing implications by reasoning
from the focus of the essay to broader issues, and identifying
limitations by acknowledging restrictions of method. Krusel
(1992)dividedconclusionintotwomoves:InternalOutcomes
and External Outcomes. The former summarizes discourse
content whereas the latter is an extension of the central idea.
Analyzing 40 essays from newspapers, magazines, encyclo-
pedia, travel books and atlases, management textbooks, and
academic essays, Henry and Roseberry (1997) also proposed
two moves in conclusion: Commitment to the Central Idea
and Expansion.
All of those divisions can be dated back to Hyland (1990)
who divided Conclusion into four moves: Discourse Marker,
Consolidation, Affirmation, and Close. The first three moves
correspond to "Commitment to the Central Idea" (Henry &
Roseberry, 1997), "Internal Outcomes" (Krusel, 1992), and
Rosenwasser and Stephen's (2011) first move. Close is simi-
lar to Rosenwasser and Stephen's last two moves, Krusel's

Moves and Wrap-Up Sentences in
Chinese Students' Essay Conclusions
Donghong Liu1
Abstract
Whether L1 (first language) rhetorical transfer affects L2 (second language) writing remains a controversial issue. Based
on Hyland's move theory, this article focuses on the moves and the quality of wrap-up sentences in essay conclusions,
exploring the impact of L1 rhetorical transfer. One hundred eighty-four expository essays written by Chinese college
students were analyzed, as well as 20 English and 20 Chinese model essays. Besides, sentence-initial discourse markers in 100
Chinese model essays were collected and categorized to investigate why Chinese teachers and students favor certain English
linking adverbials. The research results show that the Chinese students displayed their strategy use in Discourse Marker,
Consolidation and Close, but the preference to certain sets of linking adverbials and Affirmation move can be attributed to
the L1 rhetorical transfer at lexical level and text level. In this study, L1 rhetorical transfer has been found to go hand in hand
with strategy use. For the students at tertiary level, strategy use might overweigh L1 rhetorical transfer.

"External Outcomes" and Henry and Roseberry's "Expan-
sion." Hyland's classification is easier for researchers to
identify the moves.
1. Discourse Marker is optional and the number of the
expressions serving as discourse markers is limited.
The frequently used expressions, such as in a word,
in short, all in all, in conclusion, and in sum, signal
the closing of an essay.
2. Consolidation is obligatory with its major function as
referring "back to the content of the argument section
to relate the themes of the argument stage with the
proposition" (Hyland, 1990, p. 74) and gluing the
thesis, the arguments, and the conclusion together.
For example,

Thus the quality of the graduates is improved and
the various sectors of the community are satisfied.
3. Affirmation restates the thesis of an essay and
echoes the introduction. This move is also optional
and flexible because it may appear before or after the
Consolidation move. For example,

To sum up, I strongly advise that more money
should be spent on the primary sector.
4. Close move provides a prospective focus, in contrast
to the retrospective function of Affirmation and
Consolidation. It looks forward to unstated aspects of
the discussion by expanding the context, comment-
ing on the problem under discussion, and provoking
the readers to think. For example,

The future of the country will be jeopardized if
nothing is done to improve this sector.
In this study, Hyland's classification is adopted, with
Consolidation and Affirmation regarded as wrap-up sen-
tences that summarize the whole essay. Rosenwasser and
Stephen (2011) also emphasized this part and they called it
"culmination" (p. 187), to put it mundanely, bringing together
things already said and ascending to one final statement.
Although much has been discussed about the conclusion of
an academic paper, related empirical studies on the conclu-
sion of an EFL argumentative essay is scarce. As Hyland
(2009) put it, "the essay is regarded as a key acculturation
practice" (p. 132) for the EFL learners. In view of the impor-
tance of the conclusion of EFL argumentative essay, much
research on this genre is needed.
L1 Rhetorical Transfer
Transfer occurs when learning in one context or with one set
of materials influences performance in another context or
another set of materials (James, 2014). Odlin (1989) defined
transfer as the influence resulting from the similarities and
differences between the target language and any other lan-
guage that has been previously acquired. The transfer can be
manifested as facilitation, avoidance, and overuse. L1 knowl-
edge across all layers of language can influence L2 solutions
at all levels (Ortega, 2009). But Ellis (1999) maintained that
transfer is more conspicuous at lexical and text levels than at
grammatical level. Accordingly, this article focuses on the
two levels.
Rhetorical mode may also be reflected at lexical level,
syntactic level, and text level. Kaplan (2001) first pointed out
the transfer of L1 text organization into L2 English composi-
tions. Subsequently, many studies have analyzed English
articles written by native English speakers and the ESL
learners. They have found that native English speakers are
more direct and take a linear style in discourse composing
whereas non-native English speakers such as Chinese,
Japanese, Korean, and Indonesian students use a more indi-
rect and circular style because of their L1 rhetorical modes
(Hinkel, 1997, 2002; Lee, 2003; Matalene, 1985).
More studies have been carried out at the lexical level,
especially linking adverbials. Mohamed-Sayidina (2010)
analyzed 50 academic papers and stated that EFL Arab stu-
dents transfer Arabic rhetorical modes of propositional
development (realized by additive transition words) into
their English compositions. The number of additive transi-
tion words is significantly greater than the number of adver-
sative, temporal, or causative transitions. At the sentential
level, the number of additive transitions is significantly
greater than the number of adversative or causative transi-
tions. Liu (2013) interviewed 10 L1 Chinese speakers and
investigated the effect of L1 Chinese on the use of English
discourse markers. The results showed that the L1 Chinese
speakers using I think in medial or final position may have
transferred from their L1 wo juede, that the use of yeah/yes
may be transferred from the corresponding Chinese expres-
sion dui, and that ah was found to perform a clause-medial
function.
However, other studies that focused on the rhetorical
differences between L1 and L2 writings do not treat L1 rhe-
torical transfer as one of the causes. For example, Lei
(2012) investigated the use of linking adverbials in the
Chinese doctoral students'academic writing. By comparing
20 applied linguistic doctoral dissertations and 120 pub-
lished articles written by professionals, he reported that 33
linking adverbials were overused by the doctoral students,
among which were the summative adverbials such as
"therefore," "to sum up," "in a word," "in summary," and
"so." Meanwhile, 25 adverbials, especially adversative
ones, were underused. The doctoral students relied more
heavily on a limited set of linking adverbials than the pro-
fessional writers. Leedham and Cai (2014) compared the
Chinese and British students' writing in U.K. universities
and confirmed that a key area of difference was the Chinese
Liu 3
students' higher use of informal sentence-initial linking
adverbials (e.g., besides, on the other hand). The research-
ers argued that the Chinese students were primed to use
certain linking adverbials by the secondary school teaching
materials and book-focused teaching approach (Milton &
Hyland, 1999; Paquot, 2010). That is to say, it is strategy
use instead of L1 rhetorical transfer that caused the Chinese
student writers to use more linking adverbials. Whether L1
rhetorical transfer affects L2 writing remains a controver-
sial issue and more studies are needed. In addition, up to
date few studies have analyzed further why Chinese teachers
and book writers select certain linking adverbials and why
Chinese students prefer the limited set of linking adverbials
to other forms. This article intends to address the gap, with
the focus narrowed to essay conclusions.
Research Method
Research Questions
The impact of transfer might involve "efficacy (e.g., the
quality of a student's work), efficiency (e.g., the speed of a
student's work), or approach (e.g., the procedure a student
uses)" (James, 2014, p. 2). In view of the significance of con-
clusion and the questions unanswered in previous studies,
this article focuses on moves and quality of wrap-up sen-
tences, exploring "approach" and "efficacy." The following
questions are raised:
Research Question 1: Does L1 rhetorical mode influence
the use of moves in the L2 essay conclusions?
Research Question 2: Does L1 rhetorical mode affect the
quality of wrap-up sentences?
Participants and Writing Task
Ninety-four undergraduates at three year levels participated in
this study. All of them majored in English Language and
Literature in the English department of a university in central
China. "English Writing" was a compulsory course for English
majors in the first 2 years in all the universities in China. In
this study, both the first-year group (30 students) and the sec-
ond-year group (31 students) were taking this course. Both the
groups were the students of two classes taught by the same
teacher, the author of this article. The third-year group (33 stu-
dents) had already finished the writing course (once taught by
the same teacher) when they participated in this study. They
were the students of a Comprehensive English class, another
compulsory course. All the participants had at least learned
about English exposition. The participants of the same group
had similar learning experience as they all entered the univer-
sity right from high school.
In this study, they were asked to write two essays with
prompts within 40 min. The essay prompts were modeled
on such standardized tests as the TEM-4 and TEM-8 for the
purpose of eliciting essays in the rhetorical mode of exposi-
tion. One essay had a restricted topic and the other had an
open topic. Prompts of the two essays are as follows:
Essay 1: Recently, a survey carried out by a consulting
company reveals that by the end of 2007, the percentage
of the netizens shopping online has reached 50.4% and
45.1% respectively in Shanghai and Beijing.
Write a composition of about 200 words on the following
topic: Advantages of Shopping Online
Essay 2: It's quite popular in colleges in China that stu-
dents give evaluation to teachers when finishing certain
courses. Some say it is good to both teachers' work and
students' academic study, while others believe it does
harm to the teacher-student relationship. What's your
opinion?
Write a composition of about 200 words on the following
topic: Students'Evaluation of Teachers
The first-year group and the second-year group were asked
to finish the two writing tasks in class as their course work.
They would get feedback from the teacher later about the
advantages and weak points of their essays and some sugges-
tions for revision. The third-year group did the essay writing
in their Comprehensive English class because they had no
English Writing course and Comprehensive English also
involved writing. The third-year students were preparing for
TEM-8, and they were eager to get some feedback and sug-
gestions for essay writing. So they were cooperative in this
study. However, two students failed to hand in both the essays,
thus excluding the them; the third-year group consisted of 31
students. Altogether 184 essays were collected.
Data Collection and Analysis
Data collection of the participants' essays includes three
aspects: presence of concluding paragraph, moves, and
wrap-up sentences. Specific criteria have been established.
A. Presence of concluding paragraph
B. Moves (presence of a move gets 1 point; absence gets 0)
1.Discourse Marker:
Discourse markers may be of various types and there is no
agreement as to how to identify them. But in this study only
sentence-initial linking adverbials called "lexical teddy
bears" by Hasselgren (1994, p. 237) are counted in, for the
reason that those words are listed in the textbooks and refer-
ence materials and the impact of the teaching materials leads
to the Chinese students' high use of those linking adverbials
(Leedham & Cai, 2014; Lei, 2012). Take for example, to sum
up, in conclusion, in a word.
4 SAGE Open
2.Affirmation:
It is the restatement of thesis. In the following example, the
first sentence is Affirmation, which emphasizes the benefits
of traveling abroad and echoes the thesis in the introduction.
All of this being said, traveling abroad, without doubt, is
beneficial and helpful. Whether you want to have a rest or you
intend to broaden your horizon, traveling abroad is a good
choice. What are you waiting for, if both time and money
permitting? I wager that you can gain a lot from it and will
never regret making this decision.
3.Consolidation:
This move summarizes all the claims that support the thesis
statement. In the above example, the sentence "Whether you
want to have a rest or you intend to broaden your horizon,
obviously,travelingabroadisagoodchoice"isConsolidation,
which summarizes two claims in the essay. If Affirmation
and Consolidation appear in the same sentence, both of the
moves are counted in.
4.Close:
In this study, the sentences that cannot be categorized into
the previous three moves are counted as Close.
C. Quality of wrap-up sentences
Wrap-up sentences consist ofAffirmation and Consolidation,
which summarize the whole essay. The quality of wrap-up
sentences is investigated in terms of the two moves. The
highest score of the quality is 5 and the lowest is 0. The
following shows the specific criteria:
i. The presence of Affirmation wins 1 point. If there is
any variation in words or syntactic structures differ-
ent from the thesis statement, another 0.5 is added.
ii. The presence of Consolidation wins 1 point. If there
is any variation in words or syntactic structures dif-
ferent from the topic sentences, another 0.5 is added.
iii. If either Affirmation or Consolidation can summarize
the essay, 1 point is added. If both of the two moves
can summarize the essay, still only 1 point is added.
But if the sentences are only repetition of the thesis
statement or the topic sentences, 0 point is added.
iv. If Affirmation or Consolidation can not only summa-
rize the essay but also bears no serious error at gram-
matical or lexical level, another 0.5 is added. Here
serious errors mean those that hinder reading and
comprehension. Spelling mistakes are neglected.
v. If Affirmation or Consolidation bears no errors and
summarizes the essay at a higher level such as using
metaphor and superordinates, another 0.5 is added.
To identify the impact of L1 rhetorical transfer, the con-
clusions of Chinese model essays were compared with
those of the English counterparts. The English model essays
were selected from two English writing textbooks pub-
lished in China and available in many bookstores. They
were College Writing Skills With Readings (Langan, 2011)
and The College Writer (Kanar, 2011). In the former
textbook, 14 expositions written by the English speaking
students were selected, and in the latter 6 were included. To
get the same number of Chinese model essays of the same
genre written by Chinese counterparts, a Chinese essay
book comprising 500 expository model essays was used,
compiled by Jiangping Xiong (2011) for high school stu-
dents to prepare for the National Matriculation Entrance
Tests (NMET). The Chinese model essays were selected at
random from the very beginning of the book, with every
fifth essay used as the target essay for analysis. In addition,
for the purpose of investigating, the Chinese frequently
used discourse markers, the first 100 essays written on 24
topics were selected from Xiong's book. In this study, only
the sentence-initial discourse markers in the concluding
parts were collected and categorized.
The author of this article identified the moves and eval-
uated the quality of wrap-up sentences for two times, with
an interval of 2 months. The final score of each wrap-up
sentence is the average of the two scores. Qualitative and
quantitative analyses were used in data analysis. In quanti-
tative analyses, non-parametric statistical comparisons
were used because the move numbers and the scores of the
wrap-up sentence quality were not normally distributed.
Kruskal-Wallis tests were used as a measure of the differ-
ences among the three groups of participants. Wilcoxon
Signed Rank tests were used for topic effect of the two
essays. Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare the
moves of English and Chinese model essays.
Research Results
Moves
In this study, nearly all the essays had concluding paragraphs,
with an exception of one in the third-year group, one in the
second-year group, and another one in the first-year group.
The three groups displayed differences in the number of
moves in Table 1. The total moves of the first-year group
(158) reached the highest as well as their number of Discourse
Marker (49). As for Affirmation, the three groups approxi-
mate in number. But it is a different case in Consolidation
where the first-year group produced far less frequency than
the other two groups. The last move Close was also charac-
terized by the gap between the first-year group and the other
two groups; however, the first-year group predominated in
number. The frequencies of the moves can be sequenced as
follows:
Liu 5
Total: Affirmation > Discourse Marker > Close >
Consolidation
Third-year group: Affirmation > Discourse Marker >
Consolidation > Close
Second-year group: Affirmation > Discourse Marker >
Close = Consolidation
First-year group: Discourse Marker >Affirmation > Close
> Consolidation
Table 1 also provides the percentages of moves in each
group, and Figure 1 demonstrates the development tendency
of each move. Close presents a clear tendency of decline,
whereas Consolidation displays a rising tendency. However,
Affirmation almost keeps a horizontal line. Discourse Marker
has a V-shaped curved line. The three groups were compared
in the mean frequency of each kind of moves and submitted
to Kruskal-Wallis tests (k independent samples). All the
moves except Affirmation had significant difference among
the three groups. The results corroborate the tendencies in
Figure 1 and provide an explanation for the even and smooth
line of Affirmation.
Table 2 shows the result of comparison of the total move
numbers between the two essays. Each group demonstrates
quite approximate mean move numbers in the two essays.
The Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests show no significant differ-
ence between the two essays.
Three kinds of Close--appealing, solution, and prediction
or expectation--are found in this study. Example 1 has a typi-
cal prediction Close. In Example 2, the second clause that is
supposed to be a separate sentence is a typical pattern of
appealing Close. The Close in Example 3 displays solution.
Example 1: In conclusion, I believe that shopping online
is a general trend. With the development of economic and
technology, more and more people will use shopping
online in future.
Example 2: Briefly, students' evaluation is good for both,
why don't we keep and develop it?
Example 3: So, the starting point of Student Evaluation of
Teachers is good, but it's very hard to implement. Students
and teachers should strengthen communication in the
usual teaching to improve the quality of teaching.
All the discourse markers used in the student essays
except "above all" can be categorized into three groups:
Group 1 summarizing ideas: in a word, all in all, to sum
up, in short, in summary, generally speaking, summarily
Group 2 expressing ideas: as far as I am concerned, in my
view, in my opinion
Group 3 inferring results: in conclusion, to draw a
conclusion, therefore, so
Each group has corresponding Chinese expressions that
are common in Chinese essays, although in most cases,
Chinese discourse markers are scarcely used. It is supported
by the result of the analysis of the Chinese model essays. By
analyzing the concluding parts, we found 21 essays carrying
sentence-initial discourse markers in their concluding parts.
Three Chinese discourse markers in five conclusions--"zong
zhi (all in all, to sum up, in summary)," "zui hou yi ju hua (in
a word)," and "zong de lai shuo (in a word)"--fall into the
first group summarizing ideas. Another three discourse
markers in five conclusions belong to the second group
expressing ideas: "wo ren wei (I think)," "wo xiang xin
(I believe)," and "wo xiang (I think)." The third group infer-
ring results include four discourse markers appearing in 11

conclusions: "yin ci (therefore)," "suo yi (so)," "you ci ke jian
(it follows from above that)," and "you ci kan lai (it follows
from above that)." All these Chinese discourse markers can
be matched with the English sentence-initial adverbials in the
three groups found in the participants' essays (Table 3).
Table 4 shows frequency and percentage of each move in
the English and the Chinese model essays. Percentage means
the portion of each move against the 20 essays. Neither the
English nor the Chinese essays carry many discourse mark-
ers in the conclusions. However, there's great disparity in
Affirmation and Consolidation between the two kinds of
essays. But Close is lavishly used in both kinds of essays,
especially in the Chinese model ones. Mann-Whitney tests
(two independent samples) only show significant differences
in Affirmation and Consolidation.
Wrap-Up Sentences
The wrap-up sentence quality of each group was compared
between the two essays to test topic effect. None of the
results of Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests was statistically sig-
nificant (see Table 5). It can also be seen from Table 5 that
the third-year group could write much better wrap-up sen-
tences than the first-year group, with the second-year group
in between. Kruskal-Wallis test (k independent samples)
showed significant difference in both essays. No significant
difference between the two essays was found by Wilcoxon
Signed Rank tests. Displaying the developmental process of
the Chinese EFL learners, the result corroborates and justi-
fies our classification of the groups.
Examples 4, 5, and 6 manifest the wrap-up sentences of
different quality and the difference of developmental stages.
"TS" in the examples means Topic Sentence. Example 4 has
both Affirmation (1 point) and Consolidation (1 point). The
words in the two moves differ from the three topic sentences
(1 point). The moves, especially Consolidation can summa-
rize the ideas in the essay (1 point). The writer used "go
shopping both effectively and efficiently" to encapsulate the
above three paragraphs. In fact, the summarization is at a
higher level (0.5 point). There's no syntactic or lexical error
(0.5 point).
Example 4: (TS1) Firstly, the price of the goods is reason-
able and acceptable . . .
(TS2) Secondly, shopping online is a time-saving
alternative . . .
(TS3) Thirdly, it is convenient to us to shop online . . .
All in all, shopping online is a practical way for us to do
our purchase (Affirmation). We can go shopping both
effectively and efficiently (Consolidation; 5 points, third-
year group).
Example (5) has only Consolidation (1 point) as wrap-up
sentence, which can cover the ideas in the essay (0.5
point) with the wording totally different from the topic

sentences (0.5 point) and without any syntactic or lexical
error (0.5 point).
Example (5) (TS1) First, I think the biggest advantage is
that it's convenient . . .
(TS2) The second advantage is also very attractive, that
is, the price is low . . .
(TS3) The third advantage is that there is no area and
time limited when shopping on line . . .
Considering the convenience, the low price and the free
choices, it's no wonder that online shopping is more and
more popular in recent years (Consolidation; 2.5 points,
second-year group).
Like Example (5), Example (6) has only Consolidation
(1 point), which can barely summarize the ideas in the essay
(0.5 point) because the second topic sentence is not clear
enough (e.g., Shopping is no more than convenience). But
there is much lexical repetition and an error--convenience.
The whole conclusion is too simple in idea.
Example (6) (TS1) As the internet fast developing, the
electronic commerce had already walk into everyone's
routine, especially for our young people, who always
follows the fashion . . .
(TS2) Shopping is no more than convenience, it can help
you save a lot of money as well . . .
So, as far as I am concerned, shopping online is not only
convenience, fashionable, but also save you a lot of
money (Consolidation; 1.5 points, first-year group).
Discussion
Discourse markers are not encouraged or widely used in
Chinese model essays or in English model essays (see
Table 4). However, more than half of the essays written by
the participants in this study have this move. That cannot be
attributed to L1 transfer. Instead, strategy use may be a caus-
ing factor. Because all the participants had learned English
expository writing, the teachers' instruction to help them
pass the exams might impress them greatly. They tend to use
such strategies to connect the paragraphs and add more
words to their essays. Moreover, in Figure 1, Discourse
Marker displays a V-shaped curved line. The second-year
group displayed a decrease in this move. It is speculated that
these participants might be tired of those "lexical teddy
bears" and tried to reject them in writing. The third-year
group was preparing for the TEM-8 test and was ready to
take the strategy for examination, hence more Discourse
Marker moves appeared in their writing.
In Discourse Marker move, linking adverbials are over-
used by the first-year group, which contributes to the highest
total number of the moves (81.67%). The English linking
adverbials used by the Chinese student writers have counter-
parts in the Chinese essays (see Table 3), and once the
Chinese writers choose to use discourse markers in their
Chinese conclusions, they almost always use those three-
group sentence-initial adverbials. Many researchers attribute
the high use of particular linking adverbials to the English
teaching materials and book-focused teaching approach
(Leedham & Cai, 2014; Milton & Hyland, 1999; Paquot,
2010). However, theirs might be a surficial reason. As must
be emphasized, those Chinese equivalent adverbials are
much more formal in style than the English adverbials. Even
the teachers may not be fully aware of the difference. To
illustrate, whereas "in a word" is viewed as an informal link-
ing adverbial (Leedham & Cai, 2014), its Chinese equivalent
jian yan zhi or zong zhi in many dictionaries (e.g., You Dao,
one of the most popular web dictionaries with Chinese col-
lege students) is fairly formal due to its ancient style. The L1
rhetorical mode is so deeply rooted in the L1 writing that the
three-group linking adverbials are recommended and empha-
sized by the teachers and preferred by the students. The con-
cepts of the Chinese linking adverbials and their usage may
be transferred into English. It can be followed that the L1
rhetorical mode "primed" the teachers and the students to
select those three-group sentence-initial adverbials. For the
less proficient student writers, it is much easier to transfer
from L1 the concepts of those linking adverbials and memo-
rize the English counterparts than to create ideas and to
produce English sentences. Moreover, they prefer to clutter
the text with too many linking adverbials so as to achieve
surface logicality (Chen, 2006; Lei, 2012).
Although the high use of certain sets of linking adverbials
is possibly L1 rhetorical transfer revealed at lexical level, at
textual level, the reason why Affirmation is greatly embraced
by the three groups may also be attributed to the Chinese
inductive rhetorical mode (Connor, 1996; Hinkel, 2002;
Kaplan, 2001; Lee, 2003), although Hyland (1990) just
considered it as optional. Affirmation move corresponds to
"putting forward the thesis" (Wang, 2006, p. 181) in Chinese
argumentation, which is usually required of the concluding
part but optional in the introduction. The comparison between
the English and the Chinese model essays shows the great
disparity in the use of Affirmation move. The Chinese model
essay writers prefer this typical Chinese rhetorical mode.
According to L1 transfer theory, "L1 knowledge can inhibit
certain L2 choices and prime others, thus resulting in the
underuse or overuse of certain L2 forms in spoken and written
learner production" (Ortega, 2009, p. 41). The research result
of the participants' essays reveals that Affirmation is the
obvious transfer of L1 rhetorical mode at all proficiency levels,
because the participants' knowledge about Affirmation in
Chinese writing primed the high frequency in their English
writing. Moreover, for the less proficient writers,Affirmation
is easier to produce than Consolidation and Close, for they
can at least repeat their thesis statements (if any in the intro-
duction) to create final paragraphs and make their essays
longer.
Consolidation was considered by Hyland (1990) as an
obligatory move that is supported by the investigation of
8 SAGE Open
English model essays in this study (see Table 4). Ninety per-
cent of the English model essays have such a move. However,
Consolidation is rare in Chinese essays. Consolidation finds
no position in Chinese writing. Any words referring back to
the previous arguments are regarded as redundant and too
explicit for the readers to explore the implication. What is
absent in L1 possibly leads to underuse in L2 writing or
speaking. It is not strange to find that the first-year group
used much fewer Consolidation moves. Contrarily, as more
proficient writers, the second-year group and especially
the third-year group used more Consolidation moves. They
were fully aware of the importance of Consolidation and
were more skillful at using this move as a strategy to deal
with examinations. The increase of the number indicated the
rising awareness and practice of the writing strategy leading
to typical English writing.
Close is another instance of strategy use. The typical types
of Close such as appealing, solution, and expectation or pre-
diction are greatly encouraged to utilize in Chinese essays
and much importance is attached to florid, ornamental, and
thought-provoking words (Wang, 2006; Xiong, 2011). Table 4
shows that not only the Chinese model essays but also the
English ones favor this move. L2 learners tend to use a lin-
guistic phenomenon existing in both L1 and L2 (Ortega,
2009). The first-year group found no difficulty applying
Close in their English essays. Nevertheless, the L1 rhetorical
transfer seemed mitigated in the second-year and the third-
year groups. The number of Close was inversely proportional
to the proficiency level. The more proficient the students
were, the more they want to abandon it and find other chal-
lenging ways to end their essays. They might concentrate on
improving the quality of Consolidation and Affirmation, thus
the efficacy of their work may be their major concern.
Therefore, strategy use played a more important role, which
overweighed the transfer of L1 rhetorical mode.
Our speculation is supported by the result of comparison of
wrap-up sentence quality among the three groups in Table 5.
On one hand, the quality of wrap-up sentences requires reca-
pitulating ability. The three groups displayed significant dif-
ference in the quality of wrap-up sentences, which increased
with the proficiency level. The first-year group in this study
had difficulty in substituting superordinate words for specific
ideas and in using synonyms to avoid monotonous lexical rep-
etition. Apart from that, their lack of ability to clearly convey
ideas might be another cause of the inefficacy of recapitula-
tion, as can be seen in Example 5.The causes of the first-year
group's poor ability of summarizing texts were different from
those of the young native speakers of English who could not
identify important text information (Brown & Day, 1983;
Winograd, 1984). On the other hand, the more important cause
may be strategy use. The second-year group and the third-
year group allocated more attention to Affirmation and
Consolidation so as to improve the unity and coherence of
their essays. The third-year group, especially, had higher
awareness of Consolidation and quality of the move.
Conclusion
With moves and wrap-up sentences as the major concern,
this study has explored the developmental process of the
Chinese EFL learners in terms of L1 rhetorical transfer at
lexical level and text level. L1 rhetorical transfer is a compli-
cated issue that cannot be studied regardless of other factors.
L1 rhetorical transfer has been found to go hand in hand with
strategy use in this study. The findings may be summarized
as follows:
1. The Chinese students displayed their strategy use in
Discourse Marker move because they used a far
greater number of linking adverbials than the
Chinese model essay writers. But the preference to
certain sets of linking adverbials can be attributed
to the L1 rhetorical transfer at lexical level. The
students at all proficiency levels preferred to
use Affirmation, which may be ascribed to L1
rhetorical transfer at text level. Consolidation, a
typical English move, demonstrated an increasing
tendency with the proficiency level improving,
whereas Close displayed a decline although this
move is encouraged in both English and Chinese
essays. The two phenomena have little to do with
L1 rhetorical transfer. Strategy use can be a major
cause.
2. Strategy use can also be seen in the quality of wrap-
up sentences. Consolidation move, which played a
key role in the efficacy evaluation, was superior not
only in quantity but also in quality in the essays of
more proficient students. These students allocated
more time and attention to the quality of wrap-up
sentences at the cost of Close move. It can be seen
that for the students at tertiary level, strategy use
might overweigh L1 rhetorical transfer.
Although the current data cannot be conclusive about
performance of all L1 Chinese EFL learners, the study is
aimed at providing a suggestive picture of how Chinese
rhetorical mode influences English expository writing.
However, this study has some limitations. It can be noted
that the line of Discourse Marker in Figure 1 is not smooth
because the second-year group produced fewer linking
adverbials in Discourse Marker move than the other two
groups. Although there's slight difference between the sec-
ond-year and the third-year groups, yet some reasons might
lie behind. Confined to text analysis, this study failed to
identify the specific reasons. Text-based interviews would
be useful in qualitative study and would be used in future
studies in this area.
