Chinese Children Aged 9­15 Years in a
Public Choice Task

Abstract
Both children and adults exhibit moderate conformity behaviors when facing group pressure. While some studies purport that
children conform more with age, others have shown the opposite. The publicity of decision-making might be a major factor
influencing the development of children's conformity behavior. In this study, we recruited 295 Chinese children aged 9­15 years.
We observed no significant correlation between children's age and conformity behaviors when their answers were kept confi-
dential. However, older children showed stronger conformity behaviors when their answers were made public. According to
cultural evolutionary theory, with age, children find group acceptance and social recognition increasingly more important, which
explains why older children are more likely to conform--namely, doing so has adaptive value. Further research should explore the
cross-cultural coherence of this phenomenon and the genuine motivation behind children's conformity behaviors. Meanwhile,
designing a more reliable and valid experiment would also be a fruitful direction.

As a group-living species, humans have developed various
social behaviors such as conformity. Conformity refers to the
common phenomenon that individuals' behaviors or attitudes
become consistent with those of other group members under
the real or imagined pressure from those group members
(Asch, 1956; Cialdini & Goldstein, 2004). Although confor-
mity usually has negative connotations--such as a lack of
independence and assertion--it is nevertheless important for
adapting to a changing society in most cases. Conformity is an
important mechanism for social learning and can help indi-
viduals learn social information quickly and accomplish
socialization smoothly (Boyd & Richerson, 1985). Formal
cultural evolution theory holds that conformity promotes the
development of cultural diversity and in-group stability (Hen-
rich & Henrich, 2007).
Conformity tends to appear at around age 3 and persists into
adulthood (Corriveau & Harris, 2010). Furthermore, children's
conformity has been shown to increase with age. Costanzo and
Shaw (1966) investigated participants' conformity behavior at
different ages and found that conformity was lowest among
those aged 7­9; it then increased with age to an asymptotic
point at 11­13 years of age. Other researchers have reported
only a slight increase in conformity between 3 and 10 years of
age (Hamm & Hoving, 1969; Iscoe, Williams, & Harvey,
1963). Morgan, Laland, and Harris (2015) predicted that, as
they age, children's conformity behavior approaches that of
adults--that is, children become more sensitive to the unan-
imous majority opinion. According to cultural evolutionary
theory, this conformity is adaptive. However, a few studies
have shown that children become less prone to conform with
age. For instance, some researchers showed that children's
level of conformity decreased significantly between 3 and 10
years of age (Bishop & Beckman, 1971; Cohen, Bornstein, &

Sherman, 1973). Similarly, Walker and Andrade (1996)
reported a decline in conformity responses between 3 and 17
years of age, while Ceci and Bruck (1993) concluded that the
younger the children are, the more susceptible they are to
information given by others.
Using mathematical models and experimental studies,
researchers have identified various factors that can influence
individuals' conformity behaviors such as the objects of con-
formity (e.g., parents or peers; Costanzo, 1970), cognitive
style (Witkin, Moore, Goodenough, & Cox, 1977), gender
(Bishop & Beckman, 1971; Haun & Tomasello, 2011), race
(Chen, Corriveau, & Harris, 2013), and task difficulty. These
factors may be the reason for the lack of consistency in study
results. For instance, a recent study found that 7-year-olds, but
not 3-year-olds, copied others more on difficult trials than on
easy trials (Morgan, Laland, & Harris, 2015). For the easy
trials, children aged 3­9 years showed no significant differ-
ences in conformity. In another study, a sample of Caucasian
females aged 7­15 years conformed more than did African
American females of a similar age range (Iscoe, Williams, &
Harvey, 1964). Similarly, rural Mexican children aged 7­9
years conformed more than did their Anglo-American coun-
terparts (Kagan, 1974).
The impact of gender, race, and task difficulty on children's
tendency to conform has been previously explored. However,
there have been few studies on the effect of the publicity of
decision-making on the development of children's conformity
behavior. Researchers have suggested that in an anonymous
context, in both childhood and adulthood, individuals con-
sciously or unconsciously make judgments and decisions by
referring to others' behaviors and opinions in order to ensure
that they have acted properly (Deutsch & Gerard, 1955;
Hornsey, Majkut, Terry, & McKimmie, 2003). By contrast,
in public conditions, individuals tend to go against their own
opinions to match those of the majority in order to avoid group
isolation or obtain a positive assessment from others (Mann,
1969). For example, Haun and Tomasello (2011) asked 4-year-
olds to make a judgment anonymously under the pressure of a
unanimous majority opinion; later, the children were informed
that their judgment would be revealed and were given the
opportunity to revise the decision. They found that most of the
children with the minority opinion chose to alter their judgment
to fit with the majority. Thus, children appear to be differently
sensitive to the unanimous majority opinion depending on
whether their responses are anonymous or public.
Our study examines the influence of publicity on children's
conformity behavior from a developmental perspective. We
presume that older children are more likely to conform in a
public context. Previous studies have demonstrated that older
children are more sensitive to group opinions compared to
younger children (Morgan et al., 2015). Additionally,
Aloise-Young (1993) found that conformity can be used stra-
tegically by children to manage others' evaluations of their
public self after 8 years of age. The potential conflict that
could arise from standing alone against a majority, based on
past experience, compelled children to avoid such conflicts by
giving the same response as the majority (Haun & Tomasello,
2011). Therefore, the older the children, the more readily they
will go against their own judgments and respond in a way
consistent with the majority when they are in conflict with
other group members.
Specifically, children may show less conformity as they
grow older in an anonymous context. Previous studies have
shown that, in early childhood, the mechanism for integrating
social information into decision-making is immature. Thus,
younger children are more likely to rely on guidance from
others when they encounter uncertain or difficult problems
(Corriveau & Harris, 2010; Herrmann, Legare, Harris, &
Whitehouse, 2013; Williamson, Meltzoff, & Markman,
2008). However, they appear to grow more decisive with age.
Children continue to accumulate historical experience through
constant study and practice, which in turn makes children rel-
atively likely to stand firm in their opinion when faced with
conflicting views, especially in an anonymous context
(Rebecca & Deborah, 2014). In fact, individuals' degree of
confidence is a strong predictor of whether they ultimately
revise their initial judgment (Minson & Mueller, 2012; Mor-
gan, Rendell, Ehn, Hoppitt, & Laland, 2011; See, Morrison,
Rothman, & Soll, 2011; Soll & Mannes, 2011).
In summary, we assume that children are more likely to
conform in a public context, whereas they will be less likely
to in an anonymous context. To test this hypothesis, we con-
ducted an experimental study in which children aged 9­15
years were asked to execute a modified Asch conformity task.
We measured participants' preestablished convictions in order
to help eliminate bias in our results. Previous studies on the
conformity of young children typically used the classical Asch
paradigm, with the index of conformity being whether chil-
dren's answer was consistent with the majority. However, that
paradigm does not account for the possibility that children
made the same answer as the unanimous majority indepen-
dently, without feeling pressured by other members of their
group. Thus, if the results of the preestablished convictions
measurement are incompatible with those of the formal task,
we then can say that the minority children submitted to group
pressure when giving their judgment publicly. In this experi-
ment, three participants were chosen as the size of the majority
in order to guarantee optimal results.
Material and Method
Participants
A total of 309 children were recruited through broadcasts and
flyers at a primary school from Grades 3­6 in Gansu Province.
Ultimately, 295 nine- to fifteen-year-old children participated
in the study with the consent of their guardians (14 children's
guardians did not provide informed consent). All children were
Han Chinese and had normal vision and were without color
blindness or mental illness. Furthermore, none was receiving
psychological treatment. Each of the participants received
US$10 in return for their participation in the experiment.

Modified Asch Paradigm
Our experiment used the modified Asch paradigm created by
Zhang, Deng, Yu, Zhao, and Liu (2016). First, participants
were given the following instructions: "Please determine
whether the pair of pictures shown on the left side of the screen
are uniform in size. Meanwhile, the decisions from the other
three students will appear on the right side of the screen; you
can either choose to ignore or refer to their answers. Please try
to make your own judgment. Press the Y button if you believe
that the two pictures are the same size. If not, please press the
N button. To continue the experiment, please press Q when you
are ready." Then, pictures and other participants' judgment
appeared after a 500-ms period, during which a fixation point
was displayed. Another 500 ms was given before the start of the
next trail. We prepared 12 pairs of pictures, 6 of which were
uniform in size. The conformity information was always unan-
imous and always incorrect (i.e., it showed "N" when the two
pictures were actually the same and "Y" when they were differ-
ent). Children completed 24 trials in total, which took about 10
min or so. We ran the experiment on a PC with a 19-in. display
(resolution: 1,440 Â 900, refresh rate ¼ 70 Hz) using E-prime
2.0 (Psychology Software Tools Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). The
screen background was black with white text for instructions.
All the pictures were presented in green, and participants were
about 60 cm from the display. The viewing angle was about 3.
Procedure
The entire experiment was approved by the ethics committee of
the psychology laboratory at Beijing Normal University. On the
first day of the experiment, participants were asked to indicate
whether each pair of pictures was uniform in size. The results of
this experiment were regarded as participants' preestablished
convictions. Over the next 2 days, participants completed the
Asch paradigm under public and anonymous conditions, respec-
tively. In the public condition, we told children that all partici-
pants' answers (including their own and those of the three other
students) would be shown to each other. By contrast, in the
anonymous condition, each participant was told that he or she
would be able to see the choice of the other three students but
that these students would not know the participant's final deci-
sion. Participants did not know the age or gender of the three
other students. To avoid sequence effects, we randomly divided
participants into two groups. The first group completed the pub-
lic condition on the second day and the anonymous condition on
the third day, while the second group completed the conditions
in reverse. All participants entered the 15-m2 laboratory, which
was appropriately lighted, alone and completed the preestab-
lished convictions test and Asch paradigm presented on a PC.
Results
Data Reduction
A total of 27 participants' data were excluded: 6 voluntarily left
during the experiment, 9 failed to complete the experiment
because of physical discomfort or a time conflict, and 12 had
error rates exceeding 2 standard deviations (SDs) in the Asch
task. Thus, the final data analysis included data from 268 valid
subjects (females: n ¼ 126, Mage
¼ 12.46, SD ¼ 1.32; males:
n ¼ 142, Mage
¼ 12.16, SD ¼ 1.51); participants' attrition rate
was 9.15%. Data were assessed using SPSS Statistics 19.0
(IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY).
Correlations Between Age and Conformity
All participants showed 100% correct answers on the preestab-
lished convictions test. Thus, if participants made the incorrect
judgment in the formal task, they would have shown confor-
mity to the unanimous majority. Therefore, we used the error
percentage in the Asch task as an indicator of conformity.
A higher error percentage would imply a greater tendency to
conform. We found that age was not significantly correlated to
conformity in the anonymous condition (i.e., anonymous
conformity; r ¼ À.003, p ¼ .966), but it was significantly
correlated in the public condition (i.e., public conformity;
r ¼ .230, p < .001). Furthermore, grade was significantly
correlated with age (r ¼ .704, p < .001) and public conformity
(r ¼ .141, p ¼ .021) but not with anonymous conformity (r ¼
.011, p ¼ .855). There is substantial evidence that females,
compared to males, are more likely to conform (Bond & Smith,
1996; Costanzo & Shaw, 1966). In our study, females did
indeed show greater conformity than males in the public con-
dition (females: M ¼ 0.52, SD ¼ 0.108; males: M ¼ 0.48, SD ¼
0.095, t ¼ À3.173, p ¼ .002); however, the difference in con-
formity between females and males was not significant in the
anonymous condition (females: M ¼ 0.50, SD ¼ 0.122; males:
M ¼ 0.51, SD ¼ 0.104, t ¼ 0.221, p ¼ 0.826). Therefore, we
defined gender as a dummy variable and conducted a hier-
archical multiple regression analysis to understand the spe-
cific relationship between age and conformity in the public
condition. The error percentage was set as the dependent vari-
able in this analysis. Gender and grade were included in the
first step of the regression equation and age in the second step.
The results indicated that age still positively predicted con-
formity in the public condition even after controlling for error
percentage and grade (see Table 1).
Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
Furthermore, we conducted a repeated measures ANOVA to
compare the mean differences between error percentages that
had been split across ages and conditions. The main effect of
condition was not significant, F(1, 261) < 1. The main effect of
age was significant, F(6, 261) ¼ 2.823, p ¼ .011, Z2 ¼ .061.
The error percentages increased with age (see Table 2). The
Condition Â Age interaction was critically significant, F(6,
261) ¼ 1.894, p ¼ .082, Z2 ¼ .042. Simple contrast analyses
revealed that the error percentages increased with age in public
condition, F(6, 261) ¼ 3.507, p ¼ .002, Z2 ¼ .075 (see Table
2), while the same was not significant in anonymous condition,
F(6, 261) ¼ 1.596, p ¼ .148, Z2 ¼ .035.

Discussion
We used a modified Asch paradigm to investigate the devel-
opment of conformity behaviors under public and anonymous
conditions using 268 nine- to fifteen-year-old children. We
found that children' conformity behaviors were relatively sta-
ble with age in the anonymous condition. However, children
showed greater conformity with age when they had to make a
decision in public. We measured participants' preestablished
convictions to ensure that the results were more valid; in other
words, it ensured that children's conformity behaviors in the
Asch task were actually due to the effect of the unanimous
majority rather than random choices.
It is not difficult to understand why children would sub-
mit to the unanimous majority. Early studies by Asch (1956)
and Deutsch and Gerard (1955) argued that conformity
behaviors are, in most cases, adaptive. Indeed, the theory
of cultural evolution explains that conformity behaviors pro-
mote in-group consistency and help individuals acquire
appropriate behavioral norms (Henrich & Henrich, 2007).
Children, as a vulnerable group in society, tend to lack
adaptive conventional knowledge and thus are perhaps able
to account for their weaknesses through conformity. There-
fore, they conformed to majority in both public and anon-
ymous conditions.
We found that children showed a greater tendency to con-
form with age in the public condition, which is consistent with
our assumptions. Previous studies have shown that, with age,
children become more adept at adjusting their degree of con-
formity according to the privacy of their response (Haun &
Tomasello, 2011). When making decisions in public, the older
they were, the more children would submit to others' opinion,
even if they knew the others' opinion was wrong. Similarly,
there is evidence that children manage others' evaluations of
their own public images at the age of eight onward, as part of
seeking group acceptance and a more positive self-concept
(Cialdini & Goldstein, 2004). These studies all revealed that,
as age increases, children become increasingly concerned with
others' opinions. Accordingly, they show greater conformity in
public. Our results also support these conclusions.
We found no significant differences in children's confor-
mity tendency across ages in the anonymous condition, which
is not consistent with our assumptions. Previous research found
that older children possess more advanced cognitive abilities,
are more confident, and are less reliant on social information
when compared to younger children, especially when they
would not have to worry about pressure from the majority
(Rebecca & Deborah, 2014). This means children would show
less conformity in the anonymous condition with age. How-
ever, we found that children's conformity tendency changed
little in the anonymous condition across ages. This implied that
9- to 15-year-olds have developed relatively stable conformity
tendency. Previous experience has taught them that it is useful
to be in line with the majority, even though they know their
choices will not be seen by others. Moreover, this evolved
behavioral strategy was free from specific environmental influ-
ences. Another possible reason for this is that our pattern judg-
ment task is too simple for children aged 9­15. Preestablished
convictions test showed that children of different ages may
have the same degree of confidence in their judgments. How-
ever, the distinction between younger and older children in
conformity is only evident when the experimental task has a
certain degree of difficulty (Hanayama & Mori, 2011). In addi-
tion, females show more conformity to the unanimous majority
than males when making decisions publicly but not when they
are made anonymously, and this pattern has been observed in
previous studies (Lee, 2006). Researchers believe that females
are usually expected to be gentle and submissive, and females
tend to behave more in conformity with expectations (Cross,
Brown, Morgan, & Laland, 2017).
Our research has some limitations. First, previous research
has shown that children are highly sensitive to social informa-
tion (Fusaro & Harris, 2008). It is possible that, because the
unanimous majority's judgments in our task were always
wrong, children engaged in speculation about the purpose of
the trial. Additionally, their conformity behaviors might have
been affected by their repetitive encountering of information
that is inconsistent with their preestablished convictions.
Future research might seek a better balance (half vs. half)
between consistent and inconsistent tasks. Second, Corriveau
and Harris (2010) pointed out that being from a collectivist
culture (e.g., China) influences the results of conformity
experiments; in particular, when using the Asch paradigm,
children from such cultures are more likely to conform to the
majority. This is because they are more concerned with social
expectations. Future research should explore the cross-cultural

consistency in the development of children's conformity beha-
viors when making public decisions. Finally, while previous
literature has suggested that children's conformity behavior is
adaptive, we did not directly investigate children's motivations
in this study. Any number of motivations might compel indi-
viduals to conform, and it would be necessary to understand
these motivations in order to fully understand the development
of children's conformity behaviors. Future research should
indeed examine the perspective of motivation.
Despite these limitations, we believe our findings are mean-
ingful. When in a public situation, children become increas-
ingly likely to conform to others' opinions as they age even in
the event of the other individual's opinions being wrong, while
their conformity behaviors remain relatively stable in anon-
ymous situations. This finding emphasizes the impact of group
stress on children. It is adaptive to learn how to better get along
with the group as early as possible. Humans have evolved a
series of behavioral strategies, such as conformity, to benefit
from groups through long-term social life and culture. Older
children seem to be better than younger children at maintaining
their image in front of a group through conformity, because
they show more conformity in a public choice. This tendency
ensures that children engage in smooth socialization. Our
research supports the theory of cultural evolution and provides
some clues on how conformity behaviors develop.
