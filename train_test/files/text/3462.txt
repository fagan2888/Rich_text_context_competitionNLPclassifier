For the first 70 years of the post­Civil War United States,
prohibition reemerged as a mainstream topic that interested
people in every region of the country. The movement toward
national prohibition was preceded by state and local efforts
to shut down the traffic, sale, and consumption of intoxicat-
ing beverages. Given the intensity of feelings and the scope
of activity, the abolition of alcohol became the political issue
that trumped all others for a large number of committed
citizens.
Prohibition also gained particular popularity among polit-
ically active women. Many had played key roles in abolition-
ist organizations (e.g., Jeffrey, 1998; Robertson, 2010) and
early temperance groups (e.g., Dannenbaum, 1981; Tyrrell,
1982), and others had been involved with benevolent societ-
ies of various types (e.g., Boylan, 1990; Ryan, 1979). With
the abolition of slavery, many women turned to addressing
other ills in society that required correction, and they soon
sought to heal the country and the family by advocating for
public policies that promoted a "sober and pure world." It is
not without reason, then, that the largest women's organiza-
tion up to that time, the Woman's Christian Temperance
Union (WCTU), formed around the topic.
Established in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1874, the group's mis-
sion was to "protect the home"--and by extension, create
greater personal and financial security for U.S. families--
through the prohibition of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs.
Early leaders, including Annie Wittenmyer, Mary Johnson,
Mary Ingram, and Frances Willard (whose name is most fre-
quently associated with the group), viewed the group's cause
as part of an attempt to exercise political voice, even without
the franchise. Prohibition was a logical policy goal for
women of this era, who were largely restricted to the private
sphere, and were, thus, particularly susceptible to the social
costs of alcohol abuse. In addition, it was considered
unseemly for women of the era to spend much time in tav-
erns and saloons, where much political business was con-
ducted. As a result, few issues important to women and
family--including education, child custody, and divorce--
typically received the attention of political leaders of the day.
The cause of prohibition, thus, became a way for women to
bring indirect and direct attention to these issues.
The WCTU grew rapidly in membership and status, even-
tually becoming the largest women's organization in the
world. In the decade after its founding, it became organized

The Connection Between the Woman's
Christian Temperance Union and the
Prohibition Party
Adam Chamberlain1, Alixandra B. Yanus2, and Nicholas Pyeatt3
Abstract
Scholars have long been interested in the complementary relationships forged by membership groups and political parties.
The post-bellum period presents an opportunity to consider these connections using a case study of two groups concerned
with the ills of alcohol, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) and the Prohibition Party. Our analysis of
presidential elections from 1876 to 1900 reveals that--although women were disenfranchised at the time--the WCTU's
organization and infrastructure was essential to early Prohibition Party success. In 1884, the first election after the two
created a formal alliance in 1882, the strength of the WCTU helped the party grow its voter base. However, the two slowly
diverged over how to achieve prohibition, and this relationship dissipated; there is little evidence of any significant connection
between the groups after 1884. This supports the proposition that a shared means of accomplishing goals is an essential
element of an effective group­party partnership.

in the vast majority of states and territories, and worked
assiduously at the local, state, national, and even interna-
tional levels to fight against the consumption of alcohol and
the various social problems it created. Under Willard's lead-
ership, which lasted from 1879 to 1898, the group's agenda
also expanded to include other issues, such as immigration,
suffrage, and workplace safety.
Of course, temperance and prohibition in the post-bellum
era were not causes solely supported by women. Prior to the
formation of the WCTU, a few committed male prohibition-
ists led by John Russell formed the Prohibition Party in 1869;
its ultimate goal was a constitutional ban on the production,
consumption, importation, and trade of alcohol. As one
national Prohibition Party platform noted, alcohol was
now so threatening the perpetuity of all our social and political
institutions, that the suppression of the same by a national party,
organized therefor [sic], is the greatest object to be accomplished
by the voters of our country; it is of such importance that it, of
right, ought to control the political action of all our patriotic
citizens, until such suppression is accomplished. (Prohibition
Party, 1896, p. 106)
Whether to work alongside the Prohibition Party or whether
to work through other channels led to serious debates within
the WCTU.As president of the WCTU, Frances Willard advo-
cated working alongside the party. She spoke at Prohibition
Party conventions, and later, other members of the WCTU
also served as delegates to these meetings. Still, opposition
existed between those wanting less emphasis placed on parti-
san, electoral approaches to prohibition and those who desired
a close connection with this minor party. These conflicting
viewpoints lead us to ask an important question: Is there a con-
nection between WCTU membership and the performance of
the Prohibition Party at the ballot box?
It is worthwhile to explore this question for several rea-
sons. First, the two organizations began within 5 years of one
another, and their growth in support in the 1880s paralleled
each other. Yet, to date, scholars have not quantitatively
assessed the nature of the WCTU­Prohibition Party relation-
ship. Second, and as an extension of the previous point,
exploring this question allows us to speak to recent scholar-
ship theorizing that political parties are not solely creations
of politicians, but instead are the creations of various orga-
nized interests banding together (Bawn et al., 2012). A mem-
bership organization such as the WCTU, then, could play an
essential role in a party's development. Finally, it is also
interesting to examine whether and how a female-only orga-
nization, prior to woman suffrage, could have significantly
influenced the trajectory of a male-dominated political party,
even if a third party.
To study these questions, we focus on the connection
between the strength of state WCTU membership and
Prohibition Party voting in the late 1800s. Using WCTU
dues, weighted by a state's population, as a measure of group
strength, we find a relationship between the group and
Prohibition Party presidential voting in 1884, 2 years after
the organizations formed an official alliance. This evidence
shows that a women's organization influenced electoral poli-
tics prior to widespread voting rights for women. However,
as the Prohibitionists sought to modernize their political
organization by relying less on female activists, and as the
WCTU responded by becoming less interested in working
within a minor party, this effect quickly disappeared. These
findings underscore women's political capacity during the
pre-suffrage era while also revealing that shared strategies
for achieving policy goals, and not necessarily the alignment
of goals, are the critical component in maintaining a mem-
bership group­political party connection.
The WCTU­Prohibition Connection
As mentioned in the introduction, the two organizations
formed after the Civil War, the Prohibition Party in 1869 and
the WCTU in 1874. But, it was more than just temporal prox-
imity and mission that kept these two organizations in close
alignment. In Pathways to Prohibition, Szymanski (2003b)
notes that these two "radical" organizations found their early
leadership in the more secretive International Order of the
Good Templars, a temperance organization formed during
the antebellum period (pp. 28, 36-42). Structured much like
the Masons, the Good Templars allowed participation by
both men and women.
With origins in the antebellum temperance movement,
which was especially popular in the North among religious,
native-born individuals, and sharing a similar goal of consti-
tutional prohibition, these two groups began by attracting
former Republicans and women who had favored that party.
Pre-war abolitionists also saw this as an opportunity to cure
society of yet another ill, and this group of experienced polit-
ical activists included both men and women. For example,
Gerrit Smith, the New York abolitionist who had helped to
form the Liberty Party, and had been active in the pre-war
temperance movement, was part of the effort to create the
Prohibition Party. Likewise, longtime WCTU President
Frances Willard was raised in a staunchly Republican, aboli-
tionist1 family; she even attended President Garfield's inau-
guration in 1881 and went to the White House to present,
from theWCTU, a portrait of Lucy Hayes, wife of Republican
President Rutherford B. Hayes and a temperance woman
herself (Bordin, 1986). Overall, then, the origins of these two
organizations, as well as their ideological and policy inclina-
tions, aligned well with one another.
This said, the WCTU was, at first, non-partisan, and
especially so under the leadership of President Annie
Wittenmyer (Andersen, 2011). Even when Frances Willard
became president in 1879, the organization remained osten-
sibly non-partisan, though most WCTU women were likely
sympathetic to the Republicans. Yet, after meeting with men
from various temperance organizations and the Prohibition
Chamberlain et al. 3
Party, Willard decided to push for a closer relationship with
the third party (Bordin, 1986). In her 1882 presidential
address, she noted that "[w]e should not consider our own
interests to the exclusion of the interests represented by this
independent movement" (Woman's Christian Temperance
Union, 1882: lxxxv), in part because the Prohibition Party
had recently espoused woman suffrage at its previous con-
vention. In fact, the party reorganized itself in 1882 as the
"Prohibition Home Protection Party," which, according to
Andersen (2011), "combined it with the WCTU and the hun-
dreds of thousands of members this organization had
amassed since its beginnings" (p. 148). Andersen argues--
although she does not empirically demonstrate the point--
that this alliance "mapped partisanship--the predominant
form of political organization in nineteenth-century
America--onto the numbers, structures, and leadership of
the WCTU" (p. 148).
In the wake of this change, though, Willard remained
open to state auxiliaries working with major parties, noting
". . . we have not been slow to applaud the loyalty of any
party to Prohibition, gratefully recognizing the action of
Republicans in Iowa and Democrats in Arkansas" (Woman's
Christian Temperance Union, 1883, p. 49; italics in original).
But, by the 1884 convention, just prior to the presidential
election, Willard's endorsement of the national Prohibition
Party's efforts was firmer and clearer. As she stated concern-
ing the Republicans and Democrats, "Existing parties can
not [sic], in the very nature of the case, take up this question
[of national, constitutional prohibition]. Not to this end were
they born; not for this cause did they come into the world"
(Woman's Christian Temperance Union, 1884, p. 69).
Although there was some opposition to this alliance, the vote
concerning the proposed WCTU resolutions of 1884, which
included a plank endorsing the Prohibition Party, passed with
a convention vote of 188 in favor (79.7%) and 48 against
(20.3%; Woman's Christian Temperance Union, 1884).
Although most delegates accepted the results of the vote, the
scars were still fresh for those who had opposed the arrange-
ment, especially the Iowa WCTU (see Kleppner, 1979, for
details on parties and prohibition in Iowa). In fact, this group,
along with a few other wayward delegates, seceded from the
main WCTU in 1889 to form a truly non-partisan WCTU.
Putting aside this minority, the WCTU­Prohibition con-
nection, formed under Willard's leadership, went beyond
merely informal support; it became a symbiotic relationship.
The Prohibition Party did not create formal party structures
and did not keep track of membership dues, but instead relied
on members from the WCTU, the Good Templars, and a
smaller organization, the Sons of Temperance, to run their
campaigns. And, though the Good Templars were larger in
terms of membership in the 1870s and 1880s than the WCTU,
the WCTU was a growing organization while the Good
Templars were on the decline (see Szymanski, 2003b). This
explains why Lisa Andersen's (2011) work on the
Prohibitionist­WCTU relationship argues that the new minor
party "depended on women workers and women leaders to
help their fledgling party meet the demands of a competitive
party system" (p. 137). This also explains why the Prohibition
Party allowed female participation at its meetings and
endorsed suffrage. The party needed to develop an organiza-
tion that could attract support from election to election, and
prior to the WCTU­Prohibition alliance, its "leaders were
looked upon as good political philosophers, but not practical
political party builders" (Colvin, 1926, p. 131). The women
of the WCTU, who, like their brethren in the woman suffrage
movement, had developed a strong nationwide network of
state and local affiliates, were good at such organizing.
But from the perspective of WCTU leadership, partisan
activities were just one component of a broader strategy to
"agitate- educate- and legislate" for change. In 1884, Willard
stated that, "One candidate who incarnates our principles is of
more political value to our cause than ten thousand signatures
to a petition. But great petitions are great educators of the peo-
ple, and have always been followed by new party alignments"
(Minutes, 1884, p. 70). Thus, though the group's efforts were
partisan minded, they still retained a reform-minded approach
to solving society's problems. The working class could be
improved, and middle-class values imparted to them, first and
foremost by accepting temperance, which would create a cas-
cading effect of positive changes to individuals and society at
large (Gusfield, 1955). Accordingly, the group used a variety
of tactics, from expanding temperance education in public
schools (see Mezvinsky, 1961; Zimmerman, 1992) to holding
meetings in railroad and mining camps, to achieve social
change and working alongside the woman suffrage move-
ment. Engagement in these various reform activities meant
that female activists were developing political capital; likely,
many women were attracted to the group because of these
social and purposive benefits (Salisbury, 1969). In turn, per-
haps by chance, the WCTU's political empowerment of
women, coupled with Willard's election and direction, aided
the cause of the Prohibition Party, too.
However, the Prohibition Party began to move away from
the WCTU in the mid-1880s. According to Andersen (2011),
the 1884 presidential election signaled to many male
Prohibitionists that changes were needed to increase support.
To mimic the major parties' organization and outreach, the
role of women would have to decline and the party would
need to moderate on woman suffrage, which turned off many
women to the organization. Conceivably, this would allow
the party to attract more Southern support, though prohibi-
tionists in this region seemed more accepting of local efforts
to stop the sale and manufacture of alcohol, not constitu-
tional prohibition. Furthermore, debates about whether the
party should be focused solely on prohibition or embrace a
broader agenda created a divide that led the party to split in
1896 between "narrow" and "broad" gauge platforms.
Neither put an official suffrage plank in their platforms,
which "tended to bring on a coldness in the attitude of some
of the women toward the Party" (Colvin, 1926, p. 289). Due

to this, and because the party was not successful at getting
potential office seekers elected, "the [Prohibition] Party
relied upon moral force and amateurism and became increas-
ingly anachronistic in twentieth-century politics" (Blocker,
1979, p. 154). Overall, it was deemed necessary to downplay
women's issues and roles in the party to "professionalize"
and appeal to Southerners. This moved the Prohibition Party
away from its radical antebellum roots, with connections to
women's activism, in an attempt to become nationally
relevant.
Of course, it was not a one-way street, as the WCTU
moved away from the Prohibition Party, too. Although
Willard stuck by the Prohibitionists into the early 1890s, a
few factors weakened the relationship between the two. First,
the secession of the Iowa delegation and its allies signaled
that there was dissent over the organization's connection to
politics. Second, Willard attempted to bring the various
reforms movements, including the Populists, together under
one ticket for the 1892 presidential election. This failed, in
large part because Prohibitionists she was working with felt
the attempt involved compromising on prohibition and
woman suffrage, and Populists were often unwilling to
accept these planks (Bordin, 1986). Third, although she
remained the leader of the national WCTU, Willard's physi-
cal departure for Europe seems to have weakened the bond
other members had with the Prohibition Party (Bordin,
1986). Finally, upon her death in 1898, Willard's heir to the
presidency, Lillian M. N. Stevens, oversaw the moderation
of the group, appealing more directly to the South and its
local (but not constitutional) means of restricting alcohol
(Szymanski, 2003a).Although likely due, in part, to the rapid
expansion of theAnti-Saloon League throughout the country,
Stevens' actions reflected a moderation that was not as
accepted in Willard's time (but see Ivy, 1998, on Willard's
attempts to build the WCTU in the South).
In addition, changes in ballot laws accelerated this sup-
posed disconnect. The success of the Populist or People's
Party created concerns, generally among Republicans, over
Populists' ability to fuse ballots with Democrats. After
Republican-led state governments again rose to prominence
throughout the North, efforts were made to place ballots
under government control (Argersinger, 1980; Ware, 2000);
in the South, Democrats reacted to the Populists' success by
attempting to eliminate the competition (Hirano & Snyder,
2007). Southern state governments implemented signature
requirements as barriers to ballot access, hurting not only the
Populists (who were also affected by bans on "fusing" party
tickets) but also the Prohibitionists. Women were especially
marginalized by this reform, as the laws often required signa-
tures from voters, and woman suffrage was quite limited at
this time (Andersen, 2011). Thus, without the ability to con-
struct and distribute ballots and without the guarantee of a
place on the ballot, the Prohibition Party's success waned
(Andersen, 2012). Although the party got close to winning
2% of the popular vote in the non-competitive presidential
election of 1904, it never again matched the success of ear-
lier nationwide campaigns.
Despite these divergent paths, in the early stages of both
organizations, the connection between them was supposedly
quite strong. Scholars, such as those cited in this piece (see,
for example, Andersen, 2011; Bordin, 1986; Szymanski,
2003b), have documented the relationship using anecdotal
and qualitative evidence. However, research has not statisti-
cally illustrated the nature of this relationship. An empirical
investigation of the ties between these two groups will help
us to better understand the nature and extent of the connec-
tion between pressure groups and political parties. It is, after
all, one thing to say that the organizations worked together
on the campaign trail, but if this support did not translate into
votes, it ultimately had little immediate effect on the compo-
sition of government. An empirical illustration of this rela-
tionship also allows us to better quantify the impact that
disenfranchised women had on the political process in the
late 19th century.
Data
We consider the relationship between state-level WCTU
membership and state-level voting for the Prohibition Party
during the presidential elections of 1876, 1880, 1884, 1888,
1892, 1896, and 1900. These elections cover the supposed
rise and fall of the relationship between the two organiza-
tions, and allow us to consider the changing nature of these
connections over time and as a result of conscious shifts in
group strategy.
To measure WCTU membership, we rely on data pre-
sented in the Minutes of the National Woman's Christian
Temperance Union (1874-1894) and the Report of the
National Woman's Christian Temperance Union (1895-
1900). Specifically, yearly data were gathered on the amount
of dues given to the national union by the state unions, which
was based on the size of the state unions. Because these
amounts vary quite a bit, in part due to state populations,
these dues are adjusted, per 10,000 in a state's population, for
1880 (for 1876, 1880, and 1884 dues), 1890 (for 1888 and
1892 dues), and 1900 (for 1896 and 1900 dues).
States without recorded dues in a given year are included
in the analysis, because the absence of dues signifies the
inability of the WCTU to establish active and effective orga-
nizations. However, this poses a serious problem for 1876
and 1880. In these years, WCTU presence in the South was
almost non-existent; no Southern states, further, recorded
Prohibition votes for president in either year. In 1876, more-
over, only 10 non-Southern states recorded Prohibition votes;
16 did not. But, 21 states had active, dues-paying WCTUs,
compared with five that did not. Furthermore, two states
recorded Prohibition voting without WCTU organizations,
and, critically, 13 states had WCTU organizations without
Prohibition voting. Similarly, in 1880, seven of the 27 states
outside the South had no dues-paying WCTU, 11 of the
Chamberlain et al. 5
states had no Prohibition voting, and 13 of the 27 states
(almost half) had either no evidence of the organizations
(five), WCTU formation but no Prohibition Party (six), or
Prohibition voting with no WCTU (two). We, therefore,
begin our multivariate analyses in 1884, when both the
WCTU and Prohibition Party had more completely devel-
oped national infrastructures and were typically active in
every state of the union.2
To measure Prohibition Party support in the electorate, we
collect vote percentages for the Prohibition Party from Leip's
(2012) U.S. Election Atlas. Some scholars might question
whether other indicators of Prohibition Party strength are
available or might be more appropriate. As noted earlier,
however, the party supposedly maintained itself on the backs
of organizations such as the WCTU; it did not keep its own
records of local and state affiliates (see Szymanski, 2003b).
Therefore, vote percentages are the best, and perhaps the
only, reliable measure of the Prohibition Party's support in a
state.
Results
The simplest, yet most effective, means of looking at the
connection between Prohibition Party presidential voting in
a state and the WCTU dues per population in a state is
through correlations. This is displayed in Table 1 by using
the amount of state dues, adjusted for population; for refer-
ence, the Prohibition Party's percentage of the presidential
vote in each year is included, too.
A clear pattern emerges. The relationship was strongest in
the early 1880s, which corresponds to the growing partner-
ship between the party and group, culminating in their for-
mal compact of 1884. This weakens somewhat in 1888 and
1892, which is consistent with previous research suggesting
that the two organizations began to diverge during this era.
This foreshadows the WCTU's movement away from the
Prohibition Party in the mid- to late-1890s, evidenced by the
weak correlations evident in 1896 and 1900. In sum, these
correlations generally confirm what prior qualitative research
has suggested.
However, we also know that the WCTU and Prohibition
Party proclaimed that they were above regional politics, and
both groups were interested in building a national alliance
during the post-bellum era. Even so, it has been noted that
Southern support for both organizations was weak early on,
and efforts did not truly gain traction in the region until after
the separation of the WCTU­Prohibition Party alliance. It is
possible, then, that region might affect the correlations noted
above.
To test the accuracy of this claim, ordinary least squares
regression models are used to predict Prohibition Party presi-
dential voting as a function of WCTU strength and whether a
state is Southern or non-Southern. The results from 1884 to
1900 are provided in Table 2. After adjusting for regional-
ism, the relationship between WCTU and Prohibition Party
support tends to be weaker than suggested solely by correla-
tions. In the 1884 election, which saw the formal alliance
between the two lead to the "Prohibition Home Protection
Party," dues weighted according to a state's population are
significant. However, 1884 is the only year where this is the
case. This said, the South dummy variable is negative and
significant in 1884, 1888, and 1892, suggesting that support
for both organizations was weak in the region. Additional
models, with controls for other third-party voting, the margin
of victory between the top two presidential candidates in a
state, and Prohibition Party voting in the previous presiden-
tial election, confirm the more parsimonious presentation of
results provided here. (See the supplementary appendix for
these models and related figures.)
By 1896 and 1900, the regional divide is no longer a sig-
nificant explanatory variable of Prohibition voting, though
neither are WCTU dues. The Prohibition strategy of appeal-
ing to the South, then, seems to have met with at least a mod-
icum of success. The highest percentage of the vote for the
"narrow gauge" platform in 1896, which carried forth under
the traditional Prohibition Party banner, was in Georgia,
when Joshua Levering, a Southern Baptist leader, was the
presidential candidate. Likewise, in 1900, the largest vote
percentage for the Prohibitionists came in Florida. Neither
was a state where the WCTU claimed much support.3
These results, then, clearly speak to earlier scholars'
contentions about the reliance of the political party on the
women's organization. The WCTU­Prohibition connection
forged in 1882 appears to have helped the Prohibition Party
in the North (and hence, throughout the country) in the 1884
presidential election, but the tumultuous battles within the
party after that year, which culminated with separate cam-
paigns in 1896 for the two distinct factions, subsequently
weakened the relationship between the two entities.
Furthermore, the organizations' reforms that began in the
mid- to late-1880s moved the groups in opposite directions.

As the WCTU took steps that slowly moved it away from the
party and toward other issue areas, the Prohibition Party
became more focused on building a national party with a
stronger base of support in the South (though Prohibition
voting remained much weaker there than it was outside the
region). In many ways, the goals were at cross purposes, and
drove a wedge between the groups, eroding the symbiotic
relationship that once existed. The regional division both
wanted to downplay was, in fact, a key component in the
disintegration of their formal relationship.
Considering both organizations grew out of the Northern
abolitionist impulse after the Civil War, this case reveals how
shared policy goals can be at odds with political expediency.
The mainstreaming and moderation of two similar-minded
groups required separation as one (the WCTU) grew to
prominence and the other (the Prohibition Party) struggled
before withering into obscurity. Even if the connection was
not as strong as it was in 1884, there was still some connec-
tion between the two throughout the period, as their shared
missions aligned. But, once the third-party supporters
attempted to mainstream the organization, which required
separating from its radical Northern past and other social and
political reforms, including woman suffrage, the WCTU
moved its growing support away from the party. Thus, there
was no strong, significant connection between the two orga-
nizations once their strategies for achieving their shared
goals diverged.
Conclusion
The results presented above provide quantitative evidence
for the rise and fall of an electoral connection between the
activities of the WCTU and the Prohibition Party, thus reaf-
firming the historical, qualitative claims of Andersen (2011)
and Szymanski (2003b). Our results specifically affirm the
historical narrative of growing links around the 1884 elec-
tion, followed by a declining connection thereafter. Much of
this owes to regional divisions between the two groups, as
well as varying strategies for achieving their shared goals.
The present research also adds to our scholarly under-
standing of party development, especially the recent theory
that political parties form from the efforts of interest organi-
zations (Bawn et al., 2012). Our findings underscore that this
symbiotic relationship is highly dependent on the demands
and resources of the group's and party's adherents and stan-
dard bearers. In other words, shared emphasis on one policy
position, or a series of related positions, is not enough to
bring parties and interest groups together; there must be
greater consistency in goals and activist strategies. In this
case, Prohibition Party candidates, looking to win election to
office, openly advocated for change--including moving
away from the call for woman suffrage--to align themselves
with major-party organizations. This decision allowed candi-
dates to assert some role in the development of the party (see,
for example, Aldrich, 1995), but moved the Prohibition Party
away from the WCTU, whose already skeptical adherents
had doubts about the party's general repositioning.
Furthermore, the attempts by the two organizations to appeal
to Southern voters, for the Prohibitionists, and Southern
women, for the WCTU, led them to pursue different strate-
gies, too.
These results also reveal that shared policy goals did not
unite the two organizations so much as the shared means of
achieving those goals. As powerful as the WCTU became,
and as influential as it was in volunteer and lobbying pro-
grams, its leaders realized that the best strategy involved dis-
tancing themselves from radical minor-party politics once
the Prohibitionists began to "professionalize" and eschew
female assistance. However, when the organizations' means
of achieving goals aligned, the relationship worked. This
suggests that membership groups, seen by many as the back-
bone of political parties (Bawn et al., 2012), are not wedded
to electoral politics once they participate in such politics;
instead, it appears to be a fluid system, whereby a powerful
membership organization can move from aiding a party back
to pressure politics, and build even more political clout. So
taken together, parties and interest groups may couple and
decouple, even with a common policy goal such as prohibi-
tion, if there is a disagreement over the strategies taken to
achieve that goal.
Finally, this analysis illustrates women's influence in the
political system prior to enfranchisement. First, like other
studies of the role of women in the abolition movement (e.g.,
Jeffrey, 1998), it provides clear evidence that disadvantaged
groups can wield power in the electoral arena, even without
the right to vote. Contrary to the assumption that women

played little role in electoral politics prior to becoming
enfranchised, what women lacked in such power, they often
made up for in organizational skill, social networking, and
political activism. Thus, as this analysis of the Prohibition
Party and WCTU illustrates, a male-driven political party did
benefit from the backing of a women's organization. In this
case, the Prohibition Party's national vote for president saw
its largest percentage increase between 1880 and 1884 (from
0.11% in the former to 1.5% in the latter), when the alliance
made between the two organizations, in 1882, was at its
strongest.
Second, and as an extension, this analysis shows that the
prospects of a party, albeit a minor party, were directly
affected by the growth, and eventual turn in orientation, of a
powerful women's organization. The federated nature of the
WCTU allowed women to pursue different agendas in their
states and localities; when major parties fed into this, the
Prohibition Party was, thus, weakened. And, although
the national WCTU would, at least in words, support the
Prohibition Party's cause at the federal level, even as the lat-
ter sought to limit women's participation in the party, it never
specified how state unions should operate. It understood that
state unions needed to be independent of the Prohibition
Party to be successful in state and local politics. As such, the
WCTU showed itself to be more politically adept than its
male-dominated, electoral counterpart.
This, then, raises questions about the relationship between
the WCTU and the Prohibition Party that demand attention
in the future. In what ways did state organizations formalize
(or not formalize) the relationships between these groups,
and how did that translate into candidate support? Did this
connection between the two organizations lead to more pol-
icy gains or create hurdles to policy making? Is the WCTU's
experience in the electoral realm that much different than
that of the first "true" interest group, the Anti-Saloon League
(see Clemens, 1997)? Studying these simple, straightforward
extensions of the findings presented here can potentially help
a range of scholars better evaluate this historical era while
utilizing it as a testing ground for other theories related to
political organizations and social movements.

Notes
1. Many women's rights activists in the post-bellum era had been
trained and socialized in the abolition movement. In fact, first
wave feminism and the Seneca Falls Convention have their
roots in the treatment of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia
Mott at the World Anti-Slavery Society meeting in London in
1840. It was, thus, one of the great betrayals of these early
women's rights activists that the Civil War Amendments to the
U.S. Constitution neither included explicit legal protections
on the basis of gender nor extended the franchise to women.
Frederick Douglass famously remarked to Stanton at the time
that, "Now is the Negro's hour."
2. It should be noted that regressions on the non-South only in
1876 and 1880, with dues not weighted by population, find
a significant connection between prohibition voting and
Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) strength
at the p < .05 level; weighted dues, by population, were not
significant. But, given the number of states where WCTU
presence and Prohibition voting both occurred (well below
20 cases in both years), the results for the unweighted dues
are largely the product of both organizations forming in the
same states where prohibition was popular. In addition, Ohio,
where the WCTU had its strongest support from the Women's
Temperance Crusade, was an outlier in 1876; removing it
made the unweighted dues predictor not significant at the p <
.05 level. Finally, the vote percentages are so low for the party
that making an empirical case for a connection seems suspect
(means of .06 and .09 in the North, respectively, with maxi-
mums of .31 and .36).
3. Although these states are each outliers for their respec-
tive election, it is imperative to include them in the models
because they are clear examples of the party's strategy dur-
ing that period. Nevertheless, excluding those two cases
increases the correlations between voting and dues per popula-
tion to .40 and .45, respectively, with a significant, positive
effect of WCTU dues per population on vote percentages in
1896 (though the magnitude is not nearly as great as in 1884).
However, including controls for previous Prohibition voting,
the vote percentage margin between the top two candidates,
and other third-party voting, eliminates the significance of this
effect; these controls do not do this, of course, in 1884 (see
Supplementary Appendix Table A5 for these additional mod-
els). Likewise, models excluding all Southern states reveal no
statistically significant relationship between dues and voting.
