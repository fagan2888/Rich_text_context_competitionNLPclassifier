Abstract
Objective: Infection is a common condition in patients with nephrotic syndrome. The objective of
the present study is to investigate the clinical characteristics and risk factors of infections in adult
patients with primary nephrotic syndrome (PNS).
Methods: Medical charts of 138 consecutive patients with PNS and infections who were admitted
to hospital from April 2013 to April 2016 were systematically reviewed.
Results: Patients were divided into three groups according to the degree of infections: mild
infection group (n ¼ 45), moderate infection group (n ¼ 60), and severe infection group (n ¼ 33). In
the severe infection group, most patients (96.9%) had pulmonary infections with opportunistic
pathogens. There were significant differences in cumulative prednisone dose, immunosuppressor
use, and CD4þ T cell count among the three groups. A lower CD4þ T cell count (<300 cells/
mm3) (odds ratio ¼ 4.25 [95% confidence interval 1.680­10.98]) and higher cumulative dose of
prednisone (odds ratio ¼ 1.38 [95% confidence interval 1.05­3.26]) were risk factors for severe
infections in adult patients with PNS.
Conclusions: CD4þ T cell count (<300 cells/mm3) and a higher cumulative dose of prednisone
are important risk factors for severe infections in adult patients with PNS.

Introduction
Infection is an important cause of morbidity
and mortality in glucocorticoid-treated
patients because of its immunosuppressive
effects.1,2 Many reports have estimated the
clinical characteristics or risk factors of
infections in kidney transplant recipients
and those with rheumatic diseases.3­6
However, little is known regarding this
issue in patients with nephrotic syndrome
(NS), especially adult patients with primary
nephrotic syndrome (PNS).
Patients with NS have defective cell-
mediated immunity.7­9 Additionally, steroid
or immunosuppressive therapy in patients
with NS causes immunological dysfunction,
which leads to increased susceptibility to
infections.10,11 Episodes of NS complicated
by major infections usually require admission
for aggressive treatment and affect patients'
outcomes.12­14 The present study was con-
ducted to investigate the clinical characteris-
tics and risk factors of severe infections in
hospitalized adult patients with PNS.
Patients and methods
We retrospectively reviewed the inpatient
medical records of patients with PNS who
were complicated by infections and admitted
to our hospital (First Affiliated Hospital of
Wenzhou Medical University) from April
2013 to April 2016. All of the patients had
electronic charts and the diagnosis codes
were used.
PNS was defined as the presence of heavy
proteinuria (>3.5 g/d) and hypoalbuminemia
(<3.0 g/dL). Patients with lupus nephritis,
allergic purpura nephritis, diabetic nephro-
pathy, nephropathy of amyloidosis, and
myeloma nephropathy were excluded.
Patients were designated as having infectious
complications if there were microbio-
logically or clinically documented infections
confirmed by infectious disease special-
ists or nephrologists. Microbiologically-
documented infections were defined as signs
or symptoms of infection with an organism
that was isolated by specimen culture (e.g.,
blood, urine, sputum, cerebrospinal fluid,
and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid), antigen
testing from blood, or histological material
from a definite site of infection. Clinically
documented infections were defined as fever
accompanied by appropriate clinical find-
ings, such as pulmonary infiltrates or inflam-
mation of the skin or soft tissue.
The severity of infections was classified
according to previous studies as severe,
moderate, and mild. Severe infections
included severe signs and symptoms, such
as high fever (>39C), breathing difficulty
and confusion, unstable vital signs, and
infections requiring intravenous antibiotics.
Moderate infections included moderate
signs and symptoms, such as moderate
fever (>38C), cough, yellow sputum, and
crackles, stable vital signs, and infections
requiring intravenous antibiotics. Mild
infections included mild signs and symp-
toms, such as mild fever or no fever
(<38C), sore throat, coughing and stuffy
nose, stable vital signs, and infection requir-
ing only oral antibiotics.11,15
The medical records of these patients
were further reviewed and the following
information was obtained: sex, age, renal
pathology, disease duration of NS (the time
from initiation of NS to confirmation of
infection), cumulative dose of prednisone
(5 mg prednisone ¼ 4 mg methylpredniso-
lone), and immunosuppressors administered
prior to infections in the last year, sites of
infections, aetiology of infections, labora-
tory data (when infection was confirmed),
prophylactic treatments (sulfamethoxazole
and other antibiotics), and outcomes.
Variables are described as mean and
standard deviation or proportion. ANOVA
or the 2 test was used to compare differ-
ences among groups. Logistic regression
analysis was performed to determine the
risk factors for severe infections in patients
with PNS. A P value of <0.05 was
2140 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
considered statistically significant. All stat-
istical analyses were performed using SPSS
17 (IBM, Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Overall, 138 patients with infections among
1202 patients with PNS in hospital were
analysed. There were 45 patients in the
mild infection group, 60 patients in the
moderate infection group, and 33 patients
in the severe infection group. The most
common site of infections was pulmonary
(72.4%), followed by the upper respiratory
tract (12.3%), urinary tract (6.5%), soft
tissue (3.6%), gastrointestinal tract (2.1%),
and central nervous system (1.4%). In the
severe infection group, most patients
(96.9%) had pulmonary infections (Table 1).
The causative microorganisms in the 138
patients with PNS are shown in Table 2.
In 51 patients, microorganisms were not
found (among them, 15 patients had no
specimen to be tested). Among the other
87 patients, Klebsiella pneumoniae was the
most commonly identified in 17 (12.3%)
patients, followed by Gram-negative bacil-
lus (6.5%), Tubercle bacillus (6.5%), asper-
gillosis (5.7%), Escherichia coli (5.7%), and
Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.7%). In the
severe infection group, most microorganisms
were opportunistic pathogens, including
aspergillosis (24.2%), nocardiosis (18.1%),
Pneumocystis carinii (9.0%), Tubercle bacillus
(9.0%), and Cryptococcus (3.0%). We also
investigated viral infections, such as cyto-
megalovirus infection, but no virus was
isolated in any of the three groups.
Clinical characteristics of infections in
patients with PNS are shown in Table 3. The
mean age at presentation was 59.3 Æ 14.8
years and the female-to-male ratio was
51:87. The mean duration of NS was 10.4
months (range: 0.2­240 months). The mean
cumulative prednisone dose was 3.5 Æ 5.0 g.
Patients in the severe infection group had
the most cumulative prednisone dose
(7.1 Æ 6.1 g) and this dose was significantly
higher than that in the other two groups
(2.9 Æ 4.3 and 1.5 Æ 3.5, p ¼ 0.013). A total
of 34.7% of patients had cyclophosphamide,
mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine A,
tacrolimus, or azathioprine therapy.
Patients in the severe infection group had
the highest use of immunosuppressors, and
this use was significantly higher than that in
the other two groups (p ¼ 0.029).
All patients had a renal biopsy. The most
common renal pathological types were
membranous nephropathy (47.1%), fol-
lowed by minimal change disease (34.0%),
IgA nephropathy (10.1%), focal segmental
glomerulosclerosis (7.9%), and mesangio-
proliferative glomerulonephritis (0.7%).

The mean 24-h urine protein level was
5.9 Æ 5.1 g/day. Albumin levels dramatically
declined over the course of infection and
the mean value was 20.3 Æ 5.6 g/L. Serum
creatinine levels were increased and
the mean value was 142.1 Æ 138.4 mmol/L.
Immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels were
declined and the mean value was 7.1 Æ
3.7 g/L. The mean cholesterol level was
7.1 Æ 3.0 mmol/L. Patients in the severe infec-
tion group had a significantly lower choles-
terol level compared with the other two
groups (p ¼ 0.023). Patients in the severe
infection group had lower 24-hour protein
levels and higher albumin and IgG levels, but
there were no significant differences among
the three groups. The CD4þ T cell count
decreased over the course of infection and the
mean level was 436.6 Æ 213.6 cells/mm3.
Patients in the severe infection group had a
significantly lower CD4þ T cell count com-
pared with the other two groups (p ¼ 0.017).
The rate of complications, including dia-
betes mellitus and chronic pulmonary dis-
ease, which could increase the opportunity
of infections, was not significantly different
among the three groups. Six patients died,
and all of these patients were in the severe
infection group. The mortality rate among
the three groups was significantly different
(p < 0.001).
Logistic regression showed that a lower
CD4þ T cell count (<300 cells/mm3) (odds
ratio ¼ 4.25 [95% confidence interval 1.680­
10.98], P < 0.001) and a higher cumulative
dose of prednisone (odds ratio ¼ 1.38 [95%
confidence interval 1.05­3.26], P ¼ 0.015)
were risk factors for severe infections in
patients with PNS.
Discussion
In this study, we describe the clinical char-
acteristics of infections in a Chinese cohort
of adult patients with PNS and identified the
possible risk factors associated with severe
infections. Most previous studies of NS
complicated by infections focussed on chil-
dren. Ajayan et al.14 found that the inci-
dence of major infections was 36.6% in
hospitalized children with NS and the most
common major infection was peritonitis

(incidence of 13.8%). Wei et al. showed that
97 of 508 (19.1%) admissions were asso-
ciated with defined major infections in chil-
dren with NS.16 Makoto et al.10 reported
infectious episodes in 16 (19%) adult
patients with NS during the study period,
and bacterial infections were the most
common, occurring in 10 of 16 (63%)
patients. In our study, infections were
found in 11.4% of patients with PNS in
hospital, and the most common site of
infections was pulmonary (72.4%) and
the most common microorganism was
Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.3%). In the
severe infection group, most (96.9%)
patients had pulmonary infections with
opportunistic pathogens, including aspergil-
losis, nocardiosis, Pneumocystis carinii,
Tubercle bacillus, and Cryptococcus.
An interesting finding in our study was
that patients in the severe infection group
had lower 24-h urine protein and cholesterol

levels, and higher albumin and IgG levels
than those in the other two groups. These
findings are not consistent with previous
studies. Ogi et al.10 found that hypogamma-
globulinaemia and renal insufficiency were
independent risk factors for bacterial infec-
tion in adult patients with NS. Elidrissy
reported six nephrotic children with perito-
nitis and two with pneumococcal meningitis.
All of these cases had hypoproteinaemia and
all of those tested had low plasma IgG
levels.17 Gulati et al.18 showed that children
with NS who developed infectious complica-
tions had significantly higher serum choles-
terol levels and lower serum albumin levels
than children with NS without infection.
However, in our study, many patients
(39.1%) were not under corticosteroid ther-
apy, mainly because infection occurred
before steroid use. These patients were all in
the mild and moderate infection groups.
Therefore, after a long time of immunosup-
pressive therapy, the status of NS tends to be
better in patients with severe infection. These
findings suggested that hypoproteinaemia
and hypogammaglobulinaemia were not the
cause of severe infections in our patients.
Patients in the severe infection group had
a longer duration of NS, larger cumulative
dose of prednisone, more immunosuppres-
sor use, and lower CD4þ cell count.
Glucocorticoids exert many complex, quali-
tative, immunosuppressive effects that
induce cellular immunodeficiency, and
increase host susceptibility to types of
opportunistic infections. Glucocorticoids
also rapidly cause redistribution of lympho-
cytes from the circulation, depleting circu-
lating CD4þ T cells, and to a lesser extent,
CD8þ T cells.19 Different studies have
demonstrated that steroid therapy increases
the susceptibility for infections because of
impairment of cellular immunity.19­21
In the present study, we found two
important risk factors for severe infections
in patients with PNS. These factors were a
larger cumulative dose of prednisone and a
lower CD4þ cell count. This finding is
consistent with previous studies on kidney
transplant recipients and those with rheum-
atic diseases.3­6,22,23 Ferna
´ ndez-Ruiz et al.4
showed that monitoring of peripheral blood
lymphocyte subpopulations effectively iden-
tified kidney transplant recipients at risk of
opportunistic infections. Calarota et al.22
considered that determination of T-lympho-
cyte subsets was a simple and effective
parameter for identifying heart and kidney
transplant recipients at risk of developing
opportunistic infections. Another study
showed that monitoring of T-helper cell
counts may be useful for estimating
the risk for subsequent infections in
patients with various chronic inflammatory
diseases.23
In conclusion, this study showed that, in
the severe infection group, albumin and IgG
levels were higher than those in the other
two groups, mainly because the status of
NS tended to be better with immunosup-
pressive therapy. CD4þ T cells were lower
in the severe infection group than in the
other two groups because of immunosup-
pressive effects of glucocorticoids or immu-
nosuppressors. Therefore, a decline in
CD4þ T cells could be a risk factor for
predicting severe infections in adult patients
with PNS.
