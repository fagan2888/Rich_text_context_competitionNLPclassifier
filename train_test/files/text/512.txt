Abstract
Objective. Factors associated with treatment compliance have been well studied. However, no study has examined treatment
compliance under the context of physician­industry relationship. This study developed a conceptual framework of physician­
industry relationship and treatment compliance, and empirically tested patients' treatment compliance and affordability under
the physician­industry relationship in the USA.
Design. We first proposed a conceptual framework to analyze different scenarios, where the physician­industry relationship
could impact patients' treatment compliance and affordability, taking into consideration the role of health insurers. We then
employed a nationally representative data set to investigate these relationships. Multivariable logistic regressions were employed
to examine the physician­industry relationship and the physicians' perception of patients' treatment compliance.
Setting and Participants. 2008 Health Tracking Physician Survey.
Results. Our results showed that physicians with closer industry relationships were more likely to report rejection of care by
insurers [odds ratios (ORs): 1.24­1.85, P < 0.001], patients' non-compliance with treatment (OR: 1.34, P < 0.01) and patients'
inability to pay (OR: 1.42, P < 0.01) as the major problems affecting their ability to provide high quality care, when compared
with physicians without industry relationships.
Conclusions. Our results shed light on the lack of articulation among industry, physicians and health insurers in the USA. It
is important to make sure that different agents in the health-care marketplace, such as physicians, industry, and health
insurers, coordinate more efficiently to provide quality and consistent care to patients.

Introduction
The relationship between physicians and industry is ubiqui-
tous [1­6] in the USA. The 2001 National Survey of
Physicians showed that `92% of physicians received drug
samples, 61% received meals, tickets to events, or free travel,
13% received financial or other kinds of benefits, and 12%
received incentives for participation in clinical trials' [1, 7].
The pervasiveness of physician­industry interactions is also
reflected by the considerable marketing investments by the
pharmaceutical companies. The pharmaceutical industry allo-
cates 33% of its revenue on `selling and administration' [8]
and spends $19 billion each year `establishing and maintain-
ing' relationships with physicians.
The physician­industry interaction can have positive and
negative effects on patient's care. The physician­industry
interaction could be beneficial to reduce under-prescription
of essential medications. Many prescription drugs in the
market would not exist without physicians' involvement in
clinical trials. Physicians with closer industry relationships,
however, are more likely to request the addition of specific
drugs from particular pharmaceutical companies on hospital
formularies, are more likely to prescribe these companies'
drugs and are less likely to prescribe generic medications

[1, 3, 9]. Such changes in the use of medications can poten-
tially be expensive and `nonrational' [3, 9] because the indus-
try could promote some drugs with lower therapeutic
advantage when compared with more cost-effective alterna-
tives. Moreover, in the USA, health insurers are the major
payers of health services and medical products. Health
insurers' interests and guidelines complicate the physician­in-
dustry relationship.
This is the first paper that to our knowledge examined
patients' treatment compliance and affordability under the
physician­industry relationship. The health benefits of treat-
ment compliance have been well documented [10, 11].
Patients' characteristics [12], health-care access and health in-
surance coverage could all affect patients' treatment compli-
ance and affordability [13, 14]. However, no study has
examined treatment compliance under the context of phys-
ician­industry relationships. It is critical that different agents
in the health-care marketplace, such as doctors, industry and
health insurers, work together more efficiently and better
coordinated to provide quality and continued care to
patients.
In this study, we first set up a conceptual framework to
analyze different scenarios where physician­industry relation-
ship could impact treatment compliance and affordability,
considering the role of health insurers. Then, we employed a
nationally representative data set of physicians to empirically
investigate this relationship. It is worth noting that although
we studied the health-care market in the USA, our results
may provide references and policy implications of the phys-
ician­industry relationships to other countries too. Physician­
industry relationship is common in the UK, Australia and
other countries [15­19]. Although most of these countries
have guidelines prohibiting companies from giving physician
incentives to prescribe their products in the form of gifts or
payments [15], these guidelines were either developed recent-
ly or are still being developed. Researchers from different
countries [18] have consistently called for more transparency
of physician­industry communications.
Conceptual framework
Fig. 1 delineates the relationships among health-care provi-
ders, patients, health insurers and industry in the USA. In
this simplified health-care market, doctors choose medical
supplies, such as drugs and medical devices, on behalf of
patients. On the other hand, health insurers are the main
payers of these products. Under most circumstances, insurers
provide formularies for doctors to select medications and
sometimes require pre-approval for certain medical services.
The industry negotiates with health insurers the inclusion of
their products in insurers' formularies, as well as prices.
Health insurers also set copayment (or coinsurance) and
guidelines for these products to be used, which can influence
provider and patient decisions.
The interactions of industry, doctors and health insurers
are complex and multidimensional. A typology of three pos-
sible scenarios is the following.
Coordinated case
Industry balances the promotion effort between doctors and
insurers. Doctors are well informed and have full knowledge
of the products advantages as well as their side effects.
Health insurers put these products on their formulary and
charge reasonable copayments after fair negotiations with the
industry. In this case, doctors would appropriately prescribe
medical products to patients, and patients would pay reason-
able copayment and use these products regularly. Under this
coordinated scenario, three agents work coordinately to
ensure patients receive the best quality care possible.
Physician-dominant case
Industry put more emphasis on doctors' detailing and pro-
motion. Doctors have strong incentives to prescribe the pro-
ducts; however, health insurers, as the main payer, refuse to
pay or shift the financial burden to patients by charging high
copayment or coinsurance. In this case, patients may hesitate
to purchase the product or have problems to continually use
the product given cost concerns. Physicians, thus, may report
more problems related to health-care delivery due to insur-
ance rejections or patients' non-compliance.
Insurer-dominant case
Insurance companies are the main decision makers who rank
different drugs and medical devices in favorable lists and set
copayments after negotiations with industry. Physicians, as
the main decision makers on product selection, do not have
the incentives to prescribe the newly added medical product.
Figure 1 Relationships among doctors, industry, health
insurers and patients in the USA. (i) The interactions of
industry, doctors and health insurers are complex and
multidimensional. Fig. 1 provides a simplified framework of
these three agents. (Sponsor refers to patient's employer, the
government or other third party payers who will share the
drug cost. Industry refers to the health- care industry, such
as pharmaceutical companies, or sometimes pharmaceutical
benefit managers who negotiate the drug prices with health
insurers on behalf of the industry.) (2) Our model is mainly
focused on the interaction of industry, doctors and health
insurers. It is also possible that industry can reach patients
directly by promotions or advertising, so that patients will
require certain medical products from the doctors. The
industry promotion strategies may vary by drug quality as
well. Insurance companies may also have different strategies
of cost sharing to motivate patients to use the products.
However, these are out of reach of this study.

In this case, it is possible that industry-promoted product
has low chance to reach patients. By definition, this scenario
implies zero or a weak physician­industry relationship.
These scenarios imply three different associations between
industry interactions and the health-care quality. In the
`Coordinated cases', the physician­industry relationship is
positively associated with patients' treatment compliance, if
other factors are controlled. On the other hand, in the
`Physician-dominant case', the physician industry relation-
ship is negatively associated with patients' treatment compli-
ance, if other factors are controlled. In the `Insurer-dominant
case', we may observe weak physician­industry relationship, i.
e. its insignificant association with treatment compliance.
Thus, the association of physician­industry relationship and
treatment compliance is an empirical issue. Using a nationally
representative physician sample, we empirically tested this re-
lationship in the US health-care market.
Method
Data and variables
This study used the 2008 Health Tracking Physician Survey,
cross-sectional nationally representative sample of physicians
in the USA [20]. Physicians were selected from the American
Medical Association and consisted of `active, non-federal,
office- and hospital-based' physicians who provided direct
patient care at least 20 h per week. The response rate was
62%. The survey was administered by mail, and the partici-
pating physicians received $50 or $75 honorarium.
The survey provided detailed information on physicians'
demographic information, practice and patient characteristics.
The Health Tracking Physician Survey also provided sam-
pling weights to adjust for the probability of selection and
survey non-responses. More detailed information about this
survey method is available in its Methodology Report [20].
Dependent variable: measures of treatment compliance. The Health
Tracking Physician Survey asked physicians to identify the
barriers to provide quality care. The survey question was:
`Please indicate whether you think it is a major problem, minor
problem or not a problem affecting your ability to provide
quality care to: (i) rejections of care decisions by insurance
companies, (ii) patient non-compliance with treatment and (iii)
patients' inability to pay for needed care.' The possible answers
to each of these questions were one if the response was `no
problem', two if it was a `minor problem' and three if it was a
`major problem.' We constructed dichotomous variables for
each of these questions that equaled one if physicians
identified it as a major problem and zero otherwise.
Key independent variables: physician­industry relationship. The
specific survey question was `Excluding any food, beverages,
and drug samples you may have received in your workplace,
please estimate the total value of all goods and services you
received in 2006 from drug, device, or other medically-related
companies. Include honoraria or payments from surveys on
prescribing practices conducted by marketing or research
firms for medically-related companies.' Physicians' answers
were placed in one of the following categories: 0 = none; 1 =
$1­$500; 2 = $501­$1000; 3 = more than $1000.
Other independent variables. We used Reschovsky's [21]
conceptual model of physicians' perception of health-care
quality for our model specification. This health-care quality
model has been adopted in many recent studies [22, 23].
According to this framework, physician demographic
characteristics, patients' components and practice characteristics
can all affect physicians' perceived quality care. In our empirical
model, we controlled the following physician characteristics:
gender, race/ethnicity, specialties, years of practice, board
certification status, foreign medical school graduate status,
practice ownership and physicians' perception of market
competition.
Patient components included in our study were patients'
race/ethnicity ratios and share of patients with chronic dis-
eases. Practice characteristics included practice types, share of
practice revenues from Medicare, Medicaid, and managed
care and practice location. We also included state dummies to
account for differences on aggregate market effects on
health-care quality.
The sample size of 2008 Health Tracking Physician Survey
was 4720. Excluding an additional 150 respondents with
missing information on physician demographic information,
29 with unknown or missing industry relationship and 85
with missing treatment compliance variables, our final
sample size was 4456 physicians.
Analysis
We first presented sample descriptive statistics and summar-
ized the compliance measures by different levels of industry
income. We used multivariate logistic regression models to
examine the association between the physician­industry rela-
tionship and three measures of treatment compliance/afford-
ability individually. All regression models used sampling
weights to account for the differential selection probability
and to generate nationally representative results. We used
Stata 10 to perform the statistical analyses.
Results
Table 1 shows the summary statistics of our sample.
Approximately, 50% of physicians reported that rejection of
care by insurers was a major problem that affected their
ability to provide quality care. Likewise, 39 and 40% of phy-
sicians reported that patients' non-compliance with treatment
and inability to pay were major problems, respectively.
As to the physician­industry relationships, 51% of physicians
in our sample received $0, 32% received $1­$500, 7% received
$501­$1000 and 10% received a total value of more than $1000
from industry excluding free drug samples and food. Most phy-
sicians were males, Whites, graduated from US medical schools,
reported a medical specialty, had solo or group practice and
were board certified. The average number of years in practice
was 18. Among the patients, on average, 64% were White, 15%
were Latino, 16% were African-American and 5% were Asian

Americans. Physicians also had 53% of patients with chronic
conditions. Most physicians' practices were located in large or
small metropolitan areas and had more than five managed care
contracts.
Table 2 reports the summary statistics of three outcome
measures by different levels of industry income. The percen-
tages of reporting major problems increased with physicians'
industry income. For example, when compared with those
with $0 industry income, physicians with more than $1000
industry income had 18 and 7% higher likelihoods of report-
ing rejection of care by insurers and patients' non-
compliance with treatment as major problems, respectively
(P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively).
Table 3 presents the results of multivariate logistic regres-
sions. In the regression of rejections of care by insurer, the
odds ratios associated with industry income were 1.24 (95%
CI: 1.08­1.44), 1.64 (95% CI: 1.27­2.10) and 1.85 (95% CI:
1.47­2.32), increasing with the amount of industry income.
The odd ratio of more than $1000 industry income was 1.34
(95% CI: 1.07­1.68) in the regression of patient's non-
compliance with treatment. The odd ratio of $500­$1000
industry income was 1.42 (95% CI: 1.11­1.82) in the regres-
sion of patient's inability to pay.
Results showed that physicians' specialty and practice types
were significantly associated with the likelihoods of reporting
major problems. Results also showed that minority physicians
or physicians with more minority patients were more likely to
have major problems with these three outcome measures.

revenues from Medicaid, or who reported more competition,
were also more likely to report treatment compliance as a
major problem.
Sensitivity analysis
To test the robustness of our results, we applied different
multivariate models. We first used ordered-probit models,
treating assessments of treatment compliance as multi-
category variables. Subsequently, we used ordinary least
square models, treating treatment compliance as continuous
variables. All these models produced similar results.
Discussion
Our results shed light on the lack of coordination among in-
dustry, physicians and health insurers in the USA. If a specif-
ic drug (or medical device) is not on health insurance
formularies, patients may not be able to afford it or regularly
take it. In these cases, physicians may perceive a reduced
ability to provide quality of care that reflects an inherent con-
flict between insurers who emphasize cost-effectiveness cri-
teria and the marketing goals from pharmaceutical
companies. Patient's quality care and the perceived ability of
physicians to provide it may be compromised under this con-
flict of interest. According to our conceptual framework, our
findings showed that the current health-care market could be
closer to the `physician-dominant' case described in our con-
ceptual framework, where physicians perceived barriers to
provide high quality care due to the restrictions established
by insurers.
In addition, our results showed some evidences that a
greater `relationship' with the industry would somehow influ-
ence physicians' decisions of the prescriptions. The multivari-
ate results indicated that having greater industry involvement
increases the likelihood of insurance company denials of
treatment. Previous studies also showed that when compared
with physicians with no relationship with the industry, physi-
cians with this relationship would be more likely to request
the inclusion of promoted drugs in formularies and more
likely to prescribe drugs that were promoted by the industry
[9]. Thus, if the industry influence induces physicians to
prescribe less standard treatment, the proposed treatment
may face higher likelihood of denial.
Nevertheless, insurer's involvement in the physician­indus-
try relationship might reduce physicians' opportunist behav-
ior. If prescribed drugs had a limited therapeutic value or a
lower cost-effectiveness ratio when compared with existing
drugs or generic alternatives, patient's quality care and finan-
cial security might be compromised. The inclusion of more
expensive drugs in these formularies might hinder the ob-
jective of health-care cost reduction. Thus, health insurers
should establish more regulations to limit the pervasive effect
that industry advertisement among physicians could have on
the quality of care delivered to patients. For instance, health
insurers may enhance health-care quality by testing the cost-
effectiveness of drugs included in formularies, more restrict-
ive drug utilization reviews, provide more information to
consumers, among other actions.
Our results also showed that physicians primarily treating
racial and ethnic minority patients were more likely to report
patients' low treatment compliance and inability to pay.
These findings are consistent with the health disparity litera-
ture that minority patients were more likely to have worse
health-care quality and lower health-care access [24]. In add-
ition, consistent with previous literature [23], our results
showed that physicians with more managed care contract or
those who face higher market competitions were more likely
to report rejection care by the insurer and patients' low treat-
ment compliance and inability to pay.
Our study had some limitations. First, the physician­in-
dustry relationship was self-reported. Physicians might under-
report this relationship that was known as `social desirability
bias' [25]. Thus, the reported drug income could be consid-
ered as a lower bound for the relationship estimated in our
models. Second, patients' treatment compliance and afford-
ability were physicians' self-perception and might not reflect
the real treatment compliance. However, physicians' self-
assessment of quality care may provide valuable insights into
the absence of objective clinical information [16]. In add-
ition, although we included all available covariates from the
survey, our results were still subject to omitted variables that
might be associated with treatment compliance. For example,
patients' cultural background, social economic status and
other variables could influence their decisions of whether to

Treatment compliance under physician­industry relationship · Policy

take medications regularly. Finally, we investigated the associ-
ation between industry interaction and perceived treatment
compliance with a cross-sectional design. With such analysis,
it was difficult to infer a causal relationship between industry
relationship and physician perceived quality of care.
Despite these limitations, our results underscored the need
for policy makers to address this problem. More patients
were aware of and showed concerns with physician­industry
interaction in the USA [4, 26, 27]. Meanwhile, consumer
advocates in Australia [18], UK [15], Turkey [19] and other
countries have long demanded details of the financial rela-
tionships between doctors and industry. Luckily, some
medical organizations have realized this problem and imple-
mented according policy to make the physician­industry rela-
tionship more transparent to the public [5, 28, 29] such as
Boston Medical Center, the University of Michigan Health
System and the Yale University School of Medicine.
As an important component of the ongoing health-care
reform in the USA, the Obama administration has recently
set new guidelines, such as the Physician Payments Sunshine
Act, for drug companies to disclose the payments or gifts
they make to physicians for research, consulting, etc.
Similarly, the National Health and Medical Research Council
in Australia also calls for developing new guidelines to make
the industrial sponsorship transparent and credible [15].
Many countries have guidelines developed by different
institutions prohibiting companies from giving physician gifts
or financial incentives [15], although the standard regulation
of physician­industry relationship is still lacking. For example,
in the USA, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America, and The American College of Physicians, have their
own guidelines. These organizations may have different goals,
and thus a multiplicity of guidelines may lead to lack of co-
ordination and the adequate definition of an effective frame-
work that both the industry and physicians can observe. It is
important that future guidelines should be developed jointly
[15] with the aim of reducing the likelihood of conflicts of
interest between patients and physicians.
Conclusions
Our study underscored the need for policy makers to
address the conflicting goals between the cost-effective cri-
teria used by public and private insurers to reimburse
patients and the profitability goals pursued by pharmaceutical
and other medically related companies. Patients are in the
middle of this conflict, facing barriers to receive and afford
appropriate health care. It is important to encourage coordin-
ation among doctors, industry and health insurer, to promote
patient's quality care. It is the role of public institutions to
ensure that these practices do not weaken current efforts to
control costs while providing quality and consistent care.
