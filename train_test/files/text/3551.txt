Sexual Regret: Tests of Competing
Explanations of Sex Differences

Abstract
The current study sought to answer three key questions about explaining the emotion of regret in the domain of casual sex: Are
sex differences in sexual regret robust or attenuated in a highly egalitarian culture? What proximate psychological variables might
explain sex differences in sexual regret? And what accounts for within-sex variation in experiences of sexual regret about casual
sex. We conducted a study of 263 Norwegian students (ages 19­37) who reported how much they regretted having either
engaged in, or passed up, their most recent casual sexual experience. Sex differences in sexual regret are not attenuated in this
sexually egalitarian culture. The study revealed sex differences in worries about pregnancy, STIs, and reputation; however, these
predictors did not succeed in accounting for the sex differences in regret engaging in casual sex. Sexual gratification and socio-
sexual orientation both predicted the sex differences in casual sex regret. In contrast, only socio-sexual orientation attenuated
the sex difference in regret passing up casual sex. Predictors of within-sex variation in casual sexual regret included worry about
sexual reputation, experienced gratification during the encounter, and socio-sexual orientation. Discussion focuses on implica-
tions for the psychological design features of this relatively neglected emotion.

The emotion of regret has gained increasing attention from an
evolutionary perspective (e.g., Galperin et al., 2013; Roese
et al., 2006). Given the centrality of sex to reproduction, a good
case can be made that sexual conduct is a particularly important
domain for experiencing regret. Prior research has found that
although women and men tend not to differ in their experiences
of regret in general, a major exception occurs within the roman-
tic and sexual domains. Roese et al. (2006) found that men and
women did not differ in their regrets about having had sex but
men, more than women, regretted missed sexual opportunities
in the past. Eshbaugh and Gute (2008) reported that reproduc-
tive sexual acts (intercourse) predicted regret in women after
sexual hookups, while nonreproductive sexual acts such as oral
sex did not predict regret. These findings have been interpreted
as being consistent with parental investment theory (Trivers,
1972) and sexual strategies theory (Buss & Schmitt, 1993).
Recently, Galperin et al. (2013) hypothesized that regret, or
anticipated regret, may be an evolved emotional­cognitive
evaluation mechanism serving the specific function of avoiding
past errors in decision-making, thus improving future decision-
making, in this case about sexual decisions.
Although both sexes sometimes experience regret about
casual sex decisions, following the logic of sexual strategies
theory (Buss & Schmitt, 1993), they differ in which aspects of
casual sex that they regret (Galperin et al., 2013). This is due to
selective pressures ultimately stemming from a large asym-
metric difference in obligatory parental investment. Men and
women are expected to differ in which casual sex decisions
they regret more--having had casual sex with the wrong part-
ner versus passing up casual sexual opportunity. Because errors
in sexual decisions are typically costlier for women, women are
hypothesized to regret sexual actions that involve making a
poor sexual partner choice or having sex in unpropitious

circumstances. Conversely, men are hypothesized to regret
missed casual sexual opportunities more than women because
historically a man's reproductive success was constrained pri-
marily by the number of fertile women to whom he could gain
sexual access. Both hypotheses have received empirical sup-
port, with results showing a moderate effect for having had
casual sex (women regret more; Fisher, Worth, Garcia, &
Meredith, 2011; Galperin et al., 2013), and a strong effect for
passing up sexual opportunities (men regret more; Galperin
et al., 2013; Roese et al., 2006).
Possible Proximate Explanations of Sex Differences
in Casual Sexual Regret
What proximate mechanisms may account for these observed
sex differences? Galperin et al. (2013) offer two possible, not
mutually exclusive, alternative explanations: (1) differences in
worry about consequences in the aftermath of sex, such that
women worry more about pregnancy, and (2) differences in
sexual gratification experienced during the sexual encounters
such that men, on average, experience greater gratification than
women (Fisher et al., 2011).
Despite the low risk, becoming pregnant following casual
sex historically (and perhaps currently) has been costlier for
women than for men. This would cause women to worry more
about casual sex encounters and cause them to regret casual sex
more than men (Galperin et al., 2013). Other research has
shown on-average sex differences bearing on these proximate
explanations: Women tend to worry more than men and are
more troubled by ruminative mental processing (Nolen-
Hoeksema, 2000; Nolen-Hoeksema & Jackson, 2001; Wells,
2009). Conversely, this might conceptualized as men being
more hypophobic and risk-taking (Kennair, 2007; Kruger &
Nesse, 2004; Wilson & Daly, 1985). However, worry about
becoming pregnant following casual sex might be less relevant
in populations where hormonal contraception use is common
(e.g., female students in most Western societies and our popu-
lation in particular; Grøntvedt, Kennair, & Mehmetoglu, 2015).
On the other hand, hormonal contraception does not protect
against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and worry about
contracting STIs might therefore pose a relevant problem. Men
also engage in more risky sexual behavior and contract more
STIs than women (Courtenay, 2000)--maybe as a result of less
worry about STIs. Further, due to sexual double standards
(Buss, 2013), even in a sexually liberal Western culture such
as Norway (Grøntvedt & Kennair, 2013), where the current
study was performed, worry about sexual reputation might be
stronger among women than among men. Therefore, in addi-
tion to Galperin et al.'s (2013) suggestion that female-specific
worry about pregnancy might influence casual sex regret, we
suggest that increased worry among women about contracting
STIs or incurring a negative sexual reputation following casual
sex might be possible explanations of sex differences in sexual
regret (Campbell, 2008). These explanations, of course, are not
mutually exclusive--one or some combination of them could,
in principle, explain the sex differences.
A number of studies on sex-related preferences, desires, and
interests find that men have stronger interest in sex, enjoy sex
more, are more easily stimulated and aroused, and are more
open to casual sex than women (Ellis et al., 2008; Kennair,
Schmitt, Fjeldavli, & Harlem, 2009; Meltzer, McNulty, &
Maner, 2015). Galperin et al. (2013) suggested that because
women find casual sex less physically gratifying, they will tend
to regret sexual experiences more than men. However, how
much and in what ways physical gratification during casual sex
influence sex differences in sexual regret remains to be exam-
ined, although suggestive data reveal that quality of sexual
experience may be linked to sexual regret (Fisher et al., 2011).
In addition to attempting to explain between-sex differ-
ences, another key goal of the current study is to examine
individual differences in sexual regret. Individual differences
in regret have received little empirical attention. Individual
differences in regret may plausibly be linked with sociosexu-
ality, a personality characteristic shown to be strongly sex dif-
ferentiated, with men being less restricted across all studied
cultures (Schmitt, 2005). Scoring high on the behavioral
dimension of sociosexual orientation reflects more frequent
casual sex and a broader range of different sexual experi-
ences, thus giving an individual more opportunities to expe-
rience sexual regret (Simpson & Gangestad, 1991). On the
other hand, short-term strategists may experience less sexual
regret because casual sex is more congruent with their pre-
ferred sexual strategy. Those who are easily aroused by extra-
relational partners and new encounters, characteristics of high
scorers on revised Sociosexuality Orientation Inventory
(SOI-R; Penke & Asendorpf, 2008), should experience less
regret in the aftermath of casual sexual. In addition, no pre-
vious studies have yet considered how individual differences
in worry and physical gratification may be linked to individual
differences in regret.
The Current Study
The first goal of the current research is to examine whether
previously documented sex differences in sexual regret can be
reproduced in a sexually liberal, secularized, and highly egali-
tarian culture, since social role theory predicts that this key
features of cultures can dramatically influence the presence
or absence of psychological sex differences (Bendixen, 2014;
Bendixen, Kennair, & Buss, 2015; Buss & Barnes, 1986; Eagly
& Wood, 1999; Grøntvedt & Kennair, 2013; Wood & Eagly,
2007). Norway together with other Scandinavian countries dur-
ing the last years have been ranked among the top nations on
the Global Gender Gap Report (World Economic Forum,
2016). In comparison, the United States was recently ranked
45. In addition, Scandinavian countries are ranked among the
least religious (Gallup, 2010) and among the most sexually
liberal (Scott, 1998) as reflected by attitudes toward premarital
sex, extramarital sex, and homosexuality. If social role theories
about monomorphic psychology, and specifically sexual psy-
chology, are correct, findings of sex differences in U.S. popu-
lations will not replicate or be diminished in more egalitarian

countries, and we should not find similar patterns of sex dif-
ferences in sexual regret in Norway. Second, we seek to test
alternative hypotheses about different proximate explanations
that may account for the sex differences in regret engaging in
casual sex, notably worry about consequences in the aftermath
of casual sex and physical gratification experienced during
casual sex. The third goal is to examine the extent individual
differences in sociosexuality may account for sex differences in
sexual regret.
We tested the following hypotheses and research question:
Hypothesis 1: Women will regret having had casual sex
more than men (Fisher et al., 2011; Galperin et al., 2013),
but according to social role theory, this sex difference will
be attenuated in a highly sexually egalitarian culture.
Hypothesis 2: Men will regret passing up casual sex more
than women (Galperin et al., 2013; Roese et al., 2006), but
according to social role theory, this sex difference will be
attenuated in a highly sexually egalitarian culture.
Hypothesis 3: Women will worry more about casual sex
consequences (pregnancy, STIs, and reputation) than men,
and worry will account for sex differences in casual sex
regret (Campbell, 2008; Galperin et al., 2013).
Hypothesis 4: Women will experience less physical grati-
fication from casual sex than men (pleasure, orgasm, and
orgasm importance) and gratification differences will
account for sex differences in casual sex regret (Fisher
et al., 2011; Galperin et al., 2013).
Hypothesis 5: Women will have more restricted sociosexu-
ality than men (Schmitt, 2005), and sociosexuality differ-
ences will account for sex differences in casual sex regret.
Explorative research questions. We also wish to examine predic-
tors of individual differences of sexual regret (for men and
women separately). Specifically, we will explore (1) whether
worries (about pregnancy, STIs, and sexual reputation), phys-
ical gratification during casual sex, and sociosexual orientation
affect within-sex variance in regrets about having had casual
sex and regrets about passing up sexual opportunities and (2)
whether the factors that affect regrets are similar or different for
men and women.
Method
Sample and Design
Students attending different lectures at the Faculties of Social,
Natural, and Human Sciences of a Norwegian University
responded to a four-page questionnaire on sexual regret. A total
of 263 heterosexual students aged between 19 and 37 years
reporting on their most recent casual sex incidence were eligi-
ble for analyses. Mean ages for women (n ¼ 168) and men (n ¼
95) were 22.9 (SD ¼ 2.6) and 23.5 (SD ¼ 3.1), respectively.
Sixty-one percent of the women and 66% of the men reported
relationship status as ``single.''
Procedure
Two research assistants, one male and one female, gave a short
oral presentation of the study, ``a study of sexual experiences
and regret'' during a lecture break. Instructions read: ``The
purpose of this survey is to gain more knowledge on possible
sexual regret among students. The study is part of a larger
collaboration among Norwegian and American researchers.''
Participants were informed of the content of the questionnaire
and were then invited to participate. Participation was fully
voluntary and the students were assured that their responses
would remain completely anonymous. Responding was done
during the 15-min lecture break. No personal identification was
to be written on the questionnaire. Completed questionnaires
were folded and returned to a box at the podium. No course
credit was given for participation.
Measures
Outcome variables
Casual sex regret. We included, from Galperin et al. (2013), 2
global items on regrets related to the most recent casual sex
incidence: (1) regretting having had casual sex and (2) regret-
ting passing up casual sex. Participants responded to the fol-
lowing alternatives: Not applicable--I haven't done this (not
coded), I'm glad I did it (coded 0), neutral--neither glad nor
have regrets (coded 1), I regret it somewhat (coded 2), and I
regret it very much (coded 3).
Predictors. In addition to sex, age, and relationship status, the
below predictors were analyzed.
Worry. Six items were developed for measuring worries fol-
lowing most recent casual sex incident and general worries
following casual sex. Three separate aspects of worry included:
(1) becoming pregnant (or partner becoming pregnant), (2)
contracting STIs, and (3) sexual reputation. Participants rated
their level of worry on a 5-point Likert-type scale with high
scores reflecting more worry.
Physical gratification. Six items were developed measuring
physical gratification in relation to most recent casual sex inci-
dent and general gratification in relation to casual sex. Three
separate aspects of gratification were included: (1) general sex-
ual pleasure, (2) whether one achieved an orgasm, and (3) the
subjective importance of orgasming. Participants rated their
level of sexual pleasure, regularity of orgasm achieved, and
orgasm importance using a 5-point Likert-type scale with high
scores reflecting more gratification.
Sociosexuality. Participants completed the SOI-R (Penke &
Asendorpf, 2008). Internal consistency was good for the 9-item
measure (a ¼ .86) as well as for each of the three components:
SOI­Behavior (a ¼ .86), SOI­Attitudes (a ¼ .81), and SOI­
Desire (a ¼ .89). The three components correlated moderately
(r's between .32 and .49) were treated as separate predictors
throughout the analysis. Scaling and scoring were identical to
Penke and Asendorpf (2008).

Results
Sex Differences
Clear sex differentiated patterns emerged for participants who
reported their level of regret--having either engaged in or
having passed up casual sex. As can be seen from Table 1,
more women (34.2%) than men (20.4%) regretted their most
recent incident of casual sex. The pattern was significantly
different for women and men, w2 (3, N ¼ 257) ¼ 14.61, p <
.01, rt
¼ À.20 (Cohen's d ¼ .47, 95% CI [0.21, 0.73]). On the
other hand, far more men (28.9%) than women (3.6%) regretted
passing up casual sex the last time they had the chance. Only
43.3% of the men were glad they passed up casual sex com-
pared to 79.3% of the women. The pattern was significantly
different for the two sexes, w2 (3, N ¼ 259) ¼ 45.22, p < .001, rt
¼ .38 (Cohen's d ¼ .82, 95% CI [0.70, 1.20]).
Before testing whether sex differences in engaging or pass-
ing up casual sex regret could be accounted for by variables
related to worry following casual sex, casual sex gratification,
or sociosexuality, we need to examine the strength of sex dif-
ferences in these possible moderators. For the worry measures,
sex differences in the theory-expected direction were signifi-
cant for two of the three aspects (see Table 2). In general, the
sex effect was small to moderate as indexed by the Cohen's d
statistic. Further, sex differences in the theory-expected direc-
tion were evident for all three aspects of physical gratification
when having casual sex. The sex differences were particularly
strong for the orgasm measures, each showing large effect
sizes. Sex differences in the theory-expected direction were
evident for the three dimensions of sociosexuality.
Are Sex Differences in Regrets Following the Most Recent
Casual Sex Incident Accounted for by Worry Following
Casual Sex, Physical Gratification During Casual Sex,
or Sociosexuality?
For predicting regret engaging in casual sex and regret passing
up causal sex, respectively, we performed ordered logistic
regression analyses. This statistical technique is applicable
under the assumption that the levels of the dependent variable
have a natural ordering (low to high), but the distances between
adjacent levels are unknown (http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/
stata/output/stata_ologit_output.htm). Demographic predictor
variables were sex (women vs. men), age (continuous), and
relationship status (single vs. paired). The remaining additional
predictor variables were entered in separate models: Model 1,
worry (pregnancy, STI, and reputation); Model 2, physical
gratification (sexual pleasure, orgasm achieved, and orgasm
importance); and Model 3, sociosexuality (behavior, attitudes,
and desire). Initial analyses suggested that being single or being
paired did not affect either casual sex or passing up casual sex
regrets and revealed no Sex Â Relationship Status interaction
effects. Consequently, relationship status was omitted from the
further regressions.
Predicting casual sex regret from participant sex and age
showed that men were significantly less likely to regret than
women, Z ¼ À3.32, p < .001, OR ¼ 0.44, suggesting that
relative to women, men's likelihood of regretting was 0.44 and
women's likelihood of regretting was 2.27 times that of men.
Relative to younger participants, older participants regretted
casual sex significantly less, Z ¼ À2.48, p < .05, OR ¼ 0.90.
The effect of participant sex and age accounted for 3.0% of the

Recent Casual Sex Incident (N ¼ 257) and Most Recent Passing Up
Casual Sex Incident If Prior Casual Sex (N ¼ 259).

variance in casual sex regret (pseudo R2 ¼ .030). Adding the
three worry items (Model 1) did not affect the effect of parti-
cipant sex and age. Men and older participants still regretted
less. As shown in Table 3, participants who worried more about
their reputation following the most recent causal sex incident
regretted significantly more, while worries about pregnancy or
sexually transmitted diseases did not affect casual sex regret.
However, a marginal Sex Â Worry interaction effect (Z ¼
À1.79, p ¼ .074) suggests that the effect of reputation worry
may be moderated by participant sex. The zero-order correla-
tion was stronger for women (r ¼ .30) than for men (r ¼ .01).
In Model 2, we added the three physical gratification items
to the effect of sex and age. The effect of sex was significantly
reduced and no longer significant (Z ¼ À1.73, p ¼ .084, OR ¼
0.58), while the effect of age remained significant. As can be
seen from Table 2, higher reported level of sexual pleasure was
significantly associated with less regret and higher level of
orgasm importance was associated with more regret. The latter
finding is most likely an artifact because all three physical
gratification items were negatively associated with regretting
casual sex when analyzed individually. They all individually
significantly reduced the sex effect to nonsignificant levels.
However, none of the effects of the physical gratification items
were moderated by participant sex (Sex Â Gratification inter-
actions were all nonsignificant).
In Model 3, we added the three sociosexuality indexes to the
effect of sex and age. As seen from Table 3, sociosexuality
accounted for all the sex difference in sexual regret, but older
participants still regretted less than younger participants. Parti-
cipants scoring high on SOI­Attitudes and SOI­Desire
reported significantly less regret. These effects were not mod-
erated by participant sex (none of the interactions were
significant).
Within-Sex Predictors of Regretting Having Had
Casual Sex
To investigate which of the variables included in the three
model above may account for women and men's regrets enga-
ging in casual sex, we ran regression analyses separately for
women and men controlling for age and omitting all insignif-
icant effect from the separate models. The final model con-
tained four predictors that accounted for 14.1% of the
variance in women and two predictors accounting for 13.2%
of the variance in men. The significant predictors for women
were SOI­Attitudes (OR ¼ 0.68, Z ¼ À3.72, p < .001), sexual
pleasure (OR ¼ 0.61, Z ¼ À3.37, p < .001), worry about rep-
utation (OR ¼ 1.37, Z ¼ 2.17, p < .05), and a marginal effect for
SOI­Desire (OR ¼ 0.83, Z ¼ À1.89, p ¼ .059). Hence, women
who worry more about their reputation, who have low physical
gratification and who have a restricted sociosexuality are more
likely to regret casual sex. For men, the significant predictors
were sexual pleasure (OR ¼ 0.55, Z ¼ À2.78, p < .01) and SOI­
Desire (OR ¼ 0.72, Z ¼ À2.53, p < .05), suggesting that men
who experience less physical gratification and who have a
restricted sociosexuality (low on desire) are more likely to
regret casual sex.
Possible Ways Physical Gratification and Sociosexuality
Account for Sex Differences in Regretting Casual Sex
Given the exceptionally strong associations between partici-
pant sex and measures of physical gratification and sociosexu-
ality, it is unsurprising that a lion's share of sex differences in
casual sex regret disappears when controlling for the effects of
these factors statistically. Therefore, a meaningful framework
for interpretation is warranted. To provide further insight into

how women and men differ across discrete groups of regret
following casual sex (``glad'' vs. ``neutral'' vs. ``regret''), we
performed a multivariate analysis of variance on the three
physical gratification items as outcome variables.
There was a statistically significant difference between
women and men in physical gratification, F(3, 243) ¼ 32.97, p
<.001; Wilks'sL ¼ .711,partialZ2 ¼ .289,andbetweenthe three

partial Z2 ¼ .076. As illustrated in Figure 1, lower levels of
physical gratification were found for those who regretted. This
overalleffectwassimilarforwomenandmen;therewasnoSexÂ
Regret Group interaction. Analysis of between-subjects effects
for each of the gratification items all showed similar patterns.
There wasa statisticallysignificantdifferencebetweenwomen
and men in sociosexuality, F(3, 243) ¼ 19.48, p < .001; Wilks's L

F(6, 488) ¼ 7.06, p < .001; Wilks's L ¼ .846, partial Z2 ¼ .080. A
more restricted sociosexuality was found for those who regretted.
This overall effect was similar for women and men again with no
Sex Â Regret Group interaction. As illustrated in Figure 2, anal-
ysisofbetween-subjectseffectsfor theattitudesanddesire dimen-
sions of sociosexuality showed similar patterns, but unrestricted
sexual behavior evinced neither any sex difference, F(1, 245) ¼
0.23, nor any regret group difference, F(2, 245) ¼ 1.45.
Predictors of Regretting Passing Up Casual Sex
Predicting regretting passing up casual sex from sex and age
showed that men were significantly more likely to regret than
women, Z ¼ 6.14, p < .001, OR ¼ 5.63. Relative to women, men
were almost 6 times more likely to regret passing up their most
recent potential casual sex experience. Age was not significantly
related to regretting having passed up casual sex, Z ¼ 0.63. Sex
and age accounted for 9.1% of the variance in regret passing up
casual sex. Adding the 3 items on general, worry in Model 1 did
not affect the participant sex effect. Participants who generally
worried more about their sexual reputation following casual sex
were less likely to regret passing up casual sex. This effect was
not moderated by participant sex, and the remaining worry items
did not affect regretting having passed up casual sex.
In Model 2, we added the 3 items on general physical grat-
ification when having had casual sex previously. The effect of
sex was not affected by the inclusion of general physical grat-
ification (log odds remained identical, but the standard error
increased). Of the three predictors, only sexual pleasure
affected regretting sexual opportunities passed up. Participants
who reported more general sexual pleasure in relation to casual
sex were more likely to regret passing up (OR ¼ 1.44). Impor-
tantly, this effect was not moderated by participant sex.
When we added the three sociosexuality indexes to the
effect of sex and age in Model 3, the effect of participant sex
was reduced. Still, even when controlling for individual differ-
ences in sociosexuality, men were more than 3 times more
likely to regret passing up casual sex. As evident from Table
4, participants with attitudes condoning casual sex were signif-
icantly more likely to regret passing up. This effect was partly
moderated by participant sex, Z ¼ À2.01, p < .05 (stronger for
women than for men). Apparently, those who had more casual
sex regretted passing up sexual opportunities less than those
with few casual sex experiences but only when accounting for
SOI­Attitudes. The zero-order correlation for SOI­Behavior
was very close to 0 (r ¼ À.01) and similar for women and men.

casual sex, we ran regression analyses separately for the two
sexes controlling for age and omitting all nonsignificant effect
from the separate models. The final model came out with only
two predictors that accounted for 13.5% of the variance in
women and one predictor accounting for 3.5% of the variance
in men. For women and men, general worry about sexual repu-
tation following causal sex decreased the likelihood of regretting
passing up the most recent opportunity. For men, this variable
was the sole predictor (OR ¼ 0.57, Z ¼ À2.59, p < .01), while for
women unrestricted sociosexuality (SOI­Attitudes) produced
lower likelihood of regretting passing up (OR ¼ 1.91, Z ¼
4.47, p < .001), essentially accounting for the effect of worry
(OR ¼ 0.71, Z ¼ À1.69, p ¼ .092) in the final model. None of
the general gratification variables affected the likelihood in
women or men for regretting passing up casual sex.
Discussion
We found that men more than women regret passing up casual
sexual opportunities; women more than men regret having had
casual sex. This replicated the pattern of findings from
Galperin and colleagues (2013), supporting the evolutionary
hypotheses about sex differences in sexual regret. The study
also provides a modest test of a competing theory to explain
these sex differences--social role theory (Buss & Barnes,
1986; Eagly & Wood, 1999). Social role theory predicts that
sex differences will be attenuated or entirely absent in sexually
egalitarian cultures. Direct comparison of the effect sizes with
those reported by Galperin et al. (2013) reveal that the sex
differences in sexual regret show no diminution in this highly
sexually egalitarian culture. This adds to a growing body of
findings that fail to support the social role explanation for sex
differences (Bendixen, 2014; Bendixen & Kennair, 2015;
Bendixen, Kennair, Ringheim, et al., 2015; Fernandes, Ken-
nair, Hutz, Natividade, & Kruger, 2015; Grøntvedt & Kennair,
2013; Kennair, Nordeide, Andreassen, Strønen, & Pallesen,
2011; Kennair et al., 2009).
As expected, women worried more than men about having
had casual sex (Hypothesis 3, part 1), but these sex differences
were generally modest, and much smaller than for sociosexual
orientation and from physical gratification from sex. Galperin
and colleagues (2013) suggested that women's increased worry
about pregnancy might account for sex differences in casual
sex regret. We considered two other domains of worry--worry
about sexual reputation and worry about STIs and neither
accounted for the sex difference. Hence, we found no support
for the second part of Hypothesis 3.
Galperin et al. also hypothesized that women's increased regret
about experiencing casual sex may be due to less sexual gratifica-
tion experienced in these sorts of encounters. We did find than
women reported markedly lower levels of physical gratification
from casual sex (statistically fully accounting for the sex differ-
ence), but sexual gratification showed similar association with
regret about having had casual sex for both women and men. Men
have less regret and higher gratification than women, but individ-
ualswithineachsexshowthe same pattern.Inshort,thehypothesis
that sex differences in casual sex regret are due to women experi-
encing less sexual gratification than men was not supported.
There were very clear sex differences in SOI. The differences
were largest for the attitude and desire subscales of SOI. SOI
showed a similar association with casual sex regret within each
sex. Men have a less restricted SOI, and thus less regret, but
those men with the most restricted SOI scores show the most
sexual regret. The same pattern is found for women: Unrestricted
women report less regret; restricted women report most regret.
Although SOI accounted for the sex difference in regret statis-
tically, any hypothesis that sex differences in casual sex regret is
due to individual differences in sociosexuality is questionable.
Wheninvestigatingsexdifferences,oneneedstoavoidnaively
controlling for other fundamental aspects of being male or being
female. Anything that is highly correlated with sex, when statis-
tically controlled, will remove any statistical effect of sex. As an
analogy, when predicting sex differences in upper body muscle
mass, statistically controlling for height would remove any effect
of sex--the proverbial throwing the baby out with the bath water.
Concluding that there is no effect of sex after controlling for SOI
or physical gratification would therefore be misguided (Schmitt
et al., 2012). Abundant evidence suggests that the large sex dif-
ferences in these variables are evolved sex differences--men's
short-term mating looms larger in their motivational priorities
than does women's (Buss, 2016; Schmitt & 118 Members of the
International Sexuality Description Project, 2003).
Worrying more about reputation, experiencing less sexual
pleasure, having low levels of sexual desire, and expressing
attitudes disapproving of uncommitted sex all predicted
higher levels of casual sex regret for women. For men, low
levels of sexual pleasure and desire predicted casual sex
regret. The novel model of understanding sex differences
we present in this article suggests that there are fundamental
sex differences in casual sex decisions that are attenuated or
intensified in a similar manner by largely similar processes for
both men and women.
Predicting regret associated with having passed up casual
sex opportunities beyond the effect of biological sex is murkier.
Despite a general expectation that this would to a large degree
mirror factors related to regret of having had casual sex, we did
not hypothesize about the outcomes. Biological sex is the prin-
cipal predictor in regretting passing up sexual opportunities;
men are far more likely than women to regret passing up casual
sex. General worry about sexual reputation in relation to casual
sex predicted lower levels of regret passing up in both sexes,
but for women, unrestricted attitudes accounted for most of this
effect. A possible interpretation of this could be that there was
an association between less sex-typical responses. Apparently,
women whose sexual strategy attitudes are less restricted expe-
rience more regret about passing up sexual opportunities com-
pared to sexually restricted women.
Study Limitations and Future Research
Four possible limitations can be identified in this study. First,
the nature of the cross-sectional design does not allow to
Kennair et al. 7
directly address or to make strong inferences about what factors
may cause sexual regret. However, we believe the inclusion of
a number of proximate predictors in the study allows for a
better understanding of psychological processes influencing
sexual regret in men and women. Second, the reliabilities of
our measures of worry and physical gratification remain
unknown as single items were applied for these proximate
predictors. Future studies may benefit from multiple item
scales. Third, although the use of student samples usually rep-
resents obvious limitations with regard to generalizations to
other populations, the close reproduction of central methodo-
logical aspects of Galperin et al.'s study (including the outcome
variables and the type of sample) allows for a more direct
comparison of the sex effects across samples. Finally, to
address effects of gender egalitarianism on sexual regret, we
need to add data points from several cultures, including cul-
tures/nations ranking in the lower end on gender equality
indexes. Obviously, merely testing in one extra culture is not
enough to address the overall effect of culture on sexual regret.
On the other hand, no similarity between Galperin et al.'s
(2013) and the current findings would have weakened the idea
that sex differences in sexual regret are universal. The similar-
ity we found weakens social role theory.
Future research could expand the search for proximate psy-
chological predictors of sexual regret. First, although we
assessed worry about sexual reputation, STIs, and pregnancy,
future work could explore those who have actually experienced
these negative sequelae of casual sex. Do people who actually
contract an STI or experience damage to their social reputations,
for example, experience greater regret from casual sex? Addi-
tional candidate predictors include sexual disgust, moral disgust,
and pathogen disgust (Tybur, Lieberman, & Griskevicius, 2009).
The greater disgust sensitivity among women in the sexual
domain, for example, may be linked to sex differences in sexual
regret. Individual differences in disgust sensitivity might also
explain some proportion of within-sex variance in sexual regret.
Because women are more likely to have experienced sexual
coercion and pressure to have casual sex (Meston & Buss,
2007), those experiences may influence regret about having had
casual sex--another hypothesis that awaits future research.
Conclusions
Our first goal centered on whether sex differences in sexual
regret would be found in a culture that stands out as among the
most sexually liberal, secularized, and gender egalitarian cul-
tures in the world. The findings suggest that women report
regretting their last casual sex experience moderately more than
men do and men report regretting markedly more having passed
up their last chance to have casual sex. These sex differences
show no evidence of diminution in this sexually liberal, secular-
ized, and highly gender egalitarian culture compared to those
found in the original study, mirroring findings of sex differences
in other mating domains, such as sexual jealousy, sexual mis-
perception, and age preferences for mates, in Norwegian
samples (Bendixen, 2014; Bendixen & Kennair, 2015; Bend-
ixen, Kennair, & Buss, 2015; Grøntvedt & Kennair, 2013).
Our second goal focused on proximate predictors that might
account for sex differences in sexual regret--notably, worries
about pregnancy, STIs, and reputation as well as physical grat-
ification experienced during the sexual encounter. We found
robust sex differences on all these variables. Women, on aver-
age, worried more about negative consequences and experienced
less physical gratification from casual sexual encounters. None-
theless, our analyses suggest that the sex difference in sexual
regret is not accounted for these potential proximate predictors.
We had greater success in predicting within-sex differences in
sexual regret for men and women. Low sexual gratification was
associated with more sexual regret within both sexes, and indi-
viduals with a more restricted sociosexual orientation reported
more sexual regret. Worry about sexual reputation was positively
associated with sexual regret for women only. In short, we have
established the first empirical evidence for key psychological
predictors of sexual regret within women and men.
Taken together, the findings from the current study add to a
deeper understanding of the robustness of sex differences
across cultures and a deeper understanding of why individuals
within each sex experience more or less sexual regret in the
domain of casual sex encounters.
