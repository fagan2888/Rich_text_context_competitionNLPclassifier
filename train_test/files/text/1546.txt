The association between dementia and education was studied in 143 twin pairs discordant for dementia, using a
matched-pair design, and in 221 dementia cases and 442 unrelated controls from the same twin registry, using a
case-control design. Low education was defined as 6 years or less of schooling. Case-control analyses with preva-
lent cases showed low education to be a risk for Alzheimer's disease but not dementia in general. Low education
did not significantly predict incident cases. In the matched-pairs analysis, which controls for genetic and other fa-
milial influences, differences in education between demented twins and twin partners were not statistically signif-
icant. However, for Alzheimer's disease, odds ratios resulting from matched pairs and case-control analyses were
similar. Twins' comparative reports about intellectual involvement earlier in their lives suggest a long-standing
difference on this dimension, with less involvement by the twin who became demented.
HE discovery that Alzheimer's disease occurs more
frequently among those with low educational attain-
ment opened new questions about disease mechanisms.
Low education is now generally included on lists of estab-
lished risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (e.g., Cummings,
Vinters, Cole, & Khachaturian, 1998). The first indications
that rates of dementia differed with level of education came
from population studies. Prevalence of dementia was
greater among those with low or no education, and preva-
lence of dementia was less among those with higher educa-
tion. For example, in the Shanghai study (Zhang et al.,
1990), illiteracy predicted higher rates of dementia. In the
Canadian Study of Health and Aging (1994), those with 6 or
fewer years of education had higher rates of Alzheimer's
disease than did those with 10 or more years. Other popula-
tion studies of prevalent cases have confirmed this relation-
ship (Dartigues et al., 1991; Kokmen, Beard, O'Brien, &
Kurland, 1993; Ott et al., 1995; Precipe, Casini, Ferretti,
Lattanzio, Fiorelli, & Culasso, 1996; Yamada et al., 1999),
and various case-control series have replicated the observa-
tion that low education is a significant risk factor (e.g., Mor-
tel, Meyer, Herod, & Thornby, 1995).
More recently, there have been follow-ups of several
large population-based samples to identify incident demen-
tia cases, and education has again been examined as a risk
factor. For example, in a longitudinal follow up in East Bos-
ton, Massachusetts, Evans and colleagues (1997) reported
that low education was a significant predictor of incident
Alzheimer's disease, and Nielsen, Lolk, Andersen, Ander-
sen, and Kragh-Sorensen (1999) found low education pre-
dicted incident Alzheimer's disease in the Odense study. In
the pooled EURODEM analyses of incident cases, lower
education was a significant risk factor, especially in women
(Launer et al., 1999). Several authors of incidence studies
have reported similar findings (Ott, Van Rossum, Van Har-
skamp, Van de Mheen, Hofman, & Breteler, 1999; Stern,
Gurland, Tatemichi, Tang, Wilder, & Mayeux, 1994; Zhang,
Katzman, Yu, Liu, Xiao, & Yan, 1998).
Other findings imply a more complex relationship be-
tween education and dementia. Some studies--both of prev-
alent cases and of incident cases--have found education to
be a risk factor for some dementias but not all dementias. In
the Kungsholmen study in Sweden, Fratiglioni et al. (1991)
found low education to be a significant risk factor only for
all dementias combined, but not for Alzheimer's disease
alone. In the Framingham study, Cobb, Wolf, Au, White,
and D'Agostino (1995) found that education was a signifi-
cant risk factor for incidence only of dementias other than
Alzheimer's disease, largely vascular dementia. The authors
speculated that the critical mechanism revolved around bad
health habits associated with lower education, such as smok-
ing and poor diet, because these bad health habits would be
risk factors for stroke and for vascular dementias.
Some reports have suggested that the education effect de-
pends on which levels of education are compared. For ex-
ample, in an Italian study, DeRonchi, Fratiglioni, Rucci, Pa-
ternico, Graziani, and Dalmonte (1998) found that having
no formal education was a significant risk, but there was no
significant difference in dementia or Alzheimer's disease
prevalence when comparing those with up to 3 years of edu-
cation with those with 3 or more years.
Other studies--largely incidence studies or prevalence
studies in developing areas of the world--have found no re-
lationship between dementia and education. In the Roches-
ter Epidemiology Project, which was based on incident
cases identified from medical records, there was no signifi-
T
EDUCATION AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE P293
cant association between dementia and education when
comparing those with less than 9 years of education to those
with 9 years or more (Kokmen, Beard, O'Brien, & Kurland,
1996). In the Indo-US study (Chandra, Ganguli, Pandav,
Johnston, Belle, & DeKosky, 1998), there was no associa-
tion between prevalence of dementia and illiteracy, nor did
dementia prevalence relate to education in the Assiut-Upper
Egypt study (Farrag, Farwiz, Khedr, Mahfouz, & Omran,
1998) or in Nigeria (Hall et al., 1998).
The conclusion across these projects is that low education
is most relevant to predicting dementia in studies of preva-
lent cases in populations that include people with quite low
or no education, especially if low education is compared
with high education. The education effect is reduced if age
is controlled for, is less in incidence studies than in preva-
lence studies, and is generally less for Alzheimer's disease
alone than for all dementias.
There are four views about the reason that education might
be related to dementia: cognitive reserve, "use it or lose it,"
education as a proxy for other exposures, and diagnostic bias.
Cognitive Reserve
The construct of cognitive reserve (see, e.g., Mortimer,
1997; Satz, 1993) offers a conceptual framework for dis-
cussing the education­dementia relationship. In this view,
dementia is observed clinically after cognitive reserve is de-
pleted to some threshold. Less initial cognitive reserve
would imply that smaller changes would be required to
bring the individual to the threshold at which impairment
would be evident, whereas greater cognitive reserve would
presumably afford greater protection against dementia. In
this theory, cognitive reserve could reflect either innate dif-
ferences in cognitive capacities or better early brain matura-
tion (for example, in relation to maternal and infant nutri-
tion). In either event, educational attainment would be an
indicator of greater cognitive reserve.
Bidzan and Ussorowska (1995) looked at unfavorable en-
vironmental factors during childhood, such as low family
income, that they posited to indicate negative influences on
early brain development and found that these factors were
more prominent among groups with dementia than among
control groups. Mortimer and colleagues (Mortimer, Fort-
ier, Rajaram, & Gauvreau, 1998) found that, among adults
who had siblings with dementia, those who grew up in so-
cioeconomically disadvantaged circumstances had a higher
risk of Alzheimer's disease themselves. More recently,
Moceri, Kukull, Emanuel, van Belle, and Larson (2000) re-
ported that various indicators of early-life socioeconomic
level (greater number of siblings, area of residence as a
child) were related to greater risk of Alzheimer's disease.
The cognitive-reserve line of thinking is also supported by
findings from the Nun study (Snowdon, Kemper, Mortimer,
Greiner, Wekstein, & Markesbery, 1996), in which the
complexity of thought in essays written in their early 20s
predicted which nuns later developed Alzheimer's disease.
Other research results have also supported the idea that in-
telligence might function as cognitive reserve (Stern, Alex-
ander, Prohovnik, & Mayeux, 1992). These authors showed
that, after they controlled for dementia severity, higher edu-
cation and estimated premorbid intellectual ability were
associated with greater impairment on tests of cerebral me-
tabolism. Although at first this finding might appear counter-
intuitive, the authors' interpretation is that intelligence mod-
erates clinical manifestation of cerebral pathology.
A further prediction based on the cognitive reserve model
is that the education­dementia relationship should be weaker
in cultures or cohorts for whom level of education is less di-
rectly reflective of intellectual capacities or, hence, of cogni-
tive reserve. For example, Hall et al. (1998) found that low
education was a risk factor in Indianapolis, Indiana, but not in
Nigeria, and Harwood and colleagues (1999) found that low
education was a risk factor for Whites but not for Hispanics.
Use It or Lose It
Some writers have discussed the possibility that mental
activity throughout adulthood can increase synaptic density,
whether through formal educational activities or through
cognitively challenging occupations or cognitively stimulat-
ing leisure activities (e.g., Katzman, 1993). The idea that
high education might be a protective factor has also re-
ceived support from animal studies associating mental stim-
ulation with dendritic complexity (Lucassen, Van Someren,
& Swaab, 1998) and from proposals of plausible neurobio-
logical mechanisms by which neuronal activation might
slow amyloid deposition (Friedland, 1993). In a finding
consistent with this line of reasoning, Fabrigoule, Leten-
neur, Dartigues, Zarrouk, Commenges, and Barberger-Gateau
(1995) found incidence of dementia was lower among those
who had participated in leisure activities such as traveling
or gardening. It is, of course, appealing to think that older
individuals might be able to prevent or to postpone onset of
dementia through remaining mentally active (see Orrell &
Sahakian, 1995).
Education as a Proxy
There has also been an interest in the possibility that edu-
cation might be indicative of other risk factors such as occu-
pational exposures or bad health habits, for example, alco-
hol use (Fratiglioni et al., 1991). However, DeRonchi et al.
(1998) found a residual education effect after controlling for
age, occupation, and smoking. Similarly, Evans and col-
leagues (1997) found independent contributions from edu-
cation and from low occupational prestige and low income.
Thus, whereas these other risk factors may increase odds of
developing dementia, they do not entirely explain the edu-
cation effect.
Diagnostic Bias
Finally, education might serve to teach the individual the
sorts of reasoning skills that are required by neuropsycho-
logical tests used in dementia assessments (Gilleard, 1997).
Here, education is sometimes regarded as a confounding
factor, requiring that norms on tests be adjusted for educa-
tion for the test to be a valid measure across different groups
of people (Stockton, Cohen-Mansfield, & Billig, 1998).
This explanation of the education­dementia relationship re-
ceives support from the observation that those with lower
education tend to have lower scores on neuropsychological
tests used in dementia assessment but not greater functional
deficits (Swanwick et al., 1999).

Twin Methods
Twin studies provide a vehicle for helping to sort out the
alternative mechanisms that might be involved in the asso-
ciation between education and dementia. A matched-pair
analysis takes twin pairs who are discordant for a disease
and evaluates whether the twin who was exposed to a given
risk factor is more often the twin with the disease. This de-
sign has the advantage of controlling for genetics, insofar as
identical twins share 100% of their genes and fraternal
twins share 50% of their segregating genes. In addition,
cases and controls are the same with respect to age and gen-
der (for like-sexed pairs), and they are similar with respect
to their environmental history. We know that twins are very
similar with respect to intellectual abilities, with up to 80% of
the variance in intellectual abilities explained by genetic effects
(Pedersen, Plomin, Nesselroade, & McClearn, 1992). Thus,
twins should be similar in their baseline cognitive reserve.
In one twin study that has examined education and
dementia, Räihä, Kaprio, Koskenvuo, Rajala, & Sourander
(1998) used twin pairs who were discordant for Alzheimer's
disease, determined by matching the Finnish Twin Registry
with a registry of diagnoses. Across 25 identical and 25 fra-
ternal pairs, higher education was related to reduced risk of
Alzheimer's disease.
The key question of interest in the present study was to
contrast a classical case-control analysis with a matched-
pair analysis. A classical case-control approach recruits
cases with dementia and controls without dementia from a
similar population. The analysis tests relative proportions of
cases compared with controls who experience a particular
risk factor, for example, low education. We hypothesized
that low education would be a significant risk factor in a
classical case-control analysis, replicating previous find-
ings, whereas in the matched-pair analysis, by controlling
for familial influences on intellectual ability, we would not
find low education to be a significant risk factor. If this hy-
pothesis is supported, it is consistent with a cognitive-reserve
interpretation of the education­dementia relationship.
A third, more exploratory set of analyses was conducted
to provide suggestions with respect to possible meanings of
the education variable. Here we drew on twins' self-reported
comparisons of who got better grades in school, who read
more books, and who found learning to be easier. If these
variables differed between cases and their partners, it would
provide evidence for early differences in intellectual in-
volvement. Such a pattern would be consistent with an envi-
ronmentally mediated cognitive-reserve interpretation, but
also with use it or lose it.
In these analyses, we did not directly test whether educa-
tion relates to adult environmental exposures, and the role
of diagnostic bias is minimized insofar as diagnoses are not
based directly on test results but on functional deficits as well.
METHODS
Sample
Participants in the present study include members of the
Study of Dementia in Swedish Twins (Gatz et al., 1997) and
members of the OCTO-Twin study (McClearn et al., 1997).
Both studies represent defined subsamples of the popula-
tion-based Swedish Twin Registry. The Study of Dementia
in Swedish Twins identified dementia cases from the Swed-
ish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA; Pedersen et
al., 1991). SATSA includes all pairs from the twin registry
who indicated having been reared apart and a matched sam-
ple who were reared together. Members of SATSA have
been surveyed by mail-out questionnaires every 3 years
since 1984, and complete pairs aged 50 and older have par-
ticipated in in-person cognitive and health assessments on a
3-year rolling schedule. For purposes of the dementia study,
all twins identified for the SATSA sample born in 1935 or
previously were included, if one or both members of the
pair were alive in 1987, whether or not they had responded
to SATSA data collection efforts (N  1,978). Baseline
screening took place in 1987 and 1988, with the final 20%
completed by 1991, and incident cases were identified at
each additional data collection.
The OCTO-Twin study enrolled all twin pairs 80 years
old and older if both members of the pair were alive during
the first wave of data collection in 1991­1994 (N  702).
Four subsequent waves of in-person assessment were sched-
uled at 2-year intervals. Cases of dementia were identified
at the first three waves.
The present study included all cases, both those identified
initially (prevalent cases) and new cases of dementia identi-
fied longitudinally (incident cases).
Procedures.--Case ascertainment from the SATSA sam-
ple used a two-stage process (see Gatz et al., 1997). Partici-
pants were screened for dementia using either the Mini-
Mental State Examination (MMSE; Folstein, Folstein, &
McHugh, 1975) during an in-person visit or a telephone
screening protocol (Gatz, Reynolds, Nikolic, Lowe, Karel,
& Pedersen, 1995) for those not seen in person. Those scor-
ing below established cutoffs were identified as suspected
cases of dementia and referred for evaluation by an assess-
ment team employing a nurse, a psychologist, and a physi-
cian. The protocol parallels Consortium to Establish a Reg-
istry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) procedures for
physical and neurological evaluations, laboratory tests, neu-
ropsychological testing, and neuroimaging (Morris et al.,
1989). Findings were presented at a consensus diagnosis
conference, attended by the clinicians and chaired by a psy-
chologist who had not met the twin. Diagnoses were as-
signed following Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, 3rd ed., rev. (American Psychiatric
Association, 1987) criteria for dementia, NINCDS/ADRDA
criteria for probable and possible Alzheimer's disease
(McKhann et al., 1984), and--once available--NINDS­
AIREN criteria for vascular dementia (Roman et al., 1993).
Twin partners of participants were given an identical clinical
work-up. If the partners were deceased, their diagnostic as-
sessment included informant interviews and review of med-
ical records, including death certificates. Cases and partners
were followed longitudinally every 18 months, with post-
mortem neuropathological examination for any who died.
Autopsy confirmation of diagnosis was available for 24 cases.
Case ascertainment from the OCTO-Twin sample en-
tailed a review of MMSE scores and cognitive performance
information collected from all twins, whether or not de-
EDUCATION AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE P295
mented. The battery paralleled that used with the suspected
dementia cases from SATSA. For those suspected of de-
mentia, informant interviews were conducted using the
same protocol as for the SATSA twins, medical records
were reviewed, and a consensus diagnosis assigned by a
physician and a psychologist (Boo Johansson). Boo Johans-
son also chaired the diagnostic conferences for both samples.
Differences in case ascertainment between the two sam-
ples include the following: (a) SATSA twins include pairs
reared apart as well as pairs reared together, whereas OCTO
twins were reared together; (b) in OCTO-Twin, both mem-
bers of the pair had to be alive at age 80, whereas SATSA
twins were included if dementia status could be established
for both members of the pair; (c) nonresponders to OCTO-
twin cognitive testing were lost to dementia study, whereas
nonresponders to SATSA data collection were telephoned
for dementia screening; and (d) a SATSA twin whose in-
person MMSE was below cutoff could refuse further work-
up, whereas an OCTO twin whose cognitive testing was im-
paired could be presented for consensus diagnosis. These
differences could result in disparate, competing, but un-
known diagnostic biases across twin pairs, although few dif-
ferences that should be differential within twin pairs.
Longitudinal follow up of both the SATSA and OCTO-
Twin samples provided additional waves of screening and
a means to identify incident cases. One individual who
screened negative was found to be demented at a later wave
and was deemed a false negative because age of onset was
earlier than the baseline screening. This pair is not in the
matched-pairs analysis.
Sample for Matched-Pairs Analysis
The prevalent matched-pair analyses included pairs dis-
cordant for dementia at first assessment, excluding pairs
whose co-twin died before the participant's age of onset.
For incident matched-pairs analysis, we identified a base-
line sample of pairs in which both members of the pair were
cognitively intact at the first data collection, either the
screening of the SATSA sample for dementia or the first
wave of OCTO-Twin. Incident cases are those new cases of
dementia from within these pairs. Pairs were defined as dis-
cordant if one member of the pair developed dementia while
the other member of the pair remained intact through the
same duration of follow up, or longer. To assure that inci-
dent cases were truly incident and were not false negatives
at baseline screening, we obtained age at onset of incident
cases without knowledge of prior screening date or out-
come. These ages were checked to ensure that onset oc-
curred subsequent to baseline screening.
Using these procedures, we found 143 pairs discordant
for dementia--77 prevalent and 66 incident. Forty-eight
pairs (62%) were discordant for prevalent Alzheimer's dis-
ease (the participant had had definite, probable, or possible
Alzheimer's disease, whereas the partner was cognitively
intact). The other cases were diagnosed with vascular de-
mentia or mixed Alzheimer's and vascular pathology (29%),
secondary dementia (4%), or dementia of uncertain etiology
(5%). Zygosity was originally determined by a question-
naire and then confirmed serologically. All pairs were of the
same sex. Zygosity, gender, and age of onset for prevalent
and incident cases are shown in Table 1.
Sample for Classical Case-Control Analysis
The classical case-control analysis compared dementia
cases with unrelated controls. If both members of a pair
were demented, one was randomly included. The pool from
which controls were drawn was obtained by selecting one
member of each twin pair in SATSA or OCTO-Twin for
which both members of the pair were cognitively intact.
Two unrelated controls were selected for each case, match-
ing for gender and age, within 5-year agebands. Age was
based on age of onset for cases and age at visit for controls.
For these purposes, there were a total of 131 prevalent cases
of dementia who were compared with a control sample of
262; 77 of these cases constituted the Alzheimer's disease
sample. We compared a total of 90 incident cases of de-
mentia with a control sample of 180; 54 of these cases con-
stituted the Alzheimer's disease sample. Throughout this
process, all dependencies were removed from the data. Zy-
gosity, gender, and age of onset for prevalent and incident
cases are shown in Table 1.
Measures
Education.--Education was collected as a five-category
variable: (1) elementary school, meaning 6 years, (2) sec-
ondary school, (3) vocational school or adult high school,
(4) "gymnasium," and (5) university. For all of our analy-
ses, we collapsed education into two categories: elementary
or less schooling compared with greater than elementary
schooling. In Sweden in the early 20th century, 6 years of
education was mandatory, so virtually no one had less than

6 years of education, and the vast majority of the population
stopped school at this point. Information about education
was collected for the SATSA panel from the 1984 question-
naire or, for those who did not answer the questionnaire,
from the individual or a proxy at the time of the clinical
workup. For OCTO-Twin, information about education came
from the 1992 interview. We also were able to fill in miss-
ing data and cross-check against information in the Swedish
Twin Registry collected in 1963. Thus, in the sample of 134
discordant pairs, information about education was available
for both members of 129 pairs.
Comparative risk.--We obtained answers to five ques-
tions about grades in school and reading for pleasure from
the twins in the SATSA sample only, using a comparative
report format in which twins were asked, "Before age 20,
who read more books or read more frequently?" "As an
adult, who read more books or read more frequently?"
"Who had better grades in school?" "Who found learning in
school to be easier?" and "Whose ability to find their way in
unfamiliar surroundings was better?" Response options in-
cluded "me," "my twin," "equally as much," and "don't
know." This strategy, devised by Mack (Hamilton & Mack,
2000), avoids some of the pitfalls of recall measures, as it is
easier for siblings to remember who did something more
than it is to remember absolute numbers. Data were either
collected at the time of the dementia assessment, only from
the cognitively intact member of the pair, or in 1992 from
all members of the SATSA sample, including those who
might later be included in the Study of Dementia in Swedish
Twins. Information was available from 17 cases and 37
partners. Twin pairs who were reared apart tended not to an-
swer this questionnaire. For 12 of the cases, information
came from both case and partner. There were no instances
in which the twins disagreed, for example, both saying
"me" or both saying "my twin." Information from cases and
partners was therefore combined and scored for whether
case or control had greater exposure. In other words, if ei-
ther twin answered, the data were used. If both twins an-
swered, the consensus answer was used. For these purposes,
answers of "equally as much" or "don't know" were treated
the same as missing data.
Analyses
For the classical case-control analysis, we estimated the
association between education and disease through the odds
ratio, comparing proportion with low education in cases and
in controls. In addition, a logistic regression model was
used to adjust for ageband and gender. For the matched-pair
analysis, odds ratio estimates of relative risk were calcu-
lated using McNemar's test, with 95% confidence intervals.
The odds ratio indexes the magnitude by which low educa-
tion magnifies risk. An odds ratio near 1.0 would indicate
that education was not a significant risk factor.
For the analyses using comparative reports, the result
took the form of percentage of cases and percentage of part-
ners experiencing an exposure, and 95% confidence inter-
vals were constructed around the percentage of cases. A
finding that significantly less than 50% of cases experi-
enced the exposure would be evidence of a protective effect
associated with the activity.
RESULTS
Classical Case-Control Analysis
Results are summarized in Table 2 for the odds ratios. In
prevalent cases, low education is a significant risk for Alz-
heimer's disease but not for all dementias. Logistic regression
results (in the far right column of Table 2) show that includ-
ing ageband, gender, and education in the model indicated
no age or gender effect, but the significant effect remained for
low education as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease alone.
For incident cases, however, neither the odds ratio for all
dementias nor for Alzheimer's disease alone was significant.
Matched-Pair Analyses
Results, summarized in Table 3, show that no odds ratio
was statistically significant. The conclusion here is that
there is not a significantly greater chance for the less edu-
cated partner to have either dementia in general or to have
Alzheimer's disease. If there is a trend in the data, it is a
greater effect for low education with respect to Alzheimer's
disease than to the combined dementia category.
Results did not differ when examined separately by gen-
der, rearing status, or zygosity (not included in Table 3).
The only suggestive difference with respect to zygosity was
that in the analysis of incident Alzheimer's disease, three of
the four pairs for whom the case had lower education were
monozygotic, and there were no monozygotic pairs for
whom the partner had lower education. Thus, it appears that
that inclusion of dizygotic pairs was not the explanation for
the larger than expected odds ratios for Alzheimer's disease.

EDUCATION AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE P297
Twins' Comparative Reports of Intellectual Involvement
The comparative risk results provided in Table 4 showed
a pattern suggesting that the twin who later became de-
mented had less intellectual involvement earlier in life.
There were statistically significant differences with respect
to reading fewer books as an adult and finding one's way in
unfamiliar surroundings less well. There were no significant
differences with respect to grades or ease of learning.
DISCUSSION
Analyses were conducted to test the prediction that low
education would be a significant risk factor for dementia us-
ing a classical case-control design, whereas a matched-pairs
analysis would not find low education to be a significant
risk factor. The basis for such a prediction is the assumption
that educational attainment largely reflects cognitive re-
serve, in particular, genetic influences on cognitive abilities.
This prediction, however, received equivocal support. Our
ability to resolve alternative explanations of the meaning of
low education was, in turn, limited by restricted power that
essentially reflected twin similarity in cognitive reserve.
The findings from the prevalent, or cross-sectional, case-
control analyses comport with the conclusion from many
previous studies that low education is a risk factor for de-
mentia, whereas higher education is associated with protec-
tion. Some previous reports have suggested that the educa-
tion effect is more pronounced for all dementias or for
dementias other than Alzheimer's disease (e.g., Cobb et al.,
1995). This was not found in our material, in which results
were significant only for Alzheimer's disease considered
alone and not for all dementias. Consistent with Kokmen
and colleagues (1996) and Ott and colleagues (1999), but
not with Launer and colleagues (1999), low education was
not a significant risk factor when incident cases of Alz-
heimer's disease or all dementias were considered. How-
ever, we observed similar odds ratios for prevalent and inci-
dent Alzheimer's disease, and differences in confidence
intervals in part reflect sample size.
In our material, the 2.22 odds ratio for prevalent Alz-
heimer's disease was statistically significant but smaller
than has been observed in other studies. For example, an
odds ratio of 4.00 was reported for a Canadian sample (Ca-
nadian Study of Health and Aging, 1994), an odds ratio of
3.49 for a sample from Indianapolis, Indiana (Hall et al.,
1998), and an odds ratio of 4.7 for an Italian sample
(DeRonchi et al., 1998). Of these, only the Canadian sample
had a larger number of cases than the Swedish sample. The
difference may reflect rather small amount of variability in
education among Swedish adults born before 1925. Also,
the country was at that time very poor economically, and
these social circumstances meant that few were allowed to
obtain an education that might correspond with their intel-
lectual abilities. Although speculative, this outcome is com-
patible with the cognitive reserve model, which would predict
a weaker education­dementia relationship in a population
or cohort in which education was less directly reflective of
intellectual capacities.
The comparison built into this study is between these
case-control results and the matched-pairs analyses. Matched-
pairs analyses control for genetic and other familial influ-
ences. As predicted, we found that education was not signif-
icantly different in cases compared with their twin partners.
For all dementias, the odds ratio for both prevalent and inci-

dent pairs was close to 1.0. For prevalent cases of Alzhei-
mer's disease, however, the proportion of cases with low
education was greater than the proportion of partners with
low education, with about the same point estimate for the
odds ratio as was found for the case-control design. The
odds ratio was not significant because of a lack of statistical
power. In other words, in the few pairs in which there was a
difference in attained education, the matched-pairs results
suggest an effect of education that is not explained by ge-
netic or shared environmental influences.
From our previous work with the Swedish twin samples,
we know that twins are highly similar on a composite of
cognitive abilities, and that this similarity reflects a large
proportion of genetic influences (Pedersen et al., 1992). We
have previously reported in a larger sample of nondemented
twins that the correlation between education and MMSE
scores can be best explained by common genetic factors
shared with cognitive abilities, and that, in turn, these ge-
netic factors also explain the correlation between cognitive
abilities and education and MMSE scores (Pedersen, Rey-
nolds, & Gatz, 1996). However, for women, there was
greater environmental than genetic mediation of the MMSE­
education correlation. This observation and the results from
the present study point to nongenetic as well as genetic con-
tributors to cognitive reserve.
There has been one prior report of education as a risk fac-
tor for Alzheimer's disease in a twin sample. Results from
the present study appear comparable to those previously re-
ported by Räihä and colleagues (1998) from the Finnish
Twin Registry. In the Finnish study, there are unknown se-
lection effects, as information about education was obtained
from only two-thirds of the discordant pairs and cases were
ascertained only by record linkage, which is likely to miss
up to half of cases (Gatz & Pedersen, 1996). There were
more pairs in the Swedish sample, but less discordance for
education.
The comparative-risk findings in the present study lead to
the interpretation that differences in intellectual involve-
ment already present earlier in life are important for demen-
tia. These findings are consistent with the Nun study
(Snowdon et al., 1996), in which differences in linguistic
complexity were obvious earlier in life between those who
later became demented and those who did not. Our results
cannot rule out the idea that lifelong intellectual engage-
ment--use it or lose it--can make a difference. We would,
however, hazard that those individuals already higher in
cognitive reserve may also be more likely to engage intel-
lectually. Thus, if there are two processes, they may work in
tandem, and cognitive reserve might be viewed as a joint
and probably interacting function of both genetic and envi-
ronmental influences.
Key limitations to this study are the small number of
pairs discordant for education and the limited amount of
variability on education. It has previously been reported that
twin pairs in SATSA tend to be similar for education (Lich-
tenstein, Pedersen, & McClearn, 1992). In the sample in the
present study, pairs were highly alike for education (tetra-
choric correlation  .71). Those pairs who were dissimilar
for education did not differ from other pairs with respect to
whether they were reared together or apart. In addition, 74%
had low education, making it quite probable that any two in-
dividuals would be comparable for education. The matched-
pairs analyses were based on the pairs discordant for both
education and disease. Thus, the great similarity for educa-
tion reduced the number of pairs available for comparison.
Although the odds ratio was not affected, confidence inter-
vals became large.
In addition, these matched pairs could be regarded as
"overmatched," as twin pairs are similar on many other
variables, for example, choice of occupation. Thus, the
matched-pair design may be overcontrolling for other vari-
ables for which education is a proxy.
Additionally, the discordant pairs included both monozy-
gotic and dizygotic pairs; thus, genetic effects were imper-
fectly controlled for. There were not a sufficient number of
monozygotic pairs for an analysis based on them alone. For
the matched-pair design, there must be twin pairs discordant
for both the disease and the exposure of interest. In the prev-
alent sample, for example, there was only one monozygotic
pair discordant for both Alzheimer's disease and education.
For this reason, it should be emphasized that the matched-
pair design controls for familial effects, including some ge-
netic and some shared rearing influences.
The comparative-risk analyses have the same sample size
considerations as the matched-pairs analyses. In addition,
there could be concern about retrospective bias, in which
twins would tend to avoid attributing an unfavorable quality
to themselves, or in which cognitively intact twins would
tend to attribute negative intellectual qualities to the mem-
ber of the pair who became demented. We were able to de-
termine within this sample that, if both members of the pair
did reply to the questionnaire, they did not disagree on these
items. The data included some questionnaires that were
completed before onset of dementia in either twin; unfortu-
nately, not all of the data were prospective. Moreover, the
items that did significantly discriminate were, if anything,
less loaded with social desirability than the items that did
not discriminate.
In conclusion, in applying a case-control design with un-
related controls, the results provided a replication of low ed-
ucation as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease but not for
all dementias. A matched pairs design that controls for fa-
milial effects, including genetically mediated characteris-
tics, showed similar estimates of risk, but these were non-
significant because of lack of power. The lack of power
stemmed from high heritability of cognitive abilities and
high similarity of educational attainment in twin pairs, with
similarity of educational attainment to a great extent reflect-
ing similarity in cognitive abilities. In the few pairs discor-
dant for education, there was a nonsignificant tendency for
twins with Alzheimer's disease to have less education than
their cognitively intact partners. The comparative twin find-
ings also suggest that intellectual involvement contributes
to cognitive reserve. Taken together, these findings support
threshold theories that emphasize the relevance of cognitive
reserve as protecting from dementia.
