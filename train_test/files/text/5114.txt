Abstract
Objective: We aimed to determine the capacity of drug-eluting stent (DES) over-expansion in left
main coronary artery disease.
Methods: Left main interventions with the largest available DES platforms (4.0 mm) and post-
dilation performed with large non-compliant balloons (! 4.5 mm) were included. Maximal stent
diameter (mm) and area (mm2) were measured using post-intervention intravascular ultrasound
(IVUS). Stent diameter and area were calculated with the balloon diameter and inflation pressure.
The diameter and area expansion indices were defined as follows: maximal/calculated stent
diameter and maximal/calculated stent area, respectively.
Results: Twenty-three consecutive patients were included. The maximal stent diameter was
4.40 mm (4.30­4.80 mm), and 22 of 23 patients showed a diameter expansion index greater than
0.90. The area expansion index was 0.862. The expansion index < 0.85 group had a significantly
higher percentage of calcification ! 90 on IVUS than did the expansion index ! 0.85 group (72.7%
versus 16.7%, P ¼ 0.007). One stent fracture occurred during over-expansion and one ischemic
event occurred during follow-up.
Conclusions: DESs with a nominal diameter of 4.0 mm can be effectively over-expanded in left
main coronary artery disease. Achievement of predicted stent area can be affected by calcification.

Introduction
The left main coronary artery (LMCA) is
the initial portion of the left coronary artery
circulation, which supplies the majority of
the left ventricle. Significant LMCA disease,
which is commonly defined as narrowing of
the luminal diameter of greater than 50%,
is considered the highest risk coronary
artery disease subtype and is associated
with a poorer prognosis than non-LMCA
disease.1 Before the era of drug-eluting
stents (DESs), percutaneous interventions
involving the LMCA were associated with
considerable risks of acute complications
and early mortality,2,3 as well as long-term
restenosis.4 Therefore, for the last several
decades, coronary artery bypass grafting
(CABG) has been the standard revascular-
ization treatment for LMCA lesions.
The results of recent, randomized, con-
trolled, trials have shown that the perform-
ance of PCI with DESs has comparable
cardiac adverse event rates with those of
CABG in patients with LMCA disease,
especially in patients with less anatomically
complex lesions.5­9 On the basis of these
favourable findings, the current guidelines
recommend performing PCI as an alterna-
tive revascularization strategy for treatment
of LMCA lesions with low or intermediate
anatomic complexity (Class II).10,11
One of the major issues associated with
LMCA PCI procedures is the large reference
diameter of the left main stem. Several
intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) studies
have shown that the maximal LMCA diam-
eter can be up to 4.8­5.5 mm,12,13 while the
maximal diameter of most commercially
available DESs is 4.0 mm. Stent over-
expansion with larger post-dilation balloons
may be the only method of reducing the risk
of incomplete stent apposition. The over-
expansion capacity of contemporary DES
platforms has been thoroughly investigated
in several in vitro studies,14­16 while in vivo
data regarding this phenomenon are still
limited. Therefore, we aimed to determine
the efficacy and safety of over-expansion of
the current commercially available DESs
(4.0 mm) in patients with LMCA disease.
Materials and methods
This was a single-centre, retrospective study.
All PCIs performed between January 2013
and June 2016 were retrospectively reviewed
to identify the LM interventions that met the
following inclusion criteria: (1) interventions
performed on de novo LMCA lesions, (2)
interventions performed using DESs with a
nominal diameter of 4.0 mm, (3) interven-
tions involving post-dilation using non-
compliant balloons with a nominal diameter
of no less than 4.5 mm, (4) and interventions
in which IVUS measurements were per-
formed before stent deployment and after
the final post-dilation. The following inter-
ventions were excluded from the study: (1)
interventions involving use of the two-stent
technique for LM bifurcations and (2) inter-
ventions in which post-dilation was per-
formed with the kissing balloon technique.
The appropriate institutional review board
approved the study and informed consent
was obtained from each patient.
IVUS measurement protocol
All IVUS images were independently
reviewed and analysed by a skilled interven-
tional cardiologist who was blinded to the
nominal diameters and inflation pressure of
the post-dilation balloons. An Eagle EyeÕ
catheter (Volcano Europe BVBA, Brussels,
Belgium) was used for pre- and post-
interventional IVUS measurements. A total
of 100 mg of intracoronary nitroglycerin
was injected before each measurement.
The ultrasound images were recorded from
the left anterior descending or left circumflex
artery to the left main ostium. A validated
computer-based contour detection pro-
gram allowed semi-automatic detection of
the lumen, stent, and vessel boundaries in

IVUS data analysis
Quantitative analysis was performed accord-
ing to the American College of Cardiology
Clinical Expert Consensus Document on
Standards for Acquisition, Measurement
and Reporting of Intravascular Ultrasound
Studies.17 For the pre-interventional IVUS
measurements, the left main lesion segment
with the smallest luminal cross-sectional area
was selected, and the following parameters
were measured: (1) minimal lumen diameter
(mm), (2) minimal lumen area (mm2), and
(3) plaque burden. For the post-interven-
tional IVUS measurements, the left main in-
stent segment with the largest in-stent area
was selected, and the following parameters
were measured: (1) maximal stent diameter
(mm) and (2) maximal stent area (mm2).
Additionally, the left main in-stent segment
with the smallest in-stent area was selected
for measuring the minimum stent area
(mm2). We used the maximal stent diam-
eter/area mainly because it is more likely to
be affected by the plaque burden and plaque
components than by stent over-expansion
capability. Calcification was measured in
degrees using the semi-quantitative grading
method in the location of maximal stent area
measurement.17 Calcification was divided
into two categories: (1) < 90, less than one
quadrant; and (2) ! 90, no less than one
quadrant.
The predicted stent diameter (mm) was
calculated using the balloon diameter and
inflation pressure of the final post-dilation
based on the data provided by the manu-
facturers. The predicted stent area (mm2)
was defined as follows: p Â (predicted stent
diameter/2)2. The diameter expansion index
was defined as the ratio of the maximal stent
diameter to the predicted stent diameter
after post-dilation. The area expansion
index was defined as the ratio of the
maximal stent area to the predicted stent
area after post-dilation.
Statistical analyses
Categorical variables are shown as numbers
(percentages). Continuous data are shown
as medians (interquartile ranges). Spearman
correlation analysis was used to determine
the correlation between the maximal stent
diameter and predicted stent diameter, as
well as the correlation between the maximal/
minimal stent area and predicted stent area.
The Mann­Whitney U test and chi-square
test were used for intergroup comparison
of continuous and categorical variables,
respectively. The multiple regression model
was used to further determine the potential
factors associated with stent expansion.
Statistical analyses were performed with the
SPSS statistical software package (version
20.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and
GraphPad Prism (version 5.0, GraphPad
Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
Results
A total of 23 consecutive patients were
eligible for inclusion in this study. Most of
the patients were men and the median age of
the study population was 66 years. Acute
coronary syndrome was the major indica-
tion for PCI (87.0%) and most of the lesions
featured bifurcations (78.3%). The base-
line and angiographic characteristics of the
study population are summarized in Table 1.
Four commercially available DESs with the
largest stent platform were analysed, including
the PROMUS ElementTM (N ¼ 5), XIENCE
XpeditionTM (N¼ 8), Resolute EndeavorTM
(N ¼ 7), and PartnerTM (N¼ 3) stents.
The designs of these four DESs are shown in
Table 2.
All of the included patients' IVUS images
were suitable for analysis. The maximal
stent diameter was 4.40 mm (interquartile
range: 4.30­4.80 mm) (Figure 1(a)) and the
1408 Journal of International Medical Research 45(4)
maximal stent area was 14.0 mm (interquar-
tile range: 13.1­15.6 mm) (Figure 1(b)).
The diameter expansion index was 0.968
(interquartile range: 0.940­1.004), and 22 of
23 patients had diameter expansion indices
greater than 0.90 (Figure 1(c)). The maximal
stent diameter was linearly correlated
with the calculated stent diameter, with a
correlation coefficient of 0.718 (P < 0.001)
(Figure 2). However, the area expansion
index was only 0.862 (0.806­0.917). There
was also a linear correlation between the
maximal stent area and calculated stent area
(correlation coefficient: 0.562, P < 0.001)
(Figure 2). There was no significant associ-
ation between the minimal stent area and
calculated stent area (correlation coefficient:
0.38, P ¼ 0.073) (Appendix Figure 4)
According to the area expansion indices
of the patients, the patients were further
divided into the following two groups: the
expansion index ! 0.85 group (N ¼ 12) and
the expansion index < 0.85 group (N ¼ 11).
There were no significant differences in
LMCA lesion characteristics, minimal
lumen diameter/area before PCI, stent
length, stent deployment pressure, post-
dilation balloon diameter, and post-dilation

there was a significant difference in IVUS
calcification between the two groups.
Patients with an expansion index < 0.85
had a significantly higher calcification per-
centage ! 90 on IVUS than did patients
with an expansion index ! 0.85 (72.7%
versus 16.7%, P ¼ 0.007) (Table 3). In the
multiple regression model, calcification
(!90) was still significantly associated
with a lower expansion index (< 0.85),
even after adjustment for bifurcation lesions,
pre-intervention minimal lumen area, plaque
burden, post-dilation balloon size, and pres-
sure (B ¼ 4.056, P ¼ 0.046).
Only one adverse event occurred during
the over-expansion process. This event
occurred in a 50-year-old patient with
isolated stenosis of the LMCA ostium. A
PROMUS Element stent (4.0 mm Â 16 mm)
was deployed at 16 atm after pre-dilation of
the lesion (Figure 3(a)). After post-dilation
with a Quantum 5.0-mm Â 8-mm stent at
16 atm (Figure 3(b)), the distal portion of

the stent fractured and the struts fell into the
lumen (Figure 3(c)), as confirmed by IVUS
(Figure 3(d), supplementary video). Another
PROMUS 4.0-mm Â 12-mm stent was
immediately implanted to cover the frac-
tured segment of the previous stent.
The medium follow-up duration was
16 months (6­27 months). One patient was
admitted for revascularization because of in-
stent restenosis of the target lesion.
Discussion
In this study, we attempted to determine the
over-expansion capacity of DESs with a
nominal diameter of 4.0 mm, as determined
by IVUS. Our major finding was that
over-expansion of DESs with post-dilation
(4.5­5.0-mm post-dilation balloon) could
effectively achieve the predicted stent diam-
eter. However, the predicted stent area
achievement varied, which could have been
due to the presence of calcification.
An in vitro study showed that most of the
current DES platforms could be over-
expanded above their nominal diameters.14
For DESs with the largest design (4.0 mm),
a maximal stent diameter > 5.5 mm could be
achieved using a 6.0-mm semi-compliant
balloon at 14 atm.14 However, the in vivo
behaviour of these stents during the over-
expansion process may vary considerably.
Interactions between stents and plaques/
arteries may cause recoil, deformation, and
fracture of stents. Previous studies have
shown that the magnitude of stent recoil
reported in vivo is significantly greater than
that reported in bench testing. In an in vivo
animal study (Yorkshire pigs), Carrozza
et al.18 found that stent recoil can reach up
to 30%, even after oversized post-dilation,
in normal and compliant coronary arteries.
Bermejo et al.19 found that elastic recoil was
one of the major mechanisms responsible for
residual luminal stenosis in patients with
coronary artery disease. Additionally, in
their study, the luminal dimensions after
stenting were only 57% of the maximal
achievable luminal dimensions after high-
pressure stent deployment, which was con-
firmed by subsequent studies.20,21 Therefore,
unlike previous in vitro studies,14,16 our
study provided direct in vivo evidence
regarding over-expansion in patients with
LMCA disease.
Notably, one adverse event involving an
acute severe stent fracture, which is a rare
complication of stent deployment, occurred

during over-expansion in our study.
PROMOUS Element stents use a helical
two-connector design to achieve maximal
flexibility. However, this design may jeopard-
ize the stability of the platform while the stent
is over-expanded. Therefore, the number of
connectors in PROMOUS PremierTM stents
has been increased to five (4.0mm platform)
in the proximal stent segment to enhance
radial strength. Although the findings of the
current in vitro study showed that current
DES platforms could be over-expanded to
achieve a maximal stent diameter > 5.5 mm,14
the following two points must be taken into
consideration. The first point is regarding
sample size. Only one stent for each platform
is usually tested. The second point is regard-
ing stent-plaque interactions. Plaque distri-
bution and components can lead to variations
in radial force in different parts of the stent
during over-expansion. Moreover, significant
crown deformation has been observed in
most of the platforms when a maximal stent
diameter >5.5 mm was achieved in vitro.14

the stent had fractured and that the struts had fallen into the lumen.
Ye et al. 1413
Therefore, DES over-expansion in vivo
should be applied with caution, especially
when using stents with a predicted diameter
> 5.0 mm.
The long-term outcome of DES over-
expansion in this population is still
unknown. Kuriyama et al.22 reported that
bare metal stent over-dilation resulted in a
larger intimal-luminal dimension
and provided a larger follow-up lumen.
Unfortunately, follow-up IVUS data were
not available in our study. Therefore, we
were unable to assess the effect of over-
expansion on intimal hyperplasia.
Our study has several limitations. First,
because of the small sample size of the study,
it may have been underpowered for detecting
other potential differences between two
groups. Second, as we mentioned above,
follow-up IVUS results were not available
for the patients who were included in this
study. Third, we could not assess the effect of
over-expansion on other DES parameters,
such as drug coating and delivery. Finally,
different stent types, and differences in lesion
location and preparation may also have
affected the final results of stent expansion.
Conclusion
The findings of our in vivo study indicate
that DESs with a nominal diameter of
4.0 mm can be over-expanded in patients
with LMCA disease. Achievement of the
predicted stent area can be affected by the
percentage of calcification. Stent fracture is
a potential complication of over-expansion
of stents in vivo.
