Attitudes Toward Secondhand Smoke, Smoking, and Quitting Among
Young People
Stanton A. Glantz, PhD*, and Patrick Jamieson, MS, Ed
ABSTRACT. Objective. To assess the impact of atti-
tudes toward secondhand smoke among young people.
Methods. Three hundred nonsmokers and 300 smok-
ers (smoked a cigarette in last 30 days) 14 through 22
years of age in the United States were surveyed with
random-digit dialing. The results of this cross-sectional
survey were analyzed using logistic regression to deter-
mine predictors of nonsmoking and intent to stop among
current smokers.
Results. Controlling for age, ethnicity, and education,
nonsmokers were more likely to consider smoking risky
than smokers (odds ratio [OR]  3.46). Nonsmokers were
twice as likely to consider secondhand smoke dangerous
than smokers (OR  1.47). Among the variables in our
model, the only statistically significant predictor of plan-
ning to stop smoking or having actually stopped was
believing that secondhand smoke harmed nonsmokers,
which more than doubled the chances of planning to stop
or having stopped smoking (relative risk  2.17).
Conclusions. Educating young people about the dan-
gers of secondhand smoke and empowering nonsmokers
to speak out should be a strong element of any tobacco
control program. Pediatrics 2000;106(6). URL: http://

When public health professionals are design-
ing tobacco control programs, efforts de-
signed to prevent youth smoking or to en-
courage youth to stop smoking are often considered
in competition with those designed to promote
smoke-free environments. The fact that secondhand
smoke increases the risk of death from lung cancer,
heart disease, sudden infant death syndrome, and a
variety of other diseases in nonsmokers1­4 has
proven to be a powerful justification for creation of
smoke-free workplaces, public places, and homes.
Smoke-free workplaces5­13 and homes8,9,12,14 not
only protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke
but also provide environments that facilitate smok-
ing cessation among adults. Smoke-free workplaces
reduce smoking prevalence by 20% and lead to
20% lower consumption among continuing smok-
ers, which itself is associated with progress toward
cessation.15 The tobacco industry has understood
that concern about the health effects of secondhand
smoke on nonsmokers undermines the social sup-
port network for smoking.16 One econometric study
showed that presence of a local clean indoor air law
was associated with lower teen smoking.6 To date,
however, no one has examined whether concern over
the effects of secondhand smoke on nonsmokers is a
similarly powerful intervention for preventing
smoking among youth or encouraging cessation
among this group. We use a cross-sectional survey of
youth and young adults (14 to 22 years of age) to
suggest that interventions designed to educate these
people about the dangers of secondhand smoke are
also a powerful message with this group.
METHODS
After approval of the protocol by the institutional review board
at the University of Pennsylvania, interviewers from Princeton
Survey Research Associates used random-digit telephone dialing
to contact 9301 households in the continental United States from
May 27, 1999 through July 13, 1999. Within these households, 76%
provided the needed screening information to identify a person 14
to 22 years of age. Approximately 15% of these cooperating house-
holds contained an eligible English-speaking respondent. In
households with more than one eligible respondent, the person
with the most recent birthday was selected for interviewing. Pa-
rental consent was obtained before interviewing respondents un-
der 16 years of age. Respondents who reported smoking any
cigarettes in the past 30 days were defined as smokers. The final
sample contained 300 smokers and 300 nonsmokers with a total
response rate of 51%.
The survey data were weighted to adjust for both sample
design decisions (overrepresenting smokers) and for demographic
nonresponse. This weighting was accomplished in 2 stages. In the
first stage the relative proportions of smokers and nonsmokers
were adjusted to correct for the fact that smokers were over-
sampled to increase their number in the final sample for analysis.
The oversampling of smokers was accomplished by screening a
large nationally representative sample of 14- to 22-year-olds on
smoking status and then conducting the full interview on all
smokers identified (n  300) but only a portion of the nonsmokers.
The weighting reflects the fact that smokers were oversampled 2.5
times relative to their prevalence in the large nationally represen-
tative sample of 14- to 22-year-olds screened on smoking status.
The second-stage weight involved bringing the sample of com-
pleted full interviews (after it had been adjusted to correct the
smoker/nonsmoker proportions) into alignment with national pa-
rameters for sex by age, race, and region for Americans 14 through
22 years of age living in telephone households in the continental
United States. These demographic weighting parameters were
derived from a special analysis of the most recently available
Census Bureau Annual Demographic File (from the March 1998
Current Population Survey). The weights are derived using an

iterative technique that simultaneously balances the distributions
of all weighting parameters.
In addition to age and gender, we included variables for eth-
nicity (Hispanic and black). We included an educational variable
coded as 1 for respondents who were still enrolled in school or
high school graduates and 0 if they had left school before com-
pleting high school. We assessed whether they considered smok-
ing dangerous with this question: "In your opinion, is smoking
very risky for a person's health, somewhat risky, only a little risky,
or not at all risky?" and coded the responses "somewhat risky" or
"very risky" as 1 (yes) and "a little risky," "not at all risky," and
"don't know" as 0 (no). We assessed whether respondents con-
sidered secondhand smoke dangerous with this question: "True or
false: each year thousands of nonsmokers die from breathing other
people's smoke" and coded "true" as 1 (yes) and "false," "don't
know," and "refused to answer" as 0 (no). We defined a current
smoker as one who answered "yes" to this question: "During the
past 30 days have you smoked any cigarettes?" We assessed
whether a respondent had stopped smoking or planned to stop
smoking with this question: "Do you plan to quit smoking?"
coding "yes" or "already quit" as 1 (yes) and "no" or "don't
know" as 0 (no).
Data were analyzed with a single logistic regression including
all the variables using SPSS, Version 9.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL).
RESULTS
One half of the respondents were current smokers
and one half were nonsmokers by design. (Of the 300
nonsmokers, 187 had never smoked a single ciga-
rette.) Table 1 summarizes the demographic charac-
teristics of the sample.
The odds of being a nonsmoker decreased with
age (P  .001) and increased with black ethnicity
(P  .010) and educational status (high school grad-
uate or respondent still in high school; P  .003;
Table 2). Nonsmokers were more likely to consider
smoking risky than were smokers (odds ratio [OR] 
3.46; P  .002). Nonsmokers were more likely to
consider secondhand smoke dangerous than were
smokers (OR  1.47; P  .050). Male gender and
Hispanic ethnicity were not significantly related to
smoking status.
Among the variables in our model, the only statis-
tically significant predictor of planning to stop smok-
ing or having actually stopped was believing that
secondhand smoke harmed nonsmokers, which
more than doubled the chances of planning to stop or
having stopped smoking (OR  2.19; P  .049; Table
3).
DISCUSSION
These results indicate that with teens and young
adults, as with adults, concern with secondhand
smoke is a powerful deterrent against smoking and a
powerful motivator for smoking cessation.
In drawing these conclusions, it is important to
remember that these results are from a cross-sec-
tional study, so causality should be interpreted cau-
tiously. As with any similar statistical analysis, the
conclusions depend on the model tested.
Nevertheless, these findings are consistent with
the results of longitudinal studies of similar ques-
tions in adults5,9,13 as well as econometric studies6
and focus-group studies of antitobacco advertising in
teens,17 which indicate that secondhand smoke is 1 of
3 highly effective (along with antitobacco industry
and addiction) messages for reaching teens. Tobacco
control efforts directed at teens should have a strong
element designed to educate people about the dan-
gers of secondhand smoke and the rights of non-
smokers. Encouraging nonsmoking teens--as well as
adults--to object to breathing secondhand smoke
and encouraging creation of smoke-free homes is a
productive tobacco control strategy for youth.
