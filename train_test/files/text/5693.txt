Introduction
The use of information sources is a widely investigated topic
in various areas of research. In consumer research, various
studies (Berger & Messerschmidt, 2009; Labuschagne, van
Zyl, van der Merwe, & Kruger, 2012; Rijnsoever, Castaldi,
& Dijst, 2012) have been conducted on prepurchase informa-
tion searching. News media consumption is one of the most
important research themes in media research (cf. Ksiazek,
Malthouse, & Webster, 2010; Strömbäck, Djerf-Pierre, &
Shehata, 2012; Strömbäck & Kiousis, 2010). Since the emer-
gence of the Internet, which has affected people's media
environment, a number of studies have been conducted on
the effects of Internet use on the use of traditional media or
traditional information channels (Huang, Lurie, & Mitra,
2009; Klein & Ford, 2003; Loibl, Cho, Diekmann, & Batte,
2009; Zander & Hamm, 2012).
Although the personal computer was the initial way that
people accessed the Internet, the use of mobile phones to
access the Internet has increased rapidly in recent years
(Horrigan, 2009; Ministry of Internal Affairs and
Communications, Japan, 2008; Rainie, 2010). The implica-
tions of mobility have attracted the attention of communi-
cation researchers (Donald, Anderson, & Spry, 2010; Katz,
2008; Ling & Campbell, 2010; Rainie & Wellman, 2012).
However, the effects of Internet use via mobile phone on
the use of traditional information sources have not been
examined adequately. Previous studies (Ishii, 2004, 2006;
Jung, 2009; Miyata & Kobayashi, 2008) on Internet use via
mobile phone have emphasized the social difference between
Internet use via mobile phone and that via personal com-
puter. There may be differences between Internet use via
mobile phone and Internet use via personal computer in
terms of how the mode of access affects the use of traditional
information sources.
This study divides Internet use into Internet use via mobile
phone and that via personal computer, and it examines the
effects of Internet use via mobile phone and via personal
computer on the use of traditional information sources, using
Japanese national survey data from 2009. The results of this
research show that Internet use via mobile phone has com-
plementary effects on the use of traditional media, whereas
Internet use via personal computer does not.

The Relationship Between Use of the
Internet and Traditional Information
Sources: An Empirical Study in Japan
Satoshi Kitamura1
Abstract
This study examines how the spread of the Internet has affected Japanese people's information acquisition from traditional
media or via traditional information channels. In particular, this study focuses on displacement and complementary effects
and on devices for Internet access. Using representative data from Japan (N = 1,179), the results show that Internet use via
mobile phone has complementary effects on information acquisition from traditional media, while Internet use via personal
computers does not. In addition, the results show that Internet use via personal computers has a displacement effect on
information acquisition from radio. These findings are discussed with regard to communication means, social contexts, and
media interfaces.

of information sources. In Bettman's (1978) framework,
information acquisition consists of search and being con-
fronted. "Being confronted" refers to the acquisition of infor-
mation in the form of accidental contact with the information
while engaged in other acts. "Search" is divided into two
parts: internal and external. Internal search refers to informa-
tion acquisition from a person's own memory, while external
search refers to information acquisition from external sources
(Blackwell, Miniard, & Engel, 2006; Rijnsoever et al., 2012).
When sufficient information is not obtained internally, exter-
nal search is performed (Blackwell et al., 2006).
In Bettman's (1978) framework, being confronted and
external search are both closely related to the use of infor-
mation sources. In the fields of consumer research and
health communication research, a number of researchers
have studied external search; many of these have focused on
the Internet and the ways in which its use has spread (Huang
et al., 2009; Klein & Ford, 2003; Loibl et al., 2009; Zander
& Hamm, 2012). The Internet has also attracted consider-
able attention in the field of health communication research
as a means to improve health and health care delivery (e.g.,
Heaton, 2011; C. J. Lee, 2008;C. J. Lee & Hornik, 2009;
Park, Chung, & Yoo, 2009; Rains, 2008; Tian & Robinson,
2009). Indeed, because a lot of people search online for
information about specific diseases or medical problems,
web queries can be used for syndromic surveillance (Hulth,
Rydevik, & Linde, 2009) or detecting influenza epidemics
(Ginsberg et al., 2009).
When addressing the usefulness of the Internet from the
viewpoint of information acquisition behavior, the following
two points may be mentioned. One is the Internet's useful-
ness as a source of low-cost access to information. Jepsen
(2007) studied low costs and benefits as factors affecting
consumer use of the Internet for information searches. The
results of her analysis showed that perceived low search
costs positively affected the use of the Internet for prepur-
chase information searches. The perceived low cost of using
the Internet for information searching is caused by the com-
parison of the Internet with other information channels. In
this view, the superiority of the Internet to other channels is
an important factor.
The other key point is that the Internet is a useful way to
obtain information that cannot be obtained from traditional
sources. The advances of the Internet have transcended the
traditional limitations of word-of-mouth (Duan, Gu, &
Whinston, 2008). The Internet provides an opportunity for
users to share a variety of information (Chen & Xie, 2008;
Steffes & Burgee, 2009).
Internet and Other Media:
Displacement and Complementary Effects
The ways in which a new medium affects traditional media
has been a recurring topic for researchers studying mediated
communication (e.g., Chyi, Yang, Lewis, & Zheng, 2010;
Grotta & Newsom, 1982; Ha & Fang, 2012; Liebowitz &
Zentner, 2012; Waal & Schoenbach, 2010). Some scholars
have specifically studied how the Internet affects traditional
communication channels.
Consistent results about the relationship between televi-
sion viewing and Internet use have not yet been obtained.
Robinson, Kestnbaum, Neustadtl, and Alvarez (2002) com-
pared the time-diaries of Internet users and nonusers in a com-
bined 1998-2001 national telephone diary study. Their results
showed that there were consistent declines in television view-
ing and sleep times among Internet users, but no consistent
declines in reading or other activities. Nie and Hillygus (2002)
examined the displacement theory of time utilization using
the 2002 Stanford Institute for the Quantitative Study of
Society (SIQSS) time-diary data. The results showed that
time spent on the Internet was negatively related to time spent
on social activities, hobbies, reading, and television viewing.
However, some studies (Hashimoto, 2009; Saito,Takeshita,
Kawakami, & Midooka, 2004) do not support the decline of
television viewing as caused by Internet use. Using time-
diary data, Hashimoto (2009) compared the time-diaries of
the days in which Internet users accessed the Internet at
home and the days in which they did not. His results showed
that Internet users spent a longer time watching television on
the days when they accessed the Internet at home than on the
days when they did not. Saito et al. (2004) also found that use
of the Internet did not decrease television viewing, using a
survey conducted in Tokyo in November 2003. Outside of
Japan, Kraut, Kiesler, Boneva, and Shklovski (2006) found
that people who used the Internet for entertainment watched
television more frequently than those who did not.
There are different views on how the use of the Internet to
obtain news information affects traditional news media. For
instance, Ha and Fang (2012) found that the Internet had a
displacement effect on traditional media, including televi-
sion and newspapers, in the daily news domain. However,
several researchers have argued that the use of the Internet
for news information has complementary effects on tradi-
tional news media (e.g., Nguyen & Western, 2006). Dutta-
Bergman (2004a) reported that users of online news media
were more likely to seek out news from traditional media
outlets. Althaus and Tewksbury (2000) suggested, based on a
survey of undergraduate students, that the use of the Internet
as a news source was positively related with the reading of
newspapers, but had no relationship with the viewing of
television.
In the domain of consumer information searches, research-
ers have discussed whether the Internet has complementary
or displacement effects on traditional media. Ratchford, Lee,
and Talukdar (2003) examined the effects of the Internet on
consumer information searches by comparing data from sur-
veys of automobile buyers collected in 1990 and 2000 in a
natural experiment setting. Their results indicated that the
Internet had led to reduced searching for information on
automobiles. On the contrary, Tsao and Sibley (2004)
Kitamura 3
suggested that Internet advertising has complementary
effects on billboards, direct mail, magazines, and television,
but displacement effects on free community papers and
weekly paid papers as advertising sources. In addition, Klein
and Ford (2003) investigated Internet users' information
searching behavior when buying an automobile, and they
showed that hours per week of Internet use are positively
related to total hours spent searching for automobile infor-
mation and the total number of sources used to obtain that
information. The above examples indicate the findings of
previous research prove to be inconsistent.
Whether the Internet has complementary effects or dis-
placement effects on traditional media can be discussed via
the concept of functional alternatives. For instance, Flanagin
and Metzger (2001) showed that the Internet's information
retrieval and information giving features are used in ways
similar to mass media channels including newspapers, televi-
sion, and books and magazines.
Several studies (Ferguson & Perse, 2000; P. S. N. Lee &
Leung, 2008; Lin & Salwen, 2006) have examined func-
tional alternatives to media through the uses and gratifica-
tions theory. Ferguson and Perse (2000) examined the world
wide web as a functional alternative to television using this
theory. They suggested that the web might be functionally
similar to television, especially in its use for diversion, but
might not be a similarly relaxing way to spend time. Lin and
Salwen (2006) compared online and offline news access
through the uses and gratifications theory. They pointed out
that Internet news websites serve a purpose for "information
seeking," while print news media, which serve a purpose for
"information scanning," have a different role.
Dutta-Bergman (2004b) argued that interpersonal com-
munication, print readership, and Internet communication
are active communication channels, while television and
radio are passive consumption channels. Based on 1999
HealthStyles data, he demonstrated that active communica-
tion channels serve as primary health information sources for
health information­oriented individuals, but passive con-
sumption channels serve as primary health information
resources for individuals who are not health-oriented. Based
on these previous studies (Dutta-Bergman, 2004b; Ferguson
& Perse, 2000; Flanagin & Metzger, 2001; Lin & Salwen,
2006), it can be asserted that the Internet does not simply
displace traditional media such as television and newspapers
but also complements them in various ways.
Internet Use Via Personal
Computers and Mobile Phones
Since the advent of Japan's i-mode service (Ishii, 2004; Tee &
Gawer, 2009), accessing the Internet via mobile phone is a
common activity in Japan. Japanese mobile phone users are
forming a unique culture (Ito, Okabe, & Matsuda, 2005). With
respect to Internet access, several studies have found that there
are sociocultural differences between Internet use via personal
computer and via mobile phone (Boase & Kobayashi, 2008;
Ishii, 2004; Jung, 2009; Miyata & Kobayashi, 2008).
According to Jung (2009), about 90% of Internet users via
personal computer and about 40% of Internet users via
mobile phone obtain information such as weather, traffic, or
movies. The Internet via mobile phone is less used for infor-
mation seeking than the Internet via personal computer.
In addition, Internet use via mobile phone is a more time-
enhancing activity, while Internet use via personal computer
is a more time-displacing activity (Ishii, 2004). Owing to the
time-enhancing quality of Internet use via mobile phone, it
has no displacement effect on traditional media. We predict
that Internet use via mobile phone in fact has complementary
effects on traditional media.
In Japan, the most important activity performed on the
Internet via mobile phone is sending and receiving emails.
There appear to be sociocultural differences between emails
sent via personal computer and via mobile phone: emails
sent via mobile phone are typically used for communication
with one's close friends and family, whereas emails via per-
sonal computer are used for communication with people
with whom one is less familiar (Ishii, 2006; Miyata &
Kobayashi, 2008). Thus, the Internet, a network of networks,
is considered not only a mass medium but also a personal
communication medium (Morris & Ogan, 1996).
The effects of the Internet on the use of information
sources include effects on the use of other people as sources
of information. Email via mobile phone is used for commu-
nicating with others (Campbell & Kwak, 2012; Ling, 2008;
Ling, Bertel, & Sundsøy, 2012). Emailing via mobile phone
supports existing supportive relationships (Miyata, Boase, &
Wellman, 2008). These findings indicate that the use of
emails via mobile phone can facilitate informational support
from close relationships. We predict that Internet use via
mobile phone has an effect on the use of interpersonal
resources.
In this article, we operationally define "complementary
effect" as a positive effect and "displacement effect" as a
negative effect of Internet use on information acquisition
from traditional media. Based on the previous discussion, we
propose the following hypotheses.
Hypothesis 1: Internet use via mobile phone will have
complementary effects on the use of traditional media
as information sources.
Hypothesis 2: Internet use via mobile phone will have
complementary effects on the use of interpersonal
communication channels as information sources.
Previous studies (e.g., Althaus & Tewksbury, 2000;
Dutta-Bergman, 2004a; Ha & Fang, 2012; Nguyen &
Western, 2006; Tsao & Sibley, 2004) have examined the
effects of Internet use via personal computer on the use of
other information channels for information seeking.
However, there are no consistent results regarding the
4 SAGE Open
displacement and complementary effects in media use.
Because of media use as a sociocultural phenomenon,
sociocultural factors affect the displacement and comple-
mentary effects in media use.
Previous studies (Ishii, 2004, 2006, 2010; Jung, 2009;
Matsuda, 2010) indicate that, in Japan, Internet access via
mobile phones is used widely and quite differently from
Internet access via personal computers. Therefore, the
effects of Internet use via personal computer might be dif-
ferent from the effects of Internet use via mobile phone on
the use of traditional information sources. Regarding
Internet use via personal computer, we form hypotheses that
are the opposite of the hypotheses regarding Internet use via
mobile phone.
Hypothesis 3: Internet use via personal computer will
have displacement effects on the use of traditional
media as information sources.
Hypothesis 4: Internet use via personal computer will
have displacement effects on the use of interpersonal
communication channels as information sources.
Method
Research Design
To examine the hypotheses, this study analyzes Japanese
national survey data. Based on the sampling survey data that is
representative, it is possible to show the effects of Internet use
on the use of traditional information sources in a society. This
ensures the external validity of the findings of this research.
In a representative national survey, respondents consist of
several social groups. Because sociodemographic character-
istics are key determinants of Internet use (Katz & Rice,
2002), the characteristics may affect the correlations between
Internet use and information acquisition. Therefore, it is nec-
essary to examine not only the effects of Internet use but also
those of demographic factors. This study statistically con-
trolled the effects of demographic factors using regression
analysis and examined the effects of Internet use via mobile
phone and via personal computer.
Sampling
In June 2009, our research group carried out a Japanese
national survey using a two-stage stratified random sampling
method based on Japan's Basic Resident Register. At the first
stage, 157 survey areas were selected by the stratified ran-
dom sampling method. At the second stage, 14 to 17 people
aged 13 to 69 were randomly selected from each area. Self-
administered questionnaires and diary-style questionnaires
were distributed to the homes of the 2,500 respondents by a
research company and were collected following completion.
A total of 1,490 respondents (59.60%) were surveyed, but
the analyses included only the data of respondents with no
missing values in the dependent, independent, and control
variables (N = 1,179; 47.16%). The average age of the
respondents was 45.3 years, and 46.90% of the respondents
were male.
Measurement: Dependent Variables
The respondents were asked what sources of information
they had used during the last month to acquire information
on nine topics: news, weather, travel or tourism, shopping or
products, health or medicine, TV programs, music or con-
certs, food, and local businesses. Six information sources
other than the Internet--television, radio, newspapers, mag-
azines, flyers, and friends or family members--were pre-
sented as options in multiple-choice questions.
In the analysis, the sums of the topics researched through
each source of information were used as dependent variables
(minimum = 0, maximum = 9). Table 1 shows the descriptive
statistics of these variables.
Measurement: Independent Variables
In this study, Internet use was divided into two types (com-
puter use and mobile use) and the variables of Internet use
were weighted by the amount of Internet use. Using a diary-
survey method, respondents recorded their use of media over
a designated 2-day period. The variables of Internet use via
personal computer and mobile phone were weighted by the
number of days on which each respondent used the Internet
(no use = 0, no access on either day = 1, access on one day =
2, access on both days = 3). Figure 1 shows the distributions
of the independent variables.
Measurement: Control Variables
To control the effects of demographic factors, the following
variables were included in the analyses: gender (male = 0,
female = 1), age, age squared, education (junior high school
= 1, high school = 2, junior or technical college = 3, univer-
sity or graduate school = 4), work (full-time = 1, other = 0),
student (student = 1, nonstudent = 0), and household income
(8-point scale).

Results
The results are divided into two sections: correlation analysis
for dependent variables and independent or control variables,
and regression analysis in testing hypotheses.
Correlations Between Dependent Variables and
Independent or Control Variables
Before performing a detailed analysis, we examined the cor-
relation between dependent variables and independent or
control variables. The dependent variables are count vari-
ables, so I used Kendall's tau rank correlation coefficients
(see Table 2).
Internet use via personal computer had a significantly
positive correlation with information acquisition from maga-
zines and negative correlations with information acquisition
from radio and newspapers. On the other hand, Internet use
via mobile phone had significantly positive correlations with
information acquisition from television, magazines, flyers,
and friends and family, and negative correlations with infor-
mation acquisition from newspapers.
Hypotheses
To examine Hypotheses 1, 2, 3, and 4, an analysis with
regression models was conducted. In the analysis, demo-
graphic variables were added as control variables. As the
dependent variables were count variables, negative bino-
mial regression analysis was used for the estimation of
coefficients.
In the analysis, Internet use via personal computer and
mobile phone, as well as the interaction of the two variables,
were used as independent variables. Gender, age, age
squared, level of education, household income per year,
work, and student were used as control variables. Table 3
shows the results of this analysis. The effects of gender on
the use of information sources other than radio were posi-
tively significant (television: b = .11, z = 3.24, p = .00; news-
papers: b = .10, z = 1.98, p = .048; magazines: b = .29, z =
3.48, p = .00; flyers: b = .48, z = 5.79, p = .00; friends and
family: b = .43, z = 4.97, p = .00), while the effect of gender
on the use of radio as an information source was negatively
significant (b = -.31, z = -2.34, p = .02). These results indi-
cate that females are more likely to use multiple information
sources than males, but males prefer radio more than females
do.
Age had significantly positive coefficients with television
(b = .003, z = 2.50, p = .01), radio (b = .03, z = 5.93, p = .00),
newspapers (b = .03, z = 12.32, p = .00), flyers (b = .03, z =
7.88, p = .00), and friends and family (b = .01, z = 2.39, p =
.02), while age squared had significantly negative coeffi-
cients with television (b = -.06, z = -2.45, p = .01), radio
(b = -.31, z = -3.18, p = .00), newspapers (b = -.18, z =
-4.51, p = .00), and magazines (b = -.16, z = -2.87, p = .00).
These results suggest that older people get more information
from flyers and friends and family than younger people,
while middle-aged people get more information from televi-
sion, radio, newspapers, and magazines than young and
elderly people.
Education level had significantly positive effects on the
use of magazines (b = .16, z = 3.71, p = .00) and flyers (b =
.09, z = 2.05, p = .04) as information sources, while house-
hold income had significantly positive effects on the use of
newspapers (b = .06, z = 3.39, p = .00), magazines (b = .07,
z = 2.68, p = .01), flyers (b = .06, z = 2.26, p = .02), and
friends and family (b = .08, z = 2.67, p = .01). With respect
to work, being a full-time worker had significantly nega-
tive effects on the use of television (b = -.07, z = -2.01,
p = .04) and newspapers (b = -.18, z = -3.20, p = .00) and
positive effects on the use of radio (b = .39, z = 2.74, p =
.01), while being a student had significantly positive
effects on the use of radio (b = .85, z = 2.05, p = .04) and
newspapers (b = .50, z = 3.02, p = .00) as information
sources.
For Hypothesis 1, Internet use via mobile phone had sig-
nificantly positive effects on the use of traditional media
other than newspapers (television: b = .04, z = 3.12, p = .00;
radio: b = .19, z = 3.37, p = .00; magazines: b = .13, z = 3.78,
p = .00; flyers: b = .12, z = 3.42, p = .00). The use of mobile
Internet had no significant effect, however, on the use of
newspapers as information sources. These results almost
completely support Hypothesis 1.
For Hypothesis 2, Internet use via mobile phone had
significantly positive effects on the information acquisi-
tion from friends and family members (b = .15, z = 4.14, p =
.00). This result indicates the positive effects of Internet
use via mobile phone on the use of interpersonal commu-
nication channels for information seeking, and supports
Hypothesis 2.
The results concerning the Hypotheses 3 and 4 were as
follows. The effects of Internet access via personal computer
on the use of information channels were different from the
effects of mobile Internet access via those channels. Internet
access via personal computer had a significant negative
effect on the use of radio as an information source (b = -.15,
Figure 1. Distribution of Internet use via personal computer and
mobile phone.
6 SAGE Open
z = -2.58, p = .01), while it had no significant effect on other
information channels. The results indicate that Internet use
via personal computer has a displacement effect only on the
information acquisition from radio. These results do not sup-
port Hypotheses 3 and 4.
Discussion and Conclusion
First, this study examined the effects of Internet use via
mobile phone on information acquisition behavior toward
traditional media and interpersonal communication chan-
nels. The results almost completely supported Hypotheses 1
and 2, demonstrating that people who use the Internet via
mobile phone frequently acquire information from tradi-
tional media and interpersonal communication channels as
well. These results indicate that Internet use via mobile
phone has a complementary, not a displacement, effect on
information acquisition from traditional media and interper-
sonal communication channels.
Next, this study examined the difference between the
effects of Internet use via personal computers and via mobile
phone on information acquisition behavior toward traditional
media. The results demonstrate that Internet use via personal
computer did not have positive effects on information acqui-
sition behaviors from traditional media, unlike Internet use
via mobile phone. In addition, this study showed that Internet
use via personal computer had a displacement effect on
information acquisition behavior toward one medium: radio.
These results are consistent with arguments that point to the
social differences between Internet use via personal

computer and via mobile phone (Ishii, 2004, 2006; Miyata &
Kobayashi, 2008).
The results indicate that Internet use via personal com-
puter has a displacement effect only on the information
acquisition from radio. This might be related to the location
where radio and Internet via personal computer are used.
Many Japanese people who listen to radio programs are
mobile listeners (Video Research, 2008). In contrast, many
Japanese people who use the Internet via personal computer
are not on the move (Hashimoto, 2011).
The correlation coefficient between the information
acquisition from newspapers and Internet use via mobile
phone was negatively significant, but the results of regres-
sion analysis showed that the regression coefficient of
Internet use via mobile phone was not significant when
demographic variables were controlled. This result indicates
that, in recent times, the demographic factors mainly affect
newspaper reading in Japan.
Internet access via mobile phone is not a sufficient
source of information and cannot replace the roles that tra-
ditional media have historically played. Rather, the results
of this study indicate that people who frequently use the
Internet via mobile phone are actually more likely to utilize
traditional media than those who do not. These results are
consistent with previous studies, one of which pointed out
that people use mobile phones to extend their active time
(Ishii, 2004). Another previous study, performed from a
social networking perspective, suggests that the number of
text messages sent via mobile phone increases with the
expansion of personal relationships (Miyata & Kobayashi,
2008). These studies indicate that Internet use via mobile
phone does not displace existing modes of communication,
but supplements or complements them. The results of the
present study support this theory. However, these same
results showed that Internet use via personal computer had
a displacement effect only on information acquisition from
the radio. With computers, television, and newspapers,
most information is transmitted by visual means, including
letters or pictures; in contrast, radio is a communication
medium that uses sound only and has no means of visual
communication. The results of this study may suggest that
the transmission of information by visual means plays a key
role in information circulation.
On the Internet, there is much information corresponding
to various needs. If all Internet users could effectively use the
information for their needs, the Internet could be the most
useful source of information, so that the Internet would have
displacement effects on the traditional information sources.
However, this study shows that the displacement effect of the
Internet is not very significant.
The present study suggested that there are social differ-
ences between Internet use via personal computer and via
mobile phone with regard to information acquisition behav-
ior. In future research, it will be necessary to consider the
factors that cause these differences. If sociocultural factors
are to be considered, a social history approach (cf. Kortti,
2010) could be an effective research method.
The differences of Internet use via personal computers
and mobile phones include a difference of interfaces for
Internet access. Therefore, it is also important to discuss
access to the Internet in the context of interface technology.
In recent years, the spread of smart phones such as iPhones
and Androids has progressed worldwide. Most smart phones
have a touch-screen interface, an attribute that feature phones
do not have. This means that the use of mobile phones with
interfaces is advancing.
If the use of interfaces to access the Internet could cause a
difference in the social consequences of Internet use, it could
also cause a difference between the social consequences of
the uses of feature phones and smart phones. The smart
phone market in Japan has grown rapidly since 2009
(Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Japan,
2012). In future research, it will be necessary to consider the
differences between the social consequences of the use of
feature phones and smart phones.
This study has some limitations. First, this study found no
evidence of causal relationships between the use of the
Internet and traditional sources of information, although it
did find some significant cross-sectional associations. Thus,
future research should examine these causal relationships.
Another limitation is the examination of cultural factors.
This study was not designed as a cross-cultural comparison.
However, previous studies indicate that it is important to
examine whether cultural factors affect media usage (Donald
et al., 2010; Jung, Lin, & Kim, 2012; Katz, 2008). The find-
ings of this study should therefore be examined using cross-
cultural survey data in future research.
