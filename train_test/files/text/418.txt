Perchlorate is commonly found in the environment and can impair thyroid function at pharmacological doses. As a result of the potential for widespread
human exposure to this biologically active chemical, we assessed perchlorate exposure in a nationally representative population of 2820 US residents, ages
6 years and older, during 2001 and 2002 as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We found detectable levels of
perchlorate (40.05 mg/l) in all 2820 urine samples tested, indicating widespread human exposure to perchlorate. Urinary perchlorate levels were
distributed in a log normal fashion with a median of 3.6 mg/l (3.38 mg/g creatinine) and a 95th percentile of 14 mg/l (12.7 mg/g creatinine). When geometric
means of urinary perchlorate levels were adjusted for age, fasting, sex and race-ethnicity, we found significantly higher levels of urinary perchlorate in
children compared with adolescents and adults. We estimated total daily perchlorate dose for each adult (ages 20 years and older), based on urinary
perchlorate, urinary creatinine concentration and physiological parameters predictive of creatinine excretion rate. The 95th percentile of the distribution of
estimated daily perchlorate doses in the adult population was 0.234 mg/kg-day [CI 0.202­0.268 mg/kg-day] and is below the EPA reference dose (0.7 mg/
kg-day), a dose estimated to be without appreciable risk of adverse effects during a lifetime of exposure. These data provide the first population-based
assessment of the magnitude and prevalence of perchlorate exposure in the US.

Introduction
Perchlorate is an inorganic anion that is synthesized primarily
as ammonium perchlorate for use as an oxidant in solid
rocket propellant (Mendiratta et al., 1996). Perchlorate can
also form naturally in the atmosphere (Dasgupta et al., 2005)
leading to trace levels in precipitation and is concentrated
geologically in some locations such as regions of west Texas
(Dasgupta et al., 2005) and northern Chile (Urbansky et al.,
2001). A combination of human activities and natural
sources has led to the widespread presence of perchlorate in
the environment. The US Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) included perchlorate on the Drinking Water Candi-
date Contaminant List and requires public water systems to
monitor and report perchlorate in drinking water (EPA,
1998, 1999). As of November 2005, perchlorate was detected
at least once in 4.1% of community drinking water systems
from 26 different states and two territories, with levels
ranging from the method detection limit of 4 mg/l to a
maximum at 420 mg/l (EPA, 2005b). Perchlorate exposure
from the diet is likely, due to the contamination of vegetable
crops irrigated with perchlorate-containing water (Yu et al.,
2004) or fertilized with Chilean nitrate (Urbansky et al.,
2001). Milk can also contain perchlorate, possibly from
perchlorate contamination of forage crops (Kirk et al., 2003;
Capuco et al., 2005).
The prevalence of trace levels of perchlorate in the
environment leads to human exposure. Environmental
perchlorate exposure is of possible health concern because
much larger doses of perchlorate have been shown to
competitively inhibit iodide uptake by the thyroid gland
(Wyngaarden et al., 1953; Greer et al., 2002); sustained
inhibition of iodide uptake could potentially lead to
hypothyroidism. The thyroid plays a crucial role in energy
homeostasis and neurological development. Hypothyroidism
can lead to metabolic problems in adults and abnormal
development in children (Braverman and Utiger, 2000).
Useful human exposure data can be obtained by directly
measuring levels of an environmental toxicant in the human
body (i.e., biomonitoring) (Pirkle et al., 1995). Urinary
perchlorate provides a reasonable measure of human
exposure because 70­95% of a perchlorate dose is excreted
unchanged in the urine with a half-life of B8 h (Anbar et al.,
1959; Lawrence et al., 2000; Greer et al., 2002). Sensitive and
selective methods are needed to quantify perchlorate anion in
urine in the presence of much higher levels of chloride, sulfate
and phosphate anions. We recently developed a sensitive and

selective analytical method capable of quantifying perchlo-
rate in human urine as low as 0.05 mg/l (Valentin-Blasini
et al., 2005). In this paper, we have applied this method
to measure perchlorate in urine samples collected from a
representative sample of 2820 persons, aged 6 years and
older, as part of the 2001­2002 National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
Subjects and methods
Study Design
NHANES is conducted by the National Center for Health
Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC). This survey is designed to assess the health and
nutrition status of the civilian, non-institutionalized US
population (CDC, 2004). The sampling design for NHANES
is based on a complex multistage probability design, which
includes selection of primary sampling units (counties),
household segments within the counties and finally sample
persons from selected households. Data were collected
through a household interview and a standardized physical
examination, which was conducted in a mobile examination
center. In NHANES 2001­2002, urine and serum specimens
were collected from each participant, aged 6 years and older,
during one of three daily scheduled examination periods (i.e.,
morning, afternoon and early evening). Sociodemographic
information and medical histories of the survey participant
and the family were collected during the household interview.
NHANES 2001­2002 was conducted in 30 locations
throughout the US (CDC, 2004), with a random one-third
subsample consisting of 2892 NHANES study participants
collectively representing the civilian, non-institutionalized
US population, aged 6 years and older. Overall, the survey
interview response rate was 83.9% and the exam response
rate was 79.6%. Perchlorate measurements were conducted
on the 2820 study participants with available urine specimen.
Demographic Variables
Sociodemographic data were self-reported by study partici-
pants. Age was grouped as children (6­11 years), adolescents
(12­19 years) and adults (Z20 years), consistent with the
Third National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental
Chemicals (CDC, 2005). Similarly, a race/ethnicity variable
was derived from self-reported questionnaire data, resulting
in four categories of race/ethnicity: non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic black, Mexican Americans and others. Non-
Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans were over-sampled
as part of NHANES; urinary perchlorate data were weighted
to adjust for this oversampling (CDC, 2004). Data are not
presented separately for the `other race/ethnic groups'
because of the small number of individuals in this group;
however, these individuals are included in the analyses of
the overall population and age and sex population groups.
Table 1 provides the study population characteristics by age,
sex and race-ethnicity.
Laboratory Methods
During the physical examinations, spot urine specimens were
collected from participants, aliquoted, and stored cold
(2­41C) or frozen until shipment. Samples collected for
perchlorate measurements were shipped on dry ice to the
CDC's National Center for Environmental Health. Urine
samples were stored frozen (À701C) for 3­4 years. Experi-
ments evaluating storage at À701C for 42 years indicate no
changes in urinary perchlorate levels under these storage
conditions. Urinary perchlorate was analyzed using the
method of Valentin-Blasini et al. (2005). Briefly, 0.5 ml of
urine was spiked with an isotopically labeled internal
standard and diluted 1:1 with deionized water. This solution
was subsequently analyzed using ion chromatography­
electrospray ionization­tandem mass spectrometry. Perchlo-
rate was quantified based on the peak area ratio of analyte to
stable isotope-labeled internal standard. Two quality control
pools were analyzed in each analytical batch with unknown
samples. Reported results met the accuracy and precision
specifications of the quality control/quality assurance
program of the Division of Laboratory Sciences, National
Center for Environmental Health, CDC (similar to rules
outlined by Westgard (Westgard et al., 1981)). During
analysis of urine for perchlorate, we analyzed these two
quality control pools multiple times (n ¼ 117) with an
interday precision of 2.8% relative SD at 7172.0 mg/l and
3.0% relative SD at 4.770.14 mg/l. In addition, reproduci-
bility of the assay was evaluated by re-analysis of 5% of the
samples, yielding an average relative percent difference of
1.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1%­2.0%). Absolute
assay accuracy was verified by the blind analysis of four

different perchlorate reference solutions (AccuStandard,
New Haven, CT, USA) prepared in synthetic urine (CST
Technologies, Great Neck, NY, USA). We assessed per-
chlorate contamination by lot screening all reagents and
analyzing blanks with each batch of unknowns; no
contamination problems were identified.
Urinary creatinine concentrations were determined using an
automated colorimetric method on a Beckman Synchron
AS/ASTRA clinical analyzer (Beckman Instruments Inc., Brea,
CA, USA) at the Coulston Foundation (Alamogordo, NM,
USA) in 2001 and Collaborative Laboratory Services (Ottum-
wa, IA, USA) in 2002 (CDC, 2004). Perchlorate concentra-
tions were adjusted using creatinine concentrations to correct for
variable water excretion rates in the spot urine samples.
Estimation of Total Daily Perchlorate Dose
We estimated total daily perchlorate dose based on measured
spot urine perchlorate and creatinine concentrations, and
estimated daily creatinine excretion rate (g/day) computed
from each individual's measured weight, height, age and sex.
Specifically, daily creatinine excretion was calculated for
adults based on the Cockcroft­Gault equation (Cockcroft
and Gault, 1976) as modified by Mage et al. (2004), where
k ¼ 1.93 for males and 1.64 for females:
Adult g creatinine=day ¼ 10À6 Ã k Ã ð140 À age½yrÞ
Ã wtðkgÞ1:5 Ã htðcmÞ0:5
Daily perchlorate dose was then estimated using the
following formula:
Perchlorate dose ¼ mg perchlorate=g urinary creatinine
Ã g creatinine=day Ã l=wtðkgÞ
Daily perchlorate dose is not presented for children and
adolescents due to the limited validation of formulas for these
age groups. Also, we assumed that 100% of perchlorate
intake is absorbed and excreted unmetabolized in the urine
(Anbar et al., 1959; Lawrence et al., 2000). This assumption
leads to underestimation of perchlorate dose in lactating
women because perchlorate is secreted in human milk
(Capuco et al., 2005; Kirk et al., 2005) as well as urine.
Based on questionnaire data, only 26 study participants were
actively lactating during the study period.
Statistical Analysis
Univariate and regression analysis of perchlorate data used
survey-specific sample weights to account for differential
probabilities of selection and non-response. Geometric means
and percentiles of urinary perchlorate were calculated using
SUDAAN PROC DESCRIPT (SUDAAN v. 9.0.0, Re-
search Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC,
USA), with CI estimated based on the method of Korn
and Graubard (1998). SUDAAN PROC REGRESS was
used for analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of perchlorate
levels with predictor variables of age group, sex, race/
ethnicity, fasting and urinary creatinine. The ANCOVA
model used to calculate the adjusted geometric means
included a continuous variable for urinary creatinine and
categorical variables defining age (6­11, 12­19, 20 þ years),
fasting (o8 h since last meal or Z8 h), sex and race/ethnicity
groups. Separate adjusted means are provided for sex by
race/ethnicity groups because of significant interaction
between these two groups. Estimates of the CI were
calculated using the Taylor series linearization method
(SUDAAN Users Manual, 2001).

Results
We found perchlorate in all 2820 urine samples tested from
NHANES 2001­2002, with levels ranging from 0.19 to
160 mg/l. Geometric means and selected percentiles of
weighted perchlorate concentrations in the NHANES urine
samples are shown in Table 2 (in mg/l) and Table 3 (in mg/g of
creatinine). The geometric means and selected percentiles of
the population are presented for the total population as well
as population groups defined by age, sex and race-ethnicity.
Women of reproductive age (15­44 years) are also listed
based on the recent classification of the pregnant woman/
developing fetus as a potentially susceptible population
(NAS, 2005). We found that women of reproductive age
had urinary perchlorate levels with a median of 2.9 mg/l (CI
2.4­3.4 mg/l), 2.97 mg/g creatinine (CI 2.64­3.30 mg/g) and
a 95th percentile of 13 mg/l (CI 9.1­17 mg/l), 12.1 mg/g
creatinine (CI 8.15-18.1 mg/g). Of the 662 women of
reproductive age, a subset (n ¼ 115) were pregnant at the
time of the study. The pregnant women in the study had
median urinary perchlorate levels of 3.5 mg/l (CI 1.8­5.4 mg/
l); 3.27 mg/g creatinine (CI 2.23­4.88 mg/g).
Children had higher median urinary perchlorate levels
(5.2 mg/l; 5.79 mg/g creatinine) compared with adults (3.5 mg/
l; 3.25 mg/g creatinine). We applied an ANCOVA model
to further evaluate the higher levels of unadjusted urinary
perchlorate observed in children compared with adolescents
and adults. The adjusted geometric means for urinary
perchlorate levels in each demographic group are shown in
Table 4 and Figure 1. After adjustment for age, urinary
creatinine, fasting, sex and race/ethnicity, urinary perchlorate
levels were higher in children compared with adolescents
(Po0.001) or adults (Po0.001). We found a significant
interaction between sex and race/ethnicity and present the
data for these demographic groups accordingly. Non-
Hispanic white males had higher adjusted urinary perchlorate
levels than non-Hispanic white females (P ¼ 0.01) and non-
Hispanic black males (Po0.001). Fasting for 8 or more
hours was associated with decreased urinary perchlorate
(Po0.001), likely due to a lack of dietary intake and the
relatively short physiological half life of perchlorate in the
human body (Anbar et al., 1959; Lawrence et al., 2000).
The geometric means and selected percentiles of estimated
daily perchlorate doses for adults are shown in Table 5.
Discussion
We report the distribution of perchlorate levels in urine
samples collected from a representative sample of 2820 US
residents, aged 6 years and older. Based on these results,
perchlorate exposure appears to be wide-spread in the US
population. Human exposure to perchlorate may occur via
several different routes. Perchlorate from both natural and

Urinary Perchlorate in NHANES 2001­2002 Blount et al.

anthropogenic sources can contaminate drinking water and
food crops. Exposure can also result from inhalation of dust
containing perchlorate, especially in occupational settings
(Gibbs et al., 1998). Measuring perchlorate in human urine
assesses the combined exposure from all sources.
The demographic group with the highest levels of urinary
perchlorate was children, similar to previously published
results for urinary iodine (Caldwell et al., 2005). Covariate-
adjusted urinary perchlorate levels were statistically higher
in children compared with both adolescents and adults,
even after adjusting for urinary creatinine (Table 4). These
age-associated differences in urinary perchlorate levels could
represent differences in pharmacokinetics, the relationship of
dose per body weight and/or exposure. For example, dietary
habits such as the consumption of milk and green leafy
vegetables vary across age and ethnicity groups. Samples of
dairy milk and green-leafy vegetables have been reported to
contain perchlorate (Hogue, 2003; Kirk et al., 2003; FDA,
2004; Capuco et al., 2005; Jackson et al., 2005). Therefore,
increased consumption of these foods could increase
perchlorate exposure (Blount et al., 2006).
Several small studies have also found measurable per-
chlorate levels in human urine or milk. For 61 adults living
in Georgia, all urine samples contained measurable levels
of perchlorate, with a median of 3.2 mg/l and a log­normal
distribution (Valentin-Blasini et al., 2005). Similar back-
ground levels of perchlorate (median 5.5 mg/l) were detected
in urine from 13 subjects in a Southern California study
(Braverman et al., 2006). Kirk et al. (2005) reported
measurable levels of perchlorate in all samples of breast milk
collected from 36 women residing in 18 different states (mean
10.5 mg/l).
Other previously published studies did not report measur-
able background levels of perchlorate, likely due to
inadequate analytical sensitivity (Lawrence et al., 2000;
Greer et al., 2002; Gibbs et al., 2004; Braverman et al.,
2005); therefore, application of these methods resulted in
reported urinary background values of less than method
detection limits of 500 mg/l (Lawrence et al., 2000), 20 mg/l
(Greer et al., 2002; Merrill et al., 2005) and 5 mg/l (Gibbs
et al., 2004; Braverman et al., 2005). Significantly higher
levels of urinary perchlorate were found in populations in
northern Chile consuming tap water with perchlorate levels
as high as 114 mg/l (Tellez et al., 2005). As expected, urinary
perchlorate levels in these highly exposed Chilean popula-
tions (median 35 mg/l) were significantly higher than the levels
found in this study.
Occupational exposure to perchlorate can lead to levels
and doses that are much higher than those observed for this
sample of the US population (Gibbs et al., 1998; Lamm
et al., 1999; Braverman et al., 2005). Occupational survey
data indicate that less than 10,000 US workers actively
handle perchlorate (CDC, 1995). This small number of
workers should have a minimal impact on population
estimates presented here.
Measurement of a single spot urine sample was used to
assess individual exposure. Urinary perchlorate levels are

presented both as micrograms per liter and as micrograms
per gram of urinary creatinine to allow for comparisons
between different demographic groups and adjustment for
differences in urinary dilution (Barr et al., 2005). For a single
person, more precise exposure estimates could be derived
by averaging perchlorate levels from two or three spot urine
samples. However, for population estimates such as geo-
metric means and percentiles, results of multiple persons are
averaged. For these point estimates, use of a single spot urine
sample from each individual would constitute one source
of random error, not bias. As a source of random error, this
would lead to less statistical power to detect differences in
perchlorate levels between groups of interest.
Urine is the principal route by which non-lactating
humans excrete perchlorate (Anbar et al., 1959; Lawrence
et al., 2000). During lactation human mammary tissue
expresses the sodium iodide symporter (Wolff, 1998), and
thus significant transfer of perchlorate into human milk is
likely. The presence of micrograms per liter concentrations of
perchlorate in milk collected from US women (Kirk et al.,
2005) confirms lactation as a relevant perchlorate excretion
path. Additional data from another lactating mammalian
species (dairy cattle) confirm that a substantial portion of
a perchlorate dose can be excreted in milk (Capuco et al.,
2005). If lactating women are secreting perchlorate in milk,
then urine-based estimates of total perchlorate exposure for
these individuals are likely to be lower than actual. However,
the overall impact of lactation on our population estimates of
perchlorate exposure is likely to be minimal because only 26
of the 2820 participants in our study population reported
that they were currently breastfeeding a child.
Our initial measurements indicate that perchlorate ex-
posure is widespread. The toxicological impact of perchlorate
exposure at these levels is an area of ongoing research. The
EPA recently set the reference dose (RfD), a dose estimated
to be without appreciable risk of adverse effects during a
lifetime of exposure, for perchlorate at 0.7 mg/kg-day (EPA,
2005a). This RfD was recommended by the National
Academy of Sciences expert panel in their perchlorate risk
assessment (NAS, 2005). To compare our measured per-
chlorate concentrations in spot urine samples with this
toxicological benchmark dose, we estimated daily dose based
on physiological parameters and measured spot urine
perchlorate and creatinine. Estimation of perchlorate dose
in adults revealed a median of 0.066 mg/kg-day and a 95th
percentile of 0.234 mg/kg-day. These estimated perchlorate
dose levels are lower than the current EPA reference dose of
0.7 mg/kg-day. Only 11 adults had estimated perchlorate
exposure in excess of the reference dose.
The NAS has specified pregnant women, fetuses and
infants as populations who may be more sensitive to the
potential health effects of perchlorate exposure (NAS, 2005).
Mild hypothyroidism during pregnancy can be associated
with subsequent cognitive deficits in children (Haddow et al.,
1999; Klein et al., 2001). Additionally, active expression of
the sodium iodide symporter in the placenta and lactating
breast tissue allows perchlorate exposure of the mother to be
distributed to the developing fetus and infant. Perchlorate
measurement began at 6 years of age in our study, so we
do not have exposure information for infants. Women of
reproductive age can be used as a surrogate population for
assessing fetal exposure. Women of reproductive age had a
median estimated perchlorate dose of 0.057 mg/kg-day and
a 95th percentile of 0.214 mg/kg-day. Daily perchlorate
exposure doses were also estimated for the pregnant women
in the study who had complete data sets for age, height and
weight (N ¼ 110). This population of pregnant women had
an estimated median perchlorate dose of 0.066 mg/kg-day.
These estimated perchlorate dose levels are lower than the
current EPA reference dose of 0.7 mg/kg-day.
Conclusions
We assessed urinary perchlorate levels in a US reference
population and present the data here stratified by age, sex
and race/ethnicity. We found perchlorate in all human urine
samples tested, indicating widespread trace-level perchlorate
exposure in the general population. We estimated daily
perchlorate dose and found that the 95th percentile of

information for risk modeling and provide a reference range

population groups. These data provide the first population-
