Abstract
Background: Research on adolescent substance use has consistently identified a strong relationship between adolescent
behavior and the behavior of their peers. However, peer effects are difficult to estimate and causal interpretations must be
undertaken with caution since individuals in most cases choose with whom to associate. In this paper we seek to empirically
quantify the causal role of peer social networks in explaining marijuana usage among adolescents.
Methods and Findings: Using data from a nationally representative sample of adolescents we utilize a multivariate
structural model with school-level fixed effects to account for the problems of contextual effects, correlated effects and peer
selections to purge the potential biases from the estimates of peer influence. Our peer group measures are drawn not only
from the nomination of close friends (N = 6,377), but also from classmates (N = 19,335). Marijuana usage among the peer
groups were constructed using the peers' own report of their marijuana consumption. Controlling for parent level
characteristics, and other demographic parameters, we find that a 10% increase in the proportion of close friends and
classmates who use marijuana increases the probability that an individual chooses to use marijuana by 5%.
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that peer effects are important determinants of marijuana use even after controlling for
potential biases We also found evidence to show that the influence of close friends and the more exogenous classmates are
quite similar in magnitude under our preferred specification, supporting theory predicting the importance of peer influence.
Effective policy aimed at reducing marijuana usage among adolescents would consider these significant peer effects.

Introduction
Consumption of illegal drugs among adolescents is a major
public health concern in the United States [1,2]. A 2009 Center
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study revealed that
close to 10% of all youths surveyed report usage of illegal drugs
before the age of 13, with marijuana being the most common type
of illicit substance that is abused. In addition, a trend toward
earlier onset of drug use has also been observed among middle and
high school students [3]. Besides being associated with poor
outcomes such as liver disease, lung disease, neuropsychological
deficits and elevated medical care utilization [4], adolescent drug
use is also correlated with risk behaviors, such as violence,
delinquency, suicide, unprotected sex and other antisocial
behaviors [1].
Research on adolescent substance use has consistently identified
a strong relationship between adolescent behavior and the
behavior of their peers [5­10]. From a policy perspective, the
potential existence and the magnitude of the social network effects
is of interest since ``peer effects may serve to amplify the effects of
interventions'' [11]. However, peer effects are difficult to estimate
and causal interpretations must be undertaken with caution since
individuals in most cases choose with whom to associate [12]. In
other words, estimates without accounting for peer selection are
unable to identify accurately whether an individual's behavioral
choices in some way varies with behavior of the reference group
[13]. Peer selection implies that the correlation in behavior could
be attributed to the similarity among individuals, whereas, peer
influence implies that the correlation is due to the peer behavior.
Disentangling the peer influence from spurious unobserved factors
associated with peer selection [7] is important if we are to
accurately predict the success of policies aimed at reducing drug
use among adolescents. Thus, if there are common underlying
attributes of individuals within a peer group that drive behavior
more than peer influence, policies aimed at taking advantage of
peer influence may not realize the desired effects [9,10].
Building on the existing literature on peer effects we extend our
analysis by empirically quantifying the role of the peer social
network to explain marijuana usage (the most common type of
illegal drug consumed) behavior among adolescents. Our peer
measures are drawn not only from the nomination of close friends,
but also from classmates within a grade. This allows us to identify
the differences in effects that could be exerted by different
compositions of reference groups. It is also important to note that

our second reference group is not driven by selective peer sorting
[5] and might be more relevant for policy purposes, since most
interventions (the DARE program for example) aimed towards
reducing adolescent risky behaviors are implemented at the school
level. Further we implement two stage least squares modeling
approaches with school-level fixed effects to purge potential biases
from the peer estimates in order to give it a causal interpretation.
Estimating Social Networks
A standard linear regression using an average contemporaneous
measure by a reference group (for example, by the school level, by
workplace or by closest friends identified by the individuals) as a
proxy for social interactions is easy to estimate. However, such
measures of peer networks, or social interactions, have quite a few
problems of interpretation [13]. A significant effect of a peer
indicator could be the consequence of three different interpreta-
tions according to Manski (1993) [13]. While there may be subtle
differences, defining effective policies would vary depending on
which is the driving force behind the significant peer effect. The
three interpretations Manski (1993)[13] offers are as follows:
a. Endogenous effect. This effect occurs when individual
behavior responds to the behavior of others in their reference
group. For example, an individual is more likely to use marijuana
if there is a high rate of marijuana usage among the reference
group because friends engagement in such activities could develop
a social norm which might compel an individual to use drugs in
order to fit in with one's peer [14]. The influence is coming from
the peer behaviors themselves ­ and their behaviors influence each
other. Targeting the individual to change the behavior would be
an effective policy in this case ­ and would have a multiplier effect.
So even if only some of the individuals are part of the intervention
­ the influence would spread to their peers.
b. Exogenous or Contextual effect. This occurs when
individual behavior responds to the exogenous characteristics of
the reference group. For example, suppose there is a high rate of
substance abuse among the adult population in a community and
the dominating influence on peer drug use is parental substance
abuse (other common parent factors may exist that drive substance
abuse besides substance abuse but it is used as a key example).
Spillover occurs even to the individuals whose parents don't abuse
substance so that there is a peer effect on top of any parent effect.
But targeting only the adolescent will not get at the root of the
problem, nor will it have the multiplier effect discussed above since
children of parents who abuse substance will continue to consume
marijuana despite the behavior of their peers.
c. Correlated effect. This occurs when individuals in the
same group behave similarly because they have similar unobserved
characteristics or they face similar institutional characteristics. For
example, children from like socioeconomic backgrounds will sort
to each other and children with similar propensities to use drugs
will be more likely to abuse drugs because of those like attributes.
Again, if one of them stops using drugs because of an intervention,
it is not likely to impact the others since something unobserved is
driving them all to have higher propensities of drug usage.
In sum, given these alternative interpretations of a significant
peer effect, standard regressions of individual engagement in a
particular activity on group means are unable to distinguish
between the endogenous, exogenous and correlated effects and
successful policy will vary depending on what is driving the peer
effect. This identification difficulty, coined as the `reflection
problem' by Manski (1993)[13], occurs because group behavior
by definition is the aggregation of individual behavior, i.e. group
behavior affects individual behavior and vice versa due to the
simultaneity in choices. Thus for the purpose of devising effective
policy it is important to purge these biases from peer effect
estimates to identify whether peer influence is more important
than peer selection [15].
In this paper we are able to make progress in identifying the role
of peer networks in drug use behavior on a couple of different
fronts. First, we adopt a framework that models not only
marijuana use, but accounts for the reflection problem as well;
namely two stage least square regression with school level fixed
effects, to deal with the potential bias from peer selection and
omitted variables. Second, the compositions of our reference
groups are based on two distinct measures. One reference group
comes from the individual's nomination of their closest friends.
Another reference group consists of those who are in the same
school and grade as the respondents (grade-level peers henceforth).
These peer measures are not based on individuals' self-reports
which are subject to potential biases [16] but are drawn from the
responses of the peers themselves. We hypothesize that the friends
in the individual's closest social network (nominated) will exert a
similar influence compared to the more exogenous grade-level
peers, implying peer influence to be more important than peer
selection.
Data
We utilize data from Wave I (1994) of the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Add
Health consists of data on adolescents in 132 schools nationwide
between grades 7 to 12. This is a representative sample of U.S.
schools with regard to region, urbanicity, school size, school type,
and race/ethnicity. Parents were also interviewed in Wave I of the
data and this component of the survey is key in how we deal with
the problem of unobserved correlated variables that may bias the
estimate of the peer effect. A primary advantage of the data set is
that Add Health asked respondents to nominate their five closest
male and five closest female friends and since a majority of these
friends were also part of the survey we were able to construct peer
measures of marijuana use from the responses of the friends
themselves.
The average number of nominated friends per individual is 2.54
and approximately 85% of the friends are from the same school as
the respondent. Thus, the sample of our analysis with nominated
peers consists of 6,377 adolescents with at least one nominated
friend interviewed in Add Health. The sample size of our grade-
level peer analysis consists of 19,335 individuals. Table 1 reports
descriptive statistics from the first wave of the data.
Measures of Adolescent Marijuana Use. The dependent
variable of our analysis is a dichotomous indicator of marijuana
usage commonly used in the literature [5,11,17]. The respondents
were asked, ``During the last 30 days, how many times did you use
marijuana?'' For answering the drug use question, students
listened to tape-recorded question through earphones and
entered their answers into a laptop [18]. The tape-recorded
questions were used in order to avoid interview or parental
response bias, and the laptop to assure students of the
confidentiality of their answers. The participation indicator was
set equal to 1 if the adolescent responded positively to this question
and 0 otherwise.
Measures of Peer Marijuana Use. We constructed
different measures of peer drug use for each reference group.
For the nominated friends we created a variable pertaining to the
percentage of friends who participated in marijuana use in the last
30 days. The grade-level peer drug use measure was the
percentage of students (excluding the respondent) in the
respondent's grade and school that participated in marijuana use
in the last 30 days.

Parental Measures and Demographics. The parent
survey of Add Health allowed us to control for a number of
parent characteristics including parent drinking, parent smoking,
parent education, whether the adolescent lives with both biological
parents and whether the family collects welfare benefits. In
addition, parental measures such as whether the parents chose
their residence because of the school district and how old the
adolescent was when they first moved were also accounted for in
the analysis. Other controls we include are socio-demographic
factors like age, race/ethnicity gender, whether they consider
religion to be important and, if they have siblings. One of the risk
factors for the early onset of drug use is lack of a significant
relationship with parents or lack of mutual attachment [8,19]. To
account for such factor we also control for whether the adolescent
is satisfied with the relationship he or she has with his or her
mother and father. In addition, we also control for indicators of
aggressive behavior such as whether the adolescent acts loud,
rowdy or unruly in public places and whether the adolescent got
into a serious physical fight in the last 12 months. The literature
identifies such aggressive behaviors to be highly correlated with
initiation of drug use [1,2].
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
We are registered and approved users of the Add Health
dataset. As a part of the process for acquiring the data we
underwent IRB review and received approval ­ both from Stony
Brook University's Institutional Review Board (2005) and that of
University of Toledo (2007). We are in no way using human or
animal subjects directly. We have successfully completed our
training on human subjects research review as well as HIPAA.

where Fist
refers to our peer marijuana use measures, pertaining
either to the adolescent's nomination of close friends or their
classmates. Xist
is a vector of personal or demographic character-
istics and Pist
is a vector of parent and family characteristics. Sist
is a
vector of school dummy variables that control for unobserved
school type (school-level fixed effects) or confounding factors that
are common to all individuals within the same school. For
example, this could include environmental factors such as lower
opportunity costs of marijuana use related to easy availability or
the level of poverty in the individual's community [1,12].
We are primarily interested in the endogenous effect b1
, which
indicates the extent of peer influence on an individual's decision to
consume marijuana. If b1
is estimated to be positive, then any
policy intervention that alters the marijuana usage behavior of the
individual within a reference group or social network would have
an effect on non-treated adolescents' marijuana usage behavior
that are in the same social network [13]. As indicated before, the
estimated coefficient of b1
would be biased if the correlated effects
and the contextual effects are not controlled for. Estimating our
models with Sist
, the school-level fixed effects, potentially mitigates
the correlated effects. However, a two stage least square regression
is also necessary in this empirical analysis because of the reflection
problem. The reflection problem, as discussed in Section 2, arises
because peer behavior affects individual behavior and vice versa.
Manski (1993)[13] demonstrated that most estimates of b1
are not
identified without utilizing instrumental variables or other similar
methodologies. This is because the fundamental assumption for
consistency of least-squares estimation to give b1
a causal
interpretation is violated. There is something in the error term,
e, that is correlated with both F and Y so that E(e|F) ?0. The
instrumental variable estimator (IV) provides a consistent
estimator under the assumption that the instruments (z) are
variables that are correlated with the regressor, F, that satisfy
E(e|z) = 0 [20]. It is possible to obtain the instrumental variable
estimator through the two stage least square (2SLS) method, which
is just a two stage model that first deals with accurately capturing
the component of the peer variable we want (stage 1) and putting
that cleaned-up indicator of the peer variable into the drug usage
regression (stage 2).
Key to implementing the IV technique is finding instruments
that have two properties. First, they affect (cause variation in) the
variable whose effect we want to know about; in our case the peer
measure. Second, these instruments must have no direct effect on
the outcome measure (Yist
in eq 1) so they must be independent of
the latent factors that drive that outcome. For our instrument we
propose four variables:- (i) the percentage of peers who are satisfied
with the relationship they have with their parents (ii) the
percentage of peers who have easy access to alcohol at home,
(iii) the percentage of peers who have easy access to cigarettes at
home and (iv) the percentage of peers who live with both biological
parents. These peer level variables directly impact peer behavior

but do not predict individual behavior. The intuition behind the
instruments is that, while individuals who live with both biological
parents are less likely to consume drugs, the proportion of the
individual's friends who lives with both biological parents will only
directly affect the friend but not the individual. Similar intuition
applies to the other instruments. Combined with the school-level
fixed effects, the IV or 2SLS procedure will enable us to obtain
consistent peer effect estimates. We also undertake a test to verify
the validity of our instruments.
Results
We begin by presenting OLS results for the effects of peer
marijuana use on individual marijuana use. Least-square estimates
of coefficients in linear probability models are consistent estimates
if standard errors are adjusted for the presence of heteroskedas-
ticity [21]. We report standard error estimates that are robust to
any form of heteroskedasticity. Linear probability also converges
to normal when samples are large [22]. Table 2 presents our OLS
results using Wave I (1994) data for the nominated and grade-level
peers. For the purpose of completeness we provide estimates for all
our control variables and discuss their effect on participation in
marijuana consumption.
The results indicate a positive and statistically significant effect
of peer drug use behavior on individual behavior. We see that a
10% increase in close friends using marijuana will increase the
likelihood of marijuana by more than 2% (coefficient = 0.279, p-
value = 0.000) and a 10% increase in marijuana use among grade-
level peers is associated with a 4.4% increase in individual
marijuana use (coefficient = 0.44, p-value = 0.000). We can also
see that older adolescents, those who are at a higher grade, are
more likely to participate in marijuana use. However, we do not
find any significant race differences in using marijuana. Being
religious is inversely related to drug use. Among parent level
characteristics, it is being satisfied with the relationship one has
with parents that has the greatest negative effect on participating
in marijuana. In fact, with the exception of the peer effect, these
indicators have the largest impact on adolescent participation in
marijuana use. Living in a two parent household also decreases the
participation. Aggressive behaviors such as being rowdy in public
places and getting into serious physical fights are also positively
correlated with marijuana use. These demographic and parent
level characteristics have an effect of similar magnitude across both
model specifications, which is as expected.
These peer estimates however cannot be interpreted to signify
causality because of the reasons outlined in Section 2. Thus, we
pursue an IV estimation strategy to identify the causal effect of
peer behavior on individual behavior. Our IV results are reported
in Table 3 and since the other control variables exhibit similar
effects we only report the coefficients of our main variable of
interest. We also implemented an over identification test, and
compute Hansen's J statistic [23], to check the validity of our
Table 2. Determinants of marijuana use (OLS).

instruments. This is a test of the joint null hypothesis that the
excluded instruments are valid instruments, i.e., uncorrelated with
the error term and correctly excluded from the estimated
equation. The test fails to reject their validity, thus all five of the
instruments pass the test under all model specifications.
From our results we see that the magnitude of the peer estimates
are actually magnified under the IV specifications. This indicates
that after correcting for the reflection problem, peer effects
become more important. This is consistent with the peer effects
literature utilizing similar methodologies [11]. However, these IV
models were estimated without controls for school-level unobserv-
able factors or environmental confounders (correlated effects) that
could simultaneously affect individual and peer outcomes, thus
biasing the estimated coefficients.
Our IV estimation with school-level fixed effects shows
coefficients which are smaller in magnitudes. Peer participation
in marijuana use continues to be statistically significant for both
the nominated and grade-level peers. This indicates that holding
everything else constant, an increase in marijuana use among
individual's close friends by 10% will result in an increase in the
likelihood of individual marijuana use by approximately 5%
(coefficient = 0.505, p-value = 0.000). A similar effect is also
obtained for classmates (coefficient = 0.491, p-value = 0.000).
This result is consistent with our hypothesis that, after
accounting for peer selection, environmental confounders and
the reflection problem, the role of social networks in influencing an
individuals' participation in drug use will continue to be
statistically significant. Our estimates also indicate that peer
influence might be more important than peer selection. If peer
selection was important, we would expect the effects for nominated
peers to be less in magnitude or non-existent under the IV fixed
effects specification. Since the grade-level peer measures are not
driven by selective peer sorting [5], the similarity in their
magnitudes with nominated friends under our preferred specifi-
cation (IV with school-level fixed effects) signifies the importance
of peer influence. Moreover, the magnitude of the effect of friends
slightly exceeds that of grade-level peers implying that friends are
potentially more salient peer group than classmates. Other factors
remain important with no statistically significant difference in
interpretations or relative importance.
Discussion
In this paper, we estimated models of adolescent marijuana
usage to identify the role of social networks or peer groups on
propensity to initiate marijuana intake. In particular, we used a
two stage least squares with school-level fixed effects methodology
to purge potential biases from the estimates of peer effects. Our
estimation strategy allowed us to account for the contextual effects,
correlated effects and the reflection problem, which are present in
empirically measuring social influence.
Our findings indicate that peer effects are important determi-
nants of marijuana use and could be utilized as a potential policy
tool to reduce drug consumption rates among adolescents.
Specifically, our results suggest that an increase in the proportion
of close friends and classmates who uses marijuana by ten percent
will increase the likelihood of individual marijuana use by
approximately five percentage points. These findings suggest that
public health interventions at the school level might be more cost-
effective than previous estimates have suggested, since health
promoting behavior in one person may spread to others. However,
we would like to caution the readers that our study, while
addressing bi-directionality in peer influence, does not directly test
for symmetry in this behavior. Future studies should test for
whether an individual's reduction in substance abuse also spreads
to his or her peers. We also found evidence to show that the
influence of close friends and the more exogenous grade-level
peers are quite similar in magnitude under our preferred
specification, supporting theory predicting the importance of peer
influence [7,15]. Another significant finding was the importance of
controlling for unobserved environmental confounders confirming
a correlation between those factors and the peer measures.
Estimates without controlling for such environmental factors
mostly resulted in larger estimated effects of peer influence.
This work not only lends further evidence in support of the
existing literature documenting the impact of peer effects on
substance abuse, but also improves on the accuracy of the
magnitudes of estimated effects and expands how those effects vary
across different peer group compositions. Most of the previous
studies did not conduct their analysis based on different measures
of the peer group, but have rather focused either on school and
grade level peers only [11] or on perceived peer measures
([7,8,17]. Although Clark and Loheac (2007)[5] used both the
nominated and grade level peers, they relied on lagged values of
peer behavior to account for the reflection problem. However, this
could be problematic since it is not clear what the optimal lag
period should be. Also compared to the previous studies our
estimates appear to be conservative. This could primarily be due
to the inclusion of school-level fixed effects in our two stage least
squares models. School-level fixed effects could be capturing
environmental factors related to unobserved school environment
since adolescents' experiences at school exert some influence on
their drug use [1]. Consistent with Fletcher et al. (2008)[1] this
implies that environmental interventions are warranted to curtail

teenage drug use via fostering policies that facilitate school
connectedness, a feeling of involvement and inclusion, and better
teacher-pupil relationship among others. Our results also indicate
that policy interventions at the school level might be more effective
than previously hypothesized since the existence of grade-level
peer (classmates) influence may serve to amplify the effects of
interventions. Given the importance of parent attributes, school
level interventions may not be sufficient. But the results suggest
there should be significant impact from well planned interventions
at the school level. However, as stated before, the effectiveness of
school-based policies will depend on whether the reduction in
health risky behavior will also spread to ones' peers and future
research should aim to verify that.
While we are able to address some of the issues surrounding the
estimation of social networks, there are some limitations. First, as
with any empirical strategy used with observational data, our
instrumental variable strategy combined with the use of school-
level fixed effects is subject to criticism and thus it is prudent to
regard our results as demonstrating a strong association in the
drug use among peers rather than demonstrating a causal
relationship. If the future studies using alternative strategies
support our findings, this may lead readers to infer causality.
Our study only points in that direction given that the assumptions
about our instruments hold. Second, despite that we follow much
of the literature in our measure of the dependent variable
[5,7,8,11], it might be possible that the influence of peer network
varies with different measures of marijuana consumption. For
example, adolescents who use drugs more frequently could very
well be affected differently by peers compared to occasional drug
users. A possible extension of the study could be to look into how
peer effects differ under various drug use intensities or frequencies.
Another area of interest would be to identify age groups that may
be at higher risk of peer influence that extends into adulthood.
