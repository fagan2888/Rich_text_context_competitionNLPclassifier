This study examines the impact of the "Great Recession" (from December 2007 to June 2009) on 8th and 10th graders
in the USA, using annual nationally representative data from the Monitoring the Future study. Historical changes in
youth adjustment (self-esteem, depressed mood, risk taking, aggression and property crime), school achievement (grade
point average [GPA], time spent on homework and educational expectations) and structured and unstructured activities
(volunteering, employment, sports and evenings out for fun) were examined between 1991 and 2014. Overall, there were
only slight changes in mean levels of adjustment, achievement and most youth activities. However, the percentage of youth
working during the school year did decline during the Great Recession. Several longer-term trends were also evident,
though not directly tied to the Great Recession. These include an increase in GPA, a decrease in time spent on homework,
rising educational expectations and more time spent volunteering. Future work should assess how the shift to unpaid
work activities (e.g. volunteering and internships) among youth is impacting the transition from school to work in the
contemporary economy, and whether the Great Recession had deleterious impacts for younger children or among youth
whose parents lost work or had their homes foreclosed.

The USA experienced a "Great Recession" from Decem-
ber 2007 to June 2009, marked by a nationwide decline
in economic activity, broad increases in rates of jobless-
ness, long-term unemployment and poverty, along with
substantial reductions in income and wealth (Brundage,
2014; Grusky, Western, & Wimer, 2011). Given the sever-
ity and length of this recession, as well as the slow pace
of recovery, policymakers and researchers alike have been
concerned about the effects of the recession on the Amer-
ican population and whether any such effects will be
long-lasting. Whereas most of the attention has been on
working-age adults and families more broadly, there are
key reasons to pay attention to how adolescents specifi-
cally fared. Children and adolescents are developmentally
more impressionable and vulnerable than adults; adverse
effects of difficult economic times may cut deeper and
leave lasting marks. In addition, adolescents are making
decisions about school, work and romantic and sexual
relationships that can set them on different pathways into
adulthood.

In order to fully understand how the Great Recession
may have affected adolescents, studies using a range of
methodologies and samples are required. Studies with
detailed data on the extent to which adolescents expe-
rience economic shocks in their families, and those
following the development of individuals over time, are
complemented by those of the type we employ here--an
examination of broad, population-level trends. We pur-
sue two research questions. First, we ask how adolescents
in the USA as a whole were doing during and after the
Great Recession compared to beforehand. Second, we ask
whether any changes experienced by the adolescent pop-
ulation were concentrated among minorities and those
in lower socio-economic status families, groups who are
more economically vulnerable in the USA. To address
these questions, we examine repeated cross-sectional data
for 8th and 10th grade students from the ongoing, nation-
ally representative Monitoring the Future (MTF) study.

cents have fared, sketching out the "big picture." These

indicators tap adjustment (self-esteem, depressed mood,
risk taking, aggression and property crime), achievement
(grade point average [GPA], time spent on homework
and educational expectations) and activities (volunteer-
ing, employment, sports and evenings out for fun). We
examine trends in these measures assessed annually with
new national samples of 8th and 10th graders over more
than two decades (1991­2014), allowing observation
both before, during and after the Great Recession, as well
as for two previous recessions (1991 and 2001).
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Contemporary approaches to understanding adolescence
as a life stage and the developing young person him or
herself emphasise the importance of historical period and
social context (Crosnoe & Johnson, 2011). Adolescents
are embedded in families, institutions and the larger soci-
ety, and these environments shape development along
multiple dimensions. This basic observation orients us as
we consider what kinds of impacts a severe recession can
be expected to have on adolescents. It suggests we look
to the wider societal environment in which adolescents
are learning, planning, taking risks and making invest-
ments. It also directs our attention to key institutions such
as the labour market, as it expands, contracts and alters
the reward structure for varying skills, and to families, as
the most immediate social environment or "microsystem"
through which social change is mediated (Bronfenbren-
ner, 1979; Elder, 1999). With this orienting framework,
we observe both direct ways in which a major recession
can affect adolescents, as well as indirect ways through
the family's experience of economic change.
Most directly, major negative changes in economic
conditions affect adolescents' labour market opportuni-
ties as companies lay off existing employees and offer
fewer openings for new labour market entrants (Staff,
Johnson, Patrick, & Schulenberg, 2014). The Great
Recession may have also affected the way adolescents
think about the future, with implications for well-being
and behavioural choices. Certainly the long-term eco-
nomic restructuring in the USA, encompassing the rising
premium to a 4-year college degree, has made pursuit of
higher education more desirable (Goyette, 2008). Nearly
40% of ninth graders in the recent High School Longi-
tudinal Study expect to achieve beyond the bachelor's
degree, anticipating earning a Master's degree or higher
(National Center for Education Statistics, 2015). With
bachelor's degree holders relatively protected in the Great
Recession (e.g. unemployment at half the rate of high
school graduates in 2009; Grusky et al., 2011), as well as
in the years immediately following the recession (Vuolo,
Mortimer, & Staff, 2016), obtaining a 4-year college
degree may have become even more important to ado-
lescents. With educational expectations already so high,
not much change may be evident in them (i.e. there may
be ceiling effects), but perhaps adolescents' investments
in studying rose along with other activities designed to
assist in presenting competitive applications to college
(e.g. volunteer work). If adolescents perceive higher
stakes in education and the labour market, increased
efforts aimed at succeeding in these realms may reduce
time spent in leisure pursuits.
In contrast to these arguments, there are countervail-
ing trends that complicate such predictions. Despite the
growing value of education in the labour market, the cost
of higher education rose as well, particularly during the
Great Recession (The College Board, 2015). Although
many young people and their families were able to find
ways to meet these costs, others were likely priced out.
Studies have shown that risky behaviour among adoles-
cents rises when higher education becomes less affordable
(Cowan, 2011). For those who may have been on the mar-
gin with respect to future educational routes, there may
have been even less to lose by engaging in risky behaviour.
Adolescents may also have been impacted indirectly,
particularly through their families' experiences of the
Great Recession. Specifically, adolescents' well-being
may have declined as their parents lost jobs or felt greater
employment insecurity, had their homes foreclosed, or
witnessed their savings dry up. More than one in three
households in the USA experienced unemployment, neg-
ative equity in their home, or missed a house payment
between 2008 and 2009 (Hurd & Rohwedder, 2010). Bur-
gard (2012) also reports an uptick in the rate of serious
psychological distress among adults in the USA during
the recession.
Specific, disruptive events such as parental job loss
and residential moves increase during recessions, and
have generally negative impacts on child and adoles-
cent development, particularly among those in lower
socio-economic status families (Kalil, 2013). Financial
stress on parents can find its way to children through par-
ents' own deteriorated well-being and increased conflict
between parents (Conger, Ge, Elder, Lorenz, & Simons,
1994). As such, adolescents may have experienced more
stress at home, as well as less support from parents in cop-
ing with even routine difficulties.
Despite strong arguments suggesting major impacts,
it is equally important to consider that the Great Reces-
sion may have had limited or weak effects on adolescents.
One possibility is that adolescents already faced uncer-
tain futures prior to the Great Recession, and any adaptive
responses have been ongoing in the face of longer-term
economic trends. In addition, while some families expe-
rienced major issues, many parents may have been able to
buffer the impact on their adolescent children by drawing
on their financial as well as emotional reserves to weather
the tough times. Studies of adults support the idea that
there were not wholesale effects of the Great Recession
across all aspects of life and well-being. Although there

is evidence of decline in mental health, other aspects of
health showed little change, at least in the short-run (Bur-
gard, 2012).1 And scholars tracking public opinion have
noted the "surprisingly weak effect" recessions have had
on Americans' views on economic and social issues (Ken-
worthy & Ownes, 2011).
We have limited empirical evidence to date with which
to evaluate the effects of the Great Recession on ado-
lescents. Two recent studies drawing on data from a
long-term panel study in the USA tracked achievement
orientations and work values of adolescents with changes
in parents' incomes and employment conditions. Findings
from the first study (Mortimer, Zhang, Hussemann, &
Wu, 2014) indicated that adolescents' expectations of
economic success in adulthood declined with increases
in parents' financial problems over a 2-year period, but
only among those whose parents had no more than a
high school diploma; educational aspirations were also
lowered in the face of declining parental income if par-
ents had experienced intermittent unemployment in the
decade prior. The second study (Johnson & Mortimer,
2015) found differences in adolescents' work values, or
the importance they attach to different job features. Ado-
lescents whose parents experienced increases in income
held stronger extrinsic work values (i.e. greater emphasis
on income, security, a job that people regard highly, and
advancement opportunities). Those whose parents experi-
enced a decline in job security held weaker extrinsic val-
ues. Findings for intrinsic values were very similar, with
increased income positively related to children's intrin-
sic work values (greater emphasis on decision-making
authority, responsibility, opportunities to use one's skills
and abilities, learning opportunities, contacts with peo-
ple and opportunities to help others), and a decline in
parental job security negatively related to intrinsic work
values. Representing a more disruptive change in the fam-
ily, parental unemployment was associated with higher
extrinsic and intrinsic orientations among children when
parents had low levels of education (high school degrees
or less). The findings of this study support a generalisation
model, wherein work values are stronger when jobs are
more rewarding (and weaker when they become less so).
Taken together, these two studies suggest that chang-
ing parental circumstances in the Great Recession may
shape adolescents' achievement-related orientations,
though often differentially by how families are posi-
tioned economically. Looking outside the USA, having
parents out of work was associated with Not in Education,
Employment or Training (NEET) status and duration in
the Great Recession in England, particularly among

effects may arise later.

those teenagers with weaker educational achievement
orientation (Schoon, 2014).
In sum, research on adolescent adjustment and attain-
ment in the Great Recession is limited. We know that
many adults' financial circumstances changed greatly
during and in the aftermath of the recession, but con-
sideration of other aspects of adults' orientations and
well-being suggest variable and sometimes short-term
effects. In this study, we draw on national data collected
annually from large samples of US adolescents in the
8th and 10th grades, tracking aggregate trends in a wide
range of indicators in order to build a more complete
picture of the Great Recession's impact on youth. Our
first research question asks whether aggregate trends in
adolescent adjustment, achievement and participation in
activities changed during or after the Great Recession.
Because, as we note above, there are competing possibil-
ities for how adolescents may have been affected, we do
not hypothesise that historical change occurred in specific
directions. Our second question asks whether any changes
tied to the Great Recession were disproportionately evi-
dent in groups more vulnerably positioned in the econ-
omy. Our review of past studies suggests that economic
changes have stronger effects on disadvantaged groups.
Thus we examine whether historical trends in adolescent
adjustment, achievement and participation in activities
differed between Whites and non-Whites and by mothers'
education level, two key indicators of disadvantage.
METHOD
Data
Based on a repeated cross-sectional design, the MTF
study continues to collect data on nationally represen-
tative samples of middle and high school students each
year. 2 Since 1991, in-school surveys have been collected
from approximately 32,500 8th and 10th grade students
each year. Students were randomly selected from approx-
imately 160 public and private schools, and youth com-
pleted questionnaires with multiple choice items in the
classroom. About 90% of students responded to these sur-
veys, with nearly all non-response due to absenteeism.
Although school-based survey administrations exclude
dropouts, estimates indicate a dropout rate of less than
2% for eighth graders (age 13­14) and less than 7% for
10th graders (age 15­16) in recent years (Miech, John-
ston, O'Malley, Bachman, & Schulenberg, 2016). We
used weights in all of our analyses to correct for the multi-
stage sampling procedure. The MTF uses multiple survey

forms (distributed randomly) to increase survey breadth
and limit respondent burden, so not all of the survey items
used in these analyses were asked of all youth. Thus, our
analysis sample ranged from 245,682 to 773,862 students
depending on the outcome.
In this article, we use 24 cohorts of 8th and 10th
graders (from 1991 to 2014) to assess historical trends
before, during and after the Great Recession. In the sam-
ple, approximately 53% are girls; 61% are White, 13%
are Black, 13% are Hispanic, 4% are Asian and 9% are
another race/ethnicity; approximately 42% of the students
reported that their mother had completed college.
Measures of adolescent adjustment,
achievement and activities
We consider five indicators of youth adjustment that
have been used in previous MTF analyses (e.g. Keyes
et al., 2015; Maslowsky, Schulenberg, & Zucker, 2014).
Self-esteem is a summary scale of the mean of eight
items ( = .88), such as "I take a positive attitude toward
myself," "I feel I am a person of worth, on an equal plane
with others" and "I am able to do things as well as most
people." Responses on each item ranged on a 5-point
scale from "disagree" to "agree." Symptoms of depressive
affect is an average of four items with the same scale
( = .76), such as "Life often seems meaningless" and
"The future often seems hopeless." Risk taking includes
two items ( = .78): "I get a real kick out of doing things
that are little dangerous" and "I like to test myself every
now and then by doing something a little risky," with
responses ranging on a 5-point scale from "disagree" to
"agree." Interpersonal aggression is a mean scale of three
items ( = .80) indicating how often in the past year the
respondent had: "taken part in a fight where a group of
your friends were against another group," "hurt someone
badly enough to need bandages or a doctor" or "gotten
into a serious fight in school or at work." Finally, property
crime is a mean scale based on five items ( = .78), such
as how often in the past year respondents had taken
something not belonging to them worth under $50, sold an
illegal drug, or damaged school property on purpose. For
both the aggression and property crime items, responses
ranged from 1 "not at all" to 5 "5 or more times."
We included three single-item measures of academic
achievement. Youth self-reported their GPA during the
current school year (ranging from 1 = "D or below" to
9 = "A"). Educational expectations assessed how likely
the adolescent felt that they were to graduate from a 4-year
college program (ranging from 1 = "definitely won't" to
4 = "definitely will"). Youth were also asked to report
about how many hours they spend on their homework in
an average week (ranging from 1 = "0 hours" to 7 = "25
or more hours" per week).
Finally, we examined involvement in paid work,
evenings out for fun, civic engagement and exercise or
sports participation. Specifically, we created a binary
measure indicating whether the adolescent was currently
or had worked in a paid job during the school year
(1 = yes, 0 = no). We included a binary measure assess-
ing whether the young person volunteers or participates
in community service at least monthly (1 = yes, 0 = no).
We also created a binary measure of whether they played
sports or exercised almost every day (1 = yes, 0 = no).
Finally, youth were asked: "During a typical week, on
how many evenings do you go out for fun and recreation?
(Don't count things you do with your parents or other
adult relatives)." We created a binary measure distin-
guishing respondents who go out for fun and recreation
at least one evening per week (1) versus those who do
not (0).
RESULTS
In this descriptive study we present trend lines across
years 1991­2014 in a series of figures, and ordinary least
squares (OLS) and logistic regression models in which we
estimate the size and statistical significance of historical
change on each outcome (see Table 1). Regression models
specify 2008, the height of the recession, as the reference
category for the comparison across years and provide the
coefficients when statistically significant. Given the very
large sample sizes involved, it is important to keep in mind
that some statistically significant differences can still be
very small in magnitude.
Figure 1 shows averages of self-esteem, depressed
mood, risk-taking, interpersonal aggression and property
crime from 1991 to 2014. Although each is on a 5-point
scale, historical trends within indicators are the focus
(vs. comparison across indicators), as the meaning of the
five points differs across them. On average, throughout
the observation period, youth "mostly agreed" with the
survey items indicating positive self-esteem, and "mostly
disagreed" with the items referencing depressed mood.
Respondents neither disagreed nor agreed on average
with the risk-taking items. The indicators of interpersonal
aggression and property crime averaged between "not
at all" and "once in the past year" from 1991 to 2014.
Results show little change in mean levels of self-esteem,
depressed mood, risk-taking, interpersonal aggression or
property crime during the Great Recession (i.e. 2007 to
2009), or during prior recessions (i.e. 1991 or 2001).
Overall, the trends show remarkable stability over the
24 years of assessment, though there appears to be a
recent trend of decreasing self-esteem and increasing
depressive affect. Estimates in the first two columns of
Table 1 indicate that self-esteem was lower and depressive
affect higher in recent years than in 2008, although the
difference is quite small (effect size for self-esteem in
2014, the largest difference, is less than one-fifth of a
standard deviation).

Figure 2 displays mean levels of school achievement
from 1991 to 2014. The scales differ in important ways
across these indicators, so again trends within indicators is
the focus. GPA and educational expectations show a slight
increase, and time spent on homework a slight decrease,
during the Great Recession. However, a closer examina-
tion of Figure 2 reveals a more gradual change in achieve-
ment indicators over the past 24 years. For instance, GPA
rose steadily from students averaging between a "B-" and
a "B" in 1991 to averaging over a "B" in 2014. Educa-
tional expectations also rose slightly from 1991 to 2014,
as the average teenager nowadays expects he or she "def-
initely will" graduate with a 4-year college degree. Time
spent on homework also steadily declined over the past 24
years so youth now average under 5 hours of homework
per week.
Figure 3 shows the percentage of adolescents from
1991 to 2014 who volunteered at least monthly, who
were employed during the school year, who played sports

or exercised at least daily, or who went out for fun
and recreation at least one night per week. Volunteering,
sports participation and going out for fun changed little
during the Great Recession. Youth employment showed
a sharp decline during the recession that has slowed in
recent years. This decline is embedded in a longer-term
trend of reduced participation in paid work. A higher
percentage of youth nowadays volunteer monthly than
hold a job during the school year. Youth are also less likely
to go out at least one night per week for fun, dropping
from 80% of youth in the early 1990s to 68% in 2014.
With respect to our second research question,3 we
found little evidence of moderation by race/ethnicity
(Blacks, Hispanics and Whites), and mother's education
(high school graduation or less vs. some college or
more, which is a proxy for socio-economic status) for
the five indicators of adjustment, the three indicators of
achievement and the four indicators of activities. Patterns

and maternal education were thus maintained over
time.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this study was to describe possible
changes in adolescent functioning and adjustment over
the past quarter century, giving attention to any changes
in years of economic downturn. We used large national
samples of US teenagers to examine yearly changes in
multiple indicators of youth adjustment, achievement and
activities from 1991 to 2014, with a particular emphasis
on shifts that coincided with the global Great Recession
across years 2007­2009. Overall, we observed only slight
changes in the years surrounding the Great Recession in
mean levels of five indicators of adjustment (self-esteem,
depressed mood, risk-taking, interpersonal aggression
and property crime), three indicators of achievement
(GPA, educational expectations and time spent on home-
work) and three variables referencing youth activities
(volunteering, playing sports or exercising and going out
with friends). Similarly, these indicators did not apprecia-
bly change during or in the aftermath of other economic
recessions, such as in 1991 or 2001. Not surprisingly,
the percentage of youth working during the school year
did decline during the Great Recession, and school-year
employment is particularly low among youth today (also
shown by Staff et al., 2014), with some evidence to sug-
gest similar declines in previous years of economic down-
turn, especially in the aftermath of the 2001 recession.
Thus, our findings indicate that youth have been affected
by the recent and previous economic downturns in a very
limited but direct way--through their own labour market
opportunities. With respect to these employment trends,
as well as all other measures we examined, we found
no evidence that historical shifts were any more apparent
among disadvantaged groups.
Though many aspects of the social development of
teenagers appear not to be directly affected by the Great
Recession or previous economic downturns, our results
show some broad changes among youth across the past
quarter century. For instance, compared to youth in the
1990s, teenagers nowadays report higher overall GPAs
while spending less time overall completing homework.
As other research has reported using data from the MTF,
educational expectations have risen, with the majority of

contemporary youth expecting to "definitely" graduate
with at least a Bachelor's degree. In addition, the steep
drop in teenage employment in the post Great Reces-
sion period has coincided with a more gradual increase
in the percentage of teens who are spending time as
volunteers or engaged in community activities (Syvert-
sen, Wray-Lake, Flanagan, Osgood, & Briddell, 2011).
Finally, it is clear that recent cohorts of youth are spend-
ing less time hanging out with friends in unstructured
activities that are away from parents, teachers or other
adult guardians. Though it is unlikely that the Great
Recession is directly involved in these recent trends, it
is no doubt part of the myriad economic, social and
technological changes that contribute to the changing
macrosystem of today's youth undergirding these social
and well-being shifts. The repeated cross-sectional design
of the MTF study allowed us to take a wide view of these
trends before, during and in the years following the Great
Recession.
We do observe that the last several cohorts have expe-
rienced slightly higher symptoms of depressive affect
and lower self-esteem, and unlike the changes noted
above, these were not embedded within longer-term
trends. These changes could reflect a delayed effect of the
recession, emerging about 4­5 years afterwards, perhaps
as it became clearer that opportunities in the economy
were not going to revert back to pre-recession levels. It
is also possible that changes to well-being were limited to
children whose families suffered major economic losses,
and with more individual families affected as the poor
economy dragged on (even past the official end of the
Great Recession), it may have taken several years for this
trend to become visible at the population level. Though
we do not address these or alternative, non-recession,
explanations any further here, we encourage continued
monitoring. The differences observed were quite small,
but if they continue they could become consequential.
In previous research using MTF data (Staff et al.,
2014), we documented the decline of employment among
US teenagers, who once commonly held part-time jobs
after school or on weekends during the school year.
Though adults have experienced some recovery in terms
of unemployment and overall rates of labour force par-
ticipation since the Great Recession (though still not up
to pre-recession levels; see Brundage, 2014), no recov-
ery is evident in rates of paid work among 8th and
10th graders since the Great Recession, nor for previous
recessions in 1991 and 2001. In fact, the trends indicate

precipitous drops in youth employment during recession
years that never recovered. Change in the rates of employ-
ment among teenagers has the potential to reduce youth's
opportunities to build human capital and learn important
life skills, but also lessens exposure to the risks asso-
ciated with intensive paid work in adolescence, such as
compromising school performance or increasing problem
behaviours (see Staff, Mont'Alvao, & Mortimer, 2015,
for a review). Our results indicated that youth increas-
ingly appear to be substituting unpaid work activities (i.e.
volunteering) to some extent for part-time jobs during
the school year, as a higher percentage of teenagers in
2014 volunteered in the past month then held a job dur-
ing their current school year. As suggested by the recent
Institute of Medicine (2014) consensus study on health
and safety during the transition to adulthood, future work
should assess how the shift to unpaid work activities (e.g.
volunteering and internships) among youth is impacting
the transition from school to work in the contemporary
economy.
Though our results suggest that teenagers are largely
shielded from economic recessions, including the Great
Recession, it is important to note that these population
trends may mask adjustment problems for youth whose
families or communities were severely hit by the Great
Recession. The MTF study does not collect data on
parental job loss, unemployment or recent family eco-
nomic setbacks, such as a home foreclosure, bankruptcy
or significant loss of savings. Adolescent well-being may
be expected to drop when parents' own well-being does,
or when conflict in the family increases, but we do not
have information about parental well-being or family
conflict. Likewise, our repeated cross-sectional data may
also mask changes at the individual level that panel data
following development of adolescents over time could
reveal. An additional limitation to our study is that while
we examined a broad range of indicators of social and
behavioural development, all measures were self-reported
and some were based on only single questionnaire items.
An interesting question is whether younger children
might be more vulnerable to economic recessions than
the cohorts of 8th and 10th graders we observed in this
study. Elder's (1999) classic study of youth coming of
age during the Great Depression revealed how family
economic hardship had an especially strong effect on
young children. Older children, by contrast, were better
able to weather the stressors and struggles associated with
the Great Depression by working to help with family
expenses. In the analyses we show here, the most recent
eighth graders were elementary age during the Great
Recession. Population level changes for elementary age
children during that time would therefore be evident in the
most recent eighth graders in our sample, so if population
trends existed for children that age, they have dissipated
since then. Older teenagers and young adults may also
be more vulnerable to economic downturns compared to
the 8th and 10th graders we highlight here, as they may
find it difficult to establish adult independence (e.g. obtain
career-relevant work, leave the parental home) in troubled
economic times. Furthermore, when work opportunities
are in short supply, older youth may expect less from
their future jobs, and these weakened work values in turn
could negatively impact later career opportunities and
socio-economic attainment (Johnson, Sage, & Mortimer,
2012).
In conclusion, results did not indicate strong direct
detrimental effects for US 8th and 10th grade youth
during the Great Recession, although the percentage of
youth working during the school year did decline. More
general historical changes, not directly linked to the Great
Recession, such as an increase in GPA, decrease in time
spent on homework, higher educational expectations and
more time spent volunteering, were found across the past
quarter century; more recently there has been a decline in
unstructured time with friends and very recently there has
been a decline in self-esteem and an increase in symptoms
of depressive affect. Additional research regarding how
these changes are affecting youth, including how the shift
from paid to unpaid work activities (e.g. volunteering and
internships) affects the transition to adulthood, is needed.
Moreover, while our study casts doubt on any wholesale
negative impact of the Great Recession, studies using
alternative methods and targeting other age groups are
needed. In particular, a closer look examining the impacts
of the Great Recession for youth who were most directly
affected by economic hardship (e.g. those whose parents
lost their jobs or who were displaced from their homes)
would be highly valuable.
