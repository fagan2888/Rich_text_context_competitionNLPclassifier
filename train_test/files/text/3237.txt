Research Question
Refugee migration, its repercussions, and the manner in which these two issues are being
addressed remain at the forefront of political discourse in Germany to this day. This paper
assesses the potential economic consequences and transmission mechanisms associated
with refugee migration.
Contribution
This paper quantifies the effects of refugee migration on the German economy by simulat-
ing various scenarios with the aid of a state-of-the-art macroeconomic simulation model,
the New Keynesian DSGE model GEAR, which is estimated for Germany, and thereby
adds to the literature on the economic effects of migration by highlighting important
transmission mechanisms.
Results
In summary, this paper finds that measures that cause the migrant qualification structure
to closely match that of the native population over the long term do not lead to GDP and
consumption losses, which seems to be a useful reference point, while a partial or total
failure to close the skills gap can very well have negative economic consequences in terms
of wage and consumption losses as well as higher unemployment. A failure to integrate
about 800,000 migrants (equivalent to 1% of initial German population) could reduce
per capita output and consumption by 0.43% and 0.48%, respectively, while integration
measures that improve the qualification structure in Germany could even yield per capita
output and consumption gains of 0.34% and 0.38%, respectively.

Impact of the Refugee Migration to Germany

Abstract
By simulating various (labour market) integration scenarios with the aid of a New
Keynesian DSGE model, this paper explores the potential economic consequences
and transmission mechanisms resulting from the recent refugee migration to Ger-
many. We find that the long-run costs and benefits for domestic agents depend
critically on the skill levels migrants will obtain in the long run. A failure to inte-
grate the about 800,000 migrants (equivalent to 1% of initial German population)
could reduce per capita output and consumption by 0.43% and 0.48%, respectively,
while integration measures that improve their qualification structure could even
yield per capita output and consumption gains of 0.34% and 0.38%, respectively.
Measures that cause the migrant qualification structure to closely match that of
the native population over the long term do not lead to significant changes in GDP
and consumption. Overall, our model simulations suggest that the macroeconomic
impact of refugee migration is small.

1 Introduction
Refugee migration, its repercussions, and the manner in which these two issues are being
addressed remain at the forefront of political discourse in Germany to this day. While some
aspects of this topic are not related to economics, it is important to assess the potential
macroeconomic consequences and, thus, the potential costs and benefits for domestic
agents. The present paper contributes to this topic by simulating various scenarios and
their economic effects.1 Specifically, it uses a New Keynesian three-region DSGE model
(the three regions being Germany, the euro area and the rest of the world) to explore
which macroeconomic effects could be triggered by refugee migration to Germany. The
model simulations assume population growth of 1% of the native population. Refugees
are initially solely transfer recipients for the period of one year, but are then gradually
absorbed by the labour market over time.
The simulations show that the demand stimulus triggered by the migration of transfer
recipients is the predominant economic impact initially, but that as time progresses, the
change in supply-side conditions in the labour market comes to the fore. The population
growth briefly increases aggregate output by less than 0.1% (demand stimulus). Over
the longer term, the impact depends on the qualification structure which the migrants
achieve in the long run. Per capita output and consumption increase/decline when migra-
tion improves/worsens the workforce qualification structure over the long term because
the strength of the aggregate increase in output and consumption is then more than/less
than proportional. If, over the long run, the refugees achieve the same qualification struc-
ture as natives, there are no long-term changes in output and consumption. Assuming
they improve the qualification structure in the long term, per capita output and con-
sumption might even climb by 0.34% and 0.38%, respectively, whereas per capita output
and consumption are projected to decline by 0.43% and 0.48%, respectively, if all the
refugees migrating to Germany (are in a position to) only perform low-skilled tasks over
the long-term horizon as well.
Despite the overall increase in the labour supply, the aggregate unemployment rate
will remain static over the long term if the migrant qualification structure is brought into
line with that of natives. Even in the worst-case scenario ­ in which all the migrants
remain no better than low-skilled over the long run ­ there is just a 0.14 percentage point
increase in the aggregate unemployment rate because labour demand is raised by supply-
driven cuts in real wages as well as shifts in demand towards employees with different
qualifications. In this worst-case scenario, the average costs do not rise above 0.5% in
terms of individual gross wage and income losses. Generally speaking, though, the more
directly native employees compete with migrants, the more likely it is that they will face
wage losses (including over the long term), while other groups look set to benefit. The
fiscal impact of refugee migration is small.
All in all, it can be concluded that (integration) measures that cause the migrant
qualification structure to closely match that of the native population over the long term
do not lead to any noteworthy GDP and consumption losses while a partial or total failure
1The author takes the view that humanitarian considerations should, as a rule, trump economic
factors, at least in a strong economy like Germany, and that is especially the case for refugee migration,
a development which is mostly set in motion by catastrophic events. That notwithstanding, this paper
will focus exclusively on economic effects.

to close the skills gap can very well have negative economic consequences. Of course, our
model simulation has some caveats. First, when assuming a different labour market
structure (such as, for example, a labour market with search frictions), the labour market
transmission may be different. Second, changes in the skill composition of immigrants
are assumed to happen exogenously as we do not model incentives for attaining higher
education. And, third, in our model simulations, we analyse the effects of an exogenously
given immigration flows ignoring the incentives of successful integration measures for those
who could potentially decide to migrate to Germany. While these issues are important to
be addressed in future research, our results seem to be backed by analyses which, at least
partly, address the caveats mentioned above. Adda et al (2016) use a life cycle model
to demonstrate that policy decisions that obstruct the integration of refugees can lead to
significant welfare losses not only for the refugees themselves but also for natives, while
successful integration can even yield welfare gains (see also Dustmann et al, 2016). This
is also confirmed by Busch et al (2016).
The present paper adds to the debate by explicitly taking into account short, medium
and long-term demand and population effects and demonstrates what should be inter-
preted in the debate as "stimulus" and as a structural effect of refugee migration, besides
showing how short and long-term factors interact with one another. What this paper does
not do, however, is provide concrete guidance on how good integration can be a success.
That is a topic that should certainly be addressed by future research. For an overview of
how this could be achieved, see EP (2016) and the literature discussed therein.
Other institutions, too, have sought to gauge the economic effects of the refugee migra-
tion. Many papers exploring this topic focus on the (fiscal) demand stimulus triggered by
the migration of refugees, and illustrate that refugees are largely reliant on government
transfers and thus trigger a corresponding government-funded demand stimulus. That
stimulus is often amplified by direct increases in government consumption, since transfers
are not the only items that are increased ­ non-financial benefits or public assistance are,
too. Most papers put the resulting impulse from refugee migration for GDP growth at
an annual rate of between 0.1 percentage point and 0.2 percentage point for the next
three years (RWI, 2015, OECD, 2015, IfW, 2015, DIW, 2015, and Deutsche Bundesbank,
2015). The study that most closely resembles this paper in terms of the demand stimulus
triggered by an increase in government expenditure was prepared by the German Council
of Economic Experts (SVR, 2015). Like this paper, they, too, use a DSGE model to
analyse the fiscal stimulus. The transmission mechanisms and dimensions in the present
model, which a corresponding stimulus would trigger, are comparable.
One factor which has so far received less attention in the current simulations is that,
besides providing somewhat short-lived stimulus for demand, refugee migration also un-
leashes long-term effects. That is because at least some of the migrants will probably
stay in their host country, and the medium to long-term effects of migration, especially,
cannot necessarily be equated with the impulse that higher fiscal expenditure can provide
­ particularly since the medium to long-term effects exert a much stronger impact on the
labour market which simply do not exist in the case of fiscal-only stimulus. The European
Commission uses its DSGE model QUEST to analyse a temporary population increase
(EC, 2015, 2016). The population effect assumed in that model (equal to 0.4% of the
native population) triggers, all other things being equal, similar short to medium-term
effects to those modelled in the present simulation of the paper with regard to population
2
growth ­ that is, an increase in aggregate output and a simultaneous decline in per capita
output. In the labour market, a rise in employment as well as a reduction in wages can be
identified. The Commission does not, however, differentiate between the effects on differ-
ent groups of the population, which might not be the same. The International Monetary
Fund likewise analyses the effects of refugee migration using the EUROMOD microsim-
ulation model by simulating two shocks, one to the size of the population, the other to
government expenditure (Aiyar et al, 2016). The study finds that a small stimulus is
generated at first (slightly smaller than in the DSGE analyses), but that the medium
to long-term effects are extremely sensitive to the assumptions made regarding labour
market integration.
Lessons learnt in this regard from earlier periods of migration are also discussed. Beyer
(2016) discusses past experience of labour market integration in Germany, while Battisti
et al (2015) analyse specific policy proposals in the field of integration. They find that
the minimum wage in particular as well as an increase in the standard Hartz IV rates
are not conducive to promoting integration. Ruist (2015) discusses the lessons learnt in
Sweden, and Braun and Weber (2016) outline the situation in post-war Germany. The fact
that refugee migration can influence the surge of rather more conservative to right-wing
political parties, and the manner in which this occurs, are demonstrated by Dustmann et
al (2016), who use Denmark as a case study. Ottaviano and Peri (2012) identify slightly
positive effects on the wages of the native US population in the period from 1990 to 2006
because, first, migrants and natives constitute imperfect substitutes and, second, migrants
trigger a demand stimulus. Mandelman and Zlate (2012) detect similar effects in their
analysis of migration flows across the US/Mexican border. Earlier work on immigration
in a DSGE context can be found in, among others, Acosta et al (2009), Barwell (2007),
Chami et al (2006) and Durdu and Sayan (2010).
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an overview
of the simulation model used and describes how the simulation is designed. Section 3
presents the possible long-term effects triggered by the different scenario assumptions,
while section 4 looks at the short to medium-term effects. Section 5 summarises and
concludes this paper.
2 The influx of refugees to Germany: model imple-
mentation
This section begins by outlining the simulation model used before moving on to discuss
the specific assumptions and model implementation.
2.1 Simulation model
We use the GEAR model for the following simulations, which is a standard New Keynesian
DSGE model of a monetary union that consists of two regions and is embedded in the rest
of the world. The baseline model is estimated for Germany, the rest of the euro area and
the rest of the world with the aid of Bayesian techniques. Compared with other models
in this class, the GEAR model comprises a complex labour market structure that is also
capable of modelling involuntary unemployment, a disaggregated fiscal sector as well as
3
a robust representation of trade flows. More precisely, in the model, households make
optimal choices regarding savings in physical capital as well as national and international
assets and purchases of consumption and investment goods.2 The latter add to the private-
sector capital stock which is rented out to private firms. Household members also decide
whether or not to participate in the labour market. Those who participate may find a
job in the private or in the public sector or stay unemployed. Unemployment is modelled
in line with Gal´
i (2010) and Gal´
i et al. (2011). Hence, households receive interest and
wage payments, unemployment benefits and other fiscal transfers, and they pay taxes.
In line with Gal´
i et al. (2007), it is also assumed that a fraction of households does
not participate in asset markets and consumes the entire income each period. Those
households have become known in the literature as "rule-of-thumb" (RoT) households;
we call the other type of households optimisers.
Furthermore, households enjoy some monopoly power on the labour market because
different types of labor are needed in production, and these are not perfectly substitutable.
Wage setting is associated with Rotemberg adjustment costs in the sense that changing
nominal wages is costly for firms and for workers. This prevents wages from "perfectly"
adjusting to the current economic situation which, in the end, induces potentially ineffi-
cient wage and employment fluctuations (see Ascari et al., 2011, and Ascari and Rossi,
2011, for a discussion).
On the production side, monopolistic competitors in each region produce a variety
of differentiated products and sell these to the home and foreign market. We assume
that there is no price discrimination between markets. Firms use labour and private
capital as production inputs. Public employment and the public capital stock can be
productivity-enhancing. However, the provision of these inputs is outside the control of
firms and conducted by the fiscal authority. Cost minimisation determines the amount of
labor and capital input demanded by each firm. Because firms enjoy monopolistic power,
they are able to set their nominal price. Price setting is also associated with Rotemberg
adjustment costs.
The fiscal authority purchases consumption and investment goods produced in the
private sector. The latter increases the public capital stock which may, in turn, improve
private-sector productivity (for example, because of better infrastructure). The govern-
ment also employs public-sector workers for whom it has to pay wages. Services provided
by these public-sector workers may also affect private-sector productivity positively (for
example, because of better governance). Introducing immediate positive spillovers from
the public to the private sector follows the idea of Baxter and King (1993), Pappa (2009),
Leeper et al (2009, 2010) or D'Auria (2015). Furthermore, the fiscal authority pays un-
employment benefits and other transfers to private households. It also has to pay interest
on outstanding debt. Fiscal authorities finance themselves with distortionary taxes on
private consumption, on labor income and on capital returns, lump-sum taxes as well as
social security contributions paid by firms. They can also issue new debt. The monetary
authority sets the nominal reference interest rates. In the euro area, it sets a common
2As we will see below, we assume that, when refugees enter Germany, they are wholly reliant on
government transfers and non-financial benefits and do not have asset holdings for the period of one year.
Once they enter the group of asset holding households, we assume that they enter the big household
family and thus share the household's wealth in equal amounts. However, the first immigrant entering
this household type needs about 8 years to do so. Before this, no immigrant will be an asset holder.

rate according to a Taylor-type rule that responds to area-wide inflation and output gap.
The rest of the world is reduced to a three-equation VAR process (output, inflation and
interest rate) as in Christiano et al. (2011).
In order to make this paper self-contained, we provide a detailed model description in
the appendix. Besides the model modifications explained in the main text, this is basically
a repetition of the model description already provided by Gadatsch et al (2016).
Since the qualification/productivity (hereinafter used synonymously) of the working
population has a major bearing on the question discussed here, we extend the basic
model so as to incorporate a suitably heterogeneous productivity structure in Germany
­ both in the original equilibrium but notably following the influx of refugees. It is
assumed that the German native population can be broken down into three groups: high-
productivity, medium-productivity and low-productivity employees. They account for
30%, 60% and 10% of the population, respectively, and their relative productivity is
determined on the basis of the gross (hourly) wage differences in steady state. The
gross hourly wage received by high-productivity households is assumed to be twice as
large as that of medium-productivity households and three times larger than that of
low-productivity households (see Destatis, 2016a). Unemployment within the groups, in
the original long-term equilibrium, stands at 3%, 6% and 24%, respectively (see IAB,
2016a). A fourth group is added to the basic model consisting of households that do not
participate in the labour market and subsist entirely on transfer payments. It is assumed,
in the initial steady state, that the population share of this latter group is zero, ie that
this group does not exist. The share can rise temporarily or even permanently following
the influx of refugees and simply increases aggregate consumption demand.
Employees from the groups participating in the labour market constitute imperfect
substitutes in the production function of firms (formally captured by a CES aggrega-
tor), with the result that firms will generally continue to have a demand for labour from
those groups as long as the marginal utility of the corresponding labour input equals or
exceeds the marginal production costs (ultimately real wages plus social security contri-
butions). Imperfect substitutability between natives and immigrants may even be higher
than postulated here given that immigrant workers face, among other things, language
barriers (see, for example, Card, 2007, and D'Amuri et al, 2010). If we were to introduce
this within-skill-group heterogeneity of natives and immigrants, the transition results pre-
sented below would be more in favour of the native population because, at least at the
beginning, they would not directly compete with the immigrants. Still, the long-run re-
sults would remain the same as long as we assume that immigrant workers fully assimilate
in the long run. Compared to the baseline model of Gadatsch et al (2016), the aggregate
production function of the representative firm in Germany is extended to:

of the fact that marginal costs and, hence, the capital-to-labour ratio are common to all

The household sector is analogous to the one presented in Gadatsch et al (2016)
and, therefore, its presentation is relegated to the appendix. However, given that we
now have three different household types participating in the labour market in Germany,
whereas Gadatsch et al (2016) assume only two, we need to extend the household sector
by an additional group. As in Gadatsch et al (2016), we assume that only highly-skilled
households behave Ricardian (ie they save and borrow), while all other household types
are assumed to be RoT households. Given an analogous household sector, labour supply
decisions are also analogous. However, we no longer assume that there is a union that sets
one economy-wide average wage but allow for type-specific wages as indicated in equation
(3). This implies that, while the general modelling of the wage setting is analogous, it
is now undertaken at the household level (see appendix for details). Total population in

2.2 Simulation design
When simulating refugee migration, a distinction must be made between short, medium
and long-term migration. Specifically, this means that assumptions first need be made
as to the number of refugees currently migrating to Germany who will stay there perma-
nently. To capture the immigrant influx, the simulation makes the stylised assumption
that the population in the model grows by 1% (ie that around 800,000 people) at date
t = 0. Assumptions also need to be made concerning the migrants' qualification levels (ie
which productivity group they should be assigned to). The baseline scenario assumes that
the migrants' average labour productivity will not differ in the long run from that of the
native average workforce of the German population: the 1% population growth is thus
split into high-, medium- and low-productivity employees to match the composition of the
native workforce. We do, however, test the robustness of our assumptions to demonstrate
the differences that occur if all the migrants become/remain (i) high-productivity, (ii)
medium-productivity or (iii) low-productivity employees. In terms of our model simula-
tions, this implies that, for the long run, we assume ¯
Pa,x
new
= 1.01 · ¯
Pa,x
old
in the baseline
scenario, whereas ¯
Pa,x
new
increases in line with the numbers presented in Table 1 in the
other scenarios.
While the assumptions presented above reflect the long-term situation used to calcu-
lated the new long-term equilibrium, we also need to make assumptions regarding the
short to medium-term developments. Specifically, this means defining scenarios for the
timescale of refugee migration, for the incidence of refugees who initially migrate to Ger-
many and then leave the country again (either voluntarily or due to deportation) and for
the pace of integration.
For simplicity's sake, we assume that, at a certain point in time, refugees equal in
number to 1% of the native German population migrate to Germany and also stay there
for the long term. This assumption allows us to analyse the economic transmission mech-
anisms in isolation, free from the distorting impact of additional migration and emigration
flows. We assume, for the purpose of our simulation, that migrant refugees are wholly
reliant on government transfers and non-financial benefits for the period of one year and
that they do not participate in the labour market, in an effort to model the average time
of just under one year that it takes to process an asylum request. Once the refugees have
been granted asylum (all migrants in the baseline scenario), they can be integrated into
the labour market in principle. However, we assume that not all migrants immediately
begin looking for work, but that they do so at an annual rate of 0.125 and that they first
join the group of low-productivity employees. It is assumed that, following a period of four
years following immigration, employment (through "learning by doing") and vocational
training will have caused a certain percentage of the refugees to become as productive
each quarter as the average native medium-productivity employee (again at an annual
rate of 0.125). Later on, a further percentage of individuals from this pool is assumed to
become as productive as the average native high-productivity employee, with the result
that the ratio of high and medium-productivity employees to low-productivity employees
in the steady state does not shift in the baseline scenario. These assumptions presume
7
that the adjustment process in the population structure will last 60 years in total (ie that
the qualification structure of the 1% population growth will need 60 years to match that
originally found in the native population; Figures 1 and A.1 in section 4 and the ap-
pendix, respectively, plot the implied population developments). The assumed transition
rates imply that a refugee who manages to reach the highest qualification group spends an
average of eight years in each group and that pop,x
t
is chosen accordingly.4 Owing to the
inherent ridigities in the model, adjustment of other macro aggregates will take longer.
In addition to the assumptions made regarding refugee migration itself, we also need
to make assumptions regarding the resulting fiscal implications. All in all, we initially
assume that annual fiscal expenditure comes to 0.6% of GDP for migration at a rate equal
to 1% of the native population (see German Federal Statistical Office, Destatis, 2016, for
the cost assumptions used and their composition; the increase in staff costs is assumed
to be caused by a corresponding increase in staffing levels). This expenditure includes
direct transfers to asylum seekers (20%), an increase in social security and other non-
financial benefits (70%) as well as a rise in refugee support staff costs (10%). As a next
step, these data can be used to calculate transfers, government consumption and staff
costs per refugee, which come in at around 1,250 Euro per month (the latest estimates
put this figure at 1,000 Euro, but that does not detract from the general thrust of the
analysis). The gradual absorption of refugees by the labour market reduces the aggregate
expenditure, since it is paid only per capita as long as refugees have not joined the labour
market and is discontinued altogether once they have. The individuals concerned then
receive transfers equal to the "standard" transfers for their respective qualification group.
In other words, if it is assumed that further expenditure on integration measures remains
necessary even after refugees have joined Germany's labour market, which may not be
unlikely, the present simulation would understate the corresponding costs and should be
regarded as a lower bound.
It is assumed that these costs are not immediately financed but that over the long
term, they will have funding that comes into play after four years in the form of a non-
distortionary lump-sum tax that is payable (only) by non-liquidity-constrained ­ forward-
looking and well-qualified ­ households, this funding acting to bring the debt ratio back
to the starting level in the long run and then keeping it at a constant level. Although no
such tax exists in the real world, it is a useful tool for modelling consolidation in model
simulations (see also Attinasi et al, 2016 for a more detailed discussion). In effect, this
assumption can prevent the emergence of additional distortions that are not triggered
4The transition rates are indeed chosen ad hoc due to the lack of reliable data. Recent findings of the
German Institute for Employment Research however suggests that, while indeed being lower qualified than
the average native German on average, refugees coming to Germany may not be too different from native
German population in terms of their ideals and educational prospects (IAB, 2016b). B¨
onke and Neidh¨
ofer
(2016) show that, at least in the second generation, past (Italian) immigrants who came to Germany did
not face worse educational prospects than their German counterparts, whereas Hatton (2013) provides
evidence that refugees integrate more slowly than other immigrants. On the other hand, Aslund and
Rooth (2007) suggest that good labour market conditions and low unemployment rates ­ as we currently
observe in Germany ­ should speed up labour market integration. Hence, assuming 60 years for the
refugee generation(s) to adjust to the German one does not seem to be overly implausible. Nevertheless,
in an appendix, we will also show the transition dynamics if all the migrants become/remain (i) high-
productivity, (ii) medium-productivity or (iii) low-productivity employees as a robustness analysis. In
these cases, pop,x

is chosen such that the corresponding long-run equilibrium is reached. We concentrate
only on the baseline scenario in the main text.

by migration itself. Thus, using this tax as a fiscal instrument would allow the effects
shown to be attributed solely to the assumed population growth and government spending
increase. The simulation results presented later in this paper show the long-term change
in the lump-sum tax needed to stabilise the debt level. A positive value denotes a fiscal
burden, while a negative value stands for relief. In principle, it can be said that in the case
of a fiscal burden and the use of a distortionary fiscal instrument ­ distortionary labour
income taxes, for example ­ the effects on macro aggregates outlined below will be more
negative depending on the increase in the degree of distortion triggered by the instrument
used. The opposite holds true in the case of relief. In the long run, aggregate government
consumption and investment expenditure expands in line with the 1% population growth,
thereby leaving the respective government per capita expenditure at a constant level.
3 Refugee migration in Germany: the possible long-
term effects
Table 1 gives an overview of the above-described long-term population growth in Ger-
many as well as its assumed distribution among the various categories. It also shows the
population percentage of highly-skilled, medium-skilled and unskilled households result-
ing from the above-described assumptions in the new steady state. It is obvious that, in
the baseline scenario, this does not differ from the original steady state. In all the other
scenarios, the percentage share of those into which the immigrants are classified increases
in line with the assumptions, while the other percentage shares decline.

Table 2 shows the long-term effects of refugee migration on selected macroeconomic
variables. Overall, it should be noted that the population growth of 1% of the original do-
mestic population boosts gross domestic product (GDP). GDP growth is smaller (larger)
than 1% if the immigrant refugees' level of productivity lies below (above) the average
level of productivity of the original domestic population. In the baseline scenario, GDP
growth is slightly below the growth in population, which is explained by the relative in-
crease in the German population's percentage share of the world's total population. As a
result, GDP per capita falls slightly in the baseline scenario, although we feel that this is
10
more in the area of uncertainty and not the central outcome of the simulation and should
therefore not be overinterpreted.
From the point of view of the model, this latter effect can be explained as follows.
The increase in population in Germany means that, with a given export demand for
German goods, per capita export demand falls ceteris paribus. This can be interpreted
as an "exogenous" demand shock (especially with regard to demand from the rest of the
world, since demand per capita there is given exogenously). To partly compensate for this,
German firms lower their prices, resulting in a fall in the relative price of German goods.
In the long run, however, this increases the relative costs of capital for German firms, as
households in the old and new steady state demand a given (in the end, parameter-fixed)
real rate of interest in order to invest in capital. Relatively speaking, a given long-term
real rate of interest measured by the price of the bundle of goods thus increases businesses'
capital costs.5 This leads to firms reducing their capital input, which (in relative terms)
results in slight losses of output. Ultimately, this is due to the fact that Germany's
population weight in the world has been increased exogenously. In a closed economy (or
given corresponding population growth at home and abroad) this effect would be non-
existent, resulting in the per capita variables remaining unchanged. How momentous this
price effect is in reality and whether it can be compensated for by alternative modelling
of firm entries and exits (as in, for example, Alessandria and Choi, 2007, or Ghironi
and Melitz, 2005) or possibly changes in product market regulation (as in, for example,
Cavallari, 2010) is something that cannot be examined in the present analysis. This
could, however, be a component of future research on the macroeconomic effects of refugee
migration.
It is intuitively obvious that the GDP effect is all the greater, the more skilled the
immigrants are. If all the refugees are/remain low-skilled workers, GDP increases by no
more than just under 0.6%, whereas the increase is all the higher, the more skills they
acquire. The negative effects on GDP per capita are then also commensurately smaller
(or more positive) depending on how much better the long-term skills level of the refugees
is/becomes.
In all cases, there is an increase in aggregate private consumption in Germany after
the refugee migration in the long term. However, the increase in consumption mostly
slightly lags the increase in GDP, resulting in aggregate consumption per capita being
somewhat reduced as a rule ­ with the exception of the scenario in which it is assumed
that refugee migration has a positive impact on the structure of productivity in Germany
in the long term. Differing reactions of individual private consumption occur, however,
within the various categories (of highly-skilled, medium-skilled and unskilled households).
If all the immigrants become highly skilled over the long term, the per capita consumption
of the highly-skilled category decreases, while the medium-skilled and unskilled households
increase their per capita consumption. The converse applies if all the refugees become
medium-skilled or remain unskilled over the long term. In the baseline scenario, all
households are faced with slight falls in per capita consumption. This can be explained
5In order to not consume today but to invest in capital (or assets), households want to be compensated
for this consumption-utility loss by higher expected consumption-utility tomorrow. The latter is, in the
end, given by their discount factor   (0, 1), which is a fixed parameter, and which determines the real
interest rate to be 1/-1 in steady state. Lower selling prices in the new steady state, however, relatively
increase capital costs of firms as  is fixed.
11
primarily by the restrained growth in total per capita gross wages and salaries (which runs
roughly in parallel with per capita GDP) as well as the above-described slightly reduced
input of capital (see also Table 3).
Thus, households' consumption adjustments are primarily determined by the labour
market developments described in detail below (see also Table 3). Generally, it is possible
to state at this stage already that the individual labour income of each of the types of
household falls (rises) if the category turns out to be larger (smaller) once the immigrants
have become fully integrated.
Besides labour income, a part for highly-skilled/optimising households is also played by
the earnings performance as well as the tax burden (as described in section 2.2, expressed
as a change in the lump-sum tax only levied on this type of household). The aggregate
corporate profits distributed only to these households grow roughly in line with GDP. This
means that the average per capita profit distribution falls (increases) if the percentage
population growth in this segment is above (below) the increase in aggregate profits.
If all the refugees become highly skilled, this percentage share of the population grows
substantially more strongly than the profits (see also Table 1), and the relevant per capita
earnings of the highly-skilled households decline. In the baseline scenario, there are no
significant gains/losses in earnings, whereas the per capita profits show an increase in the
last two scenarios.
The state of public finances (ie the primary deficit ratio - calculated excluding the
lump-sum tax) deteriorates slightly, especially in the scenarios with lower-skilled immi-
gration because there is a decline in per capita income tax, consumption tax and capital
gains tax revenues in real terms, while real spending per capita (deflated by domestic
prices) remain largely constant.6 The fiscal situation improves only in the scenario in
which the immigrants are all highly skilled in the long term; this can be attributed to
the increase in the tax assessment bases in real terms ­ which more than offsets the rise
in spending ­ and, to a lesser extent, to the denominator effect (rising GDP per capita).
A slightly higher primary deficit can be translated into a hike in the per capita lump-
sum tax that is levied only on the highly-skilled households. This per capita increase
is ceteris paribus all the smaller, the larger the number of people among whom it can
be spread; this is especially relevant in those scenarios in which refugees also become
highly-skilled/optimising households over the long term (see Table 2).
In summary, the per capita consumption of highly-skilled households increases in those
scenarios in which these households benefit from the increases in profits as well as gross
wages and salaries that more than offset the hike in tax, ie the scenarios in which the
immigrant refugees become only medium or low-skilled even in the long term. If all
refugees become highly-skilled households in the long term, both the lower per capita
6In the baseline scenarios, the deficit ratio, the interest expenditure ratio and the primary deficit ratio
are (approximately) unchanged in the long term, since it is assumed that the debt ratio is stabilised
and unchanged compared with the situation taken as a starting point and the long-term interest and
growth conditions are (almost) unchanged. The change in the primary deficit ratios shown in Table 2 is
calculated excluding the change in lump-sum tax. The table shows how the primary deficit ratio changes
without a policy change due to the assumed population growth. To compensate for this, a corresponding
cut or hike in the lump-sum tax is required, since the deficit ratio ­ as mentioned ­ ultimately remains
unchanged. A negative value in Table 2 means that the primary deficit ratio has fallen (fiscal growth is
more positive) and, to that extent, the per capita taxes can be lowered taking into account the real tax
payments on government debt. The opposite holds for a positive value.
12
profit distributions and the lower per capita level of employment with simultaneously
lower wages (see Table 3) are high enough to more than offset the slight cut in the
lump-sum tax. In this case, the per capita consumption of highly-skilled households also
declines, which remains the case to a lesser extent in the baseline scenario.
Table 3 shows the long-term labour market trends triggered by refugee immigration
given various scenarios.

Note: Table shows percentage (point) changes of new long-run steady-state values of selected
labour market variables relative to initial steady state taking. By taking into account changes
in domestic prices, wage changes are related to real wages.
Population growth increases the aggregate supply of labour. Owing to the overall rise
13
in macroeconomic output and the capital stock, the aggregate demand for labour also
rises at the same time. In the aggregate of the baseline scenario, the increases in supply
and demand cancel each other out, causing the aggregate unemployment rate to remain
constant. If only permanently low-skilled households immigrate, the aggregate unemploy-
ment rate goes up slightly, which is due to the fact that the immigrating refugees remain
in a category that is characterised by an above-average unemployment rate, and therefore
the aggregate unemployment rate rises. The category-specific ­ individual ­ ratios remain
constant in all the scenarios. Category-specific per capita employment remains virtually
unchanged as well, with the category-specific aggregate change in employment developing
in line with the percentage category-specific change in population (see also Table 1).
The per capita employment and unemployment rates are held constant in the new
long-term equilibrium by adjusting the long-term wages. Generally speaking, an increase
in the potential labour force lowers wage claims, with the decline in the baseline scenario
being the result of marginally lower output per capita (which is to be qualified as de-
scribed above, however). Here, redistributions among the categories may occur if there is
immigration into a specific category. If, for example, all immigrants become highly-skilled,
wages will fall in this segment of the labour market, yet rise in the other segments. Much
the same applies to long-term immigration into the medium and unskilled segment. Since
immigrants move into all the categories in the baseline scenario, wages show an equally
slight fall in all the categories in this case. Growth of the household-specific sum of gross
wages and gross salaries derives in the baseline scenario from wage changes resulting from
wage negotiations, not from changes in employment. For the aggregate, the respective
increase in population then also has to be taken into account. These wage changes are
primarily responsible for the changes in consumption shown in Table 2.
In summary, this means that individual employees are generally affected (more) neg-
atively by population growth with regard to wage losses if they are in direct competition
with the immigrants. The other categories, on the other hand, gain slightly.7
4 Refugee migration in Germany: the possible short
to medium-term effects
The text below sets out the short to medium term macroeconomic effects that are incurred
if, in addition to the permanent change in demographics described in the previous section,
account is also taken of the migration-induced time shifts in Germany's demographic
structure and the resulting fiscal demand effects (in the shape of a temporary deficit-
increasing rise in government spending) as outlined in section 2.2. In each case, an
overview is provided of developments over the first ten years. The adjustment path
towards the new long-term equilibrium detailed above which spans a period of around 60
years is presented in its entirety in the annex. We focus on the baseline scenario in the
main text, while the graphs for the other scenarios are relegated to the appendix, too.
As we can see, the general findings discussed in the main text go through except that,
of course, the new long-run steady state discussed in the previous section will be reached
correspondingly.
7This does not hold entirely, however, if two categories of employees are easily substitutable. In this
case, the effects would be distributed more equally among both categories.
14
Figure 1 shows the population growth that may be expected to arise from the as-
sumptions described in section 2.2 for the first ten years following the influx of migrants,
assuming that the country's long-term demographic structure does not change in terms
of people's skills (as assumed in the long-term baseline scenario). As alternative sce-
narios, simulations are made of what will happen if i) the demographic structure of the
new steady state occurs immediately (dashed red line) and if ii) no long-term population
increase occurs but there is nevertheless an initial rise in government spending (a pure
stimulus simulation; green dotted line that is not distinguishable in Figure 1 as it is ob-
scured by the zero/blue line in the bottom right-hand panel). Scenario ii) accordingly
illustrates how the economy would have evolved in the absence of long-term migration
but with a fiscal stimulus of the magnitude of initial migration-induced spending.

Figure 2 shows the development of selected macrovariables that results from the growth
in population and its underlying structure. The refugee migration triggers an aggregate
increase in demand (=stimulus),8 because the population rises immediately and the as-
sumption is made that all immigrants consume the total volume of received transfers in
the course of the first year and that government consumption (exogenously assumed) is
raised.9 This causes aggregate GDP to increase, rising the most strongly (and, ultimately,
persistently) if it is assumed that the final state of Germany's demographic structure (in
8The simulation envisaged by the German Council of Economic Experts (SVR, 2015) that is mentioned
in the introduction assumes that exogenously determined government spending and transfers rise for a
period of three years before then returning to their original level according to the estimated fiscal rules.
The pure stimulus simulation presented here is broadly similar, except that the strength and trajectory
of the stimulus have been adapted to match the other scenarios.
9In the scenario in which refugees possess the same skills as the native population from the outset, no
direct demand stimulus is generated, as section 2.2 makes clear.
15
line with the qualifications acquired in the end) sets in immediately. In the baseline
scenario, in which refugees start out as transfer recipients before gradually migrating to
the labour market, the initial increase is roughly equal in size to that seen in the pure
fiscal stimulus simulation and slowly grows alongside the corresponding demographic shift
(see Figure 1) to reach the new equilibrium level described in the preceding section. In
the case of the pure stimulus simulation, the stimulus dissipates and GDP consequently
returns to its original level. In the baseline simulation, GDP per capita first increases
before then falling as the labour force expands, initially in terms of a growing number of
low-skilled workers. Over time it then reverts to its starting level as the pattern adapts to
the original qualification structure (see also section 3 as well as Figure A.2 in the annex).
Since the population in the pure stimulus simulation remains the same, GDP and per
capita GDP move in the same direction here.
Developments in the labour market are depicted in Figure 3. In the case of the stimulus
simulation, the effects are as one would expect. The need to raise production pushes
up labour input and brings unemployment down, causing wages to rise. As the stimulus
dissipates, the system returns to equilibrium. However, wages respond fairly sluggishly on
account of the wage adjustment costs. In the simulation entailing a permanent increase in
the size of the population and the immediate onset of the original demographic structure,
the unemployment rate rises because the labour supply is "suddenly" broadened. The
average per capita length of employment decreases because more individuals are out of
work, causing wages to fall (comparatively rapidly) during the adjustment process, leading
to higher demand for labour. However, owing to wage adjustment costs, it takes more
than 5 years (20 quarters) for the labour market to return to a state of equilibrium.
The baseline scenario set out in section 2.2 in which refugees successively migrate to the
labour market then amounts to a blend of the two scenarios described earlier. At first, it is
the stimulus effect that dominates (to a slight degree), but this is subsequently supplanted
by the effect of population growth. The initial wage effects are weaker here than in the
pure stimulus simulation as wage negotiations, in particular, are conducted in a forward-
looking manner and the economic actors anticipate population growth (as well as the new
long-term equilibrium). In the case of highly and medium-skilled households, no wage
losses occur along the entire transition path because refugees do not compete with these
households until the increase in GDP has reached a level that prohibits employers from
any longer threatening to do away with these employees' jobs during the wage negotiation
process in a significant manner as they are dependent on these workers' productive labour
input.
The per capita consumption growth of medium and low-skilled households is deter-
mined by the way in which the labour market evolves (see Figure 2 for details of con-
sumption and Figure 3 for labour market trends). In line with wage and employment
developments, per capita consumption of both the aforementioned groups thus goes up
at first before dipping below the baseline slightly over time so as to return to its original
level (see also Figure A.3 in the annex) for low-skilled employees.

In the case of both these groups aggregate consumption is more than offset in the
medium term by the accompanying population increase. Aside from the relevance of
direct wage developments, highly-skilled/optimising households also anticipate the long-
term loss of income that results from a slightly reduced employment rate together with
lower wages and from lower per capita profit distributions alongside higher lump-sum taxes
(in each case in the new steady state; see section 3) and are already scaling back their
consumption accordingly in line with the permanent income hypothesis. The per capita
consumption of these households only rises when wages themselves rise by a significant
enough margin. When calculating aggregate consumption, it is also necessary to consider
the corresponding demographics of the group in question. Aggregate macroeconomic con-
sumption increases immediately because, for one thing, the short-term consumption losses
incurred by highly-skilled households is more than offset by increased consumption on the
part of medium-skilled and unskilled households, and for another, additional private con-
sumption demand is generated by households that previously did not exist. Since these
households are, however, (low-income) transfer recipients whose level of consumption is
therefore below average ­ and destined to remain so on account of the assumed demo-
graphic trend ­ per capita private consumption demand initially declines in the baseline
scenario before rising again (the consumption demand of transfer recipients is not explic-
itly shown as per capita consumption of this group is fixed to transfers).
5 Conclusions
Refugee migration, its repercussions, and the manner in which these two issues are being
addressed remain at the forefront of political discourse in Germany to this day. While
some aspects of this topic are not related to economics, it is important to assess the
potential macroeconomic consequences and, thus, the potential costs and benefits for
domestic agents. This paper adds to the literature by simulating various scenarios and
their economic impacts with the aid of a New Keynesian DSGE model.
In summary, this paper finds that measures that cause the migrant qualification struc-
ture to closely match that of the native population over the long term do not lead to GDP
and consumption losses, yet partial or total failure to close the skills gap can very well have
negative economic consequences. A failure to integrate migrants could reduce per capita
output and consumption by 0.38% and 0.43%, respectively, while integration measures
that improve the qualification structure in Germany could even yield per capita output
and consumption gains of 0.32% and 0.38%, respectively.
The present paper adds to the debate by explicitly taking into account short and
long-term effects and identifying what should be interpreted in the debate as "stimulus"
and as a structural effect of refugee migration, besides showing how short and long-term
factors interact with one another. However, it is not providing concrete guidance on how
good integration can be a success. This, however, is a topic that should be addressed
further by future research.

Appendix
In this appendix, we fill first show the adjustments over the entire transition path in the
baseline scenario before showing transitional dynamics if refugees remain i) low-skilled,
ii) become only medium-skilled or iii) all become highly skilled. Then, we will focus on
the model description and calibration.
A.1 Developments via entire adjustment path in base-
line scenario
In this section of the appendix, we show the entire transition path of the baseline scenario
from the old to the new steady state after refugee migration. The figures are analogous
to Figures 1 to 3 in the main text, and so is their description.

B.1 Model description and calibration
In this section, we provide a more detailed description of the model, which is, in principle, a
shortened repetition of the model description provided by Gadatsch et al (2016) including
the modifications necessary for the simulations in the present paper. Note that we omit
the description of shocks because they are not relevant for the analysis at hand.
We assume that the world consists of three regions, two of them member of the Eu-
ropean Monetary Union (EMU). The third region, representing the rest of the world, is
modelled as a three-equation VAR. Without loss of generality, we index country-a agents
in the interval [0, Pa
t
], where ¯
Pa = 1 in the initial steady state, country-b agents in [0, Pb]
and country-c agents in [0, Pc]. Hence, Pj, with j = b, c, is the initial steady-state size of
country j relative to country a. We will continue by presenting the necessary equations
for country a(=Germany), where our model modifications come in.
Firms: In each country, there is a measure-Pi
t
, with i = a, b, c, continuum of firms
in the final goods sector. Firms are owned by optimising households. Each final goods
producer purchases a variety of differentiated intermediate goods, bundles these and sells
them to the final consumer under perfect competition. The producer price index (PPI)
of goods produced in country i and sold in j is defined as Pi,j
t
. We assume that the
law of one price holds across regions, so firms in country a set their price Pa,a
t
for all
markets. Multiplying with the nominal exchange rate, then, yields the price of country-a
goods charged in the other countries, that is Pb,a
t
= Sb,a
t
Pa,a
t
and Pc,a
t
= Sc,a
t
Pa,a
t
, where
the nominal exchange rate Sj,a
t
is defined as country j currency per unit of country-a
currency. Clearly, Sj,a
t
is one within the monetary union. The maximization problem of
the representative final goods firm reads

.
Private intermediate goods firms on the continuum z  [0, Pa
t
] operate as monopolistic
competitors in the product market. Each firm produces its intermediate good variety with
the Cobb-Douglas production function presented in the main text, equation (1). Note
that, here, we deviate from the original model provided in Gadatsch et al (2016). Taking
into account that the capital-to-labour ratio is common to all firms in equilibrium, this
yields equations (3) and (4) of the main text, from which we can also derive real marginal
costs mca
t
.
Each intermediate goods producer sets its own price Pa,a
t
(z) to maximize intertempo-
ral profits: the difference between revenues and production as well as Rotemberg price
adjustment costs, the latter indicated by a cost parameter a
. The maximization problem

 [0, 1] determines the

t-1
, or steady-state inflation, ¯
a,a.
Because optimisers own firms the intertemporal discount factor of a firm includes only
the marginal utility of optimising, highly-skilled households, a
h,t
.
Households: As mentioned in the main text, we assume that the economy is pop-
ulated by three types of representative households: highly, medium- and low-productive
households, indexed by x = h, m, l. Only highly-skilled households save and borrow, such
that the remaining population is assumed to be liquidity constrained as in Gali et al
(2007). The corresponding population shares µa,x
t
are given in the main text. Further-
more, following Gali et al (2011), household members are represented by the unit square
and indexed by a pair (hx
, jx
)  [0, 1] × [0, 1]. Household members differ in the type of
labour service they are specialized in, hx
 [0, 1], and by their personal disutility of work,
jx
 [0, 1]. The latter is given by w
a,x
· ja
x
if employed and zero otherwise. w
a,x
> 0 is
an exogenous labour disutility scaling parameter. a
> 0 determines the shape of the
distribution of work disutilities across individual household members. Values not indexed
by x are common across household types. Assuming that the utility of household mem-
bers positively depends on consumption and that there is full risk sharing of consumption
within a household as, for instance, in Andolfatto (1996), the utility of household-type x
can be written as Et

is the elasticity of substitution between
these goods. Ci,j
x,t

Nominal consumption expenditures of households amount to (1 + c,a
t
) Pa
t
Ca
x,t
, where
c,a
t
is the consumption tax rate. Income of liquidity-constrained households is given by
net wage income from employment in the private and the public sector, nP,x,a
t
and nG,x,a
t
,
paying nominal gross wages Wa,x
t
and WG,a,x
t
, with x = m, l which are both taxed by the
rate w,a
t
. Note that, in contrast to Gadatsch et al (2016), we now index employment
and wages by x as we no longer assume that wage bargaining and uniform employment
distribution are undertaken by one economy-wide union but that they are determined
at the household level. Unemployed household members receive nominal unemployment
benefits Pa
t
· UBa,x. Those members who decided to participate in the labor market, La
x,t
,
but who did not find a job are unemployed, i.e. Ua
x,t
= La
x,t
-na,x
t
, are unemployed. Taken
together, and noting that liquidity-constrained consumers spend their entire income each
period, their budget constraint in real CPI-terms becomes

Labour demand and supply: Turning to labour demand, we have to differentiate
between private and public sector demand. As in Forni et al (2009), we assume that labour
demand in the public sector gets uniformly allocated among household types, where the
public sector sets nG,a
t
= nG,x,a
t
. Consistent with OECD data we assume that, in steady
state, type-specific public sector wages include a markup, mga, on type-specific private
sector wages.
In the private sector, a perfectly competitive agency buys the differentiated individual
labor services supplied by households, transforms them into a homogenous but still type-
specific composite of labor input, nP,x,a
t
, and sells that to intermediate goods producers,
who demand different labour types according to equations (2) and (3). Hence, labour
agencies solve for each variety of labor service, h,

t
(h)dh = WBa
t
. The
solution of this problem is the standard private-sector labor demand for each variety. w
a,x
is the type-specific labour substitution.
Taking labour market conditions (i.e. wages and employment) as given, any household
member specialised in type hx
labor will find it optimal to participate in the labour market
if and only if utility from working exceeds his or her disutility. When defining the marginal
member for which this condition holds with equality as La
x,t
and noting that jx
 [0, 1],
La
x,t
can be seen as the labour supply of household-type x; see Gali et al (2011) for a more
detailed discussion. Hence, the labor supply decision of households can be summarized as
a
x,t

(B.9)
where a
x,t
is the corresponding marginal utility of consumption.
Wage setting: In contrast to Gadatsch et al (2016), we no longer assume that there
is a utilitarian union that sets an economy-wide wage but that households will undertake
their wage setting themselves. This implies that, for each household type x = h, m, l,
there will be a different wage. But, within each household type, there will be no wage
differential. Besides this, wage setting is modelled analogously. Hence, a household max-
imises income of its members by optimally choosing nominal wages Wa,x
t
(h), taking into
account the disutility of work and the effects on labour supply and demand. Furthermore,
wage setting is due to Rotemberg adjustment costs, indicated by the parameter w
a
. For-
mally, each union maximizes with respect to Wa,x

t

t
(h) = Lx,a

and nP,x,a
t
(h) = NP,x,a
t
for all h in equilibrium. Defining La
t
= µhLh,a
t
+ µmLm,a
t
+ µlLl,a
t
as the total labor force, we can then define the economy-wide unemployment rate as
URa
t
= (La
t
- Na
t
) /La
t
, where Na
t
= µhnh,a
t
+ µmnm,a
t
+ µlnl,a
t
. As in the case of price
setting of goods, we allow for potential indexation on past wage inflation, a
w,t-1
, and
steady-state wage inflation, indicated by the parameter w
a
 [0, 1].
Policy and market clearing: Fiscal and monetary policy are model exactly the
same as in Gadatsch et al (2016). Therefore, and because they are standard anyway, we
omit presenting the relevant equations here. However, note that, as we now have three
household types instead of two, and as we allow for group-specific wages, fiscal revenues
and spending must be adjusted to take account of this. Furthermore, in the equations
determining aggregate demand and international trade in goods and assets, we must allow
for German population to be time-varying, ie we need to set Pa = Pa
t
wherever it appears,
while Pa
t
is defined in equation (5).
Calibration: In calibrating the model, we strongly rely on the main parameter
values presented in Gadatsch et al (2016), who estimated the baseline GEAR model
(without different skill groups and population growth) for Germany during the period
1999 to 2013. As the targets for the rest of the Euro Area (RoE) are exactly the same,
we omit their presentation here, which also holds for the parameter calibration.

Note: Table shows target values that the initial steady state of the model is supposed to
replicate. They are based on Gadatsch et al (2016). For the unemployment rates, we deviate
from the original paper as we are aiming at capturing the group-specific unemployment rates
given by IAB (2016a) as described in section 2.1. Furthermore, we target group-specific wage
differentials to match those also described in section 2.1 (see Destatis, 2016a), which allows
us to obtain the values for i
N
presented in Table B.2.
As in Gadatsch et al (2016) we will first set some target values which the initial steady
state of the model is supposed to reflect. These target values are based on EMU data
described in more detail in Gadatsch et al (2016) and they are summarised in Table
43
B.1. As Gadatsch et al (2016), we also target a net foreign asset position of zero and a
real exchange rate of one in the initial steady state, which allows us to obtain the the
consumption/investment preferences for domestically produced and foreign goods, ni
j
, in
the private consumption/investment baskets. We also normalise German GDP to one
and set GDP in the rest of the Euro Area to 0.871 in order to capture per capita GDP
differences observed in the data. Furthermore, we assume that the economies comply
with the Maastricht criteria in the long run and set the debt-to-GDP ratio to 60%.
The parameter values are standard values from the literature or taken from estimates
in Gadatsch et al (2016). A detailed description on the parameter choice ­ at least those
that we are able to set autonomously ­ can be found there. However, note that, as the
model used in the present paper entails some modifications, we need to derive some of
the parameter values "endogenously" to have our model match the targeted steady state.
Table B.2 summarises our parameter choice, pointing out those parameters that deviate
from those in Gadatsch et al (2016).10

10Furthermore, remember that, as described in section 2.2, we only use lump-sum taxes as the debt-
stabilising instrument. Hence, we assume all the other feedback parameters in the fiscal rules to be zero.
We also need to increase  (slightly) to 15 in order to guarantee stationarity in the model.

Note: Table shows calibrated parameter values. They are standard values from the literature
or taken from estimates in Gadatsch et al (2016). Those that we had to endogenously calculate
in order for our modified model to replicate the steady state indicated by Table B.1 are marked
by an e. While one may expect the parameter N to have significant effects on the results,
it can be shown that its influence is on the outcome only minor, especially in the long run.
However, wage differentials between skill groups decrease when substitutability increases,
especially along the transition (results can be send upon request).
