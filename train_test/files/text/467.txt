Social Regulation of Health: Consequences
for Health and Health Risk Behavior

Objectives. This study estimates the effects of the transition to widowhood on changes in the social regulation of health
and examines the consequences of this association for health and health risk behavior following spousal death.
Methods. Analysis of longitudinal data from the Changing Lives of Older Couples Study tests the following
hypotheses: (a) Widowed individuals experience greater declines in health regulation over time than their married
counterparts and (b) the extent to which widowhood undermines health and increases health risk behavior depends on
whether it is accompanied by a decline in health regulation.
Results. Compared with their continually married counterparts, those who experience the transition to widowhood
report a significant decline in the frequency of health reminders and health assistance received from others. The decline in
the frequency of health regulation has important consequences for health behavior and health outcomes. Widowhood
undermines health and increases health risk behaviors only when it is accompanied by a decline in health regulation.
Widowed individuals who experience increases in health regulation show improvements in health and declines in health
risk behavior.
Discussion. Interventions targeted at improving the health habits of widowed individuals by mobilizing health-related
support systems may be effective at minimizing the negative health consequences of spousal loss.
ASUBSTANTIAL body of evidence indicates that widow-
hood is associated with declines in health and increases in
mortality risk for surviving spouses (Martikainen & Valkonen,
1996; Mineau, Smith, & Bean, 2002; Schaefer, Quesenberry, &
Wi, 1995; Stroebe & Stroebe, 1987; Zick & Smith, 1996). A
range of mechanisms may account for this association,
including the loss of social support, the stress of bereavement,
and adjustments to managing a household alone (Ross,
Mirowsky, & Goldsteen, 1990; Stroebe & Stroebe, 1987;
Umberson, Wortman, & Kessler, 1992). Research and theory
on the health benefits of marriage suggest that the social control
and regulation of health provided by a spouse constitute an
additional mechanism that explains its salutary effects on health
and well-being (Umberson, 1987, 1992). For example, spouses
tend to encourage each other to engage in healthy behaviors
(e.g., exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, and regular
medical check-ups) and to avoid behaviors that might
compromise health (e.g., excessive alcohol consumption,
cigarette smoking, and other forms of risk taking). Thus, the
deleterious health consequences of widowhood may be due in
part to the loss of a primary source of health regulation.
Although convincing evidence indicates that married individ-
uals receive more frequent health-related reminders from
significant others than the unmarried (Umberson, 1992), the
importance of this mechanism in explaining the negative health
consequences of widowhood, per se, remains largely un-
explored.
The aim of the current study is to examine the effects of the
transition to widowhood on the frequency of health reminders
received from others. Previous research suggests that because
spouses are a primary source of health reminders, the transition
to widowhood will be associated with a decline in the
frequency of health regulation. I further hypothesize that
changes in the frequency of health regulation have important
consequences for the health and health-related behaviors of
older widowed adults. Specifically, whether the transition to
widowhood undermines health or increases risky health
behaviors should depend on the extent to which it is
accompanied by a decline in the frequency of health regulation.
Widowhood, Social Control, and Health: Understanding
the Pathways
Widowhood appears to pose substantial health risks to
surviving spouses, especially to men (Martikainen & Valkonen,
1996; Mineau et al., 2002; Schaefer et al., 1995; Stroebe &
Stroebe, 1993; Umberson et al., 1992). Theoretical work that
attempts to account for the negative effects of widowhood on
health derives primarily from the larger research literature on
the association of marital status with health and well-being.
Decades of research in the social and biological sciences
indicate that married individuals feel healthier, have fewer
illnesses, are less depressed, and live longer than the unmarried
(Hemstrom, 1996; Lillard & Waite, 1995; Rogers, 1995; also
see Waite & Gallagher, 2000).
Researchers have only recently begun to identify and
understand the mechanisms through which emotionally sup-
portive social relationships, especially marriage, enhance
health. The stress-alleviating role of social support has received
the most attention (House, Landis, & Umberson, 1988).
Supportive personal relationships such as marriage appear to

enhance the immune system (Cohen, 1988; Kiecolt-Glaser &
Glaser, 1987) and normalize cardiovascular reactivity to socio-
environmental stressors (Cohen, 1988). In addition, the loss of
the marital role through divorce or widowhood is itself stressful
and may expose individuals to additional strains such as financial
problems and secondary role changes (Booth & Amato, 1991;
Umberson et al., 1992; Williams, Takeuchi, & Adair, 1992).
Researchers have given much less attention to examining the
importance of the controlling or regulatory functions of
marriage, which may promote healthy behaviors. According
to this argument, marriage and other strong social ties affect
health in part because significant others, especially spouses,
encourage individuals to engage in behaviors that promote
health (e.g., exercise, weight management) and to avoid risky
behaviors (e.g., smoking) (Umberson, 1992). In support of this
idea, evidence indicates that married men are more likely than
the unmarried to have someone who reminds them to engage in
health-enhancing behavior and to avoid practices that compro-
mise health (Umberson, 1992). Further, the benefits of marriage
for health regulation seem to be especially important for men,
in part because gender roles assign women primary responsi-
bility for the care and health of the family (Nathanson, 1977;
Waldron, 1988).
Although some research suggests that the health-regulatory
functions of marriage are partly responsible for its salubrious
effects (Umberson, 1987, 1992), data and other limitations have
inhibited stringent tests of this hypothesized causal pathway.
Most significant is the lack of longitudinal data. In a cross-
sectional study of marital status, social control, and health
behavior, Umberson (1992) found that being married is
associated with more frequent social control efforts. However,
because socially isolated individuals are less likely than others
to marry and less likely to receive frequent health reminders,
selection of the most socially integrated individuals into
marriage may partly account for cross-sectional associations.
In the current study, measurement of the social regulation of
health at more than one point in time allows for a more
stringent test of a causal relationship because it facilitates the
examination of the effects of a marital transition (e.g.,
widowhood) on a subsequent change in the frequency of
health reminders.
It is particularly important to understand the effects of the
transition to widowhood on health regulation, health risk
behaviors, and health outcomes. Because health declines more
rapidly in later years when widowhood is most commonly
experienced, the widowed may be especially vulnerable to the
negative health consequences of unhealthy practices such as
lack of exercise, improper nutrition, lack of sleep, or alcohol
abuse--each of which may be influenced by the loss of
a spouse. In addition, socioemotional selectivity theory
suggests that widowhood may have especially significant
consequences for the control and regulation of health behaviors.
According to this perspective, individuals narrow their social
networks as they age and begin to focus more exclusively on
primary relationships such as marriage (Carstensen, 1992).
Thus, in later years, the spouse may become increasingly
important as a source of both social support and the social
regulation of health. If this is true, exiting marriage in later life
through widowhood may have especially strong negative
effects on health behavior and overall health status.
The Current Study
Prior research has given little attention to establishing clear
linkages between marital status, the social regulation of health,
and actual health outcomes. Marriage appears to be associated
with healthier behavior (Umberson, 1987) and more frequent
health regulation (Umberson, 1992). More frequent regulation
of health is, in turn, associated with positive changes in health
behavior (Lewis & Rook, 1999; Umberson, 1992). Further,
entire research literatures in public health and health psychol-
ogy document the substantial effects of health behavior on self-
assessed health, morbidity, and mortality. However, the
following possibility remains unexamined: The extent to which
widowhood undermines health and compromises healthy
behavior may depend on whether the transition is accompanied
by a decline in the frequency of health reminders.
In fact, a central hypothesis of the current study is that the
transition to widowhood undermines health and healthy
behaviors only when it is accompanied by a decline in the
frequency of health regulation. Although I expect that the
transition to widowhood will be generally associated with
a decline in the frequency of health reminders (largely due to
the loss of the spouse--a primary source of such reminders), it
may lead to an increase in health regulation for those who
effectively mobilize social support or for those whose spouse
did not provide frequent health reminders in the first place.
When widowhood is accompanied by an increase in health
reminders, the health and health-related behaviors of the
widowed should not decline and may even improve. Support
for these hypotheses could have important implications for
medical professionals and others who provide services to
widowed adults because it would suggest that health promotion
efforts have great potential for reducing any negative effects of
widowhood on morbidity, mortality, and overall health status. It
is important to note that although prior research indicates that
men may be especially vulnerable to the loss of health
regulation with the death of a spouse, currently available
longitudinal data on widowhood and health regulation do not
include a sufficient number of men to allow a meaningful
analysis of gender differences.
METHODS
Data
Data are from the Changing Lives of Older Couples (CLOC)
Study, which is a multiwave, prospective study of spousal
bereavement. Two-stage area probability sampling from the
Detroit (Michigan) Standardized Metropolitan Statistical Area
was used to recruit a sample of 1,532 married men and women.
Eligible respondents were English-speaking members of a mar-
ried couple in which the husband was age 65 or older. The
response rate for the baseline interview was 68% and is consistent
with response rates obtained in similar studies in this area.
Interviewers conducted face-to-face interviews lasting ap-
proximately 2.5 hours from June 1987 through April 1988.
Researchers tracked subsequent spousal death using monthly
death records provided by the state of Michigan and by
monitoring the daily obituaries in Detroit-area newspapers.
Confirmation of death and identification of the cause of death
were obtained from the National Death Index and from direct
WILLIAMS
S344
examination of death certificates. Of the 335 respondents
known to have lost a spouse during the study period, 316 were
contacted for follow-up interviews (19 of those who lost
a spouse died themselves during the interim). Of those
contacted, 263 (83%) participated in at least one of the three
follow-up interviews, which were conducted 6 months (T1), 18
months (T2), and 48 months (T3) after the spouse's death. At
each follow-up, every widowed person was assigned a same-
sex, same-age-matched, nonbereaved control from the baseline
sample who was also interviewed. Although all control subjects
were interviewed in the baseline sample, a given widowed
person may have been assigned a different age- and sex-
matched control at different waves (i.e., the control sample is
not the same at successive waves).
Analyses in the current study were weighted to adjust for
differential response rates at baseline and unequal probabilities
of selection. All models use data from the baseline (T0) sample
and from the 203 widowed persons and 199 matched controls
who were interviewed at 18 months post widowhood (T2) and
whose spouse was not living in a nursing home at the baseline
interview. Although preliminary analyses suggested that widow-
hood may have different consequences for those whose spouse
dies while in a nursing home, the small number of such
respondents prohibited meaningful analysis of these differences.
Measures
Transition to widowhood. --A dummy variable indicates
whether respondents experienced a transition to widowhood
between the baseline and T2 interviews. The variable is coded so
that 1 ¼ transition to widowhood and 0 ¼ continually married.
Social regulation of health. --The social regulation of health
was assessed at each wave with two items in which respondents
were asked to indicate how often someone (a) reminds you to
do things to protect your own health and (b) helps you to take
medications, eat a special diet for health reasons, or use health
care treatments at home (among those who are required to
engage in these behaviors). Response categories for each item
ranged from never (1) to often (3). I standardized each item
using the baseline mean and standard deviation. For those who
engaged in the behaviors outlined in item (b) above, I computed
the arithmetic mean of the two items. I used only the response
on item (a) for those who did not engage in the behaviors
described in item (b).
Change in the social regulation of health among the
continually widowed is included in some models. This variable
was constructed by subtracting the T0 value of health
regulation from the T2 value and centering the difference at
the mean. I used an internal moderator of health regulation
change among the widowed to test the hypothesis that widowed
individuals experience a decline in health and an increase in
health risk behaviors compared with the continually married
control group only when widowhood is accompanied by
a decline in health regulation. Therefore, I assigned a score of
0 (the mean) to the continually married on this internal
moderator variable.
Risky health behavior. --I constructed a dichotomous in-
dicator of risky health behavior by assigning a code of 1 to
those individuals who reported any of the following four health
behaviors or conditions: (a) rarely or never walks or exercises
for pleasure and rarely or never participates in active sports or
exercise; (b) has an unhealthy body weight (defined as a body
mass index of ,18.5 or .25) (U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services, 2000); (c) currently smokes cigarettes;
(d) gets ,7 hours of sleep per 24-hour period, including naps.
Health outcomes. --Two health outcomes were examined.
Self-assessed fair or poor health was constructed by di-
chotomizing responses to the following question: ``How would
you rate your health at the present time?'' Responses of ``fair''
and ``poor'' were combined into a single category and assigned
a code of 1. Those who responded ``good,'' ``very good,'' or
``excellent'' received a code of 0. Self-assessed health is widely
recognized as a valid indicator of overall health status (Ferraro
& Farmer, 1999) and is predictive of subsequent mortality
(Idler & Kasl, 1991). Additional analyses in which this variable
was kept in its original ordinal form indicate that results from
the two approaches are very similar, but the dichotomized
indicator produces slightly more robust results. Moreover,
ordered probit regression is appropriate when the self-assessed
health variable is kept in its ordered form, and these results are
often difficult for the lay reader to interpret.
Morbidity is a dichotomous variable coded 1 if, in the last 6
months, the respondent had one or more serious illnesses and
0 if no serious illnesses were reported. The range of possible
illnesses included lung disease, hypertension, heart disease,
diabetes, cancer, and stroke.
Sociodemographic and other control variables. --All models
control for a range of sociodemographic variables including sex
(1 ¼ female), education in years, age in years, race (1 ¼ White),
and total household income in dollars at baseline. Respondents
provided their total household income at baseline by indicating
which of 10 income categories most accurately characterized
their economic status. The midpoint of these categories was
used to derive a continuous indicator of income. All models
also control for whether or not the spouse had an illness or
disability at baseline that required the provision of care (1 ¼
yes). The provision of care to a spouse at baseline is positively
associated with subsequent widowhood but may also affect the
baseline measurement of health and health behaviors, especially
when the baseline assessment is taken near the time of
widowhood.
Time from baseline to widowhood. --A strength of the
CLOC Study is that the time from widowhood to subsequent
follow-up interviews (12 months in the current study) is
standardized for all respondents. This eliminates the possibility
that group variations in time since widowhood are responsible
for group variations in the estimated effects of widowhood on
well-being. This approach, however, produces variation across
individuals in the amount of time elapsed between (a) the
baseline measurement and the death of the spouse and,
therefore, between (b) the baseline measurement and the
follow-up interview. In the current study, models assessing
change in health associated with the transition to widowhood
estimate this association across a range of time periods. All
WIDOWHOOD AND HEALTH REGULATION S345
analyses control for the number of months between baseline
and follow-up.
Means. --Weighted means and standard deviations of all
variables in the analysis are presented separately for widowed
subjects and the continually married in Table 1. Although
widowed and married individuals are closely matched on most
sociodemographic characteristics, two noteworthy differences
exist. First, those who experience the transition to widowhood
between T0 and T2 report lower levels of health regulation both
before (À.233) and after (À.277) widowhood compared with
their continually married counterparts (.078 at T0 and .168 at
T2). This suggests that declines in health that accompany the
transition to widowhood may begin before the spouse's death,
especially when the death is preceded by a period of illness.
Additional analyses (not shown) indicate that the lower levels
of health regulation preceding widowhood may be due in part
to the provision of care to a sick or dying spouse at baseline--
a situation that is more common among widowed (.251) than
married (.063) persons. The illness of a spouse not only reduces
the health regulation within marriage but may also isolate the
caregiver from other sources of health reminders (e.g., friends,
relatives). All longitudinal analyses in the current study include
a control for baseline differences in health regulation as well as
a dummy variable indicating whether the spouse required care
at baseline. Although this approach should produce more
conservative estimates of the effect of widowhood on health
(especially among those for whom health regulation begins to
decline prior to widowhood), it helps to isolate the effects of the
death of the spouse from (a) widowhood-related processes that
begin prior to the spouse's death and (b) any tendency of those
who infrequently engage in health regulation to be selected into
widowhood.
Second, although the average change in health regulation for
the widowed is negative, the average change in health
regulation for the continually married is positive. Thus, whereas
widowed individuals experience a general decline in the
frequency of health regulation over time, their continually
married counterparts experience an increase. This latter finding
suggests that, among the married, spouses and others may step
up their health regulation efforts as individuals age and
encounter age-related health problems of their own and health
problems and deaths of their contemporaries.
Analytic strategy. --All models control for the lagged
(baseline) value of the dependent variable. The sign of
coefficients in lagged dependent variable models reflects the
direction of change in the dependent variable across the period
of time under consideration (Kessler & Greenberg, 1981).
Thus, in the current models, a positive coefficient for the
transition to widowhood indicates that the transition is
associated with an increase in the dependent variable over
time (or an increase in the probability of scoring a 1 on
a dichotomous dependent variable), and a negative coefficient
reflects a decrease in the dependent variable (or a decrease in
the probability of scoring a 1 on a dichotomous dependent
variable) relative to the change that is experienced by the
continually married control group. Because this approach
estimates the effect of the transition to widowhood on a change
in the outcome of interest, it reduces the probability that
observed associations reflect selection of the least healthy
individuals (or those who receive little health regulation) into
the widowed status, perhaps due to an unhealthy environment
shared by both spouses.
RESULTS
Transition to Widowhood and Social Regulation of
Health
I first estimate the effect of the transition to widowhood on
the frequency of health regulation at 18 months post widow-
hood, while controlling for prewidowhood health regulation.
The results are shown in Table 2 and support my primary
hypothesis that, on average, the transition to widowhood

undermines the social regulation of health. Those who
experience the transition to widowhood report substantially
lower levels of health regulation post widowhood than their
continually married counterparts, controlling for prewidowhood
differences in health regulation. In sum, the transition to
widowhood appears to be associated with a substantial and
significant decline in the frequency of health regulation
compared with remaining continually married.
It is important to note that the means shown in Table 1
indicate that, on average, widowed persons experience a small
decline in health regulation over time and married persons
report a small increase. Therefore, an accurate interpretation of
the multivariate results shown in Table 2 recognizes that
widowhood is associated with a decline in the frequency of
health regulation relative to the change experienced by the
continually married. Thus, the estimated negative effect of the
transition to widowhood on the frequency of health regulation
shown in Table 2 exists because (a) widowed persons
experience an average decline in the frequency of health
regulation over time and (b) widowed persons do not receive
the benefits of increased health regulation over time that the
continually married experience. In sum, although widowhood
appears to somewhat undermine health regulation for the
average person, it also comes at a time (in this sample) when
health regulation is likely more important than ever, as
evidenced by the increase in health regulation that occurs
among the continually married.
Transition to Widowhood, Risky Health Behavior, and
Health Outcomes
Models assessing the impact of the transition to widowhood
on change in (a) the probability of exhibiting risky health
behavior, (b) the probability of reporting fair or poor self-
assessed health, and (c) the probability of having a serious
illness are shown in Table 3. For each dependent variable,
Model 1 is the base model before interaction terms are entered.
The internal moderator of absolute health regulation change
among the widowed is added in Model 2. Note that the internal
moderator does not assess health regulation change relative to
the continually married. Rather, it captures absolute declines in
health regulation over time among the widowed. Preliminary
models also assessed age differences in the effects of the
transition to widowhood (age 3 widowhood) on each outcome
and age differences in the moderating effect of health regulation
change (age 3 health regulation change among the widowed).
Age interactions terms were significant only in models
predicting serious illness and are included in Model 2 for this
dependent variable.
The significant coefficients for health regulation change
among the widowed (health regulation change T0­T2 3
widowhood) in all models support the primary hypotheses of
this study. The extent to which widowhood increases unhealthy
behaviors, undermines health, and increases morbidity risk
relative to remaining continually married depends on whether it
is accompanied by an absolute decline in the social regulation
of health. Specifically, the transition to widowhood is
associated with an increase in risky health behavior only when
it is accompanied by a decline in the frequency of health
regulation. For example, among those for whom widowhood is
accompanied by a 1-SD decline in health regulation, the
transition to widowhood is associated with a .535 increase in
the log odds of engaging in risky health behavior (À.345 þ
[À.828 3 À1] ¼ .535). In contrast, when widowhood is
accompanied by a 1-SD increase in health regulation, it is
associated with a 1.225 decrease in the log odds of engaging in
risky health behavior (À.345þ[À.82831]¼À1.225) compared
with the change experienced by the continually married.
Similarly, becoming widowed is associated with an increase
in the probability of reporting fair or poor health, but only when
it is accompanied by a decline in health regulation. For
example, when widowhood is accompanied by a 1-SD decline
in health regulation, it is associated with a .011 increase in the
log odds of reporting fair or poor health (À.409 þ [À.420 3
À1] ¼ .011). In fact, when widowhood is accompanied by
a substantial 2-SD increase in health regulation, it results in an
improvement in health--a 1.249 decrease in the log odds of
reporting fair or poor health (À.409 þ [À.420 3 2] ¼À1.249).
The significant three-way interaction of widowhood and
health regulation change with age indicates that the role
of health regulation change in moderating the impact of

WIDOWHOOD AND HEALTH REGULATION S347
widowhood on morbidity depends on age. This association is
shown in Figure 1, which was constructed by calculating the
estimated probability of reporting a serious illness at Time 2
for those experiencing the transition to widowhood at various
levels of health regulation change and for the control group
of continually married adults. The predicted probability of a
serious illness for the widowed individuals at each level of
health regulation change is then subtracted from the predicted
value for the control group. The y-axis therefore shows the
estimated effect of the transition to widowhood on a change in
the probability of a serious illness at each level of health
regulation change, within the range of the data.
For 50- and 60-year-olds, the general pattern of association is
similar to that observed for self-assessed health and risky health
behaviors: increases in morbidity for the widowed persons who
experience declines in health regulation and decreases in
morbidity for the widowed persons who experience increases in
health regulation. However, for 70-year-olds, although the
transition to widowhood is associated with a decline in
morbidity risk when it is accompanied by increased health
regulation, it does not significantly increase morbidity risk even
when health regulation declines. Similarly, for 80-year-olds,
widowhood appears to be associated with a small decline in
morbidity risk even when it is accompanied by a decline in
health regulation. The decline in morbidity risk associated with
widowhood among the oldest adults likely reflects relief from
the strains associated with living with a sick or dying spouse.
Research indicates that older adults more often find themselves
in the caregiver role and may be especially vulnerable to the
strains associated with providing care to a spouse (Marks,
1996). Thus, the health of older adults may improve when
widowhood brings relief from care-provider strains.
DISCUSSION
Contrary to the common belief that individuals often become
ill or die soon after the death of a spouse, the current study
indicates that declines in health with widowhood are not
inevitable. Instead, they are largely dependent on a process that
is highly amenable to intervention: the social regulation of
health. Two central findings support this conclusion. First,
widowed individuals report substantial declines in the fre-
quency of health reminders compared with the continually mar-
ried. This reflects absolute declines in health reminders that
accompany the transition to widowhood as well as the fact that
the widowed do not receive the advantage of increased health
regulation over time that their married counterparts report.
Second, widowhood increases unhealthy practices, increases
the probability of experiencing a serious illness, and increases
the probability of reporting fair or poor health but only for those
widowed individuals who experience an absolute decline in
health reminders and assistance received from others. Although
widowhood poses health risks, the current findings suggest that
declines in health that tend to accompany widowhood are not
inevitable. In fact, when widowhood results in increased health
regulation, it may have positive consequences for some health
outcomes.
A limitation of the current analysis is the inability to assess
gender differences in the links between widowhood, health
regulation, health behavior, and health outcomes. Cross-
sectional research indicates that because women more fre-
quently regulate the health of their spouse than do men, the
positive influence of marriage on healthy behaviors is greater
for men than for women (Umberson, 1987). Because widow-
hood is much more common among women than among men,
the small number of men in the sample did not allow for
separate analyses by gender. It is likely that the effects of
widowhood on declines in health regulation are stronger among
men than women.
The current findings have important implications for medical
practitioners, counselors, family members, and others interested
in promoting adjustment to spousal bereavement. Greater
attention to the health practices of older adults following
widowhood may go a long way toward offsetting the negative

consequences of widowhood. It is important to note, however,
that not all attempts at health regulation are likely to be
beneficial. Some evidence indicates that negative social control
tactics (e.g., pressure, inducing guilt) have little effect on
behavior change and may undermine psychological well-being
and physical health (Lewis & Rock, 1999). Thus, the
associations observed here would likely be more robust if
health reminders that are delivered and received in a positive
manner were distinguished from those perceived as negative.
Moreover, being responsible for regulating another's health
may generate stress that can undermine the health of the person
providing health regulation and assistance.
The results of the current study suggest that health regulation
is a primary mechanism through which marriage (and, perhaps,
other personal relationships) influences health. However, much
remains to be discovered about the dynamics of health
regulation in marriage. A list of desiderata for future data
collection efforts includes (a) longitudinal assessments of
various dimensions of health regulation activities (including
general health reminders and more targeted efforts to encourage
specific behavior such as weight management, nutritious eating,
smoking cessation, and exercise), (b) dyadic data from both
participants in the health regulation process, (c) measures of
how health reminders are perceived by the receiver and the
provider (positive, negative, helpful, stressful), and (d)
a sufficient sample size to allow for the examination of gender,
race, socioeconomic, and life course variations in the predictors
and consequences of health regulation.
Better data would allow researchers to investigate the
processes through which dyads exchange health reminders
and determine which conditions enhance the efficacy of health
regulation efforts. Future research should also identify the
social and contextual factors that characterize those individuals
who are most likely to experience declines in health regulation
with widowhood. Such information would be of great value in
designing targeted interventions for those at greatest risk of
health decline following widowhood. The results of the current
study optimistically suggest that these declines are not
inevitable.
