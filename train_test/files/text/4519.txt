Abstract
Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and bradykinin (BK) are endogenous peptides that signal through Gaq/11-protein coupled receptors
(GPCRs) to produce nociceptor sensitization and pain. Both peptides activate phospholipase C to stimulate Ca2þ accumu-
lation, diacylglycerol production, and protein kinase C activation and are rapidly desensitized via a G-protein receptor kinase
2-dependent mechanism. However, ET-1 produces a greater response and longer lasting nocifensive behavior than BK in
multiple models, indicating a potentially divergent signaling mechanism in primary afferent sensory neurons. Using cultured
sensory neurons, we demonstrate significant differences in both Ca2þ influx and Ca2þ release from intracellular stores
following ET-1 and BK treatments. As intracellular store depletion may contribute to the regulation of other signaling
cascades downstream of GPCRs, we concentrated our investigation on store-operated Ca2þ channels. Using pharmaco-
logical approaches, we identified transient receptor potential canonical channel 3 (TRPC3) as a dominant contributor to
Ca2þ influx subsequent to ET-1 treatment. On the other hand, BK treatment stimulated Orai1 activation, with only minor
input from TRPC3. Taken together, data presented here suggest that ET-1 signaling targets TRPC3, generating a prolonged
Ca2þ signal that perpetuates nocifensive responses. In contrast, Orai1 dominates as the downstream target of BK receptor
activation and results in transient intracellular Ca2þ increases and abridged nocifensive responses.

Introduction
Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and bradykinin (BK) are two
endogenous neuropeptides involved in inflammatory
and cancer pain (Mantyh et al., 2002; Viet and
Schmidt, 2012). ET-1 was first isolated and described as
a powerful vasoconstrictor in 1988 (Masaki, 2004) and is
synthesized by multiple cell types. ET-1 signals through
two Gaq-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), endothe-
lin-A (ETA
R), and endothelin-B (ETB
R), which are
expressed in a tissue-dependent manner (Stephenson
et al., 1994; Takigawa et al., 1995; Webb, 1997;
Khodorova et al., 2009). The affinities of the three iso-
forms of endothelin (ET-1, -2, and -3) also differ for
ETA
R and ETB
R. ETB
R binds all three endothelin iso-
forms with equal affinity, whereas ET-1 has high affinity
for ETA
R over ETB
R (Khodorova et al., 2002), while
ET-3 has 100-fold lower affinity for ETA
R than ETB
R
(Horinouchi et al., 2013). Both endothelin receptors are
desensitized through GPCR kinase type-2 (GRK-2)
dependent mechanisms (Freedman et al., 1997), employing

a pathway utilized in the desensitization of many GPCRs,
including those that desensitize BK-mediated responses.
The nonapeptide BK belongs to the kinin family and is
synthesized from inactive kininogen precursors following
tissue injury (Dray and Perkins, 1993). Similar to ET-1,
BK signals through two Gaq coupled receptors, BK type-
1 and type-2 receptors (B1
R and B2
R, respectively;
Gutowski et al., 1991; Marceau et al., 1998). BK signals
predominantly through B2
R, which is also the dominant
isoform widely expressed in multiple tissue types under
normal physiological conditions (Calixto et al., 2004). On
the other hand, B1
Rs are usually not expressed under
physiological conditions but upregulated in response to
inflammation and tissue injury (Calixto et al., 2004;
Campos et al., 2006; Luiz et al., 2010). Furthermore,
BK has significantly higher affinity for B2
R over B1
R
(Calixto et al., 2000, 2004; Campos et al., 2006). Similar
to ET receptors, B2
R activation leads to receptor desen-
sitization via GRK-2-dependent endocytosis (Blaukat
et al., 1996; Haasemann et al., 1998). Therefore, we
focused our studies with BK on the B2
R system.
Both ET and BK receptors signal through Gaq/11
protein-coupled receptors that stimulate inositol 1,4,5-tri-
sphosphate (IP3
) and diacylglycerol (DAG) production
via activation of phospholipase C (PLC; Takigawa
et al., 1995; Nelson et al., 2003; Khodorova et al., 2009;
Petho and Reeh, 2012). Although additional Ga-subunit
signaling mechanisms have been linked to both BK (Gai;
Ewald et al., 1989 and Gas; Liebmann et al., 1996) and
ET (Gai; Shraga-Levine and Sokolovsky, 2000 and Gas;
Jaureguiberry et al., 2004) receptors, Gaq/11 is identified
as the dominating target of BK and ET receptor activa-
tion in peripheral neurons (Davenport, 2002; Leeb-
Lundberg et al., 2005). For this reason, we focused our
studies on calcium responses following activation of the
classical PLC pathway downstream from Gaq/11, even
though alternative pathways including protein kinase A,
protein kinase C, and several mitogen-activated protein
kinases are also activated by Gaq/11-coupled processes.
IP3
binds to receptors expressed on endoplasmic reticu-
lum (ER) to induce calcium release from intracellular
stores. The subsequent decrease of Ca2þ concentration
in intracellular stores activates store-operated calcium
entry (SOCE) channels, further increasing intracellular
calcium accumulation (Putney, 1986). Focused investiga-
tions have since revealed molecular elements, stromal
interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and Orai1 as important
modulators of SOCE function, as STIM1 serves as an
ER-localized Ca2þ sensor (Liou et al., 2005), and Orai1
act as pore-forming subunits (Prakriya et al., 2006). The
second coiled-coil domain in the cytosolic C-terminus of
STIM1 interacts with and activates Orai1 following prior
activation of its Ca2þ-sensing EF hand domain (Prakriya
et al., 2006; Muik et al., 2012). As Ca2þconcentration in
the ER lumen falls below $300 mM, STIM1 oligomerizes,
translocates, and interacts with Orai1 to activate SOCE
channels (Cahalan, 2009). STIM1 also regulates the activ-
ity of other calcium channels, including the transient
receptor potential canonical channel (TRPC) ion channel
family, defining their function as SOC channels (Yuan
et al., 2007). Interestingly, both BK and ET regulate
TRPC channel activities; ET-1 regulates TRPC3, 5, 6, 7
(Horinouchi et al., 2011), whereas BK regulates TRPC1,
3, 4, and 6 (Liou et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2011; Suzuki
et al., 2011). Taking under consideration the expression
pattern of TRPC ion channels in both trigeminal ganglia
(TG) and DRG sensory neurons (Alkhani et al., 2014),
their function as SOCE channels and their existence as
downstream targets from Gaq/11-signaling (importantly
TRPC3; Peppiatt-Wildman et al., 2007), we investigated
functional coupling between TRPC3, Orai1 channels and
ET-1, and BK receptors in rat TG sensory neurons.
However, spontaneous nociceptive behavioral measures
were conducted on hindpaw tissues innervated by DRG
afferent neurons to reduce output ambiguity that occurs
in tissues innervated by TG afferent neurons
(Krzyzanowska and Avendano, 2012). TG neurons
were used as they provide more neurons/ganglia than
those isolated from dorsal root ganglia tissue, allowing
us to reduce the number of animals used for this study.
Importantly, sensory neurons from both the trigeminal
and dorsal root ganglia yield similar expression patterns
for ET and BK receptors (Pomonis et al., 2001; Sugiura
et al., 2002; Chichorro et al., 2009; Luiz et al., 2010;
Yamamoto et al., 2013). Here, we identify divergence in
calcium signals generated downstream from ETA
R and
B2
R activation with respect to SOCE channels.
Material and Methods
Reagents
The following reagents were used: ET-1 (Sigma Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO), BK (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO),
PyR3 (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, United Kingdom),
GdCl3
(Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, United Kingdom),
and U73122 (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, United
Kingdom).
Animals
All procedures utilizing animals were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
University of Texas Health Science Center at
San Antonio and were conducted in accordance with
policies for the ethical treatment of animals established
by the National Institute for Health. Male Sprague
Dawley rats, 175 to 200 g in weight (Charles River
Laboratories, Wilmington, MA), were used for behavior
analyses and TG dissection.

Cell Culture
TG neurons were cultured as previously described (Jeske
et al., 2006). In short, TG were bilaterally removed from
male Sprague Dawley rats, placed in ice-cold Hanks'
balanced salt solution (HBBS) medium and washed
twice with HBBS. TGs were dissociated by simultaneous
collagenase and dispase treatment and gentle trituration
after 25 and 45 min of incubation (37 C, room air). Cells
were washed twice to remove the digestive enzymes and
placed on poly-D-lysine/laminin-coated cover slips
(Corning, Bedford, MA) in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle
Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% glutamine, 100 ng/ml
nerve growth factor. Cultures were maintained at 37
C, 5% CO2
, and grown for 1 to 2 days for calcium
imaging experiments.
Nucleofection
For single-cell PLC activity experiments, TG neurons
were nucleofected with 2 mg of GFP-PLCq-PH (a kind
gift from Nikita Gamper University of Leeds, UK;
Gamper et al., 2004) according to manufacturer recom-
mendations (Lonza, Allendale, NJ) prior to cover slip
placement. Experiments were performed 2 days after
procedure.
Measurements of Inositol Phosphate Accumulation
ET-1- and BK-stimulated inositol monophosphate (IP)
accumulation in primary sensory neuronal cultures was
measured as previously described (Rowan et al., 2014).
Neuronal cultures grown in 96-well plates were labeled
with 2 mCi/ml [3H]myoinositol for 24 hr before experi-
ments. After labeling cells were washed three times with
500 ml HBSS that contained 20 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-
piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) and were prein-
cubated in HBSS containing 20 mM HEPES and 20 mM
LiCl for 15 min at 37 C in room air. Cells were incubated
with various concentrations of ET-1 and BK (25 min,
37 C) and reactions were terminated by the addition of
ice-cold formic acid. Total [3H]IPs were separated by ion
exchange chromatography and measured by liquid scin-
tillation spectrometry. Data are expressed as a percentage
increase above basal IP accumulation.
Calcium Imaging
To measure single-cell intracellular Ca2þ levels, the dye
Fura-2 AM (2 mM; Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) was
incubated with cultured neurons for 30 min at 37 C in
the presence of 0.05% Pluronic (Calbiochem/EMD
Biosciences, Gibbstown, NJ). Fluorescence was detected
with a Nikon Eclipse Ti-U microscope fitted with a 20Â/
0.8 NA Fluor objective. Fluorescence images from
340 nm to 380 nm excitation wavelengths were collected
and analyzed with MetaFluor Software (MetaMorph,
Web Universal Imaging Corporation, Downingtown,
PA). All Ca2þ measurements were performed at RT. To
asses single-cell Ca2þresponses after ET-1 or BK stimu-
lation, cells were continuously perfused with standard
extracellular solution (SES) that contained (in mM) 140
NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 MgCl2
, 2 CaCl2,
10 HEPES, and 10 D(þ)-
glucose. After 60 s baseline was established 100 nM of
ET-1 or BK was applied and net changes in Ca2þ were
calculated. In recordings where cells underwent double
treatment with ET-1 and BK, neurons were washed for
5 min with SES. To assess SOCE stimulated by ET-1 or
BK, cultured neurons were perfused with Ca2þ free buffer
(140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2
, 0.5 EGTA,
10 mM D-(þ)-glucose, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) and
after baseline was established, ET-1 (100 nM) or BK
(100 nM) was administered for 30 s. Following 5 min
washout, 2 mM Ca2þ was introduced to the extracellular
environment. Ratiometric data were converted to [Ca2þ]i
by using the equation [Ca2þ]i
¼ K[(R À Rmin
)/(Rmax
À
R)]. Values of K, Rmin
, and Rmax
are determined with use
of calibration kit (Invitrogen, Oregon). Data collected
with calibration kit allow generation of a standard
curve, which can then be used to convert fura-2 fluores-
cence measurements obtained from experimental samples
into estimates of free Ca2þ concentration. The plot of the
log of [Ca2þ]
free
(x-axis) versus the log of {[(R À Rmin
)/
(Rmax
À R)]} yields a straight line, the x-intercept of
which is the log of K. R is the ratio of 510 nm emission
intensity with excitation at 340 nm, to 510 nm emission
intensity with excitation at 380 nm; Rmin
is the ratio at
zero free Ca2þ; Rmax
is the ratio at saturating Ca2þ.
Animal Behavior
All injections were given intraplantarly in 25 ml volumes
via 28-gauge needle inserted through the lateral footpad
just under the skin to minimalize tissue damage. Drugs
stocks were dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
or PBS 2% Tween20. After injection (Time 0), animals
were freely moving, on a flat surface enclosed by Plexiglas
cage. Nocifensive behavior was defined as hindpaw
flinching, lifting, and licking. Animals were observed for
40 min and behavior was quantified every 5 min.
Data Analysis
For detail statistical analysis, GraphPad Prism 4.0 soft-
ware was used (Graphpad Software, Inc., San Diego,
CA). Data were given as mean Æ standard error of the
mean (Haasemann et al., 1998), with the value of n refer-
ring to the number of analyzed cells per group.

variance (Pechanova and Simko, 2007), with Bonferroni
post hoc correction as required. Two conditions were
compared using paired or unpaired t-test. A difference

Results
ET-1 and BK Cause Nocifensive Behavior in Rats
Inflammatory mediators induce nocifensive behaviors in
multiple behavioral models (Gokin et al., 2001;
Khodorova et al., 2002). Here, we aimed to directly com-
pare the time frames of nocifensive behavior (flinching,
licking, and lifting of injected paw) following intraplantar
injection of rats with ET-1 (10 nM in 25 ml), BK (10 nM in
25 ml), or vehicle (PBS, 25 ml). As illustrated in Figure 1,
statistical comparisons of blinded observations following
intraplantar injection of ET-1 or BK into the hindpaw
revealed significant differences at differential time points.
Following BK administration, rat nocifensive behavior
peaked 5 min after injection, while ET-1 injection pro-
duced similar nocifensive behavior, but not until 30-min
postinjection. As both of these inflammatory mediators
signal through similar Gaq-coupled mechanisms, our
study progressed along the signaling pathway to investi-
gate sensory neuronal Ca2þ accumulation.
Single-Cell Ca2þResponses Triggered by ET-1 and
BK in TG Neurons
We next decided to characterize single-cell Ca2þ
responses triggered by ET-1 and BK by real-time Ca2þ
imaging, starting with physiological extracellular solution
containing 2 mM Ca2þ (Figure 2(a) and (d)) Under those
conditions, ET-1 treatment effected in significantly higher
increase in intracellular Ca2þ concentration when com-
pared with BK (Figure 2(d)). In following set of meas-
urements, we used protocol that was designed to isolate
Ca2þ entry due to SOC channels activity. After baseline
in Ca2þ free solution was established, cells were treated
for 30 s with ET-1 (100 nM) or BK (100 nM) and changes
in intracellular calcium concentration were analyzed. ET-
1 triggered significantly higher calcium release from intra-
cellular stores when compared with BK-induced
responses (Figure 2(c) and (e)). After cells had time to
recover from ET-1 or BK stimulation, we exchanged
extracellular solution from Ca2þ free solution to one con-
taining 2 mM Ca2þ, observed intracellular Ca2þ increase
was due to activity of SOC channels. Data summarized in
Figure 2(f) showed that ET-1-induced Ca2þ depletion
caused significantly higher SOC channels activation
than that caused by BK. We were also interested in the
frequency of coexpression of ETA
R and B2
R in TG neu-
rons. To that end, after we established the baseline, we
treated cells with ET-1 and after 5 min of recovery, the
same cells were treated with BK and the frequency of
events is illustrated in Figure 2(b); 20.8% of cells that
responded to ET-1 also responded to BK stimulation.
On the other hand, 74.1% of cells that showed sensitivity
to BK treatment also showed response to ET-1.
ET-1 and BK Activation of PLC in Population and
Single-Cell Measurements
To examine possible mechanisms that would explain the
variability in calcium accumulation following ET-1 and
BK treatment of sensory neurons, we focused on PLC
activation, as it is the first molecular reaction that takes
place after activation of ETA
R and B2
R. IP is one metab-
olite that accumulates in the presence of LiCl after
hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
(PIP2
) and is broadly used as an index of PLC enzymatic
activity (Rowan et al., 2014). When IP accumulation was
measured in sensory neuron cultures after treatment with
ET-1 or BK, significant differences between maximal
responses of the agonists were observed (Figure 3(a)).
However, given that sensory neuron cultures are hetero-
geneous and significant differences observed could be due

to high expression of ETA
R in non-neuronal cells, we
analyzed PLC activity on a single-cell level (Gamper
et al., 2004). To this end, we nucleofected cultured sen-
sory neurons with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged
PLCq pleckstrin homology domain cDNA, which trans-
locates to the cytosol from the plasma membrane follow-
ing activation of PLC and subsequent PIP2
hydrolysis.
When PLC activation was compared in cells stimulated
with ET-1 or BK, no significant differences were observed
(Figure 3(b) to (c)), suggesting that on a single-cell level,
ET-1 and BK activate PLC similarly. To further investi-
gate a potential role for PLC in sensory neuronal
SOCE, we measured real-time calcium accumulation in
the presence of U73122 (10 mM, PLC inhibitor,
Figure 3(d)). Under this condition, neither ET-1 nor
BK was able to generate notable SOCE, indicating that
activation of PLC is necessary for ET-1- and BK-
mediated SOCE in cultured sensory neurons.
Ion Channels That Contribute to SOCE in TG
Neurons
Previous studies indicate similar expression patterns of
ETA
R and B2
R in primary nociceptors (Gemes et al.,
2011; Alkhani et al., 2014) and that both ET-1 and BK
activate SOCE, due to PLC-dependent IP3
production
following receptor activation (Figure 2, Putney, 2011;

recognize roles for Orai1 and TRPC3 as SOCE channels
in sensory neurons (Gemes et al., 2011; Alkhani et al.,
2014). Therefore, we next investigated Orai1 and TRPC3
as possible candidates that contribute to ET-1- or BK-
induced SOCE activation in TG neurons.
Pharmacological SOCE antagonists were used to deter-
mine single-cell calcium response sensitivities to ET-1 and
BK treatment (Figure 4). SOCE triggered by ET-1 was
decreased by 74% when PyR3 (TRPC3 blocker) was pre-
sent (Figure 4(a) and (b)), whereas, Gd3þ (Orai1 blocker)
caused a 33% decrease in calcium response (Figure 4(a)
and (b)). In contrast, when BK was the agent that acti-
vated SOCE in TG neurons, PyR3 treatment resulted in
52% reduction in SOCE response (Figure 4(a) and (b));
moreover, Gd3þ inhibited calcium response by 41%
(Figure 4(a) and (b)). When we translate these data to
represent specific ion channel contribution to ET or BK
response, TRPC3 contributes 73% to ET-1- and 47% to
BK-activated SOCE activities and, Orai1 contributes to
33% of ET-1- and 53% of BK-triggered SOCE in sensory
neurons (Figure 4(c) and (d)).

contribute to ET-1- and BK-mediated responses, nocifen-
sive behavior experiments were repeated with specific ion
channel inhibitors, PyR3 was used as a TRPC3-specific
inhibitor (Alkhani et al., 2014) and Gd3þ was injected to
block Orai1 activity (Gemes et al., 2011). Intraplantar
injection of 100 nM (25 ml) inhibitor (PyR3 or Gd3þ)
into the hindpaw was followed by 10 nM (25 ml) injection
of ET-1 or BK 5 min later. Inhibition of Orai1 with Gd3þ
resulted in a significant increase in ET-1-triggered noci-
fensive behavior through the first 25 min of observation
(Figure 5). PyR3 inhibition of TRPC3 prior to ET-1
administration resulted in a leftward shift in the time
course of response, inducing an earlier onset of nocicep-
tive responses; however, the magnitude of response was
unchanged. As for BK-induced nocifensive behavior,
Orai1 inhibition did not change the maximal response;
however, the recovery time was prolonged when com-
pared with BK alone. Furthermore, TRPC3 inhibition
by PyR3 significantly decreased peak BK nocifensive
behavior at the 5-min time point, suggesting that activa-
tion of TRPC3 contributes to BK-mediated nocifensive
responses.
Discussion
Sensory neurons, especially slow conducting C-type
fibers, can remain in quiescent states for long periods of
time (Schmidt et al., 1995). During that time, inactivity of
voltage gated Ca2þ channels and continuous membrane
Ca2þATPase activity could deplete intracellular Ca2þ
stores. However compensatory SOCE mechanisms pre-
vent store depletion and support cellular viability
(Wanaverbecq et al., 2003; Gemes et al., 2011). Very
few published studies have addressed the role(s) of
SOCE in sensory neurons. These earlier works identify
that extracellular Ca2þ is required to maintain calcium
homeostasis in resting neurons, as they show decreased
Ca2þ levels within minutes after placement in Ca2þ-free

Additionally, when quiescent neurons recover in the pres-
ence of 2 mM extracellular Ca2þ, stores are restored
within 10 min (which does not occur in a Ca2þ-free envir-
onment), demonstrating neuronal dependence on SOCE
for replenishing Ca2þ stores after a release event (Gemes
et al., 2011). Furthermore, negative manipulations of
SOCE can deplete intracellular stores, contributing to
pathological conditions following neuropathy (Rigaud
et al., 2009). However, inflammatory GPCR activation
can also cause store depletion following acute injury,
although mediators that activate the same receptor sig-
naling mechanisms often yield differential cellular results.
In the present study, we investigated the differential
sensory neuron activation profiles for the inflammatory
mediators ET-1 and BK. Both mediators signal through
Gaq/11 protein-coupled pathways, activate PLC, stimu-
late increased intracellular Ca2þ accumulation, and
undergo rapid GRK2-dependent desensitization
(Khodorova et al., 2009; Petho and Reeh, 2012;
Blaukat et al., 1996; Freedman et al., 1997; Haasemann
et al., 1998). However, we report differential nociceptive
behavior patterns and calcium accumulation indices fol-
lowing either ET-1 or BK administration. To address
this, we examined SOCE channels farther downstream
from receptor activation and discovered a unique path-
way association between ET-1 and TRPC3 separate from
a more balanced pathway linking B2
R activation to both
TRPC3 and Orai1. This differential pathway association
is especially unique, given the similarities between the
receptors activated and their immediate downstream
targets.
In many cell types, BK stimulates transient increases in
intracellular Ca2þ, only to return to baseline within min-
utes following treatment (Pinheiro et al., 2013). In con-
trast, ET-1 stimulates transient increases in free
Ca2þconcentration in aortic smooth muscle, and elevated
Ca2þ levels can be maintained for up to 60 min (Miwa
et al., 1999). Results presented here demonstrate clear
parallels between nocifensive behavior time course and
calcium accumulation. BK induced a short-lived
Ca2þsignal that translates into quickly resolved

intervals. First injection consisted of 25 ml of PyR3 (100 nM), Gd3þ (100 nM), or PBS as vehicle. Second contained 25 ml ET-1 (10 nM) and BK
(10 nM). Nocifensive behavior was recorded throughout the time course of experiment (40 min) and quantified every 5 min. (a) Summary of

nocifensive behavior (Figure 1). In contrast, ET-1 fos-
tered a prolonged Ca2þelevation that contributes to
extended nocifensive behavior (Figure 1). These observa-
tions, combined with previous knowledge about signal
transduction pathway downstream of ETA
R and B2
R,
suggest that second messenger pathway(s) bifurcate to
contribute to divergent responses. At the beginning of
our investigation, we established that in single-cell meas-
urements, both ET-1 and BK stimulation activate PLC to
the same degree (Figure 3(b) and (c)) and mobilize Ca2þ
from intracellular stores (Figure 2(c) and (e)). However, a
consequence of store depletion is the activation of various
SOCE channels. Therefore, we investigated SOCE chan-
nels activated by ET-1 and BK to clarify observed
discrepancies.
Orai1 and TRPC3 are among many SOCE channels
that assist in intracellular Ca2þ homeostasis, and both are
expressed and have been characterized in sensory neurons
(Gemes et al., 2011; Alkhani et al., 2014). Commercially
available pharmacological antagonists of these channels
were used to determine the roles of each in mediating the
differential effects of ET-1 and BK. Results presented
here demonstrate that ET-1 predominantly activates
TRPC3, which contributes to 73% of ET-1-induced
SOCE (Figure 4(d)). In contrast, BK-triggered SOCE is
significantly more balanced between Orai1 and TRPC3,
with slight preference toward Orai1 involvement (58%,
Figure 4(c)). This variability in ion channel activation
resulted in significant differences in the length and size
of the Ca2þ signal. Importantly, this divergence in
SOCE activation profiles could contribute to the differ-
ential nocifensive behaviors caused by ET-1 and BK. To
further examine the roles of Orai1 and TRPC3 in ET-1 -
and BK-induced behavior, we employed the same
pharmacological inhibitors in our nocifensive behavior
model.
SOCE antagonist results establish parallels between
the functional coupling of Orai1 and TRPC3 channels
in single-cell responses and nocifensive behavior. Orai1
suppression of neuronal excitability would explain signifi-
cantly prolonged recovery time after BK injection in rats
that were pretreated with the Orai1 blocker, Gd3þ
(Figure 5(b)). Furthermore, PyR3 inhibition of TRPC3
significantly reduced BK-induced peak nocifensive
behavior. This finding agrees with the robust BK-induced
inflammatory response observed by ourselves (Figure 1)
and others (Petho and Reeh, 2012). However, neither of
the SOCE antagonists reduced peak ET-1 nocifensive
behavior, and in both instances, affected the time-to-
peak response ratio. Both PyR3 inhibition of TRPC3
and Gd3þ inhibition of Orai1 reduced the time
required for ET-1 administration to reach peak nocifen-
sive behavior. These results may simply be due to the
quick behavioral response of BK versus the slower
response time for ET-1or may involve additional under-
lying factors.
It has been reported that TRPC3 plays vital role in
DRG neurons sensitization triggered by exposure to
inflammatory mediators (Alkhani et al., 2014). This
may explain why the ET-1 signal, which is very strongly
biased toward TRPC3 activation, resulted in prolonged
nocifensive responses. Also, TRPC3 inhibition would
alter this behavior through decreased sensitization, result-
ing in reduced nocifensive action. Further modification of
rat behavior was observed when Orai1 was inhibited
prior to ET-1 injection. Interestingly, Orai1 activity has
been shown to suppress neuronal excitability, while inhib-
ition increases neuronal burst firing (Gemes et al., 2011).
Here, this mechanism would explain the increased noci-
fensive responses in animals pretreated with the
Orai1 inhibitor Gd3þ prior to ET-1 administration
(Figure 5(a)). Indeed, as ETA
R downstream signaling tar-
gets Orai1 to a smaller degree than TRPC3, the shift in
nocifensive behavior response time shift could be
affected. Importantly, TRPC3 inhibition produced
greater changes in nocifensive behavior, similar to
single-cell studies. Despite the lack of mirrored results
between single-cell studies and nociceptive behavior,

important findings appear to indicate divergent signaling
mechanisms that contribute to our initial behavioral
findings.
Taken together (Figure 6), TRPC3 is the primary
target of ET-1 signaling in TG sensory neurons and its
activity contributes to prolonged elevation of intracellu-
lar free Ca2þ levels and the perpetuation of nocifensive
responses. In contrast, BK triggers short-lived transient
increases in intracellular Ca2þ through dominant activa-
tion of Orai1, contributing to a rapid, but abbreviated
onset of nocifensive behavior. Further studies into this
divergent signaling behavior could prove important to
alleviating acute hyperalgesia.
Summary
Endothelin and bradykinin are inflammatory mediators
that bind to receptors on sensory neurons to stimulate
various molecular pathways. In this investigation, we
identified store-operated ion channels Orai1 and
TRPC3 contribute to endothelin/bradykinin effects
in vitro and in vivo.
