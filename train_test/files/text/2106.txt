Social disparities in exposures to bisphenol A and
polyfluoroalkyl chemicals: a cross-sectional study
within NHANES 2003-2006

Abstract
Background: Bisphenol A (BPA) and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFCs) are suspected endocrine disrupting
compounds known to be ubiquitous in people's bodies. Population disparities in exposure to these chemicals have
not been fully characterized.
Methods: We analyzed data from the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Using
multivariable linear regression we examined the association between urinary concentrations of BPA, serum
concentrations of four PFCs, and multiple measures of socioeconomic position (SEP): family income, education,
occupation, and food security. We also examined associations with race/ethnicity.
Results: All four PFCs were positively associated with family income, whereas BPA was inversely associated with
family income. BPA concentrations were higher in people who reported very low food security and received
emergency food assistance than in those who did not. This association was particularly strong in children: 6-11
year-olds whose families received emergency food had BPA levels 54% higher (95% CI, 13 to 112%) than children
of families who did not. For BPA and PFCs we saw smaller and less consistent associations with education and
occupation. Mexican Americans had the lowest concentrations of any racial/ethnic group of both types of
chemicals; for PFCs, Mexican Americans not born in the U.S. had much lower levels than those born in the U.S.
Conclusions: People with lower incomes had higher body burdens of BPA; the reverse was true for PFCs. Family
income with adjustment for family size was the strongest predictor of chemical concentrations among the
different measures of SEP we studied. Income, education, occupation, and food security appear to capture different
aspects of SEP that may be related to exposure to BPA and PFCs and are not necessarily interchangeable as
measures of SEP in environmental epidemiology studies. Differences by race/ethnicity were independent of SEP.

Background
Identifying populations that are highly exposed to envir-
onmental chemicals is important for protecting public
health and preventing health inequalities. Identifying dif-
ferential patterns of exposure in populations can also
provide useful information for hypotheses about possible
sources of exposure that, especially for many emerging
chemicals of concern, are poorly understood.
This study investigates differences by measures of
socioeconomic position (SEP) and race/ethnicity in body
burden of two types of chemicals, bisphenol A (BPA)
and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFCs). Both are sus-
pected endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and may
alter the normal functioning of hormones and other sig-
naling molecules in the body [1]. BPA is a high volume
chemical used industrially to form polycarbonate plastic
(PC) and it is present in epoxy resins, including those
used as the lining in canned foods [2]. It is an estrogen-
like chemical found in some animal studies to disrupt
reproductive development, body weight and metabolic

homeostasis, and neurodevelopment, and to cause mam-
mary and prostate cancer. Several comprehensive
reviews of health outcomes associated with BPA have
been published in the last five years [3-7]. PFCs are a
class of chemicals used widely in consumer products to
impart stain, oil, and water resistance. In particular they
are used in food packaging and carpeting and textile
treatments [8]. Laboratory studies have found tumors in
certain organs and developmental delays in animals
exposed to PFCs [9,10], and recent preliminary research
in humans reported associations with birth weight, cho-
lesterol levels, and fertility [11-13].
Though BPA and PFCs are ubiquitous in peoples'
urine and blood, with U.S. studies detecting them in
greater than 90% of people tested [14,15], the specific
pathways of human exposure are not well understood.
For both chemicals, diet is thought to account for the
majority of exposure for most people. In the case of
BPA, estimates for adults put the dietary contribution
near 100% of total exposure [16,17]; the migration of
the chemical from food cans and PC food containers
into food may account for most of this, though less-
understood exposure routes may also contribute. For
PFCs, studies have estimated the dietary contribution as
61% [18], 72% [19], and 91% [20] of total exposure.
However, the studies used to develop these estimates
are limited in how fully they are able to assess overall
human exposure. Recent studies suggest a contribution
of indoor air and/or dust to PFC body burdens [21,22].
BPA and PFCs behave very differently once taken into
the human body. BPA is rapidly metabolized via glucur-
onidation, with an estimated urinary elimination half-life
in humans of 5.4 hours [23]. A recent study suggests
that more accumulation may be occurring than pre-
viously assumed, though the half-life is thought to be on
the order of days at the most [24]. PFCs, on the other
hand, are poorly metabolized, with half-lives of greater
than two years in human serum [25,26]. They are
thought to bind to proteins in the blood and tissues
rather than to lipids, unlike most other persistent
organic chemicals [27].
Previous studies have found socioeconomic and
racial/ethnic differences in urine and serum levels of
BPA and PFCs in a representative sample of the U.S.
population. Using data from the 2003-2004 cycle of
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES), Calafat et al. found that urinary BPA con-
centrations were highest among the lower income
group (household incomes less than $20,000), and low-
est among Mexican Americans compared to Non-His-
panic Blacks and Non-Hispanic Whites [15]. In
contrast, PFC serum concentrations were lower in peo-
ple with less education (did not graduate from high
school), while Mexican Americans had lower levels
than other racial/ethnic groups [14]. Differences by
SEP and race/ethnicity were not the focus of these stu-
dies, and neither included detailed consideration of
factors that may explain the disparities.
SEP and race/ethnicity, in and of themselves, are not
likely to explain the differential body burdens of these
chemicals; rather, they serve as surrogates for activities,
behaviors, or circumstances that may actually contribute
to differences. SEP has been defined as "structural loca-
tions within society that are powerful determinants of
the likelihood of health-damaging exposures and the
possession of health-enhancing resources" [28]. Figure 1
presents a framework for conceptualizing these relation-
ships: through several pathways, SEP and race/ethnicity
may influence behaviors such as diet and use of consu-
mer products which are sources of exposure to BPA
and PFCs. Race/ethnicity is often associated with SEP,
and may also be an independent determinant of dietary
and other consumer behaviors.
There are numerous ways to characterize SEP; the
most commonly used measures are income, education,
and occupation. While correlated with one another,
each "emphasizes a particular aspect of social stratifica-
tion" that, in this case, may be more or less relevant to
the pathways by which people are exposed to BPA and
PFCs [29].
Our study builds on the previous work by Calafat et
al. that found opposite associations between measures of
SEP and body burdens of BPA and PFCs; one study
reported differences by income and the other by educa-
tion [14,15]. We further investigate these apparent
opposite trends by examining relationships between
both chemicals and a common set of SEP measures:
family income (categorized in four ways), education,
occupation, and food security (measured in two ways).
Occupation and food security have not been studied
before in the general population in relation to both BPA
and PFC levels. We also consider the complex relation-
ship between SEP and race/ethnicity, and expand the
investigation to an additional NHANES cycle, 2005-
2006. This study provides insights into social disparities
in exposure to these two types of chemicals, and sheds
light on hypothesized sources of exposure.
Methods
Study population
We used data from NHANES, an ongoing survey of the
civilian non-institutionalized U.S. population conducted
by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC). NHANES uses a complex multistage probability
sampling design to select participants, and certain
racial/ethnic, income, and age groups are oversampled
to ensure representativeness [30]. Approximately 5000
participants per year are enrolled, and data are released

in two-year cycles. Our study used data from two cycles,
2003-2004 and 2005-2006.
Participants came to a mobile examination center for
a physical examination and to provide blood and urine
samples, and numerous questionnaires were adminis-
tered by trained interviewers [30]. Random one-third
subsamples of participants had their urine and serum
analyzed for environmental chemicals by the National
Center for Environmental Health. BPA was measured in
urine of participants aged six and older, and PFCs in
serum of participants aged 12 and older. The subsam-
ples of participants did not overlap for the chemical
analyses. NHANES obtained informed consent from all
participants.
Biomonitoring measurements
Total BPA concentration was measured in urine, and
includes BPA parent compound and conjugated metabo-
lites [15]. Measurements were made using solid phase
extraction coupled online to high performance liquid
chromatography and tandem mass spectroscopy [15].
PFCs were measured in serum using solid phase extrac-
tion coupled to high performance liquid chromatogra-
phy-turbo ion spray ionization and tandem mass
spectrometry [14]. The same laboratory techniques were
used in both cycles, though limits of detection (LODs)
for certain chemicals varied slightly between years.
Twelve PFCs were measured in serum. We examined
the four PFCs detected in greater than 98% of partici-
pants: perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluor-
ooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA),
and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS). Values
below the LOD were reported by NHANES as the LOD
divided by the square root of two.
Measures of SEP and race/ethnicity
Numerous measures of self-reported SEP were available
for participants, assessed through interviews conducted
in-person by trained interviewers [31]. We used
responses from the following questionnaires: demo-
graphics, food security, and occupation (2003-2004 only)
[32-36].
Participants reported their annual family income in
$5000 increments, with a top category of greater than
$75,000. If they refused to answer at this level of detail,
they were asked whether their income was less or
greater than $20,000. We categorized annual family
income in two ways: 1) in four groups, $0-19,999, $20-
44,999, $45-74,999, and $75,000 and greater, and 2) in
two groups, with a $20,000 cut point, a measure often
used in NHANES studies because it maximizes sample
size. We also considered the poverty-income ratio (PIR),
a ratio of the midpoint of the family income category to
the official U.S. poverty threshold as determined by the
U.S. Census Bureau, adjusted for family size [35]. A PIR
of 1 means that family income is equal to the poverty
threshold [37]. We used the following categories: less
than 1 (i.e. below the poverty threshold), 1-3, and
greater than 3. Finally, we looked at family income
adjusted by the square root [38] of family size (available
only in 2005-2006 data) or household size (for 2003-
2004 data), categorized into quartiles.
Educational attainment was assessed for those aged 20
and older. We used the following categories: less than
high school, high school graduate, some college/associ-
ate's degree, and college graduate or above.
Data on occupation were available for 2003-2004 only,
and for those over age 16. Participants were asked to
choose from a list of 41 possible occupational groups

for both their current and longest-held job; examples
included "teacher," "waiter and waitress," "executive,
administrator, manager," and "construction trades" [33].
To categorize occupation, we used an approach that is a
hybrid of the U.S. model, which groups jobs by skill,
industry, or type (i.e. white collar, service workers, farm
workers, blue collar), and the U.K. "work relations"
model, which uses 5 categories based on "aspects of
work and market situations and of the labor contract"
(ranging from managerial/professional to semiroutine/
routine) [29]. This hybrid classification system has been
employed in previous studies using NHANES data [39];
detail on categories is available in Additional file 1. In
our analysis we used information on longest-held
occupation.
Food security was measured by NHANES using the U.
S. Food Security Survey Module that assesses whether
participants and others in their family had adequate
food over the last 12 months [32]. Questions included,
"were you ever hungry but didn't eat because you
couldn't afford enough food?" and "did your child ever
skip meals because there wasn't enough money for
food?" In 2005-2006, all households were asked the food
security questions regardless of income; in 2003-2004,
households with incomes over 4 times the poverty
threshold were screened out [32,34]. Responses to the
individual food security questions were summed by
NHANES into an overall food security status variable,
and reported as full, marginal, low, and very low. In
addition, we looked at whether the participant or a
member of their household received emergency food
(from a church, food pantry, food bank, or soup kitchen)
in the last 12 months.
NHANES assessed race/ethnicity through a series of
questions [35]. The participant was first asked whether
they consider themselves Hispanic/Latino. They were
then asked, "What race do you consider yourself to
be?" and could select one or more from a list of fif-
teen options, including "White," "Black/African Amer-
ican," and "Some other race." Finally, they were asked
to choose the one group that best represents their
race, with the possible option, "I cannot choose one
race." The variable released by NHANES combines
these questions and groups people into one of five
categories: Mexican American, Other Hispanic, Non-
Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic White, and Other
including Multiracial. We also examined whether
there were differences among Mexican Americans
according to country of birth, since a previous study
of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) found
important differences in serum concentration by coun-
try of origin [40].
Covariates
We included a small group of covariates in our analyses
a priori based on known associations with urine/blood
concentrations of BPA and PFCs: age (in categories: 6-
11, 12-19, 20-59, older than 60), gender, and in the case
of BPA, urinary creatinine, a measure of urinary dilution
(continuous variable, mg/dL of urine). We included
creatinine as a term in the model rather than using
creatinine-adjusted BPA concentrations; creatinine is
known to vary by age, gender, and race/ethnicity [41].
As previous studies have reported changes in BPA and
PFC body burdens over time, we also controlled for
NHANES cycle [14].
We tested to see whether additional variables were
acting as confounders; these included time of exam ses-
sion and total cholesterol (TC, in PFC models only).
Participants over age 12 were randomly assigned to
either the morning or afternoon/evening exam sessions;
those attending the morning session were asked to fast
for 9.5 hours, and the latter two for 6 hours [31]. An
examination of urinary BPA and reported fasting time
in 2003-2004 NHANES data found a decline in BPA
concentrations with reported fasting time [24]. Although
participants were randomly assigned to exam session
time, it is possible that there could be differences in
attendance or fasting adherence. TC has been shown to
be associated with PFCs in this data set and is likely
associated with SEP as well [13].
Statistical analysis
We compared the different measures of SEP by examin-
ing frequency tables of education, occupation, and food
security by quartiles of adjusted family income. We ana-
lyzed associations between chemical concentrations and
SEP and race/ethnicity using multivariable linear regres-
sion. Both BPA and PFC concentrations were approxi-
mately log-normally distributed; while most individuals
had detectable concentrations, the great majority of
values were on the low end of the distribution. We thus
analyzed both as natural log-transformed continuous
variables. We first examined associations with SEP mea-
sures separately, controlling for race/ethnicity and the
previously-mentioned covariates. Because we wanted to
compare different SEP measures, the final study popula-
tion in the income and food security models consisted
of participants who had complete data on all income
and food security variables. The sample sizes were smal-
ler for the education and occupation analyses due to the
more limited population for which these variables were
available (Additional file 2). In this subset of participants
we also examined associations with income and food
security.

To determine if certain SEP variables were more
important predictors than others, we next included mul-
tiple SEP variables in the same model. We studied the
relationship between SEP and race/ethnicity by compar-
ing results of models with race/ethnicity alone to those
that included SEP measures to assess whether this chan-
ged the race/ethnicity results. We also considered, sepa-
rately, interaction by age and gender by including age-
and gender-by-SEP terms in the models, and by using
stratification.
All regression analyses were performed using the SAS
9.1 Proc SURVEYREG procedure, which takes into
account possible correlation between the strata and
clusters by which NHANES samples the population. As
our intent was to investigate these relationships in a
defined population, models were adjusted for relevant
covariates instead of using NHANES sampling weights.
This adjustment is regarded as a good compromise
between efficiency and bias [42].
We present effect estimates for levels of SEP variables
and racial/ethnic groups, which represent the percent
difference in BPA and PFC concentration for each cate-
gory compared to the reference group, and their corre-
sponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Effect
estimates were calculated by exponentiating the natural
log-transformed regression coefficients. We assessed sta-
tistical significant at the alpha = 0.05 level.
Results
Of the total NHANES 2003-2006 sample, 5062 partici-
pants had BPA measurements and 4214 had PFC mea-
surements; the difference in numbers is due to the fact
that PFCs were not measured in 6-11 year-olds. For
income and food security measures of SEP, which were
available for all age groups, our final sample size was
4739 for BPA and 3953 for PFCs, after excluding those
with missing data for the variables of interest (see Addi-
tional file 2). The different income measures we studied
had different numbers of participants with missing data:
family income categorized as less or greater than
$20,000 had the fewest missing participants (3%), and
adjusted family income and PIR had the most (5%). The
final sample sizes for the education analyses were
restricted to those older than 20, and for occupation to
those older than 16 and in the 2003-2004 cycle.
Table 1 displays unadjusted median concentrations of
BPA (creatinine-corrected) and PFCs by covariates, the
SEP measures studied, and racial/ethnic groups. Median
urinary BPA was highest in children, women, partici-
pants in the earlier NHANES cycle, and those with
lower incomes. Of the PFCs, PFOS had the highest
serum concentrations; median levels were an order of
magnitude greater than PFOA, PFHxS, and PFNA. PFCs
overall were higher in men than women, and PFOS was
highest in the oldest age group and in the earlier
NHANES cycle. Differences by income and race/ethni-
city were most apparent for PFOS and PFOA, with the
highest levels seen in higher income groups and non-
Hispanic Whites.
The different SEP measures were related to one
another in a predictable fashion: of those who graduated
from college, 67% were in the top adjusted family
income quartile; 43% of participants who never worked
were in the bottom quartile; and 53% and 57% of those
with very low food security or who received emergency
food, respectively, were in the bottom quartile (Addi-
tional file 3). However, there was some discordance
across SEP variables. For example, almost 30% of parti-
cipants with less than a high school education were in
the top two income quartiles; the distribution of the
occupational categories, particularly the "blue collar,
high skill" group, was fairly evenly distributed across
income quartiles; and close to 40% of those reporting
full food security were in the bottom two quartiles.
Socioeconomic position
In adjusted regression analyses, urinary concentrations
of BPA were inversely related to all four measures of
income (Table 2). For example, those in the lowest
quartile of adjusted family income had BPA concentra-
tions 27% (95% CI, 15 to 40%) higher than those in the
highest income quartile. Though the four family income
variables revealed similar patterns, the magnitude of the
difference was decreased with the two-category variable.
We also saw higher concentrations in those with very
low food security, and those who received emergency
food. Though we did not see an inverse trend with edu-
cational attainment, college graduates had the lowest
BPA levels. Results for occupation did not reveal a con-
sistent pattern, though the "blue collar, high skill" group
(including vehicle mechanics, construction workers, and
members of the armed forces) had higher BPA concen-
trations. In these and all other models, controlling for
exam session did not change the observed associations
with SEP or race/ethnicity.
Results for PFCs revealed an opposite relationship
than that for BPA; all four PFCs had strong positive
associations with income (Table 2). For PFOA, those in
the lowest quartile of adjusted family income had PFC
serum concentrations 21% (95% CI, -26 to -14%) lower
than those in the highest quartile. As in the BPA analy-
sis, using the two-category income variable attenuated
the association, and income measures adjusted for
household size resulted in stronger associations with
PFC levels. Those who received emergency food had
lower concentrations of PFOS, PFOA, and PFNA, as did
those with low food security (although we did not see
the same strong association with very low food security).

Associations between education and occupation and
PFC level were weaker than for income, though PFNA
concentrations were lower in those who had never
worked. When restricted to the subset with information
on education and occupation, relationships for income,
food security, and emergency food assistance were
slightly stronger than in the population overall (data not
shown). Similar to exam session, controlling for TC in
these and all other PFC models did not affect results.
When multiple SEP measures were included in the
same model, adjusted family income remained the pre-
dictor of the greatest magnitude and strength for both
BPA and PFCs (Table 3). Effect estimates for food
security status and use of emergency food decreased
when income was added, though, for BPA, regression
coefficients remained elevated in the same pattern (but
without statistical significance).
Modification by age and gender
We found some evidence for different effects by age in
the results for adjusted family income and food security.
Overall, the effect estimates for family income were
most consistent in 20-59 year-olds, with a clear trend
for BPA and all four PFCs (Additional file 4). For BPA,
income was only associated with urinary levels in the
younger three age groups; there was no association in
the oldest age group. The strong association between
BPA concentrations and food security (both very low
food security and use of emergency food) was markedly
stronger in 6-11 year-olds. Children who received

to 112%) than children who did not. This relationship
was much smaller in 12-19 and 20-59 year-olds and not
evident at all in those over 60. Results were similar in
the very low food security group, except that partici-
pants over 60 had increased concentrations similar to 6-
11 year-olds. For PFCs, the inverse associations by
income and food security were most apparent in 20-59
year-olds except for PFHxS, where associations were
also strong in those over 60.
We observed fewer differences by gender (data not
shown). Very low food security and receipt of emer-
gency food were more strongly associated with BPA
concentrations in women than in men. For PFCs,

than in women, whereas the magnitude of the associa-
tion for family income was greater in women than in
men.
Race/ethnicity and SEP
Tables 4, 5 examines the relationship between race/eth-
nicity and SEP. In models unadjusted for a measure of
SEP, BPA concentrations were lower in Mexican Ameri-
cans compared to Non-Hispanic Whites (Table 4). The
relationship was stronger in Mexican Americans born in
the U.S. than in those born elsewhere (Table 5). The
association became even stronger when controlling for
adjusted family income, indicating that this difference
was not mediated by income. When stratified by quartile
of adjusted family income, the decrease in Mexican
Americans relative to other groups was strongest in the
lowest two income quartiles and not evident in the top
quartile (data not shown). BPA concentrations in Non-
Hispanic Blacks and Whites were similar.
Mexican Americans also had the lowest concentra-
tions of all four PFCs (Table 4). When controlled for
income, these differences decreased slightly. Foreign-
born Mexican Americans had lower levels of PFCs than
those born in the U.S. (Table 5) With PFOA, for exam-
ple, foreign-born Mexican Americans had serum con-
centrations that were 40% lower (95% CI, -45 to -35%)
than non-Hispanic Whites, whereas the difference in
those born in the U.S. was 17% (95% CI, -25 to -8%).
This difference by country of origin was less apparent
for PFNA. Stratification by adjusted family income
revealed that Mexican Americans for the most part had
the lowest levels of PFCs across all income quartiles,
compared with other ethnicities, with some evidence for

slightly stronger decreases in the lowest income quar-
tiles (data not shown). Non-Hispanic Blacks had lower
PFOA concentrations compared to Non-Hispanic
Whites, but higher PFNA and, to a lesser extent, PFOS
levels. These positive associations increased with control
for income.
Discussion
Our findings show that people with lower incomes, who
may be more likely to suffer from other disparities in
health and exposures, have a greater burden of exposure
to BPA. The results for children are especially troubling.
Children overall had higher urinary BPA concentrations
than teenagers or adults, but children whose food
security was very low or who received emergency food
assistance - in other words, the most vulnerable children
- had the highest levels of any demographic group.
Their urinary BPA levels were twice as high as adults
who did not receive emergency food assistance. Con-
cerns about health effects from BPA exposure are stron-
gest for young children and neonates because they are
still undergoing development [3]. Results for BPA by
race/ethnicity, adjusting for income, revealed that Non-
Hispanic Whites and Blacks had similar urinary levels,
and being Mexican American appeared to be highly
protective.
Findings for PFCs revealed differences by socioeco-
nomic position in the opposite direction. Participants

with the highest incomes had the highest serum concen-
trations. We did not see the same vulnerability in
younger age groups as with BPA; associations with
income were strongest in adults. However, NHANES
did not measure PFCs in 6-11 year-olds. While there
was some variation by race/ethnicity, Non-Hispanic
Whites had the highest levels for two of the four PFCs
and being Mexican American again appeared to be
protective.
The possible pathways by which SEP is associated with
differential exposures to BPA and PFCs may be eluci-
dated by comparing results for the individual SEP vari-
ables. Family income was by far the most consistent and
important predictor of concentrations; it had a clear
dose-response pattern for all chemicals, and remained
the strongest when included in models with other SEP
variables simultaneously. Conceptually, income reflects
access to material goods; a family's current household
income is the most specific measure of their immediate
financial resources [28]. Thus, income may affect expo-
sure to BPA and PFCs via types of foods consumed or
via other consumer products used (or not used) in the
home. Past studies that have examined the effect of
income, education, and occupation on diet quality have
consistently found that income is the most important
and strongest predictor of diet [43,44]. Given that diet is
assumed to be a major pathway of exposure to these
chemicals, differences in food purchasing patterns by
income seems one likely explanation for the observed
differences.
The literature on specific differences in diet by mea-
sures of SEP is large; a review offers this summary of
socioeconomic status (SES) and dietary intake: "available
evidence suggests that consumption of whole grains,
lean meats, fish, low-fat dairy products, and fresh vege-
tables and fruit was consistently associated with higher
SES groups, whereas the consumption of fatty meats,
refined grains, and added fats was associated with lower
SES groups" [45]. Cost of food is a compelling hypoth-
esis for why this differential exists, as foods with higher
energy density are cheaper per amount of energy, but
also tend to be nutrient-poor [45]. This is thought to be
an important reason why consumption of fresh fruits
and vegetables in particular is lower in people with
lower incomes. Income is also a strong determinant of
where a person lives, and there is a growing body of lit-
erature on the lack of access to large supermarkets and
ample fresh fruits and vegetables in lower income neigh-
borhoods [46].
This is the first study to examine the relationship
between body burdens of BPA and PFCs and two mea-
sures of food security as possible proxies for SEP. We
conceptualized these variables as representing the inter-
section of income and dietary behavior, and assumed
that those with very low food security, or those who
received emergency food, were an especially vulnerable
population in terms of accessible dietary options. Parti-
cularly in regards to BPA exposure, we hypothesized
that they would be more likely to eat canned foods.
Recent research indicates that eating canned and pack-
aged foods can contribute to BPA body burdens [47].
We did see associations in the hypothesized direction
between BPA and the food security measures; there was
a particularly strong signal with very low food security
compared to low and marginal food security, and an
association of slightly lower magnitude in those who
received emergency food. These associations were atte-
nuated when controlling for income, though coefficients
remained positive. More striking were the associations
between BPA and food security in 6-11 year-olds, which
were of the greatest magnitude of any age group. This
could be due to greater consumption of foods contain-
ing BPA, or the fact that children consume more food
per body weight than adults. Though use of emergency
food was also associated with PFCs, food security status
was not as important a predictor for these compounds.
We saw fewer and less consistent associations between
education and concentrations of BPA and PFCs, particu-
larly PFCs. Education is a long-term indicator of SEP,
and embodies the transition in SEP from childhood to
adulthood [28,44]. In terms of the specific ways in
which education may impact exposure to chemicals, it is
thought to represent the ability to access and interpret
health-related information [28]. With exposure to BPA
and PFCs, however, this type of knowledge may not be
useful in reducing exposures, as consumers most often
do not know that they are being exposed to these che-
micals, nor how exposure is occurring. The recent flurry
of media and political action around BPA in baby bot-
tles and PC water bottles may be changing this dynamic
for BPA, and may explain the slightly stronger associa-
tions we observed with education, but increased atten-
tion began only in the last few years and is not relevant
for the bulk of the study period [48]. Similar to previous
studies, we found some discordance between education
and current income [44,49]. For BPA, which has a very
short half-life, we would be more interested in current
and not long-term income, since the foods and products
a person purchased in the very recent past directly con-
tribute to urinary levels.
There appeared to be little association between BPA
and PFCs and occupation; however, our ability to draw
conclusions about these relationships is limited by the
fact that we had smaller numbers as data were only
available for adults from 2003-2004. We did not see
many associations between the compounds and occupa-
tion classified into five skill- and work relations-based
categories. It seems unlikely that work-related

psychosocial stress would affect exposure, though the
physical conditions of a workplace could contribute to
exposures. Examples include working in an office with
new carpeting or furniture that contains PFC precursors
[21] or a job in retail that involves handling credit card
receipts that contain BPA [50].
The weaker associations observed for education and
occupation may also be partly related to the fact that
both are measured on the level of the individual,
whereas family income and food security are family-
level measures [44]. The latter two variables may be
more accurate measures of SEP insofar as family pur-
chasing patterns are concerned. This distinction could
be important for food purchasing behavior, as it is not
clear who in the family (i.e. the participant or some
other family member) makes the food shopping
decisions.
Our results clearly show differences in BPA and PFC
body burdens by measures of SEP that were not
explained by race/ethnicity, and vice versa. It is likely
that cultural behaviors and patterns are associated with
race/ethnicity independent of SEP. The strikingly lower
concentrations of both chemicals in Mexican Americans,
even after controlling for income, was the most notable
result regarding race/ethnicity. This is particularly unex-
pected for BPA, where Mexican Americans do not fit
with the observed pattern of lower income groups hav-
ing higher urinary concentrations. Mexican Americans
and Hispanics have been shown to have higher intake of
fruits and vegetables compared to Non-Hispanic Blacks
and Whites in different population-based surveys,
including NHANES 2003-2004 [51], the 2005 California
Health Interview Survey [51], and the 2000 National
Health Interview Survey [52]. Eating more fresh fruits
and vegetables is likely to be associated with eating less
canned foods, which may explain the lower urinary BPA
levels seen in Mexican Americans compared to other
groups.
In addition, we observed that foreign-born Mexican
Americans had markedly lower serum concentrations of
PFCs than U.S.-born Mexican Americans, except for
PFNA. This is consistent with the fact that PFCs have
long half-lives, and exposure from many years past (i.e.
when living in Mexico, where exposures may be lower)
could impact current serum levels. Similar patterns have
been seen for some other persistent lipophilic chemicals
[40,53]. For BPA, foreign- and U.S.-born Mexican
Americans had similar levels, which makes sense given
that BPA has a short half-life, and lower exposures from
years past would not matter.
A final aspect of SEP and its relationship with race/
ethnicity that must be mentioned is wealth. Wealth can
be thought of as the "accumulated assets" of an indivi-
dual or family, usually in the form of savings, real estate,
and inherited items, and represents economic security
[54]. While there are no direct measures of wealth in
NHANES, differences in wealth by race/ethnicity are
reported to be much larger than differences by income;
for the same income, the amount of wealth for African
Americans and Hispanics has been shown to be much
lower than for Whites [28]. Thus, adjusting for income
alone may underestimate the real effect of SEP [28], and
differences by race/ethnicity may suffer from residual
confounding due to inability to adjust for wealth.
Our findings have various practical implications for
environmental epidemiology. It is standard in environ-
mental epidemiology studies to include some measure
of SEP as a covariate in models. But, it is rare to see a
discussion of the rationale for the choice of SEP vari-
able. In many instances, there seems to be an assump-
tion that different measures, particularly income and
education, serve as surrogates for the same underlying
phenomenon, and that they can be used interchange-
ably. Our study finds that, for urine and serum concen-
trations of BPA and PFCs, this is not the case; the SEP
measures we studied do not overlap entirely with one
another, and had different estimates of effect in our
regression models. We conclude that, in the context of
this study, income, education, occupation, and food
security do not represent the same socioeconomic con-
structs, but rather seem to capture different aspects of
how SEP may be related to exposure to BPA and PFCs.
While constraints regarding data availability and the
need to maximize sample size will always be an issue,
the question of which SEP measure to use is an impor-
tant methodologic concern, and merits more considera-
tion by researchers in the field.
As discussed, family income was the most important
SEP predictor in our investigation. We found that ade-
quate gradations must be used, however, to see the full
extent of the effect. When modeled as a dichotomous
variable with a cut point of $20,000, which is tempting
to do in NHANES as there are fewer missing partici-
pants, the full effect of SEP was underestimated. There
was also some indication that income measures that
adjusted for household size, such as adjusted family
income and PIR, were stronger predictors. Regarding
education, we found that using a dichotomous variable
with a cut point of high school graduation did not fully
capture the SEP difference. Participants with some col-
lege or an associate's degree were more similar to high
school graduates than college graduates. A disadvantage
of using education as a measure of SEP is that it is not
a useful measure for children, a concern that also
applies to occupation. In addition, our findings related
to occupation are limited due to the smaller sample
size, but it may be the case that a different approach to
categorizing occupation, such as one based on type of
Nelson et al. Environmental Health 2012, 11:10

industry, would be more closely related to the outcomes
of interest. Food security, though not as commonly used
to assess SEP, revealed important information about a
vulnerable population - children whose families have
very low food security or receive emergency food aid -
information that other SEP measures failed to provide.
Regarding the measurement of race and ethnicity in
studies such as these, our findings show that useful
information can be gleaned from considering country of
origin, particularly for Mexican Americans. This follows
previous examples [40,53].
Inherent in our study are a number of limitations.
One concern is possible confounding by geography,
which we cannot assess with publicly-available NHANES
data. Regional and local populations vary in measures of
SEP and race/ethnicity; if BPA and PFC exposures also
differ with geography, there could be confounding. This
geographic variation in chemical exposures could occur
through differences in environmental contamination-
localized contamination with certain PFCs has been
reported in the USA (e.g., Hoffman et al. [55])- or in
consumption patterns of foods and other products that
lead to exposure. In particular, the striking findings for
Mexican Americans must be taken with caution. Zota et
al. [40] received permission to access state-level geo-
graphic information for NHANES 2003-2004 PBDE data
and showed that, because Californians overall had
higher serum concentrations of PBDEs and a large pro-
portion of Mexican Americans sampled by NHANES
lived in California, residence in California confounded
results for Mexican Americans. Further investigation of
geographical differences in body burdens would be
greatly aided by the public release of NHANES data
indicating region of the USA, something that would
appear unlikely to threaten confidentiality.
We relied on a single biomonitoring measurement of
the chemicals of interest. This is less of an issue for
PFCs, which have long half-lives and we would not
expect concentrations to vary significantly within an
individual. For BPA, however, this is more of a concern.
Mahalingaiah et al. [56] showed a single spot urine sam-
ple to be predictive of exposure over weeks to months,
despite within person variability. However, they assessed
a single sample's ability to classify participants into ter-
tiles, which is not how we modeled our data. And, they
concluded that a second sample offered improvements
in classifying individuals.
For both compounds, there are complications involved
in interpreting results from biomonitoring data. While
biomonitoring measurements provide a useful estimate
of internal dose, there is likely inter- and intra-indivi-
dual variation in measurements as a result of various
factors that influence the chemical's pharmacokinetics, i.
e. its distribution among compartments of the body,
metabolism, and excretion [57]. These factors include
genetics, biological characteristics such as gender, body
fatness, and liver function, and environmental factors
such as diet, all of which may affect a chemical's phar-
macokinetics. Though these concerns may be particu-
larly relevant for BPA, which is measured as a urinary
metabolite, many questions remain about the pharmaco-
kinetic behavior of both BPA and PFCs in the body.
The measures of SEP we studied are all based on self-
reported data. Getting participants to report personal
income in particular is notoriously difficult [28]. How-
ever, the NHANES approach of asking people to report
in income categories seemed to work reasonably well, as
less than 4% of participants were missing family income
data. A limitation in our assessment of SEP was the
availability of only two years of data for occupation.
Our study has several strengths, including a large sam-
ple size, unrivalled in studies of this nature that involve
costly biomonitoring measurements. The NHANES
sampling methodology of oversampling certain racial/
ethnic, income, and age groups was critical in providing
an excellent distribution of participants across different
categories. Thus, we had ample power to detect associa-
tions between different SEP and racial/ethnic groups,
and were able to consider modification by age and gen-
der. Another key advantage was the availability of robust
data on a variety of SEP measures. This enabled us to
compare different SEP-related variables.
This paper has primarily explored associations
between body burdens and measures of SEP and race/
ethnicity. More research is needed on the specific
aspects of diet, consumer products, and other activities
or circumstances that provide the links between SEP/
race/ethnicity and body burdens (Figure 1). This ques-
tion might be approached using dietary intake data,
measures of indoor exposure, and other techniques.
Conclusions
Characterizing social disparities in exposure to poten-
tially harmful chemicals is an important responsibility of
environmental health. The juxtaposition of BPA and
PFCs together reveals a striking opposite pattern of
associations with measures of SEP, particularly income.
BPA levels were inversely associated and PFC levels
positively associated with family income. Differences by
race/ethnicity - most notably, markedly lower concen-
trations in Mexican Americans for both BPA and PFCs
- were independent of SEP. We conclude that income,
education, occupation, and food security represent dis-
tinct facets of social stratification and are not necessarily
interchangeable as measures of SEP in environmental
epidemiology studies. In these data, family income with
adjustment for family size was the strongest predictor of
BPA and PFC levels among the different measures of

SEP we studied. Examining differences in body burden
by a range of SEP measures can provide useful insights
about the conceptual basis for the choice of SEP mea-
sure and about vulnerable populations, and can raise
hypotheses about possible sources of exposure.
