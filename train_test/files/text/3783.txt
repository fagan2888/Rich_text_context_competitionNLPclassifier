Abstract: Using a large sample of non-institutionalized individuals from the Netherlands
(n = 7610), we examined the influence of relatedness on an individual's knowledge about
whether their sibling is alive or not. Respondents were generally less likely to know
whether their sibling was alive if they were not fully related. The effects were stronger for
differences between paternal half-siblings and full siblings than for differences between
maternal half-siblings and full siblings.

Introduction
From a kin selection perspective (Hamilton, 1964), relatedness is predicted to have
a strong impact on family interactions, even in modern societies (Emlen, 1995, 1997).
Evolutionists have thoroughly examined the influence of genetic relatedness on human
parent-offspring relations (Daly and Wilson, 1981, 1982, 1985, 1988). Several studies have
also investigated the role of biological kinship for altruism between individuals (e.g.,
Korchmaros and Kenny, 2001; Madsen et al., 2007) but the role of relatedness for
investment between sibling has been relatively unstudied. With regards to the study of
siblings, evolutionists have mainly focussed on sibling rivalry (Sulloway, 1996, 2001),
sibling differentiation (Dunn and Plomin, 1991; Plomin and Daniels, 1987) and cues to
incest avoidance (Bevc and Silverman, 1993, 2000; Lieberman, Tooby, and Cosmides,
2003; Fessler and Navarrete, 2004). In comparison, relatively little attention has been paid

to studying actual investment between siblings. Emlen (1997) suggested however that
individuals will invest more in, and have closer relationships with, full siblings than half-
siblings or stepsiblings. There is some evidence for this prediction: both parents and
children report more conflict between siblings when siblings are not fully related
(Hetherington, 1988; Aquilino, 1991 for review, but see Kim, Hetherington, and Reiss,
1999). Adult siblings also appear to invest more in fully related siblings than in half-
siblings (Pollet, 2007). Even when a society places a strong emphasis on treating all
siblings equal, regardless of their relatedness, siblings display more solidarity when fully
related (Jankowiak and Diderich, 2000). Here, we examine whether relatedness affects
basic knowledge about whether or not a sibling is alive in a cohort of Dutch adults.
Knowledge about whether a related individual is alive or not is required in order to
invest in them, and siblings who do invest will consequently have knowledge of their
current state. Our hypothesis is that respondents will be more likely to know whether a
sibling is alive when they are fully related than when they are not. It is important to bear in
mind that this hypothesis is at the ultimate level (Tinbergen, 1963), we are not testing
which proximate mechanisms regulate investment in kin.
One could argue that growing up together, rather than genetic relatedness per se,
knowledge about a siblings' death. Identity theory (Stets and Burke, 2000) suggests that
individuals who growing up together will learn to identify themselves as members of the
same family. This proximate theory would suggest that relatedness in most families is
confounded with being raised together. This confound of childhood co-residence can be
distinguished from relatedness by comparing not only paternal half-siblings with full
siblings but also maternal half-siblings with full siblings. Maternal half-siblings are brought
up together just like full siblings, in contrast to paternal half-siblings (De Graaf, 1997;
Pollet, 2007). If we find a consistent difference between maternal half-siblings and full-
siblings, this suggests that genetic relatedness independently influences knowledge about a
sibling's death. The scenario proposed by identity theory would not hold in this case.
Materials and Methods
The first wave of the Netherlands Kinship Panel Study (NKPS) dataset was
obtained through the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute (NIDI). The
NKPS is a large scale longitudinal study, designed to investigate family and kin relations in
the Netherlands (Dykstra et al., 2004). The first wave was completed mid-2004; we used
the most recent version of the first wave dataset for this study (version of 21-7-05; main
sample). The sampling procedure, representativeness, variables and survey method are
described in detail by Dykstra and colleagues (2004). In the NKPS, respondents are asked
to list all their siblings (adopted, step, half- and full siblings) and to indicate whether they
know whether this sibling is alive or not. For each half-sibling we coded whether they were
paternal or maternal. No data are available on whether stepsiblings are maternal or paternal.
Given the small numbers of adopted siblings (<1%), these were excluded from analyses.
Our analyses thus contained four categories for sibling type (full sibling (FS), maternal
half-sibling (MHS); paternal half-sibling (PHS); stepsibling (SS)). In this sample, if the
parents of the respondent split up, the respondent virtually always remains in a family
structure containing their biological mother rather than remaining in a family structure
containing their biological father (Pollet, 2007). Thus, maternal half-siblings, like full
Relatedness and knowledge about death

siblings, are raised together, whereas paternal half-siblings are not.
We present data for the first six siblings. The vast majority (95.3%) of the total
sample of respondents with siblings has six or fewer siblings. Starting from the seventh
sibling, sample size becomes increasingly small for constructing multinomial logistic
regression models (MLR's). For these six siblings we constructed separate multinomial
logistic regressions in order to investigate the independent effect of sibling type on
knowledge about the sibling's death (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 1989; Menard, 1995;
Pampel, 2000; Peng, Lee, and Ingersoll, 2002). Multinomial logistic regression is used to
predict outcome variables of a categorical nature. It is relatively free of assumptions and
statistically robust. Parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood. As a parameter
selection procedure, we used forward stepwise. Model outcomes were the same in terms of
model fit and Nagelkerke R² (Nagelkerke, 1991) when backward stepwise was used
instead. Besides relatedness, we entered the following control variables in our analysis:
education (9 categories: from incomplete/primary to university/postgraduate; treated as
interval), age, age differences between the siblings, gender of the respondent, and number
of family transitions before age of 16. A family transition refers to an alteration in the
respondent's family living situation since birth, for instance going to live with grandparents
or with another family member (see Dykstra et al., 2004 for more info on these variables).
Missing values on these variables were deleted listwise. The descriptives for the sample are
listed in Table 1.
For each of the models we present odds ratios, Wald statistics and p values for the
likelihood ratio tests (pLLR
). The odds ratio gives the relative odds of not knowing whether
the sibling is alive if the independent variables are changed in the specified way (e.g. a
different sibling type). Odds ratios for the control variables are not reported here and can be
obtained from the author. The Wald statistic is used to test whether an odds ratio differs
significantly from 1 (Pampel, 2000). The pLLR
for each variable is based on the difference
in model fit (-2LogLikelihood; Pampel, 2000) between a model with the variable and one
without, and is thus a measure of significance of effect of each independent variable. The
Nagelkerke R² is a measure of variance explained by the overall model.

The regression models and odds ratios are represented in Table 2. The Nagelkerke
R² varied between 0.162 and 0.34, which is good according to standards in the social
sciences. Across all six models, sibling type proves to be a highly significant predictor of
knowledge about a sibling's death (pllr
< 0.001). The other variables did not prove
consistent predictors. Across the six models, odds ratios for SS versus FS, PHS versus FS,
and MHS versus FS were all significant, with a strong effect size (varying between 5.36
and 42.4). For instance, respondents are 25.75 times more likely to not know whether their
sibling 1 is alive when sibling 1 is a SS than when he/she is a FS. Odds ratios were
generally stronger for SS versus FS (15.9 - 42.4, mean 27.57) and PHS versus FS (13.03 -
36.74, mean 25.4), than for MHS versus FS (5.36 - 23.56, mean 11.95). However, the
direct comparisons of PHS to MHS and SS to MHS produced only one significant odds
ratio each.

Discussion
Relatedness influenced an individual's knowledge about the death of a sibling:
respondents who were fully related were significantly more likely to have this basic
knowledge about their siblings than individuals who were not fully related. Other variables
such as gender or age of the respondent did not consistently influence this knowledge.
Given that there are consistent differences not only between PHS and FS, but also between
MHS and FS, in knowledge about a sibling's death we can conclude that genetic
relatedness in itself influenced this knowledge. Childhood co-residence cannot account for
the observed differences between maternal half-siblings and full siblings, as in both cases
siblings are raised together. Thus, we find support for Emlen's prediction (1997): full
siblings tend to have closer relationships than half-siblings or step-siblings.
This study dealt with an ultimate question and did not examine the proximate
mechanisms regulating kin investment in detail. An obvious proximate mechanism that can
explain the observed difference between PHS and FS and between SS and FS is childhood
co-residence. Both evolutionary theory and identity theory lead to suggest that being raised
together should be an important cue to kinship. For example, childhood co-residence plays
a very important role for incest avoidance (e.g., Bevc and Silverman, 2000; Lieberman et
al., 2003). Childhood co-residence can also be linked to the recently suggested role of the
maternal perinatal association (MPA), seeing your mother in close association with your
sibling, for kinship detection (Lieberman, Tooby, and Cosmides, 2007). We are not

suggesting that childhood co-residence and/or MPA is the only kinship cue governing
investment but it is likely to be a very important one. Childhood co-residence and/or the
MPA, however, cannot explain the differences between full siblings and maternal half-
siblings. It is likely that a cue such as third party knowledge, somebody telling an
individual that he or she is a fully related sibling to another person, might be important
here. However, such a cue can definitely be the sole cue regulating sibling investment: the
differences between PHS and FS and SS and FS were far stronger than those between MHS
and FS. This indicates that being raised together and the maternal perinatal association are
likely to be important cues in determining later investments. Thus, multiple kinship cues
affect basic knowledge about a sibling's death. Further research is however necessary to
disentangle the relative importance of each kinship cue and how they interact in kin
detection.
The direct comparisons of SS and MHS, and PHS and MHS were not consistently
significant. This is likely due to the small number of cases under comparison. Larger
samples are necessary to further explore the relative importance of relatedness compared to
being raised together.
In conclusion, as kin selection theory (Hamilton, 1964) and Emlen (1997) lead to
predict, genetic relatedness strongly affects an individual's knowledge about whether a
sibling is alive or not. Individuals were significantly more likely to have basic knowledge
about their sibling when fully related, and such knowledge is likely to be symptomatic of
their ongoing investments in that relationship.
