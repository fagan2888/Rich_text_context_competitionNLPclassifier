ABSTRACT
Background: Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs)
has been linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes.
Objective: We examined national trends in SSB consumption
among US adults by sociodemographic characteristics, body weight
status, and weight-loss intention.
Design: We analyzed 24-h dietary recall data to estimate beverage
consumption among adults (aged !20 y) obtained from the third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III,
1988­1994; n ¼ 15979) and NHANES 1999­2004 (n ¼ 13431).
Results: From 1988­1994 to 1999­2004 on the survey day, the
percentage of adult SSB drinkers increased from 58% to 63%
(P , 0.001), per capita consumption of SSB increased by 46
kcal/d (P ¼ 0.001), and daily SSB consumption among drinkers
increased by 6 oz (P , 0.001). In both survey periods, per capita
SSB consumption was highest among young adults (231­289 kcal/d)
and lowest among the elderly (68­83 kcal/d). Young blacks had the
highest percentage of SSB drinkers and the highest per capita con-
sumption compared with white and Mexican American adults (P ,
0.05). Overweight-obese adults with weight-loss intention (compared
with those without) were significantly less likely to drink SSB, but
they still consumed a considerable amount in1999­2004 (278 kcal/d).
Among young adults, 20% of SSB calories were consumed at work.
Conclusions: Over the past decade, US adult SSB consumption has
increased. SSB comprises a considerable source of total daily intake
and is the largest source of beverage calories. SSB consumption is
highest among subgroups also at greatest risk of obesity and type
2 diabetes. Am J Clin Nutr 2009;89:372­81.
INTRODUCTION
Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) has been
linked to the obesity epidemic (1), which currently affects one-
third of US adults (2, 3), and type 2 diabetes (4). From 1977 to
2001, energy intake from soft drinks and fruit drinks increased
by 135% (5), and the prevalence of adult obesity doubled (6).
Over the same period, the percentage of calories from all bev-
erages increased by .50% (7).
Much of the literature on adult beverage consumption has
focused on specific drink types (8, 9) or on broad temporal trends
and patterns (5, 7, 10). With the exception of a few studies (5,
11), little research has focused on national changes in adult
beverage consumption by sociodemographic groups, body
weight status, and weight-loss intention. To our knowledge, no
research has examined these factors simultaneously. The dis-
proportionate effect of obesity on minority and low socioeco-
nomic status (SES) communities (2, 3, 12­14), the positive
association between intention to lose weight and weight control
behaviors (15­17), the significant effect of even modest weight
loss on the elimination or reduction of adverse health conditions
associated with obesity (18), and evidence suggesting that cal-
ories in liquid may be less well compensated than calories from
solid foods (19, 20) make this is an important area of study.
Although the complex interactions between factors that cause
obesity are not fully understood, it is widely accepted that
a positive energy balance (higher caloric intake than energy
expenditure) leads to weight gain (21, 22). Reduction of SSBs in
the adult diet may help prevent weight gain and promote weight
loss. Such efforts may offer relatively simple, low-cost solutions
to weight reduction and are consistent with recommended bev-
erage consumption patterns (23, 24). Moreover, the identifica-
tion of variations in beverage consumption by subpopulation
groups will be useful for the development of targeted policies or
nutrition programs aimed at reducing intake of ``empty calo-
ries'' among adults, particularly those from SSBs.
The purpose of this study was to describe national changes
(1988­1994 to 1999­2004) in the percentage of drinkers, amount
consumed, consumption location, and type of beverage among
US adults by sociodemographic characteristics, weight category,
and weight-loss intention. This analysis does not attempt to
estimate the effect of SSB intake on obesity incidence, given our
reliance on cross-sectional data. Other research, supported by
longitudinal data, provides strong evidence for a causal relation
betweenSSBintakeandincreasedbodymassindex(BMI;inkg/m2)
(1, 4, 25­27).

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Data and design
Nationally representative data from the third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III; 1988­1994) and
NHANES 1999­2004 were used. The NHANES is a population-
based survey designed to collect information on the health and
nutrition of the US population. Participants were selected based
on a multistage, clustered, probability sampling strategy. Survey
respondents are representative of the noninstitutionalized US
population. Since 1999, data have been collected annually. Our
analysis combined the continuous NHANES data collection
(1999­2004) and compared it with NHANES III (1988­1994). A
complete description of data collection procedures and analytic
guidelines are available elsewhere (www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm).
Study sample
The study sample consists of adults aged !20 y with com-
pleted 24-h dietary recalls from the 2 cross-sectional NHANES
surveys. Survey respondents were excluded if they were pregnant
at the time of data collection or if their dietary recall was in-
complete or unreliable (as determined by the NHANES staff).
Because of the small sample size of the other race-ethnicity
category, we only included non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black (hereafter referred to as whites and blacks), and Mexican
Americans in the analyses.
Measures
Beverages
Survey respondents reported all food and beverages consumed
in a prior 24-h period (midnight to midnight) and reported type,
quantity, time, and location of each food and beverage con-
sumption occasion. After the dietary interview, all reported food
and beverage items were systemically coded with the use of the
US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food and Nutrient Da-
tabase. Caloric content and other nutrients derived from each
consumed food or beverage item were calculated based on the
quantity of food and beverages reported and the corresponding
nutrient contents by the National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS). Given that only the NHANES 1999­2004 included
a second dietary recall, we only use the first dietary recall from
each survey for this analysis.
We identified 6 mutually exclusive beverage categories in the
NHANES III (from 549 beverage items) and the NHANES 1999­
2004 (from 523 beverage items) including 1) SSBs (soda, sport
drinks, fruit drinks and punches, low-calorie drinks, sweetened
tea, and other sweetened beverages), 2) 100% juice, 3) diet
beverages, 4) milk (including flavored milk), 5) coffee or tea,
and 6) alcohol (23). See Appendix A for more details. Of note,
some milk, coffee or tea, or alcoholic beverages may have added
sugar. To relate our results to dietary guidelines and inform
intervention strategies, we used kilocalories (1 kcal ¼ 4.2 kJ)
and fluid ounces (1 oz ¼ 28.57 mL) as 2 primary measures to
evaluate consumption patterns. Of note, information on con-
sumption location (where the beverage was consumed) was only
available in 1999­2004.
Body weight status
In both surveys, weight and height were measured with the use
of standard procedures in a mobile examination center. Normal
weight was defined as a BMI from 18.5 to 24.9; overweight was
defined as BMI from 25 to 29.9, and obese was defined as BMI !
30 (28).
Intention to lose weight
Respondent intention to lose weight was assessed by the
survey question, ``During the past 12 months, have you tried to
lose weight?'' Respondents who answered ``yes'' were catego-
rized as trying to lose weight.
Socioeconomic status
The poverty:income ratio (PIR; the ratio of household income
to a family's appropriate poverty threshold) was based on self-
reported household income. We dichotomized the PIR into lower
and higher income groups based on eligibility for food assistance
programs (ie, 130% of the poverty level). Education was
categorized into the following mutually exclusive 3 categories: 1)
less than high school, 2) high school (or GED), and 3) more than
high school.
Analysis
All analyses were weighted to be representative of the general
population and conducted using STATA, version 9.2 (Stata Corp,
College Station, TX) to account for the complex sampling
structure. Multivariate regressions were used to adjust for po-
tential changes in population composition over the 2 time
periods, including race-ethnicity, sex, income, age, marital status,
employment status, and education. All tables and figures report
predicted means based on the adjusted models.
RESULTS
The 2 samples had comparable distributions of sex, age,
employment status, and income status, but the 1999­2004 sample
had significantly fewer non-Hispanic whites and normal-weight
persons, and significantly more Mexican Americans, persons
with a high school education, obese persons, and persons trying to
lose weight (P , 0.001) (Table 1).
Overall adult beverage consumption
The percentage of adults consuming beverages, per capita
caloric consumption, and the daily caloric contribution among
drinkers on a typical day are given in Table 2. Over the period,
the percentage of drinkers and quantity consumed increased the
most for SSBs compared with the other beverage categories. In
1999­2004, 63% of adults consumed SSBs on a given day, up
from 58% in 1988­1994 (P , 0.001). Over the period, SSBs
represented the largest source of beverage calories for adults.
From 1988­1994 to 1999­2004, daily per capita consumption of
SSBs increased by 46 kcal/d (P , 0.001), and average daily
intake among adults who consumed SSBs increased by 55 kcal/d
(P , 0.001). Alcohol was the second largest source of adult per
capita beverage calories. For other beverage categories, the
percentage of milk drinkers declined most over the period (P ¼
0.045) followed by coffee and tea drinkers (P , 0.001). The per

capita consumption and daily caloric contribution from milk and
coffee or tea remained relatively constant.
Consumption patterns of SSBs and other beverages by sex,
race-ethnicity, and age
Overall, the percentage of SSB drinkers increased significantly
from 58% in 1988­1994 to 63% in 1999­2004 (P , 0.001)
(Table 3). For both sexes and all race-ethnicity groups, young
adults (aged 20­44 y) had the highest percentage of SSB
drinkers in 1988­1994 (68%) and in 1999­2004 (72%), a sig-
nificant upward trend (P ¼ 0.024). The elderly (aged !65 y) had
the lowest percentage at both time points, but it did increase
significantly over the period (P , 0.001). Among the race-
ethnicity groups, young black men had the highest percentage of
SSB drinkers in 1988­1994 (78%) and in 1999­2004 (82%), and
the increase over the period was significant (P , 0.05).
Notable patterns were also observed for diet drinks, milk, and
coffeeortea.Thepercentageofdietdrinkersincreasedsignificantly
among the elderly overall (13­16%; P ¼ 0.032) and elderly whites
(12­16%; P ¼ 0.022). The percentage of milk drinkers declined
most among elderly blacks (57­41%; P , 0.001). Coffee and tea
drinking declined most among young whites (54­48%; P ¼ 0.006)
and young men (51­45%; P ¼ 0.002).
Per capita intake of SSBs by age, sociodemographics,
obesity, and weight-loss intention
PercapitaconsumptionofSSBsanditscorrespondingpercentage
contribution to daily energy intake by age, sociodemographic
groups, weight, and weight-loss intention are shown in Table 4.
Over the period, per capita consumption of SSBs increased signif-
icantly from 158 kcal/d in 1988­1994 to 203 kcal/d in 1999­2004
(P , 0.001) with the biggest increase among young adults. For
adults aged 20­44 y, per capita SSB calories averaged 231 kcal/d
(9% total daily intake) in 1988­1994 and 289 kcal/d (12% total
daily intake) in 1999­2004 (P , 0.001). Among young adults, per
capita consumption of SSBs increased significantly for all de-
mographic, body weight, and weight-loss groups. In 1999­2004,
the caloric contribution of SSBs to overall daily intake was the
highest among young adults with less than a high school education
and among persons with lower income (14%). Among all race-
ethnicity groups, overall per capita consumption was the highest
among blacks. For all ages combined, the increase in per capita
SSB consumption was significant for both sexes and all race-
ethnicity, education, income, weight status, and intention-to-lose-
weight groups (P , 0.05).
The average quantity and caloric contribution among adults
who had !1 consumption occasion of SSBs on the previous day
are given in Table 5. In 1988­1994, daily consumption of SSBs

was highest among obese adults (26 oz). In 1999­2004, daily con-
sumption of SSBs was highest among men (32 oz). From 1988­
1994 to 1999­2004, average daily consumption increased from 22
to 28 oz (P , 0.001), average consumption rose from 239 to 294
kcal/d (P , 0.001), and the average serving size per SSB con-
sumption occasion increased from 11 oz to 17 oz (P , 0.001). For
allgroups, averagedaily consumption and average consumptionper
occasion increased significantly. Not only did more adults drink
SSBs but they also drank more each time they consumed SSBs. In
1999­2004, average consumption per drinking occasion was
highest among males and whites (19 oz). Between the 2 time peri-
ods, the caloriccontribution of SSBs increasedthemost amongmen
(271­338 kcal/d) and persons with lower income (252­319 kcal/d).
Beverage consumption among overweight-obese adults by
weight-loss intention
The beverage consumption patterns among overweight-obese
adults by weight-loss intention are given in Table 6. In both
NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2004, the percentage of over-
weight-obese adults who drank SSBs was significantly lower
among persons with weight-loss intention than for persons with-
out weight-loss intention (P , 0.001). Per capita consumption and
the daily caloric contributions among SSB drinkers followed the
same pattern. SSBs, on average, contributed more per capita
calories to the diet of persons not trying to lose weight than to
persons who did try to lose weight (NHANES III: 178 compared
with 146 kcal/d; P , 0.001; NHANES 1999­2004: 231 compared
with 186 kcal/d; P , 0.001). Likewise, among persons who re-
ported !1 consumption occasion of SSBs on the previous day in
1999­2004, average consumption was significantly higher among
persons without weight-loss intention than among persons trying
to lose weight (313 compared with 278 kcal/d; P , 0.001). Of
note, whereas per capita consumption and the daily caloric con-
tribution from SSBs was lower in both survey periods among
overweight-obese persons trying to lose weight, the consumption
level increased over time, regardless of weight-loss intention,
which is consistent with the trend observed in Table 4.
Reductions in the percentage of overweight-obese SBB
drinkers among adults trying to lose weight were paralleled by
increases in the percentage of diet drinkers among adults with
weight-loss intention. In NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2004,
the percentage of diet drinkers was significantly higher among
overweight-obese persons trying to lose weight than among
persons who were not (P , 0.001).
For other beverage categories, overweight-obese persons with
weight-loss intention consumed less alcohol (NHANES III: 92
compared with 67 kcal/d; P ¼ 0.006) and milk per capita than
persons not trying to lose weight (NHANES III: 97 compared
with 83 kcal/d; P ¼ 0.016; NHANES 1999­2004: 88 compared
with 74 kcal/d; P ¼ 0.018).

'60% of the total. Fruit drinks (which include all fruit punches
and fruit nectars with added sugar) were the second largest
source, representing about a quarter of total SSB calories. The
contribution of soda to overall SSB consumption declined with
age, whereas the contribution of fruit drink increased with age.
Over the survey period, the relative contribution from both soda
and fruit drink increased across all age groups. For example,
soda contributed 61% of all SSB calories in 1999­2004, which
was up from 56% in 1988­94.
DISCUSSION
The 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends
drinks without added sugar (24). Yet, our study shows that SSBs,
which provide little nutritional benefit, represent a considerable
source of total adult daily intake and is the largest source of
beverage calories. In 1999­2004, two-thirds of adults (63%)
drank SSBs, averaging 28 oz/d, 17 oz per consumption occasion,
and 293 calories daily (15% of recommended 2000 kcal/d diet).
More adults are drinking SSBs (primarily soda; '60%), and,

among SSB drinkers, average caloric consumption and quantity
consumed had increased, changes that parallel the rising prev-
alence of adult obesity (2) and type 2 diabetes (29).
An additional key finding is the considerable variation in adult
SSB consumption by sociodemographic characteristics, with the
highest rates concentrated among populations at highest risk of
obesity (2, 3). Overall, SSB consumption declined steeply with
age, which may be partially because of a cohort effect (ie,
younger generations have increased their SSB consumption)
(30). In 1999­2004, young adults had the highest prevalence of
SSB drinkers (72%) and were the highest consumers of SSB
calories (289 kcal/d) compared with older age groups. Among
race-ethnicity groups, blacks had the highest percentage of SSB
drinkers (76%) and the highest per capita consumption of SSBs
(234 kcal/d) in 1999­2004, followed by Mexican Americans.
Among all young adults, the caloric contribution of SSBs was
highest among persons with lower income and persons with less
than a high school education.
Increasingly, US adults are reporting a desire to lose weight
(31). Yet, the extent to which this maps to changes in beverage
consumption is not well known. This study offers useful in-
formation about SSB consumption patterns by weight-loss in-
tention. Our results indicate that overweight-obese adults trying
to lose weight (compared with those without weight-loss in-
tention) are moving in the right direction. In both surveys, the
percentage of SSB drinkers (61% compared with 67%, 1999­
2004) and the amount of SSBs consumed (186 compared with
231 kcal/d, 1999­2004) was lower among overweight-obese
persons with weight-loss intention compared with persons with-
out this intention. This suggests that persons trying to lose weight
are drinking less SSBs and selecting SSBs with lower energy
content. Yet, per capita consumption of SSBs increased among all
weight groups over the period regardless of weight-loss intention.
However, differences between the groups are small, which in-
dicates that greater efforts are needed to empower persons trying
to lose weight to adopt healthy eating behaviors.
Bothsimilaritiesanddifferencesarefoundbetweenourfindings
and previous research. This study is consistent with previous work
thatidentifiedaconsistentupwardtrendincaloriesfromSSBs(5,7,
9­11, 32) and high SSB consumption at home (5). Compared with
trends in US children and adolescents, in whom the percentage of
SSB drinkers remained constant from 1988­1994 to 1999­2004
and in whom per capita caloric consumption of SSB increased
(30), we observed increases inboth thepercentage ofSSB drinkers
and the quantify of SSBs consumed among adults. This study
improves our understanding of adult beverage consumption by
focusing on variations by sociodemographic characteristics,
weight status, and intention to lose weight. Previous studies have
largely focused on overall averages, ignoring the heterogeneity by
subpopulation. The considerable gradient we observe by age, for

example, suggests that prior research focused on the entire adult
populationmay haveunderestimated the energy imbalance among
younger adults.
Our focus on multiple subpopulations makes it possible to
highlight several potential opportunities to reduce overall caloric
intake as well as to identify concerning patterns for future study.
To reduce adult intake of SSBs, the considerable consumption of
SSBs in the workplace, particularly among young adults, sug-
gests that initiatives focused in this area may have a significant
effect. To achieve this goal, one possibility might be to reduce the
standard serving size of SSBs in the workplace (eg, from a 20-oz
bottle to a 12-oz can), given our finding of increased consumption
per drinking occasion. Another might be to reduce the ready
availability of SSBs, which undermines initiatives aimed at re-
ducing consumption, or to replace SSB beverage options with
noncaloric alternatives. This latter strategy has been effective in
adolescents (33). Efforts to reduce SSB consumption in the
workplace, where we found that young adults consume a fifth of
their SSB calories, would complement the growing interest
among employers of investing in health-promotion strategies
(34). An additional approach might be to encourage the current
trend toward decreased SSB consumption among overweight-
obese persons trying to lose weight, an easy and concrete, be-
havioral target that may be best encouraged by physicians and
health care professionals.
In general, strategies that promote reductions in SSB intake
may be easier to attain than strategies that promote increases in
physical activity, given the time trade-off between energy intake
and expenditure. For example, an 85-kg man (187.4 lb) would
need to walk for 50 min (rather than sit) to burn off 1 can (12 oz)
of soda (140 kcal/d).
Additional research is needed to understand the drivers of
increased SSB consumption among subgroups with higher in-
take. For example, the recent Institute of Medicine report that
focused on food marketing to children (35) found that ethnic
minorities living in poorer neighborhoods have fewer healthier
options (36, 37). From a policy perspective, targeted programs
among these subpopulations, promoting reduced consumption of
empty calories, may be useful for reducing the upward trend in
consuming SSBs.
The present study has several limitations. First, our reliance on
single 24-h dietary recalls may introduce inaccuracy and bias to

our analyses because of underreporting, unreliability, and con-
version error. Previous research indicates that adults underreport
their dietary consumption by '25% (38, 39). In addition, re-
strained eating has been associated with underreporting of ca-
loric intake (40). Therefore, the true difference in SSB
consumption between persons with weight-loss intention and
persons not trying to lose weight may be smaller than our results
indicate. However, available evidence does suggest better recall
accuracy with packaged beverage items such as SSBs (41). A
single 24-h dietary recall may not accurately represent usual
dietary intake for a person. Lack of reliability of the dietary
recall for overall eating habits will reduce the precision of our

estimates, but it will not bias our regression estimates when total
energy intake is the dependent variable (42). Inaccuracy exists in
converting reported beverage consumption to energy intake
because the assumptions on serving size and food composition
are defined by the food and nutrient database. This standard
database assumes a representative nutritional content for a given
food or beverage. The inevitable variation in actual intake and
reporting bias may introduce measurement errors, particularly
for the estimation of total energy intake. However, this error is
likely less significant for packaged, standard-sized beverages.
Second, although we used multivariate regression models to
adjust for demographic variables, our inferences on secular
changes and beverage consumption patterns between the 2 sur-
veys may remain constrained by changes in other demographic
variables, but the 2 samples had comparable distributions of sex,
age, employment status, and income status. Third, the NHANES
data are cross-sectional, which only allows us to address asso-
ciations rather than causality. Fourth, the intention-to-lose-
weight question asks respondents about the previous 12 mo,
whereas the 24-h recall focuses on 1 d. Temporal differences may
limit our ability to fully capture eating practices of persons trying
to lose weight. In addition, differences in survey methods between
the 2 study periods (eg, NHANES 1999­2004 used computer-
assisted interviewing for the dietary interview, but NHANES III
did not) may affect the comparability of data overtime.
To conclude, SSB consumption has increased dramatically in
the past decade in the United States, in parallel with the rising
prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Large epidemiologic
studies provide strong evidence for the independent effect of
SSBs on weight gain and type 2 diabetes (1, 4). Efforts to en-
courage replacing SSBs with low-caloric or noncaloric alter-
natives may be an important strategy to reduce consumption of
empty calories. Physicians and public health professionals are
well positioned to identify and promote concrete behavioral
targets aimed at decreasing adult SSB consumption, making
awareness of these changes critical among that group. The
workplace and home offer key areas of intervention for reducing
the energy imbalance in young adults.
