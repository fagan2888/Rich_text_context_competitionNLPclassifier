to Parents and Children: Racial-Ethnic Differences

Objectives. To examine racial-ethnic differences in the allocation of financial transfers to parents, children, and others by
middle-aged couples.
Methods. Multinomial specification of alternative recipients of financial transfers, using data from the 1992 Health and
Retirement Survey.
Results. Transfer patterns are sensitive to parental health and wealth, to children being young or in school, as well as to the
donors' health and wealth. Controlling for these and other factors, including family size and structure, Blacks and Whites are
the most likely, and Hispanics the least likely, tofinanciallyhelp their parents compared to assisting offspring. Black couples
are the most likely to sacrifice their own consumption to assist parents financially.
Discussion. Future research on transfers should attempt to capture unmeasured noneconomic sources of variation proxied
by the race-ethnicity indicator.
RACIAL differences in demographic behaviors across suc-
. cessive generations of family accumulate to produce sub-
sequent variations in family structure. On average, Blacks and
Hispanics have larger extended families than Whites at middle
age because of the formers' higher fertility, shorter mean length
of generation, and lower age at first union (NCHS, 1993). There
are no differences across racial-ethnic groups in the proportions
with offspring at middle age, but Whites are more likely to have
surviving parents. Data from the 1992 Health and Retirement
Survey indicate that among non-institutionalized persons aged
51-61,55% of Blacks and 58% of Hispanics have both living
children and parents, compared to 67% ofWhites.
Despite racial-ethnic differences in family size and the distri-
bution of needs and resources, most prior studies of racial-ethnic
differences in transfer behaviors have focused on time transfers,
usually to elderly parents or to children (McGarry & Schoeni,
1995; Silverstein & Waite, 1993), but not to both simultane-
ously. Lower levels of health (Markides, Radkin, Angel, &
Espino, 1997; Smith & Kington, 1997) andfinancialresources
(Smith, 1995) suggest that there is a greater density of needs
across the generations of Black and Hispanic families but
smaller pools of wealth within a generation. Silverstein and
Waite (1993) show, for example, that Blacks are generally more
involved in family support networks, exchanging affective, in-
strumental, and hands-on care with elderly parents at higher
rates than Whites. Although financial transfers may substitute
for in-kind transfers, low aggregate levels of wealth among
Blacks and Hispanics (Smith, 1995) may deterfinancialgiving
across generations of the extended family. Nonetheless, the ex-
tent of financial needs within the kin group may increase the
likelihood of Blacks and Hispanics providing financial assis-
tance, even if the absolute amounts are small.
At all ages and across various populations, resources over-
whelminglyflowfrom parents to offspring (Lee, 1997; McGarry
& Schoeni, 1995), although the type of assistance parents pro-
vide varies with age of donor. Researchers have examined trans-
fers from parents to children separately from flows in the other
direction (McGarry & Schoeni, 1995). Thus, we know little
about the potential trade-offs, the constraints, or the process by
which middle-aged persons decide to allocate inter-vivos re-
sources between elderly parents and their children, or racial and
ethnic differences in how couples balance claims from their chil-
dren against those from parents. This article examines how mid-
dle-aged couples allocate their household financial resources
among competing claims from their parents and offspring and
emphasizes racial-ethnic differences in these behaviors. For this
purpose, we define three categories based on self-reports of sur-
vey respondents from the 1992 Health and Retirement Study:
Hispanic, (non-Hispanic) White, and (non-Hispanic) Black.
Social science research based on categories defined by race or
ethnicity can be misleading because discrete groupings mask a
host of socioeconomic and cultural factors, with each category
representing a heterogeneous subgroup within the population
(Bhopal & Donaldson, 1998; Fullilove, 1998). Although respon-
dent reports of race and ethnicity lack a clear genetic basis, they
convey important aspects of self-identity and social orientation
in an increasingly diverse population. We incorporate in our
models a range of socioeconomic indicators and measures of
potential sources of cultural diversity. In addition, we include the
race-ethnicity category as a proxy for unobserved differences in
resources and preferences for assisting family members.
Conceptual Framework and Hypotheses
Intergenerational transfer systems are complex, involving
flows in two directions at a point in time, in at least three cur-
rencies (space, time, and money) across three or more genera-
tions. This article is a building block toward implementing such
an approach, and addresses the issue of multiple generations
competing for scarcefinancialresources. We examine the mid-
dle-aged generation in its donor role, with their children and
S145
S146 WONGETAL.
parents as potential recipients, in the currency of money. The
strategy can be partly justified because individuals aged 51 to
61 represent the majority of givers among the generations, and
only a small proportion of this age group receive assistance
from parents (Soldo & Hill, 1995).
From the perspective of middle-aged adults, the well-being
of parents and children is desirable and contributions of re-
sources may be needed in order to secure it. These resources
may be investments in human capital for future pay-off (Pollak,
1995), from which the donor may or may not benefit directly,
or repayment for previous services or favors received (Stark,
1995). At any given time, middle-aged individuals may derive
satisfaction from the welfare of their parents and their children,
but also from assisting other potential recipients (e.g., other rel-
atives, friends, religious or charitable organizations) and their
own consumption.
The model includes only the needs and constraints that can be
observed in a cross-section of middle-aged individuals at risk of
balancing needs of parents and offspring. The model assumes
that financial transfers respond to short-term needs and con-
straints. From the perspective of the middle-aged adult, transfers
of a scarce resource will be made to one generation instead of
another if this option yields greater returns in terms of satisfac-
tion. The behavior of the middle-aged generation is governed by
the preferences towards the welfare of all potential recipients,
but is constrained by their ability to provide transfers and the rel-
ative need of the potential recipients. For example, a financial
transfer to a recipient who is impoverished or suffered an eco-
nomic shock, such as the loss of a job, is likely to result in a
larger welfare gain for the recipient than a transfer when an oth-
erwise comparable recipient has higher levels of wealth. A fi-
nancial transfer when the donor is poor results in a larger loss
for the donor than a transfer when the donor is relatively well-
off. Finally, holding all else constant, a donor will allocate re-
sources to their own consumption, non-relatives, or charities if
such giving conveys higher levels of satisfaction for the donor,
perhaps because of public recognition, status, or the gratitude of
others. Thus the transfer behavior depends on attributes of both
the donor and thepotential recipients, and factors measuring the
relative preferences of the donor. The factors measuring the rela-
tive preferences of donors are those capturing cultural beliefs,
religious attachment, strength of kin ties, and kin obligation.
Drawing on earlier work of Behrman, Pollak, and Taubman
(1995), we hypothesize that middle-aged donors will favor their
children over their parents in allocating financial assistance
(DaVanzo & Goldscheider, 1990; Hogan, Eggebeen, & Clogg,
1993; Rosenzweig & Wolpin, 1993). Donors may perceive a
higher responsibility towards the immediate welfare of their
children rather than their parents. Parents have a responsibility
to children from birth; at least in part this obligation carries the
force of law as well as norms. In contrast, the private social
contract governing the obligation of adult children to parents is
poorly defined (Soldo & Freedman, 1994; Soldo & Hill, 1995)
and generally unenforceable.
We hypothesize also that the gap between the propensities to
assist children and parents will be smaller for Blacks and
Hispanics than for Whites because of unmeasured factors af-
fecting transfer behaviors that correlate with racial and ethnic
identity. Regardless of wealth, minority families may have
stronger kin ties because of a history of exclusion from the
dominant culture and its social institutions (see Silverstein &
Waite, 1993, and references therein). The culture of family re-
liance may have its origins in labor market experiences (often
characterized by marginal employment, low wages, and spells
of unemployment) that reduce eligibility for private pension
plans, and limit access to institutional mechanisms, such as
credit, to meet consumption needs in middle and late life
(O'Rand, 1996). Enhanced dependence on family networks
may be reinforced across generations, so that regardless of so-
cioeconomic status or intergenerational social mobility, middle-
aged Blacks and Hispanics may be more likely than Whites to
assist parents relative to children.
In addition, we expect that the relative differences in the odds
of assisting parents versus children will be smaller for
Hispanics than Whites, in part because of their histories of mi-
gration. Language barriers or fear of interacting with formal
markets in a new country, may yield a fairly sequestered sub-
culture (Currie, 1996). For migrants from Mexico and other
Central American countries, there is no tradition of relying on
either government assistance or private lending institutions,
even for long-term borrowing such as home mortgages. If the
parents of Hispanics reside outside the United States, the finan-
cial transfers from adult children may be part of the unwritten
remittance contract (Lozano-Ascencio, 1993). Thus the unique
Hispanic experience in the United States may produce a culture
in which family support towards elderly parents is expected.
In summary, this article tests the following hypotheses: (1)
middle-aged couples will favor their children over their parents
in allocatingfinancialassistance, regardless of race or ethnicity;
and (2) holding all else constant, the gap between the propen-
sity to assist parents and children will be smaller for both
Hispanics and Blacks than for Whites.
METHODS
Data
The data for the analysis are from Wave 1 (1992) of the
Health and Retirement Study (HRS). This survey collects de-
tailed information from non-institutionalized persons born be-
tween 1931 and 1941 and their spouses regardless of age (Juster
& Suzman, 1995). The HRS design provides for oversamples
of more than 2,000 African Americans and 1,200 Hispanics
(Jackson, Lockery, & Juster, 1996).
Our main objective is to examine the giving behavior of re-
spondents towards their parents in contrast to their children, and
the trade-offs made to accommodate both generations of the
family. We ask howfinancialresources are allocated among the
set of potential recipients: children, parents, religious or charity
organizations, or others. Charities and others are included as po-
tential recipients to exhaust the transfer options a donor con-
fronts. Our analysis sample includes only HRS respondents who
report themselves to be married or partnered (i.e., couples) with
at least one child and one living parent of either spouse/partner.
About 71% of couples in the HRS meet these criteria. We treat
the couple as the unit of analysis because we view the couple as
ajoint production unit who jointly determine consumption, sav-
ings, and contributions to the welfare of their kin. Our results
can be generalized only to middle-aged couples (married or part-
nered) with at least one child and parent, although the odds of
being part of a couple varies across racial-ethnic groups. Among
FINANCIALASSISTANCE: RACIAL DIFFERENCES S147
HRS-1 households, Blacks are appreciably less likely to have a
spouse or partner (49%) than Hispanics (67%) or Whites (75%).
Among the subset who have both living parents and children,
Blacks are less likely to be part of a couple (69%) compared
with Hispanics (80%) or Whites (87%).
We treat the set of children as a potential transfer unit and the
set of parents as a unit (i.e., we make no distinction between bi-
ological and stepchildren or parents of one spouse or the other).
We further limit our sample to couples in which at least one of
the spouses is Hispanic, non-Hispanic White, or non-Hispanic
Black; we exclude 44 couples who identify themselves as be-
longing to other race-ethnic groups. If the race-ethnicity of the
woman differs from that declared by her male partner, we clas-
sify the couple as being of mixed race-ethnicity. Of the 3,185
couples who meet these criteria, 52 additional couples were ex-
cluded because of missing data, resulting in a final analysis
sample of 3,133 couples. Among these, 75% are White, 11%
Black, 7% Hispanic, and 7% of mixed race or ethnicity. Among
Hispanic couples, at least one of the spouses is of Mexican ori-
gin or background in 70% of the cases.
MEASURES
We derive five mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories
to construct our dependent variable of transfer behaviors.
Couples were classified in terms of whether they provide finan-
cial help to anyone, and if so, by type of recipient. This classifi-
cation yields afive-foldtypology of financial transfer options:
assisting children but not parents; parents but not children; chil-
dren and parents; religious or charity organizations, or others,
but not children or parents; and a residual category of assisting
no one. For simplicity, we refer to these categories as giving fi-
nancial assistance to "children-only," "parents-only," "both chil-
dren and parents," "charity," and "no one." We interpret this last
category as the donor's propensity to allocate resources to their
own consumption, either current or future (savings).
Couples were asked if they gave financial help to parents or
children of either spouse totaling $500 or more in the previous
12 months, excluding shared housing and food. Financial assis-
tance to elderly parents includes unrestricted cash transfers,
help with paying bills, and assistance to cover specific costs
such as those for nursing care, medical or insurance expenses,
or rent. Financial assistance to children refers tofinancialassis-
tance of $500 or more in the past 12 months, and it includes un-
restricted cash transfers, help paying bills, or expenses such as
insurance, schooling, or housing expenses. Religious or charita-
ble contributions refer to donations of money, property, or pos-
sessions valued at $500 or more in the previous year. In addi-
tion, couples were asked if they gave any money in 1991 toward
the support of anyone who was not living with the couple.
A disproportionately high percentage of donor couples assisting
only children are White, but Whites represent a low proportion
among those helping only their parents. We use household weights
to estimate the distribution of donor couples in each category of re-
cipient (not shown). Among those assisting children only, 86.5%
are White, whereas 4.1 % are Black and 2.7% Hispanic. Among
those favoring only their parents, however, 61.6% are White, com-
pared with 9.0% Black and 16.8% Hispanic.
The explanatory variables include indicators of the couple's
relative preferences, the couple's ability to provide transfers,
and the potential claims of their children and parents. A detailed
list of variables and their definition is provided in Table 1. Our
measures for the ability of the couple to providefinancialtrans-
fers include the total net worth of the couple, entered in loga-
rithmic form with a linear spline (knot at zero). Hence the
model has two terms to capture the effect of the natural log of
net worth. We include whether one of the spouses has a major
chronic disease (cancer, heart disease, and/or stroke) that may
erode theirfinancialwell-being either because of current medi-
cal expenditures or concern for the survivor's estate. We also in-
clude a measure of whether either spouse thought it unlikely to
survive after age 75. This subjective probability (Hurd &
McGarry, 1995) measure is intended to capture the extent to
which the expected length of life affects the propensity to pro-
vide transfers. If donors expect to survive a relatively short time,
they may be more generous, although concerns for the welfare
of the surviving spouse may mitigate against this effect. We
also include measures of the education of each spouse, which
captures not only the aggregate human capital of the couple,
but may determine strong preferences for investing in human
capital of offspring. These measures also may capture the long-
term effect of education on cumulative wealth of the couple.
As attributes of the children we include five variables: the
number of children aged 18 and older who may have situational
needs (e.g., not working), the number of dependent children
(under 18 and coresident), the number of children older than 18
in school, the number of children older than 18 who do not own
a home, and the total number of all children. As attributes of the
parents we include measures of the size of the pool of potential
parental recipients. Other variables indicate whether a wife's or
a husband's parent(s) is frail. Parental frailty is expected to
prompt financial help from middle-aged couples because out-
of-pocket medical expenses are often substantial, even for costs
partly covered by Medicare (Moon & Malva, 1995).
One of the critical explanatory variables in our model is
parental wealth. This variable captures the ability of the parents
to meet their own consumption, including health care needs.
HRS respondents did not directly estimate parental wealth. We
impute this for cases in which the parent(s) reside in the United
States, and construct separate (imputed) measures of the net
worth of the wife's parents and the husband's parents. The im-
putation equations were estimated using an auxiliary data set,
the 1993-94 Asset and Health Dynamics Survey (AHEAD). We
use detailed information on AHEAD cohorts, who are quite lit-
erally the parental generation of the HRS cohort, to emulate the
distribution of wealth among the parents of age-eligible HRS re-
spondents, and to construct an appropriate shadow sample from
which we impute the wealth of the actual parents of the HRS
couples. Dummy variables indicate quartiles of parental wealth.
We estimate the model of financial transfers using five sets of
imputed parental wealth values, and obtain final estimates cor-
rected for imputation, using the techniques described by Rubin
(1987) and Freedman and Wolf (1995). Details of the imputa-
tion procedure are available from the authors.
An important attribute of the children and parents is whether
these kin receive public transfers such as welfare payments, sup-
plemental security income, or unemployment benefits. Such data
were not obtained in the HRS but to take this into account, we use
proxy measures of the wealth of the potential recipients. For par-
ents, we impute the parental wealth directly. For children, we use
measures that capture their relative deprivation, such as lack of

Note: "The multinomial logit model also includes: interactions of husband's (wife's) number of siblings and whether the husband's (wife's) parent is frail or needs

tion is missing; and whether couple's perceived likelihood to live beyond age 75 is missing.
The multinomial logit model includes the couple's number of children with the attribute.
The variable in the multinomial logit is defined only if the parent is living. Otherwise, the variable takes the value 0.

home ownership, or situational need, such as unemployment. In
order to avoid endogeneity with the outcome variable (monetary
transfers), other transfer currencies, other types of transfers (pub-
lic), and proximity to kin are not included as right-hand side vari-
ables. This approach essentially defines a reduced-form approach.
Among the covariates tapping cultural differences, the model
includes measures of the nativity of each spouse, time since im-
migration for foreign-born respondents, familiarity with English,
religiosity; and whether the couple lives outside an urban area as
well as self-reported race-ethnicity. Holding all else constant, we
would expect that foreign-born persons, more recent immigrants,
and those not fluent in English would be more inclined to pro-
vide financial assistance to kin of any kind, even at the expense
of own consumption. Similarly, those with strong religious tradi-
tions have stronger norms of familial altruism, independent of
their capacity to give or the perceived needs of their relatives. We
also include a measure of whether either spouse has received a
substantial financial gift ($ 10,000 or more) in the past, to capture
a sense of reciprocity or tradition of giving within the family
(Stark, 1995). In addition to the socioeconomic indicators and
measures of cultural diversity, the model includes the race-ethnic-
ity categories as proxy for unobserved factors, as well as interac-
tions of race-ethnicity with total number of children.
Analysis
The dependent variable represents a set of mutually exclu-
sive choices of recipients that are unordered. We estimate the
model using a multinomial logit specification, and use a
Hausman test to evaluate the assumption of independence of ir-
relevant alternatives (IIA) following Greene (1993). We fail to
reject the equality between the coefficients of the full model
and the coefficients of the models excluding each alternative (p
values of 1.0). Thus, we find evidence that the IIA assumption
is appropriate for our data, and use the multinomial coefficients
to calculate the relative risk ratio (RRR) of outcome m with re-
spect to outcome n for Blacks versus Whites and Hispanics ver-
sus Whites, holding all else constant. For example, the RRR for
Blacks relative to Whites, conditional on the vector of explana-
tory variables X, is given by the expression:
~ CXp >
Odds(m/n)(X,Blacks)
Odds(m/n)(X, Whites) ~_CXp >TM [
- e X P \Pblack, mM)
Testing the null hypothesis that the RRR's equal unity allows
us to address the question of whether the differences in the odds
of outcome m, say giving only to parents, relative to the odds of
outcome n, say giving only to children, is statistically signifi-
cant between any two groups, say between Blacks and Whites.
The RRR has the advantage that it does not depend on the spe-
cific values of the explanatory variables, and is insensitive to
the absolute magnitude of the estimated probability of choosing
any alternative (Long, 1997). Comparisons across racial-ethnic
groups using the RRR's allow us to contrast the probability of
one outcome over another rather than variation in the probabil-
ity of a single outcome across groups.
RESULTS
Financial Assistance to Children and Parents
Table 2 shows the structure of intergenerational families in
which the middle-aged married or partnered couple have at
least one child and one or more surviving parents. There are
distinct racial-ethnic differences in the size and composition of
the pool of kin with potential claims on the resources of mid-
dle-aged donors. Hispanics have more offspring, on average,
than comparably aged Black and White couples. About two out
of five Hispanic couples, for example, have five or more chil-
dren, compared to 35% of Blacks and only 21% of middle-aged
White couples. White and Hispanic couples are more likely
than comparable Black couples to have living parents on both
sides of the family (36% of Whites and Hispanics compared to
29% of Blacks). Overall, middle-aged Hispanic couples are
more likely to be sandwiched between large families of procre-
ation (three or more children) and origin of both the husband
and wife (27.2% of Hispanics vs 21.4% and 20.6% for Whites
and Blacks, respectively).
Table 1, discussed previously, also shows the distribution of
attributes of sampled couples and their offspring and living par-
ents by race-ethnicity. There is greater diversity and concentra-
tion of need in Hispanic families than within Black and White
families. Hispanics and Blacks (22% and 32%, respectively)
are more likely than Whites (13%) to have at least one child
younger than age 18 who is presumably dependent on the refer-
ence generation. Hispanics also are more likely to have at least
one child aged 18 or older still in school, and at least one parent
who requires personal care or supervision.
The resource base of middle-aged Blacks and Hispanics is
more constrained and their health, poorer on average, than that
of White couples. Hispanics have much lower levels of educa-
tion than Blacks or Whites, and their median net worth of cou-
ples with both children and surviving parents is appreciably
lower ($42,000 for Hispanic, $155,000 for White, and $53,000
for Black couples). Non-Hispanic couples, however, are more
likely to report that one or another spouse/partner is chronically
ill (about 33% vs 20% among Hispanics).

The raw prevalence estimates of transfers are consistent with
previous reports using other nationally representative data: giv-
ing to children dominates the flow of resources across genera-
tions of all families. Even in comparison to contributions to
charities, financial assistance to parents is rare. For the total
sample of couples (not shown), nearly two fifths gave financial
assistance only to their children, and one fifth make financial
contributions to only charity. About 30% provide assistance to
no one; 4.5% make financial transfers only to parents and an-
other 8% help both children and parents.
There are important racial differences in transfer patterns as
well. White couples are more likely to report giving assistance
only to children (42%) than Blacks or Hispanics (29% and 21%,
respectively). Whites, however, are less likely (3%) to assist only
their parents than either Blacks (6%) or Hispanics (12%),
whereas Hispanics are less likely to contribute to charity (12%),
compared to Whites (20%) and Blacks (24%). Consistent with
racial-ethnic differences in wealth, Whites report overall larger
gifts among those who madefinancialtransfers exceeding $500.
Among couples who gave assistance to a particular type of re-
cipient, the largest gifts benefit children, whereas contributions
to charity and to parents are roughly of similar magnitude.
Whites gave a median annual transfer to children of $3,000 com-
pared to $1,500 for Blacks and Hispanics. Help to parents has a
median value of $1,200 for Whites, $960 for Blacks, and $700
for Hispanics. Gifts to religious organizations, charities, or oth-
ers have a median of $1,200 for Whites, compared to $1,000 for
Blacks, and $660 for Hispanics.
These descriptive data suggest distinct racial-ethnic differ-
ences in four aspects of financial giving. First, the sheer num-
bers of living children and parents indicate potentially greater
pressure on the resources of middle-aged Black and Hispanic
couples than those of Whites. Second, children and parents of
Hispanics and Blacks are more disadvantaged in socioeco-
nomic resources and health status than Whites, suggesting more
potential claims on thefinancialresources of middle-aged cou-
ples. Third, potential donor couples who are Hispanic and
Black have fewer socioeconomic resources than Whites, sug-
gesting that minority couples are less able to respond to de-
mands on their resources from children and parents. Fourth, the
observed (unadjusted) allocation of assistance from middle-
aged couples varies across the three racial-ethnic groups.
Whites are the most likely to assist only their children;
Hispanics, the most likely to assist only their parents and the
least likely to contribute to charities.
Multivariate Models ofAssistance
The multinomial logit coefficients are presented in Table 3
for the five-outcomes model and are discussed briefly to con-
serve space. The table presents the estimates averaged over the
five multiple imputes of parental wealth, and the significance
reported corresponds to the average coefficient. Overall, the
multivariate results indicate that the socioeconomic covariates
as well as those capturing cultural differences are important for
explaining the allocation of financial transfers by middle-aged
couples. Assistance to parents is highly responsive to parental
wealth and health and negatively related to children being
young or in school. The odds of assisting only parents relative
to helping only children increase if the wife's parent(s) is frail.
The odds decline significantly if the husband's parents are
wealthy, if the couple has adult children in school, and if the
couple received a largefinancialgift in the past.
Assisting parents and children is negatively associated with
parental wealth, positively with parental frailty and the donors'
wealth, and with variables capturing cultural differences. The
odds of assisting bothparents and children compared to finan-
cially assisting only children increase when the wife's or the
husband's parent(s) is sick, at higher levels of wealth of the
couple, and if the wife is foreign-born. The odds decline, how-
ever, if the husband's or wife's parent(s) is wealthy, or if the
middle-aged couple previously received a largefinancialgift.
Giving to charity or religious organizations by middle-aged
couples is influenced by cultural factors, including religiosity
and English languagefluency,and whether children have com-
peting claims. The couples' propensity to provide for their own
consumption rather than financially assist children varies with
offspring needs, own wealth, parental wealth, and cultural fac-
tors. The odds of financially helping no one rather than assist-
ing children decrease with wealth of the couple but increase if
no adult children are in school, among other factors.
The multivariate results also show that, holding all else con-
stant--including other cultural covariates--the allocation of fi-
nancial transfers is associated with race and ethnicity. We use
the multinomial estimates to derive relative risk ratios (RRR)
for Blacks compared to Whites, and Hispanics compared to
Whites (Long, 1997). The RRR's are presented in Table 4, in
which the odds of giving only to children is fixed at 1.00, al-
though any category could have been chosen as the reference
without changing the substantive conclusions. The RRR be-
tween any other two alternatives can be obtained from those
shown in Table 4. The relative risk of assisting only parents
over helping no one, for example, is 2.71 times greater for
Blacks than Whites (1.57/0.58 = 2.71).
The first row of Table 4 indicates that, in relative terms,
Blacks are more likely than Whites to give only to children.
The odds of assisting both children and parents (0.96), charities
(0.84), or no one (0.58), relative to assisting only children are
significantly lower for Blacks than they are for Whites. We in-
terpret a propensity to assist no one as the donors' allocation of
financial resources towards their own consumption. Adjusting
for all other factors, including education and wealth, Blacks are
more likely than Whites to allocate resources to their parents
rather than their own consumption. Both Blacks and Whites,
however, favor giving only to children or parents equally in rel-
ative terms: the odds ratio of assisting children over parents is
similar for both groups.
The second row of Table 4 shows Hispanic-White contrasts
in the relative risk of choosing other types of transfer options
compared with assisting only children, holding all else con-
stant. Relative to White couples, Hispanics have only two thirds
(.65) the odds of preferring their parents over their own chil-
dren. Hispanics are no more likely than Whites to prefer chari-
table giving or own consumption over assisting their children.
Hispanics, however, are less likely than Whites to provide for
their parents at the expense of their own consumption.
We hypothesized previously that all race-ethnic groups favor
transfers to their children over their parents. Although the unad-
justed probabilities are consistent with this prediction, a more
complex picture emerges after controlling for donor and poten-
tial recipient traits. Attributes that represent claims from both

DISCUSSION
This article examines differences across racial-ethnic groups in
how middle-aged couples allocate financial resources among
competing claims from younger and older kin. Behavioral differ-
ences are revealed which yield valuable insights into the culture of
giving in three-generation families and racial-ethnic differences
therein. Our analyses indicate that children are favored as recipi-
ents of financial assistance but that circumstances in which both
children and elderly parents compete for financial resources di-
rectly affect inter-vivos giving among middle-aged couples. Our
findings also indicate that patterns of financial assistance to kin re-
flect both socioeconomic conditions within a family and cultural
differences: the unadjusted differences across racial-ethnic groups
are markedly different from those revealed by the adjusted analy-
sis. Most notably, the unadjusted analysis indicates mat Hispanic
donors are more likely than other ethnic or racial groups to assist
only parents, whereas holding all else constant, Hispanic donors
are the least likely to assist parents in comparison to Blacks or
Whites. Multivariate controls include wealth of both potential re-
cipients and donors, as well as indicators of the donors' accultura-
tion and differential filial or religious obligations. After controlling
for these and other factors, racial/ethnic self-identity is still signifi-
cant in explainingfinancialtransfer behaviors. We interpret this to
mean that there are unmeasured sources of variation, correlated
with racial-ethnic self-identity, which explain differences in ob-
served transfer behaviors. Furthermore, our results suggest that
there are three distinct patterns of giving represented by the three
racial-ethnic groups we consider. Although Blacks and Hispanics
share many socioeconomic disadvantages, middle-aged couples
in these two groups have distinct patterns of allocating financial
assistance to family and others.
In balancing the demands of children and parents, we find
that Black middle-aged couples are more likely than Whites to
assist only their children or only their parents rather than con-
tribute to their own consumption. Hispanics more than Whites
favor their own consumption over helping only their parents.
These results suggest that among the three racial-ethnic groups
we have considered, Blacks and Whites are the most likely--
and Hispanics the least likely--to financially favor assisting
their parents compared with assisting their children. In addition,
Blacks are the most likely to sacrifice their own consumption to
financially help parents, and Hispanics, the least likely. Shifts in
the generational distribution of demands because of market
forces (e.g., increased rates of unemployment) or public policy
initiatives (e.g., decreasing Social Security benefits for elderly
parents) may reduce savings and/or consumption by middle-
aged couples. Black families would be more likely to feel such
effects, all else being equal.
Limitations of the study need to be considered. The HRS
baseline used a $500 threshold to identify households that made
non-trivial annual financial transfers. McGarry and Schoeni
(1995) have examined possible biases associated with this cen-
sor. They argue that respondents may inflate their actual trans-
fers to children largely because of the perceived social desir-
ability of giving to offspring. Transfers to parents would be less
affected by respondent overstatement. Poor families also may
be underrepresented in studies of transfer behaviors because of
the relatively high threshold. If correct, these arguments would
imply that the estimated probability of giving to children would
overstate the "true" probability in the current sample of couples
with children and parents. Estimated probabilities of assisting
parents would be largely unaffected. The primary implications
of McGarry and Schoeni's (1995) arguments would center on
the racial-ethnic contrasts between giving to offspring relative
to giving to parents. This contrast was not significant in the
Black-White comparison, but significant for Hispanic versus
White (Table 4) but not in the direction McGarry and Schoeni's
analysis would suggest.
It is possible that among Hispanics the patterns of assisting
parents reflect the distance--physical or cultural--separating
middle-aged couples from their parents. It is also possible that
closer family ties among Hispanics are manifest through time-
transfers or coresidence rather thanfinancialtransfers. Middle-
aged couples in our sample, however, do not seem to substitute
hours of parent care for financial transfers. Among couples in
which at least one parent is frail, the percentage providing hours
of care is higher among those who also provide financial help
(28%) than among those who do not give financial assistance
(10.3%). In addition, coresidence with parents is extremely
rare; only 2.8% of couples live with a parent of either spouse.
Another limitation of our analysis on giving behavior is that
the results apply only to middle-aged couples; there are racial-
ethnic differences in the propensity to be legally married or part-
nered. Black respondents are less likely to be part of a couple
than Hispanics orWhites. These self-selected subsets of individ-
uals have higher socioeconomic profiles than the overall Black
population. Our results indicate mat this middle-aged group of
Black couples protect their kin rather than their own consump-
tion. For all middle-aged couples an unanswered question is
how their own post-retirement wealth will be affected by the fi-
nancial pressures from younger and older kin in middle age.
Controlling for socioeconomic factors (such as wealth, edu-
cation, family size, and structure), health, and cultural factors
(such as religion, nativity, language), the discrete demographic
characterization of race-ethnicity retains statistical significance
in a model of family allocation across generational lines. To in-
form the sources of these racial-ethnic differences, further re-
search needs to refine measurement of the factors that we in-
cluded in our model, and make explicit those that are
unmeasured. In addition to identifying unmeasured factors prox-
ied by the race-ethnicity categories, which can be as amorphous
FINANCIALASSISTANCE: RACIAL DIFFERENCES S153
as a "culture of giving" crossing generational lines, or as specific
as restricted access to health care services, future research on
private inter-vivos transfers should aim to incorporate better
measures of the availability of public transfers among potential
recipients. We were able to partially take the latter into account
by including a proxy for the recipient's wealth, but this approach
specifies neither eligibility for nor receipt of public benefits.
