Article
In present-day Japan, the word kawaii prevails in every
scene, including fashion, advertisements, and product
designs. The word and the phenomenon have often been
regarded as a representative of Japanese pop culture (Botz-
Bornstein, 2011; Kinsella, 1995; Okazaki & Johnson, 2013;
Yomota, 2006). Because various stimuli are expressed as
kawaii, it is difficult to define what kawaii is in general. The
word is often translated into English as cute. However, the
two words seem to differ in nuance. Specifically, cuteness
has been regarded as synonymous with infant physical attrac-
tiveness (Hildebrandt, 1983; Karraker & Stern, 1990),
whereas kawaii is used more widely referring to broader cat-
egories of stimuli that do not necessarily have infantile fea-
tures. Because the word and the culture of kawaii are getting
known in the world and because more and more researchers
are involved in the research on cuteness and use the term
kawaii in their articles (e.g., Buckley, 2016; Dale, Goggin,
Leyda, McIntyre, & Negra, 2017; Kringelbach, Stark,
Alexander, Bornstein, & Stein, 2016), it is important to
explain the commonalities and differences between cute (in a
classical sense) and kawaii. Although the word kawaii is
originally an adjective, we used it as a noun in this article.
Previous studies regarding cuteness have revolved around
the concept of Kindchenschema (Lorenz, 1943). As an ethol-
ogist, he conceived that there is an innate releasing mecha-
nism that makes humans feel cute and promotes nurturing
and protection behaviors in response to particular stimuli.
Baby schema is the physical characteristics that are typically
possessed by young animals and babies, such as a large head
compared with the body, a rounded body shape, and a soft
body surface. Empirical studies have shown that infant faces
with higher baby schemas are perceived to be cuter (Alley,
1981; Glocker et al., 2009a; Little, 2012; Lobmaier,
Sprengelmeyer, Wiffen, & Perrett, 2010; Sprengelmeyer
et al., 2009), are viewed for a longer period (Parsons, Young,
Kumari, Stein, & Kringelbach, 2011; Sprengelmeyer, Lewis,
Hahn, & Perrett, 2013) even by 3- to 6-year-old children
(Borgi, Cogliati-Dezza, Brelsford, Meints, & Cirulli, 2014),
activate brain areas related to reward and emotional process-
ing such as the nucleus accumbens and amygdala (Glocker
et al., 2009b; Zebrowitz, Luevano, Bronstad, & Aharon,
2009), and increase the motivation for caregiving (Alley,
1983a, 1983b; Glocker et al., 2009a). Moreover, industrial
products (e.g., cars) with baby schema are evaluated to be
cuter (Miesler, Leder, & Herrmann, 2011; see Cheok &

Psychophysiological Responses to Kawaii
Pictures With or Without Baby Schema
Hiroshi Nittono1 and Namiha Ihara2
Abstract
Baby schema has been considered a key stimulus that triggers feelings and thoughts of cuteness. Kawaii is a Japanese word that
roughly translates to cute in English, but its meaning appears to be broader than cute. Specifically, cuteness is often regarded
as synonymous with infant physical attractiveness, whereas kawaii is used not only for babies but also for noninfantile objects.
In this study, psychophysiological responses were compared between two types of kawaii pictures: human babies and animals
(kawaii with baby schema) or objects such as desserts and dress accessories (kawaii without baby schema). Twenty female
university students were asked to view various pictures twice. Both types of kawaii pictures were rated to be more pleasant
than neutral pictures, elicited a greater activation of the zygomaticus major muscles associated with smiling, and were viewed
for a longer period when the same pictures were presented again. The effect of baby schema appeared in the zygomaticus
major muscle activity, which was greater for pictures with baby schema. The findings suggest that the word kawaii expresses
positive feelings that are more generic than infant attractiveness and that are associated with a motivation to approach a
preferable object.

Fernando, 2012, for its application to interactive media).
Although a few exceptions exist (e.g., Nenkov & Scott,
2014), previous research on cuteness has mainly dealt with
babies or infant-related features (see Kringelbach et al.,
2016, for a recent review). As the Japanese word kawaii is
often used to refer to such objects, cute and kawaii have a
similar meaning in this respect.
However, there are other types of stimuli that are referred
to as kawaii but are not directly related to babies. Ihara and
Nittono (2011; see also Nittono, 2016) conducted a survey
on 166 university students about 93 animate and inanimate
objects (expressed in either words or short phrases) that
were sometimes described as kawaii. Half of the raters were
asked to judge the degree of kawaii of each item on a 5-point
scale, whereas the other half judged the infantility of the
stimuli. As a whole, a moderate positive correlation was
found between the mean rating scores of kawaii and infantil-
ity across the 93 items (r = .50). However, items also existed
that were high in kawaii and low in infantility (e.g., smile,
cheerful person, flower, dessert, and dress accessory). In a
second study, Ihara and Nittono (2012; see also Nittono,
2016) searched for common psychological factors in the
feelings toward various stimuli that are often referred to as
kawaii. Japanese university students (N = 180) were asked
to imagine a scene in which they encountered each of the
four types of kawaii stimuli: those with baby schema (e.g.,
babies, stuffed animals), humans (e.g., smiling, cheerful
person), nonliving objects (e.g., desserts, accessories), and
idiosyncratic objects that are not usually described as kawaii
although the respondents personally feel them to be kawaii
(e.g., lizards, mushrooms). They then rated their feelings
and thoughts on six 5-point scales: two adjectives (kawaii,
infantile), two scales of approach motivation (I want to be
closer to it, I want to keep it nearby), and two scales of nur-
turance motivation (I want to help it when it is in trouble, I
want to protect it). Results showed that the profiles of the
six rating scores differed in shape significantly across the
four types of kawaii, which suggests that psychological
states associated with these kawaii stimuli differ. However,
partial correlation analyses revealed that higher kawaii rat-
ings were associated with a greater approach motivation, but
not with a greater nurturance motivation, for all types of
kawaii. This finding is inconsistent with the baby schema
hypothesis, which implies that the feelings of kawaii are
linked with caregiving and protection. Rather, the feelings
of kawaii are related to a strong approach motivation to
interact with the stimulus.
In this exploratory study, we compare psychophysiolog-
ical responses with kawaii stimuli with baby schema (e.g.,
babies, infants), which are typical examples of cute stimuli,
and kawaii stimuli without baby schema (e.g., desserts,
accessories), which are less well studied, to understand the
feelings of kawaii more extensively. Because these pictures
can be regarded as affective stimuli, we recorded psycho-
physiological responses to these pictures by following a
standard research protocol of affective picture processing
(Lang, Greenwald, Bradley, & Hamm, 1993). Subjective
ratings (pleasant, unpleasant, arousing, kawaii, infantile,
and I want to approach), facial electromyograms (EMGs),
skin conductance response (SCR), and viewing duration
were recorded.
Field observation studies have shown that babies and
infants make us smile and move us to approach them
(Nishiyama, Oishi, & Saito, 2015; Schleidt, Schiefenhovel,
Stanjek, & Krell, 1980). When a facial EMG is recorded in
laboratory studies, pictures of babies elevate the activity of
the zygomaticus major muscles, which are associated with
smiling (Bradley, Codispoti, Cuthbert, & Lang, 2001;
Hildebrandt & Fitzgerald, 1978; Lang et al., 1993). The
effect is not limited to living things. Miesler et al. (2011)
manipulated the front designs of cars to enhance baby schema
features (e.g., enlarging the headlights [eyes] and shrinking
the middle grill [nose]) and asked participants to judge the
attractiveness and cuteness of the objects. When the partici-
pants rated cuteness (but not when they rated attractiveness),
baby-faced car fronts induced a higher level of zygomaticus
major muscle activity. Another measure, viewing duration,
also varies with cuteness. Viewing duration has been shown
to increase for novel stimuli (Berlyne, 1960; Silvia, 2006)
and for high-arousal positive and negative stimuli (Lang
et al., 1993). Recent research showed that positive stimuli
were viewed longer than negative stimuli when the stimuli
had been presented before (Kron et al., 2014). When partici-
pants can adjust their viewing time, faces with higher baby
schema are looked at for a longer period (Parsons et al.,
2011; Sprengelmeyer et al., 2013). Interestingly, previous
studies reported that the subjective rating of cuteness was
positively correlated with viewing duration, but not corre-
lated with the level of zygomaticus major muscle activity
(Hildebrandt & Fitzgerald, 1978; Nittono, 2011). Therefore,
facial EMG and viewing duration measures can produce
different patterns of results.
Because no standardized stimulus set exists for kawaii,
we presented a number of pictures to the participants and
made a post hoc selection of the stimulus sets that are con-
trolled in their levels of kawaii, pleasantness, and arousal
according to the participants' rating scores. By doing so, we
can compare the patterns of subjective, behavioral, and phys-
iological measures that co-occur in the same participants. We
examined whether the known responses to kawaii pictures
with baby schema (e.g., increases in positive subjective rat-
ings, zygomaticus major muscle activity, and voluntary
viewing duration) also occur in response to kawaii pictures
without baby schema. Moreover, only women were recruited
in this study because women are more sensitive and respon-
sive to cuteness in infants (Hahn, Xiao, Sprengelmeyer, &
Perrett, 2013; Lehmann, Huis in't Veld, & Vingerhoets,
2013; Lobmaier et al., 2010; Sprengelmeyer et al., 2009; see
also Berman, 1980, for the importance of situational vari-
ables) and to kawaii stimuli in general (Nittono, 2016).

Method
Participants
Twenty female university students (20-27 years old, M =
22.2 years) participated in the study. All declared that they
had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. They were right
handed according to the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory
(Oldfield, 1971). The protocol was approved by the Research
Ethics Committee of the Graduated School of Integrated Arts
and Sciences, Hiroshima University. Written informed con-
sent was obtained from the participants.
Stimuli
In total, 40 color pictures were selected from the Internet
through a Google image search. To make the stimuli vary in
the levels of kawaii and infantility, kawaii and infantile pic-
tures (e.g., baby), kawaii and less infantile pictures (e.g., des-
sert plate), less kawaii and infantile pictures (e.g., preterm
infant), and less kawaii and less infantile pictures (e.g., adult
male face) were selected through a discussion among three
female university students who did not serve as participants.
The materials and the data are available from the correspond-
ing author on request.
Procedure
Participants were tested individually in a sound attenuated
room. The experiment consisted of two sessions. The partici-
pants first rated 40 pictures one by one while recording psy-
chophysiological measures and they then viewed the pictures
again as long as they wished. This two-step procedure was
adapted according to a classic study on affective picture pro-
cessing (Lang et al., 1993). The pictures were presented with
Inquisit 3.0 (Millisecond software, USA) on a 21-inch cath-
ode ray tube display placed 100 cm in front of the partici-
pants'eyes. Each picture extended to fit within a 30 cm by 30
cm frame (visual angle = 17°).
In the rating session, each trial started with a screen with
a serial number for 2 s. Next, a fixation cross appeared for 6
s. Then, each picture was presented for 6 s in a randomized
order. During this period, facial EMGs and SCRs were
recorded. After the offset of each picture, a rating screen
appeared. The participants judged their impressions of the
picture on six 6-point scales (pleasant, unpleasant, arousing,
kawaii, infantile, and I want to approach; 1 = not at all, 6 =
very much). Among them, the item I want to approach was a
dependent measure of primary interest, whereas the other
items were used for post hoc stimulus selection. When the
participants clicked on the "Finish" button, the next trial
started 1 s after. A short break was inserted after every 10
trials. Two practice trials were conducted at the beginning
with pictures that were not used in the experiment.
In the free viewing session, the same pictures were presented
again in a random order. When the participants clicked on a
mouse button, a fixation cross appeared for 1.5 s, which was
followed by a picture. They were instructed to view each picture
as long as they wished and click on the mouse button again to
move to the next trial, which started with a fixation cross. The
interval (in milliseconds) between the picture onset and the
mouse click was designated as the viewing duration. A short
break was inserted after every 10 trials. Four practice trials with
four different pictures were conducted at the beginning.
Post Hoc Stimulus Selection
After the experiment, the mean score of each rating scale was
obtained by averaging the data of all participants (N = 20).
Based on these mean rating scores, three categories of stim-
uli were selected from the 40 pictures. Figure 1 illustrates
some examples of each category. Five pictures each were

neutral category.

selected for the kawaii with baby schema category and the
kawaii without baby schema category, so the scores of pleas-
ant, unpleasant, arousing, and kawaii were equalized between
the categories. The kawaii pictures with baby schema
depicted a human baby's face without an expression and
baby animals (chick, puppy, piglet, and white bear). The
kawaii pictures without baby schema depicted blossoms, a
dessert plate, macaroons, a wedding dress, and perfume bot-
tles. The neutral category consisted of six pictures: an adult
male face without expression, a tadpole, a newborn croco-
dile, scientific glassware, a men's suit, and a do-it-yourself
toolbox. The former three pictures were living things (as a
control for the kawaii pictures with baby schema) and the
latter three pictures were nonliving things (as a control for
the kawaii pictures without baby schema). The level of infan-
tility was equalized between the neutral pictures and the pic-
tures of the kawaii without baby schema. Because the total
number of pictures was small, we could not set up two differ-
ent neutral categories.
Physiological Measurements
Biosignals were recorded with a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz
(filter settings: direct current to 200 Hz) using QuickAmp
(Brain Products, Germany). The data were analyzed with
Brain Vision Analyzer ver. 2.0 (Brain Products, Germany).
Facial EMG.The facial EMG activities of the corrugator
supercilii muscles, which are associated with negative emo-
tion (Lang et al., 1993), and of the zygomatic major muscles
were recorded bipolarly over the left eyebrow and at the left
cheek, respectively, according to the guidelines (Fridlund &
Cacioppo, 1986). Ag/AgCl electrodes (4-mm diameter) were
used. The recorded waveform was filtered with a digital
highpass filter of 15 Hz (12 dB/oct), rectified by reversing
the negative values into positive absolute values (Larsen,
Norris, & Cacioppo, 2003). The mean value of the 6-s period
after the stimulus onset was calculated. Visual inspection
confirmed that there were no excessive artifacts in the ana-
lyzed period. The mean value of the 1-s period before stimu-
lus onset was used as a baseline. To correct for the positive
skewness of the EMG data, the mean values were subjected
to a natural logarithm transformation. The difference between
the baseline and the poststimulus period was calculated as
corrugator supercilii and zygomatic major. To understand
the time course of facial EMGs, the mean values of seven 1-s
periods from 1 s before to 6 s after stimulus onset were also
calculated without a baseline correction.
SCR. The SCR was recorded with the canonical 0.5 V con-
stant voltage method using a galvanic skin response (GSR)
sensor of QuickAmp (Brain Product, Germany). Two Ag/
AgCl electrodes filled with 0.05 M NaCl electrolytes were
placed on the volar side of the middle phalanges of the
index and middle fingers of the left hand. No highpass filter
was used for recording or analysis. The SCR was visually
inspected and its amplitude (in µS) was scored as the differ-
ence value between the initial deflection in the period of 1
to 4 s after stimulus onset and the peak within 5 s thereafter
(Boucsein et al., 2012). Any response less than 0.01 µS was
regarded as no response and coded as 0. To conform the
data to the normal distribution, the amplitude value (µS) +
1 was converted to a natural logarithm. This transformation
makes the amplitude value of no response trials 0. The
mean amplitude across trials was calculated including no
response trials.
Statistical Analysis
For subjective ratings, viewing duration, change scores of
facial EMGs, and SCR amplitude, the mean values were cal-
culated for the three stimulus categories. A one-way multi-
variate analysis of variance (MANOVA) with repeated
measures was conducted for each measure. A MANOVA,
rather than an ANOVA, was used because it can solve the
Type I error inflation inherent in repeated-measures designs
(Vasey & Thayer, 1987). To correct for the positive skew-
ness, the viewing duration was converted to a natural loga-
rithm. The time courses of facial EMGs were analyzed by
two-way MANOVAs with the factors of stimulus category
(3) and time (7). The significance level was set at .05. A post
hoc comparison of means was made by Bonferroni t tests
(two-tailed) with an adjusted comparison-wise significance
level. Uncorrected p values are reported in the text, whereas
significant differences after correction are shown in the fig-
ures. In addition, a picture-by-picture correlation analysis
was conducted. For each of the 40 pictures, the mean value
of each measure was calculated from all the participants'
data (N = 20). A scatterplot showing the relationship between
kawaii rating score and each measure was made. Spearman's
rank correlation coefficient (r
s
) was calculated because the
values might not be normally distributed.
Results
Validity Check of Stimulus Selection
Figure 2 shows the mean values of subjective, behavioral, and
physiological measures for each category of pictures. As
described above, a post hoc selection of pictures was made in
the present study. To check the validity of the manipulation,
one-way MANOVAs were conducted. The pleasantness,
unpleasantness, and kawaii scores differed across the three cat-
egories, F(2, 18) = 51.70, p < .001, 
p
2 = .852; F(2, 18) = 39.10,
p < .001, 
p
2 = .813; and F(2, 18) = 110.33, p < .001, 
p
2 = .925,
respectively. Multiple comparisons of means revealed that,
compared with the pictures in the neutral category, the pictures
in both kawaii categories were rated to be more pleasant,
less unpleasant, and more kawaii. No significant differences
were found between the two kawaii categories. The effect of
Nittono and Ihara 5
category was significant also for the arousal score, F(2, 18) =
3.59, p = .049, 
p
2 = .285. Although the score was numerically
higher for both the kawaii categories than for the neutral cate-
gory, pairwise multiple comparisons did not reveal any signifi-
cant difference. The infantility score differed significantly
across categories, F(2, 18) = 208.85, p < .001, 
p
2 = .959. The
kawaii pictures with baby schema were rated to be more infan-
tile than the kawaii pictures without baby schema and the neu-
tral pictures. In sum, these results confirmed the validity of the
selection procedure.
Subjective Ratings
The subjective measure of approach motivation (I want to
approach) varied across stimulus categories, F(2, 18) = 75.43,
p < .001, 
p
2 = .893. A multiple comparison showed that,
compared with the neutral pictures, both types of kawaii pic-
tures were rated to be higher in this dimension, ts(19) = 8.72
and 12.62, ps < .001 for kawaii with baby schema and kawaii
without baby schema, respectively, and did not differ from
each other, t(19) = 0.27, p = .791.
Viewing Duration
The positive skewness of the viewing duration data was cor-
rected after a natural logarithm transformation (from 2.25 to
0.01). Viewing duration also showed significant differences
among stimulus categories, F(2, 18) = 25.26, p < .001, 
p
2 =
.737. Regardless of the presence or absence of baby schema,
kawaii pictures were viewed for a longer period than neutral
pictures, ts(19) = 7.15 and 6.66, ps < .001 for kawaii with
baby schema and kawaii without baby schema, respectively.
No significant difference was found between the two types
of kawaii stimuli, t(19) = 1.34, p = .195.
Psychophysiological Responses
The positive skewness of the EMG data was corrected after
a natural logarithm transformation (from 3.11 to 0.25).
For facial EMGs, the change scores (i.e., the differences
between the baseline and the mean amplitude of the 6-s
period after stimulus onset) were subjected to one-way
MANOVAs with the factor of stimulus category. Corrugator
supercilii muscle activity did not vary significantly, F < 1.

6 SAGE Open
Regarding zygomaticus major muscle activity, the effect
of the category was significant, F(2, 18) = 15.44, p < .001,

p
2 = .632. As shown in Figure 2, a multiple comparison of
means revealed that, compared with the neutral pictures,
both types of pictures induced greater zygomaticus
major muscle activity, ts(19) = 5.34 and 2.89, p < .001 and
p = .009 for kawaii with baby schema and kawaii without
baby schema, respectively. Importantly, the response was
significantly greater for the kawaii pictures with baby
schema than for the kawaii pictures without baby schema,
t(19) = 4.65, p < .001.
Figure 3 shows the time courses of facial EMGs without a
baseline correction. A two-way MANOVA with the factors
of stimulus category and time (seven 1-s periods) showed
no significant effects on the corrugator supercilii muscles,
F < 1.34, p > .289. Regarding the zygomaticus major muscles,
the main effects of stimulus category and time and the
interaction effect were significant, F(2, 18) = 10.45, p = .001,

p
2 = .537; F(6, 14) = 3.48, p = .026, 
p
2 = .599; and F(12, 8)
= 5.96, p = .009, 
p
2 = .899, respectively. A test of the simple
main effect for each time point showed that, although no dif-
ferences were found at the baseline period, F < 1, the catego-
ries differed as early as 0 to 1 s after stimulus onset, F(2, 18)
= 4.13, p = .033, 
p
2 = .315. In this period, a significant dif-
ference was found only between the kawaii pictures with
baby schema and the neutral pictures. After 1 s, the three
categories differed significantly from one another. The data
confirm the findings of the change score analysis. That is,
compared with the neutral pictures, both types of kawaii pic-
tures induced greater zygomaticus major muscle activity.
Moreover, the activity was still greater for the kawaii pic-
tures with baby schema than for the kawaii pictures without
baby schema.
SCRs occurred rarely. The mean SCR frequencies were
18%, 12%, and 18% for the kawaii pictures with baby
schema, the kawaii pictures without baby schema, and the
neutral pictures, respectively. The mean amplitude (includ-
ing no response trials) did not differ significantly among
categories, F(2, 18) = 1.34, p = .288, 
p
2 = .129.
Picture-by-Picture Analysis
In the analysis of category differences described above, the
mean kawaii score was numerically higher for the kawaii
pictures with baby schema than for the kawaii pictures with-
out baby schema. This slight, nonsignificant difference does
not seem to cause the higher zygomaticus major muscle
activity for the kawaii pictures with baby schema. To test this
hypothesis, a picture-by-picture analysis was conducted.
Figure 4 shows the scatterplot of the relationship between the
kawaii score and each measure. The data are based on the
mean values of 20 participants. For most measures, the dis-
tribution ranges of the five kawaii pictures with baby schema
(solid circles) and the five kawaii pictures without baby
schema (open circles) overlapped each other. However, this
was not the case for zygomaticus major muscle activity. The
difference between the two sets of five data points was sig-
nificant in a nonparametric Mann­Whitney U test, U = 2.00,
p = .032. This result supports that, although the kawaii score
varied across pictures, the kawaii pictures with baby schema
induced greater zygomaticus major muscle activity than the
kawaii pictures without baby schema as a whole.
Figure 4 also shows the Spearman's rank correlation coef-
ficientsbetweenkawaiiratingandothermeasures.Significant
correlations were obtained for subjective measures (pleas-
ant, unpleasant, infantile, and I want to approach), viewing
duration, and two facial EMG measures (zygomaticus major
and corrugator supercilii muscles). Except for corrugator
supercilii muscle activity, significant differences between
stimulus categories were also obtained in the main analysis
described above.
Discussion
The purpose of this exploratory study is to understand the
commonalities and differences between the two types of
kawaii stimuli with or without baby schema by comparing
psychophysiological responses recorded while participants
were viewing the pictures of each category. The kawaii pic-
tures with baby schema induced more positive subjective
feelings, greater zygomaticus major muscle activity, and a
longer viewing duration than the neutral pictures. These
results are consistent with the previous findings about psy-
chophysiological responses to baby pictures (Bradley et al.,
2001; Hildebrandt & Fitzgerald, 1978; Lang et al., 1993).
The present study newly found that similar responses
occurred also for kawaii pictures without baby schema. The
difference between the presence and absence of baby schema

appeared in the activity of the zygomaticus major muscles,
which was greater for the kawaii pictures with baby schema.
Positive Feelings
Both types of kawaii pictures were associated with a higher
score of pleasantness, a lower score of unpleasantness, and a
stronger feeling related to approach motivation than the neu-
tral pictures. These findings were confirmed by the picture-by-
picture analysis. The kawaii score was positively correlated
with the scores of pleasantness and desire to approach and
negatively correlated with the score of unpleasantness.
However, the mean arousal scores of the kawaii pictures
were not significantly higher than that of the neutral pictures.
This result is consistent with the rare occurrence of SCRs to
these pictures (less than 20%). Bohlin (1976) reported a sim-
ilar frequency of SCRs when participants listened passively
to tone stimuli that were presented at a random interval of 20
to 40 s. Therefore, the low occurrence rate of this study is not
an exceptional case. An SCR is a measure of sympathetic
nervous system activity and is known to be elicited by high-
arousal affective pictures, regardless of their valence (Lang
et al., 1993). The result of a subjective rating suggests that
the rare occurrence of SCRs is mainly because the kawaii
pictures were not arousing. Bradley et al. (2001) also showed
that pictures depicting babies and their family ("Family" cat-
egory) were rated as less arousing and induced smaller SCRs
than other categories of high-arousal positive pictures (e.g.,
erotic couples). Shiota, Neufeld, Yeung, Moser, and Perea
(2011) reported that viewing baby animals was associated

with increased heart rate and increased respiratory rate.
However, Sherman, Haidt, and Coan (2009) argued that
heart rate and skin conductance level, which is another mea-
sure of sympathetic autonomic activity, did not consistently
increase from the baseline when participants watched a slide
show of baby animal pictures. These findings suggest that
feelings of kawaii are associated with a low-to-moderate
arousal state. In a review article on autonomic nervous sys-
tem activity in emotion, Kreibig (2010) wrote that no conclu-
sive statement could be made on the affection-related
emotions because the amount of research was small. More
studies are required to understand the autonomic responses
underlying perceiving cute or kawaii objects.
Facial Expressions
Consistent with the well-established findings (Bradley et al.,
2001; Hildebrandt & Fitzgerald, 1978; Lang et al., 1993),
the pictures with baby schema activated the zygomaticus
major muscles associated with smiling. In the present study,
we newly found that kawaii stimuli without infantile fea-
tures also elicited a smiling response, although its intensity
was smaller than that of kawaii stimuli with baby schema.
Bradley et al. (2001) suggested that not all stimuli with posi-
tive valence induce a smiling response. Specifically, family
pictures depicting babies and children induced greater zygo-
maticus major muscle activity, whereas other pleasant pic-
ture categories, such as erotic couples, adventure, sports,
and nature, did not. Smiling is a social behavior affected by
the social context (Fridlund, 1991). Research has shown that
laughter, which is often associated with big smiles, is highly
contagious to multiple members of a group and has a func-
tion of fostering social bonds with them, more efficiently
than one-to-one grooming (Dezecache & Dunbar, 2012;
Provine, 2016). Given that smiling has a role in expressing
nonhostility in the social context, it may enhance particu-
larly for pictures that depict or are suggestive of affiliative
social relations.
In the picture-by-picture analysis, a positive correlation
was found between the kawaii score and the change in zygo-
maticus major muscle activity. More kawaii pictures elicited
a greater zygomaticus major EMG response. This finding,
however, does not mean that the EMG amplitude of the
zygomaticus major muscles can predict the intensity of the
subjective feelings of kawaii. Even when the subjective rat-
ings of kawaii were equivalent, the presence of baby schema
enhanced the facial EMG response. A previous study also
showed that, although baby pictures elicited greater zygo-
maticus major muscle activity, the size of the facial EMG
response did not correlate with the subjective ratings of cute-
ness (Hildebrandt & Fitzgerald, 1978; Nittono, 2011).
Although the two types of kawaii pictures differed in their
infantility scores, infantility itself did not cause changes to
the zygomaticus major muscle activity. Among 40 pictures,
there were infantile but not kawaii stimuli (e.g., a premature
baby who undergoes a medical procedure, children in horror
movies), which correspond to the data points at the upper
left corner of the scatterplot labeled Infantile in Figure 4.
The zygomatic major muscle activity was low for these
pictures (see the lower left corner in the scatterplot labeled
zygomaticus major). Therefore, kawaii is a key factor for
eliciting greater zygomaticus major muscle activity.
Regarding the corrugator supercilii muscles, no signifi-
cant differences were found among the three categories,
whereas the picture-by-picture analysis showed a significant
negative correlation between the change score of corrugator
supercilii muscle activity and the kawaii score. The latter
correlation is due to the pictures with negative valence that
were not included in the analysis of the category differences.
These pictures were associated with lower kawaii scores and
higher corrugator supercilii responses. The amplitude of
EMG over the corrugator supercilii muscles increased mono-
tonically with the level of unpleasantness (Lang et al., 1993;
Larsen et al., 2003). As shown in Figure 3, the activity of the
corrugator supercilii muscles appears to be slightly lesser for
the kawaii pictures than for the neutral pictures, although the
difference was small and nonsignificant. In the present study,
the level of corrugator supercilii muscle activity was not high
at the baseline because participants were in a relaxed state. If
they were in a stressful and negative state with elevated cor-
rugator supercilii muscle activity, kawaii stimuli may serve
to lower the activity level significantly.
Viewing Duration
Regardless of the presence or absence of baby schema, both
types of kawaii pictures were viewed voluntarily for a longer
period when they were presented for the second time. Pictures
of babies who are rated to be cuter or that have a higher level
of baby schema are viewed for a longer period in a free view-
ing task (Hildebrandt & Fitzgerald, 1978; Power, Hildebrandt,
& Fitzgerald, 1982) and in a task in which participants can
lengthen and shorten the duration of picture viewing by but-
ton presses (Parsons et al., 2011; Sprengelmeyer et al., 2013).
The present study showed a similar increase in viewing dura-
tion for kawaii pictures without baby schema. This result is
consistent with the subjective rating of desire to approach,
which was higher for both types of kawaii pictures than for
the neutral pictures, supporting the hypothesis that feelings of
kawaii are associated with approach motivation. We used a
passive viewing task according to a tradition of affective pic-
ture processing research (e.g., Lang et al., 1993). In a future
study, this finding should be tested using an active button-
press task described above that is conceptually more suitable
for measuring the level of approach/avoidance motivation.
Limitations and Future Directions
There are several limitations in this exploratory study. First
of all, the number of pictures presented were relatively small.
Nittono and Ihara 9
This was because we avoided boring participants with a lon-
ger sequence of pictures, which would reduce participants'
general motivation. A further study with a larger number of
pictures would be worthwhile. In addition, the present study
used a post hoc selection of stimulus sets. This protocol is
useful to control variables within the group of participants
actually analyzed. However, to increase the generalizability
of the results, it may be better to predefine the picture sets
first by a preliminarily survey with a larger sample size.
Second, only women participated in the study. Women
are generally more sensitive to and interested in babies
than men (Berman, 1980; Hahn et al., 2013; Lehmann et al.,
2013; Lobmaier et al., 2010; Sprengelmeyer et al., 2013;
Sprengelmeyer et al., 2009), although the motivation to see
cute babies may not differ between men and women (Parsons
et al., 2011). One question is whether these gender differ-
ences exist for kawaii stimuli without baby schema. Because
women are more interested not only in babies but also in
kawaii things without baby schema (Nittono, 2016), some
gender differences may exist. However, these differences are
probably more influenced by culture than by biology.
Third, this study did not care for individual differences in
kawaii responses. A previous research study suggests that
people with high empathy characteristics showed greater
responses to baby schema (Lehmann et al., 2013). Kanai and
Nittono (2014) showed that the relationship between empa-
thy and feelings of kawaii was observed not only for babies
but also for inanimate kawaii objects, such as clothes and
accessories, in which living creatures were not used as a
motif. In future studies, it is worth investigating how other
personality variables related to empathy, such as autism and
psychopathy, are associated with responses to baby schema
and responses to kawaii stimuli without baby schema.
Fourth, further research must examine whether the pres-
ence or absence of baby schema in kawaii pictures affects
other types of behavior and physiological measures. It has
been shown that viewing kawaii pictures with baby schema
promotes careful behavior and narrows the focus of attention
(Nittono, Fukushima, Yano, & Moriya, 2012; Sherman et al.,
2009; Sherman, Haidt, Iyer, & Coan, 2013). It is interesting
to test whether this effect also occurs after viewing kawaii
stimuli without baby schema. It will offer an answer to the
question of whether this effect is due to baby schema or due
to a positive emotion with a strong approach motivation.
Conclusion
Traditionally, cuteness is regarded as synonymous with
infant physical attractiveness. The Japanese word kawaii is
used to describe babies and infantile features, but it is also
used for noninfantile objects. In this exploratory study, we
focused on the latter type of kawaii without baby schema.
Both types of kawaii pictures induced a positive emotion
with a strong approach motivation (indexed by subjective
rating and viewing duration) and a smiling response as
compared with neutral pictures, although the smiling
response was larger for the pictures with baby schema than
for the pictures without baby schema. These findings suggest
that the word kawaii used in present-day Japan expresses
positive feelings that are more generic than infant attractive-
ness and that are associated with a motivation to approach a
preferable object. More than 70 years after Lorenz's (1943)
proposal of baby schema, recent research has just begun to
show that the feelings of cuteness are not directly associated
with protection and nurturance (Nenkov & Scott, 2014;
Sherman & Haidt, 2011). The present study suggests that the
concept of kawaii (and potentially also the concept of cute-
ness) would be broader than the responses to baby schema.
Studying about kawaii can be useful for developing a more
elaborative model of the universal feelings of cuteness.
