By the close of the 20th century, the dominant top-down
expert-driven management of natural resources was deemed
to have failed. A new, conceptually attractive participatory
model replaced it, promising better decisions and more sus-
tainable outcomes. The participatory paradigm appeals to all
political persuasions: left-wing radicals looking for grass-
roots empowerment, and right-wing neoliberals for ways of
circumventing perceived ineffectual central governments
(Mohan & Stokke, 2000). Ultimately, participation "means
different things to different people" (Eversole, 2003, p. 782).
There are examples of successful participation in the lit-
erature (Abernethy & Sally, 2000; Chambers, 1997; Cook
et al., 2013; D. A. Crook & Jones, 1999; Ostrom, 2005).
However, they tend to operate at the local scale, with clearly
defined and manageable goals--often with a focus on envi-
ronmental protection or managing an irrigation scheme, and
where the stakeholders are relatively homogeneous in terms
of power relations and levels of education. They are also
often in areas with resource abundance, for example, plenty
of water (Cook et al., 2013). Thus, any lessons learnt may not
be transferable to other contexts.
Despite this, participation was embraced with precipitate
haste, scaled up and embedded into many developing coun-
tries' national policies with massive transformatory and
environmental protection expectations (Holmes & Scoones,
2000). One of the most ambitious applications was in newly
democratic South Africa, with its challenging history,
extreme heterogeneity, and relative water scarcity (Muller,
2009). There is scant evidence, however, that the participa-
tory paradigm will deliver the ambitious goals of many het-
erogeneous developing countries in reasonable time frames,
and they may not be transferable to contexts of scarcity.
The participatory model was embraced very much as an
act of faith and "in opposition to previously dominant mod-
els of development" (Hickey & Mohan, 2004, p. 4). There is
therefore a strong case to be made for evaluating participa-
tory approaches, and what has been achieved vis-à-vis top-
down non-participatory models, especially in view of the
expenditure and expectation vested in it. The World Bank
only acknowledged in 2005 a severe lack of research that
evaluated its participatory programs (25% of its total portfo-
lio; World Bank, 2005).
Conley and Moote (2003) suggest that evaluations of the
right sort are urgently needed, but those that have been under-
taken are largely unsatisfactory for a number of reasons: There
are those produced by enthusiasts of participation (Beierle &
Cayford, 2002; Innes & Booher, 1999), or conversely, by crit-
ics of the approach (Coglianese, 1999; Cooke & Kothari,

Evaluating Participatory Initiatives
in South Africa: Not Just Processes
But Outcomes Too
Julia Brown1
Abstract
The participatory model of management for natural resources, particularly water, rapidly became a global phenomenon in
the early part of the 21st century. In many developing and transition countries, such as South Africa, expectations from it
were disproportionately ambitious, despite little evidence that better results in the form of sustainable outcomes would
follow. There is an urgent need for evaluations that assess what can and cannot be expected from participation. Empirically
based processes and outcome-orientated evaluations are likely to prove more balanced, although they are challenging and
thus rarely attempted. This article proposes an evaluative framework that allows for comparison, and differentiates between
processes and participatory governance and sustainable outcomes. Four South African vignettes of participatory initiatives,
operating at different scales with varying degrees of stakeholder heterogeneity, are measured against the framework, and
broader lessons learnt about both participation and attempts to evaluate it.

demics have used for their evaluations, and their measures of
success, are radically different. There is not a uniformly agreed
framework for undertaking evaluations, and moreover, evalu-
ations may not be objective (Robson, 2002).
What is needed is a balanced and rigorous type of evalua-
tion, useful across different scales and contexts and empiri-
cally grounded. To date, there is a dearth of evaluations that
assess what can and cannot be expected from participatory
approaches (Conley & Moote, 2003; Hickey & Mohan,
2004; Rowe & Frewer, 2000).
This article first proceeds with a review of the relevant
literature on evaluations and then offers a framework devised
for evaluating participatory initiatives. A series of four
vignettes from the Inkomati region of north east South Africa
are set out and assessed against the evaluative framework.
Lessons learnt about the nature of participation and attempts
to evaluate it conclude the article.
A Framework for Evaluating
Participatory Processes and Outcomes
The purpose of an evaluation is to show whether a new initia-
tive is working toward the stated goals of the program
(Robson, 2002). Clarity over the objective is crucial: Without
it, measuring success is compromised. Baseline data must be
collected to gauge whether a program is having an impact;
this is often something that has been neglected with the roll-
ing out of participatory efforts (World Bank, 2005).
Of huge significance is the context in which a particular
initiative is being undertaken: the scale, availability of the
resource, economic status, and heterogeneity of stakeholders
(Bellamy, McDonald, Syme, & Butterworth, 1999). Context
is inextricably linked to the goals of many initiatives, for in
the literature it is clear that in developed countries, the
emphasis of participatory efforts in natural resource manage-
ment tends to be conflict resolution and environmental pro-
tection (Cook et al., 2013), whereas in developing countries,
social, economic, and environmental sustainability are
sought, a far more ambitious undertaking (Muller, 2009).
There are also important differences in the level of citizen
control being advocated in developed and developing coun-
tries: In the former, it tends to be collaborative management,
in the latter, participation is often coupled with devolution
(the highest level of Arnstein, 1969 ladder). It is rarely, in
evaluating participatory programs in developed and develop-
ing contexts, that like can be compared with like.
It is the business of evaluators to look at both the pro-
cesses in setting up a participatory program and the outcomes
that are the result. Processes need to be considered fair, open,
inclusive, and accountable to engender support for the deci-
sions and potential products and outcomes that stem from
them (Parkins & Mitchell, 2005). It is also crucial that they
are linked to real decision making and substantive changes
on the ground, that is, sustainable development outcomes.
Otherwise, interest in participatory processes may be lost,
and they may be seen as a mere "talking shop" (Tewdwr-
Jones & Allmendinger, 1998, p. 183). A major problem has
been that evaluators tend to focus on either processes or out-
comes, with a particular bias to the former (Conley & Moote,
2003). To understand this, it is necessary to look at the moti-
vations for undertaking an evaluation and the perspective of
evaluators. Deliberative democrats, heavily influenced by
the Habermasian (1984) ideal speech, view participation and
deliberative processes as an end in itself (Healey, 2003;
Innes, 1996). This is largely at variance with the natural
resource management literature (Bellamy, Walker,
McDonald, & Syme, 2001; Blaikie, 2006). There has also
been a trend for participatory evaluations, that is, asking par-
ticipants what they thought of the process, often favored by
those who value processes and deliberation (Carr &
Halvorsen, 2001; Charnley & Engelbert, 2005). A second
explanation is that focusing on processes is easier than out-
comes: The indicators (discussed shortly) are relatively
straightforward to assess, often more practical and certainly
less tortuous. However, it is unsatisfactory to give undue
weight to processes only--because it ignores whether
improvements in livelihoods or the environment are being
delivered. Focusing on outcomes only could mean that pro-
cesses become a "black box" (Robson, 2002, p. 209)--study-
ing the intervening processes may determine the variables
that have affected the outcome and their causal links. There
is therefore a strong case for an evaluative methodology that
looks at both processes and outcomes of participatory initia-
tives: a "daunting task that is rarely undertaken" (Conley &
Moote, 2003, p. 374).
Before moving on to the proposed process and outcomes
evaluative framework, which in the second half of the article
is applied to four participatory initiatives in South Africa, it is
helpful to differentiate between processes, products of pro-
cesses (interchangeable with outputs), and overall outcomes
because these distinctions are not always clear in the literature.
Figure 1 illustrates the stages based on South Africa's plans to
establish participatory Catchment Management Agencies
(CMA) charged with the planning and management of water
resources. Some clarification is required in the process and
product category where the interpretation of success or failure
may be challenged. An output may be "tangible," such as a
new representative institution (a CMA) or an agreement, or it
may be "intangible," such as enhanced social and intellectual
capital and increased trust that may be difficult to measure
(Bellamy et al., 2001; Charnley & Englebert, 2005). The tan-
gible category conventionally is regarded as a success, but as
Innes and Booher (1999), deliberative democrats, put it,
"Conventional ideas . . . may lead one to see failure where
there is success and vice versa" (p. 415). An agreement may
lack durability, so is ultimately a failure; on the other hand, in
the context of South Africa's history, processes that work on
capacity building may prove to be important to the long-term
success and durability of participatory efforts. In sum, a lack
Brown 3
of tangible products should not necessarily be viewed as fail-
ure. Another area of blurring of framework categories, again
stemming from different academic backgrounds and perspec-
tives, is where intangible process outputs and social sustain-
ability outcomes become indistinguishable. Innes and Booher
and Mog (2004) would categorize the former as social sustain-
ability outcomes, whereas this author would argue that social
sustainability is a reduction in inequalities. Thus, even decid-
ing on what is a process and what is an outcome is not straight-
forward. It is argued that outcomes should be sub-divided into
mid-term outcome--participatory governance--and the ulti-
mate outcome--which is the result of this governance--sus-
tainable management of the resource.
It is generally agreed that evaluative criteria--indicators
against which to measure progress in an initiative--are of
crucial importance (Conley & Moote, 2003; Fraser, Dougill,
Mabee, Reed, & McAlpine, 2006; Robson, 2002). There is a
vast and confusing body of literature that warns that too
many indicators can become unwieldy (Bell & Morse, 2003;
Kenny, 1999). All indicator lists are normative, but not all
indicators themselves are subjective: for example, the num-
ber of members in an organization. Furthermore, what is
deemed a success or failure is a value judgment and therefore
subjective: thus, "developing truly objective means of evalu-
ating collaborative efforts is impossible" (Conley & Moote,
2003, p. 382). Thus, it is important that evaluators declare
their position and potential bias.
Process Evaluation
Three broad categories of process indicators are identified in
Table 1. The first category of indicators is "acceptance
criteria," and is linked to the legitimacy and trust in the process
(Lind & Tyler, 1988; Rowe & Frewer, 2000). The second cat-
egory, "process criteria," is related to more practical consider-
ations. The final category of indicator is products: Did the
process result in desired "tangible" and "intangible" products?
These process indicators are fully explored and they are
applied to the case studies presented in the fourth part of the
article.
Participatory Governance Outcome Evaluation
This is a category that the literature tends to overlook but it
is important and discrete, and proposed indicators are pre-
sented in Table 2.
Sustainable Development Outcome Evaluation
What is the evidence that participatory and devolutionary
processes have resulted in sustainable outcomes? There are
no universally agreed on set of sustainability indicators, and
although indicators have been developed (Fraser et al., 2006;
Mog, 2004), they are for a specific purpose and context, fre-
quently weighted toward environmental sustainability and
are not applicable for the present study. This takes us back to
the original three pillars of sustainability: economic, envi-
ronmental, and social (Baker, 2006). Within each aspect, a
choice of indicators is needed. Economic indicators could
include a growing economy and gross domestic product
(GDP) that is relatively straightforward to assess. Potential
environmental sustainability indicators would include the
maintenance and enhancement of ecological integrity, which
would require adequate technical capacity to determine and

measure. Social sustainability may be the most subjective
criterion: This researcher argues strongly that redress and
reduction in inequalities are important indicators, particu-
larly given South Africa's history of White minority rule. As
Conley and Moote (2003) point out, documenting "outcomes
is easiest when they are readily quantified, and where there is
sufficient baseline information to allow reliable compari-
sons" (p. 379), which goes some way to justify Mog's (2004)
assessment of sustainability evaluations as being an "intel-
lectual quagmire."

Participatory Initiatives in South Africa:
Four Vignettes
Democratic South Africa is regarded as being at the forefront
of enshrining participation into laws and policies. For exam-
ple, its 1998 National Water Act aims to radically transform
the management of water through the establishment of par-
ticipatory CMAs and at the sub-catchment scale through the
transformation of White-dominated irrigation boards into
more inclusive Water User Associations (WUA; Republic of
South Africa, 1998). Participation of stakeholders is also
now a legal requirement for all industrial proposals that
require Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) following
the 1997 Environment Conservation Act (Republic of South
Africa, 1997).
There now follow four vignettes of participatory initia-
tives drawn from the Inkomati Water Management Area: The
first is the establishment of South Africa's first CMA, the
second looks at attempts to establish WUAs in the Inkomati,
the third explores the creation of the deliberative Crocodile
Forum, and the final vignette investigates public participa-
tion in the EIA for Sappi Kraft paper mill's proposed expan-
sion plans. The case studies exist at different scales: some are
legal requirements, others are voluntary initiatives; they
encompass different levels of heterogeneity of stakeholders,
and they were each established for different purposes.
The water-stressed Inkomati (deficit of 12% of total
requirement) constitutes three catchments, from north to
south: Sabie/Sand, Crocodile, and the Komati, and includes
portions of three different former Black homelands (see
Figure 2). Covering an area of 28,383 km2 with an estimated
population of 1.4 million in 1995, the dominant users are still
White-controlled commercial agriculture (57% total require-
ment), followed by commercial forestry and industry
(Department of Water Affairs [DWA], 2004).
Method
Much of the data for the case studies come from primary
interview material generated from three visits to SouthAfrica
between November 2003 and March 2005. One hundred and
one interviews were conducted with the main stakeholder
groups both in the Inkomati and Pretoria, not all of whom
were participants in the participatory processes. Interviewees
were asked questions about their awareness of participatory
initiatives, their involvement in these initiatives (if at all),
and reflections on the processes. Meetings of the Crocodile
Forum and CMA Advisory Committee were observed.
Government reports and other studies were also consulted.
At this stage, it is important to declare that this
researcher has a tendency to weight outcomes over pro-
cesses: Are participatory efforts resulting in real changes
on the ground, most notably in terms of redress for the
rural Black population?
Vignette 1: Inkomati CMA
A zealous Mpumalanga regional DWA official initiated par-
ticipatory efforts in July 1997 to develop CMA proposals in
what is now the Inkomati Water Management Area prior to
the finalization of the 1998 Act and before the Water
Management Areas were determined--in 1999, by govern-
ment-appointed consultants. There was difficulty in identify-
ing and engaging Black interests, not traditionally organized
around water, but eventually Black representatives joined
already established steering committees. Meetings were held
in English. There was a lack of continuity in attendance, and
poor relaying of information to their communities was an
obstacle throughout. A single Inkomati Reference Group
emerged from the committees, whose final proposal for a
CMA Governing Board, submitted in October 2000, was
along geographical rather than sectoral lines, the result of
exhaustive participatory endeavors. Lack of transparent
water use figures by the agricultural sector hindered proceed-
ings and clouded the implications of the proposal. In effect,
the Governing Board could have been dominated by existing
users, and DWA Pretoria officials recognized this. The pro-
posal was put aside for 18 months pending efforts to garner
stakeholder feedback. A period of inactivity followed during
which the forums disintegrated and the regional champion
relocated. This was also a period of growing tensions between
DWA Pretoria and DWA Mpumalanga who did not maintain
the forums, despite pressure from DWA Pretoria.
Fresh impetus came from impending elections in 2004
before which the Minister wanted one CMA in place, and
this resulted in a rushed public relations (PR) exercise. In
line with the Act, he appointed a committee to advice on the
structure of the CMA Governing Board. Observation of an
Advisory Committee meeting (March 2004) in a high-end
hotel in Nelspruit emphasized knowledge asymmetries
between Black and White attendees, and it was apparent that
the DWA-hired facilitator was actually leading the commit-
tee to pre-determined recommendations. The original 2000
proposal was discarded and sectoral representation adopted,
with a heavy slant toward Black interests. There were issues
of participant continuity--some Black representatives were
replaced in the afternoon session, and the late arrival of two
highly vocal and educated White female NGO representa-
tives caused some disruption (although they were supportive
of the facilitator's position). The Black nominal Chairman of
the Advisory Committee conceded in March 2005 that he felt
"uncomfortable" and "lost" during the process. At a later
meeting, a 14-seat Governing Board was recommended, in
effect sidelining commercial farmers, the single largest water
user, and only granting forestry its own seat after lobbying
the Minister. Unsurprisingly, commercial farmers were
unhappy at the outcome and in protest were withholding pay-
ment on the Water Resource Management Charge on which
the functioning on the CMA was to rest.
6 SAGE Open
The formal launch of the CMA was in March 2004, to
coincide with Water Week, but difficulty finding nominees
for Historically Disadvantaged Groups held up proceedings
until September 2005. Nominations were put up for each seat
and the DWAMinister made the final choice of members. The
differential education, skills, and experience of the Governing
Board members was highlighted by Brown (2011).
The Governing Board of the CMA is only "nominally
functional" (Merrey, 2011, p. 253), and this is one of the
most advanced in South Africa. It is now focusing its efforts
on a Catchment Management Strategy (Quinn, 2012). There
was high turnover of Governing Board members, and the
CEO position remained vacant for some time. The decision
to designate the Inkomati as an area for Compulsory
Licensing effectively removes the power to reallocate water
away from the CMA to the center, thus stifling the potential
to achieve redress through a devolved and participatory
institution.
Following a review by DWA (2012) to reduce the number
of Water Management Areas, and thus potential CMAs, from
19 to 9, DWA plans to enlarge the Inkomati to incorporate
the adjacent the Mlhatuze-Usuthu Water Management Area.
This may compromise the future manageability of the CMA
in the interests of supposed efficiency.

Boards Into WUA
The irrigation boards in the Inkomati, developed by the
White commercial farming sector in former White-only

South Africa, are an example of sustainable participatory
institutions managing water at the sub-catchment scale,
although they were not racially representative. Members are
homogeneous with a shared vision of managing the river,
dam, or canal to their benefit. They also enjoyed a high level
of autonomy, particularly in the lower Komati subcatchment,
designated a Government Water Control Area, making mem-
bership of irrigation boards mandatory for all irrigators. The
membership composition of the Komati and Lomati irriga-
tion boards was by the mid-1990s unique because the
Government Water Control Area was expanded to include
Black small-scale farmers in the former homeland areas.
These were the recipients of a sugarcane development pro-
gram and were incorporated into the existing irrigation
boards. Discussions with Komati irrigation board Black rep-
resentatives in February 2004, whose travel expenses were
paid for, suggested that they do not participate in discussions
and were merely passive listeners. The attendance of Black
representatives was thus not necessarily out of interest and
could only be guaranteed if their expenses were paid.
The 1998 Act stipulated that all irrigation boards were to
transform into more inclusive and representative WUAs
within 6 months. The transformation proposals of all 27 irri-
gation boards were rejected by DWA on the grounds that
they were not satisfied that the processes had been inclusive
and participatory. Even the racially representative Komati
and Lomati irrigation boards had their proposals rejected
because they failed to incorporate non-farming interests.
Local municipal representatives felt the proposal they were
presented with a fait accompli, and they felt that they were
given minimal time to consider it.
By 2005, only two WUAs had been established--one
was the transformation of the Elands Valley irrigation
board, and this was only on the fourth attempt in March
2005, after the Elands Valley irrigation board chairman
(retired farmer) had invested considerable time and effort
in consultation and ensured the proposal met the increas-
ingly strict representation criteria for race and gender
set by DWA. The other WUA (Upper Komati, north of
Sawziland) was established in October 2004, in an area
that never had irrigation boards. This was therefore a new
institution. As with the Elands Valley irrigation board, its
formation was the result of personal efforts by a retired
and reform-orientated former White councilor. Again, he
reported the frustration of meeting DWA representation
criteria: "The goals kept shifting." After 1,400 hours, and
20,000 km of travel out of his own finances, he was able
to demonstrate to DWA a representative WUA committee.
Establishing a WUA was no guarantee that it would func-
tion, and regional DWA officials reported in March 2005
that the fledgling Upper Komati WUA was already
"struggling."
Unhappy with their treatment and what they saw as unre-
alistic expectations of DWA for the composition of WUAs,
many irrigation boards had drawn back from transforming,
resulting in a standoff with DWA.
Vignette 3: Crocodile Catchment Forum
The Crocodile Forum constitutes an attempt to establish a
multi-sectoral deliberative forum to promote collaborative
management of the lower Crocodile catchment. This is the
sort of endeavor encouraged by DWAPretoria and it is in line
with those who believed that forums developed to address
locally important issues are likely to be more durable than
those formed for a specific task whose raison d'être disap-
pears when the project is completed.
Low levels of water entering the Kruger National Park
(KNP) were adversely affecting wildlife in this ecologically
important area, and relations between the KNP and commer-
cial farmers, the main water user, had soured on ecological
grounds over the halting of a proposed barrage across the
river by the KNP. A new KNP Water Manager was appointed
in September 2003, a Ghanaian PhD with participatory expe-
rience in another South African catchment. He took steps to
reconcile opposing sides concerning the barrage and suc-
ceeded in easing long-standing tensions. Building on this
progress, he took the initiative to establish a forum uniting
local stakeholders: Transvaal Suiker Beperk (TSB) sugar
miller and White commercial sugar farmers, tourist represen-
tatives, municipal officials, elected Black councilors, and
tribal authorities (representing the rural Black population)
were to discuss water management issues. These efforts were
supported but not led by DWAregional officials (interviewed
February 2005) who thought it a "good thing" that the initia-
tive came from an affected party (KNP), giving it more legit-
imacy and credibility: "it is a people's forum."
The KNP Water Manager's time and personal effort gal-
vanized support, and the inaugural meeting in a high-end
lodge on the February 3, 2004, saw good attendance but was
unrepresentative racially, to the extent that a Representivity
Task Group was set up to investigate the racial skews. A
February 2005 meeting was attended by this researcher, at a
four star resort, with 35 to 40 attendees, but no Black repre-
sentatives were present due to local animosities between
elected councilors and tribal authorities. It seemed that the
farming and sugar sectors were present to keep abreast of
water reforms, elicit information about the CMA process,
and voice concerns in general.
The local private water company (Greater Nelspruit
Utility Company [GNUC]) supported the initiative for a
year, but by 2005 indicated it was a waste of time because "it
has no teeth," that is, it has no regulatory powers. It was clear
that without the leadership of the KNP Water Manager, the
forum would struggle. His efforts have been recognized as he
was, in March 2013, appointed the Inkomati CMA CEO.
Vignette 4: Sappi Kraft Paper Mill, Ngodwana--
Proposed Expansion and the Environmental
Response
Two participatory initiatives can be identified in this case
study: first, the Sappi Forest Liaison Forum that was
8 SAGE Open
established in 2000 and second, participation in the EIA,
required by law (Republic of South Africa, 1997), concern-
ing Sappi Kraft's proposed expansion to its Ngodwana mill.
The Sappi group--Sappi Forest is the supplier of raw materi-
als for the mill's operations--is a multi-national company
and an important source of local employment.
The concerns of stakeholders now have to be factored into
decision making, and the perceptions of local groups have
assumed a much more important role. Under the 1997 Act, a
full EIA can be avoided if the delegated authority--in this
case, the provincial government's Environment Department,
to whom decision-making power has been entrusted--is sat-
isfied that "sufficient information" was presented during the
Scoping Phase of the EIA. This is what Sappi Kraft hoped
for (Golder and Associates, 2003).
To this end, Sappi set up the Forestry Liaison Forum to try
to dispel misconceptions about its environmental record and
about the stream reduction impact of eucalyptus. Behind all
this was the desire to pave the way for the impending EIA.
This "public relations exercise," as it was perceived by com-
mitted local environmentalists (interviewed March 2005),
was instrumental in bringing together aggrieved, highly
vocal "nature-loving" individuals and local conservancy
groups and national NGOs--Geasphere, Environmental
Action Link, and Wildlife and Environment Society of South
Africa. An alliance was thus formed with professional envi-
ronmental scientists who provided strong technical under-
standing and discredited Sappi's environmental record.
Nobel and Spoor of Nelspruit and the Legal Resources
Centre, Pretoria, provided legal expertise.
The areas of discontent broadened from specific issues
such as irrigating adjacent fields with chlorinated effluent
from the mills' activities and river and air contamination, to
a more fundamental conflict over land use being played out
over the extensive and growing use of alien plantation spe-
cies (Golder and Associates, 2003). The well-organized,
technically aware, and legally astute environmental lobby
used the EIA process to convince the delegated authority
(regional Environment Department) to demand a full EIA,
which had considerable time and cost implications for Sappi
(Golder and Associates, 2006a, 2006b). This can be seen as a
victory for voluntary environmental groups over powerful
industrial interests.
Central Government concern over the implications for the
economy, however, led to new EIA regulations (announced
in April 2005 by the National Department of Environmental
Affairs and Tourism) and criticism of current public partici-
pation processes as lacking "proper guidance and often
abused." Compulsory time frames aimed to speed up the pro-
cesses, reduce costs, and "facilitate out Accelerated and
Shared Growth Initiative," indicating that economic growth
may take precedence over environmental concerns. This
proved to be the case. The final decision in favor of the
expansion was granted on February 22, 2008.
Application of the Evaluative
Framework
This section now looks to evaluate the identified initiatives
against indicators set out previously, as summarized in
Figure 3.
Process-Orientated Evaluation
Acceptance criteria.
Indicators under acceptance criteria
(refer to Table 1) have to do with procedural trust (Webler,
1995) and are by their nature subjective.
Early involvement. The consensus is participants should be
involved early on and in the creation of options--otherwise,
they may be viewed as rubber stamping exercises and a form
of manipulation in Arnstein's (1969) ladder (Middendorf
& Busch, 1997). This criterion is actually quite subjective:
For example, participation can start too early, that is, before
clarification over the scope of the initiative (Chakraborty &
Stratton, 1993).

In the CMAcase study, involvement was begun before the
1998 Act was passed or the boundaries of the Water
Management Areas clarified: Participants initially assumed,
mistakenly, that there would be three separate CMAs, one for
each of the catchments. Overall, the CMA proposal process
failed to engage representatives of all groups together at an
early stage--which affects feelings of ownership and legiti-
macy. Black representation was an issue from the outset and
it was found to be necessary to convene special homeland
meetings in local languages before Black representatives
could join already formed steering committees 6 months late.
Already disadvantaged, they would feel handicapped vis-à-
vis longer standing members. Late involvement does not
automatically disadvantage: At the CMA Advisory
Committee meeting, the White NGO latecomers were actu-
ally able to shape the direction of proceedings along with the
facilitator.
All 27 Inkomati irrigation boards had their WUA propos-
als rejected on the grounds of inclusiveness. This meant wid-
ening their coverage that necessitated bringing in people at a
later stage. Municipal representatives, for example, felt they
were presented with a fait accompli so they were reluctant to
engage.
In the case of the Crocodile Forum, extensive personal
engagement with a range of stakeholders, including tribal
authorities and Black councilors, still did not result in atten-
dance and thus involvement of any kind. Invitations do not
guarantee attendance: Local animosities, travel expenses,
and intimidating venues are all factors that determine whether
or not an invited person will in fact attend. With the Sappi
Forest Forum, early engagement happened without recourse
to special measures, as did the later EIA process.
Representative and inclusive. There are differences between
deliberative democrats who emphasize "inclusiveness," that
is, everyone involved, and the natural resource management
literature that stresses "representation" of users (Blaikie,
2006). Because everyone is a user of water, and given the
scale of the Inkomati, representation was a practical solution
to the CMA proposal process. However, in view of South
Africa's recent history, if significant groups are excluded,
then the legitimacy of such a process is threatened.
In the CMA proposal process, as noted, Black representa-
tion was a problem and the DWA local champion encoun-
tered great difficulty in identifying and engaging groups
outside recognizable organizations (easily contactable).
Early involvement of all sectors was a challenge. An inter-
pretation of DWA's sidelining of the 2000 CMA proposal
was that there could have been an Inkomati Governing Board
that reinforced the dominance of existing users and was
unrepresentative of the wider population.
The CMA Advisory Committee was inclusive and repre-
sentative, both in terms of race and gender, but was engi-
neered by DWA Pretoria. Black representation in the CMA
process overall may have been greater than appeared because
White NGOs and reform-orientated DWA officials upheld
their interests. Without such intervention and representation,
the interest of a large and poor rural population could be ren-
dered silent. However, in the long term, it may perpetuate
Black dependency.
The irrigation boards, failing representivity criteria of
DWAfor WUAs, had their proposals rejected and were asked
to enlarge their area of remit to incorporate non-agricultural
users. Consulted irrigation board representatives (six) felt the
shared vision of their current members (for example, to man-
age a canal) that made them sustainable would become lost
as a result, hence, the reluctance of many irrigation boards to
engage with the process following their initial rejection by
DWA. It took the Elands Valley irrigation board 7 years to
finally achieve the level of representation that satisfied
DWA. It is noteworthy that in the Komati and Lomati irriga-
tion boards, the White commercial farmers represented
themselves individually (about 80 on the Komati irrigation
board) whereas the Black farmers sent irrigation scheme rep-
resentatives and thus appeared a small presence at meetings,
although in fact they outnumbered the commercial farmers 5
to 1. It has been suggested that Black representatives tended
to be the elderly rather than the most dynamic, a reflection of
a largely patriarchal system.
On the Crocodile Forum, despite the exertions of the KNP
Water Manager, attendance was not racially representative
but it would most likely increase with successful land claims
in the area, as irrigated agriculture was at that time not prac-
ticed by the Black population in the lower Crocodile.
The Forestry Forum was open to the public, but the Sappi
Environmental Manager thought the meetings were domi-
nated by a "vocal minority" not representative of the wider
Inkomati population. Similarly, the EIA Scoping Report
exercise was disproportionately influenced by environmen-
talists. Evolving decision making to the local level and
encouraging local representation may, as in this instance,
give greater "voice" to minority positions.
Continuity in attendance. Ideally, the same representatives
should attend meetings to maximize the process, sustain
dialogue (Leventhal, Karuzu, & Fry, 1980), and avoid time-
wasting recaps. Lack of continuity by Black representatives
was an issue in the CMA proposal process, and observations
of the CMA Advisory Committee illustrated how disruptive
and patchy attendance proved to be with different attendees
in the morning and afternoon. This erratic attendance affects
the quality of later feedback and accountability.
With the Crocodile Forum, there was less onus to attend
when the purpose was not decision making but learning and
improved relations. Interest was beginning to wane among
some attendees, which also may affect later continuity. The
White commercial farmers, in a potentially tenuous position
in new South Africa, felt the need to keep abreast of develop-
ments that may affect them, and thus regularly attended.
Participation involves people's time, and loss of earnings and
10 SAGE Open
travel expenses may affect willingness to attend. Paid offi-
cials are in a different position altogether, and for the rela-
tively wealthy farmers, meetings may represent a social
event.
Able to voice opinions in a safe environment. Although legit-
imacy for a process may be increased by the assurance of a
respectful hearing (Smith & McDonough, 2001; Webler &
Tuler, 2000), ground rules to prevent offensive statements or
behavior can have a negative/tyrannical aspect (Kelly, 2004).
The construction of a safe environment can hinder open and
honest discussion, and multi-racial encounters may have a
falseness about them, with a suppression of private views by
both Black and White speakers, thus inadvertently frustrat-
ing a process of real change. The Komati irrigation board
chairman (February 2004) made it clear that anyone could
contribute to meetings, but those "seeking to derail processes
would be excluded."
People can be made uncomfortable by the choice of
venue: High-end tourist lodges and hotels were used by the
CMA Advisory Committee and Crocodile Forum meetings.
Participants can be deterred from voicing opinions in larger
meetings, the lingua franca (English) is often no one's first
language, and the very technical topics under discussion can
overawe attendees. In the early stages of the CMA process,
the DWA champion held meetings in local languages in the
former homeland areas to encourage willingness to talk.
Black attendees felt less comfortable on joining the larger
"invited" CMA spaces. In the Sappi EIA Scoping Report,
written submissions were encouraged, and this practice
favors the highly educated. Clearly, voice is relational to
place and context.
Influence on decision making.It is recognized that legiti-
macy is lessened for participatory processes not linked more
directly to policy making, and participants can be made to
feel they were used to give an appearance of participation
if they do not contribute to decision making: "tokenism" in
Arnstein's (1969) ladder. Even Dryzek (1990), a deliberative
democrat, recognizes that there has to be a link to decisions--
without which they risk being labeled "talking shops."
The White commercial farming sector took an active part
in the CMA process and had some say in the 2000 proposal,
although they felt "bulldozed" by the CMA champion, and
were not totally happy with it. However, they had no impact in
the direction the Advisory Committee followed nor in how it
was set up. This was engineered and manipulated with a DWA
appointed facilitator in control. It is suggested that DWAinter-
vened to make the process more legitimate in the eyes of mar-
ginal groups, fearing that the commercial farmers had
altogether too much influence at the local level. In view of the
outcome of the CMA, many from the commercial farming
sector felt that the whole process was delegitimized once they
realized they, the largest water user, had only one seat, which
may have colored their reflections on earlier processes.
Regarding the transformation of irrigation boards, DWA
became increasingly prescriptive in adjusting representation
requirements. The efforts and expense of the irrigation
boards resulted in little influence on decisions--an exclusion
acutely felt by those members who were expected to fund the
WUAs' and CMAs' operations. The forestry sector felt simi-
larly aggrieved as it struggled for a CMA seat despite paying
water use charges and attending CMA proposal meetings.
The Crocodile Forum was never about decision making
but was more about improved management through better
understanding, but "having no teeth" resulted in loss of inter-
est by the water service provider and Mbombela municipal-
ity. Similarly, the Forestry Liaison Forum saw interest
decline once the major issues had been covered. With the
Sappi EIA, legislation guaranteed response to concerns, and
influence on decision making at a local level was a strong
motivator to environmental groups.
Transparency.Procedural trust is more likely if a pro-
cess is transparent and independent of bias (Conley &
Moote, 2003). The CMA process was initially transpar-
ent but became increasingly DWA Pretoria-led rather than
user-led. The Advisory Committee was meant to be trans-
parent, neutral, and independent, but this was not the case.
The facilitator led discussions in a particular direction, DWA
Pretoria officials undoubtedly influenced proceedings, and
DWA regional officials later complained they were silenced.
The process increasingly became a "closed" space without
observers, and the final selection of the governing board
members was made without wider stakeholder consultation.
Overall, the CMA process lost legitimacy because of the way
it was conducted in the later stages when it was the Minister
who decided which nominee would be given a seat on the
CMA Governing Board.
The Crocodile Forum initiative was supported by DWA
Regional officials who believed it had greater neutrality if it
was not DWA-led. However, because there was a likely bias
toward KNP interests, there was some resentment from the
Department of Agriculture and Mpumalanga Parks Board
officials. There were no complaints from environmental
groups about the transparency of Golder Associates EIA
Scoping Report (consultants hired by Sappi Kraft).
Accountable.The CMA Advisory Committee was not
accountable to Inkomati stakeholders, many of whom were
unknowns. Their recommendations were presented as a fait
accompli without consultation, and the committee disbanded
after its recommendations and so could not be held account-
able. Representation is unavoidable in large-scale initiatives
such as the CMA, and success depends on two-way feed-
back: from the representative to community, and from the
community back to the forums via their representative. Con-
tinuity of attendance is thus desirable. Feedback appears to
be more of an issue with Black communities largely because
of the scale of the Inkomati and access to the internet. Radio
Brown 11
appears to have potential from the experiences of the Upper
Komati WUA. It is unreasonable to expect representatives to
take responsibility without adequate compensation for dis-
seminating information and collecting feedback from a large
and dispersed rural population.
Process criteria. An important practical consideration for par-
ticipatory processes is access to a range of resources that
facilitate progress, and these are less subjective than "accep-
tance" criteria.
Accessible data and information. Not only is access to infor-
mation needed for discussion, it also needs to be meaning-
fully presented (Rowe & Frewer, 2000). There are issues in
the case study area. Socio-economic data are collected at the
provincial level, not co-terminous with the Inkomati Water
Management Area, and are often out of date. In the Inkomati
area, transparent and reliable water use data have always
been a concern to Department Water Affairs. The irrigation
boards are effective custodians of these data, and opacity
has worked to their advantage and exacerbated knowledge
asymmetries in the WUA transformation processes. This also
hindered the CMA proposal process. The need to democra-
tize data has led DWA to make available via its website the
most up to date figures on water availability and use that it
has accrued. However, the digital divide means that not all
stakeholders are able to access this information, and even
then they may not understand the often technical language it
is presented in.
Referring to the CMA Advisory Committee, some Black
members lacked awareness of even the most basic geogra-
phy, and this had to be supplied in a rapid summary by the
facilitator. This lack of knowledge slowed down the process
for several months as it was realized that additional sessions
would be required.
The Sappi Kraft case study indicated that when two "data-
wise" groups are on opposing sides of a conflict, data and
science can be used to prove contradictory arguments, for
instance, the water consumption of eucalyptus.
Human resources.As the CMA was an institutionalized
process, ongoing capacity constraints within DWA (both in
caliber, number, and motivation) and staff turnover (often
the most experienced White officials move into the private
consultancy sector) interrupt the support function in the par-
ticipatory processes. Following the reallocation of the CMA
regional champion, support from the regional DWA office
was not forthcoming, to the exasperation of DWA Pretoria.
There was also concern that staff shortages at the Mpuma-
langa Environmental Department would slow down the
Sappi EIA process.
Consultants were increasingly being used to undertake
work for DWA, for example, the 1999 delineation of the
Water Management Areas, to facilitate the Advisory
Committee, to assist the CMA Governing Board in the
drafting of a catchment management strategy, and in highly
technical undertakings such as satellite verification of water
use. Many of these processes were not participatory, which
raises the issue of accountability and transparency.
Material resources. Visual aids are valuable for furthering
understanding and were provided by the hotel venues used
by the Crocodile Forum and the CMA Advisory Commit-
tee. This category needs to be broadened to include financial
assistance with travel costs to attend meetings. The Komati
irrigation board did provide travel expenses for Black attend-
ees, as did the CMA proposal processes. There are mixed
feelings over this: There is a wariness of encouraging "career
representatives" who come merely to collect money, and the
KNP Water Manager felt that pre-payment would not guar-
antee attendance and input to the Crocodile Forum.
Adequate time.Where previously disadvantaged people
are involved, adequate time is needed to make informed and
considered recommendations, and avoid the label of a fait
accompli. The irrigation boards illustrate this: The 6-month
time frame of the 1998 Act to transform was unrealistic,
especially as ever wider inclusion was required. Nkomazi
municipal representatives, included later in the Komati irri-
gation board proposal process, understandably complained
they were not given enough time to consider the WUA pro-
posal. The CMA proposal was the result of numerous meet-
ings from July 1997 to September 2000. In contrast, the CMA
Advisory Committee was hastily convened and became a
scramble to meet a political deadline: a CMA to be in place
before the 2004 election.
Without consultation, decisions can be swift--for example,
the 19 Water ManagementAreas were delineated in a month in
1999. Deliberative processes can by their nature be protracted,
but the government recognized there was potential for abuse
that may harm the economy, as in the Sappi EIA delays. This
is behind the drive to speed up the EIA processes.
Clear task and definition. There needs to be awareness of
the purpose and plan of an initiative; otherwise, expectations
may be unduly raised, time invested is wasted, and ultimately,
there is a loss of interest. Once the Water Management Area
was delineated, the CMA proposal process had clarity. The
Sappi EIA and the CMA Advisory Committee had a distinct
purpose. However, once the raison d'être disappears, for
example, when the CMA Reference Group had submitted its
proposal, the pattern is that members disengage. The scope
of the irrigation board transformation process was less clear,
and irrigation board representatives complained of lack of
clarity from DWA Pretoria.
Products of participation. "Tangible" or "intangible" products
should not be viewed as an end goal of participation, but as
important components for Participatory Governance--itself
a mid-term outcome of participatory processes.
12 SAGE Open
Tangible products. The 2000 Inkomati CMAproposal is an
example of a "tangible" product, the result of a participatory
process. The CMA that was nominally launched in March
2004 and the Governing Board approved in September 2005
constitute a new representative organization, but it was the
work of the DWA-engineered representative Advisory Com-
mittee: It did not build on the original participatory CMA
proposal process. The Sappi EIA process resulted in the pro-
duction of a Scoping Report that is in the public domain. All
27 irrigation boards produced a WUAproposal--a product--
and all were rejected. It took the Elands Valley irrigation
board 7 years and four attempts to get a proposal accepted.
Intangible products. It is important to stress that for some
participatory initiatives, their objectives lie in the realm of
intangible products. Improved relations and learning were
the goals of the Crocodile and Forestry Liaison Forums.
Through the Crocodile Forum, the KNP Water Manager
succeeded in changing the perceptions of commercial farm-
ers about the KNP, hitherto seen as obstructive. Attendees
were already well informed, but co-operation and under-
standing resulted. The forum was not successful in engaging
Black representatives. The Forestry Liaison Forum did not
achieve improved relations with environmentalists; rather, it
strengthened opposition resulting in a coordinated assault on
the Sappi Kraft expansion plan.
In the context of South Africa, any bringing together of
previously segregated groups is to be applauded. The CMA
proposal process did bring Black representation to the steer-
ing committees after separate homeland preparatory meet-
ings had taken place. At these meetings, breakaway smaller
group discussions were more successful in building social
trust than larger meetings.
Regarding irrigation boards, only the Elands Valley irri-
gation board chairman made a determined effort to engage
with outside groups, not the irrigation board as a whole.
Although the Upper Komati WUA proposal was accepted, its
formation did not physically unite Black and White farmers.
Rather, the champion met with the different groups in their
own areas. The Black communities did speak but in their
own language, and on their own ground. The White farmers,
who were not previously organized into irrigation boards,
came together, and that can be seen as progress. Other irriga-
tion boards have made no progress with improving relations
and have even antagonized municipalities, as was the case
with the Lomati and Komati irrigation boards in the lower
Komati.
The Black representatives who attended the Komati and
Lomati meetings have learnt something of the CMA process
and some management issues, especially as the Komati irri-
gation board chairman ensured meetings were held in English
and Siswati, and extra time was made available for educa-
tional purposes. However, relations between the racial
groups in times of water stress became strained and partici-
pation has not created trust.
Processes, techniques, and their products/outputs are
important. However, for many evaluators, this is where the
evaluative effort draws to an end, and many of the intangible
products touched on above are presented as evidence of sus-
tainable outcomes. However, they are not, and the objective
of this evaluation is to look whether, through participatory
governance, substantive sustainable outcomes in terms of
conditions on the ground are being delivered in the Inkomati.
Participatory Governance Outcome Evaluation
There are organs of participatory governance in place in the
Inkomati--the CMA and two WUAs--although whether
they are the product of participatory processes is a moot
point. The indicators from Table 2 are now applied to the
vignettes.
Representatives are active in discussions and make substantive
and meaningful contributions. Deliberation lies at the heart of
the participatory paradigm, and ability to contribute is linked
to capacity and social capital. Representation at meetings or
organizations can be engineered, but mere presence does not
guarantee substantive and meaningful contributions, that is,
active participation (Wilson & Perret, 2010).
The CMA Governing Board was heavily weighted toward
Black and environmental interests, which affects voting, but
it cannot guarantee that there will be substantive inputs into
how water in the Inkomati should be managed. The differ-
ence in education and experience of water management
between the commercial farming representative and other
members on the Inkomati Governing Board is evident from
CVs of members, summarized in Brown (2011).
Discussions in March 2007 with a U.K. Environment
Agency manager, who was leading a capacity-building proj-
ect with the Inkomati CMA Board, suggested that the Board
was still in its infancy, and that capacity had to be built first.
It can be inferred from this that the Board was still some way
off planning and managing the water resources together.
Reports indicate that by 2011, it was only nominally opera-
tional and was focusing on developing its management strat-
egy with the aid of consultants.
Turning to the two established WUAs, the DWA
Mpumalanga Deputy Director for Water Resource
Management, suggested (March 2005) that the establishment
of WUAs was the easy part, and it is now that the "work
starts." This seems to mirror the CMA--that once estab-
lished they take considerable time to become fully opera-
tional. Experience from the Upper Komati WUA proposal
process indicated that Black attendees at proposal meetings
were active, but these were held in former homeland areas
and in Siswati. How active will Black representatives be in
meetings held in English at venues likely to be outside their
locale? Observations of the multi-racial CMA Advisory
Committee indicated that contributions from the Black rep-
resentatives, even the chairman, were minimal and even then
Brown 13
only at the direct prompting of the facilitator, and they
appeared to just accede to the facilitator. There were substan-
tive contributions from resourced stakeholders in both the
Sappi Kraft case study and the Crocodile Catchment Forum;
however, the goal of the latter was improved relations, and
the initiatives were not racially representative.
Discussion and negotiation leads to consensus over planning and
managing of resources.To plan and manage the resource,
there is a need through negotiation (which may oscillate
between conflict and consensus) to reach a level of agree-
ment over possible options, and in a water-stressed area,
such as the Inkomati, this will inevitably involve some con-
cessions. The CMA is still in its infancy, so it is not possible
to know today what kind of negotiations are taking place.
However, it could be a matter for concern that it is based on
sectoral representation, which can "entrench difference and
hinder cooperation" (Tewdwr-Jones & Allmendinger, 1998),
so making concessions may be seen as failing one's
constituents.
Habermasian's (1984) ideas that consensus will ultimately
result from negotiations may not bear out in reality: It depends
on the range of stakeholders involved. For example, the
Komati irrigation board meetings are more a case of Black
representatives ceding to commercial farmers because of
technical complexity. Similarly, with the CMA Advisory
Committee. Forsyth (2003) suggests "it seems reasonable to
expect that different social groupings have different environ-
mental perceptions and framings" (p. 83). Stakeholders may
hold diametrically opposing views on man­nature relations
and how the environment should be managed: from an instru-
mental view on nature, often associated with industrialists, to
an eco-centric environmentalist perspective. Thus, with two
equally resourced sets of stakeholders, with radically differ-
ent views of nature, consensus may never result from discus-
sions because they share little common ground. The Sappi
Kraft case study exemplifies this. It is not an example of par-
ticipatory governance but is an out-and-out conflict between
industrialists trying to contain the EIA process and the coun-
ter-containing efforts of the environmentalists (Few, 2001).
The new representative organizations have the power to imple-
ment changes,and changes are made. What is of interest is the
kinds of powers these new representative institutions have at
their disposal to effect outcomes. Without powers, participa-
tory spaces are in danger of being seen as "talking shops"
and lack legitimacy (Tewdwr-Jones & Allmendinger, 1998).
The reallocation of water-use licenses is one of the most
important powers and functions of a CMA. The Inkomati
was designated a compulsory licensing zone because it is so
water stressed. This once-only responsibility has been ceded
to DWA Pretoria because the CMA is still in its infancy:
Thus, the most important power and tool for redress has been
lost to the CMA.
The irrigation boards have actually enjoyed a high level
of power in the day-to-day management of water at the micro
level. Ironically, the 1998 Act is taking power away from the
local level and vesting it at the Water ManagementArea level
with the CMA. Of concern also was the ambiguous volun-
tary status of WUAs that may contravene one of Ostrom's
(1990) "design principles" for sustainable institutions: If the
membership of institutions is not clearly defined or bounded,
it is very difficult to impose sanctions.
Accountable. Representative organizations need to be held
accountable to their constituents (Agrawal & Ribot, 1999).
The CMA Governing Board was not directly elected, but
the Minister made the selections from nominations. They
may therefore feel more accountable to government than the
sector they represent. The desirable downward accountabil-
ity is likely to pose problems for the Potential Agricultural
Water Use representative on the CMA Governing Board,
because their constituents are not yet water users, and thus
not organized around water nor are they members of WUAs.
Accountability needs to be linked to practical considerations.
When the potential users may come from a distant part of
the catchment, several hours' travel away and speak a differ-
ent African language, how is it practical to hold "surgeries?"
These arrangements rely on the assumption that there is one
Black population.
Sustainable Development Outcome Evaluation
Referring back to Figure 1, the CMA and WUA case studies
indicate that progress has stalled at the stage of establishing
representative organizations (products). These have taken a
long time to establish, and even now, the CMA has no real
powers to effect redress and achieve social sustainability.
Thus, it is not possible to assess whether participatory initia-
tives will result in more sustainable outcomes. However, this
should not deter attempts to put in place a framework for
evaluation for a time when there are discernible changes.
The ultimate goal of the participatory initiative embodied
in the 1998 Act was redress, and environmental protection
as well as economic growth, so it seems reasonable to use
these three pillars of sustainability as a framework against
which to measure achievement. All three are needed for bal-
anced development (Baker, 2006). However, when the
resource is in short supply, as it is in the Inkomati, and all
three aspects of sustainability can make legitimate demands
on it, tensions are inevitable. Redress in the Inkomati may
only be achieved if water is reallocated away from the (rela-
tively) efficient commercial farming sector. In this context,
the price of social sustainability could be the upset of eco-
nomic sustainability and goes some way to explain the pre-
varication of the government over redistribution. Similarly,
the economy may suffer if the vocal environmentalists are
allowed to derail industrial expansion. What these instances
suggest is that there is a tendency in the South Africa
Government to put economic sustainability first, which may
ultimately reinforce inequalities in this already highly ineq-
uitable country.
14 SAGE Open
Any evaluation of progress is seriously hampered by an
absence of baseline data--an oversight we have noted with
the rolling out of participatory programs. It might be useful
in South Africa to work on this forthwith, so there are statis-
tics available at the appropriate scale for when outcomes
start to show. Too many indicators becomes unwieldy and
impractical to collect and analyze (Bell & Morse, 1999), and
given the human resources situation in SouthAfrica, this also
needs to be borne in mind.
Key Findings of the Evaluative Framework
The strength of the evaluative framework is that it allowed
for careful and methodical analysis of four different partici-
patory initiatives in South Africa and for general conclusions
to be drawn. The framework assists in answering the follow-
ing important question: If the rationale is that top-down mod-
els failed, what is the evidence that participatory efforts will
result in more sustainable outcomes in South Africa? The
framework also importantly clarifies the distinction between
processes, products, and outcomes that has often become
blurred in the literature, and thus allows researchers, practi-
tioners, and decision makers to track progress toward the
ultimate goal of the initiative.
Time emerges as an important factor from the vignettes
presented. The CMA and WUA case studies illustrate how
long it takes to establish representative organs of governance.
Indeed, the analysis demonstrates that progress has stalled at
the stage of establishing new representative institutions (the
product of participatory processes). The rural Black popula-
tion has yet to see any meaningful change, and it is unlikely
the CMA will be in a position to effect redistribution in the
near future. The CMA vignette suggests that decisions are
more expedient when they are not participatory--for exam-
ple, the original (1999) delineation of the 19 Water
Management Areas by consultants. The argument is that they
are not transparent, but neither was the supposedly participa-
tory Inkomati Advisory Committee, as the CMA vignette
demonstrated. The Sappi Kraft vignette also suggests that
participatory efforts considerably slow down decision mak-
ing, which could have an impact on the economy. Moreover,
participatory efforts have the potential to give undue power
to a vocal minority at the expense of the majority and are
open to manipulation. In the case of the CMA vignette, the
interventions by DWA Pretoria officials to stave off elite cap-
ture of the CMA process, the ceding of Black representatives
to more vocal White participants in heterogeneous meetings,
and the dependence on White NGO representation, all under-
line the need for a reduction in knowledge and power asym-
metries before meaningful participation can take place.
However, given the legacy of educational disparities and
petty discrimination resulting from apartheid policies, this
rebalancing may take one or two generations to accomplish.
Is this realistic or even fair given South Africa's history?
Williams (2004) suggests we now need to ask ourselves
"what longer term political value do participatory processes
have for the poor?" (p. 568).
Leadership emerges from the analysis as being hugely
important: Individuals with particular personal qualities are
behind the CMAproposal process, the two approved WUApro-
posals, and the Crocodile Forum. It may not accord with notions
of community action, but remove it, and initiatives flounder.
The need to evaluate both processes and outcomes is clear,
but Conley and Moote (2003) are right that it is a "daunting
task" (p. 374), and as one moves from processes toward out-
comes, the difficulties intensify. The vignettes also demon-
strate the real difficulty of measuring the outcomes of
participatory efforts, which also partly explains the dearth of
process- and outcome-orientated evaluations. A constraint
of the framework has been the dearth of baseline data col-
lected prior to the initiation of participatory efforts, which
does compromise evaluations. This is in part due to the
unwavering faith in the power of participation to yield results.
Ultimately, the evaluative framework (Figure 1) reminds
us that sustainable outcomes and not stages along the way
are the ultimate goal of the many participatory efforts, and
thus the measure of their success. When applied to the CMA
and WUA case studies, the evaluative framework demon-
strates that the initiatives have not progressed in a linear
fashion from process criteria to sustainable outcomes:
Rather, their journey has been iterative, coming to a halt with
participatory governance institutions, then turning back to
try to perfect approaches, particularly representation. Those
practitioners with a dogged faith that participation will
deliver in the end see "`getting the techniques right' [as] the
principal way of ensuring the success of such approaches"
(Glicken, 2000, p. 36, Cleaver, 2001). This is clearly exem-
plified with the action of DWA Pretoria in both the establish-
ment of the CMA and approval of WUA proposals. It is thus
unsurprising that many researchers have also focused on pro-
cess evaluations because as this study illustrates, they are
easier to undertake. Perfecting participatory processes lies in
the realms of the possible, and as Medawar (1967) reminds
us "[i]f politics is the art of the possible, research is surely the
art of the soluble. Both are immensely practical-minded
affairs" (p. 7). Sustainability outcome evaluations take us
into uncomfortable and uncharted territory. Nonetheless, it is
hoped that the evaluative framework and the lack of sustain-
able outcomes they lay bare may force decision makers to
acknowledge that the participatory experiment is flawed and
instead to consider policies that can yield redress and sus-
tainable management in a more expedient fashion.
