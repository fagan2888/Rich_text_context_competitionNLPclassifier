Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the impact of the peritoneal glucose load (PGL) on hydration status and
inflammation in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.
Methods: This cross-sectional study evaluated stable PD patients using a novel PGL index (PGLI),
which was calculated as the net glucose content (g) in the PD solutions administered in the daily PD
prescription divided by the dry body weight (kg) assessed by whole-body bioimpedance
spectroscopy. The relationship between PGLI and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c
), fluid
overload (FO), and inflammatory markers was investigated.
Results: A total of 43 stable PD patients participated in the study. Significant positive correlations
were found between PGLI and HbA1c
, FO, plasma high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and
plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. HbA1c
, FO, plasma hsCRP and plasma IL-6 levels were
significantly higher in patients with PGLI >3 g/kg/day compared with those with PGLI 3 g/kg/day.
Conclusions: PGLI values >3 g/kg/day may be associated with poor glycaemic control, over
hydration and augmented inflammation. PGLI might be a useful tool for the quantitative assessment
of the PGL and could be applied when managing PD patients.

Introduction
Peritoneal glucose load (PGL) contributes
to the development of cumulative peritoneal
membrane damage and increased perme-
ability, leading to fluid accumulation and
stimulation of the inflammatory process that
is related to the early coronary atheroscler-
osis seen in peritoneal dialysis (PD)
patients.1­3 Cardiovascular (CV) complica-
tions are the main cause of morbidity and
mortality in patients with end-stage renal
disease and dialysis patients.1,2
Diabetes mellitus is a well known trad-
itional CV risk factor in the general popu-
lation as well as in patients undergoing
maintenance dialysis.4­8 Poor glycaemic
control (glycosylated haemoglobin [HbA1c
]
!8%) in PD patients appears to be asso-
ciated with higher mortality.9 Glucose
absorption from PD solutions also contrib-
utes to the harmful effects on the metabolic
profile and hydration status.10­12 Some
observational studies showed a higher risk
for death in older diabetic PD patients
compared with those on haemodialysis.13
Therefore, reducing the PGL is particularly
important in PD patients to reduce the
risk for progression of CV complications.
Previous studies have shown that
fluid overload (FO) and PGL may contrib-
ute to the development of hypertension,
left ventricular hypertrophy and
atherosclerosis.14­17
Chronic inflammation is common in PD
patients and considered a very powerful
predictor of the development of CV disease
and mortality in the general population as
well as in people with chronic kidney dis-
ease.18­24 FO in PD patients stimulates the
inflammatory process.25­27 Furthermore,
the inflammatory process itself can cause
an increase in peritoneal membrane perme-
ability and fluid accumulation.26
The present study aimed to evaluate the
impact of PGL on hydration status and
inflammation in stable PD patients using a
novel PGL index (PGLI).
Patients and methods
Study design
This cross-sectional study enrolled stable
patients who had received maintenance PD
for 12­76 months in the Department of
Nephrology and Hypertension, Peritoneal
Dialysis Unit, Western Galilee Hospital,
Nahariya, Israel between 1 June 2011 and
31 March 2012. Congestive heart failure,
liver cirrhosis, and any evidence of infection
in the 3 months prior to enrolment (i.e.
tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis B or C, urinary,
periodontal, or pulmonary infections, and
peritonitis), high or low transport peritoneal
membrane characteristics, and age <18
years were considered exclusion criteria.
The study protocol was approved by the
Medical Ethics Committee of Western
Galilee Hospital (no. 13211). All patients
signed a written informed consent form
before participating in the study. All
patients followed their usual recommended
diet and continued their permanent medica-
tions and peritoneal dialysis regimen.
Biochemical analyses
Blood samples for HbA1c
were collected
without anticoagulant or centrifugation and
were then evaluated using a Sebia haemo-
globin kit (Sebia, Lisses, France). Blood
samples for serum albumin analysis were
collected without anticoagulant, then cen-
trifuged at 3200 g for 10 min at room tem-
perature using a MegafugeÕ 1.0 R centrifuge
(Heraeus Instruments, Osterode, Germany)
and were then evaluated using the
CAPILLARYS HbA1c
kit according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Abbott
Laboratories, Chicago, IL, USA).
Blood samples for plasma high sensitivity
C-reactive protein (hsCRP) analysis were
collected with 1.8 mg/ml ethylenediaminete-
tra-acetic acid (EDTA), then centrifuged at
3200 g for 10 min at room temperature using
a MegafugeÕ 1.0 R centrifuge (Heraeus
Instruments) and were then evaluated
Hassan et al. 43
using CRP Vario kit according to the manu-
facturer's instructions (Sentinel Diagnostics,
Milan, Italy). Blood samples for plasma
interleukin-6 (IL-6) analysis were collected
with 1.8 mg/ml EDTA, then centrifuged at
3200 g for 10 min at room temperature using
a MegafugeÕ 1.0 R centrifuge (Heraeus
Instruments) and were then stored at ­
20C until they were evaluated using a
human IL-6 High Sensitivity enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay kit according
to the manufacturer's instructions (Bender
MedSystems, Vienna, Austria).
Calculation of the PGLI
The PGL was assessed by using a novel PGL
index (PGLI) (g/kg/day), which refers to the
net glucose content (monohydrated or unhy-
drated) (g) in the PD solutions administered
in the daily PD prescription divided by the
dry body weight (kg) assessed by whole-
body bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS):
PGLI ðg=kg=dayÞ
¼
Daily glu cos e content in
peritoneal dialysis solutions ðgÞ
 
Dry weight assessed by
bioimpedance spectroscopy ðkgÞ
 
Assessment of the hydration status
The hydration status was assessed by a safe,
simple, repetitive, reliable and noninvasive
whole-body BIS technique using a Fresenius
Medical Care Body Composition Monitor
(BCM) device (Fresenius Medical Care, Bad
Homburg, Germany).28 Fluid overload was
defined as the excess of fluids (l) in the
whole-body as assessed by using the BCM
device.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
the SPSSÕ statistical package, version 19.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. Quantitative variables were
described as mean Æ SD. Qualitative vari-
ables were described using frequencies and
percentages. Correlations between HbA1c
,
PGLI, plasma hsCRP and plasma IL-6
levels, and serum albumin levels were
described using Pearson's or Spearman's
correlation coefficient test. Independent
t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used
to compare quantitative variables between
groups. Hierarchical multiple regression
and receiver operating characteristics
(ROC) curves were used to evaluate the
influence of PGLI on FO, hsCRP and IL-6.
A P-value 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
This cross-sectional study evaluated 43
stable PD patients. The characteristics of
the study population are summarized in
Table 1.
Statistically significant positive correl-
ations were found between the PGLI and
HbA1c
levels (Pearson's correlation coeffi-
cient test, P < 0.001, r ¼ 0.94), fluid load
(Spearman's correlation coefficient test,
P < 0.001, r ¼ 0.89), plasma hsCRP levels
(Spearman's correlation coefficient test,
P < 0.001, r ¼ 0.92) and plasma IL-6 levels
(Spearman's correlation coefficient test,
P < 0.001, r ¼ 0.88) (Figures 1­4).
The results of the present study revealed
that the cut-off of PGLI that was associated
with FO > 1.0 l, HbA1c
>7%, plasma
hsCRP level >5 mg/dl and plasma IL-6
level >1.2 pg/ml was 3 g/kg/day (sensitivity
81­84%, specificity 85­94%, P < 0.001).
HbA1c
, FO, plasma hsCRP and plasma
IL-6 levels were significantly higher in
patients with PGLI >3 g/kg/day compared
with patients with PGLI 3 g/kg/day
(P < 0.001 for all comparisons; Table 2).
HbA1c
, PGLI, plasma hsCRP, plasma IL-6
and FO values were significantly higher in

patients with diabetes mellitus compared
with nondiabetic patients (P 0.05 for all
comparisons; Table 3). No significant cor-
relations between the analysed parameters
and the dry weight were observed.
A comparison of the parameters between
diabetic patients with PGLI 3 g/kg/day and
diabetic patients with PGLI >3 g/kg/day
demonstrated that FO, plasma hsCRP and
plasma IL-6 values were significantly higher
in diabetic patients with PGLI >3 g/kg/day
(P < 0.001 for all comparisons; Table 4).
A comparison of the parameters between
diabetic patients with PGLI 3 g/kg/day and
nondiabetic patients with PGLI >3 g/kg/day
demonstrated that FO, plasma hsCRP and
plasma IL-6 values were significantly
higher in nondiabetic patients with PGLI
>3 g/kg/day (P 0.05 for all comparisons).
A comparison of the parameters between
nondiabetic patients with PGLI 3 g/kg/day
and nondiabetic patients with PGLI >3 g/
kg/day demonstrated that FO, plasma
hsCRP and plasma IL-6 values were signifi-
cantly higher in nondiabetic patients with
PGLI >3 g/kg/day (P 0.002 for all com-
parisons). A comparison of the parameters
between diabetic patients with PGLI 3 g/
kg/day and nondiabetic patients with PGLI
3 g/kg/day demonstrated that FO, plasma
hsCRP and plasma IL-6 values were similar
in both groups.
Hierarchical multiple regression analysis
revealed that PGLI significantly influenced
FO, plasma hsCRP and plasma IL-6
(P < 0.001 for all comparisons). This influ-
ence was maintained when diabetes was
added as a confounder (P < 0.001). ROC
curves were applied to determine the validity
of the influence of PGLI on FO, plasma
hsCRP and plasma IL-6 (Table 5; Figure 5).
Discussion
It is well known that diabetes mellitus is the
most prominent cause of chronic kidney
disease and is considered the major primary
renal disease in dialysis patients. Out of a
total of 43 patients enrolled in the present
study, 20 (46.5%) had diabetes mellitus as
the primary renal disease. This percentage of
diabetic patients is similar to that observed
in the majority of dialysis units and
reflects the high proportion of diabetic
patients requiring renal replacement ther-
apy. Therefore, this present cross-sectional
study included both patients with diabetes as
well as nondiabetic patients. The significant
positive correlations between the PGLI and

HbA1c
, FO, plasma hsCRP and plasma IL-6
levels suggest that when PD patients receive
more glucose to their peritoneal cavity, this
might impair their glycaemic control, result
in a higher FO and it may exaggerate their
inflammatory status.
In the present study, the hydration status
was assessed accurately by whole-body
bioimpedance spectroscopy and the periton-
eal glucose load was determined accurately
using PGLI. PGL leads to the development
of cumulative peritoneal damage that
appears over time as a result of prolonged
exposure to glucose, glucose degradation
products generated during glucose-based
peritoneal dialysis solution (GBPDS) steril-
ization, advanced glycation end products,
non-physiological pH and as a result of a
higher incidence of peritonitis among PD
patients receiving GBPDS.15­18 The periton-
eal membrane damage activates two vicious
circles: first, the increased permeability of
the damaged peritoneal membrane leads to
fluid accumulation that necessitates utiliza-
tion of hypertonic PD solutions leading to
higher PGL and so on (Figure 6). Secondly,
the peritoneal membrane damage, increased
membrane permeability and fluid accumu-
lation stimulate the inflammatory pro-
cess.15­18 Inflammation, in turn, enhances
peritoneal membrane impairment and
permeability leading to more fluid accumu-
lation and so forth (Figure 6).26 Moreover,
the inflammatory process provoked by the
impaired peritoneal membrane aggravates
the peritoneal membrane damage leading to
more inflammation with all that entails
(Figure 6). Utilization of hypertonic
GBPDS, FO and chronic inflammation are
common problems in PD patients that con-
tribute to the development of CV disease
(Figure 6).18­24
This present study demonstrated that
HbA1c
, PGLI, plasma hsCRP, plasma IL-6
and FO values were significantly higher in
patients with diabetes mellitus compared
with the nondiabetic patients. The impact
of the presence of diabetes mellitus on
hydration status and inflammation in PD
patients was evaluated in previous studies.
For example, in a cross-sectional cohort of
639 patients from 28 centres in six European
countries, which used the same BCM device
as the present study to assess volume status,
diabetes mellitus was shown to be associated
with higher relative tissue hydration.29
Moreover, diabetic PD patients were more

likely to have inflammation than nondia-
betic patients, and they presented with
elevated hsCRP.30 To the best of our know-
ledge, the impact of the PGL, assessed
accurately by PGLI, on hydration status
and inflammation in PD patients has not
been evaluated in previous studies. The
results of the present study demonstrated
that the PGLI, as well as the presence of
diabetes mellitus, may affect the hydration
status and inflammation in PD patients.
Higher PGLI in diabetic patients may pro-
vide an explanation for why diabetic PD
patients had higher levels of HbA1c
, inflam-
matory cytokine levels and FO. Diabetic PD
patients, especially in cases with poor gly-
caemic control, frequently need higher
GBPDS concentrations that contribute to
higher PGLI, more glucose absorption from
the peritoneal dialysis fluid, leading to
higher HbA1c
, more peritoneal membrane
damage, increased membrane permeability,
stimulation of the inflammatory process and
fluid accumulation.9­12 No significant cor-
relations between the analysed parameters
and the dry weight were observed in the
present study.
The present study demonstrated that FO,
plasma hsCRP and plasma IL-6 values were
significantly higher among diabetic patients
with PGLI >3 g/kg/day compared with dia-
betic patients with PGLI 3 g/kg/day,
which suggests that the PGLI tool may be
useful when applied in diabetic PD patients.
The present study also demonstrated that
FO, plasma hsCRP and plasma IL-6 values
were significantly higher in nondiabetic
patients with PGLI >3 g/kg/day compared
with diabetic patients with PGLI 3 g/kg/
day, but the values of the tested parameters
were lower than the values in diabetic
patients with PGLI >3 g/kg/day. These
present results suggest that a PGLI >3 g/
kg/day had a greater negative impact on
hydration status and inflammation than the
presence of diabetes mellitus per se in dia-
betic PD patients who are known a priori to
Figure 5. Receiver operating characteristics
(ROC) curves were applied to determine the validity
of the influence of peritoneal glucose load index
(PGLI) on fluid overload (FO), plasma high sensitivity
C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and plasma interleukin-6

influenced all of these parameters.

have higher tissue hydration and are more
likely to have inflammation than nondia-
betic patients.29,30
The present study demonstrated that the
FO, plasma hsCRP and plasma IL-6 values
were significantly higher in nondiabetic
patients with PGLI >3 g/kg/day compared
with nondiabetic patients with PGLI 3 g/
kg/day, suggesting that the PGLI tool may
be useful when applied in nondiabetic PD
patients. The present study also demon-
strated that the FO, plasma hsCRP and
plasma IL-6 values in diabetic patients with
PGLI 3 g/kg/day and in nondiabetic PD
patients with PGLI 3 g/kg/day were
similar, which suggests that PGLI >3 g/kg/
day had a greater impact on hydration
status and inflammation than the presence
of diabetes mellitus alone.
It is inaccurate to conclude that higher
PGLI had an influence on FO and inflam-
matory status (plasma hsCRP, plasma IL-6)
without excluding the effect of diabetes as a
confounder, so hierarchical multiple regres-
sion and ROC curve analyses were applied,
which demonstrated that PGLI significantly
influenced FO, plasma hsCRP and
plasma IL-6. This influence was main-
tained when diabetes was added as a
confounder.
Figure 6. The vicious circles initiated by an increase in peritoneal glucose load (PGL) that lead to peritoneal
membrane impairment, fluid overload, augmentation of inflammation, and eventually increased cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality.
Hassan et al. 51
The results of the present study revealed
that the cut-off of PGLI that was associated
with FO >1.0 l, HbA1c
>7%, plasma hsCRP
level >5 mg/dl and plasma IL-6 level
>1.2 pg/ml was 3 g/kg/day (sensitivity 81­
84%, specificity 85­94%, P < 0.001). Values
of PGLI 3 g/kg/day seem to be appropriate
but values >3 g/kg/day may be associated
with FO and augmented inflammation that
are considered well known risk factors for
CV morbidity and mortality in patients with
end-stage renal disease and on maintenance
dialysis.
The findings of this present study showed
that the PGLI may be a promising, simple,
inexpensive, noninvasive and practical tool
for the quantitative assessment and moni-
toring of the PGL and may be considered in
managing diabetic as well in nondiabetic PD
patients at the bedside or in an outpatient
clinic. Management of PD patients is usually
carried out by the patients themselves and
sometimes by one of their family members.
Consequently, patients, their relatives,
family physicians and nephrologists should
cooperate together in managing PD patients
and all of them could easily use the PGLI
tool for the assessment of the PGL, hydra-
tion status and inflammation.
The present study had a number of
limitations and should be considered a
pilot study that was conducted in a single
centre and included a relatively small
number of patients. Additional larger multi-
centre, randomized control trials with more
homogenous groups are needed to deter-
mine the target objectives of PGLI.
In conclusion, PGLI values >3 g/kg/day
may be associated with poor glycaemic
control, over hydration and augmented
inflammation in stable PD patients. PGLI
seems to be a simple, inexpensive, noninva-
sive and practical tool for the quan-
titative assessment of the PGL that could
be used during the management of PD
patients.
