Introduction
Cigarette smoking is the single most important cause of
avoidable premature mortality in the world, and quitting is
known to rapidly reduce the risk of serious diseases (World
Health Organization (WHO), 2008). Death is mainly
caused by lung cancer, coronary heart disease, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, and stroke (Doll et
al.,
2004; US Department of Health Human Services, 2004).
The risk of serious disease diminishes rapidly after quitting
and permanent abstinence is known to reduce the risk of
illness (Lightwood and Glantz, 1997; US Department of
Health Human Services, 1990). Offering help to people
addicted to nicotine is one of the six policies identified by
the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control
(FCTC) to expand the fight against the tobacco epidemic
(WHO, 2009). However, smoking cessation turned out to
be anything but simple, and for this reason, more and more
clinicians and researchers consider it a complex learning
process by nature (Lee etal., 2012).
Unfortunately, about 80
percent of smokers have no
immediate intention to quit (Herzog and Blagg, 2007).
The efficacy of smoking cessation interventions in vari-
ous clinical settings has been well documented, and studies
have demonstrated that personal motivation (Curry etal.,
1989; Lennox and Taylor, 1994) and ongoing support
(Sinclair etal., 1995) can further improve smoking cessa-
tion rates. Community pharmacies have increased the

Abstract
This study evaluated the effect of training pharmacists in the stage-of-change model for smoking cessation and motivational
interviewing on smoking cessation outcomes. A training based on the stage-of-change model for smoking cessation and
motivational interviewing was introduced to pharmacists. Pharmacists were randomly assigned to the intervention or
control group. The control group attended a 3-hour training session, whereas the intervention group also attended a
further 6-hour training session. At week 24, 12.2percent of the smokers quit smoking in the intervention group, whereas
1.6percent of the smokers quit smoking in the control group. The findings of this study showed that training pharmacists,
in the stage-of-change model for smoking cessation and motivational interviewing, improves smoking reduction and
cessation rates.

accessibility of smoking cessation treatments such as
"over-the-counter" (OTC) nicotine replacement therapy
(NRT). In a preliminary study focused on experiences of
customers in a community pharmacy setting (Sinclair etal.,
1995), three-quarters of NRT users interviewed recalled
having received some counseling from the pharmacist and/
or the pharmacy assistant, and almost all of these customers
felt that the counseling was helpful. However, more than a
quarter did not recall receiving any counseling, and most of
these customers reported they would have valued some
smoking cessation counseling from a pharmacist.
Most pharmacists are eager to undertake a leading role
in health promotion (Bond et
al., 1993; Mertinez et
al.,
1993; National Audit Office, 1992). However, concerns
have been raised that pharmacists are not trained for smok-
ing cessation counseling and their advice may conflict with
advice given from a patient's general medical practitioner
(Eaton and Webb, 1979; Roberts, 1988).
Training hospital doctors, general practitioners, and
nurses in promoting and sustaining behavioral change
among their patients has been shown to be effective for pro-
moting smoking cessation (Cornuz etal., 2002; Tønnesen
etal., 2007; Wallace-Bell, 2003).
This randomized controlled study, conducted in pharma-
cies in Sicily, Italy, evaluated the effect on pharmacy cus-
tomers' cessation outcomes when pharmacists were trained
in the stage-of-change model for smoking cessation (Di
Clemente, 2001) and motivational interviewing (MI)
(Miller and Rollnick, 2013).
In this model, proposed by Prochaska and Di Clemente
and colleagues, change is conceptualized as a process
occurring in five stages: precontemplation, contemplation,
preparation for action, action, and maintenance. In the con-
text of cigarette addiction, the stage-of-change model pro-
poses "stage-matched interventions" to treat cigarette
addiction. It is hypothesized that smokers progress linearly
through the five stages and may relapse to earlier stages.
Each stage is characterized by the presence of divergent
beliefs and attitudes toward smoking behavior. This model
may assist in determining the type and range of interven-
tions required by pharmacy personnel and tailoring inter-
ventions to the smoker's current stage which may increase
their likelihood of quitting (Di Clemente, 2001).
MI is widely used to help smokers quit. It is a patient-
centered counseling approach for helping people to explore
and resolve their ambivalence about changing their smok-
ing behavior. Evidence suggests that MI by general practi-
tioners and trained counselors motivates patients toward
change (Miller and Rollnick, 2013). There is also evidence
that MI may be more efficacious relative to other treat-
ments with smokers who are low in motivation to quit
(Hettema and Hendricks, 2010).
Customers seeking help with smoking cessation from
pharmacy personnel are already beyond the "precontempla-
tion" stage of the stage-of-change model. Rather, these
customers are people who have reached the "contemplation"
or "preparation" stage and may be intending to purchase a
smoking cessation aid. For smokers who decide to stop
smoking, pharmacotherapy increases the chances of success
(Fiore etal., 2008).An understanding of the theory and prac-
tice of the stage-of-change model and MI could result in
more effective counseling, by pairing the appropriate cessa-
tion advice to the stage of each customer and helping them
resolve their ambivalences toward change. Well-designed
smoking cessation training for pharmacists is needed. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first study designed to
assess the outcome of training pharmacists in the stage-of-
change model of smoking cessation and MI.
We hypothesized that pharmacists who participated in a
training based on the stage-of-change model and MI would
be more effective than untrained controls to help people
quit smoking and that many of their customers would
achieve long-term abstinence from smoking. Hence, the
main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the
training on smoking cessation outcomes. The training
included specific content and recommendations pertaining
to preparation, action, maintenance, and relapse.
The focus of the training was to help participants develop
an understanding of the key principles of the stage-of-
change model and MI approach. Participants learned a series
of brief questioning to assess the stages of change of their
customers. Strategies to match the stage to the most appro-
priate intervention to promote cessation were emphasized.
Methods
A training based on the stage-of-change model of smoking
cessation (Di Clemente, 2001) and MI (Miller and Rollnick,
2013) was conducted in February 2016, by the Centro per
la Prevenzione e Cura del Tabagismo at the University of
Catania. The training was previously piloted on a cross sec-
tion of pharmacy personnel. Case studies of pharmacy cus-
tomers, communication skills for negotiating change, and
the importance of providing ongoing support, encourage-
ment, and pharmacotherapy for cessation were included
and emphasized in the training.
In September 2015, all 46 community pharmacies regis-
tered at Farmacia OK, a Sicilian Pharmacists'Association,
were invited to participate in the trial. A total of 42 pharma-
cies accepted the invitation and attended a 3-hour confer-
ence focused on the US Public Health Services 2008
Clinical Practice Guidelines for Treating Tobacco Use and
Dependence (Fiore et
al., 2008). These guidelines align
with the principles of MI and the stage-of-change model.
Training for pharmacists in Italy does not include smoking
cessation. Therefore, it was critical to expose participants
to these internationally accepted evidence-based practice
guidelines for tobacco dependence.
Successively, pharmacies were randomly allocated, by
sequential allocation, to the intervention or control group
Caponnetto et al. 3
(Figure 1). The intervention group attended a 6-hour
training by scheduling an initiation workshop. The
6
hours of anti-smoking training teach the most skilled
pharmacists to be more effective in making them able to
help their smoking customers quit.
During the 3-month customer recruitment period, all
smokers who sought advice on smoking cessation or those
who bought an OTC anti-smoking product in preparation
for a new attempt to stop smoking were eligible for inclu-
sion. Pharmacy personnel offered these customers a patient
information sheet specific to their group (intervention or
control) informing them that Farmacia OK pharmacists
were working with researchers studying smoking cessation
at the University of Catania and inviting them to join the
study. Specifically, in the intervention group, smokers were
informed that their pharmacists were trained to specific
anti-smoking counseling based on stage-of-change and MI
theories. In the control group, smokers were informed that
their pharmacists recently attended a conference on
"Clinical Practice Guidelines for Treating Tobacco Use and
Dependence."
Pharmacy staff maintained a confidential client record
which documented their progress in smoking cessation, any
product supplied, points raised by the client, and advice
given. At each of the planned follow-up visits, telephone
call reminders were carried out to improve participation.
However, customers were not made aware of their group
allocation (intervention vs control pharmacy). To monitor
the level of non-recruitment, pharmacies in both groups
maintained a tally record of customers who declined to join
the study and their reasons. Intervention personnel offered
their customers the professional anti-smoking counseling.
The control group asked customers to register and then
continued to provide standard professional support.
The main outcome measures were number of treated
smokers, smoking reduction at week 24, and smoking ces-
sation rates at week 24, in accordance with Russell
Standard (Clinical) (West et
al., 2005). Validation was
covered by measuring exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO).
Participants who self-reported quit smoking with an eCO
concentration of 10ppm at the week 24 follow-up visit
were defined as quitters (21). Those smokers who failed
to meet these criteria (smoking abstinence and eCO
10ppm) were categorized as smoking cessation failures
(i.e. relapsers with eCO 10ppm). Smokers setting a firm
quit date was counted as "lost to follow-up" if, on attempt-
ing to determine and verify his or her quitter status, he or
she could not be contacted. Success rates were measured
as the 24-week (24WQ) success rate (West etal., 2005).
At each follow-up time point, cigarette consumption was

assessed and counseling was offered. Abstinence from
smoking was reviewed objectively throughout the study
by measuring the levels of eCO at each follow-up visit.
The statistical software SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., 2007) for
Windows was used to store and analyze data, to calculate
descriptive statistics, and to demonstrate differences
between the intervention and control groups.
Data analysis
We use descriptive statistics (i.e. frequencies/percentages,
means/standard deviations) to describe the intervention
content (active vs control group). To describe process
results in terms of patterns of quitting, we reported the
smoking cessation rates. To describe process results in
terms of cessation rates, we applied the Fisher test. We used
intention-to-treat analysis in the context of analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) and applied the Wilcoxon/Mann­Whitney
test assuming that all those smokers who were lost to fol-
low-up were classified as failures.
Results
All 46 community pharmacies registered at Farmacia OK, a
Sicilian Pharmacists'Association, were invited to participate
in the trial; a total of 42 community pharmacies registered in
the Farmacia OK database have participated in the trial. In
all, 21 pharmacies were randomly allocated by sequential
allocation to the intervention group and 21 to the control
group; 13 pharmacies of the intervention group completed
the study and 8 pharmacies of the control group completed
the study. Pharmacies that did not complete the study were
contacted by telephone from the principal investigator's
study to know the reasons that prompted them not to com-
plete the project. About 35
percent responded that they had
other priorities to follow at that time, 25percent replied that
they did not have enough staff dedicated to the project,
20percent responded that they did not complete the study for
the fear of losing customers in the event of a smoking cessa-
tion treatment's lack of effectiveness, and 20percent replied
that to help smokers takes time and their pharmacy must
always be quick and fast so they cannot waste time.
A total of 187 smokers were enrolled in the study (124
smokers were enrolled in the intervention group and 63
smokers were enrolled in the control group; Figure 2).
At week 24, we have observed a significant reduction in
the number of daily cigarettes smoked between the inter-
vention and control groups. The intervention group smoked
a mean of 22.4 cigarettes per day at recruitment versus a
mean of 7.5 cigarettes per day at week 24. The control
group smoked a mean of 17.3 cigarettes per day at recruit-
ment and 12.5 cigarettes per day at week 24 (Figure 3).
Assuming that all those individuals who were lost to
follow-up were classified as failures (intention-to-treat anal-
ysis), in the context of ANOVA, we applied the Wilcoxon/
Mann­Whitney test and showed that the difference between
baseline and week 24 between the intervention and control
groups resulted statistically significant. In the control group,
difference between cigarettes in baseline and week 24 was
-0.88 (p=0.001), while in the intervention group, a reduc-
tion in -4.82 (z=-4.028; p=0.000) was observed.
To valuate cessation rates, we applied the Fisher test and
we observed 12.2
percent of smokers quit smoking in the
intervention group at week 24, and 1.6percent of smokers
quit smoking in the control group (F=0.001) (Figure 4).
Finally, at week 24, the possibility to quit smoking in the
intervention group was 1.48 times greater than the control
group (odds ratio=1.252­1.761).
Discussion
When a smoker reaches the contemplation stage of smoking
cessation, he or she can ask for help from the pharmacists.
He or she represents a reference point for his or her ease of
accessibility and a reference point for the pharmacist­patient

relationship. Customers generally interact with pharmacists
often and have great esteem and confidence in pharmacists,
and 86.4percent of pharmacists believe that their profession
should become more active in helping patients to quit smok-
ing (Hudmon etal., 2006). Hence, it is very important to
have the proper training, to give the right advice to these peo-
ple who are often not well assisted. In Scotland, Coggans
et
al. (2000) documented that 66
percent of the surveyed
pharmacy patients agreed that they would be willing to dis-
cuss tobacco cessation with a community pharmacist.
Brewster etal. (2007) surveyed more than 2000 Ontarians,
one-third of whom thought that their pharmacist would be a
good source of tobacco cessation advice. Also, in one of the
two studies conducted in the United States, Hudmon etal.
(2003) interviewed NRT users who had either recently quit
(75% of respondents) or were about to do so. A majority
(63%, n
=
103) believed that assistance or advice from a
pharmacist would increase the chance of success in quitting.
In the other study, of the 73 patients who completed a survey,
those who smoked (n=20) agreed or strongly agreed (85%)
that pharmacies were the most convenient places for tobacco
cessation programs (Hudmon et
al., 2003). Moreover, a
majority of smokers believe that community pharmacies are
a convenient location for receiving cessation services
(Couchenour etal., 2002). Research strongly suggests that
pharmacist-led tobacco cessation interventions in commu-
nity settings are effective. Our study showed higher effec-
tiveness of pharmacists trained in stage-of-change model on
smoking cessation and MI to help smokers quit smoking
compared to control group. Because of its design, there are a
number of limitations that must be considered when inter-
preting the findings of this study (e.g. the small sample size).
Some characteristics of the sample limit generalization of the
findings; all participants were regular smokers with an ele-
vated level of nicotine dependence (10 cigarettes per day),
they were motivated to quit, and all participants were adults
and customers of "Farmacia OK group." Finally, the findings
reported from urban Sicilian residents in this study may not
be valid for other population samples. Nonetheless, our study
indicated that training pharmacists in the stage-of-change
model of smoking cessation and MI in a smoking cessation
program is an inexpensive strategy that can be quite effective
for smokers. This can represent a good starting point for new
studies to improve smoking cessation intervention delivered
by pharmacists.
Conclusion
This study showed the importance to training pharmacists in
the stage-of-change model of smoking cessation and MI. In
fact, trained pharmacists have been more effective than non-
trained pharmacists in helping people to quit smoking. This
can be a good starting point for future studies to build on.
