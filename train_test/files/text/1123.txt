of Exposure to Intimate Partner Violence
Among US Female Adolescents and Young Adults

Objective: To examine whether depressive symptom-
atology is predictive of subsequent intimate partner vio-
lence victimization among a national prospective sample
of female adolescents and young adults.
Design: Home interview data from 2 waves of the school-
based National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
were used to examine whether baseline depressive symp-
tomatology was associated with increased risk of past-
year exposure to physical abuse by a current partner at
5-year follow-up, controlling for age, race/ethnicity, pa-
rental education, retrospective childhood physical and
sexual abuse, and baseline dating violence and forced sex.
Setting: A stratified random sample of 80 US high schools
and 52 middle schools.
Participants: All young women (n=1659) were in a cur-
rent opposite-sex relationship at follow-up.
Main Exposure: Baseline past-week depressive symp-
tomatology, measured as both a dichotomous and con-
tinuous variable.
Main Outcome Measures: Past-year exposure to mild
and moderate to severe physical abuse by a current in-
timate partner.
Results: Inadjustedmodelswithdichotomousdepressive
symptoms, high baseline symptom levels were associated
with 1.86 times the odds of subsequent exposure to mod-
erate to severe partner violence (95% confidence interval,
1.05-3.29).Inadjustedmodelswithcontinuousdepressive
symptoms, an increase of 1 SD in baseline symptom levels
was associated with a 24% increase in odds of exposure to
mildpartnerviolenceanda24%increaseintheoddsofex-
posure to moderate to severe partner violence.
Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that de-
pressive symptomatology among girls during adoles-
cence is associated with increased risk of subsequent ex-
posure to physical partner violence. Prevention,
identification, and treatment of depressive symptomatol-
ogy among adolescent girls may help to reduce the like-
lihood of subsequent victimization.

WHILE DEPRESSION IS
understood to be a
common outcome
of exposure to inti-
mate partner vio-
lence (IPV) among female adolescents and
young adults,1 little research has exam-
ined the reverse relationship--the extent
to which depressive symptomatology in
adolescence may be associated with risk
of exposure to future abuse by an inti-
mate partner, independent of factors such
as prior dating violence or childhood
abuse. Increased understanding of the de-
pression-IPV relationship may contrib-
ute to prevention efforts by helping to iden-
tify girls at risk of future IPV exposure.
Lifetime prevalence of major depres-
sive disorder and minor depression among
girls aged 15 to 24 years have been esti-
mated to be 21% and 10%, respectively.2
The time of transition from adolescence
to adulthood is a time of peak depression
onset.3 At the same time, 8.8% of female
high school students in the national 2003
Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System
survey reported past-year experience of
physical abuse by a dating partner.4 Esti-
mates of dating violence victimization
among girls in smaller studies range from
8% to 57%; studies vary in the period as-
sessed.5 Nationally, 22% of women 18
years and older report experiencing physi-
cal IPV at some point in their lifetime.6

study found that depression at age 18 years was associ-
ated with impaired psychological and social functioning at
age 21 years regardless of depression status at age 21 years,
suggesting that depression during the time of transition to
adulthood is associated with continued psychosocial vul-
nerability and poorer functioning in young adulthood re-
gardless of depression status in young adulthood19; other
studies support the finding of vulnerability beyond the du-
ration of the depressive episode.14
Few prospective studies have examined IPV expo-
sure as a potential outcome related to adolescent depres-
sive symptomatology, and findings among these studies
have been mixed. A 3-year study of a high-risk sample
found that women's baseline depressive symptomatol-
ogy was predictive of their male partners' subsequent per-
petration of psychological but not physical abuse.20 A
6-year study of male and female high school students
found that depressive symptomatology in adolescence was
not associated with subsequent physical aggression in dat-
ing relationships or marriage (perpetration and victim-
ization were not distinguished).21 A retrospective na-
tional study of married or cohabiting adults found that
premarital depression was not associated with subse-
quent IPV victimization among women.22 A 5-year study
of female high school students found that the propor-
tion of days spent in depressive episodes was positively
associated with psychological and physical abuse by boy-
friends over the follow-up period; temporal order of de-
pressive episodes and abuse could not be ascertained.16

Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health).23
METHODS
DESIGN
The Add Health study is a longitudinal study of the determi-
nants and contexts of youth health and risk behaviors. In sum-
mary, a stratified random sample of 80 US high schools and 52
middle schools was selected with probability of selection pro-
portional to school size. Stratification was with respect to re-
gion of country, urbanicity, school size, school type, and race/
ethnic composition. Wave 1 structured, closed-ended home
interviews were conducted with youth in grades 7 through 12
in 1995; 82% of wave 1 home interview subjects with sam-
pling weights had a parental figure who participated in a wave
1 parent interview. Wave 2 home interview data were col-
lected in 1996 (n with sampling weights=13 570) and wave 3
data were collected in 2001 and 2002 (n with sampling
weights=10 828). Written informed consent was provided by
youth participants as well as a parental figure at waves 1 and 2
and by youth participants at wave 3. Approval for the full Add
Health study was granted by the institutional review board of
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Pub-
lic Health; approval for the present data analysis was granted
by the Human Subjects Committee of the Harvard School of
Public Health (Boston, Mass).
SAMPLE
The study sample was restricted to the 1659 girls in the contrac-
tual use data set24 who participated in home interviews at waves
1, 2, and 3; had sample weights; and were selected for the couples
sample of the Add Health study. One half of all wave 3­eligible
subjects were randomly selected to be considered for the wave
3 couples sample. By design, the couples sample includes one-
third dating couples, one-third cohabiting couples, and one-
thirdmarriedcouples.Criteriaforinclusioninthecouplessample
were (1) involvement in a current relationship; (2) relationship
duration of 3 months or more; (3) opposite-sex relationship; and
(4) partner 18 years or older. The sample for the present study
was also restricted to subjects who had nonmissing data regard-
ing IPV outcomes and who had 3 or fewer missing items on the
wave 2 depressive symptoms scale. Three subjects who re-
ported that their partner had physically abused them more than
1 year prior to the wave 3 interview, but not within the past year,
were also excluded so as to maintain temporal clarity between
wave 2 depressive symptoms and IPV exposure (Figure).
MEASURES
Baseline Depressive Symptomatology
Self-reported past-week depressive symptomatology was as-
sessed both as a dichotomous and continuous variable at wave
2, with a 19-item, modified Center for Epidemiologic Studies
Scale (CES-D) used in the Add Health survey.25 The original
20-item scale has been widely used as a measure of depressive

symptomatology in epidemiologic research and as an initial
screening tool for clinical depression in community-based
samples. In the modified Add Health scale, 2 original CES-D
items were removed ("I had crying spells" and "My sleep was
restless") and 1 item was added ("I felt that life was not worth
living"). Two additional items were rephrased. Item scores in
the modified scale correspond to symptom frequency and range
from 0 ("never or rarely") to 3 ("most or all of the time"); scale
scores range from 0 to 56. Internal consistency reliability in the
present sample was 0.89, similar to that found for the CES-D
in other adolescent samples.26-28
A CES-D cutoff score of 24 has been found to maximize sen-
sitivity (0.84) and specificity (0.75) for Diagnostic and Statis-
tical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition29 major
depressive disorder or dysthymia for adolescent girls.27 Pro-
portionally adapted to the 19-item scale, the cutoff score used
in this study for above-threshold or "high" depressive symp-
tomatology was 23.30,31 Secondary analyses were also per-
formed with the continuous scale for greater statistical power.
Control Variables
Age. This was a continuous variable for age at wave 2.
Race/Ethnicity. Four categories were used: non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and other. Youth reporting more
than 1 race/ethnicity were assigned to the category with which
they indicated they most identify.
Wave 1 Parental Education. This was a dichotomous variable
indicating whether the highest educational attainment among
resident parental figures at wave 1 was less than high school.
Data were obtained from the parent interview.
Covariates
Childhood Experience of Physical and/or Sexual Abuse. At
wave 3, subjects were asked 2 self-administered questions re-
garding the time before they entered the sixth grade: (1) "How
often had your parents or other adult caregivers slapped, hit,
or kicked you?" and (2) "How often had one of your parents
or other adult caregivers touched you in a sexual way, forced
you to touch him or her in a sexual way, or forced you to have
sexual relations?" A dichotomous variable was created reflect-
ing subject report of being slapped, hit, or kicked more than 5
times and/or report of any occurrence of sexual abuse.
Dating Violence and/or Forced Sex Between Waves 1 and 2.
At wave 2, subjects were asked whether any partner they had
had since wave 1 ever threatened them with violence, pushed
or shoved them, or thrown something at them that could hurt.
Subjects who indicated at wave 2 that they had ever had
sexual intercourse were also asked whether they were ever
physically forced to have sexual intercourse against their will
since the wave 1 interview. These data were collected with au-
dio computer-assisted self-interview. 32,33 A dichotomous vari-
able was created reflecting 1 or more affirmative responses to
these items.
Outcome Variables
Mild Violence. At wave 3, subjects were asked 1 self-
administered question regarding how often in the past year their
current partner had threatened them with violence, pushed or
shoved them, or thrown something at them that could hurt. A
dichotomous variable was created reflecting any past-year ex-
perience of this outcome.
Moderate to Severe Physical Violence. At wave 3, subjects were
asked 1 self-administered question regarding how often in the
past year their current partner had slapped, hit, or kicked them
and another question regarding how often in the past year they
had had an "injury, such as a sprain, bruise, or cut" because of a
fight with their current partner. A dichotomous variable was cre-
ated reflecting experience of either or both of these outcomes.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All analyses were conducted with SAS version 8 (SAS Institute
Inc, Cary, NC). Logistic regression models were estimated us-
ing the 2 dichotomous violence variables as dependent vari-
ables. The SAS proc GENMOD function (generalized estimat-
ing equations) was used for all regressions, with specification
of an independent working correlation structure. The use of
generalized estimating equations accounts for data clustering
to provide robust standard error estimation.
Multivariate models first adjusted for control variables of age,
race/ethnicity, and parental education (model 1) and then ad-
ditionally adjusted for covariates of childhood physical/sexual
abuse and dating violence/forced sex (model 2). All baseline data
for these analyses were collected at wave 2, except for wave 1
parental education and wave 3 retrospective childhood abuse.
Potential interactions between depressive symptomatol-
ogy and each of the 2 prior abuse covariates were examined
separately in unadjusted and adjusted models predicting mild
and moderate to severe abuse outcomes, with both the dichoto-
mous and continuous depressive symptoms variables. These
interaction terms were insignificant in all model specifica-
tions and were not included in final models.
In addition, 2 variables reflecting wave 2 alcohol abuse co-
morbidity (frequent drinking and heavy drinking) were con-
sidered for inclusion as covariates; neither variable was in-
cluded in final models because they were not associated in
bivariate or multivariate models with either IPV outcome, and
their addition to the adjusted models did not alter the effect
size or significance of depressive symptoms. This may have been
owing to insufficient statistical power.
Variables reflecting subjects' relationship status were also
not included in final models because relationship status was
viewed as a potential mediator between depressive symptoms
and IPV exposure. Inclusion of relationship status variables in
preliminary analyses, however, produced no difference in the
effect size or significance level of depressive symptomatology
with regard to either IPV outcome.
All analyses used adjusted grand sample weights to ac-
count for wave 3 nonresponse and subgroup oversampling. For
analyses examining the outcome of mild IPV, a subsample of
1632 subjects was used; 27 subjects who reported exposure to
moderate to severe but not mild violence at wave 3 were ex-
cluded. For analyses examining moderate to severe IPV, a sub-
sample of 1525 subjects was used; 134 subjects who experi-
enced mild but not moderate to severe violence were excluded.
For the 15 subjects who were missing 3 or fewer items on the
wave 2 depressive symptoms scale, the mean of the remaining
items was imputed for each missing item.
RESULTS
SAMPLE CHARACTERISTICS
The sample of girls was 68.5% non-Hispanic white, 15.6%
non-Hispanic black, 10.6% Hispanic, and 5.3% other race/
ethnicities (Table 1). The mean ages at baseline and fol-
low-up were 15.9 years and 21.3 years, respectively; the
wave 3 age range was 18 to 27 years. Ten percent of sub-

jects came from homes where the highest parental edu-
cation level was less than 12th grade. The mean baseline
depressive symptoms scale score was 11.4, and 10.2% of
subjects had above-threshold symptom scores. At wave 3,
25.7% of subjects were married, 24.9% were cohabiting,
and 49.4% were considered to be dating. The mean num-
ber of years between wave 2 and 3 interviews was 5.4. One
percent of subjects were married at both waves 2 and 3.
DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMATOLOGY
AND SUBSEQUENT IPV EXPOSURE
Twenty-eight percent of subjects with high depressive
symptom levels at baseline reported any IPV or injury at
follow-up as compared with 17.5% of subjects with lower
symptom levels (odds ratio [OR], 1.84 [95% confidence
interval (CI), 1.20-2.84]) (Table 2).
In bivariate analyses with the dichotomous depres-
sive symptoms variable, girls with high baseline symp-
tom levels had 1.66 times the odds of subsequent expo-
sure to mild IPV and 2.46 times the odds of exposure to
moderate to severe IPV as compared with girls with lower
baseline symptom levels (results not shown). In fully ad-
justed analyses, high depressive symptomatology was not
significantly associated with likelihood of exposure to mild
IPV (P=.11) (Table 3); girls with high depressive symp-
toms had 1.86 times the odds of subsequent exposure to
moderate to severe IPV (95% CI, 1.05-3.29) (Table 4).
In bivariate analyses with continuous depressive symp-
tomatology, a 1-point increase in baseline symptoms was
associated with a 3% increase in the odds of subsequent
exposure to mild IPV (95% CI, 1.01-1.05) and a 4% in-
crease in the odds of exposure to moderate to severe IPV
(95% CI, 1.02-1.06). In fully adjusted analyses, each
1-point increase in depressive symptomatology was as-
sociated with a 3% increase in the odds of exposure to
mild IPV (95% CI, 1.01-1.05) and a 3% increase in the
odds of exposure to moderate to severe IPV (95% CI, 1.01-
1.05) (tables available on request).
Regarding covariates and controls, adjusted analyses
demonstrated that childhood physical/sexual abuse and
baseline dating violence/forced sex were each associ-
ated with approximately 2 times the odds of exposure
to moderate to severe IPV (Table 4). Additional analy-
ses found that the lack of association observed between
the abuse covariates and mild IPV in the fully adjusted
model did not seem to be due to a mediating effect of de-
pressive symptomatology.34
COMMENT
Findings from this prospective study suggest that de-
pressive symptomatology among adolescent girls is as-

sociated with increased risk of subsequent physical abuse
by an intimate partner in late adolescence and young
adulthood, independent of childhood physical or sexual
abuse as well as prior experience of dating violence or
forced sex. Twenty-eight percent of girls with high lev-
els of baseline depressive symptomatology, correspond-
ing to an elevated likelihood of mood disorder, reported
some form of past-year physical IPV victimization 5 years
later. Girls with high baseline depressive symptoms had
1.86 times the odds of girls with lower symptom levels
of subsequent exposure to moderate to severe IPV, and
victimization risk was also found to increase with in-
creasing levels of continuous depressive symptomatol-
ogy. The finding that childhood abuse and dating violence/
forced sex were associated with subsequent IPV risk also
provides prospective evidence that prior abuse is predic-
tive of revictimization among young women.
The time of transition from adolescence to adult-
hood is one of increasing independence from parents,
strengthening self-concept, and critical decision mak-
ing regarding education, occupation, and intimate rela-
tionships, all of which have a salient impact on the long-
term social trajectory of the individual.16,19 Depression
that occurs during this time of transition may have a par-
ticularly significant impact on maturational processes and
choices made, generating a trajectory of risk for contin-
ued psychosocial impairment and psychopathol-
ogy.11,15,16,35,36
Regarding social pathways that may be affected by de-
pression in adolescence, studies of peer group homoph-
ily and assortative mating have found that adolescents
and adults with depressive symptoms or disorders often
associate, in friendship,37,38 dating,20 and marriage,39 with
others who have similar levels of symptomatology. In turn,
depressive symptoms and disorders among men have been
found to be positively associated with subsequent psy-
chological20 and/or physical22 aggression toward an in-
timate partner.
Depressive symptomatology is also associated with a
range of adolescent risk behaviors including substance
use and abuse,40-42 and depressed youth are more likely
to associate with deviant or risky peer groups18 from which
partner selection is likely to occur. Alcohol and drug use,
in turn, have been associated in some studies with males'
physical abuse perpetration toward their dating part-
ners,43 cohabiting partners, and wives.44 Depressive symp-
tomatology has also been associated with antisocial be-
havior among young men20,45; delinquency46 and antisocial
behavior20,21 among male adolescents are associated with
increased likelihood of physical IPV perpetration. In sum,
depressive symptomatology may elevate girls' risk of fu-
ture IPV exposure by way of its contribution to risky peer
group affiliations and assortative partnering with high-
risk mates.
In addition to differential selection into abusive rela-
tionships, young women with a history of depressive
symptomatology may be less likely to leave abusive re-
lationships (or take a longer time to leave) for various
reasons. First, insofar as depression in adolescence is pre-
dictive of outcomes such as teenage childbearing, dimin-
ished educational attainment, and unemployment, it may
be associated with increased economic dependency on
future partners and thus decreased likelihood of rela-
tionship exit.47,48 Second, increasing social isolation of the
woman from family and friends is a common feature of
abusive relationships, and diminished social support is
another obstacle to relationship exit.49,50 Depressed youth
often have impaired social relationships and dimin-
ished support from family members and peers,11,35,51 such
that young women with former or current depression may
enter intimate relationships from a starting point of greater
isolation than those with no former or current depres-
sion. This diminished potential pool of external sup-
port may contribute to an increased likelihood of not leav-
ing, or returning to, an abusive partner. Girls with a history
of depression and diminished social support may also
place an elevated premium on intimacy and mainte-
nance of a relationship with a romantic partner and be
more willing to tolerate acts of violence from an other-
wise seemingly secure partner.48
Third, depression is a primary psychological re-
sponse to abuse, and Barnett48 notes that depression or
other mental health difficulties due to IPV may impair
women's ability to mobilize to exit their relationships.
Women who have a history of vulnerability to depres-
sion may have an increased likelihood of responding to
the stressor of IPV with depression or other debilita-
tion, contributing to a decreased likelihood of relation-
ship exit. Further research should examine these and other
potential mechanisms.
This study has several limitations. First, the adapted
CES-D scale is not a diagnostic instrument. The wave 2
measurement of past-week depressive symptomatology
may also not fully reflect the severity, chronicity, or re-
currence of symptomatology over the period between
waves 2 and 3, which may be relevant to likelihood of
future IPV exposure. However, depressive symptoms and

disorders in adolescence are predictive of subsequent dis-
order in young adulthood, and a number of studies have
noted the stability of depressed mood among adoles-
cents, although a consistent pattern of findings has not
yet emerged for girls.11,52-54 Second, incomplete measure-
ment of confounding factors may have contributed to the
observation of an association between depressive symp-
tomatology and IPV exposure. The childhood abuse, dat-
ing violence, and sexual coercion covariates do not ac-
count for all relevant time in respondents' lives, and the
wave 2 sexual coercion item focuses only on forced in-
tercourse. The Add Health study also does not include a
measure of exposure to interparental violence, which has
been found to be predictive of women's subsequent de-
pressive symptomatology55 and abuse by an intimate part-
ner.56 Third, IPV is frequently underreported by survi-
vors,57,58 which may have led to bias in results. Fourth,
this study did not address perpetration; this relation-
ship should be examined with surveys that distinguish
between violence committed in self-defense or retalia-
tion and self-initiated acts.59 Finally, the generalizabil-
ity of the study findings is limited, given the specific na-
ture of the sample.
Overall, this study provides evidence that elevated lev-
els of depressive symptomatology among adolescent girls
are associated with an increased vulnerability to subse-
quent IPV exposure in late adolescence and young adult-
hood. However, the question of whether depressive symp-
tomatology plays an independent role in shaping the
trajectory toward future IPV exposure among young
women, or whether it is simply a marker for IPV risk, is
not fully resolved with the present study and warrants
furtherinvestigation.Ifdepressivesymptomatologyamong
adolescent girls becomes recognized as an independent
predictor of subsequent IPV exposure, this will be one
more reason to increase efforts in the prevention, iden-
tification, and treatment of depressive symptomatology
among adolescent girls. If depressive symptomatology
comes to be understood as a marker for risk of IPV ex-
posure, it may be helpful in identifying high-risk girls
for targeted intervention efforts.

"Look there,
look in the eyes,
and look in the hearts,
of those who watch while a baby sleeps,
who will come at a call if he wakes and weeps,
who forget the diapers and broken toys,
who remember the tears and fears and joys,
and the catch in the throat, and the heart's
clutch,
when small hands fumble, and reach, and
touch--
Yes, look in their hearts, and the signs are
clear . . .
A baby lives here."
