Objective: To evaluate the association between vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency with diabetic ne-
phropathy across racial/ethnic groups.
Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of the 2001 to 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey. A nationally representative sample of 1216 adults (>20 years old) with diagnosed diabetes pro-
vides population estimates for >12.6 million individuals. Nephropathy was defined as urinary albumin-
to-creatinine ratio >30 mg/g in a random spot urine sample. Serum 25-hydroxycalciferol vitamin D
levels were characterized as <20 ng/mL vitamin D deficiency, 20 to 29 ng/mL vitamin D insufficiency,
and >30 ng/mL normal vitamin D.
Results: Overall, 30.7% of adults with diabetes have nephropathy, 48.9% have vitamin D deficiency
and 36.6% have vitamin D insufficiency. Minorities are more likely to have nephropathy (non-Hispanic
whites, 27.8%; non-Hispanic blacks, 36.2%; Hispanics 38.5%; P  .02) and vitamin D deficiency (non-
Hispanic whites, 39.5%; non-Hispanic blacks, 80.4%; Hispanic, 59.0%; P < .01). Higher proportions of
individuals with nephropathy have vitamin D deficiency than individuals without nephropathy (53.2% vs
47.0%; P  .03). Logistic regressions demonstrate vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are associated
with the presence of nephropathy after adjustment for race/ethnicity, age, sex, hypertension, high cho-
lesterol, smoking status, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor
blockers (odds ratio, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.06­3.23 for vitamin D deficiency; and odds ratio, 1.79; 95% CI,
1.12­2.85 for vitamin D insufficiency).
Conclusions: There is a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in individuals with
diabetes; minorities have the highest prevalences. Thus, evaluating vitamin D levels in people with dia-
betes may be warranted. There is an independent association between vitamin D deficiency and vitamin
D insufficiency with the presence of nephropathy, even after adjustment for race/ethnicity and other
variables. Further studies of this relationship may lead to new interventions that decrease health dis-
parities in the progression of diabetic nephropathy. (J Am Board Fam Med 2009;22:521­527.)
Background
Diabetic nephropathy is a risk factor for cardiovas-
cular disease and the leading cause of chronic kid-
ney disease in patients starting renal replacement
therapy.1 Racial and ethnic differences exist in the
prevalence of diabetic nephropathy. A study evalu-
ating people with diabetes in the United States
shows that non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics are
less likely to have normal renal function than non-
Hispanic whites.2 Similarly, the incidence of re-
ported end-stage renal disease in people with dia-
betes is more than 4 times as high in African
Americans and 4 to 6 times as high in Mexican
Americans than in the general population of diabe-
tes patients.3 These disparities exist despite similar
proportions of blacks, whites, and Hispanics meet-
ing recommendations for glycolated hemoglobin
and blood pressure control and similar proportions
with rennin-angiotensin system blockade via use of
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs).2
Thus, reasons for the racial/ethnic disparities seen
in diabetic nephropathy are unclear.
A factor that may impact the differential devel-
opment of diabetic nephropathy is vitamin D. The

role of the kidney in the hydroxylation of the vita-
min D metabolite 25-hydroxycalciferol (25-OH-D)
from the liver to the biologically active form of
1,25(OH)2D3 is well established.4,5 Animal studies
suggest that, in addition to the impact that chronic
renal failure has on increasing the likelihood of
1,25(OH)2D3 deficiency and insufficiency caused
by the kidney's role in vitamin D metabolism, vi-
tamin D deficiency and insufficiency also have an
active role in the progression of kidney disease.6­9
Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by the
vitamin D metabolite has been demonstrated in
vitro; animal studies suggest that receptor-medi-
ated vitamin D actions have a renoprotective role in
diabetic nephropathy.6,7 These findings are sup-
ported by rat studies that show 1,25(OH)2D3 ad-
ministration attenuates the development of glo-
merulosclerosis and the progression of proteinuria
through parathyroid hormone-independent anti-
proliferative actions and decreases in podocyte loss
and podocyte hypertrophy.8,9 These findings may
be especially pertinent in individuals with diabetic
nephropathy because, in addition to the direct im-
pact on renal function, adequate levels of vitamin D
are also associated with decreased insulin resistance
and reduced blood pressure, the 2 main, potentially
modifiable risk factors for diabetic nephropathy
initiation and progression.1,10 However, little in-
formation is available about the association be-
tween diabetic nephropathy and vitamin D levels in
humans.
It has been estimated that 1 billion people
worldwide have vitamin D deficiency or insuffi-
ciency.10 Minorities are more likely to be deficient
in vitamin D because of low dietary intake as well as
the role of solar ultraviolet B radiation in vitamin D
metabolism, causing the increased pigmentation in
groups with darker skin to reduce vitamin D pro-
duction in the skin.11,12 Thus, the health disparities
currently seen in diabetic nephropathy may be par-
tially explained by differences in vitamin D levels
by race/ethnicity. Therefore, this study will evalu-
ate the association between Vitamin D and diabetic
nephropathy in a nationally representative sample
of people with diabetes.
Methods
Survey Description
Data from the 2001 to 2006 National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) was an-
alyzed. The NHANES is a product of the National
Center for Health Statistics. It is a continuous,
annual survey involving participants from a nation-
ally representative sample of noninstitutional-
ized residents of the United States. Samples are
weighted so they are representative of the US pop-
ulation. Sampling weights are calculated by taking
into account unequal probabilities of selection
caused by sample design, nonresponse and planned
over-sampling of minorities, and then matched to
population control totals known to be representa-
tive of the US population. This allows for the
calculation of population estimates for the United
States.13 The NHANES includes a detailed house-
hold interview and physical examination plus labo-
ratory information obtained through mobile exam-
ination centers. Data are collected throughout the
year across designated data collection communities
in the United States. To protect the anonymity of
the respondents, the month of data collection and
the specific community of origin of the respondent
is not released to the public. The reported investi-
gations have been conducted in accordance with
the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki as
revised in 2000.
Sample
Adults (20 years of age) who reported a diagnosis
of diabetes by answering yes to the question,
"Other than during pregnancy, have you ever been
told by a doctor or health professional that you
have diabetes or sugar diabetes?" were included in
this sample. Participants self-identified as non-His-
panic white, non-Hispanic black, or Hispanic. Be-
cause of the small size and heterogeneity of the
"Other" racial category, this group was not ana-
lyzed.
Definition of Diabetic Nephropathy
Consistent with American Diabetes Association
guidelines, albumin and creatinine were measured
in a random spot urine sample.14 These measure-
ments were used to calculate the urinary albumin-
to-creatinine ratio. Values of 30 mg/g were char-
acterized as being normal, whereas values 30
mg/g describe either microalbuminuria or mac-
roalbuminuria.14 Thus, in this study, nephropathy
was defined as a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio
30 mg/g.

Definition of Vitamin D Deficiency and Vitamin D
Insufficiency
Vitamin D status in the serum is evaluated based on
the Diasorin 25-OH-D assay, which measures 25-
OH-D. This is the predominant circulating form of
vitamin D in the normal population and is the most
commonly used to determine vitamin D status.4,5
Although there is no consensus on optimal levels of
25-OH-D, data suggests that levels 30 ng/mL
can be considered an indication of sufficient vita-
min D.4 Thus, individuals with 25-OH-D levels
20 ng/mL and 20 to 29 ng/mL were character-
ized having vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D
insufficiency, respectively. This is consistent with
recommendations from the National Kidney Foun-
dation.5
Medication Use
Participants were asked to present the containers
for all the prescription medications taken during
the past month and to report any medications taken
for which the container was not available. These
medications were then matched by trained survey
interviewers to an annually updated comprehensive
database of all prescription drugs in the US market.
Products not matched to the drug database were
edited after data collection at the National Center
for Health Statistics, where quality control activi-
ties resulted in 1% of medications being listed as
unknown. All reported medication names were
converted to their standard generic ingredient
name for data release.15,16 These generic names
were used to identify medications as ACE inhibi-
tors or ARBs. Use of these medications was in-
cluded in addition to the diagnosis of hypertension
because data suggests that they provide benefits
beyond their effect on blood pressure in the pre-
vention and delay of diabetic kidney disease.17,18
Definitions of Disease
Hypertension was assessed by self-report. Individ-
uals who reported ever being told they had hyper-
tension or high blood pressure were classified as
having hypertension. Having diagnosed high cho-
lesterol was defined based on the question, "Have
you ever been told by a doctor or other health
professional that your blood cholesterol level was
high?" Individuals answering "No" or "I don't
know" or who stated they had not had their cho-
lesterol checked were characterized as not having a
diagnosis of high cholesterol. Hypertension and
high cholesterol were assessed as possible con-
founding variables because dyslipidemia and hyper-
tension are established risk factors for diabetic ne-
phropathy.1 Obesity was based on body mass index
(BMI), calculated using measured weight and
height (kg/m2). BMI categories were consistent
with 1998 National Heart, Lung and Blood Insti-
tute guidelines, which classify obesity as a BMI of
30.0.
Smoking Status
Smoking has been demonstrated to be a putative
risk factor for diabetic nephropathy.19,20 Smoking
status was assessed using 2 questions to characterize
individuals as never, former, or current smokers.
Current cigarette smoking was defined as answer-
ing "Yes" to the question, "Have you smoked at
least 100 cigarettes in your entire life?" and answer-
ing "Everday" or "Some days" to the question, "Do
you now smoke cigarettes?" Individuals who an-
swered "Yes"' to the first question and answered
"Not at all" to the second question were defined as
being a former smoker. Those answering "No" to
both questions were defined as never smoking.
Analysis
Because the NHANES 2001 to 2006 is a complex,
stratified cluster sample, standard statistical tech-
niques could not be used. Therefore, we used
SUDAAN (Research Triangle Institute, Research
Triangle, NC), a specialized statistical program
that accounts for the complex weighting of the
NHANES sample. Using SUDAAN allowed us to
correct for unequal probabilities of selection and
different response rates, ensuring that the results
could be generalized to the noninstitutionalized
civilian population of the United States. Thus the
percentages and odds ratios in this study repre-
sented weighted values. SUDAAN also adjusts the
standard errors to account for the weighting, strat-
ification, and clustering of the complex sampling
design to ensure that expressed P is valid. The
prevalences of demographic and disease character-
istics were assessed within the overall population
and also by race/ethnicity, where they were com-
pared using 2 tests. Similarly, the prevalences of
these characteristics were also assessed and com-
pared in those with and without nephropathy. Lo-
gistic regressions were used to determine the inde-
pendent relationship between vitamin D status and

diabetic nephropathy. An unadjusted regression
was computed initially. Regressions adjusting for
race/ethnicity, age, sex, and for these demographic
variables in addition to other predictor variables
were also computed. The other predictor variables
evaluated were hypertension, high cholesterol,
smoking status, obesity, and use of an ACE inhib-
itor or ARB. P  .05 was determined to be signif-
icant.
Results
The inclusion criteria for this study provided an
unweighted sample size of 1216, which could be
used to provide population estimates for more than
12.6 million individuals. Overall, 48.9% of the par-
ticipants had vitamin D deficiency (20 ng/mL)
and 36.6% of the participants had vitamin D insuf-
ficiency. The mean vitamin D concentration in our
sample was 20.6 ng/mL (95% CI, 19.6­21.6). De-
mographic and disease characteristics for adults
with diabetes by race/ethnicity are presented in
Table 1. Differences in age and sex exist by race/
ethnicity, with non-Hispanic whites being older
and a higher proportion of non-Hispanic blacks
being women. Minorities had a higher proportion
of individuals with nephropathy and were more
likely to have vitamin D deficiency. In fact, 80% of
non-Hispanic blacks and 59% of Hispanics with
diabetes exhibited vitamin D deficiency.
As seen in Table 2, higher proportions of indi-
viduals with nephropathy had vitamin D deficiency
versus individuals without nephropathy. Table 3
presents results from logistic regressions, which
demonstrate that this relationship remains even af-
ter controlling for demographic variables such as
race/ethnicity, age, and sex as well as other vari-
ables. The odds ratios for the unadjusted and ad-
justed relationships remained similar, demonstrat-
ing the independent nature of the relationship
between low levels of serum vitamin D and the
presence of nephropathy. We also tested the rela-
tionship between urinary albumin-to-creatinine ra-
tio and vitamin D (both continuous) in linear re-
gressions. The unadjusted  for vitamin D was
9.49 (95% CI, 15.09 to 3.88) and was signif-
icant at P  .01. Adjusting for demographic vari-

13.93 to 3.61), which was significant at P  .01.
In the fully adjusted regression, vitamin D had a 
of 8.94 (95% CI, 14.29 to 3.60), significant at
P  .01. In a subanalysis excluding persons with
macroalbuminuria, vitamin D 30 ng/mL had an
odds ratio of 1.78 (95% CI, 1.02­3.08) for ne-

persons with less significant disease.
Discussion
Findings from this study show an association be-
tween vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D insuffi-
ciency with nephropathy in a sample of US adults
with diabetes. Furthermore, this association re-
mains despite adjusting for race/ethnicity, the pres-
ence of hypertension, and medication use as well as
other factors, demonstrating a robust relationship.
This is one of the first studies in humans showing
this association. Because of the cross-sectional na-

ture of this study, we were unable to determine
whether this association is present because vitamin
D deficiency increases the risk of nephropathy or
because nephropathy increases the risk of vitamin
D deficiency. Previous studies suggest that the re-
lationship between these 2 variables is such that
both of these interactions may be occurring simul-
taneously. This study evaluates 25-OH-D, the cir-
culating metabolite produced in the liver that is
later metabolized in the kidneys to 1,25(OH)2D3.
Based on this well-established pathway, renal insuf-
ficiency could not be the reason for the low levels of
25-OH-D seen in study. This suggests that studies
to further describe the role of vitamin D as a pos-
sible risk marker or risk factor in diabetic nephrop-
athy are needed to evaluate the impact of maintain-
ing an adequate level of vitamin D on the
progression of diabetic nephropathy. Studies dem-
onstrating a benefit to vitamin D supplementation
for total mortality suggest that this may be a strat-
egy to consider in future studies.21 Further studies
should also evaluate the value of vitamin D as an
independent predictor of the progression of ne-
phropathy as compared with other possible predic-
tors.
This study also described the high prevalence of
vitamin D deficiency in patients with diabetes, re-
gardless of their kidney function. This finding
highlights the need to improve screening for vita-
min D deficiency in patients with diabetes, espe-
cially minority populations, because vitamin D is
known to have a role in decreasing the risk of many
chronic illnesses, including cancer, cardiovascular
disease, and infectious diseases.10 This is especially
pertinent for individuals with diabetes, who are at a
higher risk of developing these conditions than the
general population and thus may receive a greater
benefit from having higher vitamin D levels.22­24
There are limitations to this study that should be
considered. As previously mentioned, the cross-
sectional nature of the data limited inference and
only allowed for the identification of associations.
We were only able to measure 25-OH-D in this
study, which did not allow us to evaluate the role of
the kidney in metabolizing this form of vitamin D
to the biologically active metabolite 1,25(OH)2D3.
This is an accepted approach to the evaluation of
vitamin D status because only a small amount of
25-OH-D is metabolized in the kidney.4,5 We were
unable to identify the month of the year in which
respondents participated in the examination be-
cause of confidentiality issues in the NHANES.
However, NHANES data are collected throughout
the year and across the country so we would not
expect a bias in racial data collection during specific
seasons of the year. Finally, there was no consensus
on the level of 25-OH-D that denotes insuffi-
ciency. Thus, analyses were also performed evalu-
ating another commonly used threshold (32 ng/
ml), and these yielded similar results.25
Conclusion
This study demonstrated an association between
vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D insufficiency
with nephropathy in individuals with diabetes even
after controlling for factors such as race/ethnicity
and the presence of hypertension and use of ACE
inhibitors or ARBs. The high prevalence of vitamin
D deficiency and vitamin D insufficiency in indi-
viduals with diabetes, especially in minorities, sug-
gest that further study of this relationship may lead
to new interventions to delay the progression of
diabetic nephropathy.
