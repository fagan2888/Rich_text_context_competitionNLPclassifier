Introduction
Domestic cats (Felis catus) have established themselves
as a worldwide presence owing to their excellent preda-
tory skills, and continue to expand their international
popularity.1­5 Humans and domestic cats bond quite
well and it is not uncommon for cat owners to open their
homes to more than one cat. The domestic cat is cur-
rently the most common pet in many countries around
the world. The total cat population in the USA is esti-
mated to be 94.2 million (2017); in Europe it is 102.7

Abstract
Objectives Aggression and social tension among housemate cats is common and puts cats at risk of injury or
relinquishment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a new pheromone product in reducing
aggression between housemate cats.
Methods A new pheromone product (Feliway Friends) containing a proprietary cat-appeasing pheromone was
evaluated for efficacy in reducing aggression between housemate cats via a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled pilot trial of 45 multi-cat households (pheromone [n = 20], placebo [n = 25]) reporting aggression for at
least 2 weeks. Each household had 2­5 cats. Participants attended an educational training meeting on day (D) ­7
and the veterinary behaviorist described behaviors to be monitored for 7 weeks using the Oakland Feline Social
Interaction Scale (OFSIS), which assessed the frequency and intensity of 12 representative aggressive interactions.
Participants were also provided with instructions for handling aggressive events, including classical conditioning,
redirection by positive reinforcement and not punishing or startling the cat for aggressive displays. Punishment
techniques were strongly discouraged. Plug-in diffusers with the pheromone product or placebo were utilized from
D0­D28. Participants completed a daily diary of aggressive events and weekly OFSIS assessments through to D42.
Results Evolution of the OFSIS­Aggression score according to treatment group in the full analysis set population
revealed a significant effect on time and treatment group. The OFSIS­Aggression score decreased over time from
D0­D28 in both groups (time factor P = 0.0001) with a significant difference in favor of the verum P = 0.06); similar
results were found considering the D0­D42 period (time factor P = 0.0001 [D0] and P = 0.04 [D42]).
Conclusions and relevance The OFSIS provided a quantifiable measure of the frequency and intensity of 12 inter-
cat interactions reflecting conflict between cats. The cat-appeasing pheromone is a promising treatment for the
management of aggression between housemate cats in multi-cat households.

million cats (2016).1,4 Thirty percent of US households
own at least one cat, with an average of 2.1 cats per cat-
owning household (2012).1 More people own dogs than
cats, but the number of cats is higher because cat owners
tend to have two or more cats sharing their home.1
Domestic cats, like most other felids, are nocturnal,
secretive, solitary survivors and skilled hunters. Cats are
socially flexible and may be quite independent or live in
close contact. Feline social interactions are influenced by
many factors such as their early social experiences and
the availability of resources. They are committed carni-
vores and driven by independent urges to stalk, catch or
kill their prey. Such characteristics mean the domestic cat
does not require coordinated hunting with other
felids.2,5,6 While cats are capable of complex social behav-
iors and do form strong social bonds with familiar or
related cats, they often do not eagerly accept an unfamil-
iar cat. Close affiliative socially bonded feline friend-
ships are characterized by co-sleeping, nose touching
and allogrooming ­ behaviors most often expressed by
cats that have known each other since kittenhood.2,5,6
However, some cats are forced to live together with-
out the ability to leave a social group created by their
owners that is not to their liking. Aggression and social
tension among housemate cats is common and puts cats
at risk of injury or relinquishment.7 In such cases, they
may display a wide range of overt or passive aggressive
distance-increasing behaviors. Overt displays of aggres-
sion include growling, hissing, screaming, spitting,
attacking, chasing and biting.8 Passive displays include
staring, blocking and hiding. In order to avoid conflict
some cats choose to run away, hide or spend more time
avoiding direct interactions. Cats that live indoors may
distribute themselves within the home or may even
favor going outdoors. Cats that are outdoors have
greater opportunity to disperse themselves. Once con-
flicts occur, cats may continue to exist in a tense social
situation for months or years, which affects their daily
welfare, increases stress and reduces freedom to access
resources without fear of confrontation. Harmony in any
household is desirable and a cat that does not get along
with a housemate cat faces a greater risk of relinquish-
ment, daily stresses and potential for injury. In addition,
there are cats living in shelters that would be candidates
to be added to homes if owners could be sure their cats
would get along. The wellbeing of millions of cats may
be enhanced if cats got along with housemate cats.
Domestic canids have well developed social relation-
ships and the appeasement behaviors to maintain them
with a minimum of conflict, whereas felids' natural social
groups and relationships are based on matrilineal bonds
and preferred associates. Felids, from house cats to chee-
tahs, generally prefer to avoid other cats except when
parenting or when sexually attracted.8,9 As cats are not
dependent on social relationships to hunt cooperatively,
they are not required to reconcile following agonistic
interactions. They therefore almost uniformly lack
appeasement and reconciliative behaviors.8,9 When cats
are forced into involuntary interaction, they prefer to
avoid direct physical conflict.6,10 The cost vs benefit ratio
of such events is high and risk of injury great. However,
lacking the methods of appeasement common in dogs
(eg, averted gaze, rolling on the back, licking the face,
submissive urination), feline intra-specific aggression
may quickly escalate to a serious physical or vocal con-
frontation. According to a 2016 literature review by the
American Veterinary Medical Association on the welfare
implications of declawing of domestic cats, there was not
strong evidence that declawing increases the risk of
undesirable behaviors or decreases the observance of
desirable behaviors.11 However, a recent telephone sur-
vey suggests a higher incidence of elimination misbehav-
iors by cats that are declawed.12 Moreover, a recent
retrospective study also identified that onychectomy
(declawing) could affect feline behavior, with signifi-
cantly increased odds of aggression in declawed cats
with radiographic evidence of residual P3 fragments, and
even cats with no evidence of residual P3 had an increased
odds of biting (odds ratio 3.0).13
Kittens will form strong social relationships during
the `sensitive period' or the window of optimal socializa-
tion that occurs between 2 and 7 weeks of age.14
Curiously, during these first few weeks of age is the time
of natural cat-appeasing pheromone release by the
queen; coincidentally or causally at a time when kittens
are living in groups with very few conflicts and competi-
tion. When they are adults, however, cats may not invest
significant energy in maintaining social bonds or recon-
ciling broken bonds following conflict. Not all cats living
within the same home may be members of the same
social groups; there may be pairs or triads of cats that are
affiliative and other individuals or dyads that are not.10
Inter-cat conflict may begin when cats are first intro-
duced to one another, or it may develop among cats that
formerly had good affiliative bonds. Conflict may
develop abruptly following a specific incident (eg, the
introduction of a new pet in the home, one cat returning
from a veterinary visit or a change at home that may
have had an impact on availability of resources such as
food or elimination places). Conflict may also develop
gradually. The conflict may be obvious if cats are hissing,
swatting, growling or screaming, or quite subtle, such
that passive avoidance may go unnoticed by even obser-
vant owners.
Conflict between housemate cats may have elements
of fear, anxiety, self-defense or territorial defense. Other
behavioral consequences may include urine retention,
undesired elimination outside the litter box or urine
marking. 8,15­17 Medical consequences may include feline
idiopathic cystitis.8,15 Some cats may face restricted
DePorter et al 3
access to food owing to social conflicts and thus may
gulp or overeat when they do eat, whereas other cats
may suffer weight loss.18
Treatment of severe conflicts between house cats has
been described as challenging and is often considered
difficult to completely resolve.8,15­17 Reported therapies
range from medications such as diazepam, clomi-
pramine, fluoxetine and buspirone to complex reintro-
duction programs.8,15­17 While many cats that struggle
with conflicts may benefit from medications, it may be
difficult to administer oral medications and often own-
ers are hesitant to `drug' their cats. Management and
behavior modification strategies are tedious, time con-
suming and challenging for owners to implement with
the necessary consistency. Controlled reintroductions
may occur while one or more cats are observed, crate-
confined or harnessed. Such programs may be success-
ful, but may also be detrimental if carried out
improperly.8,15­17 Commonly recommended punishment
strategies for aggressive displays have included blasting
foghorns, spraying with water, yelling and clapping
hands. All are more likely to startle the cats rather than
facilitate a peaceful reconciliation.8,15­17 Punishment
strategies do not create an atmosphere suitable for recon-
ciliation and a single traumatic interaction may reverse
weeks or months of meticulous behavior modification
and can be extremely frustrating for owners and the cats.
Cats, like most mammals, are able to communicate
with other members of the species by leaving and detect-
ing messages in the form of pheromones deposited in the
environment.19­21 Pheromones are substances secreted
from sebaceous mucous or sweat glands by an individ-
ual and received by others of the same species, in which
it releases a specific reaction.19,20 Pheromones are classi-
fied by their modes of action, rather than chemical com-
position. The chemical diversity of pheromones ranges
from small, volatile molecules to sulfated steroids to
large families of proteins.
Cats may deposit pheromones by leaving scents in
the environment by means of face rubbing (eg, facial
pheromones), urine marking or scratching on upright
surfaces (eg, feline interdigital semiochemical), whereas
appeasing pheromones are released from the mammary
area.19 Pheromones are then received by the vomerona-
sal organ (VNO), a paired tubular structure located just
above the hard palate near the intranasal septum.19­21
When pheromone molecules are first detected by a cat,
further olfactory investigation occurs, which is charac-
terized by a tongue lick to the nose, followed by the cat's
gazing in a `thoughtful', `preoccupied' fashion while the
upper lips are raised slightly and fluffed, with the mouth
slightly open.22 This is called a flehmen response or
`gape', which serves to facilitate gathering the phero-
mones into the passageways.19,21,22 The pheromone mol-
ecules then interact with receptors in the VNO, which
stimulate structures within the limbic system to alter the
animal's emotional state or activate physiologic effects.
Feline-appeasing pheromones are released by mam-
mary sebaceous glands of the queen during the nursing
period, appearing 3­4 days after parturition and persist-
ing until 2­5 days after the weaning of the kittens (2­3
months maximum).19,20 These pheromones are most bio-
logically active during the socialization period and thus
are likely to enhance bond formation while comforting
and reassuring the neonates. A commercially available
synthetic copy of the dog appeasing pheromone (Adaptil,
previously known as DAP; Ceva Santé Animale) has
demonstrated calming properties in a variety of clinically
and behaviorally relevant situations.23­31 Similarly to the
dog appeasing pheromone, a synthetic analog of the
feline-appeasing pheromone has been developed, which
is now commercially available (the formulation used in
this trial is currently commercially available as Feliway
MultiCat in the USA and as Feliway Friends in Europe;
Ceva Santé Animale). One study demonstrated that
maternal pheromones reduced aggressive interactions
during a controlled exposure of dyads of adult cats.32
Case reports have suggested an influence on feline
aggression between housemate cats.33,34 It is hypothe-
sized that the addition of the synthetic pheromone to the
environment in multi-cat households may reduce inter-
cat aggression by enhancing social affiliations and
increasing the cats' sense of wellbeing. The present pilot
study was intended to test this hypothesis.
Materials and methods
A double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled field
trial was conducted to evaluate the clinical effectiveness
of a 28 day treatment period with a proprietary synthetic
cat-appeasing pheromone analog (Feliway Friends) in
the reduction of inter-cat aggression. The pheromone
(2% w/w) solution and the equivalent placebo solution
without the pheromone were provided with a pair of
plug-in diffusers and a 50 ml flask containing 48 ml of
the respective test materials. The test article and the pla-
cebo diffusers, flasks and solutions were identical in
appearance.
The test unit was the individual household. Forty-five
multi-cat households of 2­5 cats each were enrolled.
Demographic information regarding the duration and
nature of the aggression, nature of onset (abrupt vs grad-
ual) and number of cats in the household was obtained.
Each enrolled household was reported by the owner to
have a history of inter-cat aggression of at least 2 weeks'
duration, as evidenced by at least one fight and four
aggressive encounters occurring within the previous 2
weeks. Fights were described and defined by tense body
tone, freezing, staring, agitated (angry) vocalizations
and may have included a bite, scratch and physical con-
tact such as swatting. Physical confrontations need not
4 Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery
necessarily have resulted in injury. The cat's aggressive
encounters (fights or displays) could include any of the
following signs: stalking, chasing, fleeing, hiding, swat-
ting, staring, blocking, growling, hissing, spitting,
crouching, tail twitching or tail puffing. Video examples
were shown to the volunteers to help them distinguish
between fight encounters and play behaviors. Play was
described as being characterized by the cats' loose mus-
cle tone, more physical contact, including gentle wrap-
ping of the paws, mock predatory pouncing, and
inhibited mouthing and the lack of accompanying vocal-
izations characteristic of aggression.
Recruitment was a convenience sample of households
in the Midwestern United States and potential partici-
pants were recruited by distribution of an information
flyer describing the clinical trial. Social and broadcast
media were also used to recruit potential cases, and fly-
ers were distributed. Interested cat owners who believed
they met the inclusion criteria contacted the behaviorist
by telephone or via a study-dedicated email address.
Owners were preliminarily screened by a checklist-
directed telephone interview to determine eligibility.
To complete enrollment in the study, owners were
required to attend one of a series of scheduled meetings
held at Oakland Veterinary Referral Services (Bloomfield
Hills, MI, USA). Enrollment meetings consisted of a
PowerPoint presentation on feline behavior and aggres-
sion, as well as the particulars of the study (see Figure 1).
As transport of cats to the hospital may have increased
stress, influenced patterns of social interactions or caused
general changes in activity, the owners were instructed
not to bring their cats to the meeting and no cats were
evaluated directly by the investigators during the study.
Incentives for participants consisted of a $50 gift card
upon completion of the study and a gift of the pheromone
test product when it became commercially available.
All cats were at least 6 months of age at enrollment.
No restrictions were placed on breed or sex, but sexually
intact males were excluded. All cats spent at least 16 h a
day indoors with unrestricted access to common areas
and each other throughout the home. Cats with a history
of serious aggression towards humans and/or extreme
aggression toward other cats and cats with concomitant
medical conditions that may interfere with evaluation of
effectiveness were excluded. No treatments with facial
pheromones or psychoactive nutraceuticals in the 4
weeks prior to day 0 (D0) were allowed for any of the
cats in the study. Households with cats receiving any
psychotropic medications such as tricyclic antidepres-
sants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or benzodi-
azepines in the 3 months prior to D0 were likewise
excluded. Behavioral modification was not permitted,
beyond the instructions provided for handling aggres-
sive events. Both the treatment and placebo groups were
provided the same recommendations.
Randomization was based on order of attendance at the
enrollment meeting; households were assigned to their
respective treatment groups (ie, either test article or pla-
cebo) according to a simple, blocked, randomization list
provided by the study statistician. No stratification factors
were utilized. The test materials were provided by Ceva
SantéAnimale. Each cat owner was provided a single plas-
tic bag containing two identical diffusers that were to be
plugged in the home for a 28-day treatment period. Each
diffuser was labeled with a unique identification number
consisting of two digits according to the randomization
list, followed by the letter Aor B, indicating pairs of identi-
cal treatment vials. The investigator and all support per-
sonal at the enrollment center were completely masked to
treatment identity and treatment groups. Households
were provided with the test articles at the enrollment
meeting but were instructed not to install them for 1 week.
During the enrollment meeting, training on the methods
of behavioral evaluation to be used in the study was pro-
vided; ie, the use of daily diaries and of a scale specifically
designed to assess inter-cat aggressive interactions. Owners
were to use the same assessment tools throughout the
study. Participants were also provided directions for han-
dling aggressive events (see Appendix 1 in the supplemen-
tary material), including classical conditioning, redirection
by positive reinforcement and not punishing or startling
for aggressive displays. Additionally, owners were given
approximately 90 mins of education on the interpretation
of cat behavior, including videos of representative inter-cat
interactions to help owners accurately interpret their cats'
behavior over the course of the study. Owners were trained
by the behaviorist through description and video illustra-
tion to be able to better distinguish between affiliative inter-
cat behaviors, neutral and passive, and overt aggressive
behaviors. Examples of positive inter-cat interactions
included nose touching, allogrooming, co-sleeping with
close physical contact and tail-up greetings.
Detailed instructions were provided regarding the
use of the diffusers. Each owner drew a diagram of their
home's floor plan and the areas in which the cats spent

their time (see example in Figure 2). The optimal location
for each diffuser was selected by the investigator based
on the primary resting location for involved cats, avail-
ability of appropriate electrical outlets and avoidance of
open windows. Diffusers were plugged in from D0­D28.
Owners were asked to check the warmth and liquid vol-
ume in each diffuser weekly and this was confirmed by
weekly telephone interview. To assess any potential
post-treatment effect of the pheromone or regression fol-
lowing withdrawal, assessments for each household
were continued for two additional weeks. Each house-
hold's participation was complete upon conclusion of
the day 42 (D42) evaluation.
Two types of assessment methods were used in the
study: daily diary entries (from D­7 to D42) and the
weekly Oakland Feline Social Interaction Scale (OFSIS)
questionnaire (see Appendix 2 in the supplementary
material). Daily dairy entries consisted of answering two
questions pertaining to the occurrence of aggressive
events or fights between the cats in the household,
whether they had aggressive encounters or fought that
day, and, if so, how many times aggressive behaviors or
fighting were observed. Owners were instructed to have
the same person complete the diary throughout the
study, though input and observations from all family
members were allowed. Owners were asked to fax or
email diaries weekly to the investigator.
In addition to the daily diary, a weekly questionnaire
was used to gain more specific data on the types of
aggressive interactions in the home. Beginning on D­7 at
the enrollment meeting, then weekly thereafter, owners
were asked to describe their cats' responses to house-
mate cats and consider all interactions, which they could
recall for the previous week. Over the course of the
study, owners were instructed not to change their typical
routines, but rather assess the level of aggressive interac-
tions based upon their typical level of observation.
The weekly questionnaire used was designated the
Oakland Feline Social Interaction Scale (OFSIS)­
Aggression and was developed by the investigator spe-
cifically for this study based on common owner-reported
signs of conflict and on a literature review. The scale
was used to provide a quantifiable measure of the fre-
quency and intensity of 12 inter-cat interactions reflect-
ing conflict between cats. Development of this scale was
inspired by the Lincoln Sound-sensitivity Scale, which
utilizes a quantifiable measure of the frequency and
intensity of signs of noise-related fears.19 OFSIS included
incidence (yes/no), frequency (how often observed)
and intensity (magnitude of response) for each behavior
relating to level of aggression between housemate cats.
The primary outcome measure for each household was
the OFSIS­Aggression score, which was calculated
using the following formula: OFSIS aggression score
Dx = (i=1­ 12)
(frequency[Qi
]*intensity[Qi
]) where, Dx =
D­7, D0, D7, D14, D21, D28, D35 and D42, and Qi

see Appendix 2 in supplementary material). The
Figure 2 Typical household diagram with cats' preferred resting areas and diffuser placement
6 Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery
potential OFSIS­Aggression scores for each household
ranged from 0 (no aggressive behaviors at all recorded
on the scale) to 360 (each parameter was scored maxi-
mally). As the OFSIS was to serve as an assessment of
inter-cat aggression across all cats in the home, a single
score for each question applied to the home, not to a
specific cat, and each score was to be made according to
the most extreme manifestation among their household
cats. The 12 behaviors described in the OFSIS question-
naire (see Appendix 2 in the supplementary material)
could further be classified by the predominant offensive
or fearful manifestations of conflict-related behaviors ­
offensive (1, 2, 3, 7, 10, 11) and fear (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12) ­
which could be displayed by any cats in the home. To
further illustrate affiliative behaviors, the weekly ques-
tionnaires also included questions on harmony, which
represented how well the cats were getting along with
each other and family members.
OFSIS questionnaires were completed in person at the
enrollment meeting. OFSIS assessments and the daily
diary were returned to investigator on D0, D7, D14, D21
and D28. Any concerns were clarified during the tele-
phone interview. On D28, owners were also asked
`Generally, do you find your cats are getting along bet-
ter?'. A trained technician conducted the phone inter-
views and recorded a yes/no polar conclusion. Upon
conclusion of the D28 telephone interview, owners were
instructed to remove the diffusers. To assess any poten-
tial post-treatment effect of the pheromone, daily diaries
were maintained and two additional weekly OFSIS tele-
phone interviews were conducted on D35 and D42.
Statistical analysis
We used SAS 9.3 software (SAS Institute) for the statisti-
cal analyses. Results are expressed as mean ± SD or n
(%). Tests were two-sided and as this was a pilot study
the significance threshold was set at 0.10. The experi-
mental unit was the household and the sample size was
45 enrolled households. Baseline characteristics were
compared between the two treatment groups. When a
clinical difference was found, the difference was tested
(Fisher's exact test). The main analysis was conducted
on repeated measures from D0­D28. A generalized lin-
ear mixed model (GLIMMIX) for repeated measures was
built with comparing the proprietary cat-appeasing
pheromone product vs placebo, assessment points, inter-
action study pheromone by assessment point and base-
line as fixed factors. As the group by assessment point
interaction was not significant, the interaction was
skipped from further models. The analyses were per-
formed for both the full analysis set (FAS) and the per
protocol (PP) set, with the analysis of the PP population
being used in a robustness purpose (Figure 3). Owing to
the very low number of cases with a major deviation, the
other parameters were analyzed on the FAS population
only. As the overall results of the FAS and the PP popula-
tions were similar, herein only results from the FAS pop-
ulation are presented. The impact of the number of cats
in the household was analyzed in a mixed model with
study pheromone and assessment point as fixed factors.
Random factors were the number of cats in the house-
hold and interaction between the number of cats and
group. As this interaction was found to be non-signifi-
cant, it was removed from the model, which only
included treatment group, baseline values and assess-
ment date. In addition, the evolution from D0­D42 was
compared between study pheromone using a mixed
model for repeated measures.
Results
Of the 45 households that provided informed consent, 20
were enrolled in the treatment group and 25 in the pla-
cebo group (corresponding to the FAS). Forty-two house-
holds completed the study, 17 in the treatment group
and 25 in the placebo group (corresponding to the PP
population). A simple randomization list was utilized,
which was balanced on blocks of cases with an antici-
pated total of 60 cases, but enrollment was ceased at 45
subjects, which resulted in uneven groups. There were
three cases of major deviations and all were in the treat-
ment group: one family found and introduced a kitten
into the household, one household did not comply with
required follow-up and one owner elected to discon-
tinue participation when the aggression resolved but the

cat that had previously been reclusive began toileting on
household items. In all three deviations, the level of con-
flict was reported to be improving. No treatment-related
adverse events were reported. At D0, there were no dif-
ferences between the two treatment groups (whether
considering FAS or PP populations), except for the num-
ber of cats in each household. There were more two-cat
households and fewer four- and five-cat households in
the pheromone-treated group than in the placebo group
(Table 1). The difference in number of cats per household
was significant in the FAS population (P = 0.04) while
trending similarly in the PP population (P = 0.09).
The resulting OFSIS­Aggression scores (possible
0­360) are described in Table 2 and Figure 4. Baseline
values were highly correlated between groups on both
D­7 and D0. During the enrollment period (D­7 to D0),
the OFSIS­Aggression score decreased similarly in both
groups. During the treatment period (D0­D28), the
OFSIS­Aggression score continued to decrease in both
groups, but the decrease was greater in the appeasing
pheromone group than in the placebo group. Separation
of the group means by treatment was apparent by D7,
reaching a distinguishable improvement by D14 (P =
0.0833). Mean OFSIS scores reached the highest differ-
ence and were significantly different by group on D21 (P
= 0.0308; Table 2, Figure 4). Diffusers were unplugged
on D28 and each household was followed for an addi-
tional 2 weeks. Differences between treatment group
means persisted during this post-treatment observation
period with the treatment group OFSIS scores compara-
tively stable, while the placebo group mean slowly
began to regress (showing worsening conflict).
Statistically, there was a trend at D35 (P = 0.12) and sig-
nificance at D42 (P = 0.0357). When a repeated-measures
analysis was performed on all treatment points collec-
tively from D0­D42 the difference between treatment
and placebo was statistically significant (P = 0.0431).
At inclusion (D­7) all 12 aggressive behaviors (Table 3)
were represented in all included households, with 8/12
aggressive behaviors described in the OFSIS question-
naire (staring, stalking, chasing, fleeing, crouching,
hissing/growling/spitting, tail twitching/lashing and
blocking) displayed in more than 75% of the homes. An
overview of descriptive information on the enrolled cats
and households is provided in Table 4.
Feline harmonious and affiliative behaviors may be
subtle and poorly identified by owners.
Questions about the affiliative interactions within the
housemate cats were included. Of the eight affiliative
behaviors included in the OFSIS­Harmony question-
naire (Appendix 2 in the supplementary material), three

(greeting family members, tail-up posture during home-
coming greeting, sleeping in moderate contact) by
around 50% of cases. The other two (rubbing on a person
during home-coming greeting, snuggling or sleeping
with a seated person) were generally displayed by <40%
of cases. Using the sum of the yes answers to the eight
harmony questions did not show any difference between
the two groups. The OFSIS­Harmony score was similar
in both groups at D­7 and D0 and then only slightly
higher in the appeasing pheromone group throughout
the study period (ranging from 11.1­13.9 in the appeas-
ing pheromone group and from 11.2­12.4 in the placebo
group). From D7 onwards it was always higher in the
pheromone-treated group than in the placebo group, but
the difference was not significant. Moreover, the overlap
of SE values confirmed there was no statistically signifi-
cant difference (P >0.05) in OFSIS­Harmony scores
between the treated and the placebo groups.
Ultimately, owner perception of satisfaction with the

Enrollment in the study was based on owner perception
of conflict between housemate cats and thus the query
`Generally, do you find that your cats are getting along
better?' was used to assess the owner perception of ame-
lioration of that conflict. In the cat-appeasing pheromone
group 84.2% vs 64% in the placebo group reported that
they perceived their cats were getting along better (P =
0.14).
Discussion
Demographic data (Table 4) were reviewed for patterns
as compared with general populations but considered
too few to assess for treatment effect. In this study, the
average number of cats per home was 3.0 and 13/45
homes in this study (29%) had four or five cats. Of the
137 cats, 55.4% were female. Most were mixed-breed
cats, but 10% were purebred cats. Owners identified 66
cats as the aggressor and only a slightly higher propor-
tion of those were males: (30 female [45%] and 36 male
[55%]), whereas twice as many females as males were
considered a victim (67% vs 32%).
Owing to the unequal number of cats per households
in both groups, and as the randomization was not strati-
fied according to the number of cats, this criteria was
included as a covariate in the statistical mixed model.

treatment group was tested and found to be non-
significant (P = 0.9). This meant that the unequal num-
ber of cats per home did not have an impact on the
results. Consequently, this interaction was removed
from the statistical model, which only included treat-
ment group, baseline values and assessment date.
Variables such as the square footage of a home, the
number of floors of a home and the areas to which cats
have access are not easily controlled and may be useful
data to collect but are difficult to interpret in a study of
this size. According to 2013 US Census information the
average home in the USA was reported to be 1500 square
feet, with homes in the Midwest average ranging from
1615­2265 square feet, depending on the year built
(1973­2010).35,36 In this study, 82% of the homes were
<2499 square feet and 49% of homes were <1499 square
feet (see Table 4), consistent with the common assertion
that less available territory is consistent with mainte-
nance of feline conflict. The availability and distribution
of cat's resources in the home is a key element of inter-
cat relationship factors, but they are difficult to assess in
this type of study. Home size is also consistent with
package directions that at least two diffusers should be
provided to cover the size of these homes.
Conflict between housemate cats is generally consid-
ered to have a poor prognosis for successful alleviation
of the signs of conflict, occurrence of reconciliation and
development of affiliative bonds between housemate
cats. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized and
placebo-controlled study to evaluate a treatment inter-
vention in households with inter-cat aggression. In this
study a synthetic analog of an appeasing pheromone
was hypothesized to influence social bonding based on
the natural occurrence of high levels of cat-appeasing
pheromones delivered from the queen prior to and
simultaneous to the occurrence of the socialization win-
dow. The primary investigator (TLD) speculated that
there may be a natural and causal relationship between
the presence of appeasing pheromones and the enhance-
ment of social interactions. Thus, we speculate that the
beneficial effect on social interactions is achieved by sim-
ilar mechanisms as during the natural pliable socializa-
tion window.
As inter-cat aggression has been insufficiently studied,
the primary investigator (TLD) was required to develop a
useful metric to assess the frequency and severity of
aggression within the home. The OFSIS captures the fre-
quency and intensity of 12 behaviors reflecting inter-cat
aggression, and the total OFSIS score was formed by the
summation of the 12 scores. Thus, the OFSIS score could
theoretically range from 0 for cats that exhibited none of
the listed aggressive behaviors to 360 for homes where
cats exhibited the entire constellation of listed behaviors
with maximum frequency and intensity.
The predominant limitation of the OFSIS is that it
relies entirely upon owner interpretation, making
validation complicated. Future studies should include
validation by either a test­retest reliability or an inter-
rater reliability assessment. Low-level or passive aggres-
sion is likely to be under-reported or under-represented.
Moderate or extreme overt aggression would be clear
but could result in a higher rate of relinquishment, and
thus cats with extremely high OFSIS scores are also
potentially under-represented. The owner's perception
of conflict is actually a pivotal factor as the owner may
resolve to relinquish a cat that poses the greatest risk to a
cat's welfare and wellbeing. Although the volunteers did
record the number of fights and aggressive encounters
per day, these parameters were not useful in analysis as
these did not successfully quantify the severity. Owner
interpretation of `fights' did vary as the aggressive
encounters ranged from passive staring to fights. Some
owners reported finding tufts of fur. Thus, there were
differences between the initial weekly number of fights
and weekly number of aggressive encounters in both
groups (at D0), making this parameter less relevant for
analysis, whereas the OFSIS scores, reflecting globally all
aspects of the conflict, were similar at baseline.
Analysis of the scale's component questions was per-
formed to reveal if simplification of the scale was appro-
priate and it was determined the scale was most useful
in its entirety. When the 12 questions were assessed sepa-
rately for frequency and intensity the results were not
more discriminating: all of the questions were repre-
sented at inclusion (Table 3), and all 12 decreased in fre-
quency and intensity throughout the study period,
regardless of their initial incidence, differently between
the two groups. For example, `fleeing from housemate
cats', a very frequent sign reported in 90% of appeasing
pheromone homes and 88% of placebo homes at D0, was
only reported in 55% and 76%, respectively, at D21,
whereas `screaming', only reported by 40% of appeasing
pheromone homes and 48% of placebo homes at D0,
decreased up to 10% and 24%, respectively, at D21. While
the manifestation of conflict may vary between different
households, the composite design of the scale accounted
for this expected variability by quantifying each behav-
ior associated with inter-cat conflict (eg, staring vs stalk-
ing vs biting) while simultaneously qualifying the
intensity. The scale was intended to capture changes in
these parameters over time and, potentially, in response
to treatment, realizing that certain aggressive behaviors
may change in intensity or frequency or both. The
aggressive behavior may be considered as a matrix of
frequency vs intensity of signs of conflict and provided a
range of options for owner reporting.
As a practical matter, the households in the study
clustered around the lower half of the scale, indicating
that cats tended to exhibit several behaviors, but not all
behaviors, and that the most extreme cases were not rep-
resented, partially because they were purposely excluded
from the study for safety and welfare reasons. As feline
DePorter et al 11
interactions change there is also a change in the manifes-
tation of signs as some cats were hiding at the onset of
the study and thus rarely present to participate in more
passive behaviors such as staring or blocking.
The strength of the above approach is that it captured a
variety of data across the multidimensional nature of
aggression. A potential weakness, however, is that the
scale gives equal weight to each possible behavior. In raw
numerical terms, a household with cats that have frequent
episodes of intense fighting may be given a score equal to
another home where the cats do not fight at all but have
frequent episodes of intense staring or stalking. Both con-
ditions represent an adverse impact on the cats' welfare.
Whether these situations are, in fact, `behaviorally equiva-
lent' is an open question, but the scale assumes they are.
The OFSIS should be qualified by a test and retest statisti-
cal approach as validation by any `gold-standard' diagno-
sis is not possible and all diagnosis will rely on the
clinician's interpretation of owner descriptions.
The households enrolled in the study all had inter-cat
aggression evaluated on D­7; however, most experi-
enced a drop in the OFSIS score prior to D0, in the
absence of any treatment. It is possible the owners over-
reported the level of aggression that had occurred in the
7 days prior. Though repeatedly reminded to consider
only the immediate prior 7 day period, owners were
motivated to participate and concerned about their cats
welfare regarding a problem that had existed, in some
cases, for months or years. Given the consistency of this
observation across the households, the authors attribute
this drop ­ in the absence of contrary evidence ­ to the
effects of the training session with the behaviorist and
primary investigator on D­7. Merely understanding the
reasons why cats may act out with aggression may have
reduced the owner's perception of the signs of conflict.
Further, changing the strategies from a punitive-based to
a positive reinforcement-based approach may have
immediately reduced stress for the owners and the cats.
It seems instinctive for owners to wish to intervene in
whatever manner is effective to stop an aggressive event
between cats. Even many veterinarians have recom-
mended the use of distractors such as spray bottles, and
loud noises in order to stop an aggressive event. While
these interventions may result in a temporary victory, it
is often pyrrhic and short lived. Cats typically resume
their aggressive behavior when what they perceive as
the greater threat (eg, the water bottle or the noise) is
dissipated. Aggressive behaviors should be redirected
whenever feasible by using positive reinforcement and
cues. As owners were instructed to implement such
changes, the decrease in OFSIS score prior to D0 seems
attributable to the change in intervention tactics.
An interesting finding was the improvement of the
OFSIS­Aggression score before treatment, D­7 to D0, in
both groups (Figure 4). During the initial training meet-
ing, at least one representative from each household was
given instruction on cat behavior and how to appropri-
ately and effectively intervene when inter-cat aggression
arose. Punishment was discouraged (eg, spraying cats
with water) and positive redirection strategies (eg, food)
were suggested. This change in management at home
may be sufficient to explain the drop in mean scores
between D­7 and D0, irrespective of group. These man-
agement strategies, while confounding, were under-
taken in consideration for the welfare of the cats and
because most interventions that reduce anxiety may be
less effective if punishment is imposed. This may have
contributed to a relevant portion of the improvement
seen in both groups throughout the study. However,
unexpectedly after the treatment period, the OFSIS score
in the treatment group remained stable while the aggres-
sion score in the placebo group began to rise (Figure 4).
The authors postulate that the pheromone treatment
enhanced the affected cats' learning ability and initiated
a new balance, so-called reconciliation, in their social
interactions, resulting in a more persistent behavioral
change after the treatment was withdrawn on D28
(Figure 4). While it is interesting that cats in pheromone-
treated households continued to improve (as demon-
strated by the OFSIS score) during the brief 2 week
post-treatment period, this short period is insufficient to
draw a long-term conclusion. Perhaps long-term treat-
ment with pheromones may be beneficial but may not
always be required, as cats that learn how to `get along'
may retain that ability, but this is beyond the scope of
this study. It is uncertain whether any post-treatment
effect would be reduced by changes in the home such as
introduction or removal of animals, a member of the
family moving in or out, or movement of the entire
household; all of which are known to affect feline behav-
ior and, potentially, inter-cat aggression. Future studies
should examine a longer post-treatment period.
Difference between groups was found to be statisti-
cally significant over the full study period (D0­D42). The
highest differences between groups occurred at D14,
D21 and D42. The most important clinical effect for the
pheromone treatment seemed to occur within the first
14­21 days. This time interval allows for saturation of
the environment by the diffusers, opportunity for the
cats to have been sufficiently exposed to the phero-
mones, modulation of each cat's perception and the
impact of learning/anticipation there may be a change
in social interactions.
While the OFSIS­Aggression proved discriminatory
for measuring conflict, the assessment of affiliative inter-
actions by the OFSIS­Harmony, as designed, was less
insightful. The harmony questions were complicated for
clients to answer in multi-cat households, which included
not only populations of aggressive dyads, but also, in
some households, affiliative dyads. The OFSIS­Harmony
questions were designed to ask about all cats in the home
and not specific dyads. The question format (eg, `any of
12 Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery
your cats' and `did all of your cats') proved very difficult
for owners to answer. Further, some behaviors, such as
sleeping in the same room together, occurred commonly
in households but may not be a good measure of affilia-
tive interactions in cats as some cats did not have another
option for resting areas. The authors believe measuring
an increase in harmonious interactions along with a con-
comitant decrease in inter-cat aggression would be useful
inevaluatinginter-catbehaviors,buttheOFSIS­Harmony
questions should be revised in future versions.
Evaluation of the composition of homes with cats that
do not get along is intriguing, but interpretation has lim-
itations as there are correlations that may not be causal.
Further, the population of cats that do not get along is
plagued by a culling process: cats, both the aggressors
and the victims, in highly volatile homes may be
removed by relinquishment, euthanasia or simply by
escaping/running away. Factors that influence retention
rather than relinquishment of a cat do have a dramatic
impact on human decisions: some cats were inherited
from a loved one, whereas others were acquired from a
breeder, and these factors may impact strongly on reten-
tion, despite severe or persistent conflict. Sixty-two per-
cent of the cats were noted to be aggressive after the cats
had been living together without apparent conflict,
which suggests that either owners are unaware of the
signs of low-level conflict, or cats may become conflicted
and not reconcile spontaneously.
A surprising finding in this study (Table 4) was the
unexpectedly high percentage of declawed cats: 47.4% vs
24.4% declawed cats in the overall cat population of the
USA.11 Among the aggressors, 44% (29/66) were
declawed, whereas 56% (37/66) were not declawed.
Among the victims, 60% (31/52) were declawed, whereas
40% (21/52) were non-declawed. While this trends
toward an adverse effect of declawing on feline social
relationships, these findings were not statistically signifi-
cant. The investigator has completed two subsequent and
similar studies on inter-cat conflicts, which are beyond
the scope of this paper. An analysis of these unpublished
data showed that of the 757 cats from 246 households
33.9% (n = 257) were declawed, which further supports
the suggestion in the present study that there may be a
correlation between declaw status and ongoing conflict
between housemate cats. The investigator speculates that
declaw status of either the aggressor or the victims may
have an impact on ongoing aggression. If sufficient
defense is not possible by the declawed cat, the threat of
dangerous weapons is described as a primary ethological
reason for the complex facial communications shared by
all domestic and wild felids.9 This finding is confounded
by multiple cats nested within households and it is
unclear if cats were declawed as a result of the ongoing
conflict or if the declawing preceded the onset of aggres-
sion. Cats may be declawed much more commonly in the
USA than in other parts of the world.11 Regardless, the
high percentage of cats that are declawed and in homes
with inter-cat aggression is an interesting finding which
warrants future investigation.
Conclusions
In this study, treatment with a proprietary cat-appeasing
pheromone diffuser for 4 weeks showed a beneficial
effect in the management of feline aggression in multi-cat
households. During the study, when cat owners were
educated by a board-certified veterinary behaviorist
about feline behavior, provided instruction on handling
aggressive events and discouraged from punishing cats
(eg, squirt guns or other startle methods), the level of
conflict began to decrease even prior to implementation
of the treatment. Pheromones may be useful as a compo-
nent of a complete behavior-modification program.8,15,16,21
Considering the duration of aggression in these homes
averaged 901 days (median 594 days), the ability of the
treatment to have an impact on long-term aggression in
only 4 weeks is promising. The OFSIS­Aggression score
is a useful tool in the evaluation and monitoring of
aggression between housemate cats in a field setting.
Demographic data suggest that declawing may be associ-
ated with increased conflict between housemate cats and
that both sexes were almost as likely to be the aggressor,
thoughfemalesweremoreoftenthevictims.Furthermore,
educating owners regarding the meaning of feline pos-
tures, charting progress by means of the OFSIS, ceasing
of punishment, implementing classical conditioning and
use of an appeasing pheromone that enhances social
interactions together provide a complete professional
program for assisting owners and their cats.
