Prologue
A total of 57 seventh graders were reciting five words in a
classroom. One period per week, Mr. Yi1, our Sino-Korean
teacher, taught us not only Classic Chinese characters but
also the values embedded in each one.
Mr. Yi: In-Ui-Ye-Ji-Sin ()!
Students: In-Ui-Ye-Ji-Sin ()!
Mr. Yi: Benevolence In, righteousness Ui, propriety
Ye, wisdom Ji, sincerity Sin!
Students: Benevolence In, righteousness Ui, propriety
Ye, wisdom Ji, sincerity Sin!
I recall his passion for explaining the meaning of
each word, as well as his basic knowledge about Confucian
teaching.
Mr. Yi: OK, class. Benevolence In. This character is
the combination of "human" () and "two" ().
When two people live together, they have to be
benevolent, generous, and kind to each other. This
is the most important lesson that Confucius taught.
Repeat after me, Benevolence In!
Students: Benevolence In!
Mr. Yi explicated the meaning and etymology of the word
while writing the character on the blackboard. Then he asked
us to repeat, while memorizing the meaning and pronuncia-
tion at the same time.
Mr. Yi: Righteousness Ui!
Students: Righteousness Ui!
Mr. Yi: Sometimes, you guys say to each other, "We
should keep our Ui-ri (loyalty, )" or "You are
such a disloyal guy." When do you say this?
Student A: When my friend is loyal to me, he has
Ui-ri. If my friend betrays me for his selfishness, he
becomes a disloyal friend.
Mr. Yi: That's correct. Righteousness Ui is similar in
meaning to Ui-ri. Ui means righteousness, faithful-
ness, loyalty, and justice. Confucius taught people
to move beyond their own personal interests, and
immediate benefit to a community's interest and the
long-term benefit of a society.

Disciplinary Images of "Korean-Ness":
Autobiographical Interrogations
on the Panopticon
Seungho Moon1
Abstract
The purpose of this study is to generate complicated conversations about identity and culture with an examination of
various panoptic technologies, including separation, invisibility, control, and productivity. Drawn from Foucault's panopticism,
the author examines how discipline operates as a controlling power in several Korean institutions of schools, the seminary,
and the military.This autobiographical self-reflexive research explores disciplinary images of "Korean-ness," which has been
discursively and materially constructed and embodied via panoptic technologies.These counter-narratives do not support
for the advancement of the universalized version of the "Korean" identity. Rather, the author theorizes Korean identity
as discursive practices in modern power structures, while dealing with the "political `double bind'" of (a) individualization
through instruments of discipline and (b) the reinforcement of Confucian ideal of proper human relationships.This article
provides educators with a lens to examine the ways in which disciplinary power/knowledge operates to control students'
ways of thinking,behaving,and living,in relation to"self,""others," and institutions.By opening possibilities to examine cultural
identity beyond discovering "true" self, the author emphasizes the analyses of power in its examination of cultural sameness/
difference in multicultural curriculum studies.

When Mr. Yi explained the meaning of Ui, he provided
familiar examples for us. Keeping Ui-ri among students was
important because disloyalty to a peer group or other kinds
of groups is a way to be ostracized in the community. From
this familiar concept, Mr. Yi introduced what Confucius
emphasized in his teaching.
Mr. Yi: Propriety Ye!
Students: Propriety Ye!
Mr.Yi:As you should know, Ye is habits of mind to con-
sider other people's situations and reserve yourself.
From ancient times, Koreans are called courteous
people in the East. We should keep this wonderful
tradition. Guided by the Confucian teaching of Ye,
we should respect elders, be humble, and be consid-
erate to others. Please remember to be a courteous
and humble person. This is a way of success. Imag-
ine rice farming. The more rice ripens, the more
rice stalks are bent with grain. Like these ripening
rice stalks, a really knowledgeable person does not
show off his or her knowledge. They are always
courteous, humble, and polite.
Mr. Yi emphasized Ye in his teaching because it governs
all relations in Confucianism. Without Ye, a person is
scarcely civilized (Park, 2006). Mr. Yi's metaphor of ripened
rice stalks was the most widely circulated metaphor among
my teachers, who emphasized the importance of becoming
courteous and humble. For the rest of the class, he addressed
two other basic principles of Confucianism, Ji and Sin. He
underscored the value of Ji, which emphasizes learning and
sharing knowledge with other colleagues, and Sin, which
values trust and sincerity among people, especially friends.
Introduction
Confucian teaching predominantly takes a major role in intro-
ducing Korean culture or the "Korean-ness," including
Confucius's emphasis on strong interpersonal relationship and
harmony, hierarchical social interactions, and high value on
education (De Bary, 1998; Yum, 2000). For example,
Education Fever is a term to introduce Korea's educational
phenomenon that highly values education (e.g., entering a
prestigious university) for keeping and/or promoting social
status grounded in Confucianism (C. J. Lee, 2005; J. Lee,
2006). Daily practices of Confucianism become a tool to
explicate cultural difference between Korean and other cultures
(Kim, 2009; I. Lee & Koro-Ljungberg, 2007; Shin, 2012).
My inquiry in this article begins from the question, "When
teachers' understandings about cultural sameness/difference
are normalized with the use of predetermined identity (e.g.,
Confucianism-based culture), what different approaches might
be possible for the research in cultural identity?" In other words,
"What discourses do I create in the field of multicultural curricu-
lum studies when Korean-ness is essentialized with the use of
Confucian teaching, without explications of discursive practices
in education?" While responding to these questions, this article
purports to generate "complicated conversations" (Pinar,
Reynolds, Slattery, & Taubman, 1995) to imagine diverse
approaches to identity, culture, and education. When research
on/about/of cultural sameness/difference is essentialized in
understanding culture, educators might lose great opportunities
to examine the complexity and ambiguity regarding identity.
I explore possibilities to extend identity research while
challenging the "discovery" of preexisting self, as is the domi-
nant current educational discourse and its practice. Drawing
from the frame of power/knowledge (Foucault, 1980), I
attempt to extend the notions of discursive constructions of the
subject and culture into the field of multicultural curriculum
studies. As I mentioned earlier, I problematize predominant
cultural determinations in terms of normalizing cultural same-
ness/difference. Such elaboration with the frame of panoptic
technologies is a necessary effort to examine complicatedness
of subjectivity and discursive aspects of cultural identity.
Thus, cultural sameness/difference can be applied in the
inquiry into "what possibilities of mobilization are produced"
from the current, existing discursive configurations (Butler,
1992, p. 13).
Among many approaches to identity research, I mainly
interrogate disciplinary strategies that have circulated and
been employed during my upbringing. Most notably, I exam-
ine how my "Korean-ness" has been discursively constructed
and embodied in modern power structures, while dealing
with the "political `double bind'" of (a) instruments of the
panoptic technologies (i.e., individualization techniques)
and (b) the reinforcement of Confucian ideal of proper
human relationships (Foucault, 1983, p. 216). This inquiry is
an attempt to examine the complexity of identity and culture
that cannot be explained by the "Korean" culture without the
analyses of power operations (Foucault, 1977, 1983).
When I examine discipline in this study, I predominantly
borrow Foucault's (1977) concept of biopower that makes
"possible the meticulous control of the operations of the body"
(p. 137). In this inquiry on disciplinary images of Korean-
ness--which is fluid and not essentialized--power/knowledge
becomes a theoretical lens to examine disciplinary power.
According to Foucault, power/knowledge is an "inseparable
configuration of ideas and practices that constitute a discourse"
(Ball, 1990, p. 5), and no power relation exists without the
correlative constitution of knowledge and discourse. Multiple
power relations exist that constitute the social body, and the
nexus of power cannot be implemented without the operation
of discourse (Foucault, 1977; Moon, 2011b).
Foucault (1972) conceptualizes discourses not merely as
groups of signs but as "practices that systematically form the
objects of which they speak" (p. 49). Power resides in the
discursive formation, and it is through discourses that power
is exercised everywhere and always circulating in daily edu-
cational practices (Moon, 2011b). Discourses construct
social meanings of self/other, cultural sameness/difference,
Moon 3
and diversity via power/knowledge in terms of (a) who can
say, (b) what can be thought/spoken, and (c) when, in what
circumstances, and with what authority they are spoken and
circulated (Jabal & Riviere, 2007). Drawing from the power/
knowledge nexus (Foucault, 1980), I mainly examine the
ways in which knowledge is produced and produces subjec-
tivity with the control of body and mind to optimize docility
and productivity, that is, panoptic technologies.
In Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, Foucault
(1977) conceptualizes disciplinary power through panoptic
technologies with the emphasis on invisibility of surveillance
and self-control. The panopticon is a modern architectural
network--not a fixed structure--in which invisible power
operates in a multifaceted, fluid, and porous collection of
networks. The panoptic technology, which is "an exemplary
technology for disciplinary power" (Dreyfus & Rabinow,
1983, p. 192), controls a productive and docile individual.
In this article, I examine the instrument of discipline and pan-
optic technologies. This interrogation explicates the ways in
which "discipline" functions as the controlling power therein
and thus constructed my identities. Overall, panoptic technol-
ogies guide me to examine how the subject is discursively,
socially, and physically constructed as the effect of power/
knowledge.
With the use of self-reflexive autobiographical inquiry--as
a mode of genre and inquiry--I narrate my interpretations of
experiences in Korean school, the seminary, and the military.
I examine how disciplinary power actually operates by the
panoptic technology, and theorize these narratives guided by
the instruments of discipline. I do not introduce my narratives
with the purpose of generating a monolithic version of Korean
identity. My interpretations of my experiences in Korea--that
is always provisional and political--become a launch pad
to explicate the ways in which power/knowledge operates in
several Korean institutions, including schools. Foucault
(1983) mentions, "The analysis of power relations cannot
be reduced to the study of . . . institutions" in that "power rela-
tions are rooted in the system of social network" (p. 224). The
purpose of this study is not merely examining power relations
within several Korean institutions, including the seminary,
military, and schools. Rather, I examine possibilities to review
identity and culture beyond discovering preexisting self/other
by examining social networks and disciplinary technologies.
Ultimately, this study interrogates the (im)possibilities of
conducing identity research "differently" as a political engage-
ment, that is, to recognize students who are not following the
normalized understandings of cultural sameness/difference.
A Self-Reflexive Autobiographical Inquiry
With a use of self-reflexive autobiographical inquiry, I
intend to interrupt methodologies that I draw from con-
structivist and phenomenological narrative research.
These interruptions of conventional narrative research
tradition (Clandinin & Connelly, 2004)­mostly grounded
in ethnographic studies--aim (a) to generate alternative
research methods in self-reflexive autobiographical
inquiry as well as (b) to pry open a space to continue
conversations about what it means to collect data and
analyze it poststructurally in research practices.
My definition of self-reflexive autobiographical inquiry is
influenced by Pillow's (2003) reflexivity of discomfort, which
challenges the humanistic usage of self-reflection grounded
in the recognition of "authentic" self, others, and the truth,
and strives toward a discomforting and interruptive method-
ology. So, when I refer to self-reflexive autobiographical
inquiry, I mean the constant troubling, examination, and dis-
mantling of the autobiographical subject's comfort by the use
of reflexivity to investigate discursively, sociopolitically, cul-
turally, and historically constructed identities, truths, and
realities. In other words, I do not posit that I can and will
discover my Korean identity that is applicable to other
Koreans. I do not intend to analyze a normalized version of
Confucianism to introduce the Korean identity or Korean-
ness. Rather, I investigate sociopolitical, cultural, and histori-
cal contexts wherein the subject is discursively constructed
and embodied within power/knowledge (Foucault, 1980),
that is, knowledge gets produced and produces the subjectivity.
Pillow (2003) begins her theorization of reflexivity of
discomfort from challenging the conventional qualitative
self-reflective research. Namely, postpositivistic qualitative
research seeks to (a) understand self, (b) understand the
other, (c) discover the "existing" truth, and (d) transcend
these understandings of self, the other, and truth as well as
"one's web of situated positionality" (Ilter, 1994, p. 63, as
cited in Pillow, 2003). Pillow interrupts this humanistic
model of reflection by positing a reflexivity of discomfort.
She mentions possibilities of critique beyond a certain kind
of universalized reflexivity, concluding that uncomfortable
reflexivity is about engaging researchers in people's struggles--
struggles that are often caused by monolithic representations
of self/other, truth, and reality. Pillow asserts that the use
of "uncomfortable reflexive practices" (p. 175) possibly
addresses "messy," complicated, discursively constructed
realities, identities, and memories.
As such, Pillow (2003) coins self-reflexivity of dis-
comfort for ethnographic studies. By employing this
methodology, she attempts to dismantle humanistic under-
standings of self, others, truth, and reality that are waiting
out there to be discovered. She also troubles any concept
of the "knowing" researcher with the use of reflexivity of
discomfort. This research is, quite obviously, not an ethno-
graphicstudythattypicallyworkswithresearchparticipant(s).
In this self-reflexivity autobiographical inquiry, I, however,
strategically use self-reflexivity as a means of moving
beyond the "comfort" of discovering my predetermined
Korean experience, reality, memory, and identity. I concen-
trate on the "discomfort" of investigating complexities of
them. With the use of some important methodological impli-
cations from self-reflexivity, I was able, with limits, of
4 SAGE Open
course, to make myself unfamiliar to challenge my
assumptions and taken-for-grantedness about Korean cul-
ture. When grand narratives explicate Confucianism as
sociocultural, philosophical, and ideological foundations in
Korea, I intend to generate counter-narratives to challenge a
normalized version of Korean culture or Korean-ness.
Both as the researcher and the researched in this study, I
narrated my interpretation of experiences--which have
been discursively constructed--by applying reflexivity of
discomfort as a means of an exploration of my subjectivity
in the making (Miller, 2005). My interest was neither recol-
lecting the authentic account of what "really happened" in
my life nor in chronologically listing my life history as an
object that was transparent, linear, and waiting "out there"
to be "discovered" and represented. In this autobiographical
work, I investigated how my national, ethnic, and cultural
identities have been discursively and socially constructed as
a means to constantly trouble, challenge, and dismantle my
comfort of reflexivity. Self-reflexivity of discomfort became
a tool to investigate the autobiographical self, other, truth,
and reality beyond fixed, monolithic, and predetermined
representations.
I use and question three data sources for this study: (a)
memory writing, (b) artifacts, and (c) my self-reflexive
research journals. Data collection and data analysis are not
mutually exclusive but intricately connected during my
research (Marshall & Rossman, 2006; Riessman, 2008).
Narrative analysis (Riessman, 2008) comprises a major mode
of data analysis. Challenging yet also partly applying
Riessman's (2008) methods, I categorize narrative analysis
using two different genres: written texts and visual texts. I par-
tially use this data analysis method because it expands the
boundaries of narrative data (otherwise limited to written
texts) to include visual documents. Riessman's analytic tools
allow me to analyze multiple data from memory writing,
visual and written artifacts, and self-reflexive journal entries. I
also connect data culled from my self-reflexive autobiographi-
cal inquiry with narrative data from ethnographic research tra-
ditions, because both share similarities in terms of written and
visual narrative format of the data. I still challenge Riessman's
narrative analysis because of its constructivist approach to
data, which seeks to find, construct, and reorganize meanings
that exist within or could be retrieved from the narrative data.
Persuaded by Smith and Watson's (2000) theorization of
memory, experience, identity, embodiment, and agency­­all
of which are the constitutive processes of autobiographical
subjectivity­­I partially implement Riessman's analytic tool
to interrogate discursively, culturally, and sociopolitically con-
structed meanings in my data.
The Panopticon and Discipline
In this section, I examine the efficient nature of disciplinary
power that is operating via panoptic technology. Panopticism
is an architectural network of a modern prison to make
visibility as invisible to maximize controlling people
(Foucault, 1977). I use this multifaceted, in flux, and porous
network of panopticism to investigate principles that disci-
plinary power operates in the institutions of monastery,
barracks, and schools that have directly influenced my
identity constructions.
I investigate my firsthand "experiences" at schools, the
seminary, and the military, exploring how relationships
among people are constructed in Korea. When I mention
experience in this article, I mainly rely on Scott's (1992)
theory of experience. Scott theorizes the "discursive nature
of experience" (p. 37) as well as the political aspects of its
construction. Influenced by Scott, I define experience as
interpretation that is contested and political within specific
historical, cultural, and social contexts, rather than simply
"waiting to be expressed" (p. 33) or self-evident.
I was inspired to develop this article by a famous sen-
tence in Discipline and Punish: The Birth of Prison: "Is it
surprising that prisons resemble factories, schools, barracks,
hospitals, which all resemble prisons?" (Foucault, 1977,
p. 228). As a person who experienced at least three of these
institutions in Korea, including schools, the military, and the
seminary, I wanted to use the panopticism as an analytic tool
to illustrate the efficient nature of disciplinary power. Most
notably, "How do Confucian ideals of harmonious society
actually operate within disciplinary powers?" In the analy-
sis and interpretation of my experiences in Korea, I begin
my narratives with some drawings of the insides of several
institutions. Then, I explain Foucault's definitions of the
panopticon and of discipline. This leads to further interroga-
tion of my narratives in these institutions. Framed by the
notion of the panopticon, I examine the instruments of insti-
tutional discipline.
The Panopticon: Networks of Power
and Operations
Foucault (1977) develops the panoptic technology based on
Bentham's architectural model of a modern prison. The con-
cept of the design is for all (pan-) to be seen (-opticon, to
see). All prisoners can be seen without being able to tell
whether they are being watched. In this section, I juxtapose
general structures and functions of the panopticon with the
aforementioned institutions in Korea. I acknowledge that
Foucault's panoptic technology is not a fixed structure but
an architectural network grounded in mobility. Disciplinary
power, which is discursive, operates in a flexible collection
of social networks. This article begins from the elaboration
of panoptic structures of schools, seminary, and the military
in that structural understanding of the panopticon is a foun-
dation of panoptic technology.
General architectural network. According to Foucault
(1977), the panopticon is the architectural network where
visibility becomes "invisible," that is, a supervisor can see
the inmates, but the inmates cannot see the supervisor. At the
Moon 5
periphery is a ring-shaped building. A tower stands at the
center pierced with wide windows that open onto the inner
side of the circle. The peripheral building is divided into
cells. Each of cells has two windows: one inside, correspond-
ing to the windows of the tower, and one outside, which
allows the light to cross the cell from one end to the other.
In the panopticon, a supervisor in a central tower observes
an inmate, a patient, a condemned man, a worker, or a stu-
dent in each cell, thanks to the backlighting effect. These
people do not know when they are being observed by the
supervisor. They are alone, perfectly individualized, and
constantly visible. In short, (in)visibility is a "trap" of disci-
pline and surveillance. In disciplinary regimes in the panop-
ticon, external observers are not needed. Ultimately, knowing
that they are "watched," the inmates watch, judge, and shame
themselves (Piro, 2008). According to Foucault (1977), this
panopticon is a discipline mechanism that advances the exer-
cise of power by making the space more effective in terms
of controlling inmates, workers, students, seminarians,
soldiers, and patients in the institutions.
Panopticons in Korea. While reading Foucault's (1977)
Discipline and Punish: The Birth of Prison, I interpreted my
memories and my experiences as a student/teacher, seminar-
ian, and soldier. My illustrations in Figure 1 have depicted
the insides of those buildings, drawn from my memories.
Drawing these buildings on a copy of the "Plan of the
Panopticon," I realized it was not easy to tell which drawing
matched which institution. The drawings in Figure 1 have
similarities in architectural design: a hallway in the middle, a
wide-open space, and imperative visibility. In the middle of
Figure 1. Inside of the Korean panopticons

Figure 1 is the inside of Nae-mu-bahn (a military barrack)
where more than 50 privates slept together with no separate
living space. Every activity happened here except our regular
duties during working hours (8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.), when
we were in different offices. In Nae-mu-bahn, we slept,
watched TV, cleaned rifles, ironed our uniforms, and some-
times read books together. There was no privacy; everyone
could see what his or her comrades were doing almost at
all times.
The school building where I studied and taught has been
represented in the bottom part of Figure 1. I have shown how
five to six classrooms were connected on the right side of the
hallway. The upper parts of the wall were windows. Anyone
from outside the classroom could see inside, but students in
the classroom could not see whether someone was watching
them or not. I recollect that the principal walked the hallways
quite often. We did not know whether he passed by, but we
knew that he could always see what we were doing in class.
At the top of Figure 1, there are several rooms in my sem-
inary. The space was organized to facilitate community life.
From freshman year to junior year, I had approximately 12
roommates; we slept communally, shared bathrooms, and
studied together. I had one roommate during senior year. If I
had wanted a single room, I would have had to wait until I
was ordained as a deacon. There were very few moments
when I could be physically by myself; someone was always
with me. Priests lived at the room at the end of the hall. The
priest in my hallway did not officially supervise seminarians,
but we encountered each other often and casually chatted
about what was happening in our spiritual, personal, and aca-
demic lives.
Narratives: Living in the Panopticon
I have drawn the inside of three institutions using one point
perspective sketch--a drawing technique in which multiple
lines converge on one vanishing point (Figure 1). Drawn
from the structure, I chronologically narrate some of my
experiences inside the school, the seminary, and the military
panopticon. Brief explanation of Korean context helps
understand my narratives below. My school district was a
choice and merit-based system for high school. Every stu-
dent in my school district can choose any school he or she
wants to attend. A major risk of this "choice" is that an
applicant should prove his or her academic capacity with test
scores. I was lucky enough to enter the best high school in
my district. After high school, I decided to pursue Catholic
priesthood and went to a diocesan seminary in my province.
I studied theology and philosophy for 4 years. As part of
admission process, I went through in-depth psychological
and physical health tests, let alone passing College Scholastic
Aptitude Test (CSAT). Unlike these choices to enter high
school and a seminary, South Korea has a compulsory mili-
tary service system for healthy males. I was expected to
serve 26 months to fulfill this obligation as a healthy Korean
male citizen. The following describes my experiences in
these institutions.
The schooling panopticon. Today I am so nervous again,
even though this "ritual" happens at least once or twice a
month. My homeroom teacher, Mr. Hwang, brings all stu-
dents' report cards from last month's mock CSAT. As a 12th
grader, I should be accustomed to receiving test results, to
say nothing of taking tests--I have taken countless tests
since elementary school. Finally, Mr. Hwang walks into
class with a handful of documents. He calls our names, and
we each take our report card like a pseudo-death sentence.
Why a pseudo-death sentence? This document indicates
where the future of my life will be. This report card deter-
mines which college I can apply to with my current test
score. It also tells my rank among approximately 600,000
test takers in Korea. As the final ritual, Mr. Hwang posts a
paper on the bulletin board. I know what it is a list of the top
20 students in school. Usually, a test prep company provides
a big chart so that each student can pinpoint where his or her
score is located. For example, some CSAT preparation insti-
tutions make a chart indicating which college each student
can apply to after taking CSAT. In this chart, the far left
column is divided into subgroups based on the test scores.
Each major in every college is listed within this big chart.
The higher scores I have, the more choices I acquire in
choosing both universities and majors. Not only school-
teachers but also parents refer to this chart to measure which
college and major would be the "best" choice, considering a
student's current test score. This is the way in which friends,
teachers, parents, and I read this chart. Usually, the left two
columns in the chart indicate the minimum test scores
that are supposedly required to apply to a certain major in a
university. The first row contains the names of all 4-year col-
leges and universities in Korea. From the second row, a test
taker should find a major that matches his or her test scores.
As such, I situate myself within this ready-made, scien-
tific, measurable guideline. My total test score positions my
ideal college, even my major. There is only one right answer
in my multiple-choice tests, and hence only one right option
for college, based on my CSAT scores. Listing students'
scores is not limited to the classroom bulletin board. I know
that teachers can see all 12th graders' monthly or semi-
monthly mock CSAT scores in the teachers' lounge. The
identities and names of all 820 seniors in my school are
listed as a chart. Total test scores are divided by each subject
matter, and every teacher can compare students' scores by
subject matter as well as by the total scores (i.e., 320 points).
Furthermore, a student's ranking in the school as well as
his or her percentiles among all the test takers in the nation
indicate where each student is located within the normalized
scales. Every test is documented in this manner, and teach-
ers can observe each student's progress or regress. I do
not know which teachers care about my test scores, but it is
possible that somebody is watching me all the time, without
my noticing.
Moon 7
At the end of the day, Mr. Lee, the vice principal, is not
happy with our school's test scores. He announces that our
school ranks second among all the high schools in the nation.
He really seemed to want us to be the top and the best high
school in Korea. He encourages us to study harder and to
help each other more. He reminds me of Ms. Kang, one of
my homeroom teachers from middle school, who pushed our
class to study harder while collaborating with peers to
become the top class out of 10 in monthly tests.
However, I do not know how to negotiate between helping
my friends and raising my test scores. My friends' higher test
scores mean that mine will get a lower Nae-shin score­­which
is a normalized grade point average (GPA) used to assess aca-
demic achievements. Nae-shin score is a college entrance
examination category recalculated by percentage. If I am
located within the top 3%, I get a perfect score. If I am located
within the top 5% or 10%, two points or four points are
deducted, respectively. Because of this system, I should beat
my friends. All the students in school are anxious because a
lower GPA fails to guarantee entrance to a desirable college.
All my classmates become potential enemies as well as
friends. Conflicted, I do not know how much to collaborate
with my friends for better test scores.
I do not like this day--not only because of the test scores
but also because of physical fights among classmates. The
ones with short fuses cannot keep their tempers down on this
pseudo-death sentence day. I know they pick fights for minor
offenses such as accidentally bumping into one another. I am
glad that another long day is finally over. Spending 7:00 a.m.
to 11:00 p.m. in the same building is not easy, but I must
continue studying to get high test scores.
The seminary panopticon. "Benedicamus Domino!" "Deo
Gratias!" This is the first phrase I am to shout at 6:00 a.m.
every day. It is the moment when I am supposed to answer
the invitation to "Let us Bless the Lord" with a response,
"Grace to you, God." I should hurry, since I must be at the
chapel no later than 6:25 a.m. After my morning routines, I
run to the chapel. There is no official roll call to check
whether or not I attend the morning prayers. However, the
liturgy director, sitting at the back of the chapel, knows if I
am missing or late for the prayer. We are assigned our seats,
and it is too easy to spot who is missing.
6:30 a.m.: With a little bell sound, we begin pray-
ing the Officium Divinum, Liturgia Horarum (the
Liturgy of the Hours)­­which is the official set of
daily prayers. It takes almost 20 min to recite the
prayers together.
6:50 a.m.: This is a time for self-meditation. We do
the same routine in the evening, but morning hours
are a little tough. I have to concentrate not to fall
asleep. I remember what my spiritual director
advised before: Think about Peter and other disci-
ples when Jesus was praying at Gethsemane right
before he was arrested and crucified. Jesus asked
Peter and other disciples not to fall asleep but to be
awake and pray with him. However, they fell asleep
although Jesus asked the same thing twice. My
priest's voice is reminding me of the importance of
being awake all the time. I should be awake to con-
tinue meditating and praying. My self-discipline
is more important than being controlled by other
people's reminders. However, I cannot ignore the
fact that a liturgy director and other seminarians
might be watching me. I also know the director
regularly checks to see whether seminarians are
concentrating on meditation or falling asleep. As
the panopticon structure of this chapel is an open
space, everyone can watch what other people are
doing.
7:10 a.m.: Another bell tolls. It is a sign that personal
meditation is over, and we need to be ready for
daily mass.
7:45 a.m.: "Ite Missa Est." "Deo Gratias!" Another
phrase to say, "Thanks be to God," at the end of
mass. Before eating breakfast, we need to jog for
10 minutes. I do not enjoy this exercise much, but a
senior priest has set the rule for seminarians'health.
8:00 a.m.: Breakfast.
8:30 a.m.: Cleaning of rooms and other facilities.
9:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.: First session of class.
10:50 a.m. to 12:20 p.m.: Second session of class.
12:30 p.m.: Lunch. The tables in the dining hall are
visible from both inside and outside. As my table
is assigned, everyone can see whether or not I am
missing.
After optional lunch prayers, mediation, and a break, the
afternoon schedule begins.
2:30 p.m. to 4:20 p.m.: Third session for another class,
then almost an hour to be by myself without super-
vision. I am not allowed to spend this hour in the
sleeping room. I usually go to the chapel, library,
classrooms, or walk around the campus.
5:00 p.m.: Regathering for dinner prayer.
5:25 p.m.: Heading toward dinner.
7:10 p.m.: The rosary, either by group or personally
(group rosary is strongly recommended).
7:30 p.m.: Night prayer at the chapel.
7:50 p.m.: Night meditation. Prayers and meditation
are much easier at night than in the morning.
8:20 p.m.: End of meditation and going to our group
study room. The Great Silence begins now and lasts
until breakfast. The Great Silence is the moment
to keep absolute silence with other seminarians
to continue conversation with God. Chatting with
other seminarians hinders this sacred moment.
10:30 p.m.: End of evening study.
11:00 p.m.: "Deo Gratias!"Another prayer before bed,
falling asleep. Another long day within the Great
Silence.

The military panopticon. It is an extremely hot day in the
middle of May 1996. We are in the training field. The head
trainer is a lieutenant claiming that our cohort is not "cohe-
sive" enough.Arm in arm forming a human chain, we do more
than 100 sit-ups, all the while shouting "One--Comrades,
Two--I love you." We are all tired of these sit-ups, but I have
to remind myself to keep my posture like a brave solider.
Otherwise, the level of training gets harder. As a member of
the Republic of KoreanArmy, I should not forget that I am one
of 1,000 comrades being trained together in the field.
Today is the 1st day to practice using an M-16 rifle. As a
private, I am expected to meet the standard by firing at least
3 bullets out of 10 into the center of the target. This is a
practice to establish mechanical zero on the rifle, which
synchronizes the M-16 with the user's body and posture.
Before receiving the real bullets, we practice the best
posture for shooting, so far for more than 2 hr. Actually,
it takes less than 2 min to shoot all the bullets. If I can meet
the standard on my first try, I will not be under pressure to
practice the right posture over and over. Otherwise, I will
have to repeat these tedious and difficult processes until I
get it right. Fortunately, I meet the standard after the second
try. During the process, my comrades shout I love you but do
not mean anything. I hope this day will be over soon.
By the end of May 2006, a total of 6 weeks of basic mili-
tary training have passed. Now we are ready to move to
another military camp, where we will work for more than 2
years. At night, the half-moon smiles at me because I safely
finished the entire basic military training, including chemi-
cal, biological, and radiological defense, 25-mile walks with
90-pound bags, and mock-guerilla wars. We are waiting for
trains to transport us to our final destination. I depart from
the colleagues with whom I shared struggles, tears, and
laughs for 6 weeks.
Finally, a train arrives and we enter the cabin. I am so
thirsty. Drinking water is always an issue in this military. It
is 2 a.m. Soldiers are usually shipped after midnight so they
do not meet citizens. In the middle of night, I become
thirstier. I do not know who might have something to drink.
Fortunately, the guard is selling Hershey Chocolate drinks.
I have cash with me, what I have earned over 6 weeks of
obligations, about US$20--nothing compared with what I
did for the last 6 weeks. The Korean draft system mini-
mizes payment because military service is our obligation as
healthy Korean male citizens.
I am assigned to the end of the train. I really need a drink.
Soon I am frustrated to see people ahead of me buying more
than three or four drinks each. Yes, this is the reality. I do not
have a chance to drink anything, although I have pocket
money. What is the meaning of shouting I love you so much
if we do not share basic food and drink? I feel the deep real-
ity of how selfish each individual becomes in the midst of
hardship.
On the train, I do not yet realize the coming disaster
brought on by my entry date into service. I am called to
service on April Fools' Day in 1996, although in my unit
there are more than 20 privates who entered at the end of
March in 1996. I have to respect them as "senior" colleagues
simply because they entered the military one day ahead of
me. I use formal language to address them, although most of
them are 2 or 3 years younger. In the hierarchical order sys-
tem, they are just above my rank: I am a "junior" colleague
to them. The system suffocates me. I need to seek places
where I can breathe.
The Instruments of Discipline
Looking back on my interpretations of experiences, I wonder
what discipline or set of discursively constructed social
norms functions in each. I am interested in what major ele-
ments exist to manage and control my behavior. What social
norms were internalized in my schooling, in the seminary,
and in the military? To answer these questions, I attempt to
theorize my narratives using Foucault's notion of disciplinary
power in the panopticon. In Discipline and Punish: The Birth
of the Prison, Foucault (1977) identifies specific instruments
of discipline used to maximize productivity by controlling
individuals via separation: examination, timetable, hierarchi-
cal observations, and normalizing judgment.
Examination. Foucault (1977) posits that examination is "a
normalizing gaze, a surveillance that makes it possible to
qualify, to classify, and to punish" (p. 184). In the school nar-
rative, I addressed how teachers use examination as a means
of controlling students without being visible themselves. The
participants (students) become visible by taking monthly or
biweekly tests, followed by documentation about each. As
Foucault mentions, examination is the technique by which
power holds students in the mechanism of objectification.
Teachers and administrators neither have to show the signs of
its potency nor need to impose their attention on students. In
other words, teachers and administrators do not need to dem-
onstrate their constant existence to students to control stu-
dents' behaviors. The supervisors' invisibility through
examination itself makes students docile, submissive, and
controllable.As such, students (the participants) are presented
as "objects" to the observation of power, manifested by the
invisible gaze via examination.
In addition, the examination introduces individuality into
documentation, while collecting all students' information in
whole piles of documents captures, fixes, and controls their
behaviors. Listing the top 20 students on the bulletin board or
posting students' test scores in the teachers' lounge demon-
strates the power of documentation. Through it, each student
is measured and compared. We judge ourselves and each
other based on scores and ranks. At the same time, every stu-
dent is normalized and classified in deciding which college to
enter based on examination. The "College and Major
Assignment Chart" classifies students based on a normalized
scale of CSAT scores. As such, the big focus in the school pan-
opticon lies in "the individualized" control via examination.
Moon 9
Overall, through examination and documentation, stu-
dents become objects to be classified, judged, and super-
vised. Teachers do not necessarily need to show their
presence, because students are self-disciplined to increase
their productivity--in this case, to enter college.
The timetable. Foucault (1977) traces the origin of time-
tables to monastic communities. In the seminary, regular
schedules set up rhythms, assigned particular obligations
(e.g., prayer, study, and sleep), and regulated cycles of rep-
etition. Based on the division of time, particular occupations
and observations were controlled in detail by orders I had to
obey promptly. In the seminary, I was to get up at 6:00 every
morning and go to bed at 11:00 p.m. Thanks to the timeta-
ble, every moment of time is effectively organized; wasting
it is forbidden. Assigning the Officium Divinum, Liturgia
Horarum regulates when and how to pray in a day: morning
prayers at 6:30 a.m., afternoon prayers at noon, evening
prayers at 5:00 p.m., rosary at 7:10 p.m., and night prayers
at 7:30 p.m.
The rhythm imposed by the timetable is internalized and
programmed within my body. The timetable becomes a norm
that accelerates the process of prayer, meditation, and lit-
urgy. Internalizing the timetable enables each seminarian to
become "not only analytical and `cellular,' but also natural
and `organic'" (Foucault, 1977, p. 156). In other words, I
embrace the timetable into my body and thus become careful
to acknowledge my specific daily routines. The timetable is
embodied not only as psychic but also as muscle knowledge,
that is, every routine is memorized with/in my body. This
"docile" body perceives and internalizes discipline, a set of
social norms, and the experiences of daily lives with Jesus as
a "good" Roman Catholic seminarian. In this process, the
embodied materiality of memories, both psychologically and
physically, functions as a natural and organic process in my
spiritual practices in the seminary.
Hierarchical observations. Observation or gaze is the
major mechanism of the panopticon. The military camp
structure demonstrates a power that acts by means of gen-
eral visibility. The structure of this camp, specifically
inside, illustrates how a machinery of control is expressed
and used as a specific observation of each private's con-
duct. For example, Nae-mu-ban (a military barrack) is a
place in the camp where more than 50 soldiers live together.
Location of a cabinet and a bed is based on rank, decided by
which month you entered the military.
As I explained, since I entered the military on April 1,
1996, I am one rank lower than colleagues who entered in
March 1996 and two ranks below those who entered in
February 1996. I must use formal language and show con-
stant respect to senior colleagues, regardless of age: In Korean
military, rank beats age.
This month-based ranking system increases its productive
function and reinforces surveillance. Technically, as I was
required to serve in the military for 26 months, there would
be at least 25 ranks above me. Each private supervises other
comrades a month below. Surveillance becomes an effective
and economical operator to reduce accidents (e.g., suicide
or decampment) and increase the productivity of effective
soldiers who work systematically during a war. The power
functions as a piece of machinery in this hierarchical
surveillance of each private (Foucault, 1977). It enables
the operation of relational power among soldiers, while
sustaining the institution by its own mechanisms of surveil-
lance and control.
Normalizing judgment. The purpose of surveillance is to
ensure that individuals at each level of the panopticon are
functioning well enough to meet the standard set up by each
institution. Each individual is measured for all the values and
expectations promoted by the institution. Foucault (1977)
calls the very idea of this condition a "norm." Normalizing
judgment is used to assess behavior, value, and thought,
grounded in a "natural" or shared value in the institution. For
example, judgment about behavior and performance hap-
pens on the basis of the two opposite values: good/evil,
appropriate/inappropriate, and true/false. By assessing acts
with a binary of normal and abnormal and of right and
wrong, discipline judges an individual by whether or not he
or she is "in truth."
The major goal of discipline in the panopticon is to increase
the utility of each individual with respect to efficiency of time
and cost. Each participant is invested in accepting and inter-
nalizing the system's expectations and values. In my military
narrative, shooting at least 3 bullets out of 10 at the right target
is a norm, which is a standard for a "true" soldier. Unless a
soldier meets this standard, he becomes a "false" soldier and
has to practice until he reaches it.
Similarly, in my school narrative, acquiring high test
scores to enter (prestigious) colleges becomes a norm to be
considered a good student for teachers. Only if a student
enters the top 30% among the total population of seniors
in the nations can he or she be regarded as a "successful"
student in high school. Students who fall below the top 30%
are considered "failed" students who are not "smart" enough
to continue to 4-year colleges in Korea in the early 1990s.
Distribution by rank or grade punishes or rewards: The
institution sets up the norm of who will be considered a true
soldier depending on rifle skills in the military panopticon;
when a soldier meets the norm, he is not punished by being
ordered to practice all day long. At the end of the day,
all soldiers are reborn as true soldiers who can use a rifle
effectively. Similarly, in the school panopticon, high school
senior students study the standardized tests all day to be
included in the top 30%--which guarantees entrance to
4-year colleges. All soldiers and all students become alike:
competent soldiers and competent students who have met
the standards.
The instruments of discipline circulate to maximize the
productivity of institutions. At schools, teachers hope to gen-
erate students who will get high Korean CSAT scores and
enter colleges. Documenting grades and making them public
10 SAGE Open
generate another form of government that controls students
without external physical force. At the seminary, priests can
generate seminarians and future priests who are punctual,
disciplined, and well educated based on the embodied mate-
riality of a tight schedule and routines. Seminarians perceive,
internalize, memorize, and embody this discipline as future
church leaders. At military training camp, training soldiers to
meet the minimal requirements (e.g., using a rifle, knife, and
hand grenade) becomes a disciplinary power to control pri-
vates in the institution.
Discussion and Implication
People know what they do; they frequently know why
they do what they do; but what they don't know is
what what they do does.
(Foucault, personal communication, as cited in
Dreyfus & Rabinow, 1983, p. 187)
Drawing from Foucault's panopticism and panoptic tech-
nology, I have explored possibilities to use a different
approach to examine identity construction. I have illustrated
the complicatedness of cultural identity of Korean-ness,
which is discursively and politically constructed and
embodied by the panoptic technologies. The dominant dis-
course in identity research in multiculturalism focuses on
the discovery of "who they are" and "what they do"
grounded in their predetermined identity (e.g., people of
color, women, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender,
or disability). My self-reflexive autobiographical inquiry
does not support this humanistic approach, which general-
izes the Korean identity by discovering "who I am" and
"what I do." By creating counter-narratives, which cannot
be applied to other Koreans, I intended to create multiple
and complicated conversations in the field of multicultural
curriculum studies. Most notably, I have illustrated the
ways in which disciplinary power circulates in specific
institutions in Korea. When people are not much interested
in the examination of "what what they do does" (Foucault,
personal communication, as cited in Dreyfus & Rabinow,
1983, p. 187), this article has explored the disciplinary
power/knowledge, that is, the undividable configuration of
ways of thinking and actual practices that constitute dis-
courses (Foucault, 1980). This interrogation of nexus of
power/knowledge is a means to explore the subjectivity, or my
Korean-ness, which is always in the making (Miller, 2005) in
a specific sociocultural, political, and economic context.
For example, I described tensions in modern Korean
society where each institution emphasizes productivity
through surveillance and discipline of each individual.
The ideal image of Confucianism--as it includes appro-
priate interpersonal interaction and social harmony with
collaboration--generates and becomes the ideal goal that
Korean society unanimously agrees on as a set of social
norms. However, these remain imaginary goals because
the panoptic technologies-- including separation, invisibility,
and domination--are important strategies to produce maxi-
mum productivity. In modern power structures in Korea,
these individualization techniques cause tensions with
Confucian ideology of a harmonious community through
benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and sincerity.
WhileintroducingthefivebasicprinciplesofConfucianism,
Mr. Yi, for example, emphasized reciprocity among people as
the virtue of benevolence in interpersonal relationships.
Loyalty and righteousness became important for maintaining
good relationships, and being polite and humble were the key
principles that managed all human relationships. These prin-
ciples were embodied as a set of social norms for me as an
educated and civilized person. The lessons from my Korean
teachers, priests, and lieutenants guided me to value construct-
ing strong interpersonal connections among students, semi-
narians, and comrades.
In contrast, as evaluation relied on individual achievement,
my lieutenant's emphasis on collaboration was not meaningful
in meeting the standards for a rifle use. Although Mr. Lee
hoped that students would collaborate to become the best high
school in Korea, tensions remained between collaboration and
each student's competitive personal motivation to get the best
score. In the seminary, not many opportunities were available
to share time and ideas. Everyone was on a rigorous, individu-
alized daily schedule. Despite these institutions' emphasis on
collaboration and appropriate interaction, the panoptic tech-
nique circulates for the greatest extent possible for maximum
productivity. Korean subjectivity has been discursively and
materially constructed in the midst of these tensions, depend-
ing on these specific sociocultural, political, economic, and
political contexts.
By opening to possibilities beyond the use of predeter-
mined identity, I suggest educators dismantle comfortable and
stereotyped ways of understanding cultural difference/same-
ness. Teachers might initiate their understandings of cultural
sameness/difference from the analysis of power/knowledge.
Conventionally, teachers ask, "What cultural difference does a
student with diverse background bring into classroom?"
Drawing from Foucault's panopticism, teachers might shift
their questions: "How does panoptic technology operate
students' daily practices in schools, and thus, discursively
construct their identities?" The question with a "how" rejects
power as a thing or a commodity but attempts a critical inter-
rogation into the operation of power/knowledge (Foucault,
1983). As such, an emphasis on discursively constructed
"subject," with the analysis of power/knowledge, could pos-
sibly become a launch pad for teachers/students to inquire,
"What what [I] do does?" (Foucault, personal communication,
as cited in Dreyfus & Rabinow, 1983, p. 187). Furthermore,
this inquiry possibly explores diverse strategies that students
or teachers use to resist various forms of disciplinary power.
Moon 11
Although Foucault introduced the concepts to us several
decades ago, panopticism is timely today to examine the
ways in which power/knowledge is circulating in schools
and other institutions. Due to the scope of this article, I do
not address strategies that I used to resist various forms of
disciplinary power. An in-depth inquiry in the notion of
agency will be another important issue for the interroga-
tions of disciplinary power. Overall, an analysis of disci-
plinary power is crucial to examine discursive constructions
as well as material and embodied enactments of the subject.
This project is "not to discover what we are, but to refuse
what we are" (Foucault, 1983, p. 216) by examining power/
knowledge that controls students' ways of thinking, behav-
ing, and living. Such a "different" approach to identity, cul-
ture, and diversity, drawing from the analysis of power
regime, is an attempt to dismantle the autobiographical
subject's comfort--comfort that categorize identity within
fixed, predetermined, and seamless boxes (e.g., Asian,
Korean, male, middle class). Ultimately, conducing iden-
tity research differently--which is another political engage-
ment--aims to recognize all students who are not following
the normalized understandings of cultural sameness/
difference.
