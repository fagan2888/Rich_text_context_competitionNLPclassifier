Introduction
The life of the ingenious neurohistologist Santiago Ramón y
Cajal (1852-1934), Spain's restive spirit fittingly hailed as
"El gran sabio Español" or great Spanish savant (Caullery,
1934; Ferrari Billoch, 1957; Hasselberg, Pettersson, Mörner,
Wirsén, & Santesson, 1908), remains an inexhaustible repos-
itory of history bits. As a child, he painted and experimented
with explosives (Ramón y Cajal, 1988; Triarhou & del Cerro,
2008a). As an academic physician, besides studying nervous
tissue, he pioneered the invention of a cholera vaccine
(Ramón y Cajal, 1885a, 1885b), practiced hypnosis for labor
analgesia (Stefanidou, Solà, Kouvelas, del Cerro, & Triarhou,
2007), analyzed cross-sections of photographic film under
the microscope (Triarhou & del Cerro, 2008b), and conjec-
tured on the psychology of poets (Triarhou & Vivas, 2009).
The present article examines certain claims made by the
bottled water industry in commercial documents, implying
Cajal's involvement in the capacity of an analytical chemist.
Among other things, Cajal is mentioned as director by the
Cabreiroá mineral water company of Verín, Galicia, and as
having performed chemical analyses for the Carabaña min-
eral water company of Madrid.
Cajal had entered the Spanish medical corps after obtain-
ing the doctor's degree in 1873. Having a strong national
character and being in excellent physical shape, he served as
a lieutenant physician in the Third Carlist War, and subse-
quently as a captain in the Cuban War. His stay in Cuba was
marked by hardship and disease. The decline of Spain's colo-
nial policy, a war fought in a hostile climate, and corruption
among military officers led Cajal to be stationed in a theater
of operations with a rigid logistical system of "trails," which
would end up in military failure and a loss of the colony.
Disappointed and seriously ill from malaria, Cajal returned
to Spain on a sick leave. Shortly thereafter, thanks to Dr.
Genaro Casas, he became a university lecturer, ending his
military career (Moreno-Martínez & Martín-Araguz, 2002).
During his military service in Cuba, Cajal nearly died of
dysentery. Later, during his Valencia years and his tenure as
anatomy chairman there, he witnessed the 1885 cholera out-
break. Owing to his knowledge of microbiology (Ramón y
Cajal, 1905; Ramón y Cajal Junquera, 2000), he managed to
protect his family by boiling the water (Ramón y Cajal, 1988).
The Claims

One of the earliest links of Ramón y Cajal's name with min-
eral waters dates to 1895 in the balneario (spa) of Serón in

Ramón y Cajal as an Analytical Chemist
of Bottled Water? Use (and Misuse) of the
Great Savant's Repute by the Industry
Lazaros C. Triarhou1 and Manuel del Cerro2
Abstract
The name of the eminent neurohistologist Santiago Ramón y Cajal (1852-1934) was occasionally mentioned in commercial
labels by the Spanish industry advertising mineral waters from natural spring sources and their medical benefits. Concomitantly
with his landmark neuroanatomical research, Cajal had served as director of the Alfonso XIII National Institute of Hygiene.
In that capacity, his name had to be included in certificates as a mere bureaucratic formality. Cajal had an early interest in
bacteriology, and introduced a pioneering chemical vaccine against cholera during the 1885 epidemic in Spain. However, in
a letter to the Madrid press, he vehemently denied any involvement with actual chemical analyses or commercial promotion
of products such as bottled water, medicinal wines, disinfectants, and even toothpaste. In this episode, we realize that Cajal's
view was absolutely contrary to the impression one might have gathered on the basis of the commercial documents alone.

km from Zaragoza (Giménez Herrero, 1994; San Martín
Bacaicoa & Valero Castejón, 2004).
Cajal is mentioned as having frequented Jaraba and other
resorts in Aragón. In a dedication, dated August 16, 1895, he
appears as having written that, after spending a few days in
the spa establishment of Serón, he had the opportunity to
observe "significant relief and surprising revolutionary cures
in diseases such as lithiasis and its common complications of
the urinary tract, in gout, in chronic rheumatism, in diabetes
mellitus, and in uterine catarrhoea." The beneficial effects at
the popular summer resort and sanatorium were attributed to
the action exerted by the chemical constituents of mineral
water on nutrition and secretions (de Gregorio y Guajardo,
1895; Giménez Herrero, 1994; San Martín Bacaicoa &
Valero Castejón, 2004).
Cabreiroá de Verín
Verín (41°5627 N, 7°269W) is a town in Galicia (Province
of Orense), located 15 km north of the Portuguese city of
Chaves, at an altitude of 373 m. The denominated wine
region of Monterrey is located in the surrounding area. Three
mineral water bottling plants are based in Verín: Cabreiroá,
Fontenova, and Sousas.
The Cabreiroá mineral water company was established
and began commercial bottling at the source in 1906 (the
year that Cajal and Camillo Golgi were awarded the Nobel
Prize in Physiology or Medicine). Xosé García Barbón
(1831-1909), a Verín native and benefactor, officially started
the works after returning from a long and successful stay in
Cuba, where he had founded his own bank, as well as the
Galician Center of La Habana. Besides founding the Hotel
Spa of Cabreiroá, Barbón built in Vigo the theater that bears
his name (Teatro García Barbón, also housing the Centro
Cultural Caixanova) and the School of Arts and Crafts
(Escola Municipal de Artes e Oficios).
The health properties of the Cabreiroá spring water were
praised internationally. In 1907, Cajal's post as "director"
was printed on labels (Baeza Rodríguez-Caro et al., 2003;
Murillo, 1913). Cabreiroá mineral water was imported in
Argentina by the Echegaray brothers (Figure 1).
The Cabreiroá company has engaged in the bottling and
marketing of its mineral water for over a century. It was
advertised that Ramón y Cajal had certified the excellent sta-
tus of this water and its mineral-medicinal properties. The
resort in the vicinity of the spring was in operation through
the 1950s (Grupo 2T C.A., 2010).
Ramón y Cajal is reported to have been an ardent sup-
porter of the therapeutic properties of mineral waters (de la
Rosa & Mosso, 2004). In September 1909, Cajal spent a few
days in Cabreiroá and apparently told a Galician newspaper,
"Thanks to the virtues of the Cabreiroá spring I have regained
my health that was seriously compromised by the debilitat-
ing effects of a chronic intestinal catarrhoea and by the threat
of hepatic colic" (Rodríguez Miguez, 1995, p. 107). The
words of the man who embodied the national glory would be
used to promote the brand.
The company is still in operation (www.magmadeca
breiroa.es). The spring is located 100 m under the ground.An
octagonal temple stands at the fountain's head. The incan-
descent magma trapped beneath the Earth's crust releases gas
mixing at the spring with the water, which rises naturally at
16°C. It was clinically prescribed for gastroenteropathies,
according to the Calpe manual of medical sciences (Doz,
Manzaneque, Llord y Gamboa, Rodríguez Pinilla, &
Camaleño, 1922) published under Cajal's editorial direction
(Figure 2).
In the celebrations that marked the centennial of Aguas de
Cabreiroá, S.A., homage was paid to Ramón y Cajal and his
"analyses" from the early 1900s. A bronze statue, sculpted by
the Galician artist Manuel García Vázquez de Buciños, was
erected to honor the Nobel Laureate (Editorial, 2006; Gabinete
de Comunicación da Xunta de Galicia, 2006). The base bears
an identification. On it, Cajal appears as a gentleman ("cabal-
lero") with his frock-coat ("levitón"), walking and holding in
his right hand a bottle, whose contents he apparently intends
to analyze. The mastery of the sculptor details a face that
denotes intelligence and passion, deep intense eyes, and a
chin carefully covered by the trimmed thin beard and mous-
tache beneath the protruding nose (Pablos, 2009).
An Argentinian magazine advertisement [ca. 1908] (Fig-
ure 1, left) had claimed,
The greatest bacteriologist of the world, Doctor S. Ramón y
Cajal, who won the Nobel Prize by competing with the most
eminent scholars of all nations, has affirmed with the unequivocal
authority of his signature that the Cabreiroá natural mineral
water is bacteriologically pure and of excellent hygienic
conditions. The best table water for habitual consumption. Pure,
crystalline, fresh, light, of great taste, very absorbable, lightly
effervescent. Grand prizes obtained abroad by scientifically
proven merits: Paris, May 1908; Genoa, July 1908; Brussels,
October 1908. Cabreiroá water is absolutely natural, without
chemical manipulations nor artificial additives.
The salubrious action of Cabreiroá water is perfectly explained
by its absolute bacteriological purity and by its remarkable
chemical composition. The mineral salts it contains are dosed by
nature in a very harmonious and balanced form, such that each,
in producing the rightful action, enhances the effect of the
others. Thus, the extraordinary proportion of carbonic acid,
further makes it eminently digestive, favoring the absorption of
alkaline salts, which in turn operate on the blood, removing all
of its impurities; the bicarbonates operate on the stomach and
the digestive tract, while the lithium oxide exerts its action on
the liver and the kidneys.

The label (Figure 1, lower right) mentions, among other
things, "Minero-medicinal water of Verín . . . Pleasant and
digestive . . . Naturally carbonated . . . Hygienic analysis . . .
The Director, Santiago Ramón y Cajal. Owners and distribu-
tors: Jacinto and Francisco Fernandez Álvarez,Verín, Orense."
It was advertised as "indispensable for diseases of the stom-
ach, intestine, liver, kidney and diabetes. Ideal table water."
Another figure, mentioned to have praised Cabreiroá was
José Casares Gil (1866-1961), the president of the Royal
Academy of Pharmacy between January 1940 and June 1958
(Rodríguez Miguez, 2006).
Declared a public utility by Royal Order on December 15,
1906, Cabreiroá achieved reputation for its exceptional qual-
ities, top-ranking not only in Spain but also among famous
mineral waters abroad (Figure 3). Its annual exports exceeded
600,000 bottles in 1908; competing against similar national
and renowned foreign brands, such as Vichy and Royal of
France, and Ems and Fachingen of Germany, Cabreiroá was
awarded the Grand Prix with special distinction by the Jury
of the joint 1908 Spanish­French Exposition of Zaragoza
(Editorial, 1908).

Agua de Carabaña
In the late 19th century, the mineral water industry of
Carabaña La Favorita was born when the Chávarri family
acquired the property of the spring and surrounding land, and
built a spa that became very popular. The Carabaña mineral
water was rendered commercially available by Ruperto
Jacinto Chávarri on December 11, 1883. It was exported to
England, Portugal, Prussia, and Germany. In the early 20th
century, Carabaña bottled water was sold in many other
countries, including France, Italy, Cuba, and Panama.
Cajal was mentioned as having carried out chemical anal-
yses of Carabaña spring water (Figure 4), along with Gabriel
de la Puerta y Ródenas (1839-1908), professor of chemistry
at the School of Pharmacy of the University of Madrid. The
water was promoted for its curative and medicinal proper-
ties. On May 4, 1928, the product became officially qualified
as "Highly Recommended for Public Use" (Editorial, 1991,
p. 63).
The water contained sodium sulfate (Doz et al., 1922).
The town of Carabaña (40°1525 N, 3°144 W) at Cerro de
Cabeza Gorda is 50 km outside Madrid. For centuries, since
Roman times, water from the spring had been used for body
care with internal and external applications, also known to
local countrymen and shepherds. From the mid-1800s, the

water was distributed in carafes to nearby places and was
used to treat various ailments.
Carabaña's minero-medicinal water gained recognition
at Universal Expositions with 12 gold medals and 10 hon-
orary diplomas, including the 1889 Exhibition in Paris. At
the beginning of the 20th century, Carabaña water was
commercialized in Europe and America, where an esti-
mated figure of four million bottles were being sold in the
1930s.
The water was prescribed for gastrointestinal and hepatic
diseases, and externally for skin treatments (Editorial, 1913).
The commercial descriptions mentioned "purgative, laxa-
tive, antibilious, purifying, anti-herpetic," "medicinal jewel
for maintaining health and for curing diseases," and "trea-
sure of health." Beginning in 1904, the company manufac-
tured medicinal soap bars enriched in mineral salts collected
from the evaporation of natural spring water. The company
remains active today (www.aguadecarabana.com), produc-
ing and marketing natural health products.
The following information appears on the label of the
bottle shown in Figure 4 (cf. also Editorial, 1913, p. 4):
Chemical analysis carried out by his excellence Dr. Santiago
Ramón y Cajal, Nobel Prize in Medicine. The water of Carabaña
has the following composition: Baumé aerometer grades 14.3;
density 1.109; anhydrous salts per liter of water: Na sulfide
0.0493; Na sulfate 114.7357; Mg sulfate 2.1621; Ca sulfate
1.5416; Al sulfate 0.0115; Na phosphate 0.1975; Na chloride
1.6301; Ca chloride 0.1886; F and Mn small quantities. By its
marked quantity of Na sulfate that this water contains (114.7357
g/L) and the other mineral elements it can be considered as
typical of the group of Na sulfate mineral waters, the sulfur
variety.

documents from the authors' private collection).
Triarhou and del Cerro 7
Carabaña is one of the best known waters of Madrid,
operating since 1883 and being still sold commercially in
pharmacies. It comes from the Charca de la Salina ("Salty
Pond"); the source is known as La Favorita. Estimated daily
flow is 9,500 dm3 (Fraguas, 2007; Navarro García, 2010).
In the early 20th century, bottled water was exported by
the Carabaña Company to France, Italy, and Portugal, and to
the Spanish colonies, including Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the
Philippines. The sales, in 1907, were estimated to three mil-
lion 0.5-L bottles. Shortly after, business was expanded to
the production of Epsom salts and soap (el Sáb, 2009).
Agua de Carabaña ranks among the highest in the world
regarding the concentration of calcium (505 mg/L) and mag-
nesium (552 mg/L; Vasey, 2006).
La Toja
The "Isla de la Toja" (also "Illa da Toxa" or "Illa de Louxo")
is located in the Rías Bajas in the Province of Pontevedra in
Galicia, at distances of 30 km from Vilagarcía, 32 km from
Pontevedra, and 18 km from Cambados. Famous for its spa,
it is covered by green vegetation and surrounded by a sea of
crystal clear water. Its thermal mud and medicinal water
springs were discovered in the 19th century. Its soaps ("el
jabón La Toja") had been a favorite of the Buenos Aires
señoras.
The 50°C spring with its hypertonic sodium chloride
composition, in a granitic terrain of probable volcanic gene-
sis, was indicated for gynecologic conditions (Doz et al.,
1922). A liter of "agua de La Toja" in addition contained 20.2
ml anhydrous carbonate, 10.8 ml oxygen, 29.2 ml nitrogen,
0.40 g Mg sulfate, 0.98 g Ca sulfate, 0.18 g Mg carbonate,
0.87 g Ca carbonate, 0.10 g Fe sesquioxide, and 0.12 g silica
(Doz et al., 1922).
On the basis of the physicochemical properties of its spring,
Cajal is reported to have called the thermal station at La Toja
"a true temple of health" (Pérez, 1983, p. 32). He is mentioned
to have expressed his views of La Toja as follows:
Nature created here a salutary and almost unique spring seen as
incomparable. The peaceful island is bathed by the most beautiful
Galician estuaries, invigorating sea breezes scented by the balmy
emanations of the forest, temperature being always spring-like
under a clear and bright sky. Art and science, working in concert,
have realized the work of nature. By this time, La Toja has fallen
into the hands of skilled craftsmen, who have been striving to
provide the swimmer with the excellence of a hydrotherapy
facility wisely organized, a magnificent residence, a true temple
devoted to health, which combines into a happy marriage the
refinements of the most demanding comfort with the most
scrupulous precautions of hygiene. (Otero Pedrayo, 1954, p. 322)
The Counter-Claim
At first glance, one might surmise that the water analyses in
the commercial documents and labels bearing Cajal's name
reflected yet another aspect of his diverse scientific
avocations.
On one hand, it appears less complicated to explain why
Cajal might extol, on several occasions, the medicinal prop-
erties of spring waters of the Iberian peninsula. After all,
such claims were likely rooted in medical paradigms of his
age. The 1800s had seen a widespread enthusiasm for water
cures, Darwin being one of thousands of famous patients at
water spas. In that aspect of conventional medicine, Cajal
might not be doing much different than his contemporaries
or anything particularly rigorous by the standards of his work
in neuroanatomy.
Furthermore, it is understandable that Cajal, an amateur
astronomer and nature lover, felt for the unspoilt corners of
his land, such as the tiny town of Verín, one of the many
along slow roads from Santiago de Compostela to Salamanca.
These are places where the traveler can soak his spirit in the
essence of Spain. The night sky is velvet blue, the stars shine
as they do not shine in our light-polluted cities. And the
silence! It is a silence that "heals the mind."
On the other hand, there is a questionable quality as to
how water bottlers were using Cajal's reputation to promote
products. Sometimes, a "Great Man" style in industrial
advertising can be insufficiently critical, lacking the hard
evidence from properly controlled studies for the products
being truly efficacious.
The reply comes from a unique, and surprising letter,
from Ramón y Cajal himself, hosted in the Diario Ilustrado
ABC on April 22, 1926 (Figure 5), under an unmistakable
title: "How My Modest Name Is Exploited by Certain
Unscrupulous Industries" (Ramón y Cajal, 1926). Cajal reit-
erates that he never practiced any industrial analysis, neither
as an individual nor as director of the Alfonso XIII Institute,
and clarifies that, if his name appears in some documents, it
is only owing to a bureaucratic formality requiring to include
the formal approval (B. V. or "bueno visto") of the director
of the Institute.
The complete text of the letter reads as follows (authors'
English translation):
The most cultivated writer Gómez de Baquero said that the least
Spanish virtue is respect. My case eloquently corroborates that
sensible observation. I allude to a misuse initiated since I was
nominated, at the suggestion of the illustrious doctor Cortezo,
director of the Alfonso XIII National Institute of Hygiene. This
misuse, committed by quite a lot of industries, consists in
gratuitously attributing to me the execution of the analysis of
specifics, of medicinal wines, of mineral waters, disinfectants,
cigarette paper, toothpaste and other products, of which I have
no idea. Such a myth has spread so, that it has even invaded the
foreign press (including a current claim in a Swedish newspaper),
and has generated within Spain, in magazines of great prestige,
commentaries hardly pleasant to me. And yet the tide keeps
rising. Today I was informed that the Radio Company has
credited me with the analysis of the waters of Venta del Hoyo
(waters of which I have not the slightest idea), and that a witted
8 SAGE Open
merchant, in whose house I purchased a spray gun for
disinfectants (I paid, naturally), advises his clients to consult me
on its efficacy. Finally, as I write these lines, I am informed that
in the central theater there appears a sign, which gratuitously
attributes to me the analysis of the waters of Hoznayo.
It is urgent, then, to straighten things, by stating that:
First. I have never conducted any industrial analysis, neither as
an individual nor as director of the Alfonso XIII Institute, a
position that I resigned 6 years ago.
Second. That the experts' certificates handed over to individuals
by the said Institute were authorized by the signature of the
section chief, the true author of the analysis, with the approval of
the director, stamped at the bottom, as required by regulations.
Third. That the tariff of prices, extremely reasonable, were
approved by the Directorate of Health, in accordance with a
ruling, under which half the amount of the honorarium is
destined to bolster the infrastructure and the rest to subsidize the
personnel, which, during the initial years of the organization of
the Institute, was receiving inadequate stipends.
If the industrial references had pointed on their labels or in their
magazine advertisements the official establishment where the
expert work was carried out, the name of the authoring professor
directly responsible, plus the approval of the director (a
bureaucratic imperative, which only expresses the mere
sentiment of confidence in the competence and integrity of the
analyst), I would be content with all the claims; but the fact is
that almost all claims published by the advertisers systematically
and maliciously omit the name of the Institute, eliminating that
of the illustrious chemistry professor charged with the service,
and it is only stated analyzed, or consulted, by Dr. Cajal, etc.,
even though the report entails bland judgments or formulates
restrictions, reservations, and even failures outright unfavorable.
Some will think that all this is suspicions or cogitations of mine.
No. Insofar as, even in the minute, the whole truth should always
shine, for the deplorable tolerances I have suffered, as stated
earlier, molestation attacks by doctors and journalists. Even in
La Libertad, a master of journalists, whom I wholeheartedly
revere and admire, expressed 4 or 5 months ago, without naming,
and in a pious tone, caustic ironies.
Let the aforementioned industries, then, rectify their conduct
toward me. Erase my name from their claims and labels and
reproduce that of author of the analysis. I appeal to their rectitude
and nobility. Announce that, attributing to me a work for which I
am not competent brings me into a ridiculous, unjust, and
unlawful position. Ridiculous, because everyone knows how

oblivious I am in analytical chemistry; unjust, because I would
appear to supplant or silence the personality of the illustrious
professors, among others, that of Mr. Obtulio Fernández,
Professor and Chairman of Pharmacy, an academic and one of
the few eminent chemists honoring Spain; unlawful, because, not
paying the medical patent signals that I defraud the Treasury. I
trust, therefore, that the preceding reasons will make an
impression on the industries, which, for 14 or 16 years, exploit,
in exchange for a few pesetas given to the Alfonso XIII Institute,
my humble name. I simply aspire to completely forget me. But if,
as I suspect, they persist in their attitude, I shall be compelled to
consult an attorney and to take the matter to the Courts. These
will say whether, in citing a public document, it is permissible to
dispense with the signature of the one who authored it, and
whether a mere ritualistic approval is equivalent to the paternity
of the one who performed in person, and with full competence
and responsibility, the meritorious expert work.--S. Ramón Cajal
Discussion
This episode is an example of how the exhaustive documen-
tation on a historical topic can prevent us from conceivably
passing a message that would not correspond to reality, and
from spreading a false legend. By reading Cajal's letter, we
see that his view was absolutely contrary to the impression
that one might have gathered on the basis of the commercial
documents alone.
The story reminds of the Dutch botanist-physician
Herman Boerhaave (1668-1738) in 18th-century Leiden,
who was often disgruntled by fake publications with incor-
rect statements and had also sent a letter to the local newspa-
per warning about claims (mis)using his name (Koehler,
2007). His note appeared in De Leydsche Courant on October
9, 1726 (Schulte, 1959; cited by Koehler, 2007). In sharp
words, it went as follows:
Whereas some booksellers of this and other countries, for the
sake of lucre only, have highly injured me, and scandalously
cheated the public, by printing in my name several books from
lectures procured (as they pretended) from my auditors, who
were it so, make a very ill requital for my best endeavours to
serve them; I find myself obliged to declare that I owe none such
for my works, being fraudulently published without my
knowledge, contrary to my will. (Lindeboom, 1974, pp.
141-142)
Cajal's medical interests covered a wide spectrum from
neuroembryology (de Castro, López-Mascaraque, & de
Carlos, 2007; Hamburger, 1980; Lagercrantz, 2006; Puelles,
2009) and neurohistology (Andres-Barquin, 2001, 2002;
Berciano & Lafarga, 2001; DeFelipe, 2002; DeFelipe &
Jones, 1992; Gibson, 1994; Lafarga, Casafont, Bengoechea,
Tapia, & Berciano, 2009; Llinás, 2003; Loewy, 1971; López-
Muñoz, Boya, & Alamo, 2006; Sotelo, 2003) to cardiology
(de Fuentes Sagaz, 2001) and tumor biology (Martínez,
Marín, Junquera, Martínez-Murillo, & Freire, 2005). His
first interest in bacteriology and the pathology of
inflammation developed early and continued in parallel with
his neurohistological work (Iturbe, Pretó, & Lazcano, 2008;
Otis, 2001; Ramón y Cajal, 1885a, 1885b, 1905; Ramón y
Cajal Junquera, 2000; van Buskirk & Porter-Sánchez, 1961).
Cajal's fascination with microbes and the organism's ways of
fighting them is also reflected in his early fiction novels
(Otis, 2001).
Bottled waters were marketed for their mineral contents,
as well as (presumably) for the absence of pathogenic
bacteria.
Cholera, another of Cajal's subjects of interest, was a con-
cern in major European cities well into the beginnings of the
20th century. For example, the death of the beloved Ana
Cecilia Luisa Dailliez from water-transmitted fiebre tifoidea
in Madrid in 1912 led Mexican poet Amado Nervo (1870-
1919)--also known as Juan Crisóstomo Ruiz de Nervo--to
write some of the most sorrowful poetry in the Spanish lan-
guage. Nervo had spent the first years of the 20th century in
Europe, especially Paris, where, in 1901, he met the love of
his life and they lived happily for 11 years, until her untimely
death. Out of his grief and desperation, Nervo wrote his most
important work, La Amada Inmóvil ("The Immovable Loved
One"), published posthumously in 1922. One can easily
imagine don Amado and don Santiago crossing each other in
some street of Madrid!
The scientific interests of Ramón y Cajal (1885a, 1885b)
had converged with those of Eduardo García Solá (1884,
1885a, 1885b), the Spanish pathologist who became rector
of the University of Granada, through simultaneous publica-
tions on the virulent bacillus and its treatment during the
1885 cholera outbreak in Spain. The foundations of the
promising new science of bacteriology had been laid by the
brilliant contributions of Robert Koch (1843-1910) in Berlin,
who had recently discovered the Vibrio cholerae (Koch,
1884, 1886, 1893).
Cajal introduced for the first time the pioneering concept
of a chemical vaccine (Ramón y Cajal Junquera, 2000). For
that ground-breaking work on producing a vaccine against
cholera, Cajal was presented by the Provincial Government
of Zaragoza with a Carl Zeiss microscope. Compared with
the new Statif and profuse objectives, Cajal's earlier, hard-
earned Verick microscope now "seemed like a rickety door
bolt" (Andres-Barquin, 2001; Ramón y Cajal, 1988). The
Zeiss instrument opened up totally new horizons, enabling
Cajal "to attack the delicate problems of the structure of the
cells without misgivings and with the requisite efficiency"
and eventually to decipher the minute structure of the ner-
vous system. From that work, and that microscope, modern
neurobiology was born.
