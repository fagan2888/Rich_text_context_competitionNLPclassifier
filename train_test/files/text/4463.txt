Even though lifetime employment has become an exception
to the rule and relative job insecurity prevails (Smith, 1997),
work now occupies a huge place in our lives. People are
devoting more and more time and energy to their work and
putting a lot of themselves into it. Work is becoming an inte-
gral part of our identity, serving at least partly to define us
personally and professionally, position us in the social hier-
archy, and make us feel competent and useful--in short, giv-
ing us a positive identity (Ashforth & Mael, 1989; Gini,
1998). This is the positive side of work.
At the same time, maybe because of this high degree of
involvement and centrality, work now places many con-
straints and demands on employees. People have to become
more involved, put in more hours, work ever faster (even if it
is to the detriment of quality), have ever higher qualifica-
tions, contend with problematic colleagues, and so on and so
forth. This is the negative side of work, which, because orga-
nizations are so demanding, can be a source of stress.
The literature on organizational stress is extremely wide
ranging (Dewe, O'Driscoll, & Cooper, 2010; Schabracq,
Winnubst, & Cooper, 2003). Numerous studies have shown
that organizational stress has a great many negative conse-
quences on individuals' physical and psychological health
(Deery, Walsh, & Guest, 2011; Shirom, 2003), as well as on
economic and organizational issues. Nevertheless, this litera-
ture has mostly focused on the impact of stressors, such as
psychological and physical demands, workload, or bad inter-
personal relationships at work, on perceived stress. Although
some of these stressors are psychological in nature and affect
the way in which individuals appraise such situations (i.e., as
threats or challenges to well-being), relatively little attention
had been paid to their impact on identity. And yet, given the
centrality of work for identity (Gini, 1998; Schaufeli &
Greenglass, 2001; Wrzesniewski & Dutton, 2001), one
would expect certain difficult situations to be appraised not
only with regard to what they mean in terms of threats or
challenges to well-being (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984), but

The Impact of Work Stressors on
Identity Threats and Perceived Stress:
An Exploration of Sources of Difficulty at
Work Among French Psychologists
Sophie Berjot1, Emin Altintas2, François-Xavier Lesage1, and
Elisabeth Grebot3
Abstract
This aim of this study was to explore which kinds of working situations are regarded by psychologists as being particularly
detrimental to their identity (personal and professional), how these situations are appraised in terms of threat and/or
challenge, and what their impact is on perceived stress, work satisfaction, and perceived threat to occupational status. In
all, 842 French psychologists answered an open format question requesting them to report a situation that was particularly
difficult for them as a person and/or as a psychologist (analyzed by the way of a content analysis), and a questionnaire
containing our dependant variables. Four major categories of situations were highlighted. While the first three were positively
linked to threat, the "patient relations" category was negatively correlated with it. "Threat to personal identity" mediated the
relationship between difficult situations and perceived stress. Situations appraised as being identity-threatening are mostly
the same than those found in the stress literature and are stressful because of their impact on personal identity. Moreover,
for psychologists, relations to patients, which are at the heart of the profession, seem to be protective regarding stress and
identity threats.

also in terms of identity (see Wiesenfeld, Brockner, Petzall,
Wolf, & Bailey, 2001, for an example in the context of reac-
tions to layoffs), be it personal (i.e., the self as distinct from
other people; Hogg, 2003) or social/professional (i.e., the
part of identity that is associated with group membership).
Drawing on a recent model of stress and coping with identity
threats (Berjot & Gillet, 2011), we therefore sought to find
out (a) which situations have an impact on identity, (b) how
these situations are appraised in terms of threats and/or
challenges to personal and or professional identity, and
(c) whether the impact of these specific situations on per-
ceived stress is mediated by appraisals.
Work and Identity
Work functions are manifold (Jahoda, 1981, 1982), but given
that, as mentioned earlier, people are often very committed to
their work and/or organization, psychological functions such
as personal achievement or harmonious social relationships
would appear to be especially important nowadays (England
& Harpaz, 1990; Harpaz, 1990). As work seems to occupy an
increasingly central place in the minds of individuals, who
often define themselves in terms of their work, their profes-
sional abilities or their professional relationships (Gini,
1998), it can be regarded as an important source of identifi-
cation, helping to define personal and organizational identi-
ties (Alvesson, 2010).
Identification with work often helps people to cope with
job stress, by allowing them to perceive stressful situations
as less threatening (Haslam, Jetten, O'Brien, & Jacobs,
2004) and serving as an important source of social support
from coworkers or from the institution itself (Haslam,
O'Brien, Jetten, Vormedal, & Penna, 2005). The flip side of
this identification is that when work is threatened, as is the
case when particularly stressful situations are regularly
encountered or when the very existence of the job is in
question (i.e., redundancy or quite simply fear of redun-
dancy; see, for example, Heaney, Israel, & House, 1994;
Sverke, Hellgren, & Naswall, 2002; Wiesenfeld et al.,
2001), reactions may be particularly negative (Harnisch,
1999; Jahoda, 1982). These reactions may take the form of
stress, but they can also have a more general impact on
identity (Ashforth & Humphrey, 1993) and self-esteem
(Winefield, Winefield, Tiggemann, & Goldney, 1991), and
lead to hospitalization and self-harm (Eliason & Storrie,
2009), burnout (Dekker & Schaufeli, 1995), posttraumatic
stress disorders (Grebot & Berjot, 2010), and even suicide
(Argyle, 1989; Kleespies et al., 2011).
Without going as far as losing one's job, stressful situa-
tions or work difficulties that occur on a daily basis can,
because of their recurrence and because of what they mean
for identity (questioned, devalued, or scorned), equally rep-
resent a major source of stress. This is certainly the case of
extreme situations such as sexual harassment, which not
only causes stress but also depression, anxiety, and poor
self-esteem (see Fitzgerald, 1993, for a review). It is also the
case of daily situations that include or imply humiliation,
devaluation (Deery et al., 2011; Terkel, 1977), changes in
the organization or nature of work (Schabracq, 2003) or,
more generally, the fake expression of emotions (Ashforth
& Humphrey, 1993; Payne & Cooper, 2001). However,
while these situations have been shown to lead to dysfunc-
tional stress reactions because they are appraised as threats
to the individuals' well-being or because the constraints
exceed the latter's resources (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984), to
our knowledge, researchers have yet to look at whether
these situations have an impact on personal and/or profes-
sional identity, and how.
The Stress and Coping With Identity
Threat Model
While there are numerous models of stress and coping,
which most of the time offer ecologically valid explana-
tions as to how people react to different types of threats to
their well-being, such as major events, daily hassles, and,
more particularly, threatening situations at work (Dewe
et al., 2010; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984), few explain how
people appraise and react to self-threats, that is, threats to
their sense of self, as unique individuals (often referred to
as personal/individual/private self or personal identity)
and/or as members of meaningful groups (often referred to
as group/collective self or social identity; Baumeister,
1998; Greenwald, & Pratkanis, 1989).
Traditional models of stress do not make any distinction
between the tangible aspects of the situation that has to be
coped with (e.g., work overload, conflicts) and what that
situation means for an individual's personal and/or profes-
sional identity (e.g., seeing one's competence called into
question, being treated as unprofessional, etc.). The stress
and coping with identity threat model (Berjot & Gillet, 2011),
grounded in the literature on stress and coping with discrimi-
nation, is based on transactional models of stress, and is spe-
cific to identity-threatening situations. These situations have
specific antecedents, an appraisal phase, specific coping
strategies (e.g., self-handicapping, self-affirmation), and dif-
ferent kinds of effects, such as lowered self-esteem and
stress.
It is the primary appraisal phase that is of interest to us
here. This is when individuals assess whether, in a specific
problematic situation (a) something is potentially detrimental
to their identity (personal and social) and (b) which part of
that identity is threatened (or challenged) by the situation.
This appraisal phase is presented in the model as mediating
the way these threatened individuals then react (outcome). In
other words, appraising a situation as relevant to one's iden-
tity and threatening for one or both aspects of that identity is
a source of stress because of its impact on identity (Ashforth
& Humphrey, 1993; Major & O'Brien, 2005; Miller & Kaiser,
2001). For example, a study by Berjot, Girault-Lidvan,
Berjot et al. 3
Scharnitsky, and Gillet (2010) showed that students of for-
eign origin whose ethnic identity was threatened in a stereo-
type threat paradigm (threat of confirming a poor reputation
by failing on a task; for example, women taking a math test)
judged the situation to be more stressful than students of
French origin, who were not threatened by the stereotype. In
another study, Berjot, Girault-Lidvan, and Gillet (2012)
showed that stigmatization linked to being physically dis-
abled was negatively correlated with the threat to personal
and social identity. Moreover, these individuals made distinct
identity appraisals, depending on whether they faced discrim-
ination, and these appraisals were specifically linked to
outcomes such as personal and collective self-esteem, and
identity management strategies.
When applied in an organizational context, this model can
help researchers to explore the impact of identity appraisal
on adjustment. For example, Lesage, Berjot, Altintas, and
Paty (2013) measured, in a sample of 1,440 occupational
physicians, symptoms of burnout, perceived stress, and iden-
tity appraisals. Results showed that stress and burnout were
significantly and positively linked to threat to personal and
professional identity. Moreover, results showed that threat to
personal identity (TPI) explained twice as much feelings of
low personal accomplishment than perceived stress and as
much depersonalization than stress.
Finally, as it will be also our goal here and more in a quali-
tative way, help to find out (a) which kinds of difficult situa-
tions are relevant to identity and therefore whether these
situations are partly or entirely the same as those that are
usually identified as sources of stress in the organizational
literature, and (b) explore their relation with stress. In the
light of the above studies, we set out to ascertain (a) which
kinds of work difficulties are regarded as identity-threaten-
ing by employees, (b) how those problematic organizational
situations are appraised (i.e., in terms of personal vs. profes-
sional identity threats and/or challenges), and (c) what effects
these difficulties have on adjustment (in this case, perceived
stress, satisfaction with working conditions and the percep-
tion that one's professional status is threatened by society),
as mediated by the appraisal process. The first part of the
present study was therefore descriptive (the kinds of situa-
tion that have an impact on identity, how they are appraised,
and what their impact is on stress), while the second part was
processual. Concerning this second part, and again based on
the literature, we predicted that threat appraisals would medi-
ate the relationship between situation and stress.
Method
Participants and Procedure
The present study was run with a specific population, namely
French psychologists, as many studies have shown that psy-
chologists are particularly stressed and sensitive to syn-
dromes such as burnout ( Ackerley, Burnell, Hoder, &
Kurdek, 1988; Raquepaw & Miller, 1989; Vredenburgh,
Carlozzi, & Stein, 1999). Given their high qualifications and
the human responsibilities they have to bear, psychologists
are particularly committed to their profession.
Participants were 842 psychologists (M
age
= 34.63, SD
age
= 9.54), 81 men and 752 women (9 did not report their sex).
They were all actively employed in a number of different
settings: 392 worked in public hospitals (46.39%), 67 in pri-
vate hospitals (7.93%), 168 in nonprofit organizations
(19.88%), 37 in private companies (4.38%), 58 in psychol-
ogy practices (6.86%), 86 in public administration (10.18%),
28 had at least two different workplaces (3.31%), and 9
worked in universities or colleges (1.07%). As for their sta-
tus, 437 (51.72%) had long-term contracts, and 191 (22.60%)
fixed-term ones, 155 (18.34%) were civil servants, 38
(4.50%) were self-employed, and 18 (2.13%) had at least
two types of contract. On average, they had been working for
7.60 years, with a minimum of 1 month and a maximum of
51 years. Participants were approached via French national
associations of psychologists1 and the authors' own social
and professional networks to respond to an online question-
naire. The aim of the study, as well as its voluntary and anon-
ymous nature, was set out on the first page of the
questionnaire.
Measures
Appraisal of identity threat.First of all, participants were
asked to "think about a difficult professional situation (or set
of similar situations) that you have experienced and which
particularly affected you as a person or as a psychologist."
They were then asked to describe the situation or situations
(optional), before responding to the 20 items of the Primary
Appraisal of Identity Threat scale (PAIT; Berjot, Girault-
Lidvan, & Gillet, 2012). This tool is a trait-like scale that
assesses how people appraise situations in terms of threats
(or challenges) to their personal and/or social identity. Here,
the social identity items were rephrased to fit the psycholo-
gists' professional identity and participants were told to
respond to these items with reference to the situation(s) they
had just reported.
The PAIT has four subscales. The two Threat subscales
measure the degree to which the individual self (vs. the
social/professional self) is devalued, insulted, or undermined
in the reported situations (Tajfel & Turner, 1986). The Threat
to Personal Identity subscale (6 items,  = .84; for example,
"I have the feeling that I'm regarded as a nobody") refers to
the individual self, while the Threat to Social Identity sub-
scale (TSI; 5 items,  = .86; for example, "I have the feeling
that psychologists are insulted") refers to the social self, in
this case, a psychologist.
The two Challenge subscales measure the degree of con-
fidence that, with an effort, the situation's demands can be
overcome. These two subscales therefore focus on the posi-
tive outcomes that can come from difficult situations. The
4 SAGE Open
Challenge to Personal Identity subscale (CPI; 4 items;  =
.64; for example, "I focus on the way I can take advantage of
the situation") focuses on the individual self, while the
Challenge to Social Identity subscale (CSI; 5 items,  = .77;
for example, "I'm pleased to have a chance to show to what
extent psychologists, including myself, can deal with this
kind of situation") focuses on the professional self. As this
scale was originally developed in the context of identity
threats linked to discrimination, we used exploratory facto-
rial analysis with an oblimin rotation to check its structure.
This analysis yielded a four-factor solution (61.14% of vari-
ance). All the items loaded on their respective dimensions
except for two, which loaded on two dimensions. As these
both had quite a high loading on their initial dimensions, we
included them in the scores.
Perceived stress. Stress was assessed with the French version
of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS14; Cohen, Kamarck, &
Mermelstein, 1983; translated into French by Bruchon-Sch-
weitzer, 2002, and validated by Lesage & Berjot, 2012). The
PSS is a brief self-report scale of 14 items. People are asked
to rate on a Likert-type 5-point scale ranging from 1 (never)
to 5 (very often) the extent to which they experienced each of
the feelings and thoughts on the list in the course of the pre-
vious 2 weeks.
Work satisfaction. This was assessed with a single question:
"Are you satisfied with your working conditions?" Partici-
pants answered on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (not at
all) to 7 (totally).
Threat to occupational status.This was also assessed with a
single question: "Do you think that psychologists' profes-
sional status is threatened in France?" Participants answered
on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (totally).
Psychosocial and status characteristics. After responding to the
different scales, participants were asked several questions
about their sex and age, their experience (in years), the type
of place they worked in, and their type of work contract.
Results
Situational Content Analysis
A total of 568 participants reported at least one difficult situ-
ation before responding to the PAIT (67.22%). The content
of their reports was analyzed by two of the coauthors, who
counted 1,205 occurrences (an occurrence corresponded to
the citation of one specific source. Even if the same source
was cited more than once, it was still only coded once), that
is, 2.12 occurrences per respondent. The categorization was
undertaken jointly by the two coauthors, who shared the cod-
ing out between them after they had coded about 70 partici-
pants together and arrived at a consensus on the definition of
each category and the criteria for placing an occurrence in a
particular category. If a problematic occurrence was encoun-
tered, it was discussed until a consensus was reached.
Content analysis highlighted four types of work-related situ-
ations that represented sources of difficulty at work for
French psychologists. These situations are set out in the fol-
lowing section, starting with those with the most occurrences
(see Table 1).
Experience of work. Occurrences in this category concerned
the way in which psychologists experienced their work
(29.96% of all occurrences). Coming top in this category was
a general lack of recognition (34.38% of occurrences in this
category), particularly in the case of psychologists working
for private companies (33.33% of them), and hospitals
(24.53% in private hospitals, 22.83% in public ones). Then
came a sense of being devalued at work, through more or less
explicit insults or derogatory remarks about their qualities
and competence, criticism, scornful comments, and verbal
attacks (20.63%). This was the case for those working in
public administrations (16% of them) and hospitals (15.09%
and 14.96% for private and public hospitals, respectively).
Another frequently cited subcategory was the feeling of not
being able to find a solution that psychologists can some-
times have when confronted with their clients' problems.
This subcategory represented 18.62% of occurrences in this
category and was encountered mostly by those working for
private companies (25% of them) and in public administra-
tions (24%). The final subcategory concerned the conflicts
they encountered over interests, values, and ethics (11.17%).
Patient relations. Occurrences of this category concerned dif-
ficult relationships with patients/clients and/or their families.
They represented 24.82% of total occurrences and predomi-
nantly concerned instances where the psychologists had been
touched or moved by the illness and suffering of their patients
(68.65% of occurrences in this category), which is perceived
as a difficult experience. All categories of psychologists fre-
quently reported these events, ranging from 34.74% of those
working in public hospitals to 48% of those working in pub-
lic administrations. The other subcategories concerned direct
difficulties with patients who either did not want to be cured
or make progress (11.88%), or who were aggressive (9.57%).
Working conditions. Occurrences of this category represented
23.73% of all occurrences. They referred to the tangible
physical, economic, and social conditions that psychologists
encounter. Institutional problems and dysfunctions repre-
sented 25.17% of occurrences in this category. Psychologists
complained of the slowness of the institutions, their peculiar
and often counterintuitive logic that prevented them from
practicing correctly, and the difficulties involved in planning
or implementing projects. This was notably the case for psy-
chologists working for associations (14.17% of them), public
hospitals (15.35%), and administrations (12%). Poor

facilities and lack of space (14.33%) were also often reported
here. Psychologists cited the lack of a private office in which
to practice (posing problems of confidentiality and requiring
them to change location frequently). This was particularly
true for psychologists working for private companies (12.5%
of them). Finally, economic pressures (pressure to be produc-
tive and efficient; 11.19%) and time pressure (10.49%) were
often reported in this category, particularly by psychologists
working for companies (20.83% of them reported time pres-
sure, 12.50% economic pressures). Other occurrences con-
cerned difficulties such as large workloads (8.74%), lack of
job security (8.74%), low salaries (6.99%), or conflicting
roles (being asked to do something that is not in one's job
description; 5.94%).
Relations with colleagues and superiors.This category repre-
sented 22.16% of all occurrences and concerned problems
the participants had with their colleagues (mostly in public
hospitals), the teams in which they worked (24.34%), or their
immediate superiors, who either abused them or were in
direct conflict with them (30.34%, mostly in public adminis-
trations or associations). Some occurrences concerned a lack
of teamwork, either because there was no such team or
because the existing team excluded them or did not take
them properly into account, which created conflicts (16.10%).
Finally, some occurrences concerned collective (from col-
leagues) and/or institutional abuse (12.73%). This included
verbal and physical abuse, and a total lack of consideration
from patients or families (particularly so in hospitals).
Descriptive Statistics
As we did not know exactly what participants who had not
reported any events were referring to when they responded to
the PAIT, we only computed results for participants who had
reported at least one event (n = 558). There were no signifi-
cant differences in variables between those who reported an
event and those who did not, except for the CPI subscale,
F(1, 840) = 5.65, p < .02, as those who had reported at least
one event judged the situation(s) to be less challenging to
their identity than those who had not reported any.
To link sources of stress with other measures, we com-
puted several indices. First of all, we summed the sources of
difficulties the participants had cited (a) across all categories
(total number of sources) and (b) within each of the four cat-
egories. Second, we calculated an index representing the
number of categories cited (one, two, three, or four) by each
participant.
As can be seen in Table 2, the psychologists appraised the
situations they cited as being threatening to their professional
identity (TSI: M = 2.91, SD = 1.19) and challenging to that
identity (CSI: M = 3.43, SD = .87). Their level of satisfaction
with their working conditions was just above the theoretical
mean of the scale (M = 4.20, SD = 1.64), and they perceived
their professional status as being extremely threatened (M =
5.70, SD = 1.30). They also perceived more stress (M = 2.84,
SD = .96) than that observed among French employees in
general (M = 2.51, SD = .54, t = 7.05, p < .0001; see Lesage
& Berjot, 2012).
As for events, Table 2 showed that the mean number of

experience of work's category had the highest mean number
of occurrences (M = .63, SD =.78), followed by patient rela-

= .79), and relations with colleagues and superiors (M = .47,
SD = .72).
The correlational analyses showed that number of sources
and total number of categories were significantly linked to
TPI (r = .24 and .17) and, even more so, to threat to

professional identity (r = .34 and .29), indicating that the
more participants reported events, the more they appraised
them as a threats to their professional identity. These factors
were not linked to challenge appraisals. The same pattern
was found for each of the four categories, with the exception
of patient relations, which was negatively correlated with
TSI (r = -.35) and, to a lesser extent, with TPI (r = -.12),
indicating that psychologists who encounter these kinds of
situations do not regard them as threats to their identity. As
for the link between reporting events and other measures,
results showed that total number of sources and number of
categories were correlated negatively with satisfaction with
working conditions (r = -.20 and -.17), and positively with
stress (r = .16 and .11). Only total number of sources was
correlated with perceived threat to status (r = .13). As for
types of sources, results showed that working conditions was
correlated negatively with work satisfaction (r = -.26) and
positively with threat to status and perceived stress (r = .18
and .17). Once again, patient relations was correlated posi-
tively with work satisfaction (r = .14) and negatively with
threat to status (r = -.16). It was not linked to stress. Finally,
relations with colleagues and superiors seemed particularly
deleterious, as it was correlated negatively with work satis-
faction (r = -.34), positively with threat to status (r = .12)
and perceived stress (r = .46).
Analyses showed, however, that threat appraisals were
significantly linked to other measures. Thus, TPI was linked
to work satisfaction (r = -.34), threat to occupational status
(r = .12) and perceived stress (r = .34), as was TSI (r = -.34,
.34, .18). It is worth noting that CPI was correlated positively
with threat to status and negatively with stress.
Threat Appraisals as Mediators Between Sources
of Difficulties and Perceived Stress
To test for multiple mediations, we followed the procedure
described by Preacher and Hayes, using their macro for
SPSS 18. This statistical analysis is based on the Baron and
Kenny procedure (1986) for testing for mediators, but makes
it possible to test for more than one at a time. Given that the
correlational analyses only showed significant relations for
threat appraisals, we excluded challenge appraisals from
these fresh analyses (expect for the patient relations category,
which was linked to CPI). We ran a multiple regression anal-
ysis for all the independent variables (IVs), with the two
types of threat as simultaneous mediators and perceived
stress as a dependent variable (DV).
Total number of sources.The model was significant for this
first analysis, R2 = .25, F(3, 799) = 89.18, p < .001, with a
significant total effect of number of sources on perceived
stress (corresponding to the direct link between the IV and
DV,  = .14, p < .001) and a nonsignificant direct effect (cor-
responding to the effect between the IV and DV while the
mediators were controlled,  = .14, p = .22, ns), showing that
the relationship ceased to exist once we had entered the
mediators. Moreover, the effects of number of sources on the
two mediators (TPI and TSI) were only significant for TPI
( = .19, p < .001), ruling out TSI as a mediator. Finally, the
link between TPI and perceived stress was significant
( = .48, p < .001), indicating that only TPI mediated the
relationship between the sources of difficulties and perceived
stress (TPI confidence interval = [.062, .13]).
Total number of categories. The model was again significant,
R2 = .25, F(3, 799) = 89.14, p < .001, with a significant total
effect of number of sources on stress ( = .11, p < .001) and
a nonsignificant direct effect ( = .04, p = .27, ns). The links
between the IV and each of the two mediators were both sig-
nificant ( = .14, p < .001, for TPI and  = .24, p < .001, for
TSI). As for the links between the mediators and the DV,
only the one between TPI and perceived stress was signifi-
cant ( = .49, p < .001), again indicating that TPI was the
only mediator in the relationship between the number of cat-
egories cited and perceived stress.
Working conditions.The model was significant, R2 = .26,
F(3, 799) = 92.10, p < .001, with a significant total effect of
number of sources on stress ( = .16, p < .001) and a signifi-
cant but smaller direct effect ( = .08, p < .01). The links
between the IV and the mediators were significant ( = .13,
p < .001, for TPI and  = .28, p < .001, for TSI). As for the
links between the mediators and the DV, only the one
between TPI and perceived stress was significant ( = .49,
p < .001), indicating yet again that TPI was the only mediator.
Experience of work.The model was significant, R2 = .22,
F(3, 799) = 92.10, p < .001, with a significant total effect of
number of sources on stress ( = .10, p < .01) and a signifi-
cant direct effect ( = -.02, p = ns). The links between the
IV and each of the two mediators were significant ( = .20,
p < .001, for TPI and .39, p < .001 for TSI). Only the link
between TPI and perceived stress was significant ( = .49,
p < .001), indicating that TPI was the only mediator.
Patient relations. The model was again significant, R2 = .25,
F(4, 798) = 68.05, p < .001, with a nonsignificant total
effect of number of sources on stress ( = -.05, p = ns) and
a nonsignificant direct effect ( = .02, p = ns). The links
between the IV and the three mediators showed that only
TPI was significant ( = -.49, p < .001). Only the links
between TPI and CPI and perceived stress were significant
( = .48, p < .001, for TPI and  = -.08, p < .03, for CPI),
indicating the absence of a mediator.
Relations with colleagues and superiors. The model was again
significant, R2 = .25, F(3, 799) = 88.51, p < .001, with a sig-
nificant total effect of number of sources on stress ( = .07,
p = .05) and a nonsignificant direct effect ( = .0005, p = ns).
The links between the IV and the two mediators showed that
8 SAGE Open
both types of threat to identity were significant ( = .12,
p < .001, for TPI and  = .21, p < .001, for TSI). However, only
the link between TPI and perceived stress was significant
( = .49, p < .001), indicating that only TPI was a mediator.
Taken together, the results of these analyses showed that
TPI mediated relations between several IVs and perceived
stress, in particular total number of occurrences and total
number of types of sources, as well as all categories of
sources of difficulty, with the exception of patient relations.
Discussion
The aim of this study was to find out (a) whether difficult
situations encountered at work can be identity relevant for
psychologists--a population particularly committed to their
work and at risk of stress and burnout (Ackerley et al., 1998;
Raquepaw & Miller, 1989; Vredenburgh et al., 1999), (b)
how those situations are appraised in terms of identity threat
and/or challenge, (c) whether these situations are perceived
of as stressful, and finally, (d) if this is the case, whether this
relation is mediated by identity appraisals.
Our results showed that a great many everyday work situ-
ations were relevant to the psychologists' identity. Some con-
cerned working conditions and interpersonal problems (with
colleagues and superiors). Others concerned situations that
were more central to identity, such as experience of work and
patient relations. More specifically, working conditions and
relations with colleagues and superiors seemed to threaten the
professional aspect of identity, whereas experience of work
threatened both aspects of it. This can be explained by the fact
that the latter category concerns the way in which people
experience their work, rather than the actual physical and
material conditions. Accordingly, while working conditions
or conflicts with colleagues can represent a threat to the pro-
fessional we think we are, calling us into question because we
do not have adequate facilities to practice our profession
properly, the denigration or lack of recognition we receive
from others certainly has a deeper impact, calling not just our
professional identity into question but also and above all our
individual identity. If stressors such as harassment or violence
are so harmful, it is precisely because they go beyond our
professional identity and have an impact on ourselves as
individuals.
We also noticed that the most identity-relevant sources
were well represented. Taken together, lack of recognition
and devaluation represented 55.01% of their category (almost
16% of total occurrences), while being moved by suffering
represented 65.65% of its category (17.26% of total occur-
rences). This high frequency may have been due to the speci-
ficities of the sample population, who have daily contacts
with patients and/or clients who are suffering or at least need
help. However, the extensive literature on burnout shows
that a great many occupations actually involve regular con-
tacts with people who are suffering, have problems, or who
are aggressive, unhappy, needy, or protesting (e.g., social
services, health care, teaching, and private institutions such
as banks and call centers; Schaufeli & Buunk, 2003)
Most of these situations have already been identified and
are well-known sources of stress. For example, a recent
memo from the French Department of Labor (Dares
Analyses, 2010) divided psychosocial risks into six catego-
ries: (a) work demands (e.g., workload, time pressure),
(b) emotional demands (e.g., contact with suffering, need to
conceal emotions, relations with the public), (c) autonomy
(e.g., prevented from using skills, lack of autonomy),
(d) interpersonal relations (e.g., conflicts with colleagues and
superiors, harassment, lack of recognition), (e) conflicting
values, and (f) socioeconomic insecurity. Almost all our
sources of difficulties figured in this classification, although
some of our categories partly overlapped or were not specifi-
cally identified, doubtless because they were too specific.
One of our results did not, however, fit the usual pattern.
Patient relations were correlated negatively with threat
appraisals (especially TPI), and positively with CPI and
work satisfaction. All the occurrences for this category con-
cerned problems or, at the very least, things that were identi-
fied as problematic and/or painful. This pattern may be
specific to psychologists or, at any rate, to professionals who
frequently come into contact with patients and suffering or,
as mentioned earlier, who identify closely with their profes-
sion. Psychologists certainly identify closely with their pro-
fession, and according to social identity theory and recent
studies (Haslam et al., 2005), this may protect them from
stress. Senter, Morgan, Serna-McDonald, and Bewley
(2010), for example, reported a correlation of .30 between
psychologists' occupational identification and their score on
the "personal accomplishment" subscale of burnout (correla-
tion of -.21 between identification and the "emotional
exhaustion" subscale). In a study of 521 counseling psychol-
ogists in private practice, Vredenburgh and colleagues (1999)
reported a positive relationship between hours of client con-
tact per week and sense of personal accomplishment (see
also Rupert & Morgan, 2005; Rupert, Stevanovic, & Hunley,
2009, for a similar results). Moreover, for psychologists, this
identification with occupation seems to be strongly associ-
ated with several specific and characteristic values, one of
which is empathy (Carlozzi, Bull, Stein, Ray, & Barnes,
2002), as their definition of empathy is strongly linked to
their identification with specific theories of psychotherapy.
Accordingly, the more contacts psychologists have with
patients and the more opportunities they have to exercise
their professional skills, the more they can express their pro-
fessional identity and feel useful and competent.
Finally, another aim of this study was to see whether iden-
tity-relevant situations had an impact on perceived stress and
then to explore the processes that explained this relationship.
The results of the multiple regression analyses showed that
the personal aspect of identity explained the relationship
between most sources of difficulty and perceived stress. In
other words, if these situations affected stress, it was because
Berjot et al. 9
of their impact on this specific aspect of identity. The litera-
ture exploring the effects of identity threats with regard to
discrimination and stigmatization shows that threats to the
personal aspect of identity are more painful than threats to
the social aspect. For a start, there is a very complex relation-
ship between social identity (and the identification it implies)
and outcomes (e.g., lowered self-esteem, stress). TSI often
elicits an increase in group identification, which can then
serve as a resource for coping with the threat (in the form of
social support or sharing the same faith) and thus lessen its
effects. Second, the social and personal aspects of identity
are not independent of each other. Group memberships and
different identifications are part of who we are. As such, a
threat to the social aspect of identity often has an impact on
its personal aspect, too, especially for highly identified peo-
ple (Branscombe, Schmitt, & Harvey, 1999; Schmitt &
Branscombe, 2002). In short, a threat to the professional
aspect of identity may well be particularly detrimental to the
personal identity of individuals but at the same time be alle-
viated by this very identification, insofar as it serves as a
resource for coping with the difficult situation (Haslam et al.,
2004, Haslam et al., 2005).
To conclude, there is far too little research in the literature
bearing on the identity-threatening aspects of particularly
stressful working situations and the impact on stress (most
studies focus on identity as a resource). Surprisingly, the cen-
trality of identity is only highlighted in the literature on
symptoms (not causes), such as burnout (Schaufeli & Buunk,
2003). For example, when Severinsson (2003) interviewed a
nurse suffering from burnout, the results of her qualitative
content analysis identified three themes, all related to the
nurse's identity (e.g., her personal experience, ethical prob-
lems, and feelings of helplessness­existential issues of suf-
fering). However, even if extreme symptoms of stress are
often accompanied by identity problems or effects (e.g., low-
ered self-esteem, depression), all too few studies in the work-
place have explicitly explored the link between what is
identity-threatening in an environment and its impact on
health. There is much to gain from adopting the stress and
coping with identity threat model to explore employees'
reactions to stressful situations in terms of antecedents and
consequences. In particular, because this model draws on
abundant literature (social identity theory in particular; see
Ashforth & Mael, 1989, for a discussion of its application to
organizational contexts), it could allow us to make more pre-
cise predictions about, for example, the strategies that people
use to cope with such threats. The literature on identity con-
tains descriptions of the specific strategies people use to cope
with identity threats, such as self-affirmation or self-handi-
capping, some being more useful and efficient than others
(Berjot & Gillet, 2011).
Drawing on the literature on organizational stress, the
present study extended this area of investigation to situations
that can threaten identity and the way in which these threats
can affect stress. Moreover, we sought to differentiate
between two aspects of identity that shape our daily working
activities, that is, its personal and professional aspects. We
are conscious that this is the first attempt to directly link
stressful situations to identity threats and that much more
research is needed to explore how and why specific stressful
situations affect identity and stress.
