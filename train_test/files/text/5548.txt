Introduction
Impulsivity can be defined as a "predisposition toward rapid,
unplanned reactions to internal or external stimuli without
regard to the negative consequences of these reactions to the
impulsive individual or to others" (Moeller, Barratt,
Dougherty, Schmitz, & Swann, 2001, p. 1784). One of the
most widely used measures for the assessment of impulsivity
is the 11th revision of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-
11; Patton, Stanford, & Barratt, 1995). It consists of 30 items
that are answered on a 4-point scale ranging from rarely/
never to almost always/always. A total score and three sub-
scale scores can be calculated, representing Non-Planning
Impulsivity (i.e., lack of future orientation or forethought),
Motor Impulsivity (i.e., acting without thinking), and
Attentional Impulsivity (i.e., inability to focus attention or
concentrate; Patton et al., 1995; but note that many studies
failed to replicate this three-factorial structure; cf.
Vasconcelos, Malloy-Diniz, & Correa, 2012).
Spinella (2007) developed a short form of the BIS-11,
which consists of 15 items only, and each subscale contains
5 items. Scores of the BIS-15 are highly correlated with the
full version, suggesting that it may be used as an alternative
to the full version without losing a significant amount of
information (Spinella, 2007). Psychometric properties such
as factor structure, internal consistency, and validity could be
replicated in German and Spanish (Meule, Vögele, & Kübler,
2011; Orozco-Cabal, Rodríguez, Herin, Gempeler, & Uribe,
2010).
Impulsivity is supposed to be a stable personality trait,
particularly when it is measured with self-report question-
naires. Accordingly, for the BIS-11, high 1-month retest-
reliability has been reported for the total scale (r
tt
= .83), and
values were somewhat lower for the subscales (r
tt
= .61-.72;
Stanford et al., 2009). To date, retest-reliability has not been
investigated using the BIS-15, and, thus, the aim of the pres-
ent study was to examine retest-reliability for this short ver-
sion. Moreover, we used a longer time span (almost half a
year) than previous studies on the BIS-11 (Stanford et al.,
2009) to get a more appropriate indication for the assumption
that impulsivity is a stable trait.

Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 2008. Female univer-

Abstract
One of the most widely used instruments for the measurement of impulsivity is the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11). The
short form of the BIS-11, the BIS-15, consists of 15 items representing the three subscales Attentional, Motor, and Non-Planning
Impulsivity. In the current study, retest-reliabilities of BIS-15 scores were examined. Female university students completed
the BIS-15 at the beginning of the first (n = 133) and second (n = 120) semesters. Half-year retest-reliability was r
tt
= .79 for
the BIS-15 total score and ranged between r
tt
= .61 and .78 for the subscales. Considering the long time span of almost half
a year between measurements, the total score of the BIS-15 has high retest-reliability and, thus, measures impulsivity as a
stable personality trait.

completed a paper-and-pencil version of the BIS-15 among
other measures in the laboratory at the beginning of the first
semester. One hundred twenty participants completed those
measures again at the beginning of the second semester.
Participants received either course credits or 7,-  for com-
pensation. Mean time between measurements was M =
170.65 days (SD = 9.00).
Cronbach's alpha was calculated for BIS-15 subscales
and the total scale for both measurements separately to eval-
uate internal consistency. Pearson correlation coefficients
were calculated for BIS-15 subscale and total scores between
the two measurements to evaluate retest-reliability. Finally,
BIS-15 subscale and total scores between the two measure-
ments were compared with paired t tests.
Results
Descriptive statistics of BIS-15 scores are presented in Table 1.
Scores did not differ between measurements, all ts

between r

= .61 and .78 and was r
tt

(Table 1, Figure 1).
Discussion
The current study examined half-year retest-reliability of the
BIS-15. Overall, values were comparable with those reported
for 1-month retest-reliability of the BIS-11 (Stanford et al.,
2009). A general rule of thumb is that retest-reliability is
acceptable or high at r
tt
>.80 (Bühner, 2011). Although values
were below .80 in the current study, we would nonetheless
argue that at least the total score of the BIS-15 has high retest-
reliability, considering the long time span of almost half a year
between the two measurements. Moreover, retest-reliability of
the total score was higher than in some studies, in which ver-
sions of the BIS-11 were used (Vasconcelos et al., 2012).
Similar to results obtained with the BIS-11, retest-reliabilities
were lower for the subscales than for the total scale, which may

be due to their lower internal consistencies (Table 1). The atten-
tional impulsivity subscale showed the lowest internal consis-
tency and retest-reliability. This is in line with observations that
this subscale appears to be the most unstable one in studies, in
which the factor structure of the BIS-11 was examined
(Vasconcelos et al., 2012). Nevertheless, correlation coefficients
were still higher than .60, indicating large-sized correlation
coefficients (Cohen, 1988).
Interpretation of the current findings is limited by the
fact that only female university students were investigated.
Future studies may investigate other samples such as men
or individuals with lower education or higher age to reveal
whether the BIS-15 also has high retest-reliability in these
populations. For example, impulsivity has been found to
decline with age (Steinberg et al., 2008), and, thus, retest-
reliability would probably be lower in samples with wider
age range or when retest-reliability would be examined for
several years. Other avenues for future research may be to
examine whether BIS-15 scores are sensitive to treatment
in mental disorders that are marked by high impulsivity
such as borderline personality disorder, attention deficit/
hyperactivity disorder, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disor-
der, obesity, or substance use disorders (Guerrieri,
Nederkoorn, & Jansen, 2008; Meule, 2013; Moeller et al.,
2001; Orozco-Cabal et al., 2010; Waxman, 2009). That is,
although impulsivity appears to be a stable trait in non-
clinical samples, it may be modifiable (Guerrieri,
Nederkoorn, & Jansen, 2012; Guerrieri, Nederkoorn,
Schrooten, Martijn, & Jansen, 2009; Guerrieri et al., 2007),
and scores may decrease in the course of psychotherapy in
clinical samples.
