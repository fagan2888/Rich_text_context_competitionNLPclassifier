The Communicative Function of Sad
Facial Expressions
Lawrence Ian Reed1 and Peter DeScioli2
Abstract
What are the communicative functions of sad facial expressions? Research shows that people feel sadness in response to losses
but it's unclear whether sad expressions function to communicate losses to others and if so, what makes these signals credible.
Here we use economic games to test the hypothesis that sad expressions lend credibility to claims of loss. Participants play the
role of either a proposer or recipient in a game with a fictional backstory and real monetary payoffs. The proposers view a
(fictional) video of the recipient's character displaying either a neutral or sad expression paired with a claim of loss. The proposer
then decided how much money to give to the recipient. In three experiments, we test alternative theories by using situations in
which the recipient's losses were uncertain (Experiment 1), the recipient's losses were certain (Experiment 2), or the recipient
claims failed gains rather than losses (Experiment 3). Overall, we find that participants gave more money to recipients who
displayed sad expressions compared to neutral expressions, but only under conditions of uncertain loss. This finding supports the
hypothesis that sad expressions function to increase the credibility of claims of loss.

A person with a sad expression on their face conveys a potent
message. Drooping eyelids, downcast eyes, lowered lip corners,
and slanting inner eyebrows have an arresting effect on observ-
ers. However, the social functions of sad expressions are not well
understood. We test whether sadness functions to enhance a
person's credibility when they claim to have suffered a loss.
We can better understand sad faces by considering the evo-
lutionary functions of facial expressions more generally.
Darwin (1998) proposed that facial expressions serve mainly
physiological functions by changing the configuration of facial
muscles in response to environmental stimuli. For example,
fear expressions widen the eyes and raise the eyebrows to
increase peripheral vision (Susskind, Lee, Cusi, Grabski, &
Anderson, 2008), and disgust expressions protrude the tongue
and constrict the nose to reduce exposure to pathogens
(Chapman, Kim, Susskind, & Anderson, 2009). Furthermore,
Darwin's antithesis principle holds that some emotions cause
the opposite facial movements of opposite emotions. For exam-
ple, happiness causes raised cheeks and lip corners because
negative emotions depress (sadness), dimple (contempt), or
widen (fear) the lip corners (Darwin, 1998; Ekman, 2003).
More recently, evolutionary theorists proposed that some
emotional expressions serve communicative functions by
showing how initial physiological responses later evolved as
signals (Dawkins & Krebs, 1978; Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1989;
Ekman, 1992; Krebs & Dawkins, 1984; Shariff & Tracy, 2011).
What messages might sad expressions function to commu-
nicate? People feel sadness in response to losses such as losing
resources, status, friends, or romantic partners (Nesse, 1990).
Furthermore, sadness is more intense when the lost resources
had greater value for biological fitness (Tooby & Cosmides,
1990). For example, parents experience more intense grief in
response to the death of a child when they are closer to repro-
ductive age (Crawford, Salter, & Jang, 1989). One function of

the emotion of sadness might be to update multiple cognitive
systems to integrate the implications of the loss, which has
been referred to as a recalibration function (Tooby, Cosmides,
Sell, Lieberman, & Sznycer, 2008). By drawing attention
inward, an individual can dwell on misfortunes in order to
invest cognitive resources toward learning to avoid similar
hardships in the future and developing plans to mitigate the
loss in the present. The sad expression could complement this
function by signaling losses to others in order to recruit help
toward recovering from the misfortune. Related, one theory
proposes that the chronic state of sadness found in depression
functions in part to communicate losses (Fridlund, 1994) in
order to solicit help from other people (Ekman, 2003; Lewis,
1934; Nesse, 2001; Watson & Andrews, 2002).
The theory that sad expressions signal losses raises two
important questions. The first question is why receivers might
altruistically help a sad signaler who has experienced a loss.
Several theories can potentially explain a desire to compensate
losses. Direct and indirect reciprocity theories imply that com-
pensating a loss could create a debt that the creditor can redeem
in the future (Nowak & Sigmund, 1998; Trivers, 1971). The
welfare-tradeoff theory is a version of reciprocity theory in
which people are more likely to help a person who has suffered
a loss when there is a favorable ratio of costs to self versus
benefits to the recipient, creating a good opportunity to invest
in valuable social relationships (Delton & Robertson, 2016;
Sell, 2011; Sell, Tooby, & Cosmides, 2009). Last, the risk-
pooling theory holds that humans help others who suffer mis-
fortunes in order to pool risk and smooth consumption over
time (H. Kaplan, Hill, Lancaster, & Hurtado, 2000; H. S.
Kaplan, Schniter, Smith, & Wilson, 2012).
The second question, and our primary interest, is why recei-
vers should take sad expressions at face value. If the function of
sad expressions is to solicit resources, then individuals could
fake the signal in order to manipulate receivers into providing
resources even when a loss did not occur. That is, receivers can
benefit from helping cooperative partners, but only at the risk
of being duped by cheaters who fake or exaggerate their losses
(Dawkins & Krebs, 1978). This presents a difficult adaptive
problem. Receivers who indiscriminately share resources with
requesters are vulnerable to cheaters. On the other hand, recei-
vers who shun all requesters could damage their reputations
and lose valuable partners who have honestly suffered a loss.
This reasoning suggests that people should be moderately skep-
tical toward claims of loss in order to distinguish honest from
deceptive pleas for help.
Previous research has addressed this issue by arguing that
emotional expressions are designed to increase the credibility
of the messages they accompany (R. H. Frank, 1988; Hirshlei-
fer, 1987; Nesse, 2001; Pinker, 1997). Individuals could poten-
tially fake emotions such as anger, sadness, or disgust which
would lead receivers to eventually ignore the associated
expressions as deceptive "cheap talk" (Dawkins & Krebs,
1978). However, emotional signals can still be favored by evo-
lution if they are difficult or costly to fake (R. H. Frank, 1988;
Hirshleifer, 1987; Nesse, 2001; Pinker, 1997). More generally,
evolutionary theories of communication (Maynard Smith &
Harper, 2003) have shown how honest signals can be main-
tained by evolution in multiple ways including when (a) the
signaler and receiver have the same goals instead of conflicting
interests, (b) the signal is an index of the underlying trait that is
difficult to fake (e.g., when a roar is an index for body size), (c)
the signal is more costly to send for one type than another,
generating a separating equilibrium (the same can occur for a
constant cost with a differential benefit); importantly, these
differential costs can be costs of producing the signal or costs
associated with the consequences of faking the signal, for
example, if liars are punished when detected.
For emotions, it is clear that emotional expressions are, at
least, difficult to consciously fake (which is not the same as
difficult for faking to evolve, see below). A characteristic fea-
ture of emotions is that they are mostly involuntary and diffi-
cult to consciously control. Even with professional training,
actors often find it difficult to fake realistic emotional expres-
sions. Studies show that people's emotional expressions reli-
ably coincide with their self-reported feelings as well as
physiological states (Ekman, Levenson, & Friesen, 1983;
Rosenberg & Ekman, 2005). Furthermore, the facial muscles
used in expressions are difficult to activate in the absence of
relevant emotions and difficult to inhibit in the presence of
relevant emotions (Ekman & Friesen, 1982; Ekman, Levenson,
& Friesen, 1985). These include two facial actions involved in
the expression of sadness: the inner eyebrow raiser (medial
frontalis) and the lip corner depressor (triangularis). Finally,
facial expressions have been shown to accurately reflect both
emotional experiences (Izard, 1971) and action tendencies (Fri-
dlund, 1994; Kraut & Jonston, 1979).
Importantly, the fact that emotions are difficult to con-
sciously fake does not by itself mean that it is difficult for faked
expressions to evolve. Hence, additional arguments are
required to explain why emotional expressions might remain
outside of conscious control, rather than natural selection
favoring mutants who can fake them. Several of the standard
evolutionary arguments about signals could apply to emotional
expressions, including common interests, reliable indices, or
differential costs (or benefits).
Most commonly, credibility theories hold that evolution
favored emotional expressions that were both honest and dif-
ficult to consciously fake because individuals with these char-
acteristics attracted better social partners than their more
rational competitors (R. H. Frank, 1988; Tooby & Cosmides,
1996). Hence, the basic idea is that liars suffer greater social
costs by losing quality partners. For example, in the context of
romantic love, people prefer mates who are emotionally and
involuntarily attached to them, since this predicts that the mate
is less likely to desert the individual for a romantic competitor
(Buss, 1988, 2016). Given this preference, individuals who can
signal their irrational romantic emotions thereby gain an advan-
tage in competing for mates. In contrast, cheaters who fake
their attachment while in fact courting additional mates are
typically found out and abandoned. The same idea applies to
altruism and cooperation: People prefer partners who help
2 Evolutionary Psychology
based on involuntary altruistic feelings rather than partners
who only calculate the future benefits to themselves for help-
ing. In this social world, people who help based on involuntary
emotions gain an evolutionary advantage in the competition for
quality partners.
Evolution could also favor honesty if liars suffer greater
costs of punishment. Punishments could come in the form of
withheld resources, direct attacks, or reputational damage. If
these costly consequences outweigh the immediate benefits of
dishonesty, then evolution can favor honest emotional expres-
sions (McCullough, 2016; Searcy & Nowicki, 2005).
Additionally, an emotional expression could potentially be
an index of an underlying emotional state that is difficult to
fake. This could occur if emotional expressions are components
within a larger suite of processes included in an emotion that
are together activated involuntarily (Cosmides & Tooby,
2000). There are good functional reasons why basic emotions
like fear and disgust remain outside of conscious control--so
individuals cannot easily override them to engage in damaging
behaviors like jumping off of cliffs or eating rotten corpses. If
emotional expressions are contained within the larger cogni-
tive architecture of an emotional program, then they would be
involuntary by default and hence reliable indices of the emo-
tional state. Of course, in principle, evolution could favor a
mutant with a dissociated emotional expression that is under
conscious control; however, this might be unlikely to occur
due to developmental constraints. By analogy, although it
could be advantageous and is certainly possible for a human
to mutate a third eye on the back of the head, this possibility is
limited by developmental constraints (Williams, 1997). For
similar reasons, it might be difficult for mutations to dissoci-
ate a complex facial expression from its origin within an
involuntary emotional program. If so, this would maintain
emotional expressions as reliable indices of underlying
emotional states.
Hence, there are several possible evolutionary pathways that
could theoretically maintain honest emotional expressions.
However, whether a particular emotional expression in fact
tends to be honest and whether it is interpreted by receivers
as honest (at least more likely to be honest) are empirical
questions that need to be addressed case by case for each
emotional expression.
Credibility theories have been investigated in several studies
of specific facial expressions. Reed, Zeglen, and Schmidt (2012)
measured participants' facial expressions during their promises
to cooperate in an anonymous, one-shot, prisoner's dilemma
game. Receivers judged participants who smiled during their
promises to be more likely to cooperate. Furthermore, the recei-
vers were correct: Smiles were associated with increased rates of
cooperation. Similar findings for smiles were found in other
studies examining the dictator game (Brown & Moore, 2002)
and trust game (Berg & McCabe, 1995; Centorrino, Djemai,
Hopfensitz, Milinski, & Seabright, 2015).
Angry expressions, on the other hand, were found to
increase the credibility of threats. Using an ultimatum game,
Reed, DeScioli, and Pinker (2014) found that a responder's
written threats paired with an angry facial expression resulted
in higher proposer offers in comparison to threats paired with a
neutral expression. Furthermore, the effects of anger were
greater when the responder's demand was excessive (70% of
money) and hence doubtful, compared to a fairer and inherently
credible demand of 50%. This suggests that angry expressions
have particularly potent effects on a receiver when the resolve
of the sender might otherwise be in doubt.
Here we propose the credibility hypothesis for sad facial
expressions. This hypothesis holds that signalers use sad
expressions to add credibility to claims of loss in order to solicit
help. In response, receivers attribute greater credibility to
claims of loss that are bolstered by sad expressions. This
hypothesis predicts that receivers will be more willing to share
resources with requesters who show sad versus neutral expres-
sions. In contrast, a cheap-talk hypothesis that sad faces are
unreliable and manipulative signals predicts that a receiver's
contributions will not be swayed by a show of sadness. We test
these possibilities in Experiment 1.
The Current Investigation
We designed an economic game to investigate the communi-
cative functions of sad expressions. In this game, one partici-
pant is the proposer who has 90 cents and another participant is
the recipient who can ask the proposer for money after facing a
risk of losing their own 90 cents (see below). The recipient
sends a message to the proposer about whether they lost their
money, which might or might not be true. Then the proposer
decides whether to send up to 30 cents to the recipient, based on
whether they want to help and whether they believe the reci-
pient's message. This is a variant of the dictator game in which
a proposer decides how much money to transfer to a recipient
(Camerer, 2003).
The credibility hypothesis predicts that proposers will be
more likely to believe and send money to the recipient when
their message is paired with a sad face compared to a neutral
face. In contrast, if participants view a sad face as only cheap
talk, then we will observe no effects on how much money
participants send to recipients.
Experiment 1
Method
Participants were proposers or recipients in a modified dictator
game. Proposers were paired with a real participant as the
recipient, but they viewed a video and message that were actu-
ally from a confederate actor. This allowed us to control and
manipulate the content of the video and message. The video
clips showed either a neutral or sad facial expression paired
with a written message stating that the recipient suffered a loss
of their endowment (see below). Proposers did not know
whether this message was true.
We presented the game to participants using a fictional story
with real payoffs. We used a fictional scenario to provide a
Reed and DeScioli 3
concrete situation in which an individual could be uncertain
about another person's claim of loss. Participants played the
roles of two people going fishing to earn money. Participants
read that they usually catch 90 fish but might not catch any if
they are unlucky. Furthermore, the fishers knew that a storm
was coming and there was a 50% chance that the storm would
make them lose any fish they caught. Participants read that
each fish was worth 1 cent in real money.
The proposer learned that they caught 90 fish without losing
any in the storm. Then the proposer viewed a brief, prerecorded
video along with a written message from the recipient. In real-
ity, the message was preset and the video was previously
recorded with a confederate actress. The video showed either
a sad or neutral facial expression. The written message paired
with the video stated: "I caught 90 fish, but I lost them all in the
storm." According to the scenario, the proposer could not know
for sure if this message was true and whether the recipient
really lost their fish. The proposer had to decide for themselves
whether to believe the recipient's message. Finally, the propo-
ser decided whether to send up to 30 of their own fish to the
recipient.
Participants
We recruited 302 participants (180 males and 122 females)
using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk), an online crowd-
sourcing website in which individuals sign up to complete tasks
(Buhrmeister, Kwang, & Gosling, 2011; Horton, Rand, & Zec-
khauser, 2011). We chose a sample size with sufficient power
to detect a medium effect size (d ¼ 0.5, power ¼ 0.86). Parti-
cipants' mean age was 34.81 (SD ¼ 12.84) and their racial
distribution was: 87.7% Caucasian, 5.3% African American,
6% Asian American, and 1% other.
Procedure
Participants were randomly assigned as proposer or recipient.
Participants read a consent form followed by a description of
the fishing scenario. Each participant was paid US$0.50 for
completing the study and could earn extra money (paid in
MTurk bonus payments) depending on their decisions. Partici-
pants read the instructions describing the interaction between a
proposer and a recipient in a fictional fishing scenario. Impor-
tantly, participants read that although the scenario was fic-
tional, their partner and the payments were real. Participants
were required to correctly answer three comprehension ques-
tions in order to proceed. Each question presented a hypothe-
tical number of fish that were caught and shared and then asked
how much money the participant would earn (e.g., "Say that
you catch 30 fish. Let's also say that the other participant
catches 70 fish. If you give 15 fish to the other participant,
how much money will you earn?"). Participants were given
as many opportunities to answer these questions as needed and
could only proceed after each was correctly answered. No par-
ticipants were excluded on this basis. After the game, partici-
pants reported demographic information and were debriefed.
For the bonuses from the game, proposers received US$0.90
minus the amount that they sent to the recipient, and recipients
received the amount that their partner sent to them (in addition
to the base pay of 50 cents). Each participant completed a
single trial of this task in 5­7 min.
In the game, proposers decided how much of their 90 cents
to send to recipients, and recipients did not make a decision.
Before deciding, proposers viewed a written message and brief
video purportedly sent by their partner (see Figures 4 and 5 for
still images of the neutral and sad clips, respectively). The
written message stated "I caught 90 fish, but I lost them all
in the storm." The videos showed the same, female, college-
aged confederate with either a sad or neutral expression. For
the sad expression, we trained and instructed the confederate
to create the facial action units (AUs) described for sadness in
the Facial Action Coding System (Juslin & Scherer, 2005).
These consisted of AU1; inner eyebrow raiser, AU4; brow
furrower, AU15; lip corner depressor, AU43; upper eyelid
lowerer; and AU64; eyes down (Ekman, Friesen, & Hager,
1978). We showed video clips instead of static pictures
because they provide richer emotional content (Ambadar,
Schooler, & Cohn, 2005). Video clips were recorded at 30
frames per second and lasted 6 s in length. This duration is
similar in length to the average 4­6 s reported for spontaneous
expressions (M. G. Frank, Ekman, & Friesen, 1993; Schmidt,
Ambadar, Cohn, & Reed, 2006). After viewing the video and
message, proposers decided how many fish to send to the
recipient and how many to keep for themselves. Proposers
then rated how happy, sad, angry, fearful, and disgusted their
partner appeared in the video on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1
¼ not at all to 7 ¼ extremely).
Results and Discussion
We analyze only the proposers' (n ¼ 151) decisions, since
recipients did not make a decision in the game. As a manipula-
tion check, we first examined participant ratings of the (con-
federate) recipient's emotions depicted in the video clip (see
Table 1). Importantly, participants rated the sad clip as more
sad (M ¼ 5.82, SD ¼ 1.42) than the neutral clip (M ¼ 4.55,
SD ¼ 1.80), t(149) ¼ 4.78, p < .01, d ¼ 0.78. In addition,
participants rated the sad clip as less happy (M ¼ 1.25,

SD ¼ 0.84) than the neutral clip (M ¼ 1.99, SD ¼ 1.20), t(149)
¼ 4.37, p < .01, d ¼ 0.71. Proposers' offers did not differ by
gender or ethnicity (all ps > .05), so we aggregated across these
categories in subsequent analyses.
Figure 1 shows the main results. Proposers gave more
money to a recipient with the sad expression (M ¼ 16.58,
SD ¼ 13.42) compared to the neutral expression (M ¼ 11.48,
SD ¼ 18.52), t(149) ¼ 6.83, p ¼ .010, d ¼ .32. These data
support the hypothesis that a sad expression adds credibility in
situations of loss, eliciting greater resources from a helper
compared to a neutral expression.
Experiment 2
Method
Experiment 1 confirmed a prediction of the credibility hypoth-
esis by finding that proposers gave more money to recipients
with sad expressions compared to neutral expressions. How-
ever, an alternative interpretation of these results is that sad
expressions automatically evoke empathy and helping, whether
or not the loss is uncertain. Experiment 2 distinguishes these
two accounts by testing the effects of sad faces when the pro-
poser is certain about the recipient's loss. The credibility
hypothesis predicts that in this case, sadness will no longer
boost contributions because there is no uncertainty to resolve,
whereas the automatic-empathy hypothesis predicts similar
effects of sadness when loss is certain.
Participants
We recruited 302 participants on MTurk (189 males and 113
females), choosing a sample size with sufficient power to
detect a medium effect size (d ¼ 0.5, power ¼ 0.86). Their
mean age was 32.43 (SD ¼ 9.97); their racial distribution was
as follows: 81.2% Caucasian, 6.1% African American, 9.7%
Asian American, and 2.9% other.
Procedure
The procedure was the same as in Experiment 1 with one
exception: prior to viewing the video clip and written message,
proposers were explicitly told that the recipient had caught 90
fish, but lost them all in a storm. Following data collection,
proposers and recipients were randomly matched and the pay-
outs were calculated accordingly.
Results and Discussion
We analyze only the proposers' (n ¼ 151) decisions, since
recipients did not make a decision in the game. As in Experi-
ment 1, participants rated the sad clip as more sad (M ¼ 6.40,
SD ¼ 0.80) than the neutral clip (M ¼ 4.75, SD ¼ 1.84), t(149)
¼ 7.20, p < .01, d ¼ 1.16. In addition, participants rated the sad
clip as less happy (M ¼ 1.11, SD ¼ 0.26) than the neutral clip
(M ¼ 1.79, SD ¼ 1.01), t(149) ¼ 5.68, p < .01, d ¼ 0.92 (see
Table 2 for additional emotion ratings). Proposers' offers did
not differ by gender or ethnicity (all ps > .05), so we aggregated
across these categories in subsequent analyses.
Figure 2 shows the main results. Proposers' contributions
to the recipient with a sad expression (M ¼ 13.12, SD ¼
17.11) did not differ from the recipient with a neutral
expression (M ¼ 10.65, SD ¼ 19.35), t(149) ¼ 1.31, p ¼

.193, d ¼ .14. This indicates that when a message was
already credible for other reasons, sad expressions had little
effect on proposer offers, rather than automatically boosting
empathy and helping.
Experiment 3
Method
In Experiment 3, we test whether sad faces elicit compensation
for losses, specifically, or if they also elicit compensation for
failed gains. Previous theories of sadness focus on losses
(Nesse, 1990). However, people are also harmed by failing to
realize gains which could be another source of sad signals. For
example, a person who failed to find a job could be in just as
dire of a situation as someone who lost their job.
Even so, there are a few reasons why sadness might elicit
greater help for losses than failed gains. One reason is that
losses are often due to misfortunes outside of the person's
control, whereas failed gains can result both from misfortune
and also low effort. Someone who lost a resource must have at
least made enough effort to acquire it in the first place, whereas
someone who never had the resource might have made little or
no effort at all. Hence, individuals who compensate failed gains
could be more vulnerable to cheating by those who expend
little effort. A second reason is that a person's possible losses
are limited to what they have, whereas someone's possible
unrealized gains are unlimited. People's compensation beha-
vior might be less attuned to failed gains because they are too
open ended and numerous to practically manage.
To test for specificity, we use the same methods as Experi-
ment 1 except that proposers are presented with a recipient's
uncertain failed gain rather than loss. The general-
compensation hypothesis predicts that sad faces will show the
same effect for claims of failed gains, whereas the loss-specific
hypothesis predicts that sad faces will have a lesser effect for
claims of failed gains.
Participants
We recruited 312 participants on MTurk (211 males and 101
females), choosing a sample size with sufficient power to
detect a medium effect size (d ¼ 0.5, power ¼ 0.87). Their
mean age was 31.56 (SD ¼ 9.34); their racial distribution was
78.7% Caucasian, 6.1% African American, 9.7% Asian Amer-
ican, and 5.5% other.
Procedure
The procedure was identical to Experiment 1 with one excep-
tion: the sad and neutral clips with a statement of representing a
lack of gain ("I didn't catch any fish") as opposed to a loss ("I
caught 90 fish, but I lost them all in the storm").
Results and Discussion
We analyze only the proposers' (n ¼ 156) decisions, since
recipients did not make a decision in the game. As in Experi-
ments 1 and 2, we confirmed that participants rated the sad clip
as more sad (M ¼ 5.98, SD ¼ 1.30) than the neutral clip (M ¼
4.55, SD ¼ 1.77), t(154) ¼ 5.76, p < .05, d ¼ 0.92. In addition,
participants rated the sad clip as less happy (M ¼ 1.36, SD ¼
0.84) than the neutral clip (M ¼ 1.99, SD ¼ 1.16), t(154) ¼
3.93, p < .05, d ¼ 0.63 (see Table 3 for additional emotion
ratings). Proposers' offers did not differ by gender or ethnicity
(all ps > .05), so we aggregated across these categories in
subsequent analyses.
Figure 3 shows the main results. Proposers' contributions to
the recipient with a sad expression (M ¼ 10.99, SD ¼ 19.90)
did not differ from the recipient with a neutral expression (M ¼
10.68, SD ¼ 19.58), t(154) ¼ 0.307, p ¼ .526, d ¼ .02.
General Discussion
In three experiments, we tested the theory that sad expressions
signal loss in order to solicit help. The results support the
credibility hypothesis that sad expressions add credibility to
claims of loss and motivate receivers to share more resources.
In contrast, we did not find evidence for the automatic empathy

hypothesis: Sad expressions did not elicit greater sharing when
there was no uncertainty to resolve. Furthermore, we found that
the effects of sadness are specific to losses and did not extend to
failed gains. Overall, we find that sad expressions elicit help
from others mainly under conditions of uncertainty and loss.
These results dovetail with previous studies finding that
certain emotional expressions affect a viewer's behavior in
strategic interactions. For instance, participants showed greater
cooperation with partners who smiled (Berg, & McCabe, 1995;
Brown & Moore, 2002; Centorrino et al., 2015; Reed, Zeglen,
& Schmidt, 2012) and they made greater concessions to part-
ners who flashed an angry grimace (Reed, DeScioli, & Pinker,
2014). Furthermore, they provide additional support for cred-
ibility theories for emotional expressions more generally (R. H.
Frank, 1988; Hirshleifer, 1987; Pinker, 1997). Future research
could test this idea with other emotional expressions. For
example, fearful expressions may increase the credibility of
warnings about danger, while disgust expressions may increase
the credibility of claims that a substance is contaminated or
that the sender opposes a moral violation (Tybur, Lieberman,
Kurzban, & DeScioli, 2013).
In the present experiments, we examined situations in which
participants were uncertain about whether a loss occurred. We
note that sadness could also convey credibility about how
damaging the loss is to the signaler. For example, even if
someone is certain that a worker lost their job, they could still
be uncertain about the severity of the unemployed worker's
hardship. For instance, the worker might have savings or family
to rely on, they might have found temporary unreported work,
and they might have passed up possible jobs. In this situation,
the unemployed worker's sad expression could add credibility
to claims of urgent hardship, distinguishing from less urgent
needs. Hence, a sad expression could communicate information
that reduces uncertainty about the extent of threat posed by the
loss even when there is little uncertainty about whether the loss
occurred.
The stimulus expressions in these experiments were actually
faked by the confederate which perhaps makes it even more
surprising that participants attributed credibility to them. How-
ever, we note that our confederate actress had several advan-
tages compared to a typical person who displays an emotional
expression. Unlike typical signalers, the confederate received
specific training using the Facial Action Coding System that
helped them learn to give a convincing display. She had mul-
tiple opportunities and multiple takes to make a convincing
pitch. And, she had to be convincing only for a few seconds,
whereas in a real interaction, the signaler would need to main-
tain a convincing display for longer and under scrutiny and
possibly even interrogation by a receiver. Hence, given these
advantages, it might be less surprising that the confederate's
posed expression appeared believable to participants. Even so,
future research could examine spontaneous expressions to test
whether they are even more potent (though this is likely to pose
difficult challenges for experimental control).
Future research can also vary other characteristics of sad
expressions including the individual's characteristics such as
gender, age, ethnicity, attractiveness, formidability, and other
key factors. For instance, we used a female actress and a male
actor might elicit different responses, for example, a male's sad
face might be less convincing or could also be associated with
weakness.
Although the current findings shed light on the communi-
cative functions of sad expressions, they do not address why a
sad expression (characterized by drooping eyelids, downcast
eyes, lowered lip corners, and slanted inner eyebrows) involve
the specific changes in facial musculature that they do. Past
research has studied the specific muscular configurations of
other expressions. For example, fear expressions increase sen-
sory exposure (Susskind et al., 2008) and approximate
"babyish" faces (Marsh, Adams, & Kleck, 2005; Marsh,
Ambady, & Kleck, 2005), disgust expressions reduce exposure
to pathogens (Chapman et al., 2009), and angry expressions
exaggerate cues of formidability (Sell et al., 2009). Similar
work on the functions of sad expression may shed more light
on this question.
These findings help understand the ways that sad expres-
sions affect how people request and share resources in per-
sonal, face-to-face interactions, and possibly why people
might be less likely to help in response to impersonal requests.
Similarly, these results could help charities, foundations, and
fundraisers solicit resources through the media. Many charities

Reed and DeScioli 7
have discovered that advertisements that pair a worthy cause
with an image of a helpless, sick, or endangered person dis-
playing a sad expression can increase donations. The present
findings suggest that these images, in addition to promoting
empathy, could unconsciously boost the viewer's perception
of the victim's credibility. Charities might be able to make
requests for aid even more effective by further enhancing cues
of credibility. Finally, these findings show some of the uncon-
scious processes behind our own choices about whether or not
to help others in need.
