Abstract
Background
Various aspects of the environment are correlated with obesity. Most of the previous work in
this area centers on the built environment. We sought to better understand the association of
the natural environment with obesity.
Methods
We used the Natural Amenities Scale to characterize the attractiveness of 2,545 US counties
based on access to open water, varied topography, and mild climate. We obtained the height,
weight, age, sex, and address of adults from three different sources. The Departments of Motor
Vehicles from seven US states provided over 38 million records. A web survey contributed 3,012
from 48 states and the District of Columbia. A clinical study of adults with diabetes from four
states provided 974 more for a total of 38,159,046 analyzable records. We used logistic
regression to model the association of obesity with natural amenities while controlling for age,
sex, year of data collection, and various socioeconomic characteristics of the county.
Results
Natural amenities were inversely associated with obesity in all three populations. Over 20% of
residents of low amenity areas were obese, but less than 10% of those living with the best
natural amenities were obese.
Conclusions
The natural environment may affect health. Residing in areas with access to open water and a
variety of topographic features as well as cool, dry summers and warm, sunny winters is
associated with lower rates of obesity.

Introduction
The environment is associated with health issues. For instance, obesity tends to be more
common in the southern United States than New England or the Pacific Northwest [1]. Various
aspects of the built environment, including the degree of development, the transportation
network, and access to food distribution points, are associated with the prevalence of
obesity [2]. The natural environment may also be a contributor to energy balance and
obesity [3-4].
Lin, et al. used weather station records to estimate climate amenable for physical activity at the
county level and linked them to telephone survey data from 2002. They reported lower body
mass indices (BMI) among those counties with the most amenable climate after controlling for
individual risk factors, road density, household income, and unemployment [4]. McGinn, et al.
showed an association between physical activity and perceived measures of the natural
environment, but not to objective measures [3].
Like the built environment [5], the natural environment is a multi-dimensional construct.
Depending on context, it is characterized by factors such as topography, soils, hydrology,
climate, vegetation, and wildlife. A subset of these features were combined to create the
Natural Amenities Scale "based on the premise that people are drawn to areas with varied
topography; lakes, ponds, or oceanfront; warm, sunny winters; and temperate, low-humidity
summers" [6]. It was developed primarily to study rural migration patterns [7]. However, Jilcott,
et al. used the Natural Amenities Scale to study the relationship between the environment and
obesity in North Carolina [8]. Obesity was measured by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
Survey conducted by random-digit telephone calls. They reported a negative correlation
between amenities and obesity at the county level and presented some data showing that the
effect may be mediated by physical activity. More recently, this group extended the work to
include 3,106 counties in 48 states and again showed an inverse association between natural
amenities and obesity [9].
We sought to expand on these analyses by examining the relationship between natural
amenities and body mass measured at the individual level using data from three additional data
sets.
Materials And Methods
We used data from over 38 million individuals to build regression models of the relationship
between natural amenities and obesity while controlling for possible confounders. We
anticipated that obesity would be less common in areas with the most attractive amenities. The
null hypothesis was that obesity is not associated with natural amenities. We then re-examined
the robustness of the model in two independent data sets that offer complementary strengths
and weaknesses.
Data
Amenities and Other County-Level Descriptors
We used descriptors of counties from the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social
Research [10]. The data included the level of natural amenities for nearly all the counties in the
United States from the ERS Natural Amenity Scale [6]. Developed by the Economic Research
Service of the Department of Agriculture, this scale reflects measures of climate and
topography that most people prefer: warm sunny winters, temperate dry summers, variation in
topography, and access to rivers, streams, lakes, and oceans [7]. The data source does not
include Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands. Thirty-eight counties had values
2015 Littenberg et al. Cureus 7(11): e377. DOI 10.7759/cureus.377 2 of 13
estimated from adjacent counties. The amenity scale is centered near zero (mean of 3,111
counties = 0.06, median = -0.13) and runs from -6.4 (Red Lake, MN) to +11.17 (Ventura, CA)
with higher values representing more attractive amenities. The interquartile range runs from -
1.42 to +1.10. The top ten counties are all in California. The ten lowest scoring counties include
one from Indiana, three from North Dakota, and six from Minnesota.
The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research data set also contains
county-level estimates of the mean per capita personal income in 2005 from the US Department
of Commerce (Bureau of Economic Analysis, Regional Economic Information System 1969-
2005), the 2005 unemployment rate from the US Department of Labor (Bureau of Labor
Statistics, Local Area Unemployment Statistics Program), the 2004 crime rate from data
compiled by the Uniform Crime Reporting Program at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and
the land area, longitude, latitude, median age, percent of residents in various racial and ethnic
groups, population, and number of housing units in 2005 from the US Census. Income was
expressed in thousands of dollars per year.
Departments of Motor Vehicles (DMV) Data
We obtained the records of drivers' licenses and non-driver identification cards from the states
of Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Oregon, Texas, Vermont, and Washington, including date of issue,
height, weight, age at the time of issuance, gender, and home address. The zip code of the
home address was coded to a specific US county. If a zip code is associated with more than one
county, it was assigned to the county with the highest proportion of residential addresses from
that zip code [11]. We received 53,794,943 records from the Departments of Motor
Vehicles of seven states and omitted 1,483,013 from before 1966, 13,232,186 because they
applied to subjects under the age of 18, and 924,684 because they were missing one or more key
variables, leaving 38,155,060 records from 2,524 counties in 48 states and the District of
Columbia available for analysis (0.14% of DMV records contained a home address out of the
state of issue).
The University of Vermont Committee on Human Subjects and the Colorado Multiple
Institutional Review Board considered the data exempt from institutional review.
GeoMed
GeoMed is a web-based survey that recruited adults via social media and e-mail in 2014 and
2015. Respondents provided their height, weight, age, gender, race, education, physical activity
level, general health, and home address. We used the same method of determining the county
of each address as described for the DMV data above. Of 3,191 US residents who completed the
survey at the time of analysis (data collection is ongoing at
https://redcap.uvm.edu/redcap/surveys/index.php?s=AgCWxtoyMX), 42 were under age 18, and
137 had incomplete data, leaving 3,012 subjects representing 587 counties from 48 states and
the District of Columbia for analysis.
The survey was approved by the University of Vermont Committee on Human Subjects.
Vermont Diabetes Information System (VDIS)
The Vermont Diabetes Information System (VDIS) was a cluster-randomized trial of a decision
support system in community primary care practices [12]. Study participants were patients
receiving care for diabetes from 64 primary care practices in Vermont and adjacent Northern
New York. Patients under 18 years, receiving their diabetes care from specialists, or with
significant cognitive impairment per the judgment of the primary care provider, were excluded.
2015 Littenberg et al. Cureus 7(11): e377. DOI 10.7759/cureus.377 3 of 13
The 7,412 VDIS subjects were contacted by telephone in random order until a sample of
approximately 15% of the subjects from each practice agreed to participate in an in-person
interview, including measurement of height using a portable stadiometer (SECA GmbH,
Hamburg, Germany) and weight using a portable scale (Health O Meter LB Dial Scale
HAP200KD-41, SunBeam, Inc., Purvis, MS). One thousand and two interviews took place
between July 2003 and March 2005 [13]. Twenty-eight were missing data elements, leaving 974
analyzable subjects from 19 counties in Vermont, New York, New Hampshire, and
Massachusetts.
The study was approved by the University of Vermont Committee on Human Subjects #14-207.
Analytic approach
We calculated the body mass index (BMI) for each subject as their weight in kilograms divided
by their height in meters squared. Values of 30 kg/m2 or higher were classified as obese. We
explored the relationship between the ERS Natural Amenity Scale and obesity graphically by
constructing a non-parametric locally-weighted smoothing scatterplot (LOWESS) curve [14].
LOWESS curves do not require the a priori specification of a functional form, allowing them to
serve as graphical descriptors of two-dimensional relationships. Because LOWESS is
computationally intense, we applied it to a subset of the data consisting of 100,000 randomly
selected DMV records. All other analyses used all available records.
We used logistic regression to assess the relationship between the amenity scale and obesity
(coded as 1 for obese subjects and 0 for non-obese subjects) while controlling for potentially
confounding covariates. Individual-level covariates included age, gender, and year of data
collection (to control for secular trends in BMI). County-level covariates included latitude and
longitude (to control for regional variations in obesity), various social and economic
characteristics of the community (median age, percent of residents in each of seven categories
of race and ethnicity, unemployment rate, per capita income), and markers of development
(housing density and population density).
We created a logistic model, including all the potential confounders using the DMV data. We
eliminated potential confounders in a backward stepwise fashion starting with the highest P-
value until all remaining predictors were associated with obesity with P<0.05. We then built
three separate logistic models for each of the three data sources using the variables that were
retained in the reduced model. In this way, all three models were comparable in terms of
covariates. We adjusted all regressions for clustering of individual subjects within counties
using the robust "sandwich estimator" method [15]. We calculated 95% confidence intervals (CI)
for each parameter and considered a two-tailed P<0.05 as evidence of statistical significance.
Results
The prevalence of obesity was 22% among the 38,155,060 individuals in the DMV data, 21% in
the GeoMed online survey, and 67% among the diabetic patients from the VDIS (Table 1). The
VDIS population was also older and came from counties that had less racial diversity, lower
personal incomes, and much lower population and housing densities than the other sources.
The GeoMed respondents were younger, but otherwise generally similar to the DMV data. The
VDIS data also had lower Natural Amenity Scores. In fact, none of the VDIS participants lived in
counties with scores above the mean of either of the other two groups. The distribution of land
types is quite different across the three sources with most of the DMV and GeoMed data coming
from the plains with the majority of VDIS data coming from highland regions.

Obesity in the DMV data was associated with amenities in the LOWESS analysis. The
prevalence of obesity was above 20% among subjects living in counties with ERS Natural
Amenities Scale scores below 3 and below 10% where scores were above 7 (Figure 1).

Scale was associated with obesity with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.96 per point (95% CI = 0.95, 0.98;
P < 0.001) (Table 2). After stepwise reduction, the reduced model included subject age and year
of measurement as well as county-level latitude, median age, unemployment rate, and median
income as covariates. Obesity remained significantly associated with the ERS Natural Amenity
Scale (OR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.96, 0.98; P < 0.001). Given a baseline prevalence of obesity of 22%,
a one point difference in the Natural Amenity Scale is associated with a 0.6% change in the
prevalence of obesity (Consider that Champaign in Central Illinois scores -4.5, Odessa, TX
scores +2.5, Seattle, WA +4.5, and Clallam County, Washington on the Olympic Peninsula
scores +6.5). Older subjects, residents of more southern counties and residents of counties with
older median ages and higher unemployment had higher rates of obesity. Residents of counties
with higher income had lower rates of obesity.

To assess the possibility of long-term secular changes not captured by including the year of
measurement in the model, we divided the data into five subsets based on the decade of
measurement (1966-1975, 1976-1985, etc.) and applied the same reduced model to each subset.
There was very little change in the adjusted OR on Natural Amenity Scale with values ranging
from 0.96 to 0.98.
In the separate analyses, the subjects from the DMV data and the GeoMed survey had very
similar results while the model based on the VDIS was somewhat different. Each of the ORs in
the GeoMed data were similar to those in the DMV model in direction and magnitude, except
that year of data collection county-level per capita personal income were no longer
significantly associated with obesity. The VDIS model had notably different odds ratios on each
of the predictors, including a change in direction for the effect of subject age, year of data
collection, latitude, unemployment rate, and personal income (Tables 3-4).

Discussion
Major findings
The natural environment, including climate and topography, is associated with obesity across a
broad range of populations and landscapes in America. The relationships seen here among
licensed drivers, holders of non-driving identity cards, respondents to a web-based survey, and
patients with diabetes are similar to those shown using the data collected by random-digit
telephone surveys [8-9, 16].
The multivariate analysis controlled for age, sex, temporal trends, county geographic position,
demographics, economics, and degree of development, indicating that these factors are not
confounding the relationship between natural amenities and obesity. Although the three data
sources include quite different groups of subjects, they all show the same basic relationship of a
lower prevalence of obesity at higher levels of natural amenities.
The differences among the three models warrant some discussion. The GeoMed survey and
VDIS each had limited ranges of survey years, explaining why the year of data collection is not
significant in those two models. Otherwise, the model based on the GeoMed survey is quite
similar to that derived from the DMV data, except for differences that may be explained by the
much smaller sample size. The VDIS survey, on the other hand, shows a much stronger
association with the Natural Amenity Scale and different directions for most of the covariates.
We attribute the differences in the models to the very different nature of the population. They
were all chronically ill with a disease that is often caused by obesity and that may limit physical
activity if the patient develops complications, such as painful neuropathy of the feet or heart
disease. The VDIS was conducted in a relatively restricted geographic region of just 19
contiguous counties, nearly all of which are extremely rural. In spite of these factors, which
2015 Littenberg et al. Cureus 7(11): e377. DOI 10.7759/cureus.377 10 of 13
might tend to limit the effect of the environment on caloric expenditure, natural amenities
appear protective in this population as well.
Implications
Although these data cannot conclusively demonstrate causality, one possible mechanism for
the role of the natural environment on obesity includes promotion of a healthier lifestyle
through outdoor recreation. Other aspects of lifestyle, such as access to commercially-prepared
calorie-dense foods and engagement in more physically demanding occupations, are also
possible.
Analyses of individual correlates of health status can help to inform prescription for personal
health. In other words, some people may choose to move to locations with amenities in the
hope that it will have health benefits. Likewise, analyses of the built environment can guide
public policy about urban form, building codes, and development patterns. However, the
environment characteristic included in the Natural Amenities Scale generally cannot be
modified to suit human needs. Nonetheless, the insights from analyses of natural correlates to
health can be useful. First, they lead us to explore the particular aspects of the environment
that are likely to be causative and help explain the mechanisms of health and disease. For
instance, must one live full-time in a high amenity area, or will periodic visits confer some of
the benefits? Second, they may inform personal decisions about where and how to live. Third,
employers seeking to recruit and support a healthy workforce may consider these factors in
choosing where to site facilities. Finally, these analyses may influence public debate about
where to encourage residential development, how to allocate public lands, how to conserve
natural ecosystem services, the routing of highways and ecological/biodiversity corridors, and
other health and housing policy issues.
Limitations
As with all non-randomized data, the possibility of confounding by unmeasured factors limits
our ability to discern causality. In addition, these data cannot eliminate selection bias in which
thinner, healthier people preferentially migrate to areas with greater natural amenities,
perhaps to take advantage of outdoor recreation. Likewise, heavier people with more health
problems may migrate to areas with lower amenities for medical care. However, the negative
association of natural amenities with obesity persists while controlling for recreational
facilities [9]. Sampling bias is a possibility, although the broad use of driver's licenses by adults,
plus the inclusion of non-driver identity cards, suggests a very generalizable sample of adults in
the seven states in the DMV data.
Although heights and weights were measured in the VDIS data, they depend on self-report in
the other data sets. It is highly likely that these data underestimate the prevalence of obesity as
there is a systematic tendency for people to underestimate their own weight and overestimate
their own height [17-18]. However, there is little reason to believe that this error is associated
with natural amenities, meaning that it is unlikely to be influencing estimates of the
association between amenities and obesity.
The ERS Natural Amenities Scale was developed primarily to study rural migration patterns and
economic development and is well-suited to that purpose [7]. However, it includes only a
subset of the natural environment factors that might influence obesity and includes no
characterization of the built environment. Nonetheless, it is a robust predictor of obesity in this
and other analyses, indicating that climate and topography are important correlates of obesity.
This analysis is limited to adults. Although much of the American landscape is represented, the
data are not uniformly distributed across the country in all three data sets. Because the Natural

Amenity Scale is not available for Hawaii and Alaska, they were not included in any of the
analyses. Generalizability to children or other regions of the world is very uncertain.
The county-level covariates, including the Natural Amenities Scale, were collected in the mid-
2000s, but the individual data were collected over a greater period of time. Natural amenities
generally change very little over time, but changes in social and economic characteristics do,
possibly adding error. However, we saw no major changes in the estimates of the relationship
of natural amenities to obesity in the sub-analyses by decade.
Obesity as a complex phenomenon with contributions from diet, activity, genetics, and a
multitude of other factors. Rather than provide a comprehensive analysis of all the causes of
obesity, the logistic models were designed to examine the effects of potential confounders on
the relationship between the ERS Natural Amenities Scale and obesity. The strength of
association of the potential confounders (age, sex, census characteristics, etc.) to obesity was
not of primary interest. Likewise, because they include only a few of the potential causative
factors, the logistic regression models account for only a small proportion of the variance in
subject-to-subject obesity, as reflected by low values for R2.
Conclusions
This is the largest analysis to date of the relationship of natural environmental factors to
obesity. The very large and generalizable sample and the robustness of the main effects across
various subgroups support the conclusion that residing in areas with access to natural
amenities, such as open water and a variety of topographic features as well as cool, dry
summers and warm, sunny winters, is associated with lower rates of obesity.
