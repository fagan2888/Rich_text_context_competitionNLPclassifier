Length of Stay and Inpatient Costs Under
Medicaid Managed Care in Florida
Jungwon Park, PhD1
Abstract
This study examines the patterns of length of stay (LOS) and inpatient costs for both Medicaid managed care and nonmanaged
care patients using data from Medicaid patients aged 18 to 64 years who were discharged from hospitals in Florida between
2006 and 2012. This study used pooled cross-sectional multilevel modeling. The results show that the type of Medicaid
program in which patients were enrolled was significantly related to the hospital LOS and inpatient costs. Medicaid managed
care patients had 7% shorter LOSs and a 1.9% lower inpatient cost than did Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) patients. Medicaid
managed care patients had shorter LOSs in the Medicaid managed care market with high competition. High managed care
penetration generates a cost-decreasing spillover to Medicaid FFS patients.

Original Research
Introduction
Several scholars have paid attention to the differences in
lengths of stay (LOSs) and inpatient costs of patients who are
insured under managed care or nonmanaged care plans.
However, the results of previous studies were inconsistent.1-5
Despite the growing interest in Medicaid managed care in
Florida, only a few studies have examined the impact of the
managed care program on LOS and inpatient costs for
Florida's Medicaid enrollees.6,7 Furthermore, the literature
on the impact of Medicaid managed care in the context of
different market structures is scarce.8 It is still unclear
whether and how market-level factors affect LOS and inpa-
tient costs for Medicaid beneficiaries. Furthermore, to my
understanding, multilevel modeling has not been applied
much in health care studies.
Therefore, this study attempts to fill the gap in the previous
literature in 3 ways: First, this study analyzes Medicaid man-
aged care program in Florida. Second, this study analyzes how
the market competition and competitive influence of Medicaid
managed care penetration differently affect LOS and inpa-
tient costs between Medicaid managed care and Medicaid
fee-for-service (FFS) patients. Third, using hierarchical linear
modeling (HLM), this study provides more precision in esti-
mating the effects of Medicaid managed care plans and market
structure variables on LOS and inpatient costs.
Methods
This study addresses the following research questions:
Research Question 1: Do Medicaid patients in managed
care have a shorter LOS and lower inpatient costs than do
patients in Medicaid FFS?
Research Question 2: Do Medicaid managed care
patients have much shorter LOS and lower inpatient costs
as the competition of Medicaid managed care organiza-
tions (MCOs) and Medicaid managed care penetration
increases?
Research Question 3: Does Medicaid managed care pen-
etration affect LOS and inpatient costs for Medicaid FFS
patients?
The databases consisted of the following files: (1) the
Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA)
hospital inpatient discharge data file, (2) the Florida
Medicaid managed care enrollment report, (3) the hospital
Medicare cost report from the Center for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS), (4) the CMS inpatient prospec-
tive payment system impact file, (5) the Florida Statistical
Abstract, and (6) the Urban Influence Code from the US
Department of Agriculture.

2 INQUIRY
The study population was comprised of all Medicaid
patients aged 18 to 64 years who were discharged from short-
term general hospitals in Florida from January 1, 2006, to
December 31, 2012. The total study population at the patient
level was 1957072 over all periods. The number of patients
observed in the population varied across analysis models
because of different missing patterns and sample extraction
strategies. Then, the size of the sample was 684267 patients
in the LOS model and 1
368
146 patients in the inpatient
costs model. This study examined 902 short-term general
hospitals between 2006 and 2012. The panel data of the hos-
pitals were unbalanced. For example, this study included 148
hospitals in 2006, but 137 hospitals were included in the
analyses in 2012. This was because of missing data from
Medicare Cost Reports, hospital closings, and mergers over
the study period.
The 2 dependent variables used were LOS and total inpa-
tient costs. A hospital-specific cost-to-charge ratio was used
to convert total inpatient charges to costs by multiplying the
ratio by each patient charge. Total inpatient costs were
adjusted for inflation to 2010 dollars. This study included
the insurance type of the Medicaid patients as a main inde-
pendent variable. The insurance type of the Medicaid
patients was a dichotomous variable (1 = Medicaid man-
aged care, 0 = Medicaid FFS). At the patient level, the study
controlled patients' demographic characteristics, such as
gender, race, and age. Also, the total number of secondary
diagnosis (TOD) and diagnosis-related group (DRG) weight
were controlled.
At the hospital level, this study included the level of hospi-
tal competition. After the mid-1980s, empirical studies
reported that increased hospital competition leads to lowered
hospital costs and prices.9-12 Unlike previous studies that
adopted a largely arbitrary definition of the hospital market
based on geopolitical units or fixed distance, this study identi-
fied a service-specific market for each hospital.11 To calculate
hospital competition, this study followed the two-step calcula-
tion by Zwanziger and Melnick11 and provided the Herfindahl-
Hirschman Index (HHI) for individual hospitals. To measure
HHI for each hospital, the first step was to calculate HHI for
each ZIP code area in the state during each year period. Then
this study determined the weighted average of the HHIs of
each ZIP code from which a hospital received patients. A
higher HHI value indicated a highly concentrated market.
This study also controlled hospitals' organizational char-
acteristics, such as ownership, teaching status, total number
of beds, and average bed occupancy rates. In addition, this
study adjusted analytical models for a labor market's area
wage index value, hospitals' Medicaid patient volumes, and
case-mix indices (CMIs). Different CMIs by payer indicated
different reimbursement levels among payers. For example,
a higher reimbursement rate (ie, high CMI) from private
insurers makes Medicaid patients less attractive to hospitals.
To capture the different reimbursement rates between com-
mercial insurers and Medicaid, we calculated the difference
in payer-specific CMIs between 2 payers by subtracting
Medicaid CMI from private insurer CMI.
At the county level, the study used 2 measures of Medicaid
managed care market structure: Medicaid managed care pen-
etration rates and the HHI of Medicaid MCOs. The HHI of
Medicaid MCOs took into account the different market
shares of each firm competing in the county. The HHI was
calculated by summing the square of each Medicaid MCO's
market share. Other county-level control variables included
rurality, total number of Medicaid recipients, and total num-
ber of Medicaid admissions.
All models involved hierarchical data structures, and
study data were pooled cross-sectional data over time. To
find appropriate estimation approaches for each dependent
variable, dependent variables were examined as a first step.
First, hospital LOS was measured in days, and it was posi-
tively skewed, so linear modeling was not appropriate
because the residual errors did not follow a normal distribu-
tion. This study used Poisson regression to analyze LOS.
Second, as inpatient cost was a nonnegative dependent vari-
able skewed by rare but extreme high-cost cases, the HLM
model for inpatient costs in raw scale violated the assump-
tion of normality. Thus, this study transformed the total inpa-
tient costs by the logarithm function.
This study applied 2-level (ie, patient-hospital) hierarchi-
cal models to estimate dependent variables. Due to low aver-
age cluster size at level 3 (ie, county) and small variance
between level 3 units, this study used 2-level hierarchical
models. Therefore, the county-level variables were disaggre-
gated to the hospital level. All statistical analyses were con-
ducted at a set a priori level of significance (.05).
Results
Table 1 provides the descriptive statistics for the variables
used in the analyses over all cross-sections and periods. The
average LOS for Medicaid patients was 4.7 days. The aver-
age cost of inpatient care was US$7036.
Medicaid patients in the sample had a mean age of 37.
There was unbalanced gender distribution in the sample. The
largest proportion of patients were in traditional Medicaid
FFS, and black patients accounted for 30% of all Medicaid
inpatient discharges. The average Medicaid patients had 4.6
secondary diagnoses. On average, Medicaid patients were
hospitalized with a DRG weight of 1.08.
At level 2, there were 902 hospital-year observations
from 2006 to 2012. The HHI ranged between 0.20 and 0.76
for hospitals. Of the 902 observations, the most common
form of ownership was private for-profit hospitals, followed
by private nonprofit hospitals and public hospitals. One
fourth of the hospitals were teaching hospitals. Hospitals had
an average of 262 beds and an average bed occupancy rate of
59%. On average, Medicaid patients accounted for 7.4% of
total hospital discharges. The average hospital's CMI was
equal to 1.46. The mean difference in payer-specific CMI
Park 3
between commercial payers and Medicaid was 0.17, indicat-
ing that hospitals received more reimbursement from com-
mercial insurers than from Medicaid. For characteristics of
the counties where the hospitals were located, Medicaid
managed care penetration rates ranged from a low of 36% to
a high of 76%, with an average of 66%. The HHI of counties
ranged between 0.14 and 1.00 for Medicaid MCOs. Only 3%
of hospitals were located in rural areas.
Table 2 shows statistically significant fixed effects of
level 1 predictors on the expected log of LOS. On average,
each predictor was significantly related to the expected LOS
across hospitals. The results show that Medicaid managed
care was associated with shorter LOS. In Model 1, the inci-
dence rate ratio (IRR) value for Medicaid MCO patients was
about 0.93, which means Medicaid MCO patients had nearly
7% shorter LOS than did Medicaid FFS patients.
There was a strong association between hospital competi-
tion and LOS. As HHI is a measure of concentration,
Medicaid patients had longer LOS in hospitals with large
market shares. However, the study found neither a signifi-
cant effect of Medicaid managed care penetration nor a sig-
nificant effect of the HHI of Medicaid MCO patients on
hospital LOS.
With regard to other characteristics of hospitals, the study
found that government hospital status, number of hospital
beds, inpatient bed occupancy rates in hospital, wage index,
and CMI difference were statistically significant at the .05
level. In sum, level 2 predictors explained 40.7% of the
parameter variation in intercept.
Model 2 in Table 1 presents cross-level interactions
effects in multilevel modeling. The effect of Medicaid man-
aged care on hospital LOS was moderated by market struc-
ture variables. Figure 1 shows that the LOS of Medicaid
MCO patients was significantly associated with the level of
Medicaid managed penetration, whereas the LOS of
Medicaid FFS patients remained unaffected by managed

care penetration. Thus, high Medicaid managed care pene-
tration was not associated with shorter LOS in hospitals for
Medicaid FFS patients. Regarding the HHI of Medicaid
MCOs, there was an interaction between payer groups and
MCO_HHI. Under a competitive market, Medicaid MCO
patients had much shorter LOS than did Medicaid FFS
patients, but the difference became smaller under a concen-
trated market (see Figure 1b). Last, hospital competition did
not affect Medicaid MCO patients differently than it did for
Medicaid FFS patients.
Table 3 presents the models of hospital inpatient costs.
The study found statistically significant fixed effects of level
1 variables, except for BLACK, on hospital inpatient costs.
The results show that Medicaid managed care is associated
with lower inpatient costs of care. In Model 3, the coefficient
for Medicaid managed care patients was -0.019. As the
dependent variable was log transformed, being a Medicaid
managed care patient changed inpatient costs by -1.88 while
all other variables were held constant.13
In Table 3, the Medicaid managed care penetration rate was
not significantly associated with hospital inpatient costs for
Medicaid patients. Also, the HHI of Medicaid MCO had an
insignificant effect on the costs of inpatient care. With regard
to hospital concentration, there was a significant negative asso-
ciation between hospital concentration and hospital inpatient
costs. Thus, increasing competition in the hospital markets
increased the hospital inpatient costs for Medicaid patients.

found that all level 2 predictors except for MMC_PCT,
MCO_HHI, and RURAL were significant. The results show
that both nonprofit and government hospitals were positively
correlated with higher Medicaid inpatient costs, compared

with for-profit hospitals. Also, the number of hospital beds,
wage index, CMI, and percentages of Medicaid discharges
were positively associated with average inpatient costs.
However, teaching hospital status, high levels of bed occu-
pancy, and a relatively commercial insurer-specific CMI
(than Medicaid-specific CMI) were associated with decreased
Medicaid inpatient costs. In sum, level 2 predictors explained
26.2% of the parameter variation in the intercept.
Model 4 shows that only 1 cross-level interaction (ie,
MMC × MMC_PCT) was statistically significant. In Figure
2, Medicaid MCO and Medicaid FFS patients had slopes of
opposing directions, and 2 slope lines intersected. Figure 2
shows that Medicaid inpatient costs for FFS patients signifi-
cantly decreased as Medicaid managed care penetration
increased. This result demonstrated the spillover effects of
Medicaid managed care on other patients enrolled in
Medicaid FFS.
Discussion
This study attempted to examine how Medicaid managed
care enrollment was related to hospital LOS and inpatient

costs. There was a fairly large variation in LOS and inpa-
tient costs across hospitals. The presence of these large vari-
ations between groups justified the use of HLM to improve
precision (ie, unbiased stand errors) by estimating shared
variance.
The type of Medicaid program in which patients were
enrolled was significantly related to hospital LOS and inpa-
tient costs. The study found that Medicaid managed care
patients were more likely to have shorter LOS and lower
inpatient costs compared with FFS Medicaid patients.
Specifically, Medicaid managed care patients had 7% shorter
LOS and a 1.9% lower inpatient cost than did their FFS
counterparts. A Medicaid managed care program appears to
have had a negligible effect on hospitalization costs for each
individual patient, but we need to look at the aggregate
effects of cost saving. In 2014, Florida spent a total of US$23
billion to cover its Medicaid program; thus, the aggregate
amount of cost reduction is not negligible. The result is con-
sistent with findings from previous studies.14,15 De Jong
et al15 explained that health maintenance organizations'
(HMOs) utilization management strategies and financial
incentives for physicians significantly influences physicians'
LOS decisions. In addition, there is less variation in LOS for
managed care patients because physicians face similar con-
straints and incentives from HMO insurance.15 Following the
methodology of De Jong et al,15 this study examined some
DRGs that were frequent among Medicaid patients in terms
of mean and variation differences between Medicaid

Medicaid patients. Medicaid managed care patients also had
lower inpatient costs for two obstetrics DRGs (ie, cesarean
section with complication and without complication), and
their variances in costs were smaller than those of Medicaid
FFS patients. In sum, this study demonstrates that Medicaid
managed care constrains physicians' behavior, which in turn
reduces LOS and inpatient costs.
Examining the Medicaid managed care and interaction
term market structure (ie, MCO_HHI and MMC_PCT) and
Medicaid managed care, it can be seen that Medicaid man-
aged care patients had shorter LOS in high Medicaid MCO
competition markets than in low Medicaid MCO competi-
tion markets. When competing for Medicaid managed care
contracts, Medicaid MCOs have financial incentives and use
management strategies to lower costs by reducing utilization
levels of hospital inpatient care. MCOs reduce inpatient uti-
lization by "using fewer resources once a customer is admit-
ted."16 Furthermore, hospitals can lower costs and increase
profit margins by reducing LOS after the adoption of pro-
spective payment systems.11 Medicaid managed care pene-
tration also moderated the relationship between Medicaid
managed care and LOS. Medicaid MCO patients admitted in
hospitals with high Medicaid managed care penetration had
shorter LOS than did patients in low penetration markets.
The results demonstrate that Medicaid MCOs had more
market power on utilization of hospital service in an area
with high penetration. Greater market power can lead to an
enhanced bargaining position of MCOs over hospitals,
allowing them to extract steep price discounts from hospitals
and physicians.17 As a result, health care providers change
their practice patterns and decrease LOS for Medicaid man-
aged care patients
The findings from this study supported the existence of a
spillover effect of Medicaid managed care on the hospital
inpatient costs for Medicaid FFS patients. Greater Medicaid
managed care penetration was associated with lower inpa-
tient costs for Medicaid FFS patients, as shown in Figure 2.
The spillover effects of managed care penetration may be
due to changing physician behavior and practice patterns
through increased activity of managed care.18 A previous
study suggests that health care providers are more likely to
pay attention to cost-effective procedures in a highly man-
aged care penetration area.17 Physicians may decide to forgo
costly procedures and tests under the contracts with managed
care plans, and these changes in physician behavior and
practice patterns may influence the care of patients in non-
managed care plans. As a result, highly managed care pene-
tration generates a cost-decreasing spillover to FFS patients.
However, the results should be interpreted with caution, as
they may be attributable to the fact that more high-cost/high-
risk FFS patients move into managed care programs. This
selection bias can be associated with changes in inpatient
costs of Medicaid FFS patients when Medicaid managed

care penetration increases. Likewise, increasing costs for
patients covered by managed care Medicaid can be attributed
to selection effects.
This study has some limitations that have to be pointed
out. First, we cannot generalize the results of study to other
states, which have different market conditions and man-
aged care policies. Second, the study used hospital inpa-
tient discharge data as its primary source of patient data.
The use of administrative data for research has limitations
because those data are restricted in scope and do not include
broader information on patients. Hospital inpatient dis-
charge data do not include patients' socioeconomic sta-
tuses, detailed patient health information, or patterns of
health service use that could influence dependent variables.
Future studies might consider including these control vari-
ables at the patient level.
