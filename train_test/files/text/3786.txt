The Institute of Medicine defines health disparities as "racial
or ethnic differences in the quality of health care that are not
due to access-related factors or clinical needs, preferences,
and appropriateness of intervention" (Smedley, Stith, &
Nelson, 2003). In this case, discrimination at the individual
patient­provider level is thought to manifest as differences in
care resulting from biases, prejudices, and stereotyping in
clinical communication and decision making.
There is evidence that patients who perceive racial dis-
crimination are more likely to report adverse health out-
comes. Previous work has found that minority adults who
report ever experiencing discrimination, being prevented
from doing something, being hassled, or made to feel inferior
in various situations have greater physical and psychiatric
symptoms than their counterparts who did not report this
experience (Borrell, Kiefe, Williams, Diez-Roux, & Gordon-
Larsen, 2006). In addition, individuals who report experienc-
ing discrimination at any time during their lifetime have been
found to have poor adherence to treatment, worse health out-
comes, and delays in seeking medical care (Casagrande,
Gary, LaVeist, Gaskin, & Cooper, 2007).
The work of Dr. David Williams (2012) and others has
continued to demonstrate a clear relationship between
minority race and poorer health outcomes. Racial inequities
and disparities are evident in the timing of disease onset
(earlier for minorities), severity and progression of disease
(more severe for minorities), the effects of some risk factors
(less exposure to the risk factor has a greater impact on
minorities), and the persistence of health disparities over
time (resulting in a lower life expectancy for minorities vs.
non-minorities).

Abstract
Adolescents, like adults, frequently experience discrimination, which can be particularly salient in the context of reproductive
health care. We examined urban Black adolescent females' perceived experiences of racial discrimination during reproductive
health care encounters. Structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with female African American patients, from age
13 through 20, who obtained reproductive health care services at a single site. Twenty-four participants were enrolled. All
were in or graduated from high school, with a mean age of 16.8 years. These young Black women reported infrequent race-
based discrimination in the health care setting; however, many reported commonly experiencing discrimination in other
places. An awareness of the discrimination that minority young women experience in non­health care settings can help
providers demonstrate cultural humility when addressing such concerns with their patients. With this information, providers
can provide anticipatory guidance and the tools necessary to navigate complex social systems.

associated with poorer psychological functioning as measured
by perceived stress, depressive symptomatology, and psycho-
logical well-being (Sellers et al., 2006).
While previous work has provided valuable insight into
adolescents' general experiences with discrimination, little
has focused on this population's health care system encoun-
ters, which are often in the context of reproductive health or
family planning care (Ma, Wang, & Stafford, 2005). Given
the sensitive nature of care that is provided in these settings,
reproductive care encounters can be prone to discriminatory
practices based on imposed stereotypes or judgments about
patients, such as what was described by theAfricanAmerican
women in Benkert and Peters's (2005) study who reported
experiencing race-based discrimination when seeking family
planning care. For example, provider beliefs about the num-
ber of sexual partners, history of sexually transmitted infec-
tions (STIs), or contraceptive use may differ depending on
the race of the patient. Thorburn and Bogart (2005) found
that among African American women ages 15 to 44 who had
received family planning services, the majority (67%)
reported having experienced race-based discrimination.
Among those 15 to 20 years of age, there was a greater asso-
ciation with stereotype-related discrimination. In addition,
having a stronger Black identity was correlated with a greater
perception of general health care discrimination.
Jo Valentine (2008) provided an overview of barriers to
the diagnosis and treatment of STIs and the relationship to
the heavy STI disease burden in the Black community.
Constructs such as stigma, shame, and mistrust, as well as
the historical legacy in which these constructs are rooted and
their contribution to the negative perceptions of Black sexu-
ality were explored and evaluated.
It is imperative that as few obstacles as possible exist
when adolescents are seeking reproductive care because they
comprise a population at risk of suffering great health-related
consequences. Notably, young African American women
suffer disproportionately from reproductive morbidity, high-
lighting the need for health care providers to recognize barri-
ers that impede this population from seeking reproductive
health care (Augustine, 2010; Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention [CDC], 2012; Kost & Henshaw, 2013; Tuan,
2006). This disparity underscores the importance of health
care providers' understanding the barriers to care, including
those related to discrimination, which may prevent this
cohort from obtaining reproductive or other health care
services.
Discrimination results from processes of social inequity
in which there is an imbalance of power and control, and a
devaluation, stigmatization, and rejection of a group of peo-
ple who possess specific attributes. There are varying
responses to the experience of rejection, prompting a need to
consider contextual, relational, and dispositional factors
(Smart Richman & Leary, 2009). Patients who have negative
perceptions of health care encounters, possess limited coping
skills, and have inconsistent health care follow-up may have
significant health-related consequences. There is an under-
mining of the therapeutic relationship and a lack of patient
empowerment that can occur if a young person perceives dis-
crimination from a clinician. The diagram in Figure 1 repre-
sents the cycle that can occur when patients interact with
providers whom they perceive as discriminatory and the
resultant avoidance of potential distress or discomfort at
future encounters, followed by the negative impact on health
outcomes if care is not sought in a timely fashion. When
Slaughter-Acey, Caldwell, and Misra (2013) examined the
relationship between prenatal care entry and experiences of
personal and group racism among low-income, African
American women, they concluded that a delay in accessing
prenatal care may be grounded in an attempt to avoid a dis-
criminatory experience. Using this context as a conceptual
framework upon which this study is based, the objective was
to use qualitative techniques to examine young Black wom-
en's perceptions of racial discrimination during reproductive
health care encounters and in non­health care settings.
Method
Study Design
We conducted in-depth, semi-structured, face-to-face inter-
views with adolescent females, age 13 to 21 years, seeking
care at an urban family planning clinic, serving predomi-
nantly African American females, between June and
December of 2008. Study protocol and consent procedures
were approved by the hospital's institutional review board
and the regional Family Planning Council. Adolescent
women who met the study eligibility criteria provided writ-
ten informed consent. Parental consent was waived given
that participants were obtaining confidential reproductive
health care.
Participants
Eligible participants met the following criteria: (a) female and
having received reproductive health care at the recruitment
site, (b) 13 to 21 years of age, (c) able to speak and write in
English, and (d) self-identified as Black or African American.
Exclusion criteria included the following: (a) having dis-
cussed transition to an adult provider because of age during
the last clinic visit (indicating the young woman would
receive health care elsewhere in the future); (b) being preg-
nant, as confirmed prior to the visit and/or on the day of the
interview; and (c) having cognitive impairment that prevented
participation in ongoing dialogue or written feedback.
Participants were recruited through direct contact with a
trained research assistant (RA) at the clinic or through
recruitment flyers. The RA approached young women fol-
lowing their reproductive health care encounters with medi-
cal providers, and invited them to participate in a research
study to discuss their beliefs about race and health care.
Lewis et al. 3
Participants were also recruited through recruitment flyers
that were posted in the clinic with general information about
the study and contact details. After screening and eligibility
for participation were confirmed, a convenient time was
arranged for the participant to return for the face-to-face
interview. Informed written consent was obtained before the
interview.
Data Collection
Participants were interviewed in a private exam room by a
trained interviewer--an African American female. A detailed
semi-structured interview guide was developed from a thorough
literature review about race and ethnic identity development as
well as research about minority populations'perceptions of ste-
reotypes and their impact on discriminatory behaviors (Sellers
et al., 2006). Each interview lasted for approximately 60 min,
until saturation of key themes was achieved.
The semi-structured interview enabled participants to tell
their "stories" about their experiences of discrimination,
either personally or vicariously (awareness of others' experi-
ences), in a variety of contexts. The participants were first
asked demographic questions to assess age; self-reported
ethnicity, skin color, educational level; personal work status;
parental educational level and work status; other sources of
household income; and health insurance status. The inter-
view guide included questions to elicit the participants' defi-
nition of discrimination and to assess their opinions about the
impact of skin color (light- vs. dark-skinned) on discrimina-
tion, the directionality of discrimination (i.e., within race vs.
out-of-race discrimination), the presence of discrimination in
the health care setting (both reproductive and general medi-
cal care), and its influence on the intention to return for med-
ical care, discrimination in non-medical settings, vicarious
discrimination, and degree of Black identity.
After their interviews, participants were asked to com-
plete a brief questionnaire in private to provide feedback
about their comfort level with the questions and the inter-
viewer. To ensure anonymity of feedback, participants were
instructed not to include identifying information on feedback
response sheets and to seal the form in a blank envelope. The
principal investigator (PI) reviewed the feedback, reporting
results in aggregate to the research team. Participants were
given a choice between two US$20 gift cards to one of two
local merchants as compensation for their time. The inter-
views were audio recorded and transcribed professionally.

4 SAGE Open
Interviewer training consisted of multiple meetings to
develop the interview guide, integrating feedback from
participant pilot data. An emergency medicine physician and
investigator with expertise in qualitative methodology over-
saw and guided the training process. The PI conducted three
pilot interviews in which only she, as the interviewer, was
videotaped (with the participant's authorization) to assist
with training on non-verbal cues and standardization of
interview technique. These videos were used to train the one
RA, who conducted the remainder of the interviews, the first
three of which were also videotaped (again, only she was
filmed). In addition, mock interviews were conducted among
the interviewers themselves to enhance their interview skills.
During the period of data collection, the PI and RA met
weekly to discuss the study's progress.
Data Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic
variables. Transcript text was entered into Microsoft Word
for organization and coding. A priori (conceived beforehand)
codes based on the interview guide were used to group and
label specific blocks of text and phrases from the interviews.
The first three interviews were coded by two members of the
research team to develop mutually agreed-upon definitions
for each code. These initial interviews were coded multiple
times by these same two reviewers to refine and clarify the
terms and definitions of the coding library; any disagree-
ments in coding were resolved by consensus. Each interview
was then coded separately by two reviewers on the study
team. These two reviewers discussed the coding results, and
discrepancies were resolved by consensus. The third reviewer
coded every third interview and provided supervision and
assistance in coming to consensus, if necessary. Notes of
coding decisions were kept to facilitate member communica-
tion and maintain coding consistency. Transcripts were then
reviewed by the study team to identify patterns of emergent
and recurrent themes. Theme development continued as an
iterative process, with review of transcripts as additional
interviews were ongoing, to assess when theme saturation
had been achieved.
Results
Interviews were conducted with 30 subjects. Three of these
were pilot interviews and were excluded from analysis.
Three additional participants were excluded because of
incomplete data due to audio recording failure (n = 2) or cog-
nitive delay that was not detected until the interview was ini-
tiated (n = 1; see Table 1).
Interview Themes
Table 2 provides additional illustrative quotes for each of the
themes described below.
Definition of discrimination. Most participants described peo-
ple who discriminate as those who dislike, look down upon,
or treat an individual or group differently for a variety of
reasons. Race, skin color, and ethnicity were reasons men-
tioned by the majority (n = 17, 71%); other reasons stated
were age, gender, sexual orientation, religion, and appear-
ance. Many participants also used terms such as "feeling
judged" and expressed that recipients of discrimination or
prejudice lacked a sense of being valued and were made to
feel unworthy by others. Specifically, discrimination was
associated with a quality that works "against you because of
the person you are," and "restriction," or having limited
opportunities. Discrimination was associated with disadvan-
tage for Blacks and advancement for Whites. Participants
also mentioned other specific discrimination dyads: older
persons against younger ones, and teachers against (Black)
students.
Experiences of racial discrimination in health care settings.Par-
ticipants reported that they infrequently experienced dis-
crimination in the health care setting. Regarding family
planning care, two participants reported past experiences in
which providers made assumptions about their sexual his-
tory. One young woman was encouraged by her male pro-
vider to begin a birth control method because her mother
assumed she was interested in becoming sexually active and
took her to the doctor for this purpose; she emphasized that
he did not confirm with her, as the patient, if birth control
was truly the reason she was there. Another young woman
perceived that her family planning provider assumed she was
sexually active, but she had come to the clinic only to learn
about birth control methods. In general health care encoun-
ters, one participant reported feeling as if she was treated
worse by a Black female physician (as compared with a non-
Black health care provider) when she brought her younger

sister for general pediatric care. She believed that the reason
for this differential treatment was that her sister was lighter
skinned and she and the provider were darker skinned, repre-
sentative of a viewpoint that individuals with lighter skin
receive better treatment than those with darker skin. The per-
ceived assumption that these young Black women were
seeking contraception when they were not may be grounded
in historical perspectives about the sexuality of Black
women. During times of slavery, Blacks were seen as the
property of slave owners; they were not viewed as human
and, therefore, were not entitled to rights befitting a human.
What accompanied these views was the inhumane treatment
of slaves as evidenced by the commission of horrific acts of
violence toward them, one of which was the rape of Black
women. Black female slaves were seen as objects of sexual
exploitation for White men. Women had no right to resist
their slave owners' advances; compliance with the owners'
quest for sexual gratification was not only commonplace, but
expected (Collins, 2005). Furthermore, because Blacks had
no rights, this was not seen as a criminal act. Jezebel, a term
used to justify the sexual relations between White men and
Black women, emerged during slavery times and depicts a
Black woman with an overwhelming need and strong drive
for sex that could only be satiated by a White man, endorsing
the perspective that interracial sex was, in fact, desired by
Black women (Collins, 2005; Valentine, 2008). This perpetu-
ated the belief that Black women of that era were uncivilized
with unbridled sexual appetites, "naturally" promiscuous,
and therefore impure. Childbearing was an important aspect
of Black women's sexuality as great value was placed on
their fecundity given the desire of slave owners to sustain
and grow the slave workforce (Valentine, 2008).
There is evidence that young women perceive that the
"Jezebel perspective" of Black women as it relates to sexual-
ity, use of birth control, and pregnancy still exists. Some
young women described when they were solicited by White
men to participate in atypical sexual acts because these men
view Black women as "sexual freak[s]." Relating to preg-
nancy, one young woman shared, "To some people, I think,
when they see a Black girl, they automatically assume that I
got three or four kids or I am running around and all wild and
loud and--I am this off the wall . . . " These experiences and
perceptions may indicate that the belief that Black women
are hypersexual, promiscuous, or breeders still prevails
today.
Experiences of racial discrimination,non­health care related.Par-
ticipants reported experiencing discrimination in a variety of
settings, including the workplace, school, stores, and their
neighborhoods (see Table 3). Events at work and school were
particularly common, especially with regard to being hired
or maintaining employment and interactions with peers,
respectively. This was the case for one participant who heard
that a hiring manager where she submitted her application
told her non-Black friend "Every time a Black person comes
and fills out an application I throw it away."
Another frequently described event was racial profiling,
or being targeted by an individual purely on the basis of
racial or ethnic characteristics. The context in which these
events were most likely to occur was in stores (e.g., being
followed) and observations of or interactions with law
enforcement officials (e.g., harassment, use of unnecessary
force, being stopped in a vehicle without clear justification).
Interviewees described similar events that were experienced
by family members or friends, with the majority of witnessed
incidents involving police and Black males. Young women
described both emotional and action-based responses when
these events occurred. Anger, hurt, disgust, and discomfort
were among the emotional responses commonly reported.
Verbal expression of these feelings toward the perpetrator or

examples of actions taken in response to a discriminatory
event.
Stereotypes.Many of the participants reported that Blacks
are viewed negatively by non-Blacks. The young women
gave examples of feeling that Blacks are thought of as less
intelligent, being poor, having many children, living in vio-
lent areas, or participating in criminal acts. These ideas were
captured in quotes such as the following:
Because, like usually when people think about Black people, or
like their neighborhoods, they're like, "Oh, don't go down there
because you're going to get shot." Or they think of Black people,
they're like, "They're dirty" or "They're poor." "They're not
better than us." Like if a White person--like if you ask a White
person, like "What do you think when you hear the word, like
African American?" They'll probably say a whole bunch of
negative stuff. But I don't know.
In addition, a common sentiment shared by interviewees was
"acting Black or White." References made to these behaviors
were usually in the context of speech, or using colloquial
terms or slang specific to Blacks. For example, one partici-
pant spoke of being "bona fide ghetto" (ghetto being a
description of predominantly Black, low-resource areas in
some communities) as "loud, obnoxious, cussing all the
time" (cussing refers to swearing or use of profanity).
Alternatively, young women also described times when
Blacks or Whites told them they were "acting White" because
they participated in certain activities or spoke in a way that
was perceived as being associated with "Whiteness." One
young lady said, "I don't know what I want to be, I don't
know if I want to act White or if I want to act Black . . . White
people who don't know me, they may say I'm just a confused
soul."
The inverse was also noted when White friends or
acquaintances of some participants "acted Black" by speak-
ing a certain way or using specific terms only in the presence
of Black people. In spite of being part of these different cul-
tural realms, the participants made it clear that they knew
what behavior was appropriate at any given time. For exam-
ple, participants believed that slang could be used with
friends, but speaking in a professional tone and using proper
English is expected during an interview.
Ethnicity. There were commonalities among many of the par-
ticipants when describing the ways in which they identified
with their ethnic culture. Young women spoke not only about
the use of slang or a specific manner of dress but also the
styling of hair.
Some of the young women believed that the practices
demonstrating their membership in the Black culture were
perceived as having a negative impact on the way that they
were viewed or treated by non-Blacks and Blacks, alike. One
young woman mentioned that if she wore her hair in a "bush"
(afro hair style), she would be asked "[why] do you have

your hair like that? It looks dirty" whereas long, straight hair
is viewed as "beautiful." In general, these young women
illustrated that the ways in which they expressed their ethnic
culture through styles of hair, dress, or language were very
powerful, and their choices could either make others around
them--Black or White--feel comfortable in their presence,
or not.
Skin color. Many young women, regardless of self-reported
skin color, perceived that light-skinned Blacks are regarded
more positively and receive better treatment than those who
are dark-skinned, and that this differential treatment is prac-
ticed by both Blacks and Whites. This perception was evi-
denced by the following comments:
. . . if you're light-skinned you're better no matter if you're
dark-skinned or you're light-skinned but like better jobs if
you're light-skinned. Like, people will like you better or
you'll come-you'll come off better than people who are
dark-skinned.
. . . Light, like you have your-you're better, you're just
everything is just going to be given to you, like you're just better
than the next person.
Not only did they report this belief system being held
among members of general society but also prevailing among
members of their family in which lighter skinned individuals
were more highly valued or preferred over darker skinned
individuals. One exception to this "rule" is when light-
skinned Blacks think of themselves as "better than" others,
resulting in poorer treatment and exclusion from the domi-
nant Black group.
Most young women, regardless of their self-reported skin
color classification, believed that for them personally, their
skin color did not affect the way they were treated by others.
However, some young women who self-identified as dark-
skinned gave vivid accounts of hurtful personal experiences
relating to their skin color, which had a negative impact on
how they viewed themselves. An example of this was a quote
from a young lady who recounted childhood experiences of
bullying:
When I was younger I would get bullied and stuff, they used to
call me tar baby and all this other stuff . . . yeah it used to make
me cry and feel bad about myself, but now I don't pay no
attention to things like that.
Another young lady recounted, "And I didn't like being so
dark, like they be like `Blackie,' . . ."
Positive outlook on race relations.
Many young women
expressed that, although they are aware discrimination exists,
they do not believe there is a role for it in today's world and
do not endorse the idea that anyone should receive different
treatment on the basis of race or skin color. There is a
reassuring sense of tolerance and the embracement of diver-
sity. One young woman expressed,
Just do you, don't worry about nobody else, come together, be a
big family. I go and eat spaghetti and meatballs with my Italian
friends all the time. I eat at the Jamaican store all the time; I even
eat Jewish food. We do the same things. Cut it out, right . . . So
it's like be friends with everybody you know.
Discussion
The findings of this study indicate that young Black women
did not frequently perceive discrimination in the health care
setting, contrary to what other studies have reported. An
example of such a study is Benkert and Peters's (2005) work
in which they found that African American women reported
experiencing discrimination when seeking family planning
services.
It is for this reason that our finding of young women not
endorsing discrimination in a clinical setting warrants further
examination. To better understand why this may have been
the case in our clinic, it is necessary to first provide some
context by describing the racial composition of the personnel
who staffed the clinic as well as the patient population that
was served there. The majority of patients served at the clinic
were Black (the clinic is embedded in an urban community
that is predominately Black). In contrast, the staff repre-
sented a heterogeneous mix of both Black and White (in gen-
eral, there were more White than Black staff). The front-line
staff, such as receptionists and medical assistants, who made
initial contact with patients were Black; however, the nurses
and physicians were predominately White (with the excep-
tion of one Black physician). There were no cultural compe-
tence trainings provided to staff, but it is reasonable to
consider that with the clinic being located in a Black com-
munity, serving mostly Black youth, with Black front-line
staff, the non-Black staff may have had a heightened aware-
ness of issues related to cultural bias and would be more
likely to engage in self-monitoring of behaviors that may be
perceived as discriminatory. In addition, perhaps by first
interacting with Black reception staff and same-race peers in
the waiting room, patients' perceptions of the clinical
encounter with non-Black clinicians that followed were posi-
tively influenced (priming effect). Alternatively, it may be
that the presence of Blacks in the clinic enhanced comfort
levels among patients, enabling them to be more receptive to
care they received from non-Black clinicians.
Alternatively, the race or skin color of the medical pro-
vider may be one of many complex factors that a patient con-
siders when assessing the degree of discrimination
experienced during a health care encounter. Support for this
supposition comes from one participant who described feel-
ing as though she was discriminated against even though she
and the physician with whom she was interacting were the
same race and same darker hue. This suggests that the
8 SAGE Open
therapeutic bond goes beyond "skin deep" and may, in fact,
be more influenced by the perception of respect that the pro-
vider shows the patient. Previous studies examining what
Black youth value in their relationships with health care pro-
viders have shown that being respectful and non-judgmental,
as well as maintaining the confidentiality of their informa-
tion, is more important than sharing physical attributes or
characteristics with a provider (Ginsburg, Menapace, &
Slap, 1997; Ginsburg et al., 1995).
We did discover that discrimination, although not neces-
sarily perceived as being present in the clinic, is a common
element in the lives of these young Black women. The set-
tings in which they are most likely to spend their time are the
places that they reported having negative experiences of
race-based discrimination: school, the workplace, stores,
their neighborhoods, recreational venues, and their own
homes. The perpetrators of these incidents are individuals
from the same race, as well as those from different racial
backgrounds. The events may be subtle, such as an askance
glance, or overt, such as a directed racial slur or epithet.
Incidents may involve someone with whom they have a close
relationship, like a family member, or someone from whom
protection is expected, such as a law enforcement official.
For some, it has negatively affected how they view them-
selves, or how they believe others view them and Blacks as a
group.
Our findings suggest that intra-racial dynamics were at
play in the perceptions of these young women. We chose to
explore the degree to which the young women identified
with being Black, as some studies have shown that, the
stronger one's Black identity, the more likely one is to per-
ceive an event as discriminatory (Sellers et al., 2006;
Thorburn & Bogart, 2005). Young women reported that the
more they expressed their ethnicity or elements of their
Black culture, the more they were viewed negatively by
members of other racial or ethnic groups. Interestingly, skin
color--the degree of lightness or darkness--was a factor
that had an impact on the perception of discrimination and
affected self-image in these participants. Among these
young women, there is a belief that being lighter skinned
confers a degree of protection against discrimination and, in
fact, is a more highly valued attribute among both non-
Blacks and Blacks. It is worth providing a historical over-
view to understand the origin of these beliefs and their
prevalence among young Black women.
During slavery, Whites placed greater economic value on
those who possessed lighter skin--they were sold at higher
prices and were preferred by Whites to perform personal ser-
vices. These lighter skinned individuals were more likely to
be house servants and were not subject to the hard field labor
of their darker skinned counterparts, thus enabling them to
develop marketable skills and gain social capital. These pref-
erential practices stemmed from a belief that the lighter skin
hue more closely paralleled the Euro-centric view of beauty
in which White was more aesthetically appealing than Black,
and that those with evidence of mixed racial heritage (lighter
skin), were intellectually superior to those of pure African
ancestry. Our findings, as evidenced by the comments of
some of the participants, suggest that this historical perspec-
tive, rooted in the legacy of slavery, racism, and discrimina-
tion that was commonplace in this country for centuries, has
been perpetuated and is still embedded in the belief systems
of Black youth today (Keith & Herring, 1991).
It was encouraging to learn that many of the young
women we interviewed had not adopted such views and,
although they or others had experienced discrimination,
their perceptions of the world around them had not been
tainted. Participants' racial identity and ways that they
identify with their ethnic culture may help to promote their
positive outlook. This concept, known as racial socializa-
tion (based on race pride and preparation for bias), is
believed to be a potential protective factor that buffers
African American youth from the negative impacts of per-
ceived discrimination (Harris-Britt, Valrie, Kurtz-Costes,
& Rowley, 2007). However, for those youth who do not
possess those protective factors, we must not overlook the
potential negative impact on their emotional and physical
well-being, in both the short- and long-term. A 5-year lon-
gitudinal study of African American adolescents (enrolled
between 10 and 12 years of age) found that increases in
perceived discrimination were associated with increased
conduct and depressive symptoms (Brody et al., 2006).
Nurturing, involved parenting was a protective factor; con-
duct problems were more prevalent among boys, but there
were no gender differences in depressive symptoms.
Although this study gives some preliminary data about the
consequences of early exposure to discrimination, more
research is needed to assess the relationship between dis-
crimination, health status, and protective factors in youth
who are exposed to discrimination over an extended and
prolonged period of time, and how these impacts manifest
in adulthood. The more recent Adverse Childhood
Experience work of Wade, Shea, Rubin, and Wood (2014)
has taken into account the impact of discrimination on
youth and demonstrates that urban-specific traumas during
childhood predisposes to poor health outcomes as adults.
However, there is an acknowledgment that future work is
required to understand these complex relationships in more
depth and how they manifest in adulthood.
Among the issues with which young people must con-
tend, and which should be included and addressed during the
health care visit, is the topic of racial discrimination.
Approaching the subject in a culturally sensitive way and
focusing on pertinent issues (e.g., safety in one's neighbor-
hood) is only one aspect of competent care. A broader under-
standing of institutional barriers that exist for an adolescent
woman can help the clinician understand her perspective and
assist in developing strategies to overcome future barriers.
This group of urban, minority young women provided
insight into their perceptions and experiences of racial
Lewis et al. 9
discrimination.Although valuable, the study findings may be
specific to the sampled population and not generalizable to
other adolescent populations. Future studies in other health
care settings, particularly targeting other demographic popu-
lations, will be useful to further delineate the experiences of
discrimination among young minority women and men.
Conclusion
During in-depth, semi-structured interviews, Black adoles-
cent females reported infrequently experiencing race-based
discrimination in the health care setting. However, in other
domains of their lives, this was a common occurrence. An
increased awareness of and understanding that minority
young women experience discrimination in non­health care
settings can be acquired through cultural sensitivity train-
ing. However, the providers in this clinic had not received
any such training and yet were still able to demonstrate a
level of cultural awareness, responding sensitively to their
racially diverse patients and meeting their health care needs
in an environment of comfort and safety. It may be that,
while the staff did not receive formal cultural sensitivity
training, they developed an implicit understanding--through
their medical training, clinic philosophy, and expectations
established in the provision of adolescent reproductive
health care--about the cultural constructs and context of
adolescent sexuality, resulting in improved health outcomes
for this population.
A high level of cultural awareness that is seamlessly inte-
grated into the clinic setting, and perhaps a willingness to
learn from patients' non-clinical discriminatory experiences,
can facilitate health providers' demonstration of cultural
humility, enabling them to provide some of the tools neces-
sary for youth to navigate complex social systems. Inquiries
of discriminatory events or experiences can be made by pro-
viders during the social history portion of an encounter, cre-
ating a space for open dialogue about these sensitive issues.
This can provide an opportunity for reciprocal learning and
allow a provider to lay a framework for anticipatory guid-
ance and problem solving around these issues. Equally
important is the reinforcement that these young people are
valued and the clinic is a place where their diversity and con-
tributions are readily embraced and supported.
