Introduction
Peer-reviewed journals are the primary source of credible
evidence for clinicians to use in practice. Peer-reviewed
journals exist to promote research (Fricke, 2004), and include
and promote many ways of knowing that are an essential
resource for clinicians seeking to enact evidence-based prac-
tice (Fossey, 2005; Froude, 2012). This article reports on the
sources of evidence for mental health occupational therapy
in peer-reviewed journals from 2000 to 2013.
Prior to 2000, the American Journal of Occupational
Therapy in 2008 and 2009 reported an analysis of journal
articles on mental health (n = 7) published as part of the
American Occupational Therapy Association's Centennial
Vision (D'Amico, Jaffe, & Gibson, 2010). The articles in this
small sample addressed intervention effectiveness, instru-
ment development, and descriptive research. A review of
articles published in the Indian Journal of Occupational
Therapy was undertaken for the decade from 2002 to 2012,
and found 10 studies relevant to mental health practice
(Acharya, 2013). Again, much of the evidence was descrip-
tive (50%), although there were also several control trials
(40%). Both D'Amico et al. (2010) and Acharya (2013) only
included a very small percentage of the overall evidence base
for mental health occupational therapy. Their samples would
have been influenced by the publication policies of the single
journals from which they were drawn.
A retrospective analysis of evidence published in the
Occupational Therapy Journal of Research covered 20 years
from 1981 (Brown & Brown, 2005). The majority of authors
were found to be academics, and descriptive studies com-
prised the largest proportion of articles published (23.7%).
However, other methodologies were also well represented,
particularly correlation studies (23.8%) and quasi-experimen-
tal studies (20.7%). Brown and Brown also investigated the
citations from these articles, and noted that journal articles
were substantially more likely to be cited than books (includ-
ing chapters). The journal "Work" conducted a 20-year
review of evidence that was published in it (Shaw, Campbell,
Jacobs, & Prodinger, 2010), and found that more than half of
their articles reported on the psychometric properties of
assessments. Conceptual articles made up 22% of the evi-
dence in this journal. The profile of the journal "Work" is
quite different from what was reported in the Occupational
Therapy Journal of Research, where, for example, conceptual
articles are not published. In the study of evidence (n = 52)

Evidence for Mental Health Occupational
Therapy: Trends in the First Decade of
the New Millennium (2000-2013)
Danielle Hitch1, Geneviève Pépin1, and Karen Stagnitti1
Abstract
This article reports on the evidence for mental health occupational therapy in peer-reviewed journals from 2000 to 2013.
Descriptive and inductive methods were used to address this question, with evidence from CINAHL, OTDBase, PSYCInfo,
SCOPUS, and Google Scholar® included. Many articles (n = 1,747) were found that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
A total of 47 different methods were used to develop evidence for mental health occupational therapy, and evidence
appeared in 300 separate peer-reviewed journals. It takes on average 7 months for an article to progress from submission
to acceptance, and a further 7 months to progress from acceptance to publication. More than 95% of articles published
between 2000 and 2002 were cited at least once in the following decade, and around 70% of these citations were recorded
in non-occupational therapy journals. The current evidence base for mental health occupational therapy is both substantial
and diverse.

authored by occupational therapists and published in non-
occupational therapy journals between 2004 and 2010,
Lajevardi, Rassafiani, Shafaroodi, Mehraban, and Ahmadi
(2011) found descriptive studies were the most common
methodology (52%) followed by randomized controlled tri-
als (29%).
Mental health is an important area of practice, which is
generally considered to be in a period of expansion globally
(Ceramidas, de Zita, Eklund, & Kirsh, 2009). Research into
the evidence for mental health occupational therapy to date
has been from peer-reviewed publications in a single journal
or formed an undifferentiated part of more general reviews
of occupational therapy evidence. An analysis of the evi-
dence that is currently available to mental health occupa-
tional therapists across a range of publications is needed to
identify what already exists and guide targeted research in
the future. From this knowledge, we can begin planning how
to proceed with regard to the types of evidence we wish to
develop and the stakeholders we wish to include in this
process.
In a review of the evidence relevant to mental health
occupational therapy from 2000 to 2012, three questions
were explored. These were as follows:
Research Question 1: What sort of evidence has been
published in peer-reviewed journals from 2000 to 2013?
Research Question 2: What is the range of journals
where this evidence is found?
Research Question 3: Where, how often, and how
quickly are articles by occupational therapists about men-
tal health occupational therapy in peer-reviewed journals
cited?
Method
Search Strategy
This study used both descriptive and inductive methods to
address the research questions. Four databases (CINAHL,
OTDBase, PSYCInfo, SCOPUS) and a search engine
(Google Scholar®) were searched using terms designed to
capture a broad range of evidence relevant to mental health
occupational therapy--"occupational therapy" AND ("men-
tal health" OR "mental illness" OR "psychiatry").
To answer the first and second research questions, the
inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) Articles formally pub-
lished between 01/01/2000 and 31/12/2013; (b) articles pub-
lished in English (either originally or available in translation);
(c) articles published in peer-reviewed publications; (d) arti-
cles where at least one author self-identified as an occupa-
tional therapist, consumer of occupational therapy services,
or organization representing the profession; and (e) articles
for which full text was available. The exclusion criteria were,
therefore, (a) articles formally published prior or subsequent
to these dates, or only available as "early access" during this
time, and (b) articles published in non-peer reviewed
publications.
To answer the third research question, a different search
strategy was used. The databases and search terms remained
the same; however, the search was limited to articles pub-
lished in the first 3 years of this century (2000, 2001, and
2002) to enable enough time to elapse since publication for a
comprehensive analysis of impact on future research. If there
were going to be any citations as a result of a publication,
you could reasonably expect them to come within the first
decade. This led to the identification of 289 articles, a subset
of the overall sample analyzed previously, on which the anal-
ysis around citations was undertaken.
Sample
One thousand forty-seven articles were found that met the
inclusion and exclusion criteria. A system of classification
was developed to deconstruct the sample into a manageable
form using Microsoft Excel. To extract relevant data for evi-
dence in mental health occupational therapy from each arti-
cle, 13 variables were used: author names, author designation,
number of authors, year, title of article, journal, practice cat-
egory, practice sub-category, type of evidence, level of evi-
dence (quantitative), level of evidence (qualitative),
submission to acceptance (days), and acceptance to publica-
tion (days). The practice categories and sub-categories were
based on both the International Classification of Diseases
(ICD10; World Health Organisation, 2010) for diagnoses.
No standardized taxonomy for defining areas of practice in
mental health occupational therapy currently exists, and so
these categories were generated from the first author's under-
standing of practice across several countries (Australia,
Canada, and the United Kingdom). Table 1 displays the clas-
sifications used for practice categories used to deconstruct
the sample data. The category of ambiguous/mixed diagnosis
was used for studies where the participants' diagnoses were
not clearly recorded or the sample included people from a
range of diagnostic categories.
Data Analysis
Type and Level of Evidence
Analysis began with a careful reading of each article, using
highlighting and notes to identify the knowledge contained
within. The article was classified according to the practice
category it belonged to, and further classified according to
relevant sub-categories (see Table 1). Finally, all the evi-
dence in each article was subjected to two further triage
steps, classifying it with regard to type and level of evidence.
Type of evidence was grouped into four classes of scientific
evidence: quantitative, qualitative, mixed, and other evi-
dence. For evidence that had been classified as "other," no
further classification was required. Articles in the first three
Hitch et al. 3
classes of scientific evidence were classified according to the
level of evidence they presented.
The level of evidence for qualitative evidence was
assigned using the Rosalind Franklin Qualitative Research
Appraisal (RF-QRA) instrument (Henderson & Rheault,
2004). Trustworthiness in the RF-QRAcomprises credibility,
transferability, dependability, and confirmability. Each com-
ponent of trustworthiness is measured on a 2-point scale
(Yes/No). These scores contribute to the overall level of
trustworthiness, which varies between I and V (1 = trustwor-
thiness confirmed for all four components, 5 = trustworthi-
ness confirmed for none of the components). Each piece of
qualitative evidence was subjected to key questions, which
were as follows: (a) Credibility--Can you believe the
results? (b) Transferability--Can the results be transferred to
other situation? (c) Dependability--Would the results be
similar if the study was repeated? and (d) Confirmability--
Was there an attempt to enhance objectivity by reducing
research bias?
If evidence existed that supported that element of trust-
worthiness, the study received one point for that element,
which contributed to its ranking on a range of I to V. Unlike
the quantitative hierarchy of evidence to follow, this method
is dependent on whether authors have reported their efforts to
increase trustworthiness in their publication. This reporting
can vary, and recommendations have been made for its adop-
tion as a standard feature of qualitative research reports
(Mortenson & Oliffe, 2009).
For assignment of level of evidence for quantitative stud-
ies, the National Health and Medical Research Council
(NHMRC; 2000) levels of evidence were used. Each quanti-
tative study was assigned a ranking from I to V (I = system-
atic reviews and meta-analysis, V = expert opinion, including
literature/narrative reviews, consensus statements, descrip-
tive studies, and individual case studies). Table 2 shows the
RF-QRA instrument and NHMRC levels of evidence
together, to illustrate how rigor was determined in this study.
Publication Characteristics
Data analyzed for publication characteristics included
authors, year, article title, journal, and the number of authors
recorded. The affiliation of all authors on an article was clas-
sified into one of three categories: academic only, clinician
only, or mixed. The number of days between submission and
acceptance, and between acceptance and publication, were
recorded where these data were given. This information was
important to understand how rapidly evidence was dissemi-
nated and available for use by mental health occupational
therapists.

Citation Rates
Each article was entered into Google Scholar®, and the
number of citations was recorded between 2000 and 2012.
This time frame meant that each of the articles had been
published for at least 10 years. Citations from all sources
(i.e., peer-reviewed journal articles, books, gray literature)
were included in the citation count. In common with the
overall project, citations in languages other than English
were excluded. A number of citations without any year
recorded were found, and these were excluded. Citations
were recorded on a year-by-year basis and grouped into
occupational therapy and generic sources. In this study,
"generic" journal sources are all those that do not have a
specifically occupational therapy focus or remit. To qualify
as an occupational therapy source, the citation needed to be
in an occupational journal or have occupational therapy in
the title.
Statistical Analysis
The data were analyzed using several groupings: across the
entire sample, across a sub-category (such as Intervention/
Child and Adolescent), or within a subset of a sub-category
(such as qualitative data around Lived Experience/
Schizophrenia). For each article, descriptive statistics
described the patterns and characteristics for each variable.
Inductive statistics were also used to analyze data relating to
some variables, with independent sample t tests applied.
Results
The analysis for the first two research questions on type of
evidence and source of evidence included the total sample of
1,747 peer-reviewed articles. To answer the third research
question, the same inclusion and exclusion criteria were
adopted with the exception of the years of publication. The
analysis was limited to the first 3 years (2000, 2001, and
2002) to enable enough time to elapse since publication for a
comprehensive analysis of impact by citation rate. This
resulted in a sub-sample of 289 articles.
Evidence Published in Peer-Reviewed Journals
From 2000 to 2013
There were 1,747 peer-reviewed articles written by occupa-
tional therapists in English about mental health occupational
therapy between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2013,
for which full text could be accessed. There were also an
additional 229 articles excluded due to being written in
another language, and Table 3 displays the languages that
were represented.
Authors.The vast majority of articles in the sample were
written either by academics only (56%, n = 984) or academ-
ics in partnerships with clinicians (33%, n = 569), with the
remainder attributed to clinicians only. Across the entire
sample, the average number of authors per article was 3.17
(range = 1-15, SD = 2.15) with a noticeable increasing trend
as demonstrated in Figure 1.
There was a very significant difference in the number of
authors on articles published in occupational therapy jour-
nals (M = 2.62, SD = 1.62) and generic journals (M = 4.15,
SD = 2.62; p = .00).

The proportions of evidence for each of the practice catego-
ries and sub-categories are shown in Table 4.

For some of the sub-categories, the number of articles was
also mapped by year. For both intervention and lived experi-
ence, half of the categories displayed a trend toward consis-
tently low numbers of articles. These categories were Drug
and Alcohol, Mood (intervention), Anxiety, Personality/
Behavior, and Ambiguous/Mixed Diagnoses (lived experi-
ence). However, articles about child and adolescent interven-
tions (particularly autism) and organic interventions
(particularly dementia) have steadily increased in recent
years. In addition, there has been a steady increase in the
number of articles about the lived experience of people with
mood disorders and schizophrenia.
Articles about forensic, older adults and private practice
programs showed consistently low numbers of articles. As
shown in Figure 2, there was an increasing trend for articles
about vocational programs, and articles about programs for
children and adolescents, and for adults, both peaked in the
middle of the first decade of this century. The reasons for
these peaks are not immediately clear, and may warrant fur-
ther investigation.
With regard to theory, there was an increase in articles
about conceptual practice models and related knowledge
toward the end of the first decade of the new millennium, but
this appears to have tailed off from 2012.
Types of Evidence
Most of the evidence found was quantitative, as illustrated in
Figure 3.
A total of 47 different methods were used to develop evi-
dence for mental health occupational therapy, and a full list
is provided in the appendix. Many of these were used in sin-
gle studies, and the top 10 methods spanned all types of evi-
dence, as shown in Table 5.
As descriptive methods were the most frequently encoun-
tered, it is unsurprising that the majority of the quantitative
evidence available to mental health occupational therapists
was rated as Level V. However, as shown in Figure 4, the
profile for qualitative evidence was quite different, with the
majority being higher up the hierarchy.
A different pattern emerged in the articles where mixed
methods were used. Both the quantitative and qualitative
methods tended toward the lower ends of each hierarchy, as
illustrated in Figure 5.
Range of Journals
Across the 14 years reviewed, there was an average of 122.47
articles (range = 88-169, SD = 26.41) published each year by
occupational therapy authors about mental health occupa-
tional therapy. The articles in this sample appeared in 300
separate peer-reviewed journals, and the majority of articles
were published in occupational-therapy-specific journals
(59.87%, n = 1,046). Many of the top 10 publications were
occupational therapy-specific journals for articles regarding
mental health occupational therapy, but none garnered a sub-
stantial proportion of the articles (as shown in Table 6).
Journal Process
Some journals publish information about the publication
process, usually in the form of dates for submission, accep-
tance, or publication. The data for these variables were
inconsistent, as not all journals publish it, and some changed
their policy in this regard during the time of this study.
Sometimes the data were given only by month, and in this
case, it has been assumed the date was the first of that
month. The following results should therefore be regarded
as estimates.
More than one third of the articles (n = 652, 37.32%)
included information about the time taken between submis-
sion and acceptance. The values ranged between 1 day and
939 days, indicating a wide range of procedural speed. The
mean number of days between submission and acceptance
was 207.94 (SD 156.13). A higher proportion of articles
(n = 726, 41.56%) included information about the time taken
between acceptance and publication. Again, there was a wide
range of values (1-994), and the mean number of days was
230.81 (SD 147.88). Therefore, the average article written by
occupational therapists about mental health occupational
therapy takes approximately 7 months to be accepted for
publication, and a further 7 months (approximately) to
appear in its final version in print. As shown in Figure 6,
these times have tended to slightly decrease since 2000.
There was a significant difference in the average time
between submission and acceptance between occupational
therapy journals (M = 239.79, SD = 154.87) and non-occu-
pational therapy journals (M = 180.13, SD = 135.10), t(488)
= 4.98, p = .00. Articles progressed from submission to
acceptance significantly more quickly (approximately 2
months) in non-occupational therapy journals. There was
also a difference in the average time between acceptance
and publication between occupational therapy journals

statistical significance.
Citation Rates
Atotal of 7,218 citations were recorded for the 289 articles in
this sample, giving an overall average of 24.97 per article. Of
these 7,218 citations, 6,271 citations were included in this
analysis due to the exclusion criteria of English language or
for not including a year of publication. The following results
are based on 86.88% of the total citations.
The number of citations per article ranged from 0 to 465.
Twelve articles were not cited (4.15%, n = 12) by 2013, and a
possible factor appears to have been publication in difficult-
to-access journals. Six articles were in the Irish Journal of
OccupationalTherapy,SouthAfricanJournalofOccupational
Therapy, and World Federation of Occupational Therapists
Bulletin. Of the remaining six, three described interventions
(Gregg, McRobert, & Pillar, 2002; Lee & Dawe, 2002; Lloyd
& Samra, 2000), two were overviews (Babiss, 2002; Gutman
& Haynes, 2002), and one addressed a workforce issue
(Wigham & Supyk, 2001).
The majority of the articles were cited between once and
20 times (n = 183, 65.40%). At the other extreme were 10
articles that were cited more than 100 times in the subse-
quent decade. As shown in Table 7, the most cited article
(Fossey, Epstein, Findlay, Plant, & Harvey, 2002) garnered
the majority of these citations. Five of these 10 articles were
about children or adolescents (4 of which referred to sensory
processing), 2 were about involving clients in the research
process, and 2 concerned working with people with
dementia.
Around 70% (n = 4,409) of the citations were recorded in
non-occupational therapy journals. Although there was no
appreciable trend within occupational therapy journals

(average change across all years = 0.01%), there was a
marked trend for increased rates of citation in generic jour-
nals (average change across all years = 11%), and this rate of
citation continues to accelerate (as shown in Figure 7).
There was a significant difference in the total number
of citations between articles published in occupational ther-
apy journals (M = 16.92, SD = 22.30) and generic journals
(M = 42.87, SD = 68.04; p = .00), with articles in generic
journals cited far more frequently. Articles published in
occupational therapy journals were significantly more often
cited in occupational therapy journals (M = 7.55, SD = 9.15)
than generic journals (M = 4.20, SD = 7.50; p = .002).Articles
published in generic journals were significantly more likely
to be cited in generic journals (M = 32.44, SD = 57.61) than
occupational therapy journals (M = 7.43, SD = 15.17).
The average time between publication and first citation
was 2.83 years in occupational therapy journals and 3.05
years in generic journals. Articles in generic journals were
cited significantly more quickly in generic journals (M = 1.80,
SD = 1.87; p = .000) than in occupational therapy journals
(M = 3.97, SD = 2.87).
Discussion
The results of provided a detailed picture of the current evi-
dence available to occupational therapists in mental health.
Several trends were identified in the evidence published
from Years 2000 to 2013. Intervention for people with
organic diagnoses was prominent, as were studies that
included a sample with ambiguous or mixed diagnoses.

Interventions for children and adolescents, and those for peo-
ple with schizophrenia, also form noteworthy proportions of
the evidence base. Much of this evidence on programs
focuses on services for adults and vocational services, which
may be reflective of the professions priorities or simply
where many occupational therapists are employed. With
momentum growing toward early intervention in mental
health and aging populations in many Western nations, fur-
ther research supporting programs for children, adolescents,
and older adults is both timely and required to support
practice.
Most of the evidence available to mental health occupa-
tional therapists was produced using quantitative methods.
However, a broad range of research methods was used, with
the top 10 cited articles including examples from all tradi-
tions. Generally, the quantitative evidence was ranked in the
bottom two levels of the hierarchy of evidence, while quali-
tative evidence tended to be ranked higher in the second and
third tiers. Previous studies into patterns of evidence pub-
lished in mental health have confirmed this pattern for quan-
titative studies (Brown & Brown, 2005; Shaw et al., 2010);
however, patterns in qualitative research have not been stud-
ied previously. Given qualitative evidence constitutes almost
one in five mental health occupational therapy studies pub-
lished, great attention to its quality and distribution is
warranted.
Articles using mixed methods tended to combine less rig-
orous methods from the bottom two levels of the hierar-
chies. However, it could also be argued that the triangulating
effect of using mixed methods, where the findings of each
method are used to complement each other, acts to increase
the overall rigor of the study (independent of the rigor of the
individual methods).
The majority of articles written by occupational thera-
pists about mental health occupational therapy are cited,
and those that are uncited tend to be in journals that are
difficult to access. This may become less of a problem in
the coming years, as the majority of journals move to elec-
tronic formats and open access becomes more common.
The articles that were most cited included a large propor-
tion addressing autism (particularly sensory processing). In
occupational therapy practice, autism is more commonly
associated with pediatric occupational therapists, although
it is classified in the ICD10 (and the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [DSM]) as a mental
health disorder. Along with autism, dementia has also been
an area with increased publications in recent years, and is
also an area of occupational therapy practice where the
"physical" and "mental health" sides of the profession are
more closely aligned.
Citations for these articles were far more likely to be
found in generic journals, and there is a strong trend for
ongoing acceleration in citation rates in these publications.
Articles that were originally published in generic journals
were cited statistically significantly more often than those in
occupational therapy journals, and were also statistically sig-
nificantly more often cited in the sub-group of generic jour-
nals. However, those originally published in occupational
therapy journals were statistically significantly more often
cited in occupational therapy journals. The impact of an arti-
cle with regard to its chances of future citation is therefore
somewhat dependent on the place where the original article

was published. Whether this is a factor in the choice of jour-
nal made by authors is currently unknown, and would be
instructive to clarify. However, it is clear that occupational
therapists should expand their searches beyond occupational
therapy literature to ensure they have access to all the latest
developments in the field.
The impact of an article on future research takes approxi-
mately 3 years to appear using citation rates as a measure.
Articles initially published in generic journals were cited in
generic journals significantly more quickly than those pub-
lished in occupational therapy journals. However, citation
counts are a relatively blunt instrument with which to mea-
sure impact. Future research that follows the influence of the
content of the evidence, by tracing the development of ideas
through a line of articles on a particular subject, would be
illuminating.
There are several limitations to this study, which limit
the applicability of these findings. The exclusion of arti-
cles in languages other than English did lead to the loss of
a number of articles. In the absence of translated copies,
monolingual occupational therapists will not have access
to potentially valuable evidence (regardless of the lan-
guage it is published in). Although it is important to pre-
serve linguistic diversity within the profession, resources
for translation would be a good investment. With regard to
the publication process, only some of the journals publish
information usually in the form of dates for submission,
acceptance, or publication. This introduced some potential
inaccuracy into the findings, but they are the most accurate
possible in the circumstances and should be regarded as
estimates.
Conclusion
The current evidence base for mental health occupational
therapy is substantial and diverse, having grown consider-
ably in the last decade. The vast majority of the evidence was
written either by authors in academic roles or collaborative
teams comprising academics and clinicians. The aforemen-
tioned diversity was also evident in the fact the articles were
found in so many peer-reviewed journals.
Our knowledge in some areas (such as autism and demen-
tia) is relatively comprehensive, or rapidly developing. In
others, there is a distinct lack of evidence (such as personal-
ity disorders), and the reasons for these omissions are not
clear. There was a gap in published evidence about mood and
anxiety disorders, which are the mental health problems with
the highest prevalence. Accepting the inclusive perspective
of this study has enabled a comprehensive understanding of
what is available to mental health occupational therapists.
This article has documented the evidence based for the first
decade of this century in mental health occupational therapy
that was written in English.
