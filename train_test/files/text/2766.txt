KEYWORDS: lead poisoning, crime, antisocial behavior, impulsivity, toxic inequality
The consequences of lead exposure for later crime are theoretically compelling,
but direct evidence from representative, longitudinal samples is sparse. By capitaliz-
ing on an original follow-up of more than 200 infants from the birth cohort of the
Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods matched to their blood
lead levels from around age 3 years, we provide several tests. Through the use of four
waves of longitudinal data that include measures of individual development, family
background, and structural inequalities in how lead becomes embodied, we assess the
hypothesized link between early childhood lead poisoning and both parent-reported
delinquent behavior and official arrest in late adolescence. We also test for mediating
developmental processes of impulsivity and anxiety or depression. The results from
multiple analytic strategies that make different assumptions reveal a plausibly causal
effect of childhood lead exposure on adolescent delinquent behavior but no direct link
to arrests. The results underscore lead exposure as a trigger for poisoned development
in the early life course and call for greater integration of the environment into theories
of individual differences in criminal behavior.
Exposure to dangerous levels of lead was extensive for long stretches of the twenti-
eth century (Feigenbaum and Muller, 2016; Troesken, 2006). Although environmental
reforms such as the bans on lead in gasoline and paint in the 1970s were deemed victories
for public health at the time (Markowitz and Rosner, 2013; Needleman, 2004), lead toxi-
city is far from a hazard of the past. High levels of lead have recently been found in thou-
sands of cities in the United States (Pell and Schneyer, 2016) and in both developed and
developing countries around the world (Tong, von Schirnding, and Prapamontol, 2000).

270 SAMPSON & WINTER
The poisoning of the water in Flint, Michigan, in late 2015 and the evacuation in 2016 of
an entire neighborhood contaminated by a smelting plant in East Chicago, Indiana, shone
bright public lights on the contemporary perils of lead (Goodnough, 2016a, 2016b).
The legacy of lead, both historic and contemporary, carries important theoretical impli-
cations for the study of crime over the life course. An association between lead exposure
and cognitive impairment has been documented in medical research (Canfield et al., 2003;
Lanphear et al., 2000; Reuben et al., 2017), and many criminologists have long argued
that there is a connection between cognitive ability and delinquency (Farrington, 1998).
Similarly, there is evidence that lead aggravates hyperactivity, impulsive behavior, and
mental health problems (Braun et al., 2006; Winter and Sampson, 2017), which have been
shown to predict delinquency (Elliott, Huizinga, and Menard, 1989; Moffitt, 1990). More
directly, in a small body of research, an association has been found between lead exposure
and later measures of delinquency and crime (e.g., Reyes, 2015; Wright et al., 2008).
Also important theoretically is that exposure to lead is unequally distributed, likely
more so today than in the past when lead was "in the air" and thus almost everywhere.
Contemporary lead exposure is linked, for example, to minority status and poverty at
the individual level, as well as to racial segregation and concentrated poverty at the
neighborhood level primarily because of the unequal distribution of dilapidated hous-
ing that contains remnants of lead paint (Lanphear et al., 1998; Oyana and Margai, 2010;
Sampson and Winter, 2016). Similarly, the highest concentrations of lead in Flint were
located in its most disadvantaged neighborhoods (Hanna-Attisha et al., 2016), and the
evacuated neighborhood in East Chicago was both low income and predominantly Black
(Goodnough, 2016b). Lead may thus be a mechanism that connects inequality to crime
(Muller, Sampson, and Winter, 2018).
Despite the scientific consensus that lead exposure inflicts serious damage (National
Research Council, 1993) and the fact that lead is still a contemporary threat to society,
especially among the poor and in racially segregated areas, our knowledge of childhood
lead exposure and the developmental course of crime is surprisingly sparse. As simply
stated in a recent review of the literature, "there is a dearth of criminological research on
this topic" (Narag, Pizarro, and Gibbs, 2009: 954). In particular, the results of our review
reveal that longitudinal data from representative samples with a long-term follow-up of
individuals are rare, as are studies in which lead exposure is integrated with mediating de-
velopmental processes or in which measures of alternative explanations, such as poverty,
are included at both the individual and ecological levels. Conceptual integration of the
age-graded mechanisms of lead's damage with criminological theory is also lacking.
We address these limitations in this article and argue that exposure to lead in infancy
can poison development and exert negative long-term consequences. We also integrate
research on the contextual pathways of childhood lead exposure with life-course crimino-
logical theory, motivating a core set of hypotheses on the consequences of lead exposure.
The result of our theoretical integration supports an analytic strategy that allows us to
assess the long-term link between childhood lead exposure and later delinquent behavior
among adolescents and to estimate whether the link is plausibly causal in nature. Further-
more, we assess several explanatory mechanisms that are hypothesized to connect early
exposure to later behavior.
The data supporting our analytic strategy come from an original follow-up of the birth
cohort from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN).
We match four waves of longitudinal data from the PHDCN that include measures of
LEAD POISONING AND CRIME 271
individual development, family background, and neighborhood context with childhood
blood lead level (BLL) tests and the locations of smelting plants in Chicago, Illinois. By
capitalizing on this comprehensive linked data set, we estimate the effect of childhood
lead poisoning on adolescent delinquency--both parent-reported and official criminal his-
tories. Prior research is assessed in the next section, and then we build on it to formulate
a theoretical framework for testing the lead­crime hypothesis.
STATE OF KNOWLEDGE
The criminological significance of lead is at once provocative and understudied. In a few
longitudinal cohort studies, scholars have assessed the relationship between lead exposure
and delinquent behavior at the individual level, with uncertain results. For example, in
a lead smelting community in Australia, lifetime BLL above 15 µg/dL was associated
with increased aggressive behavior at ages 11 to 13 years relative to children with lower
levels of exposure (Burns et al., 1999). By contrast, Beckley et al.'s (2017) study based
on a 1972 birth cohort in Dunedin, New Zealand, revealed that lead exposure at age
11 (average BLL of 11 µg/dL) had an imprecise or weak relationship with self-reported
offending in adolescence (but see Farrington, 2017). It is uncertain how either of these
findings translates to the contemporary United States, where the population average BLL
is around 2 µg/dL (Jones et al., 2009).
Within the United States, Dietrich et al. (2001) found a positive relationship between
pre- and postnatal lead exposure and both self- and parent-reported delinquent behavior
at ages 15 to 17 in a socioeconomically disadvantaged sample in Cincinnati, Ohio, with
high levels of lead exposure. In a nationally representative sample, childhood lead expo-
sure was associated with antisocial behavior from ages 4 to 12; childhood lead exposure
also predicted oppositional behavior and having hurt someone badly by age 17 (Reyes,
2015). Although carefully executed, Reyes (2015) estimated individuals' lead exposure,
and measured ecological confounding, such as poverty, at the state level rather than at
the more proximate levels, such as neighborhood, associated with exposure.
The results of several cross-sectional studies are nonetheless broadly consistent with
these longitudinal findings. Associations have been reported between lead exposure and
aggressive or antisocial behavior at ages 6 to 9 in Edinburgh, Scotland (Thomson et al.,
1989), as well as at ages 7 to 11 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Needleman et al., 1996);
conduct disorder among American children ages 8 to 15 (Braun et al., 2008); and rule-
breaking behavior at ages 14 to 18 in an impoverished area of Brazil (Olympio et al.,
2010). In a meta-analysis of 19 studies, both longitudinal and cross-sectional, Marcus,
Fulton, and Clarke (2010) reported an association between lead exposure and conduct
disorder (including aggressive and externalizing behavior).
Whereas the research described thus far has been focused on delinquent behavior re-
ported by subjects, parents, and/or teachers, a few scholars have considered the link be-
tween lead exposure and involvement with the criminal justice system. Wright and col-
leagues (2008) followed the aforementioned disadvantaged cohort in Cincinnati to ages
19 to 24 and found that pre- and postnatal lead exposure were associated with total ar-
rests and arrests for violent crime, whereas Denno (1990) found a positive relationship
between lead exposure and arrests in a disadvantaged minority sample in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania. Fergusson, Boden, and Horwood (2008) studied a New Zealand cohort,
showing associations between lead exposure and both violent and property offenses,
272 SAMPSON & WINTER
but in another New Zealand cohort study, the authors found weak or no associations
of lead exposure with later criminal arrests (Beckley et al., 2017). The results of two
case-control studies revealed a positive link between lead and official crime, with Pihl
and Ervin (1990) finding higher lead levels in head-hair samples from incarcerated in-
dividuals with violent criminal histories relative to nonviolent offenders and Needleman
et al. (2002) finding higher concentrations of bone lead in arrested and convicted youth in
Pennsylvania relative to nondelinquent controls. Finally, Reyes (2015) and Amato et al.
(2013) found that childhood lead exposure was predictive of arrest and official school
suspension, respectively, whereas Aizer and Currie (2017) used an instrumental variables
strategy and data from Rhode Island to show that childhood lead exposure was associated
with later school disciplinary infractions and juvenile detention.
Criminalization is not necessarily the same as delinquent behavior, however, as not
all unlawful behavior brings about a response from the criminal justice system. Record-
keeping systems are uneven in the case of juvenile infractions, with many offenses handled
informally rather than processed as arrests. Another long-standing concern in criminol-
ogy is that, relative to Whites and those of higher socioeconomic status (SES), minorities
and those who are poor may be disproportionately likely to be arrested, charged, and
convicted for the same criminal behavior (Travis, Western, and Redburn, 2014). Whether
criminal justice or survey measures are preferable is an old criminological debate; our
point is simply that until now researchers have not directly examined both kinds of data
simultaneously and have not tested whether lead exposure increases criminal justice sys-
tem involvement, or criminalization, through the pathway of delinquent behavior.
AGGREGATE-LEVEL EVIDENCE
The relationship between lead exposure and official crime has been examined at the
aggregate level as well by using full populations at various units of analysis beyond the in-
dividual. Cross-nationally (Nevin, 2007) and nationally within the United States (Nevin,
2000), reduced lead exposure as a result of increased regulation of leaded gasoline has
been linked with lower violent crime rates approximately 20 years later in the 1990s. At
the state level, Reyes (2007) argued that declines in lead exposure during the 1970s and
early 1980s were associated with later declines in violent crime. At the county level, cross-
sectional associations were found between air lead levels and homicide rates (Stretesky
and Lynch, 2001) as well as between air lead levels and violent and property crime rates
(Stretesky and Lynch, 2004), after accounting for socioeconomic and racial composition.
At smaller units of analysis, cities' use of lead water pipes in the late nineteenth century
increased homicide rates in the early twentieth century (Feigenbaum and Muller, 2016),
and city-level air lead concentrations in the mid-to-late twentieth century were found to
predict assault rates a little more than 20 years later in the United States (Mielke and
Zahran, 2012) and Australia (Taylor et al., 2016). Furthermore, children's rates of ele-
vated BLL were found to predict increased violent, nonviolent, and total crime rates at
the census tract level in St. Louis, Missouri (Boutwell et al., 2016).
In light of findings across multiple contexts and units of analysis that decreasing lead
exposure predicts decreasing crime rates around 20 years later when cohorts exposed to
less lead in childhood are at peak ages of offending in early adulthood, several researchers
have interpreted aggregate-level results as evidence for a causal link between lead expo-
sure and crime (e.g., Nevin, 2007; Reyes, 2007). Nevertheless, the association of airborne
LEAD POISONING AND CRIME 273
lead levels in the second half of the twentieth century with the crime drop starting in the
mid-1990s in America and other countries does not assess the hypothesized underlying
link between individual exposure and crime. Moreover, the aggregate-level relationship
has been challenged by Lauritsen, Rezey, and Heimer (2016), who argued that the time-
series relationship between lead exposure and lagged official crime rates is not replicated
by using national victimization data (see also McCall and Land, 2004). This finding again
points to the importance of examining both official and unofficial measures of crime in
an assessment of the consequences of lead exposure, regardless of the level of analysis.
THEORETICAL MOTIVATION AND HYPOTHESES
Through our review, we have identified important gaps that indicate the need for an
assessment of the individual-level, developmental relationship between childhood lead
exposure and later delinquent behavior. First, existing evidence on delinquency from con-
temporary representative samples with direct biological measures of childhood lead expo-
sure followed prospectively into adolescence is rare. Second, with few exceptions (Aizer
and Currie, 2017), researchers have not thoroughly accounted for selection bias in lead
exposure, hindering causal estimates of its association with delinquency at the individual
level. Third, researchers have not identified mediating developmental processes or distin-
guished delinquent behavior from processes of criminalization. Finally, aggregate-level
research on lead exposure and the 1990s crime drop is analytically distinct from our goal
of testing the individual effects of lead exposure on crime.
Lead exposure is structural in origin, and its impact is age-graded in nature, which mo-
tivated us to consider childhood lead exposure from the theoretical perspective of life-
course criminology. Infants and young children are more likely to be exposed to lead
than are older children or adults through normal hand-to-mouth behaviors while play-
ing on the ground, leading to the ingestion of lead paint, contaminated dust, and dirt
(Needleman, 2004). Lead's biological consequences are also age-graded in compounded
ways. Once exposed, young children absorb lead more efficiently than do older children
or adults (Ziegler et al., 1978), and young children's rapidly developing brains are more
vulnerable to lead's effects than are older individuals' more mature brains (Needleman,
2004). Once in the body, lead mimics calcium, impairing brain development and neu-
rotransmitter systems in ways that disrupt executive functioning and mood regulation,
which in turn reduces impulse control and the inhibition of aggressive behaviors (Cecil
et al., 2008; Feigenbaum and Muller, 2016; Lidsky and Schneider, 2003; Needleman, 2004;
Winter and Sampson, 2017). Through the same age-graded mechanisms, lead exposure is
associated with reduced cognitive ability (Lanphear et al., 2005; Reuben et al., 2017) and
increased attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Goodlad, Marcus, and Fulton, 2013),
both of which are predictors of delinquent behavior in the criminological literature
(Farrington, 1998; Moffitt, 1993). The damage of lead poisoning is not considered re-
versible, which is why pediatricians so strongly emphasize prevention (Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention [CDC], 1991).
All of this leads to our theoretical conceptualization of childhood lead poisoning as
an adverse transition in the early life course, one that is embodied and that exerts long-
term influence on adolescent development and delinquent behavior. In this sense, like
victimization by a violent event, individual lead exposure is akin to a turning point that
alters development. But, unlike traditional turning points that emerge in adolescence
274 SAMPSON & WINTER
or adulthood (e.g., military service, marriage, employment) and that change ongoing
criminal trajectories or promote desistance (Nguyen and Loughran, 2018; Sampson and
Laub, 1993), in the present case, the triggering force of lead exposure is exerted in early
childhood.
Lead exposure offers distinct analytic advantage for our goal of identifying its effects
on crime relative to traditional criminological predictors. Compared with the internal or
subjective characteristics of the individual, such as attitudes or morality, or transitions
in adulthood that have been criticized for being a function of individual choice, such as
jobs or marriage (e.g., Sampson and Laub, 1993), children, especially toddlers, do not
control or select their lead exposure. Rather, most contemporary lead exposure comes
from lead-contaminated house dust generated by lead paint and remnants of lead in the
soil that are unwittingly tracked into homes and ingested at very young ages through
normal childhood behavior (CDC, 1991; Lanphear et al., 2002). As an external toxin,
lead is thus more exogenous to the child than many of the mainstays of developmental or
life-course criminology.
Even parents are often unaware of lead levels in their children's environments. Con-
sider that health professionals only recently coalesced around an agreement that lead is
dangerous at low levels. Additionally, lead-based paint has remained in millions of hous-
ing units despite being banned (Jacobs et al., 2002), sometimes stirred up by housing reno-
vations (Rabinowitz, Leviton, and Bellinger, 1985) or hidden by landlords with fresh coats
of paint and then exposed when newer paint layers peel (McCoy, 2017). Smelting plants
are a major source of contemporary soil lead (Albalak et al., 2003; Landrigan et al., 1975;
Vargas et al., 2001), most of which were built decades ago and have been shuttered for
some time (Eckel, Rabinowitz, and Foster, 2001). Yet, as the residents of East Chicago,
Indiana, experienced, the public and many environmental professionals were unaware
of the lead exposure risks in the contaminated soil around these plants. This leads us to
exploit historical data on smelting plant locations as an instrumental variable, providing
further analytic leverage in our estimation of the link between lead exposure and later
crime.
The fact that lead exposure is an environmental toxin also has theoretical import for
how we conceive of individual differences in human development over the life course. It
is common to trace individuals' propensities to engage in criminal behavior to particular
qualities of individuals or their immediate family or situational environments. Individ-
ual differences in character (Heckman, Humphries, and Kautz, 2014), such as reflected
in aggressive and impulsive behavior or low self-control (e.g., Farrington, 1998; Moffitt,
1990), are not just properties of the individual, family, or situation, however. We argue
that the individual differences in character that predict delinquency are in part consti-
tuted by the broader environmental context (Denno, 1992; Sampson, 2016) and, in this
case, by structurally and historically shaped lead exposure. This theoretical framework
does not undermine individual or family differences; rather, it integrates these processes
into a model that contextualizes the course of character development.
To summarize, the first and main hypothesis we test is that there is a long-term link
between exposure to lead in infancy and delinquent behavior in adolescence. Second,
we use multiple analytic strategies that make different underlying assumptions to assess
whether any significant relationships are plausibly causal in nature. Third, guided by the
findings from prior health research that reveal a pathway from lead exposure to later im-
pulsivity and impaired mental health (Braun et al., 2006; Winter and Sampson, 2017),
LEAD POISONING AND CRIME 275
coupled with associations among impulsivity, mental health problems, and antisocial
behavior in the criminological literature (Elliott, Huizinga, and Menard, 1989; Farrington,
1998; Gottfredson and Hirschi, 1990), we assess whether impulsive behavior and com-
promised mental health (i.e., anxiety or depression) mediate any relationship between
childhood lead exposure and adolescent delinquency.1 Fourth, we test whether there is
an additional association between childhood lead exposure and official arrests in adoles-
cence. Because there is little theoretical reason to predict that lead exposure has a direct
effect on the criminalization process, we expect any effects of lead on later arrest to be
mediated by antisocial behavior. To investigate these hypotheses, we draw on a long-term
follow-up of a birth cohort in Chicago linked with their childhood BLLs from the Chicago
Department of Public Health as well as with their official arrest records from the Illinois
Criminal Justice Information Authority.
DATA AND MEASURES
We report here on an 18-year follow-up of the birth cohort from the PHDCN (N =
1,255 at baseline). The PHDCN was originally designed as a longitudinal multicohort
study of children and their caregivers drawn from a representative sample of households
living in a diverse set of Chicago neighborhoods in the mid-1990s (Sampson, 2012: 71­
93). (Additional details on the PHDCN's multistage design and sample are in appendix
A of the online supporting information.2) Extensive interviews and assessments were
conducted with the primary caregivers of the birth cohort members three times over a
7-year period, at approximately 2.5-year intervals: Wave 1 was concentrated in 1995­1997,
wave 2 in 1997­1999, and wave 3 in 1999­2002. Cohort participants were followed no mat-
ter where they moved in the United States. Participation at baseline and retention at wave
3 were relatively high for a contemporary urban sample, 78 percent and 75 percent, re-
spectively.
In 2012 and 2013, a random sample of the birth, 9-, 12-, and 15-year-old cohorts from
wave 3 was selected as part of a larger study, hereafter defined as "wave 4" of the PHDCN.
By wave 4, birth cohort members were between 16 and 18 years old. As in earlier waves,
an interview was carried out with the caretaker of the birth cohort member that included
information on the household and a battery of items tapping the behavior and circum-
stances of the target child. Despite the long time that elapsed since last contact at wave 3
(more than a decade) and the contemporary urban setting, 67 percent of eligible cases of
the randomly sampled birth cohort were located (N = 378). We employed survey weights
that accounted for the PHDCN's multilevel survey design as well as for subsequent attri-
tion to allow for population estimates (appendix A in the online supporting information).
In addition, the 95 percent confidence intervals (CI) we report here accounted for the
multilevel sampling design of the PHDCN.
1. Winter and Sampson (2017) used the PHDCN birth cohort data to examine the relationship be-
tween childhood lead exposure and adolescent obesity, anxiety or depression, and impulsivity. By
contrast, the purpose of the present study is to address criminological theory and assess whether
lead exposure is a cause of delinquency. We also build on this prior work by testing the mediating
role of impulsivity and anxiety in explaining the lead­crime association.

276 SAMPSON & WINTER
CHILDHOOD LEAD EXPOSURE
The BLLs of children in Chicago are tested following the Chicago Department of Pub-
lic Health's (CDPH's) recommended schedule of four tests by 36 months of age, with
additional testing until 6 years of age if test results are high or if children move to a
new address. As described elsewhere, most tests are conducted using venous blood sam-
ples, and the remainder using capillary blood samples. Working with CDPH, we matched
identifiable CDPH blood test results between 1995 and 2013 with birth cohort members
present at wave 4.3 The CDPH conducts approximately 77,500 lead tests per year, with
an average of 33 (standard deviation [SD] = 32) lead tests per block group per year. Of
the 378 eligible birth cohort members, 254 were successfully matched with blood lead test
results. These matched records comprised our analytic sample.
We accounted for selection into our analytic sample by adjusting all analyses for
CDPH's lead testing coverage rate in each child's neighborhood. We calculated coverage
rates for 1995, 1996, and 1997 by apportioning all children tested in Chicago (N = 54,703,
82,222, and 79,874, respectively) to their home census block group and dividing by the
total number of children ages 1 to 3 years residing in each block group in each year (esti-
mated from the 1990 and 2000 decennial U.S. censuses, standardized to 2000 block group
boundaries, and then linearly interpolated).4 When calculating these coverage rates, we
first subtracted the number of children in wave 4 of the PHDCN with a blood lead test in
1995, 1996, and/or 1997 from the appropriate neighborhoods' counts in the appropriate
year, so that the lead testing coverage rates we employed were not endogenous with our
individual-level measure of lead exposure. We averaged and then centered the coverage
rates from 1995 to 1997, the period of wave 1 data collection.
To minimize the impact of potential measurement error among blood lead test results
on our analysis, we used children's average BLL (measured in µg/dL) across test results
as our measure of exposure. Because lead is most harmful when ingested at the earliest
stages of development, we excluded blood lead tests conducted at 6 years of age or older
before calculating each child's average BLL. As CDPH's testing recommendations are
not always strictly followed, children in our sample had an average of 2.6 (SD = 1.9)
blood lead tests before the age of 6. The average ages at first and last blood tests are quite
young, at 2.08 (SD = 1.46) and 3.92 (SD = 1.48) years, respectively. These ages align with
the ideal window for capturing lead exposure (Lanphear et al., 2002).
Lead's harmful effects have been detected at very low levels (Lanphear et al., 2005),
and the CDC (1991) maintains that there is no safe level of exposure, instead recom-
mending BLL  5 µg/dL as the "reference level" at which children should be monitored.
Therefore, instead of dichotomizing our continuous measure of children's average BLL
3. Exact as well as "fuzzy" matching on first name, last name, and date of birth was carried out on
children whose caregivers had given consent to checks of health records (greater than 92 percent)
at baseline. All resulting matches were manually reviewed. Consistent with the CDPH's focus on
children at higher risk of lead exposure, children with matching test results are more likely to be
Black or Hispanic and from lower SES backgrounds, relative to all wave 4 birth cohort members.
As noted later, we controlled for race and SES background in our analyses.
4. Most blood lead tests were conducted within this age range. Nevertheless, our results are robust
to using the total number of children ages 1 to 4 or the total number of children ages 1 to 5 as the
denominator in the calculation of this measure. We estimate CDPH's average block group-level
testing coverage to be between 30 percent and 50 percent.
LEAD POISONING AND CRIME 277
at a threshold of "safe" exposure, as done in many previous studies, we maintained chil-
dren's average BLL as a continuous variable in our analyses. Descriptive statistics are
provided in table 1. The mean average BLL in our sample was 6.20 µg/dL (SD = 4.58),
which was higher than the CDC's monitoring threshold.5
DELINQUENT BEHAVIOR
Our primary measure of delinquent behavior was derived from wave 4 of the PHDCN,
when the children in our sample were between 16 and 18 years old--about 15 years, on
average, after measured lead exposure. We used the antisocial behavior scale from the
Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a widely used, reliable, and valid reporting measure
for identifying emotional and behavioral problems linked to delinquency (Achenbach,
1997). The sampled adolescents' primary caregivers were asked whether, within the past
6 months, each of the following items were true of the adolescent: destroys things belong-
ing to his/her family or others; displays cruelty, bullying, or meanness to others; disobe-
dient at school; doesn't seem to feel guilty after misbehaving; and lies or cheats. For each
item, caregivers responded often (2), sometimes (1), or not (0) true. Their answers were
then summed and standardized (mean = 0, SD = 1).
As a validity check and to assess the developmental process of antisocial behavior, we
also employed an average measure of subjects' antisocial behavior from waves 2 and 3,
when the individuals in our sample were much younger--around ages 3 and 5, respec-
tively. The same procedure was used to construct the antisocial behavior scale for each
wave, and the average of the two standardized scores was then calculated, weighted by
the number of items included in each wave's scale. The items that comprise each wave's
scale are in appendix B (in the online supporting information). They are similar to those
listed earlier but account for subjects' younger ages at earlier waves. Because the chil-
dren were very young at waves 2 and 3, this outcome measure presents a strict test of the
hypothesized relationship between lead exposure and antisocial behavior.
OFFICIAL ARREST
We collected official arrest histories to examine the relationship between childhood
lead exposure and contact with the criminal justice system. Under a joint agreement with
the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA), all PHDCN wave 4 respon-
dents were matched by first and last names (including aliases) and date of birth with crim-
inal history record information (CHRI) reported to the state of Illinois and housed by the
Illinois State Police. Respondents were matched with all CHRI records through February
2017, when the birth cohort members were, on average, slightly older than 21 years old.
The CHRI records cover the city of Chicago (from the Chicago Police Department) as
well as all jurisdictions outside the city (approximately 1,200) and include detailed infor-
mation by date on arrests, charges, and sentences. Because the CHRI database reaches
5. In waves 2 and 3 of the PHDCN, children's primary caregivers were asked whether their children
had ever had lead poisoning. Although this survey-reported measure is crude, the mean average
BLL of children for whom caregivers responded yes at either wave is 12.6 µg/dL, more than double
the magnitude of the average BLL of children for whom caregivers responded no at both waves
(5.0 µg/dL). This substantial and significant difference provides an independent validity check on
our blood-level measure of lead exposure.

back to the mid-1990s, the match process captured the period well before the age of first
arrest for the birth cohort. Hence, there was no censoring of the criminal histories.6
DEVELOPMENTAL MEDIATORS
To test our hypothesis that the relationship between lead exposure and antisocial be-
havior is mediated by individuals' impulsive behavior and mental health, we employed
average measures of subjects' impulsivity and anxiety or depression at waves 2 and 3 as
well as comparable measures at wave 4. These measures are derived from the CBCL
and were constructed using the same process described earlier; they were also vali-
dated and examined as outcomes of lead exposure, along with obesity, in Winter and
Sampson (2017). The items that comprise the impulsivity and anxiety or depression scales
at each wave are listed in appendix B in the online supporting information, and descrip-
tive statistics are provided in table 1.
CONTROLS
Our sample was modest in size, so we focused on background characteristics either hy-
pothesized or known to be related to childhood lead exposure and adolescent delinquent
behavior (Lanphear and Roghmann, 1997; Sampson and Laub, 1993): sex; race/ethnicity
(non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, other); the primary caregiver's
immigrant generational status (first generation, second generation, third generation or
greater); the primary caregiver's marital status (married, single, cohabiting); the primary
caregiver's education level (<high school, high school/GED, >high school, bachelor's
degree); and poverty, indicated by whether the primary caregiver received Temporary As-
sistance for Needy Families (TANF).7 These controls were all "pre-treatment" or prior
to childhood lead exposure and derived from the first wave of the PHDCN, which was
conducted soon after the children in our sample were born (mean age 0.64 years, SD =
0.32). We also controlled for the children's age at which our developmental outcomes
were measured--age at wave 4 or average age at waves 2 and 3, as appropriate--since
development closely relates to age. Descriptive statistics are provided in table 1.
Prior research results have demonstrated variations in lead poisoning by neighborhood
racial composition and poverty (Oyana and Margai, 2010; Sampson and Winter, 2016).
To control for these potential confounders, we retrieved data from the 1990 U.S. Census
(standardized to 2000 block group boundaries) to calculate the proportion of individuals
in each child's block group who are non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic, as well as the pro-
portion of individuals below the poverty line (table 1). Like the individual-level covari-
ates, these ecological measures precede lead exposure; they also advance prior research
6. A probabilistic matching algorithm was used to obtain record linkages between our cohort mem-
bers and CHRI records (Devitt and Hughes, 2016). More than 80 percent of the matches yielded
a probability of 100 percent accuracy; more than 90 percent had a probability of 99 percent accu-
racy or higher. The remaining 10 percent of accepted cases were individually checked and deter-
mined to constitute a match. Although the ICJIA data are limited to Illinois records, approximately
90 percent of our sample remained in Illinois at wave 4.
7. Our results are robust to the inclusion of household income and home ownership as measures of
SES, but we employed TANF receipt in our final models because it is a more direct measure of
household deprivation and includes more complete data than on income.

in which either children's environments beyond their homes were ignored or more distal
measures of context were relied on, such as at the state level.
All analyses were restricted to the individuals for whom we had complete information
on all of the measures we employed (see also appendix A in the online supporting infor-
mation). Our primary sample for wave 4 consisted of 212 individuals. Antisocial behavior
in this sample was very similar (mean 0.18, SD = 1.22 when standardized across the full
birth cohort) to the full wave 4 birth cohort (mean 0.12, SD = 1.15), as was the number
of arrests (primary sample: mean 0.90, SD = 2.32; full cohort: mean 0.79, SD = 2.07).
A formal t test of these mean differences revealed no significant differences. Analyses
comprising measures from waves 2 and 3 of the PHDCN included 158 of these 212 in-
dividuals who were present at all waves.8 The wave 2/3 subsample was very similar to
the primary sample in terms of demographic and socioeconomic composition at both the
individual and neighborhood levels. Although our main focus was on the magnitude of
point estimates and their 95 percent confidence intervals, we used both .05 and .10 sig-
nificance levels to reflect the smaller sample size on which the significance statistics were
calculated.
BASELINE RESULTS
Figure 1 reveals a clear gradient relating childhood lead exposure to parent-reported
antisocial behavior in adolescence. Children with higher levels of lead exposure around
age 3 exhibited more antisocial behavior, on average, around age 17 than did those with
lower levels of childhood exposure, with a difference of more than 1 standard deviation
8. Participation in wave 2 of the PHDCN was not a prerequisite for eligibility at wave 4. Thirteen chil-
dren were not present at wave 2, and the remaining were not included because they were missing
parent-reported items from the CBCL scales for waves 2 or 3.
LEAD POISONING AND CRIME 281
between children with high (BLL > 10 µg/dL) and low (BLL  5 µg/dL) levels of ex-
posure. One standard deviation in the wave 4 antisocial behavior scale is the equivalent
of 2.1 points on the raw scale, or a little more than the difference between a parent re-
porting "not true" and "often true" on one of the five CBCL items. Considering anti-
social behavior earlier in childhood, around ages 3 to 5 (waves 2 and 3 of the PHDCN),
yielded a similar although weaker pattern. Although young children with low and medium
(BLL 5­10 µg/dL) levels of lead exposure exhibited similar levels of antisocial behav-
ior, children with high exposure showed much higher levels of parent-reported antisocial
behavior.
We then assessed this relationship using ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression with
our subjects' standardized antisocial behavior scores as the outcome, their average BLL
as the independent variable of theoretical interest, and the set of control variables de-
scribed earlier. Table 2 demonstrates a significant relationship between childhood lead
exposure and antisocial behavior in both childhood and adolescence after our individual-
and neighborhood-level controls are adjusted. A 1-µg/dL increase in average BLL is asso-
ciated with a .07 standard deviation increase in antisocial behavior around age 4 and with
a .09 standard deviation increase around age 17. The latter is equivalent to a .92 point in-
crease in the raw antisocial behavior scale, which ranges from 0 to 10. To understand the
magnitude of this relationship better, we calculated predicted antisocial behavior scores
in adolescence for individuals with mean values of all continuous covariates, mode values
of all categorical covariates, and low (4 µg/dL), medium (7 µg/dL), and high (10 µg/dL)
childhood lead exposure. This calculation yielded predicted standardized antisocial be-
havior scores of -.37, -.12, and .14, respectively, which was a 1.46-point spread on the
raw antisocial behavior scale. The consistency of the relationship between lead exposure
and antisocial behavior over time is indicative of the durable effects of lead exposure
over the early life course. It is notable that no control variable that we included exhibited
a similarly durable association with antisocial behavior.
Despite the theoretically and empirically motivated set of covariates in table 2, it is
possible that the relationship we observed was biased by omitted factors that influenced
both lead exposure and antisocial behavior. To address this possibility, we selectively
controlled for three additional sets of pretreatment (wave 1) covariates that prior find-
ings outside of conventional lead research suggest may be confounders but that we did
not include in our primary models given our limited sample size and, therefore, statis-
tical power. First, results reported in the criminology literature demonstrate that two
household-level measures--household size and whether the primary caregiver was ex-
posed to or involved in domestic violence--may reflect the amount or quality of care
that children receive and, in turn, influence children's exposure to lead as well as their
antisocial behavior (Farrington et al., 2001; Sampson and Laub, 1993). Second, neigh-
borhood collective efficacy and violence tap neighborhood processes that may influence
children's exposure to environmental toxins and antisocial behavior (Sampson, 2012;
Sharkey, 2013). Third, we controlled for ecological measures from the Systematic Social
Observation component of the PHDCN (Sampson, 2012: 88­90) that tap environmental
decay (e.g., vacant houses; burned out, boarded up, or abandoned commercial buildings;
badly deteriorated residential units or recreational facilities) and other signs of physical
disorder as well as neighborhood housing vacancy taken from the 1990 U.S. Census (see
also Sampson and Winter, 2016: 266­7). As shown in appendix C (in the online supporting

information), the findings in table 2 are robust to adding these sets of additional covari-
ates to our models; in fact, the coefficients of lead on antisocial behavior at waves 2/3 and
wave 4 are unchanged.
MATCHING STRATEGY
Although the OLS results are stable with additional controls, lack of balance or over-
lap among our covariates by levels of lead exposure could also bias estimates. Consistent
with our recent work in which we examined the impact of childhood lead exposure on
adolescent health (Winter and Sampson, 2017), we employed coarsened exact matching
(CEM) to improve balance and ensure overlap in the joint distribution of our covariates--
including interactions--among children with high and low levels of lead exposure. CEM
is a nonparametric matching strategy that is robust to measurement error and that strictly
bounds the degree of model dependence (Iacus, King, and Porro, 2012). CEM uses an au-
tomatic binning algorithm to coarsen values of specified covariates and then exact match
observations based on these coarsened values. Observations in both the treatment and
control groups without an exact match are dropped (Blackwell et al., 2009) to ensure that
subsequent analyses do not extrapolate beyond the data, which would lead to increased
model dependence (Iacus, King, and Porro, 2012).
Based on CDC guidelines, we define the treatment group as those with an aver-
age BLL  6 µg/dL to implement CEM and match our observations on a core set
of individual- and neighborhood-level indicators. Our selection of indicators balances
our need for a matched sample that is large enough for generating estimates with our
goal of achieving balance among covariates and their interactions. We matched on chil-
dren's gender and race/ethnicity and the primary caregivers' immigrant generational sta-
tus, marital status, education level, and TANF receipt. At the neighborhood level, we
included meaningful dichotomous indicators of children's environments--whether chil-
dren's neighborhoods at wave 1 were predominantly (70 percent) Black and whether
their neighborhoods at wave 1 were characterized by high poverty rates (30 percent
below the poverty line). For our primary sample of 212 children and our waves 2/3 sub-
sample of 158 children, this specification resulted in 82 and 63 matched observations
with all covariates available, respectively, 34 and 26 of which had an average BLL 
6 µg/dL.
The L1
statistic is a multivariate measure of overall imbalance among covariates that
ranges from 0 to 1, with larger values indicating greater imbalance between the treatment
and control groups (Blackwell et al., 2009: 530). When L1
was calculated based on the
measures we employed in our match, implementing CEM reduced the imbalance in our
sample from .71 to nearly 0. Panel A of table 3 presents means for our control variables
separated by treatment (BLL  6 µg/dL) and control (BLL < 6 µg/dL) group as well as
the mean differences on each covariate before and after implementing CEM. Although
the goal of CEM is to reduce imbalance on the multivariate distribution of covariates, it is
apparent from table 3, panel A, that implementing CEM also reduces bias and improves
balance for most of our control variables individually, especially for race, immigrant sta-
tus, marital status, and neighborhood poverty. Even though the balance is not perfect
when control variables are considered individually, there are no significant mean differ-
ences in covariates between control and treatment groups following CEM.

NOTES: To perform CEM, treatment and control groups were matched on children's gender and race/ethnicity; primary caregivers' immigrant generational status,
marital status, education level, and TANF receipt; and whether the child's neighborhood at wave 1 was predominantly (70 percent) Black and whether the child's
neighborhood at wave 1 was characterized by a high poverty rate (30 percent below the poverty line). After CEM, OLS models (panel B) control for child's age
at wave 4 or average age at waves 2 and 3, gender, and race/ethnicity; primary caregiver's immigrant generational status, marital status, education level, and TANF
receipt; and the proportion of the child's residential neighborhood that is non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, below the poverty line, and tested for lead exposure.

We estimated the same OLS models described earlier on our matched samples. Specif-
ically, our subjects' standardized antisocial behavior scores was the outcome, their av-
erage BLL was the independent variable of theoretical interest, and we controlled for
the variables shown in table 3, panel A, to address any residual confounding that re-
mains after CEM. In these models, weights produced by the CEM algorithm were also
used that account for the differential sizes of the matched groups of observations. The
results of these models, presented in table 3, panel B, constitute estimates of the rela-
tionship between lead exposure and antisocial behavior, conditional on covariates, for
the matched subsamples of our data for which there is common multivariate support.
The results are very similar to those obtained following OLS among our full sample.
Estimating OLS models on our matched sample, we found that a 1-µg/dL increase in
average BLL is associated with a .10 standard deviation increase in antisocial behav-
ior around age 4 and with a .11 standard deviation increase around age 17 (table 3,
panel B).
In brief, the results in tables 2 and 3 demonstrate that our findings for adolescent delin-
quent behavior are consistent across alternative and very different sample specifications.
Not only are the estimated relationships between childhood lead exposure and antiso-
cial behavior among the smaller CEM sample statistically significant and in the same di-
rections as the relationships estimated among the full sample, but also their magnitudes
are quite similar. This is true whether antisocial behavior is considered around age 4 or
around age 17, and when additional control variables at the household and neighborhood
levels are added to the full sample models as robustness checks.9
INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE STRATEGY
Our final strategy accounted for potential omitted variable bias by using an instrumen-
tal variable (IV) strategy to isolate a portion of co-variation between lead exposure and
antisocial behavior that is not a result of unobserved factors that are simultaneously influ-
encing both (Muller, Winship, and Morgan, 2014; Murnane and Willett, 2010). To isolate
this "pure" portion of the co-variation, the IV is assumed (a) to be exogenous conditional
on covariates, (b) to relate to childhood lead exposure (relevance), and (c) to not directly
relate to antisocial behavior (exclusion restriction). If these conditions are satisfied, we
can isolate the variation in childhood lead exposure that is a result of the IV in a first-stage
regression, and then we can examine the relationship between this exogenous variation
in lead exposure and antisocial behavior in a second-stage regression. Limited informa-
tion maximum likelihood (LIML) estimation is often recommended for IV models over a
two-stage, least-squares regression in the presence of small samples and potentially weak
instruments (Angrist and Pischke, 2009: 213; Staiger and Stock, 1997). Accordingly, we
employed LIML IV, but the results following two-stage, least-squares regression were
nearly identical.
9. The results following CEM are also robust to alternative specifications of our matching algorithm
that are both more and less parsimonious. For example, the results in table 3 are very similar when
including indicators of, among other variables, whether children's neighborhoods at wave 1 were
predominantly (70 percent) Hispanic and whether the primary caregiver was exposed to domestic
violence at wave 1 in the CEM algorithm.
LEAD POISONING AND CRIME 287
Theory and research introduced earlier on the risk of lead exposure from soil contami-
nated by smelting plants informed our selection of an appropriate IV (Albalak et al., 2003;
Landrigan et al., 1975; Vargas et al., 2001). Many smelting plants never underwent proper
environmental remediation, and even if plants were closed, lead in the surrounding soil
decays at a very slow rate. These facts and prior research findings support our hypothesis
that proximity to historic or contemporary smelting plants will increase childhood BLL
by exposing very young children to remnants of lead in the soil that are ingested through
normal hand-to-mouth behavior after being tracked into homes or while playing outside
(see also CDC, 1991; Lanphear et al., 2002; Winter and Sampson, 2017). We thus collected
the locations of more than 65 historical smelting plants that produced lead-based toxins
in Chicago from a 2001 investigative study in which researchers built on earlier U.S. Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency (EPA) assessments (Eckel, Rabinowitz, and Foster, 2001).
We geocoded plant locations at the address level and calculated the number of meters
from the home of each birth cohort member at wave 1 to the nearest smelting plant. We
included sites at which smelting plants were shut down because lead persists in the soil.
At wave 1, the average distance to a smelter in our sample was 2,257 meters (median
1,630 meters), but there was considerable variation (SD = 1,687 meters; table 1).
The fact that the public and even environmental professionals were mostly unaware of
the soil lead exposure risks posed by many of these plants until recently, especially plants
that were shuttered, adds support to our assumption of exogeneity. Put differently, we
assume that parents did not select into or out of neighborhoods based on the treatment
(distance to nearest smelting plant), conditional on observed confounders at the indi-
vidual and neighborhood levels (e.g., poverty and race).10 Consistent with the exclusion
restriction, we also have no reason to expect that distance to smelters at age 3 has a direct
effect on adolescent antisocial behavior, conditional on observed confounders, other than
through lead exposure. Although these assumptions cannot be empirically tested, we are
not aware of research findings that call them into question.
Table 4 presents the results of the first-stage regressions of our IV models, which model
average childhood BLL as a function of the same set of control variables as those in our
baseline OLS model (see table 2) and our IV, distance to the nearest smelter at wave 1. In
addition to straight-line distance, we also estimated models that use logged distance and
logged childhood BLL. As hypothesized, living farther from a smelting plant at birth is
significantly associated with lower childhood lead exposure across both specifications in
our first-stage regressions (table 4). Importantly, as shown in the diagnostics section at the
bottom of the table, smelting plant exposure contributes independent explanatory power
to our first-stage models. For example, in the second column of table 4 in which adolescent
antisocial behavior (wave 4) is considered and straight-line distance to the nearest smelter
is used as the IV, adding our IV to the otherwise complete first-stage model increases its
R2 from .20 to .28; in the logged model, the corresponding R2 increase is from .27 to .35.
The F statistics for the first stages of our models of adolescent antisocial behavior also
10. The map of smelter locations in Chicago (appendix D in the online supporting information) shows
that they are not concentrated only in areas of poverty and racial segregation. Among our full
sample, the individual-level correlations of the proportions of children's residential neighborhoods
that are non-Hispanic Black and below the poverty line with distance in meters to the nearest
smelter are similarly not large, at .10 and ­.36, respectively.

indicate that our instrument is sufficiently strong as they both exceed Stock and Yogo's
(2005) widely used "rule of thumb" value of 10.11
Table 4 also presents the second-stage results for antisocial behavior around age 4
(waves 2/3) and age 17 (wave 4) as a function of our baseline set of control variables
and lead exposure (or logged lead exposure) estimated from the first-stage regressions.
Using straight-line distance to the nearest smelting plant as the IV produces results very
similar in magnitude to OLS, although standard errors are larger and the estimate is not
significant at conventional levels (p < .104). A 1-µg/dL increase in average BLL is asso-
ciated with a .03 standard deviation increase in antisocial behavior around age 4 and with
a .12 standard deviation increase around age 17.
The results are significant (p < .10) for both waves 2/3 and wave 4, however, when
we consider the logged distance models. To aid interpretation of the magnitude of the
long-term effects estimated by these models, we calculated predicted antisocial behav-
ior scores for adolescents with mean values of continuous covariates, mode values of
11. This rule of thumb is approximate, however, and is conservative because it is designed to rule out
the possibility that weak instrument bias exceeds 10 percent of the bias associated with OLS. F
values between 5 and 10, such as seen for our waves 2/3 outcome, are often still considered valid
in the IV literature (e.g., Nunn and Wantchekon, 2011: 162) but should nonetheless be viewed
cautiously.
290 SAMPSON & WINTER
categorical covariates, and low (4 µg/dL), medium (7 µg/dL), and high (10 µg/dL) child-
hood lead exposure. This calculation yielded predicted standardized antisocial behavior
scores of -.56, -.06, and .26, respectively, which is a 1.86-point spread on the raw antiso-
cial behavior scale (the equivalent calculation for straight-line distance yields a 1.74-point
spread on the raw scale), illustrating the substantive consequences of increased childhood
lead exposure for antisocial behavior later in the life course.
Our IV is conservative because smelting plant exposure is measured when the birth
cohort members were just born. As families may have moved while the children were still
young and vulnerable to lead exposure, we created a second measure of smelting plant
exposure that averages distance (in meters) to the nearest smelting plant from wave 1 and
wave 2 when birth cohort members were around age 3. The coefficients on adolescent an-
tisocial behavior using this cumulative exposure measure (both straight line and logged
distance), presented in appendix E of the online supporting information, are both signif-
icant and larger than those in table 4. In short, under the assumption that smelting plant
proximity in early childhood influences antisocial behavior in late adolescence through
the pathway of childhood lead exposure, conditional on measured individual and neigh-
borhood covariates, the IV models generally support a causal interpretation of the lead
exposure coefficient.
MEDIATING PROCESSES
The results in tables 2 to 4 support the hypotheses that 1) there is a long-term link be-
tween childhood lead exposure and antisocial behavior in later adolescence, and 2) this
relationship is plausibly causal in nature. Prior research findings linking childhood lead
exposure to later impulsivity and impaired mental health (Winter and Sampson, 2017) as
well as associations among impulsivity, mental health problems, and antisocial behavior
in the criminological literature (Elliott, Huizinga, and Menard, 1989; Farrington, 1998;
Gottfredson and Hirschi, 1990) motivate our third question identified earlier: Is the rela-
tionship between lead exposure and antisocial behavior partially mediated by individuals'
impulsive behavior and mental health?
We employed OLS regression to assess whether there is descriptive evidence of po-
tential mediating pathways that would justify further tests for causal mediation. Adoles-
cent antisocial behavior was our outcome of interest, and along with average childhood
BLL and our set of covariates, we included parent-reported measures of impulsivity
and anxiety or depression. Model 1 in table 5 first shows that even though antiso-
cial behavior around age 4 predicts antisocial behavior in later adolescence, providing
a validity check of our measures, it primarily does not mediate the relationship between
childhood lead exposure and antisocial behavior in adolescence. Childhood impulsivity
(table 5, model 2) and anxiety or depression (table 5, model 4) also do not appear to me-
diate lead's effects on antisocial behavior. In stricter tests, although adolescent impulsive
behavior (table 5, model 3) and anxiety or depression (table 5, model 5) both significantly
relate to adolescent antisocial behavior, consistent with the results of prior research, in-
cluding these measures in our model only accounts for a small portion of the relationship
between childhood lead exposure and antisocial behavior in later adolescence.
Although table 5 does not provide descriptive evidence that impulsivity and impaired
mental health mediate the relationship between childhood lead exposure and antiso-
cial behavior in adolescence, the data do not allow us to be fully confident that these

mediating relationships are absent. Ideally, we would add self-reported or teacher-
reported behaviors to these measures as well as measures of impulsivity and anxiety
or depression taken in adolescence but before age 17 (wave 4). For present purposes,
however, we can safely conclude that the biological assays of lead exposure in childhood
directly predict adolescent antisocial behavior using three different modeling strategies
and controlling for theoretically informed confounding factors and potential mediating
pathways.
OFFICIAL ARREST
As reviewed earlier, some researchers have identified a relationship between lead ex-
posure and arrest. We theorized that any such relationship would operate through cur-
rent behavior as police officers do not observe an individual's lead exposure from many
years prior. Given the skewed distribution of arrests in our sample, we tested this final
hypothesis using a negative binomial regression model to examine the relationships be-
tween childhood lead exposure, adolescent antisocial behavior, and cohort members' ar-
rest counts through February 2017.
On average, childhood lead exposure was slightly higher among those in our sample
who had been arrested (6.55 µg/dL, SD = 3.56) than among those who had never been ar-
rested (6.10 µg/dL, SD = 4.87), and even higher among those who had been arrested for a
violent crime (7.55 µg/dL, SD = 3.82). Table 6, however, reveals that these differences are
a weak signal and not statistically significant--childhood lead exposure on its own does
not directly relate to arrests of any type, controlling for our covariates. This result holds
when effect heterogeneity is considered by gender, race/ethnicity, immigrant generation,

primary caregiver education level, neighborhood racial composition, and neighborhood
SES. At a basic level, then, there is no direct relationship to mediate between lead ex-
posure and arrest in our sample. This finding is somewhat surprising given that we have
already shown that lead toxicity directly predicts antisocial behavior, and the results of
considerable prior research in criminology lead us to expect that antisocial behavior is in
turn positively related to arrest. This is in fact the case: Table 6 shows that antisocial be-
havior robustly and significantly relates to arrest.12 This finding holds whether we consider
arrests for any crime type, arrests for violent crime, arrests for property crime, or arrests
for nonviolent and nonproperty crimes.13 Additionally, Judd and Kenny (1981:207) argue
that mediation can exist in long-term developmental or life-course processes even if there
is a weak relationship between the independent and final dependent variables.
The results in table 6 are robust to employing logistic regression and a dichotomous
outcome measure of whether an individual has ever been arrested. In addition, the results
in table 6 include our full analytic sample regardless of whether individuals continued to
live in Illinois after wave 1 of the PHDCN and are, therefore, conservative. When we
restrict the sample to those still living in Illinois at wave 4 (N = 189), the patterns are
the same. Accordingly, the results in table 6 and associated robustness checks establish
a sturdy and expected association between adolescent antisocial behavior and arrest, but
there is no direct association between early lead exposure and arrest.
DISCUSSION
We have presented new evidence of a consistent link between childhood lead ex-
posure and antisocial behavior in both childhood and later adolescence, with an esti-
mated magnitude of effect greater than many standard predictors in criminology. Al-
though the evidence comes from a prospective birth cohort representative of children
12. Because some arrests can and do occur prior to the measurement of antisocial behavior in adoles-
cence, this test is conservative and we do not consider the estimates to be causal.
13. Although lead exposure is negatively related to arrests for property crime, this is a fragile result
that only emerges once antisocial behavior is controlled, as shown in the table.
LEAD POISONING AND CRIME 293
growing up in Chicago in the mid-1990s, we acknowledge several limitations. Not all
children were tested for lead, and our sample is limited to one city at baseline. The
sample is also small, so our power to detect differences was constrained. Future re-
search from other places and with larger samples is needed, as is measurement of
additional mediating processes through which lead's effects might be exacerbated or alle-
viated. In particular, we did not find that impulsivity or mental health problems explained
the association between lead and antisocial behavior, but research is needed with ad-
ditional measures of children's early environments; children's interactions with parents,
peers, and teachers; and individual differences in cognitive development and personality.
Unlike delinquent behavior, we found no association between lead exposure and offi-
cial arrests, which is consistent with the findings reported by Beckley et al. (2017) in New
Zealand. The results of the few prior studies in the United States that revealed a link
between childhood lead exposure and arrest at the individual level were mostly based on
older samples with higher average levels of childhood lead exposure. For example, the
disadvantaged Cincinnati cohort studied by Wright and colleagues (2008) was born be-
tween 1979 and 1984 and had a mean childhood BLL of 13.4 µg/dL. Any effects of lead
exposure on antisocial behavior and, in turn, arrest may have been more pronounced. By
contrast, the children in our birth cohort sample had mean levels of BLL less than half
of the Cincinnati cohort (ß6.0 µg/dL) and came of age during a later period of rapidly
declining crime in Chicago. Hence, there are fewer arrests before age 21 in recent versus
older cohorts, and the link between behavior and arrest may be weaker in the current era
of criminal justice processing than in the past. This may help to explain the smaller ex-
planatory power of lead exposure and of antisocial behavior in the model of arrest records
for our birth cohort. Consistent with this possibility, in analyses not shown, we found that
impulsivity has a stronger relationship to arrest in the older (9, 15) PHDCN cohorts than
in the birth cohort. Consider too that official arrests are produced by a combination of
adolescent delinquent behavior and institutional practices, such as police discretion to ar-
rest conditional on an encounter or variation in the quality of record-keeping systems.
Future research is needed to determine whether the results in table 6 represent a period
effect, a measurement artifact, arrest bias, the malleability and nondeterministic nature
of behavioral responses to lead exposure, especially at lower levels, or some combination
thereof.
It also bears emphasis that even though our results give credence to an individual-level
link between lead exposure and antisocial behavior, they do not in and of themselves
adjudicate whether reductions in lead exposure beginning in the 1970s contributed to the
national crime drop of the 1990s. Such an aggregate-level and time-series link is a separate
empirical question. Future research is needed to address the empirical validity of any
national-level explanations especially that account for conflicting indicators of when and
how much crime decreased in relation to the ban on lead in gasoline (Lauritsen, Rezey,
and Heimer, 2016).
ASSESSING CAUSALITY
Is the relationship we observed between lead exposure and individual antisocial be-
havior causal? Beyond statistical issues, a core advantage of blood lead levels relative to
typical individual characteristics that are assessed in criminology is that lead is an exter-
nal toxin, with age-graded mechanisms of damage experienced at very early ages--before
294 SAMPSON & WINTER
children select their environments. Our indicator of lead exposure is also based on mul-
tiple biological tests, attenuating measurement error. On the one hand, then, lead expo-
sure offers distinct analytic leverage. On the other hand, there could still be potential
confounding in how children are exposed to lead, and true experimentation in this case is
both unethical and impossible.
We addressed the causal challenge by employing a set of covariates rooted in prior re-
search in public health and criminology. We also used multiple analytic tools, including
OLS, coarsened exact matching on key predictors of lead exposure, and a theoretically in-
formed and arguably exogenous instrumental variable, distance to smelting plants. Since
the locations of smelting plants in Chicago are variable relative to poverty and race, and
many were either closed or not thought to be toxic, it is reasonable to assume a lack of
neighborhood selection on distance to a smelter at baseline and no direct pathway to an-
tisocial behavior in late adolescence (again, conditional on our observable measures of
individual background and neighborhood context). CEM makes very different assump-
tions and is based on a subsample of our data with balanced covariates, yet it produced
very similar results to both our OLS and IV models. This convergence gives us cautious
but increased confidence in the underlying pattern.
THEORETICAL AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS
Balancing the strengths and limitations of the data, the weight of the evidence leads
us to call for increased attention to lead exposure specifically, as well as to toxic inequal-
ity more generally, in the field of criminology. Doing so broadens the reach of life-course
and developmental criminological theory in several ways. For one, lead poisoning takes its
toll very early in the life course--almost out of the starting gate. For another, the finding
that lead exposure is linked to antisocial behavior challenges criminologists to conceive
of individual differences in crime propensity as stemming from more than just genetic,
family, situational, or neighborhood social environments--it is also constituted by the
broader ecological context and, in the present case, by structurally and historically shaped
lead exposure. The results bear similarly on the influential discussion in economics by
Heckman, Humphries, and Kautz (2014) on the formation of what they called noncog-
nitive skills or "character," which overlaps considerably with behaviors long studied by
criminologists, such as antisocial behavior and self-control (Gottfredson and Hirschi,
1990). Integrating environmental theories of lead exposure with both criminological and
economic perspectives on individual differences in the formation of character is thus a
promising avenue of future research (Sampson, 2016).
Our results also offer a novel way to interpret "child effects" on parental behavior. As
Lytton (1990) highlighted in his influential review, there is consistent evidence that diffi-
cult behavior in children (e.g., aggression, impulsivity, and restlessness) provokes parental
frustration and often rejection or hostility, which in turn further increases child antiso-
cial behavior (see also Sampson and Laub, 1993; West and Farrington, 1977). But if our
research findings are any guide, child effects are not solely that--they can be conceptual-
ized in part as environmental effects on parenting that are mediated by the child's impair-
ment from lead exposure. As Bellinger (2017: 1219) argued, family practices and attitudes
related to raising children, which are typically considered as an independent variable in
criminology, may in fact be affected by the aberrant behaviors of a lead-exposed child.
More generally, our results point to the utility of considering lead's early impact on the
LEAD POISONING AND CRIME 295
brain and neurotransmitter systems, which increases the likelihood of children and ado-
lescents responding to challenges in their social contexts in ways that provoke rejection
by parents and, we further hypothesize, larger society (e.g., teachers and neighbors).
Finally, our results and the more general idea of poisoned child development have im-
plications for policy in ways different from the usual. Criminological policy normally looks
to actions governed by the criminal justice system, such as by the police or courts. But lead
exposure is rightly categorized as an environmental hazard, and its distribution through-
out the population is determined by business decisions (e.g., where to locate an indus-
trial plant or whether to comply with local regulations) and myriad government policies
and actions, such as federal policies set by the EPA, proper maintenance of the water
supply by local municipalities, the remediation of contaminated soil, and the enforce-
ment of restrictions on lead paint in rental units (Markowitz and Rosner, 2013; Muller,
Sampson, and Winter, 2018). Although these are "noncrime" policies, they are potentially
relevant to reducing crime. To paraphrase Reyes (2007), we suggest that environmental
policy is sound criminological policy as well. Agnew (2011) made a similar point with re-
spect to how climate change policies bear on both criminal behavior and individual traits.
If we accept this argument, then our results, combined with the continued threat of lead
and other toxins in the environment, take on new meaning. Indeed, environmental reg-
ulations are being radically rewritten in the current era, with implications for the future
quality of water, soil, and air (Lipton, 2017).
The field of criminology would thus benefit by expanding its traditional focus on crim-
inal justice institutions to include a more direct engagement with environmental policy
(Lynch, Stretesky, and Long, 2015). Lead exposure also tends to be systematically con-
centrated in racially segregated and high-poverty neighborhoods (Hanna-Attisha et al.,
2016; Sampson and Winter, 2016), connecting environmental and criminological pol-
icy to social inequality (Muller, Sampson, and Winter, 2018). At the very least, the
vigorous remediation of lingering lead toxicity, especially in disadvantaged neighbor-
hoods, is a policy effort that is both effective and potentially consequential for children's
development.
