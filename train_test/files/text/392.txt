Awareness of Community-Based Long-Term
Care and Services

ABSTRACT. This study used data from the Community Partnership for
Older Adults Program Survey (N = 4,611) to examine associations between
the perceived awareness of community-based long-term care and supportive
services and the anticipation for aging in place and relocation. Respondents
varied substantially in their knowledge about services and anticipation for
aging in place and relocation. Perceived availability and unavailability of a
series of community services was associated with the likelihood of antici-
pating aging in place and relocation, and awareness of the lack of visiting
nurses, personal assistance, or transportation was related to respondents re-
porting a younger age at which they anticipated needing help to age in place
or anticipating a need to relocate. Findings have implications for raising the
public awareness of community-based services in addressing the needs of
community-dwelling elders for aging in place and relocation.

INTRODUCTION
A majority of older Americans prefer to age in place and stay in their
own home (AARP, 2000) or at least continue to live in the community as
long as possible (Burr, Mutchler, & Warren, 2005). Recent policy and ser-
vice initiatives have endeavored to address the desires to age in place and
improve the quality of life among an expanding older population (Rowles,
1993; Summer, 2005). One strategy is to expand home- and community-
based services by improving local service infrastructures and community
partnerships (Bolda, Saucier, Maddox, Wetle, & Lowe, 2006). The provi-
sion of a variety of flexible services under innovative delivery systems will
help meet the changing needs of older adults and facilitate aging in place.
Services required by older adults at home with long-term care needs
include in-home services like home care, home health services, home-
delivered meals, and home improvement programs as well as community-
based services such as senior centers, adult day care, and transportation
programs. When confronted with a health crisis, older adults and their fam-
ily caregivers have to consider alternative options such as assisted living or
nursing homes if the existing care arrangement no longer meets their needs
(Nakashima, Chapin, Macmillan, & Zimmerman, 2004). In fact, appropri-
ate use of in-home and community-based services was related to delaying
nursing home placement, reversing deterioration of physical functioning,
and increasing survival (Gaugler & Zarit, 2001; McCann et al., 2005).
Using national longitudinal data, Gaugler et al. (2005) documented
that earlier use of in-home services by family caregivers of older adults
with dementia predicted a delay in institutionalization. Burr et al. (2005)
found that older unmarried women with functional limitations experienced
a reduced risk of institutionalization when states increased spending for
home and community-based services. Albert, Simone, Brassard, Stern, and
Mayeux (2005) found that Medicaid home care service use was linked with
a significantly reduced risk of death among older adults with disabilities
in activities of daily living. These studies demonstrated that appropriate
or early use of in-home and community-based services would promote
aging in place by delaying institutionalization and avoiding its deleterious
consequences among certain groups of frail older adults.
As posited from the behavioral model of health service use (Ander-
son, 1968), awareness of services enabled the use of services. Indeed,
knowledge or awareness of a service was found to be one predictor of ser-
vice use (Calsyn & Rades, 1993). Similarly, qualitative studies found that
lack of knowledge about available services was a major barrier to access to
406 JOURNAL OF HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY
and utilization of these services for community-dwelling older adults (Gal-
lagher & Truglio-Londrigan, 2004; Hare, Rogers, Lester, McManus, &
Mant, 2005). Lack of knowledge derived partly from older adults' poor
understanding of agency policies and practices and partly from deficiencies
in community networks (Moyer, Coristine, Roberger, & O'Hagan, 1999).
Prior to using services, older adults must have the means and knowledge
of how to get the services and make use of them, though it remains unclear
whether knowledge of services is related to actual planning for aging in
place. Much previous research profiled the effects of using community-
based services; however, little research to date has been done regarding
the effects of awareness of these services on anticipatory aging in place or
relocation. This study, which was designed to examine the association be-
tween awareness of services and the anticipation for aging in place versus
relocation, has implications for disseminating accurate information regard-
ing the availability of community-based long-term care and services and
calibrating these services to fit the changing needs of an aging individual
and an aging community.
In this study, we sought to understand whether perceived awareness of
services was related to anticipation for aging-in-place and relocation and
whether awareness of services was associated with the predicted age for
staying at home and relocating. This study used the Community Partnership
for Older Adults (CPFOA) Survey of Older Adults, a representative sample
of adults aged 50 years or older from 13 communities. Taking a prospective
approach, the survey asked the age at which the respondent expected to
live on one's own under regular help and when to move out because of
health problems, and it examined the awareness of the un/availability of an
array of community-based services. Specifically, we asked the following
questions:
1. What are the characteristics of adults with the anticipation for aging
in place?
2. What are the characteristics of adults with the anticipation for
relocation?
3. Is perceived awareness of community-based long-term care and ser-
vices associated with the anticipation for aging in place?
4. Is perceived awareness of community-based long-term care and ser-
vices associated with the anticipation for relocation?
5. Is perceived awareness of community-based long-term care and ser-
vices associated with the expected age at which participants would
need help to age in place?

METHODS
Data
The data for this study were drawn from the CPFOA Survey of Older
Adults. As an initiative of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the
CPFOA was aimed at improving long-term care and supportive service
systems for older adults through sustaining local community-based part-
nerships. The local community was composed of older adults, health and
social service providers, Area Agencies on Aging, government and busi-
ness leaders, and local funders (Bolda et al., 2006). The survey was part of
the evaluation of the CPFOA program, which was designed to identify older
adults at risk of needing long-term care and assess gaps in their knowledge
about the options available (Black & Brown, 2004). A telephone survey was
conducted among a representative sample of adults aged 50 years and older
in 13 communities that had been awarded development grants by the CP-
FOA program. These communities were located in Boston, Massachusetts;
Broome County, New York; Chittenden and Grand Isle Counties,
Vermont; Columbia and Union Counties, Arkansas; El Paso County, Texas;
Fulton County, Georgia; Houston/Harris County, Texas; Maui Island,
Hawaii; Milwaukee County, Wisconsin; Riverside County, California; San
Francisco, California; St. Clair County, Missouri; and Upper Peninsula,
Missouri.
Households in these communities were selected using list-assisted ran-
dom digit-dialing, and one respondent from each eligible household was
randomly selected (Black & Brown, 2004). A total of 5,298 older adults
were interviewed in 2002. The response rate averaged 63% across the
13 sites, ranging from 53% to 71% in individual communities (Black &
Brown, 2004). People aged 75 years and older were overrepresented in this
study, consisting of about 25.3% in the population aged 50 years and older.
The 2000 U.S. census estimated that about 21.6% of those aged 50 years
and older were aged 75 years and older (U.S. Census of Bureau, 2001).
For this study, the sample was restricted to older adults who were living
independently either in a rented place or one's own place at the survey time
(N = 4,611), excluding those living in a nursing home, a group home, an
assisted living facility, or with a relative in the relative's home.

MEASURES
Perceived Awareness of Community-Based Long-Term Care
and Supportive Services
Respondents were asked if an array of long-term care and support-
ive services were available in their community. These long-term care and
supportive services included senior centers, adult day programs, house-
keeping services, senior lunch programs, a telephone helpline, home re-
pair assistance, visiting nursing services, personal assistance, door-to-door
transportation, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and hospice care.
A three-category response was used: (0) no, (1) yes, or (2) don't know.
Each of these 12 variables was dummy-coded, and the "don't know" group
was used as the reference variable in the analysis of the relationships with
anticipations for aging-in-place planning and relocation, respectively.
Anticipation for Aging in Place or Relocation
Two questions were asked to respondents about their anticipation for ag-
ing in place and relocation, "At what age do you think you will need regular
help to remain living on your own?" and "At what age do you think you will
no longer be able to live in your current home because of physical or mental
health problems?" The answers ranged from (1) younger than 60 years to
(11) never. However, approximately 38% and 44% of participants, respec-
tively, reported that they did not know at what age they would need help
to remain living on their own or need to move out. Thus two dichotomous
variables--aging-in-place anticipation and relocation anticipation--were
first created to capture those who anticipated an age at which they would
need help or move out (1 = yes) or those who had no idea at what age they
would need help or move out (0 = no). Those who answered they would
never need help or move out were categorized into the "don't know" groups
because the response indicated that they would never anticipate aging in
place or relocation based on these services. As a result, approximately
48% and 56% respondents, respectively, did not anticipate aging in place
or relocation (Table 1). Bivariate analysis indicated that these two groups
of respondents were different and approximately 36% had anticipations
for both aging in place and relocation. These two variables were used as
dependent measures in logistic regressions to answer research questions 3
and 4 regarding the relationship between perceived awareness of services
and aging-in-place/relocation anticipation.

To further examine whether the perceived awareness of services was
related to the age at which older adults expected to need help to age
in place or would need to move, two new continuous variables--aging-
in-place anticipation age and relocation anticipation age--were created
and used to answer research questions 5 and 6 regarding the relationship
between perceived awareness of services and anticipation age for aging
in place or relocation. The mean age for anticipated help to age in place
fell between ranges 75­79 and 80--84, and the mean age for anticipated
relocation was between ranges 80­84 and 85­89 (Table 1).
Control Variables
Control variables included age, gender, education, annual household in-
come, housing type, living arrangement, home repair need, community
rating, self-rated health, and long-term care use. Age was a categori-
cal variable, ranging from (1) 50 to 64 years to (5) 85 years and older.
Gender was dichotomized into female or male. Due to the empirical dis-
tribution, education was categorized into (0) less than high school, high
410 JOURNAL OF HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY
school/GED, or (1) some college, college degree, or advanced degree. The
original 8-level income variable was recoded into (1) less than $10,000, (2)
$10,000­$39,999, (3) $40,000­$74,999, or (4) $75,000 or more. These cut-
offs were chosen because they were close to the average poverty threshold
(i.e., $12,334) and the median household income of $44,389 for a family
of two in 2004 (DeNavas-Walt, Proctor, & Lee, 2005). The 4-level mea-
sure was used in bivariate analyses for characteristics by aging-in-place
and relocation anticipation of respondents (research questions 1 and 2).
The original 8-level income variable was treated as continuous in multiple
regressions to answer research questions 3 through 6. Housing type was
measured by (0) living in a rented place or (1) living in one's own place.
Living arrangement was coded into (0) living alone or (1) living with oth-
ers. Respondents were asked if their current residence needed significant
repairs, modifications, or changes to improve their ability to live in it over
the next 5 years, with responses coded (0) no or (1) yes. Community rating
was measured by the response to the question "Overall, how would you
rate your community as a place to live?" Four-category responses were
available and ranged from (1) excellent to (4) poor. Self-rated health was
measured by (1) excellent, (2) very good, (3) good, (4) fair, or (5) poor.
Long-term care use was indicated by use of any one of three long-term
care services (i.e., nursing home, assisted living facility, or hospice care)
within the past 3 months. It was coded into (1) yes for anyone indicating
the use of any service, or (0) no for those having not used any service
before.
DATA ANALYSIS
The analysis proceeded in two steps. First, we conducted bivariate ex-
aminations of anticipations (yes/no) for aging in place and relocation with
background variables to answer research questions 1 and 2. Next, to an-
swer research questions 3 and 4, we conducted a series of logistic regres-
sion analyses to examine whether perceived awareness of services--either
availability or unavailability--was related to anticipating aging in place or
relocation. To answer research questions 5 and 6, we conducted a series of
normal multivariate regressions to examine whether perceived awareness
of services was associated with the age at which older adults anticipated to
need help to remain living on their own or to move out because of health
problems.

RESULTS
Perceived awareness of community-based long-term care and services
varied substantially among adults living independently either in rented
places or in their own places. As seen in Figure 1, the proportion of older
adults who were aware of the availability of services ranged from ap-
proximately 37% (home repair assistance) to 88% (nursing home). Corre-
spondingly, approximately 7% did not know about nursing home facilities,
whereas 47% were unaware of home repair services. Generally, a smaller
proportion reported services were not available in the community com-
pared to those unaware of these services, from 4% for senior center to 16%
for home repair (see Figure 1).
Table 2 presents frequency distributions of background variables and
their bivariate associations with aging-in-place anticipation. In this study
half of respondents were aged 50 to 64, and only approximately 5%
were aged 85 and over, with 60% being female. Approximately half were
highly educated with some college or more years of schooling. More than
one-third had annual incomes higher than $40,000. Approximately

two-thirds were living with others, including a spouse or partner, child,
parent, another relative, or some else. Approximately four-fifths lived in
their own places, with 16% requiring significant repairs to their homes.
Approximately 39% rated their community as an excellent place to live.
As for health status, one-fifth reported excellent health status and approx-
imately 7% reported poor health. Approximately 91% of respondents had
not used any of three long-term care services before.
As indicated from bivariate analyses, those with aging-in-place antici-
pation were likely to be young-old (50­64 years), male, higher-educated,
with more income, and in very good or excellent health status. Proportion-
ally, those who lived with others, those who resided in their own places,
and those whose current residence needed significant repairs were more
likely to anticipate aging in place than were their counterparts.
Table 3 shows the characteristics of those with relocation anticipation.
These characteristics included young-old, male, higher-educated, more
income, living with others, in excellent and very good health conditions.
Also those who had used long-term care services before were likely to
anticipate relocation.
Table 4 contains results from the logistic regressions indicating that
perceived awareness of the availability of all types of community-based
long-term care and services were significantly related to aging-in-place an-
ticipation. Compared with those without knowledge about these services,
those who were aware of the availability of the services were more likely
to anticipate aging in place. In addition, perceived awareness of a lack of
eight types of services (all except senior lunch programs, nursing home,
assisted living, and hospice care) in the community was also related to the
likelihood of aging-in-place anticipation. For example, those reporting an
unavailability of housekeeping were 66% more likely, in terms of odds, to
expect a need for regular help for remaining at home than those without
knowledge about the service. Similarly, perceived awareness of the avail-
ability of 11 types of services (all except hospice) was associated with the
likelihood of the expectation for moving out of the current residence. Also,
perceived awareness of the unavailability of 7 types of services (all except
helpline, visiting nurses, personal assistance, nursing home, and hospice
care) was related to an expectation for relocation.
Table 5 contains parameter estimates and standard errors for the models
explaining the relationship of perceived awareness of services and the an-
ticipated age range for aging in place and relocation. Perceived awareness
of the unavailability of visiting nurses, personal assistance, and transporta-
tion was respectively associated with the younger age at which respondents

anticipated to need help. If people thought there were no such services avail-
able in their community, they were likely to anticipate a need for help to
remain living on their own at a younger age than those who were unaware
of the services. Awareness of the availability of adult day care was related
to having an older age for anticipating the need for help to age in place.
Perceived awareness of the unavailability of visiting nurses, personal
assistance, and transportation was also related to the younger age at which
respondents anticipated to move out. In addition, perceived awareness of
the availability of helpline was associated with relocation anticipation at
an older age.
DISCUSSION
This study assessed the perceived awareness of community-based long-
term care and services among older adults living independently in commu-
nities and its associations with aging-in-place and relocation anticipation.
Findings demonstrated that, by a substantial margin, older adults were
not aware of long-term care and services that were available in the com-
munity. In addition, a smaller portion of respondents reported that some
services were not available, though these programs were well-established
and usually visible in the community (Black & Brown, 2004). Aware-
ness of community services alone did not predict service use (Gallagher
& Truglio-Londrigan, 2004), but a lack of awareness was considered a
major barrier to access services, even more than other barriers including
unavailability of services and financial restraints (Li, 2006). Consequently,
this lack of awareness of services prevents future use of and reliance on
community services to remain living at home or in the community. In con-
trast, lack of knowledge or misreport of an unavailability of services would
impose more concerns about relocation.
We found that older adults with certain characteristics were likely to ex-
pect to age in place with regular help and move out because of health prob-
lems. These characteristics were: young old, male, high socioeconomic
status (SES), good health, and living with others. Ironically, the reversed
characteristics were just the demographic profiles of nursing home resi-
dents: oldest old, women, low SES living alone, and in greater need of
care (Eaton, 2005). Probably because of cumulative disadvantages in their
life course, these groups of people may have little knowledge about home-
and community-based care and services in terms of access, eligibility, and
insurance coverage. Thus they may not consider using services available
418 JOURNAL OF HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY
in the community and are more likely to enter a nursing home than those
users of community-based services. A lack of awareness of or information
about community services may hamper people from receiving in-home and
community-based services that could meet their changing care needs and
significantly improve their quality of life. Lack of anticipation for reloca-
tion may be related to an unwillingness to relocate even in face of health
deterioration or lack of information about long-term care availability in
the community. Some people might have the information, or were even
referred to service programs, but withdrew or refused due to financial con-
straints or institutional barriers during the complicated application process
(Long, Liu, Black, O'Keeffe, & Molony, 2005). Such experiences, either
personally or by others, may discourage people from reliance on commu-
nity services. To address issues of accessibility, availability, affordability,
and quality of community-based long-term care and services, the Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation has initiated the program Community Partner-
ships for Older Adults with the focus on improving local service-delivery
infrastructure. One of the strategies of local community partnerships is
to increase awareness about long-term care and services within the com-
munity, specifically awareness of resources, access points, eligibility, and
insurance coverage (Bolda et al., 2006).
This study also indicated that perceived awareness of availability of
various community services was associated with the likelihood of aging-
in-place and relocation anticipations. Faced with possible deterioration in
physical and mental health, older adults need a continuum of services and
care options, from personal care (e.g., homemaker and chore assistance)
to long-term care to meet their desires for aging in place. For example,
as assisted living has become an increasingly important component in the
long-term care system, less restrictive admission and retention policies
with adequate staffing and funding could increase opportunities for aging
in place in assisted living (Chapin & Dobbs-Kepper, 2001). Although a
nursing home is the last place to choose, knowledge about its availability
in the community may help older adults remain in a familiar setting and
close to families, and a temporary admission to a skilled nursing facility
can address their needs as well. Given the importance of housing and
high home-ownership rates in the older population, it is not surprising that
perceived awareness of home repair services was related to both aging-in-
place and relocation anticipation, even though it received the lowest score
for level of awareness in this study.
Perceived unavailability of most services was related to anticipations. It
is, of course, the sudden decline or change in health that usually precipitates
Tang & Pickard 419
the decision to move into a long-term care facility. However, older adults
would be worried if there were no housekeeping or personal assistance
services to aid with activities and functioning in daily life or if there
were no visiting nurses to care for their increasing medical needs. Also, a
lack of transportation would increase limitations in mobility and activity.
The unavailability of senior centers and adult day programs would relate
to decreased social engagement and unmet medical needs, thus posing
burdens on family caregivers. With the worries about a lack of availability
of such essential services in the community, older adults were likely to
anticipate regular help and relocation. Perceived unavailability of services
such as visiting nurses, personal assistance, and transportation was related
to an earlier age at which older adults anticipated to need help or move out.
Older adults may rely on these services to keep living in their current home,
and when these services are supposedly unavailable, elders may think about
needing help or relocating at an earlier age than would otherwise be.
This study showed that adults who were aware of (un)availability of
community-based long-term care and services were likely to think about
reliance on regular help to remain at home and about moving out of the
current home due to health problems. Those who reported an unavailability
of some services tended to anticipate aging in place under regular help or
relocation atan earlierage.Findings pointed to the importance ofincreasing
awareness of long-term care and services in the community to facilitate
older adults' anticipation for aging in place or relocation. In turn, the
anticipation will lead to further appropriate access to and use of these
services with the long-term goal of keeping people in their own homes for
as long as possible.
Strategies have been proposed to address the substantial knowledge
gaps among community-dwelling older adults, including developing and
promoting the use of a telephone helpline in disseminating information
about long-term care, conducting a media campaign or door-to-door out-
reach campaign, and improving communication and collaboration among
long-term care service providers and senior service organizations (Black &
Brown, 2004). As indicated by this study, the targeted populations in these
campaigns include the older old, women, those of lower socioeconomic
status, those living alone, and those who are vulnerable and in greater need
of long-term care and services because of functional dependence, finan-
cial restraints, and lack of informal support. In light of the demographic
changes the United States is facing, the young-old and aging baby boomers
need to be informed about services and resources on which they are able
to draw to meet the increasing desire for aging in place.
420 JOURNAL OF HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY
In addition, federal and state policy efforts are needed to expand the
availability of home and community-based services through raising the
income or asset eligibility criteria for Medicaid waiver programs and au-
thorizing state general revenues for home and community-based services
for people who are ineligible for Medicaid (Burr et al., 2005; Long et al.,
2005). This is particularly important when older adults are in need of, but
currently ineligible for, community services. When older adults know that
they are not financially eligible for a service (e.g., home repair) or cannot
afford a service (e.g., assisted living), they may report an unavailability
of the service. Improved awareness of community services refers to the
knowledge not only about availability of services, but also about access
points, eligibility for service, and affordability of quality care for older
adults.
Limitations
Several caveats must be made to this study. Although the results raised
the possibility that perceived awareness of community-based long-term
care and services could assist in older adults' future planning for regular
help or relocation, the analysis did not allow us to attribute the anticipation
to the information regarding services. As indicated from existing litera-
ture, many factors are important in decision making for aging in place
or relocation, including physical health, social networks, and financial
status, as well as institutional barriers to access services. However, this
study demonstrates the needs for and potential importance of promoting
awareness of community services among community-dwelling residents.
Further, knowledge about services also includes how to access to and get
enrolled in programs, issues of eligibility and insurance coverage, and
the potential benefits and risks of participation. This study does not assess
knowledge about these dimensions. Future research is needed to clarify the
effects of knowledge in these dimensions and beyond on future planning.
In addition, the respondents of the CPFOA Survey were selected from
13 communities that were awarded development grants by the initiative
program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The CPFOA sites varied
in the size and diversity of their older adult populations, ranging from rural
communities with fewer than 20,000 older adults to major metropolitan
areas with more than 350,000 elders (Bolda et al., 2005). Even so, the
selected sites are limited in number, which may not well represent elders
from communities that were not selected. Thus, generalizability is limited.
Tang & Pickard 421
Finally, the concept or model of aging in place also includes another
key component--housing and supportive services, the full range of which
is not covered in this study. Housing options, including naturally occurring
retirement communities, congregate housing, continuing care retirement
communities, and co-housing (Wilson, 2006), provide not only locations
where concentrated numbers of older adults live, but also supportive ser-
vices of various degrees. Knowledge about these options and services and
their affects on aging-in-place planning are not yet known.
CONCLUSION
With the aging of the baby boom generation, the rapid growth of the
oldest-old population, and their great potential of aging into disability,
there will be a dramatic increase in the demand for community-based,
long-term care and supportive services in the coming years. The commu-
nities in which older adults live should be livable with "appropriate and
affordable housing, adequate options for mobility, and the community fea-
tures and services that can facilitate personal independence and continued
engaging in civic and social life" (AARP, 2005, p. 1). Aging in place is
an appealing goal that is desired by a majority of aged and aging adults.
Individuals, aging agencies, communities, and public policies have their
parts in improving the community's livability and achieving aging in place.
A greater number of older adults will be able to realize the goal of aging in
place through improved public awareness of the availability of long-term
care and supportive services for older adults and an increase in the actual
availability of in-home services.
