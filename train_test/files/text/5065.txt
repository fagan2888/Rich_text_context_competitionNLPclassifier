Introduction
It is well established that the renin­angiotensin­aldos-
terone system (RAAS) plays a central role in the devel-
opment of arterial hypertension. Angiotensin II (AngII)
plasma levels are clearly involved in vascular endothe-
lium alterations and atherogenesis, and contribute to the
progression of target organ damage.1­8 Drugs inhibit-
ing the RAAS, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors (ACE-is) and angiotensin receptor blockers
(ARBs), have been shown to be effective in reducing
blood pressure (BP) and hypertension-associated tar-
get organ damage,9 particularly heart failure (HF),10­12
coronary artery disease (CAD),13,14 left ventricular
hypertrophy (LVH)15,16 and chronic kidney disease

Abstract
Hypothesis/Introduction: The aim of this study was to assess the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of aliskiren
versus ramipril or losartan in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, microalbuminuria and uncontrolled
hypertension, despite the use of optimal conventional antihypertensive therapy.
Materials and methods: In this open-label active comparator study, 126 patients were randomly assigned to receive
24 weeks of additional therapy with aliskiren (Group A) or either losartan or ramipril (Group B), according to whether
a patient was already treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker,
respectively.
Results: After 24 weeks, both treatment groups experienced a significant reduction of systolic blood pressure
(­11.37% and ­8.47%, respectively; both p <0.001 vs. baseline) and diastolic blood pressure levels (­10.67% and ­9.28%,
respectively; both p <0.001 vs. baseline), with a greater reduction of mean systolic values in Group A compared with
Group B (p <0.001). Furthermore, after six months microalbuminuria was significantly decreased in both treatment
groups (­67.62% and ­49.1%, respectively; both p <0.001), with a reduction rate in Group A significantly higher than in
Group B (p<0.001).
Conclusions: The addition of aliskiren to optimal conventional therapy provided a higher reduction of blood pressure
and urinary albumin excretion when compared with the addition of losartan or ramipril.

(CKD).17 A treatment that includes an ACE-i or an ARB
can contribute to cardiorenal protection effects; how-
ever, these drugs act by blocking the RAAS at different
levels. In addition, they are not able to completely block
RAAS activity because of the reactive rise in renin
release induced by the withdrawal of the feedback inhi-
bition exerted by AngII (the so-called short feedback
loop), as evidenced by a reactive increase in plasma
renin activity (PRA), a well-established cardiovascular
risk marker,18 providing an incomplete cardiorenal
protection.19
The central role of the RAAS in the pathogenesis of
diabetic nephropathy is accepted because several studies
have shown that ACE-is and ARBs can significantly
reduce diabetic nephropathy.20­25 Blockade of the RAAS
with ACE-is or ARBs may be delayed; however, this delay
does not avoid the progression of diabetic nephropathy
towards end-stage renal disease (ESRD).24,26,27 Dual block-
ade with ACE-is and ARBs offers no additional benefit in
patients with hypertension as well as normal renal and left
ventricular function; indeed, PRA increases consistently
with the dual blockade.19 The ONTARGET study showed
that the combination of telmisartan and ramipril, despite
reducing BP by a few millimetres of mercury more than
therapy with either ramipril or telmisartan, was associated
with more adverse events.28,29 More recently, a new anti-
hypertensive class, the direct renin inhibitors (DRIs), was
introduced;30 In fact, renin is the first and primary enzyme
involved in the RAAS cascade. Since the early 1980s, sev-
eral compounds have been synthesized to test the effects of
a blockade of renin enzyme activity (e.g. enalkiren,
ramikiren and zankiren). However, none of these reached
the clinical arena, because of their low inhibiting activity,
lack of oral bioavailability and short half-life. Aliskiren
(Novartis) is the first DRI suitable for oral administration,
and it has been available since 2008.18 Aliskiren is a pow-
erful renin inhibitor which is highly specific for human
renin. It inhibits the enzyme activity of renin at the onset of
the conversion cascade of the RAAS, thus avoiding the
activation of angiotensinogen into angiotensin I and con-
sequently into AngII.31
By blocking the first and rate-limiting step in the
RAAS, aliskiren reduces PRA by at least 70% and buffers
the compensatory increase in PRA observed with ACE-is
and ARBs.19 The combination of a DRI and an ARB or an
ACE-i is an effective approach for lowering BP and avail-
able data indicate that such combinations favourably affect
proteinuria, left ventricular mass index and brain natriu-
retic peptide levels in patients with albuminuria, LVH and
HF.15,19,24,32
Four different trials evaluated the potential cardiorenal
effects of aliskiren on morbidity and mortality.33 One of
these, the ALTITUDE, was halted by the recommendation
of its Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) because of a
higher event rate.34 The recently published ASTRONAUT
trial reported post-discharge mortality and HF
readmissions among patients with acute HF and reduced
left ventricular ejection fraction treated with aliskiren or
placebo in addition to standard therapy.35
The ATMOSPHERE trial is currently evaluating the
effects of an additional treatment with aliskiren in patients
with chronic HF.36 The APOLLO trial (to date at phase 3)
will provide new information regarding the role of
aliskiren administered with or without additional therapy
with a diuretic or a calcium channel blocker (CCB) in
elderly subjects (65 years) with systolic BP (SBP) from
130 to 159 mmHg. The trial is designed to assess the abil-
ity of DRI to prevent major cardiovascular (CV) events,
as well as its impact on global measures of physical, exec-
utive and cognitive function (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:
NCT01259297). Ongoing outcome studies will clarify
which subclass of patient will derive benefit from the com-
bination therapy of aliskiren with an ACE-i or an ARB.
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact
on BP and on urinary albumin excretion of a dual RAAS
blockade strategy in hypertensive patients with type 2 dia-
betes mellitus (T2DM), impaired renal function (IRF),
microalbuminuria (MA) and uncontrolled hypertension,
despite the administration of an optimal antihypertensive
therapy, already including an ACE-i or an ARB; the study
design included the addition of aliskiren to a conventional
therapy with an ACE-I or an ARB, compared with the addi-
tion of ramipril or losartan to a therapy already including an
ARB or anACE-I, respectively. Furthermore, the short-term
safety of these dual blockade strategies was also evaluated.
We want to underline that our study was completed
before Novartis announced the termination of the
ALTITUDE study due to the unexpected increased inci-
dence of renal impairment, non-fatal stroke, hyperkalae-
mia and hypotension. Moreover, the patients enrolled in
the ALTITUDE study presented with adequate BP levels.
Materials and methods
Study population
From June 2009 to June 2010, 1107 outpatients presented
at the Hypertension Care Centre of the University of
Messina, Italy. Each patient underwent a complete history
and physical examination, blood sampling for routine
blood chemistry, 24 h urine collection (to measure creati-
nine clearance and albumin excretion), electrocardiogra-
phy and echocardiography. Patients with secondary
hypertension, acute cardiovascular (myocardial infarction
(AMI) or unstable angina) or cerebrovascular (transient
ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke) disease, which occurred
within the previous 12 months, were excluded from the
study. We also excluded patients with left ventricular dys-
function (ejection fraction 40%), creatinine clearance
(CrCl) 40 ml/min, urinary albumin excretion 30 mg/24
h or 300 mg/24 h, or with serum potassium levels 5.5
mEq/l. Glycosylated haemoglobin was also assessed.
958 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)
We included 126 hypertensive patients (65 males and
61 females, mean age 66.8 ± 8.9 years), with T2DM, IRF
and MA, defined as urinary albumin excretion 30 mg/24h
but 300 mg/24 h, and BP values higher than recom-
mended by ESC-ESH guidelines (>130/80 mmHg).37
All patients included in the study were receiving the
maximum tolerated dosage of any ACE-i or any ARB for
at least six months before inclusion. During the study
period, the subjects were allowed to continue their previ-
ous pharmacological treatment with their antihypertensive
drugs, eventually including diuretics, -blockers, CCBs, or
any other antihypertensive drug, without dose adjustment.
Biometric parameters, including weight and height, were
measured in the morning under fasting conditions; accord-
ingly, the body mass index (BMI) was estimated. All
patients provided written informed consent, and the study
protocol was approved by local ethical review boards. The
study was conducted in accordance with good clinical
practice and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki
(2002) of the World Medical Association.
Study design
The aim of the study was to assess and compare the effi-
cacy and safety of add-on therapy with aliskiren versus
losartan (ARB) or ramipril (ACE-i) in hypertensive
patients with a very high cardiovascular risk profile, due to
concomitant presence of T2DM, IRF and uncontrolled
hypertension, despite the current administration of optimal
antihypertensive therapy, which includedACE-is orARBs.
See Figure 1. Patients were randomly assigned to receive
24 weeks of treatment with aliskiren (Group A; 63
patients), or losartan or ramipril (Group B; 63 patients),
according to whether a patient was already receiving treat-
ment with an ACE-i or an ARB, respectively. In Group A,
we added aliskiren 150 mg to the previous therapy (T0),
while in Group B we added ramipril 5 mg or losartan 50
mg. Drug up-titration was mandatory for SBP or diastolic
BP (DBP) values 130 or 80 mmHg. Aliskiren was
increased from 150 to 300 mg, ramipril from 5 to 10 mg
and losartan from 50 to 100 mg; no further dose adjust-
ments were allowed until the end of the observation period.
If the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated by CrCl
decreased by more than 30% from baseline within four
weeks after initiation of aliskiren, we would have decreased
or discontinued ACE-i or an ARB.38 The dosage of oral
antidiabetic drugs or insulin was adjusted as needed. BP
values, MA, CrCl and clinical chemistry were evaluated at
baseline and after four (T1), 12 (T2) and 24 (T3) weeks.
Blood pressure measurement
Clinical BP measurement was performed at our hospital in
the morning between 8:00 and 10:00; it was taken in the
supine position after at least 10 min of rest. Three measure-
ments were performed with a mercury sphygmomanometer
and averaged, according to current recommendations.38
Evaluation of CrCl and albuminuria
Each enrolled patient underwent a 24 h urine collection to
evaluate CrCl and MA. CrCl was calculated according to
the standard formula: (urinary creatinine × 24h urinary
volume)/(serum creatinine × 1440); MA was evaluated by
standard immunoturbidimetric assay.
Statistical analysis
The Kolmogorov Smirnov test verified that several varia-
bles had a non-normal distribution; consequently, given
also the relatively small size of our sample, we chose a
permutation test-based analysis. This subset of non-
parametric statistics, widely used in biomedical research,
is considered preferable to the classic non-parametric
approach39 since it is based on more realistic foundations;
furthermore, it is intrinsically robust and the resulting
inferences are credible because they estimate the entire
data distribution and exploit all information contained in
the sample.40 Accordingly, data were expressed as mean ±
standard deviation (SD). Comparisons were conducted
Figure 1. Study design.
Imbalzano et al. 959
with the Nonparametric Combination test (NPC-test),
which is based on a simulation or resampling procedure
that is conditionally dependent on the data; thus, it pro-
vides a simulated estimate of the permutation distribution
of any statistic.41
Moreover, in order to verify the results obtained with
this approach, we integrated the statistical analysis with a
traditional non-parametric approach (median and IQR);
consequently, the comparisons between the variables were
conducted with the Mann­Whitney U test. Comparisons
between different observation times were carried out with
the Wilcoxon test. The correlations among the variables
were assessed with Spearman's test. To perform the statis-
tical analyses, we used the SPSS statistical package (SPSS
V. 17.0, Chicago, IL), and the NPC test 2.0 (Statistical
software for multivariate permutation tests; Methodologica
srl, Treviso).
Results
Patient characteristics
Table 1 presents the characteristics of the study population
at baseline. Besides age, gender and biometric parameters,
in the table are reported adjunctive CV risk factors
(CVRFs), such as smoking habit and low high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) plasma levels, and
comorbidities/complications such as history of CAD, pre-
vious AMI, TIA, stroke, history of coronary revasculariza-
tion procedures, and the prevalence of LVH and of IRF. No
significant differences could be found in regard to the age,
gender, heart rate and CVRF prevalence. Group A had a
higher BMI compared with Group B (28.6 ± 4.8 vs. 26.8 ±
3.6; p < 0.05). At baseline, patients were receiving an aver-
age of 2.4 antihypertensive drugs.
Four patients dropped out the study before its conclu-
sion because of adverse events: one in Group A (diarrhoea)
and three in Group B (two for cough, and one for angina
pectoris). The direct causal relationship of adverse events
with drugs in use and/or with pre-existing conditions was
not further evaluated.
Changes in BP, MA, CrCl and serum potassium
Tables 2 and 3 present the mean changes in BP, MA, CrCl
and serum potassium levels. At T1 (four weeks) in both
groups there was a significant reduction of SBP (­9.08
mmHg and ­5.33 mmHg, respectively; both p < 0.001)

and DBP (­4.36 mmHg, p < 0.001; and ­2.55 mmHg, p <
0.003, respectively).
At T1, 35 patients from GroupA(~55%) and 41 patients
from Group B (~65%) still exhibited inadequate control of
BP; therefore, and according to the study design, drug up-
titration was prescribed. In detail, from the fifth week of
treatment until the end of the observation, 35 of 63 patients
in group A took aliskiren 300 mg daily, whereas 27 contin-
ued with 150 mg daily; in Group B, 22 out of 30 patients
who were taking ramipril 5 mg switched to 10 mg per day,
and 19 out of 33 patients who were taking losartan 50 mg
switched to 100 mg per day.
Figure 2 presents SBP, DBP, MA, CrCl and serum
potassium level variation during the observation period.
At the conclusion of the study (T3) both treatments pro-
vided a significant reduction of SBP (­11.4 mmHg and ­8.5
mmHg, respectively; both p < 0.001) and DBP levels (­10.7
mmHg and -9.3 mmHg, respectively; both p < 0.001) ver-
sus baseline. The reduction rate of SBP in Group A was sig-
nificantly higher than in Group B ( = ­2.9%; p < 0.01);
furthermore, the DBP reduction rate reached statistical sig-
nificance ( = ­1.4%; p = 0.05) (Figure 2(a) and (b)).
At T3 both treatments provided a significant increase of
CrCl (+13.1 ml/min and +19.4 ml/min, respectively; both
p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between
the groups (p: NS) (Figure 2(c))
MA levels remained substantially unchanged after the
first four weeks in both groups; a significant urinary albu-
min excretion reduction was observed after 12 weeks of
treatment (T2) in both the treatment groups, and it
decreased further after 24 weeks (T3) (p < 0.001 for both
groups compared with baseline). The MA reduction rate
was significantly higher in Group A compared with Group
B ( = ­18.5%; p < 0.001) (Figure 2(d)).
During follow-up, we observed a slight, progressive
increase of serum potassium levels when compared with
baseline (+ 0.78 mEq/l and + 0.68 mEq/l, respectively;
both p < 0.001) (Figure 2(e)) without a significant differ-
ence between the groups ( = + 0.1 mEq/l; 2.5%; p = 0.51,
NS). Five patients experienced a mild increase of serum
potassium levels (K+ > 5.5 but < 6.0 mEq/l) and they were
managed with dietary potassium restriction. None of these
patients were discontinued from the trial because of
increase of serum potassium levels, or increase in baseline
plasma creatinine > 30%.
Discussion
Patients enrolled in our study are those that are termed
`complicated'. We usually define `complicated' patients as
hypertensive subjects with diabetes, MA and previous CV
events. In fact, these conditions increase the risk of new
CV events and accelerate the progression of target organ
damage, such as end-stage renal disease; moreover, low
numbers of patients at very high CV risk achieve the BP
target levels.37
At the conclusion of the study, we observed a reduction
of BP and MA in all patients. This result is likely due to the
addition of a RAAS antagonist to the previous standard

treatment. Notably, in this study, both treatments showed
an adequate safety and tolerability profile. In fact, we actu-
ally had a low dropout incidence due to an increase of
serum potassium levels: we had five cases of mild hyper-
kalaemia, which were managed with dietary potassium
restriction. None of these patients were discontinued from
the trial because of hyperkalaemia, or an increase in base-
line plasma creatinine > 30%. Furthermore, our study
showed that the addition of aliskiren to a previous conven-
tional antihypertensive treatment that included a RAAS
antagonist, either an ACE-i or an ARB, had a greater effect
in reducing SBP than the addition of either ACE-i or ARB;
further reduction of SBP by approximately 4 mmHg was
found with the former regimen.
No difference was observed in DBP reduction between
the two groups.

However, our results are in agreement with the findings
of other clinical trials.42­44 An eight-week, double-blind,
multicentre trial45 assessed whether the combination of
aliskiren and ramipril in patients with diabetes and hyper-
tension was safe and effective in lowering BP when com-
pared with the respective monotherapies. In this study
aliskiren showed higher SBP reduction with ramipril.
Moreover, when used in combination with ramipril,
aliskiren provided a significant additional reduction in both
SBP and DBP. Another eight-week, randomized, controlled
trial42 compared valsartan, aliskiren and their combination
at the maximum dose (320/300 mg) in patients with mild to
moderate hypertension. This study showed that the combi-
nation of aliskiren and valsartan at maximum recommended
dosages provides greater reduction in BP values compared
with monotherapy with valsartan or aliskiren alone.
We must stress that these results were obtained in a
clinical setting of mild to moderate residual hypertension
in T2DM patients, where a significant degree of pressure
reduction is hard to achieve, especially in a limited time-
frame. A recent 24-week, open-label, single-arm study
showed that the combination therapy of aliskiren and a
RAAS blocker in CKD patients who were already being
treated with ACE-is or ARBs for more than six months had
a favorable effect on reducing residual proteinuria and BP
reduction.44 Another recent study43 confirmed the efficacy
and safety of aliskiren in a real-life setting. Aliskiren is
approved for treatment of hypertension, but has also shown
renoprotective potential in normotensive patients with
T2DM and albuminuria.24,25,46 All patients included in the
study were receiving the maximum dosage of an ACE-i or
ARB for at least six months before inclusion. To date, this
is the optimal treatment to reduce albuminuria and delay
the progression of CKD.38 After 24 weeks we observed a
significant reduction of urinary albumin levels in both
groups. In GroupA, we observed a higher reduction of MA
compared with group B (­67.6% vs. -49.1%, respectively;
versus basal, additional reduction ­18.5%; p< 0.001); fur-
thermore, in both study groups we observed, after an initial
decrease at four weeks, a significant improvement of GFR
estimated with CrCl at 24 weeks with respect to baseline
(+13.1 ml/min and +19.4 ml/min, respectively; both p <
0.001); however, no difference was detected in CrCl vari-
ation between the two groups. Adjunctive therapy with
aliskiren appeared to provide a more beneficial improve-
ment of diabetic nephropathy in hypertensive patients, as
marked by urinary albumin excretion, compared with
other treatment protocols that are considered to be the gold
standard.38 The renal protective effects of aliskiren could
be related to its organ-specific mechanism of action.18 A
direct renin inhibition with aliskiren provides a greater
intrarenal protective effect than other RAAS antagonists.47
The results of our study show that the multi-level blockade
of the RAAS represents a good therapeutic strategy, and
confirms the efficacy and safety of aliskiren. These results
are consistent with those of other and larger randomized
clinical trials. The AVOID study recruited 599 patients
with hypertension, T2DM and proteinuria who were
already receiving the maximum recommended renoprotec-
tive treatment with losartan (100 mg daily) and exhibited
an optimal management of hypertension; enrolled patients
were randomized to receive adjunctive treatment with
aliskiren (300 mg daily) or placebo. In the group treated
with aliskiren, a significant reduction of albuminuria,
compared with placebo, was observed. This benefit
appeared to be independent of systemic BP reduction.24
Adjunctive therapy with aliskiren appears to be a unique
opportunity for patients at high cardiovascular risk. These
patients usually show a poor response to conventional anti-
hypertensive treatment. It is likely that the double block-
ade of RAAS with DRI and an ACE-i or an ARB can help
us to better understand the pathogenesis of hypertension. If
so, it would provide a more effective therapeutic strategy
in preventing hypertension-related diseases; consequently,
it would delay the progression towards the end-organ dam-
age. More long-term data are needed to confirm the effi-
cacy and safety of this regimen in these patient populations.
The ASPIRE HIGHER programme was undertaken to
evaluate potential cardiorenal effects of aliskiren over a
spectrum of conditions in 14 different studies involving
more than 35,000 patients.33 Three of these studies
(AVOID, ALLAY and ALOFT) evaluated surrogate end-
points and confirmed the favourable effects of adding
aliskiren to standard treatment. The ASPIRE HIGHER
programme also included four morbidity and mortality tri-
als.33 One of these, the ALTITUDE, was halted by a rec-
ommendation from its DMC.34 The basis of the DMC
recommendation was futility (i.e. no prospect of demon-
strating the treatment benefit anticipated in the protocol),
as well as safety concerns. These concerns included renal
dysfunction and hyperkalaemia. Doubling of serum creati-
nine occurred in 4.8% of the aliskiren group vs. 5% of the
placebo group (p= NS). ESRD or renal death occurred in
2.8% of the aliskiren group vs. 2.5% of the placebo group
(p= NS). Hyperkalaemia occurred in 39% of the aliskiren
group vs. 29% of the placebo group, and severe hyper-
kalaemia was observed in 21% vs. 16%. It was assessed
that there were no cases where the increase in potassium
needed dialysis, but there was one case where raised potas-
sium levels were specified as the cause of death. Other
main concerns were hypotension and an excess of non-
fatal strokes. In response to these findings, it has been rec-
ommended that dual aliskiren and ACE-i/ARB therapy not
be used in patients with both hypertension (the current
indication for aliskiren) and diabetes or moderate to severe
renal dysfunction. The recently-published ASTRONAUT
trial35 reported that the addition of aliskiren to standard
therapy in patients with acute HF and reduced left ven-
tricular ejection fraction (LVEF) appeared to improve
post-discharge outcomes and biomarker profiles; it was
Imbalzano et al. 963
generally well-tolerated in non-diabetic patients. In con-
trast, diabetic patients receiving aliskiren appeared to have
poorer post-discharge outcomes.
The ATMOSPHERE trial is currently being conducted
on patients with chronic HF.36,48 We want to stress that, in
the population enrolled in ALTITUDE, BP was well-
controlled at baseline, and patients were randomized to
receive aliskiren 150 mg or placebo in addition to their
conventional treatment (including a maximum dose of
ACE-i orARB).After four weeks of treatment, the patients
were force-titrated to receive aliskiren 300 mg. In contrast,
all of the patients enrolled in our study had poor BP control
at baseline, and aliskiren was up-titrated to 300 mg only if
the BP target was not achieved at the fourth week. This
study design allowed a low dropout rate and a lower inci-
dence of side effects compared with other studies.
Further larger clinical studies are ongoing, and they
may add further insight regarding aliskiren safety and effi-
cacy; furthermore, they may increase understanding
regarding the mechanisms underlying its cardiorenal pro-
tective potential. The APOLLO Trial should provide new
information regarding the role of aliskiren (with or without
additional therapy with a diuretic or a CCB) in elderly sub-
jects ( 65 years; with SBP 130 to 159 mmHg) in prevent-
ing major CV events and on global measures of physical,
executive and cognitive function (ClinicalTrials.gov iden-
tifier: NCT01259297). Moreover, we hope that a sub-
analysis of ALTITUDE, and the outcomes of the other
long-term studies (ATMOSPHERE, ASTRONAUT and
APOLLO) will help us to identify the subgroup of patients
that could obtain an advantage from dual RAAS blockade
with DRI and ACE-I or ARB.
Study limitations
The major limitation of our study is the small sample size
that limits our ability to determine statistical significance.
Conclusions
The addition of aliskiren to the standard therapy provides
greater reduction of BP and urinary albumin excretion than
adding an ACE-i (ramipril) to an ARB and vice versa
(losartan to ACE-i). The dual blockade of RAAS can be
associated with an increased risk of hyperkalaemia com-
pared with monotherapy; therefore, we recommend that
this therapeutic strategy requires closer monitoring of
renal function and serum potassium levels.
