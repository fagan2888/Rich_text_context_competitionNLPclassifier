Introduction
The current "crisis in healthcare" has produced an increased
focus on identifying variables which are related to health
behavior, health status, and healthcare utilization which
may be amenable to intervention. For example, the new
variable, "patient activation," and the somewhat older vari-
able of "self-efficacy" have both been explored recently in
relation to hospital and emergency department (ED) utiliza-
tion patterns (Begum et al., 2011; Greene and Hibbard,
2011). Health locus of control (LOC), defined as an indi-
vidual's belief system about control over health outcomes
(Wallston et al., 1976), is one variable which has been
examined in this context (Bazargan et al., 1998; Chambers
et al., 2013). While the evidence for a relationship between
health LOC and health outcomes or utilization is mixed,
there have been many studies examining the construct of
health LOC in general and the Multidimensional Health
Locus of Control (MHLC) scale (Wallston, 2005) in par-
ticular. Health LOC has been measured using the MHLC
scale for the past 40
years (Wallston et al., 1976, 1978).
Despite this long history of use, some questions regarding
the underlying structure of the MHLC tool remain, and
there is a need for testing structure across racial, ethnic,
and/or cultural groups. Since application of a valid meas-
urement device is imperative for studies identifying predic-
tor variables in relation to health, further investigation of
the proper application and interpretation of the MHLC is
needed.
In this article, we review the published literature on
exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor

Abstract
The factor structure of the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control scale remains in question. Additionally, research
on health belief differences between Black and White respondents suggests that the Multidimensional Health Locus
of Control scale may not be invariant. We reviewed the literature regarding the latent variable structure of the
Multidimensional Health Locus of Control scale, used confirmatory factor analysis to confirm the three-factor structure
of the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control, and analyzed between-group differences in the Multidimensional
Health Locus of Control structure and means across Black and White respondents. Our results indicate differences in
means and structure, indicating more research is needed to inform decisions regarding whether and how to deploy the
Multidimensional Health Locus of Control appropriately.

analysis (CFA) of the MHLC scale and then present a CFA
of the scale performed on data collected in a large urban
sample. We also provide evidence bearing on the factor
structure and mean differences between Black and White
respondents in our sample.
The MHLC scale focuses on the individual difference
variable LOC specifically as it pertains to health conditions
and/or health-related behaviors (Wallston et al., 1976). It
comprises three subscales: the Internal subscale represents
the degree to which a person believes he or she is in control
of his or her own health. The Powerful Others subscale
(External) indicates the extent to which a person perceives
that others (e.g. doctors and important others) control his or
her health, while the Chance subscale represents the degree
to which one views fate and luck as controlling one's health
outcomes. While not without debate, the construct validity
of the MHLC appears to hold for some health behaviors,
under certain conditions. For example, those who have a
high Chance health LOC orientation are likely to be less
engaged in positive health behaviors, whereas those high
on the Internal dimension are more likely to have a health-
oriented approach (Ludenia and Donham, 1983; Norman
and Bennett, 1996). Researchers have demonstrated a rela-
tionship between health LOC and patients' healthcare utili-
zation in specific contexts (Bazargan et al., 1998; Chambers
et al., 2013; Goldsteen et al., 1994). Patients who scored
higher on the Powerful Others and/or Chance dimensions
were likely to have higher utilization rates, while those who
scored higher on the Internal construct were likely to have
fewer visits to the ED, fewer hospital admissions, and
fewer ambulatory physician visits (Bazargan et al., 1998;
Chambers et al., 2013). Similarly, Goldsteen et al. (1994)
also reported that patients with more of a Powerful Others
locus of control (PLOC) and/or Chance locus of control
(CLOC) were likely to have a higher incidence of hospitali-
zations and physician visits. Additionally, patients' PLOC
has been shown to positively correlate with trust in physi-
cians (Brincks et al., 2010).
The MHLC scale
We conducted a thorough review of the literature, including
unpublished studies, of EFA and CFA of the MHLC scale;
however, this should not be construed as a systematic
review.
The MHLC scale has two equivalent versions--Form A
has typically been used with samples of generally healthy
individuals, while Form B has historically been used with
participants faced with chronic illness(es) (Chaplin et al.,
2001). Wallston (2005) claimed that Forms A and B are
nearly equivalent based on strong correlations between the
subscales across forms (Wallston et al., 1978) and across
studies; thus, the research reviewed below concerning the
factor structure of the scale will be limited to only those
studies in which Form A and/or Form B was administered.
We omit discussion here of the more recent Form C,
designed to be used with patients who have an existing
medical condition and assesses health LOC specific to
one's illness or disease (Wallston et al., 1994). We also omit
discussion here of the final member of the family of MHLC
instruments, the God Locus of Health Control (Wallston
et al., 1999).
Factor structure
The current three-subscale structure implies that there are
three underlying dimensions being measured with the 18
items, and many studies have supported this structure.
However, there is also support for a two-factor structure,
which generally suggests that items comprising the
Powerful Others external and Chance external LOC sub-
scales arise from the same underlying latent variable. Our
literature review did not unequivocally support either a
two- or a three-factor model structure. We found 15 EFA
studies, 8 CFA studies, and 2 studies that presented both
EFA and CFA of the scale. These studies are reviewed
below and summarized in Table 1. Of note in this review is
that of the eight CFA studies we found, six used sample
sizes of less than 250.
Two-factor model structure: EFA
Cooper and Fraboni (1990) collected data from 82 staff
members at a psychiatric hospital and reported high item-
factor loadings for the Internal subscale (for both Forms A
and B), but a less clear distinction between the item-factor
loadings for the Chance and Powerful Others latent varia-
bles. Coelho (1985) and Umlauf and Frank (1986) also
investigated the factor structure of the MHLC (Form A
only), among 146 chronic cigarette smokers (53 men) and
107 inpatients staying at a rehabilitation unit. Based on
their results, Coelho concluded that there was a lack of sup-
port for the MHLC as a three-dimensional construct; rather,
a two-dimensional construct consisted of an Internal factor
and a Powerful Others factor provided a better fit. Umlauf
and Frank conducted a principal axis factor analysis with
orthogonal rotation, which also supported a two-factor
model with Internal and Powerful Others/Chance factors.
O'Looney and Barrett (1983) investigated the factor
structure of Forms A and B using principal component fac-
tor analysis with British college students. Importantly, the
investigators conducted separate analyses for each gender.
They found that while the EFA in the female sample pro-
duced three factors, the EFA in the male sample resulted in
only two factors. The factors for the males included a com-
bined Internal/Chance factor, with a separate Powerful
Others factor. The factor structure in the female participants
produced all three factors.

6 Health Psychology Open 
originally extracted three factors with eigenvalues above 1,
although the third factor explained only 6.9
percent of the
variance; in addition, the Powerful Others and Chance sub-
scales were highly correlated, and the factor structure sug-
gested a great deal of overlap between these dimensions.
Thus, the authors forced a two-factor solution that explained
41percent of the total variance: Powerful Others and Chance
loaded on Factor 1 and Internal loaded on Factor 2. They
concluded support for a two-factor model where Powerful
Others and Chance represented an external health LOC.
An EFA performed on data collected from 152 first-year
medical and dental students who had completed Form A
also produced a two-factor structure with evidence for an
Internal factor and a Powerful Others factor; a Chance fac-
tor was less evident (Winefield, 1982). As a second study,
Winefield (1982) compared the responses on Form A of the
MHLC from 53 patients who had recently suffered myocar-
dial infarction (MI) to 52 participants serving as controls.
Although a factor model was not analyzed, Winefield's
findings were still informative as he found that MI patients,
who were both older and of lower average social status,
scored higher on the Powerful Others domain, but not the
Internal or Chance domains, compared to the control par-
ticipants. Furthermore, when Winefield followed up with
28 of the MI patients 7
months after their discharge from
the hospital, test­retest scores indicated that the Internal
and Powerful Others dimensions remained stable over
time, whereas the Chance dimension did not.
Finally, in a longitudinal study (Stanton et al., 1995)
conducted with adolescents from New Zealand, a principal
component factor analysis provided support for a two-fac-
tor model solution when participants were both aged 13 and
15years. However, the composition of the two-factor model
solutions at the two different time points varied. At age 13,
the majority of Internal and Powerful Others items loaded
on Factor 1, and Chance items along with two Powerful
Others items loaded on Factor 2. At the age of 15
years,
Internal and Chance items loaded on Factor 1, and Powerful
Others items loaded on Factor 2. Based on their results, the
authors contended that there was some support for a three-
factor solution with a model structure similar to the MHLC
scale (Wallston et al., 1978). We did not find any CFAs that
supported a two-factor model structure. Therefore, despite
the findings of the studies reviewed above, a clear rationale
for either rejecting or confirming a two-factor model struc-
ture was not demonstrated.
Three-factor model structure: EFA
Other researchers have continued to find support for the
more generally accepted three-factor model solution. An
EFA principal component analysis conducted (with Form
A) using 496 Iranian college students (Moshki et al., 2007)
found three factors which corresponded to the three-factor
structure proposed by Wallston et al. (1978). Similarly,
Marshall et al. (1990) examined the factor structure of
Form A of the MHLC using 181 Veterans Administration
medical outpatients. Results from the principal component
analysis with orthogonal rotation largely supported a three-
factor structure. Five factors with eigenvalues greater than
1.0 were identified, although a scree plot indicated that
three factors should be extracted, consistent with Wallston
et al.'s (1978) proposed structure. In another study,
Buckelew et al. (1990) found support for a three-factor
model structure of the MHLC using EFA with oblique rota-
tion performed on data from 160 participants referred to a
pain management center.
An EFA was also performed by Casey et al. (1993) using
principal component analysis with varimax rotation on 678
participants who completed Form A. Three factors were
extracted which provided support for Wallston et al.'s
(1978) proposed three-factor model. Similarly, Hartke and
Kunce (1982) studied 86 medical patients and found sup-
port for a three-factor structure using a principal axis factor
analysis with oblimin rotation. Gala et al.(1995) reported
support for the three-factor model structure with a non-clin-
ical sample of 524 participants who completed both Forms
A and B, approximately 4­6
days apart. Their EFA with
varimax rotation was able to account for 42percent of the
total variance. Paine et al. (1994) also conducted a principal
axis factor analysis with oblimin rotation which produced
a three-factor structure similar to the one proposed by
Wallston et al. (1978). These results were produced in a
sample of 280 middle-class Brazilians who completed an
adapted version of Forms A and B combined. Russell and
Ludenia (1983) reported similar results with 100 inpatients.
They administered both Forms A and B and then combined
the scales for a total of 36 items in order to have higher reli-
abilities for each subscale. Using the principal axis method,
three factors were extracted that corresponded with Internal,
Powerful Others, and Chance.
Three-factor model structure: CFA
Hewson and Charlton (2005) conducted a CFA for both an
Internet administration (N
=
167) and a paper administra-
tion (N
=
200) separately. Given previous findings that a
two-factor structure may be a better fit for the MHLC
(Chaplin et al., 2001), both a two-factor and a three-factor
CFAs were specified for the Internet sample and paper sam-
ple separately. Results illustrated that the three-factor struc-
ture model provided the best fit for both the Internet and
paper data, although neither CFA produced good model fit,
and both analyses had a significant chi-square, despite the
relatively small sample sizes.
Robinson-Whelen and Storandt (1992) performed a
CFA using 197 non-diabetic and 171 diabetic adults who
had completed Form B. The CFA on the non-diabetic sam-
ple provided adequate support for a three-factor model,
although they suggested that four items be eliminated to
provide a better fit. Items 1, 7, 14, and 15 were removed
from analyses, and the models were refit to the remaining
LaNoue et al. 7
14 of the original 18 items from the MHLC; a fairly good
fit to the three-factor model was found for both the diabetic
and the non-diabetic samples. Similar to Robinson-Whelen
and Storandt, Kelly et al. (2006) reported reasonable sup-
port for the three-factor model structure among individuals
with osteoarthritis, after Items 7 and 8 were removed from
the analyses. Moreover, they detected no differences in
model structure between men and women. Also, Fasol et al.
(1998) reported more support for Wallston et al.'s (1978)
three-factor model once Items 7 and 15 were omitted from
the model structure. Gehlert and Chang (1998) conducted a
CFA with 143 epileptic patients who completed Form A
and found an acceptable fit for the model in which all items
on the scale loaded onto their a priori subscale.
More recently, Hubley and Wagner (2004) conducted a
CFA with 245 non-clinical participants using both Forms A
and B. The CFA using a three-factor model for Form A pro-
duced a marginal fit; however, the CFA for Form B did not
show adequate fit.
None of the reviewed CFAstudies support an unambigu-
ous model structure for the MHLC. Additionally, no sub-
stantive studies of measurement invariance with the MHLC
have been published, with the exception of the study
described below, and the study conducted by Malcarne
et al. (2005), described in the next section. Neither of these
definitively supports a three-factor model.
Talbot et al. (1996) conducted two CFAs in order to
compare the three-factor structure to a two-factor structure
which has been supported by research (Coelho, 1985;
Cooper and Fraboni, 1990; O'Looney and Barrett, 1983;
Winefield, 1982). These investigators used a non-clinical
group of college students (N
=
224) as well as a clinical
group of diabetics (N=132), and all participants completed
Form A. Results from the CFAs demonstrated that neither
the two-factor model nor the three-factor model provided a
good fit to the data, although the fit of the three-factor
model was better. Moreover, with invariance testing, Talbot
et al. concluded that there were differences in the structure
of the MHLC between the two samples.
Three-factor model structure: multiple analyses
Wall et al. (1989) performed both an EFA and a CFA on
Forms A and B averaged together using 60 psychiatric
patients. The EFA component of the analysis suggested three
factors--Internal, Chance, and Powerful Others, with all
items loaded on their a priori subscales. The CFA found "rea-
sonable support" for a three-factor structure of the MHLC.
Malcarne et al. (2005) also conducted a CFA and an
EFA. Importantly, despite the growing size of the non-
White population in the United States, Malcarne et al. were
the first--and we believe to date the only--investigators to
conduct a CFA separately for individuals (college students)
from different racial and ethnic groups (1122 Caucasian
Americans, 281 Filipino Americans, and 462 Latino
Americans) who completed Form A of the MHLC. In this
study, fit indicators did not demonstrate a good fit to the
three-factor model in any of the three ethnic groups. Next,
Malcarne et al. conducted EFAs using varimax rotation and
found evidence for the three dimensions of the MHLC
scale across all three ethnic groups. However, each dimen-
sion was represented with only three items, rather than the
most commonly used six-item format.
Purpose of this research
As reviewed above, CFA studies of the MHLC have not been
consistent in their support of a specific factor structure. Also,
with the exception of Malcarne et al. (2005) and the Kelly
et al. (2006), sample sizes for the CFA studies have tended to
be small and within specialized samples (e.g. college students
only or inpatients). Importantly, we note a dearth of studies
investigating factorial invariance of the MHLC across ethnic/
racial groups, with the exceptions noted above, despite a
recent call for more cultural sensitivity in the MHLC scale
(Luszczynska and Schwarzer, 2005) and despite the existence
of an extensive and growing body of literature documenting
racial and ethnic differences in health beliefs (Ayalon and
Young, 2005; Barroso et al., 2000; Bourjolly et al., 1999;
Copeland, 2005; Lewis and Green, 2000; Spalding, 1995;
Sproles, 1977; Wallston and Wallston, 1981; Weitzel et al.,
1994). One exception to this is the O'Hea et al. (2009) study
which, although it is a CFA, we excluded from our review as
it was based on the MHLC Form C.
The literature further demonstrates that differences in
health beliefs are associated with differences in health
behaviors. For example, racial differences in cancer screen-
ing behavior relative to mammography have been docu-
mented (Harmon et al., 2014), as have differences in colon
cancer and prostate screening (Harmon et al., 2014), mental
health screening and treatment preferences (Jimenez et al.,
2013), and diabetes self-care (Johnson et al., 2014) between
Blacks and Whites, differences which have implicated
health beliefs explicitly.
Given the lack of definitive findings in the literature, we
sought to confirm a three-item latent variable structure for
the MHLC in a large sample. Our analysis sought to investi-
gate between-group differences in the MHLC scale struc-
ture within a larger and more general population of Black
and White participants--adult visitors to two urban EDs. As
part of examining differences in the scale across Black and
White respondents, we tested for differences in the means
between groups, as well. This research is the first of its kind
to explore variations in the MHLC factor structure and
scores specifically as a function of Black and White race.
Method
Participants
We collected data from 863 adults in two urban EDs over a
period of 5months. "All-comers" who presented in the ED
8 Health Psychology Open 
were approached during their visit and asked to take part in
a short paper-and-pencil survey. The refusal rate was
40.6
percent. Participants were predominantly White
(45.5%) and Black (42.6%). A total of 10percent reported
"other ethnicity." Additionally, 8.2
percent self-identified
as Hispanic (not mutually exclusive with race). A total of
55percent of respondents were females. They ranged from
19 to 94
years, with a mean age of 48.8
years (standard
deviation (SD)=17.2years). For the purposes of this study,
we removed cases where respondents identified a race or
ethnicity other than "White" or "Black" (n=99). The sur-
vey was conducted anonymously, and therefore compari-
sons could not be made between demographics of those
who elected to participate and those who refused.
Patients were approached in ED examination rooms by
research assistants trained to collect data for ED studies.
Written consent was obtained, and no compensation was
offered. Inclusion criteria were adult (aged >17years) and
English speaking. We excluded patients with high acuity as
determined by the Emergency Severity Index. This study
received approval from the Thomas Jefferson University
Institutional Review Board.
Measures
Age and race were collected from all participants in the
study. The MHLC scale­Form B was administered. In this
sample, the scale showed moderate internal consistency:
Cronbach's alpha for the total scale was .70; Cronbach's
alpha for the individual subscales was .64 (Internal), .57
(Chance), and .67 (Powerful Others).
Design and analysis
Descriptive analyses and data cleaning were performed in
IBM SPSS, version 22. We compared our samples' sub-
scale means to published normative MHLC data and com-
pared the Black and White samples to each other, using
independent-samples t-tests. CFA and invariance testing
were performed in the IBM SPSS AMOS software, version
22 (IBM Corp. Released, 2013).
Data screening
A total of 23 cases were removed for missing data. We
examined the distributions of each item individually
through visual inspection of box-and-whisker plots for out-
liers, and through calculation of each item's skew/standard
error and kurtosis/standard error ratios; 28 cases with ratios
>2 were removed this way. We also examined the subscale
distributions for normality for the evaluation of the assump-
tions of the t-test; all subscales met this assumption.
Items within each subscale of the three-factor model
were examined for multicollinearity through a series of
regressions, using a single item as the criterion variable,
and all the other items from that subscale as predictors. The
R2 for these models was used for evidence of multicolline-
arity, with a cut-off value of >.80. No models exceeded this
threshold (no model had an R2 value >.30). We also calcu-
lated Mardia's coefficient for multivariate normality and
used a rule of thumb of -3 to +3 for skew and -7 to +7 for
kurtosis. We removed an additional 52 cases to correct for
significant skew or kurtosis. The final analyzed N was 691.
CFA
We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to perform
the CFA of the MHLC, beginning by specifying an a priori
model. We specified the three-factor model of the instru-
ment corresponding to the latent variables Internal locus
of control (ILOC), PLOC, and CLOC, with the six model-
based items (specified in each subscale) forced to load on
each of these latent variables. We allowed all item vari-
ances, and latent variable covariances, to be freely esti-
mated from the data. Although the original conception of
the MHLC was that the Internal and Powerful Others sub-
scales were orthogonal (Wallston et al., 1976), we made
the decision to allow the latent variables to be correlated
based on the reviewed literature (Paine et al., 1994;
Russell and Ludenia, 1983) and the theoretical rationale
that these three types of loci of control are unlikely to
demonstrate complete orthogonality (Luszczynska and
Schwarzer, 2005).
This produced the a priori model shown in Figure 1 and
presented as Model 1 in Table 2. The fit of this model was
evaluated (as described below), and it was also compared to
an "independence model," which specifies all item indica-
tors to load on one latent variable (Model 0 in Table 2).
Because any a priori model must fit better than a single-
factor model, the independence model was compared to the
a priori structural model as a first test in order to provide a
basis for testing more complex models.
Model fit for the CFA
We used several commonly accepted measures to evaluate
model fit. First, the 2 test for the model was reviewed,
where desired values are non-significant. However, since 2
is sensitive to large sample size, it is possible to obtain a
large and significant value even when the fit of the model to
the data is acceptable. To address this, a widely used "rule
of thumb" was also evaluated, the ratio of the 2 to its
degrees of freedom, which is suggested to reflect "good fit"
at values <4.0 (Joreskog, 1993) and "excellent fit" at values
<2.0 (Hair et al., 2009).
We also evaluated the adjusted "goodness of fit" index
(AGFI), which provides a fit index by comparing the pro-
portion of the observed covariance matrix that is explained
by the model-implied covariance matrix (Kline, 2011). The
Tucker­Lewis index (TLI), which penalizes complexity,
LaNoue et al. 9
was also used. Hu and Bentler (1999) recommend values
>.95. The root mean square error of approximation
(RMSEA) for each model was also evaluated. Hu and
Bentler (1999) showed that a cut-off of .06 for RMSEA
indicates good model fit.
Logic of invariance testing
In this research, our goal for invariance testing was to
examine potential structural and measurement differences
in the MHLC scale across two groups of participants--
Black and White respondents. In order to accomplish this,
we used a multigroup CFA (MGCFA) approach and fol-
lowed guidance from Vandenburg and Lance (2000) and
Kline (2011). We took a "model trimming" approach to
invariance testing, where the baseline model for invariance
testing was specified as a fully unconstrained model (Model
2 in Table 2), with all parameters allowed to vary freely
within the two groups separately, thereby estimating two
complete sets of parameter estimates from two sets of

sample moments. This model reflects the extent to which
the a priori model structure fits the data when the groups
are allowed to have their own parameter estimates. This
model provides a test of configural invariance because
when there are differences between groups in any parame-
ter estimates, this model should fit significantly better than
a model where all parameters are forced to equality in the
combined groups.
Adequate fit was found for Model 2, indicating that the
form of the structural model (item to latent variable rela-
tionships) was invariant between Blacks and Whites.
Therefore, increasingly restrictive nested models were fit-
ted to the data in steps, and change in fit was evaluated.
This nested model approach compares competing models
against each other, where the nested model is obtained by
fixing (to a specific value) or eliminating parameters from
the original model, thereby resulting in a simpler model
with more degrees of freedom (Joreskog, 1993). The spe-
cific hierarchical nested model comparisons we evaluated
are shown in Table 2.
We examined sets of parameter estimates separately to
investigate which parameter estimates, if any, differed
between the groups. We began by constraining all of the
regression path coefficients from each item to its latent
variable to be equal across the groups, but freely estimating
the other parameters (the "Measurement Weights" model--
Model 3 in Table 2). A finding that this model does not
change the fit compared to the first model, or improves it,
suggests that the regression path coefficient estimates are
the same between the groups.
Next, we constrained the latent variable covariances to
be equal between the groups but allowed for beta coeffi-
cients and item variances to be freely estimated within the
groups. If this model (Model 4 in Table 2) is a worse fit to
the data, the inference would be made that the groups likely
differ in these coefficients.
At each step, a null hypothesis is tested that the more
constrained model (a "smaller" model with fewer estimated
parameters) is a better fit to the data (Bollen, 1989). The
chi-square difference test,

Comparisons to normative data
Our combined sample had mean loci of control as follows:
MInternal
=26.06 (SD=5.38), MPoloc
=23.62 (SD=6.03), and
MChance
=18.39 (SD
=
6.67). We compared these mean val-
ues to published normative data, specifically to Wallston
and Wallston's (1981) original validation results and also to
the combined sample of 1206 osteoarthritis patients in the
Kelly et al. (2006) study, which we feel most closely resem-
bles our sample. The results of the six independent groups'
t-tests we performed are presented in Table 3 and indicated
that our sample scored significantly higher on both the
Chance and Powerful Others subscales than both compari-
son samples (p<.001). Additionally, within our own sam-
ple, Black respondents scored significantly higher than
White respondents on the CLOC subscale.
CFA
In this sample, the CFA failed to confirm a three-factor
structure. Model fit was poor to marginal, with
RMSEA=.071, AGFI=.877, and TLI=.730 (Model 1, the

"Constrained Model," Table 2). In addition to the fit, of
note in this model is the finding that the squared multiple
correlation coefficients (R2s) describing the variance
explained in each item indicator by the presumed latent
variable to which it is specified to load ranged from a low
of .08 (Item I1) to a high of .45 (Item C4), indicating that
the underlying latent variables are generally inadequate at
capturing item variance (Figure 1). All unstandardized path
coefficients were significant and in the predicted direc-
tions, and the model converged using full maximum likeli-
hood estimation.
Invariance testing
Because the CFA of Model 1 suggested marginal fit, we
used this information as a starting point in invariance test-
ing. One-way poor fit may result in misspecification of the
structural model as identical in the two groups, so we next
estimated a model which allowed for all parameter esti-
mates to be estimated freely within the groups separately in
a MGCFA (Model 2). The fit of this model was evaluated
and found to be reasonable, RMSEA=.051, TLI=.729, and
AGFI=.896. Finding that this model is adequate fit to the
data suggests configural invariance, that is, the patterns of
latent variables, covariances, and item loadings are the
same across groups. Additionally, finding that this model is
a better fit than one which constrains all model coefficients
to be equal across groups suggests that some estimates are
likely not the same between the groups and provides the
rationale for further invariance testing.
Next, we investigated a model in which all unstandard-
ized regression weights (indicator to latent paths) were con-
strained to be equal between the groups, while the other
model parameters were estimated individually, commonly
called a "measurement weights" model (Model 3) and com-
pared it to Model 2 as a test of metric invariance. This com-
parison was not significant, 2(15)=23.6, p=.07, supporting
equality of regression coefficients between the groups.
Next, we evaluated a model that constrained the latent
variable covariances to be equal but allowed the other
parameter estimates to differ between the groups. Model 4
was compared to Model 2, and that comparison was sig-
nificant, 2(3)=17.57, p
<
.001, indicating that the latent
variable covariances differ between the groups. In these
data, all the covariances were significantly different
across the groups; for relationships between the CLOC
and PLOC latent variables, Z=3.92, p<.01; between the
CLOC and ILOC latent variables, Z=3.48, p<.01; and
between the ILOC and PLOC, Z=2.09, p<.05. Among
Black respondents, the correlations between the latent
variables were CLOC­ILOC=-.20, CLOC­PLOC=.31,
and ILOC­PLOC=.27. In White participants, the correla-
tions were CLOC­ILOC=.10, CLOC­PLOC=.53, and
ILOC­PLOC
=
.52. See Figure 2 for all coefficients in
both groups separately.
Because of the evidence for invariance in latent variable
covariances, we did not proceed to a test of variance/covar-
iance invariance because it is a more restrictive model.
Discussion
In this study, we (1) reviewed the published literature on
the factor structure of the MHLC scale, (2) analyzed MHLC
data collected from "all comers" in two urban EDs to com-
pare means across studies and between Black and White
respondents in our sample, (3) conducted a CFA for a three-
factor model structure, and (4) performed invariance test-
ing of the instrument across Black and White respondents.
Our analyses found significant mean differences
between Black and White respondents in the CLOC sub-
scale, consistent with other published research. It is a rela-
tively common finding in the literature that Black
respondents hold higher "chance" control beliefs about
their health. For example, racial differences in cancer
screening behavior relative to mammography are well doc-
umented (Harmon et al., 2014), which are associated with
African-American women's higher CLOC about breast
cancer (Barroso et al., 2000). A large study focused on
health beliefs among African-American participants spe-
cifically showed that 30
percent of respondents indicated
that their health was primarily based on fate or destiny
(Lewis and Green, 2000). There are also documented dif-
ferences in colon cancer and prostate screening (Harmon
et al., 2014), mental health screening and treatment prefer-
ences (Jimenez et al., 2013), and diabetes self-care (Johnson
et al., 2014) between African-Americans and Caucasians,
differences which have implicated health beliefs particu-
larly. Also of note in the comparison of our sample to two
normative samples are the significantly higher Chance
externality and Powerful Others externality loci of control
in our sample. We reason that this reflects the fact that our
data were collected in ED settings, which may bias the
sample toward those individuals with a greater likelihood
of holding these control beliefs.
On the basis of the literature review and our analyses,
we conclude that the latent variable structure of the MHLC
scale remains in question. One possibility for this may be
small sample sizes in many of both the EFA and the CFA
studies (see Table 1). A low item-to-person ratio is undesir-
able in factor analysis and can produce sample specific and
ungeneralizable results. Another potential reason for differ-
ing findings across the studies with respect to model fit for
latent variable structure may be differences in latent varia-
ble structure or item functioning across groups, a possibil-
ity which can be addressed with invariance testing. We
confirmed in our data that models which permitted differ-
ences in factor loadings based on respondent race (Models
2­4 in Table 2) were a better fit than a more constrained
model (Model 1 in Table 2), indicating differences in model
coefficients between groups.
LaNoue et al. 13
Our CFA results failed to confirm a three-factor model.
The three-factor model yielded only marginal-to-poor fit of
the data to the model. Because we were moving forward
with invariance testing, we did not attempt to re-specify
this model to improve fit, although examination of the
modification indices suggested that the residual terms for
the items are highly correlated with each other, and with the
latent variables, consistent with our finding that the total
proportions of variance accounted for in the items by their
latent variables is low overall.
The results of invariance testing demonstrated that
allowing parameter estimates to vary between Black and
White participants produces a better fitting model than
constraining them to be equal across the groups, providing
evidence for differences in model coefficients between
groups. To follow up, we first established that a model con-
straining the regression coefficients to be equal between
groups does not worsen model fit relative to the model
where all parameters are freely estimated, although this dif-
ference in model fit was marginally significant (p=.072).
We interpreted this as evidence of metric invariance despite
the marginally significant 2 difference test for two reasons:
first, the individual pairwise comparisons of beta coeffi-
cient parameter estimates were themselves all non-signifi-
cant, and the 2 difference test between Models 2 and 3 was
non-significant. This result allows for the inference that the

coefficients were estimated within the sample of Black respondents.

items are interpreted the same between the racial groups
investigated in our study.
Next, we constrained the latent variable covariances to
be equal across groups but allowed all other parameters to
be freely estimated. This model was a significantly worse
fit to the data than the model allowing all parameters to be
freely estimated. Pairwise comparisons of estimates
revealed that all the covariances were significantly differ-
ent between groups, and in fact, for the CLOC­ILOC latent
variable relationship, these coefficients were in the oppo-
site directions. Indeed, our data indicate that for White
respondents, these constructs are significantly inversely
related, while for Black respondents, they are positively
related. This is a striking finding, indicating that the rela-
tionships among these constructs should be investigated
further and in particular investigated with potential
between-group differences made explicit. This finding par-
tially explains the apparent orthogonality of the latent vari-
ables when race is not accounted for, as in Figure 1 which
shows a near zero correlation and which is a common
assumption in the literature. Furthermore, this finding is
consistent with some of the published literature which finds
a chance external orientation associated with an internal
orientation, such as O'Looney and Barrett (1983) which
found a Chance­Internal factor in males only. Also, O'Hea
et al. (2009) reported that a Powerful Others­doctors factor
and an internal factor are not only positively related in their
all low-socioeconomic status (SES) African-American
patients but in fact form the same factor (with the caveat
that their factor solution included the "god" LOC subscale
and so was different from the typical three-factor solution).
They interpret this to mean that in their sample, internal
control beliefs are confounded with control beliefs about
the healthcare system, an interesting suggestion worthy of
future research.
Differences in item functioning (i.e. metric invariance)
are potentially difficult to address when using the scale in
practice, as they imply different meanings of the underlying
dimensions between groups--a threat to construct validity.
In our study, this hypothesis could not be ruled out defini-
tively and so we recommend that Black/White comparisons
of mean scores on the MHLC be interpreted with caution
and when possible be accompanied with item mean com-
parisons as well. Studies using MHLC mean scores should
also consider race as an analytic covariate and should con-
sider adding interaction terms into statistical models. Of
note, although we do not present the data here, these data
were derived from a larger study of the associations between
MHLC subscales and ED visits and hospital admissions
(Mautner et al., 2015). In that study, we did use race as a
covariate for analyses because of the finding that the race
was significantly associated with both ILOC and CLOC and
with both outcome variables. Finding that the subscales are
differentially related to outcomes between groups provides
additional evidence of potential problems with construct
validity with the MHLC. Further invariance testing should
include a test of the hypothesis of strong scalar invariance
which we did not test here. This test would speak more
directly to analyses which attempt to directly compare
Black/White mean scores on MHLC subscales.
The issue of the non-equivalency of latent variable
covariances is less of a problem for the use of the scale in
practice, but does imply that more work is needed on the
theory of health LOC and health LOC differences between
Black and White populations, empirical work which appears
to be underway, as we review above. Factor analytic studies
should begin with a non-orthogonal rotation of the factors.
Additionally, the God LOC subscale could be considered in
studies with Black participants to potentially attribute cor-
rectly the overlap between the Chance/Powerful Others ori-
entation and the Internal orientation. Finally, although we
only undertook confirmatory analyses here, EFA studies
should be undertaken to confirm the dimensional invariance
of the MHLC between Black and White respondents.
The results of this study are limited in generalizability to
urban settings. Furthermore, there is a suggestion in these
data that our sample overrepresented those with a high
CLOC and high PLOC, not surprising given that these data
was collected in an ED. Therefore, caution should be used
interpreting these results beyond this setting.
