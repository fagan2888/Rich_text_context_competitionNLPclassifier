Introduction
With advances in the treatment and care of HIV/AIDS,
health care professionals (HCP) face growing challenges in
caring for a patient population with complex health care
needs (Gallant et al., 2011). Continuing professional educa-
tion (CPE) and other developmental opportunities are com-
monly used to address these challenges and have been linked
to improvements in HCP performance and patient health
(Forsetlund et al., 2009). Research shows, however, that
CPE activities differ in their ability to increase HCP's com-
petence and performance, and have inconsistent effects on
patient health outcomes (Marinopoulos et al., 2007).
A variety of factors affect whether a CPE trainee is able to
apply new knowledge and skills acquired during training to
their clinical practice, a concept commonly referred to as
knowledge translation (KT; Davis et al., 2003; Graham et al.,
2006; Jacobson, Butterill, & Goering, 2003; McKibbon et al.,
2010; Thomas et al., 2006). The World Health Organization
defines KT (also called knowledge transfer, training transfer,
and implementation) as "the synthesis, exchange, and applica-
tion of knowledge by relevant stakeholders to accelerate the
benefits of global and local innovation in strengthening health
systems and improving people's health" (Landry, Amara,
Pablos-Mendes, Shademani, & Gold, 2006, p.597). Although
difficult to measure, KT is often the sought outcome of CPE
events.
Research points to three main areas that influence whether
translation occurs: (a) trainee characteristics, (b) training char-
acteristics, and (c) organizational characteristics (Aguinis &
Kraiger, 2009; Grossman & Salas, 2011; Lim & Morris, 2006;
Roche, Pidd, & Freeman, 2009). Notably missing in the litera-
ture is the trainer's role in facilitating KT. Although leading
scholars have hypothesized that ineffective trainers can lead to
failed transfer (Salas & Kosarzycki, 2003; Swanson, 2001;
Tannenbaum & Yukl, 1992), few studies have explored the
relationship between trainer attributes and trainee KT.
Considering most trainers acquire their training-related skills
on the job (Bunch, 2007) and there are few formal programs to
become a CPE trainer, we argue that to improve the efficacy of
training programs, it is essential to understand trainer attri-
butes and actions that lead to or hinder KT.

Abstract
Continuing education and training provides a means to improve performance among health care professionals (HCP).
Research shows, however, that continuing professional education activities have inconsistent effects on HCP competence,
performance, and patient health outcomes. Furthermore, the trainer's role as a facilitator of knowledge translation (KT)
has been understudied. To understand how clinical trainers support their trainees in translating what they learned into
practice, we conducted 16 in-depth interviews with expert trainers. These interviews yielded a variety of KT-enhancing
strategies, including tailoring training activities to their trainees' needs. In addition, participants recommended trainers
familiarize themselves with their trainees' work environments,be able to identify their knowledge deficits,and devote time to
provide trainees with post-training support. Creating an effective training, one that leads to transfer, requires active planning,
communication, and command of the training topic by skilled trainers.

Setting and Objectives of the Study
The federally funded AIDS Education and Training Centers
(AETCs) provide training and capacity-building assistance
to HCPs on the delivery of quality care to people living with
HIV/AIDS. This is accomplished through a nationwide
network of 11 regional centers, 5 national centers, and over
130 local performance sites. TheAETCs have trained more than
1 million HCPs over the last two decades (Health Resources
and Services Administration, 2010). Between July 2008 and
June 2009, the AETCs delivered 19,300 training events to
more than 148,000 trainees. The majority of trainees were
nurses (33%) and physicians (17%) working primarily in
hospital/hospital-based clinics (20%), community health
centers (12%), and community-based organizations (8%).
Given the volume of trainings the AETCs provide and
their potential impact on health care outcomes, evaluation of
KT in relation to these programs is important. In comparison
to the estimate that not more than 15% of what trainees learn
is transferred to the job (Cromwell & Kolb, 2004), 54% of
AETC trainees report changes in practice behavior following
training (Bashook et al., 2010). This finding suggests that
AETCs may be especially successful in assisting their train-
ees implement new knowledge and skills. The current study
was designed to understand how AETC clinical trainers sup-
port trainees during the translation process. The main objec-
tive of this study was to identify strategies trainers use to
increase the likelihood of KT.
Methods
We conducted in-depth interviews with AETC clinical
trainers to explore strategies employed to assist trainees in
the translation process. To obtain our sample, we contacted
regional AETC program directors to describe the study and
request they nominate four of their regional clinical train-
ers. The recruitment criteria required that participants be
(a) a physician, an advanced practice nurse, a registered
nurse, a physician's assistant, a dentist, or a pharmacist; (b)
a core AETC trainer with more than 3 years of training
delivery experience; and (c) experienced in developing
training curriculum. Two of the nominated clinical trainers
from each region were selected at random to receive an
email describing the project and asking for their participa-
tion. We then followed up with each trainer to schedule an
interview.
All participants were interviewed between December
2008 and May 2009. Interviews were conducted via the tele-
phone by one of the first two authors using a semistructured
interview guide. Participants were asked to explain how they
prepared for training events, to describe aspects of trainings
that worked well for audiences, and to provide examples of
how they assisted trainees with implementation issues.
Interviews lasted approximately 1 hr and were audio recorded
and transcribed. Participation was voluntary; respondents
were asked to provide informed verbal consent using
procedures approved by the University of California San
Francisco Committee for Human Research.
Researchers took extensive notes during interviews and
discussed their initial observations following each interview.
Adjustments to the interview protocol were made during
these conversations to ensure sufficient probing on key
research domains. In addition, emerging themes and direc-
tions were documented to aid in the development of a coding
framework. The first three authors read a cross-section of
interviews to identify an initial set of analytic codes. This
preliminary codebook was applied to a second set of inter-
views; codes were further modified and clarified through
team discussions. After several revisions to the preliminary
codes, the final codebook was applied to the entire data set.
The coded data were entered into Atlas.ti©, a qualitative
research software program used to organize data. The char-
acteristics of the major themes were identified and explored.
Results
Our sample had representation from 10 of the 11 regional
AETCs. Among the nominated clinical trainers, the overall
response rate was 57% (16/28 contacted). Respondents had
extensive experience in both providing direct HIV care to
patients (M = 20 years) and delivering training to clinicians
(M = 19 years). The sample consisted of nine physicians,
three advanced practice nurses, three registered nurses, and
one pharmacist.
Multiple themes emerged on common techniques that
trainers use to assist trainees in the KT process. Based on
the findings presented below, we constructed a framework
(see Figure 1) that represents a continuing sequence of
KT-enhancing strategies for utilization by program planners.
The figure illustrates that in addition to having excellent
communication and facilitation skills, trainers must also con-
duct supplemental activities to enhance KT.
StrategiesThat Enhance Knowledge
Translation
In advance of training, identify needs within the clinical setting
and among trainees. In general, participants stated that the
methods and activities used to assist trainees differ depend-
ing on the topic and intensity of training. Participants empha-
sized the importance of determining the training scope prior
to the event. Respondents recommended that trainings focus
on identified professional practice gaps and involve all
stakeholders during initial planning activities. When describ-
ing how trainings take shape, one participant stated,
For the last couple of years, we haven't held a large
conference here but have actually been going out and
doing site visits and trainings based on what we have
assessed their [trainees] needs to be . . . because they
were all at different levels of capacity in treating HIV.
(Nurse Trainer)
Khamarko et al. 3
Almost all participants felt that familiarizing themselves
with the target audience, trainees' work environments, and
clinic leadership was a vital step. Participants described a
number of methods used to gather this information, ranging
from needs assessments to site visits and discussions with
trainees. This information was a necessary component in the
creation of training events that led to KT, as noted by the
participant below:
Overall, the ones that don't go well are those where I
don't have a good feel for the audience: who they are,
what professions they are, what the barriers are in their
hospital, what kind of people they're seeing--the
thing about not knowing your audience. I think when
I go in and try to talk to people without really knowing
what their practice setting is, I feel like I'm talking to
a blank wall cause I don't know if I'm saying what
they need to hear or addressing their barriers.
(Physician Trainer)
Engage stakeholders in the training process and identify con-
ducive training environments. Most participants thought train-
ees needed support from clinic leadership to implement
training concepts, particularly if these concepts required
policy changes or reallocating resources. Participants
described the process of gaining buy-in from key stakehold-
ers as a best practice for ensuring KT. This process often
entailed direct communication with clinic leadership and
staff on the value of implementing specific clinic policies
and procedures. Participants also recommended that clinic
leaders attend trainings to increase their understanding of
particular issues and to demonstrate their commitment to
improved care.
You need buy-in if you're going to change a system
and that certainly doesn't apply to all trainings. If you
want systems change, then you need the players to be
the ones that can actually effect change. (Physician
Trainer)
Interviewees recommended holding trainings in clinical
environments or settings favorable to training as a factor that
influences the success of training. Nearly all participants told
us that on-site training (i.e., in trainees' workplaces) was the
most effective environment for clinical training. Respondents
noted that on-site training promoted relationship building,
allowed for highly relevant content to be discussed, and
allowed trainers to observe the clinical environment and
address barriers. Although on-site training did not guarantee
that KT would occur, it provided trainers with numerous
opportunities to enhance training plans.
Tailor training design and content to target audience. Respon-
dents recommended tailoring trainings, which required that
trainers take trainees' professional practice gaps, profes-
sional roles, and work environments into account when
developing training curricula. This allowed for the incorpo-
ration of content most applicable to trainees. The incorpora-
tion of case-based discussions was also a common trainer
technique that helped make trainings salient to trainees.
Many participants felt that tailoring improved training out-
comes, including a pharmacist trainer that stated, "I think it
went well because we knew the audience; we knew specifi-
cally what they wanted. They gave us specific questions and
we were able to tailor the presentation to that and conse-
quently the feedback was excellent."
In addition to developing thoughtful curricula, it was
equally important to create "actionable" products for train-
ees. Some respondents created easy to understand tools and
provided reference materials for use during KT. The follow-
ing quote illustrates this strategy:
People had a lot of trouble with anal cytologies until I
started incorporating into my presentation an actual
video of myself doing an anal exam on a patient. I did
it in real life, my clinic, my patient and then had my
patient come with me [to training] and actually say not
only was that me you saw, but I'm here to tell you that
it wasn't painful, it wasn't uncomfortable, I under-
stood why it was being done and it was important.
(Physician Trainer)
Create dynamic training activities. Participants were able to
provide a variety of examples on how to create an effective
training leading to KT. Most of these examples included
activities (role-play, small group exercises, and teach backs)

that made trainees think about both the training content and
its intended implementation. The majority of respondents
considered the incorporation of interactive skills-building
activities to positively influence the training environment. A
physician trainer touched on this when stating, "what made it
[training] go well is that the design of the training included a
wide variety of different kinds of activities and modules so
as to match different learning needs of people."
Another recommendation involved devoting time during
training for participants to do "real work" (e.g., practice
administering and interpreting rapid HIV test results). Many
participants also suggested trainers build informal time into
trainings, for casual discussions, and leave time at end for
trainees to discuss specific cases individually. The following
quote illustrates the value of informal time:
The best part of the training: you give your lecture and
it's all well and then one or two people hang out after-
wards and ask you about a specific patient or say, "I
tried to get our doc to do that but they wouldn't do it."
Sometimes those conversations you have before and
afterwards are much more fruitful in some ways,
because you are hearing their specific issues and
you're able to respond to that instead of just down-
loading information. So that's a good training tip,
always leave yourself time to hang out afterwards and
tell people, "I'm happy to stay and talk to you about
these things or I'd love to tour your clinic and talk to
your staff." (Physician Trainer)
Communicate clearly and be flexible in facilitation. Trainer
characteristics (i.e., approach to training and behavior) influ-
ence all stages of the training process. Participants described
training events that required trainers with strong communi-
cation skills who were also adept, flexible, and approachable
during the trainings. Some participants provided examples of
trainings with audiences that were different from what they
prepared for (e.g., training social workers on drug interac-
tions); in these cases, it was important for trainers to be able
to gauge the audiences' needs and to be flexible in the deliv-
ery of training content. Trainer's willingness to allow for
trainee-directed learning (i.e., trainer allows audience to
steer training based on their needs) was also identified as a
KT-enhancing strategy. This concept is described in the fol-
lowing physician trainer quote, "so it really turned into an
effective training session because people were focusing on
the things they wanted to learn; not so much what we thought
they wanted to learn."
Some participants noted a distinction between the skills
required to facilitate a didactic presentation and those
required to deliver a skills-building workshop. Most partici-
pants stated that skills-building trainings were more effective
than didactic presentations, primarily because they require
more active involvement from trainees. These sessions also
require more effort by skillful trainers, as described by the
following participant:
Its [interactive, skills-building training] definitely
more demanding . . . I could be sick as a dog and still
give a lecture from the power points, but the facilita-
tion piece involves being able to be both thinking
about your content and listening to what they're [train-
ees] saying, analyzing it, reflecting on it and translat-
ing it for the other participants. It's a much more
complicated mental task. (Physician Trainer)
Provide post-training support. Many participants discussed
the importance of the implementation process not ending
after the training event is conducted. "It doesn't just end with
the training," one participant said. Participants developed a
variety of techniques to keep trainees connected to the train-
ing topic. Participants described how they followed up with
trainees and clinic leadership to gauge whether training was
being implemented effectively and how they could further
assist. Some participants maintained relationships with train-
ees or clinics and continued to discuss cases related to the
training topics. Implementing policy changes required the
most post-training support and required time investments by
clinics and trainers. In addition, some participants estab-
lished coaching relationships with trainees and developed
KT action plans. This excerpt illustrates one participant's
thoughts on coaching:
So it's breaking the change down. We help coach
them. It's very much like the gym; it's not that the
trainer teaches you anything new, it's that you have a
commitment to each other and someone's bugging you
about it. Nagging you, creative, gentle, kind nagging
is actually a major part of the coaching phenomenon.
(Physician Trainer)
In addition to follow-up support, participants also talked
about the benefits of building strong working relationships
with trainees. Some participants worked in settings where
everyone knew each other; sometimes this allowed for easier
access into clinics and feeling well connected to potential
trainees. Some trainers used the "adopt-a-clinic" model,
whereas others worked to establish longitudinal programs,
where a continuum of training was provided over time. In the
absence of longitudinal training, participants suggested pro-
viding refreshers/booster sessions to trainees. A physician
trainer illustrates this when stating,
You need to go longitudinal, so you can go back and
say, "Did it work? Didn't it work?" If you just give it
[training] to them and leave, you don't know whether
they were able to transfer it or not.
Discussion
The literature on KT suggests that aspects of the trainee,
training, and organizational setting influence transfer. Key
trainer characteristics are often subsumed under the training
Khamarko et al. 5
category, thus making it difficult to understand the discrete
role trainers play in the KT process. The current study
explored how clinical trainers design trainings that facilitate
KT. The findings from this study highlight the difficulties
involved in achieving KT and emphasize the responsibilities
of trainers in this process. We identified a variety of strate-
gies trainers can employ to increase the likelihood of KT.
These activities should be tailored to the audience and may
differ depending on the topic and intensity of training.
Creating an effective training--one leading to KT--requires
active planning, communication, and command of the train-
ing topic. In addition, trainers must be familiar with the
trainees' work environments, be able to identify their knowl-
edge deficits, and devote time to provide trainees with post-
training support.
Our study identified five strategies, in addition to adept
communication and facilitation skills, which increased the
likelihood of KT among trainees (see Figure 1). The first strat-
egy consists of identifying trainees'professional practice gaps,
a concept consistent with principle guidelines outlined by the
Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (www.
acgme.org). The second strategy involves the process of
engaging stakeholders and obtaining buy-in from clinic lead-
ership on training concepts. This is an important step, as front-
line staff and leadership may have different perceptions of
their clinics' needs, and obtaining supervisory support has
been widely supported in influencing KT (Blume, Ford,
Baldwin, & Huang, 2010; Clarke, 2002; Grossman & Salas,
2011). The above strategies yield information about trainees
and their work environments, which is required to tailor train-
ings to the audiences' needs, our third strategy. In addition to
making the training salient to the audience, our sample recom-
mended the incorporation of interactive activities that both
engaged the audience and kept them focused on the applica-
tion of training concepts. The final recommendation centers
on providing support to trainees after training events, a strat-
egy not yet employed by all trainers in our sample.
Trainers described the aforementioned techniques and
their influence on KT in detail but acknowledged that the
activities require both time and rapport building with train-
ees and their clinics. Overall, our participants noted the
importance of conducting specific activities both before
(e.g., collecting data on trainees and their needs) and after
(e.g., following up with trainees and helping to resolve KT
barriers encountered) the training, but these activities were
not easily implemented. For example, an effective training is
formed with the main objective in mind (e.g., increasing anal
cytology screening), but this means the trainer needs to con-
sider all components that could lead to successful KT, rang-
ing from details on the screening method, to billing, and
patient education. Most trainers were not able to invest this
level of effort for all of their trainings; some trainers focused
only on the training event itself.
Although this study identified valuable teaching and sup-
port strategies, it was not without limitations. A purposeful
sample of experienced trainers was recruited for participa-
tion, which may have led to sampling bias. Purposeful sam-
pling was used as a method to allow for the selection of
information-rich cases from which in-depth knowledge
about the phenomenon being studied could be gained (Patton,
2002). Although AETC directors nominated potential par-
ticipants, individuals on the list were contacted at random
with emphasis on representation from all regional AETCs.
The sample recruited included both seasoned and newer
trainers from diverse professional backgrounds.
Our study shows that some trainers strongly believe in the
value of coaching trainees and providing follow-up support
after training events. However, more research needs to be
done to evaluate the outcomes associated with post-training
activities. Furthermore, we are uncertain of whether follow-
up support is widespread among AETC trainers and whether
the AETC program structure is sufficient to sustain or
encourage this level of effort. The findings from this study
provide insight into important strategies for developing
effective clinical trainers. Program planners, trainers, and
managers can use the lessons from this study to increase the
likelihood that training will result in improvements in care.
