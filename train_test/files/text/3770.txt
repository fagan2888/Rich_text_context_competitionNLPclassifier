Introduction
Self-concept or image consists of the "totality of thoughts
and feelings having reference to him/herself as an object." It
is composed of attitudes one holds toward oneself;
(Mothersbaugh & Hawkins, 2016) and includes four parts:
Who I am now (actual self-concept), who I would like to be
(ideal self-concept), how I would like to be to myself (private
self-concept), and how I would like to be seen by others
(social self-concept). Years of consumer research have con-
firmed an intimate connection between identity and con-
sumption behavior (Weiss & Johar, 2013; White & Argo,
2009). Products help to define and maintain consumers' self-
concept by reinforcing their identities (Berger & Ward, 2010;
Birdwell, 1968; Gao et al., 2008; Ward & Broniarczyk,
2011). Brands are important to consumers for their func-
tional benefits and their symbolic meaning. They help them
in portraying their self-image and how others perceive them
(Elliott, 1997; Levy, 1959; McCracken, 1986). While prod-
uct consumption symbolizes personal attributes, motiva-
tions, and social patterns, symbolic consumption reflects the
personality and lifestyle of consumers, helping in expressing
social distinctions (Sirgy, 1982). Consumers express their
identities by choosing brands whose images are perceived to
be similar to their own self-images (Aaker, 1999; Kassarjian,
1971; Sirgy, 1982). In fact, consuming products inconsistent
with an important identity sometimes causes cognitive dis-
sonance, motivating consumers to sometimes cease consum-
ing the less identity-consistent product (Berger & Heath,
2008), leading them to seek out and consume products that
are more identity consistent (Ward & Broniarczyk, 2011).
Health consciousness assesses the degree to which a per-
son plays an active role in maintaining his or her health. It is
a motivational component encouraging consumers to
enhance or sustain their physical well-being by engaging in
preventive behaviors and health care (Jayanti & Burns, 1998;
Michaelidou & Hassan, 2008). Health conscious consumers
purposively monitor their state of health and perform

Impact of Consumers' Self-Image and
Demographics on Preference for Healthy
Labeled Foods
Savita Hanspal1 and P. Raj Devasagayam2
Abstract
Consumers are becoming more health conscious. Increasingly, products that are labeled "healthy" are being marketed as new
retailers and new brands vie for the consumers' share of wallet. This research identifies the self-image factors that constitute
a health conscious image of the self and examines how self-image impacts consumer buying of foods that are labeled healthy.
It also makes an effort to find out whether specific self-image factors are significantly associated with demographics. This
study employs a scale consisting of 15 statements that included four statements from the Health Consciousness scale
developed by Gould. The psychometric properties of the scale used in the study are reported. The study uses factor analysis
to identify five factors of consumer self-image as they relate to health consciousness. Furthermore, the study explores the
relationship between demographics such as age, gender, education, and relationship status with the self-image factors and
reports results for consumer preferences for choosing healthy foods when hungry. This research has important implications
for marketers in the health food industry and for such other companies that might use consumer health consciousness as a
basis for market segmentation and strategy design.

Michaelidou & Hassan, 2008)
Food is both privately and socially consumed and is an
important part of consumers' buying decisions. In recent
decades, consumption of fast food and food away from home
has increased in the United States (Krieger et al., 2013).
According to Poti and Popkin (2011) and Powell et al.
(2012), in 2007 to 2008, fast-food and full-service restau-
rants accounted for an estimated per day consumption of 275
kilocalories (kcal) among children, 564 kcal among adoles-
cents, and 599 kcal among adults amounting to energy intake
of 14% for children and 24% of total energy for adolescents
and adults. Healthy diet helps to prevent type 2 diabetes,
obesity, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers (Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012). The direct costs
of diet-related diseases account for an enormous proportion
of the total health expenditures in the world--diabetes mel-
litus type 2 alone accounts for 11% of the total costs world-
wide (International Diabetes Federation, 2013). The type of
food consumed is, therefore, likely to influence money spent
on health care.
Eating healthy also gets a lot of publicity as it is seen as a
panacea for curing obesity. Media has played a crucial role in
highlighting obesity and its ill effects on both short-term and
long-term enjoyment of life. Public policy makers have,
therefore, aimed to foster healthy food choices (e.g., fruits,
vegetables) and reduce consumption of unhealthy food. The
social marketing campaigns urge people to consume fruits
and vegetables and avoid fast food and sugary drinks in large
sizes to contain high expenditures on health care. Media has
also highlighted the irresponsible practices of the food busi-
ness that have caused harm to health.
Consuming healthy food is seeing an upsurge not only in
the United States but all around the world. It has, therefore,
become "cool" to be seen as being a health conscious con-
sumer. Since the late 1970s, nutrition-related behaviors have
emerged as consumers'most frequent activity to stay healthy
(Harris & Guten, 1979; Ostberg, 2003). Research has also
recognized "interest in health" as a key motive in the pur-
chase of organic food (Grankvist & Biel, 2001; Lockie et al.,
2004; Michaelidou & Hassan, 2008). Marketers are respond-
ing to these changed preferences by increasingly selling
products labeled "healthy." Food retailers and manufacturers
also eagerly position themselves as health friendly to target
health-conscious consumers (Leeflang & Van Raaij, 1995;
Prasad et al., 2008).
Cornish (2012) classified healthy foods into nutritionally
rich and nutritionally poor functional foods. His study
revealed that although a number of functional foods (e.g.,
probiotic yoghurts, cholesterol-lowering spreads) are proven
to provide genuine health benefits and have become a staple
of the modern diet (Nestle, 2007), some other functional
foods (e.g., low-fat cookies, zinc-fortified breakfast cereals),
although fortified, lack real nutritive value (Pollan, 2009;
Urala & Lähteenmäki, 2003) and provide no real health
benefits (Nestle, 2007). Food choice theories suggest that
consumers are more likely to be swayed by nutritional beliefs
and labels than actual nutritional quality, at times making
wrong choices.
It is, therefore, pertinent to understand whether only the
consumers with a "health conscious" self-image would con-
sume healthy labeled foods. The present study has been con-
ceived to address this question. The following paragraphs
summarize the extant literature in the area.
Literature Review
The survey of literature focused on self-image, self-concept,
health orientation/consciousness, nutrition labeling, and
healthy/organic foods consumption for identifying relevant
studies.
Past research has established that self-concept influences
a variety of consumer behavior decisions including choice of
office decor (Gosling et al., 2002), brand preference (Escalas
& Bettman, 2003), and choice of accessories (Berger &
Ward, 2010). Identity-consistent products are consumed not
only as a signal to others but also as signals to the self
(Gosling et al., 2002; Shrum et al., 2013). Individuals have a
need for coherence, meaning, and control (Heine et al., 2006;
Swann, 1983; Swann & Bosson, 2010), and for this reason,
they seek out products that provide feedback consistent with
their self-concept. A consumer's sense of self influences
preferences for products that help maintain their self-concept
(Ball & Tasaki, 1992; Oyserman, 2009). Consumers also uti-
lize product choice to offset dissonance-arousing self-con-
cept threats encountered in the environment (Rucker &
Galinsky, 2008; Sivanathan & Pettit, 2010).
Consumers choose those brands that are harmonious with
their personality and self-image (Ericksen, 1996; Graeff,
1996; Mehta, 1999; Sirgy, 1982; Sirgy et al., 1997; Sirgy
et al., 1991) and psychologically compare their self-images
with the stereotypical user of a brand (Sirgy, 1982). The
interaction between the image of the product user in various
media and consumer's self-concept results in the consumer
striving for self-image congruence (Sirgy et al., 1997), an
important predictor of consumer behavior (Sirgy, 1982;
Sirgy et al., 1997). Research has also shown that self-image
congruence affects customers' brand preferences and their
purchase intentions (Ericksen, 1996; Mehta, 1999), facilitat-
ing the creation of positive attitudes and behavior toward
brands (Ericksen, 1996; Sirgy, 1982, 1985; Sirgy, Grewal, &
Mangleburg, 2000; Sirgy et al., 1997; Sirgy et al., 1991).
According to Graeff (1996), self-image is positively related
to customers' product evaluations and triggers motives that
create the need for self-consistency and self-esteem.
However, there is a difference in the brand images of socially
(e.g., conspicuous consumption) and privately consumed
brands and, hence, the effects of self-image congruence are
likely to be stronger for publicly consumed products (e.g.,
automobiles and jeans). Hume and Mills (2013) found that
Hanspal and Devasagayam 3
self-esteem and self-image also influenced private purchases
such as intimate women's apparel and fashion.
Due to interplay of factors such as price, income, prod-
uct life cycle, consumer involvement, product utility and
value, image congruence does not always materialize
(Onkvisit & Shaw, 1987). Individuals can vary in the degree
or level (high or low) of self-image congruence experi-
enced by them. The extent to which self-concept is acti-
vated in a given context can also moderate the effect of
self-image congruence on certain consumer behavior. Khan
and Dhar (2006) showed that one instance of bolstering
one's self-concept through a virtuous action could increase
the likelihood of choosing a luxury over a necessity in a
subsequent unrelated choice.
Studies have also been conducted on self-image congru-
ence and specific brands. Jamal andAl-Marri (2007) explored
the impact of self-image congruence and brand preference on
brand satisfaction among expert and novice customers of
automobile brands. Bosnjak and Brand (2008) regressed
consumption-related attitudes and intentions of Chevrolet
car on participants' perceived match between their self-con-
cept and different positive and negative image facets.
Organic foods are purchased more due to perceived health
benefits than their environmental benefits (Hughner et al.,
2007; Shafie & Rennie, 2012; Yiridoe et al., 2005). Although
children could increase their parents' health conscious
choices (Prasad et al., 2008), they could also increase their
purchases of indulgent snack foods (Marshall et al., 2007).
Health (and diet) concerns could shift the way shoppers
approached indulgences and/or influenced their perceptions
of which categories constituted indulgences. Mazar and
Zhong (2010) demonstrated that when people considered
green purchases such as organic food, they felt virtuous for
taking a socially and environmentally positive action and
were more likely to lie or show other negative moral behav-
ior afterward.
A study by Chugani et al. (2015) found that satiation was
linked to a consumer's self-concept and the rate of satiation
to identity-consistent products depended on the consumers
active connections between their sense of self and the focal
identity. Heath and Scott (1998) showed that if the brand-
related information was inconsistent with the customers'
self-concept, it was not likely to gain customers' attention,
acceptance, and retention. Sirgy et al. (1997) reported that
self-image congruence was a strong predictor of brand satis-
faction (see also Jamal, 2004; Jamal & Goode, 2001), which
was generally described as the full meeting of one's expecta-
tions (Oliver, 1997) and was widely recognized not only as a
key influence on the customers'future purchase intentions of
that brand (Taylor & Baker, 1994) but also as the key to
retaining customers and improving profitability (Anderson
et al., 1994). Dunning (2007) advocated that consumers were
dynamic, motivated agents who evaluated both themselves
and the world around them in a manner consistent with a set
of "sacrosanct beliefs" and self-motives.
Bisogni et al. (2012) found that different life experiences,
self-concept, resources, food availability, and conflicting
considerations influenced people in developed countries not
eating according to their ideals for healthy eating. Mai et al.
(2012) showed that health conscious consumers were more
willing to elaborate on health-related product attributes (e.g.,
nutrition facts) and emphasized food naturalness (e.g., non-
genetically engineered foods).
Chang et al. (2003) found that those who had open, con-
scientious, and extroverted personalities had higher needs for
health consciousness and used food traceability labels as a
unique learning device and choice criteria.
Past research on the effectiveness of nutrition labeling has
been remarkably inconclusive, irrespective of whether it was
conducted in a grocery store (Moorman et al. 2012) or res-
taurant settings. Some studies concluded that providing
nutritional information on restaurant menus lowered caloric
intake (e.g., Milich, Anderson, & Mills, 1976; Roberto et al.,
2010; Wisdom, Downs, & Loewenstein, 2010); yet, others
found that the information had no effect (e.g., Elbel et al.,
2009; Finkelstein et al., 2011; Harnack et al., 2008; Mayer
et al., 1987; Schwartz et al., 2012). Even among studies find-
ing an effect, the size of the effect tended to be small. Balfour
et al. (1996) and Yamamoto (2005) found that only a small
proportion of consumers (16% and 29%, respectively)
changed their menu item selection when presented with
nutrition information.
Cornish (2012) examined the impetus behind the con-
sumption of both nutritionally rich and nutritionally poor
functional foods and found that consumers were unable to
distinguish between the two, and believed the health claims
of both. The consumption of nutritionally poor foods could
have a negative impact on consumer well-being, pointing to
the necessity of educating consumers about what constituted
a healthy diet, the role of nutrients as building blocks in
healthy diets, and the importance of choosing appropriate
sources for these nutrients to enable them to make healthier
dietary choices.
A number of studies have been conducted on the impact
of calorie information on labels on choice of low calorie
foods. In a study conducted in New York City (Elbel et al.,
2009), of the 28% of fast food patrons using calorie labels,
88% reported being influenced by the information; of the
68% customers dining at restaurants in Seattle, 45% said the
calorie labels informed their meal choice, and only 13%
reported the information influenced what they ordered for
their child (Tandon et al., 2011).
Ellison et al. (2013) explored the potential relationships
between caloric intake and diners' socioeconomic character-
istics and attitudes in a restaurant field experiment that sys-
tematically varied the caloric information printed on the
menus. Results showed that calorie labels had the greatest
impact on those who were least health conscious. In addition,
using a symbolic calorie label could further reduce the caloric
intake of even the most health conscious patrons. Finally,
4 SAGE Open
calorie labels were more likely to influence the selection of
the main entrée as opposed to supplemental items such as
drinks and desserts. The study concluded that if numeric
calorie labels were implemented, they were most likely to
influence consumers who were less health conscious. To
reach a broader group of diners, a symbolic calorie label may
be preferred as it reduced caloric intake across all levels of
health consciousness. In another study in 2014, the same
authors used field experiment data, to compare the effective-
ness of calorie labels with a "fat tax" at reducing calories
ordered. Results of the research study revealed menu label-
ing could influence food choice. The study found that when
no calorie label was present, a greater proportion of higher
calorie meals (more than 800 calories) were ordered than
when either a numeric or symbolic calorie label was utilized,
and that the symbolic calorie label led to greater calorie
reductions than the numeric calorie label proposed by the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Gad et al. (2013) surveyed U.K. consumers and explained
consumption motivations through examining antecedents of
temporally dominated benefits in application to organic
food. The research findings established significant associa-
tions of level of involvement, prior knowledge, product
usage, and some association of time orientation with the tem-
porally emphasized consumption benefits consumers ulti-
mately pursued.
A number of research studies have focused on messages
used to promote the consumption of healthy foods. Krystallis
and Chrysochou (2011) examined whether health food (low
fat) claims positively influenced levels of brand loyalty and
found that products with health food claims could have
noticeable advantages over competitors. Mohr et al. (2012)
discussed serving size and its impact on calorie information
and consumer guilt. Robinson et al. (2014) found that health-
based messages used to promote fruit and vegetable intake
were limited in their effectiveness. Instead, social norm mes-
sages, suggesting other people were eating healthily, were
more effective.
Mai et al. (2015) found that the goal conflict between
short-term indulgence and long-term health considerations
was at the heart of unhealthy food choices. The research
examined the potential of health consciousness to resolve the
unhealthy = tasty intuition (UTI) and demonstrated that the
UTI partly worked implicitly and independently of health
consciousness.
Specific studies focusing on the impact of socio-demo-
graphic factors on the consumption of healthy food were also
found. Research by Pasternak et al. (1996) showed that
dietary guidelines were often not followed. Glanz et al.
(1998) found that nutrition was more important to women
and older individuals, making these groups more responsive
to menu labels as opposed to young males. Gandini et al.
(2000) suggested that despite the fact that socioeconomic
status (SES) could be assessed in terms of income, occupa-
tion, and/or educational level, each of these dimensions had
its own causal pathway toward dietary habits. Herman et al.
(2003) argued that food choice was influenced by a desire to
convey a certain impression or adhere to social norms (Leary
& Kowalski, 1990; Roth et al., 2001). Shah et al. (2005)
found that the workplace culture, social networks, and future
salience mediated the relationship between occupation and
diet. Grotza et al. (2011) examined the association between
health behavior and socio-demographic variables and Health
Locus of Control (HLC). They found that higher age, low
SES, and migration background were associated with higher
HLC scores.
While Elbel et al. (2011); Elbel et al. (2009) found that
residents of low-income neighborhoods were least likely to
report using calorie labels to make a lower calorie food
choice, Dumanovsky et al. (2011) found consumers in more
affluent communities were most likely to use this informa-
tion. Women, especially those between the age group of 18
and 24 years more so than men, reported using calorie labels
(Dumanovsky et al., 2011; Krieger et al., 2013, Blichfeldt &
Gram, 2013), and compliance with dietary guidelines steadily
fell as SES decreased (Grundy et al. 1999). Casagrande et al.
(2007) and Lewis et al. (2011) suggested that the income­
diet relationship was mediated by access to food and diet
cost (Ahmed et al., 2012).
The educational level­diet relationship might be medi-
ated by attitudes toward healthy eating, knowledge about
food (Booth et al., 1992), family values (McLeod et al.,
2001), and social support for healthy eating (Lee, 2009).
Education seemed to be the most important variable to
explain social differences in dietary habits (Cho et al., 2009;
Huckfeldt & Sprague, 1995). Mediation of the educational
level­diet relationship by attitudes toward healthy eating
was twice as strong in women as in men (Wardle et al., 2004).
LeDoux and Vojnovic (2013) found that among the 1,631
participants surveyed, favorable attitudes toward healthy eat-
ing were associated with both higher educational level and
diet quality, and that higher educated people were more
likely to pay "attention to health when buying food," and
"organic food consumption," but were less likely to cite
health in the perceived role of eating.
Gram and Blichfeldt (2014) explored female students'
food dilemmas to identify reasons why unhealthy food con-
sumption happened despite the students' good intentions to
eat healthy diets and found that female students were well
informed about nutrition, and several of them were experi-
enced cooks from home but "bad" food sneaked into their
diets, because of lack of time and energy, pressure from their
studies and food cravings, along with more liberal rules in
social situations.
Research studies also focused on the role of emotions and
food choices. Ogden (2009) found that the link between
emotions and food consumption was well documented, and
both negative and positive emotions influenced eating behav-
ior (Desmet & Schifferstein, 2008). Childers et al. (2011)
advocated that emotional issues such as boredom, loneliness,
Hanspal and Devasagayam 5
unhappiness, and stress affected U.S. students' consumption
of particularly unhealthy foods.
Some researchers focused on factors influencing con-
sumption of healthy foods. Herman et al. (2003) found that
social influence affected eating, that behaviors were influ-
enced by social comparisons (Hupkens et al. 2005;
Mussweiler, 2003; Mussweiler et al., 2004), and that healthy
eating was a normative standard (Jutel, 2005). McFerran
et al. (2010a) examined the effect of body type of consumers
on the food consumption of other consumers around them
and found that people chose a larger portion following
another consumer who first selected a large quantity but that
this portion was significantly smaller if the other was obese
than if she was thin.
An interesting study by Karmarkar and Bollinger (2015)
focused on shopping with reusable grocery bags and its
impact on consumers'in-store behavior. Using scanner panel
data from a single California location of a major grocery
chain, and controlling for consumer heterogeneity, they dem-
onstrated that bringing one's own bags increased purchases
of not only environmentally friendly organic foods but also
indulgent foods.
A research by Huneke et al. (2015) examined the effect of
service employees' appearance on consumers' food choice
using an experimental study, involving a video manipulation
and eye-tracking technique. The study demonstrated that
exposure to the overweight employee did not stimulate
greater attention to unhealthy meal alternatives, whereas
exposure to the employee who displayed an unhealthy life-
style did.
Kelly et al. (2016) focused on an increasing societal
impact of ill health in later life. They found that lack of time
(due to family, household, and occupational responsibilities),
access issues (to transport, facilities, and resources), finan-
cial costs, entrenched attitudes and behaviors, restrictions in
the physical environment, low SES, and lack of knowledge
were the recurring barriers. Specific issues relating to popu-
lation and culture were identified relating to health
inequalities.
Thus, the studies reviewed have covered diverse aspects
of consumption of healthy foods but most of them have
focused on factors influencing purchase of healthy foods or
the impact of food labeling legislation on choice of food.
Some research was found on self-image as a variable influ-
encing consumption of various products but there is a lack of
research on the self-image of health conscious consumers
and the relationships between self-image and consumption
of healthy labeled foods. Furthermore, none of the studies
attempted to identify how consumers defined themselves as
being health conscious and how this might affect the choice
of foods labeled healthy. It is to fill this gap that the present
study is designed.
The objective of this research is to better understand how
consumers view themselves in terms of health consciousness
and whether some demographic factors are associated more
significantly with the health conscious self-image, and fur-
ther, whether consumers with a health conscious self-image
are more prone to purchase food labeled "healthy."
Hypotheses Development
There are no two opinions that with an increased conscious-
ness to consume healthy foods and beverages, understand-
ing the factors that influence consumer preferences toward
health food is becoming increasingly important in the mar-
ket today. Food consumption decisions are no longer
restricted to being personal but carry a social image and are
modified by peer approval that is dependent on the types of
food consumed by individuals, especially because food is
very frequently consumed in a social setting with family,
friends, colleagues, and others. Self-image influences the
consumption of products and that, in fact, consumers strive
toward maintaining self-image congruity and as such choose
products that support their self-image. Research has also
shown that if products fail to match the self-image held by
consumers, they are likely to avoid consuming them. To
understand how consumers who support the self-image of
being health conscious choose products labeled healthy, it is
important to understand what constitutes the self-image of
health consciousness.
This study aims to find out how people who consume
products labeled healthy choose to describe themselves in
terms of health consciousness. Do all the consumers define
themselves in terms of the same variables? Can we address
them as one segment of consumers who are concerned about
their health? Are there differences in the perceptions of
health consciousness among consumers regarding what con-
stitutes a health conscious self-image? This leads us to exam-
ine the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1: There are differences on account of vari-
ables used to describe the self-image of health conscious-
ness among consumers of healthy labeled foods.
Previous research has also shown that demographic fac-
tors influence the consumption of food. It will then be perti-
nent to find out whether consumers who consider themselves
as health conscious are likely to differ in their demographics.
Thus, we need to examine a second hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2: There are differences among health con-
scious consumers on account of demographic factors,
such as age, gender, education, and relationship status.
Research has also shown that consumers belonging to dif-
ferent demographic factors are likely to differ in terms of
their consumption behavior. Would this analogy be applica-
ble to consumers with a health conscious self-image in their
consumption of healthy labeled foods too? We, therefore,
need to understand as to whether consumers holding the
6 SAGE Open
health conscious self-image actually consume food labeled
healthy when they are hungry or whether they choose prod-
ucts that are not labeled as such. This leads us to our third
hypotheses:
Hypothesis 3: Consumers holding a health conscious
self-image will consume only those products that are
labeled healthy.
Method
The study focused on understanding the factors that consti-
tuted the self-image of health consciousness and its effect on
actual purchase of healthy food. A brief (5-6 min) self-
administered online questionnaire was designed, pretested,
and distributed to a random sample via emails. The email
invitation provided a brief description of the study and a link
to the survey. The respondents were allowed to opt to take
the survey by filling an informed consent form prior to begin-
ning the survey itself, but were unable to go back to previous
screens to review or revise their responses, to reduce a halo
bias that could contaminate results.
The survey included 15 items to measure the self-image
of people toward health consciousness, and questions related
to demographics and actual purchase behavior. For the pur-
pose of this study, the Health Consciousness Scale created by
Stephen Gould in 1988 was modified. Of the original nine
items, four items were selected from this scale and 11 addi-
tional items were added to it. Two focus groups were con-
ducted to identify behaviors related to the consumption of
healthy labeled foods. These 11 additional items were identi-
fied and developed from the conversations in these groups.
Two types of scale options were used: a five-point scale
ranging from not like me at all (1) to like me (5) to describe
themselves and another scale where they described their
level of agreement from strongly disagree (1) to strongly
agree (5) with their activities and opinions related to health
conscious behavior. SPSS 18 was used for analysis.
Sample Profile
Care was taken to obtain unbiased data from different age
groups, gender, education levels, ethnicities, and relationship
statuses. The total sample consisted of 390 respondents. The
incidence rate was 92.6%. The sample emerged to be largely
Caucasian (98.7%), of which 26.5% (95) were male and
73.5% (263) were female. The respondents belonged to five
different age groups. Two age segments appeared to be
strongly represented, 18 to 22 years old (46%) and those
above 41 years of age (36%). All but 11% of the respondents
graduated with a high school diploma and 24% had acquired
a bachelor's degree. Approximately 52% of the sample con-
sisted of respondents still studying for their undergraduate
degree, and about 64% were either in a relationship or mar-
ried and 36% were single.
Reliability
Before conducting further analysis of the data, it was
important to assess the reliability of the scales used for
measuring health consciousness. The user-defined missing
values were treated as missing and statistics are based on
all cases with valid data. For the purpose of calculating
reliability, 29 cases were excluded list-wise as the
responses were incomplete and 361 cases were used for
this computation. The analysis revealed a Cronbach's
alpha of .753. The value of the alpha coefficient if an item
was deleted was computed to ascertain whether its value
could be further improved (Table 1).
The analysis revealed that if we dropped item number 9,
the value of the alpha coefficient would increase to .787. It
was, however, not dropped from further analysis because
its deletion would have increased the scale variance. To fur-
ther understand whether some of the variables consumers
used to describe themselves as health conscious could be
further reduced, a factor analysis of the 15 statements was
conducted.
Are There Different Self-Image Factors of Health
Consciousness?
To identify prominent self-image variables, exploratory fac-
tor analysis was used. To assess whether the data were ade-
quate for this purpose, the value of Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin
(KMO) measure of sampling adequacy was computed (Table
2). This measure varies between 0 and 1, and although values
closer to 1 are better, the value of .6 is a suggested minimum.
The KMO measure was .840, which is considered good for
conducting the factor analysis. The analysis also meets the
requirements of Bartlett's test of sphericity, which tests the
hypothesis that the correlation matrix is an identity matrix,
and there are correlations in the data set that are appropriate
for factor analysis.
The principal component method and varimax rotation
were used. Factors with eigenvalues above one (EV  1;
Kaiser, 1958) were selected after conducting the scree test
(Cattell, 1966). This resulted in identifying five factors,
explaining 69% variance. The rotated component matrix was
used to identify statements composing each factor. The
rotated factor loadings (factor pattern matrix) represent both
how the variables are weighted for each factor and the cor-
relation between the variables and the factor. Being correla-
tions, their possible values range from 1 to +1. Furthermore,
to identify the constituent statements, those with factor load-
ings below .26 were ignored. Items that did not load on any
of the retained factors or with factor loading <.26 were
sequentially removed based on the recommendation pro-
vided by Stevens (2002). He suggested that a loading of .722
can be considered significant for a sample size of 50, a load-
ing greater than .512 is significant for a sample size of 100,
and a loading greater than .364 is significant for a sample
Hanspal and Devasagayam 7
size of 200. By the same reasons, therefore, a factor that con-
sists of a single statement that loads high is considered highly
desirable. Furthermore, statements that loaded highly for
more than one factor were retained only toward the factor
they loaded highest on and were removed from consideration
from other factors. Accordingly, Table 3 lists the statements
that were found to constitute the factors
Description of Factors
The five factors identified by the research portray the differ-
ent self-image variables that constitute each factor. These are
described below.
Self-Image Factor 1
This factor represented the self-image that identified
itself with an overly concern for health. The respondents
subscribing to this self-image constantly reflect about
their health and believe that they live a healthy lifestyle.
They closely monitor their physical condition throughout
the day, are self-conscious about their health, and try to
make healthy choices in their food consumption deci-
sions. They are, thus, actively seeking healthy labeled
food products. Accordingly, we labeled this factor as
health conscious.
Self-Image Factor 2
This image identifies with those who like to eat healthy, as it
is important for them to monitor their calorie intake. They
correlate a healthy body with an ideal weight and make efforts
to avoid obesity. They actively search for nutritional informa-
tion and like to consume products with claims of low-fat
ingredients. They, thus, associate healthy eating to mean con-
trol over calorie and fat intake. They might even feel guilty if
they discovered that they made an unhealthy choice. This
self-image factor is named as weight conscious.
Self-Image Factor 3
This self-image identified itself with those who considered
themselves as very brand conscious in choosing products
labeled healthy. They do not prefer generic products and
need the assurance of a known brand name. They are also
unlikely to feel comfortable trying new and unfamiliar
brands or unbranded food products that make health claims.
They are brand loyal and may sometimes even choose
unhealthy products and purchase their preferred brand
instead. This factor was labeled the brand conscious.
Self-Image Factor 4
This factor represents those who are very price conscious
and choose brands that are not expensive. They also trust
advertising. The two factors combine to indicate that their
choice of healthy labeled products depends on whether such
brands are well advertised and have a low price. They are
unlikely to use unfamiliar brands of healthy labeled food or
items that are expensive. They are also brand conscious to
the extent that they may not try unbranded products even if
they promise a health benefit and are inexpensive. This fac-
tor was called the value conscious.

Self-Image Factor 5
This factor consists of those who like to try new brands and
are more open to experimenting with them. They are the
early adopters of food products that are new that may or may
not carry a health benefit. They focus more on the experi-
ences they have with brands rather than seek assurance from
well-known brands. They are likely to try new unknown food
items, which makes them least brand loyal, but they might
choose products that are not healthy. This factor is labeled
variety conscious.
Thus, the results indicated that there were at least five dif-
ferent self-image factors that could explain the health con-
scious self-image held by consumers of healthy products.
Consumers perceive themselves differently even on health
consciousness, and are likely to differ on the basis of how
strongly they associate themselves on the health conscious-
ness continuum. They are likely to have different expecta-
tions from healthy labeled foods and choose different types
of labels that describe healthy foods. The next section identi-
fies whether specific demographic factors were associated
with the different self-image factors identified thus far.
Self-Image Factors and Demographics
It was assumed that every health conscious consumer would
display a similar behavior toward healthy labeled foods and
that such consumers would share similar demographics.
Because the self-images of health conscious consumers were
found to be different, it was of interest to identify whether the
factors representing different self-images related to same or
different demographics. The following demographics--age,
gender, marital status, and level of education--were studied.
Thus, sub-hypotheses for our second hypothesis were devel-
oped. It was hypothesized that,
Hypothesis 2a: Consumers choosing different self-image
factors are likely to differ on account of age.
Hypothesis 2b: Consumers choosing different self-image
factors are likely to differ on account of gender.
Hypothesis 2c: Consumers choosing different self-image
factors are likely to differ on account of education.
Hypothesis 2d: Consumers choosing different self-image
factors are likely to differ on the basis of their relationship
status.
The results of the analysis are presented below.
Relationship Between Self-Image Factors and Age
Respondents were classified into five age groups. To under-
stand the relationship between the different self-image fac-
tors and age groups, an ANOVA was conducted. The F test
was applied to test the significance of differences between
two variances: the among group variance and the between
group variance. Significant F values indicate that the means
are significantly different from one another.
The results showed significant relationships between
self-image and age for the health conscious, F(4, 356) =
4.22, p = .002; weight conscious, F(4, 356) = 4.51, p =
.001; and value conscious, F(4, 356) = 5.42, p = .000. No
significant relationship was found between the brand and
variety conscious self-image factors and age. The descrip-
tive for self-image factors and significant age groups are
summarized in Table 4.

The Tukey­Kramer multiple comparison of means was
employed to understand whether the differences between the
means pertaining to age groups were significant (Table 5).
The results reveal that for the health conscious self-image,
as compared with the age group of 18 to 22 years, there was
a highly significant mean difference for the age group of 41
to 59 years (M difference = 0.59, sig. = .001) and as com-
pared with the age group of 23 to 30 years, there was a highly
significant mean difference for the age group of 41 to 49
years (M difference = 0.59, sig. = .001). The mean differ-
ences were not significant for the 50+ age group. In other
words, the age group of 41 to 49 years was different in their
self-image of health consciousness both from the 18 to 22
years and 23 to 30 years age groups. Considering the means
and standard deviations (Table 4), we see that the highest
mean for health conscious self-image was for the age group
of 41 to 49 years (M = 0.45, SD = 0.96).
For the weight conscious self-image, as compared with
the age group of 18 to 22 years, there was a highly signifi-
cant mean difference for the age groups of 31 to 40 years
(M difference = 0.70, sig. = .009) and 41 to 59 years (M
difference = 0.48, sig. = .009). The differences between the
18 to 22 years group were not significant for the 23 to 30
years or 50+ years age groups. In other words, the age
groups of 31 to 40 years and 41 to 49 years were signifi-
cantly different in their self-image of weight conscious-
ness from the 18 to 22 years age group. Considering the
descriptives (Table 4), we see that the highest mean for
weight conscious self-image was for the age group of 31 to
40 years (M = 0.51, SD = 0.90).
For the value conscious self-image, as compared with the
18 to 22 age group, the mean differences were highly signifi-
cant for the age groups of 41 to 50 years (M difference =
0.56, sig. = .001) and 50+ years (M difference = 0.50, sig. =
.004). The differences were not significant for the age groups
of 23 to 30 years and 31 to 40 years. The descriptives (Table 4)
show that the highest mean for value conscious self-image
was for the age group of 41 to 40 years (M = 0.35, SD = 0.90)
and second highest for 50+ years (M = 0.30, SD = 0.96).
Thus, the findings suggest that there are differing self-
image perceptions among age groups on the health, weight,
and value conscious factors.At a younger age, the consumers
are still not financially independent and have limited means.
Furthermore, their anxiety about health and weight is spurred
by their desire to look attractive as they join college, look for
partners, or enter the job market. The concerns around weight
start changing around middle age, when career and familial
responsibilities take precedence over maintaining the normal
physical exercise routine. These responsibilities also moti-
vate the consumers in the above 40 years age group to obtain
more value in their brand choice. Furthermore, the percep-
tions of an ideal or acceptable weight might be different for
people belonging to diverse age groups, differences in height,
and gender. Thus, within the broad category of weight con-
scious consumers supporting a self-image of health con-
sciousness, the choices may be different.
As consumers age, they are likely to seek more value in
their purchases of healthy labeled products. Students and
younger consumers are able to settle down financially by age
30. Their choice of healthy labeled food may not necessarily
be dictated by the value they obtain from such foods as they
celebrate their new-found financial independence and, at the
same time, start their own families. The senior consumers,
however, may seek more value in their purchases as they

provide for their impending retirement. No significant differ-
ences were found for self-image groups of brand conscious
or variety conscious factors on the basis of age.
Relationship Between Self-Image Factors and
Gender
The sample consisted of 95 men and 266 women. Because
gender influences the consumption of some products, it was
important to identify whether it influenced the consumption
of products labeled "healthy."
A cross tabulation by gender for the self-image variables
was conducted to understand whether there were significant
differences among men and women in how they perceived
themselves with regard to health consciousness. The results
are presented in Table 6.
The results reveal that the gender differences in self-
image factors are significant among men and women for the
weight, brand, and variety conscious self-image factors.
Although both genders are weight and brand conscious in
their self-image, men appear to be more weight, brand, and
variety conscious as compared with women. There are no
significant differences among men and women on the health
and value conscious self-image. While previous research
(Glanz et al., 1998; Gram & Blichfeldt, 2014) showed that
women were more health conscious than men, this study
reveals that men are becoming more weight, brand, and vari-
ety conscious in their selection of healthy labeled foods. This
change could probably be explained with changing socio-
demographic environment where more and more men are
choosing to remain single, or engaged in building a body or
are staying at home to take care of kids and, in this process,
improve the quality of diet consumed by them. Because more
women are choosing to go out to work, they are unable to
maintain the consumption of healthy foods due to time con-
straints and, therefore, may not be able to necessarily choose
healthy labeled food that might help them influence their
weight or to find time to purchase branded items. They may
also be more brand loyal than men because the relationship
with the variety conscious self-image was not significant.
The results are supported by the study conducted by Gram
and Blichfeldt (2014), which found that despite the fact that
female students were more health conscious, their actual
consumption of food was becoming more unhealthy due to
lack of time and energy and work pressure.
Self-Image Factors and Relationship
Status
The respondents were asked to select any one of the follow-
ing to describe their relationship status--single, in a relation-
ship, married, divorced, separated, and widowed. Because
the responses in the two categories divorced and widowed
were very few, they were merged in the category of single.
Only three categories were, therefore, used for further analy-
sis--single, in a relationship, and married.
To understand the relationship between the self-image
factors and relationship status, we computed ANOVA. The
results for ANOVA for the self-image factors showed a sig-
nificant relationship between the relationship status and self-
image of the weight conscious, F(2, 356) = 3.452, p = .03,
and a highly significant relationship with the value con-
scious, F(2, 356) = 4.989, p = .01. There was no significant
relationship between the self-images of health, brand, and
variety conscious consumers and relationship status. The
descriptives are presented in Table 7.
Tukey­Kramers' multiple comparison of means revealed
that there were significant differences between the married
respondents and those who were either single or in a relation-
ship with regard to the weight and value conscious self-
image factors (Table 8).
As compared with singles, the married respondents are
likely to significantly differ in their weight conscious self-
image (M difference = 0.33, sig. = .02), value consciousness
self-image from both singles (M difference = 0.37, sig. = .01),
and those in a relationship (M difference = 0.32, sig. = 03). The
descriptives in case of the weight conscious self-image were

higher for singles (M = 0.18, SD = 1.06) as compared with mar-
ried respondents (M = 0.15, SD = 0.95). In case of value con-
scious self-image, the married enjoyed a higher mean value (M
= 0.23, SD = 0.99) as compared with singles (M = 0.15, SD =
0.95) and those in a relationship (M = 0.10, SD = 0.98).
The results appear to be true as singles are more con-
cerned about their weight, looking forward to getting into
relationships, to look more physically appealing as compared
with the married who become more accepting of their own or
partner's weight gain. Furthermore, the married respondents
are the most value conscious as they deal with marital and
familial responsibilities, and the desire to save.
Self-Image and Education
The respondents reported the following educational qualifi-
cations: high school diploma, freshman, sophomore, junior,
senior, bachelor's degree completed, and master's degree
completed. ANOVA was employed to identify the relation-
ship between self-image factors and education. The results
revealed that there was a highly significant relationship
between weight conscious self-image, F(6, 352) = 4.002, p =
.001, and education. No other self-image was found to have
a significant relationship with education. The descriptives
for the weight conscious self-image are reported in Table 9.
To ascertain which educational groups differed on this
self-image factor, the Tukey­Kramer's multiple comparison
of means test was conducted (Table 10).
The analysis showed that there were highly significant dif-
ferences in the means for graduates in their self-image about
weight consciousness relative to freshmen (M difference =
0.79, p = .009), sophomores (M difference = 0.85, p = .001),
and juniors (M difference = 0.62, p = .003) in college. The
descriptives for the self-image and education revealed that the
respondents with a master's degree (M = 0.50, SD = 0.71) had
the highest mean value followed by sophomores (M = 0.36,
SD = 1.19), freshman (M = 0.30, SD = 0.94), and juniors (M
= 0.12, SD = 1.03). This implies that consumers at different
educational levels assign a different meaning to what they
perceive as being weight conscious. As consumers get more
educated, their self-image with regard to what weight they
consider as healthy also changes. Thus, people subscribing to
different self-image factors differ on account of demograph-
ics. Next, we explore the relationship between the self-image
factors identified above and preferences for actual consump-
tion of healthy foods when the consumers were hungry.
Consumer Behavior: Preference for
Healthy Foods When Hungry
Data were collected on whether the respondents preferred to
consume products that were "healthy," "not healthy," or had
"no preference" for either when they were hungry. ANOVA
was conducted to identify relationship between the self-
image factors identified above and the consumption prefer-
ences of consumers when they were hungry. The results
reveal that the differences were highly significant for four
self-image factors--health conscious, F(2, 358) = 41.40, p =
.001; weight conscious, F(2, 358) = 30.03, p = .001; brand
conscious, F(2, 358) = 4.27, p = .01; and variety conscious,
F(2, 358) = 4.75, p = .009. The differences were not signifi-
cant for the value conscious self-image factor.
To identify which of the self-image groups were signifi-
cantly different on account of preference for healthy labeled
foods, Tukey­Kramers' multiple comparison of means was
employed (Table 11).

For the health conscious consumers, the mean differences
were highly significant for those who preferred healthy food
as compared with those who preferred unhealthy product (M
difference = 1.71, sig. = .000) or those who were indifferent
(M difference = 0.71, sig. = .000) when hungry. Highly sig-
nificant differences were also found between those who pre-
ferred unhealthy food and those without such preference (M
difference = 1.01, sig. = .000). The descriptives support this
result and show that as compared with making healthy
choices (M = 0.35, SD = 0.92) or having no preference (M =
0.36, SD = 0.89) for healthy labeled food, the consumers
with the health conscious self-image are more likely to
choose an unhealthy product (M = 1.36, SD = 0.83).
Consumers with a weight conscious self-image who chose
healthy foods had significant differences from those who
selected unhealthy options (M difference = 0.68, sig. = .031)
and highly significant differences with those who had no
such preferences (M difference = 0.78, sig. = .000). More
consumers supporting the weight conscious self-image are
likely to have no preference (M = 0.43, SD = 1.03) for healthy
products when hungry, but some may choose a healthy option
(M = 0.35, SD = 0.85) over an unhealthy option (M = 0.33,
SD = 1.10).
Similarly, for the brand conscious self-image factor,
highly significant differences were found between those
who would choose the healthy options and those who had
no such preferences (M difference = 0.32, sig. = .01). A
look at the descriptives (Table 12) revealed that those who
had no preferences (M = 0.19, SD = 1) had a higher mean

value as compared with those who selected healthy options
(M = 0.13, SD = 0.99).
Among those with a variety conscious self-image, the dif-
ferences were significant among for those choosing healthy
options and those choosing unhealthy options (M difference
= 0.69, sig. = .04). The descriptives for the variety conscious
revealed the highest mean for those who chose unhealthy
options (M = 0.57, SD = 1.29). Thus, the variety conscious
are likely to choose unhealthy options as well. The relation-
ships were not significant for the value conscious consumers
and they may focus more on price/value rather than the
health benefit. These results show that some consumers may
not actually conduct themselves in a way that supports their
self-image.
Conclusion and Implications
Thus, the research shows that consumers with a self-image
of health consciousness differ in how they see themselves
with regard to both their image and the preference for healthy
labeled products. The study identified five different self-
image factors: the health conscious, weight conscious, brand
conscious, value conscious, and the variety conscious. The
differences in self-image are likely to influence what the
label "healthy" means to each of the self-image groups and
the preference for healthy labeled products. Marketers will
need to understand these differences and design their prod-
ucts, advertising, and communication strategies to appeal to
these different segments
Furthermore, the self-image factors have particular rela-
tionships with the different demographic variables (Table 13).
We found significant relationships between the self-image
factors and age, gender, relationship status, and education.
For example, consumers who held the health conscious self-
image differed on account of age, and the age groups of 18 to
22 years old were significantly different from the 41 to 49
years old, and from 31- to 39-year-old consumers with a
weight conscious self-image. In terms of value conscious-
ness, 18- to 22-year-old consumers differed significantly
from above 50 years of age and 23 to 30 years old differed
significantly from 41 to 49 years of age. Thus, the meaning
of a healthy self-image changed with age. The same advertis-
ing appeals will, therefore, not work with all consumers.
Gender was found to be having a significant relationship
with the different self-image variables. Both men and women
were more likely to be holding the image of health and
weight consciousness, but compared with women, men were
more likely to see themselves as weight, brand, and variety
conscious. These results do not seem to support previous
research findings, which concluded that women are often
more responsible eaters than their male peers; they tend to
eat more vegetables, less fast food, and drink less alcohol
than male students (Beasley, Hackett, & Maxwell, 2004); or
that female food consumers seem to experience conflicting
desires and practices when consuming food as they are typi-
cally more concerned with healthy eating (Rasmussen et al.,
2012), more preoccupied with their weight, and often have a
higher consumption of chocolate and other sweets than men
(Rasmussen et al., 2012). This study, however, sees a rever-
sal and actually finds that as compared with women, men are
taking charge of their own health by consuming a greater
variety of healthy labeled foods that help them control weight
gain and prefer branded products.
Similarly, the relationship status influences the self-image
people have with regard to the consumption of healthy
labeled products. In terms of education, the study found sig-
nificant differences on the self-image of weight conscious-
ness between the less educated (high school) and those who
had undergraduate (and seniors) or graduate qualifications.
These results support results from previous research by

LeDoux and Vojnovic (2013), which shows that education
plays an important role in the selection of healthy diets.
Thus, we find the existence of sub-segments of self-
images that would require different strategies for marketing
healthy products. Not only will they need to be advertised to
differently but the healthy food products and services will
also need to be designed, labeled, priced, and packaged dif-
ferently keeping in mind the different meanings the healthy
self-image holds for different consumers. Brands after all are
symbols that consumers choose to express themselves with
and these findings have important repercussions for how the
brands engage with their consumers.
The actual preferences of consumers who had a self-
image of health, weight, or brand consciousness were found
to be significantly congruent with their self-images. They
appeared to choose more products labeled healthy as they did
not differ significantly among themselves, but consumers
with a self-image of value or variety consciousness were
more likely to be different with regard to preferences for
products that were labeled healthy. Marketers need to adopt
strategies that emphasize value or variety to attract these seg-
ments of consumers toward the consumption of foods labeled
healthy. In addition, these segments require better pricing-
and value-based offers to attract them to such foods.
The strategies to market healthy foods for example to
those holding the self-image of being brand conscious will
require building brand awareness and recall and focus on
building a positive brand image and unique positioning to
appeal to target consumers. Innovative customer engagement
strategies will be required to succeed in the marketplace. To
attract the value conscious consumers, successful strategies
would require assessing the customer lifetime value of con-
sumers who prefer less expensive healthy foods. The manu-
facturers will have to weigh in on benefit of attaining the
profits through higher volume versus profits through pre-
mium pricing. Accompanying these will of course be sepa-
rate positioning and distribution strategies. There cannot be a
one-size-fits-all approach to marketing products labeled
healthy. Evidence has shown that health conscious consum-
ers are more preventive in their general outlook than less
health conscious consumers and that they tend to believe
more in the efficacy of actions that can benefit their health
(Gould, 1988; Jayanti & Burns, 1998).
This research points out that within the self-image factors
that differentiate health conscious consumers, the marketers
also need to consider the demographics if they need to better
target their consumers to obtain better sales. There are sub-
segments within the broad segments identified by the five
self-image factors with significantly distinct preferences,
demographics, and behavior patterns. Furthermore, even
though consumers consider themselves as being health con-
scious, the actual choice of healthy food products will also be
influenced by value perceptions and variety offered.
According to USDA report by the Economic Research
Service (2015), over the past 30 years, food prices have risen
faster than some other consumer goods, such as housing and
transportation. Inflation-adjusted (real) prices for poultry
and dairy products have been stable, while real prices for red
meats, eggs, and fresh fruits and vegetables grew by 18%,
21.5%, and 40% between 1985 and 2014, respectively. Over
the same time period, real prices for fats and oils, sugar and
sweets, and nonalcoholic beverages fell. The price of corn
sweetener decreased nearly 20% since 1985. Processed
foods, many of which are included in the sugar and sweets
category, are less affected by commodity-level price swings
and are generally more closely linked to the costs of inputs
such as electricity and wages. Industrial electricity costs and
manufacturing wages both increased at a rate about 10%
lower than overall inflation since 1985. These price trends
will further affect the consumption of healthy labeled prod-
ucts as consumer expectations from these products will differ
depending upon their self-image. In these times, when mar-
keters are faced with tough competition and increasing
accountability on the marketing rate of return, challenges of
improving customer relationship and experience manage-
ment, the basic equation of catering to the right consumer
segments is becoming more important than ever.
Limitations and Further Research
The data have a limited generalizability having been con-
fined to the state of New York. The survey may be distributed
nationwide to ascertain whether additional segments of self-
images regarding consumption of healthy products emerge
or whether there is a replication of these image factors.
Questions pertaining to income and occupation need to be
added to the survey. There is also a need to look at situational
factors that may influence the decision to purchase healthy
labeled foods and consumer perceptions of brands that are
available to health conscious consumers. Furthermore, there
is a need to conduct studies on value and variety conscious
consumers to identify what strategies could attract these seg-
ments to consciously choosing healthy foods, especially in
the light of the fact that the cost of health care is also among
the highest in these segments.
