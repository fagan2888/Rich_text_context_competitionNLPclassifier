Introduction
Michel Chevalier was one of the most emblematic Frenchmen
of the 19th century. He was not only an economist who mod-
ified Saint-Simonian positions to liberal ones but also a spe-
cial world traveler and an influential advisor to Napoleon III.
This work will analyze Chevalier's arguments on the role
of canal tariffs in economic growth. Although Chevalier also
studied import duties, this article will focus on Chevalier's
thoughts concerning transport tariffs. As we shall see,
Chevalier was a common reference in the French debates on
the definition of tariffs in the transportation sector.
For Chevalier, this topic became of the utmost importance
after his journey to the United States in the 1830s. Henceforth,
Chevalier's discussion of tariffs became one of the most rel-
evant discussions of European canal tariffs produced by a
19th-century economist. The relevance of Chevalier's dis-
cussion of tariffs culminated in a free trade treaty between
England and France, notably named the Cobden­Chevalier
Treaty.
This work will examine Chevalier's discussion of canal
tariffs. We will do so considering his life and his main eco-
nomic work, Le Cours d'Économie Politique. There are sev-
eral aspects that emphasize the importance of the early
19th-century discussions about tariffs or tolls. First, tolls
were realized to be elements that negatively impacted eco-
nomic growth. Second, they were key elements in the debate
pitting individual freedom against public financing. Third,
reinforced by Saint-Simon and his disciples (including
Chevalier), tolls were perceived as decelerating the rhythm
of industrialization. Finally, the French debates on canal tar-
iffs produced the basis for the economic thought of the next
generation of European thinkers, such as Léon Walras and
the Lausanne School.
We tested a crucial element of Chevalier's discussion: the
inefficiency of 1830s French tariffs. This testing was con-
ducted using Chevalier's data and a modern instrument of
efficiency evaluation: Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). It
is important to perform this exercise (revise Chevalier's
claims) because using current statistical techniques, we can
enlighten the field as to whether the analysis of Chevalier
was robustly founded by a proper statistical discussion.
The remainder of the article is organized as follows. In
section "A Note on Chevalier's Life and Bibliography," we
review Chevalier's biography and published works. We also
use references not only to historians but also to contempo-
raries to show Chevalier's impact on academics and politics.
In section "Chevalier's Cours d'Économie Politique and His
Discussions of Tariffs," we focus on his thoughts regarding
tariffs, referring to his masterpiece Le Cours d'Économie
Politique and to his letters. In section "Toward a Discussion
on Chevalier's Claims Using DEA Analysis," we discuss

Discussing Chevalier's Data on the
Efficiency of Tariffs for American and
French Canals in the 1830s
Paulo Reis Mourao1
Abstract
This article revisits Michel Chevalier's work and discussions of tariffs. Chevalier shifted from Saint-Simonism to economic
liberalism during his life in the 19th century. His influence was soon perceived in the political world and economic debates,
mainly because of his discussion of tariffs as instruments of efficient transport policies. This work discusses Chevalier's
thoughts on tariffs by revisiting his masterpiece, Le Cours d'Économie Politique. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was
conducted to test Chevalier's hypothesis on the inefficiency of French tariffs. This work showed that Chevalier's claims on
French tariffs are not validated by DEA.

A Note on Chevalier's Life and
Bibliography
Michel Chevalier (1806-1879) was a French economist liv-
ing in a very interesting period of the 19th century. The
France known by Chevalier was a country characterized by a
proindustrialization movement.
Michel Chevalier's social, economic, and political
thoughts changed over the course of his life. Many authors
consider the young Michel Chevalier to be a disciple of Saint-
Simon, primarily concerned about improving the quality of
life for his contemporary French industrial workers (Takashi,
1980). As he aged, however, Chevalier increased his distance
from the orthodox Saint-Simonians,1 although he retained the
idea that social and economic development should be shared
among all. As Drolet (2008) noted, "Chevalier moved from
being one of the fiercest critics of France's political establish-
ment to one of its most ardent defenders" (p. 1229).
Campagnolo (2009) stated that during his life, Chevalier
always believed that both productive entrepreneurship and
state intervention were necessary for a competitive environ-
ment. Of course, this universality was not well received by
the most orthodox thinkers, like Carl Grun (1845), who wrote
the following about Michel Chevalier:
M. Chevalier still refers with great sympathy to the industrialists
. . . But to the disciple, the industrialists are no longer, as they
were for his master, the proletarians; he includes capitalists,
entrepreneurs and workers in one concept, that is to say, he
includes the idlers in a category which should only embrace the
poorest and most numerous class. (Grun,1845, p. 102)
The reasons for this distance from the orthodoxy are both
physical and ideological. In other words, this distancing
from orthodoxy is due to his journey across the Atlantic
Ocean, where he had the opportunity to experience different
people, different economic organizations, and, especially, a
new inspiration for his ideas to develop the French economy
(Adamson, 2005).
Before this journey to America (1833-1834), Chevalier
was focused on the European reality and wrote in favor of
pan-Mediterranean free trade, which he argued was also
important for peace between the East and West:
The Mediterranean was an arena, a closed field, where for thirty
centuries, the East and the West fought battles. Henceforth the
Mediterranean must be like a vast forum where all the previously
divided nations will unite together.The Mediterranean will become
the wedding-bed of the East and the West. (Chevalier, 18322)
His journey to the United States from 1833 to 1834
(essential to understanding his future critiques of French
tolls) was described in his book Society, Manners, and
Politics in the United States.3 This book is a composition
concerning the American economy (or society) observed as
"a model of industry." According to Chevalier, it should be
highlighted how poor Irish men thrived after so little time in
America. The reasons for success point not just to some par-
ticularly American institutions (such as a business culture
and proemployment education) but mainly to efficient
American means of transport and internal tariffs; namely, it
was the tariffs on the Erie Canal that exerted a special effect
on Chevalier's observations, as is documented in detail in the
following section. The transport and tariffs that Chevalier
observed were the result of intense federal and state debates
that had begun in the 1820s (initially with the strong opposi-
tion to protectionist tariffs from Southern congressmen;
DiLorenzo, 2004; Temin, 1999).
After visiting the United States, a trip that is well docu-
mented by Jennings (2006), Chevalier also traveled to
Mexico and Cuba (1835), where he strengthened the idea of
a Panama Canal linking the Atlantic to the Pacific and devel-
oped his principles of a Pan-American alliance of countries.
According to Monteiro (2008), after this tour, Chevalier
became one of the first authors to explore the concept of a
"Latin American country." This was mainly due to his sup-
port of LatinAmerican countries being freed from the admin-
istrations of Portugal and Spain.
These ideas were influential in South American countries,
developing, for instance, the basis of Poucel's thoughts
regarding the need for reinforcing French support to the
young South American countries that were reaching
independence.4
After returning to Europe, Chevalier visited Great Britain
in 1851, recognizing that England's prosperity was due to
industrialization. This industrialization was symbolized by
the Crystal Palace in Sydenham, which was built for the
London Great Exhibition of 1851. The construction of this
palace impressed him deeply, especially its rapidity and the
building's design and transparency to light. However, he was
mainly impressed by British tariffs, which could be noted as
the first signal of his favor of the future Cobden­Chevalier
Treaty5 (although Nye, 1991, confirmed that British tariffs
were consistently lower than those of France).
As Maddison (1995) recognized,
In 1820-70, these mercantilist barriers were largely eliminated.
The UK removed all tariff barriers and trade restrictions between
1846 and 1860. Free trade policy was enforced in British
colonies, and in quasi-colonies such as China, Thailand and
Turkey. In Germany, the customs union (Zollverein) of 1834
ended barriers between the German states and the external
Zollverein tariff was lowered after 1850. In 1860 the Cobden-
Chevalier Treaty removed French quantitative restrictions and
reduced tariff barriers to a modest level. This was followed by
French commercial treaties with Belgium, the Zollverein, Italy,
Switzerland, Spain and other countries. These treaties had
Reis Mourao 3
most-favoured-nation clauses which meant that bilateral
liberalisation applied equally to all countries. (Chapter 3, p. 3)
Although recognized mostly for his later political influ-
ence in the Second Empire and as one of Napoleon III's clos-
est advisors,6 Chevalier's academic role as a professor at
Collège de France was not limited to his influential books.7
For instance, Chevalier, along with Villermé and Hyppolite
Passy, was also one of the founders of the Societé Statistique
de Paris (Statistical Society of Paris; Martin, 2001).
By this time, his influence was already being recognized
not only by economists but also in the political world. For
instance, Chevalier's bibliography led to fevered debates and
significant replicas, such as Gottfried Duden's critique of
Chevalier's (1837) Letters on North America, as noted by
Rowan (2009), or Carl Grun's critique of Chevalier's Saint-
Simonism, which Marx and Engels (1845) severely reproved.
Other remarkable influences were assumed by Carl Menger.
According to Campagnolo (2009), Menger cited Chevalier
56 times in his leading Grundsätze.
Chevalier's Cours d'Économie Politique
and His Discussions of Tariffs
Returning to the original edition (published by Capelle,
Libraire-Editeur, in Paris8), we confirm that the book was
written for both the academic year of 1841 to 1842 and the
first year of graduation. As usual, the lectures had been col-
lected by an assistant to Chevalier (M. A. Broët) and autho-
rized by the professor. The first two sections of this manual
are composed from two opening discourses by Chevalier
(pp. 1-53). The following 15 sections are composed of 15
lectures:
1st: On the relationship between individual freedom and
industrial production (pp. 57-79)
2nd: On the relationship between distribution and economic
development (pp. 80-101)
3rd: On economic growth and the role of agriculture (pp.
102-124)
4th: On capital (pp. 125-144)
5th: On the role of capital in improving the well-being of
workers (pp. 145-162)
6th: On the role of taxes in capital (pp. 163-189)
7th: On banks (pp. 190-206)
8th: On money (pp. 207-225)
9th: On mine extraction (pp. 226-245)
10th: On transports (pp. 246-271)
11th: On comparing land ways, water ways and railroads (pp.
272-300)
12th: On canal tariffs (pp. 301-327)
13th: On railroad tariffs (pp. 328-356)
14th: Conclusion of the 13th lecture (pp. 357-386)
15th: General conclusion (pp. 387-410).
All of these lectures were written according to a histori-
cist perspective typical among Saint-Simonian disciples (see
Khalil, 1995; Wolfson, 1994). The author begins by pointing
out the conclusions of his arguments. He then exposes these
arguments while referencing a few statistical data points and
many historical cases. Finally, he synthesizes the observa-
tions, highlighting the previously introduced conclusion.
As previously noted, there are a significant number of
authors who have discussed Chevalier's Saint-Simonism and
bibliography as a whole. However, Chevalier's Cours
d'Économie Politique is substantially important for under-
standing the evolution of many of Saint-Simonians to liber-
tarian positions and for its reflection of the general European
conviction that the best way for countries to grow economi-
cally was a rapid and substantial investment in transportation
through tariff reductions.
The question of tariff reduction was one of the most
important questions debated in Europe and America in the
first half of the 19th century. At the time, there were intense
debates in France among transportation specialists.9 The foci
of these debates were not only inland waterways (including
canals) but also the emerging railroads. Authors like
Chevalier himself or Jules Dupuit (Groenewegen, 1983;
Klein, 1985; Simonin & Vatin, 2002) not only considered the
importance of tariffs for economic growth but also were con-
cerned with their redistributive function via the pricing sys-
tem. It is also important to mention the debates among the
economist-engineers from the Ponts et Chaussées, which
bolstered contemporary economic thinking regarding pricing
in transportation.
When we read Chevalier's Cours carefully, it is easy to
see that it is not a general economics book in the way we
conceptualize it today, as a general introductory book for a
first-year undergraduate economics course. Chevalier's
Cours is concerned primarily with free trade and arguing
against tariffs.10 The concluding claim is clear: France
imposed excessive tariffs on the majority of goods and ser-
vices, which diminished its rhythm of growth and, obviously,
diminished the success of its distribution efforts.
As noted by Takashi (1980), Chevalier had tried to put
these ideas into practice some years before. Seeking to
reduce tariffs,11 he proposed an enormous development plan
4 SAGE Open
for French ways of communication in 1838 to improve the
linkage among usable rivers and railroads. This plan would
have cost 1.184 million francs over 12 years. The plan that
was actually approved by the ministry had a final cost of 2.8
million francs.
Chevalier observed that although France and England had
the same area and almost the same population, they had very
different systems and efficiencies regarding water canals. As a
result, Chevalier stated, "les canaux français ne rendent pas la
dixième partie des services qu'on est en droit d'en rendre"12
(Chevalier, p. 303). Chevalier knew that tolls covered infra-
structure costs.13 This point is noteworthy, as the 19th-century
transportation specialists argued (particularly Jules Dupuit,
according to Simonin & Vatin, 2002). Chevalier wanted to dis-
cuss the fact that in some instances, toll levels were exceeding
infrastructures costs, which consequently limited the exten-
sion of the market and eventually economic growth.
Chevalier used data on American canals from 1835 to
1839 and on French canals from 1821 to 1836. These data
were collected directly from official sources. After 1842,
Chevalier considered a more rigorous examination of these
data because in the second edition of Chevalier (1842), that
is, in 1855, he introduced notes about data beyond 1841,
reprinting the original table and adding a note on the stability
of canal tariff during the studied period.
When comparing French withAmerican canals, Chevalier
is even more emphatic:
Les canaux américains sont ceux qui ont donné les résultats les
plux extraordinaires.14 (p. 303)
Chevalier did not particularly focus on English, Belgian,
and Dutch tariffs (which he considered low), but he did
applaud American tariffs:
Il est evident que par cela même que les canaux américains ont
en général une grande longueur, on a dû établir des tarifs
modérés; autrement les marchandises parcourant de longs
trajets, elles auraient acquitté des droits qui en auraient trop
aggravé le prix.15 (p. 310)
Focusing specifically on the Erie Canal as representative
of other American canals,16 Chevalier noted,
Ses profits sont tels qu'il y a long-temps que le canal s'est payé
lui-même . . . entrepris en 1817 et achevé en 1825, il a déjà
donné assez de benefices.17 (pp. 312-313)
With the exception of the Canal du Midi, Chevalier is not
so gentle with French canals. Although recognizing that
France was the first country to build canals, he concluded the
12th lecture by stating that French tariffs should be lower and
French canals should be improved significantly:
Sans préjudice de l'abaissement des tarifs, si nous voulons tirer
parti de nos canaux, il faut que nous sachions les porter à un
parfait état d'achèvement, et qu'ensuite nous les maintenions
dans un excellent état d'entretien.18 (p. 327)
Using a t test on the equality of the means between French
and American tariffs collected by Chevalier at four French
canals and at four American canals (Figure 1), we get the fol-
lowing probability that the null hypothesis is observed
(French tariffs are the same than American ones): manure,
30.2%; coal, 36%; flour, 57.8%; wheat, 68%; wine/salt pork,
85.3%; iron, 73.3%; and textiles, 60.7%. Therefore, we can
conclude now that French tariffs could not be so significantly
higher than American ones as Chevalier was claiming.
It thus becomes pertinent to ask the following: Was
Chevalier exaggerating due to his fascination with the British
and American systems? Were his politics dominating his
technical and academic abilities? Was he forgetting to con-
sider the different economic and social conditions of France
and America? Or, was he interested in increasing the rhythm

of change by denouncing a larger gap than was actually pres-
ent between French and British or American tariffs?
Toward a Discussion on Chevalier's
Claims Using DEA Analysis
This section will use DEA to test Chevalier's argument that
French tariffs were exorbitantly high for his contemporaries
and fellow citizens. DEA is a nonparametric programming
approach to technical frontier estimation (Coelli, 1996). It
allows us to compute efficiency measures considering given
outputs and a set of inputs. Although the number of academic
works focusing on historical data using DEA is currently not
as large as the number of works that use DEA to analyze
more recent data, this approach has received increased atten-
tion even from those who are interested in researching data
from the past (Enflo & Baten, 2007; Mourao, 2009;
Nenovsky, Ivanov, & Mihaylova, 2008; Tankersley & Cuzan,
2004; Wheelock & Wilson, 1995).
With Chevalier's data and with his claims on inputs, we
use an input-oriented model and a cost-minimization model
characterized by variable returns to scale. We follow
McGillivray, McLean, Pahre, and Schonhardt-Bailey (2001),
and we also consider each toll as the result of the inputs of
the transportation process.
Our model (a cost-minimization model) is described by
the following minimization problem (Coelli, 1996):

In our case (please refer the raw data in the appendix), w

is a 6 × 1 matrix of tolls19 for the ith canal and xi
* (which is
calculated by the linear programming of DEA) is the cost-
minimization vector of economic and geographical character-
istics for the same ith canal. y
i
, xi

are also 6 × 1 matrixes.
N1 is an 8 × 1 vector of ones (convexity constraint) as in
Coelli (1996), with N being the number of firms (or, in our
case, the number 8 of canals).  is a 8 × 1 vector of constants.
X is the 6 × 8 inputs matrix. Y is a 6 × 8 matrix of normalized
outputs. Therefore, our minimization problem can be
described as a problem in which we want to achieve the maxi-
mum output with the minimum value of inputs' expenses or
inputs'costs (Coelli, 1996). For instance, for the same output,
a canal with a toll of five monetary units paid for 5 miles
exhibits a more efficient ratio (in the perspective of the toll
payer) than another canal with a toll of five monetary units
only paid for only 2 miles, keeping the other inputs (geo-
graphical and economic characteristics) constant.
The total cost efficiency (CE) or economic efficiency of
the ith canal would be calculated as CE =  
wi xi wi xi
* ,
meaning that CE is the ratio of minimum cost to observed
cost.
Chevalier recognized that the tolls and the costs of each
canal changed both because of the nature of each transported
product and six other geographical and economic dimen-
sions (our inputs): the distance of each canal; the minimum,
maximum and differential of altitude; the market area; and
the population density. Therefore, we have to identify these
factors as inputs of our model.20
Our first source for these variables is Chevalier's table
that is reproduced in Figure 1. We must remember, however,
that Chevalier's data exhibit some weaknesses: Besides
being the product of individual collection from official
reports, these data have not been conveniently discussed in
terms of efficiency. Thus, DEA is an appropriate method for
analyzing Chevalier's claims on tariffs for various reasons.
First, it has been proven to be an appropriate method for ana-
lyzing efficiency related to decision-making units. Second,
Chevalier's complaints concerned the modest efficiency of
French tariffs. Third, they allow the assumption of variable
(as opposed to constant) returns to scale to characterize the
output.
For the topological characteristics, we also returned to
Pierre (1997) for French canals and Shank (1986) and
Bernstein (2005) for American canals. For the population
dimensions of the regions around the canals, we used 19th-
century data from the National Historical Geographic
Information System (NHGIS; for North American areas) and
from the Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes
Economiques (for French areas).
The descriptive statistics are at Table 1.
Our raw data are shown in the appendix.
It is clear that our model should assume variable returns
to scale because constant returns to scale is adequate only
when we are observing decision-making units operating at
an optimal scale (Banker, Charnes, & Cooper, 1984). When
decision-making units face imperfect competition, con-
straints on finance, or different geographical areas, then it is
argued that a variable return to scale model is the most
appropriate. Our model is an input-oriented model because
this orientation is associated with the cost-minimization
model and because, as Coelli and Perelman (1996) assumed,
this orientation is preferred when input dimensions are the
primary decision variables.
We will pass over formal explanations of DEA and effi-
ciency concepts. For those interested in these themes, we
suggest Coelli (1996). To give an interpretation of the total
CE values that we are going to report, we state that our effi-
ciency measure identifies the ratio of minimum cost to the
observed cost for each transported product:
CE of each canal
Minimum cost observed for all canals
Cost observed f
=
o
or each canal
.
6 SAGE Open
In our model, less efficient decision-making units (canals)
face costs that are too high considering the set of inputs; the
most efficient decision-making units require lower costs to
produce the same unit of output produced by the less efficient
units. We ran our estimations using WIN4DEAP v.1.1.2.
Our results on the efficiency of each canal detailed by
Chevalier are reported in Table 2 and graphically represented
in Figure 2.
To help the reader, we offer an interpretation of the values
in Table 2 and Figure 2. Focusing on a given product--
manure--we observe that the canals that exhibited the mini-
mum cost (Efficiency estimate = 1) were Midi, Briare, and
Schuylkill. In contrast, the Pennsylvania Canal can be con-
firmed as the canal characterized by the maximum cost
(Efficiency estimate = 0). The Centre Canal can be high-
lighted as a canal showing median costs (Efficiency estimate
= 0.4) for manure and considering the set of inputs.
Our estimates indicate that Chevalier (1842) was not far
off. In fact, our estimates provide a mixed lecture on the effi-
ciency of tariffs. Two American canals, Schuylkill and
Delaware, were identified as having the most efficient tariffs.
The two other American canals analyzed by Chevalier
(1842), however, exhibit less efficient estimates--namely,
his highly favored Erie Canal and the Pennsylvania Canal.
However, the Briare Canal also shows highly significant effi-
cient tariffs, whereas Saint-Quentin Canal exhibits slightly
lower values. The Centre Canal and Midi Canal are identi-
fied as the French canals with the least efficient tariffs.
Our values show that, considering the evolving reality,
only the Centre and Midi canals were as costly as Chevalier
argued. However, examining within theAmerican reality and
considering the set of inputs analyzed in our model, the Erie
and Pennsylvania tariffs were too high for the users, even if
their values were lower than French values.
The advantages of DEA method are known: We do not
need to know a priori the form of production frontier.
Nonparametric methods allow the DEAtest to ignore the spec-
ification of a particular functional form for the technology.
Moreover, the use of small samples is possible (in our article,
eight canals considered as eight Decision Making Units
[DMU]): From this perspective, the methodology required for
using Coelli's (1996) model is correct. We also know, how-
ever, that this model is very sensitive to misspecified data and
errors due to the deterministic feature of the method: Each dis-
crepancy from the frontier is immediately interpreted as inef-
ficiency and statistical noise and inefficiency are not
distinguished. To account for these limitations, we also tested
different compositions of the set of inputs using the 63 differ-
ent combinations of the six inputs,21 and our results retained
the previously signaled pattern: Schuylkill and Delaware were
the most efficientAmerican canals, and Saint-Quentin was the
most efficient French canal. After running the 63 combina-
tions and using SimLab (data sensitivity software), we
obtained a central value for each estimate of efficiency and a
corresponding standard deviation. Full details are available
under request. Table 2 also expresses these values.

Although we experienced data scarcity, we also tried to
include a proxy for the price of each product using the mean
value of the inverse of quantities produced in France and the
United States between 1850 and 1860 and those suggested
by Chevalier. Even with this innovation, our DEA results did
not change.
Our results show that even when using modern techniques
like DEA, we are unable to confirm the efficiency of all
American canals' tariffs over French canals' tariffs. In fact,
French canals exhibit efficiency values that are central val-
ues when compared with the extreme values assumed for
American canals.
This points to a political motivation behind Chevalier's
emphasis on American canals. His argument was based only
on estimates for gross tariffs, and his claims were mainly
aimed at accelerating the improvement of the French sys-
tem's methods of transportation. Highlighting the differences
in tariffs, Chevalier reinforced the need for France to deepen
the process of industrialization through improved canals,
railroads, and land ways.
Conclusion
This work revisited the main aspect of the liberal Saint-
Simonian Michel Chevalier's economic thought, namely,
his discussion of the role of tariffs in economic growth.
Chevalier was a Frenchman involved not only in the con-
troversies of Saint-Simonism but also in a global perspec-
tive of economic growth and redistribution processes. His
journeys around the world, especially to the Americas,
clarified his thoughts and oriented them toward proindustri-
alization preferences using convenient policies of transpor-
tation. His reflections led him to discuss tariffs as a main
theme in his bibliography.
His book Cours d'Économie Politique collected his main
economic thought as distilled by the classes he taught at the
Collège de France in the 1840s. In this work, Chevalier
claimed that France was losing its rhythm of economic
growth because French canal tariffs were too high compared
with British and American tariffs.
We proved in this article that Chevalier's claim was essen-
tially political. Using DEA techniques, we calculated esti-
mates of French tariffs that were not as inefficient as
Chevalier claimed. In fact, in our sample, some French tar-
iffs, such as the Briare Canal, exhibited the most efficient
results even when considering American tariffs. In this find-
ing, we can agree with authors like Nye (1991) and argue that
Chevalier was trying to denounce a larger gap than actually
existed to accelerate the changes he wished to see in French
transportation policy.

Notes
 1. The second generation of Saint-Simonians and their networks
and journals in the 1820s and 1830s wrote about public works:
Le producteur, Le globe (Flachat, 1831-1832), and especially
Clapeyron-Lamé-Flachat's (1832) book, Vues politiques
et pratiques sur les travaux publics de France. The Saint-
Simonian engineers were great participants in French discus-
sions on the first public works programs (Picon, 1992).
2. Drolet (2008) noticed that Michel Chevalier was editor-in-
chief of the Saint-Simonian newspaper, Le Globe.
3. This is the title that became famous after the English trans-
lation (by Thomas Bradford in 1839) of the third edition of
Chevalier's (1837) Lettres sur l'Amérique du Nord.
4. Benjamin Poucel was the founder of Merino sheepfolds in
Uruguay.
5. The Cobden­Chevalier treaty is an important part of the
history of international relations for two reasons. First, it is
a document that signals a change in the diplomatic view of
European relations, supporting trade as a factor of diplomatic
stability instead of war claims; second, it led to a substantial
reduction in tariffs between the United Kingdom and France in
an intense period of growth in industrialization (Lampe, 2010;
Lazer, 1999).
6. See Chevalier's role in the Treaty on Free Trade between
France and Great Britain, signed in 1860 and discussed by
Adamson (2005) or Accominotti and Flandreau (2005)
7. Campagnolo (2009) also mentioned other Chevalier books
besides the masterpiece Cours d'Économie Politique (1842-
1844), such as Letters on the Organization of Labor and Letters
on Patents. It should be mentioned that Chevalier's classes
were suspended from April 7, 1848, until November 14, 1848,
by the antiroyalist Minister M. Carnot (Jourdan, 1887).
 8. For an image of the front page of this first edition, see Figure
A1 in the appendix.
 9. On this point, see Etner (1984) and Diehl (1987).
10. The issue of the recourse to foreign models (especially the
American comparison) for analyzing French industrialization
was common among French economists (see, for instance, Le
Van Lemesle, 2001).
11. The canals that Chevalier analyzed were structured follow-
ing the Becquey Plan in 1820 to 1822 that considerably over-
hauled the French canal system.
12. English translation: "French canals do not provide a tenth
part of the amount of services that they would be expected to
provide."
13. However, Chevalier did not distinguish among building, main-
tenance, and operating costs.
14. "American canals are those giving more extraordinary results."
15. "It is evident thatAmerican canals have generally a long distance,
then only moderated tariffs should be established; otherwise busi-
nessmen traveling through these long tracks would leave their
rights for traveling because of high prices they had to pay."
16. "On voit que les péages des canaux de l'état de Pensylvanie
dépassent peu ceux du canal Erié" (Chevalier, p. 313).
Translation: "It is seen that the tolls of the other canals of
Pennsylvania are not much higher than the Erie Canal's tolls."
17. "Its profits are so high that the canal paid for itself a long time
ago . . . started in 1817 and finished in 1825, it has already
produced sufficient benefits."
18. "Regardless of a decrease in tariffs, if we want to extract prof-
its from our canals, it is necessary that we keep them in a per-
fect working state and that we keep them in an excellent state
of maintenance."
19. For simplicity, we assumed that there are only six tolls, given
the similarity between the tariffs on flour and the tariffs on
wheat.
20. There is no consensus as to whether American and French
canals could be discussed together, considering the differ-
ent institutional and regulatory contexts in France and the
United States at that time. However, we must test the effi-
ciency of French and American canals for three main reasons.
First, Chevalier (1842) did so before and we wish to test his
claims. Second, we are going to use common factors as Data
Envelopment Analysis (DEA) inputs, thus avoiding the stan-
dard problems in inference. Third, efficiency measures can
only be computed if we consider the same range of inputs for
the same units of output (Coelli, 1996).
