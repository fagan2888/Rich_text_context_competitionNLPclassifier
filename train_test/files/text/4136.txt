Introduction
Chronic kidney disease such as hydronephrosis is a
severe worldwide problem and causes an increase in
cardiovascular risk.1­5 The renal vasoactive system con-
trolling blood pressure and the renin-angiotensin system
(RAS) was postulated to be involved in the hypertension
implicated in hydronephrosis.6­8 Hydronephrotic hyper-
tension has often been explained to be caused by the
RAS activated in the kidney leading to high blood pres-
sure.9­11 In a previous study, we demonstrated that
hydronephrosis due to unilateral ureter obstruction
causes an increase in the synthesis of renin in the kid-
ney.12­14 Recently, evidence has shown that acute kidney
injury causes cardiac remodeling and increases the
expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2).15­17 This implicates reciprocal interactions
between the heart and kidney for cardiovascular regula-
tion, mediated by the RAS. Cardiovascular diseases are
commonly associated with an imbalance within the
RAS. However, to date, whether cardiovascular regula-
tion through the local RAS is altered in hydronephrosis
has yet to be investigated. Therefore, the present study
was to assess the regulation of levels of ACE, ACE2 and
Mas receptor in the heart in Balb/C mice, with a hydro-
nephrotic kidney induced by left ureteral ligation. This
study was designed to evaluate these parameters after
treatment with ACE inhibitor and angiotensin (Ang)
type I (AT1) blockade. Since the inhibition of vasocon-
strictor effects of Ang II with ACE inhibitors or AT1
blockade relates to beneficial renal and cardiac effects in
patients with kidney disease,18,19 we have also investi-
gated the effects of ACE inhibition and AT1 blockade on
blood pressure, plasma renin activity (PRA), Ang I and
Ang II in hydronephrosis.

Abstract
Introduction: Hydronephrosis is characterized by substantial loss of tubules and affects renin secretion in the kidney.
However, whether alterations of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), ACE2 and Mas receptor in the heart are
observed in hydronephrosis is unknown. Thus, we assessed these components in hydronephrotic mice treated with
AT1 receptor blockade and ACE inhibitor.
Materials and methods: Hydronephrosis was induced by left ureteral ligation in Balb/C mice except sham-operated
animals. The levels of cardiac ACE, ACE2 and Mas receptor were measured after treatment of losartan or enalapril.
Results: Hydronephrosis led to an increase of ACE level and a decrease of ACE2 and Mas receptor in the heart.
Losartan decreased cardiac ACE level, but ACE2 and Mas receptor levels significantly increased in hydronephrotic mice
(p < 0.01). Enalapril increased ACE2 levels (p < 0.01), but did not affect Mas receptor in the heart. Plasma renin activity
(PRA) and Ang II decreased in hydronephrotic mice, but significantly increased after treatment with losartan or enalapril.
Conclusions: Hydronephrosis increased cardiac ACE and suppressed ACE2 and Mas receptor levels. AT1 blockade
caused sustained activation of cardiac ACE2 and Mas receptor, but ACE inhibitor had the limitation of such activation of
Mas receptor in hydronephrotic animals.

Materials and methods
Animals and experimental protocol
Sixty male Balb/C mice, aged 10 weeks, were used in this
study. The experiments were conducted according to the
National Research Council's guidelines and were approved
by the Taishan Medical University Ethics Committee. All
mice weighing 25­30 g were subjected to left ureteral ligation
except the sham-operated group (n = 15). The surgical proce-
dure of the left ureteral ligation was performed as described
previously.12,13 Sham-operated mice underwent a similar
operation without the ureteral ligation. Mice were maintained
on a standard laboratory diet and had free access to tap water.
Four weeks after the operation the left kidney was hydrone-
phrotic.12­14 Following the ureteral ligated surgery, animals
were randomly allocated to a vehicle (n = 15) or losartan at a
dose of 30 mg kg-1 (Los, n = 15) or enalapril at 20 mg kg-1
(Ena, n = 15) by daily oral gavage for four weeks.
Blood pressure was measured by the tail-cuff method
using photoelectric volume oscillometry (ALC-NIBP
Analysis System, Aoer Biotech, Shanghai), as described
previously.13,14
At four weeks of treatment, animals were sacrificed by
intraperitoneal pentobarbital sodium overdose (100 mg
kg-1). At postmortem, a blood sample was taken from the
abdominal aorta. Plasma was separated from each blood
sample by microcentrifuge. Heart tissue was removed and
weighed. A whole heart was cut longitudinally and snap-
frozen in isopentane/dry ice for immunohistochemical
studies. A piece of each tissue was preserved at ­80ºC for
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
and Western blot analysis.
PRA, Ang I and Ang II assays
PRA, Ang I and Ang II were measured by a radioimmu-
noassay using a commercial kit (Puer Weiye Biotech,
Beijing) based on methods described previously.12­14
Measurement of ACE, ACE2 and Mas receptor
messenger RNA (mRNA)
Total RNA was extracted from the heart using TRIzol
(Invitrogen, NY, USA) according to the manufacturer's
protocol. RT-PCR was carried out using a PCR Reagent
Kit (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously.14
Housekeeping gene -actin was used as an internal stand-
ard. The results were normalized to -actin mRNA quanti-
tated from the same samples. The primers used in this
study are as follows: ACE forward 5'-TAACTCGAGT
GCCGAGGTG-3' and reverse 5'-CCAGCAGGTGGCA
GTCTT-3'; ACE2 forward 5'-CTTCAGCACTC TCAG
CAG ACA-3' and reverse 5'-CAACTTCCTCCTCACA

CATC-3' and reverse 5'-GGTGGAGAA AAGCAAGGA
GA-3'; -actin forward 5'-GTCGTACCACTGGCATTGT
G-3' and reverse 5'-TCTCAGCTGTGGTGGTGAAG-3'.
Densitometric analysis of PCR was performed using the
Digital Imaging System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
Western blot analysis
Protein from heart tissue was extracted and subjected to
Western blot analysis as reported previously.20 Thirty µg of
protein was loaded per lane, separated in 10% sodium dode-
cyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) mem-
branes. The membranes were probed using primary antibod-
ies against ACE, ACE2 and Mas receptor (all from Santa
Cruz Biotech Inc, Dallas, TX, USA), respectively, followed
by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for
two hours at room temperature. Chemoluminescence was
detected with an enhanced chemilumescent (ECL) kit (Pierce,
Boston, MA, USA) and subsequent exposure to Hyperfilm
(Amersham, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The amount of ACE,
ACE2 and Mas receptor was expressed relative to that of
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).
ACE2 immunohistochemistry
Sections of unfixed hearts were embedded in PolyFreeze
Tissue Freezing Medium (Polysciences, Warrington, PA,
USA) and snap-frozen in isopentane/dry ice as described
previously.11 Briefly, cryostat sections, 7 µm thick, were cut
and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes at 4°C.
The sections were incubated with the dilution of primary
antibody against ACE2 (Santa Cruz Biotech Inc, USA) at
dilution of 1:200 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solu-
tion. After washing with PBS, they were incubated with
peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Ig)G
(goat polyclonal, 1:5000) for one hour at 4°C. The color was
developed with 0.05% 3, 3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydro-
chloride (DAB) and 0.01% H2
O2
. Quantitative analyses of
ACE2 expression within the heart were performed using a
quantitative image analysis system (Metamorph, CA, USA).
Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Statistical sig-
nificance of ACE, ACE2, Mas receptor, PRA, Ang I, Ang
II and MAP data were determined with one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) in SPSS followed by least signifi-
cant difference (LSD) post hoc tests. Differences were
considered statistically significant at a value of p < 0.05.
Results
General data
After left ureteral ligation, mean arterial pressure (MAP)
did not differ among groups. At the end of four weeks of
Zhang et al. 269
experimental procedures, AT1 receptor blockade losartan
decreased MAP from 106 ± 5 mmHg to 93 ± 4 mmHg (p <
0.05, Table 1), andACE inhibitor enalapril decreased MAP
from 108 ± 5 mmHg to 95 ± 3 mmHg (p < 0.05) in ureteral
ligated mice, respectively.
At postmortem, any liquid in the left hydronephrotic
kidney was removed and both the right and left kidneys
were weighed. In the sham-operated mice, the right and
left kidney weight was 0.20 ± 0.03 g and 0.21 ± 0.04 g,
respectively. However, in mice after ureteral ligation the
left kidney weight was 0.11 ± 0.01 g and was much lighter
than the contralateral kidney (0.28 ± 0.04 g, p < 0.01),
indicating that the left kidney was hydronephrotic and the
right kidney was enlarged compensatorily. However, there
was no difference in body and heart weight between
groups (Table 1). Light microscopic observation con-
firmed that the tubules in the hydronephrotic kidney
(Figure 1(b)) disappeared, differing from those in the con-
trol kidney (Figure 1(a)).
PRA decreased from 15.7 ± 1.2 ng/ml/h to 10.4 ± 1.0
ng/ml/h (p < 0.05, Figure 2) after left ureteral ligation. In
mice with a hydronephrotic kidney, PRA rose to 34.2 ± 3.1
ng/ml/h (p < 0.01) after losartan treatment, and 36.5 ± 2.5
ng/ml/h (p < 0.01) after enalapril treatment, respectively.
Plasma Ang I and Ang II were 15 ± 4 pg/ml and 32 ±
3 pg/ml, respectively in sham-operated animals (Table 1).
Plasma Ang II level decreased in hydronephrotic mice
(p < 0.05). Administration of losartan was accompanied
by a rise in plasma Ang I and Ang II concentrations in
hydronephrotic animals (p < 0.05). Enalapril also
increased levels of Ang I (p < 0.01) and Ang II (p < 0.05)
in the circulation.

ACE mRNA and protein in the heart
In mice with a left hydronephrotic kidney, cardiac ACE
mRNA levels increased (p < 0.01, Figure 3(a) and (b)).
After treatment with losartan, cardiac ACE mRNA levels
decreased compared to the sham-operated animals (p <
0.01). Enalapril also significantly decreased cardiac ACE
mRNA levels (p < 0.01). Similarly, cardiac ACE protein
level was increased in mice with a hydronephrotic kidney
(p < 0.05, Figure 3 (c) and (d)). Both losartan and enalapril
significantly decreased ACE levels (p < 0.01), compared
with sham-operated animals.
ACE2 mRNA and protein in the heart
In mice with the left hydronephrosis, cardiac ACE2
mRNA decreased by 25% compared with controls (p <
0.05, Figure 4(a) and (b)). However, both losartan and
enalapril significantly increased cardiac ACE2 mRNA
levels (p < 0.01).
The level of cardiac ACE2 protein was decreased in
hydronephrotic mice (p < 0.05, Figure 4(c) and (d)).
Both losartan and enalapril significantly increased ACE2
protein levels compared with the sham-operated (p <
0.05) and with hydronephrotic mice alone (p < 0.01,
Figure 4(c) and (d)).
Immunohistochemistry forACE2 is shown in Figure 5(a­
e). In the sham-operated mice, ACE2 expression was seen in
cardiomyocytes (Figure 5(a)). Cardiac ACE2 immunostain-
ing level decreased in hydronephrotic mice (Figure 5(b), p <
0.05). Losartan significantly increased cardiac ACE2 level
compared with the sham-operated mice (Figure 5(c­e), p <
0.01) and hydronephrotic mice alone (p < 0.01).
Mas mRNA and protein in the heart
In mice with the left hydronephrosis, the level of cardiac
Mas mRNA was decreased (Figure 6(a) and (b)). Losartan
treatment significantly increased Mas mRNA levels (p <
0.01) in the heart. However, enalapril had no effect on Mas
mRNA expression in the hydronephrotic mice. There was
a significant difference in Mas mRNA levels between the
losartan- and enalapril-treated groups (p < 0.01).
Furthermore, losartan significantly increased the cardiac
Mas protein level (p < 0.01), but enalapril did not stimulate
the cardiac Mas receptor expression (Figure 6(c) and (d)).
These data suggest that the expression of cardiac Mas
receptor is enhanced by losartan, but not by enalapril in
this animal model.
Discussion
Previous studies evaluated the effects of converting
enzyme inhibitors and adrenoceptor blockade on renal
renin secretion and synthesis in mice with a hydrone-
phrotic kidney.12­14 This study was to determine whether

hydronephrosis, caused by the left ureteral ligation, is
associated with alterations in the activity of the RAS, such
as levels of ACE, ACE2 and Mas receptor in the heart.
This study reports for the first time that hydronephrosis
can lead to an increase in the levels of cardiac ACE mRNA
and its protein and a reduction in the levels of cardiac
ACE2 and Mas receptor. The left hydronephrosis was
accompanied by decreased PRA, indicating that renin
release was less into the circulation due to the damage of
the macula densa in the kidney.12­14,21 Furthermore, MAP
did not significantly change in mice, suggesting that
hydronephrosis in one kidney did not cause a rise in blood
pressure. These results were consistent with previous
reports12­14 demonstrating that the signal leading to hyper-
tension in this model is transmitted through the barorecep-
tors rather than through the macula densa.2,21,22
The present study showed that both AT1 receptor block-
ade and ACE inhibitor decreased the levels of cardiac ACE
mRNA and its protein in hydronephrotic mice. Meanwhile,
the two reagents increased PRA and decreased MAP. These
results demonstrated that losartan and enalapril had the
effects on renin activity in the circulation and also on the
RAS in the heart. Thus, we further examined whether the
two reagents affect the expression of cardiac ACE2 and
Mas receptor in hydronephrosis. Administration of losartan
and enalapril decreased MAP and increased the levels of
cardiac ACE2 in mice with a hydronephrotic kidney.
However, only losartan was observed to increase the level
of cardiac Mas receptor. In contrast, there was no signifi-
cant effect of enalapril on the expression of the Mas recep-
tor in these animals, suggesting that losartan and enalapril
may have different mechanisms affecting the cardiac Mas
receptor in hydronephrotic mice. At the present time, we do
not know the exact cause of the different effects induced by
losartan and enalapril on the Mas receptor; however, both
reagents decreased MAP with a similar pattern, indicating
that blood pressure may not be a critical factor leading to
the different impacts on cardiac Mas receptor. Furthermore,
similar to previous reports in rats and mice,2,12­14,21 blood
pressure was not altered in mice with a hydronephrotic kid-
ney. The normotensive status in this model suggests a pres-
sure-independent mechanism for the alteration of Mas
receptor level in hydronephrotic animals.
In previous studies, we reported that plasma renin con-
centration (PRC) was reduced from the hydronephrotic
kidney.13,14 The present study showed that PRA and Ang II
were lower in hydronephrotic mice, implying a decrease
in renin activity in animals due to the damage of the
macula densa, one of the critical factors controlling
renin secretion.23­25 Furthermore, a level of cardiac ACE

expression was elevated in hydronephrotic mice. In the
present study, the changes in plasma renin are highly
likely to have been associated with decreased Ang II lev-
els, especially because of the reduction of renin release
from the hydronephrotic kidney. The low levels of Ang II
could stimulate the expression or activity of ACE in the
heart, through a pathway of a negative regulation of Ang
II on renin or ACE.26­28
In the present study, plasma Ang I and Ang II levels
were elevated after administration of losartan or enalapril.
Furthermore, the increase of Ang I and Ang II was accom-
panied by a rise of cardiac ACE2 expression in hydrone-
phrotic animals, indicating that both Ang I and Ang II
could stimulate the ACE2 levels in the heart. It is possible
that ACE2 forms Ang (1­7) directly from Ang II, or
through hydrolysis of Ang I to Ang (1­9) with subsequent
formation of Ang (1­7).29,30
Although ACE inhibitor has similar effects of AT1
receptor blockade on cardiac ACE2 expression, only losar-
tan increases the Mas receptor levels in the heart, suggest-
ing that one of the main favorable effects of AT1 receptor
blockade is to enhance the activity of ACE2-Ang (1­7)-
Mas axis of the RAS, a protective pathway in the heart.
Further work should focus on the mechanisms of altera-
tions of cardiac RAS components observed in this study,
using AT1 receptor blockers, Mas receptor antagonist and

infusion of Ang (1­7). Ang (1­7) signaling and its interac-
tion with AT1 receptor and Mas receptor signaling need to
be further investigated.
These data suggest that hydronephrosis induced by the
ureteral ligation causes the alteration of ACE and ACE2
expression in the heart. These results also suggest that acti-
vation of cardiac ACE2 by both enalapril and losartan may
protect against the adverse effects of activated RAS and
renal impairment. Thus, we propose that the change of car-
diacACE2 and Mas receptor expression induced by hydro-
nephrosis can be an important target of strategies for
preventing cardiovascular damage.
In summary, many clinical studies have discussed the
renal diseases impairing cardiovascular functions. In this
study, we found that hydronephrosis caused the alteration of
cardiac ACE, ACE2 and Mas receptor levels. Furthermore,
losartan evoked the activation both ofACE2 and Mas recep-
tor in the heart, but enalapril had a limited effect on the Mas
receptor. These findings may lead to an exciting new area in
the clinical administration of AT1 receptor blockade. The
observations of the different molecular mechanisms of
losartan and enalapril could be helpful for better options in
the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
