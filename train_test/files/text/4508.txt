The 2014 Governors' Races and Health Care:
A Campaign Web Site Analysis

Abstract
The November 2014 midterm election was the first election since key coverage provisions of the Affordable Care Act
(ACA) were implemented, including the Medicaid expansion and creation of the health insurance exchanges. The pre-
election variability in the states' implementation of these provisions coupled with the large number of states selecting their
next governor made the election important at the state level. To better understand the role of health care in the recent
gubernatorial elections, we analyzed health policy content presented by 71 candidates for governor on their campaign Web
sites. Nearly 80% of all candidates discussed health policy on their Web site, including the subset of the 36 winning governors.
The predominant focus of health policy content was on the ACA as a whole or its provisions. Medicaid was discussed more
often by candidates in non-expansion states than those from expansion states. Based on the statements of winning governors,
we expect serious consideration of the Medicaid expansion to occur in at least 4 states, whereas 2 states may make efforts
to reverse course. Relatively few winning governors (33%) mentioned the exchanges. Only 1 expressed interest in switching
from the federal exchange to a state exchange, which has particular relevance given the Supreme Court's pending decision on
King v. Burwell that could invalidate tax credits on the federal exchange. The prominence of health care in the gubernatorial
campaigns strengthens the likelihood that governors will play an influential role in the health system's future, especially as the
ACA undergoes further federal debate.

Introduction
The Republican Party's strong performance in the
November election--the first since the main coverage pro-
visions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) took effect--
solidified a political landscape that favors continued debate
on the health reform law.1,2 The pre-election variability in
states' decisions to implement key ACA coverage provi-
sions--primarily Medicaid expansion and health insurance
exchanges3-5--coupled with the sheer number of states that
cast ballots for governor in November 2014 (36 vs only 11
in 2012), made the election particularly important for the
ACA's future. We sought to answer the following research
questions:
Research Question 1: What positions did gubernatorial
candidates take on the ACA?
Research Question 2: Did they support or oppose
expanding Medicaid?
Research Question 3: Did they support a state or a fed-
eral exchange in their state?
Methods
In October 2014, we reviewed the health policy content on
the campaign websites of all candidates running for the 36
governorships (only 1 of the 72 candidates did not have a Web
site). From all major party candidates' official campaign Web
sites, we systematically entered health policy content into a
REDCap data extraction tool.6 If candidates explicitly pre-
sented the ACA on their Web sites, we categorized their
stance as either in favor or opposed to the ACA, recorded the
reasons offered for any opposition, and if they used the term
Obamacare. We then categorized all candidates' views as

either opposed to or supportive of Medicaid expansion in
their state, and similarly classified whether they planned to
change their state's current exchange design (eg, from state to
federal). Our primary analysis categorized our findings for
the 36 winning candidates, stratified by political party; sec-
ondary analyses also considered losing candidates. We used
chi-square, and Fisher exact tests when appropriate, to com-
pare outcomes by political party.
Limitations
Our focus on governors is strategic given their unique, visi-
ble role in shaping their state's policy agenda.3,7,8 They can,
however, be constrained by other state actors.7,9,10
Nonetheless, their campaign statements may be indicative of
their willingness to facilitate (or oppose) changes to health
reform in their state.11 In addition, campaign Web sites are a
growing source of political data for capturing candidates'
issue positions. Although they are imperfect, studies have
shown that they are reliable source for capturing a candi-
date's policy views and comparable with other campaign
communication that disproportionately favors well-funded
candidates.12-16
Results
Nearly 80% of gubernatorial candidates (56 of 71) discussed
health care on their campaign Web sites, with the predomi-
nant focus being the ACA or its coverage provisions.
Republicans who mentioned the law overwhelmingly (90%)
referred to it as "Obamacare," whereas not a single winning
Democrat used this term (though 4 losing Democrats did so).
Among the winning governors, only 3 of 12 Democrats/
Independent expressed favorable views on the ACA per se
whereas the majority of the 24 Republican governors (62%)
indicated opposition to the law (see Table 1). The top reasons
for ACA opposition that these 24 Republicans offered were
that it was "a failure" (53%), represented federal overreach
into states (47%), raised premiums (47%), or caused plan
cancellations (40%).
Medicaid Expansion
Medicaid expansion was explicitly mentioned more by
Democrats (49%) than Republicans (28%), especially those
Democrats who lost in the 15 non-expansion states with elec-
tions. Among the 21 expansion states with elections, only 6
winning candidates (4 Democrats, 2 Republicans) discussed
this policy (29%). Both Arizona and Arkansas elected new
Republican governors who expressed willingness to shift
away from traditional expansion under the ACA. In contrast,
Pennsylvania's new governor criticized his Republican pre-
decessor's plan to expand private coverage and instead
favored a traditional expansion. Among non-expansion states
with governors' races, Republican candidates won 14 of the
15 elections. Half of the winning governors in these states
mentioned Medicaid expansion on their Web sites, mostly
reiterating opposition to expansion. But the governors of
Wyoming and Tennessee supported customized expansion
options as did Alaska's newly elected Independent governor.
Exchanges
Less than one third of all candidates--regardless of political
party--mentioned health insurance exchanges on their Web
sites. Among the winning candidates who discussed
exchanges, 33% generally supported the current arrange-
ment in their state, though 2 operating state-based exchanges
expressed concerns with its rollout. Only 1 of the 17 gover-
nors in states using the federal exchange (Pennsylvania)
expressed support for switching to a state-based exchange.
Discussion
Although some suggested that the ACA would fade as an
issue once the law was implemented,17 we find evidence that
the health reform law--and health policy more broadly--
was an important issue discussed on most candidates' cam-
paign Web sites. However, opponents of the law were much
more vocal than supporters of the law. Republican governors
were more likely to mention their opposition to the ACA
("Obamacare") whereas Democrats distanced themselves
from the law and generally did not mention it explicitly.
We also observed different strategic choices from the 2
parties regarding the Medicaid expansion, in part depending
on each state's expansion status.18 Few winning governors
from expansion states discussed this policy. For Republican
candidates, this likely reflects not only a balancing
act between the ACA's general unpopularity with their
constituents2,19 but also potential political consequences of
taking away a tangible benefit that has already been given
and is popular among those who have received it.18,20 Facing
these 2 alternatives, it was easiest for many Republicans sim-
ply not to discuss Medicaid at all. Republican candidates
from Arizona and Arkansas, however, challenged this notion
as they stated their intentions to potentially reverse course on
the Medicaid expansion. Meanwhile, Democrats in expand-
ing states avoided discussing the expansion, likely due to the
ongoing divided public opinion about the law.19
In non-expansion states, candidates from both parties dis-
cussed Medicaid more frequently. Republicans won over
90% of these elections and generally continued to oppose
expansion, overcoming Democratic candidates' efforts to
make the expansion a prominent campaign issue.3,21
However, winning Republican candidates in 2 states
(Tennessee and Wyoming) expressed plans to explore
Medicaid expansion options even while expressing strong
opposition to the ACA, likely in an attempt to balance their
states' politically hostile environment toward the ACA with
Medicaid budgetary pressures.22,23

Finally, we found little evidence that the exchanges were
a prominent election topic. However, days following the
election, the Supreme Court announced its decision to hear
the King v. Burwell case, which brings uncertainty to the

legality of tax credits for those in federal exchanges.24 Had
this announcement come during the election cycle, it is
unclear how candidates from the 17 states with a federal
exchange would have engaged with this issue.
These findings suggest that theACAremains a key guberna-
torial election issue, though more so forACAopponents than its
supporters. The campaign positions expressed by the 36 win-
ning governors indicate that many of them--especially
Republicans--are willing to spend political capital to shape the
ACA's future in their state. Although several may expand
Medicaid, others may reverse course. Finally, the stakes for
state-based decision making regarding the ACA will only
increase if the Supreme Court rules against the administration in
King v. Burwell. Overall, our results suggest that the ACA
remains a hot-button issue for policymakers and worth studying
as an election issue in forthcoming campaigns--both among
state and federal leaders, legislators, and executives alike.
