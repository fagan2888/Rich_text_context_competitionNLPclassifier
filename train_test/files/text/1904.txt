Background--Although renal insufficiency is a recognized risk factor for coronary artery disease, little is known about the
epidemiology of lower-extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in persons with renal insufficiency.
Methods and Results--We examined the cross-sectional association of PAD, defined as an ankle-brachial index (ABI)
0.9, and renal insufficiency, defined as an estimated creatinine clearance (CRCL) 60 mL · min1 · 1.73 m2, among
2229 eligible participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999 to 2000. An
estimated 1.20.3 million persons 40 years old with CRCL 60 mL · min1 · 1.73 m2 (24%) have PAD defined as
an ABI 0.9 (versus 3.7% of persons with CRCL 60 mL · min1 · 1.73 m2). The association of ABI 0.9 with renal
insufficiency was independent of potential confounders such as age, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease,
stroke history, and hypercholesterolemia (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2 to 5.1, P0.011, referent category ABI 1.0 to 1.3).
Conclusions--Clinicians should be aware of the remarkably high prevalence of PAD among patients with renal
insufficiency. In the clinical setting, accurate identification of patients with renal insufficiency combined with routine
ABI measurement in this group would greatly enhance efforts to detect subclinical PAD. (Circulation. 2004;109:320-
323.)

It is increasingly accepted that mild to moderate chronic
renal insufficiency is a risk factor for cardiovascular
disease.1­5 However, most studies of cardiovascular disease
in patients with chronic renal insufficiency have not exam-
ined lower-extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and
disease prevalence has only been described in a few select
groups of patients with renal insufficiency.6­8 Because PAD
is highly prevalent among dialysis patients,9 as evidenced by
the exceedingly high amputation rates in this group,10 we
hypothesize that there is also a high prevalence of PAD
among the much larger number of persons with chronic renal
insufficiency. We used ankle-brachial index (ABI) measure-
ments from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) 1999 to 2000 to test this hypothesis.
Methods
Data Sources
Since the early 1960s, the National Center for Health Statistics
has conducted a series of cross-sectional national surveys of the
noninstitutionalized civilian population. In each survey, the
population was sampled with a complex, stratified, multistage
probability cluster sampling design to provide data that are
representative of the overall United States population. Beginning
in 1999, NHANES became a continuous survey, and NHANES
1999 to 2000 refers to the first 2 years of data for the now ongoing
NHANES. As for the prior NHANES, NHANES 1999 to 2000
involved collection of interview, examination, and laboratory
data. However, unlike prior surveys, the present survey included
a detailed lower-extremity examination that involved ABI mea-
surement, a noninvasive measure of lower-extremity atheroscle-
rosis. It is thus possible to use NHANES 1999 to 2000 data to
estimate the prevalence and correlates of PAD as indicated by a
low ABI. More detailed information on survey design and
procedures is available at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/
nhanes/NHANESIII_Reference_ Manuals.htm.
ABI Measurements
Briefly, study participants 40 years old were invited to undergo
lower-extremity examination. Persons with bilateral amputations
or weighing more than 400 pounds were excluded. Supine systolic
pressure was measured in 1 arm (brachial artery) and both ankles
(posterior tibial arteries). The ABI was calculated by dividing the
mean systolic blood pressure in the arm by the mean systolic
blood pressure in the respective ankle. For the purposes of this
analysis, the lowest ABI obtained for either leg was taken as the
ABI measurement for that patient. Details of the ABI measure-
ment procedure in NHANES 1999 to 2000 are available at
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/frequency/lexabdoc.pdf.

Estimation of Creatinine Clearance
We used the Cockroft-Gault formula standardized to body surface
area11 to estimate creatinine clearance (CRCL).12 For the purposes of
this analysis, subjects were considered to have renal insufficiency if
their estimated CRCL was 60 mL · min1 · 1.73 m2. All analyses
compare this group with the reference group of persons with
estimated CRCL 60 mL · min1 · 1.73 m2.
Covariates
Self-reported race was defined as non-Hispanic black versus all
other. Determination of comorbid conditions (diabetes, insulin use,
diabetic retinopathy, hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke
history, and smoking history) was based on patient interview
responses. In addition, body mass index (BMI), the average of 4
measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, glycosylated
hemoglobin, and total cholesterol measurements were included in
multivariable analysis.
Statistical Analysis
Sampling weights are provided with NHANES 1999 to 2000 data.
These take into account the unequal probabilities of selection that
result from the sample design, from nonresponse, and from planned
oversampling of certain subgroups. Standard errors were calculated
by the recommended jackknife method (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/
data/nhanes/guidelines1.pdf) with SAS-callable SUDAAN version 8
software (Research Triangle Park). Differences in continuous vari-
ables between renal function categories were compared with a t test,
and differences in categorical variables were measured with a 2 test.
We developed a categorical variable for ABI that adhered to
conventional ABI cutoff points (ie, ABI 0.9, 0.9 to 0.99, 1.0 to 1.3,
and 1.3). PAD is defined as an ABI 0.9, and values between 1.0
and 1.3 are considered normal.13 An ABI of 1.0 to 1.3 served as the
referent category for all logistic regression analyses. We measured
the association of the categorical ABI variable with renal insuffi-
ciency using univariate logistic regression analysis for which the
outcome was estimated CRCL 60 versus 60 mL · min1 · 1.73
m2. We then developed multivariate logistic regression models to
adjust sequentially for confounders including demographic (age,
gender, and race) and clinical characteristics (diabetes, insulin use,
retinopathy, coronary artery disease, stroke history, cholesterol,
glycosylated hemoglobin, smoking history, BMI, hypertension his-
tory, and blood pressure measurements).
Results
ABI was recorded for at least 1 leg in 2381 (83%) of the 2875
lower-extremity examination participants. Serum creatinine
was measured in 2233 of these participants. Four participants
were excluded because they were missing weight data, and
we were therefore unable to estimate CRCL. The study
sample thus consisted of 2229 persons with ABI and CRCL
data. Among these, 211 had an estimated CRCL 60 mL ·
min1 · 1.73 m2 (a projected 5.80.7% of the noninstitu-
tionalized civilian population more than 40 years old, or
5.00.6 million persons). Table 1 describes the characteris-
tics of the study sample extrapolated to the US population. A
substantially higher percentage of persons with renal insuffi-
ciency were in the low ABI categories (0.9 and 0.9 to 0.99)
compared with those with CRCL 60 mL · min1 · 1.73 m2.
However, those with renal insufficiency were on average
older; had a higher prevalence of diabetes, coronary artery
disease, stroke, and hypertension; had higher mean glycosy-

lated hemoglobin and systolic pressure; and had lower BMI
and diastolic blood pressure. There were no statistically
significant differences between persons with and without
renal insufficiency in either total cholesterol measurements or
smoking history. Among persons with renal insufficiency, the
prevalence of ABI 0.9 was high both among those with
(299%) and without (215%) self-reported coronary artery
disease. On the basis of this analysis, the population preva-
lence of PAD (as defined by an ABI 0.9) among persons
40 years old with an estimated CRCL 60 mL · min1 ·
1.73 m2 is estimated to be 1.20.3 million.
Table 2 shows the results of both univariate and multivar-
iate logistic regression analyses. Univariate logistic regres-
sion analysis shows that compared with their counterparts
with CRCL 60 mL · min1 · 1.73 m2, persons with renal
insufficiency were more than 9-fold more likely to have an
ABI 0.9 (versus an ABI of 1 to 1.3). We developed 2
multivariable models to adjust sequentially for demographic
characteristics and comorbid conditions that might confound
the association between renal insufficiency and ABI. After
adjustment for age, gender, and race, renal insufficiency
remained strongly associated with an ABI 0.9 (OR 3.0,
95% CI 1.7 to 5.3, P0.001). This association persisted after
further adjustment for comorbid conditions including diabe-
tes, coronary artery disease, and history of stroke; measures
of diabetes severity (glycosylated hemoglobin, self-reported
retinopathy, and insulin use); history of diagnosed hyperten-
sion; and measured blood pressure, total cholesterol, BMI,
and smoking history (ABI 0.9; OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2 to 5.1,
P0.011, referent category ABI 1.0 to 1.3).
Discussion
The present study demonstrates a remarkably high prevalence
of PAD (defined as an ABI 0.9) among a representative
sample of the US population 40 years old with renal
insufficiency. On the basis of these data, an estimated
1.20.3 million persons (24%) 40 years old with a CRCL
60 mL · min1 · 1.73 m2 have PAD. Even after adjustment
for important confounders such as age, diabetes, diabetes
severity, and coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease,
persons with renal insufficiency are still more than twice as
likely to have an ABI 0.9 as persons with a CRCL 60 mL
· min1 · 1.73 m2.
The high unadjusted association of renal insufficiency with
low ABI reflects, to a large extent, the older age of the renal
insufficiency group. A high prevalence in this group of other
established cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes and
hypertension, in addition to a high prevalence of existing
coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease, also contributes
to the high unadjusted association of renal insufficiency with
low ABI. Several traditional cardiovascular risk factors, such
as cholesterol and smoking, are no more prevalent among
persons with renal insufficiency than among those with
normal renal function and thus do not appear to explain the
cross-sectional association seen here between ABI and renal
insufficiency.
There are several possible explanations for the high ad-
justed association of renal insufficiency with low ABI. One
possibility is that renal insufficiency may be a marker for
more generalized atherosclerosis. In support of this, the
presence of baseline cardiovascular disease is independently
associated with progression to end-stage renal disease among
patients with chronic kidney disease.14 Alternatively, there
may be a causal association between renal insufficiency and
progression of lower-extremity atherosclerosis. Potential
pathophysiological mechanisms by which decreased CRCL
itself might predispose to PAD include altered calcium-
phosphorus, homocysteine, and lipoprotein(a) metabolism
and alterations in inflammatory and coagulation pathways.9
Accurate diagnosis of PAD is important. Low ABI is
associated with an increased risk of stroke, myocardial
infarction, and cardiovascular death, and PAD is known to
affect lower-extremity function and quality of life.15 Several
specific interventions, such as exercise training16 and statin
therapy,17 are effective in reducing the functional limitation
associated with PAD. Unfortunately, in part owing to the lack
of specific PAD symptomatology, clinician awareness of
PAD in the primary care setting is notoriously low,15,18 which
translates into missed opportunities to prescribe specific
therapy for PAD and to implement general cardiovascular
risk reduction measures for this high-risk group.18
Relative to methods for detecting other forms of cardio-
vascular disease (eg, cardiac stress testing), ABI measure-
ment is a simple, noninvasive procedure that can be per-
formed easily in the outpatient setting.15 Routine ABI
measurement could be used to identify patients with subclin-
ical PAD who might benefit from educational and therapeutic
interventions for PAD. Early identification of PAD before
progression to advanced ischemia may be particularly impor-
tant in patients with renal insufficiency, given data showing
that patients with renal insufficiency who undergo lower-
extremity bypass are more likely than those with normal renal
function to present with gangrene and ischemic ulceration at
the time of surgery and to experience postoperative death and
cardiovascular complications.19
In addition, because of the well-documented association of
low ABI with cardiovascular mortality, ABI measurement
could also help to target patients at highest risk for cardio-
vascular death as candidates for secondary prevention efforts.
The present results show that self-reported history of coro-
nary artery disease is an insensitive predictor of low ABI in
patients with renal insufficiency. Thus, measurement of ABI

in patients with renal insufficiency could contribute valuable
information on cardiac risk beyond what is supplied by the
medical history alone.
NHANES provides nationally representative data and
overcomes many problems of sampling bias, but the present
findings must be interpreted in the context of the study
design. Specifically, it is unclear from these cross-sectional
data whether renal insufficiency is a true causal "risk factor"
for the development of PAD. Although renal insufficiency
does appear to be associated with the future development of
claudication,20 further studies are needed to measure the
association of baseline renal insufficiency with progression of
PAD and future PAD events. A second concern is that the
present analysis may underestimate the prevalence of PAD in
persons with renal insufficiency because of the high preva-
lence of vascular calcification in this group, leading to falsely
elevated ABIs. In this situation, a toe brachial index may be
a more accurate screening test for PAD. We are unable to
overcome this limitation because toe pressures were not
measured in NHANES 1999 to 2000.
Conclusions
PAD is remarkably common in persons with renal insuffi-
ciency, and there is an independent cross-sectional associa-
tion between PAD and renal insufficiency. In the primary
care setting, the combination of accurate diagnosis of renal
insufficiency (either via measurement or estimation of CRCL
or via estimation of glomerular filtration rate) and routine
ABI measurement in this group would facilitate more effi-
cient identification of patients with subclinical PAD, a group
most likely to benefit from PAD-specific educational inter-
ventions and therapy and also from more general cardiovas-
cular risk-reduction efforts.
