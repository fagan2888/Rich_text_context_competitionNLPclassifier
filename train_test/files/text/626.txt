HMO Market Penetration And
Costs Of Employer-Sponsored
Health Plans
Higher market penetration by managed care leads to lower employer health
plan costs.
by Laurence C. Baker, Joel C. Cantor, Stephen H. Long, and
M. Susan Marquis
Growth in health care costs and in-
surance premiums slowed substan-
tially during the 1990s.1 Many believe
that the growth of health maintenance organi-
zations (HMOs), which have captured an
increasing share of the employment-based in-
surance market, played a large part in attenu-
ating the previous trend.2
Although the existing literature suggests
that HMO penetration can influence spend-
ing and therefore may be able to influence pre-
miums, no studies have examined the overall
effect of HMO penetration on total premi-
ums.3 This paper takes on that task, focusing
on employer-sponsored health coverage,
which covers 74 percent of the population un-
der age sixty-five. We use data from two sur-
veys of employers to examine the relationship
between HMO market share and premiums
for employer health plans in 1993 and 1997.
These data encompass two periods that saw a
wide range of HMO penetration rates. We
also investigate whether premiums for em-
ployer coverage are influenced through com-
petitive effects of HMOs on premiums for
non-HMO plans.
Data And Methods
n Data. Our data come from the 1993 and
1997 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Em-
ployer Health Insurance Surveys. The 1993
survey interviewed 22,347 private employers
in ten states: Colorado, Florida, Minnesota,
New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Okla-
homa, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington.4
The 1997 survey interviewed 21,545 private
employers throughout the nation. The sample
was concentrated in the sixty communities

Using two employer surveys, we evalu-
ate the role of increased health maintenance
organization (HMO) market share in containing
costs of employer-sponsored coverage. Total
costs for employer health plans are about 10
percent lower in markets in which HMOs' market
share is above 45 percent than they are in mar-
kets with HMO enrollments of below 25 percent.
This is the result of lower premiums for HMOs
than for non-HMO plans, as well as the competi-
tive effect of HMOs that leads to lower non-HMO
premiums for employers that continue to offer
these benefits. Slower growth in premiums in
areas with high HMO enrollments suggests that
expanded HMO market share may also lower the
long-run growth in costs. 121

followed by the Community Tracking Study
and in twelve states having significant small-
group rating reforms.5 These cases were sup-
plemented by a sample from the remainder of
the continental United States.6
The sampling frame for both surveys was
the Dun's Market Identifiers national census
of employment establishments. Within the
geographic units described above, the frame
was stratified by the number ofworkers at the
establishment. Both surveys were conducted
by telephone. The interview was conducted
with the person(s) in each establishment
most knowledgeable about the employer's
health benefit plans and workers' charac-
teristics. The response rate to the 1993 survey
was 71 percent; to the 1997 survey, 60 percent.
Because we use the data to measure aver-
age health insurance premiums and HMO
penetration in a market area, we restricted
our analysis sample for 1993 to employers in
one of the metropolitan statistical areas
(MSAs) in the ten states covered. For 1997 we
limited our sample to employers in one of the
fifty-one MSAs that are part of the Commu-
nity Tracking Study; the other nine Commu-
nity Tracking sites are rural areas. To measure
premiums in the market area, we included
only employer-sponsored plans for which a
premium was reported by a respondent. We
distinguish between two kinds of employer-
sponsored plans: HMOs and non-HMOs.7 We
limited our sample to the MSAs for which we
had reported single premium data for a mini-
mum of twenty-five non-HMO plans. Our re-
sultant sample for 1993 covers fifty MSAs and
includes 7,624 employers and 9,850 health in-
surance plans (6,806 non-HMOs and 3,044
HMOs).8 For 1997 we cover forty-three MSAs
and have data from 6,083 employers and their
7,832 health insurance plans (4,323 non-
HMOs and 3,509 HMOs).9
Our two study samples include ten MSAs
in common. We also conducted all of our
analyses for each year on this subset of the
areas to investigate whether any differences in
findings between years is attributable to the
different mix of markets that we studied. We
observe the same relationship between HMO
penetration and premiums for these ten MSAs
that we see for all of the study markets. There-
fore, we do not separately report the results
for the ten areas.
n Measures. Our goal is to examine
whether premiums for employer-sponsored
insurance plans vary between MSAs with dif-
ferent rates of HMO penetration. Health in-
surance premiums (which include the
amounts paid by both the employer and em-
ployee) were self-reported by respondents for
each plan offered, separately for single and for
family coverage. We classify plans as an HMO
or a non-HMO based on the respondent's self-
assessment of plan type, aided by complete
definitions of plan types as needed (HMO,
preferred provider organization, or traditional
indemnity in both surveys and point-of-serv-
ice plan in the 1997 survey). We report all
premiums in 1997 dollars; 1993 premiums
were adjusted to 1997 dollars using the medi-
cal component of the Consumer Price Index.
In addition to comparing premium levels
across market areas, we also compare the
change in premiums from 1996 to 1997 to in-
vestigate whether growth in premiums varies
depending on HMO penetration. The change
measure is based on an establishment-level
question included in the 1997 survey about
change in total health insurance cost per en-
rollee compared with one year ago.
The two surveys also obtained information
about the scope of benefits of each health in-
surance plan, including the deductible, coin-
surance rate, amount of out-of-pocket maxi-
mum, benefits included (prenatal, maternity,
mental health, substance abuse, prescription
drugs, and dental in 1993; vision, mental
health, prescription drugs, and dental in
1997), whether the plan is medically under-
written, and the waiting period for coverage
of preexisting conditions. We adjust premi-
ums for differences among plans in these char-
acteristics as described below.
The HMO penetration rate in each MSA
was measured from the survey data as the per-
centage of employees in the MSA enrolled in
their employer's health benefit plan who were
enrolled in an HMO. For 1993 we compared

the analysis results using the survey measure
of HMO penetration to results using an esti-
mate of MSA market share developed from
Group Health Association of America data on
enrollment and market shares of all HMOs in
the counties within the MSA.10 Because the
results using the alternative measure of HMO
penetration were similar to those using the
survey measure, they are not reported here.
We use data from two other sources to
measure and control for community charac-
teristics that might affect premium levels: the
Area Resource File to measure income per
capita in the MSA, and the data files of the
Health Care Financing Administration's aver-
age adjusted per capita cost (AAPCC) index
to measure the county per capita payment
rates as a proxy measure of price differences
between areas. The measure that we use is the
average payment rate for Aged Part A and
Aged Part B. The MSA area measure is com-
puted as the population-weighted average of
the measure for each county in the MSA.
n Methods. We compare average premi-
ums for employer-sponsored plans in MSAs
with varying degrees of HMO penetration. To
control for differences among MSAs in the
characteristics of employers or the health in-
surance benefits they offer, we estimate and
present premiums that are adjusted for these
differences.
We use multivariate regression analysis to
examine the relationships between area HMO
market share and premiums. We estimate
separate models for single premiums and for
family premiums. We also perform separate
regressions for each of the two study years.
The range of HMO penetration rates observed
in the data changed substantially between
1993 and 1997. Had we pooled the two years of
data, differences in premiums attributable to
differences in HMO penetration rates would
be highly confounded with any effects of time
on premiums. Therefore, we chose to fit sepa-
rate models for the two years.11
The key independent variable in our mod-
els is HMO market share in the MSA. For
each year we divided MSAs into four groups
defined by approximate quartiles of the pene-
tration distribution. We include indicator
variables for the groups. Since HMO market
shares rose substantially between 1993 and
1997, separate categorizations are used for
each year. For 1993 we divide MSAs into
groups with less than 10 percent, 10­20 per-
cent, 20­25 percent, and over 25 percent mar-
ket share. For 1997 we divide MSAs into
groups with less than 25 percent, 25­35 per-
cent, 35­45 percent, and over 45 percent mar-
ket share. We created categorical measures
for HMO shares to avoid imposing a func-
tional form on the relationship between in-
creasing penetration rates and premiums.
Differences among MSAs in other charac-
teristics might confound our analysis if these
differences correlate with HMO penetration.
Therefore, we control for plan benefits, char-
acteristics of the establishment, and charac-
teristics of the market. Plan benefits, enumer-
ated above, are included in the model to
control for differences in the composition of
health plans across areas and changes induced
by market competition. In addition, we in-
clude an indicator for whether the plan is a
self-insured or purchased plan.
Establishment characteristics in the regres-
sion include the size of the firm, percentage of
workers who are in a union, number of years in
business, industry, and amount of turnover in
the workforce in a year. We also control for
risk differences in the employee population
using the sex and age mix of the employee
population and an indicator of whether the
employer was ever denied insurance.
Factors that affect premium levels also may
influence HMOs' decisions to establish in an
area. Failure to account for this could lead to
biased estimates. We minimize this problem
by including area characteristics that are
likely to be correlated with both premium lev-
els and HMO penetration. These include in-
come per capita as a measure of area demand
for services and AAPCC as a measure of
health care prices.12
The regression models are fitted to data in
which the insurance plan is the unit of obser-
vation. However, the data are weighted so
that each MSA receives equal weight. That is,

the unit of analysis is effectively the MSA, and
the coefficients on our HMO indicator vari-
ables reflect the average premium for MSAs in
the group. We treat the MSA as the unit of
analysis so that each metropolitan area con-
tributes equally to our estimate of the effect of
HMO penetration, rather than giving higher
weight to areas with greater population.
Within the MSA, establishments are
weighted by sampling probabilities to repre-
sent the mix of establishments in the MSA. If
an employer offers multiple plans, plans are
weighted by their enrollment shares.
We use the regression to predict the ad-
justed mean premium paid by employers for
plans of a given type in MSAs in each of the
four penetration groups for each study year.
These predicted values adjust the premiums
to the mean value of the plan, establishment,
and area characteristics in our data. Differ-
ences between markets with different HMO
market shares are tested using two-tailed t-
tests of statistical significance.
We first perform this analysis including
premiums from all health plans, to assess the
overall effect of HMOs on premiums. We then
redo the analysis once using only data from
HMO plans and a second time using only data
from non-HMO plans. This enables us to ex-
amine whether the effects we observe on all
premiums are the result of changes in HMO or
non-HMO premiums.
Results
There was substantial growth in the share of
employees in their employer-group plans who
enrolled in HMOs between 1993 and 1997. In
1993 the average rate of HMO enrollment in
the fifty markets we studied was 21 percent,
whereas the rate was 37 percent in the forty-
three markets included in our 1997 data. This
reflects real growth in HMO shares over the
period and is not a result of the difference in
the surveyed communities. Among the ten
communities in common to both surveys,
HMO shares rose from 27 percent in 1993 to
42 percent in 1997.
n Premium levels. Overall, premiums for
employer-sponsored plans are lower in areas
with high HMO enrollment. This can be seen
in Exhibit 1, which reports average adjusted
premiums, as well as in Exhibits 2 and 3,
which plot average adjusted single and family
premiums across all plans by the mean HMO
penetration rate for the four groups in both
survey years. In markets with HMO shares
above 25 percent, total premiums for single
and family coverage were significantly lower
than in other markets in both years. In 1997
premiums in markets with shares above 35
percent tended to be lower than premiums in
markets with shares of 25­35 percent (Ex-
hibit 1).
In part, premiums are lower overall in mar-
kets with higher HMO shares because HMO
premiums are often lower than non-HMO
premiums, particularly in 1997 (Exhibit 1).
Thus, increases in HMO market share, and
workers' corresponding shift from non-HMO
to HMO plans, reduce overall premiums by
moving people from more expensive to less
expensive plans. HMO premiums also could
be lower in areas with higher HMO market
shares if, for example, growth in HMO market
share fosters competition among HMOs.
When we examine the relationship between
HMO market share and HMO premiums, we
find some significant differences, but there is
not a consistent relationship between HMO
market share and HMO premiums.
n Competitive influence. In addition, our
results support the hypothesis that there is a
competitive influence of HMO penetration on
non-HMO premiums. These premiums are
lower in markets with HMO shares above 25
percent than in markets with a smaller HMO
presence. In 1993 single and family premiums
for non-HMO coverage were significantly
lower in markets with HMO enrollment
shares above 25 percent. In 1997 non-HMO
premiums for single coverage were signifi-
cantly lower in MSAs with HMO penetration
between 25 and 45 percent than in areas with
low penetration; non-HMO premiums for
family coverage were significantly lower in all
areas with HMO shares above 25 percent
than in the low-penetration markets. There is
some evidence that non-HMO premiums in-

creased in areas with the highest penetration
(over 45 percent) relative to non-HMO pre-
miums in areas with mid-range penetration
(35­45 percent). However, non-HMO premi-
ums in markets with HMO penetration above
45 percent did not differ significantly from the
premiums in areas with HMO enrollments in
the range of 35­45 percent.
n Rates of premium growth. Markets
with high HMO penetration also appear to
have experienced much slower recent growth
in premiums than other areas have. The aver-
age reported increase in premiums between
1996 and 1997 in the MSAs with HMO shares
below 25 percent was 5.3 percent, in contrast
to an increase of 1.3 percent in the markets
with HMO shares of 45 percent or more (Ex-
hibit 4). The rates of premium increase differed
significantly among all of the market areas ex-
cept those with HMOshares of35 to 45 percent
versus those with higher market penetration.
Conclusions
HMOs have captured an increasing share of
the employment-based insurance market. The
pace of change is very fast; the penetration
rates in the ten communities we compared
rose by 56 percent in the brief four-year pe-
riod between our two surveys. Our findings
suggest that this expansion has led to lower
costs for employer-sponsored health plans.
Compared to markets with HMO enroll-
ments of less than 25 percent, in 1997 premi-
ums were about 8­10 percent lower in mar-

kets with HMO enrollments of 45 percent or
more. We observe similar effects of increasing
HMO market share in 1993. The savings oc-
curred both because HMO premiums were
lower than premiums for non-HMO plans and
because the expanding role of HMOs had
spillover benefits in lower premiums for non-
HMO plans. Specifically, the competitive ef-
fect of HMOs leads to lower premiums for
non-HMO plans in markets with HMO en-
rollments above about 25 percent.
The savings we observe reflect reductions
in average premiums across all employees. It is
sometimes argued that HMOs have achieved

savings only by selecting the healthiest and
least expensive patients, or by obtaining price
concessions from doctors and hospitals that
are then simply shifted onto other insurers. If
this were true, then the reductions in HMO
premiums would be accompanied by in-
creases in premiums for non-HMO plans; the
net effect on overall spending would be small.
Our results suggest that this is not gener-
ally the case. In fact, we find that non-HMO
premiums tend to fall with rising HMO mar-
ket share, precisely the opposite of what one
would observe if HMOs simply selected
healthy patients and shifted costs to other in-
surers. We had some indications of adverse
selection in non-HMO plans in areas where
HMOs have captured close to half the market.
Non-HMO premiums were higher in areas
with market shares higher than 45 percent in
1997 than in areas with 35­45 percent HMO
share, although this was not statistically sig-
nificant. The largest difference in the premi-
ums between HMOs and non-HMOs also
tends to be in areas with the highest HMO
enrollment. We note, though, that while pre-
miums paid for those staying in non-HMO
plans may be higher in these areas, overall av-
erage premiums still fell as HMO market
share increased.
In addition, the growth in premiums in re-
cent years appears to be lower in areas with
high HMO penetration. This suggests that in
addition to a one-time lowering of prices, the
cost differences between areas may reflect a
more lasting phenomenon as well. However,
we need to observe changes in premiums over
a longer time period before drawing conclu-
sions about long-run effects.
n Caveats and future research needs.
Although our results on health costs are en-
couraging, they are limited to two cross-
sections covering a short time period, and
they suggest several other issues for research.
Our data do not provide evidence of how the
savings are obtained--for example, through
efficiencies in the delivery system, through
provider discounts, or through slowing the
adoption of new technologies. We cannot
measure the exact distribution of these effects
between HMOs and non-HMOs. The growth
of HMOs may have spurred the growth of
other types of managed care plans, which may
be a factor in the lower premiums in high
HMO areas. We have not examined how the
distribution of types of non-HMO plans var-
ies across markets with different HMO pene-
tration levels, or how a different mix of types
of non-HMO plans affects premiums within
markets with the same degree of HMO pene-
tration. We also cannot address the implica-
tions for quality of care delivered in markets
with high levels of HMO activity.
Finally, it is difficult to know how these
results can be extrapolated into the future.
HMOs may have expanded initially in areas
where there potential to reduce costs was
greatest. We included some controls for this,
but our results still may overestimate the ef-
fect of changing HMO penetration and to
some extent reflect HMOs' location decisions.
If so, future expansions in other areas may not
achieve the same magnitude of premium sav-
ings. Moreover, other analysts have found
that in addition to the HMO market share, the
level of competition among HMOs also affects
premiums.13 Industry consolidation, therefore,

may affect future savings. Similarly, consoli-
dation among hospitals or physician groups
may affect the savings from increased man-
aged care penetration. The pace of change in
markets is remarkably rapid, which further
complicates forecasting from these findings.
There is an ongoing need for careful monitor-
ing of these issues, especially because of the
changing environment.

7. The latter comprise preferred provider organiza-
tions, point-of-service plans, and traditional in-
demnity plans.
8. Of the original sample of 22,347 establishments,
32 percent were excluded because they did not
offer insurance. Among employers offering insur-
ance, 32 percent were not in metropolitan areas;
16 percent were excluded because premiums
were not reported, and 2 percent, because of in-
sufficient plan observations in the MSA. Offering
establishments included in the analysis were
somewhat smaller than those in the MSAs that
were excluded; 72 percent of those included
were establishments of firms with fewer than
fifty employees, compared with 58 percent of the
excluded establishments. Offering estab-
lishments included in our analysis also were less
likely than those excluded to be retail estab-
lishments (17 percent versus 25 percent) and
more likely to be financial and professional insti-
tutions (46 percent versus 42 percent).
9. Of the 12,829 establishments in one of the fifty-
one metropolitan tracking sites, 33 percent were
excluded because they did not offer insurance.
Among employers offering insurance, 26 percent
of cases were excluded because they did not re-
port premiums, and 3 percent were excluded be-
cause of insufficient plan observations in the
MSA. As in 1993, employers in our sample were
somewhat smaller than excluded ones; 68 per-
cent of included cases were establishments of
firms with fewer than fifty employees versus 62
percent of excluded cases. Differences by indus-
try between included and excluded cases were
smaller than in 1993.
10. See Baker, "The Effect of HMOs," for a descrip-
tion of the methods for developing the GHAA-
based measure.
11. In addition, there were small differences be-
tween the two surveys in the control variables in
the regression. The 1993 survey collected data
about the joint distribution of the age and sex of
workers; the 1997 survey measured the marginal
distributions of each. The two surveys also dif-
fered slightly in the scope of benefits measured,
as noted in the text.
12. We have controlled for a number of factors that
may themselves be affected by HMO market
penetration, such as AAPCC and the scope and
breadth of benefits. Thus, our tests of effects of
HMO penetration are conservative tests.
