Abstract
Objective: To investigate the efficacy of the intraoperative posterior pericardial window
technique in preventing pericardial tamponade following open heart surgery.
Patients and methods: Adult patients undergoing coronary and/or valve surgery were
randomly divided into a control (traditional) or a pericardial window (PW) technique group. Pre-,
intra-, peri- and postoperative clinical data were collected prospectively, including incidence of
pericardial tamponade, cardiac arrest, drainage volume, ventilation assistance time and moderate-
to-large pericardial effusion.
Results: In total, 458 patients were included: 230 controls and 228 in the PW group. The incidence
of pericardial tamponade in the PW group was significantly lower than in controls. Cardiac arrest
occurred in one patient (0.4%) in the PW group and five (2.2%) controls; this difference was not
statistically significant. Moderate-to-large pericardial effusion after drainage extubation and new-
onset atrial fibrillation were significantly more common in controls than in the PW group. After
stratification by age ( 70 versus >70 years), there was no between-group difference in duration of
endotracheal intubation, although in the PW group, after removal of the tracheal cannula, duration
of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation was significantly longer in older patients.
Conclusions: The pericardial window procedure did not increase the rate or severity of
procedure-related complications. This simple technique significantly decreased the incidence of
postoperative pericardial tamponade and new-onset atrial fibrillation.

Introduction
Pericardial effusion is commonly encoun-
tered following open heart surgery, with an
incidence as high as 53­85%;1,2 2% of these
cases can progress to pericardial tampon-
ade.3 Even if the effusion is small and
localized rather than circumferential,2 it
may lead to supraventricular arrhythmia
and haemodynamic derangement.4­6
After surgery, patients lie in the supine
position, which can easily cause localized
accumulation of fluids in the posterior peri-
cardial cavity: Kuvin et al.7 demonstrated
that 49% of pericardial effusion events were
posterior. Moreover, Pepi et al.3 reported
that local effusion (57.8%) was more fre-
quent than diffuse effusion (42.2%).
However, the traditional pericardial cavity
and mediastium drainage pathway, with one
chest tube placed along the right atrium and
the other placed retrosternally in the anter-
ior mediastinum, hardly reaches the poster-
ior regions.5 Others8,9 have also experienced
failure when attempting to aspirate poster-
ior effusion by percutaneous pericardiocen-
tesis. Although Georghiou et al.10 and
Mangi et al.11 successfully resolved delayed
posterior effusion after cardiac surgery by
either video-assisted pericardial fenestration
or fluoroscopic guidance, the procedures
were arduous and complicated, requiring
general anaesthesia and single-lung
ventilation.
As a result, we have investigated a novel
drainage approach, the pericardial window
technique,12 to achieve a free passage
between the limited pericardial cavity and
the larger pleural cavity. Theoretically, this
manoeuvre facilitates the transmission of
pressure from the pericardial cavity to the
pleural space below. Intrapericardial pres-
sure increases during intrapleural saline
infusion in the same way as intrapleural
pressure. Nevertheless, cardiac output and
aortic blood pressure are better preserved,
pulmonary artery systolic blood pressure is
higher, and the degree of pulsus paradoxus
is lower with intrapleural infusion.13 The
present study assessed the efficacy of the
pericardial window technique in preventing
postoperative tamponade and effusion-
related complications with open heart
surgery.
Patients and methods
Patient groups and characteristics
The present study was undertaken between
January 2012 and January 2013 in adult
patients (!18 years old) who underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)
and/or valve operation at Zhengzhou
University People's Hospital and Henan
Provincial People's Hospital (this is the
same institution). Patients' daily function
and quality of life were classified according
to the New York Heart Association system.
Patients were prospectively randomized
using a computer-generated randomization
table into a control group and a pericardial
window group (PW group). For each
patient, the randomization result was con-
cealed in a sealed opaque envelope which
was not opened until the patient was put
under general anaesthesia. Patients with
hypertension (systolic level, >140 mmHg,
diastolic level >90 mmHg), type 2 diabetes
mellitus or chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease were included in the study. Patients
were excluded if they had prior sternotomy
or cardiac surgery, paroxysmal atrial fibril-
lation, preoperative coagulant disorders that
could have influenced the postoperative
results, asthma, and hepatic or renal dys-
function. The Institutional Review Boards
of Zhengzhou University People's Hospital
and Henan Provincial People's Hospital
approved the study, and all patients pro-
vided written informed consent.
For all patients, the following demo-
graphic, pre-, intra-, peri- and postoperative
characteristics were recorded: (1) factors
predisposing to the development of
Zhao et al. 417
postoperative effusion14 such as age, sex,
body mass index, hypertension, duration of
cardiopulmonary bypass and coagulation
profile; (2) incidence of postoperative car-
diac tamponade, cardiac arrest (excluding
arrests due tocardiogenic factors and elec-
trolyte disorders; included arrests were those
caused by pericardial tamponade as identi-
fied at reoperation) and blood transfusion;
(3) total drainage volume, incidence of peri-
cardial effusion and volume of effusion
collected by thoracentesis or pericardiocen-
tesis after removal of chest tube; (4) duration
of mechanical ventilation and noninvasive
positive pressure ventilation; (5) occurrence
of new-onset atrial fibrillation and duration
of intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Some
parameters (such as mechanical ventilation
time and noninvasive positive pressure ven-
tilation time) were stratified by age 70
years or >70 years.
Operative techniques
During the study period, the study centre's
standard clinical protocols remained
unchanged and there was no alteration in
the senior surgical or anaesthetic consultant
staff.
Cardiac surgery. Prior to anaesthesia, con-
tinuous electrocardiogram monitoring of
leads I, II and V5 with automated ST-
segment analysis was initiated. The radial
artery was cannulated under local anaesthe-
sia to monitor blood pressure directly and to
sample blood gases. Anaesthesia was
induced with intravenous injection of fen-
tanyl (10 mg/kg), midazolam (0.1 mg/kg) and
propofol (2 mg/kg); anaesthesia was main-
tained with isoflurane 1% in oxygen, entanyl
(3 mg/kg per h) and midazolam (0.2 mg/kg
per min). Endotracheal intubation was
achieved after the intravenous administra-
tion of pancuronium bromide (0.03 mg/kg
per h). A triple-lumen central venous
catheter was inserted into the internal jugu-
lar vein to monitor central venous pressure,
vasoactive drug infusion and blood gas
levels.
All patients underwent medial sternot-
omy. The left internal mammary artery was
the graft of choice for the left anterior
descending coronary artery, and saphenous
vein grafting was performed for other anas-
tomoses. In off-pump CABG patients, hep-
arin was given (150 U/kg; activated clotting
time !200 s; Tianjin Pharma, Tianjin,
China). Proximal anastomosis was per-
formed with aortic partial clamping; distal
grafting was performed using a stabilizer
(Octopus; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN,
USA). In on-pump CABG and/or valve
operation patients, 300 U/kg heparin was
used (activated clotting time !480 s; Tianjin
Pharma). Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)
was established with a roller pump (non-
pulsatile flow between 2.0 and 2.4 l/m2 per
min). Alpha-stat arterial carbon dioxide
tension management was used, and arterial
pressure was maintained at 50­80 mmHg.
Single cross-clamp antegrade and retrograde
blood cardioplegia was used, which was
repeated every 20 min before the removal
of the cross-clamp. Heparin was neutralized
at the end of the CPB stage by protamine
(1 mg for every 100 U of initial dose of
heparin). Cell saver and autologous blood
transfusion were performed as required.
Blood products were not used unless haem-
atocrit was <27%. Extubation was per-
formed according to blood gas levels
(inspired O2
40%, Pa
O2
>70 mmHg).
Before surgery was completed, patient-
controlled postoperative analgesia was
initiated via intravenous infusion of 100 ml
per kg of 20 mg/ml fentanyl citrate and
16 mg/8 ml ondansetron hydrochloride in
0.9% normal saline, infused continuously
at a basic flow rate of 2 ml/h. If the patient
experienced pain, a 0.5 ml bolus was given
via an automated patient-controlled anal-
gesia pump.

Pericardial window. Each patient in the PW
group underwent the pericardial window
technique under direct vision (Figure 1).
First, the phrenic nerve was identified and
an inverse-T incision (2.5 cm long in both
dimensions) was created. Gauze was used to
shield the moving (inflating) lung and,
before incision, surgeons identified the phre-
nic nerve to avoid damaging it. The incision
was made into the pleural cavity by non-
continuous electrocautery, parallel and pos-
terior to the phrenic nerve and extending
from the left inferior pulmonary vein to the
diaphragm, as described by Mulay and
coworkers.5 As well as protecting the phre-
nic nerve, adipose tissue around the incision
was staunched by electrocautery. Protocols
were adjusted in the following conditions:
(1) if right or bilateral pleurae were inad-
vertently opened during the sternotomy, a
right or bilateral pericardial window tech-
nique was performed; (2) if the patient had
dense adhesions to the pleurae, the patient
was treated by the traditional method.
A 28 F rubber tube was placed in anterior
mediastinum and a 28 F silicone tube was
inserted into the left and/or right pleural
cavity, through the seventh intercostal space
at the left midaxillary line. The tubes were
separately connected by a waterseal drain-
age device. If bilateral pleurae were opened,
a second 28 F silicone tube was inserted. To
avoid tube-induced arrhythmia, no drain
was placed retrocardially. The tubes were
secured to the skin with 4-0 silk sutures and
covered with a sterile dressing. After routine
closure of the chest, the drains were milked
and stripped at 30 min intervals to ensure
patency.
Traditional drainage. In the control group, a 28
F rubber drain tube was placed along the
right atrium in the pericardium and a 32 F
silicone tube was placed retrosternally in the
anterior mediastinum overlying the heart.
The tubes were connected using a T-shaped,
negative-pressure, drainage device. Tubes
were secured, covered and drained as for
the PW group.
Chest tube removal. In the PW group, the
mediastinal drain was routinely removed on
the first postoperative day and the pleural
drain was maintained until the daily amount
of drainage was <100 ml. In the control
group, because of the T connection, both
drains were maintained until the daily
amount of drainage was <100 ml.
Effusion measurement and categorization
After removal of the drains, pleural effu-
sion was measured by echogenicity of 2D-
echocardiography. Echo procedures were
routinely performed at 6, 24, 48 and 72 h
postoperation and on the day before

tive to the phrenic nerve with the pericardial
window technique.

discharge. Patients were kept in the supine
position, at an angle of 60 for each meas-
urement, and all echo procedures were per-
formed by the same investigator (X.Q.).
Effusion was categorized by the investigator
(X.Q.) according to size, as follows: small,
<40 mm; moderate, 40­80 mm; large,
>80 mm. Similarly, pericardial effusion was
measured by 2D-echocardiography and
categorized according to size and site as
follows: small, effusion localized in posterior
pericardial cavity, <10 mm; moderate, effu-
sion involved with anterior wall of right
ventricle, 10­20 mm; large, circumferential
effusion, >20 mm.
On postoperative days 3 and 5, and
before discharge, 2D-echocardiography
was routinely performed to ascertain
that there was no recurring effusion in the
pericardial or pleural cavity.
Thoracentesis and pericardiocentesis
The indication for thoracentesis was mod-
erate-to-large pleural effusion. Considering
the high risk of pericardiocentesis, the indi-
cation for pericardiocentesis was strict: (1)
under haemodynamic instability, peri-
cardiocentesis was immediately performed;
(2) if haemodynamic parameters were
stable, diuretic therapy was initiated, and
in cases where this was ineffective,
pericardiocentesis was performed.
Statistical analyses
Characteristics were described as
mean Æ SD or n (%). Two-sample t-test
and two-tailed Fisher's exact test were used
to compare continuous and dichotomous
variables between groups, respectively.
Differences were considered statistically sig-
nificant at P < 0.05. Analyses were per-
formed using SPSSÕ version 13.0 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
A total of 458 patients were included in this
study: 230 were allocated to the control
group and 228 to the PW group. The
demographic, preoperative and intraopera-
tive characteristics of the two groups are
summarized in Table 1. The groups were
well matched in terms of factors predispos-
ing to postoperative effusion. There were no
deaths attributable to the pericardial
window procedure, and the only complica-
tion was a bleed from adipose tissue around
the cut edges of the pericardium, which was
identified after reoperation.
The incidence of pericardial tamponade
was significantly higher in the control group
than in the PW group (Table 2), but the
between-group difference in the incidence of
cardiac arrest was not statistically signifi-
cant. There was no difference in the total
volume of blood transfusion between the
groups.
A significantly greater total drainage
volume was demonstrated in the PW group
compared with the control group (Table 2).
The number of cases of moderate-to-large
pleural effusion and the volume of pleural
effusion after removal of the chest tube were
also markedly higher in the PW group
(Table 3). The incidence of moderate-
to-large pericardial effusion was lower in
the PW group (Table 3); at postoperative
day 10, there was one case of moderate
effusion in the PW group, in which the
pericardium was diffusely adherent to the
epicardium by fibrinous adhesions, resulting
in the occlusion of the window itself.
Postoperative new-onset atrial fibrillation
was significantly lower in the PW group
than in the control group (Table 2).
An additional analysis was performed
after stratification by age (Table 2). In
patients aged 70 years, there was no sig-
nificant difference in the duration of mech-
anical ventilation and noninvasive positive
pressure ventilation between the groups.

However, in patients aged >70 years, dur-
ation of mechanical ventilation was longer
in the PW group than in the control group.
Furthermore, in the PW group, after
removal of the tracheal cannula, the dur-
ation of noninvasive positive pressure
ventilation was longer. In addition, the
duration of ICU stay was slightly, but not
significantly, longer.
In the PW group, three cases developed
pericardial tamponade with hypotensive,
oliguric and peripheral vasoconstriction,

which were identified and resolved by reo-
peration. One of these cases (with saphenous
vein graft) was due to dropping of the
haemoclip. At urgent bedside reoperation,
active bleeding and rapidly accumulating
effusion were disclosed, and, unexpectedly, a
large blood clot presented a herniation at the
inverse-T incision. The two other cases of
tamponade occurred after standard post-
operative analgesia was stopped: the
patients experienced dysphoria, hyperten-
sion (systolic blood pressure >200 mmHg)
and subsequently showed the clinical fea-
tures of tamponade. In both patients, trans-
thoracic echocardiography showed no
evidence of localized pericardial tamponade,
except for distension of the inferior vena
cava. Reoperations disclosed discrete bleed-
ing from the right atrial incision and each
had a large clot (5 Â 6 cm) that surrounded
and compressed the right atrium and ven-
tricle. Surprisingly, the incision still kept
patency and the posterior pericardial cavity
did not show any accumulation of effusion.
Prompt evacuation of the blood clot led to
immediate improvement in haemodynamic
parameters, in both patients.
In the control group, 13 cases encoun-
tered pericardial tamponade. Two of these
cases were resolved by thoracentesis instead
of resternotomy: one patient underwent
valve replacement and prolonged CPB; the
other patient had a preoperative history of
frequent chest pain, and tirofiban (0.4 mg/kg
per min; Yuanda Pharma, Wuhan, China)
and heparin (10 U/kg per min) were admin-
istered until sternotomy. Both patients pre-
sented with loss of blood from the wound
surface at the end of operation after surgi-
cally active bleeding had ceased. After $4­
6 h in ICU, the patients presented haemo-
dynamic instability. Bedside transthoracic
echocardiography did not reveal pericardial
tamponade and only indicated a large left
pleural effusion. By thoracentesis, the
pleural effusion showed a projectile feature
that implied high intrapleural pressure. A
total of 2.2­2.5 l of incoagulable blood was
drained from each patient, and their clinical
signs improved immediately. The other 11
cases of pericardial tamponade in the con-
trol group were resolved by resternotomy.
Discussion
The pericardial window method was tech-
nically easy to perform during heart surgery
and did not increase patient morbidity or the
number of surgical procedures. There were
no serious complications during surgery
except for one case with bleeding from the
inverse-T incision. Subsequently, the sur-
geons routinely cauterized the incisions and
checked for bleeding, and there were no
further cases of bleeding from incisions.
Therefore, the experience of this study
centre is that a T-shaped incision 2.5 cm
long in both dimensions is appropriate
for the pericardial window method.
Yorganciog
 lu et al.15 reported a protrusion
of a sequential bypass graft after CABG
from the pericardiotomy side; theoretically,
the heart could be squeezed by the pericar-
diotomy edges, which would increase the
risk of an incisional herniation. Also, a
larger incision could lead to the heart
losing support from the pericardium and
moving within the pericardial cavity.
Our finding of a significantly greater total
drainage volume with the pericardial
window technique compares favourably
with the result of Farsak et al.4 The current
findings of more cases and greater volume of
pleural effusion, and fewer cases of moder-
ate-to-large pericardial effusion and post-
operative new-onset atrial fibrillation in the
PW group, indicate that the pericardial
window technique provides an effective
drainage pathway from the pleural cavity.
Without the use of this technique, fluid may
collect in the pericardium and compress the
heart.
Overall, use of the pericardial window
technique resulted in a lower rate of
Zhao et al. 423
tamponade than the traditional drainage
route. However, there were still three cases
of tamponade in the PW group. In the case
where dropping of the haemoclip with
saphenous vein graft (leading to active
bleeding, rapidly accumulating effusion
and incisional herniation), it is speculated
that the rapid formation and collection of
the clot before blood could drain from the
pericardial cavity resulted in complete occlu-
sion of the incision and that, once the clot
had occluded the incision, intrapericardial
pressure rose steeply and impaired cardiac
filling. For the two cases with discrete
bleeding from the right atrial incision and
a large clot around the right atrium and
ventricle leading to tamponade, we speculate
that the pericardial window technique for
posterior effusion may be unreliable for
localized, rapidly formed clot masses at
locations other than around the right
atrium and ventricle. Transthoracic echo-
cardiography before reoperation did not
disclose the localized pericardial tampon-
ade, possibly because the early effusion with
a low echogenicity gradually became a clot
with higher echogenicity, which made it
difficult to differentiate it from surrounding
soft tissue.
In the control group, 13 cases encoun-
tered pericardial tamponade, two of which
were unexpectedly relieved by simple thor-
acentesis. We speculate that, although these
cases did not undergo the pericardial
window technique, the accumulated effusion
in the anterior mediastinum drained into the
pleural cavity through a small undetectable
gap in the pleural cavity. Transthoracic
echocardiography did not reveal pericardial
tamponade in the other cases because of the
effect of mechanical ventilation on lung
tissue. With the accumulation of pleural
fluid, the increasing intrapleural pressure
was transmitted to the pericardial space,
resulting in tamponade-like physiology,
namely `extrapericardial tamponade'.16­19
Vaska et al.13 demonstrated in a canine
model that right ventricular collapse is
produced by intrapleural fluid infusion into
the pleural space, and that there is a linear
relationship between intrapericardial and
intrapleural pressure. The other cases of
pericardial tamponade were resolved by
resternotomy because large clots in the
pericardial cavity cannot be resolved by
pericardiocentesis.
On the basis of the present study results,
use of the pericardial window technique
decreased the incidence of tamponade but
did not completely prevent its occurrence,
especially in patients with active bleeding in
the early postoperative period. We consider
that the pericardial window technique might
be most suitable for patients with coagula-
tion disorders, because the effusion can be
immediately drained into the larger pleural
cavity, reducing the risk of rapid accumula-
tion of intrapericardial fluid and a steep rise
in pressure around the heart.
The incidence of moderate-to-large peri-
cardial effusion in the control group was
higher than in the PW group, in the present
study. Fluid accumulating in the pericar-
dium presents a mechanical stimulus to the
atria, which can trigger arrhythmia,5 and the
current study observed a decrease in the
incidence of atrial fibrillation in the PW
group compared with the control group,
which is consistent with that observed by
Farsak et al.4 Conversely, the current study
demonstrated a greater volume recovered by
thoracentesis in the PW group, which
implies that the pericardial window tech-
nique provides a reliable drainage pathway
between the pericardial and pleural cavities.
Furthermore, continuous respiratory move-
ment with the pericardial window technique
removes fibrinogen from the effusion, which
results in uncoagulated blood collecting in
the pleural cavity that can be easily drained
out through the lateral chest tube. This
contrasts with the tendency for clots to
form in the drainage tubes when the trad-
itional pathway is used. However, at
424 Journal of International Medical Research 42(2)
postoperative day 10, there was one case of
moderate effusion in the PW group, in which
the pericardium was diffusely adherent to
the epicardium by fibrinous adhesions; this
resulted in the occlusion of the window
itself, as described by Sugimoto et al.12
Compared with those aged 70 years,
patients aged >70 years in the PW group
needed longer ventilation assistance time.
The pericardial window technique damages
the negative pressure and closed character-
istics of the pleural cavity and leads to
alveolar collapse, or even atelectasis.20
However, the significantly lower incidences
of both pericardial tamponade and atrial
fibrillation observed in the present study
suggest that the advantages of the pericar-
dial window technique offset its
disadvantages.
One limitation of the present study is
the sample size, which was too small to
find significant differences in rates of car-
diac arrest between the groups. Pericardial
tamponade is a rare complication and,
therefore, has a low rate of occurrence.
Consequently, studies with larger sample
sizes may reveal statistically significant
findings in relation to the rate of cardiac
arrest observed with the pericardial
window technique. Another limitation of
the present study is that there were no
infant cases, so this study could not assess
the efficacy of the pericardial window
technique in this patient group. On bal-
ance, in the authors' opinions, the pericar-
dial window technique may be valuable in
infants. Although the pericardial space in
infants is smaller than in adults (and
consequently pericardial compliance is lim-
ited), the authors of the present study
would be in favour of using the pericardial
window technique in infants undergoing
complicated congenital heart surgery and
prolonged CPB time, which has an adverse
effect on coagulation function. However,
the present study findings do not support
using the pericardial window technique in
infants requiring simple heart surgery (such
as atrial or ventricular septum defects).
In conclusion, the present study findings
show that that the pericardial window
technique is simple, easy to perform and
without serious complications. The tech-
nique is useful in reducing not only the
incidence of pericardial tamponade, but
also in reducing cases of effusion-related
atrial fibrillation. For patients with marked
effusion due to coagulation dysfunction,
the intraoperative pericardial window tech-
nique is suggested.
